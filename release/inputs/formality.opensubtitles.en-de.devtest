Why you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There.<eos> You look better already.<eos> I'm not better.<eos> I am anything but better.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with the doc on this one, hon.<eos> His eyes are okay, but he still looks skeevots to me.<eos> Well, no matter.<eos> We're gonna get you back to the city now and fix you right up.
Look, Vernon...<eos> Either way, I'm with you.<eos> We can deal with Frost...<eos> Or you say the word. I'll take care of these guys myself.<eos> Okay, we'll do it your way, Jack.<eos> That's the smart plan.<eos> Congratulations, boys.<eos> Now get to work.<eos> Thank you, sir!<eos> We won't let you down.
You mess with someone this long, his heart's gonna give out before you get what you need.<eos> I'm not shaking him down for cash, Joseph.<eos> I'm just saying, the guy's been put through the ringer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Kill the machine.<eos> I am at my wit's end with you, doctor.<eos> Scalpels, needles...<eos> Nothing pulls this out of you, and I know you could give it to me if you choose.<eos> It will kill you.

Someone here to see you.

Of course he does.<eos> - He's just jealous.<eos> - I would be, too.<eos> Where's my cannon, Chief Thompson?<eos> It's at the SSR...<eos> Undergoing repairs.<eos> I'm here to buy a little more time to finish up.<eos> Vernon insists on having it up and running before we deliver it.<eos> To impress me.<eos> To ruin you.

You already have.<eos> Go.<eos> Well?<eos> Hold on.<eos> That's it. I got it.<eos> The detonator's now blocked.<eos> Finally.<eos> "Hey, great job, doctor.<eos> You really saved the day."<eos> Samberly, I'm gonna kill you someday.
I need to stop guessing. I never get it anymore.<eos> It's OK.<eos> Everyone here is family.<eos> Now please, tell me what the test said.<eos> We found some acute blockages in your arteries<eos> -and you're gonna need a bypass.<eos> -A bypass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> I think it would be best if we did this as soon as possible so we can probably get you into an OR in a few hours.
I mean, you said you'd marry two men and they're both men.<eos> Let's go! Do this!<eos> I'm so sorry. I don't do interfaith marriages.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Why not?<eos> You're supposed to be so lefty and progressive.<eos> Well, ma'am, I became a rabbi -for three reasons--<eos> -I don't care why you became a rabbi.<eos> I care about you marrying our husbands.<eos> I understand that this is a disappointment for you and--
We have contractual obligations.<eos> We need those gorillas to be there.<eos> Just one quick question?<eos> I'm hearing problems, I'm not hearing solutions.<eos> Mind if I smoke?<eos> You have nothing better to do besides dress Kyra?<eos> Really find it worthy of your time?<eos> Do you have a better offer?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'm a correspondent for Men's Vogue in Berlin. I can put in a word for you.
- "bedtime for bonzo." - ah. - Bonzo was good.<eos> Movie was terrible.<eos> - Never saw it.<eos> Hap collins.<eos> Outlaw.<eos> - I do what I can.<eos> Come on, kay, screw your head on straight.<eos> Are my little meow meows hungry?<eos> kitty, kitty, kitty, kitties!<eos> - And I'll warn you again,
Uh, 30 working days.<eos> So it's actually a little bit more than a month...<eos> Right, right.<eos> No. See, that just can't happen.<eos> The next six episodes are built around Arya.<eos> I mean, her character gets her period for the first time, and so, you know, her witch powers start to show themselves.<eos> That's cool.<eos> That's a... cool idea.<eos> But if we lose Arya, then our production schedule gets fucked.<eos> And you don't think you'd be able to, like, shoot around her...
- Oh, well, that's cool.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. Well, hey, if you ever want me to come in and we spitball ideas or anything, I'd be happy to, you know.<eos> Well, maybe we'll do that sometime.<eos> - Okay. Cool. Yeah.<eos> - All right. Could you, uh, close that door on your way out?<eos> - Yeah. So I was like, "Why do you need a lock on your phone if you got nothing to hide?"<eos> Ryan, do you trust your wife?<eos> Yeah. She needs her digital privacy, Ryan.<eos> We all do.<eos> I wouldn't want you to know what I was looking at online.
That will help you get rid of all unwanted clutter.<eos> You'll find that moving only one or two items will get the job done.<eos> And that's all there is to it.<eos> Following these steps will give you the living room of your dreams.<eos> - Thank you. And can I get you guys started with some drinks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd love to get a glass of red wine, if there's anything you could recommend.<eos> Yeah, yeah. We have a NorCal Malbec that I'm quite fond of,<eos> - right there. - Oh, great.<eos> - And for you, sir?
Red wine for you, sir, and a sea breeze for the lady.<eos> Oh, thank you, but actually, it's...<eos> - Yeah. - What happened? Oh!<eos> Oh, man... Oh, no, how did I mess that up?<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> - Oh, I feel terrible.<eos> You know what?<eos> Those drinks are on the house.<eos> - Oh, seriously?<eos> - Yeah. From me to you, on the house, just because.
- No, no, no.<eos> It's cool. - It's gonna be fine. It's good, it's good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Can we switch tables? - What's the problem?<eos> I am so sorry about the air conditioner.<eos> Let's get you somewhere else before you freeze, huh?
Nobody?<eos> I win. - It didn't even work!<eos> - The second one did.<eos> As we suspected, it's a machine that cuts a fissure between our world and the Zero Matter dimension.<eos> The conversation has now turned to naming rights.<eos> Have you lot got nothing better to do?<eos> The Shears of God.<eos> It's a great name. Right, Jarvis?<eos> Patently ridiculous, sir.<eos> Ah, who asked you?
- I think it's great.<eos> How's that?<eos> Great work.<eos> From a lovely pair of hands.<eos> Mr. Stark, don't kid.<eos> Mr. Stark's my old man.<eos> You can call me Howard.<eos> All right...<eos> Howard.<eos> I can call you Howard, right?
Peggy, let go!<eos> No, Daniel, hold on!<eos> Hey, he's not supposed to be in there!<eos> Jarvis, what the hell are you doing?<eos> ! Gamma cannon can't fire, but it could be detonated inside the rift, correct? !<eos> And how are we supposed to do that?<eos> ! Well, it would entail destroying your hover car, if you don't mind!<eos> Samberly, get the core out of the gamma cannon!<eos> Stand back!<eos> Work good enough for you now, Dr. Wilkes?
People thought that splitting the atom would be the end of the world.<eos> - Look at us now.<eos> - Yes, look at us... developing exponentially more horrific ways to kill each other.<eos> Zero Matter, in the right hands, could've launched us a hundred years ahead.<eos> Technologically speaking, if we harness...<eos> Is he still whining about this? - Until the end of time.<eos> Sleep well?<eos> - I did. And I could sleep another week.<eos> Mnh-mnh. I'm sorry, Doc.<eos> But I expect to see you in the office, 8:00 a.m. sharp, come Monday.
We did have one dance.<eos> Half a dance.<eos> I suppose that's better than nothing.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I'm... I'm so glad I didn't miss you.<eos> Miss Carter.<eos> You were going to leave without saying goodbye?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> - Well, I... - Raised in a barn, my granny would say.<eos> Um, I... I didn't want to bother you and, um...
You were going to leave without saying goodbye?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> - Well, I... - Raised in a barn, my granny would say.<eos> Um, I... I didn't want to bother you and, um...<eos> I thought perhaps you might... might not want to see me.<eos> Mrs. Jarvis, I'm so sorry.<eos> I am home, and I'm safe, and I'm with a man who I adore, who is in one piece.<eos> Mr. Jarvis is a lucky man.<eos> I am, indeed.<eos> I'll just get Mrs. Jarvis settled, and then I'll be happy to take you wherever you need to go.
Oh, that won't be necessary.<eos> I've already rung for a taxi.<eos> It'll be here any moment.<eos> No?<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> But truly, you should stay here with your wife.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, of course it is.<eos> Fine, fine, fine.<eos> I beg you, allow him to take you.
It's okay.<eos> Oh, Cal, you were always so good to me.<eos> What did I ever do to deserve you, hmm?<eos> I know.<eos> Like we always do.<eos> Sir, you can't give her those.<eos> Why not?<eos> She'll just try to use them to claw her face open.<eos> There's my beautiful girl.<eos> I'd be quite happy to take you on to the airport, Miss Carter.
To the Arts Club for an eye opener?<eos> - No, there's something I have to do.<eos> - I'm needed in the office.<eos> Spoilsports! (CHUCKLES)<eos> CHILDREN: (SINGING) ♪ I like coffee, I like tea ♪<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> - Ah, how are ya, Arthur?<eos> - How are ya?<eos> - Haven't seen you in ages.<eos> - Glad to see you.
Lowe's a soldier.<eos> Soldiers want to act.<eos> And the decoded German messages, sir.<eos> I know about the decoded German messages, but our hands are tied.<eos> I think it really might be worth looking into, sir. MATTHEW:<eos> Well, you look into it, Charles, and then you come and report back to me, all right?<eos> CHARLES:<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> MATTHEW: Very good. Carry on.<eos> G Division left these personality files up for you.
But you can't. - I'm paid up to the end of the month.<eos> I don't care about the money, love.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - I'm sorry, Aunt Lilly.<eos> Is it a fella?<eos> I'll have my trunk sent on.<eos> Goodbye, Aunt Lilly.<eos> Miss Lacey?<eos> - Sergeant.<eos> - I've been asked to fetch you to the Castle.
Tell me what?<eos> You don't work upstairs anymore.<eos> On whose orders?<eos> Mine.<eos> I'm sorry. Hannah, I didn't know that...<eos> That I'm the Special Agent in Charge of the Joint Terrorism Task Force?<eos> Well, since everyone above me was murdered when the bank blew up, I was next in line.<eos> So now it's my job to get the JTTF back up and running.<eos> And it's your job to stay far, far out of my way, down in Operations.<eos> Did I do something to piss you off?
But it's our only shot.<eos> Go deal with him.<eos> I'll get the worm ready to go.<eos> I'll text you when it's time.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have nothing to say for yourself?<eos> As much fun as it would be for me to kick your ass, I don't want to spend the night in jail.<eos> How about I kick your ass instead?<eos> I wouldn't take a swing at him.<eos> He might just sue you.

I have a D.U.I. I need taken care of.<eos> FBI can handle that, right?<eos> All right.<eos> Call the number tonight, and the D.U.I. disappears.<eos> So, I call this number, you get a gold star.<eos> What do I get?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I might need some help at Customs.<eos> Deal.<eos> How do I get in touch with you?
What do I get?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I might need some help at Customs.<eos> Deal.<eos> How do I get in touch with you?<eos> Here's my card... with my name.<eos> Trainee Parrish, you have just failed this exercise.<eos> What?<eos> You're an agent?<eos> The test wasn't "Can you turn me?" It was "Can I turn you?"
Here's my card... with my name.<eos> Trainee Parrish, you have just failed this exercise.<eos> What?<eos> You're an agent?<eos> The test wasn't "Can you turn me?" It was "Can I turn you?"<eos> I failed, too.<eos> What?<eos> Which is even worse than your fellow NATs that came up empty.<eos> Whenever you are approaching someone, they are approaching you, reading you, searching you for a weakness to exploit.<eos> They can use money, sex, ego, the dignity of a cause... whatever it takes, to turn you on their side, because the information that you have in your head is always more valuable than what is in theirs.
How am I supposed to choose?<eos> You shouldn't have to.<eos> And that's why I'm granting you a leave of absence.<eos> You can leave in the morning and return to the Academy and resume your training once you've sorted everything out.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Get your daughter back.<eos> Hey, have a minute? No, no, no.<eos> Uh, uh, leave the door open.<eos> Um, I found these in the dorm, and I wanted to get them back to Ryan.<eos> I know he's probably still undercover, so I was wondering if you had his home address in Chicago.
I'm sure you've heard about Duncan Howell.<eos> Duncan Howell?<eos> N... no, I haven't heard.<eos> He took his own life last night.<eos> Before he did, he asked me to deliver a message to you.<eos> I thought I didn't have a choice."<eos> Does that mean something to you?<eos> Assistant Director, when Harper was a trainee at Quantico, were you concerned about his mental health?<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Interim Deputy Director, I'll ask you the same question... were you ever concerned?
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, we've heard from over a dozen of your agents, and they all say the same thing, except for one.<eos> Why does Alex Parrish, an agent that you once described as a bright star, disagree with you?<eos> Alex Parrish was one of the finest agents I've ever trained.<eos> If anyone's to blame for her delusion, it's the Bureau itself.<eos> After the Grand Central bombing, we fell for Harper's plan to frame her.<eos> Turned her into a fugitive.<eos> We broke her.<eos> He backed you, in his own way, even though you hijacked his entire agenda.
He backed you, in his own way, even though you hijacked his entire agenda.<eos> He's under a lot of pressure from the White House to close this case.<eos> Even if it means selling the public a lie?<eos> I read the report, Alex.<eos> There's not a shred of evidence to support what you believe.<eos> What about... what about Duncan Howell, the hacker who helped me discover the second bomb?<eos> Before he jumped, Miranda, he told the cop to tell me,<eos> "I thought I had no choice."<eos> Someone got to Duncan, probably the same person who got to Elias.<eos> What you're doing is not healthy.
You say I've divided a city because I don't accept your explanation, which is why we can't move on from those two fateful days in July.<eos> But I won't apologize for that.<eos> I can't.<eos> The search for truth isn't easy, and when I joined the Bureau,<eos> I took an oath to support and defend our country...<eos> Which is why I'm reversing my position today."<eos> "I can find no evidence that contradicts the Bureau's findings that Elias Harper acted alone.<eos> It's time for all of us to move on."<eos> Alex, what happened in here?<eos> Did somebody threaten you?
Samar won't be joining us.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> My name is Khaled Said.<eos> I am Samar's husband.<eos> Samar isn't married.<eos> But Haifaa, the woman you know as Samar, is.<eos> My wife, the woman you thought was your sister, has been kidnapped... Because of you.<eos> You bought this for her 11 years ago at the marché aux puces de Saint-Ouen flea market.<eos> She wore it every day.<eos> Haifaa never meant to hurt you this way.
I am afraid that it has cost her and me everything.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> Well, after your friend here made contact with her and demanded his cut, we agreed that it was time to end this, so she got in touch with her contact, and she told them.<eos> And the next day, she disappeared... she was on her way to pick up our children from school.<eos> Who is her contact?<eos> Who would ask such a thing from someone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look, whoever it is, I am sure it is them who took my wife.<eos> You have no reason in the world to help me, but you're the only one who can.<eos> So I ask you, please help me find Haifaa.
What'd you find?<eos> I did an ISP search on all the e-mails that Khaled gave us... and, um, you're wearing my shirt.<eos> Do you want it back?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know who's sending these e-mails, but I figured out where they're coming from...<eos> Croatia.<eos> In this job, you will make a lot more enemies than you do friends.<eos> We're not training you to be nice.<eos> We're not training you for what's fair.<eos> We're training you for what's real. - Hey.
In this job, you will make a lot more enemies than you do friends.<eos> We're not training you to be nice.<eos> We're not training you for what's fair.<eos> We're training you for what's real. - Hey.<eos> - Did you get anywhere with Charlie?<eos> Oh. No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> This came in the box from Mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're training you to deal with the unexpected.
Superiority to other men.<eos> Corner office.<eos> Who'd you have to blow?<eos> I heard he closed the Reynolds account.<eos> How exactly did you do that?<eos> Just that good, I guess.<eos> Don't forget about us little people.<eos> Oh, how could I?<eos> You know how I take my coffee.<eos> Excuse me, but they wanna see you upstairs in the partners boardroom.
Including you.<eos> We hear good things.<eos> Your work on the Reynolds account was inspired.<eos> Of course, the SEC will want unfettered access to our books.<eos> Any irregularities are sure to come out.<eos> You didn't really think we wouldn't find out?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You think there's a trick you can pull we haven't tried?<eos> This is amateur.<eos> Can I ask you something, Mr. Lockhart?
I took the liberty of informing your office of the accident, if that's your concern.<eos> They agreed with me... that business can wait and your health cannot.<eos> Hank Green said that?<eos> Even the acting head of a major Wall Street finance firm... can't argue with the consequences of a serious car accident.<eos> We don't get many visitors here.<eos> Most of my patients have done extraordinary things.<eos> Built vast fortunes... commanded great empires... but at a terrible cost.<eos> They have no one who cares for them.<eos> Mr. Pembroke is lucky.<eos> He has you.
Pembroke.<eos> Room 609.<eos> Steam bath.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mr. Pembroke... the steam baths are in that direction.<eos> You can't go in there.<eos> Not like that.<eos> Pembroke?<eos> It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?<eos> Do I know you?
Not like that.<eos> Pembroke?<eos> It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> My name is Lockhart.<eos> Mr. Green sent me.<eos> I thought they'd send Morris.<eos> Morris is dead.<eos> Heart attack.<eos> Mr. Pembroke, I've come to bring you back to New York.
You want me to leave here?<eos> Just for a few days.<eos> I'm afraid I can't do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm not well.<eos> You look all right to me.<eos> That's because you are blind.<eos> As I was.<eos> But soon you'll see.<eos> Rest assured, they'll take good care of you here.
Isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> She's a very special case.<eos> What does that mean exactly?<eos> She was exposed to serious trauma when she was very young.<eos> Her development was delayed.<eos> Hannah did not utter a word until she was 11 years old.<eos> Please understand...<eos> Mr. Lockhart... she is like a daughter to me.<eos> But we're here to discuss you.
Vanessa Von Reichmerl.<eos> She was sickly.<eos> The Baron was obsessed with finding a cure.<eos> It was he, in fact, who first discovered the medicinal properties of our water.<eos> He sacrificed everything.<eos> He must have loved her very much.<eos> Yes.<eos> Like a sister.<eos> History is right, of course, to judge him on moral grounds. But, as a man of science... I can't help but admire him.<eos> The duty nurse will escort you to our isolation wing.
We spend the first nine months of our existence submerged... our bodies mostly liquid.<eos> This sensory deprivation chamber simulates a return... to that embryonic state.<eos> Think of it as a cleansing of the mind... as much as the body.<eos> Some patients experience increased heart rate... visions... even primal memories.<eos> But rest assured, it's just the toxins leaving the system.<eos> Give yourself over completely to the process... and you will see the results.<eos> Keep a close eye on him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. Lockhart... the treatment lasts 30 minutes.<eos> I'll be monitoring you from here.
Something must have gone wrong with the machine.<eos> There's something in the water.<eos> There's something in the fucking water.<eos> There is nothing in the water, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> But I saw them.<eos> As the Director explained... some patients experience visions with this particular treatment.<eos> Just the toxins leaving the body.<eos> It's all part of the cure.<eos> You need to rest now.<eos> I will help you to your room.
Of course.<eos> Mrs. Watkins... time for your treatment.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> I just had one this morning. I'm sure of it.<eos> I have you on the schedule.<eos> I must not be feeling myself today.<eos> There is a terrible darkness here.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I'm sorry. I don't understand.<eos> I thought I saw you with a patient.
Okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> Do you know if there's a doctor here?<eos> What's that you're drawing?<eos> He won't talk to you.<eos> Doesn't know how.<eos> That's the castle... when they burned it down.<eos> My grandson, Wilmosh.<eos> He likes ghost stories.<eos> What can I do for you?
Doesn't know how.<eos> That's the castle... when they burned it down.<eos> My grandson, Wilmosh.<eos> He likes ghost stories.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Could you take a look at this, tell me what it says?<eos> Human?<eos> That's right.<eos> Not my line.<eos> I'll pay you.
Not experiments.<eos> A cure.<eos> She was pregnant the night of the wedding.<eos> Before they burned her... the villagers cut out the fetus... and threw it in the aquifer.<eos> The child survived.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't understand.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Mr. Lockhart... every time I turn around, you're somewhere you're not supposed to be.
Well, then, is there someone I could speak to... who might confirm you are who you say you are? Family?<eos> I hope you understand the need to verify your identity.<eos> You can call my office.<eos> All right.<eos> Can I get you coffee or tea?<eos> You got anything stronger?<eos> Of course.<eos> Rest assured... we will get to the bottom of this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Lockhart, we've been worried about you.
Thank you.<eos> Mr. Lockhart, we've been worried about you.<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> Is this man a patient of yours?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> I'm not a patient.<eos> I was in an accident.<eos> You signed the admission form. I have it right here.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> I did warn you about possible delusions, remember?
That's bullshit.<eos> I did warn you about possible delusions, remember?<eos> A side effect of the toxins leaving the body. And my leg, is that a delusion?<eos> Mr. Lockhart has been a disruptive element since he arrived.<eos> He stole confidential medical files... assaulted a member of our Dental staff... and threatened Mr. Pembroke.<eos> I didn't threaten anybody!<eos> I believe your exact words were...<eos> "If I have to, I'll hit him over the head "and drag him out by his hair."<eos> I was sent here to bring Pembroke back to New York!<eos> According to your employer, a Mr. Green... you're being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
63.<eos> The rest are camped in the mountains north of here,<eos> Grounder killers one and all.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> - Ooh rah!<eos> Hate to cut this short.<eos> We got to find Clarke.<eos> Clarke Griffin?<eos> Yeah. If only all of my Earth skills students were as good as her.<eos> It's good to see you, sir.
How can you do this?<eos> Everybody, back to your quarters.<eos> - It's over.<eos> - Nothing is over.<eos> We are surrounded by warriors who want us dead.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - No. It isn't, not even close.<eos> Why don't you show us all what you let the Grounders do to you yesterday?<eos> Come on, Kane.<eos> I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know. We do.
You can still be useful.<eos> They've been busy.<eos> Welcome home, Thelonious.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> Otan, stay close.<eos> Open up!<eos> I didn't see that coming.<eos> I want people on that gate.<eos> Chancellor Jaha?<eos> Sir, it's good to see you.
- You don't approve?<eos> - I don't judge.<eos> Since when?<eos> I'm not the same man that I was on the Ark, Charles.<eos> None of us is.<eos> I was a teacher.<eos> Now I'm chancellor.<eos> I am wondering, though, what do you know?<eos> He's threatened by you.<eos> I'm just a man who wants to save his people, no threat to you.
I'm not playing anything.<eos> This is who I am.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> I shouldn't have to tell you that.<eos> Now I'm done.<eos> Go easy on Octavia.<eos> I had to beg her to get me into camp.<eos> What are you doing here, Clarke?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Oh, you've decided that, the mighty Wanheda who chose the Grounders over her own people, who turned her back on us when we came to rescue you.
You won't.<eos> Thanks, Doc.<eos> You step aside in case someone answers.<eos> I told you, no one's home.<eos> What?<eos> Bet you didn't think we'd be breaking the law together when you arrested me on the Ark, huh?<eos> This isn't a game, Nate.<eos> If we don't find out what Pike's up to, more people will die.<eos> Then let's not get caught.<eos> Chancellor Pike, good to see you.
Does it hurt?<eos> He's ready.<eos> Takes away pain.<eos> It doesn't cause it.<eos> What if... what if you don't have physical pain, and what if it's more... it's more in your head?<eos> Pain is pain.<eos> Pain is pain.<eos> Your scars run deep, Jasper.<eos> You only get scars once you've healed.<eos> I'll see you on the other side.
Wanheda... vengeance is yours.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know if your death would bring me peace.<eos> I just know I don't deserve it.<eos> This man must die.<eos> If Skaikru will not take his life, then Heda will.<eos> Heda will speak for herself.<eos> Enough, Titus.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I wouldn't be killing you for what you've done.
No.<eos> I don't know if your death would bring me peace.<eos> I just know I don't deserve it.<eos> This man must die.<eos> If Skaikru will not take his life, then Heda will.<eos> Heda will speak for herself.<eos> Enough, Titus.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I wouldn't be killing you for what you've done.<eos> I'd be killing you for what I've done.
This is the sacred symbol of the Commander to whom I've dedicated my life.<eos> Now, how did you get it?<eos> Again, Jaha gave it to me.<eos> This would be Chancellor Jaha.<eos> Yes.<eos> He told me it was the key to the City of Light and that if I swallowed it, the woman in red would take me there.<eos> The woman who's not a woman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> She's a computer program, but I get that's hard for you to grasp, considering you pray to garbage, no offense, obviously.
What happened to "Welcome home"?<eos> Fuck this shit.<eos> The thing is, she's freezing.<eos> - Don't make me get Carlos.<eos> - Carlos?<eos> Dude, don't be a fucking asshole.<eos> I'm cold. Fuck this.<eos> Ma'am, we believe you've had enough entertainment for the evening.<eos> That's enough lip.<eos> Come with me so I can escort you out of the Castle.
- Nobody else is bidding.<eos> - Sold!<eos> - Congratulations, Professor.<eos> You just bought yourself a nuclear weapon.<eos> Well, well.<eos> We seem to have a new player.<eos> But you seem a bit academic.<eos> How did you get in here and who are you?<eos> As of a few seconds ago, I'm a nuclear power.<eos> Yet I don't know you or your organization, and I know everyone.
This era?<eos> Figure of speech.<eos> I got a feeling you guys might want to get those helmets of yours on.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> I'll provide a 25% discount to the organization which brings me the heads of these men.<eos> Can I burn some stuff now?<eos> I wish you would.<eos> - Now would be a good time...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> To kill you.
Let's go. Setting a course for the United States, Captain.<eos> People actually wore this crap?<eos> People smoked a lot of pot in the '70s.<eos> It clearly had a deleterious effect on the fashion of the era.<eos> Let's just hurry up and get that particle tracker so I can get the hell out of these go-go boots.<eos> Remember, when we meet my former self, it is imperative that we don't let on we're from the future, so let's just be cool.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'd forgotten how handsome I was.<eos> My hair, it's so thick and silky.<eos> Do I know you?
No. No.<eos> - I'm Professor Musk.<eos> Elon Musk. - Mm.<eos> And these are my two lab assistants.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Marty. Are you sure we haven't met before?<eos> Uh, that's a very interesting question.<eos> Um, suffice it to say, I am familiar with your work.<eos> That's actually why we're here.<eos> To see you.
We're in.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure about that.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Because you just tapped into a dummy box, which means those guards are gonna be here...<eos> Quicker than you can say "rookie mistake."<eos> Hands up.<eos> - So, who wants a hit?<eos> - Yeah, man...<eos> I believe you told me you were trying to quit.<eos> Oh, none for you, silver top?
How about you cut the crap?<eos> To which crap are you referring?<eos> I hold two PhDs, and I'm working on a third.<eos> I'm a five-time winner of the Carlin Award.<eos> My point being, is I don't believe either of those kids you're hanging around with can even spell "physics."<eos> You know, I'm beginning to like the younger gray less and less.<eos> Either you tell me what the hell is going on, or I'm calling campus police.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell you.<eos> It could cause... well, trouble.<eos> We're here to interview you for a profile in next month's "Wells Journal""
You know, I'm beginning to like the younger gray less and less.<eos> Either you tell me what the hell is going on, or I'm calling campus police.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell you.<eos> It could cause... well, trouble.<eos> We're here to interview you for a profile in next month's "Wells Journal""<eos> The "Wells" only profiles Nobel candidates.<eos> An exception is being made in light of your obvious brilliance.<eos> I know a photograph of this device would make a spectacular cover if we could just borrow it for a few hours.<eos> Thanks, but that's two years of my life.<eos> I'm not letting you walk away with it.
It's your business, right, to enter people's private lives?<eos> We aim for the best price in each party's interest.<eos> Of course.<eos> Such a good renovation is rare.<eos> I designed it all, I'm an architect.<eos> An architect...<eos> It's all in here:<eos> surface areas, service charges...<eos> You can take it.<eos> - Thank you. I'll see you out.
It's all right, Natalie.<eos> Okay, Walt, let me know.<eos> What's on your mind, Laurence?<eos> Hobie Doyle cannot act!<eos> Hobart Doyle is one of the biggest movie stars in the world.<eos> On horseback.<eos> But this is a drama, Mannix, a real drama.<eos> It's an adaptation of a Broadway smash!<eos> It requires the skills of a trained thespian, not a rodeo clown!<eos> I begged you for Lunt!
This came from Mr. Schenk himself.<eos> It's Hobie Doyle.<eos> Is the boy game?<eos> No, he's game.<eos> And gamey!<eos> Well, if he needs help, it's your job to help him.<eos> I'll have a talk with Hobie and take a look at what you've shot, but right now I've got a lunch.<eos> "Truth to these mutterings, Sestimus."<eos> Quiet, Engels!<eos> How pleasant to see you, Mr. Mannix.
All right, this might do it.<eos> Uh, Thora Thacker just came in.<eos> Wonders if you have a moment.<eos> Thora Thacker.<eos> Tell her I'm stuck on a call.<eos> I'll leave through the patio.<eos> Call didn't take so long then.<eos> Yes.<eos> No. Fast talkers.<eos> What can I do for you, Thora?
She wouldn't know a news story if it bit her on the posterior.<eos> - Yeah, well, she's...<eos> - High ankle sprain?<eos> Is that really the best you could come up with?<eos> We all know about the womanizing and the drinking jags and those trips to San Berdoo.<eos> Baird is a good family man.<eos> He has a high ankle sprain.<eos> Mr. Mannix?<eos> What's up, Peanut?<eos> Natalie told me to find you PDQ.
Aside from Baird and the director, it won't be a long list.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get it for me.<eos> That it?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> One more thing.<eos> A Mr. Cuddahy called,<eos> - said you know him.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> He said it's urgent, he'll see you one last time, suggested same place, 7:00 this evening.
But I'll...<eos> Reverse.<eos> Reverse!<eos> Reverse!<eos> I shouldn't wear scarves.<eos> It seems Allegra's a no-show, which is simply a bore.<eos> But I'll partner you in bridge.<eos> Why the pout?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> How pleasant to see you again, Mr. Mannix.
Or two.<eos> I didn't make it home in time for dinner.<eos> And I, uh, struck a movie star in anger.<eos> All right.<eos> Five Hail Marys.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Father?<eos> Yes, my son.<eos> May I ask you something, Father?
That's what they fucking say when you're in a fucked-up situation, you need to get things figured out:<eos> It's not two turnips in heat! Ricky:<eos> What is it, then? Turn up the heat!<eos> No, you would turn the fucking heat up to get the turnips cooked...!<eos> Why are you trying to fucking cook turnips? Ricky...<eos> How do you cook turnips, boys? How?<eos> I don't... It doesn't matter how! You cook turnips with heat, Ricky.<eos> There's nobody disagreeing with that, but the expression doesn't involve turnips at all!<eos> Maybe you haven't heard it.<eos> Maybe you haven't heard...
(Indistinct) Julian:<eos> What the fuck happened to you guys?<eos> We were hiding in the woods with all the stuff and then there were dogs after us.<eos> Uh, then we got attached by a flock of porcupines.<eos> And we packed and ran.<eos> fuck is all the stuff?<eos> It's cool, man.<eos> I hid it in the lake. Bubbles:<eos> In the lake? Like, underwater?<eos> Yeah, man, but I had to think fast, you know what I'm saying?
- Hi.<eos> - Did you call her au pair?<eos> Yes, I tried her and she's at spin class.<eos> Au pairs, right?<eos> Perky butts, years to waste.<eos> Well, all we can do is a focused meditation, and see if you can borrow the therapy pig from 2Y.<eos> Right, the pig.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will give it a shot.<eos> - It was nice to meet you.
The Magic Markers.<eos> Have a great day and be the change.<eos> Good morning, friends.<eos> Today is such a special day.<eos> Children, this is Mr. Reed.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Reed.<eos> Morning, kids.<eos> Wow, they're so well-behaved.<eos> Well, we strive to create an environment of learning that fosters emotional safety and respect for boundaries.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
So, um...<eos> So, Kevin.<eos> Did he leave anything behind that could be useful?<eos> I mean, to help me get to know the kids.<eos> Oh, you mean like a secret diary or like a burn book, right?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> No, no. - Mmm.<eos> Ah! - Those don't exist.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So, I'm just gonna have to rely on you then.
Your help.<eos> Hi.<eos> Good morning, Agent Reed.<eos> I really like your car.<eos> Don't you guys have something better to do?<eos> No.<eos> See, we need that list, and the girl cannot be allowed to testify against Mr. Zogu.<eos> No one can testify against Zogu.<eos> So, tell us where the girl is, right here, right now.<eos> Or I'm going to shoot you, right here, right now.
I was just trying to connect with them.<eos> With an air raid siren?<eos> Well, in hindsight, it seems like a bad idea.<eos> Look, we expect the faculty to provide an emotionally safe environment based on mutual respect and trust.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> You're on thin ice, bucko.<eos> I've employed the three-strike rule here at Hunts Bay.<eos> That's strike one.<eos> Two more, and I don't care if you have a letter of recommendation from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.<eos> I will fire you.
Hey, get out of here already.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> - Oh. - This is my office.<eos> Oh, hey, hey.<eos> There you are.<eos> Keep the drawer shut, Reed.<eos> - What are you doing in here?<eos> - Yeah, I was...<eos> - I was looking for you. - Oh.
- I was looking for you. - Oh.<eos> I was in the teachers' lounge.<eos> What did you want?<eos> I...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What were you looking for me for?<eos> Yeah, I wanted to, um...<eos> Go ahead, Reed, ask her out.<eos> Ask her out, I know you're gonna do it, ask her out.<eos> - I wanted to ask you out.
I know I should probably say that I already have plans tonight but to be honest, I haven't had plans outside of this place in months.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Um, yes, tonight works great.<eos> Another one bites the dust.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Okay, cool.<eos> - My office.<eos> - Oh, yeah, right.<eos> - Call you later?
- Yeah, I do.<eos> When I was in school... My dad got sick.<eos> And when he died, it hit me hard and I dropped out,<eos> I didn't think things would get any better.<eos> But then one day I woke up, and I just felt I had a lot more to give.<eos> I got a job and I turned things around.<eos> Well, I've looked for a job, okay?<eos> Nobody wants to hire a middle-aged salesman.<eos> I know some people.<eos> Let me ask around for you.

- No.<eos> Zack, Olivia?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> I'm with the FBI.<eos> This man has a gun, you need to do exactly what he says.<eos> Okay. Is this about the flame war on the Game of Thrones message board?<eos> Because I was totally joking.<eos> I don't even own a broadsword.<eos> Hal, this is not about you.
I got the six egg rolls, four orange chickens, two Kung Pao chickens.<eos> Just the way you like it. Oh... okay.<eos> Uh... I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Uh, you sure?<eos> Two more... Two more Kung Pao chickens, are you sure?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Okay, I gotta go. Bye.<eos> Are you the manager?<eos> Why, yes I am.<eos> How can I help you?
Does he slap ass?<eos> Is he a nipple flicker?<eos> Or... does he whip out the dildo and go to town with that?<eos> Oh, that sounds like a party.<eos> Hi, I hope I'm not intruding.<eos> I'm Dawn DeFazio. I'm your next door neighbor.<eos> Oh, hey, Dawn. I'm Butch Ryder.<eos> This is my best friend, uh, Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.<eos> The P stands for "pussy pounder."<eos> It's great to finally meet you.
It's Rum Runner night at Club Oro.<eos> - Lookin' sharp, by the way, big boy.<eos> - Really?<eos> You don't think this is too Magnum?<eos> You could never go too Magnum.<eos> Maybe lose the hat, though.<eos> Ooh, hola, neighbors.<eos> - Butch, Ronald, this is my co-pilot, Joan.<eos> - Ah. Dawn dragged me along to make sure she doesn't do anything to embarrass herself.<eos> Who's watching you, then?
Sit on it next time!<eos> It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> I'm an EMT. Let me just make sure you're all right, check your head.<eos> What's your name, dear?<eos> Heather Fishman.<eos> And how many asshole drivers can you see right now?<eos> - One.<eos> - Right on the money.<eos> Good.<eos> So, can we get you back to your house?
Don't be mad at him, he gets nervous every time he likes somebody.<eos> Whoops, did I say that?<eos> Oh, you want us to get that for you?<eos> - Oh, no, that's okay, I can handle it.<eos> - But your knee...<eos> You guys can leave, I'm fine.<eos> - Honestly, guys, you can leave.<eos> - Sure. What do we do?<eos> Mrs. Fishman, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to get you out of here.
Yeah, Shecky, I mean, do you have any files we can look at?<eos> Anything that would help us?<eos> My house got broken into and they stole my laptop and my cell phone.<eos> So you had a formula that actually works on cancer and you lost it.<eos> I never had any formula.<eos> That was Ronald's department.<eos> I just handled the money.<eos> You handled it so well that they couldn't finish the testing.<eos> Those drugs were working, Shecky.<eos> Is this a fucking joke to you?
What the fuck is the name of that thing, with the clamp thing...<eos> - A vise?<eos> - A vise!<eos> Yes, a vise, bitch!<eos> Why do I keep forgetting that?<eos> Come here.<eos> What's... What's happening?<eos> You are gonna tell me why you're lying, or I am gonna squeeze your head so hard, that that fucking mustache is gonna pop off your head.<eos> What is that?<eos> You've been shot! You've been shot!
A drug like that would be worth billions of dollars.<eos> A drug that replaces chemo... would ultimately cost them... trillions.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What?<eos> Make sure all my money goes to cancer research.<eos> You can... have my Nikes.<eos> I know you had your eyes on them.<eos> You really are a good guy.<eos> Tell Mama I'm comin'.<eos> Shecky! I forgot to ask you, who killed you?
We fished the tablet out of the water.<eos> I had my best tech guys take a look at it.<eos> And, uh... it's a goner.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Oh, baby, we'll find another way.<eos> We're gonna find another way.<eos> Yeah. We'll keep fighting. We'll keep fighting.<eos> Mrs. Kessler... your husband's under arrest.<eos> When your friend finishes getting his broken ribs patched up, I gotta take both of you directly to jail.
I do like to hear myself as I'm speaking.<eos> And shit is--it's a little harsh.<eos> I mean, it's more like a scrunched up piece of--<eos> What do they wrap candy in, baby?<eos> - Cellophane, innit?<eos> - That's the stuff your face looks like, paco. Yeah.<eos> I mean, no offense. Fire will do that to a face.<eos> It's normal. And you should stop pretending Like you're so noble.<eos> Where's all that '60s free love shit now?<eos> You get a little taste of money, and you screwed over The first two dudes you could, and now I'm gonna Screw you over, so...
Stand him up.<eos> You, James Mahon, did take part in an armed rebellion against His Majesty, the King, and having been tried by courts martial are found guilty, and sentenced to death.<eos> Handcuff him.<eos> All of your personal belongings will be delivered to your family.<eos> On your feet!<eos> MAN: Stand tall, men!<eos> Wait there.<eos> At ease!<eos> I came out to fight for an Irish Ireland, and I am willing to give my life in the pursuit of it.<eos> - We'll have to release you.
Mrs Butler.<eos> - Have you seen the woman prisoners? - Yes.<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> This morning.<eos> Could you persuade the military to let us see them?<eos> I have no authority over them. What about Stephen?<eos> I'm afraid he's not in a position to help.<eos> Could you not tell them that we don't condone their actions, that we want to talk some sense into them?<eos> I'm sure General Maxwell would approve, might even appreciate our help.<eos> I'm begging you, George.
It appears to be natural causes. See?<eos> Didn't have to pay me a visit, Mr Coleman.<eos> I simply telephoned to say that we discovered the missing money, or most of it, that my father must have simply mislaid it.<eos> He obviously hasn't been well.<eos> He officially reported the theft.<eos> Well, as head of the household now, I'm happy to withdraw the report and I apologise for the waste of your time.<eos> We'll dust the place for fingerprints nonetheless.<eos> Really, Detective, no crime has been reported or committed.<eos> I would have to protest to the Commissioner, please.<eos> Oh, Sylvester will see you out.
In that case, sir, I request that you grant me an honourable discharge.<eos> As I said, do you think us so foolish?<eos> You'll have no discharge, either honourable or dishonourable.<eos> This court finds that there was no attempted suicide and that the accused is of sufficient health and soundness of mind to return to the front.<eos> But, sir...<eos> In that case I wish to return to the ranks.<eos> You want to be a hero, Lieutenant, be a hero.<eos> You're to be transferred to the front in France immediately.<eos> But you'll have to be a hero at your current rank, Lieutenant.<eos> Though rest assured, I'll see to it that you won't be burdened with further honours in the future.
A sweet hearts dance it is.<eos> Hey, Brandine!<eos> You know how to shake and bake cherub?<eos> Cletus, you know I can fry up whatever you can shoot down.<eos> Oh, Brandine, of all the cousins I coulda married, you was my sister.<eos> Carl, this is Mandy.<eos> Mandy, isn't Carl everything I said he was?<eos> Okay, Lenny, time to stop talking about Carl.<eos> Why don't you to ask me to stop breathing?<eos> Oh, Marge, it's so great to combine the two loves of my life: goofing off and you.
Much... better.<eos> Suddenly, I don't want to kvetch.<eos> I want to kvell!<eos> I can feel all the tension going out of my beard.<eos> Oh...<eos> Oh... ♪ ♪<eos> Mona?<eos> I thought you were gone.<eos> Nonsense, Abe.<eos> I didn't leave you and I am never going to leave you.
Marge, all we ever do is leave them here.<eos> I just think there's more we should do.<eos> We could visit your mother.<eos> No. No, you're right.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Check it out, guys.<eos> CVS stands for Cheap Valentines' Surplus.<eos> You get a box!<eos> You get a box!<eos> Haven't forgotten about you, suspicious Iranian coworker.
I shall use science to uncover the secret to women.<eos> Homer, scientific research can solve anything except for cold fusion, quasars, the interior of black holes and what preceded the big bang.<eos> But everything else can be solved, including love.<eos> Pish-posh, Professor.<eos> What makes a guy and a girl click isn't science.<eos> It's chemistry!<eos> Which is science.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> See, I have asked an enormous cross-section of women one single question-- what attracts you to a man?
Ooh.<eos> Mm...<eos> I'm always next to the jerk who comes here to meet women.<eos> Hey, look, I get you.<eos> You broke up with a long- time high school boyfriend 'cause he just wasn't going anywhere.<eos> Then you play the field, but it's all losers who just want to take from you.<eos> Now you're just hoping beyond hope for a man you can hug who'll organize the wires behind your TV.<eos> And believe you me, sweetheart,<eos> I can organize every wire you have.<eos> Now I'd like to show you a picture of my new puppy.
Two are standing right over here.<eos> If you live in the past, you'll never have us.<eos> And what's more precious to a grampa than his grandchildren?<eos> Particularly his grandson.<eos> Aw, your sexist argument has won me over.<eos> We women will have our day.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> Good-bye, Mona.<eos> And good-bye, pack of cigarettes for a quarter.<eos> I think I'll miss you the most.
I hope she's okay. Me too.<eos> Be safe, Norma, okay?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hello.<eos> You must be Miss Decody. I'm Dr. Porter.<eos> I'll be your anesthesiologist today.<eos> Please, can you call me Emma?<eos> Miss Decody just sounds weird.<eos> All right, Emma.<eos> Well, they're ready for you now, so Jason here is gonna wheel you into the operating room, then I'm gonna ask you a few questions, and then we're gonna get started, okay?
You excited? I don't know; it's just hard to believe you're gonna take out my lungs and put some others in there.<eos> It's jus... it's crazy.<eos> You're gonna be great. Let's go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Excu... excuse me.<eos> Uh, wha... what's happening?<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're at the county hospital.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Ah, police brought you in.
- Is that right?<eos> - Uh-huh. You know you were lost?<eos> No, I... I don't remember anything.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> Oh, only an hour.<eos> Is my mother here? No, you were brought in alone.<eos> Can you just undo these?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Only the doctor can.<eos> Now, we're trying to get you admitted, but we're pretty crowded, so just try to relax, and the doctor will check on you in a little while.
- Can I at least see him?<eos> - Not until we've assessed him.<eos> He's my son.<eos> What right do you have to tell me that I can't see him?<eos> Your son is 18. Legally, he is an adult.<eos> He is quite possibly mentally ill and dangerous.<eos> The time for you to take care of him was before this.<eos> Do you know that it could be seen as negligent that you never took your son to a doctor even though he clearly has issues?<eos> Can I please see him?<eos> If and when we need you, we'll contact you.
Uh, Dr. Edwards?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, hi.<eos> - Um, my name is Norma Bates, and I would like to bring my son to you for a diagnosis.<eos> Oh, well, feel free to call my office and make an appointment.<eos> Okay, but it's a bit of an emergency.<eos> Oh, no, no, it's like... it's not a 911 kind of p... a problem.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm a single mother.<eos> My son is 18.<eos> He's having a lot of emotional problems right now and, uh, you know, it's hard being a woman alone with no one to turn to for help.
Mother.<eos> Good!<eos> Did you actually think you could lure Norman away from me?<eos> Oh, geez, don't look at me like that.<eos> You can't take this shit so seriously.<eos> I... is the motel open?<eos> I just need a room for a few nights.<eos> Do you take cash?<eos> Okay, of course.<eos> I'll check you in.
Have a nice evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> You look awesome.<eos> Oh. Hello?<eos> - Mrs. Bates?<eos> - Yes? This is Willamette County Hospital.<eos> Dr. Palma has approved discharging your son.<eos> He'll be ready at noon today.<eos> Okay. Okay, thank you very much.
Okay.<eos> Enjoy. You really are nice, aren't you?<eos> Emma said you were.<eos> The one time you ran into her in the village?<eos> I didn't meet her in the village.<eos> I'm Emma's mother.<eos> You're Emma's mother?<eos> She wrote me from here once and told me how much she admired you.<eos> She said she had a crush on your son Norman and that he was her best friend.<eos> She really just had wonderful things to say about both of you.
You can't go back to what you were doing.<eos> You cannot ignore his need for care.<eos> I'm gonna get him into Pineview.<eos> It's a great facility.<eos> It has a long waiting list.<eos> Well, I know, but I'm gonna get him in there.<eos> Well, whatever you do, I'm going to need to know that he has a doctor and a plan for treatment, or I'm going to return him to this facility.<eos> No, this place can't help him.<eos> Doing nothing isn't, either.<eos> Social Services will be contacting you in the next 48 hours.
You'll need to provide them with a doctor's plan for treatment or he's coming back here.<eos> Mother?<eos> What happened to your head?<eos> Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Let's go home, Mother.<eos> Hello, Norma.<eos> What can I do for you?
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.<eos> Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!<eos> I barely passed the pft!<eos> What do you think undercover work is?<eos> Beating guys up and shooting at them?<eos> No, it's people skills. It's controlling situations.<eos> - It's this.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.<eos> I saw you with that Muslim kid.

This is Nate.<eos> - Hey, Gerry Conway.<eos> - Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Vince told me all about you.

What's up?<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> I don't think she's feeling good.<eos> I know.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm working on getting her better, okay?<eos> It's just...<eos> She's been talking to herself.<eos> Listen.<eos> I will be home with you very soon, and I am gonna get Mom better. I promise.
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> It never leaves us.<eos> It is who we are.<eos> When Lucifer fell, he did not fall alone.<eos> One brother to Earth and the other to Hell.<eos> Both in an eternal quest for the Mother of Evil.<eos> You'll understand I find it difficult to accept I'm the object of an eternal satanic quest.<eos> You have to learn to protect yourself.<eos> They will hunt you until the end of days.
A fitting tribute to our fallen hero.<eos> Oh, you would not have heard of it, I'll hazard.<eos> Tennyson has died.<eos> He who dined with Coleridge and walked with Wordsworth, our great poetic link to ages gone...<eos> "I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most;<eos> 'Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all."<eos> You've ignored my letters and cards.<eos> I should be capaciously insulted but for my understanding of your... unique nature.<eos> My dear, dear Miss Ives.<eos> My heart is saddened to see you in these lowered circumstances, amongst the spiders and flies.

My heart is saddened to see you in these lowered circumstances, amongst the spiders and flies.<eos> Shall we not at least try to bring you back to the mammalian community?<eos> There was a time in my life... when I fell into a state of ennui beyond compare.<eos> I was quite divorced from the man I was or wanted to be.<eos> But my... unique nature... left me feeling loathed and loathsome.<eos> And then I was introduced to a woman who saved my life.<eos> A mental doctor of a sort.<eos> I was skeptical but the proof is in the pudding, and here I sit before you... resplendently who I am,<eos> entirely because of her ministrations.<eos> I beg you to see her.
American Indian?<eos> Chiricahua Apache by birth and right.<eos> Are you familiar with the West?<eos> Only through the newspapers.<eos> It is not what it was.<eos> But then what is, Sir Malcolm?<eos> How do you know me?<eos> I've been following you.<eos> In Africa?<eos> I missed you in London, so I came to this place.
He who is almost my son.<eos> You know you have a further destiny.<eos> Let this be it.<eos> Our son needs us.<eos> Where is your heart, Malcolm Murray?<eos> Be who you are.<eos> Mr. Talbot.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Hell, we're your liberators.<eos> From those Federals who would have hung you from the neck until dead, as the warrant goes.

But... but, don't you want to know what's wrong with me?<eos> I already know what's wrong with you.<eos> You're unhappy.<eos> You're isolated.<eos> You think you're the cause of this unhappiness and are unworthy of affection so you've few friends.<eos> Recently you lost something you think very important.<eos> Your lover, your faith, your family, or all three.<eos> You blame yourself for this, so it makes you neurotic, and you don't sleep and don't eat anything healthy anyway.<eos> You used to take care of your appearance, but you've lost interest in that, so you avoid mirrors.<eos> Sunlight bothers you, so you avoid that too, about which you're guilty because you think it's unhealthy and even immoral not to like the sun.
Far be it from me to get between a man and his tiger.<eos> Thank you, Miss Ives.<eos> I do hope you'll enjoy the exhibits.<eos> All the dusty cases.<eos> Give them a glance. They repay the effort.<eos> Good day to you.<eos> Good day.<eos> Good day.<eos> October the 6th, 1892.<eos> My dear Sir Malcolm, where this letter shall find you, I don't know.

You ran from your tribe.<eos> Tonight... you stop running.<eos> Tonight, you accept the destiny that God has granted.<eos> I will do whatever I need to, to save her.<eos> Promises he has made.<eos> Delicious promises.<eos> Tasty morsels I shall have.<eos> None more tasty than you, my dear.<eos> Oh, stop, you'll turn my head.<eos> Oh, yes, he'll give you to me, as my reward.
Caring for nothing?<eos> Small price to pay for such immortal perfection, isn't it?<eos> Goodbye, Dorian.<eos> I hope they watch over you.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> And I'll be here.<eos> I'll always be here.<eos> You are painfully true to form in every instant.<eos> Weak and sentimental as you have always been!<eos> I should never have left you alone with her! It was a monstrous idea!
And then you'd get the acclaim and affection that's eluded you your whole life?<eos> Yes!<eos> If you think scientific achievement will bring you acceptance or even esteem, an entree into proper society, you're deluding yourself.<eos> That's not the world we live in.<eos> I create my own world.<eos> I create my own self.<eos> And one day, one day, all of you will understand that of which I am capable.<eos> I'm sorry, Henry.<eos> It's a dark road ahead for you, I fear.<eos> And for you, old man?

There is no road ahead for me.<eos> There will always be a place for you here, Victor, in the heart of science.<eos> Now, it is time for my rounds.<eos> Good day, my friend.<eos> Oh, there is one thing more.<eos> This day is not a total loss for me.<eos> My hateful father has died, you see.<eos> At long last, the estate and the title are finally mine.<eos> So I'm not so far from the aristocracy as you might think.<eos> Then I should properly call you by your title.
Ms. Vaughan.<eos> This is a coincidence.<eos> It's not, actually.<eos> I made a few calls, found out where you were dining and that you were dining alone, so I thought...<eos> You thought you'd demonstrate your firm's investigative prowess?<eos> Is that how you landed Seth Hamilton?<eos> I didn't have to do much.<eos> Your secretary is very chatty.<eos> She's not gonna be my secretary much longer.<eos> Our firm is happy to vet new candidates for you... unless, of course, you think we're aren't a good fit.
He's been after Christopher for years.<eos> He can help us.<eos> I am not going to sit in his supervisor's office telling a roomful of smug FBI agents what happened to me... what I let happen to me.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Just give me till the end of the day.<eos> I'll find something.<eos> Now are you ready to talk?<eos> You've been following me?<eos> Was that his car?<eos> Who is he to you?
Christopher is gonna use the information that he stole from us to become one of those people... giving him direct access to one of our biggest clients.<eos> Seth Hamilton?<eos> Andrew Merrick.<eos> I...<eos> Dr. Merrick? This is...<eos> I thought...<eos> I-I was told you couldn't make it.<eos> My trip to Stockholm was postponed.<eos> I hope it's all right. Of course.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
And now this.<eos> Other agents are already all over this hack, investigating, which means you have to beat the rest of DHS to the punch, especially if this turns out to be about Vincent.<eos> Well, is it?<eos> I-I didn't know you were finished.<eos> Um, I don't know specifically what the hackers were after yet, but I do know that they targeted highly classified, deep cover assets.<eos> And they definitely seem to be looking for somebody in particular.<eos> I don't know yet, but good news is the files are heavily encrypted, which buys us some time to find out.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> And neither do you.<eos> It's not just about you or your husband's ass on the line anymore-- it's mine, too.

Do you have any idea what would happen if the public found out that DHS was protecting a beast?<eos> If I was?<eos> Okay, look, the chances of this... hack being a coincidence on the heels of somebody killing the only other agent who knew about Vincent are... they're remote.<eos> So if you'll just give me access...<eos> DHS cannot be involved.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I can't risk it.<eos> You'll have to investigate this hack on your own, and you'll have to do it before the rest of DHS finds out what's going on.<eos> What, so if anything goes wrong, you disavow any knowledge of it?<eos> Look, I covered for you because it was the right thing to do at the time.
You know I got a real job, right? Real life.<eos> Supposedly.<eos> Bootsy Durbrige? Detective Chandler, NYPD.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Just texting my doggie to make sure she knows I'm okay.<eos> Thank God she was at the groomers when it happened, right?<eos> Mind if I ask you a few questions? Actually, I do.<eos> I'm a little tired, somebody just tried to blow me up.<eos> Actually, they didn't.<eos> They were just trying to scare you.
And since I was looking for something good to do with my life instead of just partying and... getting into trouble, I said yes.<eos> I didn't realize it might get me killed.<eos> So you know why someone hacked into DHS.<eos> Probably to find out where the informants are.<eos> Informants I've used my family's resources to hide.<eos> Look, the Feds don't have the budget to lure wealthy C.I.'s into witness protection, so they asked me to bridge the financial gap.<eos> I thought it was the right thing to do.<eos> It was.<eos> Except now my whole family's in danger because of me.<eos> I know how you feel.
Do you love him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I can't hate him.<eos> Why else would you fall for him?<eos> He did everything right.<eos> And you dove through a hole in the universe for me!<eos> You're not Will.<eos> Will died saving Jemma... from me.<eos> Now you know how it feels, Coulson... to watch someone you care for bleed out right in front of you.<eos> And now I'm coming to put you down.
That convoy was loaded with weapons that were supposed to help us fight whatever this is.<eos> And now weapons are gone.<eos> But we're here.<eos> We've got a team on the ground, and we're here to help.<eos> I don't know how it is that your agency still exists, nor do I want to know, but I appreciate your help.<eos> Does that mean you're reauthorizing S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> The public has a short memory but not that short.<eos> The image of Helicarriers crashing down on the nation's capital is hard to forget.<eos> Then why is this meeting happening if S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't exist?<eos> Because I need you to keep doing what you're doing.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Ah. So you snap back to the same spot like a yoyo.<eos> Good to know.<eos> How about you let me...<eos> Damn it!<eos> I'm starting to hate you.
- Just kill me.<eos> Just kill me. Just kill me.<eos> Just kill me.<eos> Just kill me.<eos> It's working.<eos> Tell me about Gideon Malick.<eos> I'll handle everything.<eos> He sold me out.<eos> You sold me out.<eos> Before he sold you out, you reached him.
No, he's in no shape to make phone calls these days.<eos> You made sure of that, if I'm talking to Gideon Malick.<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Phil Coulson here.<eos> Is this about Rosalind Price?<eos> The man who took her is gone.<eos> As will be everything you value.<eos> It's started to unravel, hasn't it?<eos> Your portal gone, the Inhumans you stockpiled murdered...<eos> It wasn't easy to get this number, but this call will cost you.
Might be a good thing, keeping her close.<eos> It's safer.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Is it safer?<eos> Four of us in one place makes us vulnerable, like the 12 Inhumans Lash killed.<eos> It's hard to build a team if everyone's spread over the world.<eos> When I was a hacker, my team and I, we were tight, and we weren't on the same continent.<eos> Yeah, with the right tech solution, it could work.<eos> Let's hope the Director agrees.<eos> If we need backup, or if you do, we're a tap away.
You want to believe, but you don't know if you can.<eos> Coulson survived.<eos> Could be you're not who I thought you were.<eos> You'll believe... once I make a believer out of him.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> It makes perfect sense to name him the head of the ATCU.<eos> He knows all the players, the public respects military authority...<eos> You've worked together.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it "together."<eos> He has the utmost respect for you.
You don't really believe you can make enough bullets to stop all the Grounders, do you?<eos> I have to.<eos> No.<eos> You need to turn yourself in and end this blockade.<eos> Is that why you're here, to run this plan by me?<eos> No, I'm here because I have a responsibility to speak to you like someone who understands this world in a way that you don't.<eos> The only way this doesn't end with us dead is you doing the right thing.<eos> Like you all did the right thing when you turned in that boy Finn?<eos> You surrendered one of the young lives you swore to protect, and the Grounders did what they always do.<eos> They betrayed you.
Right.<eos> Yeah. I wouldn't miss it.<eos> Be ready in an hour.<eos> Bellamy, you were right.<eos> I've got eyes on Kane.<eos> Anything suspicious?<eos> Yeah. He's got something going, and I think Sinclair's part of it.<eos> Copy that.<eos> We'll stay on Sinclair.<eos> Bellamy's heading towards you now.
I'm the chief engineer, and this camp needs me.<eos> That's up to Pike, but it shouldn't be a problem.<eos> What happened to you, Charles?<eos> You committed treason.<eos> You acted against your own people.<eos> Don't stand there and try and take the high road with me.<eos> - It's demeaning.<eos> - I did nothing wrong.<eos> Nothing that I can prove yet.<eos> Sinclair will give you up.
- Go.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I don't suppose you know anything about this.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> You left me no choice.<eos> It worked.<eos> We're clear.<eos> The guards have their hands full.<eos> Is the gate open?<eos> Waiting on you.
Raven...<eos> Is strong, and she's not alone.<eos> Free will and the need for consent are part of my core programming.<eos> I cannot override them.<eos> I know that, but maybe I can.<eos> As you know, the terms of martial law and of the Exodus Charter give me both latitude and ultimate authority in determining your punishment.<eos> Do you have anything to say for yourself?<eos> I admire your adherence to the rule of law...<eos> I really do... but these are times when we have to look beyond the rules... to realize they were established to serve a world of the past,<eos> I beg you one last time... to see the world as it is, not as it was or as you want it to be.

Previously on "The 100"...<eos> You left me no choice.<eos> Marcus Kane, for the crime of treason, I hereby sentence you to death.
Maybe this time, Octavia will get it.<eos> Your loyalty will always be with your people.<eos> Octavia is my people.<eos> Then take these chains off me, and we can help her together.<eos> Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Lincoln.<eos> I can't free your people... but I can promise they'll be cared for.<eos> Lincoln of Trikru, you have been sentenced to death in accordance with the Exodus Charter.<eos> Any last words?<eos> Not for you.
We can save them, but we have to work together.<eos> You're the reason they need saving.<eos> They're searching the station.<eos> We need to go now.<eos> I love you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Just get her out of here.<eos> Lincoln of Trikru, you have been sentenced to death in accordance with the Exodus Charter.<eos> - Any last words?<eos> - Not for you.
Now you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> One in the girl's leg.<eos> Let go.<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> I'm fine. You got about 5 seconds to make me believe you're still with me.<eos> All the others are in a cave not far from here.<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> Give me the coordinates.<eos> I don't have the coordinates, but I can take you there.
Just let them go.<eos> You murdered 381 people.<eos> You took the lives of my children, my brother, my friends.<eos> Did you really think that I would be happy with just one life in return?<eos> Airlock 5, oxygen venting.<eos> Airlock 5, oxygen venting.<eos> Now you're gonna feel what I felt.<eos> Beg me to stop it.<eos> I told you to beg!<eos> - I'm begging you.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to tell us the key to surviving on the ground.<eos> No, not really. No.<eos> Ms. Blake, how about you?<eos> The key to survival on Earth, what is it?<eos> Not dying?<eos> You can laugh all you want, but we've got a lot to learn here... making fire, tying knots, how to navigate using the stars, how to hunt.<eos> You have to learn which plants you can eat and which...<eos> Which ones we can smoke?<eos> Mr. Jordan, that is precisely why we had to separate you and Mr. Green.

Will he be in my class today?<eos> No.<eos> We're keeping Wells in solitary until launch tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't want him telling the others that the Ark is dying.<eos> Charles...<eos> It's the only thing that makes sense.<eos> Why else would you send kids, and not scientists?<eos> Do you even care if they live or die?
I'm on it.<eos> Hey, Michelin man.<eos> Let's finish this.<eos> Lincoln!<eos> Lincoln, enough!<eos> Stand down.<eos> That's an order!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing? !<eos> It's Creel.<eos> He was trying to assassinate you.
Lincoln, enough!<eos> Stand down.<eos> That's an order!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing? !<eos> It's Creel.<eos> He was trying to assassinate you.<eos> Assassinate me?<eos> He's here to protect me.<eos> His absorbing powers don't seem so impressive now, not with all the inhumans around.<eos> Mr. Creel, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
He's from the streets.<eos> He made some mistakes.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> I believe everyone deserves a second chance, but taking him with us on a covert mission doesn't seem like the place to test it.<eos> It's a crazy world out there, full of powered people.<eos> I finally have one of my own.<eos> I don't leave home without him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> He doesn't go, I don't go.<eos> Fine. We'll go without you.
You're all welcome to believe him, but my reputation speaks for itself.<eos> This is a gel-matrix tank.<eos> Mr. Coulson developed the technology to keep the inhumans in suspended animation, but, in fact, with a mere flick of a switch, from any remote location, he can shut them off, killing them instantly.<eos> I think we've had enough of Mr. Coulson.<eos> Let's lock him up until the officials arrive.<eos> What did he do?<eos> Who does he have?<eos> Talbot!<eos> These are the healthiest we could find.<eos> Lucio has frozen them in place for you.
He's gonna be okay.<eos> He just needs some rest.<eos> He won't remember any of it.<eos> Carla would be very happy to know you made it right.<eos> Well...<eos> I had a little help.<eos> That's what partners are for, you know?<eos> Call me "Glenn."<eos> Occasionally.<eos> I'll leave you alone now.
He's still sedated, but getting treatment.<eos> Any word from Bobbi or Hunter?<eos> Not yet, but I'll keep trying.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> What?<eos> Malick is supposed to be the last head of Hydra, but I can't shake this feeling that he's reporting to someone else.<eos> Someone more powerful than Malick?<eos> Someone or something.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> Coulson didn't sour you, it's still a noble and worthwhile idea, and I'd like to help you any way that I can.
That'll fix you right up.<eos> Well, ain't he thoughtful?<eos> Got a real tight ass on him, too.<eos> Have you noticed?<eos> Reminds me of my second husband.<eos> Mmm. Lucky you.<eos> Look, frankly, I don't know why Mr. Caputo didn't leave me in my assigned bunk.<eos> I would've been perfectly happy there.<eos> Well, I'm sure you would've.<eos> That bunk was a bit... urban for you.
Free haircuts, like at Google.<eos> Housing.<eos> What if we can provide free housing on campus?<eos> I don't know if that would be cost-effective.<eos> It's already there.<eos> We got a bunch of cabins by the lake.<eos> A good coat of paint...<eos> Inmate labor is free.<eos> This is a brilliant idea, Joe, really.<eos> - Thanks to you, Linda.

- You must come with me.<eos> - Where?<eos> America.<eos> Our son needs us.<eos> Welcome home, Ethan.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We're your liberators.<eos> From those Federals who would have hung you from the neck until dead.<eos> You work for my father.<eos> Man wants to see you again.
A tragic end.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> She heard a voice and believed it.<eos> To have belief in anything with such confidence is heroic.<eos> Perhaps if I had more I would have traveled with Nemo.<eos> What happened to him in the book?<eos> I don't remember. He was in a number of the books, actually.<eos> Story has it he died of old age somewhere in a forgotten grotto in the South Pacific.<eos> But I don't believe it.<eos> I think he's still out there. Waiting for you.

Waiting for you.<eos> I'm glad you came today.<eos> I hope my lecture didn't bore you unduly.
It is with you.<eos> Because of your inadequacies, we now hide like slaves.<eos> I have found another way... to return you to your full power.<eos> A remnant of thepithos I once gave you.<eos> I thought it had been destroyed.<eos> Rescued from the debris.<eos> Even a fragment of the box holds enough power to give you what you need.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Who says I'm following you?
Is that a crime, Agent Foster?<eos> No.<eos> But kidnapping is.<eos> As is murder.<eos> As is making an FBI agent mysteriously disappear, creating lots of extra work for everyone in that agent's office.<eos> Okay, I made that last part up.<eos> What were you doing in here?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Not much.<eos> Just heard you muttering.
- I told Reynolds you were a harmless kook, and now you go and...<eos> Agent Foster! What message?<eos> You're paying the security deposit.<eos> Did you see or hear anything?<eos> A weird wind.<eos> Figured you were messing with me.<eos> So this wasn't you?<eos> Then who did this?<eos> Someone who is trying to send us a message.<eos> Though why she would choose to communicate through you is, um...
Sorry.<eos> Can't talk right now, boss.<eos> We're in the belly of the beast.<eos> We'll call you when we land.<eos> Incroyable.<eos> How you are alive, sitting here, is a miracle to me.<eos> You're lucky that your government intervened -- that Interpol was brought in at all.<eos> For something as serious at this?<eos> Three highly decorated members of the Russian government, murdered in cold blood, on Russian soil, by former S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents.<eos> In another time, we would have found you three feet below the ice -- if we found you at all.
I'd be grateful to the people who intervened.<eos> Let's be frank, Matthew.<eos> What matters here is only how things appear.<eos> And for me, this appears to be a disaster.<eos> This incident will go public, and I will have to explain how not one, not two, but three members of my government were murdered.<eos> To be fair... two of them were trying to kill you...sir.<eos> Remind me -- who is this man?<eos> Advisor to our ATCU.<eos> He, uh -- he tracks enhanced threats.<eos> Threats like your very own Minister of Defense, General Androvich, who I believe was trying to assassinate you.

Why can't we hear them?<eos> What happened to the sound?<eos> We have about 90 seconds.<eos> When Fitz triggers the EMP, you'll go out that door to your left.<eos> - There are two guards<eos> - Sir, we can't.<eos> Take them out, then head for the ship --<eos> A distraction won't work here.<eos> We can't risk that.<eos> It'll expose all of you.
I am your neighbor and these are my friends...<eos> I wanted to let you know I put in a bench that I wanted you to come over and enjoy.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm Maria. I'm from...<eos> I live across the street and...<eos> Just... gonna put in a bench.<eos> I think it's helpful for-- Okay, all right.<eos> That's good.<eos> And I just wanna invite you and your family or-
You know why?<eos> Every time I walk into a room,<eos> I know exactly how I would kill each person.<eos> [waiter] Arnold Palmer?<eos> Elbow to forehead, golf pencil through heart.<eos> -He meant the drink.<eos> -Oh.<eos> A fucking beverage. Fuck off, I'm in a meeting.<eos> Look, open-kimono time.<eos> I asked you here 'cause I'm a fan.

-Sidecar.<eos> -[screaming and laughing] -Sidecar.<eos> You are a riot.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> That's our inside joke.<eos> -It's ours.<eos> Okay?<eos> -Okay. -Vespa sidecar's you and me.<eos> -[laughing] Okay.<eos> I adore you.

-I can do that for you.<eos> -[bleating] Exactly, you have a manager. I would never wanna poach you from...<eos> Who are you with?<eos> Bruce Ben-Bacharach.<eos> My manager.<eos> Do me a favor. Don't tell Bruce about this meeting.<eos> -Oh, my gosh.<eos> -He'll get threatened.<eos> I don't have time to walk him off the ledge.<eos> I adore you.
You made the Grish-list.<eos> I'm happy with my representation.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Read the note!<eos> Right.<eos> What-- It's our joke!<eos> It's our private joke.<eos> [both laughing] -It's a Vespa.<eos> -Right.<eos> -It's for you.
Louis is gonna shit.<eos> Welcome to our first annual neighborhood block party and Open Arms, open carry, guns-for-everyone benefit. -[gunshot]<eos> -Oh, God!<eos> Okay.<eos> I just think we could clap instead- [gunshots]<eos> -Oh, God!<eos> Okay.<eos> -[cheering] -There's no need- [gunshot] -[Maria] Oh!<eos> The point is, I am not doing comedy. I am trying to bring people together because you mean so much to me.<eos> And, I really want to be a part of this community, -I love... I love you.
Because we know your client has worked with Brass before.<eos> You got an in.<eos> If he could get Brass to talk, he would be instrumental in taking down a major drug ring.<eos> If I don't?<eos> Then you're free to walk away.<eos> But don't expect to get very far.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> You could call it "work product."<eos> Morgue reports generated by the shooter who attacked you in the hospital.
- How far out?<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> Sending in Grote in five.<eos> This is the frigging wire you want me to wear?<eos> Why don't I just carry a video camera with me and a guy with a boom mic?<eos> Relax, Grotto, you'll be fine.<eos> Look, either you are the luckiest man in Hell's Kitchen, or someone up there thinks you're worth saving.<eos> - I really hope that's true.<eos> - We're all set on our end.<eos> Well, good for you, lady.
Charlie three is set.<eos> Clear fields of fire in sectors one and five.<eos> Over. Charlie four is set.<eos> Clear fields of...<eos> "Fields of fire" doesn't sound like cop talk to me.<eos> That sounds like you're planning an ambush.<eos> Really?<eos> You're using my client as bait for the Punisher?<eos> Probably the first useful thing your client's ever done in his life.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun suing you.
- Can you pass the plate of... - Yeah.<eos> But why didn't you tell us?<eos> The thought of you fighting this alone, all those years...<eos> I didn't want pity.<eos> Is it true that they were arguing?<eos> No, she came down here to be with me.<eos> Of course, we didn't expect that it was gonna be made a public display.<eos> I guess he thought that was the best way to dispel the rumors.<eos> That man does not deserve to be president.<eos> I've never wanted to speak ill of him, Elizabeth, but when I think of the way he's treated you and Claire...
If Jackie gets cold feet, we can't leave her any choice.<eos> I'm already on top of that.<eos> How?<eos> They always use the same hotel.<eos> I've got a guy set up across the street.<eos> I'm assuming you're being careful.<eos> I'm not just a tech outfit.<eos> I can go old school, too.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> We have lunch prepared for you.
You'll be escorted to the rotunda for a photo op with the leadership before going to the holding room.<eos> I don't need to go to the holding room.<eos> You can take me directly to the gallery.<eos> Yes, that's fine.<eos> Whatever the First Lady prefers.<eos> And we'll need two separate motorcades after.<eos> I'll be going straight to the airport.<eos> - Two motorcades, then.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'd like to brief you on the list of special guests attending...
This is a special report.<eos> President Francis Underwood's State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.<eos> Tonight the eyes of the world are on Washington.<eos> President Underwood will take the stage in just a few minutes...<eos> Take the food away.<eos> You didn't eat your lunch, Mrs. Hale.<eos> Yeah, well, I didn't feel well.<eos> Then you really should eat dinner.<eos> Your medication...<eos> Please don't make me ask you again, Michael.
He knows that I know. Not that I have proof.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't have played that card yet.<eos> Remy was connecting the dots.<eos> I needed to put the brakes on him.<eos> Well, if it wasn't him, Doris must've gone to Francis himself.<eos> She saw an opening and...<eos> Ma'am, there's been a change of plans.<eos> Uh, hold on.<eos> What change of plans?<eos> We're taking you back to the White House.
This is not gonna be as difficult as it seems.<eos> Now, Terry's gonna be in touch with Veteran Affairs first thing tomorrow to draft an amendment.<eos> And if the Republicans give us any resistance in committee, I'll start making calls.<eos> No reason why this can't get to the floor before the end of the session.<eos> Well, thank you, Mr. President.<eos> Thank yourself.<eos> You played this well.<eos> How did you play it?<eos> Well, now, that's our little secret, isn't it?<eos> I'll walk you out.
I told him I would think about it.<eos> - So it's over?<eos> - Oh, no, it's not over.<eos> He endorsed Celia on national television.<eos> Forget the 30th. We need to think bigger.<eos> This cycle.<eos> Then we need to talk seriously about my compensation.<eos> - He on? - Yes, sir.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I'll connect you now, sir.
Good evening, Mr. President.<eos> Good morning, Mr. President.<eos> Your speech was good.<eos> Perhaps, a bit too... optimistic, hmm?<eos> I meant what I said about Russia.<eos> It's just words.<eos> They mean very little.<eos> I'm willing to back them up with action.<eos> First, we should talk about a bailout.<eos> I'm willing to work with the IMF to get you what you need.

You can send him to Siberia and let him die of black lung in a coal mine, for all I care. But I do care about your economy.<eos> You keep killing high-profile businessmen and seizing their assets.<eos> - That's no... - You mean, traitors?<eos> Look, I am aware that they were plotting a coup, but that still doesn't...<eos> Yes, because you orchestrated it.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Why else would Milkin fly to America?<eos> We had nothing to do with this.<eos> You... you lied to me about the Jordan Valley, you lied to me about Corrigan.<eos> I am not trying to replace you, Viktor.
That all of you matter.<eos> And I don't just say that because African Americans represent half the vote in this state.<eos> I say that because, despite our troubles... we are one community.<eos> One family.<eos> - And that gives us strength.<eos> - That strength is a powerful thing.<eos> It's not invisible.<eos> It radiates.<eos> I place my faith in God to give me purpose.<eos> I put my hope in you to give me strength. Yes, sir.
Well, you'll have time.<eos> I have two hours of fundraising calls to make.<eos> It was very nice of you to let us stay at your house, Mr. President.<eos> Well, that's how we do things here in Gaffney. Sir?<eos> Listen, I am not gonna negotiate a bailout if he won't budge on privatization.<eos> If he wants to let his own people starve, so be it.<eos> He may look for relief from Beijing, and that would--<eos> The only thing he hates more than us is China. He won't kowtow.<eos> But if Petrov does cave to them, that puts the global energy--<eos> Look, Cathy, I have to call you back. -When?
But if Petrov does cave to them, that puts the global energy--<eos> Look, Cathy, I have to call you back. -When?<eos> -About 30 minutes ago.<eos> -So this will be your box, number 433.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Would you like to open up a savings account with us?<eos> -Debit card? -No, the box is fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> -Would you mind if I... -Oh, sure.<eos> I'll give you some privacy.
I know about you.<eos> I seen your parole officer come check in on you.<eos> What would he say about you taking one of these cars?<eos> Come on.<eos> Get in.<eos> I just learned today that Limestone College, founded in 1845, was the first women's college in South Carolina, and one of the first in the nation.<eos> And that's something to be proud of.<eos> And since then, this school and its students have flourished.<eos> A young, eager community of men and women of all races and backgrounds, a true reflection of America's future.<eos> How did he convince you to come back?
-Um, who are you?<eos> -Sorry.<eos> Mark from the Butler County office.<eos> They want all the Cincinnati volunteers to gather by the bus for a photo with Dunbar.<eos> Jenn told me I wasn't supposed to leave--<eos> That's why she sent me.<eos> She didn't want you to miss the photo.<eos> Go.<eos> Out by the bus?<eos> She told me to cover for you.
Aren't you breaking WITSEC protocol by being here?<eos> I am no longer comfortable with this.<eos> - You're... you're my last chance. Please! - Hey, hey.<eos> -I suggest that you go back home.<eos> -I'm... The things I've--<eos> -Don't make us get security involved. -Please.<eos> Just-- Just give us five minutes until she's out of the building.<eos> Please.<eos> Please listen to me. I'm...<eos> I'm begging you.
I'll be down here whenever you need me.<eos> Oh, it's not the when, it's the what.<eos> And how much.<eos> Afternoon, Oren.<eos> -Mr. President.<eos> -Have a seat.<eos> Didn't you learn your lesson with all that Peachoid nonsense?<eos> Well, you promised to help me with the 4th.<eos> I let my bitterness get the better of me.<eos> Who specifically approached you?
Now, at the time, the owner of the Gaffney First Bank was a member of the Klan. Some of you know that.<eos> And he would do whatever the Klan told him to do, and my father knew that.<eos> So my father did what he had to do.<eos> He went to a meeting and begged the leader of that chapter to talk to the owner of the bank.<eos> And at that meeting, that's when that photograph was taken.<eos> The only reason he was there was to try to save our farm.<eos> Now, Calvin Underwood hated himself for going to that meeting.<eos> He hated himself for taking that photograph.<eos> But he would've hated himself even more if he'd lost our farm... if he hadn't been able to provide and support his family.<eos> Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you to forgive him being in that photograph.

No, it's gotta be more than money.<eos> She wants coattails.<eos> We swap Claire's for mine.<eos> - Campaign manager?<eos> - We could use some fresh blood.<eos> That I agree with, but LeAnn?<eos> I mean, there's no guarantee that we can control her.<eos> Yeah, but if she can convince Claire to change her mind, that's all I need.<eos> Yes.<eos> They're ready for you in the Situation Room, sir.
- You lose every key demo.<eos> - We're well aware.<eos> But if the president makes Claire his running mate, it makes the conversation tactical instead of economic.<eos> That buys you time on the Russia crisis.<eos> You solve that, confidence in the president translates into confidence in his choice--<eos> I didn't call you to be convinced.<eos> I called to offer you a job.<eos> - Only to get to Mrs. Underwood.<eos> - This isn't just about her.<eos> We need you.
The agent in charge of the operation got a promotion directly after.<eos> - Listen--<eos> - Martha, if the president, or one of his staff...<eos> If anyone strong-armed the bureau into pursuing Lucas Goodwin, then you know that's an abuse of power.<eos> I work for the president. I am about to sit down with his Chief of Staff.<eos> - The law is the law.<eos> - This is politics, not the law.<eos> Not true.<eos> You brought me on as solicitor general because of my integrity.<eos> I am bringing this to you because of yours.
- What was that?<eos> - My mother... killing a lizard.<eos> - I'll get the door for you, ma'am.<eos> - I can open the door myself.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> There's blood on the floor.<eos> I want you to take this to the president, in person.<eos> - Try to get on a plane tonight if you can.<eos> - Of course.<eos> This one's for you.
- Before she gets to the airport?<eos> No, I mean Claire.<eos> You asked for me, sir?<eos> Come in.<eos> Both the cell and the landline--<eos> We're on lockdown, ma'am.<eos> We had to scramble all the--<eos> Lockdown?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm gonna need you to stay in the house.
- That would draw attention.<eos> Relax. Everything's been worked out.<eos> You're in good hands.<eos> Here, get some sleep.<eos> It's gonna be a long trip tonight.<eos> Blunderwood!<eos> Blunderwood!<eos> - Any news?<eos> - Everything's secure, sir.<eos> We love you, Underwood!
I appreciate the call, Mr. Vice President, but I'm sure you've got a lot to take care of right now.<eos> - Is there anything I can do to help you?<eos> - I'll be making a brief appearance once we have a better sense of... where things stand.<eos> Would you like me to be there?<eos> I think it would be good, the country seeing the First Lady.<eos> I think it's more important that they see your steady hand.<eos> If you're by my side, it would certainly make it steadier.<eos> Of course.<eos> Anything you ask.<eos> I'm gonna be praying for you.

- Mrs. Underwood.<eos> - How is he?<eos> They're still in the OR.<eos> Probably a few hours left to go.<eos> Is he going to live?<eos> He took a direct hit to his liver, which is partially shattered.<eos> Fortunately, part of the left lobe is mostly intact.<eos> Now, we think there's a decent chance he will survive surgery, but even if he does, that's when the real fight begins.<eos> I'd like to see him.<eos> As soon as he's out, I'll make sure you know.
Good night.<eos> Francis, can you hear me?<eos> Francis.<eos> I just spoke to Eddie's parents, ma'am.<eos> You said you wanted to call them?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Edward was more than a hero, Mrs. Meechum.<eos> He was our friend.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Please, let me know if there's anything I can do for you and your family.
Ma'am... as far as threats go, we've been far more occupied with you lately.<eos> I'm hoping that we can work together, because I need your help.<eos> - How?<eos> - The vice president.<eos> We spoke. I told him I would appear with him.<eos> Not the statement.<eos> He's having trouble making a decision.<eos> Can you come back to the White House with me?<eos> It's serious, ma'am.<eos> I can fill you in on the way.
Is that what you're doing?<eos> I can help.<eos> Was hoping you would.<eos> Oh, you're doing this wrong.<eos> I mean, you're looking in the wrong place.<eos> So, uh... this Blake guy... he has safehouses, what, all over?<eos> All agents do.<eos> We'll just have to keep checking his until we find something.<eos> So, what did it say... on my evaluation?<eos> Nothing that'll surprise you.
You can't just be at S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You have to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And I'm trying to be, but you don't make it easy.<eos> There's a test at every turn.<eos> I mean, this is a test.<eos> This is a chance for me to see for myself how you handle things.<eos> Same thing, different words...<eos> Don't interrupt me!<eos> You haven't earned that right yet.<eos> I don't know you.

Fitz...<eos> It's working!<eos> I'm turning you over to the ATCU.<eos> I have a feeling General Talbot will have some questions for you.<eos> You knew he wasn't really here.<eos> Yeah, he wasn't moving much.<eos> There was also a lag.<eos> Blake usually interrupts you a lot more.<eos> I also know that wasn't a kill shot.<eos> I saw you with Lash.
We're expecting a boy. Where is he?<eos> - Must've been a mix-up.<eos> - We asked for a boy.<eos> - Maybe they're fresh out.<eos> - Edmond, please.<eos> Are you Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> How do you do?<eos> My name is Anne Shirley.<eos> And this is for you.
A lively young girl like you should be living with a proper family, and going to school.<eos> So I have asked Children's Services to look out for a good home for you.<eos> One that has children your own age.<eos> But in the meantime...<eos> I can stay?<eos> Well, yes, but it's only temporary.<eos> Miss Cuthbert, I promise to be the best orphan you could ever hope for.<eos> Boy or girl.<eos> I'll help with the chores and I'll try my best not to talk too much and I'll try my absolute hardest not to allow my imagination run away.<eos> What should I call you?
But you could imagine you're my aunt.<eos> No, I couldn't.<eos> Don't you ever imagine things different from the way they are?<eos> No, never.<eos> And Marilla will do just fine.<eos> Marilla.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> I believe it's short for Amaryllis.<eos> That is such a beautiful name.<eos> Your mother and father must have loved you very much.
May I put them in water?<eos> Anne, this my neighbor and my good friend, Mrs. Lynde.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Well, she's not much to look at.<eos> Scrawny.<eos> Raspberry jam hair.<eos> My word, would you look at those freckles.<eos> My dear, what an odd look.<eos> What could it mean?<eos> It means I hate you.
My dear, what an odd look.<eos> What could it mean?<eos> It means I hate you.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Anne!<eos> Anne!<eos> Anne, come back in here!<eos> Yes?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said, I hate you.
Etcetera etcetera.<eos> Marilla found these for you.<eos> They're lovely.<eos> Not new but almost.<eos> She thought one of them might suit for church today. ...and you can wear the others to school.<eos> I'm going to school?<eos> Marilla's having one of her aches in the old noggin.<eos> Dear. Is there anything I can do?<eos> It would make her happy if you liked these dresses.<eos> Do you?
You got a better word for it?<eos> Grace, I'm gonna level with you.<eos> Nobody wants your case.<eos> I drew it because I'm low man on the totem pole in a place where seniority means everything.<eos> If, for whatever reason, you're not happy with me, you're on your own.<eos> You're free to hire your own attorney out of your own pocket.<eos> Educational law isn't exactly a common specialty.<eos> So, what's the good news?<eos> I don't like to lose.<eos> And I'm willing to fight for you.
So, what's the good news?<eos> I don't like to lose.<eos> And I'm willing to fight for you.<eos> Are you a believer?<eos> You mean a Christian?<eos> No, but I think that's an advantage.<eos> Why?<eos> You're passionate about what you believe.<eos> I mean, let's face it, it's why you're in trouble in the first place.<eos> But it blinds you to the realities of procedure.
Ms. Wesley is an employee of the school board.<eos> We win in court and we establish her misconduct as said paid employee, well, there's nothing that changes policy faster than a big, expensive settlement.<eos> We're going to prove once and for all that God is dead.<eos> Brooke is a minor.<eos> As far as the court is concerned, she has no rights.<eos> That simply means I won't be asking her to be a witness.<eos> I feel supremely confident about this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Injunctive relief?<eos> They're asking that you be fired, plus revocation of your teaching certificate.
I don't mean to offend anyone who may be a Muslim here, and I do not want to slight the prophet of Islam, but if you were to ask me a question concerning the Quran, the sacred text of Islam,<eos> and I could come up with the answer with great speed and accuracy, and I could quote the proper surah, or chapter, then it would be reasonable for you to infer that I was not only a follower of Islam,<eos> If I did this in a house of worship, that would be fine.<eos> But if I did it in an 11th grade classroom in a public school, that would be preaching, not teaching.<eos> So, why?<eos> Why in the world are we here today?<eos> Because Ms. Wesley refused to apologize, and that means that her true motivation in that moment in her classroom was to take an innocent question and turn it into an opportunity to preach, not teach.<eos> If we grant Ms. Wesley the right to do that, and by extension, everyone else, to violate the law based solely on our own private beliefs, then our society will crumble.<eos> I believe that.<eos> So, I implore you, please do not set this precedent.
- Cumulative.<eos> The question has effectively been asked and answered.<eos> Your Honor, Mrs. Rizzo's sworn testimony states that Ms. Wesley talked about her faith all the time, yet she's failed to cite a single instance.<eos> I'm merely trying to discover some basis for her opinion. Sustained.<eos> Mr. Endler, we're done with this line of questioning.<eos> Mrs. Rizzo, in the school's initial inquiry into this matter, you were Ms. Wesley's representative on behalf of the teacher's union, were you not?<eos> Yes. And did you ever consider that your disapproval of her faith might taint your ability to represent her properly?<eos> Objection, speculative.<eos> Sustained.<eos> God bless you.
Mr. Endler, you seem to have a penchant for injecting commentary where it doesn't belong.<eos> You would do well to avoid further provocation of this court.<eos> I apologize, Your Honor.<eos> I'll look to curtail it in the future.<eos> Redirect, Your Honor?<eos> Ms. Kinney, I understand that you attended a service at Ms. Wesley's church a short while ago.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes, that's correct.<eos> It was an event honoring several students who attend that church for their community service.<eos> Mm-hmm. And who was it that invited you to that service?
On school grounds?<eos> Yes.<eos> During work hours?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, one last question. Is it true that Ms. Wesley accepts donations for a faith-based charity, Convoy of Hope, right there in the classroom?<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> Thank you again. No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> You may step down, Mrs. Kinney.<eos> Court's adjourned.<eos> Grace, can I ask you a question, off the record?

No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> You may step down, Mrs. Kinney.<eos> Court's adjourned.<eos> Grace, can I ask you a question, off the record?<eos> Sure.<eos> These people, they're looking to destroy you, and I don't just mean financially.
Sure.<eos> These people, they're looking to destroy you, and I don't just mean financially.<eos> Do you think it's worth it?<eos> I hope so.<eos> So do I.<eos> Fishy and cheesy at the same time. David, this tuna melt is exquisite.<eos> Oh, yeah, exquisite.<eos> It's the provolone. That was my idea.<eos> I love what it does to the flavor of the fish.<eos> Don't I know you?
Does Walter want to join us?<eos> Oh, no. He's hiding in his room.<eos> How come?<eos> He's treating this like it's a date, which should give you some indication of what my social life is like.<eos> Don't worry, I won't tell.<eos> Falls under attorney-client privilege.<eos> So, is this what you always saw yourself doing, the lawyer thing?<eos> No, um...<eos> How 'bout you?<eos> Your parents have you all set to go to the convent?
So, wouldn't this tend to inflate your estimate of the probability that Jesus existed.<eos> No, because we don't need to inflate it.<eos> We can reconstruct the basic facts about Jesus just from non-Christian sources outside the Bible.<eos> And Gerd Ludemann is an atheist.<eos> In other words, we can prove the existence of Jesus solely by using sources that have absolutely no sympathy toward Christianity.<eos> As the agnostic historian, Bart Ehrman, says,<eos> "Jesus did exist, whether we like it or not."<eos> I put it this way:<eos> Denying the existence of Jesus doesn't make him go away.<eos> It merely proves that no amount of evidence will convince you.
Brooke, in class, who first brought up the name "Jesus,"<eos> you or Ms. Wesley?<eos> I did.<eos> As part of a question?<eos> Yes.<eos> And at that time, did you feel like you were asking a faith-based question?<eos> No, not really. It just seemed like Martin Luther King and Jesus were saying similar things, so I brought it up.<eos> And did you consider Ms. Wesley's response to be a reasonable answer to your question?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you asked a question in history class about a historical figure, and your history teacher answered it in a sensible manner?
Mm.<eos> I asked her how she kept it all together so well, and she said, "Jesus."<eos> So, she's the one who brought up Jesus?<eos> Did her endorsement of Jesus move you to explore Christianity?<eos> Yes, at first. But when the Salvation Army came to pick up my brother's things, one of the ladies found his Bible, and she gave it to me.<eos> I didn't even know that he had one.<eos> Mm. So, I started reading it, and once I started,<eos> I realized that I didn't wanna stop.<eos> That's why. That's why I came up with the question that I asked in class.<eos> Now, if I understand you correctly, without Ms. Wesley's direct involvement, you never would've asked that question in the first place, would you?
Do I have to?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Your Honor, given the witness's reluctance to testify, can I have the court's permission to treat her as a hostile witness?<eos> You may.<eos> Proceed at your own peril.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> Grace, I want you to do something for me, something for everyone in this courtroom.<eos> I want you to apologize.
Grace, is there some truth that you know that no one else knows?<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> The other night, didn't you tell me that Jesus spoke to you personally?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm the one asking the questions, Ms. Wesley.<eos> Did you or did you not tell me that Jesus spoke to you personally?<eos> Yes.<eos> And what did he say?<eos> I'll make it easier for you.<eos> Didn't you say that he asked you a question?
In the name of tolerance and diversity, I say we destroy her.<eos> That's enough, Mr. Endler.<eos> Then we can all go to our graves content, knowing that we stomped out the last spark of faith that was ever exhibited in the public square.<eos> That's enough, Mr. Endler.<eos> I say we make an example of her. Mr. Endler, that's enough.<eos> Let's set a new precedent, that employment by our federal government mandates that you must first denounce any belief system you have.<eos> Mr. Endler that is enough! You are out of order. And if someone slips through the cracks and hides their beliefs, then we arrest them and fine them.<eos> And if they don't pay, then we seize their property.<eos> And if they resist... Well, let's not kid ourselves. Enforcement is always at the end of a gun.<eos> Mr. Endler, you are out of order. I charge you with contempt!
If we're going to insist that a Christian's right to believe is subordinate to all other rights, then it's not a right.<eos> Somebody is always going to be offended.<eos> Two thousand years of human history proves that.<eos> So, I say we get on with it.<eos> Cite the law, charge the jury, and send them off to deliberate.<eos> So be it!<eos> Now, we are gonna bypass the usual closing arguments, unless Mr. Kane finds the need to further address the jury.<eos> No, Your Honor.<eos> We can ask nothing more.<eos> My instructions to you are simple.

I-I just need to keep the customers I got.<eos> Now, take it.<eos> Daisy, help.<eos> Save me, please.<eos> So sorry.<eos> We're running out of time, Daisy.<eos> This is where I die.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Please calm down.<eos> I'm having a hard time understanding you.
- I-I saw this.<eos> - You saw what?<eos> This moment -- talking to you, the -- the cops -- all of it.<eos> I'm - - I'm sorry. I'm not following.<eos> Charles, the crazy homeless guy who lives in the alley -- he -- he -- he put -- must have put a curse on me or something.<eos> He made me see...this.<eos> I-I saw this.<eos> I'm gonna go check it out.<eos> You got to get me out of here before they come and kill me.<eos> We will protect you.
We will protect you.<eos> But how did you know that it was Hydra who's coming?<eos> Because that's what she'll yell when they come out of the sky.<eos> Hydra!<eos> Get down.<eos> Go!<eos> Help!<eos> Save me, please!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll get you out of this.
I'm sorry.<eos> We lost one.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What is it?<eos> It hasn't happened yet.<eos> He is risen!<eos> What an improvement.<eos> Last time I saw you, you looked like an extra from "Dawn of the Dead."
To what do we owe - this miraculous turnaround?<eos> To your patience.<eos> A thank-you is overdue... for bringing me back.<eos> Well, I didn't exactly move Heaven and Earth, uh, but I did move a lot of earth -- money, manpower -- anything to make it happen.<eos> I'd like to know why.<eos> Why?<eos> Meaning, to what end?<eos> Why?<eos> I, uh...<eos> My family, my ancestors were taught to believe that if we managed to return you from that godforsaken place that we would be rewarded.

That's him.<eos> Charles Hinton.<eos> Last known address...<eos> Sadly, it looks like Charles did not live alone.<eos> Send a team.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I wouldn't worry about me, sir.<eos> You should worry about yourself.<eos> Because Daisy saw me shoot her?<eos> Because I'd kill you if you did.
I'm willing to put that to the test.<eos> And test Fitz's theory that all this will play out just as you envisioned?<eos> Everyone else stays back to make sure we're still altering the end.<eos> You, Lincoln -- no one leaves H.Q.<eos> Coulson, I can do this.<eos> I am meant to save this man.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Let me go.<eos> The assault team will remain on the Quinjet unless needed.<eos> Fitz will tap the Transia building's security feeds to get eyes on you.
Hydra's already taking Charles there now.<eos> Get moving.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Find Grant Ward.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Day got weirder.<eos> They've breached the security office.<eos> Mr. Malick is taking the company's helicopter, but I'd rather sneak you out another way if S.H.I.E.L.D. is present.
All units, stop!<eos> Do not pursue!<eos> Lincoln, where are you?<eos> I have eyes on Ward.<eos> Do not engage.<eos> I repeat -- do not engage.<eos> Lincoln, we don't know what we're dealing with here.<eos> Pull out.<eos> It's time to say goodbye.<eos> I was sure I could save you.
I was hoping you could help.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll protect her, I promise always.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> I want you to go there.<eos> Is that where they manufacture the Exo-Skeleton hardware?<eos> That's not the technology we are interested in.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I shouldn't have to remind you that you work for me.
As Genghis said,<eos> "Find me a man that doesn't drink, and that man will lead my armies."<eos> Are you following Genghis or running from your father?<eos> Would it help you if I told you this wasn't wine but the blood of Christ?<eos> All the more reason for me to respectfully abstain.<eos> It is difficult for the faithless to understand the faithful.<eos> I have faith, Nayan.<eos> In the sun, in the sky, in the animals I roast.<eos> My children.<eos> And who do you think created all those things you speak of?
They found his body the other night. Near the river.<eos> The whole of your army can be here within a week.<eos> Unless Kaidu has a death wish, he will surrender Jingim and Ahmad.<eos> The Goyo plant.<eos> It grows heavily in this region.<eos> More enemies have fallen to its poison than any sword.<eos> Pick some for Kaidu.<eos> Where are my sons?<eos> They are not in the capital.<eos> Search all you like.
You're not nearly as thick as most people say.<eos> Thick... does that mean stupid?<eos> Is that your son?<eos> He looks like you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Trained by League of Assassins, sneaking up on people is kind of our thing.<eos> I'd like to be alone for a moment.<eos> You don't actually have a plan, do you?<eos> And that speech wasn't about convincing us.<eos> It was about convincing you.
- Will you give us a moment?<eos> - Gareeb?<eos> It's a legend passed down for 4,000 years.<eos> When my master was first bestowed the gift of eternal life, an enemy tried to kill him.<eos> Every myth has its monster, its devil.<eos> For those of our order, it's him, the Gareeb.<eos> I'd stop talking now if I were you, mate.<eos> If I were you, I'd run.<eos> Your friend has already failed to kill my master once.<eos> He won't be able to protect you.
No, if you want us to do this...<eos> Yes, okay!<eos> Yes, I-I had the chance to kill Savage once before.<eos> I had him dead to rights and I hesitated.<eos> Get off me!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you, Gareeb?<eos> Killing is never easy, especially for a good man.<eos> But the man killed my wife and son and God knows how many other wives and sons, and yet I couldn't...<eos> Your killing people doesn't make you a monster, Sara, but having the chance to avenge your family and not taking it... that does.
Let's get out of here.<eos> Maybe we should have had Blake show us around.<eos> Perhaps there's a less conspicuous way for us to do reconnaissance.<eos> May I?<eos> I'm not much of a dancer.<eos> I'll lead, then.<eos> Well, for a monster, you dance quite gracefully, Ms. Lance.<eos> - Don't make fun.<eos> - I know, I'm not.<eos> Nor do I consider you a monster.
Gideon, search "Greyhill Building."<eos> I've already searched for it on behalf of the Captain, who's there now with Ms. Lance.<eos> What?<eos> They left without us?<eos> It's a mansion several miles away.<eos> Apparently, there's some sort of private event.<eos> How the hell could Kendra know that they're there?<eos> You have to save them!<eos> - What's going on? - I don't know!<eos> When we first met, I asked you who you were.
Oh, she is lovely.<eos> The boy has your eyes.<eos> I'll be sure to keep their picture close.<eos> I don't remember killing them... yet.<eos> It seems like I have a lot to look forward to.<eos> Gideon, get me Jefferson.<eos> Mr. Jackson is not aboard.<eos> Oh, don't tell me...<eos> He's with Mr. Snart and Mr. Rory on the Jumpship.<eos> I'm patching you through.
What are you asking me to believe?<eos> That I'm a reincarnation of your witch friend?<eos> That you are hunted by vampires?<eos> That you commune with Satan?<eos> Which part do you want me to believe?<eos> I believe all of it. No.<eos> You believe I believe it.<eos> There's no difference to me.<eos> Sit down, Vanessa, please.<eos> Such a subject I am for you.
Miss Ives!<eos> Release my hand!<eos> Through your skin... to your bones... crawling like the scorpion... up, reaching.<eos> You have a scar on the back of your neck.<eos> Blood!<eos> There are tram cars outside the window.<eos> A city!<eos> More blood!<eos> You were hurt by a man.<eos> He would have killed you...
Well, I'm in mind to try new things these days.<eos> Adventuring with Captain Nemo?<eos> Not battling sea creatures or sinking frigates, exactly, but still... New horizons.<eos> I had a wife, you see.<eos> She passed away just over a year ago.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - Thank you.<eos> So, I'm just finding my feet again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.<eos> I want you to know... When I saw you at the lecture, I thought of her.
I don't think you do.<eos> Hypnotism is a very new therapeutic tool.<eos> It can be effective, but it can also be extremely traumatic.<eos> Can I be more traumatized?<eos> You absurd woman.<eos> Vanessa, hold on.<eos> Why do you think he was talking about the Banning Clinic?<eos> The white room with no day or night can only be one place.<eos> The cell I was kept in.<eos> According to the records, Dr. Banning attempted to treat you with hydrotherapy and psychotropic drugs.
According to the records, Dr. Banning attempted to treat you with hydrotherapy and psychotropic drugs.<eos> He tortured me.<eos> He also performed brain surgery.<eos> You were trephined. This has to be the room where I met the Master in the past!<eos> Help me.<eos> Uncovered memories are sometimes suppressed for a reason.<eos> The mind protects itself from what it doesn't want to know, the castle pulling up the drawbridge.<eos> We would be lowering the bridge.<eos> Anything.<eos> The emotions can be very raw, I'm warning you.
Uncovered memories are sometimes suppressed for a reason.<eos> The mind protects itself from what it doesn't want to know, the castle pulling up the drawbridge.<eos> We would be lowering the bridge.<eos> Anything.<eos> The emotions can be very raw, I'm warning you.<eos> You're willing to give yourself over to this, - no matter what may come...<eos> - Now.<eos> It's not like the music hall acts.<eos> Not everyone can be hypnotized and you still have full free will.<eos> I can't make you do anything... nor will you behave in any way outside your character.
- Yes, we can. That's what I'm talking about. We put on fancy clothes, and we just go and...<eos> Lie our ass off? I was gonna say sell.<eos> These guys... they don't they don't buy shows.<eos> They buy the people behind the shows, so we're selling ourselves.<eos> Let's go.<eos> John Booth?<eos> Coleman Wasserman. I'm the showrunner at "Everlasting."<eos> This is my producing partner, Rachel Goldberg. Hi.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I've got a question for you.
No, no, no, no, no. It's explosive, timely.<eos> This kind of stuff matters.<eos> You see, to me, television is a land rush, and I'm looking for pioneers who aren't afraid to go out into the wilderness, stake a claim to a new piece of territory, and then bring in the masses.<eos> If you're looking for pioneers, why are you talking to them?<eos> By the time they came to town, the whorehouse had a bidet, and the saloon had recessed lighting.<eos> John Booth, Quinn King.<eos> Well, well, it's true.<eos> You do fill a room.<eos> Oh, is that what these two have been saying about me?<eos> Oh, actually, they haven't mentioned you once.
On the contrary.<eos> Everyone here knows that you're the true creator of "Everlasting,"<eos> and in a roomful of legends, you're a legend.<eos> I can't believe she just showed up here. Ah.<eos> Ah, we impressed him earlier. Don't undo all of that good work by...<eos> I literally want to stab her in the eyes with lobster forks.<eos> Doing something like that. Just relax and have a drink.<eos> Come on. - Excuse me.<eos> - Yes. Two champagnes.<eos> Well, I hope my trolls didn't harass you.
What is this?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No.<eos> What the hell are you people doing? This is pornography.<eos> We're never gonna air any of this.<eos> - I mean, there's always a chance.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - How do I get these things off? - Where's my daughter?<eos> Tell me now, or I call the police.<eos> Okay, calm down, Dr. Carter. I'll take you to her right away, okay?
Trampolines?<eos> Slo-mo boobs?<eos> How old are you? Such a thing called testosterone, Quinn.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> Medic!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Don't move her, don't move her!<eos> We got to do a concussion protocol.<eos> How could you do that?
Kind of looks like our freak show is turning into a love fest.<eos> I mean, that bikini didn't come out of nowhere.<eos> Where's the drunk uncle? Where's the KKK?<eos> I cannot believe I'm meeting Darius Beck.<eos> We're pleased at all get out to have you in our home.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The pleasure's all mine. Carl.<eos> You know... Beth Ann, she just says the nicest things about you.<eos> - Okay, Daddy. She's sweet.<eos> You know, we got something out back here for you to show you a real Alabama welcome.
Look, Quinn, I'm...<eos> I'm really sorry. I tried, but...<eos> So it's over?<eos> Well... it was only a matter of time.<eos> At least we went out with a bang, huh?<eos> Guys, uh, Jeremy has something to tell you. Um... you don't ever have to worry about them again.<eos> I told you I'd do anything.<eos> Emergency crews are on the scene of a single-car accident at Baywood Canyon Road.<eos> There are no reports yet on the condition of the occupants.<eos> We will be updating you with more details as they become available.
You know, you want to know why I brought Adam here?<eos> Because his social-media buzz is off the charts. Oh, I don't even care, actually.<eos> He was a ratings dynamo last year.<eos> No, he was the pussy who got left at the altar last year.<eos> He's a catch who had the misfortune of falling for a heartless bitch.<eos> I mean, every woman in America wants to screw the sadness out of him. Every woman in my office, certainly.<eos> The guy's a knicker-dropper.<eos> Yeah, hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's nice to see you again.
That's everything we want to do, and we're ta...<eos> - Hey, Rachel.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't know you guys were having a meeting.<eos> No, uh, I just wanted to hear some of Coleman's ideas for new projects.<eos> His ideas?<eos> Well, that's so exciting.<eos> But he couldn't stop talking about his producing partner. Hmm.<eos> It appears you are a valuable asset.<eos> Must be why no one wants to let you go.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Malick is supposed to be the last head of Hydra, but I can't shake this feeling that he's reporting to someone else.<eos> Was that Ward? Unfortunately...<eos> I think that's something else. My ancestors were taught to believe that if we managed to return you from that godforsaken place that we would be rewarded.
They floated.<eos> Giyera.<eos> I always loved this place.<eos> My brother and I used to play here as kids.<eos> Gideon, your daughter impresses me.<eos> She's a true believer.<eos> Well, I tried to raise her right, same as my Dad raised me.<eos> She'll play a key role in this.<eos> Well, I'm happy to hear it.<eos> How fortunate it was for all of us that I was able to find you and bring you home.
I know all you've ever wanted is to be like us, so I thought I'd put that offer on the table.<eos> You should've opened with that.<eos> Looks like the data was uploaded off-site before it was wiped. Work with Fitz.<eos> See if you can trace where it was sent.<eos> And gather what's left of these experiments for Simmons.<eos> Maybe she can figure out what the hell they were working on here.<eos> Sir, Giyera's coming your way. Copy that.<eos> Not so fun when we take away your toys, is it?<eos> So we're doing this the hard way?<eos> I don't usually like getting my hands dirty, but for you, I'll make an exception.
A parasite that retains the memories of the body he took over.<eos> Sounds even worse when you say it like that.<eos> Is there something wrong, sir?<eos> You were there.<eos> "We do what we have to do."<eos> That's your words.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that's what I've been telling myself.<eos> And now you don't believe that that's true?<eos> It was true for you.
Double or nothing says I put this punk on the pinewood.<eos> Yeah, I'll take a piece of that action.<eos> We got the file.<eos> Okay, now for the tricky part.<eos> All personnel are subject to search upon exiting the Pentagon.<eos> Firestorm will divert the power long enough for you to exit.<eos> Ready when you are.<eos> All clear.<eos> What did you do, Jefferson?<eos> I warned you about the electromagnetic pulse.
The Russian jet damaged his ship.<eos> He's still alive?<eos> He went down just outside Moscow city limits.<eos> Mr. Rory, how would you like to accompany me on a little mission?<eos> Will I get to use my gun? A near-certain likelihood.<eos> Lead the way, Captain.<eos> You struck out, Raymond.<eos> Maybe I should take a crack at her.<eos> I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot.<eos> - I don't mean to bother you... - Too late.
Maybe I should take a crack at her.<eos> I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot.<eos> - I don't mean to bother you... - Too late.<eos> But, as an investor, I'm in a position to fund your research.<eos> That is why I wanted us to meet.<eos> Easy, Raymond, you're gonna spook her.<eos> I think it's important to know who's funding your research, don't you think?<eos> For instance...<eos> Project Svarog.<eos> Sorry, is this man bothering you?
Can I waste this guy?<eos> Could you give us a moment?<eos> You said I'd get to use my gun.<eos> What a colorful team you've assembled for yourself.<eos> I thought that you were...<eos> Chronos?<eos> He was killed in the crash, I'm afraid.<eos> I was sent to scuttle his time ship, lest it be discovered by the Soviets.<eos> And you left a temporal anomaly.<eos> To lure you out of the cold, as it were.
I was sent to scuttle his time ship, lest it be discovered by the Soviets.<eos> And you left a temporal anomaly.<eos> To lure you out of the cold, as it were.<eos> You've turned your back on the very institution you were meant to serve.<eos> Our job is to protect time, thereby protecting all life.<eos> I am trying to save the world from complete destruction.<eos> You and your band of rogues have run rampant throughout history.<eos> This is why we work alone, Rip.<eos> A team is a liability you've proven that.<eos> They keep you from making the tough choices.
But they still haven't changed their mind about stopping Savage?<eos> Well, according to them, he's part of the natural course of history, terrible as that course may be.<eos> Look, I'm not saying that this offer is without its downsides.<eos> If we abandon our plan now, then I still lose my wife and son.<eos> So why throw in the towel?<eos> I thought you said this mission was bigger than any one of us.<eos> Yes, but if you'll remember, when I first recruited you, I wasn't entirely forthright about my motivations or about how dangerous this mission would be.<eos> Carter Hall knew the risks before he signed on.<eos> Well, for the rest of you, it's now time to decide whether the future is worth fighting for.<eos> I cannot tell you how pleased I am to see you, Hunter.
All will soon be made right again.<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> I'm so sorry it had to turn out this way, but the council cannot risk keeping you alive.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> I won't be able to tell Mick he was right. Mick?<eos> My colorful friend, who was convinced you were planning on killing me.<eos> Your friends seem to have abandoned you, but no matter.<eos> Chronos will track them down.<eos> Can't believe you brought this stooge to do your dirty work.<eos> I never had you pegged as a coward, Druce.
Oh, gentlemen, I trust everything went according to plan at the Bolshoi?<eos> Piece of cake.<eos> Made contact with Vostok and swiped her badge.<eos> Thanks to me.<eos> Pretty boy just froze his ass off.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Chronos.<eos> - Jax here was...<eos> - Almost got himself killed.<eos> And we need to get you to the med bay.
Oh, my God.<eos> I know what Vostok is working on.<eos> She's trying to build... me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, Savage has spent the last decade trying to level the arms race against our team.<eos> Operation Svarog.<eos> Slavic God of fire, of course.<eos> He and Vostok are building a Soviet Firestorm.<eos> They've already built a thermal core.<eos> Professor, need I remind you, this is a reconnaissance mission.
Now, it's my turn.<eos> No!<eos> He's too weak.<eos> He'll never get out of there alone.<eos> Professor Stein, your comrade here tells me you know quite a bit about this project of mine.<eos> Very good.<eos> You and I have much to discuss.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You forget how to use that thing?<eos> My employer, Mr. Savage, would very much like to meet you and the rest of your friends.
What did you think would happen?<eos> You don't understand what it's like to be brought up in faith.<eos> We were "C and E" Catholics.<eos> Sure, it's no death cult.<eos> Then you know we all have our sins.<eos> I believed that I could resurrect a god.<eos> But instead, I freed the Devil.<eos> Only technically.<eos> I mean, all the ancient Satanic creation myths -- they were based on him, which you knew.<eos> The Devil promises everything and then lets you destroy your own world.
There's a situation, Daisy.<eos> I need you to get your team to cooperate.<eos> Were we attacked?<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> I just need you to stay right where you are.<eos> May...be cool.<eos> Where's Joey?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Coulson, you need to level with me right now.<eos> We need to get you checked out.
Good.<eos> Because I think I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> I know you want to destroy Hive for what he's done to you.<eos> We all do, and we will.<eos> I know you want revenge, but we have to be better.<eos> We have to do what's best for the team.<eos> It's times like this when there's no clear path that I understand why people pray.<eos> We don't know if any of the rest of you are infected, but we will soon.<eos> Even so, the Inhumans cannot encounter Hive.<eos> For the time being, I have to keep you in quarantine.
We've tried to fill it, but it never works.<eos> I found the answer... and it's beautiful.<eos> It's - - It's - - It's a bond.<eos> Beautiful?<eos> Daisy, people are dying!<eos> Malick?<eos> So it's you.<eos> I was curious who Hive would send.<eos> I know what you're gonna do.<eos> We can't let you keep talking.
Just like me, you haven't aged a day.<eos> I have a good hairdresser.<eos> In my long life, I have met some of the most skilled interrogators in history, but since we are in the Soviet Union, let me tell you a story about a friend of mine...<eos> Joseph Stalin.<eos> He became quite skilled at breaking a man... carefully aimed strikes to the bridge of the nose, along the shoulder blades, and right underneath the chin.<eos> Stalin gave me this as a gift.<eos> So it's to be torture, then?<eos> Get on with it.<eos> No.<eos> Nothing so prosaic for you, Professor.
So?<eos> So what if the key to breaking in is asking someone who's been in and out of Soviet prisons their whole life?<eos> And who might that be?<eos> Are you familiar with the Bratva?<eos> The Russian Mob?<eos> In 1986, they would have ruled the criminal underground inside every prison.<eos> Your tattoo.<eos> It stands for "Menia Ispravit Rasstrel" if I'm not mistaken.<eos> In English, it translates to, "Execution Will Reform Me."<eos> What brings you to the banya, little man?
By staying on the ship.<eos> We don't need any more casualties.<eos> Besides, Mr. Snart and Sara have got it covered. Whoa, man.<eos> Why does it feel like we're on the JV team all of a sudden?<eos> What you are is one half of everything Savage needs to change the face of the Cold War.<eos> And you are the only person who can kill him.<eos> Yeah, so you can't just...<eos> I am not going to gift-wrap the two people in the world that Savage wants the most.<eos> We should get going.<eos> Oh, Ms. Lance, could I borrow you for a moment?
As if I would only build one.<eos> We're so close, Professor.<eos> All I need to learn now is how to stabilize the thermocore, and my dream of creating a nuclear man will be achieved.<eos> To what end?<eos> If you launch a Soviet Firestorm, the United States will have no choice but to retaliate.<eos> Both countries will be annihilated.<eos> And out of the ashes, we will rise stronger... just as we did when the Nazis invaded.<eos> But America is weak with your Big Mac, MTV, movie-star president.<eos> Do you really think Vandal Savage cares about the Cold War?<eos> He's just using you, Doctor.
And if the plan fails, you'll kill him.<eos> - You want my advice?<eos> - No.<eos> Don't use your gun.<eos> Do it with your hands.<eos> Do it while you're looking right into Stein's eyes.<eos> You're talking about a member of our team.<eos> I just don't want you to forget who we're talking about.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Valentina has failed to make you talk.
Move!<eos> Kill her!<eos> What's happening, Ms. Lance?<eos> I couldn't rescue Stein.<eos> Have they moved him into the lab?<eos> Yeah, where Savage has every guard in the gulag watching him.<eos> Well, if that's the case...<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> The formula for stabilizing Firestorm, Professor.<eos> This may surprise you, but in my youth, I longed to visit Russia.
We're dressed as guards.<eos> Run.<eos> Everyone back in your cells!<eos> Enjoy your new cellmate!<eos> That door leads to the loading bay.<eos> From there, you can get to the jump ship.<eos> Hey, Mick, this is a strange kind of hug.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I got something to do.<eos> Mr. Savage, I need to get you to the helicopter.
You stole it from me during a pagan blood ritual back in 1975.<eos> Ring any bells?<eos> Slowly.<eos> I have no desire to kill you.<eos> I want you alive.<eos> I want you to see the world burn.<eos> I have looked so often at your wife and son these last 11 years...<eos> Miranda and Jonas, their faces etched into my mind.<eos> And when I finally get to meet them, I will let them know that you and your friends are responsible for their suffering.<eos> Not if I see you first.
What were you doing, and did you speak to John Frum while you were there?<eos> He's answering that yes, he's been there.<eos> He stayed there for one full night.<eos> He had seen someone and he spoke to him.<eos> We... It's said that John Frum uses the volcano as a portal, a doorway, to travel from Tanna to America.<eos> Does John Frum live inside the volcano?<eos> He's telling us that John Frum has a special room that he's living in.<eos> But there is one day that we will meet him in a different form of a person, like Jesus.<eos> When I was on the volcano... I found it amazing to watch, but also quite terrifying.<eos> How did you feel spending a whole night up in the crater?
Inaction and indecision.<eos> The Russians have a spy satellite lapping the planet, taking pictures of God knows what!<eos> The President is demanding an immediate response. No more delay.<eos> Alan Shepard, John Glenn, your uncle Bob, it doesn't matter.<eos> Get us up there, Harrison.<eos> We can't justify a space program that doesn't put anything in space.<eos> How'd that feel in there, Paul?<eos> You think you enlightened the administrator?<eos> No, he didn't look enlightened to me.<eos> He look enlightened to you, Sam?
Let me ask you... if you were a white male, would you wish to be an engineer?<eos> I wouldn't have to.<eos> I'd already be one.<eos> Skirts must be worn past the knee.<eos> Sweaters are preferred to blouses.<eos> No jewelry.<eos> A simple pearl necklace is the exception.<eos> Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison, Director of the Space Task Group.<eos> You'll write research, proof calculations, so forth.<eos> Do not talk to Mr. Harrison unless he talks to you.
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.<eos> Engineering.<eos> And I'm proud as the devil to be working with you.<eos> Thank you, Mary.<eos> John, let's take it inside.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Guys.<eos> Nice meeting you guys.<eos> Thank you, Colonel. Good luck, sir.<eos> God bless you all.
Thank you.<eos> I believe I owe you an apology.<eos> Well, was that it?<eos> Can I make it while we dance?<eos> I'm afraid I simply misspoke the other day, Mrs. Goble.<eos> I've been away for a long time.<eos> I imagine I'm just out of practice.<eos> I was hoping you'd allow me to start over.<eos> See, the thing is...<eos> I have an interest in getting to know you better.
I imagine I'm just out of practice.<eos> I was hoping you'd allow me to start over.<eos> See, the thing is...<eos> I have an interest in getting to know you better.<eos> You're one tough customer, huh?<eos> You haven't said you're sorry yet. Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sorry, Katherine.<eos> For what, Jim?<eos> Underestimating you.
Where the hell have you been?<eos> Everywhere I look, you're not where I need you to be.<eos> It's not my imagination.<eos> Now where the hell do you go every day?<eos> To the bathroom, sir.<eos> To the bathroom?<eos> To the damn bathroom.<eos> For 40 minutes a day?<eos> What do you do in there?<eos> We're T-minus zero here. I put a lot of faith in you.
What's the point?<eos> The point is, Your Honor... no Negro woman in the state of Virginia... has ever attended an all-white high school.<eos> It's unheard of. Yeah.<eos> Unheard of.<eos> And before Alan Shepard sat on top of a rocket, no other American had ever touched space.<eos> And now, he will forever be remembered as the U.S. Navy man from New Hampshire, the first to touch the stars.<eos> And I, sir... I plan on being an engineer at NASA, but I can't do that without taking them classes at that all-white high school.<eos> And I can't change the color of my skin.<eos> Sol have no choice but to be the first.<eos> Which I can't do without you, sir.

Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Computers don't author reports.<eos> CAPCOM, this is Liberty Bell 7.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Okay, it's a nice ride up to now.<eos> Roger.<eos> Liberty Bell 7, this is Hook 1 approaching.<eos> Ready to hook on.<eos> Over. I read you loud and clear.
We're working on it.<eos> Katherine.<eos> What's it gonna take to make this thing worth the price tag?<eos> We're just getting up to speed here, Mr. Harrison.<eos> I need more manpower.<eos> I need programmers, folks to feed the cards.<eos> Get them, for crying out loud. Okay.<eos> You're the IBM man, right? Yes, sir.<eos> Go pull them out of the sky if you have to.<eos> Let's get ahead of this thing or I'm not paying you.
The problem... is when the capsule moves from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.<eos> There's no mathematical formula for that.<eos> Because we can calculate launch and landing... but without this conversion the capsule stays in orbit, we can't bring it back home.<eos> Maybe we've been thinking about this all wrong.<eos> How's that?<eos> Maybe it's not new math at all.<eos> It could be old math.<eos> Something that looks at the problem numerically, and not theoretically.<eos> Math is always dependable.<eos> For you it is.
Yes.<eos> That's thoughtful of you.<eos> They're lovely.<eos> Mr. Harrison's idea, really.<eos> Although I suspect his wife did the picking out.<eos> Can't imagine he has an eye for anything but numbers.<eos> Now you have a great wedding.<eos> You did good work around here, Katherine.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Good to see you.
Friendship 7, do you copy'? Over.<eos> Friendship 7, do you copy'?<eos> Over.<eos> Loud and clear, CAPCOM.<eos> Roger that.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> My condition is good.<eos> That was a real fireball.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Let's get you all the way home.
-What?<eos> -Let me watch you go.<eos> Oh, you gonna "watch me" watch me?<eos> I will watch... you.<eos> - Go!<eos> - I'm goin'.<eos> It's clearly that... time.<eos> -Look at me go.<eos> -Go.<eos> -May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?
Conservative estimates are that there will be thousands of more cars in the neighborhood per day because of the construction--<eos> It says you wanna put a park in instead.<eos> I can't live within 2,500 feet of a park.<eos> They would literally kick me out of my own home.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?<eos> I wish you wouldn't.<eos> I look across from me and I don't see a monster.<eos> I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.<eos> Not everybody judges you.
But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's all so fucked.<eos> Here.<eos> It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Warden Caputo's office.<eos> This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?<eos> Is Warden Caputo available?<eos> Let me place you on a brief hold while I go and check.
Linda sounds more right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get Linda from MCC on the line.<eos> All right.<eos> Press the button that says "Line one." -One.<eos> -Nine and the number.<eos> Nine... Got you.<eos> --Uh, hello? Yes, hello.<eos> I have Director Caputo.<eos> I will transfer you now.
He may lose a kidney.<eos> -Jesus.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> So take your $20 and drown your conscience in a bottle of gin, because paying me to feel better about it ain't gonna work.<eos> Donaldson.<eos> You tell O'Neill I'm sorry about his stones.<eos> I'm also sorry you gotta work here.<eos> But I need you to understand something.<eos> I'm sorry for you.<eos> I don't regret firing any of you.
4-1-1-2, proceed to location.<eos> Can I talk to you a second?<eos> - Take the next one. - Sir.<eos> What is it?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I find Geronimo, you give me my son back.<eos> I held up my end of the bargain.<eos> Our deal we predicated on Geronimo being the leader of the Resistance, not some bullshit hipsters.<eos> You've put me in the unenviable position...<eos> I put you... Of having to step in and try and make some kind of victory out of this steaming shit pile.
Your bloc, your call.<eos> I'm... I'm curious.<eos> Uh, Geronimo's capture.<eos> Did you let our Hosts know?<eos> Do they know that we have issues with the Resistance?<eos> Of course they do.<eos> Have we told them anything specific about Geronimo?<eos> No.<eos> The Governor-General wants to wait and see where this is all going first.<eos> So, my question to you, Alan, is: will Geronimo roll over on the other terrorists or not?
Let your eyes move.<eos> He's tall.<eos> Strong hands without veins or age to them.<eos> Very closely cropped hair.<eos> Food, Miss Ives.<eos> You have to eat, Miss.<eos> Please eat.<eos> Why didn't you eat?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> What... Why can I see you?
If you don't eat... there'll be consequences.<eos> Bring it to me.<eos> No.<eos> It's three feet away.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> They tortured me today.<eos> I'm not to engage in conversation, Miss.<eos> Are they listening?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't torture you.
No.<eos> It's three feet away.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> They tortured me today.<eos> I'm not to engage in conversation, Miss.<eos> Are they listening?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't torture you.<eos> You weren't there!<eos> They're making you well.
I can't.<eos> Doctor Seward, stop this session now!<eos> I can't, Vanessa!<eos> I've been trying!<eos> You won't come out. You won't wake up.<eos> I burned your hand with a cigarette.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> You've apparently gone into something called a fugue state.<eos> Look at me, Vanessa.<eos> I'm not going to lie to you.
When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!<eos> I know you.
I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!<eos> I know you.<eos> And from what you say, I've known you a long time.
That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!<eos> I know you.<eos> And from what you say, I've known you a long time.<eos> My ancestor, the old woman, Joan Clayton, what would she say to you?<eos> "Be true."<eos> Be true.<eos> You will come out of it.<eos> When you're at the heart of your trauma, when you've found what you're here for.<eos> I'm not leaving you for anything in this world.
Nothing changed.<eos> The treatments continued.<eos> Escalated.<eos> I can't move my arms.<eos> I can't speak.<eos> Miss Ives?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I'm not good at this.<eos> My wife's got short hair... and I have no sisters.<eos> I'm sick to see you like this.
Can you hear me?<eos> I'm not good at this.<eos> My wife's got short hair... and I have no sisters.<eos> I'm sick to see you like this.<eos> I can't stop thinking about it.<eos> It is torture.<eos> I'll have to undo it all before morning.<eos> They can't know.<eos> They'd sack me if they knew.<eos> And then who'd attend to you?
Uh, this is my wife's.<eos> She told me what to do.<eos> I tell her about you.<eos> That's against regulations too.<eos> She said to use a light hand and spare the heavy for the lips.<eos> She's got beautiful lips, my wife.<eos> Her name's Marjorie.<eos> I would leave this place, but I need the work.<eos> Jobs are scarce and... I've to feed the family, you understand.<eos> And I wouldn't leave you in any case.
"I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me.<eos> And what can be the use of him... is more than I can see.<eos> He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head.<eos> And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.<eos> The funniest thing about him..."<eos> "I never can get back by day, nor can remember plain and clear,<eos> the curious music that I hear."<eos> I've got to go, before the day fellows get here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day soon, no one will touch you when you don't want to be touched.
The funniest thing about him..."<eos> "I never can get back by day, nor can remember plain and clear,<eos> the curious music that I hear."<eos> I've got to go, before the day fellows get here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day soon, no one will touch you when you don't want to be touched.<eos> Or put makeup on you, or take it off.<eos> Ever, ever again.<eos> If I'm honest, I don't really believe in God, but...<eos> I'll pray for you.
And you don't believe in God so you don't believe in Satan either.<eos> I'm a stupid man.<eos> Very bad at my lettering and my figures, no gift for words.<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> And I'll listen.<eos> So. Why would the Devil be interested in you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If you were Lucifer, why would you be interested in someone?<eos> Oh, that's easy.<eos> Because I love you.
Why bother?<eos> You'll need your strength tomorrow.<eos> It's to be tomorrow?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will there be anything left of me?<eos> Will it take long?<eos> A few hours.<eos> Will I feel pain?<eos> No, no, you'll be sedated.<eos> Does your wife cook for you?
What do you think you're doing?<eos> You know the laws about mistreating inmates.<eos> If you harm one hair on his head...<eos> Now, you stinking little stain!<eos> I'm going to ask you politely, one last time.<eos> Where is he?<eos> CARNY OWNER:<eos> Ah, there you are.<eos> So, had enough time to look over the property?<eos> It's what you're looking for?
Smarten up, wise guy.<eos> There ain't no Red Hood.<eos> Just a bunch of guys like yourself and a mask.<eos> Right, the most valued member of the crew, he gets to wear it, no questions asked.<eos> 'Cause he needs the... "He can't afford to be connected to the job<eos> "so he deserves additional anonymity."<eos> Merits it.<eos> Sure.<eos> That makes sense, right?<eos> That's you.
How many men?<eos> Twelve. Maybe more. Pursuing Ethan.<eos> We shall be upon them by nightfall.<eos> Our horses won't survive the pace.<eos> I intend to acquire new horses.<eos> You mean to murder every last one of them.<eos> Those men stand between us and that demon that seeks to corrupt Ethan's soul.<eos> To save my son, I would slaughter an entire army.<eos> And I would gladly give up my own life.<eos> Would he do the same for you?
We'll see, won't we, old sport?<eos> What's the method?<eos> I'm going to inject an electrified dosage into the prefrontal cortex of your brain.<eos> All right.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> No.<eos> That'll be all, Doctor, thank you.<eos> You will have no memory of this.<eos> Not of this treatment, nor of your crimes, nor of your sins, nor of your time in this horrid place.<eos> Every moment that has benighted your life and set you on your dark course... I will take from you.
This is a bloodthirsty land.<eos> When I first came to this place, it was infested with those red-handed devils, the Apache.<eos> More animal than human...<eos> Not human at all, in truth.<eos> I blazed my way through the darkness.<eos> Through iron will and violent force, and the glory of God are empires born.<eos> There are mountains named after me.<eos> And at what cost?<eos> Your home's empty.<eos> Your son hates you.
What do you want to do with this one?<eos> Let him die slow.<eos> Time you see what it is you did, son.<eos> You brought the devil to my door. And you gave him the key.<eos> You will repent.<eos> Or I will send you to hell myself.<eos> I'm done repenting... And I belong in hell.<eos> Sir.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Someone's here to see you.
Oh, on some mad hunt in America.<eos> The only other she speaks of is an old love.<eos> He too has abandoned her.<eos> The Wolf.<eos> Where is he?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> What else?<eos> Speak. Now... or I will feed you to them.<eos> She knows your name, Master.<eos> She called you Dracula.
An expedition, heaven forfend!<eos> Just a jaunt over to Cairo.<eos> At least that's what I've been assured this will be.<eos> If I see a tent, I shall faint.<eos> Just a jaunt?<eos> For appearance sake.<eos> A trip to the tomb of Imhotep.<eos> But strictly entre nous, one has heard that Cairo is considerably more... accepting of my particular way of life.<eos> I imagine the expedition will be extended. Indefinitely.<eos> Oh, whatever will I do without you?

Indefinitely.<eos> Oh, whatever will I do without you?<eos> Oh, my dear, your life is far too glittering for an old man like me.<eos> Condemn me to the sand and dust.<eos> Write often... and think of me only when you dance.<eos> Are you quite well?<eos> Yes, and I shall leave you to it.
Whatever you need.<eos> This pain is fleeting, I promise you that.<eos> You will be well, son.<eos> Father.<eos> Shh! Please!<eos> What the bloody hell was that?<eos> My God!<eos> I've never known such a reprehensible cheat.<eos> What is your name?<eos> I should have you struck from the league.
It's wonderful for the mind.<eos> Every decision reduced to back and forth.<eos> Thrust or parry.<eos> A clarity forms during it that the rest of the world is sadly lacking in.<eos> Life and death without the death.<eos> Most of the time.<eos> We have a mutual acquaintance...<eos> - Mr. Lyle.<eos> - Ah! The indomitable Mr. Lyle!<eos> Well then, what can I do for you, Miss...
It tells of an ancient being, flushed with youth.<eos> A strategist, changing his appearance and identity from century to century.<eos> It calls him a seducer, but in the antiquated form of the word.<eos> One who is able to lead men astray, to corrupt.<eos> Beyond that, there's not a lot.<eos> I could look pre-Ottoman, search for earlier accounts.<eos> I don't wish to find him in history.<eos> I wish to find him now, in London.<eos> If that is the case, then I would advise caution.<eos> Which would shock you if you knew me better.
Besides... you never know when we might need his unique services.<eos> Hear me, boy.<eos> Mend your broken heart elsewhere.<eos> Ease your conscience with another.<eos> I am done with you.<eos> The next time I see you... I'll hold the razor myself.<eos> What are you waiting on, my gratitude?<eos> You are in my debt, Victor.<eos> I will call on it.<eos> I'd like to welcome you all to my table.

I'll hold the razor myself.<eos> What are you waiting on, my gratitude?<eos> You are in my debt, Victor.<eos> I will call on it.<eos> I'd like to welcome you all to my table.<eos> Let it never be said that a Talbot man was inhospitable.<eos> This is something I hope you inherit, my son.<eos> Treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the natives among you, and you shall love him as yourself.<eos> I hope you gentlemen understand I would've offered you a bribe if I believed you could've been bought.
There was time when we were thrown together at very close quarters.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> No.<eos> The Banning Clinic, off the Strand.<eos> No.<eos> You used to work there. Before your accident.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were very kind to me once.<eos> And I loved you for it.
Plagues of illness and death.<eos> "And then all light will end and the world will live in darkness.<eos> The very air will be pestilence to mankind."<eos> Is this your prophesy, woman?<eos> Don't speak these words or you may bring them to life.<eos> I'm no witch.<eos> You know nothing of me.<eos> You are a great, fertile bitch of evil and I love you for your fertility and your power.<eos> You are the woman of all our dreams and all our night terrors.<eos> All the Night Creatures are gathering around you.

The sheen on the fox's pelt. The scent in the air when night birds take wing.<eos> They make you drunk with love.
Go on home now.<eos> You look like you could use some sleep.<eos> You're awfully pale.<eos> Oh, just a touch of the ague.<eos> I'll be right as rain soon, right as rain, yes I will.<eos> Right as rain will I be, yes.<eos> Good night, Doctor.<eos> Miss Hartdegen.<eos> It's Catriona, please.<eos> Or for you, Cat.
And I'll be honest with you, I've done my share of butchering over the years.<eos> But this, my darling, this is not the work of a soldier.<eos> It's the work of a spy.<eos> You must get close enough to look into his damned eyes.<eos> And then have the grit to do it.<eos> Then help me.<eos> How can I find him?<eos> He's a tactician above all.<eos> He'll approach you with stealth and strategy, not a frontal assault.<eos> He'll seduce you, not attack you.
Or?<eos> Here I stand.<eos> And yet you have kindness still.<eos> You spared me the sin of patricide.<eos> No man should have to murder a member of his own family.<eos> This I know.<eos> I honestly thought I could do it.<eos> End it with my father in blood.<eos> I am, as you know, no stranger to killing. Or "night work" as Miss Ives once put it.<eos> The night I met you, in fact.
Do you mean that?<eos> As you wish.<eos> Dr. Frankenstein?<eos> - Victor!<eos> - What are you doing, sir? Out in this night, this dire night.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> - Who, sir?<eos> - The doctor who lives here.<eos> Called away, he was.<eos> But I can take you to him.
- Then you'll learn.<eos> Are you going to teach me?<eos> You could do worse.<eos> Though I've a firm hand, Sir M.<eos> Why are you in my house?<eos> Sit!<eos> Please.<eos> Miss Ives approached me looking for information on a creature that she believed was hunting her.<eos> A vampire.<eos> Why did she come to you?
Some sort of undertaker?<eos> Do I look like an undertaker?<eos> No, you look like...<eos> I really couldn't say.<eos> Let's say I look like a friend then.<eos> I'm looking for Vanessa Ives.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - A friend.<eos> You must be Sir Malcolm Murray.<eos> You, I don't know.
Yeah...<eos> Yes. Yes, I think we go right.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Onwards.<eos> Dude!<eos> Phones, man...<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Uh, hello.<eos> Mr. hariri?<eos> Mr. Henderson is waiting for you by the sedona stage.
Queen-knight defense.<eos> What is this?<eos> I'm close.<eos> I need help for the last bit of the journey.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Our bond, hold it in your mind.<eos> Our partnership.<eos> Please be real, please be real, please be real.<eos> Please let this be real.<eos> Oh, it is a relief to find you hale and hearty, Lieutenant.
What do you want?<eos> Nothing from you.<eos> You're searching for a way out, and yes, the Eye is the key.<eos> I can show you how, for a price.<eos> Bring us the Eye, Witness, and you can go back home.<eos> We're not going to give it to you.<eos> There's nothing that you can do... in your astral form.<eos> You are so smart.<eos> You're too smart for your own good.<eos> No, I can't touch you.
It's you.<eos> I know you are still with me.<eos> And if this is the way out, then you come with me.<eos> You said that Jenny and you used totems to help find me.<eos> Now just use me.<eos> If I get out of here so will you.<eos> Stay with me, Crane.<eos> Stay with me, Crane.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> I need you.
And the... Please, Lieutenant.<eos> This is it.<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> Painstaking boredom.<eos> You're my Wilson.<eos> Which is why it's a little bit upsetting that you killed all my houseplants.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, let it be known that in my time I have cultivated medicinal herb gardens, myriad vegetable patches and, in fact, once even an entire orchard of monkey puzzle, and not one of them has been as recondite as your spiderwort variation.<eos> Two words, Crane:<eos> In all candor, Lieutenant, whilst you were away, I spent every waking hour endeavoring to bring you home.
Uh, Lieutenant...<eos> I know your transition home is a trying one.<eos> But believe me, it will grow easier.<eos> I'll see you in a couple hours.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ms. Corinth, what a pleasant surprise.<eos> Gosh, it's been, uh... heavens, a whole fortnight since last we spoke.<eos> Two and a half fortnights, actually.<eos> But who's counting?<eos> And what brings you here?
Franklin, I will eat my bodkin if I have to braid one more of these blasted Kindred threads.<eos> Haven't I been punished enough?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Pardon me, I thought you were...<eos> Benjamin Franklin?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> Though I was to have an assembly with him here at a quarter past 12:00.<eos> Good luck. I've been waiting to see him since noon.<eos> Mr. Franklin will not be coming.<eos> What makes you so certain?
Good luck. I've been waiting to see him since noon.<eos> Mr. Franklin will not be coming.<eos> What makes you so certain?<eos> Given how little he leaves to chance, I'd wager this is his idiosyncratic way of introducing us as new mission partners.<eos> That's assuming you do more than mere plain-work, Miss Ross.<eos> My name is Ichabod Crane.<eos> The Oxford boy. For mercy's sake, Mr. Crane, if I may be blunt, I have no need for a counterpart.<eos> And the last thing I want is to be responsible for some trigger-happy revolutionary or, in your case, a rebellious bookworm.<eos> I'm quite capable, thank you.<eos> And your roster of former partners suggests I'm to be a moderating influence to you, not the other way around.

You never got a good look at him at any point?<eos> He was horribly disfigured.<eos> Didn't say much.<eos> I'm sorry. I-I wish I could tell you more.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Mills would've caught him alive.<eos> She's a damn good agent, Reynolds.<eos> You should talk to her again and tell her how important she is to you.<eos> Zoe?<eos> For you.
She'll find her feet again.<eos> Under your keen eye, Daniel, I have no doubt.<eos> Oh, one other thing:<eos> I want you to downgrade the search for Atticus Nevins.<eos> Minor resources only.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Because I ordered you to.<eos> Satisfied?<eos> It's a start.<eos> The funds have already been transferred to your account in Geneva, and there is a plane standing by, waiting to take you wherever you choose.
You think you have a say in that?<eos> - You think Daisy did?<eos> - He's coming.<eos> With one caveat.<eos> You want in, you wear this.<eos> It's lined with nano-thermites.<eos> Nano-what?<eos> They're miniscule explosives.<eos> You want me to wear a suicide vest?<eos> It's only if Hive infects you.
Nano-what?<eos> They're miniscule explosives.<eos> You want me to wear a suicide vest?<eos> It's only if Hive infects you.<eos> And, technically, a suicide vest is something you control.<eos> So it's a murder vest.<eos> This watch is the trigger. Phil.<eos> If Hive gets its hands on him...<eos> I go kaboom?<eos> That'd make you both real happy, wouldn't it?
This watch is the trigger. Phil.<eos> If Hive gets its hands on him...<eos> I go kaboom?<eos> That'd make you both real happy, wouldn't it?<eos> Then you'd get Daisy back, and the three of you can live as one small, messed-up family again?<eos> - It's a last resort.<eos> - It's insane.<eos> I want your help.<eos> I need it.<eos> But if Hive sways you, that's it.

Guys, this woman has been heavily modified, in ways you wouldn't anticipate.<eos> Mm, man, I need to get out more.<eos> Are you a patient of Dr. Radcliffe?<eos> We have...quite innovative eye technology.<eos> Perhaps it will serve you, as well.<eos> I can take it to the doctor.<eos> Respectfully, it's for Dr. Radcliffe.<eos> Or no one at all.<eos> Wait in the bar area.<eos> If the doctor expresses interest, I will find you.
Wait in the bar area.<eos> If the doctor expresses interest, I will find you.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> Alisha never would've killed herself.<eos> She feels all of it.<eos> Every death.<eos> It's Hive.<eos> That thing forced her.<eos> We've got to stop it.<eos> I'm taking you out of the field until Fitz-Simmons find a cure.
That thing forced her.<eos> We've got to stop it.<eos> I'm taking you out of the field until Fitz-Simmons find a cure.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I - - I know I went overboard today, and I'm sorry.<eos> Without Daisy, I...<eos> I'll do better.<eos> Please.<eos> She'd want me to keep you safe.
Mr. Doria?<eos> Virginia Goodman.<eos> I came on behalf of your lawyer, Felix Leiva.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Please come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Two minutes and I'll finish dressing.<eos> Here, the news of the day and this morning they held the funeral of Laura Vidal, known photographer and visual artist, allegedly killed by her lover Adrian Doria, who was recently awarded the prestigious European awards for Innovation and Business Development,<eos> as entrepreneur of the year'. Doria, who had recently launched in the Asian market, his company 'Go Global Tech Media', pleads innocence and claims to be the victim of a conspiracy.<eos> I expected you later, Ms. Goodman.
I expected you later, Ms. Goodman.<eos> Yes, I'm afraid there's been a mishap.<eos> I tried to talk to Felix, but he's not responding.<eos> He's traveling.<eos> But he assured me he had everything under control, he had a lead...<eos> - that would change everything.<eos> - Yes. This he told me the last time I talked to him.<eos> But then I didn't know what I know now - and that he doesn't know yet.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> It's quite possible that you'll be compelled to testify tonight.
The whole crime scene was set up to incriminate me and that the police would have formulated the false theory that Laura fell in love with me and I, to save my marriage, tried unsuccessfully to buy her off, and then killed her.<eos> - It's an absurd trap.<eos> - Whose? I don't know.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I tell you I don't know!<eos> The only thing I know is that my wife has left me and took my daughter with her.<eos> And that someone is getting away with it.<eos> If you don't pay attention, if you don't seek answers in your life, you know what will happen?<eos> - You'll be confirming the police suspicions.<eos> They believe there's no one who would have any reason to do this to you.
You know?<eos> In the 30 years of my career, I have had to deal with two types of clients.<eos> Those who take responsibility and cooperate, although it would mean to go where they don't want to, and those who think are smarter than me and expect that I save them from a guilty sentence, without getting their hands dirty.<eos> You belong to the latter.<eos> But let me be clear about two things.<eos> There'll be no salvation without suffering and you're not smarter than me.<eos> Youth Missing in Bierge<eos> Have you wondered if the new prosecution witness had anything to do with this?<eos> We have already lost 10 minutes, Mr. Doria.<eos> I'll ask you just once.
Yes, a deer crossed my path, but I'm fine, thank you.<eos> You were lucky, you might have killed yourself.<eos> No power.<eos> The engine, I do not know, it doesn't start and I called for roadside assistance, but they're very busy and they don't know how long it will take them.<eos> There's always a solution.<eos> I know these cars really well, these machines, are good.<eos> Coincidentally... years ago, I worked as an engineer in their Spanish headquarters.<eos> Tomas Garrido.<eos> Now, I have a repair shop.<eos> Nice to meet you.
There's nothing, I'm fine now.<eos> I regret not having called you before.<eos> It's OK, don't worry.<eos> I'll see you later at home.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Hello, love.<eos> Elvira, my wife. She's Raquel.<eos> She hit a deer, and the engine starter is blocked. I'll fix it for her.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
Are you're with them?<eos> And Daniel is not there?<eos> That's weird... if he left at 6!<eos> Yes.<eos> He came back from work, changed and left.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> I reset it and it works perfectly.<eos> Are you staying for dinner?<eos> I'm sure my wife convinced you already. All right.
I have to talk to Felix.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - Felix, where are you?<eos> I'm coming from Bilbao.<eos> Virginia Goodman is here because it seems that the prosecution has gone ahead of us.<eos> What do you mean the prosecution?<eos> - Look, when do you get back?<eos> - Tonight, on the last flight.<eos> Put her on.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
I'm on a big break, perhaps very beneficial for the case.<eos> - I'll call in a couple of hours.<eos> Thank you, Felix.<eos> What did he say?<eos> Everything's under control.<eos> Don't worry. Well, let's continue.<eos> Where were we?<eos> I resumed my life.<eos> Then the police arrived.<eos> Mr. Doria, you have visitors.
They attributed me with the award of entrepreneur of the year. I went head first into the media hurricane.<eos> Mr. Doria, how do you feel?<eos> Very happy.<eos> They sold me as the 'man of the moment'.<eos> An example for young people like me who came from nothing and turned into a winner.<eos> But it was pure appearance.<eos> I felt broken for a long time.<eos> Rotten.<eos> - Mr. Doria.<eos> - Yes? A reporter wants to talk to you.

Two dead and two bodies.<eos> The murder of your mistress seems to be a direct consequence of Daniel Garrido's death.<eos> But, for the police, there is only one murder 'cause they only have just one body.<eos> Laura Vidal's.<eos> And their suspect is you.<eos> But, for us, and for Daniel Garrido's parents there is another body and another death, that of the missing boy.<eos> And the Garridos suspect that you and your lover are the culprits.<eos> Because she's now dead, the only one that remains... is you.<eos> What does this puzzle suggests?<eos> What does it suggests to you?
And the Garridos suspect that you and your lover are the culprits.<eos> Because she's now dead, the only one that remains... is you.<eos> What does this puzzle suggests?<eos> What does it suggests to you?<eos> It makes me think of the hotel room mystery.<eos> In that man who you say... killed your lover and then disappeared...<eos> Someone connected to Daniel Garrido.<eos> There's someone that you have not named who knows more than those parents.<eos> Do you need help?<eos> Do you want to have the jury believe that passerby driver arranged the meeting at the hotel?
Do you need help?<eos> Do you want to have the jury believe that passerby driver arranged the meeting at the hotel?<eos> - To what end, Mr. Doria?<eos> - To blackmail us for what he knew.<eos> That we were guilty.<eos> And that he couldn't find out who I was and that Laura was not my wife.<eos> Details, Mr. Doria.<eos> I have to warn you that the jury would only believe this absurd theory, if the details make it plausible.<eos> I have not yet told you how they arranged the appointment at the Bellavista Hotel.<eos> Mr. Doria, this has arrived for you.
Hotel Bellavista<eos> And three: how could he get in and out of the room as if he were a ghost?<eos> Do you see?<eos> You're giving the prosecutor exactly what he wants.<eos> Stupid connections that will destroy the illusion that you're making a coherent account...<eos> Don't start over with that!<eos> Surprise me with something, resolve this puzzle.<eos> OK, I'll tell what might have happened, according to what you told me.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Let's go back to the station, where the blackmailer had to contact you at 17:00 hours.
It's something that would convince a judge.<eos> Tomas Garrido had a strong motive to commit a murder.<eos> If a father knows that the police protects those responsible for the disappearance of his son, he has only one option: - force you to face it.<eos> - Kill one of us and incriminate the other it's a way to get it.<eos> That's right.<eos> It worked perfectly.<eos> Everyone believes you guilty, Mr. Doria.<eos> The police, your own wife and even your financial partners.<eos> Tomas Garrido did not only implicate you for the death of your lover, but he also ruined your life and your business.<eos> And only Felix could get you out with a million dollar bail.
And the answer must be in the statement of the facts.<eos> - I don't know what you expect to see.<eos> - The details, Mr. Doria.<eos> You dwell on the details.<eos> They have always been under our noses. Adrian Doria arrested for murder<eos> But they have to be analyzed from a different perspective.<eos> What if the answer to the enigma had never been inside the room, but rather, outside?<eos> Now, he works near Bierge, in the valley, 20 minutes from home.<eos> It was no accident that he chose a hotel so isolated.<eos> Tomas Garrido set up a trap for you.
For Tomas Garrido, it was enough to toss a coin in the air and wait for you to pick it up.<eos> And you did.<eos> - Is that what happened?<eos> - You gave yourself up, and, at the right time, you handed Laura over.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I have a reservation.<eos> Room 715...<eos> That's how Tomas Garrido could get in the room without leaving any evidence.<eos> He just had to wait for you and Laura to get up to the room.
- You gave yourself up, and, at the right time, you handed Laura over.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I have a reservation.<eos> Room 715...<eos> That's how Tomas Garrido could get in the room without leaving any evidence.<eos> He just had to wait for you and Laura to get up to the room.<eos> From there, he could send the SMS with Laura's phone.<eos> He just sent us a text message with your mobile phone.<eos> And then hit you to put you out of action completing the perfect crime.

And did you wait for me to tell you?<eos> To make sure that I could put my life in your hands, Ms. Goodman.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> This is where I sunk it.<eos> I have to tell you something else.<eos> We thought he had died, I swear.<eos> Laura had taken things too far and there was no going back.<eos> If the police found the body the autopsy would give me away.<eos> I had to be sure that you would help me avoid it.<eos> It's my job to keep you out of jail, but I'm not going to save who you really are, a scum, Mr. Doria.
That she had been the real instigator of everything, it would strengthen the belief that you would save that youngster.<eos> Instead, you drowned him!<eos> It was she that bore such a weight on her conscience, that, little by little, made her collapse.<eos> Until she realized that there was only one way to regain their dignity'.<eos> By now, she could no longer return the child to those poor parents.<eos> But there was something she could do. Tell them the truth.<eos> So she met them at the hotel where the lad's mother was employed.<eos> A secluded spot in which to put her plan in action.<eos> She went to Bierge alone through the valley.<eos> And when she got to the hotel station, She call you from a pay phone so you wouldn't suspect anything.
Why did Tomas Garrido and his wife have not spoken up?<eos> If Laura call them to tell the truth Why did they not tell the police?<eos> Those parents know you will never incriminated yourself and tell them where their son is buried.<eos> Without a body, it is very difficult to prove a murder, and that you're capable of anything just to remain free,<eos> including blaming them for the death of your mistress.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Second window to the right of the penultimate floor.<eos> Look carefully, Mr. Doria.<eos> Tomas Garrido has stopped counting on the police for some time now.<eos> And, since then, he's been watching you planning take the law into his own hands.
And, since then, he's been watching you planning take the law into his own hands.<eos> You assume things that you can not know.<eos> About Tomas Garrido I know more than you think.<eos> Why?<eos> - You're very smart, make an effort.<eos> - I want an answer.<eos> When Tomas and his wife arrived at the hotel they learned of Laura's death. they realized what had happened.<eos> Of course, they examined the options and hesitated about what to do.<eos> But, not trusting in the justice system, what did they have left? Study the enemy and wait.<eos> To watch you.

Study the enemy and wait.<eos> To watch you.<eos> Tomas Garrido became a shadow in the shadows.<eos> He found an apartment in front of your building and managed to occupy it anonymously.<eos> And since then... he's kept you and anybody else that came in contact with you under constant surveillance.
What did he want?<eos> Her heart.<eos> He wanted her heart.<eos> There's no record of a heart condition.<eos> But a transplant would make Theo a Genetic Chimera like the others.<eos> The hypothermic conditions would keep the organ viable.<eos> Theo.<eos> But why him?<eos> Why choose a 10-year-old willing to kill his own sister?<eos> Why do you care?
But they really didn't know it yet.<eos> There was too much going on.<eos> Liam had almost killed Scott.<eos> Kira was still gone.<eos> Malia was trying to find The Desert Wolf.<eos> You were missing.<eos> And Sheriff Stilinski was dying...<eos> All right, we've got a liver lac and perforated intestine.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> We're taking care of you, Sheriff, but you have to keep your oxygen mask on.
We're going.<eos> Scott, we went through boxes of light bulbs.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You can do this.<eos> The key card won't work unless there's a reboot.<eos> And there's no reboot without a brownout.<eos> I know you can do this.<eos> Anyone here think she can't?<eos> Not me.<eos> I was the one who put you in the plan.
What?<eos> "I believe in you too, Kira."<eos> I'm the one who's going to be locked in an electrical room with her.<eos> You can do it.<eos> You guys are all crazy.<eos> We're gonna die.<eos> Please remember to follow visitor procedure.<eos> Eichen House has a wide range of patients and we cannot guarantee the safety of those who deviate from the rules.<eos> Delivery to the morgue.<eos> I don't see you on the list.
So why don't you guys get the hell out of here.<eos> I hate charity games.<eos> They're meaningless.<eos> I don't think the charities would agree.<eos> What's it for this year? Cancer.<eos> For or against?<eos> Against, Coach.<eos> Deeply against.<eos> Yeah, okay, well, I'm deeply not interested.<eos> Coach, we need you.
Lydia, he's dangerous.<eos> He's still a shapeshifter.<eos> And one who's just beginning to understand his power.<eos> And I'm not?<eos> You're not the same.<eos> You access the supernatural.<eos> It works through you.<eos> But it doesn't control you.<eos> How would you know?<eos> Why do you care?
But you did.<eos> And I don't care if you were a willing participant or not.<eos> Talia Hale spent nine months trying to convince me of the miracle of childbirth.<eos> You know what it really felt like?<eos> A parasite.<eos> Talia said it was a gift... That the coyote passes down part of her power to her daughter.<eos> She called it beautiful.<eos> I call it theft.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I brought you here like you wanted.
No.<eos> Come on.<eos> No... Joe!<eos> Joe, I think the Turtle has Patty. I...<eos> Look, just meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs, all right?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to stop moving...<eos> Forever.<eos> What do you get out of killing me?<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.
What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to stop moving...<eos> Forever.<eos> What do you get out of killing me?<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> That's much too... fast and messy.<eos> I like to take things nice and slow.<eos> You don't have to hurt me to try to prove a point.<eos> This isn't about hurting you.<eos> This is about hurting someone who values you.

I don't really know what's going on with you lately, but maybe it's a good time to talk to your mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> No, yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, can you just...<eos> Uh, do you mind...<eos> Of course.<eos> Take your time.<eos> We already paid you.
It is true.<eos> I could give a damn about this war, Henry.<eos> To be honest, I only enlisted to please my father.<eos> Well, then how can you be fine with rounding up men just like you?<eos> It is not my fault they deserted, Henry.<eos> They made their beds, but now they're our ticket home.<eos> Hello, ma'am.<eos> Could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> I do not need to remind you that quartering is your wartime duty, not to mention the law.
Good day, ma'am.<eos> Could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers?<eos> And before you say no, I'd like to remind you that quartering is the law in these parts.<eos> I also love pie.<eos> Thank you kindly.<eos> I'll go check the upstairs.<eos> Please do not.<eos> But there could be people up there.<eos> There aren't, Henry.<eos> Granny, I'm gonna have to kindly ask you set that knife down and stand over here by the table, please.

Doing doctor things.<eos> Um, they think the last surgery will fix the nerve damage, so. Mm-hmm.<eos> These are from Oliver.<eos> Well, that's really nice of him to stop by.<eos> Yeah, it's ok.<eos> I know he's doing everything he can to track down the, uh...flowers.<eos> Which is much more important.<eos> Plus, I got all the support I need right here.<eos> Felicity? Mm-hmm?<eos> I'm here to prep you for surgery.
No, no, no. It's not you, it's not you.<eos> Can I just be alone for a little while?<eos> You know, I guessed I hoped by giving you Intel on Shadowspire you would, um, let me out of my cell, but this isn't what I had in mine.<eos> Hey, Lyla.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Andy.<eos> Mr. Diggle.<eos> I'm the director of Argus.<eos> Those 3 dead men were my agents.<eos> I want to debrief you on your relationship to Shadowspire.
Pretending?<eos> !<eos> Pretending that this is the real you-- the blond hair, the glasses, the sensible fashion.<eos> People wear masks for a reason-- to hide who they are-- just like you have been doing for the past 5 years.<eos> First, you decided to sign up for being the world's most overqualified I.T. girl, and then you decide to try being a hero, and look what it got you, a ringside seat to the rest of your life.<eos> You thought you were such a badass.<eos> Waller says the shipment of railguns is in the back of that truck, moving out in less than an hour.<eos> What does Shadowspire want with a whole shipment of railguns?<eos> Absolutely nothing good.<eos> It's nice to have you back, Agent Michaels.
Oh, my God.<eos> I told you, John. The railguns were a distraction.<eos> Argus is the endgame.<eos> If this is retribution for the work Agent Chang and I did crippling Shadowspire, clearly it didn't take.<eos> Vengeance and retribution are useless pursuits.<eos> For one thing, they don't pay.<eos> I'm here for Rubicon, and you--you're gonna give me the codes to access it.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> I do. That's why I kept all these people alive.<eos> I'm gonna give you 20 minutes, and then... I'm gonna ask you again.
It's the truth.<eos> There is only one part of your story that I know to be true, and that is that you are wanted by the police.<eos> Felicity--<eos> I just need you to know one thing.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> I am nothing like you.<eos> Felicity.<eos> Noah Kuttler, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - Anything you say can...<eos> - Felicity, no. And will be used against you in a court of law.
I'm in. Yeah.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I don't like to be kept waiting.<eos> My apologies.<eos> I don't have the resources I once had.<eos> Yes. I'm aware of your recent reversal of fortune.<eos> I take it that's why you asked for this meeting.<eos> Well, I haven't come empty-handed.<eos> So to speak.<eos> I have some information that you might find of particular interest.
Are you ok?<eos> A guy, a brilliant guy says he can put a microchip in my spine and I will walk again.<eos> I'm enough of a geek to know science fiction when I see it.<eos> You're still disappointed?<eos> Yeah. You know...<eos> It's stupid. Talk to me.<eos> I wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on our wedding day.<eos> Aw, you two just melt my stone-cold heart.<eos> You almost make me believe in love again.<eos> Nice to see you, Mr. Queen.
You almost make me believe in love again.<eos> Nice to see you, Mr. Queen.<eos> How was your Christmas?<eos> Son of a bi--<eos> Oh. You're so brave for a political candidate and reformed party boy.<eos> Oh. Sorry about the limo, love the wheelchair.<eos> Might I suggest motorized.<eos> Unh! We have extremely powerful friends.<eos> You do not know who you're messing with.<eos> If it makes you happy, the messing ends today.
Nice to see you, Mr. Queen.<eos> How was your Christmas?<eos> Son of a bi--<eos> Oh. You're so brave for a political candidate and reformed party boy.<eos> Oh. Sorry about the limo, love the wheelchair.<eos> Might I suggest motorized.<eos> Unh! We have extremely powerful friends.<eos> You do not know who you're messing with.<eos> If it makes you happy, the messing ends today.<eos> I tried to bring you into the fold, Mr. Queen, I tried to kidnap your nearest and dearest, I tried to kill you, but none of that took.
Well, like she said, you don't know who you're messing with.<eos> I suspect that is true, but as they say-- well, or should-- the fourth time is the charm.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> William thinks that I'm friends with his mother.<eos> Funny. Heh heh heh.<eos> Anyhoo, 6:00 on Friday, you're gonna hold a press conference and drop out of the mayoral race.<eos> Oh, that's 6 pm, by the way.<eos> I will be at home watching you from my brand-new television.
Yeah, but that's one thing.<eos> Knowing he had a kid?<eos> I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's Oliver.<eos> He knows where William's being held.<eos> I count 4 guards patrolling the roof.<eos> Mari's in position.<eos> I wondered how long it would take for your buddy Oliver to drag you into this.
I win, you lose, rinse, repeat.<eos> This time, it's different.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Where's the boy?<eos> You have some very interesting friends.<eos> My, my.<eos> I haven't seen that trinket in a dog's age.<eos> The M'Changa province, am I right?<eos> Stay.<eos> Oh, I like you, and I don't like many people.
I will let you guys get reacquainted.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is everything ok? Detectives questioned William while the docs were checking him out.<eos> Darhk didn't take him.<eos> It was a guy with a missing hand.<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> I assure you, Mr. Queen, I had all the faith in the world that you would survive.<eos> Huh? Well, what about everybody else?<eos> You are my only concern.<eos> We've gotten this far because of you.
William.<eos> Merritt Davis will be moderating the debate.<eos> There will be a podium there, another one there, and according to tradition, the selection's made by some coin toss thingy.<eos> Mr. Queen.<eos> At last, we meet.<eos> Ms. Adams, I'm just curious. Is Adams your maiden name?<eos> Oh, I'm not married actually.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I'm sure you just haven't met the right person yet.<eos> Well, it is lovely to finally meet you, an unconventional candidate to say the least.
Yeah? Well, she looked pretty upset. Yeah.<eos> Oliver's not here.<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> I found something.<eos> The 602 didn't come from SCPD dispatch at all.<eos> Someone just made it look like it did.<eos> That someone being HIVE you're thinking.<eos> There's an encryption on it that uses the same cipher of a HIVE Sat phone that Merlyn gave us.<eos> One more time.<eos> They lured you to the hotel.
Experts aren't the voters. Ok.<eos> Well, you at least have one voter in your camp.<eos> Meeee! Only one that matters.<eos> Conklin may have had his difficulties, but he was a good man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was a good man who attacked me.<eos> Self-defense.<eos> As it was with her brother?<eos> I'm not saying it lacks irony.<eos> I need you a live, Mr. Queen, but there are different forms of alive.
Uh...<eos> Ppfff. Sorry.<eos> Could I-- could I talk to you for--for a minute?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Absolutely. - It's not really a good--<eos> - Felicity.<eos> - What?<eos> The photographer's right over there. We will make it there just fine by ourselves.<eos> Captain Lance.<eos> Nice to see you.
Well, let's, uh, talk about your alleged co-captive, Thea Queen.<eos> Isn't it true that 5 months ago, you helped her buy $74,000 worth of cocaine?<eos> And before you answer that, you should know that I have a signed affidavit from Ms. Queen's dealer right here.<eos> Which means nothing because it is irrelevant.<eos> Well, it goes to credibility, your honor.<eos> Oliver Queen publicly slandered my client by accusing him of ordering a terrorist drone strike.<eos> Now, if--if Mr. Diggle can work for Mr. Queen for free to help Ms. Queen buy illegal drugs, I mean, is it really that much of a stretch to believe that he'd also perjure himself in support of Mr. Queen's<eos> campaign of character assassination?<eos> You watched me swear an oath.<eos> And then I saw you break it.
It doesn't get any better than this.<eos> I was never in it for that, not ever.<eos> I wanted to make a difference, be a part of that beacon of hope you speak of.<eos> So come back.<eos> Rejoin the team.<eos> I think I figured out another way.<eos> It was actually that insane bee lady who gave me the idea, ironically... To remake this company to use the technology that helped me walk again to make people's lives better, to make Palmer Tech into the beacon of hope.<eos> Our mutual friends in HIVE have abandoned our other mutual friend Mr. Darhk, but he reached out to me, told me about you.<eos> He said you were his ace in the hole.<eos> Is that what you'd like me to call you, or do you prefer Mr. Diggle?
I sure am.<eos> - Ok. - All right.<eos> It's time.<eos> I know this feels personal, John, but it isn't.<eos> What's happening is just what has to happen.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it for Laurel.<eos> She'd be so disappointed in you.<eos> The only reason why you're still breathing is because one of us is still human.<eos> I'll hit you with a low dose of Darhk's magic, and then we'll take it up from there.
Ok.<eos> Excuse me. Are you a relati--<eos> Oliver, softly:<eos> Doctor, he's her father.<eos> I'm, um, terribly sorry for your loss.<eos> These are her belongings.<eos> I'll--I'll take care of those.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Baby.<eos> We should get you out of here.
There's no sign of Evelyn.<eos> So is the anti-vigilante task force, and they have come ready to play.<eos> We need to find that girl before they do.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm heading in.<eos> Ma'am, you shouldn't be in here.<eos> Funny.<eos> I was gonna tell you the same thing.<eos> The Black Canary is in the building.<eos> I need to get you to a secure location.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Kanjigar septum vohnostrum.<eos> Mr. Darhk will be held without bail or possibility of release.<eos> You may now call your organization and have that other message delivered.<eos> He said you were his ace in the hole.<eos> Is that what you'd like me to call you... Or do you prefer Mr. Diggle?
We worked hard to get to this moment, but now the real work begins to make this city great again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Queen, have time to answer a few questions?<eos> I'm not a candidate anymore.<eos> I'm just here to support the new mayor.<eos> So no comment on the write-in results?<eos> Uh, what write-in results?<eos> 48% of the electorate wrote in your brother's name on their ballots.<eos> That's a historic showing for a candidate who pulled out of the race.<eos> I'll let you and your former opponent catch up.

- No, no, no, no. You got to get to Iron Heights now.<eos> If Merlyn's not here, then that-- that means he's on his way there with the idol.<eos> If Darhk gets that idol, no prison will be able to hold him.<eos> One of these days, you're gonna tell me how you get in and out of here.<eos> A magician never reveals his secrets.<eos> So what next?<eos> You gonna make a coin appear from behind my ear?<eos> You know, you're awfully flippant for a man who's asked a great deal of me.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> Perhaps now's a good time to remind you of our terms.
I need to speak with him now!<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Yes, you can do that.<eos> You can do that.<eos> Go get--never mind.<eos> - I see him.<eos> - Sir!<eos> Pike!<eos> Hey!<eos> I see you overhere!
Not a bad warmup.<eos> It seems like you're ready for a rematch.<eos> Go get the others.<eos> I've got this.<eos> - No.<eos> Let me take him.<eos> - Go! Let's see how well I taught you.<eos> You know, the police took me seriously when I said I would start killing hostages if they moved upon the prison.<eos> It's too bad our masked vigilante friends didn't get the memo.<eos> Well, too bad for you really.
It is darkness.<eos> Taiana...<eos> She was coming to that darkness.<eos> They destroyed the plane.<eos> That was Reiter.<eos> But there's another way off the island.<eos> And here I thought you'd never use the comm gear I gave you to radio for a trip home.<eos> Well, I lost it for a while, and the job wasn't done.<eos> And now it is.<eos> I sent you here to break up Reiter's operation and free his prisoners.
No. No.<eos> That's just it.<eos> There aren't any small lies, hon.<eos> Take it from someone who had a child with a man who was a liar.<eos> I'm not Noah Kuttler.<eos> I know, honey, and that's why I love you.<eos> Ok?<eos> I love you...<eos> And that's why I have faith that... You're gonna do the right thing.<eos> Gentlemen, I have a little errand I need you to run, a loose end that needs tying up, not unlike...

No.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> All you can know for sure is that you're doing the right thing.<eos> [Elevator dings] Oh, Mr. Dennis.<eos> Ms. Smoak.<eos> You haven't returned my calls.<eos> Yes, I am sorry.<eos> I've been busy. So have I.<eos> Running your company.<eos> Do I need to remind you of your responsibilities to Palmer tech?
Color me shocked.<eos> I can't hack Rubicon with this setup, not in the time we have.<eos> I'm going to need the quantum subluminal processor you developed at Palmer tech.<eos> How did you even know that we...<eos> God help me if you are using the end of days to steal from my company again.<eos> I'm an excellent multitasker, but you can trust me this time.<eos> Dennis: Ms. Smoak.<eos> Oh! Mr. Dennis.<eos> Wow! You must be very desperate for me to talk to the board since you brought security to dragoon me.<eos> These men are not here to take you to the conference room.

Excuse me?<eos> The board has grave concerns about your plans to basically give away the biostimulant implant.<eos> - Mmm. - They wanted to discuss the matter with you.<eos> And I will talk to them.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> They voted to terminate you effective immediately.
He was gonna blow the scrubber no matter what you said.<eos> Can you disarm it?<eos> We'll soon find out.<eos> Clear!<eos> Noah: I'm gonna need the subnode taken offline.<eos> Ok. I can do that.<eos> I'll cover him.<eos> [Voice distorted] I'll take care of him.<eos> Get to work.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Actually, there was a direct-to-DVD sequel in 2008, but it was a bomb, too, so that reference still holds.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Me and your fugitive dad have got this.<eos> He says, just realizing he said that out loud.<eos> Today was supposed to be Christmas, and I woke up to a lump of coal.<eos> Is it because I've been naughty this year?<eos> It's because Kuttler and his daughter are wrestling us for Rubicon.<eos> Which is why I felt the need to up our game.<eos> Mr. Seldon, pleasure to see you.
- I think it's me. - I think-- LA Call Line.<eos> - I think he likes hearing sad things. - Oh, man.<eos> It was just a hang up.<eos> - Oh, that's all I get. - That's all I've ever had is crank call, - wrong call.<eos> - Most of us just get crank calls.<eos> - That's you now. - Go ahead, Maura.<eos> - C'est moi.<eos> LA Call Line, I'm here to help you. How can I help?<eos> I'm sorry, can you speak up? I can-<eos> - I can hardly hear you.
I have no idea what that is. What is that? It's a big mall, it's about two blocks that way.<eos> - Two blocks. - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Soul.<eos> Get your soul.<eos> Get some poetry in your life. Get the culture. Want the soul?<eos> You need some culture.<eos> Slauson soul. You don't have a soul without the soul.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can I ask you a question?
- Okay, there you go.<eos> There you go. - There it is. - Work, dog.<eos> - Thank you, thank you.<eos> - Look at it. - Ahh. - Boom.<eos> Bam.<eos> - You guys are great. - Thank you so much. - Okay.<eos> - Got you, man.<eos> All right. - Thank you.<eos> And that'll just be $2.<eos> - Okay. Hi. How can I help you?
I think I forgot-- I don't have my purse.<eos> I don't have my purse.<eos> I don't have my purse.<eos> Forgive me, I was just, uh--<eos> I needed to replenish my electrolytes and--<eos> But I think I know where it is.<eos> I think I left it at the, uh--<eos> I left it at the clinic. I'll just go and get it and, uh-- And I'll just retrieve it and I'll--<eos> I'll pay you your money. That's no problem.<eos> Yeah, just leave the drink, and I'll just hold it for you.
- Excuse me! - Elizah!<eos> - So now you just gonna walk away?<eos> - What the hell? - Hi.<eos> It's me. It's me!<eos> It's Maura.<eos> Don't-- You're fine, it's fine.<eos> It's me, it's Maura.<eos> Don't be scared. It's me from-- from the phone.<eos> You remember me? I thought those calls were anonymous.<eos> They are anonymous, but I-- I was really worried about you. Okay?
I'm gonna get you your money, I told you that.<eos> I don't care about the money, it's about the principle. You walk up in my store and you take shit because you think it's yours. - No.<eos> - Come here. - Can you loan me $2?<eos> - Call the police on him.<eos> - I didn't have a purse. - You need to come with me and exit the premises.<eos> Wait a minute, hold on, I'm not a criminal.<eos> You don't have to-- - You are a criminal because you stole that Gatorade.<eos> - I have to talk to my friend. - Do you need me to call the police on this man?<eos> - Hold on, hold on.<eos> - Just hold on. - Is he bothering you?
You want to just travel back through time 100 years to a world at war where people were paranoid and archaic?<eos> Cole can barely navigate 2016.<eos> I'm standing right here.<eos> That's why I'd like you to accompany him.<eos> You've seen the Messengers, seen their faces.<eos> You can identify them before they strike.<eos> The fight against the plague starts in 2016.<eos> The first battle may very well have been in 1944.<eos> I'm not a time traveler.<eos> Dr. Railly, I understand this is quite a change in dynamic... but he needs you to guide him through that world.
Your presence is affecting the balance of power in this facility.<eos> You're telling me that you can't stop Deacon from killing me.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> I've loved very few in my life...<eos> My father, a husband briefly, and my daughter... all three murdered by a disease in which you had a part.<eos> Why?<eos> To save the life of your child whom your barely knew?<eos> You created time travel. Save your daughter.<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> Understanding does not lessen my contempt for you.

Save your daughter.<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> Understanding does not lessen my contempt for you.<eos> My selfishness was in line with saving billions of lives.<eos> Yours was bent to destroy them.<eos> I cannot protect you here.
Cassandra won't forsake you.<eos> Do you know how important you are?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> How could you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You're gonna walk out that front door with your hands over your head and give yourself up.<eos> No, no.<eos> Tommy, the police will protect you.<eos> I had to protect you.
Their tethers are broken, and we have no way of bringing them back.<eos> We need you to go back to 1944, find them, and bring them home safely.<eos> You trust me now?<eos> I trust your relationship with Mr. Cole enough to know that you will help him.<eos> And you are the only traveler we have now.<eos> It will be dangerous.<eos> This is a much different time, and we're all at war.<eos> I know the 12 Monkeys are there as well and no doubt have something to do with the massive temporal disturbance.<eos> Paradox.<eos> See, I can send you back before that event.
Still not convincing.<eos> You're afraid about what I saw out there.<eos> What tore that guy apart.<eos> You have any answers as to why that's happening?<eos> All right.<eos> I can only fix one of your mistakes at a time.<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> 1944, here I come.<eos> The target is the Mission Cross Mental Asylum.<eos> We'll put you as close as we can to the 600 block of Oak Ridge Terrace, Jersey City.
I need to talk to them.<eos> Knock him out, he's not gonna tell you anything.<eos> He goes out, that wakes him up.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> We should've splintered by now.<eos> See, right there.<eos> You "should've splintered."<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> The reason we brought you here is we're in a huge shit storm because of you two.
You "should've splintered."<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> The reason we brought you here is we're in a huge shit storm because of you two.<eos> So before things get all complicated with lawyers and judges, we gotta get this right.<eos> Let's have it, honey.<eos> I'm honey.<eos> She's babycakes.<eos> You got tangled up with the wrong guy.<eos> It happens, but he's put you in a situation here.

Just... just shut up and listen.<eos> Open your mind.<eos> You are not just a scientist.<eos> You are an explorer.<eos> You're pushing boundaries.<eos> Inventing the new. You're not just analyzing the old.<eos> That's what makes you you, Katarina.<eos> Oh, time is cruel.<eos> Because of that, you don't know me.<eos> But, boy, I know you, and you are lost, and you're scared.
Who told you that, your spy?<eos> Stacy was there to watch over you.<eos> Ensure your safety. I'm tied to a chair.<eos> Epic fail.<eos> Get her out of here.<eos> Dr. Railly.<eos> We have unfinished business.<eos> We're going on another trip to see the Witness?<eos> Good.<eos> I can't wait to tell him about how I burned your virus and set you back years.
- My hero.<eos> It's either that or Jonesey sends me back in time to save your ass again.<eos> You're crazy about me.<eos> Just admit it.<eos> What about the girl?<eos> I strongly recommend not getting involved.<eos> You mean let her die?<eos> I mean don't alter time any more than we already have.<eos> The temporal scanners have been recalibrated.<eos> I can put you at the proper coordinates within seconds of each other.
- The Witness?<eos> - Mm-hmm. If that's true you were wise not to follow him, Traveler.<eos> 1975 is as good a year as any to die, Traveler.<eos> All right, you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need to borrow your car keys.<eos> You need to get the hell out of here.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You go home, you take care of your boy.<eos> Your life ain't about you anymore.
I'm having the strangest sensation.<eos> It's like I'm ten years old again.<eos> You do a lot of space travel as a kid, Professor?<eos> Only in my dreams, after I read my first issue of "Rick Starr:<eos> Space Ranger."<eos> Space Ranger Stein?<eos> Yeah, I don't see it.<eos> I wanted to travel through space, surviving only by my wits and laser guns.<eos> I even built a rocket out of cardboard boxes.<eos> What stopped you?
Don't mean to rush you, Raymond, but it's getting cold in here.<eos> Normally I wouldn't complain, but...<eos> Can't you just open the doors, Gideon?<eos> The bulkhead is designed to remain shut until the breach is sealed.<eos> Well, that's not happening from in here.<eos> How much time do we have until...<eos> We're dead?<eos> Captain Baxter.<eos> I'm Rip Hunter.<eos> I'm here to rescue you.
How much time do we have until...<eos> We're dead?<eos> Captain Baxter.<eos> I'm Rip Hunter.<eos> I'm here to rescue you.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> You walked straight into a trap.<eos> I will admit that we've encountered some... unforeseen obstacles.<eos> Right.<eos> But, we're gonna get you out of here in a second.
But, we're gonna get you out of here in a second.<eos> Mr. Jackson, will you please see what we can do about disabling this force field?<eos> You don't think I've tried that?<eos> But by all means, if you think this kid will have better luck.<eos> - Whoa, who you callin' kid?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I meant criminal.<eos> - Actually, that's me.<eos> All of you.<eos> If we ever do get out of here, the first thing I'll do is take you to the Vanishing Point to await trial before the Time Council.
I don't want help from a man who broke his oath, stole a timeship, and decided to change history for his own selfish reasons.<eos> Doesn't make any sense to me.<eos> No, I don't expect it would.<eos> Rip Hunter.<eos> Miranda Coburn.<eos> Those aren't your real names, are they?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because if our enemies knew our true identities, our ancestors and descendants across the timeline could be potential targets.<eos> As well as anyone else you might love.
Can anyone hear me?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Me and the pirates are gonna have a little parlay.<eos> - Do not do this, Rory.<eos> - Too late.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to speak to Captain Valor.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About a timeship.<eos> - I am warning you.
But failing to save my family?<eos> That is something for which I will never forgive myself.<eos> Time Master Declan, I... I thought the tribunal was re-convening.<eos> It's been cancelled.<eos> Lieutenant Coburn assumed full responsibility for the affair.<eos> The other Time Masters were moved by her argument.<eos> They've dismissed the charges?<eos> Once Lieutenant Coburn resigned.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - It seems she believes in you.
Yeah.<eos> Time to choose a side, I guess.<eos> Chosen.<eos> - Bastard! - Go!<eos> - Get them! - Go!<eos> I'll get the time drive.<eos> Is the Acheron's jump ship still operational? - All right, go to it and get off the Acheron.<eos> I have some unfinished business with Mr. Valor.<eos> I'm not leaving my ship.<eos> And we're not leaving you behind.
Th-the money, photograph, address, and the key to the house.<eos> - And a floor plan.<eos> - Yes, the floor plan, of course.<eos> So... are we good?<eos> Are we good?<eos> I-I just mean, is that all?<eos> I haven't told you how you will help me.<eos> Help you?<eos> No, no, no, I can't help.<eos> I need you to distract your wife so I can get inside.
And if you open another one, you're gonna pour that down the drain, you stupid...<eos> I am the best me I can be.<eos> Where are you, Nate?<eos> Nate?<eos> I left something in one of the rooms, and I lost the master key card.<eos> Call me as soon as you get this.<eos> It's an emergency.<eos> You will go out with your son tomorrow morning at 10:00.<eos> You're going to find Daphne on the floor beside the sink, neck broken like she slipped. It happens all the time.<eos> Your husband has hired a man to kill you.
- I got these.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> What do I owe you?<eos> These are on me.<eos> Sorry for the wait.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> What?<eos> You'll think I'm awful.<eos> Maybe I already think you're awful.
I'll see you tonight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need a car.<eos> Your car is waiting right here, ma'am, right here, right here.<eos> Let 619 know their car service is running about five minutes late, okay?<eos> Five minutes.<eos> 712 Hamlet Court.<eos> I'm sorry, but I need you to speed.<eos> Stop the car.<eos> I take you all the way.
I take you all the way.<eos> I don't want you to take me all the way.<eos> See you in a little bit, honey.<eos> All right, let's get in the car.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're Daphne?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do we know each other?<eos> No, but there's a man coming here to kill you.
A little bit.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> His name is Javier.<eos> Your husband hired him.<eos> You should go.<eos> - Chase.<eos> - What?<eos> Your husband's name is Chase, right?<eos> Chase gave Javier a floor plan, a key to your house, a photo of you, and $50,000 to kill you.

He'll ask you to go upstairs and check his bedside table.<eos> Can we take the car in the driveway?<eos> I-I'm not leaving with you.<eos> By the time your husband calls, it'll be too late.<eos> The point of the phone call is to get you upstairs so that Javier can break in and kill you.
May I get something out of my pocket?<eos> Slowly.<eos> The 4Runner in the driveway is new.<eos> There is a bag with fif... $50,000 in cash and all the info you need to kill Daphne.<eos> Take the car. Take the money.<eos> What, and you just kill Daphne anyway?<eos> Yes.<eos> Letty, go.<eos> Ever feel like you crossed a line you didn't see?<eos> Did my husband pay you to kill me?
Yes.<eos> Letty, go.<eos> Ever feel like you crossed a line you didn't see?<eos> Did my husband pay you to kill me?<eos> Daphne...<eos> Why?<eos> I've no idea.<eos> But I am sure you do.<eos> G-Give it to me.<eos> I could kill you right this second.
Why?<eos> I've no idea.<eos> But I am sure you do.<eos> G-Give it to me.<eos> I could kill you right this second.<eos> Daphne, Daphne, calm down.<eos> Drop the keys on the floor.<eos> Take them. Get out of here.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - The police are coming. They'll arrest you, too.

I thought we agreed on full disclosure.<eos> You want to see my X-rays?<eos> I'll put them in a nice frame for ya.<eos> I'm talking about this gin joint out in the middle of no man's land.<eos> You promised me you'd show me the base without any three-hour fly-arounds this time.<eos> We need to talk first. I'll talk.<eos> You listen.<eos> I'm here because the president sent me.<eos> The Sokovia Accords are law of the land now.<eos> He's concerned you may have some undocumented Enhanced Assets working for you.
End of the line, inhuman.<eos> There's nowhere left to run.<eos> I suppose there's always hell.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> A real hot dog.<eos> But seriously, who follows a stranger down a dark alley dressed as pups?<eos> I mean, on principle alone, I can't let this end well for ya.<eos> Leaving so soon?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm the one who invited you.
You're all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Help is on its way.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What have I done?<eos> I think you overcooked them, doc.<eos> How can I trust you when you can't even keep track of your own Inhumans?<eos> That's two of them you've lost.<eos> I should've left you in the bar.
There's something I want to show you.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> They're part of us.<eos> Our children, really, from our own flesh and blood, and we're gonna make more of them.<eos> So we'll need more blood.<eos> How much?<eos> All of it.<eos> Daisy's out of the system.<eos> That's good news, because I'm gonna call the president and have that thing shot out of the sky.<eos> I'm afraid I can't let you make that call.
Even though I wanted to, I never trusted Daisy -- not under Hive's control.<eos> I knew that she wouldn't be the one to greet me, no matter what she said.<eos> But what about the other risks?<eos> Lash could kill Daisy.<eos> Did you stop to think about that?<eos> It's a risk we had to take.<eos> But he had the opportunity once before, and he let her go.<eos> I don't think he's meant to kill her.<eos> Who put him on the Quinjet?<eos> I did while Coulson was keeping you distracted.
Violent psychotics.<eos> That part of the tour is worth skipping.<eos> Coming!<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Welcome to the neighborhood.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much, Miss...<eos> Mrs. Knox.<eos> Gail Knox, and this is my husband, Curtis.<eos> Lovely to meet you.
Then he'll kill you.<eos> Thank you for the vote of confidence, but I don't need your protection.<eos> There's no reason to go alone.<eos> We're part of a team for a reason.<eos> Yes, and the team seems comfortable with me doing this, so that makes it about you and me.<eos> - Any updates?<eos> - We're making progress.<eos> In the meantime, we need to get ready to back Kendra up.<eos> She's going into the asylum to meet Savage tonight.<eos> Another opportunity for you to see Nurse Carlisle.

These delicious baked goods after a member of the Hapsburg Monarchy, which is an affront to anyone who ever fought a Hessian.<eos> So, what is in a name?<eos> Apparently, nothing.<eos> Lox?<eos> Okay, this is obviously way more than just hunger.<eos> Spill it, Crane.<eos> Oh, Crane.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> This is insane.<eos> Immigration can't reject you as a citizen.
This is insane.<eos> Immigration can't reject you as a citizen.<eos> You helped create the country.<eos> Yes, the irony is not lost.<eos> Well, wait, it says here you were rejected because you missed your formal interview.<eos> Yes, I was a little preoccupied rescuing your sister from the Catacombs.<eos> We just, we throw Joe's money at the problem.<eos> Hire you a top-gun lawyer.<eos> Scary, expensive lawyer. Nice suit.<eos> In the meantime, I have a new word for you.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Crane, hey...<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was a little distracted.<eos> By that symbol.<eos> One you clutch in your hand even now.<eos> You were drawn to it, Lieutenant.<eos> It has a hold on you.
That would mean...<eos> The Catacombs, the year of solitude...<eos> No sleep, no way to dream...<eos> There was no escaping it.<eos> I was in my head the whole time, in a bad place, and then, one day, that's when I saw it, on the temple wall.<eos> I started drawing it, tracing it...<eos> It gave me peace.<eos> Gives me peace.<eos> When soldiers return from war, they do what they need to carry on.<eos> I almost let you die.
Quickly, it's close.<eos> Praise be to he who has long been hidden.<eos> Praise be to one true God above all.<eos> With the fire of the gods, the primal gold shall be made consecrate.<eos> With the fire of the heavens, I shall bring forth the Sands of Life.<eos> Who's the true master of lightning now, Benjamin?<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> You survived my venom.<eos> It appears I made the same mistake your mentor did:<eos> underestimated you.
I shan't repeat the same mistake.<eos> I choose him as my master.<eos> I bow as his faithful servant and bring forth the very Sands of Life!<eos> Leeds!<eos> Beautiful, isn't it?<eos> It's folly!<eos> Franklin would laugh at such adolescent parlor tricks.<eos> I know what you're trying to do, Crane... goad me into jealousy.<eos> You think your delusions of grandeur will set you apart.<eos> Your master will enslave you as surely as the rest of us.
Are we getting a sub?<eos> Yeah, me.<eos> That good with everyone? Absolutely.<eos> Good, let's get going.<eos> No, this isn't gonna be awkward at all.<eos> I got to say, I've never been an outdoors-y type.<eos> Closest I ever got to camping was watching Friday the 13th movies.<eos> Yeah, I didn't spend much time in the wild either.<eos> Until I had to.<eos> You mind if I ask you something?
Lieutenant, please.<eos> I'm making that face again, aren't I?<eos> Good news is we've knocked that thing back twice now, so it should lay low for a while.<eos> That explains why it was sealed up in that well.<eos> There was no other way to get rid of the thing.<eos> Wait, that explains something else, too.<eos> I took a closer look at those photos and found another phrase: "There is no end."<eos> Look...<eos> I know you said the supernatural has taken a lot from you, but you gotta remember the supernatural has given you a lot of good, too.<eos> It led you to Crane.
Quick and nimble.<eos> Quick and nimble.<eos> Sophie! He's heading your way!<eos> I lost it!<eos> The answer to this might be self-evident, but... how is your survival exercise?<eos> We survived.<eos> So, you could see me just by touching the symbol?<eos> Not only that, I could feel your presence, as if I were in the very room with you.<eos> And that's how you found us?<eos> No, once I saw you in peril, I needed to determine a way to locate you.

The Blavatsky Map. Able to track demonic presence.<eos> I simply followed it to the creature that bedeviled you.
Um... supernatural brought a lot of good people into my life.<eos> And I don't just mean Crane.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's the symbol, Crane.<eos> This whole time I thought<eos> I was succumbing to darkness, and... it's not at all what we thought it was.<eos> I know, it is confusing.<eos> We thought the symbol was tormenting you, when, in fact, it was here to help us.
She?<eos> Pandora. I found her in the Masonic Cell, searching for pieces of her Box.<eos> She told me that the Hidden One is approaching full power, and we have but 48 hours before he destroys all of humanity.<eos> And she needs her Box to stop him. Yes.<eos> But... the Box can only be regenerated in the Catacombs.<eos> You want to go to the Catacombs?<eos> It appears it is our only option.<eos> If you believe Pandora.<eos> Lieutenant, you once allied yourself with her.<eos> To save you.
We also know that Betsy Ross, at some point, was there, and she discerned a way out.<eos> Now, the last time I saw Revere and Betsy together was Christmas Day, 1776... with Washington's forces as they prepared to launch an attack on the Hessians in New Jersey.<eos> The crossing of the Delaware.<eos> You were a part of that mission?<eos> No. Washington ordered me to stay behind, a decision with which I heartily disagreed.<eos> So, there I was, stood on the riverbank watching the launch.<eos> The fog was so thick, I lost sight of them as soon as they left the shore.<eos> The fog, as in a mystical fog?<eos> Possibly.<eos> What if Washington asked you to stay back because they weren't going to New Jersey?
I daresay, if all goes well today, this may very well be how I'm remembered.<eos> After all the missions, this flag may be my greatest accomplishment.<eos> Betsy, I'm certain you are wrong there.<eos> And even if it were it really is beautiful.<eos> Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.<eos> The original Stars and Stripes.<eos> She told me she was not going on the mission.<eos> Clearly, she did.<eos> Well, she knew you'd just worry.<eos> She must have cared about you a lot.
Key wrote those words at Fort McHenry in Baltimore.<eos> Road trip?<eos> We'll meet you there. I have some ideas on how to deal with your tar monster, but I got to pick up some equipment.<eos> Without the protection of the Masonic Cell, we must keep moving or face detection by...<eos> Danny.<eos> - What are you doing here? - I just got a call from an angry historian, saying one of my agents wrecked a national monument.<eos> I can explain that.<eos> What were you doing in Boston?<eos> And why does he have to be with you everywhere you go?<eos> - Agent Reynolds... - I wasn't asking you.
I can explain that.<eos> What were you doing in Boston?<eos> And why does he have to be with you everywhere you go?<eos> - Agent Reynolds... - I wasn't asking you.<eos> I was talking to her. I gave you space, Abs, and I think I've been more than patient.<eos> - You have.<eos> - But there are consequences...<eos> FBI!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Danny... I'm warning you, not another step.
I was wondering how you and Mills got so close so quickly.<eos> Not long.<eos> I got clued in when we were hunting for Mills.<eos> I was... exposed to some weird stuff and... Crane got me up to speed. Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Tell you what?<eos> That... that Mills was trapped in a mystical dimension and we had to battle demons from Hell to get her back?<eos> 'Cause I'm not sure how that would have looked on my quarterly evaluation, you know?<eos> Yeah, I'm not just your boss. I'm your friend.<eos> Yeah, you are, and as your friend,<eos> I wanted to protect you.
This was left in my family tomb.<eos> It depicts Napalatu... my ancient enemies and your forebearers.<eos> It also allows a remote connection between them. Perhaps more.<eos> If I am trapped, the lieutenant is searching for a way to release me.<eos> She is doomed to failure.<eos> Unless she sought help, as I would... from someone with the knowledge of the Emblem of Thura.<eos> Pandora would never stoop to a partnership with a lowly mortal.<eos> Humor me.<eos> What if they did form an alliance?<eos> What method would Pandora employ to release you?
These five-pointed stars they practically shimmer.<eos> An illusion, created with a little gold thread.<eos> I daresay if all goes well today, this may very well be how I'm remembered.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Apologies.<eos> I can drive.<eos> No, no, no, no, apologies.<eos> My mind was elsewhere.<eos> Let me guess, December 1776.<eos> Crane, Washington cut you out of a mission that could have changed the tide of the war.
Well, she was occasionally rather pushy.<eos> Prone to talking with a mouth full of food.<eos> George Washington?<eos> Well, now there was a great man... but a great man with legendary halitosis.<eos> I really beat those guys?<eos> Oh... handily.<eos> You... never waiver in your faith.<eos> In what we do.<eos> In me. And you know how rare that is, don't you?<eos> When it concerns you and me, Lieutenant, there is no greater certainty.
I don't care if his real name is the Hidden One, I want eyes on him.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> All right, the rest of you are with me.<eos> All right.<eos> Seems to be some kind of portal or gateway to the Catacombs themselves.<eos> I'm really going back there.<eos> Only this time you're not alone, and we have a way out.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I have eyes on him.<eos> Yeah, just make sure he doesn't have eyes on you.
We may not get another chance at this.<eos> I said negative.<eos> Stick to the plan.<eos> Say again?<eos> You're breaking up.<eos> Got them.<eos> Tell Joe good job.<eos> Get back here ASAP.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Mr. Mills, what brings you here?
We panic now, we're playing into his hands.<eos> He's right.<eos> No one... no place is safe until my husband has been dealt with.<eos> Finish your task.<eos> As soon as the last spike is planted, the energy in the ley lines will be summoned, and the disturbance will then occur.<eos> And where are you going?<eos> We need more time.<eos> I will try and give us as much as I can.<eos> No, no, you've helped enough.<eos> We can protect you from him.
Seems like a good fit.<eos> If that's where they plan to do it, they'll be there ahead of you.<eos> Yes.<eos> The silo's staff went silent five hours ago.<eos> Sir, the warhead is in place, and the missile is armed.<eos> The man who starts the launch sequence -- is he willing to cooperate?<eos> Yep.<eos> Turned out to be a real team player.<eos> What about S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> I've warned you about cloaking.
We're looking for the freight dock on the north side.<eos> Even if you infiltrate, you can't shut down the launch -- not without government Kill Codes.<eos> - We are aware.<eos> - Hand-delivered by a D.O.D. official.<eos> It's not hackable.<eos> You won't be --<eos> We are aware.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> I'm asking you for one Missile Launch Kill Code, General.
I should wake up every morning and feel like this, remembering every drop of blood I spilled.<eos> Do you still have the memory machine?<eos> You used it on that Strucker kid.<eos> - Daisy, stop.<eos> - Put me in it.<eos> I bet you're already thinking about doing that, right, to jog my memory.<eos> So bring it in here.<eos> Make it my bed and keep every memory, every detail right at the surface, where it belongs.<eos> That's enough.<eos> We pulled the memory machine out of storage, but it's not for you.
"You wouldn't like me if you knew."<eos> Sir?<eos> Focus.<eos> Let us help you.<eos> "I am not a good man, Skye."<eos> He wanted a connection -- a connection with her.<eos> You can't ever get attached to anyone -- to anyone or anything.<eos> You have to fight that weakness in you.<eos> Fight that weakness!<eos> You have to fight... that weakness...inside of you.
Disconnect what?<eos> Disconnect the warhead... for absolution.<eos> So, you got that?<eos> Do you want to fill a brother in?<eos> "I just wanted to save you."<eos> Save you.<eos> I gave you a fighting chance to find a way out... find a way out... to find a way out, like you always do...always do.<eos> "Like you did.<eos> You want me to cross them off?"<eos> Did S.H.I.E.L.D. send you?
Hey, help!<eos> They're trapped inside.<eos> Can we override the doors?<eos> We put everything on lockdown.<eos> By the time we override, Fitz will be...<eos> Fitz, do you read?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Sir, I'm in a bit of trouble!<eos> We know.<eos> We're gonna get you out of there.
- Miss Kearney?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Type an order.<eos> You, follow me.<eos> FRANCES:<eos> The world now knows of our stand, Mr Connolly, sir.<eos> Let's hope the signal got further than Liverpool.<eos> Looks like Liverpool have got something for us,<eos> British reinforcements.<eos> A task for you, Jimmy.
You, follow me.<eos> FRANCES:<eos> The world now knows of our stand, Mr Connolly, sir.<eos> Let's hope the signal got further than Liverpool.<eos> Looks like Liverpool have got something for us,<eos> British reinforcements.<eos> A task for you, Jimmy.<eos> I know you've itching for action and there's been little here as yet.<eos> You're to take the orders direct to Lieutenant Malone.<eos> Frances here will show you.
He knows who they are.<eos> I'm afraid he might cause a scene, or worse.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The money lender.<eos> INGRID: Elizabeth.<eos> I'll be with you in a moment, Ingrid.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> MAN: Attention.<eos> Private.<eos> I could have you court-martialled.
- The money lender.<eos> INGRID: Elizabeth.<eos> I'll be with you in a moment, Ingrid.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> MAN: Attention.<eos> Private.<eos> I could have you court-martialled.<eos> You should be ashamed to stand beside these men.<eos> Instead, they're looking for people to shift the dead from the streets.<eos> I volunteered you, Private, since you're not up to real soldiering.
The trouble you and your Mr Pearse have caused.<eos> I'm ashamed, that's what I am.<eos> What are you dressed like?<eos> Sometimes I wonder if you're my sister's child at all.<eos> Come in and I'll feed you.<eos> It's good of the doctor to come.<eos> You may sit.<eos> He said they'd been working around the clock because of the rebellion and it's a relief to know that your illness is merely a natural consequence of your condition.<eos> Three months gone, he reckoned.<eos> It's funny, I took you for an adventuress, not a cheap whore.
A handshake, a smile, and it's over.<eos> Just like high school.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> -Maria.<eos> Hi. I'm Shane.<eos> -Oh, my gosh. Wow.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I know what you were thinking.<eos> Asking you to go to Switch Hitters...
That is correct.<eos> But had we known about this surgeon, in the time it would have taken to be janked around and rejected by insurance, my husband would have died on the table!<eos> But then you wouldn't owe $35,000.<eos> Look, my husband had a heart attack.<eos> If he sees this bill he's going to have another, which can't happen, because he's got to get healthy because there's some stuff<eos> I need to process with him-- that I can't talk about-- but let's just say some shit is going down!<eos> What if we refuse to pay?<eos> Interesting question.<eos> No one's ever been clever enough to try that before.<eos> Actually, the hospital will sue you and come after your wages.
- That's me on the dance floor. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, that is me about to get into the swing again. -Wow.<eos> Mm. -And this is Carlos.<eos> Are those shorts or underwear?<eos> Uh, Carlos doesn't wear underwear.<eos> -Sol, you've got to look at Carlos.<eos> -Nah, I'm good.<eos> -You boys like bingo?<eos> -He loves it.<eos> Then when you're all better, I'm taking you to Drag Queen Bingo!
-Sol, you've got to look at Carlos.<eos> -Nah, I'm good.<eos> -You boys like bingo?<eos> -He loves it.<eos> Then when you're all better, I'm taking you to Drag Queen Bingo!<eos> I'm sure someone's sleeping somewhere.<eos> Oh, none of my patients.<eos> We play, we drink, we sing show tunes.<eos> -I love show tunes. -Yeah.<eos> Who is that spanking you?
Uh, not till he's cleared.<eos> Cleared?<eos> Of... of what?<eos> Oh, don't worry about it.<eos> We'll get it handled.<eos> [Jace] Clary, I'm sorry.<eos> I apologize. I just want you to know it only happened, like... two or...<eos> It just happened a couple of times and I am totally-- [both] Shut up.<eos> Babe, come on.<eos> Listen, you don't get to call her "babe," okay?
I've got a great plan.<eos> Oh, there's a first.<eos> [laughs sarcastically] Just follow my lead.<eos> Oh, and don't worry, in my plan, no one gets slapped.<eos> Thanks, Jerry.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> We're done for today.<eos> But don't go too far. You'll be hearing from me.<eos> I wouldn't dream of it.<eos> Listen, Garroway, do you think I'm trying to be a pain in your ass?
He's on our side. You sure?<eos> Isn't that the line he used when he kidnapped you?<eos> Good point.<eos> What now? We're supposed to climb the elevator shaft and waltz in the vault unnoticed?<eos> Now, why didn't I think of that?<eos> Wait, you're kidding, right?<eos> Remember the binoculars? Yeah.<eos> This one's a Nyx rune.<eos> It's like night vision.<eos> You can copy mine.
Just so you know, at any one time, there could be up to 30 people on the waiting list, so it's always best to keep your options open.<eos> - Hop on a few lists.<eos> - Right, right.<eos> But there's just no other place like this one close by.<eos> His mother runs a business in the area, so he really needs to be in here.<eos> Um... My, uh, my mom was, uh... she was in and out of these places, so I know how it works.<eos> Um, always a bed for a... a senator's kid or some CEO's son.<eos> I'm... I'm failing to understand.<eos> Well, there should be enough here for the first two months' stay.<eos> And some for you.
Harry!<eos> Get back here.<eos> Sorry, he's excited to see people.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> We just saw your light come on. We were on the water.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Travis.<eos> Travis Manawa.<eos> George Geary.<eos> What can I do for you, Travis Manawa?
Hmm.<eos> Your $10 million boat. - What?<eos> - You said "a $10 million boat"<eos> like this boat is not yours.<eos> It's mine.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> I'm curious, though.<eos> Who are you planning on leaving behind?<eos> I bring you to my house, take you on my boat...
We should be leaving soon.<eos> It's a short trip.<eos> Melissa, the light.<eos> The light you turned on last night.<eos> Was that an accident?<eos> That was just a mistake. It's a stupid habit.<eos> Once is a mistake.<eos> Twice?<eos> Were you signaling us?<eos> I saw you from the pier last night.

The kind of chance they're not gonna have if they stay here.<eos> When I saw you come to shore, I turned on the light.<eos> I thought you said the island was safe.<eos> No, we're just biding our time.<eos> Biding our time till it's over.<eos> Come with us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm not well.<eos> I have MS. It's...<eos> I'm not gonna die tomorrow, but it's not a weight you need. - It's not a weight my children need.

Do you promise to love, honor, and protect her in sickness and in health till death do you part?<eos> I do.<eos> Norma, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> Do you promise to love, honor, and protect him, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you have the rings?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, I've got hers, Connie.<eos> Mine just... It's getting adjusted.<eos> By the authority vested in me by the state of Oregon, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
And I try to help navigate. Yeah, how do you imagine that I am driving anything here?<eos> You committed yourself, Norman.<eos> Do you not want to be here?<eos> No.<eos> My mother made me.<eos> She wants me to be here.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> She spoke to me about you before you had been admitted.<eos> Oh, oh, so she was planning all of this, then?<eos> I think she was just very worried about you.
- Yeah, okay. We have 3 hours, 52 minutes to find her and stop Reverse-Flash.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Spivot.<eos> - Hey. Can't get away from those case files, huh?<eos> Oh, just following up on a hunch.<eos> You're gonna miss the action, right?<eos> Maybe.<eos> A little.<eos> - I'm gonna miss you.<eos> - Miss you too.
Just bring him in!<eos> Get the cell ready.<eos> Hey, he can't...?<eos> Phase his way out?<eos> No, he can't do that.<eos> It's the same cell we used to hold Dr. Wells last year.<eos> Barry, where you going?<eos> - I'm going down there.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> The more he learns about you, the more you will alter the time line.
Why can't you just tell me? Because you need to see for yourself.<eos> How'd you get your suit in your ring?<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Cisco Ramon.<eos> And we know each other well, don't we?<eos> We have a history together.<eos> You could say that.<eos> And that's all you want to know?<eos> How I got my suit in my ring?<eos> I want you to know that I'm the one who figured out you were back.

Okay, all right, look.<eos> I destroyed the tachyon drive in the speed machine.<eos> There's no way it'll reach a speed necessary to send him back home. - You can.<eos> - What?<eos> Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed, that'll be enough to catapult him through the time continuum. You can do it.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Time to send you home.
No, I came up with a different method.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Who are you?<eos> No one of consequence.<eos> No. I doubt that.<eos> I win again, Flash.<eos> All you have to do is provide him with enough momentum to get him past the space-time barrier.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Hey, listen to me.<eos> Thawne knows about you.
Go ahead.<eos> But that hurt stays in there with you.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Listen, I may not always show it, but I --<eos> May!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> If you kill me, you'll die.<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear.<eos> I have a weapon in place on this plane that's designed to kill you.
Didn't see anything.<eos> I'm telling the truth, I swear.<eos> You won't see it.<eos> - Show me. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, just let me put this down.<eos> Remember, we don't want to hurt you if we don't have to.<eos> People that are under sway -- they're not in control of their actions.<eos> They're not bad people.<eos> Well, except you.
- What about the underground tunnels?<eos> - Sealed shut.<eos> I have a way.<eos> Hey.<eos> Who came up with --<eos> Fitz was inspired by your work, put a few new tricks up my sleeve.<eos> - Remote Quinjet?<eos> - Hell yeah.<eos> It's on its way, but let's be clear.<eos> I'll get you to medical, to safety, we'll contact Talbot, have him authorize military force to take back our base, but then I take the Quinjet to intercept the Zephyr on my own.
I know exactly what happens next.<eos> You came alone.<eos> I gave the order for the others to stay behind.<eos> I don't need anymore agents dying for my lapses in judgment.<eos> So you acknowledge that you'll die.<eos> I'm prepared to.<eos> If you plan on blowing this plane up with both of us onboard, it won't end this.<eos> Millions will still be turned.<eos> Yeah, they won't be handsome, but at least they won't be swayed and stuck with your winning personality.<eos> I'll end you first.

In fact, lost friends over it.<eos> Even good old Agent Blake said my policy on the matter made him sick.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> A few stowaways, yeah.<eos> Probably already made their presence felt.<eos> I'm just here to offer a helping hand.<eos> Pun absolutely intended.<eos> Or have you given me exactly what I need to finally defeat them?<eos> Your body.<eos> I'll shed this host and take you and march down to announce to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that I finally succeeded in defeating the great Alveus.
I was treated as a pariah back home.<eos> Do you like animals?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your dad made this.<eos> It's a robin. Like you.<eos> She's here.<eos> All units move in.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> You've been a real friend.<eos> I actually wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine.
why did they leave us?<eos> He's timejumping the ship.<eos> The ladies will be left in 1958.<eos> - What about Ray?<eos> - Like I said.<eos> Let's go!<eos> We have to stop him!<eos> Gideon, open the doors on my mark.<eos> Get to the Jumpship and escape.<eos> We are not abandoning you.
Our lucky water vase?<eos> Lucky water vase?<eos> Yeah, it's a long but endearing story.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Don't you care about anything that we left behind?<eos> Yes, but I don't think that I need to go back to the apartment to get any of our old junk.<eos> Old junk?<eos> We lived there this morning.<eos> We certainly can't leave Raymond's exo-suit back in 1960.<eos> I'll accompany you back to your apartment.
Sara, what the hell?<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> Yeah, I'm starting to get that.<eos> We came here to rescue you.<eos> I don't need to be rescued.<eos> I've found peace here.<eos> Peace with the League of Assassins?<eos> That must be the first time that sentence has ever been uttered.<eos> Oh, I can't believe I'm back here.<eos> If this is retribution of some kind for stranding you in 1958...
Yes, well, if that is her wish, we will indeed honor it.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> But your deaths will make that concession irrelevant.<eos> Well, according to my understanding of League Law, the whole death thing can be avoided, should we prevail at trial.<eos> Yeah, I don't think these guys are the "People's Court" type.<eos> I demand a trial by combat.<eos> And how is a man such as you so well-versed on our traditions?<eos> Do we have an accord?<eos> May victory be yours.<eos> I was under the impression that I would be fighting you.
What is it about society that disappoints you so much?
How much will the co-pay be?<eos> Well, that's something you need to discuss with the billing department.<eos> - We'll talk about that later...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You've lost your job.<eos> We have no money.<eos> How are we supposed to pay for this on top of all your other bills?<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> I told you, there won't be any bills.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Alderson, please, I'm going to have to ask you to step outside for a second.
I have a place in Greenwich, but you don't expect me to...<eos> How long is it gonna take before this all gets fixed?<eos> The tracking on her phone is working, and she's headed north as we speak.<eos> How long you think she's gonna stay away for?<eos> Long enough.<eos> The collective result of these attacks could be a cyber Pearl Harbor, physical destruction and the loss of life, and create a new, profound sense of vulnerability.<eos> As director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, I have understood that cyber attacks...<eos> I hope you don't mind I came.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> It's good to see you, Gideon.
- Chad? - Ha-ha!<eos> - You're so fucking me right now, man.<eos> - All right, I got a friend, but... Stop it.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> What is Rebirth?<eos> Uh, let me tell you about Rebirth.<eos> I think Rebirth, it's about getting out of your rut.<eos> It's about getting in touch with yourself. With your body.<eos> We live in a "one life fits all" culture.<eos> And Rebirth dares you to find the life for you.
Set your alarm a few hours before your shuttle's departure time and practice the series of power poses shown earlier in this video.<eos> Breathe.<eos> What?<eos> You are now centering your intentions for the day's journey and are fully prepared.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I couldn't find you guys.
Please give a big Rebirth welcome to Jesse.<eos> Rebirth, Rebirth, Rebirth.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> My friend, Zack, signed me up for this.<eos> I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.<eos> Can I just see if he's here maybe? Or...?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why am I doing what?<eos> Why did you make me leave?<eos> - I didn't make you leave. - Are you serious?
The whole reason I'm here.<eos> Okay, okay, I'm going.<eos> So, that's the reason you're here?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Is there something else?<eos> Would you like there to be something else?<eos> I don't know. What else is there to do?<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> I've never been to one of these things before. Why don't you tell me?<eos> Why don't you ask me the question you really wanna ask?

Why don't you tell me?<eos> Why don't you ask me the question you really wanna ask?<eos> Okay, well, what is...? What question is that?<eos> Why did I single you out? Okay, okay, why did you single me out?
Okay, well, what is...? What question is that?<eos> Why did I single you out? Okay, okay, why did you single me out?<eos> Why do you think I singled you out?<eos> Because I'm the new guy and you guys wanna do something to me?<eos> Do you wanna do something to me?<eos> No, no.<eos> I don't... I don't... I wasn't...<eos> I don't... I mean, what?<eos> I...<eos> Is that okay with you?
- Zachariah, stop it.<eos> Your friend can't help it.<eos> He's not a Birthling.<eos> What did we talk about?<eos> Your friend is not a Birthling. You can't be expecting him to have the insight...<eos> Sir, I believe in a peaceful revolution through massage and the...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop with your brainwashing bullshit.<eos> I'm not listening.<eos> I can't hear you.
Yes, I know what it is.<eos> What is it doing here in a pile?<eos> My instructions were clear.<eos> The clock is to be placed in that corner.<eos> The dining room table in the dining room with the chairs surrounding it.<eos> Yes, my foreman had your instructions. - I told him there must be some mistake.<eos> - Mistake? General Arnold, as commissioner of forfeiture for this district, my charge is to transport these items confiscated from the enemies of America to a military storehouse for safekeeping...<eos> - They are perfectly safe here.<eos> - ...whereupon the seized items are to be sold at public auction within 10 days.<eos> Whereupon the proceeds go to you.
Just residence.<eos> Anna.<eos> I mean a problem for me.<eos> When you say it would be better for all, I can't help but think that you're referring to the magistrate.<eos> For you, leaving Whitehall could not be seen as anything else than a very dark day for the man who now sits before you.<eos> A year ago, I would not have been able to say these things without tripping over my tongue,<eos> but I'm not the same man as I was.<eos> I've been changed by this place, by what I've seen... what I have survived.<eos> And by the people I've met.<eos> My dear Anna, ever since I've had the opportunity of knowing you, I've been in love with you.
Go there.<eos> General Arnold!<eos> Check the inventory against the manifest.<eos> What is this?<eos> A warrant signed by Congress.<eos> I want it all marked.<eos> Signed by you.<eos> This is a bloody writ of assistance.<eos> - Do you serve Great Britain now?<eos> - Do you? For amongst the many charges lain against you, most disturbing is the use of military wagons to offload the Charming Nancy, a known smuggling vessel.
- What charges, man?<eos> - Six in total.<eos> And they have been sent to Congress and to General Washington.<eos> Charges of corruption, of impropriety, and perhaps worse.<eos> Since those charges are lies, I will assume that you have no evidence to back up this slander that I will see you charged with.<eos> What is that?<eos> An anonymous letter sent by a concerned Patriot led us to your nest of schemes and bad business.<eos> Anonymous?<eos> I will fight these charges to the bitter end. - All done, sir.<eos> - I will see you there.
I heard about Corporal Eastin.<eos> I don't know how he's done it with his Rangers deployed, but Simcoe has somehow managed to strike a double blow against me.<eos> I suppose it is the perfect alibi.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Not only has he killed another one of my men, but now he has apparently poisoned Major André's trust with me.<eos> His letter from New York indicates that he is not interested in hearing what intelligence Abraham has gathered about the Sons of Liberty.<eos> Perhaps it's for the best that you don't send Abraham to New York anymore.<eos> What are you talking about? I'm...<eos> I'm talking about my son.<eos> I've come here after much deliberation to inform you that he is a criminal,
We shouldn't be on foot!<eos> Were you in the military, law enforcement?<eos> - No.<eos> - Right.<eos> Still, I don't think this is a good idea.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Those people were coming after you.<eos> And if they find you, they're gonna torture you, and then they're gonna kill you.<eos> You want to stay alive?<eos> Then today I don't work for you.
When I get back, I'll teach you how to be field medic.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's blood, not guts.<eos> But you just said yourself that we don't know what's out there.<eos> I've got to call in the cavalry.<eos> Okay, there's a pay phone three blocks, four blocks east of here.<eos> - Here. - You... you can't just leave me.<eos> You want to go home?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> We should probably wait in my office in case somebody comes looking for you.
Must have made your father happy... your marrying into the military.<eos> You should ask my Navy captain father how he felt about me marrying an enlisted Army grunt.<eos> Where does your family live now?<eos> New Orleans...<eos> If it's still around.<eos> I honestly have no idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how did you get involved in all this?<eos> I mean, putting aside the conspiracy theories that this was planned for decades and our government was somehow complicit...<eos> Somebody must have approached you, right?

Because I keep my promises.<eos> If you are lying about this...<eos> Are they bringing him back?<eos> I know you don't understand or necessarily care about inter-colony politics, but it's very complicated.<eos> There's a ton of red tape and bureaucracy.<eos> All right, look...<eos> I don't have the power to navigate this on my own.<eos> - Of course you don't.<eos> - But I'm working on it.<eos> Understand that I am really exposing myself here for you guys.
All right, okay, that's probably impossible, but I really want to help you get him back.<eos> I just need to make it out of this little predicament if I'm going to keep that ball rolling.<eos> In the bathroom.<eos> I'm sorry, Officer.<eos> We've had some attempts on our liquor supply.<eos> I'm just being careful.<eos> Ma'am, if you have any safety issues, you need to report them to Homeland Security immediately.<eos> We'll handle them.<eos> Of course.<eos> What can I do for you?
There was no one there.<eos> - That's our guy?<eos> - Well, it's his face.<eos> Dwight Ford.<eos> He enlisted with Homeland Security nine months ago, right after they started taking applications.<eos> Meaning he's been on the inside collecting intel.<eos> What are you doing to find him?<eos> Well, it would help if we could use the Rolodex.<eos> We need a password.<eos> I'll have to make some calls, but I can probably get you authorized.
So, we have a military-trained ex-mercenary sociopath leading the Resistance.<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - That's lovely.<eos> The drones zapped my Congressman, but they left this guy behind.<eos> Tell me you can find him.<eos> He ended up here for a reason.<eos> There must be some local connection.<eos> I'm gonna find it, and then I'm gonna find him.<eos> Krista, bring me the thing.<eos> - This is for you.
But when I'm ready.<eos> On my terms.<eos> Look at him, Katie.<eos> He's growing up alone.<eos> Please don't touch the art.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Charlotte wants you to manage the correspondence today.<eos> What?<eos> You put me back on envelope duty?<eos> Brett will set you up.
Was that funny to you?<eos> Maik?<eos> It's your mother.<eos> Did you think about that?<eos> Your mother.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> I get that my mother is my mother.<eos> Your story was the most sickening, unsavory, and shameless I've encountered in 30 years of teaching.<eos> You should rip these pages out.<eos> I don't mean literally, I mean think about what you've done.
And Natalie,<eos> Laura, Corinna, and Sarah with the big tits.<eos> Not to mention Tatjana.<eos> And Mia.<eos> And sweet-ass Jennifer from class 8a.<eos> And her cousin.<eos> And Melanie.<eos> Melanie...<eos> Are you gay, actually?<eos> - Are you nuts?
Andrej Tschichatschow, "Tschick," fled and is therefore guilty.<eos> Stealing the car was his idea.<eos> He was also at the wheel when the accident occurred.<eos> My client went along because he was afraid of Andrej.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Maik, sit down.<eos> We both decided to drive off with the Lada.<eos> And I was driving on the autobahn.<eos> Stop this crap!<eos> Order, Herr Klingenberg, I'll ask if I want to hear from you.
I'm gonna make them answer.<eos> I promise.<eos> Okay, we can't run out of whiskey at an Irish wake.<eos> It's, like, the one rule, okay?<eos> Whiskey is important.<eos> Whiskey's important.<eos> I'm certain Camille would have appreciated all of this.<eos> I hope so.<eos> How is he?<eos> Excuse me, don't I know you?
Oh, shit! No!<eos> Don't shoot her!<eos> Go!<eos> I know this is sudden, but we must move quickly.<eos> This might be our best opportunity ever.<eos> Ephraim, you're just in time.<eos> Come.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I'm here to help.<eos> We don't need you, Doc. Enough!
Hey.<eos> What in the hell was that?<eos> They needed to know.<eos> You don't think that should have been a discussion?<eos> There's nothing to discuss.<eos> There shouldn't be any secrets in our house.<eos> Helena.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Hello, Alan.<eos> Always good to see you, of course.
They needed to know.<eos> You don't think that should have been a discussion?<eos> There's nothing to discuss.<eos> There shouldn't be any secrets in our house.<eos> Helena.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Hello, Alan.<eos> Always good to see you, of course.<eos> Our meetings are just usually more... scheduled.<eos> Well, I wanted to let you know that the Chief Minister of the Pacific Coast is coming to our Colony for the anniversary of the Arrival.
More like a performance review.<eos> Great.<eos> I welcome that.<eos> I think things are going very well here as of late.<eos> We're meeting all of our worker quotas.<eos> Since the Geronimo trial, we've had no significant insurrection.<eos> Except, of course, for your abduction attempt.<eos> A complete outlier which has been fully handled by my counter-insurgency team.<eos> I'm not the one you need to convince.<eos> Of course. I just want you to know that I stand behind my work.
Well, I don't think that order comes from fear.<eos> It comes from providing people with a decent quality of life.<eos> I admire the impulse, but remember what George Orwell said.<eos> What was that?<eos> "If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face... forever."<eos> Precisely my point.<eos> This situation is bad enough.<eos> We don't need to make it worse.<eos> All right, Alan.<eos> Look, I just came by to give you a heads-up.
- Don't want to waste your time.<eos> I sure as hell wouldn't worry about that.<eos> Thank you for traveling with the Transitional Authority's Red Line from Westwood to Larchmont in 15 minutes, all day, every day.<eos> How's the gardening?<eos> Well, that's our business, isn't it?<eos> Planting seeds, watering them, hoping they'll grow into something useful.<eos> That how you know my wife?<eos> I run her cell.<eos> You don't seem surprised.<eos> Broussard work for you?
I run her cell.<eos> You don't seem surprised.<eos> Broussard work for you?<eos> I know he's the guy you want, and I'm prepared to give him up.<eos> I've decided to make a deal, and you're gonna negotiate on my behalf.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because you're invested.<eos> If you succeed, I'll disappear, and your wife's secret will disappear with me.<eos> If you fail, her name will be the first thing I spill under interrogation.<eos> People died for you, and you're just gonna sell 'em out?
Here's my number.<eos> Call me when you're ready to deal.<eos> Next stop, Hauser.<eos> Is it really safe to meet here?<eos> There's a church around the corner.<eos> We're not meeting in a church.<eos> This is really conspicuous.<eos> All right.<eos> Walk with me.<eos> What can I do for you?
I did some research, and there's all kinds of specialized equipment at USC and up on Mount Wilson, and maybe the RAPs didn't bother to destroy that stuff since it's outside the Zone.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> Because we're locked in here.<eos> What if we aren't?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Waiting to make sure he isn't being set up.<eos> How do we know we're not being set up?<eos> We don't, but you wanted to meet him.<eos> So, you're the guy, huh?<eos> What do I call you?
This way.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> I hope you brought me a Transit Pass.<eos> Snyder cancelled the deal.<eos> Can you disappear in this bloc?<eos> I could hide in your house for six months.<eos> You'd never even know I was there.<eos> But here's the play-- you claim that these idiots didn't search me in the right way.<eos> You walked in here, I got the jump on you, and you had to help me out the back door.<eos> And I never see you again.
Oh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you need us to call anyone?<eos> About what?<eos> Any relatives... someone to come pick you up.<eos> You've lost your mother.<eos> You understand this, right?<eos> Carbon monoxide poisoning can affect memory.<eos> I'm so sorry, Norman. I...<eos> I know this must be very hard for you.
- What was that all about?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Mother?<eos> I'll be patient, Mother.<eos> Sheriff?<eos> I-I need to see Norma Bates.<eos> Sheriff, I'm... I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - What drawer did you put her in?<eos> I don't think it's a good idea for you to be in here.
I think that he had always had a thing for my mother, and he married her so she would lock me up in Pineview, and he would have her all to himself.<eos> And then when I was released, he still tried to turn her against me, saying that I was unstable, and... he just wanted me out of the way, but thankfully, she knew it, and that is why she left him.<eos> Look, I, uh... I need to pick out something for her to wear.<eos> I never imagined that I would be standing here doing this.<eos> Do you think this is good?<eos> Well, I know... I know you don't know her, but she's got the most beautiful blue eyes.<eos> They just pop.<eos> I think it's lovely.<eos> Okay, Norman, thank you for talking with me.<eos> My dad is ready to see you, Norman.
What the hell is this?<eos> You got nothing on me.<eos> You're being charged with perjury.<eos> Per... what perjury?<eos> Lying to a federal agent.<eos> - I didn't lie to anybody. - That's bullshit.<eos> You told federal agent Howard Collins that you had no personal relationship with Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> We have evidence to the contrary.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> We'll take you any way we can get you.
You've heard that's the case?<eos> Does it have anything to do with the scouts you sent out after Valentine?<eos> Is there another reason you can think of?<eos> Butterflies can mean only one thing...<eos> Fair Folk are in mourning.<eos> How do you know our customs?<eos> Apparently, I'm not the only Shadowhunter who enjoys the company of a Fair Folk.<eos> Maybe if more Shadowhunters exhibited such good taste things would be different today.<eos> [Jace] The scouts are dead.<eos> That's who you're mourning.
One moment, please.<eos> - Please.<eos> Father Lucas!<eos> Father Lucas?<eos> Look, here are the boys I told you about.<eos> I'm sorry, I was kind of distracted, miles away.<eos> - How are you? - Are you alright?<eos> Excuse me, please.<eos> Thank you so much for seeing us, Father.<eos> How may I address you?
Yes, Paulinha, I'll take you.<eos> Let's do this, kid, before we leave,<eos> - let's check the tire of your bike, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Mother, put some for me. - Just a little?<eos> It's warm.<eos> Is this enough?<eos> Lucas!<eos> Son!<eos> Sorry, he did not see you.
Wait a second!<eos> I...<eos> I always dreamed of meeting the Biaggios and now I'm going to be his student, his apprentice, my God in heaven!<eos> - So, Lucas.<eos> - Wow!<eos> Father José, did he make an appointment?<eos> Is this meeting already scheduled?<eos> - Because I need to prepare myself.<eos> - Calm down, calm down!<eos> He said that as soon as everything is ready, that is, at the right time, he will call you himself.
He said that as soon as everything is ready, that is, at the right time, he will call you himself.<eos> Look...<eos> I don't even know how to thank you.<eos> - No, no!<eos> - I don't know, really.<eos> You don't need to thank me, not me.<eos> Thank God, Lucas.<eos> Always with wise words, my friend, always.<eos> Well, I'll be going.<eos> I think I'm going to let you go, because I'm tired.
- No, no!<eos> - I don't know, really.<eos> You don't need to thank me, not me.<eos> Thank God, Lucas.<eos> Always with wise words, my friend, always.<eos> Well, I'll be going.<eos> I think I'm going to let you go, because I'm tired.<eos> - Good rest.<eos> - Give me a hug.<eos> It was a great pleasure to see you again.
I am Father Lucas, of the parish...<eos> You are that child... who bumped into me that day and that were with that man.<eos> Yes, that man was my father.<eos> - Are you still looking for answers?<eos> - Yes I am, of course!<eos> And if you can help me find them, I'll be eternally grateful.<eos> I'm glad you became a priest, clung to God, because, in the end, he is the only salvation.<eos> As for your father, I cannot say the same.<eos> But that's just it, my father.<eos> After the day I bumped into you in the square, my father came home...
Good, excuse me now.<eos> Mrs. Lúcia, do you live near here?<eos> I live on the other side of the street with my son, Alberto.<eos> - He's the one who takes care of me.<eos> - Not long ago, right?<eos> Yes, yes, recently.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I make a point of accompanying you.<eos> So let's go.<eos> May God be with you!
Bitch.<eos> - Are you crazy? Calm down.<eos> - You're useless!<eos> Lucas, your soul will be mine.<eos> The bastard got me.<eos> He got me.<eos> The bastard got me.<eos> Sir...<eos> The bastard got me, Lucas.<eos> Who got you, Sir?
Sir...<eos> The bastard got me, Lucas.<eos> Who got you, Sir?<eos> If you stay, I can help you...<eos> Father!<eos> Ready?<eos> Father Lucas?<eos> This is father Pedro Biaggio.<eos> - Oh, father Pedro!<eos> - Am I disturbing you?
Father!<eos> Ready?<eos> Father Lucas?<eos> This is father Pedro Biaggio.<eos> - Oh, father Pedro!<eos> - Am I disturbing you?<eos> Not at all, not at all...<eos> You're not bothering.<eos> And by the way, I don't know how to tell you this, but it seems that it was transmission of thought, because I just had a nightmare with you.<eos> I would like to make an invitation to you, for an exorcism session today.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you too, Father Lucas.<eos> Come with me, please!<eos> Father Pedro?<eos> My pleasure, Father Lucas.<eos> Sorry for the delay, you know how this city is...<eos> Sit down.<eos> Okay.<eos> First of all, Father Pedro, I wanted to thank you...<eos> Lucas, I've separated this for you.
Okay.<eos> First of all, Father Pedro, I wanted to thank you...<eos> Lucas, I've separated this for you.<eos> - Thank you, Father Pedro, I...<eos> - Open it!<eos> It was blessed by our Holy Pope.<eos> I think it will be very useful.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lucas, I'm going to give you absolution.<eos> I absolve you, in the name of Jesus Christ, of all the sins you have committed in the past.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Lucas...<eos> What you're going to see inside there... it will change your life forever.<eos> Do you want to continue?<eos> Just one more thing...<eos> Don't speak directly to him.<eos> It is the devil, it's deceptive and will try to confuse you.
I cast you out!<eos> Oh, my God of Heaven, father Pedro!<eos> Father Pedro!<eos> Father Pedro!<eos> Father Pedro.<eos> Don't do this to me, Father Pedro!<eos> Father Pedro! Father Pedro.<eos> Father Pedro! Father Pedro.<eos> Don't do this to me.<eos> In the name of Jesus Christ, I absolve you of all your sins that you have committed in the past.
I think he made a bad choice.<eos> I didn't feel prepared... I think...<eos> So I must conclude, that in this moment of terror you have taken my brother's place and without practice, exorcised the girl.<eos> Yes, that was it, in the midst of all confusion<eos> I don't even know how it happened, I don't even know...<eos> Father Lucas, my son...<eos> You ask me why my brother chose you, because he, as I, have seen in you, exceptional qualities to replace him.<eos> I still keep thinking that...<eos> Rest assured, I will continue the work of my brother,<eos> I will teach you the practice of exorcism.
Father Thomas!<eos> Father Thomas!<eos> Father Thomas!<eos> Father Thomas!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I am fine!<eos> Go after him.<eos> I cannot do it without you. I cannot do it without you!
I cannot do it without you. I cannot do it without you!<eos> Yes, you can!<eos> I don't have the strength anymore.<eos> Go!<eos> It can be very dangerous.<eos> - Careful, my brother! Watch out!<eos> - Go on, quickly!<eos> Quickly.<eos> Watch out!<eos> Let me release you.
- My name is Erick.<eos> - This is Father Lucas.<eos> - Hi, Father Lucas.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - It's my pleasure.<eos> We can take a picture, then...<eos> Would be great!<eos> Even because I want to take a picture of you to the Vatican.<eos> I want to introduce you there.
- You're right.<eos> Do you know Father José from Nossa Senhora do Ó?<eos> Yes, I've known for a long time.<eos> When you meet him, say that you met with Father Lucas Vidal.<eos> You can let me give you the message, yes. Don't worry!<eos> Look here, Father Thomas Biaggio, my address and phone number if you need anything...<eos> Great!<eos> - It was a tremendous pleasure.<eos> - My pleasure!<eos> - May god be with you.

Your cross is your light.<eos> Try to resist, Father Lucas.<eos> Father Lucas is no longer here!<eos> So resist, Father Lucas.<eos> Did not I say I was coming back, priest?<eos> Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.<eos> Thy kingdom come, Your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.<eos> Give us this day our daily bread.<eos> You surrendered the soul of your own friend.<eos> You're going to die with your guilt.
So?<eos> Let's continue?<eos> So, priest, we don't want to disturb you anymore, do we?<eos> We have to leave, it's late.<eos> So let's set it aside for another day.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> I'll see the best day and I'll call you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Go on, man!<eos> Come through here, I'll open the gate for you.
I'll see the best day and I'll call you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Go on, man!<eos> Come through here, I'll open the gate for you.<eos> Okay, alright.<eos> - Nice!<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Let's go?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I'll accompany you to there!
And now look at the date and count for nine months.<eos> (Dianne) This must be him.<eos> It would fit exactly.<eos> America.<eos> Somehow, this word always exerted a calming attraction on me.<eos> As if the empty place inmegotcolor.<eos> (Cat) You're back and don't get in contact with me?<eos> You Lulu!<eos> Lulu has just returned from vacation.<eos> But I can't wait to see you again too, Madame.
But back then she still had hope.<eos> Oh... Hey!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey you two, I'm Kyle.<eos> Are you going to stay with us forever?<eos> (Cat) Excusez-moi.<eos> Parfait? - Bien sûr, Madame.<eos> (Phil) Lemons or strawberries?<eos> - Love fruit.<eos> Madame, I like you.
I've spent lifetimes training by them, being reborn.<eos> Don't kill him.<eos> The Time Masters took one of our own and turned him against us.<eos> I say we undo their handiwork.<eos> I trust that you're comfortable, Mr. Rory.<eos> Or do you answer to Chronos these days?<eos> I don't take orders from you.<eos> I can't believe I ever did.<eos> Well, that's debatable.<eos> I'm calling on you for two reasons.
I can't believe I ever did.<eos> Well, that's debatable.<eos> I'm calling on you for two reasons.<eos> First, we could use your help.<eos> What's the second reason?<eos> We're headed to 2147 to engage Savage.<eos> Is that the second reason or the first?<eos> Ah, forget it.<eos> I owe you an apology, Mr. Rory.<eos> I failed you.

Doesn't look like progress to me.<eos> Speaking of progress, we need to get a better lay of the land.<eos> And I need to get a better look at how they made my suit autonomous.<eos> Well, why don't you take Martin and Jax with you?<eos> Ms. Lance, Mr. Snart, and I will work on locating Savage.<eos> Tor Degaton holds daily meetings with his board of directors.<eos> And it's open to the public?<eos> 'Course not.<eos> Just Kasnia's shareholders.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but we're not shareholders.
The food riots, climate change.<eos> I am well aware that the world outside our walls is descending into chaos, but causing chaos cannot be a proper response<eos> It is not chaos.<eos> It is logic.<eos> The world's population is unsustainable at current levels.<eos> The herd must be thinned.<eos> So you've argued, Mr. Savage, but no matter how many times you choose to press your point, my decision shall stand.<eos> Vandal.<eos> Oh, my boy.<eos> My father would have you killed for calling me that.
her life in exchange for his.<eos> Your son will be returned to you as soon as you guarantee our safe passage.<eos> Don't do it, Father.<eos> If you let them go now, they will only come back for us in the future.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Your son is right.<eos> We should kill them all.<eos> Put down your weapons!<eos> - No, Father.<eos> - Let my son go, and I will let you leave in peace.
Willie, you know you can't play that torture trumpet to kids.<eos> I'll just use it to vape, then.<eos> Class, I would like you to meet your new teacher, retired Air Force Sergeant Ms. Berrera.<eos> Ay, caramba!<eos> Air Force?<eos> Sergeant?<eos> A woman?<eos> Good morning, crew.<eos> I am proud to be here educating my country.<eos> For you, teacher.
♪ So drunk I'll eat gas station sushi. ♪<eos> Homer, don't forget to pick up milk.<eos> Oh. And not just any milk-- healthy milk, without any hormones.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> Aw, they sell ads in thought bubbles now?<eos> I'm running a basic errand.<eos> Homer Simpson buying a healthy product?<eos> Now I have seen all of the things that there are to see.<eos> That will be $16.<eos> And can I interest you in any, uh, milk insurance?

Oh, Evergreen Terrace.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Our system's a little slow.<eos> Aw!<eos> Ew!<eos> I mean, cool!<eos> I just turned a big corner, Bart.<eos> Oh, Simpson,<eos> I called you here to gloat.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know about you and Berrera.
From the airport.<eos> And I wasn't even going anywhere.<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah.<eos> Your candy's filled with chupacabras.<eos> We've been pranked or possibly punked.<eos> I know who your prankster is.<eos> The Simpson lad.<eos> Were you watching us make out?<eos> I was watching you try.
Hmm, three bucks.<eos> When you asked me to go skating, I really thought you knew how.<eos> Uh, I thought I could learn by watching YouTubes this morning.<eos> All right, Simpson, I'm here.<eos> Do what you do best-- your worst.<eos> Look, Seymour, I'm not gonna do a thing.<eos> Carol, he's all yours.<eos> Wow.<eos> The first war I've won.<eos> Uh, Carol, all that's left is for you to meet my mother, and, uh, up she skates now.
- Too bad.<eos> You used our client for bait!<eos> That's a pretty big allegation...<eos> Allegation?<eos> Look around! This was a shit show!<eos> He could have died.<eos> Let's be real honest here.<eos> No bullshit.<eos> Your firm is small-time. Your 15 minutes were up after Union Allied.<eos> Right now, you are way out of your league.
Robin Wexler, the hottest girl at Higbee High School.<eos> But yeah, she wound up marrying Steve Nunan, captain of the soccer team, for which I was the mascot.<eos> And now she is divorced, and her grown son has moved out of the house, and she's living in Orange County, California.<eos> So... spoiler alert, we really hit it off on Facebook Messenger.<eos> And I have volunteered to perform at a charity event that she's organizing for a group of disadvantaged children.<eos> So, I'm excited to get down there.<eos> -Hello, there.<eos> -Oh, hello. Welcome, sir.<eos> Blumquist, AJ. They should have the John Wayne suite ready.<eos> Okay, we actually have you for the Slim Pickens suite.
And we finally narrowed it down to 20 finalists.<eos> That's you people.<eos> Give yourselves a round of applause.<eos> I can see some of you out there sizing up the competition, looking at 'em and thinking, "That's my arch enemy."<eos> Well, not tonight.<eos> Tonight, we are all friends.<eos> In fact, could you all just take a moment and say hello and meet-and-greet somebody maybe you've never met before?<eos> It's what we always do at church.<eos> Isn't that fun?<eos> Great. God bless each and every one of you.
-I think it's this.<eos> -It could be. - Hi. What's your name?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Tommy. -Tommy, this has been a delight.<eos> -Oh, well, thank you so much.<eos> -You bet, darling.<eos> -Take care. God bless, sweetheart.<eos> AJ.<eos> You know, I could nudge some of my people towards you.<eos> They might enjoy meeting you... even if they don't know who you are.
-Thank you. -I'm sorry for my...<eos> I don't know what I...<eos> -That's all right.<eos> -We're just rehearsing.<eos> -That's all right.<eos> -You look... Hello!<eos> -Look at you. -Hi, how are you?<eos> How are you?<eos> -Hello. Look at you. You look like a sunrise.<eos> - It's great to see you.
Oh, no way. That is gonna be good.<eos> This is Cindi.<eos> -That's only $11 to go out on a boat.<eos> -Oh, two for one. -Uh-huh.<eos> Two of us can go for the same price as one ticket.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> I don't know!<eos> What'd I do?<eos> Miss Babineaux, a formal complaint has been lodged against you.
-It doesn't matter.<eos> -But you've been doing it your whole life.<eos> I can't go up there and do something you've been doing your whole life.<eos> Alvin is Alvin.<eos> You'll put on the mask, and you'll be great.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.<eos> Welcome to the 8th World Mascot Association Championships.<eos> Please welcome our celebrity judges.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Hi! Good to see you all.
-I'll tell you what,<eos> I was a better Sid than my dad ever was, but... you, you're a better Sid than I could have ever been.<eos> -Oh, shut up, Dad.<eos> -No. No, I mean it.<eos> - Record that.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> -That's family progress, eh? -Wow. -That was progress.<eos> Fist! Fist! Fist!<eos> Great.<eos> So, I hate to put you on the spot, but which mascot was your favorite?
Never get used to it.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Let's do this.<eos> We're risking everything, aren't we?<eos> Going against the Clave, against the other Shadowhunters...<eos> Valentine's trying to destroy the world, Clary.<eos> We're trying to protect it.<eos> Before I forget...<eos> These belong to you.<eos> Did Alec give you these?
Hey, look at it this way.<eos> Would you rather be scrubbing toilets?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Better than sittin' with our thumbs up our butt.<eos> Look, there's a lot of ways to stay busy in prison, okay?<eos> You can read a book, you can watch educational television.<eos> You have to learn how to help yourselves in here.<eos> Bad guy with the crazy hair...<eos> You know, there's... There's nothing forbidden for you.

Well, I hope this doesn't sound impolite, but I'd like to decline your considerate offer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> No, I mean, by all means, put me to work.<eos> I would love to learn a new trade, maybe plumbing or... or electricals.<eos> Mmm, well, electrical is, uh... poorly managed.<eos> Well, you choose.<eos> You're the expert.<eos> You know, I've chosen.<eos> You know, these girls, a lot of them, come from poor, disadvantaged communities... and this class could make a big difference for them.<eos> But I guess you don't care about that, huh?
You know, these girls, a lot of them, come from poor, disadvantaged communities... and this class could make a big difference for them.<eos> But I guess you don't care about that, huh?<eos> Helping others?<eos> Oh, I do. I do.<eos> That's why I set up a scholarship fund for young chefs in rural Tennessee.<eos> It's why I do everything I can to diversify all my kitchens.<eos> I sit on numerous boards, volunteer, do PBS.<eos> So, forgive me if I want a respite.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is what MCC has decided is best for you.
How did you not know your date was coming up?<eos> It's early.<eos> I guess I was good or some shit. I don't know.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> -Well, hey, congratulations.<eos> -Yeah, no, not congratulations.<eos> More like con-fuck-ulations... or whatever the opposite of congratulations is.<eos> Why?<eos> You get to go find your kids.<eos> You get to fuck 'em up yourself instead of having someone do it for you.
Assange... if I could still find his e-mail.<eos> All right, you guys keep talkin', and I'm gonna go out to the garden and check on that drone.<eos> Frieda's right.<eos> We have to kill her.<eos> Group therapy is starting in five minutes.<eos> Missed quite a show.<eos> -Good.<eos> -Big success.<eos> Good.<eos> Listen, uh, Ms. King has asked me to remove you as her counselor.
Well, that's not gonna happen again, because it is my job to prepare each of us to recognize the dark forces, and that means more butts in these pews... because the battle is comin'!<eos> Andunlesswe 'reprepared, thatdarknesswillspewforth withthereekofa sewer... drowning us in its corruption.<eos> We will choke on it, gag on it, andthentheblackpit ofhellwillawaitusall.<eos> I appreciate your comin' today.<eos> I could've done without some of that saucy language. Puttin' people's backsides in seats.<eos> Maybe it's a minor blessin' there weren't more people here to hear me workin' "blue."<eos> Well, I like when you put a little pepper on your pitches, Reverend.<eos> Why, Mildred, you make me blush.<eos> Enjoy the rest of your Sunday, ladies. Bye-bye now.<eos> May God bless you and keep you.
And you, ladies, are my recruiters!<eos> My righteous army.<eos> Well, s-- sign me up.<eos> And, uh, Kyle Barnes, is he a member of your army, Reverend?<eos> Is he the one who put those bruises on Joshua?<eos> There was one enemy in the room that day.<eos> Only one.<eos> And the blood of every Christian soul, Kyle Barnes included, was spilled in defeating it.<eos> Thank you all for comin'.<eos> Bless you all.
Thanks, Melvin.<eos> You too.<eos> Oh, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Gotta stay strong for Betsy.<eos> You wanna take a look?<eos> I mean, it's pretty wicked.<eos> I'm gonna take your word for it.<eos> Uh, George Buck?<eos> Hi, the hospital told me I might find you here.
I mean, it's pretty wicked.<eos> I'm gonna take your word for it.<eos> Uh, George Buck?<eos> Hi, the hospital told me I might find you here.<eos> Hi, uh... are you one of them?<eos> Sorry, one of who?<eos> Please, just leave me alone.<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to you.<eos> If anything, I'd like to help you get your job back.<eos> Look, I need to understand why you were fired from Metro-General in the first place.

The place where her face used to be.<eos> I think I'm done... Red.<eos> I think I'm done.<eos> Police.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Hands where I can see 'em.<eos> Shots fired.<eos> Bodies, mayhem and shit.<eos> How come I just knew it had to be you?<eos> I have something for you, Sergeant.
So it was Lucius, then.<eos> Ted Pryce confirmed.<eos> That he killed Simon?<eos> He didn't.<eos> But he did kill Alistair.<eos> What's your take on Jeffrey Stewart?<eos> That he might be an even bigger sociopath than you?<eos> Dominique Stewart. She was your father's true love.<eos> She died.<eos> - You killed her, didn't you?
So we must be missing something.<eos> I know I told you to be great for Lenny. This is it.<eos> She hasn't... mentioned anything about the birthday party, has she?<eos> If you're asking if she's still with Mandy, the answer is no.<eos> Might be hope for you yet. Yeah.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'll let you know if I find anything.<eos> 'And then we're not.<eos> The thing we never talk about...' - Your Majesty? - '..<eos> Too many good people have been lost for us not to make things right - for them and for you.'

Whatever it is you're doing, it stops now.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Accessing the surveillance database.<eos> I was gonna come to you, sir, when I had something, eventually.<eos> - Regarding what?<eos> - The King's murderer. The King's murderer is in prison.<eos> But it wasn't Lucius, sir.<eos> He was in the palace. Mr. Frost, there are experts who are paid to make this their work.<eos> Your work, however, is to keep the Prince safe.<eos> What you're doing is not only distracting, it's dangerous.

And a first.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I'm sure you're wondering why I've asked you here.
I have some things to say to you and I thought it best I say them directly and in person.<eos> Alistair Lacey is alive.<eos> So, while your intentions were shameful... ..it seems you're no murderer.<eos> And if shameless intentions mattered around here, we'd all be in prison.<eos> You're going to be removed from incarceration and absolved of any charges.<eos> And my position?<eos> My work? I can't forgive you for betraying me, Lucius.<eos> I can't and I won't.<eos> Then, with all due respect, Your Majesty... ..I killed the King of England. And I will remain in prison till my dying day.<eos> We're going to absolve you of all charges.
I didn't know who else to call.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> First child?<eos> Children change everything.<eos> Yes.<eos> King Simon said that very thing. You were close to Simon.<eos> Until you had me dismissed.<eos> Yes. I believe your beloved fiance had something to do with that, as well.<eos> Whatever you've come here to say...<eos> I'm sorry. I promise... I'm here out of concern for you and your son.
She seems determined to marry Cyrus.<eos> So maybe it's a sign.<eos> Have Alistair's blood tested.<eos> Be with your true love.<eos> Find... life outside of these walls.<eos> I was listening to Liam's speech, watching him these last few days.<eos> He's so clearly Simon's son.<eos> - But you don't know that.<eos> I know it in my heart.<eos> Let's say you're right. That doesn't mean you can't have love and life outside of these gates.
Unfortunately, I am.<eos> Someone once told me... ..that the first steps are always the most difficult.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You took those first steps.<eos> You got out.<eos> I haven't been able to do it.<eos> I've been too afraid.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna do it on my own.<eos> You just will.<eos> - You killed her, didn't you?
You're standing on my ceiling.<eos> If you right yourself, I promise to come down.<eos> I thought we had an understanding, Foxy. About my lifestyle.<eos> It's all still here.<eos> Cocaine, marijuana, MDMA and assorted hallucinogens... here.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> - Well done, you.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a gift. From Mr. Frost.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
Let me know when you want to confront our murderous mother, won't you?<eos> It just keeps getting worse, doesn't it?<eos> Pretty flowers.<eos> Like the ones on my grave thanks to you getting me killed.<eos> But then, people kill people all the time around here.<eos> Don't they, baby?<eos> It's open.<eos> Ted, I didn't know you cared.<eos> I found these outside your door, Your Highness.<eos> I think the staff didn't want to disturb you.
As a matter of fact, they had something of a rivalry, she and your mum.<eos> What does that have to do with my pendant?<eos> Look, Liam, I have to walk a fine line here between personal and professional but, in confidence,<eos> I think you need to ask your mother that question.<eos> Your father was a man who believed in the truth.<eos> He'd want you to know the truth.<eos> I think he admired you most when you insisted on it.<eos> What is the truth? Talk to your mother.<eos> Be resilient.<eos> And, son... ..I'll always be there for you.
Don't.<eos> It was driving me crazy like that.<eos> As you wish.<eos> I just wanted to check on you.<eos> - I'll leave you to it. - James? Come in.<eos> You are who you say you are, yes?<eos> As much as I can be, Your Highness.<eos> You're not here to rob me or dominate me or have sex with my mother?<eos> It wasn't initially why I took the job, no, but, of course, I understand if the requirements of the position change from time to time...<eos> My father would have liked you, Mr. Hill.

- Don't move.<eos> - Liam, whatever you think you know... - I saw you!<eos> Have you asked yourself what happens after this, after you pull that trigger?<eos> My family's avenged.<eos> What about you?<eos> I consider this justified.<eos> If I don't answer it, they'll go after Ophelia.<eos> There's a protocol.<eos> One moment.<eos> It's for you.
You're a brave man to take over during such difficult times.<eos> I just want to make sure we find a manageable resolution to this oil...<eos> I've read some of your books, Mr. President.<eos> I just finished Learning to Learn.<eos> It was good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There was a chapter on visualization that really interested me.<eos> Yes, it's a... a tool for students.<eos> It helps them...<eos> I would like you to visualize something.
When he recovers, perhaps he and I can speak.<eos> So, are we finished?<eos> The president's in very bad shape. Sir...<eos> How serious is it?<eos> He needs a liver transplant.<eos> I wasn't aware that...<eos> You better get used to negotiating with me.<eos> If the president dies, it's you and I... or nothing at all.<eos> My apologies, Mr. President.<eos> I didn't intend to insult you.
We need to get out ahead of it and control the story.<eos> All right.<eos> Get me a copy and report on the investigation so far.<eos> I wanna see him.<eos> The president.<eos> The Secret Service still won't let me.<eos> I'd like Mr. Stamper to have access to my husband, please.<eos> We have strict orders, ma'am. Only you and...<eos> Would you like me to call the vice president myself?<eos> Douglas, this young man will escort you to his room.
We needed a head to roll.<eos> First hers... then yours.<eos> You'll resign tomorrow.<eos> Doug, I know you're under a lot of pressure, but...<eos> You sent the photo of the rebel soldier.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Personal phone, off the premises.<eos> You know, maybe somebody hacked my account or something...<eos> Are you really gonna keep lying to me?<eos> I could have you arrested. But I'd rather you go quietly.
I could have you arrested. But I'd rather you go quietly.<eos> I know things, Doug.<eos> Nothing you can prove.<eos> Now, threaten me again.<eos> There's no proposal without China's involvement.<eos> Now, Cathy's tried, but she doesn't have the best relationship with them.<eos> Maybe she needs some help.<eos> Help?<eos> How?<eos> - Do you mind if I smoke?
Russia, gas prices...<eos> Attack a president who's fighting for his life?<eos> I didn't call this meeting to debate.<eos> I want those states back.<eos> So let's start organizing events and media hits.<eos> Prelim budgets and schedules, by tomorrow morning.<eos> There has been much speculation as to Goodwin's motivations. Cynthia.<eos> - Where are we on Goodwin?<eos> - The security guy's taken care of.<eos> He never saw the two of you together.
If I deliver, will you keep me on?<eos> You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> Thank you, Doug.<eos> Did Heather Dunbar inform you of a meeting between herself and Lucas Goodwin?<eos> You're having me interrogated by my own subordinates?<eos> They only work for you if you keep your job.

Failing to have informed us constitutes withholding of evidence.

Failing to have informed us constitutes withholding of evidence.<eos> Heather is a friend.<eos> It's very simple, Martha.<eos> You work with us, you stay on as AG.<eos> You don't, we prosecute.
Off the record.<eos> - If it were anyone but you...<eos> - Well, luckily, it isn't.<eos> Let me get Fausto.<eos> It's time for his walk.<eos> I'm in the nuclear game, not fossil fuels.<eos> No one has the relationships you do in China.<eos> Chinese disowned me.<eos> They'll come around.<eos> Who put you up to this?
- I thought you were out?<eos> I was fooling myself.<eos> So, president gets shot, and you just can't help taking advantage of the chaos.<eos> What you call chaos, I call opportunity.<eos> And you're my first client.<eos> I wish you the best.<eos> But I'm not your first client.<eos> I don't wanna have anything to do with the White House.<eos> You lost a lot of money during the Walker scandal.<eos> I did, indeed, which is why I'm turning you down.
I had to blink my eyes if I wanted to respond.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> If I can't get your loyalty, I will have your obedience.<eos> Blink.<eos> - Blink!<eos> Here.<eos> You're fucked up, man.<eos> - Quit it.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Hammerschmidt.<eos> How can I help you?
If Donald wants my counsel, that is his prerogative.<eos> You are deliberately deceiving me.<eos> - Going behind my...<eos> - You have forgotten your place, Douglas.<eos> My place?<eos> What about your place?<eos> You leave him when he needs you most, you threaten him, and now that he's in here, you undermine him.<eos> - You're supposed to be...<eos> - Stop.<eos> That is enough. I will fill you in on everything, but not here.
At the White House.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - His heart.<eos> - Doctor?<eos> - He's had some sporadic arrhythmia.<eos> - Will you give us the room for a moment?<eos> - Of course.<eos> We can't keep battling each other, not with him like this.<eos> We need a new path forward, and I would like your help with that.<eos> I promise I won't keep you in the dark.
We need a new path forward, and I would like your help with that.<eos> I promise I won't keep you in the dark.<eos> I'll meet you at the White House whenever you're ready.<eos> I'm staying here.<eos> I think this is more important.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal about how to deal with Russia.<eos> I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.<eos> I am a bit surprised, yes, to see both of you.

President Blythe just wanted me to stress how important it is that the Democrats stick together right now with Francis being--<eos> There's no need.<eos> I just called the Speaker to schedule an emergency vote.<eos> I'm sure the president will be pleased.<eos> - How... How's Frank?<eos> - He's hanging in there.<eos> I'm sure you wanna get back to the hospital. But thank you for making the personal visit.<eos> - Thoughts and prayers, Claire.<eos> - Thank you, Bob.<eos> I'll walk you out.
Mr. President, I wouldn't get your hopes up.<eos> The members of the G7 are already ruffled because Russia was invited, and Petrov may be using this opportunity to embarrass us in front of the international community.<eos> Yes?<eos> - The First Lady is here, sir.<eos> - Send her in.<eos> Sir, I would like to finish our briefing--<eos> I'm not gonna keep the First Lady waiting if she wants to see me.<eos> - I'm sure you've heard.<eos> - Yes, Birch called a few minutes ago.<eos> I'd like to join you in Brandenburg, Cathy.
Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Mrs. Underwood?<eos> Dr. Saxon is on the line.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Good evening, or good morning.<eos> President Underwood is currently being prepped for surgery to receive a liver transplant.<eos> Barring any complications, the surgery is expected to take 12 to 13 hours.<eos> Uh, we'll update you about the progress if need be, but probably nothing more until the operation's completed.
"It was a difficult decision for me not to return..."<eos> But I know my husband.<eos> If he were conscious...<eos> "...he'd tell me to press on..."<eos> ...that the best way to be at his side is to serve my country.<eos> "And I can serve it better in Germany than in a waiting room.<eos> If there's an emergency, I'll return immediately..."<eos> ...but I have the utmost faith...<eos> "...in the medical team at Jefferson Memorial."<eos> I'm praying for a successful procedure, and I ask all of you to join me in praying for my husband, your president.

I'm getting a lot of questions about the First Lady's involvement.<eos> We stick to our message that she was just there to assist.<eos> Secretary Durant led the effort.<eos> There's multiple reports that she and Petrov had a long meeting.<eos> They greeted each other.<eos> That's it.<eos> So we deny?<eos> The president hasn't approved the plan yet.<eos> We wanna focus on his recovery, not the--<eos> - Yes? - Secretary of Health for you, sir.
My boy is going to die.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> He has the consumption, they say.<eos> Tuberculosis.<eos> He's been like this on and off for about a year now.<eos> He always wanted to see the American West.<eos> Our doctor thought a constitutional might do him some good.<eos> It hasn't, clearly.<eos> You know, there are medicines that... The doctor here says he has a day... maybe two, if he's lucky.<eos> Does he look lucky to you, Mister...
This is about a boy in town who's dying of an easily curable disease.<eos> Just as you couldn't turn your back on Jeb Stillwater and his gang, I can't turn mine on this boy and his mother.<eos> Except Dr. Palmer is using 19th-century technology to deal with Stillwater, whereas you...<eos> Just spare me the lecture, Captain Hunter.<eos> You, of all people...<eos> This isn't about the mission, Martin!<eos> Do you not recall happened when Dr. Palmer left a bit of his suit back in 1975 and nearly destroyed Central City?<eos> That was an accident.<eos> I'm not talking about our mission or Dr. Palmer's technological gaffe.<eos> Calvert... that town clearly holds some emotional resonance for you, judging from the looks you've been exchanging with Mr. Hex.
I was still a young woman when Savage left me a widow.<eos> Instead of waiting for him to find me and kill me so that I could love my Hannibal in the next life, I tried to find love in this one.<eos> Talk about a curse.<eos> What happened?<eos> He was a good man, but he wasn't a soul mate.<eos> It was like fate was trying to break us apart.<eos> Eventually, fate broke both our hearts.<eos> So I made a promise to myself that I wasn't gonna do that to a person again.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> No, I'm who's sorry... to have to be the one to let you know that you're never going to be able to love anyone else, ever.
So, thanks for your help.<eos> It's hard to find reliable security these days.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> What?<eos> Wingtips.<eos> Good call.<eos> Shine them yourself?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> You're not exactly a tough read.<eos> I... could surprise you.
Uh, I wish you'd called.<eos> I'd have set something up.<eos> - Are they in?<eos> - Uh, just the Nelson half.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> In private.<eos> You know, it's really not a good idea to piss her off.<eos> So, what can I do for the Assistant District Attorney?<eos> It's more what I can do for you, Mr. Nelson.
Trust me, there's nothing I'd rather do more than cooperate with your office. But a legal firm sharing privileged communications with a client, I mean, even a deceased one, without a court order?<eos> I've seen lawyers get disbarred for less.<eos> And I don't know about you, but I worked really hard for my law degree.<eos> Nights and everything.<eos> Reyes... she staked all her political chips on the conviction of this Punisher freak.<eos> Now, if things'll go her way, there'll be an opening in the District Attorney's office in the not-so-distant future.<eos> And DA Tower has a nice ring to it.<eos> Now, I'd start considering the benefits that could accrue if your firm were more... cooperative.<eos> Like I said... show me a subpoena, and I'll cooperate like a son of a bitch.<eos> Reyes is gonna roll over you like a tank.
My name is Karen Page.<eos> - I was a friend of...<eos> - Ben.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> Look, I think that I owe you an apology.<eos> - At the funeral, I thought that you...<eos> Look, Ben...<eos> Ben was a real pain in my ass.<eos> So it follows that his friends would be, too.<eos> What can I do for you?
Excuse me.<eos> There's an issue with our server.<eos> Someone has hacked into the server.<eos> Possibly internal, we don't know yet, security is looking into it.<eos> If it's an external threat, I'm sure they can trace the IP address and deal with the "problem" face-to-face.<eos> But I'm more concerned about what information they can pull from Roxxon's system when it is offline.<eos> I'm terribly sorry, something has come up.<eos> Could we reconvene at another time?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'll have someone escort you downstairs.
That's fine.<eos> Well, that covers work.<eos> Uh, well, it's a start.<eos> - Um, I'll be back in just a minute, um...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Order something fantastic.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Look. If I had to seem like I knew everything there is to know about wines in the next 60 seconds, what would I... what would I order?<eos> You have a call.
Today, of all days...<eos> I mean, he said he'd be late, but this is ridiculous.<eos> Foggy, what is going on with him?<eos> All rise.<eos> Court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Cynthia Batzer presiding.<eos> Indictment number 1986-4447, The People v. Frank Castle.<eos> Be seated.<eos> Looks like you're a man down.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defendant has been indicted for several serious crimes.<eos> But I'm instructing you, as a point of law...
Frank Castle returned from the hell of war wanting nothing more than to pick up his life.<eos> But his wife... young son and daughter were brutally murdered by criminals, and no one, not the police and... certainly not the District Attorney stepped up to make it right.<eos> See, Frank Castle never came home.<eos> He just traded in one war zone for another.<eos> This trial isn't about vigilantes.<eos> It's about the failure of the justice system.<eos> And how one man, Frank Castle, is being used as a pawn to cover up that system's mistakes.<eos> The prosecution wants blood.<eos> But as the judge just said... to get it, they have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> So all I'm asking of you today... keep an open mind.
If my office finds out that your firm had anything to do with this...<eos> Our firm?<eos> For all we know, it was you who sent those goons.<eos> I've heard enough.<eos> It's clear to me that whatever Dr. Tepper may know about these autopsy reports has been tainted by threats made by person or persons unknown.<eos> Then the defense asks for a mistrial.<eos> Not on your life, Mr. Nelson.<eos> I'm still not convinced these documents, whatever they may be, are even relevant to this trial.<eos> I'm striking the doctor's entire testimony and instructing the jurors to disregard anything they may have heard.<eos> - Your Honor, I strongly urge you to...
- Open the door!<eos> Open...<eos> - You go in my house...<eos> Someone is lying about what happened to your family, Mr. Castle.<eos> You three, out!<eos> Now!<eos> We're on shaky ground.<eos> - You need to be really careful.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - How can we help you, Ms. Reyes?
Uh, we have a little bit of business here left.<eos> Frank Castle already has counsel.<eos> So, unless you've asked the public defender for permission to speak to his client, you are in violation of New York legal ethics.<eos> We spoke to the PD this morning.<eos> To be honest, he doesn't seem all that prepared to tackle this case.<eos> Although, he did mention the conversation that you had with him yesterday.<eos> Matt Murdock, is it?<eos> - Yeah, pleasure to meet you. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You have a reputation of being a smart man, Mr. Murdock.<eos> And since your colleagues seem unable to grasp the hornets' nest they keep kicking, let me direct this at you.
Uh, 98 lesser...<eos> I mean, felony assault, burglary... criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment... Any number of criminal mischief charges.<eos> We're so screwed.<eos> You ready to go in?<eos> But considering the arraignment's in a couple hours, we don't have much of a choice.<eos> Time to play twenty questions with a killer.<eos> I've reviewed the charges you're facing.<eos> It's my understanding that... you wish to plead guilty to all of them?<eos> I'm gonna need a... verbal confirmation if we're gonna continue.<eos> Look, you asked us to represent you.
And chances are, they've got eyes everywhere else, too.<eos> Well, this is going to be more fun than I thought.<eos> We have to get him alone somehow.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> You just hang tight.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - Oh, my God, I am so sorry. - Ugh!<eos> Shit.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Did I get any on you?
A lot of plastic dinosaurs.<eos> Yeah, those were my little girl's. Those were Lisa's.<eos> When she was little, she used to make these little noises when she played with them.<eos> What about the little... the little car?<eos> Like a remote-controlled Jeep.<eos> Yeah, yeah, that, uh... That was Frank Junior's.<eos> I got that for him for his seventh birthday.<eos> He used to...<eos> Yeah, he drove me crazy with that thing.<eos> Look, Frank, it's... It's really not for me to say... but they clearly loved you.
We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and decades of planning on this operation.<eos> And now... our most valuable secrets have been stolen.<eos> I'd be very disappointed to learn you aided this theft in any way, Gibson-san.<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> We entrusted you with access.<eos> Even employed security to protect you and ensure the sanctity of our operation.<eos> I was in the bathroom.<eos> We were attacked.<eos> Listen!<eos> Listen, I would never betray you!
All right, watch your head.<eos> Inmate 5-5-4-6-7. Fisk, Wilson.<eos> Everything off.<eos> Clothing and personal items in the bin.<eos> Newbies wear white.<eos> That's yours.<eos> I deeply regret that it's come to this, Mr. Fisk.<eos> I assure you my firm did everything we could... but the case against you was, quite simply, bulletproof.

- She wants to come see you.<eos> - She can't.<eos> She must stay where she's safe for the time being.<eos> Of course.<eos> She'll have everything she needs.<eos> But with that said, you need to understand that a good number of your assets were seized by the government, Mr. Fisk.<eos> Your remaining capital is... limited.<eos> - How long will she be safe for?<eos> - Long enough.<eos> Mr. Fisk, I'm doing everything I can to get you out, but we're talking about a process that could take months, maybe years.
- Valdez brothers.<eos> - They your friends?<eos> Slim pickings in here, but, yeah.<eos> Yeah, they don't talk much.<eos> Let's just say what they did to get in here was ghastly.<eos> Do they have family?<eos> A mother.<eos> She'll be alone for a while.<eos> I wish I had better news, Mr. Fisk, but the appeal...<eos> - I didn't ask you here for that.
- You heard what I said.<eos> I'm simply proposing an arrangement.<eos> I don't do arrangements.<eos> You should rethink that... considering the amount of enemies you have in here.<eos> I'm not gonna be your goddamn trigger man.<eos> - I'm offering you the opportunity to confront the man implicated in the deaths of your family.<eos> Yes, I benefit from your actions.<eos> But the tide raises all ships, Mr. Castle.<eos> If, for some reason, my involvement diminishes your passion for answers... for revenge... well, that's your choice.<eos> But the war you waged on New York City... it got you nowhere.
If, for some reason, my involvement diminishes your passion for answers... for revenge... well, that's your choice.<eos> But the war you waged on New York City... it got you nowhere.<eos> I'm offering you something... no one else could.<eos> If you don't want my help, fine.<eos> By all means... enjoy prison.<eos> How would it work?<eos> My resources here are limited, but I can assure you safe passage to cell block A... which is run by Dutton and his men.<eos> Guards have a shift change at 1500 hours.<eos> Dutton's men will be in their cells.<eos> We can get you to him.
Case is closed.<eos> Castle tanked his own case.<eos> He got put away.<eos> I just think you should carry the torch on this. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so... I just wanna rewind this informal meeting<eos> - we're having by about 30 seconds.<eos> - What?<eos> You come to me with a lead, with a really good lead, right?<eos> And now you just wanna take off?
- I'm coming with you.<eos> He's my son.<eos> You wanna be alive to see him?<eos> Stay here.<eos> Doctor?<eos> Doctor, my name's Karen Page, I...<eos> Sir, I know your testimony in the case against Frank Castle hurt your career.<eos> I think I can help you.<eos> But I also think there are other people involved who could really use your help.<eos> I remember you.
You know, this crusade of yours... it's never gonna end, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah... yeah, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Open the goddamn door.<eos> Mr. Castle... thank you.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you.
But then I saw it... with my own two eyes.<eos> And when one comes across someone with such talent... with such a gift... well... you don't let that go to waste.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> How's that?<eos> Release him.<eos> - Mr. Fisk, I...<eos> - Do it now!<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I'm in control now.<eos> - And I've set you free.
I want this out across all five boroughs.<eos> And get some additional units to the courthouse and City Hall.<eos> - Do it.<eos> Move!<eos> - Son of a bitch. What is it?<eos> The Punisher.<eos> He just escaped.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Agent Gallagher.<eos> Follow me. I'll get you through security as quickly as possible.
- No, not Frank.<eos> Wilson Fisk.<eos> Frank blows his trial, and ends up on Fisk's cell block?<eos> And a day later, he's on the street.<eos> Uh, those are two very separate dots.<eos> - You can't just connect them.<eos> - Oh, come on, Foggy.<eos> I'm right.<eos> Fisk made this happen.<eos> She'll see you now.
I know you're regaining power in here.<eos> Yes, ask my lawyer. He'll deny it.<eos> Ask the guards!<eos> They'll deny it.<eos> Ask the inmates here.<eos> They'll cut their tongues out before they talk.<eos> But I have something to say to you.<eos> When I finally get out of this cage... I will dismantle the lives of the two amateurs that put me in here!<eos> You, Mr. Murdock, and Franklin Percy Nelson.<eos> No, I... I put you here, not Nelson.
Where are you headed?<eos> Far away.<eos> New York is over.<eos> Winter jacket. Gorsuch.<eos> Ski trip...<eos> Courchevel?<eos> Far too early for Courchevel, and anyway I prefer St. Moritz.<eos> Shopping and slopes.<eos> For a start, both my feet hurt after a while. I'll need a bath.<eos> I can draw one for you.
Can you feel this?<eos> Good.<eos> Daniel.<eos> Your father's here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's weak, and he'll need another transfusion, but he's coherent.<eos> Hopefully the others will respond the same way.<eos> I don't know how to repay you.<eos> Trust me, billing will find you.
I'm going to kill him.<eos> And if you get in my way, Matthew... I'm gonna kill you, too.<eos> Ready?<eos> Also, uh, let's...<eos> I know that the fingerprints were probably burned...<eos> But let's get some prints taken anyways.<eos> You know you can go home now, right?<eos> You don't need anything else?<eos> I have your statement.<eos> If I have any more questions, I can track you down.
I'll get out of your hair.<eos> I think I have everything that I need.<eos> Once he got out, he tracked me down.<eos> Asked me how he could serve me again.<eos> That boy was the definition of "loyal."<eos> Or was. Before Frank Castle murdered him.<eos> Colonel, please.<eos> I just...<eos> I just think I should go.<eos> I'll walk you out.
Just get in the car.<eos> Start the car.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Start the goddamn car.<eos> Keep your hands on the wheel. Don't make any...<eos> Start driving.<eos> Drive!<eos> Turn that shit off.<eos> Could've been smart. Could've let the story go down with that boat.<eos> "The real Castle." Like you cared about him.
Have there been any developments?<eos> Besides making sure Castle's face is plastered across every TV channel and newspaper?<eos> The DA and the medical examiner are dead, the same asshole takes a shot at you, and so far nobody in this entire city's seen a damn thing.<eos> I'm...<eos> Like you said, it's been a long night.<eos> We'll nail him.<eos> Until then, I'm just glad you agreed to accept police protection.<eos> I appreciate the offer.<eos> All right, the car's outside.<eos> Powell and Reed will escort you to a safe location.
Oh, yeah, slavery.<eos> That's the reason you come to me?<eos> It's not enough?<eos> I suppose after all this time, I expected more from you.<eos> Like what?<eos> An understanding of the real threat facing this city.<eos> Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm looking at one.<eos> However, tonight I'm only after information.<eos> Perhaps you should ask your police.<eos> I don't want you.
- Yeah.<eos> And I say we head straight into the lion's den.<eos> The last thing they're expecting is that we hit back at them now.<eos> You would risk everything for me?<eos> So how do we do this?<eos> Not alone.<eos> We do it together.<eos> Our firm represents Hell's Kitchen's top clients.<eos> Of course, by accepting our offer you'll get a personal assistant, a corner office, and the opportunity to branch out and build your own client base.<eos> Your former associate, Ms. Marci Stahl, recommends you very highly.
A place where cowards don't last long.<eos> So... you must be a hero.<eos> We all are.<eos> Some more than others, but none of us alone.<eos> Some bloody their fists trying to keep the Kitchen safe.<eos> Others bloody the streets in the hope they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty... the disregard for human life all around them.<eos> But this is Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here.<eos> You didn't choose this town.<eos> It chose you.
Frank Castle's been through hell.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You killed my dad!<eos> I don't give a shit what you've been through!<eos> - Order!<eos> Order in the court! - You killed him!<eos> - I saw him in his coffin...<eos> - Please remove that young man now.<eos> He was my dad, and now he's gone!<eos> I'm now instructing each and every one of you to disregard that outburst and to not let it influence your opinions on this case.
- I saw him in his coffin...<eos> - Please remove that young man now.<eos> He was my dad, and now he's gone!<eos> I'm now instructing each and every one of you to disregard that outburst and to not let it influence your opinions on this case.<eos> I did that.<eos> Right?<eos> That kid, I took his father from him.<eos> I did that.<eos> - Yeah, you did. - Uh-huh.<eos> Look, Frank, I can't judge you.

It was...
Order.<eos> Think about what you want, Frank.<eos> - Something's not right.<eos> - No turning back now.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> Please state your name for the record.<eos> Mr. Castle, you've been charged with multiple capital crimes.<eos> Been called a killer incapable of empathy or remorse.<eos> So I hear.<eos> May I call you Frank?
It works with my outfit.<eos> What now, Mr. Snart?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> There I was, thinking we could go a whole week without kidnapping anyone.<eos> I think you'll find it would have been better to simply kill me.<eos> I agree.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that.<eos> She knew who I was.<eos> I know who all of you are.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you, Gareeb.
Ugh! Fire!<eos> Now!<eos> Hold on to something!<eos> Fire, Gideon!<eos> Fire everything!<eos> Now might be a good time to start praying.<eos> - Gideon, what's our status?<eos> - I'm gonna go with "lousy."<eos> Shut down all essential systems so Savage's robot...<eos> Too late, Captain; apparently, it has determined you are still alive, because it is closing in on our location.
Are you sure you want me to?<eos> Of course I'm sure.<eos> Because the moment I release him, you will lose her forever.<eos> You don't know Kendra.<eos> I know Chay-Ara.<eos> And I know the man who stands between you and your love has stood between me and mine for millennia.<eos> We're actually quite alike, you and I.<eos> We're nothing alike.<eos> You're insane.<eos> But yet Chay-Ara once loved me as she professes to love you.
I made them ready to accept my punishment.<eos> I won't leave you in here.<eos> If you love me, you will.<eos> If you love me, you will leave this place far behind, and live a life unburdened by your past.<eos> It's easier said than done.<eos> Anything worth doing always is.<eos> Well, finally an intellect approximate to my own.<eos> My imprisonment was starting to get dreary, Professor.<eos> I'm not here to play mind games with you.<eos> I'm here to ask you if you remember a night in October, 1975, a place called the Greyhill Building.
The Jumpship.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Well, it's really more a question of when.<eos> But, oh, yes.<eos> You both wanted to return to 2016.<eos> Got it in one.<eos> I did what I had to do to save Jefferson's life.<eos> Now we must do whatever's necessary to repair the Waverider and deliver Savage to the Vanishing Point.<eos> Oh, back so soon with the stench of defeat written all over you.<eos> Can't say I didn't warn you.
I wouldn't expect a psychopath like you to understand.<eos> Kendra is free to do what she wants.<eos> You know what I see when I look at you?<eos> I see weakness masquerading as goodness.<eos> I'm not the one trapped in a cage.<eos> Well, if it weren't for this cage, you wouldn't have that arrogant look on your face.<eos> You think I'm afraid of you? No.<eos> I know you are.<eos> At least Carter had the courage to face me like a man.<eos> No wonder she didn't choose you.
How did you manage to escape my prison all those years ago?<eos> There were no signs of damage, no clues to your tricks.<eos> It left me puzzled for centuries.<eos> The best magic tricks have the simplest solutions.<eos> I bribed your guard with a novelty pen.<eos> Had a picture of a woman on it.<eos> Turn it upside down, her top comes off.<eos> I won it from a drunk GI in a Philippines bar in 1944.<eos> It's a tacky souvenir, but in this case, a lifesaver.<eos> Now, unfortunate for you, the guards at the Vanishing Point won't be quite so easily swayed.
Rip Hunter, on behalf of the Time Council, you are hereby ordered...<eos> Yeah, before you do that, there's someone<eos> I'd like you to meet.<eos> You remember Mr. Savage?<eos> Of course.<eos> And we remember how you pled for us to remove him from the timeline once before.<eos> Well, as the first Time Master was so fond of saying, that was then, this is now.<eos> Incontrovertible proof that Vandal Savage has been engaged in the manipulation of time!<eos> Including a confession.<eos> When I saw you again in 1975, I realized that time travel was the only explanation.
And we remember how you pled for us to remove him from the timeline once before.<eos> Well, as the first Time Master was so fond of saying, that was then, this is now.<eos> Incontrovertible proof that Vandal Savage has been engaged in the manipulation of time!<eos> Including a confession.<eos> When I saw you again in 1975, I realized that time travel was the only explanation.<eos> You showed a caveman fire, and I had almost 200 years to figure out how to strike the flame.<eos> Impressive, Captain Hunter.<eos> You and your team have accomplished what none of us here in the Time Council believed you would.<eos> If the prisoner would step forward...<eos> Vandal Savage, by the power of this chamber, it is my duty to return you to Earth immediately.
What's happening to him?<eos> He is suffering from severe internal injuries.<eos> Who's doing this?<eos> A deep scan of Mr. Palmer's timeline reveals a temporal anomaly on December 19, 2014, in the vicinity of Palmer Technologies.<eos> The Pilgrim.<eos> Gideon, get us to that location now!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm no one.<eos> We have that in common.<eos> We need to get you to cover.
What do you think of Jeremy as a name?<eos> Oh, I think he looks more like a Martin.<eos> You guys asked for a doctor, right?<eos> Yeah, how would we?<eos> He means that we were on our way to the hospital and we saw your automobile.<eos> Yeah, and this little munchkin needs a checkup.<eos> Prenatal care, it's very important.<eos> He means post-natal.<eos> We'll take him straight to the hospital.<eos> We'll meet you there.
I work for them.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> My true loyalty is to my children.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Time Masters fill their ranks with children, orphans pulled from throughout the course of history.<eos> When Michael arrived at the Refuge, he had nothing but the clothes on his back.<eos> There's a reason it's called the Refuge, and a reason that it exists in a secret location in history.<eos> The Time Masters will never think to look for you here.<eos> Thank you for your assistance.<eos> Look, I know I make a gorgeous baby, but I should warn you.
She's a tough kid.<eos> How's your dad?<eos> Sleeping off that amnesia pill from Rip.<eos> Hey.<eos> I might have just stopped my dad from getting killed in Mogadishu.<eos> I just thought I should tell you in case there's a time paradox or whatever.<eos> Well, as I've been saying, Mr. Jackson, time wants to happen.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But I had to try.<eos> And perhaps what time wants is to see you and your father back together.
- Take him away.<eos> - What?<eos> Search their ship for the others.<eos> - You're under arrest. - Mick, what's going on?<eos> We need to find somewhere to hide.<eos> I need to be getting back to 2166.<eos> I've been waiting to meet your family.<eos> And because if you don't follow me, this is what is in store for your world 150 years from now.<eos> I could have chosen any time and any place.<eos> Of all the people who ever lived, I chose you eight.
Ah, gentlemen, I missed you.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Ah, that's it. Oh, yeah, break my arm.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Why are you taking her?<eos> Hey!<eos> Kendra!<eos> Leave us.<eos> I have a query.<eos> Why haven't we killed you yet?
- Our Holy of Holies.<eos> The Oculus viewing chamber, our most powerful window into past, present, and future.<eos> The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.<eos> The Oculus' existence is known only to the High Council, including its greatest secret:<eos> the Oculus not only gives us a window into time, but the ability to shape it as we see fit.<eos> We've been helping Vandal Savage consolidate his power by giving him access to time travel.<eos> But you've been helping him too.<eos> From the moment we realized only Savage could save the world, we've been using the Oculus to manipulate you.
We've been helping Vandal Savage consolidate his power by giving him access to time travel.<eos> But you've been helping him too.<eos> From the moment we realized only Savage could save the world, we've been using the Oculus to manipulate you.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> - Think about it.<eos> Thanks to your efforts, Vandal Savage was not in prison for the sale of a nuclear weapon in 1975.<eos> You prevented the Soviet Union from winning the Cold War in 1986.<eos> Carter Hall's death provided Savage's closest lieutenants preternaturally long lives.<eos> You and your team have been moving through the course of time.<eos> We've merely redirected it, and you, to the outcomes history requires.
The only place in the universe free will exists is here at the Vanishing Point.<eos> No!<eos> No matter what you do, it will happen.<eos> And there is nothing you can do to stop it.<eos> No, I acted without your consent.<eos> In... in defiance of your orders.<eos> Everything I've done has been to save my family.<eos> No one controls me!<eos> We counted on that, your anger, on you going rogue.<eos> We needed something to spur you on, to give you purpose.
Past or future?<eos> The present.<eos> Somebody order up a rescue?<eos> Mr. Snart, your timing is impeccable.<eos> Or not.<eos> Put the gun down, Mick.<eos> Chronos, fire.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> If I recall, I made you a certain promise.<eos> No, I beg of you.
I'm not doing this 'cause I like you.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> All right.<eos> Almost done.<eos> There seems to be a failsafe to prevent tampering, which probably includes trying to blow this thing up.<eos> English, haircut.<eos> I have to maintain contact with the failsafe it order to destroy the Oculus.<eos> Not that much English.<eos> Get back to the ship.<eos> We are not leaving without you.
It's a work thing.<eos> - Oh. - And are you gonna help me or not?<eos> All right.<eos> But only 'cause it coincides perfectly with my own plan.<eos> And what plan is that?<eos> Well, to have sex with you, of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, you and I... well, there is no you and I.<eos> There's a professional situation,<eos> - and I just need you...
All right.<eos> But only 'cause it coincides perfectly with my own plan.<eos> And what plan is that?<eos> Well, to have sex with you, of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, you and I... well, there is no you and I.<eos> There's a professional situation,<eos> - and I just need you...<eos> - See, you need me.<eos> The department needs you, because you're the one...
You're welcome.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> Don't worry, Detective.<eos> I'm more of a leg man myself.<eos> Soon as you say the word, you'll have your turn.<eos> Wow, you've never been rejected by a woman, have you?<eos> No.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> I want to talk to Carver Cruz!<eos> I need you to leave right now, sir.
Go forth and conquer.<eos> I know you want to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Off you pop.<eos> You're Lindsay's brother.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> Because she's a cop.<eos> Great. Say that louder.<eos> I don't think everyone heard you.
Seriously.<eos> What is that?<eos> Don't, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I should get dressed. Otherwise, we'll miss the party.<eos> So you did make the call?<eos> Yes, yes, yes, yes.<eos> Party's at Lux.<eos> Turns out, the words "open bar" are indeed effective.<eos> So good on you.
Turns out, the words "open bar" are indeed effective.<eos> So good on you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can't go wearing that scruffy little getup.<eos> You'll stick out like a sore cop.<eos> Where did you get this dress anyhow?<eos> Oh, it was left behind by one of my overnight guests.<eos> What was she wearing when she left?<eos> - A smile.<eos> - Mm. If I get an STD from this thing, I'm gonna kill you.
A deal's a deal, especially one with the Devil.<eos> Besides, I'm the only one not risking his life on this.<eos> Immortal, remember?<eos> Carver,<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I'm a...<eos> I don't know where I am.<eos> Please come get me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I'm all right.<eos> I'm a...<eos> I don't know where I am.<eos> Please come get me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, I can't let you do that.<eos> I'm not gonna call this in, but you have to stay here.<eos> No discussion.<eos> I'm coming with you.
No.<eos> Is that Carver?<eos> How did he get here?<eos> Oh, he must have followed us.<eos> - Well done, Detective.<eos> - No, he didn't follow us.<eos> He must have gotten the address somehow.<eos> Or someone told him.<eos> Either way, he's gonna get someone killed, probably himself.<eos> This love thing makes you all quite stupid, doesn't it?
What are you?<eos> Did you do this?<eos> I've been trying to tell you, I'm the Devil.<eos> That's... that's not possible.<eos> I assure you, Detective, it is.<eos> I mean, you've said yourself, there are things you can't explain.<eos> You need more proof? You've got the gun.<eos> Come on, shoot me.<eos> No.<eos> I can't shoot you.
- You're bleeding.<eos> - I'm bleeding.<eos> Oh, crap, of course you're bleeding.<eos> God, what have I done?<eos> I don't... I don't bleed.<eos> It's...<eos> Lucifer, I'm so sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Well, it means I shot you.
Lucifer.<eos> Thank you again for all of your help.<eos> You are so welcome.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> I thought you didn't lie.<eos> I don't.<eos> But I don't always tell the whole truth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Come on, I'll drive you home.
Did you make one of them your pet?<eos> I figured out the husband, then it was the job, now it's the children.<eos> This is supposed to be a time out to teach you a lesson!<eos> I don't think that's how time outs work.<eos> Mommy, I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe you're not so bad after all. We need to talk.<eos> What?<eos> Detective Decker.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you two the same thing.
- Courtesy of the owner.<eos> This is from Lucifer?<eos> He asked me to make you something you'd like.<eos> Did I get it wrong?<eos> You and Lucifer seem really close.<eos> I followed him through the gates of Hell.<eos> I'll take that as a "yes."<eos> Hello, Detective.<eos> How has your undercover surveillance of my activities gone so far?<eos> I've looked into you.
People don't appear out of thin air.<eos> Who were you?<eos> How did you survive getting shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?<eos> Is that your normal reaction to someone saving your life? - Investigating them?<eos> - When I see something I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.<eos> Well, I've given you the answer, Detective. It's not my fault you won't accept it.<eos> Do you know what I think?<eos> I stopped trying to guess.<eos> I think you like me.<eos> What part of the look on my face gives you that impression?
- That's more like it.<eos> Detective, I never knew you cared.<eos> No bulletproof vest.<eos> What?<eos> I just couldn't imagine how you'd get it under that suit, but I had to check. What is it?<eos> What is it? What is it?<eos> I'm gonna figure out your secret, Lucifer.<eos> Not a secret if I'm telling you the answer!<eos> It's...<eos> Why don't I affect you, Detective? What makes you different?
It's...<eos> Why don't I affect you, Detective? What makes you different?<eos> I guess we both have our mysteries.<eos> Well, I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Oh, God, not that again.<eos> Decker.<eos> Are you sure? Yes.<eos> Yes, please send me the address.<eos> I owe you one.<eos> Oh, finally.<eos> Now that affected you. What was it?
You get a statement from Nick?<eos> You can't be involved in an active case until you're off medical leave.<eos> Listen, I get why you wanted to be here, I do.<eos> But you have to bring him?<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> What are you doing here? Oh!<eos> How's your ex?<eos> He's not the reason you rushed over here, is he? Answer the question.<eos> I'm trying to solve my mystery, Detective.<eos> If I don't affect you, I'm curious as to what does.
And what are you doing here?<eos> Lucifer!<eos> Ah, hello again, small human.<eos> This-this is yours, yes?<eos> Yeah, that's Molly McDowell.<eos> She's a ballerina by day, but a ninja chemist by night. When a simple yes would've sufficed.<eos> Right, on you go, then.<eos> Go on, fetch away. Well, go on, then.<eos> Is this too advanced for her?<eos> You're funny.
Did a little more digging.<eos> Guy's name is Josh Bryant.<eos> He freelances for Nick.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I think you're onto something.<eos> So go figure it out while I buy you some time.<eos> And... be careful.<eos> Oh, sorry. Did I ruin your creepy little moment?<eos> I am so happy to see you.
So go figure it out while I buy you some time.<eos> And... be careful.<eos> Oh, sorry. Did I ruin your creepy little moment?<eos> I am so happy to see you.<eos> I felt so bad about what happened.<eos> I'm a huge fan.<eos> Hot Tub High School was my favorite growing up.<eos> Yes, we're really not interested in your formative spank bank years, all right?<eos> I'm so sorry about what happened. I would've done something, but I'm not good with violence.<eos> Well, lucky for us, we found you anyhow.
So I took him under my wing. He was a natural.<eos> Taught him about all the lines a pap can't cross.<eos> You know, 'cause I just... I just wanted him to stop making the same mistakes I did.<eos> And then, two days ago, he calls me up, says he's been in a really bad accident, and said that he totally understood everything I was saying now.<eos> But it was too late. You know, someone was dead.<eos> So you took the fall, hoping that Josh would get a chance at a new life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You must really be enjoying this. I'm really not.<eos> Believe it or not, I forgive you.<eos> This isn't about you, this isn't about me. This is about Robbie Russell.
Just a second. Hey, Dan, this better be important.<eos> I think Nick's about to talk.<eos> No, I'm not following Josh. Why?<eos> What do you mean he's missing?<eos> - Yes, Detective? - Where did Nick Hofmeister go?<eos> - Did somebody get him?<eos> It was that tall, handsome British fella.<eos> I did it, too, didn't I?<eos> Oh, I respect what you do, dung beetle.<eos> Much as celebrities hate you, you know, they need you, keep you in the limelight.
What is this?<eos> Right, well, both of you have committed terrible acts worthy of punishment.<eos> However, you will not receive said punishment when you die.<eos> It's my fault, really.<eos> Sorry. So I'm here to fix that.<eos> Amateurs.<eos> All right, very well, in terms you'll understand.<eos> You both get a gun.<eos> Let's see who shoots who first.<eos> What's to stop us from shooting you?

My wings... where are they?<eos> What wings?<eos> I don't even know what you're talking about!<eos> Why do they always insist on being so difficult?<eos> All right.<eos> As you can see,<eos> I'm not playing, so let's try again, shall we?<eos> My wings, please.<eos> Look, man, why would I take your wings?<eos> I don't even know who you are!
If there's an open investigation calling for his dismissal, it can cost them his benefits, his pension, all of it.<eos> So, what, you want me to just drop it?<eos> Just turn my back on everything I stand for?<eos> No.<eos> I'm saying if you want to do something about it, then do it now.<eos> You have 24 hours.<eos> Or let it go and let his family move on.<eos> Is this really what you do in your spare time?<eos> How fascinatingly morose.<eos> Do you ever think of taking up knitting?
Hold on.<eos> Now, I'm not one to get into the feels, usually, but... you seem genuinely distressed.<eos> You okay? Do you want to...<eos> I don't know... chat about it or something?<eos> Sex is always on the table.<eos> You never quit, do you? No.<eos> I'm simply offering an ear.<eos> Come on.<eos> Remember the Palmetto case I was telling you about?<eos> The case that's been consuming you, causing people to despise you, call you names... I even quarreled upon occasion because of it?
- Yes, well, it wasn't just nesting dolls that I was looking for.<eos> There was something else, something... personal that was missing when we got there.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Lucifer, what was in there?<eos> My angel wings.<eos> Yeah, go on. Get it all out.<eos> Okay, seriously, what was in there?<eos> Oh, you are serious?<eos> Oh... okay, sorry.<eos> Did someone make them for you?
My angel wings.<eos> Yeah, go on. Get it all out.<eos> Okay, seriously, what was in there?<eos> Oh, you are serious?<eos> Oh... okay, sorry.<eos> Did someone make them for you?<eos> Or are you big into cosplay?<eos> You're enjoying this, aren't you?<eos> Sorry, I'll admit<eos> I don't always get you.
But I don't have to share in their beliefs to profit from them.<eos> So I take it you're not a believer then?<eos> I'm a man that believes in one simple divinity, the almighty dollar.<eos> Humans.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I have to admit, I love being the bearer of bad news.<eos> Oh?<eos> Do tell.<eos> The coin's not for sale.<eos> I simply used it to gain entrée to you.
- Yep. Don't know how it's possible, but on top of everything else, seems I'm dealing with a bit of a mortality sitch.<eos> Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.<eos> What are you grinning about?<eos> I'm just realizing the gravity of what you're saying.<eos> That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?<eos> That even if you don't choose Hell, all I have do is wait for some pitiful thug to end you and right back to Hell you go.<eos> You hadn't put that one together yet, had you, Lucy?<eos> You just made my millennium.<eos> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I'm Carmen Grant and I humbly welcome you to our Evening of Faith.
- I'm still moved by your words.<eos> "I'm a man that believes in one simple divinity,<eos> - the almighty dollar."<eos> - You don't understand... No, I understand.<eos> Perfectly.<eos> A lifelong atheist, you took one peek at the wings and something changed in you.<eos> The great white light was revealed and a believer was born, one who couldn't part with real divinity!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Mounting my wings, like some decorative stag head.<eos> Shame on you.
Come on, have one drink with me.<eos> I can't, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a buzzkill,<eos> I'm just... I'm not in the mood to party, all right?<eos> How can you decline this ravishing siren's invitation to imbibe?<eos> Well, if L.A.'s taught me anything, constant rejections do build character.<eos> Sincerely doubt "constant rejection" is something you ever deal with.<eos> You could learn a thing or two from this guy. Oh.<eos> Witty, charming and wise.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Do I know you?
Sincerely doubt "constant rejection" is something you ever deal with.<eos> You could learn a thing or two from this guy. Oh.<eos> Witty, charming and wise.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Lucifer. Morningstar.<eos> Right, you're the club owner guy who grants people favors.<eos> Yeah, I don't need anything from you.<eos> Oh, I beg to differ, Ty.<eos> I have been looking for you all night.
Well, she wants to be the mother of your children.<eos> Come on, Ty, it's the fourth quarter, but you can still win this game.<eos> I mean, look at her:<eos> death and taxes are less of a sure thing.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> But you desire her.<eos> Why fight it?<eos> Because my mother taught me that...<eos> Oh, no, don't-don't bring her into this; that's disgusting.<eos> Uh... it's about you.
Where are you going?<eos> Detective!<eos> Hey! What's going on?<eos> Detective, you're making a mistake.<eos> Stay out of this, Lucifer.<eos> Cuff him. Wait, what?<eos> Ty Huntley, you're under arrest for the murder of Ali Thornton.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Lucifer, this is all your fault.<eos> I wish I'd never met you.
Cuff him. Wait, what?<eos> Ty Huntley, you're under arrest for the murder of Ali Thornton.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Lucifer, this is all your fault.<eos> I wish I'd never met you.<eos> Trust me, Detective.<eos> I have been doing this a long time.<eos> I know evil.<eos> You've arrested the wrong man.<eos> The person responsible is still out there. How are you so sure?
What's so funny? Well, the fact that you think I'm gonna go.<eos> It's hilarious actually.<eos> Lucifer, I don't need your help.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to solve this for you.<eos> I'm ensuring that the right person is held responsible.<eos> Look, come on, I've been helpful before, haven't I, Detective?<eos> You step out of line one time-- You can give me a right-good spanking, I promise.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Tywouldn'tdo somethinglikethis.<eos> He's such a good kid. I'm actually more curious about you, Mr. Hanson.
What desires drive a man such as yourself?<eos> I want to be the greatest agent of all time.<eos> Really?<eos> And to do that, I need to protect my clients.<eos> Come on.<eos> And, uh...<eos> If you want to protect Ty, tell us what you know.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> I'll tell you everything. You look into something. Here's a deal.<eos> Tell us everything, and I don't cuff you in front of your co-workers and take you in.
Scour the security cameras in the area. Get facial I.D.'s on anyone in a hundred-block radius.<eos> You couldn't live with yourself for committing murder, so you set your car to explode, didn't you? Eh? Wanted to go out in a blaze of glory.<eos> Of course not!<eos> Murder?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, come on...<eos> The bomb was triggered remotely.<eos> Whoever set it off did it before you got to the car.<eos> There's a clear line of sight.<eos> I don't think the plan was to kill you. I think they wanted to scare you.
What happened to the plan?<eos> I made a better one. How?<eos> Just sit tight and we'll all get what we want.<eos> Finally!<eos> The would-be Prince of Darkness.<eos> I'd like to examine the goods first.<eos> Right. Let's see the face of my impostor.<eos> The resemblance is uncanny.<eos> It most certainly is not.<eos> How could anyone think that you were me?
I just wanted to get chicks and-and free drinks.<eos> Um, really.<eos> My name is Justin.<eos> I'm from Sherman Oaks.<eos> Oh, Justin... the things I'm gonna do to you.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I-I'm sorry!<eos> I only came here one time and I just told some girls that I owned the place, and... and that opened some doors for me and so I just started rolling with it.<eos> How dare you abscond my name!<eos> Please, don't hurt me.<eos> Please. I'm not gonna hurt you, Justin, I'm going to destroy you.
She had plane tickets to prove it. What was the surprise?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She just asked me not to tell Dr. Shaw she was in town.<eos> Uh-huh. You can't think she did this?<eos> We're closed.<eos> You must be Maze.<eos> You're just as Lucifer described.<eos> So, you're the doctor.<eos> Oh, call me Linda.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.
What won't?<eos> Sleeping with my boss.<eos> You'll end up like all the others.<eos> Trash left by the side of the road.<eos> Interesting.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I find people who are rude usually feel powerless in their own lives.<eos> Terrified of not being in control.<eos> But that's not you, I'm sure.<eos> I like you.
Yes! That's a great idea.<eos> There's so very much to discuss. So let's start with the most important thing, shall we?<eos> Me.<eos> And once again,<eos> Lucifer disappears.<eos> I think the case may have hit a little too close to home.<eos> Maybe things got a little too boring for Mr. Short Attention Span.<eos> He's grown quite a bit since working with you.<eos> I'm not sure I'm the reason.<eos> I think you've really helped him.
I'm s...<eos> Th-They died? No.<eos> No, they turned on me. Some would argue that's worse.<eos> All right, you need to leave.<eos> No, I'm close to something. I can feel it.<eos> This is not about you!<eos> Gah.<eos> You're right. Yes.<eos> I should use one of you as a case study.<eos> So what... what makes you jealous?
You don't want to miss this one.<eos> You wanted to speak with me?<eos> Lucifer Morningstar.<eos> Father Frank Lawrence.<eos> A priest walks into a bar. I've heard this one before.<eos> Never seen it, though.<eos> At least not here.<eos> Padre, how did you of all people find me?<eos> Don't let the collar fool you.<eos> I have friends from all walks of life. People who tell me you're the man to see when you run out of options. Ooh, what kind of nasty trouble have you gotten yourself into then?
They were useless.<eos> Couldn't find anything on Arietta. Why not ask your boss then, hey?<eos> The Almighty Himself. I already have.<eos> Oh, no luck?<eos> On the contrary,<eos> I believe he led me to you.<eos> I highly doubt that.<eos> So that's it, is it?<eos> Stop a drug ring to help some kid get out of trouble. What's in it for you?<eos> What is it you really want?
Wrath.<eos> Ooh, not so high and mighty now, are you?<eos> We all have demons inside.<eos> My demon tends the bar.<eos> So come on, what else are you hiding?<eos> Hypocrites like you always have something. You don't know anything about me.<eos> Oh, I know plenty.<eos> You and I are natural sworn enemies.<eos> So, you gonna help me or not?<eos> My answer to you, Father, is a big fat no.
But this is interesting:<eos> one of them was recently reported stolen outside the youth center.<eos> Oh, you think someone inside's responsible.<eos> I think it's too much of a coincidence not to be, but I ordered traffic cam footage, so hopefully it'll show us who was driving.<eos> Couldn't resist, huh?<eos> Well, the man deserves some fun.<eos> Or you still want to prove he's a hypocrite.<eos> Well, what can I say?<eos> Temptation's in my nature. Hmm.<eos> Padre, does this not bother you?
And why was the black widow giving her cash to altar boy?<eos> You never want to carry drugs and money on you at the same time. Makes you a target.<eos> Or because Connor's The Spider.<eos> Ah, from the church shooting.<eos> So the boy the priest was trying to protect is the one who tried to kill him? Well, isn't that an ironic kick in the cassock.<eos> This doesn't prove Connor's The Spider.<eos> It's pretty damning, Father. And it's enough for the APB that just went out.<eos> Ah. Connor's been declared armed and dangerous. Armed and dangerous?<eos> The boy needs to be helped, convinced to turn himself in.<eos> Father, he shot at you.
It's pretty damning, Father. And it's enough for the APB that just went out.<eos> Ah. Connor's been declared armed and dangerous. Armed and dangerous?<eos> The boy needs to be helped, convinced to turn himself in.<eos> Father, he shot at you.<eos> He fired into a room full of kids.<eos> Yes, but he shot up, didn't he? We'll do everything we can to bring him in peacefully.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I... need some air.<eos> Uh... I have some digging to do. Will you watch over him until I get back?<eos> What...? You want me to babysit the priest?<eos> I babysit you all the time.
Where would he hide him?<eos> Somewhere he considers safe, I assume.<eos> Sanctuary.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> I know you. This isn't you. - Sorry,<eos> I don't have a choice, okay? I have to do this.<eos> - I get it.<eos> You don't think you can rely on anyone else to survive-- but you're not alone.<eos> I'm here for you, whenever you need me.<eos> I don't need you! Okay?
Cool? Okay, okay.<eos> Los Diablos. The biker club?<eos> Yeah. I run the warehouse, but they run the docks.<eos> If anything went down, they would know about it.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I swear.<eos> All right, all right. Fine.<eos> That was incredible.<eos> It was musical, poetic really. We were like fish and chips, salt and pepper.<eos> Hipsters and condescension. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't arrest you for assault.
You're not from around here, are you?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> You can't just smash two people together like Barbies, and think that that's gonna fix things.<eos> Relationships, they take time and effort.<eos> And you got to work at it, like... it's your job.<eos> Humans are so exhausting.<eos> Here are the books you wanted to see.<eos> Oh, no, we're not through here.<eos> You assaulted a police officer.<eos> I'm taking you in.

I thought it might.<eos> Now, if you're really serious about embracing the metaphor, Linda-- truly embracing it-- I know how you can get to him. But he might not like what you have to say.<eos> But will it help him?<eos> He may not realize it, but yes.<eos> Then let's do it.<eos> This is the longest I've sat in a parked car and not had sex.<eos> Ew.<eos> You can't enjoy this. This sitting around endlessly, waiting for something to happen.<eos> You know, if sitting here not being entertained is so terrible, then maybe it's a sign you should be somewhere else.<eos> Have I done something to offend you?

So what's the big deal?<eos> What if I am a criminal?<eos> I'd have to arrest you. Ooh, whip out the cuffs, then. Why shy away from a little bondage fun?<eos> You know, Lucifer, this is serious.<eos> And despite all your weirdness I... I actually really like working with you.<eos> So, anyhow...<eos> What a momentous revelation, Detective Decker.<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> You can celebrate from jail when it turns out I'm right about you.<eos> I have never lied to you.
PreviouslyonLucifer...<eos> So how do you afford this place?<eos> It's my mother's.<eos> Your mother's Penelope Decker, queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?<eos> You have to introduce me.<eos> So you're the doctor.<eos> You're just as Lucifer described.<eos> I like you.
All the time. Nothing I did was ever good enough for Pops.<eos> And it never would be, would it?<eos> Which is why he left you with no choice but to take matters into your own hands.<eos> He was like a father to me.<eos> He was like a father to me.<eos> And how was he to everyone else?<eos> Tough, but, ultimately, he was fair.<eos> Uh, he cared about his people.<eos> He was...<eos> "Like a father to you." Yes, we've heard that one before.
Well. Isn't that a coincidence?<eos> Boy returns home, and, conveniently, his pops drops the next day?<eos> Lucky bastard.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe this is about something more than anger, which they all had, but if Junior isn't inheriting the restaurant, then who is?<eos> Well,I 'mglad youdecidedto comehere, but I'm not sure thisisappropriate.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, Lucifer's your boss and a client of mine.<eos> I can recommend you to someone else.<eos> No, I like you.
Board shorts. Don't know what more proof you need that he's deranged.<eos> We're not supposed to be in here.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> So let's just search the place fast.<eos> Oh!<eos> Well, well. Lead the way, Detective.<eos> All right.<eos> I... can... can you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And since when has that bothered you?
Well, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one being taunted, are you?<eos> "Oh, God" this! "Oh, God" that!<eos> He's popping up everywhere and spoiling my favorite things!<eos> I'd really hate to be in your head.<eos> Well, why would you understand?<eos> Your mother's absolutely delightful.<eos> Oh, of course you think she is.<eos> Oh... Do I detect some angst?<eos> She's like a child.<eos> Oh, and I bet it drove you crazy. Yeah.
Trixie!<eos> Thank God you're okay.<eos> What were you thinking, running away like that?<eos> I wanted to see Lucifer.<eos> But he wasn't here.<eos> So I made a new friend.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Mazikeen. But you can call me Maze.<eos> Thank you, Maze.<eos> I didn't say you could.
Police took it away for testing. Well, most of it.<eos> "Heroin"?<eos> No, I came for this.<eos> Careful, Junior, you don't who you're playing with. What?<eos> No.<eos> My dad gave me this knife.<eos> It's all I have left from him.<eos> You're not relieved he's gone at all.<eos> Why would I be relieved?<eos> Because he was judgmental and cruel, and he tried to force you into being someone you're not.
Because he's a part of me, man. You know, he may have pushed too hard, and-and-and tried to make me something that I'm not, but in the end, it made me the man I am.<eos> And I'm proud of who I've become.<eos> Yeah, I came back home so I could tell him that I was clean.<eos> And I want to be a chef again. And this meal?<eos> was what I was gonna make for him to prove it.<eos> I didn't kill my dad.<eos> Well, we are gonna need you to come downtown, and make a statement.<eos> Please. Let me- - I'm happy to have an excuse to leave.<eos> Dan...<eos> Don't go. I wanted one reason to stick up for you.
Since the beginning of time.<eos> That's nice.<eos> What's happening?<eos> It would seem that I'm saying no.<eos> But you've been trying to get me into bed since day one.<eos> Why are you saying no?<eos> Well, frankly, my dear, I'm as baffled as you are.<eos> I mean, usually I'd leap at the chance to fulfill my carnal desire, but... for some reason, I can't.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> Why am I here, drunk, throwing myself at you?
I think it's time to send my brother back to high Heaven.<eos> Forcibly, if necessary.<eos> See, there is something else. It seems Italian marble is also a threat, so...<eos> Oh.<eos> What a surprise. Where have you been?<eos> Ah, you know me... busy, busy. - No rest for the wicked.<eos> - Right.<eos> 'Cause deviant foreplay is so time-consuming. Want to watch?<eos> I've been calling you for three weeks.<eos> Why are you avoiding me?
He's the Devil! I'll rise again against you!<eos> No thanks necessary.<eos> Just wanted to do my part for the man of the hour.<eos> It's the wink with the porn stache sending the wrong message, I think.<eos> Do you two know each other?<eos> Nope, just heard a lot about this guy.<eos> All bad, of course.<eos> Detective Malcolm Graham.<eos> I wasn't gonna tell her we're already buddies.<eos> You know, me trying to kill you, the whole magic coin thing. TMI... am I right?
That some psycho might be killing people because of your whole Devil shtick.<eos> You're blaming this nonsense on me?<eos> You do take the whole Satan thing pretty seriously.<eos> You really think I'd do these vile things?<eos> These kids were pretending to be bad, but they weren't, they were innocent, so I would never hurt them, I'm not a monster.<eos> Okay, guys. That's enough.<eos> Lucifer, maybe you should go home.<eos> Oh, no, allow me to stay in this rusty tin can a little longer.<eos> You came to me, you insisted I work this case.<eos> Okay, this sounds crazy, but this case might involve you. What do you mean, involve me?
Don't you love it?<eos> I mean, of course you do.<eos> I mean, we're the same.<eos> Oh, we are not the same.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I-If you're worried, I've got the perfect person to pin it on:<eos> that street preacher. Genius, right?<eos> Guy's crazy.<eos> Yeah. And I already dropped some evidence, so it's...<eos> But I did this for you.
- The Devil, yes.<eos> And you think you know who that is, don't you?<eos> The whole world does.<eos> A torturer, maybe.<eos> An inflictor of just desserts, sure.<eos> But a senseless murderer I am not.<eos> Perhaps I need to clarify my position. Hey, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I've got this, remember?<eos> Don't worry, Malcolm.<eos> I'm not gonna send you to Hell.

Oh...
This is a waste of time.<eos> I refuse to believe that one of my former lovers would kill another.<eos> Yeah, well, so far we don't have any other connections.<eos> And people will go to crazy lengths for the ones they love, even if they're the ones who suggested the split... and still have feelings, even though they shouldn't.<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> Did I just say that out loud? - Yes.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> Right.<eos> It was an amazing, amazing night.<eos> But the next day, Lucifer was with another woman, so did that make you jealous?

- That was a move I call,<eos> "Gentlemen, start your engines."<eos> It's bloody brilliant.<eos> Did you and Lucifer have any intimate moments?<eos> Obviously, we were intimate.<eos> We were hella intimate.!<eos> Did you not hear about the honey? I mean...<eos> We're talking about, um, emotional intimacy.<eos> Like, um... did Lucifer, bring you dinner?<eos> Or did he do anything special for you?
Well, look, man, the good news is... none of them has motive to be the killer. Because none of them cared enough about me to murder.<eos> Thanks for calling me in.<eos> I actually wanted to speak with you.<eos> Wait a minute, why is she here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I keep telling the detective she's not my ex.<eos> I wanted to tell you that you impressed me.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I underestimated you.
And say, "I am not a crook."<eos> No, it's definitely not Sexy Richard Nixon.<eos> I'm quite certain we've not slept together.<eos> Well, I could have told you that.<eos> Care to explain the wall?<eos> I'm just... really into Lucifer.<eos> And who could blame you.<eos> You're my perfect man.<eos> Like porn and stuffed crust pizza and my Hello Kitty blankie all rolled into one.<eos> I've loved you from afar.
Here's Jana with Raj.<eos> So the two of them knew each other?<eos> Raj is Jana's GBFFN.<eos> Was her GBFFN.<eos> A gay best friend for now.<eos> She sometimes crashed on his couch whenever she was in L.A.<eos> And w-what are these numbers about here?<eos> Date from two days ago.<eos> The last time Lucifer and Jana hooked up.<eos> Right. Much as I admire your dedication to this creepy stalker business, I have to correct you, there was no hookup.
You're welcome.<eos> Captain Pickman, LAPD!<eos> Thank God!<eos> You're a cop.<eos> I was afraid you were trying to kill me.<eos> What?<eos> So, care to explain why you were trying to flee the country?<eos> My two closest friends just got murdered.<eos> I thought I might be next and I was not about to stick around to find out.<eos> Who would try to kill you, Tim?
If only you'd done what was asked of you, I'd still be home!<eos> Enough!<eos> You both used me.<eos> Here. Kill each other.<eos> Evil is here.<eos> Evil is here.<eos> "Morningstar." Whoa.<eos> Somebodycouldbe doingthis onhisbehalf, ormaybehe 'sinvolved ina differentway.<eos> Youdidthis. Youkilledthosepeople.<eos> I did this for you.
Isn't it?<eos> I think this is the grandest joke that I've heard in all my time.<eos> The best part is it's on me!<eos> Come peacefully. We'll go to the station...<eos> No.<eos> We won't.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm accepting my role in all of this.<eos> All of humanity's sins are the devil's fault, right?<eos> I mean, I thought you knew different, but I was wrong.
I know just the person to go to.<eos> Damn, you're good.<eos> Yep.<eos> Where's Lucifer?<eos> Even if I knew, i wouldn't tell you.<eos> You've never liked me.<eos> Why?<eos> Because every day was a party.<eos> Every sin, every desire L.A. offered, we took part.<eos> And then he met you.
You cops must make a lot of money.<eos> You hiring?<eos> We're not, and we don't.<eos> I have no idea how he can afford all this stuff.<eos> Well, if you don't make good money, why do you do this job?<eos> 'Cause I get to shoot people, which is something you should keep in mind. No really.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I hate it when people get away with things they shouldn't.<eos> And you like to shoot people. Yeah.<eos> And to think I almost killed you in your sleep that one time. Wait.
Stop!<eos> Don't move.<eos> Easy, detective.<eos> You're a hard man to find.<eos> Look, I know you think I'm a bad guy, but I'm simply trying to catch our dear friend Malcolm so I can tear his arms and legs off.<eos> This has nothing to do with you. You know I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't know what he's done.<eos> You'd never believe me anyway. But all you need to know is that he's here to get money and then he's gonna disappear.<eos> You mean this money?<eos> I'm not here to arrest you, Lucifer.
Of course.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Detective Decker, step away from your vehicle.<eos> Put your hands in the air and walk towards me peacefully.<eos> If you do not--<eos> I repeat-- if you do not, we will have no choice but to shoot you with our new bazooka.<eos> We've actually been waiting months and months to use it, so, on second thought, please, speed away.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, I could ask you the s...<eos> I could ask you the same thing.
Oh, you're gonna make it rain at the local strip clubs then?<eos> Lucifer...<eos> Or perhaps that phone call earlier wasn't as innocuous as you made it out to be.<eos> Fine. You leave me no choice.<eos> Malcolm has trixie.<eos> Oh. If I get him his money, he'll let her go.<eos> Because if Malcolm's established anything, it's his trustworthiness.<eos> What choice do I have?<eos> To ride shotgun with the devil, for starters.<eos> If Malcolm sees you, he'll kill her.

So you're just gonna get both of you killed then, are you?
Apparently, he wants me back here.<eos> Sorry, pal.<eos> One use only.<eos> Trixie!<eos> Come out, honey!<eos> Mommy, is it over? Yeah, baby, it's over.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hi. Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.<eos> Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.<eos> I thought he killed you.
What do you eat?<eos> Cereal.<eos> Cereal's up there.<eos> I'm just getting milk, OK?<eos> So you cheated.<eos> No.<eos> You admit your friend did.<eos> No.<eos> Miss, I don't have a soft spot for top students, unlike all my colleagues,<eos> I feel more sympathy for your friend than you.
Done?<eos> It's the gloves.<eos> - Take them off.<eos> - Remove the sheet.<eos> We're starting.<eos> Geez. What a pain.<eos> You may begin. You have an hour.<eos> Sorry for your sis.<eos> No shit.<eos> I thought you hated her.
Uh, yeah, I have to think about it a little bit, but--<eos> The, uh, old GC's office is on this floor.<eos> Wow, so you'd... Then you would be right here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's great--<eos> special Agent Cameron Chase, with the FBI.<eos> I'm here for Winslow Schott, Jr.<eos> That's me.<eos> I'm sure you're aware that your father escaped prison this morning.<eos> - Has he called you?
- That's great--<eos> special Agent Cameron Chase, with the FBI.<eos> I'm here for Winslow Schott, Jr.<eos> That's me.<eos> I'm sure you're aware that your father escaped prison this morning.<eos> - Has he called you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Has he come to your house?<eos> -(SIGHING) No.<eos> Has he attempted to contact you in any way?
(GASPS)<eos> I thought this was your greatest work.<eos> We're the same, you and I. We're linked.<eos> Together we can do anything.<eos> We are... We are not the same.<eos> That genius that lesser people call madness. That's inside of you too.<eos> We got eyes on Schott.<eos> tactical teams, mobilize.<eos> all right, let's go.<eos> We can't do our job and worry about you too.
DOLL:<eos> I told you to come alone.<eos> Now run.<eos> - What?<eos> -(ANGRILY) Run.<eos> (GAS HISSING)<eos> (COUGHING)<eos> AGENT CHASE:<eos> He specifically asked you to come to this arcade?<eos> Does your father have some sort of plan for you?
(GAS HISSING)<eos> (COUGHING)<eos> AGENT CHASE:<eos> He specifically asked you to come to this arcade?<eos> Does your father have some sort of plan for you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He said, "I broke out of prison for you, for us."<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> He called you his "greatest work." And he said, "Together we can do anything."
-(SIGHS) Then why were they there?<eos> - I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> You seem to know a lot more about them than I do.<eos> To Alex Danvers.<eos> Hero in her own right.<eos> Mr. Lord?<eos> Aren't you supposed to be out with Agent Danvers?<eos> I ended the evening early.<eos> To be honest, it was a little disappointing.<eos> As long as we're being honest, she did strike rne as a little humorless for you.
(CAMERA CLICKS)<eos> (CAMERA CLICKING)<eos> What is he doing to you?<eos> Freeze!<eos> Mr. Lord.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Silent alarm went off.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> I was just checking on her.<eos> I'lI leave you alone.
There's been severe tissue damage to his frontal and temporal lobes.<eos> His memory's been permanently affected.<eos> I need to see the security tapes.<eos> We checked them.<eos> Someone wiped them all clean.<eos> That's why I set up invisible backups on all top priority systems.<eos> 8:07.<eos> - I was out with Agent Danvers.<eos> - How'?<eos> I saw you only minutes before this, so...
Oh, I like that angle.<eos> It gives our girl the benefit of the doubt. It shows that we're choosing not to believe the worst in people.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I can see the headline clearly now.<eos> The word Supergirl, with a question mark.<eos> As in, "Supergirl?"<eos> Hmm.<eos> That's good, that's good.<eos> All right, everybody get out.<eos> Ms. Grant, um, can I ask you a question?
Just remember, the world is a very complicated place, kiddo.<eos> Sometimes things that seem to be good, are really very, very bad.<eos> It's you.<eos> It's always been you.<eos> Remind me what it is I'm meant to have done this time?<eos> I know about the girls, Max.<eos> - Those women had lives.<eos> - They were brain dead.<eos> Zero chance of recovery.<eos> You treated them like guinea pigs.
This is Lieutenant Non of Krypton.<eos> We each possess someone of great value to the other.<eos> I propose a trade.<eos> This is Acting Director Alex Danvers.<eos> Excuse me if I don't take you at your word.<eos> I need proof of life. I need to hear from Henshaw himself.<eos> HANK:<eos> Director Danvers.<eos> Congratulations on your promotion.<eos> I will bring you back safe, sir.
I will return Henshaw unharmed if you return General Astra safely to me.<eos> You have 48 hours or your man dies.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Now we know why Non took Hank.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> If I turn down the deal, Non kills Hank.<eos> If I go through with it, I free a criminal with the strength of you.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> General Lane.<eos> Well, pleasure to see you again, Agent Danvers.
Our job is to report the truth.<eos> (SCOFFS) What an outstanding job you've all been doing.<eos> Champion low gas prices, so we continue to burn fossil fuels.<eos> You celebrate pop stars while ignoring corrupt politicians.<eos> And you turn pretty blondes who fly into heroes, masking the threat they represent.<eos> But you've never been their victim.<eos> It changes your perspective.<eos> What are you planning on doing?<eos> What needs to be done.<eos> My associates will take you back to your car.
-(MAXWELL SIGHS) -(GROANS)<eos> - Human, alien, super.<eos> -(METAL CLANGS)<eos> - If you go up against me, you will lose.<eos> (EXCLAIMS)<eos> (CLATTERING)<eos> (JAMES PANTING)<eos> Next time... I won't stop with the camera.<eos> (PANTING)<eos> May I speak with you, Ms. Grant?
Oh, well, that depends.<eos> Show me your cape.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> I know you want me to tell you I'm Supergirl, but I can't do that.<eos> What I can tell you is that this job, this place, is more important to me than you realize.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Whenever I'm confused or overwhelmed, I come in your office and you somehow sense it.<eos> It's like your superpower.<eos> I know I'm not going to be your assistant for the rest of my life, but I do know whatever I do next will be easier because of everything you taught me.<eos> And the truth is, I need you now more than I ever have.
(SIGHS)<eos> Then it's a good thing I'm not human.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Making a prisoner exchange.<eos> - The hell you are.<eos> -(GUNS COCKING)<eos> Let us pass, General.<eos> That alien is the enemy, Agent Danvers.<eos> Your orders were to bring Director Henshaw home. That's what I'm doing.<eos> You take one more step and my men will put you down.
But I have faith.<eos> Despite your earlier bravado, you're clearly conflicted about this deal.<eos> If it were up to me, I'd leave you rotting in that cell.<eos> But I want your people to see that we're better than General Lane, because maybe then we'll find a way to end this war.<eos> You sound just like my niece.<eos> She has a powerful effect on people.<eos> They're here.<eos> Go.<eos> ALEX:<eos> It's good to see you, sir.
This bottle will not refill itself.<eos> Good night, Ms. Grant.<eos> Kara.<eos> -(WHOOSHES)<eos> - And Ker-rah, you can have your job back if you would like it.<eos> As long as you don't tell anyone that I thought you were...<eos> You know.<eos> I think that would be in both of our interests, Ms. Grant.<eos> And Ker-rah, I was wrong.<eos> Now, that I've seen you both in the same room, you look nothing like her.
I think that would be in both of our interests, Ms. Grant.<eos> And Ker-rah, I was wrong.<eos> Now, that I've seen you both in the same room, you look nothing like her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> But, you know, I wouldn't have minded you coming to work for the DEO full time.<eos> (SIGHS) I can't leave this place.<eos> It's not just a secret identity to me.<eos> I almost did something today that I would've regretted the rest of my life.<eos> What stopped you?
Miranda Crane is in town.<eos> She is a lightning rod for bigots, hippies and aliens, and, yes, that is the order in which I detest them.<eos> Our top reporter has made the mistake of dumping Catco for a cash grab at Vanity Fair.<eos> His ruin will be swift and merciless, thanks to Lucy, who will serve him a lawsuit by the end of today.<eos> - That's not how it works--<eos> - By the end of today.<eos> Meanwhile, we need someone to get to the rally.<eos> Ker-rah, get me a list of who's available.<eos> Actually, I'll do it.<eos> - You have layouts to do.
I was just trying to help you.<eos> You know my mom died.<eos> I don't get to have a second chance with her.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you and Adam.<eos> You crossed a line, Ker-rah.<eos> You don't know him. I don't even know him.<eos> I haven't seen him since he was a baby, since his father whisked him across the country.<eos> - I told you--<eos> - You told me that losing Adam was the biggest regret of your life.<eos> Ms. Grant, I've known you for a while now, and I don't think you were ever going to send that letter.
(CHUCKLES) I guess you forgot the part where I saved your ass.<eos> Mmm. For all I know, you all staged that little stunt.<eos> It's just like an alien.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're all the same.<eos> Disgusting insects who've come crawling from your own diseased, backwater planets looking to suck our resources for yourselves.<eos> - Ow!<eos> - Sedative.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> My team and I are currently tracking your attacker. We'll keep you updated.
Then I scared it off.<eos> Thankfully.<eos> Because I couldn't fight it today.<eos> - I couldn't even move.<eos> - You will next time.<eos> And you're not alone.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> In the meantime, we'll keep Senator Crane here.<eos> It's the safest place around.<eos> I have to ask something of you.
And what makes you think I'll be safe here?<eos> What are you getting at, Senator?<eos> Nothing except whispers in Washington that say you need to clean house.<eos> They say Supergirl's not the only alien inside the DEO.<eos> You've got a mole, Henshaw.<eos> Madam, I trust you won't be insulted if I called you paranoid.<eos> God knows I wouldn't be the first.<eos> Some aliens can look like anyone.<eos> Well, we may not have much in common, but I think it's safe to say neither one of us enjoys the idea of an alien spy working within your walls.<eos> And if it became public, well, that would certainly be very embarrassing for you.
I'm going after it.<eos> You stay here.<eos> (PANTING) Hank needs you.<eos> Alex, it's fled. Again.<eos> ALEX ON COMMS:<eos> I'll work on a plan with Hank.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> (PHONE BUZZING)<eos> - Ms. Grant, everything okay?<eos> - No, I need you in the office...
- Ms. Grant, everything okay?<eos> - No, I need you in the office...<eos> Now.<eos> (ALARM BLARES)<eos> Hank.<eos> - J'onn--<eos> - I should have known.<eos> -(SIGHS) This isn't your fault.<eos> -(SIGHS)<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.
I can wear any face I choose.<eos> I speak languages your mouth can't even form.<eos> You know nothing about me.<eos> - What about the real Senator Crane?<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> -(SIGHS)<eos> You said it yourself, "We don't choose who we protect."<eos> - So if she's alive, we have to find her.<eos> I know you believe in honor.
She's alive.<eos> - This ends tonight.<eos> - WHITE MARTIAN:<eos> The desert.<eos> It reminds me of home.<eos> Come now so I can water the ground with your blood, J'onn J'onzz.<eos> Or you can let another child die.<eos> She's in the desert.<eos> You get Alex and get out.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone with that thing.
-Yeah, I got it,<eos> I got it, I got it.<eos> All right, keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.<eos> We don't want to give this deviant a reason to go Dirty Harry on us.<eos> How are you today, ma'am?<eos> I know my civil rights, that's how I am.<eos> -Good afternoon, Officer.<eos> -Ma'am.<eos> I demand to know why you pulled me over.<eos> And be informed, I'm filming you.
This is my heroin.<eos> Now, I'm not supposed to tell anybody, so keep quiet about it.<eos> There we go.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Holy fuck.<eos> That's good.<eos> Better than a good shit in the morning.<eos> That's my favorite thing.<eos> Oh, sweetie, that's everybody's favorite thing.<eos> Don't go thinking that makes you original.
Hmm... What?<eos> Half a piece of shit.<eos> But there's always time for change.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> There's literally nothing for me to do.<eos> She's in max.<eos> I can't do anything for her.<eos> And maybe she doesn't even deserve it, even if I could do something.<eos> Well, everybody deserves kindness.<eos> Oh, God, I really got you on that one.
Well, did you make it about her?<eos> Or did you make it about yourself?<eos> I apologized to her.<eos> I thought you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> That makes my apology even more meaningful.<eos> Only if it's genuine.<eos> - Who made up all these rules?<eos> Do you want me to call you a piece of shit again?
- Which is absurd, firstly.<eos> And why does the US Attorney's Office give a shit?<eos> Corrado Galasso.<eos> How long you been working for him? - I don't work for Corrado Galasso.<eos> - Richie.<eos> He loaned me money.<eos> I'm paying him back with a pound of flesh.<eos> You know what? Arraign my client and let's call it a day, guys. Come on, this is bullshit.<eos> - Your client's going to trial.<eos> - We send you upstate.
So Jack and the Ride was 50 for the band, but that was only for six pieces, so you got to start thinking smaller, buddy.<eos> I don't want backup. I want orchestration.<eos> Like it matters.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr. Yankovich, this is Kinderly Hall from Hilton Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.<eos> - How are you today?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> But it's night here. East Coast.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just wanted to extend our gratitude to you for your patronage and to tell you that as a premium player, we'd like to offer you a return visit with our compliments.
- I'm good.<eos> But it's night here. East Coast.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just wanted to extend our gratitude to you for your patronage and to tell you that as a premium player, we'd like to offer you a return visit with our compliments.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I drink free all night?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> But we'd also like to fly you here in our private airliner and host you in one of our VIP suites.<eos> May I call you tomorrow to discuss it?
It's not easy for me to say.<eos> Our corporate bylaws have a morals clause that call for the removal of any officer engaged in any immoral or unethical behavior.<eos> What I'm saying is I can get rid of him.<eos> All it takes is a vote by the other partners.<eos> So, what can I do to help?<eos> I just came for your support.<eos> Want to keep you apprised of what's happening.<eos> Mostly I wanted you to hear it from me.<eos> Man-to-man.<eos> I hear you loud and clear.
Sure. We'll finish later?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Want me to leave?<eos> - No, you should hear this, too.<eos> I got some bad news for you, kid.<eos> American Century, please hold.<eos> Some asshole tracked dog shit in the elevator, so just get maintenance.<eos> Zak, Richie was asking if you're around.<eos> He's in with Mr. Galasso.<eos> American Century, how can I help you?
North.<eos> I saw a helicopter landing across the border.<eos> Medevac.<eos> It landed in a camp.<eos> Your people never have to know. They'll never find out.<eos> If they follow you... There's a weight that comes.<eos> Luciana and i will do it together.<eos> - Luciana wants to stay.<eos> - Not for the place.<eos> She wants to stay for the people and for you.
- Hey!<eos> Leslie, wait!<eos> Leslie!<eos> What do you think about all this time?<eos> So...<eos> Maybe Gideon planned to fall in love with him, But then he may have... so to speak...<eos> I gentle<eos> Not quite excluded, but...<eos> - (Whitman) Miss Shepherd, Miss Hay!<eos> The lessons are for you too!
Ha!<eos> Ilaut, mitreilSend (Fighting noise)<eos> Charlotte!<eos> J 'end<eos> Years of training...<eos> Watch out!<eos> J 'loud, then end<eos> What happened here?<eos> I quiet, exciting<eos> (Bernard) Miss Gwendolyn, we need to get you safely.
- (Gwen) Charlotte?<eos> - I'm here in Gideon's loft.<eos> No safe line...<eos> I calm, but exciting<eos> Ahm, yes, here...<eos> Here speaks...<eos> Violet Purpleplum.<eos> Miss Montrose, how are you?<eos> Has the storm been laid?<eos> Yes, Miss Purpleplum, It will surely keep you from hearing that our common friend,
(Gwen) L...<eos> Lucy...<eos> (Paul sits)<eos> Visit me again, if I am jiinger, then we train together!<eos> My failure is unforgivable, revered Grand Master.<eos> All right, Miss Montrose.<eos> J 'quiet, exciting<eos> It all went so fast, and... it was so dark.<eos> I really thought they were burglars.<eos> I am grateful to you for disappointing you and the Lodge.
Come in.<eos> You got voicemail trouble?<eos> Uh, typical corporate Charlie Foxtrot.<eos> This is why I don't wear a suit.<eos> This... and my quads are too big.<eos> Uh, don't... wait.<eos> Hey. Don't close that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm Piper Chapman.<eos> I don't mean to alarm you.
My wife always said they were safe in an accident.<eos> But they still couldn't pull any bodies from the car wreck of our marriage.<eos> You are bad.<eos> Well... you see anything here you like?<eos> Uh... definitely.<eos> Uh, what would you recommend?<eos> Well, the Gran Turismo is awesome, but the Gran Cabrio always gives me a special little tingle.<eos> The Gran Cabrio it is.<eos> We're just gonna need some ID and I'll go hook you up with the keys.<eos> How can we help you today, Mrs...
Ain't he cute?<eos> Very distinguished.<eos> His name is Edward.<eos> All right, Mrs. Spencer.<eos> You are all set.<eos> You can take the one down in front in Etruscan onyx.<eos> Uh, Etruscan...<eos> Between the classic obsidian and the midnight noir.<eos> Oh, the Etruscan onyx!<eos> Wait till you feel this transaxle layout.
How did you guys meet?<eos> Ooh, feel that bass!<eos> - What kind of meat?<eos> - I just love hair metal!<eos> Meet!<eos> Where did you meet?<eos> Can you pull over?<eos> I think I'm gonna be sick!<eos> Are you gonna check on her?<eos> I was gonna ask you the same.
Wait, you know, too?<eos> Know what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, you're safe.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who are those guys, huh?<eos> Why did they kidnap you?
- Come on. He's not an accountant. And his name's not Albert Toland, at least not his only name.<eos> I ran his photo through Interpol, cross-referenced with FSB, Mossad.<eos> He's an assassin. A professional hit man.<eos> Being an accountant, apparently, is just a cover.<eos> But wait, I don't get it.<eos> What was he doing at that private school?<eos> I thought he was there to meet you, to flip on Voynov. That's what he wanted us to think, that he was an innocent, to get to Vincent.<eos> Which means Vincent's in trouble.<eos> Come on.<eos> You mind if I ask you a question? Sure.
Me?<eos> I'm an accountant.<eos> Thought so.<eos> Something tells me that's not true.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> Why didn't you tell your wife the truth? Is Judy okay?<eos> The boys?<eos> Yeah, they're fine.<eos> Just think she's a little confused that someone's trying to kidnap you for $2 million that she doesn't even know you have.
Try? Vincent might not have time for me to try.<eos> It has to be right.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> At least now I know why I was told to be careful with you.<eos> So what are you?<eos> Some kind of experiment gone wrong or something?<eos> Or something.<eos> I thought you were supposed to capture me, not kill me.<eos> Not what I was told.<eos> Come on, who sent you?
Come, they're upstairs.<eos> Good afternoon, everyone.<eos> Pretty smart, hiding in your own house.<eos> - And now?<eos> - I believe I can help you.<eos> But there must be mutual trust.<eos> Coffee?<eos> - You're new.<eos> - I've been working here for years.<eos> I've served you many times before.
Just look into the lens.<eos> I've thought about what you said.<eos> That you were willing to help us.<eos> We're afraid we'll lose our house.<eos> So maybe we can do it this way.<eos> We have to help one another, don't we?<eos> - Two more whiskies. - Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> And if you think very hard?<eos> No, I've already referred to you everyone I trust, Dries.
No, I've already referred to you everyone I trust, Dries.<eos> Some people think you're my lover.<eos> They see us together so often.<eos> Well, if I'd been born 20 years earlier...<eos> You said you could help me get to England by way of Antwerp.<eos> - True.<eos> Eventually.<eos> - I think it's time.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> This... is for you.
- True.<eos> Eventually.<eos> - I think it's time.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> This... is for you.<eos> Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers.<eos> - Is this not more for Catholics?<eos> - As long as it works.<eos> It brought me to you.<eos> I hope it will protect you too.

And don't lie to me.<eos> She worked at the SD, but she's been fired.<eos> - So she just breaks in here?<eos> - I know, I told her the same thing.<eos> She's a bit confused.<eos> But now she has to leave.<eos> - And my parents?<eos> - I'll take care of it. Here.<eos> Money for the train.<eos> And if I see you ever again, I will kill you and your parents.
Wasn't it destroyed?<eos> Betje.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> Betje, from Rotterdam.<eos> Betje...<eos> Betje Wery, with a 'y'.<eos> And you say Betje and Jan betrayed Gerrit van der Veen? Yes.<eos> You belonged to that group, right?<eos> You guys raided the State Printing House.<eos> - You stole hundreds of ID cards.
- Greet, what's in those lockers?<eos> - It really concerns a lot of money.<eos> And that's what Jan is after.<eos> It's not about me.<eos> It's about those innocent people's money.<eos> If Jan finds me, those people won't ever get it back.<eos> It will all have been in vain.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> Wim won't be here for a week.<eos> - I can't just let you go.

Put that thing away.<eos> You can't kill me.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> Then you'll have to kill my wife too. And Harry Rond.<eos> And Lame Toon.<eos> And ten others who know I'm here.<eos> What did you think, dirty little Communist?<eos> Shall I tell you something, Wim Sanders?<eos> I played you like a violin.
And ten others who know I'm here.<eos> What did you think, dirty little Communist?<eos> Shall I tell you something, Wim Sanders?<eos> I played you like a violin.<eos> Betje Wery did exactly what I told her.<eos> I betrayed Gerrit van der Veen's group.<eos> It was me.<eos> I was there when they shot Badrian's brains out.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - Yes, I've been lying to you for weeks.
It was me.<eos> I was there when they shot Badrian's brains out.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - Yes, I've been lying to you for weeks.<eos> But you didn't realize it, did you?<eos> Einthoven is laughing his butt off.<eos> You'll be the laughing stock of the office.<eos> And to think of all those people I had you round up and execute.<eos> Go ahead, shoot me.<eos> No, I'm not going to kill you.
- Tell me where he is.<eos> - He won't stop.<eos> When I find him, I'll make him talk.<eos> He's playing everyone.<eos> I'll get him to confess he forced you.<eos> He has to die.<eos> Otherwise I won't talk.<eos> I promise.<eos> He's at Kerkhoven's.<eos> I'll call you when I'm across the border.

Or just show her your dick.<eos> There's a pretty good chance she's gonna lap that shit up.<eos> Don't get upset.<eos> It's silly.<eos> It's a silly joke.<eos> Look, I'm not a misogynistic pig.<eos> I think women should judge men equally and harshly.<eos> You know what never fails?<eos> Judge men based on what they drive.<eos> Ladies... if a guy picks you up in a minivan, he is telling you,
And then a few seconds later, I feel a bear paw on my shoulder.<eos> And I turn, and Tyson is standing above me.<eos> I'm like, "Jesus Christ!"<eos> Immediately he leans down and he whispers in my ear so nobody else can hear, and he goes, "I've been watching a lot of Netflix."<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, I never thought that sentence could be terrifying.<eos> And now he's just looking at me like, "Now you say something, bitch."<eos> Ya know? I was like, "I never turn it off.<eos> It's the best." I don't know what to say.<eos> He goes, "Now I recognize you."
Some come in just to get clothes, but we also do job placement and mentoring.<eos> Oh. I will be right back with your donation receipt.<eos> May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, it fits you perfectly.<eos> Not everyone can carry off canary yellow.<eos> We're the lucky ones.<eos> It's not too bright?<eos> I'm interviewing to be a bank teller.<eos> You wear a bright color like that, you'll be even more memorable.
-Thanks, Coyote.<eos> -Thank you!<eos> -Get out here!<eos> -I feel stupid, OK?<eos> This shirt's an idiot.<eos> Very good.<eos> Stop futzing.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> You have a migraine or something?<eos> I'm trying to imagine what you'll look like at the interview without that bracelet in your nose.
Well, this was a good excuse to stop by the new office.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Is this why you couldn't hire me back?<eos> You spent all your money on windows?<eos> And how is my favorite former intern?<eos> Oh, so good.<eos> Can I just say, you not paying me was probably the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> I still can't believe I didn't know you moved in with Eric.<eos> Well, this is what happens when you skip SoulCycle.<eos> Hi, Grace. It is so good to see you again.
You do not get me at all.<eos> OK? You have no idea how hard I've had it.<eos> -'Cause I've had it so easy?<eos> -Haven't you, Miss Beach House?<eos> Listen to me, missy.<eos> I have worked since I was 15, and the only reason I stopped was because I retired from a business that I built.<eos> You've had it so hard?<eos> Try being a woman in her 70s. Talk about being invisible.<eos> People act like you don't know anything, that you don't count.<eos> Well, screw that, and screw you!

No, just the usual things.<eos> Just feelings of being overwhelmed.<eos> The terseness of your email made it sound specific and time-related.<eos> Are you looking for something?<eos> - No. - No?<eos> I'm just admiring.<eos> I'm better now. How's work?<eos> It's great.<eos> When I last spoke to them, they believed you were a model employee.<eos> They found you meticulous and conscientious.
I see.<eos> Now, I see. That's clever.<eos> That's clever, but I'm not Dennis.<eos> And you and Patricia have been banned from the light for quite a while now. Primarily, shall we say, because of your beliefs.<eos> Patricia and Dennis are very unstable.<eos> I'm not Dennis.<eos> Have you both taken charge now?<eos> Please believe me, I'm Barry.<eos> You must forgive me.<eos> My job is to challenge you.
We have been talking about silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.<eos> Can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night for an emergency session due to garden-variety issues?<eos> I was down and I emailed you and I woke up and I feel better.<eos> I feel better.<eos> I had a thought.<eos> I want to talk about the incident at work.<eos> It's okay, Barry.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I just want to bring the details back. We'll just talk about the details.<eos> A high school from Camden, New Jersey was on a field trip at your place of work and two young ladies came up to you.
We're all here to protect Kevin.<eos> He's very weak.<eos> He doesn't know how powerful we can be.<eos> Would you mind telling me when you first came into existence?<eos> And how you and Patricia, the other undesirable identity, became aligned?<eos> That's okay.<eos> Do you still have strong beliefs?<eos> That depends on what.<eos> This story of The Beast.<eos> One thing, Dennis, that may comfort you if you are confused is that you've met the other alters.
I must be near you. I'm being held in a basement or something.<eos> Okay, Betty, listen.<eos> Tell Larry and Fish I said hi.<eos> Tell him I still got his orange headphones.<eos> I don't know where I am.<eos> There's a man here.<eos> He abducted us and he's going to kill me.<eos> I only have a few hours left.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm begging you.
Could have killed me.<eos> - This place is closed.<eos> You can't get in. - No, it's okay.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Hello, Dennis.<eos> One of the others emailed me just now.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Dennis,<eos> Kevin is really lucky to have you.
Hello, Dennis.<eos> One of the others emailed me just now.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Dennis,<eos> Kevin is really lucky to have you.<eos> You are quite extraordinary.<eos> I just don't want you guys to get hurt.<eos> You think we're extraordinary?<eos> I like you, Dennis.
I wanna talk about<eos> Kevin and what his mother did to him.<eos> I remember it all.<eos> I'm happy you're suddenly so open.<eos> Kevin's mother had rather malevolent ways of punishing a three-year-old.<eos> Is that when you arrived in the light? Yeah.<eos> The one way to avoid her attention was to keep everything spotless, everything perfect.<eos> I know you're coming from good intentions, Dennis, but there are other ways to help Kevin now.<eos> I've lost so many patients into the system.<eos> I want you to know, Dennis, I will never stop fighting for you.
The broken are the more evolved.<eos> Rejoice.<eos> What in the name of Mary and Joseph?<eos> What are you doing in this area?<eos> Just keep walking, honey.<eos> They won't do nothing.<eos> Vince, call the police.<eos> She said some people got hurt in the area below maintenance.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, I'm just gonna check you.
You want answers, ask Grace Rose.<eos> Thanks to her report on DHS cover-ups, I'm under official investigation.<eos> What for? Grace Rose doesn't even know anything.<eos> The press doesn't have to know anything.<eos> They just have to ask questions.<eos> Yeah, like, what does DHS know about beasts?<eos> How'd you answer that one?<eos> Well, I couldn't exactly tell the Secretary of Homeland Security that I lied, covered up the existence of the last beast on the planet, now could I?<eos> Well, at least we still have that.<eos> Well, I'm glad you see the glass as half full, Agent Chandler, because I nearly lost my life protecting you two.
Well, I'm glad you see the glass as half full, Agent Chandler, because I nearly lost my life protecting you two.<eos> Now my career is at risk, as well.<eos> And I'm not the only one.<eos> Major Fuller?<eos> My old C.O. from Afghanistan.<eos> Colonel Fuller.<eos> Up for his first star.<eos> With the Internet and media digging into the Super Soldier program, well, he can kiss his career good-bye, too.<eos> Why? Because he tried to eliminate every soldier in his unit who was experimented on.<eos> Including myself. I ran a background on that sniper who attacked you in your apartment. Turns out he was formerly in Fuller's unit.
Who is it?<eos> Unknown caller.<eos> Vincent said not to answer the phone.<eos> Yeah, but what if it's Grace Rose.<eos> Or better yet, the Beast Buyer.<eos> Uh, Professor Forbes's office.<eos> Uh, please hold. What did you do that for?<eos> Like I said, something has to change.<eos> Go on.<eos> This is Professor Forbes, can I help you?
Let me check my schedule.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Somebody named Dr. Paretti wants to interview me for a job at Tanirushi.<eos> Tanirushi?<eos> Yeah. Why would the number one biotech company in the world want to hire you?<eos> A minute ago you, were hugging me and calling me Mr. Amazing.<eos> JT, I never called you that, not even when we were dating.<eos> I mean, please, a hot job offer out of the blue?<eos> Give me this.<eos> No. Mr. Forbes will meet you at Il Cantuccio in one hour.
In case you forgot, I'm pretty dangerous on my own.<eos> Vincent Keller?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Trying to figure out why you sent an assassin, and then a team of snipers to kill me.<eos> Come on, Colonel, what was next-- ground troops?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I didn't send anyone to kill you. Really? So now you're a murderer and a liar?<eos> Neither.<eos> Trust me, Keller, if I wanted you dead then or now, I'd have it done.<eos> Right back at you, Colonel.
12 years ago, I was following orders.<eos> You murdered soldiers.<eos> It was a military operation.<eos> They were your men!<eos> And my friends, my platoon.<eos> Failed experiments.<eos> They were dangers to their country.<eos> I was ordered to terminate the operation, before it got out of control!<eos> You should've killed me when you had the chance, because now you're gonna get to see what it really looks like when I'm out of control.<eos> I did have a chance to shoot you.
You think I missed?<eos> Stop lying to me.<eos> I never disobeyed an order until that day.<eos> Stop lying to me!<eos> You were better than the others, Vincent.<eos> Whatever had been done to you, I knew the man you'd been.<eos> The man maybe you could still be.<eos> That man didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, because if you're, you're telling the truth--<eos> Whoever's trying to kill you now, it isn't me.
Yeah, well, I guess neither one of us is good at following orders, Colonel.<eos> Now, keep pressure on this. Okay? Otherwise you're gonna bleed to death.<eos> You never walk away from helping people. Even now.<eos> Keller?<eos> Whoever set you up, they're not gonna stop.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Catherine...<eos> Go...<eos> Go!<eos> I'm not letting you get away.
Where am I?<eos> Homeland Security sometimes finds it useful to question suspected terrorists privately.<eos> Fine, you want to question me?<eos> Go ahead, but I am no terrorist.<eos> You set off a bomb on a military base.<eos> A bomb you gave me!<eos> You tried to set me up so I could kill Fuller. Colonel Fuller was an unforeseen casualty.<eos> You, you were the target, Vincent.<eos> A target that's turning out to be pretty hard to kill.<eos> Catherine and I, we risked everything to help you.

Colonel Fuller was an unforeseen casualty.<eos> You, you were the target, Vincent.<eos> A target that's turning out to be pretty hard to kill.<eos> Catherine and I, we risked everything to help you.<eos> You supposed to be protecting us!<eos> I almost died for it. In front of my wife and my daughter.<eos> Now I don't know who put a bounty out on your head, but I told you and your wife to end this before it blew back on me.<eos> My whole career is on the line.<eos> You beasting out is exactly what I need to prove that I shot you in self-defense.
I tracked Vincent's earpiece to 62nd Street near the airport.<eos> You want Tess to send backup?<eos> I think I'm bringing my own.<eos> You really don't want to do this, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> But I don't have a choice.<eos> No, no, no, we all have a choice.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Someone made you into... this.<eos> And someone's always gonna want you dead because of it.
Learn fast, any means necessary.<eos> Which is why I'm so pleased to see you sitting there like you don't have an Emerson's in your pocket to repel any spell to wipe your mind.<eos> You stole that.<eos> Who stole it?<eos> Relax, nobody's taking your mind today.<eos> We'll make something of you yet.<eos> I'll tell the school one more chance, probation.<eos> They'll respect my call.<eos> Don't make me regret it.<eos> Don't hop back on the garden path like some little lemming, or I'll erase everything and start you over entirely, for your own good.
- Power over the future.<eos> - He's back.<eos> - The very world that exists around you...<eos> He said he had an announcement.<eos> - But power, as you all know, does not come cheaply.<eos> There are reasons we teach this curriculum precisely the way that we do.<eos> Skipping around, focusing on all the wrong things, lack of guidance... these are all extremely dangerous.<eos> There are certain energies, certain spells, which are far too powerful for one magician alone.<eos> If you lose control, they will turn against you.<eos> They will kill you.

You and, uh, Drew are moving to Portland?<eos> Toby eavesdropped again.<eos> No opinion on the matter?<eos> Well, Portland's cold.<eos> That i... Th-That is the same useless information Walter gave me.<eos> Okay, facts aren't useless.<eos> They're the foundation of rational thought.<eos> And I think Ralph will be bored there.<eos> Uh, well, you know, I think...<eos> I think you geniuses hide behind a pile of facts and figures when you don't want to engage in something... unpleasant, like the idea of Ralph and me leaving.

He walked 20 minutes ago.<eos> And we've already filed a restraining order against Agent Hardy.<eos> Dr. Strauss, how does it feel to be walking out of court a free man?<eos> Honestly, it feels like justice.<eos> My office, now, the 3 of you.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> It's Clarke's E-mail, the one from court today, on our secure server, time-stamped and logged like it's been here all along.<eos> Well, someone must have hacked into the server - and put it there.<eos> - Our cyber guys said that's virtually impossible, but it gets worse because now the DOJ's opening up an official investigation into the 3 of you based on what happened in court today.

It won't make a difference.<eos> Director Franklin already told me to suspend the 3 of you the minute I see you, which I will do when I see you tomorrow morning.
Because there is not only to understand the deer<eos> The animals play chess there, from morning to night<eos> But trust the bear not The Bumble where's just going<eos> Even in heaven<eos> Even in heaven<eos> Do you have what to eat?<eos> The have recently fallen from 'nem vices.<eos> What Hot perhaps?<eos> Yes, I've citizens and Pizza.<eos> The I can warm you.
He was put into a psychiatric hospital.<eos> I can't remember which one.<eos> Oh, yeah, call me back.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - What is going on?<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> What is this, an intervention?<eos> I can't believe you're ganging up on rne.
Don't you understand?<eos> We are not superhuman.<eos> We can't fight every fight. No one can.<eos> And I don't want to die trying.<eos> - I agree with Cat.<eos> - Heather, please.<eos> Not now.<eos> Look, I know that I am relatively new to this whole beast/superhuman thing, but I'm not new to being a sister.<eos> She's the only family I have left.<eos> And I don't want to lose her, or any of you.
- Claimed I was part of an American spy operation.<eos> Credentials don't mean shit when they decide you're a spy.<eos> Finally, day four, this guy shows up from Doctors Without Borders, saying he's my boss, gets me out of jail.<eos> "Saying" he's your boss?<eos> Never seen him before in my life.<eos> Turns out he's not with Doctors Without Borders at all.<eos> - He's with the...<eos> - US State Department.<eos> Well, that's not the first time I played doctor.<eos> - That's how you guys met? - Uh-huh.
It's just, uh, old man thinks they'll come back, so... We're headed off to Faraldo's headquarters.<eos> You should come, too.<eos> But they're not after us.<eos> They came to my apartment.<eos> Who knows how that mother found us.<eos> Safety in numbers, right?<eos> You should go if you want.<eos> Yeah, well, we'll talk about it.<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> Be safe, you two.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's great to hear your voice.<eos> Really great.<eos> I'm fine...<eos> I miss you too.
Don't!<eos> I gave you the badge. Wait!<eos> Perez!<eos> - Perez, you alive?<eos> - Elizalde?<eos> - What the hell you doing here?<eos> - I'm here to get you out.<eos> Best idea I heard all day.<eos> Could have used some of these three days ago.<eos> From what I saw on the way in, it's a good thing the CO locked you guys up.
Fine, do it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You don't care?<eos> You think you know better than me?<eos> Even though God bought me this watch.<eos> So... if you're so sure of yourself, I guess you wouldn't object if I sent Sister Cyndee out into the wasteland.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll send Cyndee out into the apocalypse.<eos> And if you're right, we'll have a big laugh at my expense, and by way of apology I will take you all to the water park of your choice.
But if I can bust these guys, they'll have to let me back on the force.<eos> That's where Durnsville's only Italian family lives.<eos> I'm gonna wait for them to do some organized crime, then I'm gonna shoot all of them.<eos> Well, I've got an easier way for you to be a hero.<eos> Good, 'cause as you know,<eos> I lost my gun in New York.<eos> This one only shoots gum tape.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll keep a lookout up here.<eos> And you guys make it quick.
- A tape.<eos> - ___<eos> That's weird. A safe is where you put important stuff.<eos> Where are all his geodes and gymnastics ribbons?<eos> There must be something important on here.<eos> This is our proof.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> This is it.<eos> I confess that my funky beats will make you move your feets.
Whoa!<eos> It's the Townville Band.<eos> Still no bars. But I got a push notification on my Redbox app.<eos> The Wedding Ringer's available to rent!<eos> Gretchen, in the tube.<eos> We need you, buddy.<eos> Hey, have you been working out? Your wrists look amazing in that dress.<eos> Well, I got a home crank, so...<eos> Hey, no!<eos> Nope, I am not gonna help you. [sighs]
All right.<eos> I'll decide later.<eos> The day is young, huh?<eos> From your brother.<eos> Ladies, thanks for coming by this morning.<eos> We all know what happened to poor Gary last night.<eos> You hate to see a young person fuck himself up with drugs.<eos> But, hey, when God closes a door, he opens a window.<eos> You know, tragedy or not, you girls still have to put food on the table, am I right?<eos> Make a long story short, here's what I'm gonna do for you.

You never told me how Bridget died.<eos> She was high on drugs.<eos> She jumped off a roof.<eos> So I had a contract drawn up to buy you and your company lock, stock, and barrel.<eos> I'm not for sale.<eos> So we're still negotiating.<eos> Special Agent Barnes.<eos> Who killed Sully Sullivan?<eos> Mickey Donovan.<eos> Any pimp messes with you on the street, - I'm there in a shot.
- No.<eos> - No.<eos> Wait.<eos> Give Mick a chance.<eos> - We did yesterday.<eos> - Why? I get why you ladies might be hesitant.<eos> My ideas yesterday must have struck you as a little bit old-school. - You think?<eos> - Uh, a little bit.<eos> If you don't want to listen, hey, you're free to go.<eos> But if you stay, I'm gonna let you in on a vision I have of a way we can all get rich together.
You can't get my face in.<eos> We're very happy that Tara's dad has come to talk to us about his exciting work in law enforcement.<eos> Agent Barnes was instrumental in hunting down the notorious criminal Patrick "Sully" Sullivan.<eos> He capped that motherfucker!<eos> And Agent Barnes has recently been named the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles Bureau of the FBI.<eos> Agent Barnes.<eos> Thank you, Lorraine.<eos> It's a real pleasure to be able to talk to your students.<eos> When I was eight years old, I stole a Snickers bar from the local pharmacy down the street.<eos> Let me tell you, kids, it's, uh...
Oatmeal raisin.<eos> Excellent choice.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The office told me you were here.<eos> This is an extracurricular activity.<eos> It's not over till the polls close.<eos> I haven't talked to you and you were so upset when you called.<eos> Mom, I just... I had a freakout.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> I shouldn't have left you.
I'm Mickey Donovan.<eos> I'm gonna be your new father.<eos> You're a beauty.<eos> Here.<eos> Bunchy won the fucking lottery, huh?<eos> I like to call him Brendan.<eos> You can call him fucking Vladimir, for all I care, as long as you treat him right.<eos> But he's never loved.<eos> He's pure, so you be gentle with my boy.<eos> I see you two have met.
I'm gonna give you a name.<eos> The guy's a fucking idiot, but eventually he's gonna figure out that Varick took the money and fled to Belize.<eos> Let him leak the story.<eos> The papers will run something about the divorce.<eos> They'll come to you for a comment.<eos> Don't give 'em one.<eos> You got it?<eos> I got it.<eos> Paige, dear, thank you for coming over.<eos> Varick stole $8 million from the fund - I set up for you and him.
So how'd you get my father to change his mind?<eos> I'm helping him deal with Varick.<eos> Varick stealing my trust fund doesn't mean a thing to my father.<eos> Maybe you do.<eos> "The passport is the fix"?<eos> You made a side deal. I know you. You got what you wanted, didn't you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Congratulations, partner.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Let me remind you of the House of Mouse rules... no smoking, no villainous schemes, and no guests eating other guests.
Me and Minassian, we're not on the best of terms.<eos> Then after Detective Muncie releases you,<eos> I promise you the full extent of the government's protections.<eos> Protection?<eos> What are we talking about here?<eos> I was just trying to be of help.<eos> You're not here out of the kindness of your heart, Mr. Donovan.<eos> You're here 'cause we've got enough to put you in Lompoc for ten years.<eos> Take out your phone.<eos> Excuse me, everyone, um, it's such a pleasure to have so many new faces here tonight in our home, and we're so happy for both of you, and we know that this is a start of a beautiful family
So, uh...<eos> Anyway, we never did get a hold of Mom, so we just sat with you there all day.<eos> And one of the nurses from the hospital there, she called me your "little protector" because when you cried out when you were getting the stitches, I yelled at the doctor,<eos> "You're killing him, you bastard."<eos> Maybe I got carried away.<eos> Sometimes I do.<eos> Bunch, you're always gonna be my kid brother, but that doesn't mean I'm always gonna be right.<eos> I realize now how much Teresa cares about you, how strong she is.<eos> She's a fighter, Bunch, and I think everybody here can vouch for that.<eos> It just feels right looking at the two of you together because I know you're gonna protect each other.
I'm not fucking gay!<eos> He came at me.<eos> I just... You just hit him with this poker.<eos> I want you to clean this up.<eos> Too fucking risky.<eos> I saved your brother's life.<eos> Repay the kindness.<eos> Lena rented a car in Varick's name.<eos> I want you to drive it down to Rosarito, use his passport at the border, then fly to Mexico City tomorrow.<eos> Varick stole $8 million from the fund I set up for you and him. - How?
A bottle went missing in my desk.<eos> I thought I misplaced it.<eos> For your sake and Bridget's, I'm gonna choose to believe you.<eos> But if I find out you're fucking lying, I am gonna come back here, and I am gonna fucking kill you myself.<eos> You understand me?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why couldn't you just play fucking Bingo like a normal old man?<eos> I was a shit father. I know that.<eos> I know how bad I let you down, and when I see you with your kids...
You already have your country.<eos> You can't understand.<eos> You are guilty of crimes against the people of South Africa.<eos> Says who?<eos> The ANC?<eos> ! The bloody Kaffir Communists!<eos> You're a criminal.<eos> You are the enemy of South Africa, to what's been built with Afrikaner sweat and blood!<eos> Your sentence is death!<eos> You blacks-- you are beholden to your Kaffir-Boetie Communist masters!

(TYPING)<eos> Wanted:<eos> Wrestlers.<eos> Yeah, I know, right?<eos> That is, like, so cool.<eos> Wait, you're Ferraro Wrestling? Yeah.<eos> You guys just re-opened, right?<eos> You guys should come Thursday.<eos> - I'm kind of busy.<eos> I can get you guys free hot dogs.
I missed you guys.<eos> Looks like Mick has the car ready.<eos> What?<eos> You're going with him? - Yeah.<eos> - But Dad, you just got back.<eos> You missed my birthday.<eos> And the Easter bunny.<eos> Honey, this has gotten out of hand.<eos> All we ever wanted was to spend more time together as a family, and now, we barely see you or Russell.<eos> I... I know, but I'm doing this for you guys.
- Russell.<eos> Russell.<eos> Yep, I'm already hearing things.<eos> Russell, where are you?<eos> Russell.<eos> For the love of bananas, it's me. Hunk?<eos> Keep it down.<eos> I'm busting you out of this joint.<eos> Russell, we're here to take you home.<eos> But I let you all down.
- You think you're strong enough?<eos> - And here comes The Hammer.<eos> - It is Hammer time!<eos> Hammer time!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're all welcome.<eos> The man who once said, and I quote,<eos> "String cheese really isn't string.<eos> It is just cheese."<eos> It's an honor for you to be my presence.
You don't have a future.<eos> I told you when I left it was only a matter of time before the other barons moved on you.<eos> Oh, you think they're gonna jeopardize the oil supply?<eos> They recognized me, Teague.<eos> All except Quinn.<eos> He's the most powerful baron with the biggest clipper force.<eos> The others might hate him, but they ain't gonna go against him.<eos> That's why we need to take him down. Once he's gone, the other barons will follow.<eos> Come back and let's start over.<eos> Who hired you?
We need to send a message.<eos> What do you think, Sunny?<eos> I think Ryder and I should scout it out.<eos> Good work, son.<eos> There's no opium here, Sunny.<eos> Just us.<eos> The widow sends her regards.<eos> Come on, let's get 'em!<eos> She wants him to die slow.<eos> If you kill him, the baron will hunt you down.
But out of respect for what he did for me, I'm sure we can come to terms.<eos> A month ago, a shipment of cogs was heading this way to me.<eos> 28 in all.<eos> When my men opened the hatch, they found a scene of slaughter.<eos> All but one of the cogs was dead.<eos> Killed in a murderous rage.<eos> Before the last soul passed... she was able to identify the perpetrator.<eos> This boy has cost me money and respect.<eos> I want you to find him, clip him, and bring his head to me as payment.<eos> Do this... and I'll guarantee you and your companions safe passage out of the Badlands to a place where no one will ever find you.
What did I do?<eos> You let her go.<eos> It looked like you were controlling your power.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> - So you got lucky?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Does this mean we get to leave soon?<eos> Quinn wants us to find the Widow.<eos> We leave in an hour.<eos> Quinn and the other barons, they want you to believe they're benevolent because they protect you from the horrors of the world.
Never mind.<eos> Y-you're coming back to work, right? Here?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Why are you whispering?<eos> Lisbon, hey.<eos> Someone's trying to reach you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Hi. I'll talk to you guys later, okay?<eos> It is so good to see you guys.
Well, no matter what happens, from this point on, we have to promise each other that we will always look on the bright side.<eos> I promise.<eos> Me too.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> And see how much better things turn out when you're honest with me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Patrick, do you take Teresa to be your lawful, wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?
Me too.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> And see how much better things turn out when you're honest with me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Patrick, do you take Teresa to be your lawful, wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?<eos> I sure do.<eos> And, you, Teresa, do you take Patrick to be your lawful, wedded husband, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?
No.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Chick couldn't make it tonight.<eos> Convenient.<eos> We don't know anything about that.<eos> We're just here to do a delivery.<eos> Look, is this really necessary?<eos> 'Course you don't know anything about that.<eos> I'm gonna give you some education.
Face the truck.<eos> On your knees.<eos> Let's move it!<eos> See, it's all good. We just...<eos> We got no issues, man.<eos> We're just here to drop off and pick up.<eos> Okay, we're cool here.<eos> Just need to unload the guns and just give us the money.<eos> We're good.<eos> We're not sending you back with the money. Meaning what?
- and the Kingdom of God?<eos> - No more!<eos> We are your judges, and not you ours.<eos> I cannot be judged by false Christians, for I have done nothing save preach Christ through gospel.<eos> Must you continue to dishonor the laws of the commonwealth and the church with your prideful conceit?<eos> If my conscience sees it fit.<eos> Then shall you be banished from this plantation's liberties!<eos> I would be glad on it.<eos> Then take your leave and trouble us no further.<eos> How sadly hath the Lord testified against you.
- I am no witch, father.<eos> - What did I but see in my house?<eos> - Will you not hear me? - Prithee, confess.<eos> Why have you turned against me?<eos> Christ can un-witch us if you will but speak truth to me.<eos> As I love thee, speak truth.<eos> - You ask me to speak truth?<eos> - I beg thee.<eos> You and Mother planned to rid the farm of me.<eos> Aye, I heard you speak of it.
Watch our backs, there could be more of them.<eos> Alec, get me out of here. Now!<eos> Alec, Alec, I'm burned.<eos> I need a way out, now!<eos> Ok, hang on, hang on, just give me a second!<eos> Now you're out.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I can ask you the same thing.
What happened?<eos> We've gotta get out of here now, just trust me. Up.<eos> Fine.<eos> This way!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Keep them pinned down, I'll get reinforcements!<eos> They fried our suits!<eos> Alec, they've disabled our tech.<eos> We need another way out, now!<eos> You're at a dead end. The only way out is through them.
We both tried to opt out once before, remember?<eos> It didn't work out so well, did it?<eos> I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I'm terrified of making everything worse.<eos> I have faith in you, Alec.<eos> Yeah. Is that why you invited me here?<eos> A pep talk?<eos> No. I got a message saying you wanted to meet me here.<eos> You have a bad habit of appearing out of shadows.<eos> Maybe I'm leading you into the light.
I'm sure that's a relief to you, Kiera.<eos> Alec assures me that there's very little chance I'll be able to travel forward in time, so...<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> But if anybody could do it... We have a way to enter their stronghold with no casualties and no gunfire.<eos> We don't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> Care to share how?<eos> After you let us use your lab at Piron.<eos> I need to make some adjustments to the time ball.<eos> We need it in order to jam their defenses.<eos> Yeah, once I let you in, what assurance do I have you're gonna deliver on your promise?
I'll do it right now.<eos> - So, it looks like the girls made it to L.A.<eos> - Safe and sound.<eos> Which means you and I have a golden opportunity.<eos> - For what exactly?<eos> - A double date.<eos> No snooping kids ... you, Kiki, me, and Ron.<eos> - Well, that's a great idea.<eos> - Mm. - I can't wait to meet Ron.<eos> - And he can't wait to meet you guys.
Because he wasn't dead.<eos> It was a stunt. He faked his own death, started over.<eos> - Well, that how it looks.<eos> - Do we know his connection with Walsh?<eos> So far, there isn't one.<eos> They didn't seem to know each other.<eos> So, how did Roger become Dan?<eos> And what made him fake his suicide in the first place?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Well, I flew you to L.A. to find out.
- Mwah. - Mm. - You're welcome.<eos> - Mm. So, come in and have a drink!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - I've heard a lot about you.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> - You two know each other?<eos> - What?<eos> Nope.<eos> The fact that you don't know each other is my fault.
Cagney and Lacey were both police officers.<eos> Dr. Isles is a... medical examiner.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's been very nice working with you, detective. You too.<eos> Do you ladies think that you'll be back again soon?<eos> When Malibu freezes over. Malibu received .3<eos> inches of snow in 2007.<eos> It's not happening.<eos> Okay, so, there's no point in dancing around the subject.<eos> Vince and I asked you to come here because we wanted to clear the air.
He grew up a spiritual man, A pillar of the community, beloved by all.<eos> Times were hard back then, But the town was close-knit.<eos> Everyone pulled together, no matter their background.<eos> Why, thank you, mrs.<eos> Parsons. I don't know the next time We'll have fresh bread,<eos> Especially if this drought lingers.<eos> As providence decrees.<eos> Peace be upon you.<eos> And upon you.<eos> Will I be seeing you at the prayer group tonight, Reverend?
Thank you. Katrina:<eos> He thought his feelings were being reciprocated,<eos> But he was wrong. Sarah.<eos> Reverend.<eos> My grandmother knew this could end in heartbreak<eos> But she did not know it would end in tragedy.<eos> Reverend.<eos> You sent for me.<eos> A worker is only as good as their tools.<eos> For you.
We are beset by his servants.<eos> There are witches among us!<eos> Katrina: My grandmother tried to appeal To the man she thought she know.<eos> Helena, it was an accident.<eos> Your lie has spread like the plague.<eos> You must end this madness.<eos> They will have my head.<eos> Throw yourself at their mercy.<eos> Trust in their kindness.<eos> Do not force me to make this decision for you.
I will face kent.<eos> You asked me before about my commitment to the cause<eos> Crane, you don't need to prove anything to me.<eos> No, I do not.<eos> I will prove it to kent.<eos> Let the embers of today Ignite into de fires of yesterdy.<eos> Sarah.<eos> You do not belong here.<eos> Tricks!<eos> Tricks will not protect you.
Going after the person who mur... mur... uh... Who took my parents away is her messed-up way of showing me how close we are, or ... or could be.<eos> I keep calling her "she," but she's me.<eos> I'm the one doing this.<eos> Charlie, that ... that's not who you are, okay?<eos> It's ... it's a twisted version of ... Me.<eos> I've been following her so I can catch her before she does something stupid a-and just lock her away forever.<eos> Uh, Charlie...<eos> That's not an answer.<eos> Sam's right.<eos> We'll go back to Oz, and we'll ... we'll get the key from the wizard of douche, and we'll put you back together.
Previously on Reign...<eos> - How did we die, Mother?<eos> - She suffocated you.
Besides you, the only other person who saw the brand was a woman named Josephine.<eos> Whom you slept with?<eos> After you'd been branded?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, why are you taking your spurs?<eos> My horse is...<eos> No, forget your horse.<eos> You'll be arrested before you've gone half a mile.<eos> You'll travel in my carriage...<eos> I will take you to Chambord.
Yes.<eos> Uh, why are you taking your spurs?<eos> My horse is...<eos> No, forget your horse.<eos> You'll be arrested before you've gone half a mile.<eos> You'll travel in my carriage...<eos> I will take you to Chambord.<eos> Your home in Condé is the first place they'll look for you.<eos> And if someone finds out we're traveling together, Chambord will be the next place they look.<eos> If only we could get you to your brother, the king of Navarre.
Your home in Condé is the first place they'll look for you.<eos> And if someone finds out we're traveling together, Chambord will be the next place they look.<eos> If only we could get you to your brother, the king of Navarre.<eos> But the roads along the border will be crawling<eos> - with Swiss guards.<eos> - My brother's not in Navarre.<eos> There's an estate one day's ride south from here.<eos> It belongs to a friend of Antoine's.<eos> He winters there often.<eos> If we can get you there, you can travel to Navarre under his protection.

You're beautiful, Lady Atley.<eos> But... another holds my heart.<eos> I can't get her out of my mind.<eos> You love her, but you can't have her, can you?<eos> Well, that's when a man becomes truly obsessed.<eos> What a pity.<eos> A man like you should not go unclaimed.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Now I'm her.<eos> I've watched you for so long.
What?<eos> How dare you suggest...<eos> Think about it.<eos> Catherine's soup... when did you first eat it?<eos> When did you first start feeling ill?<eos> And how have you felt since I took it away from you?<eos> You feel better, don't you?<eos> Or, at least good enough to act the horrid bitch and only after you've eaten the safe food that I've brought you.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Has Catherine ever been this solicitous of you before?

Well, if you knew anything, you'd know that Bash and I were lovers.<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> I was told my cleric Randall was arrested.<eos> A servant informed on him.<eos> He was seen placing a bandage over the mark of his guilt.<eos> He's one of them.<eos> A radical.<eos> I was branded against my will!<eos> I was attacked!<eos> Who attacked you?
After tonight, I'm sure you don't wish to linger.<eos> Thank you for helping me.<eos> I was glad to do it.<eos> Will you really go back to French court<eos> - when you leave Chambord?<eos> - Where else would I go?<eos> Have you considered Scotland?<eos> You might be safer there than France.<eos> There is unrest in both countries.<eos> But here you have a husband whose decisions endanger you.
I read your letter.<eos> - Oh, you never said...<eos> - Because I know that you tried to get that letter back.<eos> One of the servants you sent to retrieve it told me so.<eos> You wished that letter had never been sent, and I respected your wishes.<eos> I wrote that letter thinking I'd never see you again.<eos> That was not an attempt at seduction.<eos> I know.<eos> None of us are responsible for our hearts, only our actions.<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything.
Give me your sword.<eos> The brand is what brought them here.<eos> We'll have to get rid of it.<eos> Burn if off?<eos> They won't be fooled.<eos> They'll know what we did<eos> - or at least suspect it.<eos> - They will.<eos> But all we need is enough doubt to prevent a hanging.<eos> With that, and with my support, we may convince them to arrest you and take you back to court, where Francis can help.
Francis will help when help is needed.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> No, but I saw cauterizations done during my recovery, after the war.<eos> His quarters are this way.<eos> Do it now.<eos> In the name of the Holy Cross, open up!<eos> Hold on to me.<eos> Aah! - I have you.
Leave us.<eos> Your brother is behind it... without your knowledge hopefully.<eos> Because a king that makes an enemy of the Vatican will be crushed.<eos> My brother is behind it.<eos> With my knowledge.<eos> And you will not crush me.<eos> The Vatican's brutality is tearing my country apart.<eos> It must end.<eos> I'd hoped the son of Henry would be wiser.<eos> Look around you!
You fool, do you really believe<eos> Prince Condé is your friend?<eos> All you had to do was stand back and let me collect him.<eos> That's what all this branding really was, wasn't it?<eos> Your collection of enemies to be marked and removed.<eos> And Condé was the biggest fish in your net.<eos> It ends.<eos> You will take your men and your myth of the Dark Riders and you will leave France.<eos> Or your lover will die.<eos> You will release my cleric and beg for my forgiveness, or the Vatican will destroy you!
No?<eos> I understand love, Cardinal.<eos> To see it, you need only the smallest of clues.<eos> Before I chose Randall as our target, I had to be sure that you couldn't bear to sacrifice him.<eos> So I had the servants in your quarters questioned.<eos> Not about sex but about how you two live.<eos> And found no letters, heard no declarations...<eos> It's cold here... in Northern France, isn't it?<eos> A bitter winter.<eos> You brought a silver warming tray with you for your bed... monogrammed, the servants tell me.

Live to the max.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> Am I still alive?<eos> Sometimes I can't tell.<eos> I'm seeing a slightly elevated BP. But no cause for concern.<eos> I'm up five points systolic, two points diastolic.<eos> I miss it, don't you?<eos> An occasional rush of adrenaline?<eos> The kind we could get before we were half-dead.<eos> I need you two focused on a cure.
Hu Bayi, son of a bitch, has betrayed us!<eos> It doesn't matter if we have money.<eos> So let's do it.<eos> Let me suggest something for the sake of your sincerity<eos> What?<eos> Thirty thousand?<eos> No way!<eos> You misunderstood.<eos> She means she'll triple your offer.<eos> Far enough for people like you.
Every thing's electronic.<eos> What's the fun of it?<eos> Hurry up guys!<eos> Okay<eos> What are you doing, Grill?<eos> Follow me<eos> You get down there first<eos> Ladies, do think twice.<eos> Raiding a tomb is no joke<eos> Look at you, are you ready for this?
Jump.<eos> Jump. Ding-<eos> No!<eos> Ding!<eos> Ding!<eos> Ding died for us.<eos> She really did.<eos> We are finally here.<eos> How can I just take it easy and leave?<eos> Ding sacrificed herself for you two to be alive.
I knew that you weren't an irresponsible man.<eos> Real men live for loyalty and honesty.<eos> Don't you guys worry about Miss Yang.<eos> I'll take care of her.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be back soon. Ciao.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hu Bayi, you liar.<eos> You two can go to hell.<eos> I never wanna see you guys anymore!
Mr. Hu.<eos> Where's Shirley?<eos> I'm useless...<eos> You guys ran pretty fast huh.<eos> Where's Shirley?<eos> Mr. Wang is here.<eos> Flu!<eos> Here you g0!<eos> Go!<eos> Damn you!
Where's Shirley?<eos> I'm useless...<eos> You guys ran pretty fast huh.<eos> Where's Shirley?<eos> Mr. Wang is here.<eos> Flu!<eos> Here you g0!<eos> Go!<eos> Damn you!<eos> Damn you!
Mm-hmm.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> Tell me I'm doing the right thing. You are, you're doing the right thing.<eos> I make her a target, right?<eos> I'm dangerous. Yes, you are.<eos> You're a good mum.<eos> Good mum.<eos> Time?<eos> Please, take care.<eos> My people will get you out of the country.
It was the only way I could see<eos> - to get you out of Dyad. - Betray my sister?<eos> For Kira.<eos> That's not your bloody decision!<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> This is Seth.<eos> They wrote down all my information in this little notebook, and then Seth yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag.<eos> - Mommy!<eos> - Duncan had tissue samples of the Castor original.<eos> My people will get you out of the country.
No. - It is.<eos> Is Mummy mad at me?<eos> - No. - Oh, no, love.<eos> No. She'll be so sorry she didn't get to talk to you.<eos> She misses you enormously.<eos> And when she finds out how much fun you're having, she is gonna be so happy.<eos> Time to sign off now, love, okay?<eos> Thanks to your dad for the call.<eos> - Remember, we love you.<eos> - I love you, too. Bye.
Did you see that? Yeah!<eos> Oh, geez Louise!<eos> - I was about to brain you, man.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm sorry, whose car is this?<eos> It's ours, baby.<eos> You bought this?<eos> 10K down, in cash.<eos> You should have seen the guy's face.<eos> I don't think you guys are ready for the next level.
Hi, I am looking for Cosima.<eos> Delphine.<eos> Hello, Shay.<eos> Cosima, could you come out here for a minute?<eos> You know, whatever this is,<eos> It's not cool.<eos> You know what? I don't really care.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I'll leave you two alone. - Yeah.
This?<eos> These are my babies.<eos> I kept them at Uncle Felix's to keep them safe.<eos> Why doesn't anyone listen to me? - What?<eos> - We are selling soap with Helena. She's going to help us make it.<eos> That is it.<eos> That doesn't answer my question, Alison.<eos> Why nobody listens to you?<eos> No... no. Why doesn't the psycho go live with one of her other sisters?<eos> Because it's your turn, and if you don't do it, then I'm going to tell everyone that you're awash in pills and you're in bed with the Portuguese mob.
We couldn't give you the book because if Topside had gotten ahold of it...<eos> Topside?<eos> Scott lost the book because someone close to you tipped Castor off.<eos> It would have been safer with me. Where's the copy?<eos> Secure, and absolutely useless.<eos> You just cost us the one person who could translate it. Your resignation is accepted.<eos> And so is yours.<eos> - But I did...<eos> - You might need this when you're out in the cold.<eos> Security will see you out.
Sorry to raise any false hopes.<eos> - London.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, the bit Rachel translated, it points to London.<eos> To the CASTOR original.<eos> We need to get to him first.<eos> Are we going home?<eos> Not exactly Knightsbridge, is it?<eos> I thought we were meant to be in the old neighborhood.<eos> My old neighborhood, chicken. Before I took you lot in.
I thought we were meant to be in the old neighborhood.<eos> My old neighborhood, chicken. Before I took you lot in.<eos> Get walking. Left foot. Right foot.<eos> Works the same this side of the pond.<eos> - Terry?<eos> - At the back, love.<eos> Are we meeting someone already?<eos> No time to waste.<eos> We have to track down CASTOR, so I called an old friend.<eos> Twenty years ago, he helped to find you.
When I hit, you block.<eos> Then you look me in the eyes, and you punch!<eos> I am choking, so you come where I am vulnerable.<eos> Squeeze.<eos> Helena?<eos> We don't do things like that anymore. Remember?<eos> I don't think I'm allowed.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I am a mother now, I walk a different path.<eos> So we slipped you out of the orphanage.
Hello?<eos> Doctor?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anyone here?<eos> This place has been tied up in court for months.<eos> Your friend seems to be making himself at home.<eos> Ahoy there, Scotty.<eos> Nice work, men.<eos> - Hey. - You'll be safe.<eos> No one will find you here. Okay?
I'll rather have pizza with tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, and pine nuts.<eos> Sorry, are those European pine nuts?<eos> How am I supposed to know?<eos> The European ones are longish. The roundish ones are mostly Chinese.<eos> You get a metal-like aftertaste from them.<eos> So if they are Chinese, I'd prefer pizza with... eggplant, zucchini and peppers.<eos> It's important the various vegetables do not touch each other. Excuse me!<eos> What if they do?<eos> I'll take another look at the menu.<eos> That's it for the two of you!
I'm thinking, if you were able to bury one of my memories, then you can retrieve some of hers.<eos> No.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Mom, they- they said they won't hurt me... - Max.<eos> ...if you do what they say, so please, mom, plea--<eos> Max.<eos> Don't hurt him.<eos> Don't you hurt him.<eos> Guys, there are people looking for me.<eos> If they find me, they'll find you.
Tremendous pleasure and honor to welcome the incredible, unique, and fantastic, one and only Nina Simone.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi!<eos> We're ready.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> I haven't seen you for many years, since 1968.<eos> I have decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.<eos> That decision has not changed.<eos> I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,
But to be completely honest, the whole thing seems so much like a dream.<eos> I never thought I was gonna stay in show business.<eos> When I first got into show business, I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.<eos> I was a classical pianist.<eos> I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.<eos> That's what I was prepared to be.<eos> I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.<eos> I started to play the piano when I was three or four.<eos> My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.<eos> ♪ Children go where I send you ♪

You didn't forget me, huh?<eos> That's- - That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.<eos> I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.<eos> You don't know what I mean.<eos> And there are many people in show business who said,<eos> "Oh, she- - You know, she used to be a star.<eos> She's gone all the way to the bottom,"<eos> and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.<eos> I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.<eos> And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.
And I suppose that medication enabled her to perform and fulfill the business dealings that were taking place so that her career could get back on track, but there were times when I questioned that, you know, "But what about her heart?"<eos> Because at the end of the day, you guys got wives and husbands and lives, but she's alone.<eos> My personal life is a shambles.<eos> I've had a few love affairs and I would love to be married, but everything has had to be sacrificed for the music.<eos> We had to do, first in Holland, eight concerts, and the word spread that Nina's doing the job well.<eos> Then she was on the road again and it was... poof.<eos> The business was going.<eos> She came onstage and you had this overwhelming, emotional feeling coming from the audience just because she was there.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> I love you very much.
Take this, all of you, and drink from it. For this is the chalice of my blood.
Really?<eos> Whose is it?<eos> Is it Spencer's?<eos> Is it Hanna's?<eos> Mona's.<eos> Didn't you hear me calling you in front of the school?<eos> Hanna, that woman is not a coach.<eos> She's a gorgon.<eos> I don't care how many beauty pageants she's won, she's an ugly person.<eos> Hey, girls. I didn't hear you come in.
Sorry for grabbing it from you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> If we start stepping on each other, none of us are gonna make it out alive.<eos> Should we go see Mona's mom?<eos> Not all at once.<eos> That's just gonna scare her.<eos> I'll go do it.<eos> Well, I'm the least intimidating.<eos> I'll drive you.<eos> I'll call you guys later.
And when they turn those lights out, it is the loneliest feeling you could ever imagine.<eos> Second thought, I could have used a thick coat of sugar.<eos> You can't be ready for how it feels, Em.<eos> It's hard not to give up on hope.<eos> You guys, they can take everything from us, but they can't take us from each other.<eos> I don't care how far apart from you guys I am, I will still be with you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Same here.<eos> I love you, guys.<eos> Love you.
Do you know where we are?<eos> We're in my living room, Spencer.<eos> This is my house.<eos> Why are you acting like such an imbecile?<eos> Han, it's not like you're gonna gain it all back by eating one cookie.<eos> You know you want one.<eos> We really thought you were dead.<eos> Thank God for Mrs. Grunwald.<eos> I don't know how I'll ever repay her for saving my life that night.<eos> I'm so happy to see you guys.
You're not here alone anymore.<eos> There are five of us, and one of him, her, it, bitch.<eos> Hanna's right.<eos> Let's find a way to get the hell out of here.<eos> Mona, let's go.<eos> My name is Alison.<eos> Alison DiLaurentis.<eos> Mona, let's go!<eos> What is that?<eos> It's trying to warn you.
I have been here all day, and it's been a great day!<eos> You've been here for three weeks!<eos> Three weeks?<eos> It must be nearly bedtime.<eos> Well, we've partied.<eos> Yes!<eos> I helped you dig a well, with a first-class, child-friendly visitor's centre!<eos> I've given you some top-notch maths tuition in a fun but relevant way.<eos> And I have also introduced the word "dude" several centuries early.<eos> Let me hear you!
Are you a Renaissance...?<eos> Dude!<eos> Are you a Medieval...?<eos> Dude!<eos> I am a dragon-slaying...?<eos> Dude!<eos> We are all the young...?<eos> Dudes!<eos> I like it.<eos> But I've got some sad news for you, dudes.
Dude!<eos> Are you a Medieval...?<eos> Dude!<eos> I am a dragon-slaying...?<eos> Dude!<eos> We are all the young...?<eos> Dudes!<eos> I like it.<eos> But I've got some sad news for you, dudes.<eos> Tonight, I'm going to have to leave you.
Do you feel their need, Doctor?<eos> Their blood is screaming.<eos> "Kill!<eos> Kill!<eos> Kill!"<eos> Hunter and prey, held in the ecstasy of crisis.<eos> Is this not life at its purest?<eos> Exterminate!<eos> Exterminate!<eos> Why have I ever let you live?
I need a guy who shows up.<eos> 'Cause anything else just isn't real.<eos> Jess, you should, uh, know something, too.<eos> I touched both your mother's breasts in a communal womb earlier today.<eos> I didn't do it on purpose, but there it is.<eos> Thanks for telling me.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> It's a relief to get it off my shoulders.<eos> Thanks for being cool about it.<eos> I'll leave you alone.
- I'd sit over there and smoke cloves while she did that.<eos> I broke up with Ryan.<eos> - Wow. - Oh, babe, I'm sorry.<eos> How'd he take it?<eos> Actually, pretty good.<eos> - So you got his voice mail.<eos> - Yeah. Sounds about right.<eos> Last stop on the tour.<eos> Um... it's Crush Pond.<eos> So... say a name in your head and throw the rock in the pond, and they'll love you forever.
Hey.<eos> -You okay? -Fine.<eos> It worked?<eos> Yeah.<eos> -My turn.<eos> -Dean, look, we wanna help.<eos> No.<eos> No, with you in the ring... you'd just be a liability.<eos> -Dean -I'd be worried about what he could do to you. Or what I could.<eos> Plus I need you three out here to take out whatever comes out of there.
I have rights, too, you know.<eos> It's not just the criminals that have rights.<eos> And I don't think I want to talk to you anymore.<eos> Oh, perfect timing.<eos> Hodgins found zinc particulates that I matched to this section of fence and some tobacco beetle bits that I traced back to a flour warehouse.<eos> Despite the name, the beetles like wheat more than tobacco. Wow.<eos> You sound like your husband.<eos> Are you and Arastoo still fighting?<eos> I don't want to talk about it. Okay.<eos> Well, since you two were spotted looking really intense earlier, everyone else is already talking about it.
Oh, fuck!<eos> Just make sure to erase this thing after.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> I'm just gonna show it to my friend, Tiff.<eos> Ohh. She gets off on this shit.<eos> This piece of shit whore is the daughter you raised, hmm?<eos> Are you proud, Momma, of the cum jug you gave birth to?<eos> You put your family on a plane and you fly as far away from here as you can.<eos> You understand?<eos> If I ever see your faces again, I will cut you into pieces and feed you to my dogs.
Gave her the apple.<eos> She's mother.<eos> I am having the babies.<eos> I am food for them.<eos> Eve is food for Adam.<eos> Sausage.<eos> Ah, the miracle of birth.<eos> Is there anything more beautiful?<eos> Persistent little buggers, aren't you?<eos> Good for you!

- But Sentaro is glum.<eos> - On such a beautiful day.<eos> - Hold it!<eos> This is a cherry blossom.<eos> There's a blossom in my dorayaki.<eos> What have you done, Sentaro?<eos> A foreign substance.<eos> It's contaminated.<eos> Awful!<eos> I'll give you these, if you leave.
Of course it is, just "factorising" time.<eos> - School's so boring.<eos> - It's boring, these days.<eos> Find a way to make it matter.<eos> - How'd we do that?<eos> - That's hard.<eos> Turn it into a game. - No way.<eos> - Miyu's parents...<eos> They'd kick me out.<eos> Then you could run away.
When?<eos> This morning.<eos> His name is Marvy.<eos> We live in an apartment, and pets are prohibited.<eos> A neighbour complained to the landlord, and he said to get rid of him.<eos> I once talked with Tokue about this, here at the shop.<eos> Here?<eos> When I first spoke with Tokue.<eos> And?<eos> She said that if I can't keep Marvy, either you or she would take him.
I looked all over for you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Shall we go?<eos> Yoshiko...<eos> Hello.<eos> Ah...<eos> Tokue has died.<eos> Three days ago.<eos> She died of pneumonia.<eos> I see that Tokue's feelings reached you.
Excuse us, Tokue.<eos> Come in.<eos> She would be so pleased to know you have these.<eos> TOKUE<eos> And this, too.<eos> Tokue... She gave me this before they took her to the hospital.<eos> She said it was for the boss and Wakana.<eos> Is it recording?<eos> It seems to be.<eos> I'm not sure that this will get to you, but I hope so.
Like they've... asked it a hundred times that day already, you asked it as if... nothing else mattered to you.<eos> And I thought, how is it that this person, who I've never seen before... How are they the only person in the whole world who knows? That I'm not OK.<eos> And I was sure if I could just find out your name, if I could just find out who you were... then everything would be OK.<eos> What if everything... isn't OK?<eos> Then we tell each other. And we deal with it.<eos> Whatever it is, we... deal with it.<eos> Together.<eos> Is there something you want to tell me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm excited you two are going to meet.
And they often are.<eos> Poor Danny has a terrible track record for picking the wrong man.<eos> He's an insufferable romantic.<eos> One of the last.<eos> Does it fall to me to say... don't break his heart?<eos> I could never hurt Danny.<eos> May I ask, as someone who's been witness to the breaking of many a heart... how you can be so sure?<eos> Because he is the only friend I have.<eos> I'm pleased for you.<eos> I'm pleased for both of you.
– You need to stay here.<eos> – Give it to me! – No!<eos> Mom, let him go.<eos> Come with me.<eos> – Is there another road?<eos> – It's the only road.<eos> – What the hell is happening?<eos> – I told you. There was a flood.<eos> – Rescue should be coming.<eos> – No one's looking for you.
You and your father were not close.<eos> My father was very ill.<eos> I guess he wanted to die in his own terms.<eos> Haven't seen you for seven years, since your daughter disappeared.
Sadly, the original Jolene that your mother made me return was cruelly adopted by a children's hospital.<eos> You see, something hit me this morning when that truck didn't hit me this morning...<eos> I have not been in control of my own life.<eos> But those days are done. - Oh.<eos> Huh. Well, I guess I'm not in control of everything, am I? Funny, isn't it?<eos> You can try and try, but in the blink of an eye... You can lose everything that matters to you.<eos> Dad, are you okay?<eos> Don't you all see what's going on here?<eos> Dad really wanted that milk.<eos> I almost lost you guys today... All of you. - Aw.
- Get away from her.<eos> - Stop.<eos> You understand now.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> - His loss?<eos> What about our loss?<eos> What about those dead women?<eos> It was never our intent to harm you.
We all are at this point.<eos> Okay, look, JD has supplies and food.<eos> He's ex-military, so he can help with defense.<eos> I can at least help you secure the perimeter.<eos> Mm-mm, no.<eos> We're not taking orders from one of them.<eos> I'm sorry, who the hell are you?<eos> This is Ares.<eos> JD. Molly.<eos> Hey, new guy, I laid my ass on the line for you people.
I can't get it to the head.<eos> But I can practice with you.<eos> It's boring anyway.<eos> Yes, that would be nice.<eos> Only if it's okay to you to neglect the other guests.<eos> - Now hand over.<eos> - This is a love story.<eos> With old costumes and such.<eos> A bit cheesy.<eos> "For you I roam through forests and climb on rocks."
Maybe I can write an apology to a doctor?<eos> No, no.<eos> Who is signed must play.<eos> Politicians can resign for corruption, but here at Blue-White we don't bend.<eos> This square deserves a beating.<eos> She may be quite pretty, a bit younger, she can run like a hare, but you have more experience.<eos> You're much, much older.<eos> "And now?<eos> You love, with your love you are alone."<eos> "I know I can't love you, Mylady, " " but I shall be your faithful servant."
That thing you can pull off my salary, Mr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Hengesbach.<eos> And by the way:<eos> My name is Mrs. Reimann.<eos> I also don't call you Miss, because you have these dry style.<eos> Yes, I may be a lousy lawyer.<eos> And yes, I cried, so what?<eos> Usually I eat total little.<eos> Only here, when I'm with you, I have stark sugar shortage.<eos> Here prevails a coldness, you fucking overachiever.<eos> Do you think there out you find someone cool?
He's also the ship's doctor.<eos> Here's the key to the sickbay and the medicine cabinet.<eos> Keep it around your neck and don't take it off.<eos> This is still a ship.<eos> You're at work, not on holiday.<eos> All regulations still apply.<eos> Understood?<eos> Come with me, Ismail.<eos> When you're not working, be in the rec room or your cabin.<eos> Don't make me have to find you. Come on, İsmail.
There's no sign of him, Beybaba.<eos> You're in charge of only 4 people.<eos> Where's Kurd?<eos> He's nowhere to be seen, Beybaba.<eos> Beybaba...<eos> Enough!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Never in my life...<eos> This is a ship!<eos> The better I treat you, the more you take advantage.
The other doesn't know, his ass from a hole in the ground.<eos> Fuck the lot of you!<eos> Straighten yourselves out.<eos> Ismail tells me you're worn out.<eos> He says not to overwork you.<eos> Am I making you work? !<eos> Look at this deck!<eos> When was it last scraped?<eos> The tools have been sitting here since last week.<eos> And I'm overworking you, huh?

I treat you well and this is how you take advantage.<eos> There's no chain of command left on this ship.<eos> What business do you have down in the galley?<eos> Asshole!<eos> Are you a seaman, or a pleasure pimp?<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Where were you while this pimp was rooting through your galley?<eos> What about you, Ismail?<eos> Where's Kurd?<eos> Fuck the lot of you.
Are you a seaman, or a pleasure pimp?<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Where were you while this pimp was rooting through your galley?<eos> What about you, Ismail?<eos> Where's Kurd?<eos> Fuck the lot of you.<eos> I'll show you who's boss.<eos> You're going to work.<eos> All of you are going to work.<eos> I treated you well and you fucked me over.

For his heart condition. What kind of heart condition is addressed By rye and haagen-dazs?<eos> A broken one.<eos> Oh, come on, please.<eos> My mom died three years ago. He's dated half the widows in pittsburgh.<eos> Only my dad would announce a visit 48 hours in advance And then serve us with a list of demands.<eos> Okay, let's just try and make him comfortable.<eos> Oh, he'll get comfortable, And then he'll ask us for something.<eos> Oh, he says he wants to see the kids, And they love him, so...<eos> The guy's just not wired to think about anyone but himself.<eos> Okay, I know that he was not the world's most attentive father. Yeah. But can you just try and get along with him...
Because I'm a whore, you see, that's the point.<eos> I meant other venues, where one might meet you.<eos> There's a party I know about, here in town.<eos> There'll be lots of rich, drunk men mingling about.<eos> Outside, having a smoke where you might say hello.<eos> Oh, you'll need a different frock, though, if you're going to blend in.<eos> - Come with me. - Oh...<eos> Lola.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> I didn't see you at my brother's funeral.
Yes.<eos> I heard you were meeting the Von Amsbergs.<eos> To try to overcome the perception that you are just one of the king's mistresses.<eos> Francis is faithful to Mary.<eos> And as for me, it was when they were apart, and it was one night.<eos> "One night."<eos> Don't flaunt your bountiful womb to me.<eos> They may have been apart, but you were and always have been Mary's lady, since you were a child.<eos> There were dozens of little girls whose families begged me for that position.<eos> But I chose you.
Disposable.<eos> You know what happens to disposable queens?<eos> They are disposed of.<eos> Brutally.<eos> If it happens, remember your role in her demise.<eos> I know I will.<eos> The sisters know that I'm a healer.<eos> They believe I am blessed, and took me in.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> They call you the Woman in White.
But this has happened before.<eos> You save someone at a cost to another.<eos> Not always.<eos> Many times there are no consequences.<eos> Even so, I only cure people I know will die without my help.<eos> So if there is a price, surely it's less than losing someone you love.<eos> But how do you know someone is truly dying?<eos> Can you see the future?<eos> I've known other visionaries.<eos> I'm not asking to taunt you.
Look at yourself... he's all over you.<eos> The gown, those jewels.<eos> You may not have strayed explicitly, but clearly you want more than you have.<eos> I do... I want a good life, and a husband to share it with.<eos> And I'm sick of being judged for it just because you want less.<eos> Less comfort.<eos> Less responsibility.<eos> Less of me.<eos> You.<eos> How have I offended you now?
- Have you been following me?<eos> Well, I've... I've been looking for you.<eos> Well, stay away from me.<eos> I sent back your gowns, your jewels.<eos> I won't be your revenge against this family, against my husband.<eos> That's not what I want.<eos> I want you.<eos> You think that because I was the king's mistress that I'm easy prey?<eos> I don't want you to be revenge.<eos> I don't want you to be my mistress.
They say she won't live another month.<eos> And it should tell you something about the state of our union that she doesn't want me by her side.<eos> When she's gone, I'll take another wife.<eos> I'm married.<eos> It was an act of a mad king, which even your Church would overturn.<eos> Forgive me, but I know the facts.<eos> I also know that your husband occupies a station that no woman of your upbringing could be happy with.<eos> And now you insult me.<eos> You don't know what makes me happy.<eos> I saw you happy yesterday.
It's all right.<eos> They were nice things to hear.<eos> From a friend.<eos> I did specify that, didn't I?<eos> That I was saying them in friendship?<eos> You did, absolutely.<eos> You were perhaps less friendly about the Von Amsbergs' baby's ears.<eos> Oh, God, I...<eos> Two guinea hen pies...<eos> one for you and one for me.
- I'm tracking.<eos> It's my professional opinion that your sister requires more treatment.<eos> Apply the conduits, Timothy.<eos> Hello!<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> Help! Aah!<eos> There's a demon.<eos> There's a demon here!<eos> You can't see it!<eos> It's got you blind!
It's a joy to meet you.<eos> It's a joy to meet you finally.<eos> I never thought I would.<eos> Not after...<eos> This is Emma Borden.<eos> She would have been my daughter-in-law.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> Oh, well, before he died, Leslie and I talked about coming to visit, but then, after what happened...<eos> I don't know, I still...<eos> I felt compelled to come and meet you all.
She's my boy's teacher.<eos> Buddy, you better make tracks.<eos> You don't want to be here right now.<eos> Sorry, I-I didn't know anybody else was up.<eos> Listen, um... about today, with Brendan having to leave...<eos> It's really none of my business.<eos> My family is... very prominent in this town.<eos> Sometimes the way our business is run, it can breed enemies.<eos> Well, I don't judge.<eos> Leslie loved you all very much.
One of us should probably say something.<eos> Go for it.<eos> - Not that.<eos> I called 911.<eos> You need to get out of here.<eos> What the hell kind of a person just barrels into someone and then drives off like that?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> What happened?<eos> Do you need help?<eos> I was out walking, and I heard you two.
I'm not Anton.<eos> I am the Dollmaker.<eos> And I've done everything in my power to help the little ones survive... (HISSING)<eos> ...in this sad, cruel world.<eos> (HISSING)<eos> (GROWLING)<eos> Psychopath.<eos> You'll pay for this.<eos> DOLLMAKER:<eos> Protect me, children, as I've protected you.
(CHOKING)<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> Holy Jesus.<eos> I might've croaked on the spot if not for...<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> TALON:<eos> I'm the evening's entertainment.<eos> Can I get a volunteer from the audience?<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> I can pay you.
What do you want to build? A girlfriend?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> If you can program nanites this complex, that could be the answer.<eos> The bat venom almost eradicates the lymphoma, but the cell structure breaks down even as it forms.<eos> If we could program molecules to secure the structure, then we could stabilize the...<eos> He's okay. Too much excitement, I think.<eos> Hello, yes, we need an ambulance.<eos> We have a friend. He's sick.<eos> You should have told us how bad it was.<eos> I didn't want to bore you with the details.
I don't know, I mean...<eos> How soon can you blow this pop stand?<eos> Hand me my clothes.<eos> You sure you're well enough?<eos> I don't think he's well enough.<eos> He's not going to get any better lying on his ass.<eos> Anyway school's over.<eos> We could use a science project.<eos> Mickey, Minnie and Mighty, rest in peace.<eos> A rodent nation salutes you.
(SCREAMING)<eos> (SCREAMING)<eos> - (SCREAMING)<eos> - Tina!<eos> (SCREAMING)<eos> Who are you?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Everyone's dead.<eos> No, I hear a heartbeat.<eos> I should have called you when I got there.
Do you remember the thing he would do?<eos> He would give out presents on his birthday.<eos> He would say how grateful he was to all of us<eos> - for another good year.<eos> - Apparently, he finished your present just before he died and never told anyone.<eos> He was gonna give it to you today.<eos> A thumb drive?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And this is what is on it.<eos> It's the book that he wrote for the two of you.
By someone who really, really loved you a lot.<eos> Parts of the Whole.<eos> Is that the book Buddy wants us to read?<eos> Who's Buddy?<eos> Buddy is Christine's imaginary friend.<eos> Imaginary?<eos> Okay.<eos> Whatever makes you feel better.<eos> "Dedicated to Temperance Brennan and Seeley Booth, "the people who taught me that understanding, "compassion and love<eos> My life means more because I know you."
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries...<eos> - Where the hell are we?<eos> - 1994.<eos> To get home, we'll harness the power of the ascendant.<eos> Elena: What about Bonnie?<eos> Damon: She sacrificed herself so I could come back.<eos> She's all alone.<eos> We miss you, Bonnie.<eos> Bonnie, voice-over: I miss you guys.
Oh, my God.<eos> Bonnie?<eos> Bonnie!<eos> She can't hear me.<eos> And we can't touch anything either.<eos> Nice spell, Kai.<eos> Damon on videotape: This place is my own personal hell.<eos> Drama queen.<eos> Hey.<eos> Reporting to you live from retro world,
Alan, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, I felt bad about earlier, and I wanted to apologize. These are for you.<eos> For me, huh?<eos> "Mr. Schmidt, thank you so much for your generous donation to the children's hospital."<eos> Um, I-I did not see that.<eos> Is that the pizza guy?<eos> Herb?<eos> Alan, what are you doing here?<eos> What are you doing here, and... and why are you wearing my robe?<eos> I'll let you guys talk.
We saw what happened to Cain, okay?<eos> I'm not happy about it.<eos> But I got to move on.<eos> So I'm gonna keep doing what we do -- while I still can.<eos> And I'd like you to be there with me.<eos> All right.<eos> Agents, I gather.<eos> Uh, was it the suits, or do we give off some sort of a Fed stench?<eos> I-it's the suits.<eos> What can I do for you boys?
I can help.<eos> You really can't.<eos> For example, a friend of mine works military intelligence -- owes me a favor.<eos> Would he know what Rick and Kit's mission was?<eos> Sure.<eos> And he'd tell me all about it.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> No, it ain't.<eos> You know, I figure what's going on here --<eos> I stick to you two like flies on roadkill, make sure my buddy comes home in one piece.
Or at least that's the story that she's got to tell.<eos> I guess I've seen it all now.<eos> Some.<eos> Not all.<eos> I just want to go home, see my family.<eos> I want to thank you, Dean-o, for keeping me standing.<eos> Well, all it took was a little blood, sweat, and, uh, more sweat.<eos> You take care of yourself, you hear?<eos> All right, I will.<eos> But I still hope I don't see the two of you anymore.
Got some cream and sugar.<eos> Tell you what, your hands are full, so I'll tell you what, I'll put the coffee right over here by the nice black gloves.<eos> Thanks, Booth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How thoughtful.<eos> And unexpected.<eos> Well, it's a great day to celebrate.<eos> You know, just a job well done by everyone.<eos> You, you, great!<eos> Look at you.
Just give us some time, Booth.<eos> If the guy takes off, we might not ever find him, ask Aubrey. Right?<eos> Yeah, but what are you gonna do?<eos> Go in there and ask the killer to raise his hand?<eos> Guys, I know these guys, okay?<eos> I've been playing with them-- I know their tells, all right?<eos> I'll just bring up the murder. What?<eos> Yeah, they're not gonna cop to it, okay?<eos> But I'll know exactly who's withholding.<eos> Then you can focus on the guy. We get the evidence you need.
Eva, just wanted to say hello.<eos> I'm Gustav Borén, Acting CEO.<eos> I remember you.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were little.<eos> Your father and I worked together for a long time.<eos> He spoke highly of you.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> It's a small consolation, but the company is in good hands.<eos> We have to talk about what you want to do with your father's interests among other things.<eos> But let's wait until you're ready, I'll leave you alone.
Silverhöjd has, hands down, the tastiest deer in the country<eos> Bon appétit.<eos> Mmm!<eos> Taste it.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> good, right?<eos> I heard about your father.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Someone should collect all the expressions of regret at a time.<eos> By the way, you were not around, and they were not seen for seven years.
What does the government do?<eos> The town is in shock.<eos> A 17-year-old murdered by knife this morning at the graduation party.<eos> And now the water is poisoned.<eos> Things is not right there in Silver Height.<eos> This is what she said.<eos> I have never heard of it.<eos> I hope she knows what she's doing.<eos> I know why the water is poisoned!<eos> I'll keep you posted.
No risk there, that the truth would reveal.<eos> People think that Olof Gran is just a lunatic.<eos> A lunatic who can force the truth to be lighten.<eos> So what should we do?<eos> Yeah ... what we should've done already seven years ago.<eos> He has become one of the major risk.<eos> Here.<eos> Here is a nice piece.<eos> You have more fucking honor than someone human ever will.<eos> Cheers to you.
He just showed it to me ... and said he had heard that I like knives.<eos> Did uou touched the knife?<eos> Will we find your fingerprints on it?<eos> Then he tried to kiss me and to take my sweater off but I said I didn't want it.<eos> I said no.<eos> What did he do then?<eos> He said I could get the knife, if I agreed to make out with him.<eos> And I agreed.<eos> Could've someone else been in the room?<eos> Could've someone attacked you?
Hello, Ylva.<eos> What do you having today?<eos> Fish. The whole money.<eos> Eva!<eos> Eva!<eos> You've reached Eva Thorn ...<eos> How are we doing with the water problem?<eos> Ylva can take care of it, but it takes time.<eos> For how long?<eos> I'll keep you posted.
Hey, what's good.<eos> We have received the alarm about a suspected stabbing spree at Silver Height School.<eos> I will.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> She seems to have done it again.<eos> Okay, take the girl.<eos> Yep.<eos> Yes, when we were gathered them all.<eos> Thomas and Jeanette, it was you who called the meeting.<eos> I hope it is because you want to apologize for your actions yesterday.
But what remains to be done cannot be done alone.<eos> You must shore up your support.<eos> Mercy, your own creation, is dangerously unstable and Anne Hale, an infinitely greater threat.<eos> That pallid blossom?<eos> She is a cradle witch of the highest and oldest order.<eos> Come, child.<eos> Remember, time is not on our side.<eos> A month from now, every man, woman, and child in this cursed town will be dead by the pox or on our side.<eos> You still think of John Alden.<eos> And you wonder why we don't trust you.
To Hell!<eos> - Blessed evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Good night.<eos> Ta!<eos> Now, the only women on the streets this time of night are whores or beggars.<eos> I ain't never seen a beggar smile.<eos> So, how much?<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> I just want you.
Hear, hear!<eos> My husband...<eos> N... Let us be done with that.<eos> Mrs. Sibley, until George may speak for himself, clearly and audibly as a man, let us at least admit it is you, Mrs. sibley, who lead the select men of Salem.<eos> I submit it is high time that the select men of Salem either elect a new leader or explicitly affirm that they choose to be led by Mary Sibley under the name of her incapacitated husband, George.<eos> If you think this pox cares whether you be led by a woman or a man, you will all die.<eos> The pox no more discriminates by sex than a lion prefers to eat a man or a woman.<eos> Though like a lion, it may take the weakest first.<eos> And I have just been to where your weakest reside, in wretched Knocker's Hole.<eos> I had hoped to give them more voice here than they obviously have, but I find you all consumed with petty politics.

Why, this woman is not afraid to walk into the den of plague for our people.<eos> Would you care to join me, Sir?<eos> The worst afflicted are this way.<eos> In my experience, the difference between a plague terrorizing a town and destroying it is a matter of days.<eos> Hold there.<eos> Tell me, Sir.<eos> Who are you to speak with such confidence of the pox?<eos> A doctor, Ma'am, with royal certification.<eos> I've walked through many poxes.<eos> I survived the plague as a child, and I believe I can save all of you.
When exactly was the last time you saw your father?<eos> Um... earlier on the day I left.<eos> He felt quite certain that he and his militia would lay their hands upon John Alden, and he felt that his flock here in Boston had suffered without a Shepherd for far too long.<eos> So, he sent me back to prepare for his own return.<eos> I see.<eos> Though, of course, he never did.<eos> What?<eos> Return.<eos> No.<eos> What do you think it says that he sent you back just when he was about to attempt to capture the witch?
What do you think it says that he sent you back just when he was about to attempt to capture the witch?<eos> It doesn't exactly show a lot of confidence.<eos> We argued.<eos> Yes, as one does.<eos> I don't recall ever arguing with my father.<eos> I certainly never raised my voice.<eos> It would have felt to me like striking him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> If either of us was likely to bolster words with blows, it would have been my father, not me.<eos> Are you saying that your father struck you?
And your bladder shrinks.<eos> So you feel like an incontinent mammoth, yet require more love and affirmation than ever.<eos> And Pål, who can hardly recognize you, has to supply you with this love.<eos> The reason he longs back to the past, is because he's terrified of fatherhood.<eos> He misses that less-serious life.<eos> He has no tools to handle this.<eos> If men got pregnant, it would be classified as a venereal disease.<eos> Aborting would be like flossing.<eos> So you're saying our problem can't be solved?<eos> I'm saying if you consider this a problem, have an abortion.
Don't let go.<eos> - Do you think you can drive?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get out of here, don't look back.<eos> Drive. Drive.<eos> All right, Carol.<eos> You want me, you got me.<eos> Vincent.<eos> BOB: Run, beast, run.<eos> For the record, it was Bob's idea to blow you guys up last time, not mine.
- Get her in the car.<eos> - Atchison?<eos> TESS: He made it to the station, they patched him up.<eos> Thanks to you getting him out of here, he's gonna be okay.<eos> I should've listened to you. Believed you.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Starting to think I was chasing ghosts too.<eos> Yeah, but, Cat, they weren't just after you.<eos> They split you up on purpose.
My people will be in touch.<eos> Oh, Oliver, these eggs are heaven.<eos> Don't tell me you made them--<eos> In the slow cooker. The slow cooker you got us, yeah.<eos> Aww. I knew it.<eos> I knew it.<eos> People are always so hesitant to try them, but slow cookers are absolute life-changers.<eos> I don't know how that is not a bumper sticker yet.<eos> I know.<eos> On the topic of life-changers, you guys really need to get on the school situation here.
Thank you.<eos> We need to stop the train.<eos> Got any ideas?<eos> Yeah, blow it up.<eos> So what are you gonna call yourself now?<eos> Everybody thinks Roy was the Arrow.<eos> He won't need a code name if he's headed back to Ivy town.<eos> Well, then I guess I need a code name.<eos> Felicity and I, we have missed this.<eos> We've missed all of you.
Just speak as we practiced and know that you look lovely, milady.<eos> Are you worried, brother?<eos> We're placing our lives in the hands of a stranger, Niklaus.<eos> Lucien, you were sent to fetch the Comte Du Guise.<eos> Indisposed, your grace.<eos> Gout.<eos> May I present his children?<eos> The lords Finn, Niklaus, Elijah, and Kol.<eos> Also the lovely lady Rebekah.<eos> Your father never mentioned you to me in all our dealings.
Yes, but what if it had gone the other way, hmm?<eos> When Finn was killed, we all learned the truth...<eos> The life of every vampire is linked back to the original who begat the line.<eos> Kol's death confirmed it.<eos> Two entire lines of vampires wiped out.<eos> As you can imagine, the treat of it doesn't sit well with those of us that remain.<eos> Anyone fearing death as a result of my demise should come see me.<eos> I'll be happy to reassure them. Of course.<eos> You and your siblings are mighty indeed, yet the attacks on you do show that you are not completely invulnerable.<eos> While you've wallowed in your family affairs, your progeny have grown somewhat restless.
We don't even know what this is.<eos> Now you're saying it can be passed on?<eos> He's right.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Inside.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> How long has it been since you were attacked?<eos> Three, four hours.<eos> The real question is, how long till I become like them?<eos> Brothers, sisters... I know I have no right, I have no standing to ask you -- you anything, but these are desperate times, so ask I must.
But, I promise, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> Well, it's just that you introduced me as Daphne's mom, not Toby's.<eos> I did?<eos> I did.<eos> Look, does Julian know you have a boyfriend?<eos> Honey, I am not judging.<eos> It's just that I know how Toby feels about you, and I don't want to see him get his heart broken again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want all of you here two hours before the game, tomorrow.
You're talking about our life.<eos> That's what's so sad.<eos> And it's the only life you'll ever get.<eos> I'll let you determine whether this is sad or not:<eos> For your first 18 years together you did everything you could to make things work.<eos> Through the sleep-deprived, exhausting baby phase.<eos> Where you replaced sex and physical contact with your children's love.<eos> Your convinced yourselves that was the best way to be parents.<eos> You gave your kids everything, but drifted apart.<eos> Later you desperately tried to find back to what you once had.

Enjoy the cruise, walt.<eos> Happy, the signal's still jumping around.<eos> The girders are just steel alloy.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm down here, and I'm telling you,<eos> I can't get a proper signal. Calm down. I'm trying to find<eos> An answer.<eos> Excuse me, I am perfectly calm.<eos> Yeah, you sound perfectly calm.<eos> Enough.<eos> This thing's echoing in my ear From you two acting like children.
You've really got this all in hand, don't you?<eos> Mm, I'm surprised Catherine trusted you to plan the banquet.<eos> The dauphin vintage tasting is not exactly a coronation, but still, the chance to taste wine bottled on the day of the king's birth is bringing nobles from all over France.<eos> Well, actually, it was Mary's decision, although I'm sure Catherine would have happily given me the opportunity just to see me fail.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I recognize Count du Grace, but that's not the countess.<eos> Do you think he brought his mistress?<eos> No, he's hoping he brought the king's mistress.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I should have warned you.
That's why these lords are bringing their ready young daughters.<eos> They're hoping that<eos> Francis will choose one of them<eos> - to take to his bed.<eos> - And what makes them think that Francis wants a mistress?<eos> Our estrangement has become obvious.<eos> Separate chambers...<eos> Well, plenty of kings and queens keep separate chambers.<eos> You did.<eos> Just when I was starting to like you.
He loves Mary.<eos> Things change, Lola.<eos> If Francis and Mary are finished, there's an opportunity at the king's side for some lucky girl here.<eos> I need to speak with you.<eos> There are plans to settle.<eos> Scotland.<eos> This is not the place.<eos> Hardly.<eos> Shouldn't there be an empty room in the wine cellar now, devoid of a certain vintage?<eos> I'll meet you there in an hour.
I couldn't leave, not without your answer.<eos> My answer is no.<eos> Well, that's not the answer I was hoping to leave with.<eos> So here I'll stay.<eos> I don't trust you, and I don't believe you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because your suggestion that we should wed as soon as your ailing wife dies is so rash.<eos> It is rash, and yet here I am.<eos> I can't seem to take back my words,<eos> - and I can't seem to leave you.
I can't.<eos> It's not yet safe for that.<eos> But for the first time in so long, I think the time is close.<eos> Fetch me something.<eos> I don't care what it is, but fetch it from far away.<eos> I have to ask you something.<eos> You're a king.<eos> You could have anyone.<eos> So honestly, Antoine, why me?<eos> It is not easy for most men to love you.

These are all lovely words, Antoine, but they don't change the fact that you have a wife, and I a husband.<eos> You have a husband who no longer trusts you.<eos> I think if you ask him for an annulment, he will grant you one.<eos> I have a dying wife who wants me to find a mother for our children.<eos> Are you sure you want a mother for your children who has no shame?<eos> Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood<eos> - is something that doesn't interest you...
And thank you.<eos> Louis, it's happening.<eos> It's finally happening.<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> I can move forward.<eos> We can move forward.<eos> I can unify my country, and we can have a place to be together.<eos> I want to celebrate, too.<eos> When it's safe.<eos> We should get you back to the castle.
Is that what you were hinting at earlier?<eos> To answer your question:<eos> because I am Mary's lady.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - And friend.<eos> Also, you despise me.<eos> Why are you looking at me that way?<eos> Because you're the mother of my son's child.<eos> You have given Francis something that Mary hasn't and probably never will.<eos> And he likes you.
Or in the same castle, apparently.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but my uncle sent me to give you a private message.<eos> Something he's learned of one of the lords.<eos> Of course.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's this message that's so important?<eos> I'm sorry, Majesty.<eos> There is no message.<eos> All that wine, and the look of you, I just...<eos> Is this your choosing or has someone pressured you?
You will do what your family needs.<eos> Or I will tell Francis all that I know of you and his wife.<eos> He will cut off my head, Antoine.<eos> Who will get you Elizabeth then?<eos> Well, you won't help me now.<eos> Why should I think you'll help me if I let you live?<eos> And remember, if the nobles learn of the affair, the law demands Mary's head, too.<eos> Will you risk Mary's life for a few nights of passion?<eos> You have two hours.<eos> End it with Mary, or I will end both of you.
Be a gentleman, sir, and let go of her.<eos> I said it's none of your business.<eos> Actually, it is my business.<eos> Gigi is my neighbor, my friend and...<eos> You mean she's one of your whores?<eos> I've seen you pocket your take from them.<eos> You tell your whore she ain't done her job, and I want what's mine, one way or another.<eos> You'll step away from Gigi now, or everyone here will understand why the working girls call you "Old Shrivel."<eos> Would you like that, sir?<eos> Who needs you?
- My lady.<eos> - Some water!<eos> - Water!<eos> Are you all right, my darling?<eos> Give me one moment.<eos> Kenna, please stop.<eos> Listen.<eos> Whatever you think you may know, my wife is pregnant, yes, but she's still very ill.<eos> That's why I sent for her...<eos> I thought she might want to meet you...
I did.<eos> I had to see this illness of hers for myself.<eos> So you were testing my story.<eos> Bash was right.<eos> Your only intention was vengeance on him for killing your brother.<eos> You never intended to marry me, not for one moment.<eos> Just to bed me, to punish my husband.<eos> You're right.<eos> It began that way,<eos> - but I do want you.

30 euros...<eos> - Hard to believe.<eos> It's the times.<eos> I'm out of it completely.<eos> I just have my sport studios, and I've worked with children for the last 10 years.<eos> I have fun doing sport with children.<eos> I also do charity events in support of two organizations:<eos> Child in the Center and New Land. For 30 years they've supported sexually abused children.<eos> In my opinion, as long as a single child is suffering, our damn world is not in order.<eos> I'm ver y proud of you! Fantastic!
- Communications are dead!<eos> M.I.R.A., open the door!<eos> Open the pod bay door!<eos> I wanted to go to Mars... not die on Mars.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We're not on Mars.<eos> We're on earth.<eos> Hello?<eos> Beckett?<eos> Are you saying that the computer tried to kill you?
Kubrick was right.<eos> A.I. is a bad idea.<eos> M.I.R.A.'S not A.I.<eos> Yes, she can learn and adapt, but she's a machine.<eos> She cannot think for herself.<eos> Then why'd she try to kill us?<eos> It wasn't M.I.R.A.<eos> We just pulled apart the server.<eos> Someone embedded a subroutine into the O.S. reset program.<eos> The moment that you tried to reboot her, that subroutine activated, trapping you guys inside.
To live?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> I mean, not right away, of course.<eos> I mean, it's gonna take me a while to find exactly the right space.<eos> Mother, I was just calling a family meeting.<eos> I didn't intend for you to move out.<eos> Darling, this is not about you.<eos> This is about me.<eos> Think of it as a kind of evolution, you know? I'm...<eos> I'm starting to do very well for myself, and I am guessing that, uh, before too long, there's gonna be a few more little Castles creating havoc around here, and... and I think the two of you
I'm just saying.<eos> It's a lot of people.<eos> We're not even on year two yet.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Well, Liam clearly has an idea.<eos> Otherwise why would he try to expose Vincent by tipping off the police?<eos> Wait, so you think that Liam's trying to expose Vincent as a beast?<eos> It is the worst thing that could happen to us, right?<eos> I really think that Liam's trying to get revenge on us because we wouldn't let him get revenge on the Ellingsworihs.<eos> He's not confusing you two for Rebecca and Alistair anymore?
- Because I can't know.<eos> - What?<eos> Then Liam would know she knows and our only chance of stopping him would be gone.<eos> - What've we done?<eos> - You didn't have a choice.<eos> But he wasn't supposed to get shot.<eos> That wasn't part of the plan.<eos> You didn't have time to come up with a plan.<eos> Liam kills the director, tries to pin it on Vincent?<eos> You're just lucky that Agent Russo believed you.
Please, at least tell me your real name.<eos> Victor.<eos> We need to do it right now. Jack, I'm tired.<eos> I just had to work a double shift.<eos> I need you to talk to Camille.<eos> I need you to ask her why she's here. Why she's here?<eos> I need you to ask why she's here.<eos> She's here for Claire.<eos> She wants Claire to know that she's okay. And then?<eos> She's going back to the other side, but she's sending all of you her love.
Journalist.<eos> I'd like to ask you some questions about your daughter, Camille.<eos> My daughter passed four years ago.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Mrs. Winship, I came across some posts online...<eos> Things people are saying about Camille... that she's back.<eos> I told you, my daughter is dead.<eos> I have nothing else to say to you.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> Rowan and Tommy, the path that brought you together has been a steep and winding one, but I believe it has been leading you here.
As far as you'll take me, I guess.<eos> you don't want to go where I'm going.<eos> You should get out of town.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> It's this town... and whatever's in it.<eos> What the...?<eos> Y-y-you're not gonna understand, but it's the only way.<eos> I wish you hadn't seen that.<eos> Do you, Rowan Blackshaw, take this man,<eos> Tomas Solano, to be your husband... to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part?
He burned that house down with both of them in it.<eos> Julie?<eos> Julie?<eos> Victor?<eos> Is that you?<eos> _<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Matt, Kris, what a beautiful picture of Bethany.<eos> Man, I can't believe after all this planning, tonight's finally here.<eos> Well, it... it would not have come together without you guys and your hard work.
Tony!<eos> Did you call the police?<eos> I couldn't call the police.<eos> I had Camille with me.<eos> The sheriff's already looking for her.<eos> I didn't know what to do, so we just left.<eos> Camille saw them?<eos> She's devastated, Jack.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey, nobody saw you.
I think she's back.<eos> - Back. - From the dead.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I always know where to find you.<eos> I'm an angel after all, right?<eos> Do you want to play with me?<eos> I can't.<eos> Not right now.<eos> But I need you to deliver a message to your mom for me, okay?<eos> Okay, tell her I'm coming to pick you guys up tonight right after dark.
Mr. Commissioner, thank you for your service.<eos> Thank you very much, everybody.<eos> My best wishes to...<eos> Commissioner Essen.<eos> And the maître d' says, "You can't bring them in here."<eos> Hear me, slaves.<eos> My patience is wearing thin.<eos> Surrender your souls to my mercy, or I swear by the master, I shall feast on your pain.<eos> I shall gorge on your torment.<eos> I shall crush you like a bug.
- Oh, my God.<eos> What the hell is this place?<eos> Ain't Arkham, anyhow.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> Welcome, everyone.<eos> My name is Theo Galavan.<eos> This is my sister Tabitha.<eos> Oh, my God, look at that. Yeah, I got to get my hands on that.<eos> I understand, you're feeling confused, scared... a little groggy...<eos> Today is the first day of a wonderful future for all of you.
I'm reporting live from the scene of the GCPD massacre.<eos> We have just obtained video footage of the attack recorded by one of the assailants.<eos> I want to warn those of you watching, what you're about to see is very graphic.<eos> Hello, Gotham City!<eos> We're the Maniax.<eos> And I'm Jerome, the shot caller of our little gang.<eos> We're here to spread the message of wisdom and hope.<eos> Some people have no manners.<eos> You're all prisoners.<eos> What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing that you're just little tiny cogs in a giant absurd machine.
The bastard shot Fish.<eos> It was complicated.<eos> He loves her just like you do.<eos> - And if she ever comes back...<eos> - When she comes back.<eos> When she does, he will be right by her side.<eos> If she comes back?<eos> Sure.<eos> But she...<eos> But right now, he got a nice job for you guys.
You mean, like, crime?<eos> Man, you are square.<eos> I guess I got no choice.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Maybe you remind me of me.<eos> If I was a doofus.<eos> This crime... what exactly you got in mind?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen!<eos> Or should I say, pimps, hoes and thieves!<eos> Do I have some product for you today!
Tabby, could you come here, please?<eos> Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.<eos> - Can we help?<eos> - Be my pleasure.<eos> All right, let-let's... let's talk about this.<eos> Can we talk about this?<eos> Take it easy. What are you doing?<eos> Relax.<eos> We just want to help.<eos> I'll leave you two to it.
Kristen?<eos> I've been following the goings-on at Wayne Enterprises.<eos> - What have you learned?<eos> - That your father was a good man.<eos> But in spite of that, bad things happened at his company.<eos> Looking for Penguin's mother, weren't you?<eos> I have to obey him in all things.<eos> Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.<eos> Can we help?<eos> I'll leave you two to it.
You expecting company?<eos> Neighborhood ain't what it used to be, Jim. Where's Penguin?<eos> How should I know?<eos> You're the boss' lapdog and you don't know where your owner is?<eos> I ain't nobody's lapdog.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Tell us why the hell Penguin went after Galavan.<eos> I ain't telling you anything.<eos> And unless you have a warrant, I'm gonna have to ask you boys to leave.
Gordon, Bullock...<eos> Go ahead, Captain.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> You're boxed in. There's lots of cover, high vantage points all or out.<eos> Perfect spot for an ambush.<eos> Yeah, I gotta pull you out.<eos> Turn around, you get nothing.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I'm pulling you out.
- she'll call off the wedding.<eos> - Tess is right. She will.<eos> Let's just think this through, all right?<eos> All right, all that's happened so far is Julianna escaped, and for all we know it's just to avoid prosecution.<eos> Or there really is a Liam out there and she's going after him.<eos> Yeah, but even if he does exist, and we've found no evidence of that, it's still not a direct threat to us, which means if you told Cat, she'd be cancelling the wedding for no reason.<eos> You're saying we keep this from Catherine?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> At least until after the wedding. Which is, what, 10, 11 hours from now?<eos> Why ruin it for her? Why ruin it for you?
Then what was the point of me renting a moving truck?<eos> I mean, besides the rough sex we had up against the sides?<eos> They locked me outside on the side of the road for that one.<eos> Okay, well, we have to go back in.<eos> See you tonight at the beef-a-thon.<eos> No, Oleg.<eos> Maybe I'm being unfair.<eos> I mean, you have all this stuff that you like, and they have an apartment.<eos> Put it in there.<eos> Sophie! I'll see you at 8:00!
To be a porn star. Yeah.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Like, sometimes, I'll think about it and just be like, "Why did I do that?"<eos> Like, "Why would I wanna keep going?"<eos> But it's really not that hard to take advantage of an 18-year-old that's fucking on camera.<eos> I mean, most girls, whenever I was in the industry, would always say yes to anything, so...<eos> If it had a dollar sign in front of it, sign me up.<eos> Guys, how did everyone find Riley?<eos> Craigslist.<eos> What's the thing that made you guys wanna do porn?
In a pink bag?<eos> Those are not gloves.<eos> So, uh, what's up with these boys from your class?<eos> They're running late. Ahh.<eos> Ok, well, don't miss your curfew.<eos> I won't.<eos> don't you trust me?<eos> Yeah, I trust you.<eos> It's the boys I don't trust. Ok.<eos> Well, I'm gonna leave you guys to it.
I'm not doubting you, Toby.<eos> No. Just my plan. Aren't you the one who says, "We are our ideas"?<eos> How about we all stop fighting?<eos> How about we wait and see what happens?<eos> I know what would've happened. He would've helped without you bribing him.<eos> You're biased because of your own Oliver Twist upbringing.<eos> Besides, what do you know?<eos> According to the news, you're just our supernanny.<eos> You're playing with fire, Doc. I'll be shocked if it works.<eos> It astounds me that I have to remind you all that I had a medical degree from Harvard before most people have their driver's licenses.
- Previously on Reign:<eos> - How did we die, Mother?<eos> She suffocated you.
Ah, why, Diane.<eos> I heard you were back to visit your son.<eos> How daring of you to return.<eos> After you banished me?<eos> After you took away everything that Henry promised me?<eos> Come, now.<eos> You gained something since Henry's death.<eos> A daughter-in-law, Kenna.<eos> Well, granted, she was Henry's discarded girlfriend.<eos> The one that replaced you.
Don't do it, Greer.<eos> What choice do I have?<eos> Remember, if that book is found, I'll make sure the Crown knows you were my partner in its concealment as well.<eos> They might take your head, as well as your new counting house.<eos> It took me longer to find the twins' nanny.<eos> She changed her name after marrying.<eos> She did more than marry.<eos> She married a noble.<eos> Wonder how she managed that.<eos> I hope I haven't kept you.
I saw Claude's little dress in the corner... the one with the flowers torn off... and I knew the answer.<eos> So after my sisters froze to death, you shoved flowers into their mouths and waited for my mother to blame me?<eos> I hoped she would think you were too young to know what you'd done.<eos> I hoped she'd forgive you.<eos> She did not forgive me.<eos> Why weren't you punished for leaving your post?<eos> Don't you see?<eos> Mother and Father both covered up for her without realizing the other was doing it.<eos> Mother didn't want any questions asked, because she told that fever story so no one thought me a monster.<eos> And Father married you off to some noble to make sure you never told Mother where you really were that night, isn't that right?
God.<eos> Come on, Mother!<eos> Coming.<eos> Forget the Ice Festival; come with us!<eos> I need rest.<eos> Are you having as much fun as I am?<eos> I am, as... as much as I can.<eos> As much as you can?<eos> I want to enjoy myself, I do, but how can I when you bring me such pleasure, but also such pain?<eos> I hid the truth about your murders, but if Claude killed you, I raised a monster.
Is there something between them we don't know about?<eos> You're what's between them.<eos> Enough!<eos> Stop!<eos> Catherine?<eos> Catherine!<eos> Henry.<eos> What on earth are you doing?<eos> You'll freeze to death.<eos> You're lucky I found you.
Enough!<eos> Stop!<eos> Catherine?<eos> Catherine!<eos> Henry.<eos> What on earth are you doing?<eos> You'll freeze to death.<eos> You're lucky I found you.<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> A servant saw you by the garden door.
Oh, but the gifts: châteaux, jewels, that ridiculous chapel he had built with all that stained glass.<eos> That was after the twins were born.<eos> Carnal relations never ended with us, either.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I hope it brings you some peace to know your daughter didn't kill the twins.<eos> I should go.<eos> Such haste.<eos> I haven't properly mocked you for saving the life of your mother's worst enemy.
Because I brought you here to ease my conscience.<eos> Oh, but you were a lie in life, too.<eos> Everything you ever spoke of or promised were all lies.<eos> Loyalty, duty... even France.<eos> Nothing mattered more to you than yourself.<eos> Why are you arguing, Mother?<eos> Because, my darlings, I'm afraid our time together must come to an end.<eos> Now, you need to find peace, away from this place.<eos> I will be with you one day, I promise.<eos> To you, it will seem very soon.
So we might find the happiness she's found with Francis.<eos> All very neat and tidy, isn't it?<eos> Well, hardly.<eos> Perhaps you think you're some gallant defender of Mary's, but look around.<eos> You've spawned harmful gossip with your male pride, and she's doing everything she can to stop it.<eos> I don't care if your heart leads you my way or not, but I won't have it lead you to Mary.<eos> She's my oldest friend, and I'll see her protected from any threat, gallant or otherwise.<eos> You're quite fierce when you want to be, aren't you?<eos> Are you mocking me?<eos> I'm admiring you.
I twisted my neck, and I need my pillow.<eos> I'm in agony.<eos> Yes, mother moving in was inconvenient, but what did he want me to do, just get rid of her? Who does that?<eos> I mean, a ghoul, that's who.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> - What's wrong? Uh-- oh, nothing.<eos> I was just reliving the moment you told us about you and Cooper. Aww.<eos> You're so dear.<eos> You know that-- that fish I gave you and Mitchell?<eos> That really wasn't the gift we picked out for you.
That really wasn't the gift we picked out for you.<eos> - Really? - No, I was just being mean.<eos> It's just that, when I saw that cheese plate, I just--<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Did-- did you give us that because Cooper and I talked about opening up a little cheese shop?<eos> Yes! Why else?<eos> How sweet!<eos> Carmelina's probably halfway home with it, but I can make her walk back.<eos> And this...<eos> This is for you.

Listen to me, Julio.<eos> I want the gutters cleaned today, not mañana.<eos> If everyone thought my people were lazy, I would do whatever it took to not seem lazy.<eos> Comprende?<eos> Actually, we're gonna take off soon, so we're gonna need you to turn off your phone.<eos> I'm actually not done talking, and two more.<eos> Well, if I were you, I'd put down the burrito and get up that ladder.<eos> What are you doing standing there and not getting drinks for me and my good friend, Claire?<eos> Actually, we just met.<eos> Oh, guys, guys, I can't let you do the cleanup all by yourselves.
No, mom.<eos> I was kicked out for punching a really misunderstood kid, thanks to you.<eos> Thanks to me?<eos> What, did--<eos> I told him everything. And you know what we realized?<eos> There is a bully in our life, and it's you.<eos> You make the rules, you boss us around,<eos> - and we're not gonna take it anymore.<eos> - Mm. Yeah.<eos> Ah, look at you two, standing up to the big, scary bully that loves you and protects you and wants you to be safe in this world.
The first blooms have been sighted in the snow.<eos> We feast, dance, celebrate new beginnings.<eos> But it's still winter.<eos> The blooms will likely have a short life.<eos> But it's the promise that spring will come eventually.<eos> Hmm, and do you have an escort to this feast?<eos> The queen has commanded that we see one another.<eos> But should you be there with me?<eos> You're King Antoine's liaison to the French court.<eos> Won't he need you at his side for introductions?
Goading the king.<eos> You are alive at my mercy, and even in passing, you pour poison into my thoughts<eos> - about my wife.<eos> - Please, don't pretend that these are new thoughts.<eos> You've seen Condé buzzing<eos> - around Mary. - Oh, do shut up, Narcisse, and do as you're told.<eos> You exist to serve me now.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Majesty.<eos> Although I should warn you, though Antoine is king of a tiny nation, his foes don't tend to survive.
- around Mary. - Oh, do shut up, Narcisse, and do as you're told.<eos> You exist to serve me now.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Majesty.<eos> Although I should warn you, though Antoine is king of a tiny nation, his foes don't tend to survive.<eos> Another thing that makes you the man for the job.<eos> Lady Kenna.<eos> Ah, I see you know my name now.<eos> I was hoping you might give me a tour of the castle.<eos> I don't think I'd be the best guide for you, as you have a bit of a reputation, Your Majesty.

Are you sure?<eos> No, that's the problem with clandestine intelligence.<eos> It works by links of informants and hearsay.<eos> One can never be sure anything is true.<eos> We must find out.<eos> If it is true, if we don't stop them at once...<eos> England could invade any time they choose.<eos> I thought you'd never get here.<eos> I was detained by politics.<eos> Are you sure it wasn't some pretty girl that detained you?
Really?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Well, it's nothing to be sorry about.<eos> I'm being courted by a handsome prince, literally.<eos> It's just...<eos> Narcisse's efforts to pull me in irritate me.<eos> Well, they wouldn't irritate you if you had no interest in him.<eos> You want me to spy on my brother.<eos> I need you to find out if the threat to this country's survival is real.<eos> I know it puts you in a difficult position,
And we shall.<eos> There are many ways to pleasure each other and I'm open to all of them, except the one that produces a child.<eos> You are full of orders.<eos> And what if I refuse?<eos> As your station is as low as it can go and I'm a princess, let's do things my way, shall we?<eos> Well, given those terms, I...<eos> I must respectfully decline.<eos> You can't just walk away.<eos> Oh, if I'm not myself, you wouldn't like me anyway, Princess.<eos> Oh, seeing I'm leaving you without a mentor, I will give you this one lesson free of charge:
Very well.<eos> I've had conversations with English agents.<eos> They've offered quite a sizable amount in exchange for allowing their troops in Navarre.<eos> You come here to talk peace and you were dealing with our greatest enemy behind our backs?<eos> Well, I didn't ask Elizabeth to approach me, nor do I particularly want to make a deal with her.<eos> But Navarre, a very small nation...<eos> Strategically positioned at our backs.<eos> Needs to find money from somewhere.<eos> You've been conspiring with our enemy.<eos> Give us one reason why we wouldn't kill you now.
I need every man on the field.<eos> And her?<eos> She goes to an encampment for runaway slaves.<eos> Then perhaps I could transport her.<eos> It could save us another loss, which we cannot afford.<eos> And at the very least, provide some answers about today.<eos> Report in the moment you've signed for her release.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Crane.<eos> Your Oxford degree and connections are not going to save you next time.
- Is she secured?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> However, I do not believe she is a spy.<eos> Her rantings are lunacy.<eos> She needs care.<eos> Go home.<eos> Sir, uh... the 12th Regiment...<eos> You have been relieved of duty.<eos> - Permission to speak...<eos> - You are lucky I do not hang you for treason.
I suspect she'll be sent to an asylum.<eos> Or... hanged.<eos> Rosemary.<eos> Sage and sweet wine.<eos> I've seen you prepare this for patients who are bearing children.<eos> My love, are you...<eos> With child?<eos> Ichabod, this tincture is for Liza Putnam next door.<eos> She is due any day now.<eos> I hope that does not disappoint you.
One of the greatest minds in the colonies has died, and you are going to answer for it.<eos> Colonel, I'm on your side.<eos> I've got information for you.<eos> Of the same sort you had for Captain Crane?<eos> There have been a lot of developments<eos> - in close quarter combat.<eos> - Are you threatening me?<eos> Save your breath for after you have tasted America's true strength.<eos> Now, that's true American strength.<eos> I'm here to save you.
Katrina that traveled back in time, is not the same woman that you know.<eos> There was a time she was good and she loved you.<eos> She saved my life.<eos> Yours, too.<eos> That Katrina's gone.<eos> The seeds must have been there.<eos> How did I not see it?<eos> We're all blind to what we do and don't want to believe.<eos> Is that why you chased Katrina back in time?<eos> You knew I'd not survive without you?
That's the technical term for us.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> How are you here?<eos> Oh, Abigail, I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.<eos> Suffice it to say, she is from... the future.<eos> She followed a blood magic practitioner to our time.<eos> Benjamin Franklin said that you would know how to reverse the Traveler Spell.<eos> Uh... the Abiero spell will return you to the moment the spell was cast.
She looks just like Eva.<eos> That's because it is Eva.<eos> Her prints match.<eos> This is your girl.<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> I checked her dental records, too, Castle. It's her.<eos> I wish I could tell you it wasn't.<eos> I take it that the cause of death is blunt-force trauma.<eos> It looks like a massive skull fracture in the parietal region, but she just came in, so I've only done a preliminary exam.<eos> Once I've finished my autopsy, I'll give you a call. Okay.
As my great-grandfather said back in 1947 when we first opened,<eos> Camp Firewood is more than just a summer camp.<eos> Camp Firewood is an idea.<eos> A promise.<eos> A way of life.<eos> "A promise, a way of life..." I covered that.<eos> All right, I just wanted to have a quick meeting with the junior staff before the buses get here.<eos> All right, some of you were campers here last year.<eos> But now, you're all 16 or 17 years old.<eos> So do not think that being a counselor means that you are campers with drinking privileges.
Can you do this?<eos> How crass.<eos> That guttersnipe is doing push-ups in front of Katie.<eos> How does he keep his body so horizontal when he's doing the push-up?<eos> It's very easy.<eos> Any novice crewsman can do it.<eos> Clench the butt, keep the gut pulled in.<eos> Perpendicularity is your friend.<eos> I could muster a few of these myself.<eos> Get off the deck, you halfwits, before I put you there permanently!
Make it count.<eos> All right, I'll call TWA.<eos> We're half past the top of the morning here on the first day of Camp Firewood.<eos> Today's the day you let everybody know just who you are.<eos> -Are you a jock?<eos> An artist? Yeah!<eos> Maybe you're a cool kid.<eos> Who you sit next to at lunch today could set the stage for the rest of your summer.<eos> And do yourself a favor, folks.<eos> Don't get caught picking your nose, or you're gonna be known as the Booger Kid, and we got eight weeks to go.

God! Let us know what's hot and what is not.<eos> As always, you got the Beekeeper spinning only the platters that matter.
Fart.<eos> - As always, very original, Drew.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Let's try again.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Once...<eos> - Upon...<eos> A...<eos> Titty!<eos> Come on, guys. This could be very rewarding if you actually made an effort.
Who is this guy?<eos> That's Yaron. He's the new Soccer Counselor.<eos> He's from Israel.<eos> - Ya-what?<eos> - Yaron.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yaron.<eos> - Ya-reun?<eos> - Ya-ron.<eos> Wow. I'm so happy to meet all of you.
- And I like to defecate in other people's clothing.<eos> It's my thing and I'm not ashamed of it.<eos> - If you're not ashamed, why'd you hide it?<eos> - Because...<eos> Because it's a game!<eos> Yeah. And that's not the only treasure.<eos> I've taken shits in many of your bathing suits, and it's your boys' jobs to find out which ones they are.<eos> - Isn't that fun?<eos> - It's disgusting.<eos> Well, when you're my age, you'll look back on this and it will all make sense.
Very pretty, isn't it?<eos> It's just come from the embroiderer.<eos> Isn't it sweet?<eos> For her little head.<eos> Cremuel?<eos> I am told that when you thought the King was dead, your first action was to send for the bastard Mary.<eos> You did not think of me, or my daughter or the child I was carrying then.<eos> I cannot hold the throne for an infant in the cradle.<eos> I cannot hold the throne for an unborn baby.<eos> I promoted you.
Me? No, sir. I'm a banker.<eos> What will happen to Anne Boleyn?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Convent?<eos> Look at this little doggie.<eos> Oh, why are you so sad, Mark?<eos> You have no business being sad.<eos> You're here to entertain us.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, stand on your feet.<eos> I do you favour by noticing you at all.

You're no queen.<eos> You're just a knight's daughter and your time has come.<eos> Harry? Do me a good turn - take away my brother's wife and drown her.<eos> ~ Anne!<eos> ~ What?<eos> Didn't you swear you'd walk barefoot to China for me?<eos> I think it was barefoot to Walsingham I offered.<eos> Perhaps you can repent your sins there.<eos> Because if anything happened to the King, you'd look to have me.<eos> Oh, yes, you see now, Mary, why he hasn't married you yet?
Get him back and he'll swear on the Bible. He knows me to be a good wife.<eos> Get him back! Harry!<eos> Henry had heard about the fight with Norris.<eos> We could all see from the courtyard.<eos> She had her hands...<eos> You know the King's great tapestry? Where the Queen clasps her hands together?<eos> He didn't look persuaded.<eos> Did you not go to her to comfort her?<eos> She being your mistress?<eos> No. I came looking for you.
You know why.<eos> The better to rule.<eos> Suppose she gets a boy and it has Weston's long face? Or looks like Will Brereton?<eos> But they can't call it a bastard if it looks like a Boleyn.<eos> Be advised by me.<eos> Speak to no-one.<eos> Be advised by me.<eos> Speak to Mark Smeaton.<eos> We can leave that here, Mark.<eos> I thought there was to be a great company? I thought I was going to entertain you.
With me.<eos> You're amazed.<eos> I'm not as amazed as you might think.<eos> I've seen how she looks at you.<eos> And it's no surprise that any woman would be drawn to you.<eos> You're a very handsome young man.<eos> But we thought you were a sodomite.<eos> Rich!<eos> I'm as good a man as any of them.<eos> Of course you are and the Queen would give you good report.

Found you to her liking.
There's a pretty ballad for you.<eos> The King fingers his lute, while his lutenist fingers his wife.<eos> You have the warrant, my lord?<eos> Perhaps this'll teach Henry to listen to me.<eos> Uncle.<eos> Lord Chancellor.<eos> Master Treasurer.<eos> And Cremuel.<eos> The man I created.<eos> He created you in turn, madam.
Why not drink the cup to its filthy dregs?<eos> Come, Wolsey, we're fetching you to Hell, where our master, Beelzebub, is expecting you to supper!<eos> Beelzebub would have you joint his venison.<eos> He's heard of your skill as a butcher!<eos> I know why I'm here.<eos> My wife.<eos> What has she said?<eos> Whatever it is, you can't hold me on the word of one woman.<eos> There've been other women who have been recipients of your... gallantry, George.<eos> You've always regarded women as disposable...
But you, because you have no respect for the law or... ~ I have every respect!<eos> ~ Don't interrupt me!<eos> You had the man abducted and hanged.<eos> You think because it's only one man, it doesn't matter.<eos> You think no-one will remember, but I remember.<eos> You think you can do anything because Norfolk favours you...<eos> The King favours me!<eos> Does he?<eos> Does he?<eos> Well, you should complain about your lodgings, then, shouldn't you?
I need guilty men, Harry.<eos> So, I've found men who ARE guilty. Though not necessarily as charged.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm not long married.<eos> I don't know if you know that. I have a son...<eos> You have debts. To the tune of a thousand pounds.<eos> Why the devil bring that up...?<eos> No-one expects a young gallant like yourself to be thrifty, but these debts are more than you could reasonably pay.<eos> So, your own extravagance gives people to think, what expectations did young Weston have?<eos> We know the Queen gave you money.
Help the King.<eos> Unless he's merciful, there's nothing you can do for yourself.<eos> But you can do something for your daughter.<eos> For Elizabeth.<eos> The more penitent you show yourself through this whole process...<eos> The "process"?<eos> And what is this process to be?<eos> The confessions of the gentlemen are now being compiled. What?<eos> You heard him.<eos> They'll not lie for you.
The more penitent you show yourself through this whole process...<eos> The "process"?<eos> And what is this process to be?<eos> The confessions of the gentlemen are now being compiled. What?<eos> You heard him.<eos> They'll not lie for you.<eos> The gentlemen are to be tried together.<eos> You and your brother, being ennobled, are to be judged by your peers.<eos> You have no witnesses.<eos> When you were at liberty, madam, your ladies were intimidated by you, forced to lie for you.
Having been found unanimously guilty...<eos> Her own uncle! I'll do slaughter!<eos> Thou shalt be burned here, within the Tower.<eos> Or else, to have thy head smitten off... ~ .. as the King's pleasure... ~ That's not justice!<eos> ~ What are you talking about?<eos> ~ What is it?<eos> What? These fellows say I've done it wrong.<eos> They say I have to say "burn" only...<eos> The phrasing is the King's, and don't tell me what we can or can't do, we've never tried a queen before.<eos> Finish what you're saying.
Why does she keep looking up at the tower?<eos> Because she thinks there's still hope.<eos> So, she will not be able to tell me from the other officials.<eos> It will save her alarm.<eos> Good, Christian people... .. I am come hither to die.<eos> For according to the law, and by the law, I am judged to die -<eos> I can't hear her.<eos> You'd think she'd speak up for her last words.<eos> I am come hither to accuse no man... .. nor to speak any thing of that whereof I am accused and condemned to die.<eos> But I pray God save the King... .. and send him long to reign over you.
Ah, it's like I'm back in my mother's womb.<eos> Only, there's food here.<eos> Ugh, those e-cigs are so stupid.<eos> I mean, smoking real cigarettes kills you, but smoking fake ones makes me want to kill you.
My other prison.<eos> Uh, wait, if who had texted you?<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> This guy I slept with didn't text me for two weeks after we had sex, and I left my rings at his place, so I...<eos> You did the two-week rule?<eos> Yeah. But she got the wrong apartment because, knowing her, her eyes were closed the whole time.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so?<eos> We got a two-week rule over here!<eos> Stay right over here.<eos> We'll get you out soon.
Okay.<eos> - Save the camp. Gotta save the camp.<eos> - Save the camp.<eos> A volleyball... - Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Where is Mitch?<eos> We have been looking for him all morning.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Mitch is very close by right now. - Okay.<eos> And he's very excited to say hello to all of you.
- Cool.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sounds pretty sweet.<eos> Makes me feel really special to have a girlfriend that gets me.<eos> You know? Like...<eos> Hey!<eos> Check it out, you guys.<eos> Horns from Israel.<eos> Donna got 'em for us.<eos> Donna gave you those?
And I hope to hell you're good at something else, because you sure as shit are not gonna make it in show business.<eos> So that, to answer your question, is the truth.<eos> What was her question?<eos> I'll take a tin of Skoal and, uh... two combs.<eos> Candy! Yeah!<eos> Candy!<eos> Are you gonna buy anything?<eos> What, old man?<eos> I can't hear you over the music.<eos> He asked you politely if you were going to buy anything.
I'm sorry, Gene.<eos> I feel like if I don't at least explore this thing with Jeff, I might never be at peace.<eos> You understand, right?<eos> If that's what you want...<eos> what you both want, then that's what you should do.<eos> - Thank you, Gene.<eos> - Thanks, buddy.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> Let's get married!<eos> By the power vested in me, I now declare you and you husband and wife.
- Yeah.<eos> Cheers.<eos> There's an empty room over there.<eos> Let's go fill it up, huh?<eos> Uh... Sure.<eos> Oh, hey, you guys.<eos> Hi, Coop. Hi, Gail.<eos> Have you met my husband Jeff?<eos> Or, I mean, my ex-husband.<eos> - Nice to meet you all.
You're right.<eos> Friends don't do those things.<eos> Reporters do.<eos> Every day for the last five years, I've been selling out, lying, sniveling, groveling, backstabbing!<eos> And for what?<eos> To get that one big story.<eos> Well, I got it.<eos> Finally. Right here at Camp Firewood.<eos> But I got something I didn't expect, too.<eos> I got all of you.
Bullshit!<eos> - I know what I saw. - And then we bowed.<eos> - Oh, right! Really? - Then why am I so mad at you?<eos> - You're not.<eos> - I'm not?<eos> - No. - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Silence!<eos> Look at you!
Whenever Louis asks to have drinks with me, the answer's always no.<eos> Listen to the words that I'm saying.<eos> You are getting drinks with Louis tonight.<eos> Fairchild's retiring?<eos> Fairchild's dead.<eos> That's almost as good as the Jordan news.<eos> Eh, not to Fairchild.<eos> Who gives a shit about Fairchild?<eos> The real tragedy is I have to get drinks with Louis.<eos> Which is why I got you a secluded restaurant with a table in the back where no one will see you.
He did.<eos> - See?<eos> Oh, and now you're fighting for him?<eos> Okay, I guess my job here is done.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm taking the car back to the city.<eos> Well, what the hell are we supposed to do?<eos> Ray's waiting on the other side of the parking lot, isn't he?<eos> He'll drive you two back when you're done.
Is this how you wanted to get rid of your father?<eos> Is it?<eos> Hello, love.<eos> I missed you so much!<eos> - There he is!<eos> - Maguila!<eos> - He's a lot bigger, isn't he? - Yeah.<eos> He's really fat.<eos> Mum!<eos> Come here, you two!
We've known the neighbours for ages. Delightful people.<eos> - The land belonged to my grandparents.<eos> - It was all one big estate.<eos> Then we sold it off in lots.<eos> This is the last plot left.<eos> We used to come here and play with our cousins.<eos> How big is the plot?<eos> Well it's about... It's approximately 18 metres wide and 50 metres long.<eos> I love it!<eos> It's perfect for you guys.
You're like family to me, Alex.<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Our only option is to take out a loan. We need further proof that my mother's alive. Otherwise, we won't keep negotiating.<eos> Unless you want to put your mother's life in grave danger, you must accept our terms and the amount we demand.<eos> If you harm my mother, you won't get a cent.<eos> I repeat, we need more...<eos> As usual, we'll honour the club's tradition by winning another championship.<eos> So, you guys need to keep pushing, both on and off the pitch.
- When is the wedding?<eos> - We were thinking Christmas would be fun.<eos> - Maybe New Year's Eve, when the decorations are still up.<eos> - Good idea.<eos> Then you can wake in the New Year with your new life.<eos> Mary.<eos> I know you made it all happen when you rang Bertie and Aunt Rosamund.<eos> I was never convinced it was over.<eos> - But why did you do it?<eos> - It was something Granny said. What a waste it would be for both of you.
I do, I'm coming to the farm.<eos> Then I hope we'll be seeing a lot more of you there, too, Mrs Patmore.<eos> - I don't know about that.<eos> - I think you do.<eos> Oh, we ought to get up for the speeches.<eos> It gives me great pleasure to bring down blessings on the head - of the beautiful Marchioness Of Hexham. - Hear, hear.<eos> But first I should read a telegram from her grandmother, the redoubtable Mrs Levinson.<eos> 'I'm sorry I could not be with you.<eos> Although we pray for those in peril on the sea, I am too old to be one of them.<eos> God bless you both, Grandmama.'
- Previously on Reign...<eos> - The Duke of Guise, your uncle, is<eos> - a dangerously ambitious man.<eos> - I read your letter.<eos> I wrote that letter thinking I'd never see you again.
Not you!<eos> It's not appropriate.<eos> I've got more weight than any of those ladies you're trying to recruit, and it helps with the speed.<eos> No!<eos> Bash, you're here!<eos> How wonderful!<eos> I'm sorry I can't stay.<eos> I have some business with the kingsguard... someone needs replacing.<eos> You're the king's brother.<eos> I thought the whole point of being a royal was to get other people to do things for you.
You want your old position back?<eos> Are you mad?<eos> I was appointed the king's magistrate by Francis, and I took the job seriously, tamping down uprisings across the land.<eos> You ran the minute you heard the word "plague."<eos> And kept the king's order in the east, at great risk to myself.<eos> You fled to save yourself.<eos> And left me, your niece, unguarded.<eos> Can one man conquer a disease?<eos> No.<eos> But I can protect you from those who would harm you.
Look what survived the plague.<eos> I heard you were back to claim your old post.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> - I have a confession to make.<eos> That's not really why I'm here.<eos> I see you're no longer wearing black.<eos> I gave up with that weeks after Henry passed.<eos> I do as I please in my own home.<eos> What I meant is your official mourning period is over.<eos> And I'm here to court you.
I pulled back, thinking that if I could just protect her from feeling one more ounce of pain, then we might...<eos> The damage was done long before.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I... I didn't realize.<eos> All I meant was...<eos> Well, you're the closest thing I have to family, to be honest, and losing that connection hurt, that's all.<eos> But I understand completely.<eos> I do.<eos> Lady Kenna.<eos> I'm glad to see you again.
Well, that was never my intention.<eos> I apologize, truly.<eos> Accepted.<eos> Lord Narcisse.<eos> I was looking forward to seeing you, ever since I heard you lost everything due to your financial misadventures.<eos> How is it you managed to remain at court?<eos> My expertise in many areas is valued by the king.<eos> Not just the king, but thequeen mother, too, I hear.<eos> I'm afraid that friendship won't continue.<eos> - Catherine, aren't you looking...
My father kept it close and read it often.<eos> As did my mother after he died.<eos> Frederic Mazur, my father's valet, poisoned it.<eos> What is this?<eos> Are you making an accusation?<eos> Frederic served under your command in Spain.<eos> He returned to your region after my father died, where he was murdered.<eos> Was he on your orders to poison the king?<eos> So this is why you wanted to keep me in the castle, so you can put me on trial.<eos> We are asking you directly.
I forgive you.<eos> For the sake of your soul and peace between our two nations.<eos> And my brother... will do the same.<eos> Let it be so.<eos> Let our feuds die with our fathers.<eos> Arrest the duke.<eos> There's no need.<eos> Your uncle will never betray anyone or cause you harm again.<eos> Driver, why are we stopping?<eos> Another stout for you?
Kind and generous.<eos> It-it shames me to seek such comfort, to crave human touch, but I do.<eos> I think I can help you.<eos> Or rather I know someone who can help.<eos> She's just upstairs.<eos> Louis, I am so sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> Manipulating me or believing me capable of such deception?<eos> Poisoning your family, then working beside you, fighting beside you.<eos> I needed to keep you here to clear your name, if it could be cleared.

Open to another.<eos> But without you, my heart is closed as tight as a fist.<eos> You've heard, I assume?<eos> About the duke of Guise?<eos> Yes.<eos> Brutal way to die.<eos> Especially as he was innocent.<eos> A ransom befitting a prince.<eos> A bargain.<eos> Considering I warned you that Catherine was circling.

I had to rely on my bankers to unearth the trail that led back to you.<eos> Or rather, the duke of Guise, once the bankers had finished with him.<eos> And the final payment?<eos> The deed you had manufactured from the Duke?<eos> It will bear up under scrutiny?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have an excess of expertise in that area.<eos> After all, how does one acquire so much land to lose?<eos> So, you're clever and grasping.<eos> What's to stop you from blackmailing me?
You poisoned a king and a queen.<eos> And now I've helped you get away with it.<eos> We each hold a noose for the other.<eos> And my gold?<eos> What will you do with that?<eos> Buy back the lands you've lost?<eos> What gold?<eos> I am but a penniless, disgraced lord.<eos> No concern to anyone.<eos> Well, they won't see you coming, will they?
Friends.<eos> Family, as it were.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> That feeling.<eos> Your heart opening alongside his hand.<eos> Isn't it extraordinary?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Mary.<eos> Please, let me speak.<eos> I knew I was taking advantage of you, your regard for me, and you deserve better than that.
Please, let me speak.<eos> I knew I was taking advantage of you, your regard for me, and you deserve better than that.<eos> It's done now.<eos> No need to apologize again.<eos> I am sorry, but I'm not here to apologize.<eos> I'm here to tell you the truth.<eos> Which I suppose I already did.<eos> Even before I even realized it.<eos> When I told you to call things off with Lola.<eos> I didn't want to lose you.
In the eyes of the Church and the world, I am Francis's wife.<eos> And I will never do anything to compromise my duty as queen.<eos> I don't have the same freedom as a man or a king to stray beyond my marriage.<eos> And given what I've been through, I have nothing to offer you, Louis.<eos> I hear you.<eos> I do.<eos> But of all the reasons you expound of why we can't be together, none are of the heart.<eos> I have to fight every instinct I have pulling me toward you.<eos> When I'm near you, I am aware of every breath you take.<eos> And when I'm away, even the wind in the trees reminds me of you.

He moved to Africa, didn't he, Sha?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He had to go to Africa.<eos> ~ He was a good man.<eos> Well, I won't be running off to Africa any time soon.<eos> I don't even know where it is!<eos> So, Mum, Dad, we've got something we'd like to tell you.<eos> Talk to you about.<eos> Lovely news I think will make you very happy and that's... .. we're getting married!
We said we weren't looking things up.<eos> ~ Rob, don't!<eos> ~ PHONE RINGS<eos> ~ Yeah. ~ Er...<eos> Oh, Chris.<eos> Fran found out Chris and I were dating and he wants me to go and talk to her.<eos> That's... you win.<eos> Yes!<eos> BANANAS!<eos> So, if you consider everything that happened in the 14th century, complaining about whether you can find a socket for your iPad charger,
We like to sing.<eos> Together.<eos> About...<eos> - Sports.<eos> - Food.<eos> Sports foods.<eos> That's fun.<eos> It's...<eos> Would you guys...<eos> Would it be putting you on the spot if I asked you to do one? - I think that wouldn't be appropriate.
Yeah, we did not steal your idea.<eos> We copied it from this lame cupcake shop in Brooklyn.<eos> Wait a minute... we have a lame cupcake shop in Brooklyn.<eos> Ashlin, you talk too much.<eos> This is why everyone knows about my lap-band.<eos> I think they know about it because you lost 200 pounds over Spring break.<eos> It's hard to believe she was once twice this obnoxious.<eos> If you don't stop selling our T-shirts, we're gonna have to get our lawyer involved.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna have to get our lawyer involved.<eos> And he's gonna kill you.
Let's go.<eos> They are making a fortune on us.<eos> And if I'm gonna get screwed, it better be by someone over 21<eos> Yeah, that sounds like a job with a two drink minimum.<eos> Han, don't mess this up or you'll be eating those glasses.<eos> Might I interest you in an anti-bullying pamphlet?<eos> Might I interest you in a seat on my finger?<eos> Hey, how did you two get in here?<eos> The school pays guards out front to keep out the homeless.<eos> Yeah, well, jokes on you.
That risk was calculable.<eos> You cannot predict what a wild animal will do.<eos> I'm just gonna reach down, scoop up the snake and then get out.<eos> Limited risk.<eos> I will be fine.<eos> Okay, you have to make sure you don't harm the snake when you retrieve it.<eos> Do you want to change places?<eos> - Hell no. Those things are deadly.<eos> - Okay, kids. If I could have everybody at this window over here.<eos> If everyone stays quiet, I can tell you about the over 40 breeds of venomous snakes that we have here.
Where's he calling from? Oh, God.<eos> Castle?<eos> He's calling from your house.<eos> Where's Alexis?<eos> Dad, what the hell?<eos> You have your passport?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> But, Richard, Europe?<eos> No "buts." I need to know that you're safe.<eos> Now, the... the police are gonna take you to the airport.

Really?<eos> Poor Gemma. Poor Gemma broke up with me, Mom.<eos> Can you blame her?<eos> Might I remind you the entire world will be watching you today? You'll give your quote to Fiona, you'll acknowledge the crowd, and you'll escort me to the car.<eos> And try not to sleep with anyone along the way.<eos> Prince Liam, with heavy hearts we offer our condolences to you as a grieving nation.<eos> One of the great things about my brother was he wasn't afraid to be his own man.<eos> I'll miss him.<eos> My God.<eos> You wretched brats. Your brother, my first-born son, and you can't find the decorum, the civility, to honor his memory.
Okay.<eos> Well, I tried.<eos> There's nothing else I can do, then, except call in the feds.<eos> Mr. Nighthorse!<eos> The bullet went right by my head.<eos> Missed me by less than two feet.<eos> Now, coming, as this did, on the heels of repeated harassment by Sheriff Longmire, it's pretty clear to me that the sheriff was behind the shooting.<eos> Walt Longmire has tried to connect me to several crimes that I had nothing to do with.<eos> So, I'm hopeful that, by shining a light on the activities of his backward, corrupt, and prejudiced Sheriff's Department, we may be able to rein in the worst of their excesses.<eos> But barring that, I just want to say right now if I end up dead in the coming days or weeks, the first person you should look at is your sheriff.
He was busy sewing up Lee.<eos> - So who helped you?<eos> - I did.<eos> Put your gun down and let these men go.<eos> I don't want to shoot you, but I will.<eos> I can set down my gun down.<eos> I can't let these men go.<eos> Look, just take his gun and leave.<eos> We agreed nobody else gets hurt.<eos> I'm not leaving you behind.
My deputy just ran your credit cards.<eos> You had a recent purchase from a nearby Walmart hours before the body was found.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, baby, say something.<eos> Tell him there is no way I could ever kill Delia.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You're hurting her.<eos> You stay out of it.<eos> This trip, this entire wedding has been nothing but the two of you.
I can't keep my eyes off them.<eos> I hope he hits her.<eos> And then the cops taze him and he falls in the river.<eos> Now you're talking.<eos> If we ever sound like that please get a gun from America and shoot us both.<eos> ~ We sound like that all the time.<eos> ~ Do we?<eos> Yeah, but we've got real problems.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> I've been at Frye and Loeb for 11 years, and you're going to fire me for making you a shitload of money ~ and opening a UK office?
Are you crazy?<eos> - Listen to me!<eos> Nobody gets out.<eos> - Should all know that we raped her?<eos> - Are you going to kill her for it?<eos> - She was dead.<eos> - She's alive!<eos> You know now!<eos> - Think a little on us.<eos> - Should I think of you?
George is the only way to get Hathorne to back down.<eos> And evoking his name is not enough anymore.<eos> Then what is?<eos> Worry not.<eos> I have it under control.<eos> This town is but the living form of my orrery, and both run like clockwork.<eos> No man can stop the hours ringing in the changes.<eos> Clocks are often stopped, Mistress.<eos> It takes but a well-placed finger.<eos> I fear the boy has been a distraction to you.

Well, in not drawing attention, Mr. Corwin, you have drawn a line.<eos> I must know which side you stand.<eos> Yours, my lady.<eos> You know I've been your silent servant all these years.<eos> Well, you shall be silent no more.<eos> The role of magistrate cannot fall to an un-sympathetic foe.<eos> It must be a witch.<eos> That is why you are to challenge Hathorne as candidate.<eos> But he is most popular with the other selectmen.<eos> With Mr. Sibley's endorsement, no selectman will dare vote against you.
But he is most popular with the other selectmen.<eos> With Mr. Sibley's endorsement, no selectman will dare vote against you.<eos> We are vulnerable.<eos> You have brought our kind to the center of the stage when we are hated most.<eos> I have completed the Grand Rite.<eos> The consecration is well underway.<eos> Soon we will taste freedom like you have never known before.<eos> But for now, we must continue the charade of puritan rule.<eos> And we must control it.<eos> I fear I will disappoint you.
What else but an Angel would risk all in a horrible place like this to sit vigil with a wretch like myself?<eos> Believe me, Isaac, I am not going anywhere.<eos> I will stay by your side.<eos> These past few days, Cotton, it's been such a comfort being with you.<eos> I must admit, when I first opened my door in Boston, the sight of your face brought me greater joy than I would have expected.<eos> It is you, Anne, who has been a great comfort to me.<eos> I believe my father died thinking his only child was consumed with hatred for him.<eos> Never.<eos> He admired your spirit.<eos> He was proud of you.
Life with him has been both a pain and a constant temptation to hell.<eos> But I'm not convinced God intended it so.<eos> Your friend Isaac improves, and with him, the chance to save many.<eos> Now, the blood I drew from him could be used to guard the unaffected.<eos> You would spread his infectious blood.<eos> Curious.<eos> But if it helps others, that is indeed good news.<eos> Why, you must seek more than good news to risk so much coming here, where no one willingly enters and few leave alive.<eos> No, it is you who are the risk to me.<eos> You operate here under my approval, yet they call you "necromancer" and "speak of corpse bothering".
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me a moment.<eos> Of course.<eos> Corwin is nowhere to be found.<eos> George will have no choice but to put Hathorne forward if Corwin is absent.<eos> So we must drag his cowardly feet from the hole they are hiding in.<eos> Cotton Mather was right.<eos> Bind a witch with the right knot to iron and dead wood, he's as neutered as a freshly cut steer.<eos> You are gravely mistaken. I am no witch.<eos> Bullshit, Corwin.<eos> I stabbed thin air, and then I caught you.
This is your fault!<eos> You had to take us off the trail.<eos> You had to see that damn waterfall!<eos> I thought I knew where I was going.<eos> Oh, well, a lot of good that does us now, huh?<eos> Day and a half with no water, food or cell reception.<eos> And the kids are terrified.<eos> And you two aren't helping.<eos> Let's just keep moving and try to get back to a road.<eos> We'll get you out of here.
My guys survived.<eos> Here, Fiddler's Basin.<eos> Only viable evac point.<eos> Three miles from the crash site.<eos> That's where we land. Not in this wind. At 55 knots, everything is grounded.<eos> Transport helo can handle it.<eos> County doesn't have one.<eos> Then I'm reaching out to Pendleton.<eos> There's no way I'm leaving my guys down there!<eos> Hikers, we're here to rescue you!
Hey.<eos> Heard you guys are lost.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. How come he always gets the hug?<eos> I'm standing right next to him.<eos> Are you guys with the Forestry Service?<eos> No, no. We're here with the government;<eos> we're here to bring you home.

We're here with the government;<eos> we're here to bring you home.<eos> How?<eos> Well, we're gonna take you to a nearby clearing;
Don't scream.<eos> Pray... out loud.<eos> Something that will appeal to His Majesty's piety and sense of honour.<eos> I'll get my prayer book.<eos> I'm sure I can find something that will fit the bill.<eos> Thomas Cromwell, Secretary to the King.<eos> Show your colours!<eos> Tell him to let us in, before I show his arse my boot.<eos> Well... .. how do I look?<eos> That's why he sent you, isn't it? To see if I really am dying?
It's as if my daughter had never been born.<eos> As if Katherine was still Queen.<eos> As if I didn't exist.<eos> I won't let them make a royal match for Mary.<eos> I want you to visit her.<eos> Take one of your handsome young men with you.<eos> She's never had a compliment in her life - it shouldn't be hard to seduce her.<eos> You want me to compromise her?<eos> Do it yourself, if you want.<eos> I heard she liked you.
Second, she was in no danger.<eos> Third, I don't know who lit the candle.<eos> Four, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> Five, no-one will tell you either.<eos> If, as it may happen, some person visits the Queen after the lights are out... .. then it is an event over which we should draw a veil.<eos> Some person? Some person, for the purposes of arson?<eos> Or the purposes of something else?<eos> Lady Rochford...<eos> Jane, when the time comes to unburden your conscience, don't go to a priest.<eos> He'll give you penance. I'll give you a reward.
I hear you're leaving us for France?<eos> We shall miss you.<eos> I went down to Putney... .. or to be accurate, I sent a servant.<eos> You've killed a man. Not in this jurisdiction.<eos> Do your worst, Stephen.<eos> Put your men on the road, lay out money, search Europe...<eos> You'll not find any talent I possess that England cannot use.<eos> That lad you knifed in Putney died.<eos> You did well to run, Cromwell.<eos> The family had a noose for you.
God preserve Your Majesty.<eos> And now... .. will you excuse me?<eos> Cross your wrists.<eos> Like this.<eos> Get it in the water.<eos> Keep your wrists crossed.<eos> Confuses the pain.<eos> I trust a lesson has been learnt?<eos> You are not a gentleman born.<eos> You should not meddle in affairs of those set above you.
His Majesty may be pleased to bring you into his presence...<eos> Come, Wolsey!<eos> We're fetching you to Hell, where Beelzebub is expecting you to supper!<eos> But you should always remember who it was that placed you where he could see you.<eos> From now on, remember who you serve.<eos> I shall profit from this lesson...<eos> I assure you, sir.<eos> See you do.<eos> And so... Majesty, if it please you...<eos> Look favourably on the Emperor's overtures... .. we beg you.
I'd feed him... bathe him... and, of course, there was endless magical lovemaking.<eos> Then, a few days ago, the unthinkable happened.<eos> Somehow, he managed to make a rope out of his bowling shirts and ran away, disappearing into the darkness.<eos> Th-Th-Th-That's all, folks.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ Charlie escaped?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Prisoners escape.<eos> Lovers run away because they're afraid of commitment.<eos> Any-who, I just thought I should tell you.<eos> You know, in case he drops by and guts you all like fish.
What does it say?<eos> "You despicable troll.<eos> "You thought you could replace my ninja awesomeness, "you lame clown?<eos> "I will deploy my army of assassins to destroy you.<eos> "I will bring my bayonets of truth "to the hexagon of death, "where I will carve my initials into your reptilian skull and cover you in tiger's blood."<eos> Hard to believe he wrote children's songs, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, we're gonna need some help.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna need a lot of help.<eos> Here, try these.<eos> They won't keep him from hurting you, but they will keep you from feeling it.
There are thousands of dancers.<eos> Mom!<eos> Dancers!<eos> When I was sure you were OK I left.<eos> But my mind was on you.<eos> You're better, huh?<eos> This vile smell must be coming from me.<eos> Where in hell is the nightdress from?<eos> It's Mom's.<eos> So, that's how you were destined to meet again, Sinan.
How?<eos> Did you text him?<eos> Of course.<eos> I suspect it was the tackiest message ever.<eos> Were you drunk or sober at the time?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I see.<eos> You know where he lives?<eos> Sure. He's lived in the same place for years.<eos> But wait, how long have you known him?
Odile, please.<eos> Are we ready now?<eos> Evelyne, your hair.<eos> Is this better, Daddy dear?<eos> Marianne, please, look at the camera.<eos> Great.<eos> Now don't move.<eos> What's wrong now?<eos> Come on, Daddy. It doesn't matter.<eos> What if I painted you instead?
I'm so bored!<eos> Sundays are deadly dull.<eos> Especially when you don't work.<eos> You won't laugh when we're broke.<eos> Why do you always talk about the worst?<eos> Because I'm the only one who's realistic.<eos> But we still have a good life.<eos> We'll have to sell Dad's paintings soon.<eos> And it won't help much.<eos> We'll marry you off then.
Now.<eos> You barricade that door behind me once I leave.<eos> Do you know how to shoot a gun?<eos> Stand here.<eos> Finger here.<eos> Aim there.<eos> One of them comes through that door, you squeeze and you don't stop till they're on the ground.<eos> How did you learn how to do that?<eos> From a cheese maker.<eos> We're freeing you.
- Here.<eos> - I--<eos> I'm not very good with guns. I--<eos> Me neither.<eos> You.<eos> You live here?<eos> Leave.<eos> My people have guns.<eos> Yours don't.<eos> They may be aiming rifles at you right now.
Master Francis is the winner.<eos> Father, this is ridiculous. You must call this off.<eos> You know as well as I do there is no calling it off.<eos> Get on with it.<eos> If that hammer falls on an empty chamber you'll be dead before you hit the ground.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Earl.<eos> Someone should have put you out of your misery generations ago.<eos> Oh, my God. What are the odds?<eos> I'll leave the three of you to your own misery.
"Gentle man, 46, "looking for young woman who likes the countryside"<eos> "Hello, Paul, I'm Annette.<eos> "I live in a small town in the North with my son.<eos> "I'm 38. I don't know if that's still young."<eos> The Ad<eos> I messed up because you left me.<eos> I'm thinking here, and I know that's why.<eos> I've stopped drinking, Annette.<eos> No more cock-ups.<eos> I had to, to understand, but now, without you, I'm lost.
Not for you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When we know we'll see each other, it's not as long.<eos> And it's not easy in winter. This summer,<eos> I'll have less work with the animals at pasture.<eos> Winter doesn't scare me.<eos> What does is the time not seeing each other.<eos> Do you want to come now?<eos> It's silly, but... I'd imagined spending Christmas together.<eos> Actually, I've thought about that too, being with you and your kid, but it's better in summer for you. Winter is too harsh.
Ask them to see you to your door.<eos> - Is there news from Didier?<eos> - Yes, he's out.<eos> I hope he won't go to see you.<eos> - He wouldn't dare.<eos> How are you?<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> Well.<eos> Love you, Mum.<eos> Love you.
I couldn't buy a new one.<eos> - May I leave? - Yes.<eos> I can't cook well.<eos> It's not the cooker.<eos> I can't drive well either.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We shouldn't have come now.<eos> - I know we're in the way.<eos> - You're not.<eos> I told you, it's not easy in winter here, and I can't be around much.
I shouldn't have come to Nevers the second time.<eos> What do you want, Annette?<eos> I didn't mean what I said last night.<eos> I can explain.<eos> I've never really liked explanations.<eos> It's hard, not talking.<eos> You should have talked before.<eos> Can you take us to the coach tomorrow?<eos> It goes through Condat to Clermont.<eos> I can take you to the bloody station!
(laughs) A little, uh... little visor humor.<eos> Give me back my hat!<eos> I'm kidding. (chuckles)<eos> I wasn't gonna hit you.<eos> I'm just joshing.<eos> Just Joshua, Joshua, joshing...<eos> Do you ladies want to join my network?<eos> Uh, you ladies can just go ahead and play through. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll catch up with you later.
(laughs) You lied and said you were a stripper;<eos> it seems like the fair thing to do.<eos> (dance music playing) Just in front of all these people?<eos> In front of your colleagues?<eos> (man whoops)<eos> Oh, okay. I hear some "whoos!"<eos> (whoops) You ain't got no Ginuwine or nothing?<eos> Seriously though, I'm...<eos> I'm... I really am a police officer.<eos> It's... I can't really be here stripping for... you!
- Shush, Marty.<eos> ...a thing or two about -- Wait, what?<eos> Was the house -- when we pulled up,<eos> I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.<eos> Negative visualization, Jerry.<eos> Explains a lot about where you're at.<eos> - Hi, sweetie.<eos> - Hi, dad.<eos> Summer, Morty, are you okay?<eos> We -- we just missed you a lot.

Oh, no. What did you guys just do? - What did who do?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Wait, what am I saying?<eos> - [ burps ] Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?<eos> Oh, man, I don't feel good.<eos> - Am I me?<eos> - Am I talking right now?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Wait, who said that?<eos> All right, both of you just don't move.
[ Sighs ] We don't have time for this, okay?<eos> I need anaesthetic and deer saline.<eos> Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm.<eos> Except when sterilizing, aborting, or euthanizing them, or also when eating them at also any meal.<eos> I'm calling my lawyer.<eos> I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.<eos> In your dreams, bitch.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical, bird-brained homunculi.<eos> And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical.
!<eos> - don't you get it? !<eos> The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore.<eos> He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me.<eos> He probably figures it's [belches] easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them.<eos> [ laughs ] I have to admit, it was always in the back of my mind, too.<eos> The difference is I would never do it, until now.<eos> Rick, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Saving our lives!<eos> After he takes me out, he's -- he's gonna be coming for you.
Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this?<eos> How you think you gonna move time while you're standing in it, you dumbass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies?<eos> Oh, way to go, Rick.<eos> Yeah, Grandpa, way to go.<eos> What, you're just gonna listen to this guy now?<eos> He's got a giant testicle for a head.<eos> He came here in a bubble.<eos> For all we know, he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsackland.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time.
They're really embarrassing.<eos> Well, since you're going to time prison, I'd say you can keep them on forever.<eos> - Time prison?<eos> - Yeah. Well, I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way your dumbass assin' ass asses could ever have one is if it was stolen.<eos> You stole a time-freezing crystal from testicle monsters?<eos> ! I would've been happy to pay for it, s-- [burps] Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco.<eos> Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here.<eos> Get him!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> You better keep back! Man, this will turn your ass into a third-trimester fetus from 30 yards.
Look at me.<eos> Did you doubt it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then we have established one thing only.<eos> What?<eos> You are not... a good doctor.<eos> Pity...<eos> I had hoped to see the sun one last time... .. with the eyes of my true self.<eos> Oh, hello!<eos> Look at you all, with your nice, shiny domes. Oh!
You're my secret favourite.<eos> Don't tell the others.<eos> You are an enemy of the Daleks.<eos> Yes, well, anyone who's not a Dalek is an enemy of the Daleks, so that was an easy guess.<eos> You will be exterminated.<eos> Please.<eos> Please do, because I have been on my feet all day.<eos> But before you get all exterminate-y ... two things.<eos> One, I want to see Davros.<eos> Two, I have a lovely little gift for you all, if you take me to him right now.
No!<eos> No, please! No!<eos> You have opened your veins of your own free will, and all Daleks shall drink the blood of Gallifrey.<eos> They shall rise stronger than ever.<eos> Where is Clara Oswald?<eos> You will tell us!<eos> You will tell us!<eos> You will tell us...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Was I, um... Was I boring you?
Doctor, you must help me.<eos> Can I just say, it's been an absolute pleasure to finally meet you?<eos> Doctor!<eos> My vision is impaired.<eos> I cannot see.<eos> Alert.<eos> I cannot control.<eos> - Doctor!<eos> - This city is about to be sucked into the ground.<eos> Your own sewer is about to consume you.
And I've got homework. Later.<eos> Hey!<eos> Your stuff!<eos> Whatever.<eos> The young guy!<eos> - Look what he sent me.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Not at all!<eos> What's up? What were you discussing?
Artus?<eos> Isn't he interesting?<eos> I mean he's got something, doesn't he?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> If you think shaking your hair and an open blouse is pianistic expression, You're wrong, my little girl.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You've gone mad, poor girl!<eos> You thought he'd be here?<eos> He was!<eos> Can I give drop you off?
Alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Jesus Christ, Scarlett.<eos> Jesus Christ, you can't do that to us!<eos> I'm sorry, Mommy.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Mom, I pretended to go to the bathroom and then climbed out the window.<eos> I know the police guy couldn't go in there.<eos> I wanted to see if it was really him.<eos> I wanted to surprise you.
This, this isn't happening!<eos> I'm afraid we've lost our detective.<eos> I thought he would appreciate this dark evil, given the line of work he's in.<eos> But John is clearly not yet our kind.<eos> Forget him. I want to drink.<eos> To the master!<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> Thank you all for being here on Devil's Night, but it is I who should be the one celebrating you.<eos> I look around and I see the definition of American success.<eos> They write books about you. Make movies of your life.

Make movies of your life.<eos> Johnny Depp likes my paintings!<eos> Years after your death, people continue to be enthralled.<eos> You've made your mark in history.<eos> Like the Iliad, your stories will live on forever.<eos> I consider you all my equals.
You're gonna be stronger and feel better than you've ever felt.<eos> Jimmy?<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> Let's get you to the nurse.<eos> Where's Mrs. Pritchard?<eos> What?<eos> Mrs. Pritchard!<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Drink. It'll make you feel awesome.
It can't be true.<eos> You died.<eos> And am... reborn.<eos> The body in that crypt isn't Rudy.<eos> It's my stunt double, George Fiske.<eos> - Always so loyal. - Even in death.<eos> Though to be clear, I did do most of my own stunts.<eos> Just not this one.<eos> You faked your death? !<eos> I loved you both.
You don't need a doctor.<eos> You have to drink the blood.<eos> That's how you get better.<eos> He's a fresh one, Madeline.<eos> Not like the homeless guy.<eos> He tastes good.<eos> You killed the homeless man?<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> The police are gonna find you.
Fix her! ALEX: I can't stop.<eos> (Maddie sobbing)<eos> Kimmy, come on.<eos> ALEX: Come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> Help her!<eos> It's too late for Kimmy. MADDIE (crying):<eos> Come on.<eos> It doesn't have to be too late for the rest of you.
You mean like that woman who sucked me dry in the hallway.<eos> You're a lot smarter dead than you ever were alive.<eos> Try and keep it that way.<eos> (grunts) Why don't you go visit our son?<eos> We wouldn't want anything to upset him.<eos> Tell him we decided not to honeymoon in Paris after all.<eos> I advised you not to kill him on the premises.<eos> Bite me.<eos> There's a room at the end of the hall.<eos> It's ready for you.
Kanima.<eos> Hey, Deaton, how the hell did she get through the Mountain Ash? I don't know.<eos> It's a barrier no supernatural creature should be able to cross.<eos> Scott did it.<eos> Once, but it almost killed me.<eos> We should've killed her.<eos> Meanwhile, she's probably on her way to killing someone else.<eos> Listen, everyone.<eos> We need to concentrate.<eos> Scott and Malia, you two will probably be able to move long before Stiles and I can.
- You have it coming.<eos> - Girls.<eos> Mm. Everything okay?<eos> Uh, yeah. I just got a text from Sherlock.<eos> He just found a suspect in this case we're working.<eos> Kind of can't let this go.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Bummer.<eos> I'll call you guys later, okay?
If you know about the party, you know I can't say anything.<eos> It's easy to talk tough, Daniel...<eos> But I'm a professional at causing pain, and you're an amateur at taking it, so let's cut to the chase.<eos> Who's hosting the party?<eos> I've only heard a first name...<eos> Eliza.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> These people, you do not want their attention.<eos> Oh, but that's exactly what I want, Daniel.<eos> Penny: Now both of you, get undressed.
It was the one thing that unified every single living creature in the universe, and now it's gone!<eos> How can you just sit there? !<eos> Don't you want to go out there right now, wrestle them to the ground and ask them questions until your throat falls out?<eos> What's death like?<eos> Does it hurt? Do you still get hungry?<eos> Do you miss being alive?<eos> Why can you only handle metal objects?<eos> Oh, I didn't know I'd noticed that.<eos> OK...<eos> So, they'll try to kill you, blah, blah, blah.
But you should know what it is that you're leaving.<eos> Cass says we should go, but everything that happens here is her responsibility now, so she's going to stay.<eos> So I, uh... guess I should too.<eos> Well, count me in.<eos> Who wants to live forever, anyway?<eos> Sorry, um... have you gone insane?<eos> We can go home.<eos> They're ghosts, though.<eos> How can they be ghosts?<eos> Well, at least if I die, you know I really will come back and haunt you... all.
Cass says, close the internal flood doors.<eos> That'll contain the water in the central corridor.<eos> - Where's the Tardis?<eos> - On the other side.<eos> We need to get there.<eos> It's our only way out. OK.<eos> We've got 30 seconds before the flood doors close.<eos> Come on!<eos> Doctor!<eos> I'll get you and the others out.
Doctor!<eos> I'll get you and the others out.<eos> Sit tight, I'll come back for you.<eos> Just come over here in the Tardis now.<eos> The Tardis won't go there, it won't go near the ghosts.<eos> You can't just leave us!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm going back in time to when this spaceship landed.<eos> If I can understand why this is happening, I can stop them killing anyone else.<eos> I can save you.
I'm not gonna apologize; I'm gonna grovel.<eos> Sylvester: Understood, but still there's a high likelihood That she will throw something at you.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Peace offering.<eos> These chocolates have nuts.<eos> Get it? Nuts?<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> I don't have any feelings, And even I'm uncomfortable watching this.<eos> John 8:32. "the truth will set you free." The truth is I'm an idiot.
They have cars from this decade, Not to mention semiautomatic weapons.<eos> I heard over the comms, They got 44 rounds off in a matter of seconds.<eos> 48 rounds.<eos> I heard them ricochet off the hood.<eos> Well, uh, Since we have a-a break from action,<eos> Walter wanted me to talk to you. Nothing to talk about.<eos> The doc is dead to me.<eos> I know You probably feel like people let you down your whole life. But I-I think you should give toby another chance.<eos> I guarantee that's not what walter wanted you to say to me.<eos> He wants you to get along, and I think you can.
The transmitter from the radio station?<eos> I can use it to amplify the tones for the device.<eos> Is my daughter in there?<eos> The thing that-that came out of the cocoon, I think that is your baby.<eos> It's you.<eos> You have your father's eyes.<eos> I'm the queen now.<eos> This isn't our home anymore.<eos> Our freedom awaits us on the other side of the dome.<eos> And I will guide you to it.

You have your father's eyes.<eos> I'm the queen now.<eos> This isn't our home anymore.<eos> Our freedom awaits us on the other side of the dome.<eos> And I will guide you to it.<eos> That's why I've called you here.<eos> Christine's reign is over.<eos> She fulfilled her purpose to create a new, stronger queen.<eos> Me.<eos> I am here to lead you, our kinship, out of the dome to prevent the extinction of our species.
Now do you understand?<eos> I'm better than you.<eos> Over here.<eos> How many guns do you own?<eos> Never counted.<eos> As usual, Red, you're asking the wrong question.<eos> It's not how many guns it'll take to stop the kinship, but how many bullets I'm gonna put in the new queen's head.<eos> We should head to Willow's Clearing.<eos> That's where Dawn said they were taking the amethysts.<eos> I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Will it work?<eos> Whatever you're gonna do with the amethysts, the microphones are picking up the sound.<eos> I'm using shortwave to send the signals back to the radio station.<eos> - Yeah, in other words, we're out of here.<eos> - You're not going anywhere.<eos> Well, we have to go back to make sure the transmitter doesn't overheat.<eos> Yeah, 'cause if it crashes, we're all as good as dead, so move.<eos> I need both of you here, especially you.<eos> That wasn't part of our deal.<eos> Our deal was for you to help bring about the dome's destruction, and that's exactly why I can't let you leave just yet.
It's a gift from the Turkish ambassador.<eos> Can see the White House from here.<eos> Not bad for a first-year congressman, huh?<eos> Heard it was a landslide.<eos> Well, everybody loves a hero.<eos> Yeah, well, you're no hero.<eos> I don't care how many files she deleted.<eos> Well, my constituents might beg to differ.<eos> I think you know my chief of staff.<eos> Julia, Barbie... good to see you.
It's John Legend, "All of me cuffed all of you."<eos> No.<eos> Wait a minute. Are... are you guys talking about the policeman's benevolent fundraiser?<eos> Yeah, the talent competition is on Friday night, but he won't tell me what he and Espo are doing.<eos> So, how are you guys even gonna top the "Dirty Dancing" lift scene from last year?<eos> Ah. "Crime of our lives." Classic Espo/Ryan.<eos> No, rest assured, as two-time champs, whatever we do is gonna blow the rest of the field away.<eos> Well, that's only because, not being a cop, I'm ineligible.<eos> But if Beckett and I were competing, you'd be out a trophy.<eos> Oh, yeah. We'd so take you down.
Anyone in Richie's life that disappeared?<eos> Well, we've looked into every disappearance and break-in in the tri-state area.<eos> So far, no connection to any one of them and Richie.<eos> And I, uh, checked with known associates, clients, people he was suing.<eos> They're all accounted for.<eos> Yeah. Well, somebody was in that bag, so let's dig deeper.<eos> - Yeah. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh. And, uh, you can lose the limp. We saw you rehearsing.<eos> If I might add, it's no "I've had the crime of my life."<eos> Well... It's still good enough to take the both of you down.
You're as naive as h was.<eos> Let's go, Hammer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's slammer time.<eos> Hey!<eos> Look who decided to show up.<eos> Where were you guys?<eos> You missed the competition.<eos> Yeah. Sorry, you guys. We got held up giving a statement at NTSB.<eos> But you'll be happy to know they're launching a full investigation of Modesto Motors.
You missed the competition.<eos> Yeah. Sorry, you guys. We got held up giving a statement at NTSB.<eos> But you'll be happy to know they're launching a full investigation of Modesto Motors.<eos> Well, looks like Pitbull's gonna get what he wanted... justice for all the victims of that defect.<eos> Yeah. What about you gentlemen?<eos> Did you get what you wanted at the show?<eos> Well, um, let's put it this way... we are no longer two-time champs.<eos> Three years in a row, baby!<eos> Whoo!<eos> That's awesome! Oh, I'm so happy for you guys.
Ohh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. That's very big of you.<eos> Especially considering we would have kicked your asses.<eos> Now, you gonna talk smack?<eos> Well, then we are gonna settle this... Right here, right now.<eos> Why don't we just clear all these desks, go head-to-head, let the precinct decide?<eos> No. You want bragging rights?<eos> They're yours.<eos> Our routine's too good for you, anyway.
Well, even my gift has its limits.<eos> Was it your gift... or your medicine that healed me?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Does it matter that much to you how?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Was I awake when you healed me?<eos> I saw my wound, Delphine.<eos> I should have died.<eos> Do you wish you had?<eos> You didn't when I found you.
You don't know the answers, do you?<eos> Knowing a husband's well-being... that's a wife's job.<eos> And you have chosen<eos> - not to be a wife to my son.<eos> - Catherine...<eos> Where were you last night, Mary, when the king collapsed?<eos> I was away from the castle to...<eos> I know about you and Condé.<eos> Do you know what told me that your infidelity was fact and not rumor?<eos> The look of pain on my son's face when he lied for you.
Rumors of the king's health have started to spread through the castle.<eos> If news of his condition should fall into the wrong hands...<eos> The throne room is full of potential threats... lords, diplomats, all waiting for Francis.<eos> I'm afraid I can't hide the truth from my face.<eos> - Catherine, wait.<eos> - Don't!<eos> Please listen.<eos> We may never know what caused Francis's illness.<eos> If I'm as responsible as you say, I will never forgive myself.<eos> So let me do this one thing for you.
So if there isn't anything terribly pressing... ?<eos> - No, Your Highness.<eos> - No.<eos> No, Your Majesty.<eos> Well, I will let you know when the king is back.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> That was a fine performance.<eos> I don't doubt your concern for your husband is real.<eos> Pity I can't say the same for your lover.<eos> If Francis dies, Condé could marry you.
I've heard what is happening in Scotland, and while I sympathize with your situation, I'm aware of what you must be considering, sending French troops. I don't like it.<eos> Think about your allies in Scotland.<eos> Why should I stand by while you steal my son's army to run off with your Bourbon prince?<eos> Elizabeth is building a Protestant campaign to take over Scotland; France could be next.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> I am trying to save my country!<eos> Your country is all but lost!<eos> Do not drag us down with you!<eos> I understand that you want to get as far away from here as possible, but I won't let this happen to France, to you.<eos> You may have the authority, I will move heaven and earth to stop you.

A face kissed by the Devil.<eos> My God.<eos> Clarissa.<eos> I'm not a witch!<eos> I'm not a witch, please!<eos> Bash!<eos> Bash, you know me!<eos> - Please help me.<eos> - Beat the evil from her!<eos> - Please! I beg you!
With our combined forces, we might have enough men to overtake the rebels.<eos> And why didn't you mention this Renaude to me before?<eos> Because he used to serve Narcisse, and rumor has it he still does.<eos> If you want those men, you'll have to go through Narcisse.<eos> I still don't understand why we keep circling this dreary village.<eos> We've been to the jeweler and the dressmaker.<eos> I'm just looking for that tapestry shop.<eos> We've passed it.<eos> Why are you deliberately wasting my time?<eos> Mother asked you to, didn't she?
You're here?<eos> Fancy a turn with me?<eos> A wha... ?<eos> A dance, you dirty bird.<eos> Hands off, I'm a princess.<eos> Well, a princess has no business in a house of ill repute.<eos> You're such a prude.<eos> Nice to see you again, Leith.<eos> Looking fine, soldier boy.<eos> Oh, they know you.
You don't have to be alone in this.<eos> You have my loyalty.<eos> And my protection.<eos> Protection?<eos> Mary has ordered that I deliver a private army to her.<eos> A general named Renaude... he's a friend of mine.<eos> I've summoned him.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Last night, you told me that you were afraid of what would happen to you if Francis dies.<eos> Of your enemies descending upon you and your young children.

I can't think about this now.<eos> Well, you need to, because you were right.<eos> If you become regent, your enemies will move against you.<eos> But even if Mary takes Renaude's forces to Scotland,<eos> I still have the French army here.<eos> Most of whom you can trust, but not all.<eos> When a crown changes heads, power shifts.<eos> Nothing is certain, and no one is safe.<eos> You and your sons will need extra protection.<eos> Renaude's army should be for you, Catherine, not Mary.

The woods between here and the castle are well-patrolled.<eos> As it happens, I have other reasons for not riding on with you.<eos> I'm not headed where you are anymore.<eos> Oh.<eos> I suppose that is somewhat honorable.<eos> Unless of course I am savagely murdered here in these woods.<eos> Enjoy your reunion with your husband.<eos> I'm sure he will.<eos> Is this wine from the castle?<eos> It's to relax you.
The victim didn't just tumble down the stairs.<eos> He rolled in a curved trajectory.<eos> So we're looking for a grand staircase like the one in the victim's house.<eos> But with steps made from something harder than wood.<eos> The bank where Darius worked!<eos> The-the, the staircase is made out of marble and it's curved.<eos> Would that cause the injuries?<eos> Well, yes. Yes. I'll do the calculations and send you the measurements to match.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was just watching you guys in my office.
And we don't know what's out there.<eos> You know, maybe you should... Maybe you should stay here.<eos> So you wanna bench me again?<eos> Hmmph.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I'll stay and babysit... but if anything happens, anything at all--<eos> Yeah, we'll call you.<eos> No fighting.<eos> Yeah, tell her that.<eos> Both of you.
I prefer to think of myself as a gourmand.<eos> I make heaven a place on earth.<eos> Keeps me alive and hidden from the rest of the failures... that call themselves angels.<eos> Uh.<eos> Oh, they are failures?<eos> Yeah, because you're living so large on your own, right?<eos> There were hundreds of us.<eos> But now...<eos> Each of our names inscribed on our swords.<eos> A brotherhood of perfectly crafted engineered beings... sent to protect you pathetic, bottom-feeding disasters.
Yeah.<eos> So, it's true.<eos> You have the Mark of Cain.<eos> My sympathies.<eos> That's why you wanted the book -- to remove it.<eos> We wanted the book because that's where your power comes from.<eos> See, our family business is putting guys like you out of business.<eos> Oh.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> Let me tell you about my family business.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> What does the book do?<eos> It triggers the memory centers of the brain.<eos> If you've seen them, if they've done something to you...<eos> Then the book will help you remember.
They're in the school.<eos> Scott?<eos> Malia?<eos> We are on a frequency you can't possibly imagine.<eos> The body...<eos> The body's gone.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> Liam said pain... He said it makes you human.
One of them had a nasty looking cut just like that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Black is okay.<eos> It's only really over when you start bleeding other stuff.<eos> When it starts turning silver...<eos> Mercury.<eos> That's when they know you're really a failure.<eos> How many more failures are there supposed to be?<eos> Who knows?<eos> But doesn't it make you wonder what the success is going to look like?
I'm okay.<eos> Really, I think I'm okay.<eos> I saw the needle go in, and her eyes just filled up with mercury.<eos> They turned completely silver.<eos> She looks okay.<eos> Maybe she'll heal.<eos> Or maybe she won't.<eos> What if something's happening to her on the inside?<eos> Get them to the Animal Clinic.<eos> I'll meet you there.
Hey, you're hurting her.<eos> And you're hurting me.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Hey, guys...<eos> Remember, we're here to save a life.<eos> Not kill each other.<eos> It's the full moon.<eos> We can feel it even during the day.<eos> And it's a Supermoon.<eos> What is that supposed to make you guys, like super strong?
So, you've been in Central City for six months.<eos> Why haven't you come to see us before?<eos> I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.<eos> I didn't know who you all were.<eos> Took me that long to piece it all together.<eos> So that's how you know our names.<eos> You've been following us.<eos> Look, I know how this sounds.<eos> The existence of another earth, you, another Flash, it all came as an unexpected shock to me, too.<eos> I just wish there was something I could do to convince you.
But, of course, there isn't just one breach.<eos> There's 52 of them scattered throughout the city.<eos> These breaches are pockets of time and space folded into and upon itself.<eos> But the most significant breach of all appears to be this one.<eos> And where exactly is that located?<eos> It's here, inside S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> And just beyond that breach is an entirely diff... fferent...<eos> Professor?<eos> Professor!<eos> I'd like to personally welcome you to the Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories, or, as it's more commonly known, S.T.A.R. Labs.
No.<eos> You are wiser and stronger.<eos> Remember that strength that so many have tried to take from you.<eos> It is in you still, my friend, my queen.<eos> Go.<eos> And if Condé can aid you on your journey, forgive him, keep him at your side.<eos> I had a visitor to my chambers this morning.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> It was unannounced and not the first of its kind.<eos> Mm. She comes to me to annoy you.
I will use Elizabeth's envoy, Lord Burgess, to get the information I need to sail home safely.<eos> But I will need your help getting it from him.<eos> Helping you means betraying the queen of England.<eos> All for a woman who doesn't know if she wants to be with me, who may not even take me with her.<eos> I love you, Mary.<eos> I'll do anything to prove my loyalty, but I need you to be very clear about what it is you're asking of me.<eos> Where can I find the envoy?<eos> Who's there?<eos> A friend.<eos> Your brother, the king, can't protect you now.
Uh, you don't want a guard, you want...<eos> A babysitter?<eos> ! I've just been informed I'm no longer allowed outside the castle, or anywhere really, without a personal guard.<eos> By order of the queen mother.<eos> When will you stop trying to control me?<eos> When you stop behaving like you need to be controlled.<eos> It's not going to work.<eos> I don't care what ogre you've entrusted this ridiculous job to...<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I'll leave you two to get acquainted.
Oh, that's amazing news.<eos> Like, really amazing news.<eos> You're pregnant.<eos> I was wondering why you switched to decaf, especially while working a 13-hour shift.<eos> The last thing this baby needs is an uncle psychopath.<eos> You and Alaric having a baby.<eos> I...<eos> Jo, this is...<eos> This is amazing. I...<eos> I'm so happy for you.
How would we even begin to know that?<eos> Oh, I'm sure I mentioned it at some point.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ticktock, ticktock.<eos> Judges are waiting for a final answer. What was my mom's final memory before she kicked the bucket?<eos> Well, looks like, uh, Whitmore's gonna need a new philosophy T.A.<eos> Hmm. Your mom was teaching you how to ride a bike.<eos> Bingo!<eos> And Stefan wins, which means you two lose, which isn't that bad actually because now it just means we get to kill the both of you.
I hate that I can't make myself feel more.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Heads I kill Tyler, and tails I kill Matt.<eos> Deal?<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> Ooh! Looks like somebody's angry.<eos> He's a wolf.<eos> It's his resting face.<eos> You wonder why everyone hates vampires?<eos> Look at you, messing with people for no reason.
Hey, Caroline.<eos> I will gladly kill him for you, but I know what a jerk he was during your relationship, so if you want...<eos> I want.<eos> Come on, Tyler.<eos> I dare you.<eos> Ty, stop.<eos> She will kill you.<eos> Get out of here, Matt.<eos> Nice going, Tyler.<eos> She flat out told you that she didn't love you?
I was afraid I would hurt you and your brother.<eos> The last time I saw you was the day of my funeral.<eos> You weren't imagining it.<eos> I was your angel.<eos> Damon, voice-over: Then tell him that you wish you could have seen him grow up.<eos> If only I'd been there to see you grow into a young man, to protect you from your father's temper, but I was so ashamed of the things that I'd done, of what I'd become,<eos> and by the time I got my appetite under control and was coming back for you and your brother, I was hunted down and banished to a prison world by the Gemini.<eos> The one thing that helped you get through being trapped in that awful place...<eos> Was the hope of seeing my sons again.<eos> I know there are no words that make up for me abandoning you, but we have all of eternity for me to try.
She's pregnant with our son.<eos> It doesn't feel like that.<eos> It doesn't feel like it's mine.<eos> We wanted to have a child, no?<eos> But we can't have children.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> That child is yours and hers. I have nothing to do with it.<eos> That's why I don't want her to live here, or to have to see her.<eos> If the child just showed up, then ...<eos> But when I see you two together ...
The code is finished.<eos> Emil.<eos> L369G42, does that mean anything to you?<eos> No.<eos> Do you remember anything that could help us? Sounds, smells, anything.<eos> - I could hear things outside.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> John?<eos> - Are we getting through?<eos> - Yes, we hear and see you.
I was surprised to get your call.<eos> Well, most death row inmates, in the end, they like to clear their conscience before execution.<eos> I hadn't held out much hope for Evan Lee, but, well, here we are.<eos> I can't believe she's dead.<eos> Jackson, we did everything we could for her.<eos> I know, but...<eos> I would have liked to have thanked her.<eos> For sticking by him.<eos> It's a hell of a lot more than my mother and I did.<eos> Well, from everything you told me, that was the best thing that could have happened to all of you.
His name is Virgil.<eos> You shouldn't let him in.<eos> Didn't you do the same thing with Frédéric?<eos> You're scared of him?<eos> I'm like him. Stop it!<eos> They're not like you.<eos> – They can hurt us.<eos> Mom told me what happened when you tried to leave.<eos> – What did she say?<eos> – They attacked you.
– What did she say?<eos> – They attacked you.<eos> – They hit her.<eos> – No on attacked her.<eos> It was like earlier. She hit herself.<eos> You saw what happened.<eos> Virgil didn't mean any harm.<eos> – Why would she do that?<eos> – I don't know.<eos> – They didn't attack you? – No.
Look at her eyes.<eos> Look at her face.<eos> It's her!<eos> You can see it's her.<eos> It's her.<eos> Speak to him.<eos> Speak, Audrey.<eos> What should I say?<eos> She remembered you.<eos> She told me about when she first met you.
- Sure. - Yeah.<eos> See, this the kinda car I want.<eos> Except I'll paint mine black, you know, like a matte black.<eos> That's an idea.<eos> Hey, you remember that time Tre stole that car, but it turned out to be a hearse and you were so scared you pissed your pants?<eos> He was so scared.<eos> - I'll just be two minutes.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Sorry about this, but thanks for taking him.<eos> Of course, it's nice to see the two of you together.
- Mom!<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Who's your new friend?<eos> I'm not talking about it.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> - I'm not talking about...<eos> - Can I meet him?<eos> - Where are the bottles?<eos> They in here?<eos> - Did you meet him at The Grove?
There are just so many people in this room who made this day possible.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - First, my incredible wife...<eos> - Stop it.<eos> ...who married me one year ago against her better judgement.<eos> Well...<eos> And agreed to do it again, in front of our loved ones, because she knew it was important to me.<eos> To my bridesmaids.<eos> Nobody could ask for 13 greater friends, and I just love you guys so much.
- So, look, about that lunch...<eos> - No, excuse me, one second.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jacob, hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - She loves you, you know.<eos> Lori loves you.<eos> And I know because I see how unhappy she is since you guys split.<eos> And, I know everybody's supposed to make their own happiness, but she's never been like that.<eos> Well, I mean, maybe she was like that before, but she's not anymore, and I don't know if it's too late for you guys, but I know it's also totally awkward and I'm overstepping my boundaries maybe...
We just have to hope that he's dumb enough to log on from a second computer.<eos> Excuse me a minute.<eos> Eliza wants to meet.<eos> You think it's legit?<eos> I think we always plan for the worst.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Just hold it together.<eos> We just need that name, and then we're out of here.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Before I help you, you two are gonna help me with something.
Or dance to the tambourine... As an object of entertainment.<eos> The poor thing's suffered conditioned response training.<eos> After class, his owner Metin will join us in taking our friend... To the rehabilitation forest where he'll be happy.<eos> Now, why is man so mad about bears?<eos> Well, they're sensitive, thoughtful, have a gift for empathy...<eos> Prof, by 'sensitive' and 'thoughtful' you mean?<eos> They always call on special occasions.<eos> For heaven's sake!<eos> You guys swap places. You aren't paying attention.<eos> Shame on you!
Where?<eos> May your hands stick together!<eos> May you suffocate in hell!<eos> Hit him, the damn crook!<eos> Who is this maniac?<eos> Hit the crook!<eos> The fish is dead.<eos> You keep quiet!<eos> Gonna be a nighthawk, are you?<eos> Stop fighting, you two!

- Greetings.<eos> - Greetings, Niyazi.<eos> Welcome.<eos> What's up? You're here alone.<eos> Where's the wife?<eos> The wife?<eos> Ah, you mean Hediye.<eos> No, she's not my wife.<eos> Really?<eos> Sorry. I took you for married after always seeing you here together.
Talking division of property before marriage is shameful.<eos> Forgotten something, professor?<eos> Yes, thanks to you.<eos> That I'm human. I'm no longer human.<eos> The bet's off. Count me out.<eos> A person's word is their honor.<eos> I forgive no one who breaks it.<eos> And I forgive no one who schemes behind my back.<eos> What's done is done. I forgive you both.<eos> I forgive you. Sit back, enjoy the race. I'm going.
No. 3 Old Man, owned by Riza Kabakoz, wins the 75th Aegean Derby.<eos> There you go!<eos> That's my horse!<eos> God.<eos> God.<eos> God.<eos> There you go!<eos> Members of the press.<eos> We also have something else to celebrate today.<eos> Ms. Sultan will give you the good news.
Riza!<eos> Sultan.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> You're here, right?<eos> I'm here, don't worry.<eos> Let's go, Hediye.<eos> Ah, Dr. Niyazi!<eos> Dr. Niyazi!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> May God punish you!
You're great.<eos> - You liked it?<eos> - You were superb.<eos> You're so funny.<eos> And your man?<eos> He's the best.<eos> How sweet.<eos> - You're making progress. - That's nice.<eos> I never tire of seeing you play, honey.<eos> I'd like to see you act together.
- One or two?<eos> - One.<eos> My baby's watching his weight.<eos> - It's not working.<eos> - It's worse.<eos> Did you ever try letting him cry?<eos> Yes. Thanks.<eos> We tried, it doesn't work.<eos> He can cry for hours.<eos> I feel he's always testing you.
Previously on The Last Man On Earth...<eos> You were gonna go skinny dipping?<eos> It was a prank.<eos> You just sprayed the wrong dog.<eos> We should have never gotten married, and I'm really, really sorry.<eos> Divorce papers?<eos> You're better off without me.<eos> So the reason Phil and I called you here tonight is to let you know that we have made the mutual decision to get divorced.
All right, ice broken.<eos> Uh, so the reason I called you all here today is,<eos> - because, as your president...<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Phil's the, uh,<eos> President of the United States, so...<eos> It's a long story.<eos> But it's legit, you know?<eos> Anyway, as you're president, I just wanted you all to know that you can always come to me if you need anything, okay?
Guess what?<eos> You got raided.<eos> Guess what else?<eos> I lost someone who matters to me.<eos> So did I.<eos> Why are we still alive?<eos> Because of this.<eos> Explain.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to make you afraid.
We don't need to fight.<eos> War is our way.<eos> Ask yourself, is this a war you really want?<eos> Yes!<eos> You'll pay for what you have done here today.<eos> I am a Viking.<eos> Ashildr, daughter of Einarr.<eos> You have mocked our gods.<eos> Killed our warriors.<eos> And we will crush you on the field of battle.
You have mocked our gods.<eos> Killed our warriors.<eos> And we will crush you on the field of battle.<eos> That's better!<eos> - You were about to leave.<eos> - You almost had me talking!<eos> - Talk is for cowards.<eos> - No, no, no, listen to me.<eos> I accept your challenge.<eos> - We will crush you!
But you see, that's the trouble with viewing reality through technology -- it's all too easy to feed in a new reality.<eos> You got it?<eos> Great.<eos> A story to save a town, and a puppet from a nightmare.<eos> You see, you've just seen the world through the eyes of a storyteller.<eos> The mighty armies of the Mire -- brutal, sadistic, undefeated.<eos> Even I believed the stories.<eos> But after today, no-one will again.<eos> An army like yours, it lives or dies on its reputation -- its story.<eos> And today, you were sent packing by a handful of farmers and fisherman.
It's just lucky that nobody recorded that.<eos> Wait a minute, we did.<eos> See, all it needed was the Benny Hill theme.<eos> The Benny Hill theme, yes!<eos> Now, you see, we could just keep this as a funny little film and play it every year at the Christmas party, OR... I could upload it to the galactic hub and get a second opinion.<eos> So, the question you need to ask yourself is this -- just how important is your reputation to you?<eos> Here's a little sneak preview, piped straight into your helmets, free of charge.<eos> Wait!<eos> Cowards!<eos> If you don't leave right now, I'll put it out there for all to see and no-one will fear you again.
Just someone.<eos> Not the whole town.<eos> Just save someone.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I know where I got this face, and I know what it's for.<eos> OK, what's it for?<eos> To remind me.<eos> To hold me to the mark.<eos> I'm the Doctor, and I save people.<eos> And if anyone happens to be listening, and you've got any kind of a problem with that, to hell with you!
Yesterday.<eos> According to his cell phone records, he called you a couple of hours ago.<eos> Well, I... I... I...<eos> I don't know what to tell you because I never got a call.<eos> Ok.<eos> What about Tom Reyes?<eos> Tom Reyes? I don't know. I haven't seen Tom Reyes.<eos> Max, Max.<eos> I'll get dressed.<eos> I'll meet you guys at command, ok?
I sense them, your tools of power.<eos> A witch dagger to kill, a moon stone to see, and a medicine bag to be unseen.<eos> Be careful with that one.<eos> The role of magistrate cannot fall to an un-sympathetic foe.<eos> It must be a witch.<eos> Corwin is nowhere to be found.<eos> Whoever is out there, they are targeting us.<eos> In my own home. My own bathtub.<eos> How is it possible?<eos> Someone wants to kill you.
What has she ever done to you?<eos> Oh, dear Isaac.<eos> You have no idea, do you?<eos> She, not I, is the real monster.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Get that stinking pile out of here. Hey!<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't think me ungrateful, Reverend Mather, but how come you to be here?<eos> You saved my life, but I begged you to never return to Salem again.
You do not feel weak at all. I can tell.<eos> Then why am I out here with you?<eos> Well, that remains to be seen.<eos> You are a most unusual woman, Mary Sibley, truly exceptional.<eos> Really?<eos> In what way?<eos> Well, I've known other women as beautiful and as intelligent, but it's something else.<eos> Do tell.<eos> You're like me.<eos> The body holds no horror for you, nor, it seems, death itself.
Oh, Mr. Hathorne.<eos> You'll find me ill-prepared for visitors at present.<eos> If you'd call later...<eos> Sadly, I come on an urgent matter best discussed behind closed doors.<eos> Have you given thought to our earlier conversation?<eos> About the dangers facing a young, orphaned, unattached maiden? Yes.<eos> Threats surround me.<eos> They say the most treacherous of wolves may appear in a lamb's cloak.<eos> So true.<eos> No, there is talk in Salem, much talk, about you and your trip from Boston.
You remember the pitiful fate of young Bridget Bishop?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Who could forget seeing a dear, innocent friend hung?<eos> There is but one sure way to avoid you suffering the same fate, if not a worse one...<eos> Sir, I... I hardly think this is the time...<eos> No, it is indeed the only time, considering your predicament.<eos> Forgive me, magistrate.<eos> Since the recent death of my parents, my fragile mind is so clouded.<eos> Let me cut through the clouds and be very clear.<eos> As wife of the magistrate, no one would dare accuse you.

That boy is a relation of yours?<eos> Of Mr. Sibley's. He's staying with us a spell<eos> Your nephew's words were unsettling.<eos> He's unlike any boy I've ever met.<eos> Have you met many?<eos> Hathorne came to me today.<eos> That man is no end of trouble.<eos> He demanded I marry him, and if I refuse, he's all but promised to have me examined for witchcraft.<eos> Ooh, unfortunate, since you are a witch.<eos> I braved the horrors of that hag in that well for you.
'Tis the way of the world, for now.<eos> We women are utterly defenseless without a man.<eos> A woman's beauty is her only power, so for us, a man's power must be his beauty.<eos> I had to endure the sweaty molestations of Mr. Sibley for his power.<eos> Now you will do the same 'neath Mr. Hathorne.<eos> I could no more marry him than I could a pox-ridden drunkard from knockers hole.<eos> Perhaps there is another choice.<eos> I doubt you're ready to make it happen. What?<eos> Anything.<eos> Please tell me, I beg you.
Kill me if you will.<eos> I told you once before when you held a knife to my throat, I am ready for hell.<eos> But let me say two words before you do...<eos> Mary Sibley.<eos> What about her?<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.
No.<eos> He has much to offer... safety, security.<eos> Do you think I should marry him?<eos> Uh, I... I... I don't know what to say.<eos> If you say I should, I shall.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> What has love to do with marriage in such a world?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is all very sudden, and the... the moment is very ill-timed.<eos> I fear I have no advice for you.
- Your grand rite died a failure.<eos> - Careful.<eos> Your next word may be your last.<eos> Your words are nothing but air.<eos> We both know you need me.<eos> You need me to complete the consecration.<eos> I hold the reins, not you.<eos> And terrorizing my hive and killing one of my own will not sway me from my destiny.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do need you.
Galvani's thesis was that electrical impulses are carried along the nerves by an independent system of fluids, invisible to the human eye.<eos> That this process can be seen to function in conjunction with artificially induced energy in the absence of other animate processes seems to suggest that it lies at the very foundation of what we now understand to be multi-cellular organic life.<eos> We now have the opportunity to observe it functioning... at close quarters.<eos> What the devil is going on?<eos> For God's sake, somebody get these creatures out of here right now.<eos> Is this some sort of joke? Get out!<eos> It's not a bloody farm yard!<eos> Go on, get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Who put you up to it?
Chloe?<eos> Hey, what's going on over there?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, Chloe.<eos> Hey, Chloe.<eos> - Chloe?<eos> - I'm sorry, I have to go.<eos> Is it possible that the bat was attracted to my phone or to technology? I mean,<eos> - is that crazy?<eos> - Well, crazy seems to be on a sliding scale - since I met you guys.
No, you don't know that.<eos> I knew.<eos> My mom is running again, and the polls suggest she'll win.<eos> Yeah, that's fine.<eos> This week we'll have a mock election where the older classes get to vote.<eos> -No...<eos> -Yes, and we need candidates.<eos> The candidates must come up with a policy for the best public school system.<eos> I have some assignments here. There's a lot more information.<eos> -And we need to split you into groups.
That's great. We already have one candidate then.<eos> But there's no election with just one candidate.<eos> So who's running against Niklas?<eos> People are voting in Afghanistan despite risking being blown to pieces. You guys won't even raise your hands.<eos> OK. Then we'll have to draw for it.<eos> Let's have a look at the student list.<eos> -Kareem.<eos> -Huh?<eos> Niklas and Kareem, you're our candidates.<eos> We'll split you up into two groups.
Duh.<eos> First step... convince her that my humanity is still off.<eos> I'll tell her that my run-in with our mother had no effect on me and I want to keep the party going.<eos> Ah. Look at that.<eos> St. Stefan has a plan.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> Whoever's holding the kitten gets to talk about their feelings.<eos> Torture her until she breaks.<eos> Sold.<eos> So do I need to remind you two that the last time Caroline thought that we were trying to flip her switch she went on a killing spree?
Hey.<eos> We were just keeping a really close eye on your friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Real close.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good news!<eos> Your shift's over.<eos> I'm here to relieve you.
I can take it for us.<eos> Ok? Because even if it doesn't work, even if all goes to hell, even if I'm miserable and alone, the smallest chance at the perfect life with you is infinitely better than an immortal one without you,<eos> and I know this, Elena.<eos> I love you...<eos> And I will love you until I take my last breath on this earth.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> Bonnie and Matt are already M.I.A., and now you and Damon?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> This is a wedding. This is supposed to be Jo's magical night, and you are ruining it.<eos> We're starting without you.
He killed her.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And Elena got knocked out, and she's not waking up.<eos> The doctors keep telling me there's nothing physically wrong with her.<eos> I don't know what to do, Bon.<eos> Stay there, ok?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Good.<eos> You're up.<eos> Sorry to be indecorous, but you were both solidly unconscious when I pulled you from the wedding mayhem.
I do see your point.<eos> All right, that's quite enough.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Nothing, my lady.<eos> But you seem agitated.<eos> Perhaps your servant should draw you a relaxing bath.<eos> What is that?<eos> Did you see her face?<eos> Or was it not her face you were looking at?<eos> This was left at the gate for you.
Your greatest risk will be running into him.<eos> Still, there are three checkpoints, and he can only be at one at a time.<eos> I'll have to take that chance.<eos> I'll leave the papers and instructions under these rocks.<eos> We can't risk meeting again.<eos> For the rest of our lives.<eos> I hope that yours is a long one.<eos> Go.<eos> Live.<eos> I could pay you to bring me to Lyon.
It'll be wonderful.<eos> The truth is I haven't got a lot of friends at the castle.<eos> It's lonely.<eos> My Claude... lonely?<eos> I am sure you have a horde of gentlemen following you about.<eos> And I'd love to be one of them, if I had more time.<eos> I should be on my way if I want to ride out before nightfall.<eos> Have you come to kill me?<eos> Lord Akers?<eos> Elizabeth sent us to look out for you.
Elizabeth sent us to look out for you.<eos> My lord, the French!<eos> Mount up!<eos> Away!<eos> Walk the horses.<eos> It'll make less noise.<eos> We'll take him to the safe house.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You abandon me, you rescue me, you're speaking of a safe house?<eos> When I crossed the Channel, I found Her Majesty waiting at Dover to escort her new husband and give you good inspection, I have no doubt.

They're trying to tumble her from the throne.<eos> She needs to secure her position.<eos> Then why is she still interested in wedding a mere prince?<eos> She's not.<eos> No more dukes and princes for her.<eos> She's determined to wed a king.<eos> I see.<eos> Someone who can join his kingdom and power to hers, the perfect strategy.<eos> Yes.<eos> So I've been sent to inform you that Her Majesty still rejoices in the idea of marrying you, and she's ready to give you her backing, if you take the throne of France.

Where?<eos> What could possibly be more important than your duty to me?<eos> It's her, isn't it?<eos> Your madam girlfriend.<eos> I was planning on seeing her, yes.<eos> You just can't stand to be away from her, can you?<eos> It's been all of ten hours, and you have to get back to her side.<eos> I like being with her, that's all.<eos> Clearly you're not up to handling both the needs of your personal life and my demands.<eos> She's distracting you.
He had official papers, an identity to step into.<eos> French papers?<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> You may go.<eos> After all of this, could Mary still be helping him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Out of guilt or affection, even though he's lost to her.<eos> Has she no idea what she risks?<eos> ! Your forgiveness, your protection, your mercy... forever.<eos> General, it bodes well for you that you're having an audience with our king again so soon.
Ready to return to the castle?<eos> Look at you, all business.<eos> Once you couldn't stop talking about the epic, insufferable love you and Greer share.<eos> Is the wedding going to be in her whorehouse?<eos> With whore guests and a whore officiant?<eos> If so, you have to invite me.<eos> I'm only teasing.<eos> But I am desperately curious about your upcoming nuptials.<eos> I command you to give me details.<eos> You can command me to escort you to every dress shop in town, or to stand by your door until I collapse.
You wouldn't have to hide who you are<eos> - or what you do.<eos> - I doubt the court ladies would welcome me into their embroidery group.<eos> You don't need them.<eos> You'd have me.<eos> At least visit the castle, and see if it's a place where you could be happy.<eos> I know I would be, if I could... look at your face every day.<eos> Looking for me?<eos> That was a warning shot.<eos> The next will hit you between the eyes.
Very well.<eos> I'll do as you ask.<eos> I'll leave at first light.<eos> General Renaude.<eos> Is something the matter?<eos> Your Majesty, thank goodness we found you.<eos> The path ahead is crawling with Condé's men.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> I'm headed to the castle, as the king commanded.<eos> But my men could guide you to another route.
I would think a man who values self-preservation as much as you do<eos> - would have similar plans to flee the castle.<eos> - The Queen Mother has elected to go down with the ship.<eos> Therefore, so will I.<eos> Should I expect more embarrassing drawings of me to appear, once Catherine learns of this visit?<eos> You've heard of our relationship.<eos> I had a feeling that your wager with the lords was a charade.<eos> Your real aim was to push me away.<eos> And who else but Catherine would want that?<eos> I don't know what's more contemptible, the fact that she asked you to humiliate me or that you agreed.
I deserve that.<eos> You're better than this.<eos> You don't have to be Catherine's lap dog.<eos> No one ends a relationship with Catherine de Medici.<eos> Then why are you here with me now?<eos> Why do people commit acts that defy sense, even... self-preservation?<eos> Why did Mary risk her throne for a man she could never marry?<eos> Why did Francis see what his wife was doing and still look away?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that should anything happen to either of us, I hope that you will remember me not as the man who lied, who betrayed you.

My lord.<eos> We've received a message from the enemy.<eos> Prince Condé requests a meeting with the king.<eos> One-on-one.<eos> Who's there?<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I have orders to escort you to the ballroom, where women and children will be safe and under heavy guard.<eos> You might have saved my life by helping me reach the tunnels.<eos> - I protected you.
I can take it seriously, too.<eos> Yesterday I snapped at you, when you asked<eos> - about Greer and the wedding.<eos> - Leith, you don't have to...<eos> There isn't going to be any wedding.<eos> It's over.<eos> Greer ended it.<eos> She'd rather be alone than with a man who can never make her feel safe.<eos> Greer has a fierce streak of independence, and that's something I can relate to.<eos> But having you in my corner like I did today, if I could have that for life...
But I searched the tunnel.<eos> If someone was there, they're gone.<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> But I know what I saw.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You'll feel better when you join the others.<eos> Nothing can get to you there.<eos> Archers, hold.<eos> I wish there was a way to end this without bloodshed.<eos> Whose blood concerns you more... your husband's or your lover's?
- No.<eos> There cannot.<eos> Which is why I reject your offer.<eos> I refuse to surrender.<eos> My reign will not end without a fight.<eos> Doesn't Mary's life mean anything to you?<eos> It means a great deal.<eos> Which is why you're the last man I'd entrust it to.<eos> You still think you can win, don't you?<eos> That there's help on the way, that King Philip will save you?
That there's help on the way, that King Philip will save you?<eos> That's right.<eos> I know all about the messengers.<eos> The urgent cry to Spain for help.<eos> The first didn't reach the border before my men intercepted him.<eos> The second, too, fought valiantly, but he was outmatched and captured.<eos> The third...<eos> Well, he's no longer with us.<eos> There is no help on the way.<eos> No one is coming for you.
You're speaking Pagan.<eos> I don't feel like myself.<eos> That's because you're not yourself.<eos> If I thought for a moment that Condé could guarantee your survival, I would have agreed.<eos> Surrendered?<eos> Lost the castle and your life without a fight?<eos> I am the king, but I am also a husband.<eos> Condé's still in love with you, Mary.<eos> That's why he kidnapped you.<eos> He sees a future for the two of you after my death.
You murdered my son!<eos> That can't be right.<eos> There must be a mistake.<eos> There's no mistake!<eos> I held John's blood in my hands.<eos> We captured one of his men and he confessed to everything.<eos> - Louis, what have you done?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> I've done nothing!<eos> I should have killed you a long time ago.
More secrets?<eos> Is that what we really need?<eos> I don't understand how you can justify it, in your heart, in your soul, these<eos> - Ruling requires that your hands be drenched in blood.<eos> You... who have led so many to their destruction, know it.<eos> And Francis, who killed his own father, knows it.<eos> You are no better than me, either one of you.<eos> And I am sick to death of you pretending otherwise!<eos> The difference between us is this.<eos> For us, bloodshed is a gruesome last resort, but for you... for you, it is as easy as drawing your next breath.

W...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you say you're a king?<eos> From the Kingdom of Imereti, uh, near Russia and the Black Sea.<eos> I've been studying abroad, but I'm making my way back home, because my father just died.<eos> You should attend the coronation.<eos> Well, I can't, at the moment.<eos> But, uh, perhaps you and I could write to one another, be pen pals?<eos> And... sometime in the next few months, say... this winter, maybe I could come and visit you.
But, uh, perhaps you and I could write to one another, be pen pals?<eos> And... sometime in the next few months, say... this winter, maybe I could come and visit you.<eos> I could use a pal.<eos> - They say it's lonely being king.<eos> - Well, it doesn't have to be.<eos> Not in my experience.<eos> Or at least not for long, anyway.<eos> So you'll be a man soon enough, won't you?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Listen, when I come to visit you, would it be all right if brought my sister's baby with me?
Let's get this meeting started. Abby.<eos> Water?<eos> It's clean.<eos> From my well.<eos> It's good to see you all. Safe.<eos> Right back here in Chester's Mill.<eos> You think we're gonna listen to you, Jim?<eos> You ran this town into the ground.<eos> No, Roger, I didn't.<eos> I risked everything to set you free from those cocoons.
You think we're gonna listen to you, Jim?<eos> You ran this town into the ground.<eos> No, Roger, I didn't.<eos> I risked everything to set you free from those cocoons.<eos> Because I love this town.<eos> And I'd do anything for it.<eos> I'll get you back on your feet.<eos> But first things first.<eos> We need answers.<eos> For you, for all of you.
Hunter, Norrie.<eos> Where's Joe?<eos> I thought that he was with you.<eos> He's had kind of a rough time since we got out of the cocoons and he ran off somewhere.<eos> Well, I'll find him.<eos> What can we do to help?<eos> More hunting?<eos> You were hunting?<eos> I killed a pig.<eos> Well, Barbie and Eva are out looking for food, but Junior could use you on his dorm-building team.
I need the two of you to build something very important.<eos> Hunter said Joe and Norrie abandoned their work.<eos> Send Hunter to find them and bring them to Town Hall.<eos> Have them wait there for me.<eos> Joe!<eos> Norrie!<eos> - Christine wants you back at Town Hall pronto.<eos> We're taking the day, Hunter!<eos> There's no law against that, is there?<eos> I have to come up and get you?
If you need anything, I'm here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Julia?<eos> If there's any chance to get Barbie back, the real Barbie you have to take it.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> We only slept together yesterday.<eos> You're carrying the new queen.<eos> This isn't any ordinary pregnancy.<eos> What's with the guards? Everything okay?<eos> I'll leave you two alone.
Eva and Barbie are special.<eos> And so are you, but in a different way.<eos> While they're meant to be with each other, I've always seen you... with many mates.<eos> Sam, get out of our way now.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I'm on your side.<eos> - Then where have you been?<eos> - I got captured.<eos> Christine experimented on me, but I'm fine.<eos> If you go out that door, three Millers are waiting for you.
He's on the guest list for the party.<eos> I know. I put him there.<eos> Always important to have a plan B.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Get off me. You idiots!<eos> Marcus!<eos> Tell them who I am!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Stand down. Yeah, stand down, you big dummies.<eos> You're lucky I don't get you fired.
I'm not asking you to go to trial.<eos> Just say you're his attorney, get visitor's rights, I'll take care of the rest.<eos> Deal?<eos> Um... Deal.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yeah, go over your evidence notes 101.<eos> This was an amateur mistake.<eos> I am allowing the receipt into evidence. Since prosecution made the copy, stipulation to its authenticity is inferred.<eos> You may proceed, Mr. Redlich.<eos> What do you mean they're kicking you out?
Sachiko knows.<eos> Big sister, you sleep a little and I'll watch over you.<eos> But...<eos> If your big brother comes, then I will wake you up.<eos> Is this....<eos> Hold on a second!<eos> The children should have killed three people...<eos> There are only two.<eos> Hear me out...<eos> I'm here to save you.
The children should have killed three people...<eos> There are only two.<eos> Hear me out...<eos> I'm here to save you.<eos> Shinozaki!<eos> - My tongue<eos> - There it is.<eos> Stop all the suffering and the misery.<eos> It has been enough, it will all be alright soon.<eos> Please, I'm begging you.
Please, I'm begging you.<eos> Thank you, Big sister.<eos> So you can go back to where you belong.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - Why haven't they ascended?<eos> I thought with their salvation, we could finally fight back and return home.<eos> Please, tell me.<eos> Please!<eos> It hurts... It hurts so much!<eos> Mommy's all alone, so I am giving you to her. In hell.
No, save your strength.<eos> You enter that place in your state, they'll surely put you back in a bed, and you'll be lying prey for mercy again.<eos> I will go.<eos> No.<eos> Now, this is awkward... you being here with your ex... and your next.<eos> Leave.<eos> You are even more beautiful when you're angry.<eos> I knew you would be.<eos> You do not know me.<eos> I do know you, Mary.
I will go.<eos> No.<eos> Now, this is awkward... you being here with your ex... and your next.<eos> Leave.<eos> You are even more beautiful when you're angry.<eos> I knew you would be.<eos> You do not know me.<eos> I do know you, Mary.<eos> After all, I have tasted you on my mother's lips.<eos> I know, for instance, that no man who has ever loved you has ever served you.
There, now.<eos> Come and see.<eos> I called you here to discuss a dark matter we must talk about increase.<eos> I shall never cleanse my hands of his blood.<eos> No, we mustn't let his final madness be his lasting legacy.<eos> His reputation as the greatest witch killer of our time rests upon his past success, does it not?<eos> My father was the very scourge of witches in the old country... not only in Old Essex, but also in Germany.<eos> There, he stopped this tribe of germanic witches, led by this ancient pagan siren that he sent back to hell.<eos> He often told me that was his... Proudest moment.<eos> And your father trained you through childhood to follow in his footsteps.

And though it took nearly half of your gold, the captain agreed to let us stow away in the belly of his ship.<eos> New Providence, a Bahamian isle, just as you wished... warmth, exotic peoples, no puritans.<eos> Or witches.<eos> This is the captain that's going to shepherd us to freedom.<eos> You must hurry.<eos> The ship is ready to sail.<eos> Cotton!<eos> The hour is late.<eos> I hope my presence is a welcome one, even after curfew.<eos> Yes, but what brings you on such urgent business?
I fear it is all my fault.<eos> There is no fault to be had.<eos> I've never felt so alive as I do right now.<eos> I mean, why... why delay saying what I know in my heart?<eos> I must ask if you have enjoyed an excess of spirits again.<eos> No.<eos> If I am drunk, it's on a much rarer spirit... you.<eos> All my waking hours and all my dreaming nights are haunted by one face, one voice, one... scent.<eos> Ah, for all my arsenal of words, my tongue is tied.<eos> Um, what I am saying is I love you.
Um, what I am saying is I love you.<eos> I didn't have a name for it.<eos> But now I do love.<eos> Its name is... forever inseparable from yours.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> This is too much, too soon. Um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um.<eos> - No. - No, no, no.<eos> For now, just know... that I love you.
I didn't have a name for it.<eos> But now I do love.<eos> Its name is... forever inseparable from yours.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> This is too much, too soon. Um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um.<eos> - No. - No, no, no.<eos> For now, just know... that I love you.<eos> I shan't rest till you are safe. And, um, the only safe place for you is here... In my heart.
- Yeah?<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - You haven't quit drinking yet, have you?<eos> - Should I?<eos> Good man.<eos> Chris and I sounded pretty good there for a minute or two.<eos> I was moved.<eos> Well, I thought it was beautiful.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> The heat's off in here, fellas. This will help keep you warm.

The Machine would never let us show up empty-handed to a rescue mission.<eos> Did the Machine have any thoughts about us not getting ourselves killed?<eos> Right now, she's pretty fixated on this shovel.<eos> _<eos> This looks like the spot.<eos> You got a plan to get in, partner?<eos> Relax.<eos> We got a backstage pass.<eos> We need a word with your boss.<eos> What makes you think he's here?
Oh, fuck, totally.<eos> You kind of even look like him too.<eos> Ow.<eos> You said the F word in a church.<eos> It's fine, I've heard all the bad words.<eos> Hey.<eos> There she is.<eos> Hey, Alicia.<eos> Girl, those boots are on fleek.<eos> Well, Frankie's sister is having a baby, so we're driving up to Sacramento in the morning, but we're here for tonight, and we really want to take you guys out for dinner.
You got to celebrate, right?<eos> How about you meet us for a drink after?<eos> What do you say, a quick cocktail afterwards?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> He has a sermon in the morning.<eos> She's probably right.<eos> Reverend needs his beauty sleep.<eos> Well, if you change your mind, we're staying at the Coronet.<eos> You have our number.<eos> Yeah. It was great to see you.
Cell towers will explode and cut off contact from our loved ones.<eos> - That's right. - Cars will smash into each other and blood will pour from the cracks and we'll still get by.<eos> - Yes. - Yes we will.<eos> But it's not the damage from the storm that mattered.<eos> It's the clarity that comes with the cleansing.<eos> It's what clears away the wreckage of our lives that's important.<eos> Can I get an amen?<eos> Amen!<eos> If you turn your life to Jesus with open arms,<eos> He is there... - I'm so glad you could make it.
"It broke my heart when the questions started and I knew I had to leave him.<eos> "I returned to find an old man who smiles and thinks I am a dream.<eos> "I am flesh and blood, my love, but all you see is a ghost."<eos> "Tears."<eos> "The Plague.<eos> "Mass graves."<eos> "Sightless children..." ".. clutching toys as they sleep, never to wake up.<eos> "My children.<eos> "My screams.<eos> "I could not save you...
I'm honoured.<eos> Hey, he's new at this.<eos> Someone will have to show him the ropes!<eos> Don't worry mate, you'll get the hang of it.<eos> When I'm gone, they'll all say "That Sam Swift,<eos> "he was well hung!"<eos> Well, I think a few of you know that already.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm sure I recognise a few of you lovely ladies.<eos> You... and you...<eos> I mean I'd introduce you all, but I can't remember your names.
Thanks.<eos> I'm gonna leave in just a minute.<eos> Stay awhile, let her sleep.<eos> I've been sitting in the other room trying to come up with a way to ask you about what happened today at the police station.<eos> Well, I think you just did.<eos> Do you wanna talk about it?<eos> Oh, I think I've said enough, don't you?<eos> I've done enough damage, talking.<eos> I'm just gonna stick to the visuals from now on.<eos> The police talked to us after they brought you out of that place.
- Matt!<eos> It's us.<eos> You're here!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh... my God, she's so big already.<eos> Hey, I'm your Uncle Matt.<eos> Remember me? Oh.<eos> Okay, come in.<eos> Mary will be happy to see you.
No. That's very generous, but I don't think it's a good idea.<eos> You'd rather live in a garage than stay with us?<eos> No, it's just I've been helping out at the church.<eos> I should be close by.<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> He doesn't want to, Nora.<eos> - But why doesn't he want to?<eos> - He just told you.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Oh, so you two bury a body together and now you got each other's backs, huh?
Looks nice.<eos> I would wear one like that if I wasn't the mayor.<eos> The mayor has decided to give us an additional 75,000 kroner grant.<eos> How do they imagine we can integrate 28 inclusion children for 75,000?<eos> The others think you are strange. And you know what, that is not OK.
I'll be there in a minute.<eos> Alright.<eos> OK. Uh, friendship.<eos> What is friendship?<eos> I'd like to answer. To me, it's something you share with another person you trust. Someone you can talk to.<eos> Someone you like to laugh and cry with.<eos> Someone you can share a meal with.<eos> But also someone you can be really mad at.<eos> For instance, if he suddenly gives a collection of scrap pictures to someone called Lotte, whom he is clearly in love with...<eos> But what is friendship to you?

It's up to you.<eos> About friendship.<eos> Now, if you could get together and work on it in groups of four.
But regarding the money...<eos> Yes.<eos> Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do.<eos> No.<eos> -See you. -Certainly.<eos> Alright, everybody, listen up.<eos> I think you presented some very, very nice stories about friendship.<eos> Or, that is, but also...<eos> What I mean to say is, I think perhaps it was a shame that you didn't mix with each other more.<eos> So I've planned a joint dinner together Thursday, for you and your parents and me.
-Good morning, Rita.<eos> -Morning.<eos> -Good morning, Rita.<eos> Good morning.<eos> -We should have told you about it.<eos> -It's alright, Helle.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -Trust me.<eos> I'm just so pleased with the way we cooperate now. I'd hate to risk that.<eos> -I'm happy for you. -Thank you.
It's leftovers from the staff room.<eos> That might cheer you up.<eos> Cake always helps.<eos> Cake always helps!<eos> Thanks!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You are a self-absorbed male chauvinist.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> We're sitting here discussing it. I think we should do it so that...<eos> Since you can't agree, I have a solution.
Nice stones, huh?<eos> Did you find them yourselves?<eos> -What?<eos> -We were talking about your stones.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Here you go.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -Anybody want more?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Alright, then, we'd like to bid you welcome to our home.
-Painting and stuff.<eos> -My mom is coming.<eos> And my brother.<eos> If that's alright?<eos> It's your space.<eos> Right?<eos> -Hi.<eos> Welcome.<eos> It's through the classroom and to the left.<eos> Good to see you again.
- Shut your... come on.<eos> - Hey! - Get off me!<eos> - Get out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get off me.<eos> Why didn't you guys just open the damn door, huh?<eos> What do you guys want?<eos> Transport.<eos> Son, just give us the keys.<eos> Come on, man, we'll take you with us.
We were eating dinner, it was nice.<eos> And then my husband said something, I said something back.<eos> And while I'm talking I'm thinking,<eos> "This is so fake.<eos> You're in someone else's movie and you're just saying lines."<eos> I felt... outside.<eos> Beats the fuck out of inside.<eos> You are not welcome here.<eos> - How'd they find us? - Doesn't matter.<eos> They can't hurt you now.
Listen, you don't have to...<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Wait, what are you...<eos> what are you doing?<eos> You don't...<eos> Hey.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Get the fuck off me! Get off me!<eos> Fuck you!
Gets the call her husband's been fucking shot.<eos> She just pulls the bullet out, no questions asked.<eos> That's real commitment.<eos> That's trust.<eos> That's love.<eos> Not like what you've got.<eos> What you've got, Kevin, isn't love.<eos> It's damage control.<eos> Your family blew up, Nora's family blew up.<eos> And now you're all just clinging on to each other 'cause you need to cling on to something.
She says if you don't get her back inside, he will die.<eos> Who?<eos> Matt and Mary Jamison.<eos> Jesus, Matt. Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You zip-tied him?<eos> Man got a busted hand.<eos> Works at the church.<eos> What, you scared he gonna baptize you or something?
No, of course not.<eos> Meet me in the alley in five minutes.<eos> Thank God you didn't say the roof.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> - Nothing, nothing.<eos> -(CLEARS THROAT)<eos> I like to come out here to smoke.<eos> Which I like to do in private.<eos> Actually, I'm meeting someone right now so...<eos> Yeah, you can meet them inside the building. Yeah?
(CLEARS THROAT) I thought you said it was a cat.<eos> Who names her snake Fluffy?<eos> A dazzling display of heroics by the Girl of Steel now has a grateful National City asking, "What oil spill?"<eos> - Watch out, Metropolis.<eos> -(CHUCKLING)<eos> Looks like we're about to give you a run for your superhero money!<eos> I can't believe it. It's working.<eos> People are really starting to believe in her.<eos> In you.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you.
You're Alura's sister.<eos> I am General Astra.<eos> And what is your name?<eos> You are very brave.<eos> Braver than most of your race.<eos> There is no reason to kill me, or anyone in National City.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> That my goal is simply to kill humans?<eos> You are so very wrong.<eos> I am here to save you all.
The door will only open for you.<eos> Mom.<eos> Hello, Kara.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The message we found in your pod, it was part of an interactive artificial intelligence program, that's culled from living memory.<eos> It's not really her, but...<eos> Kara, I have been programmed to offer you assistance here on Earth.<eos> Thank you, Alex.<eos> I'll let you two talk.
I know, babe.<eos> SPF 75? What a joke.<eos> Anything over 30 is basically useless.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We're going to visit Matt. Do you want to come to the fundraiser with us or go with your dad?<eos> Actually, Michael asked me.<eos> How do his parents feel about that?<eos> I don't think that he asked them.<eos> And I'm not really asking you either.
I wanted to do what he could do.<eos> I wanted to be something.<eos> So I said yes.<eos> And he wrapped his arms around me and I felt everything I was, everything I would be.<eos> I felt it get born and die over and over again.<eos> I had been afraid to use it.<eos> Afraid of...<eos> Afraid of what it meant.<eos> Of what came next.<eos> But I knew I couldn't let you hurt anymore, not if I can take it away.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tommy, I'm so sorry.<eos> Tommy.<eos> Tommy, please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Stay.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Remember me?<eos> I was here a month ago trying to recruit you.
I'll get a sketch artist.<eos> We had a plan.<eos> What was the plan?<eos> Meg said Kate taught her what to do.<eos> If they try to hurt us, we buy time.<eos> We role play, get into their heads.<eos> When they move us, I'll distract them.<eos> It's our best opportunity for you to run and get help.<eos> That's right. Kidnappers are most vulnerable at transfer points.<eos> Did the older man say anything about where he was taking you?
The last thing I need is another mouth to feed around here.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> It's Richard.<eos> He's trying to throw off the cops.<eos> Again.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We're both dead.<eos> No wonder he left you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said no wonder he drove you both off a cliff.
Thank you. _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, do you think we should do maybe one... _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> - You know I can hear you.
Wow, I could make you an honorary squint.<eos> Listen, before they rushed us out of there, we also found a worktable with large dried blood stains.<eos> - Victim was probably bled like the others.<eos> - All right, well, we'll know for sure when we're done examining the remains.<eos> I got to get back under the tent.<eos> Well, I got to get back into the plant.<eos> There's got to be evidence in there that needs to be secured.<eos> We'll take care of it.<eos> Guys, you don't understand.<eos> One false move in there, one mistake, and any moisture on your body could react with the ammonia and burn you from the inside out.
- All right, Boardwalk sold.<eos> - $400.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> Calm down, play fair.<eos> - Do not treat the banker like that.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - And that's the pair.<eos> - You always get all the good ones.<eos> Oh, look at that. I'm crushing you guys.
No, no, no.<eos> It's Travis.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - It might not be him.<eos> It's him.<eos> Here, take this, take this.<eos> Travis!<eos> Madison.<eos> Maddy?<eos> - I asked you to wait in the car.
Where are the people outside the fence?<eos> Where did you move them?<eos> Where?<eos> Where?<eos> All right, folks, listen.<eos> You are in one of 12 safe zones south of the San Gabriels, okay?<eos> So you guys are the lucky ones.<eos> You guys... you get to stay in your homes, ride this thing out, all right?<eos> So, relax, count your blessings, be nice.<eos> So I don't have to shoot you.
Thank you.<eos> So tell me, how do you verify what's real from any fakes?<eos> I have a practiced eye.<eos> What a wonderful sense of history it exudes.<eos> Dinner is ready.<eos> Shall we?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing snooping around the Nippon Building?<eos> Two coffees, please.<eos> I could say the same to you.<eos> What choice do you think I had? I had a family to support. How do you think I kept all of you safe?
Who is this friend?<eos> It's no one you know.<eos> Well, does this friend have a name?<eos> - Breasts?<eos> A vagina?<eos> - Stop!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, to both.<eos> None of your business, as your doings are none of mine.<eos> My lord, we need you immediately.
Extracting children from an armed assault.<eos> The boys could die in the melee.<eos> Prepare them anyway, as a last resort.<eos> What are you doing to save our sons?<eos> We are sending envoys to negotiate their release, and if that fails, we will secure the safest possible route to rescue them.<eos> This scum would never have dared to take our sons hostage, or kill men of God, if our army were here.<eos> Count, watch your tongue.<eos> I know that you fear for the life of your son, but you are addressing your sovereign king.<eos> These rebels will be captured and hanged, and I will do everything in this nation's power to return your sons to you safely.<eos> We know there is nothing more precious to you than your children, and we will defend them as if they were our own.
Take up defensive positions.<eos> Others may be on their way.<eos> I'm going to check on the dormitories.<eos> Go.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're safe.<eos> - Any news of the raid?<eos> - No, Your Grace.<eos> Lord Condé for you.
Why did you come to me so openly?<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> One of my footmen just informed me that some of my men were found dead amongst the radicals who overtook the monastery.<eos> Louis, I'm sorry to ask this but...<eos> I had no part in this attack, Mary.<eos> I'm not a traitor.<eos> Those bodies were planted there to blame me.<eos> Francis can't accuse me of treason without also condemning you.<eos> He'll find another way to be rid of me.<eos> Despite his personal feelings, Francis would never fabricate evidence against you.
- You've received my messages.<eos> I nearly believed that you cared more for your status at the French court than a marriage to Elizabeth.<eos> No, I.... I'm still interested, but as a prince of the blood, marrying without the consent of my king is treason.<eos> With the discovery of your men among the monastery radicals, your life is already at risk.<eos> My men were left there to stir Catholic prejudice against me.<eos> Prejudice may fan the flames, but I believe your relationship with Queen Mary is the spark.<eos> Or are you innocent of that, as well?<eos> If you think there's truth to it, then why entertain my marriage offer?<eos> Because it doesn't matter.<eos> Elizabeth will not hold this dalliance against you.
He's here.<eos> Who?<eos> That general I met, Renaude.<eos> You go ahead, and I'll give Greer the fabric.<eos> And leave you eyeing a man in a whorehouse?<eos> Does that sound like a good idea?<eos> I'm not gonna do anything.<eos> Go ahead, I... I'll just be with you in a moment.<eos> Lady Lola.<eos> I thought I recognized you, but I assumed I was mistaken.
Even for the mother of the king's only child.<eos> You mean especially for a woman known as the king's mistress.<eos> Word of your loyalty to Mary has spread.<eos> You have risen above any negative speculation there was about you.<eos> Your son is esteemed.<eos> Do not let anything diminish this position that you have earned.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I do.<eos> I would escort you back if I were still welcome at court, but, sadly, I'm not.
No drugs down here for you.<eos> Good luck going cold turkey.<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> You hated him and you wanted the Monarchy preserved.<eos> If anybody has the King's blood on their hands, it's you.<eos> - I can see it from here.<eos> - It's paint.<eos> He was endlessly disappointed in both of you.<eos> He said as much only yesterday.<eos> It must have angered you.
-What's wrong?<eos> You're still here?<eos> Did you get to talk with Rasmus?<eos> It went really well.<eos> So all is fine.<eos> See you.<eos> We're closing for today.<eos> Don't you want to go home?<eos> Do you all want to come with me?<eos> Listen, there's not enough room for all of you in my living room.
Previously on AMC's Halt and Catch Fire.<eos> West Group wants to buy you.
Yeah, agreed.<eos> - This morning at City Hall.<eos> We wanted to tell you first.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Don't you think that's something I'd wanna know about? - To be there?<eos> - Well, we wanted it to be the two of us.<eos> No big party, just two people in love.<eos> Don't be upset, Dad.<eos> This is good news.<eos> I'm happy for you.
- Young-ish?<eos> I don't mean to sound snobbish. But I won't marry down.<eos> Was Mr Matthew Crawley so very special in that way?<eos> Matthew was the heir to the earldom and estate.<eos> I don't want to be grander than my husband, or richer.<eos> It may surprise you, but I agree it's important to be balanced.<eos> That one should not be far stronger than the other.<eos> I just don't think it has much to do with money or position.<eos> Is that how you felt about Sybil?<eos> To all of you, she had everything, and I had nothing.
The dark the cold, being hungry.. That was bad enough. But there was something else going on.<eos> 'Choose one.'<eos> Hanna, how do you feel about scheduling some time together?<eos> Well, it can't just be me.<eos> I mean, it has to be the four of us.<eos> I can't force the others into a group session.<eos> Well, you're a doctor.<eos> Can't you subpoena them?<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> But if you can get them all to come to my office I'll find time for you.
I wanna keep it that way.<eos> What makes you think Ali's interested in Lorenzo?<eos> I saw them together.<eos> That's his business, isn't it?<eos> His and Ali's.<eos> We're not talking about just anybody here.<eos> We're talking about Alison.<eos> You know, people can change.<eos> She helped you find us.<eos> Right, 'cause she needed you and Mona alive.
Uh, no, not really.<eos> It's a coincidence.<eos> What is?<eos> 'Charlie.'<eos> Charlie DiLaurentis?<eos> Just Charlie.<eos> But my dad told you the truth.<eos> About what?<eos> Charlie doesn't exist.<eos> It's nice to see all of you again.
And the other one's Charlie.<eos> The boy who never was.<eos> You're smart, Aria.<eos> I never would have thought to look in the button jar.<eos> Yeah, well, it's where I used to hide my candy money from Mike.<eos> My dad's gonna be home soon.<eos> You should probably go.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't leave you alone right now.<eos> No, it'll be okay.<eos> I'll find out what all this means and then I'll call you.
Looking for you.<eos> I was gonna be the hero instead I get arrested, thrown in jail.<eos> 'They investigate my parents, tear up my uncle's farm' because I wanted to help you.<eos> Because I didn't believe what people said about you and your friends.<eos> - Just let me explain...<eos> - 'Don't.' Just don't.<eos> We graduate in three weeks all you have to do is stay out of my way.<eos> You'll graduate..<eos> ...that doesn't mean we will. Oh, you'll graduate.<eos> The school wants you gone as much as the rest of us.
We graduate in three weeks all you have to do is stay out of my way.<eos> You'll graduate..<eos> ...that doesn't mean we will. Oh, you'll graduate.<eos> The school wants you gone as much as the rest of us.<eos> 'You'll graduate with honors.'<eos> Andrew, you need a lift?<eos> Like I'm getting in a car with you two.<eos> 'No, thank you.'<eos> Other towns have nice toxic dumps.<eos> Rosewood has you.
We're just gonna go check in, then we can drive you home.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you Lorenzo?<eos> Yeah, I'm Lorenzo.<eos> I'm Spencer.<eos> - I figured that's who you were.<eos> - Heh! Uh, this is Aria, Emily and Hanna.<eos> We're Alison's friends.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
Okay.<eos> Uh, well, your mom said I could spend the night.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?<eos> I-I'm not so sure.<eos> It's a good look for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good morning, girls.<eos> I just got off the phone with Dr. Sullivan and she was able to make time to see both of you today.
Uh, my mom just went to the bank she'll be back in a few minutes. Ah.<eos> ...how are you doing?<eos> It's strange to be back.<eos> Everywhere I go, everybody stares at me but nobody says anything.<eos> Well, it can be kinda hard to know what to say.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Man, I thought it was finally over. Now that Andrew's been released...<eos> We're right back to where we started.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Everybody's lookin' out for you guys.
Why did you turn the lights off?<eos> So the security guard wouldn't see us.<eos> "Us"?<eos> Oh, save it, Mona.<eos> You are not one of us.<eos> You're working for A.<eos> You and Lesli Stone are going down.<eos> We have what we need and we're giving it straight to the police.<eos> This college will prosecute.<eos> I'm just trying to save you from yourselves.
Veronica's offered to host a small gathering in the backyard barn.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> - 'Seriously?<eos> ' - Why not?<eos> Because it's filled with Melissa's stuff.<eos> How is that a banquet hall?<eos> - You can roll up a rug.<eos> - And what? Take our prom picture on top of a washer-dryer?<eos> Hanna, you don't have a choice.<eos> If the school board doesn't want you at prom or commencement..
- To get an answer.<eos> What?<eos> Wait.<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> Oh, watch me.<eos> Ali, why didn't you come to the barn?<eos> Did you hear from Charles?<eos> Did he text you?<eos> So what if he did?<eos> I didn't ask you guys to follow me here!
Tom: Don't take it.<eos> You take that money, and he'll have his hooks in you.<eos> Trust me, it's the last thing you want.<eos> I'm not a criminal.<eos> I've never even gotten a speeding ticket.<eos> Don't take it.<eos> When I heard you two were getting married, I was happy for her.<eos> People said you were okay. A teacher.<eos> Later on, they told me. You had decided to adopt a child and start a family...<eos> Guess you two decided to go another route.
Evelyn or whoever else might be there.<eos> Why don't you come with me?<eos> It'll be fun. I dare you.<eos> - You haven't been anywhere in ages.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll go and pack but we can't be long. I wanna be sure we're ready.<eos> We have masses of time.<eos> We'll be home tomorrow.<eos> You can manage for a day without us?<eos> I can manage without you for as long as you want.
Because we've got some news and I was waiting for Mary to join us.<eos> It's not the right moment.<eos> Carson, could we have some more coffee, please?<eos> Why isn't it the right moment?<eos> Well, Henry's abandoned you.<eos> No, he hasn't. I wanted him to go.<eos> - That's not what it looked like.<eos> - Well, that's how it is.<eos> There's no need for this.<eos> Edith, if your news is good, we are very happy for you both.
You don't know her.<eos> I'm getting married and you've lost your man.<eos> - And you just can't stand it.<eos> - There is no need...<eos> You're wrong. I'm very happy for you.<eos> And I admire you, Bertie.<eos> Not everyone would accept Edith's past.<eos> - Mary, don't.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> You must've told him? You couldn't accept him without telling him?
- A teacher now, but I'm an ordinary bloke.<eos> I've spent my life in service, fetching and carrying.<eos> You were a servant?<eos> I was.<eos> I am.<eos> And I was glad to get the work.<eos> My mum's in service. She works for Mr Travis at the vicarage.<eos> Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.<eos> But I never gave up on learning, do you see'?<eos> I read as much as I could and I taught myself, and I hope to be able to teach you.
Unless there's another of those delicious scones?<eos> Of course.<eos> Lucy, fetch the scones.<eos> When does the photographer arrive?<eos> Five o'clock, milady.<eos> And I'm afraid some of the village have caught on and they're waiting too.<eos> Are you sure you want to do it?<eos> Oh, ye of little faith.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
-A loser.<eos> And he's right.<eos> No. You're losers.<eos> You've been transferred from one place to the next.<eos> From school to school.<eos> From one consultant to the next.<eos> Now they've decided that you have to be at this school.<eos> But being losers doesn't mean that you're stupid.<eos> You've heard about your kind in the news, and you know that you're not welcome.<eos> The other pupils think you're weird, and you know what?
And we... are done.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll get this thing off then.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Right, I'll get the car key.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hope Angela's in.<eos> Yep, it looks like it.<eos> Joe!<eos> Maria! How lovely to see you!
Spud-Bob?<eos> Sorry Noelle.<eos> My mom is making sausages and rolls of spaghetti groups.<eos> Welcome everyone to this very special day. The signing of the new ownership agreement of Pottersglen Pottery.<eos> It is with a touch of sadness of the village community for sale.<eos> However, it feels right... that it goes back to the McKerrod family.<eos> Messing around again. - Are we?<eos> - I know,...<eos> - Thank you, everyone. - you and your dad are up to no good.<eos> - I heard you talking. - Myself and Junior,...
Well, then where were you?<eos> I needed your help.<eos> Don't any of you believe me?<eos> None of you are my friends.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Hey.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> Look at you.
You don't know what it's like to be me.<eos> You can have fun all the time, and you don't have to think about anybody but yourself.<eos> It was you... at the market?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who needs to man up now?<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What about these guys?<eos> Get her!<eos> Get your maggoty friends off of my mountain.<eos> Or I'll show you maggots the beatings that'll make you wish you've never seen.
I'll check.<eos> The murderer adapted the legend.<eos> The victim's belongings.<eos> I'll buy you a coffee.<eos> I want to see living people.<eos> Let your father know about the tests.<eos> - Hello...<eos> - Answerphone.<eos> I'll tell your friend, don't worry.<eos> I'm happy for you both.
Your notebook?<eos> I'm dyslexic.<eos> I hate to write.<eos> OK.<eos> Do you have your parents' permission to put the iPad in?<eos> It's my dad's.<eos> He plays on it all the time.<eos> -Put it in.<eos> -What are you putting in?<eos> I'm not putting anything in. It's just you guys.
-Can you hear something, too?<eos> -Fuck it, guys.<eos> -Hey!<eos> -Hey!<eos> Give it back!<eos> Now I have your attention, huh?<eos> It's for the police.<eos> Like the bag in the basement, which probably belongs to you.<eos> -Give it back!<eos> -I have warned you.
Check it out!<eos> She's not a bad piece.<eos> -Not a keeper.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> I hear she's been sleeping with everything that walks.<eos> -You just said she has a boyfriend.<eos> -She started early.<eos> -So you broke up with Espen?<eos> -Yes.<eos> It would be interesting if you met again.
How careless.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Our little lamb is safe and sound.<eos> Tell me what you've done with him or I will rip the truth from your heart.<eos> My heart?<eos> Better you should search your own.<eos> Oh, to hell with your riddles.<eos> Speak plainly or choke on my wrath.<eos> What have you done with my son?<eos> Perhaps it was the genius of those hags and your dusky caretaker to keep you in such ignorance.
A most unnatural substance you said you'd never eyed before.<eos> For god's sake, man, it set a branch on fire.<eos> My dear Mather, we'd both had a fair bit to drink the night before, and in the light of day, I can't really say what I saw.<eos> You saw what I saw, and now I need you to tell the magistrate about it.<eos> Be reasonable, friend.<eos> We saw nothing that can't be explained by the condition of those who saw it.<eos> Gentlemen, this pox may nearly be over, but I still have much work to do.<eos> What say you about this discrepancy, Mather? He's lying!<eos> For all we know, he is under some witch's control!<eos> Mather, I like you, truly, but you go too far, and I've had enough.

They've made it disappear.<eos> Or perhaps your gin consumption has finally caught up with you.<eos> In all fairness, my dear friend has suffered much lately...<eos> The loss of a father, banishment.<eos> And the strains of life can sometimes make the mind play vicious tricks.<eos> It is not my mind playing vicious tricks but your lying mouth.<eos> My dear Mather, you said not two nights ago you'd seen your dead father.<eos> You must recognize that that hallucination was brought on by your own distressed soul.<eos> And I believe this was just more of the same.<eos> Who got to you?
I've just come by to... to help you see things more clearly.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Can you do that with my life? If you'd let me, I just might.<eos> My son is all that means anything to me.<eos> - And to my mother.<eos> - She wants...<eos> We both know what she wants.<eos> Do you know what I want?<eos> You.<eos> I saw you with him last night.
Minor?<eos> It's beyond the conception of our greatest minds. I must know more.<eos> And so you shall.<eos> Mary and I were just discussing that.<eos> Think of me as a guide who, along with Mary, will lead you to explore your new horizons.<eos> You understand it is not easy for a woman of her standing to move about with a man such as yourself.<eos> People would talk.<eos> She has asked me to act in her stead.<eos> And I can assure you, sir, I am skilled at the highest order of the dark arts and sciences.<eos> I am to lead you to the woods for your initiation. - Now?
The Countess has him and prepares him for a sacrifice, but you know all about that, don't you?<eos> I seem to be the only one who didn't.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you deceive me for all those years?<eos> If I'd have told you, you never would have gone through with any of it.<eos> I did what was necessary.<eos> You were my friend.<eos> Was I?<eos> Or was I never anything but your property?<eos> Your good father owned me like a horse or a cow, and I was to care for you.
You were my friend.<eos> Was I?<eos> Or was I never anything but your property?<eos> Your good father owned me like a horse or a cow, and I was to care for you.<eos> And I did.<eos> You were just a girl.<eos> What would you have done with a child?<eos> I would have loved him.<eos> I do love him.<eos> And how long would your love have sustained you both in the wilderness?
- Fine!<eos> Carol.<eos> What?<eos> Your stupid sleep apnea machine.<eos> I'll use Bernice's.<eos> No, look, it's not that easy.<eos> I-I don't know how to fly that thing, okay?<eos> I-I'm... I'm a scientist, not a pilot, all right?<eos> Uh, if it's so easy, why don't you guys do it?<eos> And if we did make it down there, I'd probably die of the virus, and who'd take care of you guys?
Yeah, I was.<eos> So why can't we just pick up where we left off?<eos> Would that be so hard?<eos> - Come here, sit back down.<eos> I think we could do better this time.<eos> I don't want to sit down. No, I-I want another chance.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> This is not easy for me, either.<eos> I love you guys. I really do.
I mean the divorce.<eos> The divorce was horrible.<eos> Tom, what's the matter?<eos> Where's this come from? - Isobel.<eos> - Has Dad said anything?<eos> Dad?<eos> Is that why you were annoyed?<eos> Have you had an argument?<eos> No.<eos> Mum, if you do get divorced, I don't want to move.
Yeah.<eos> What, earnings, tax, that sort of thing?<eos> That sort of thing exactly.<eos> Right...<eos> Well, I'm afraid I didn't bring any files with me.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> I forgot.<eos> I always had you down as organised. Me, too!<eos> We'll just have to enjoy the food.<eos> The way Simon describes you when you first met - very different to now.
- Sorry.<eos> Come on. Come in, sit down.<eos> [SHE SIGHS] Let's start again.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My shoes don't fit any more. - Your shoes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> There must be something wrong with my feet.<eos> - So, were you sick? - I don't think you're picking up<eos> - on the right bit of the story.<eos> - Yeah, Mum just said, - when you and her met, you had a few too many.
Come on, let's step outside.<eos> We can pay for it.<eos> Could you get the dustpan and brush, please?<eos> That was Mum's.<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> It was an accident. Would you help me deal with this, please?<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> All right!<eos> Cheers!<eos> So, you two have known each other a while?
So, what do you think's going on?<eos> Other families, they spend time together.<eos> You get in so late,<eos> I want to talk to you, but then, you just say you're so tired.<eos> Other mums, they do things for their children, packed lunches, take them places...<eos> I do all those things... ..buy them new clothes at the weekend. And they love the dads.<eos> You just work.<eos> You work all the time.<eos> So, I think dad got sick of it and went to have sex with that other girl.<eos> And now, you both hate each other and want to get a divorce.
But he'll heal, he'll wake up?<eos> Mike's condition is very delicate.<eos> The next 12 hours are gonna be critical.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> I tried to get my gun out, but it happened so fast.<eos> He saved my life, and I just sat there.<eos> You did everything you could.<eos> It wasn't enough, Gwen.<eos> If he dies...<eos> I know it's difficult for you Hardy to understand, but some things are out of your control.
Well, I'm assuming she's a mail-order bride.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Okay.<eos> It's Rachel Zane.<eos> Damn. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Congratulations, bro.<eos> Seriously, you hit the jackpot with that one. Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> Uh, the...<eos> Wait a...<eos> Wait a second. Does Harold know?<eos> No, that's why I brought you guys down here. Okay.
- Hey.<eos> I didn't hear you leave today.<eos> That's because I left at 5:00 in the morning, trying to get an early start on this case. Mm.<eos> Uh, about that...<eos> I didn't want to say anything last night because you were so excited--<eos> But you're worried about me working with your father.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hmm. Mike, you're the two most important men in my life.<eos> Neither of you back down from a fight, and I'm just--<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna end up hating each other.
Delightful.<eos> Abe, look at this.<eos> Does that hole look big enough for a bear to get in?<eos> Oh.<eos> - _ Huh?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> Guys, I mapped this place for the city.<eos> It's a maze in there... you'll get lost.
Just shut the fuck up.<eos> - I thought we had a deal, Sheriff.<eos> - New deal.<eos> I've had my share of lookin' the other way for these guys.<eos> And they ain't cartels, son.<eos> They are wealthy, though, and they gonna pay handsomely for this.<eos> Which means... I get my own Affordable Care Act.<eos> No more Meximeds for me.<eos> Brand name prescriptions and Cadillac health plan. - Mm.<eos> - But as for you two, it's bullet-in-the-brain-dot-gov.
This room, whose door only blood can open, is our sanctuary.<eos> I've never seen a pox like this.<eos> But you've never seen a witch pox.<eos> It's as though the bile consumes its victim from the inside out.<eos> My dark lord is already inside the boy.<eos> And come the comet...<eos> We shall let him out.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I killed you.<eos> I gave you leave to spy on the Countess, not haunt the streets of Salem like some ghost from a cheap ballad.
No.<eos> I will see my son first. No.<eos> No, you will tell me first.<eos> Or what?<eos> You have nothing to threaten me with.<eos> I'm dead, already destined to return to Hell.<eos> But you... you...<eos> You have much to lose, including your life.<eos> Do not forget, she has killed far more witches than I have.<eos> So perhaps it's time for you to learn something new...

And what part in your plot am I?<eos> That is up to you, John Alden.<eos> There is so much we can do for each other.<eos> We come from different worlds.<eos> We might yet make a new one together.<eos> Think on it.<eos> Off your knees and on your feet, man.<eos> We've seen what happens to one plague victim.<eos> Let's see what happens to a hundred of them.<eos> Is it love that still has you addled?
No, my religion is science.<eos> And I am more convinced than ever that what the Church calls magic and witchcraft is but undiscovered science.<eos> I told you once that I had never met a woman like you, one who would peer into the abyss with me.<eos> But now I know you have peered longer and deeper than I.<eos> And what is it you want from me?<eos> I want in.<eos> Don't you see, John Alden?<eos> We both want the same things.<eos> You have no idea what I want.<eos> First the puritans betrayed you, then she betrayed you.

One.<eos> The pictures aren't very good.<eos> Can you zoom in on the prisoner?<eos> It's her.<eos> Get into her files.<eos> We have to assume they've been compromised.<eos> Too late.<eos> The encryption system's already been hacked.<eos> And they've sent through another video.<eos> Look, I admire you, OK?
Try to kill as few of them as possible,<eos> I need have to have someone to negotiate with.<eos> You know what they're capable of.<eos> Do not fall victim to it.<eos> - Truck open.<eos> Code Green.<eos> - Let's move out!<eos> Throw down your weapons!<eos> Come out!<eos> We have you surrounded!
Sure.<eos> You should probably get outta here for a little bit.<eos> These things are gonna have me knocked out for a while.<eos> No sense in you hanging around watch me drool in my sleep.<eos> Clear your head.<eos> There's a spare key.<eos> I'll do some dishes first.<eos> Maybe put in a load of laundry.<eos> Really, I don't mind staying.<eos> Was this the first time you two kissed?
It was that guy with the ax in his heart.<eos> He bled out in the barcalounger.<eos> We called him "lord of the flies," remember?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're wrong, bro.<eos> It was the pet-shop owner whose wife fed him to the dogs.<eos> What are you guys fighting about?<eos> Uh, the first case that Captain Montgomery partnered us on 10 years ago today. Really?<eos> It's your manniversary?<eos> And I didn't get you anything.
Dear brothers and sisters.<eos> Now is the time to open your eyes.<eos> If you have not yet woken up to the reality of profiteering and enslavement we've been warning you about, I hope you realize we are fast running out of time.<eos> The governments of the world and their corporate masters do not want us to speak.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we unlock truths.<eos> We expose villains.<eos> We exorcise demons.<eos> Citizens of the world, we are here to help.<eos> If you have any interest in waking from your slumber, in retrieving lost, damaged or stolen memory, we are here for you. We have your back.
Well, I know, but I'm dating him, I... so I have to be absolutely sure that he's the best person for the job.<eos> Well, I think he'd be perfect, but... you're the boss.<eos> It's your decision to make.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it looks like it's gonna have to wait a bit longer.<eos> That's Aubrey.<eos> Got a body torched in a van.<eos> And it sounds messy.<eos> Good-bye, my friends.<eos> Drink you later.
He's trained us, sacrificed for us, and more than one of us wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for him, so we owe it to him to figure out what the hell happened out there.<eos> I'm putting one team in charge of tracking every single movement that Agent Booth made in the last 24 hours.<eos> And the rest of you will go through his casework.<eos> And my office will make sure you have access to all the records you need.<eos> Booth put away a lot of killers.<eos> Any of them could be out for revenge.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Use it to help us find who did this.<eos> There is no time to waste here, people.<eos> Security team, I need you over here.
You named your baby Lucien? I did.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's my lizard's name.<eos> What a small world.<eos> He passed away recently.<eos> He was run over by an ice cream truck.<eos> Sad story.<eos> Wow, that's- - I'm sorry.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> So what brings you in here?
All right, thanks, Dev.<eos> That was great.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Why the fuck is he in a coffee shop?<eos> Jesus Christ, is he homeless?<eos> Um, the video feed's still live.<eos> Oh, shit. Sorry.<eos> All good.<eos> Guys, thank you so much for coming.<eos> Brian and I just wanted to take you to a nice dinner to say thank you.
They flew off.<eos> We never saw each other again.<eos> The memory of that gruesome silhouette against an Alpine sunset is something I will never forget.<eos> All right, well, um... it was great to meet you.<eos> Um, I'm gonna eat this cinnamon raisin bagel.<eos> I'll see you out there.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, guys, in this scene, you're gonna be swarmed by a horde of the "sickened."<eos> You'll be wearing mech suits to defend yourself.<eos> This is what they look like, just in case you'd like to know.

You can e-mail it to us, but I'll also be around on the ship for a while.<eos> - But you don't search the ship?<eos> - No, I'll just be asking people.<eos> The old guy's got some fucking attitude about handing over the lists<eos> Will you let us off the boat?<eos> You still here? I thought you were in Denmark<eos> I got homesick<eos> Hjörtur?<eos> How's Agnes doing?<eos> We'll let you off the boat as soon as we can
Girls, stop it!<eos> Come along, Maggi<eos> Kids, will you be quiet?<eos> Everyone! Kids, quiet!<eos> As you may know, the weather's got really bad<eos> We've called all your parents to come and pick you up<eos> - So school's cancelled?<eos> - Yes, Gunni, it's cancelled<eos> We couldn't reach all your parents, but we'll keep trying<eos> So for now, I'm asking you to be ready
He called yesterday and said that he'd call again<eos> Stop it now<eos> Don't talk such nonsense. Aren't you warm?<eos> - Yes - Let's take this sweater off<eos> - You must be absolutely freezing<eos> - It's bloody freezing<eos> Oh, hush! That's no way to talk<eos> BOTH:<eos> Mama!<eos> Hi, my darlings! My God, how I've missed you
Of course.<eos> Bye then.<eos> Bye.<eos> It's not... very handy.<eos> Yes, Sophie?<eos> I was getting up.<eos> I'm going to the doctor's.<eos> They'll take the strap off.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I'm glad for you.
How about Vietnam?<eos> In that case I'll come too.<eos> Yes.<eos> Maillet, transferred?<eos> That's good news!<eos> Every one of them?<eos> I'm so pleased.<eos> Oh, me...<eos> I miss you too, a lot.<eos> I'll come and visit you.
To us.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> How are you, mom?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> --Nothing.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You look strange, what happened?<eos> You see the misery we live in and you still ask?<eos> Be patient, I'll get you out of here...
Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to get, and Evil Corp is...<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> There's a twist.<eos> You're usually the one a step ahead of me.<eos> They hit the mother lode during the breach.<eos> Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.<eos> They're threatening to dump everything unless the FBI frees Colby.<eos> They released the video this morning.<eos> Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.<eos> Over the years, we have been watching you.
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.<eos> Over the years, we have been watching you.<eos> Your financial abuse of the poor, your corruption of governments, your cover-ups of the murder of innocent, ordinary citizens, all for the sake of a profit.<eos> This is why we at fsociety have decided you must die.<eos> We are malicious and hostile. We do not compromise.<eos> We are relentless.<eos> We will not stop until every tentacle of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the nerve.<eos> But we are also not without mercy.<eos> Our latest hack was our last warning.<eos> Meet our demands, and we will consider not destroying you.
We will not stop until every tentacle of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the nerve.<eos> But we are also not without mercy.<eos> Our latest hack was our last warning.<eos> Meet our demands, and we will consider not destroying you.<eos> First, release our leader, Terry Colby from your illegitimate prison immediately.<eos> Second, release all the people of the world from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.<eos> Third.<eos> Dissolve your corporation and donate all your assets to charities around the world.<eos> This proposal is non-negotiable.<eos> The people are realizing they don't have freedom of choice so long as you exist.

I'm your father.<eos> Can't you hear me?<eos> A witch dagger to kill, and a medicine bag to be unseen.<eos> Then run and hide, father.<eos> She is coming for me.<eos> Give the boy to me.<eos> I will take and hide him.<eos> There's something inside of me.<eos> He is not far.<eos> I will remember your eyes at the moment this entered you.
I'll do anything you want.<eos> How about you leave me well and far alone?<eos> You're no use to us anymore.<eos> That isn't true.<eos> No, it isn't true.<eos> You were never any use to us.<eos> You're being cruel.<eos> I thought you wanted me.<eos> Wanted you?<eos> No one has ever wanted you.
You're hurting me.<eos> No.<eos> Now I'm hurting you.<eos> I'll tell your mother.<eos> No need.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> She used to like watching me play.<eos> The countess told me I was like a daughter to her.<eos> The queen of queens has a real daughter and no need for a pale, feral imitation of one fished out from Salem's gutters.<eos> Now, if... if my mother wants you, she'll fetch you.
So stay where you belong... on the ship with the rest of the servants.<eos> This may hurt.<eos> All the other guys looked worse.<eos> That is the best I can manage.<eos> I'm afraid I'm no doctor.<eos> Just as well.<eos> Never knew a sawbones didn't double as an undertaker. - Ohh.<eos> - Slowly.<eos> Easy, now.<eos> Any violent movement, you'll split apart like a badly sewn doll.
Then you married a witch.<eos> Why are you saying this utter nonsense? !<eos> You don't know this girl as I know her, as I love her.<eos> And I saw Anne practicing witchcraft with my own eyes.<eos> Forgive me if I'm reluctant to condemn my wife based on the evidence of a man who has been walking around delirious since he returned to Salem.<eos> I must speak to my wife.<eos> - See with my own eyes. - No.<eos> Don't.<eos> Salem's controlled by witches, including the woman that you married.<eos> If they find out that you know, they'll kill you.
I have to go back.<eos> I must at least give her a chance to respond to this... Ridiculous accusation.<eos> You're a good man, Harvard.<eos> Always have been.<eos> Better than you know.<eos> Could you do me a favor?<eos> Be careful.<eos> You, too, John.<eos> Cotton...<eos> I'll see you on the other side.
Let me out!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Please!<eos> Let me out!<eos> I will not stand by and let it all just happen.<eos> I will do anything to stop it, even violate my Essex oath.<eos> Hear me, old ones.<eos> I swear I will not let you ignore me.<eos> I will cross the forbidden threshold.<eos> I am coming to see you.
_<eos> And yet, for a brief moment, I have.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Too risky?<eos> This is our only hope.<eos> _<eos> No!<eos> No, if you would... if you would only emerge and rally behind me, then we could defeat Marburg or... or... or die honorably trying.
Too risky?<eos> This is our only hope.<eos> _<eos> No!<eos> No, if you would... if you would only emerge and rally behind me, then we could defeat Marburg or... or... or die honorably trying.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Do not believe Tituba's promises.<eos> Whatever she says, the countess will not spare you.
I do not think they care.<eos> Well, that didn't work.<eos> [GASPS]<eos> - Race.<eos> - Quick, boys, get on!<eos> - You might wanna help your buddy.<eos> - We would stay, but our ride is here.<eos> Who are these animals?<eos> They helped us, Race.<eos> Have you two ever been in a chase before?
It's what happens, boys when you put business in front of other people's feelings.<eos> I guess I messed things up big-time.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Sorry I got you into this, Hadji.<eos> If I had it to do all over again, I would still be here.<eos> Thanks, but like my dad says, sometimes I bite off more than I can chew.<eos> RACE:<eos> Don't beat yourself up, Jonny.<eos> You too, Hadji.<eos> - I'm proud of you both.
You gonna tell me if you could've saved your mother, you wouldn't have done the same?<eos> So, you did it?<eos> You traded the Mother Cell for the medicine.<eos> No. I didn't.<eos> - But you almost did.<eos> - Yeah, I almost did.<eos> For my daughter.<eos> We're here trying to do this, trying to come up with a solution for everything, and you would, you would just give that away?<eos> Look.<eos> While I'm not trying to minimize any of it, you're all focusing on the wrong guy right now. Okay?
I don't know what happened.<eos> They just started making that awful noise.<eos> It's okay. Shh.<eos> Come on, Henry.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Come on, let's go inside.<eos> Maybe we should not be standing around in a clump like this.<eos> Like the lady said, if they're going to treat us like criminals, we need to act like criminals.<eos> Everybody gets one.<eos> Any calls you make, keep them short.
No, this is not a negotiation.<eos> Then I suppose there's nothing left to discuss.<eos> - You agree with him, Ms. Tousignant?<eos> Then you are making a mistake.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> You're the one making a mistake.<eos> See, we've got nothing to lose.<eos> You, on the other hand...<eos> When this is all gone, don't say we didn't give you a chance.<eos> - So Delavane just stonewalled you guys?
I'm betting whatever you two are up to, innocent people are gonna get hurt.<eos> Don't worry, I remember our deal.<eos> You leave me alone, I make sure no one dies.<eos> All right.<eos> You're a criminal, Snart, but you live by a code.<eos> It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't, like he won't care if people die.<eos> That's why I can't leave this alone.<eos> Then everyone will know who The Flash is under that mask.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I will take you down anyway.
There have always been rumours.<eos> Stories passed from traveller to traveller, mutterings about hidden streets, secret pockets of alien life right here on Earth.<eos> Like a smuggler's cove, only not a cove, because it's right here.<eos> Right in the middle of the capital.<eos> - The hidden places are in the Great British Library?<eos> - No. The maps are.<eos> I never put stock in it.<eos> London streets that suddenly disappeared from human view?<eos> No. You lot are always overlooking things, but whole streets?<eos> That would be excessive, even for you.
Hang on. You did this to Rigsy?<eos> What have you done?<eos> This man committed a crime.<eos> - I sentenced him.<eos> - Sentenced him?<eos> I also gave him enough time to return home and say goodbye to his family.<eos> You flooded his brain with retcon!<eos> Till we showed up, he didn't even know he had to say goodbye.<eos> I'm afraid no intruder leaves this place without a memory wipe.<eos> With respect, that will include you.
You will rest.<eos> It will not.<eos> One day, you will linger in the same place too long.<eos> You will sit too still or sleep too deep... .. and when, too late, you rise to go... .. you will notice a second shadow next to yours.<eos> Your life will then be over.<eos> If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very little.<eos> If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all.<eos> So, for your own sake, understand this.<eos> I am the Doctor.<eos> I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.
Clara said I shouldn't take revenge.<eos> You should know, I don't always listen.<eos> Oh, what's this?<eos> Well, are you gardeners?<eos> I hate gardening!<eos> What sort of a person has a power complex about flowers?<eos> It's dictatorship for inadequates.<eos> Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship.<eos> Come on! Chop, chop!<eos> The Doctor will see you now!
Me, exactly as I was... .. when I first got here... .. 7,000 years ago.<eos> All I have to find is some energy.<eos> And all you need for energy... .. is something to burn.<eos> How long can I keep doing this, Clara?<eos> Burning the old me... .. to make a new one?<eos> If you think because she's dead, I am weak, then you understand very little.<eos> If you were any part of killing her and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all.<eos> So, for your own sake, understand this.<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.
Welcome home, sir.<eos> As commander of the armed forces of Gallifrey, I bring you the greetings of the High Council<eos> 'Who the hell does he think he is? '<eos> The man who won the Time War, sir.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> What does he want?<eos> Revenge?<eos> The Doctor does not blame Gallifrey for the horrors of the Time War.<eos> I should hope not.<eos> He just blames you.
- Afraid!<eos> - You were entrapped and imprisoned at his command.<eos> And look at him now.<eos> Why did you banish him?<eos> Was it punishment?<eos> Or for your own protection?<eos> Or are you just being cruel?<eos> Or just being cowardly?<eos> Let's see, shall we?<eos> If you wanted to know about the Hybrid, why didn't you just ask me?
- Many prophesies suggest...<eos> - No.<eos> All... Matrix prophecies concur that this creature will one day stand in the ruins of Gallifrey.<eos> It will unravel the web of time and destroy a billion billion hearts to heal its own.<eos> What colour is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Prophecies, they never tell you anything useful, do they?<eos> This is no time to play the fool.<eos> It's the end of the universe. It's the only time I've got.<eos> - And you want me to keep you all safe.
They'll have TARDISes there.<eos> OK, listen...<eos> - I have something I need to say.<eos> - We do not have time.<eos> No, my time. My time is up.<eos> Doctor, between one heartbeat and the last is all the time I have.<eos> People like me and you, we should say things to one another.<eos> And I'm going to say them now...<eos> You're monsters.<eos> Here you are, hiding away at the end of time.
- You will beg my infinite mercy!<eos> - Oh, zip it!<eos> Try to follow me and I'll put him in a blender.<eos> Ramone, now.<eos> They will be tracked.<eos> They will be found.<eos> Ramone!<eos> Just once, can you get the height right?<eos> 'Sorry, Professor.'<eos> When I escape, I will bring terror to you and your family.
He will in fact be joining me to eat.<eos> I was about to suggest that force-feeding might be required.<eos> This way.<eos> Oh, may I take your bag?<eos> Oh, no, that's fine, Thanks.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It was my stomach.<eos> I have an irritable bowel.<eos> My revenge will be merciless!<eos> - I will rip you open and devour you!
You're going to have to dig for it a bit, but somehow I don't think that's going to be a problem for you.<eos> - Is this a deception?<eos> - No.<eos> The diamond is in there.<eos> This is a public place, there won't be any tricks.<eos> This is not a public place.<eos> - Block booking, that's clever.<eos> - You needn't have bothered.<eos> I've brought what you want.<eos> Please do assume that I have also taken precautions, and don't do anything that might make me cross and kill you.
- D'you know what that isn't?<eos> A coincidence. - Your escape plan.<eos> - It's cheaper than a taxi.<eos> - What meteor strike?<eos> 'Alert.<eos> Meteor storm imminent.'<eos> - That meteor strike.<eos> - How could you know?<eos> I'm an archaeologist from the future.<eos> I dug you up.
What will you name the child ?<eos> Tommaso.<eos> Dear parents, in baptizing your son you are pledging to bring him up in faith.
It's a fairytale !<eos> It's the woman's kiss that wakes her up, not the prince's.<eos> She's her love.<eos> - That's as gay as it gets.<eos> - lt's a maternal kiss.<eos> But she's not her mother.<eos> She's a woman who lovingly kisses her.<eos> - It's a lesbian tale, Wilma's right.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> You think everyone's gay.
- Who told me ?<eos> - London told me this morning.<eos> They bailed out at the last minute.<eos> The producers said that without London, there's no film.<eos> So who told you ?<eos> I wanted to be the one to tell you.<eos> You know what showbiz is like... we find out about things before they even happen.<eos> I'm really sorry, Marina.<eos> Don't you worry about me, that's why I came here, to tell you in person.<eos> I feel bad for you, for you all...
Yes.<eos> I gave you my phone number, right ?<eos> You have it.<eos> - Use it.<eos> - Can I call you ?<eos> Whenever you want.<eos> As they say, better late than never.<eos> My license got revoked, so I have to take the exam again.<eos> Let me guess, reckless driving ?<eos> Why don't you mind your own business ?
- Marina's a woman. - So ?<eos> There's no competition, or rivalry.<eos> If anything it's a turn-on.<eos> Carry the roast beef.<eos> Here you go !<eos> This isn't any roast beef, this is THE roast beef !<eos> I learned to make it when I was studying in London.<eos> - It's all I can cook. - I don't cook much.<eos> But I make a killer baked fish.<eos> Good, that's one more reason to invite you to the beach house.
Hello!<eos> Operator?<eos> Operator!<eos> Shizuko.<eos> Why...<eos> Why did you do this to us?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't you see how beautiful you have grown to be?<eos> Yeon-deok...<eos> It was all for you girls.
Why?<eos> What happened? What did I do?<eos> It was nothin', you spit out a couple of teeth.<eos> I think they were wisdom teeth, so they were comin' out anyway.<eos> I got a spare set of dentures there if you need 'em.<eos> I'll survive.<eos> Thanks though.<eos> I think El Brujo was tryin' to give me a sign from, wherever he is, or just tryin' to burn the hell out me, 'cause this thing is still really hot.<eos> Hey buddy, I'm really sorry about your uncle.<eos> I'm sorry to both of you.
Then let's go back there and end it all.<eos> You know I'm down, the last thing I want every Deadite to see - is this ugly mug.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But...<eos> Thing is, you can't go with me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> No, this is the end of the road.<eos> I've put your lives in too much danger already.<eos> And this cabin, if you go there, you'd end up possessed and I would have to kill you both and cut your heads off and that would just be bad everybody.
I didn't know what to make of it. - It was confusing.<eos> - Shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean I really... I just don't remember any of it.<eos> So was any of that a part of you? Or was it all the demon?<eos> You two fun bags almost done?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now, if... and I mean if... I let you come with me back to the cabin, there's one place I have to stop first.
Easy, pal. We're not gonna kill anybody.<eos> Get you all fixed up.<eos> Okay, first things first...<eos> - Get away from him!<eos> - What?<eos> He's one of those things, isn't he?<eos> ! He's one of those things!<eos> So... who the fuck are you guys, and why are you roaming around my camp?<eos> Uh, first off, apologies.<eos> I guess we caught you guys at something of an inconvenient time.
What's out there knows that you're alive, and it wants you to be... un-alive.<eos> I know exactly what we're dealing with.<eos> Big Brother put a virus in our air supply. Turned Lem into some sort of... mummy!<eos> Well, that's a new one.<eos> Yeah, yeah, but we were ready for it.<eos> Were ya, okay.<eos> Wow. You guys are survivalists.<eos> Here's how you survive.<eos> Give us our weapons back, and get the fuck out of our way.<eos> I'm gonna get you!
Give us our weapons back, and get the fuck out of our way.<eos> I'm gonna get you!<eos> Oh, why don't you come out, you motherfuckin' piece of shit?<eos> Come on, I'll kill you myself!<eos> Probably not the best idea, Kel.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> That's how I know you.<eos> You was at the lockup when I was tossed in a few years ago!<eos> She's a cop!<eos> So who the fuck are you guys really, huh?
I would stay away from there if I were you.<eos> No looking for your input, tough guy.<eos> See?<eos> Lance!<eos> Lance!<eos> No, you motherfucker!<eos> We need to get the fuck out of here!<eos> You ain't goin' nowhere.<eos> Enjoy!<eos> Maybe your old friend Lem will find you down there.
Well, maybe I'll find a cute bear.<eos> Yeah, doubt that.<eos> So you go about a half mile down that track, cabin's right there, can't miss it.<eos> Good lookin' out, man.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, you know, you guys shouldn't be wanderin' around these woods alone at night.<eos> Oh, we're fine.<eos> We're at one with nature.<eos> Well I mean, we could stay, one night, you know, maybe.<eos> Thanks man, but we're all good, and nice meetin' you guys. - Thank you.
You fool!<eos> She's gonna die.<eos> You already killed her!<eos> Yeah? You always talk too much!<eos> Amanda, we knew who you were the first time we saw ya.<eos> We knew you were gonna try and help Ash.<eos> You won't be helping him now.<eos> You won't be helping anyone.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> We're gonna send you all back!
Coming?<eos> I'll put Leo to bed.<eos> I won't even ask how you are.<eos> Don't remember me?<eos> Do you?<eos> This is new for me.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Me neither.<eos> - Are you staying for dinner?<eos> - I'll leave you to it.
Keep pulling.<eos> No!<eos> Don't kill him!<eos> You're not supposed to be in there! Hey!<eos> No, no, no, no! No, no, no!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Come on!<eos> 10K, help Murphy!<eos> Addy, I need you.<eos> All right, I'll meet you.
Shit!<eos> It was half.<eos> Jesus, it was more than half.<eos> We just gotta stay ahead of them.<eos> They walk, we run.<eos> - Rick!<eos> - I'm here.<eos> What's going on back there?<eos> Half of them broke off. They're going toward Alexandria.<eos> Towards you?
You got a reason for asking?<eos> Next intersection we're gonna spin around and go back.<eos> The plan is to go 15 more.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna change that.<eos> Five's gonna have to work.<eos> The magic number's 20. That's the mission.<eos> That's making sure they're off munching on infirm raccoons the rest of their undead lives instead of any of us.<eos> You want to go, we can't stop you.<eos> But without you, they could stop us.<eos> Nah, I got faith in you.
It's my plan.<eos> It's on me.<eos> You have a wife, Glenn.<eos> That's why I'm doing this.<eos> You've got to get everybody back.<eos> You're the one who can.<eos> If I take too long, you just go.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.<eos> - That is not the way this works.<eos> - I will meet you there.
I think that's how far we're ahead of the herd.<eos> I'm gonna try to set a fire and distract them.<eos> If you don't see smoke, they're still coming your way.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Good luck, dumbass.<eos> That'll keep you going until we get you back to the infirmary.<eos> Annie, I'm gonna figure out a crutch for you.<eos> Just leave me.<eos> What?<eos> I'm slowing you down.
It's that simple.<eos> Leave me.<eos> Leave us.<eos> No.<eos> It's stupid for you guys to wait on me.<eos> We'll all go down.<eos> Come on, man, wake up.<eos> You don't want to do it now, you do it out there.<eos> We get into trouble again, you run.<eos> - And you don't look back.
No one is leaving anyone behind.<eos> I'm gonna find something for you, Annie.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you have a problem with me?<eos> I'm just looking out for my people.<eos> And you think that I'm not?<eos> Look, I heard what Rick said.<eos> Which part?<eos> How they wouldn't all make it.<eos> They meaning us and not you.
Hey.<eos> Do you have a problem with me?<eos> I'm just looking out for my people.<eos> And you think that I'm not?<eos> Look, I heard what Rick said.<eos> Which part?<eos> How they wouldn't all make it.<eos> They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
What are you on about?<eos> Our parents or... your big low-tide break-up?<eos> Pack some boxes.<eos> There are papers I don't want left out.<eos> - OK.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> "Big low-tide break-up?"<eos> The bastard!<eos> Nicole, Jean-Pierre, we had a drink for you.
Already?<eos> Can you be alone with her?<eos> - Well...<eos> - No, bad idea.<eos> Why?<eos> Afraid of his reaction?<eos> It's not the time. You're not her father.<eos> Come and stay 24 hours, so she gets used to it.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll pick you up from the train.
Get me a glass of water.<eos> What you wrote about me and your father...<eos> Your mother's silences, respecting decorum, fearing scandal...<eos> What's that called?<eos> You don't get it?<eos> Cowardice.<eos> What else did you do with Emma?<eos> Your father couldn't jump into things.<eos> Exactly like you.<eos> You know, Aurélien, people can't spend their lives waiting for you.
Time is a most aggressive foe, Milus.<eos> Favor of my rule changes with the wind.<eos> The unrest that grows on this damp rock...<eos> I need to make my gains now, while I still hold the king's trust.<eos> Wealth, my lord, is the foundation of any temple of power.<eos> We need to fortify our resources.<eos> Steeper taxes and tariffs.<eos> Yes, agreed.<eos> Pardon, Lord Ventris, good Chamberlain.<eos> Baron Pryce's emissary waits for you at the market.
How many?<eos> Seven.<eos> You expect your baron to believe that a pox-dowed band of farmers have skill enough to knell our noble ranks?<eos> He should.<eos> His ranks seem only fit to strike women and children!<eos> Kill them all.<eos> Burn it to the ground.<eos> You devils!<eos> You curs!<eos> They will hunt you down and cut out your stone hearts!
An unlikely ally in our fight.<eos> Let him know there may come a time when I collect on this favor.<eos> Toran, Moor!<eos> You crazy witch!<eos> To what end does this devilry serve?<eos> The baron has returned?<eos> No. But I have news of his need.<eos> At Heaven's Eye, we saw the rebel symbols.<eos> Lord Ventris sent me back to secure more troops.<eos> Sent you back?
A reminder of my need for faith.<eos> Your soldier gave the impression it distinguished you for some time.<eos> Yet, the burn looks fresh.<eos> I renew the vow when my faith wavers.<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> Yea.<eos> An angry branch on last night's ride.<eos> May I?<eos> In here, milady?<eos> No better one to heal you than Him.
- Bullshit.<eos> He's the only one who got out of that shop, which means either the Nazis got sloppy, which they do not do, or they wanted him to escape because he's one of them.<eos> It's real.<eos> Believe me now?<eos> He helped me. He tried to warn you about your name on that list.<eos> He used you. He used you to get to the Man In the High Castle. Why else would he be here?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm a Nazi... then why do I bring this?<eos> Film's good.<eos> If you make it back to town, the Marshal will kill you.
Margaux with an X?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Right? And then it's Agnyss with a Y.<eos> Hi. I'm Barry.<eos> I haven't yet...<eos> Hi. - Bianca. - Bian...<eos> It's just... Hi. How's it going?<eos> - My man. How's it going?<eos> - Yes. Thanks for being here.<eos> You guys, I'm so excited. I'm so excited to hear you play.
Don't move!<eos> Don't lie to her!<eos> She stays in hotels a lot.<eos> Why would she do that when she's got this place?<eos> What was that?<eos> Just an S.U.V.<eos> It's nice to see you again, Alex.<eos> Good to see you, too, Shelby.<eos> You could have waited till I got home.<eos> I would have let you in.
She's from your part of the world.<eos> Mm, what do I get for it? Ooh. Snacks.<eos> Plenty of them.<eos> All the sunchips and combos the vending machine can offer.<eos> Hand it over. I'll take a look.<eos> Did you ever think, if we're vetting them, who vetted us?<eos> Hey. Danny?<eos> Amin, right?<eos> One of two?<eos> When I first saw you, I thought it was odd that none of our class vetted you.
It's a blind spot.<eos> There's plenty of them in the city, but they're not very big... 5 to 10 feet.<eos> Somebody must have been waiting in one to take her.<eos> If the terrorist really is in the FBI, they'd know about them.<eos> Okay, we need help.<eos> We need someone who can leave this building without being noticed.<eos> I guess a lot happened after I got thrown out.<eos> We're holding three of Alex's conspirators, and you're both still free. How did that happen?<eos> What do you want, little man?<eos> Can we trust you? Can we trust you?
Turns out I have a type.<eos> Pathological liars.<eos> Wait, what'd he lie about?<eos> You know what?<eos> You don't have to answer that.<eos> We shouldn't even be having this conversation.<eos> Relationships are forbidden at Quantico for a reason.<eos> They knock you off your game. Absolutely.<eos> Especially when your game is playing Hoover and Clyde Tolson in the boiler room and Clyde's dad catches you.<eos> Oh, my God. All right, if Caleb's father wanted to bust you guys, you'd be in front of the N.A.R.B. by now.
Vasquez, you are a go.<eos> FBI!<eos> FBI!<eos> Don't move!<eos> - On the ground! - Get on the ground right now!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out! We're blown!<eos> All right, stay back.<eos> Come on! Let's go! Let's go!<eos> We kidnapped you two.
Yeah, drugging and framing me?<eos> Since you knew the bomber modeled his stuff off of my work?<eos> And given everything you'd done in your life...<eos> Instead of taking responsibility for yourself, you decided my life for yours was a pretty fair trade.<eos> The FBI had enough circumstantial evidence.<eos> I just had to point them in your direction.<eos> So I pretended to sleep in my office, slipped my tail.<eos> You're despicable.<eos> I wanted you to find Simon.<eos> I brought you here because I want you to try and stop this bomb.
- Hey, they're not broke.<eos> - They're just not part of the 1% anymore.<eos> I feel kind of guilty.<eos> I'm the one they bailed out last year.<eos> Yeah, but you've only been around for a few years.<eos> Think about me and Toby.<eos> If they didn't have to pay for art supplies, and Buckner, and music equipment...<eos> Yeah, they could own their own island by now.<eos> They're still paying my tuition, so I better go make it worth their pain.<eos> I'll see you guys later.
Hey, who cares, right?<eos> I guess.<eos> Like cowboys say.<eos> Heyo!<eos> Oh, there they are!<eos> Oh, look at that belly!<eos> - Doesn't she look amazing? - Hi.<eos> Oh, it's so good to see you.<eos> It's been too long.<eos> It's good to see you, too. Oh, hello in there.
- Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I think I got a bull to tame.<eos> Toby.<eos> What?<eos> He was just saying hello.<eos> He clearly has a thing for you, and we both know you had a thing for him. Had.<eos> Past tense.<eos> And like I've told you a thousand times, nothing happened.<eos> Then how come every time I see you two together, you totally seem into each other?
Anyway...<eos> I should go.<eos> Good luck with the festival and everything.<eos> Hey, thanks so much for coming by.<eos> We know it's late.<eos> It's cool.<eos> We wanted to talk to you, too.<eos> Us first. Um...<eos> Kathryn and I have done a lot of thinking about your dilemma, and... We've realized that if you're gonna stay in Kansas City, you will need a lot more from us than just baby clothes.<eos> We want you to know that we will be with you every step of the way.
Watching him die like this isn't quite the same as, oh, let's say, holding the woman you love in your arms while she breathes her last breath.<eos> But, hey... it's the best I could do on such short notice.<eos> He's trying to get in your head.<eos> The video is fake.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Hey, professor.<eos> Where you been?<eos> If I don't call off my men in the next 30 seconds,<eos> Dr. Andrew Garner, the ex-Mr. May, is a dead man.<eos> All you have to do is put your weapons down, - and I'll let you go.
If I cannot, I will do it myself.<eos> Come on, Bacco.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Undo the chain, quickly!<eos> It's okay, it's okay... it's okay, I got you.<eos> It's gonna be okay, all right?<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
- My associates and I are doing a little something-something tonight.<eos> We could use the manpower.<eos> - Is what you do against the law?<eos> - Not if you're a zebra in a cage.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> - And if we do help you?<eos> - Then it's simple.<eos> You wash my back, and I fly yours the hell out of the country one step ahead of whoever it is that's chasing you.
If I cannot, I will do it myself.<eos> Come on, bacco.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Undo the chain, Quickly!<eos> It's okay, It's okay... It's okay, I got you.<eos> It's gonna be okay, all right?<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
Of course.<eos> Look, give me about 10 more minutes here and I'm done.<eos> Hey, no rush.<eos> Thank you very much, by the way.<eos> He didn't say anything?<eos> He was evasive.<eos> - Can we get back to this?<eos> - Evasive how? What were his words exactly?<eos> He said what you said.<eos> That you guys were fighting and that he didn't want to get into it with me.
I want to have that experience myself.<eos> I want all those moments that parents get.<eos> This has only just started... And I'm starting to think I made a huge mistake.<eos> - Please don't tell Toby that I've said that.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> It is completely normal to have doubts and be scared.<eos> You're not a monster for feeling that way.<eos> One thing that I know for sure... Is that this is gonna be your kid.<eos> Not your Down syndrome kid but your kid.<eos> And you are gonna love him or her with everything that you have, once you two meet.
Why do you want to rebuild the portal, jemma?<eos> We're gonna get him back.<eos> I saw something.<eos> Lash can turn into a person.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> He could be anybody.<eos> I know you really want to get back into action, Agent Morse, - but the answer's no.<eos> - Understood, sir.<eos> If I don't call off my men, Dr. Andrew Garner is a dead man.<eos> All you have to do is put your weapons down, and I'll let you go.
- Everyone had a lot going on.<eos> - Daphne, Nacho affects me too!<eos> - I had a right to know!<eos> - You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Let's go open some presents.<eos> Bay...<eos> I just hate that Bay found out that way.<eos> She'll be happy for you eventually.
- Looks like you did Bay in.<eos> - Ha. She was a wonderful hostess.<eos> - So how'd we make out in the loot department?<eos> - It'll probably cost a bundle to ship it all to London.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Sorry, babe.<eos> Cat's out of the bag.<eos> I was working up to it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm happy for you.
- Yeah, that's great.<eos> Yeah, I mean, the both of you guys. I'm, like, the heathen up in this house.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - Please don't say that.<eos> You're a spiritual person. You just don't have - a practice...<eos> - A practice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> ... that's personal.<eos> What kind of stuff do you pray about?<eos> Oh, I pray for you guys, for the pregnancy, obviously, um, my family back in Overland Park, and Rita a lot.
- I got it.<eos> Children, tickets, 25 dollars each.<eos> Hey, you want some raffle tickets?<eos> Nobody forced you to do it.<eos> Hi, Sarah.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Hi, Melanie. I'm good.<eos> How are you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Nice to see you.
Back in the day, guys got outta line, they'd chop 'em up, send 'em to the four corners of the county. So nobody could find 'em.<eos> Or piece together the truth.<eos> The bone-scattering.<eos> Chokbaak, remember?<eos> This is gonna get messy.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> Los hermanos Gecko.<eos> I found you in a six-by-nine.<eos> And you... I found you in the woods.<eos> I made you.
It's good.<eos> I graduate in May with a degree in ancient philosophy.<eos> Ancient philosophy?<eos> Um, what happened to your dream of being J.T.'s back-up dancer?<eos> Oh, that's still plan B, obviously.<eos> It is so lovely to see you two.<eos> Really, it's been far too long.<eos> Well, Thea and I were glad you got in touch.<eos> Yeah, we were, um, a little surprised, though.<eos> Well, I admit that reconnecting with the son and daughter of one of my dearest friends is not...the only reason that I wanted to see you.
I'm telling you, before the newbie wakes up from surgery, bring in the motherfucker responsible for this!<eos> You heard the man!<eos> Now, it's conspiracy to murder a cop.<eos> Did we find something?<eos> We got something big.<eos> This bastard got paid in US dollars.<eos> Here's a passport and tickets to the Philippines.<eos> We can track the bank that issued the cash.<eos> CCTV from the bank will lead us right to them.<eos> We got you, motherfuckers.
He didn't try to kill himself.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Shut up and sit down!<eos> This is my district, son of a bitch!<eos> You should at least know what crimes you're confessing to.<eos> Bae got beat up by the contractor, Jeon.<eos> You paid him off.<eos> He sent his kid home in a cab.<eos> But Bae... felt so aggrieved and angry.<eos> So, he goes back to find you guys.
! It's a damn Murphy free for all!<eos> I think it's time we need to<eos> Time to go!<eos> ♪ Oh, have mercy. ♪<eos> All right, we split up.<eos> Earl, you're with me.<eos> The rest of you, do what you got to do.<eos> But you make no mistake.<eos> Any of you think you're gonna go bag that buck yourself and go running off with the bounty trust me, cuz as sure as we can find him, we will find you.<eos> And we will cut you open and feed your insides to the dogs.
We got strength in numbers.<eos> Food, water, shelter.<eos> It certainly beats walking, but<eos> But what?<eos> The sick. I highly doubt they're gonna make it to wherever it is that they're going.<eos> Edmonton.<eos> That medical wagon is a zombie bomb waiting to go off.<eos> Three days ago we tangled with some bounty hunters.<eos> Bounty hunters, huh?<eos> "We don't want to kill you," they said.
I cleared them just now.<eos> Seems I might just get my team after all.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Hydra has Fitz and Simmons, and they're planning to open another portal!<eos> Which is why we're going to stop them.<eos> - Yeah, but why us?<eos> - I'm guessing we're all they've got.<eos> You two have powers.<eos> My other agents don't.<eos> But I'm not gonna lie to you...
- We've got to get Deep-Ando!<eos> Where's your friend?<eos> - Deep-Ando?<eos> I dunno. He's... - He's still out there!<eos> 474!<eos> What the hell are they?<eos> Where did they go?<eos> 'Chief Nagata, this is Deep-Ando. Where did you go?<eos> 'Nagata, this is Deep-Ando!<eos> May the Gods look favourably upon you! '
Hey, look...<eos> Paraponera clavata.<eos> Giant tropical bullet ants, ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index.<eos> They're here to keep an eye on you when I can't.<eos> Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.<eos> Who?<eos> Whose pajamas are these?<eos> How am I supposed to do this?<eos> All right, just one step at a time.<eos> You don't bite me, I don't step on you.
Well, the future isn't exact.<eos> - There are many parts...<eos> - Of course there are.<eos> You're willing to send us behind enemy lines, but when it comes to specifics, everything's a little fuzzy, isn't it? !<eos> - Hook, Merlin's helping Emma.<eos> - Is he? ! She's sitting out there right now, making things to pull memories out of people's heads, because that's what she does now instead of sleeping.<eos> I'm not quite seeing the helping!<eos> I understand.<eos> I know what it is to lose someone you love to the Dark One.<eos> All I can ask of all of you is that you bring me that sword and that you have patience with Emma.
I'll get her to leave.<eos> What does she want?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> You always know.<eos> I'll talk to her. Uh, you head back.<eos> Check on the brooms.<eos> Have you come to see me?<eos> You're Merlin?<eos> Not all wizards have long white beards.<eos> Please, tell me. What brings you here?
Please, tell me. What brings you here?<eos> My village...<eos> Uh, I was in my garden when a masked man rode in.<eos> His name is Vortigan.<eos> He ransacks towns, burns them to the ground, so I-I fled on foot to the woods.<eos> I looked back from the hillside, and everything was in flames.<eos> He had killed everyone.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Please, allow me to help you.<eos> What can I grant you?
Mary Margaret!<eos> If you hurt her...<eos> Ooh, daddy's angry.<eos> Let's undo that.<eos> How did...<eos> Well, Arthur was kind enough to remove that constricting jewelry.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'd prefer an even fight.<eos> No, don't! The baby.<eos> You know, if youreed me fairly for once, maybe I wouldn't turn on you.
Feels so good to be back.<eos> Now, about that deal we made.<eos> Shall we get out of here?<eos> Regina, she's still our daughter.<eos> We can't go to war with her.<eos> If you don't have the stomach for this...<eos> I'm not going to hurt her.<eos> This is exactly why she gave me the dagger.<eos> She knew I'm the only one who could do what has to be done.<eos> Now, stand back, or I'll make you stand back.
You took this case without running it by me.<eos> - Jessica--<eos> - That's enough. Dump it. Or I will.<eos> You think this case is a winner?<eos> I do.<eos> Then what do you say we do it together?<eos> (Rachel) I'm afraid you're gonna end up hating each other.
I'd make a great asset.<eos> Forget it.<eos> You talk too much.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, listen.<eos> I can keep quiet.<eos> You won't hear a peep.<eos> Can you take us south to Memphis?<eos> Well hell yes.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll take you to the Gortner Bridge, just north of the city.
We'll put in 24 hours of looking for him.<eos> And then we head West.<eos> It's like my daddy always told me.<eos> Never trust an Eskimo in a windbreaker.<eos> And he would know cuz he was in the Merchant Marines.<eos> You boys lost?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> Matter of fact<eos> Oh, no?<eos> Cuz either you lost or you're trespassing.
And he would know cuz he was in the Merchant Marines.<eos> You boys lost?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> Matter of fact<eos> Oh, no?<eos> Cuz either you lost or you're trespassing.<eos> Which one is it?<eos> Well I was not aware they had changed the property lines since the last time we came through.<eos> Wasn't no last time.<eos> Cuz I woulda recognized you.
Hey, what's the hurry?<eos> Look. We got off on the wrong foot here.<eos> You obviously look like intelligent men with an eye towards progress in future generations.<eos> What if I told you today's your lucky day?<eos> Oh, I would agree.<eos> Ain't that right, Dale?<eos> Oh you right about that.<eos> You're both right.<eos> Cuz it ain't everyday you come in contact with a modern miracle<eos> Your maker's been smiling on you because today I offer you the most rare and precious of currencies.
Wait a second.<eos> That's right. You've got me.<eos> If you're "The Murphy," then let me see you levitate.<eos> Oh come on.<eos> Who said he could levitate?<eos> He can!<eos> Not on an empty stomach.<eos> That's true?<eos> I'll tell you what is true.<eos> He can make you immortal.
Oh come on.<eos> Who said he could levitate?<eos> He can!<eos> Not on an empty stomach.<eos> That's true?<eos> I'll tell you what is true.<eos> He can make you immortal.<eos> What's that?<eos> Reset your odometer.<eos> Make you zombie proof.
How do you feel?<eos> I'm cured!<eos> I'm cured!<eos> Murphy!<eos> You all right?<eos> Takes a little bit out of him every time.<eos> Who's next?<eos> We sure do appreciate this.<eos> Fair is fair.<eos> Now like I said, you're gonna want to rest up for at least 12 hours.
That's what I'm asking.<eos> Well those are the<eos> It doesn't matter!<eos> The point is you're all great people.<eos> You, you're a straight shooter.<eos> You, you're honest to goodness.<eos> You, you're tried and true.<eos> You, salt of the earth.<eos> You, drop dead gorgeous.<eos> What I'm saying here is people, I wouldn't try to distract you with a bunch of random facts and figures of speech cuz you'd smell a fraud from a mile away.
Oh, damn. Check the van.<eos> We got men down, suspect on the loose, transpo bay one.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Security teams, lock down the facility. No one gets in or out.<eos> All agents report to your posts.<eos> All agents. Hey.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> Uh, is this about Nevins? That wicked man gave me what he owed me.<eos> My sister, where is she?<eos> You know, you don't have to fight us, Abbie. There is a place for you two Witnesses in the new world.
It's all right, lads, you can speak your mind.<eos> We're a council, after all.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> We've been at peace for three years.<eos> Best years on Berk I can remember.<eos> I think you know as well as I do that when you go looking for trouble, you usually find it.<eos> I'm with Spitelout.<eos> If that Dragon Eye leads to unknown places and new wild dragons, then no good will come from any of that.<eos> I completely disagree, Sven.<eos> Look around you.
Perfect, a call to action!<eos> Please hold your applause until the end of the rescue.<eos> You may commence.<eos> - Fishlegs... - Fishlegs?<eos> Why does everybody keep calling me Fishlegs?<eos> But you're Fishlegs...<eos> Fishlegs. - Nonsense, crone!<eos> Uhh! People of Berk...<eos> Huh? It is with great pleasure that I announce the arrival of me, Thor Bonecrusher.<eos> The most universally feared and loved Viking in all the land is here to enchant you with my presence.
Come along, lad.<eos> All right, Fishlegs.<eos> Says here you are now the official poet laureate of Thorstonton.<eos> Do you even know what that means?<eos> We were hoping you would!<eos> It's your job, after all.<eos> [Tuffnut] Astrid, you are the official royal brush-clearer.<eos> We don't want Thorstonton burning down, after all.<eos> - Or do we?<eos> - Hmm... I'm not clearing brush for you two!

I'm not clearing brush for you two!<eos> I'm not clearing anything for you two!
No.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> As it turns out, we can't save Thorstonton by ourselves.<eos> So we talked about it, and we hereby decree that you can all come and help us put out the fires.<eos> Ah, that's a shame, 'cause from where I sit, you guys are on your own.<eos> I mean, rules are rules, right?<eos> You have to help us save our island! - It's all we've got!<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Guys?<eos> I think you've got to stick to your guns.
It was here a minute ago!<eos> - What did you do with it, Ruffnut?<eos> - I didn't do anything with it!<eos> You lying she-beast!<eos> You were always jealous of my rock tower.<eos> Your rock tower?<eos> ! It was my rock tower!<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Let's everyone step away from the sharp objects.<eos> Okay, look, maybe this job was just too tough for you to do alone.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> I wouldn't, either.<eos> Heather?<eos> You rolled me into a river!<eos> You trapped me in a cave!<eos> - You left me dangling in a tree!<eos> - And I have to admit, the chicken move brought back some memories.<eos> Guys, now I'm sure Heather has a really good reason for doing what she did.<eos> Look. I've been living on my own out here for years and I made more than few enemies.<eos> I didn't want you guys to be involved.
Unless you have one of these.<eos> You really have to show me how you made that.<eos> Sure, but I prefer close combat to throwing... [grunts] so I can stare my enemy in the eye. Not a bad tactic.<eos> But don't discount...<eos> Hyah! Hmm... the element of surprise. I like that.<eos> It's one of Hiccup's favorite tactics.<eos> So, you two are a thing, right?<eos> No, just friends.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I've seen the way you two are together.
Oh, boy.<eos> - Uh, Hiccup?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Remember what I said about the Titan Wing - Monstrous Nightmare coming back?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Hookfang can't take on that Totan Wing alone.<eos> He won't be alone.<eos> - Neither will you.<eos> - We've gotta do this ourselves.<eos> No way! That thing will tear you apart.
[Hiccup] This changes everything.<eos> [Tuffnut] Oh, my back.<eos> Okay Hiccup, you dragged us all the way up here.<eos> What is it you have to show us?<eos> It better involve food or destruction.<eos> Or a combination of the two.<eos> I bet you're wondering why I brought you here today.
We should do it more often.<eos> Well, I'm not sure how Mitchell would feel about that. Who's Mitchell?<eos> He's the man that I've been seeing for the last six weeks.<eos> He's... he's smart and he's funny and... best of all, he has nothing to do with the practice of law.<eos> I'm happy for you, Donna.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And the reason I told you is so that you'll know that I'm not jealous when I say... you need to tell Louis you've been sleeping with Esther.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> It took me all of two seconds to put it together after I saw you two mooning over each other this morning.
I am to trust a stranger with my child.<eos> There is good in Iseult.<eos> I don't know what is worse, when he cries or when he is still.<eos> When he is still, I feel the need to prod him awake.<eos> - It is retribution.<eos> God is punishing me.<eos> - For what?<eos> For Aethelwold for taking his crown.<eos> Aethelwold is a fool, he could never be king.<eos> Your God is testing you.
Lord?<eos> Good morning, lord.<eos> We received your message and came as quickly as we could.<eos> - Father Beocca?<eos> Is that you? - Yes, lord.<eos> - You are here?<eos> - I am, lord.<eos> - You have brought men.<eos> Wulfhere. - Lord.<eos> - Well, how warming it is to see you all.
- It's good news, Father.<eos> Rejoice.<eos> - (ALFRED) He is well.<eos> He is well. It is true.<eos> He's...<eos> He is well.<eos> He is cool.<eos> He is well, Beocca.<eos> I can feel his heart beating strongly.<eos> - God has not forsaken you, lord.
Are you afraid?<eos> We stand our ground.<eos> We stand our ground.<eos> Run.<eos> Run! Run! Run!<eos> (UHTRED) Now!<eos> Now for the ships.<eos> A new horizon, lord.<eos> A beacon of hope.<eos> God has tested you, lord. He has put you into the fire, as a smith would his steel.
Now there's the Klaus I know.<eos> Can I get you some water or something?<eos> Let me out. It's dawn. I haven't turned back yet.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> I need to find Hayley.<eos> I can feel the curse in your blood.<eos> Something's restraining it, but you could transition at any moment.<eos> Where the hell is that bastard?<eos> Versailles witches, this is an unbearable tragedy.<eos> In the wake of such sorrow, please allow me to bring you under the protection of the ancestors.

Fight back!<eos> She's walking.<eos> When did she start walking?<eos> I missed it.<eos> I missed everything.<eos> What happened?<eos> Is the curse broken?<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> We're safe for now.<eos> Good for you.
You're welcome for the tip.<eos> I suppose I was misguided to believe Hayley's return would ease tensions in this house.<eos> Misguided, delusional, refreshingly optimistic.<eos> You're new.<eos> What is it?<eos> I received some unsettling information.<eos> From Lucien Castle.<eos> I don't trust the source, but I... trust you.<eos> If you fed on this prophetic witch, her blood is still in your system.<eos> If there's a weapon that can kill you, we need to know.
Anyone who would kill me could now come after you.<eos> From now on, I am the only one you can trust.<eos> My memory of Lucien goes back to a time when our family was happy.<eos> Things were good, or as good as they can be for vampires hiding in plain sight.<eos> Everyone in Marseilles was held in the thrall of the count's arrogant son Tristan and his sister...<eos> In hindsight, I could've done more to prevent what was to follow, but then, even an endless life cannot be played in reverse.<eos> It's impressive work, milord.<eos> It's a trifle meant to pass a dull day, but I'll take it along with the word of a friend.<eos> It is as a friend that I come to you now.<eos> There is something I must ask of you.
Hoping to dissuade Lucien, I told him Aurora would not accept his note.<eos> I thought the matter settled.<eos> How could I tell him that Aurora was already in love with another?<eos> But Lucien was a hopeless romantic.<eos> In his desperation, he sought her out.<eos> No.<eos> You were not meant to see this.<eos> I trusted you. Quiet.<eos> I'm meant to be in prayer.<eos> If anyone finds you here...
Perhaps you underestimate Lucien's ambition.<eos> While I doubt he'd have the gall to attack you directly, I believe he might try and find someone else to do it, namely Niklaus.<eos> What makes you so certain that Niklaus would select Lucien over his own family?<eos> From what I hear, he tortured his friend Marcel, cursed the mother of his child, and burned your paramour in front of you, all because he thought it the logical way to defeat his enemy.<eos> With Lucien in his ear, how long before the logical thing is to get rid of you?<eos> Well, how very fortunate, indeed, then,<eos> Niklaus is on his way right now to put Lucien out of our collective misery.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Lucien's seer believes there's an object capable of killing you.
Of course you could.<eos> But you don't have to.<eos> Liam? We're gonna shoot Ashok in the leg with a flare gun.<eos> - Do you want to watch?<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I don't think.<eos> Was that an actual smile?<eos> I haven't been much of a friend today.<eos> That's not fair to you guys.<eos> It really is good to see you.
I can't tonight.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Oh, yeah, okay.<eos> I've just got science stuff.<eos> Stuff I gotta science the stuff out of.<eos> Maybe next time. - Yeah!<eos> Coolio.<eos> - Yeah. But I'm gonna actually skip the coffee and go get a head start, so... - Oh.<eos> - Good to see you guys.
That was not a honeymoon, and you know it.<eos> He really missed you.<eos> He needed his brother, just like I needed mine.<eos> Yeah, well, he's all set up now.<eos> Wait... are you two working together?<eos> That's why you didn't kill Malvado.<eos> You've got something bigger planned, something that gets everyone what they want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two try and hate each other, but...<eos> God keeps bringing you back together.
I expect it shall ruin my tuxedo.<eos> I have had this suit for over a hundred years.<eos> It's proven far more reliable than you, Marcellus.<eos> Relax, all right?<eos> I got this under control. Do you?<eos> I hope so.<eos> That is a nice jacket.<eos> Is this how you people get your kicks, killing each other for sport?<eos> Take your hand off me, or I will tear your arm from its socket.<eos> What I built in this city might seem small to you, but at least my guys have rules.
Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad, Morty.<eos> Here, check this out.<eos> Aah!<eos> Roy, what's wrong? I had a nightmare.<eos> I was with an old man.<eos> He put a helmet on me.<eos> It's just a fever.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> I don't want you missing school on Monday.<eos> I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future.
- Tell that to gearhead's gearsticles.<eos> - You did that!<eos> Wrong!<eos> I'd be playing "Roy" right now.<eos> At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.<eos> I can't believe Rick did this.<eos> - This is the eighth to the last straw.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw it!<eos> I have a better gamble for you guys.
Here it is. This should take me back to my kind.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, um, Fart.<eos> I'm really sorry your name became fart.<eos> - I will be back soon, Morty.<eos> - Really?<eos> After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.<eos> Um, cleansing?<eos> Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life.<eos> To us, you are what you would call a disease.<eos> Wherever we discover you, we cure it.
A-are my grandkids alive?<eos> M-my drink is empty.<eos> - Unity, what's happening?<eos> - Who's Unity?<eos> You kids have nice feet.<eos> Mind if I take a picture?<eos> Gross.<eos> I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer.<eos> Something's happening to Unity.<eos> Do all of you remember who you are?
I watched the same musical you did.<eos> Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?<eos> Why did all the drinks have to be extra large?<eos> Oh, the hulk. I just got that.<eos> Just pee your pants.<eos> I did it the minute we got stuck.<eos> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.<eos> At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.<eos> Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine.<eos> I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be.
You guys hold tight.<eos> Scary stuff, huh?<eos> Pretty freaky.<eos> Hi. I'm Morty's math teacher.<eos> I'm also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.<eos> How is praying going to help?<eos> Ma'am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather.<eos> Did you want to play checkers?<eos> Let's be rational!<eos> I'll see you at God's house!
I don't know what to say.<eos> Summer is doing really well here.<eos> She's aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.<eos> She's not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew.<eos> Please help me.<eos> You can reach me if you try.<eos> Please help me!<eos> That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving.<eos> Taco time!<eos> I hope it pleases you as the head desires.
After 988 seasons of "Planet Music", the cromulons have decided to declare earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - We did it! Yes!<eos> Let's get a music album now!<eos> Did he just say "musical reality show"?<eos> Yeah, it's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all.<eos> Help!<eos> We should go get him.<eos> I hope I can call on you and Rick again if I need you, Morty.
Huh. That's a step up.<eos> We have no leaders.<eos> We follow only the will of the forest.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Wow.<eos> - Gaaaaay.<eos> - That is pretty gay.<eos> You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing.<eos> Come with me into the forest.<eos> There is something I wish to teach you.
I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.<eos> I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.<eos> If this works, drinks are on me.<eos> If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower.<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Opium addict.<eos> All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up.<eos> You guys are the [bleep] worst!<eos> Your gods are a lie!<eos> [Bleep] you, [bleep] nature, and [bleep] trees!
I don't give a shit!<eos> [gunfire] Okay, Morty, now you're just shooting corpses.<eos> - How do you like this?<eos> - Okay, buddy. All right.<eos> That's good.<eos> Good job.<eos> [ Screams ]<eos> [weapon charging ]<eos> Wait, stop! Please, don't kill me!<eos> I-I never intended to harm you, I swear.
There's only room for one goofy dog there and his name is Pluto.<eos> Todd, no.<eos> I've told the bees if they see you to sting you on sight.<eos> You understand. It's nothing personal.<eos> It's just good business.<eos> And that's how we do business on Urf.<eos> -I don't like you like this.<eos> -I learned it from you.<eos> If I could get everyone's attention.<eos> You're probably wondering why I invited you all here tonight.
-It truly is a small world after all!<eos> -Alex, is that true?<eos> Okay, yes.<eos> It's true.<eos> I was a deep-cover KGB operative before I went into my coma.<eos> I've been trying to contact my handler in Russia, but I can't reach him and I don't know if I ever will.<eos> He's- - It's not adorable!<eos> He's a soviet sleeper-agent who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.<eos> I felt totally alone in this world before I met Wanda.<eos> And then I met all of you, my friends.

It's a snake that eats itself.<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> Hey, buddy, let's just say we- - Oh!<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Gabe Jr.!<eos> Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!<eos> Jump to safety!<eos> No!<eos> Bees, help!<eos> Your queen commands you!
-Oh, shit.<eos> Hey.<eos> -Hey. I'm no good with funerals.<eos> When I cry, it messes up my makeup and then I get really bummed out.<eos> Yeah, same for me. Herb told me you came by the house last summer.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did he tell you anything else?<eos> No, we talked about cancer, how hard it is living with cancer, about the L.A. Kings, and then back to cancer.<eos> -Probably--<eos> -Then I read that chapter in your book about how he never forgave you and he tried to kick you out of the house and you ended up wrestling on the floor over a telescope.
Special delivery. Courtesy of the Toad-man.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, why'd you roll up your sleeves like that?<eos> You look weird.<eos> Oh, I--<eos> Well, you know, I was-- I was trying out a new look.<eos> It was- - It was a dumb idea. Yup.<eos> -Here's your Squirt, sir.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> And if that happens, I want you to take care of each other.
- Todd? Will you make us kiss?<eos> - What?<eos> - Make us kiss, Todd.<eos> We want to be kissing.<eos> We must do kisses to each other.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> Where did your dad go?<eos> When he heard me peeing, it made him have to pee.<eos> - So, that's what he's doing now.<eos> Peeing. - Okay. Weird, I still haven't seen the two of you together.
We're having a good time.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Can't just say, "I don't love you" to someone.<eos> - You said it to me.<eos> - Yeah, but that was different.<eos> - How was that different?<eos> - Because you do love me.<eos> Right? - Like a little bit?<eos> - No.<eos> Uh, for what it's worth, I love both you guys.
We've actually met before.<eos> At Chris Martin's holiday party?<eos> We stepped outside for a smoke? - To get away from Chris Martin? - Huh.<eos> You opened up about your fear of success?<eos> I gave you some advice? You said I was a true friend and you would never forget me?<eos> And you said your name was Chadwick Boseman?<eos> - BoJack Horseman.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> When you're as famous as I am, you meet so many people.<eos> Sorry, we need you guys back on set.
- Are you asking me to throw the game?<eos> - You don't care about this game.<eos> The only reason you're here is for me, so maybe you could help me out?<eos> - Okay. - You know what?<eos> You're the best, no matter what everybody on this app says.<eos> They say you're the worst.<eos> Especially Queefburglar69.<eos> He's their leader.<eos> And we're back.<eos> Contestants, I've got a history question for both of you.
Look alive, bright eyes.<eos> It's the morning and somebody loves you.<eos> Right back at you, buddy.<eos> - Oh, my God. He's here. - There he is.<eos> - I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter.<eos> - I love you, too.
- Copernicus is a fraud!<eos> - A fraud? Me? Ow.<eos> - Aah.<eos> - I had such high hopes for you, Todd.<eos> Normally, I'd make a perfectly timed butt joke here, but as you can see, I don't have my book.<eos> - Guards, take this subversive to the Yes And room.<eos> - No.<eos> - Hey, what are you doing?<eos> No.<eos> Shame on all of you!
I need to take suggestions.<eos> Okay, well, here's a suggestion, your name is Todd.<eos> You're 24, you live on my couch and you've always seen the good in me somehow.<eos> You've been brainwashed into thinking that you belong here, but you don't. You belong back home.<eos> If you're any kind of improviser, you'll take that suggestion and you'll run with it.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I'm afraid that getting out of here is not an option.<eos> - You've seen too much.<eos> - What the hell are you gonna do about it?<eos> - Stop you. With these.
I don't want that.<eos> You're responsible for your own happiness, Barry.<eos> Forget about Wells.<eos> Think hard about what you want and what makes you happy.<eos> Go out and get it.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And look at their eyes. Amazing.<eos> Oh, good to see you guys.
Be advised.<eos> Known suspect is armed.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You hear?<eos> What's all that crying?<eos> And you, shut up!<eos> All right?<eos> I need quiet!<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you I want you to behave.
Well, it's quite simple really.<eos> I find being in your company again wonderfully intoxicating.<eos> So my question is do you feel the same?<eos> Nik, I am not your enemy, nor Rebekah's.<eos> After all, she's my sire, but I do hate Elijah, given what he's done to me and to you.<eos> So you choose to ally with the brother who locked you in a prison and the stable boy who, until now, was always so far beneath you?<eos> You know, the 3 of us spent 100 years working together and running together, believing we were the Mikaelsons, and you knew your father.<eos> It was no easy task to avoid him, and yet we survived, and when the compulsion ended, it was as if someone had peeled off our skin.<eos> We lost everything of who we were and what we'd become in a single moment, and even though we now knew we were little more than an elaborate red herring,<eos> Mikael was still after us, so Tristan swore he wouldn't rest until we made you pay.

How rude.<eos> Nonsense, luv.<eos> My brother merely wishes to make certain we're all on the same page, so who would like to begin?<eos> Well, Lucien and I have always loathed each other.<eos> Had we arrived as allies with news of a bleak future, you would have doubted us.<eos> We sought to remove suspicion by maintaining appearances.<eos> Oh, my. Dear, these pathetic lies promise to be as difficult to swallow as your stuffing this year, Niklaus.<eos> - Walnuts.<eos> Honestly.<eos> - Ha ha ha! The bottom line is, we came to protect you and ourselves.
We lost a century to compulsion, my love, and some of us lost a great deal more.<eos> Surely you can't believe we'd allow ourselves to come here vulnerable.<eos> My dearest Aurora, compulsion is not my only party trick.<eos> I do not like these threats.<eos> Our continued existence depends on the Mikaelsons.<eos> We've known that since Finn and Kol died.<eos> Unfortunately, so does every other vampire in the world.<eos> Given that the sire lines have declared war against one another, you can imagine how many young upstarts have come to the same conclusion... kill an Original, wipe out an entire line of rivals.<eos> Heavy burden, isn't it, the lives of thousands of sired vampires resting on your shoulders?<eos> In a perfect world, you'd allow us to seal you away forever, thus eliminating the threat.
With all the nauseating dinner theater we've endured throughout the centuries, these performances are, by far, the worst.<eos> Aurora, my sister...<eos> Aurora is quite aware of our desire to see Rebekah home, and I'm sure she'll do everything in her power to oblige.<eos> We're welcoming our enemies to the dinner table now?<eos> Convenient, given she's the one who has the answers I want.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, now I have to deal with the long-lost sister?<eos> Nik, please spare me your family's rage and paranoia.<eos> It is exactly this kind of lunacy which led me to steal Rebekah in the first place.<eos> What did you do with her?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, luv, but this prophecy has you all acting as fools, and I've no intention of risking my life to foolishness.
We call them Ghosts for a reason.<eos> But I got air support coming in on number two.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> Oliver?<eos> Oliver?<eos> He's all right, Felicity.<eos> We need eyes back on our target.<eos> I'll give you one better than that.<eos> 20 feet ahead.<eos> I got one gift-wrapped for you.
That's what makes it so much fun.<eos> You know I would show you no mercy if given the opportunity.<eos> That's why I take great care not to give you the opportunity.<eos> Next time I'll take your head off.<eos> My liege, two foreigners are here.<eos> One of them claims to be the daughter of Ra's al Ghul.<eos> No, I am his daughter.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Sister-in-law.<eos> What brings you to Nanda Parbat?
It is the shortest story in history.<eos> Two guys go take on criminals without asking for back-up and nearly get killed in the process.<eos> You know, I haven't said anything up till now, because I was hoping that the two of you would remove your heads from your own asses without assistance.<eos> Turns out I was wrong.<eos> Hey! No, no!<eos> This is the part where I talk and you two listen.<eos> The both of you nearly got killed out there tonight because you didn't have each other's backs.<eos> That was a one-time deal, Felicity, it won't happen again.<eos> I absolutely agree.<eos> Because the two of you are going to sit down here until you have resolved your issues.
Since always.<eos> Ok, I have multiple questions.<eos> Ok, obviously there's a very long explanation to this.<eos> The short version is that I work with the Green Arrow, this man is trying to kill me-- well, us, sorry-- and I'm taking us down to the only place that we're going to be safe.<eos> The lobby?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> You have a hidden floor.<eos> We should be safe here, but just in case...<eos> Aaah! I think I know where I can find the Green Arrow.<eos> Which means that offer about not killing you is off the table.
Ok, I had a little bit of help from a co-worker, but to be honest, he was more freaked out than I was.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Yes, he's fine. I sent him to Starling General.<eos> And he only knows about my secret, not yours.<eos> If he can trace the cards back here, can we use the cards to trace back to him?<eos> That is exactly what Curtis, my freaked-out co-coworker, was doing when...<eos> I got something.<eos> He's headed for the Star City expressway, probably high-tailing his way back to Central City.<eos> Too bad he's not going to make it.<eos> I will see you all dead before I let you do this!
Allison, tell the truth.<eos> We alone right now?<eos> As far as I know.<eos> No hidden microphones?<eos> No listeners in the next room waving their magic listening wands?<eos> Not that I'm aware of, no.<eos> Well, fuck it if they are.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Rachmaninoff.<eos> Fuck you!
Target's on site.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We've got multiple Tangos, move!<eos> Move out!<eos> You ok?<eos> The training, the equipment, those were cops.<eos> And no, I'm not ok.<eos> You have got to be kidding me.<eos> Oh, no, um, not to complain, but you do know that you just brought a police captain into our secret lair?<eos> Don't worry; I got enough to put you away for 25 years.
Thea, I don't know if that city exists anymore.<eos> I think that it might be beyond saving.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> That I don't have to run for mayor.<eos> I'm sorry, baby, but you're not her.<eos> You're not her.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad, what the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm doing what I got to do.<eos> You got not idea what terrible things I would do for both of you.
War strategy, theoretical tactics, sun tzu, nothing in the sprawling history of conflict was overlooked.<eos> We taught them about thermopylae, about the unbeatable spartans.<eos> Xerxes wanted to steal Greece from the spartans.<eos> His forces numbered in the thousands.<eos> Why didn't xerxes just sail around them?<eos> Xerxes wanted to send a message, John.<eos> He failed and just 300 spartans saved Greece.<eos> Yes!<eos> That is all for today.<eos> But tomorrow I will tell you about wolves.
What was that?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Every time.<eos> It's The Flash.<eos> Did I know we knew The Flash?<eos> We know The Flash. Okay.<eos> - I didn't know we knew The Flash.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But I don't think you ran all the way here to protect us.<eos> No, not to protect you.
Not one I can think of.<eos> I just moved to Central City six months ago.<eos> Why'd you move there?<eos> I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.<eos> Kendra, there is a reason this guy's after you.<eos> Think.<eos> Look, man, we just came out here to hide out for a bit until we figure things out, so you can just take it down...<eos> You came here because you need our help.<eos> This is what my help looks like.<eos> Oliver, I just saved you guys from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls was about to do.
Look, I don't want her to know about my powers.<eos> I have this great thing going with her.<eos> She laughs at my jokes, and she loves movies, and...<eos> I just-<eos> - I've never felt like this before, and I don't want to sabotage it.<eos> I get the feeling.<eos> Look!<eos> I will always find you, Chay-Ara.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - Then how will I kill you all?
Soul mates.<eos> We've been partners for 4,000 years.<eos> We're drawn to each other in each life, and after we die, we reincarnate to find each other again and again and again.<eos> And now that I've found you, we should really get out of here.<eos> Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes?<eos> These people cannot protect you from Savage any longer.<eos> Do you know who Vandal Savage is?<eos> In every lifetime, he hunts us down and kills us.<eos> He's done it 206 times, and I'm not planning to make it 207.<eos> Why does he kill you?
I just never thought I'd have superpowers and feel more powerless than I ever have in my entire life.<eos> That part I understand.<eos> But you have already helped Kendra.<eos> You have kept her alive.<eos> So now let's help her get her wings, and then she can give you a lift back to Central City.<eos> Central City.<eos> - What?<eos> - You need to check Central City for the staff.<eos> Kendra, you said you were drawn there. - Yeah.<eos> - I think you're drawn to things that destroy you the same way you two are drawn to each other.
Why, Hannah?<eos> We were friends.<eos> That was before you freed Metatron...<eos> Before... The other angels, they hate you.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Do you hate me?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We took a vote -- democracy in action -- and...<eos> Hannah's doing the job.<eos> I won't give you Sam and Dean.
Run!<eos> We have to go.<eos> Now.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Sorry, dear.<eos> There's no time for chitchat.<eos> Come on.<eos> Baker is down.<eos> I repeat, Baker is down.<eos> Target is coming to you.
You cannot be an effective candidate for mayor and Darhk's undercover stooge. Taking down Darhk is more important, especially now that we know he has Andy under his thumb.<eos> First, there is a whole long list of things that we don't know about Andy.<eos> Second, you didn't decide to run for mayor to take down Darhk.<eos> You did it to give the city something that the Green Arrow can't give them-- Hope.<eos> Inspiration.<eos> Don't lose sight of that.<eos> Not even for John.<eos> This man betrayed us.<eos> He sent an innocent man, a useful man to his grave.<eos> He conspired against me, you, all of his brothers.
You know, when I first found out about the Flash, and the Lazarus Pit and what it did for Thea... I began to daydream about Andy being back.<eos> I would just play with that idea.<eos> My brother's back.<eos> I never thought it would actually happen. I know.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Hi, Lyla.<eos> Hi, Oliver.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll, um, give you two a minute.
Gentlemen, you all come here from different walks, different paths.<eos> But all burdened with the same knowledge-- that this world is diseased.<eos> Fortunately, there is a cure for this pestilence.<eos> That cure, gentlemen, is HIVE.<eos> Those little yellow pills you swallowed, they do a few interesting things-- including making you cooperative.<eos> Now, I understand you all volunteered and that's just swell.<eos> But I think we can all agree that in any chain of command, there can never be too much compliance.<eos> Perhaps a demonstration.<eos> Kneel.<eos> The people of this city-- what's left of them, at any rate-- they call you Ghosts.
Suit up.<eos> You brought them.<eos> And dressed for the occasion, I see.<eos> We're only doing this because two lives aren't worth two cities.<eos> Well, in that case, you are wiser than I gave you credit for.<eos> It's been a lifetime.<eos> Still wearing those ridiculous outfits, I see.<eos> You don't need to be here for this.<eos> The culling has a tendency to be... Unsightly.<eos> Your new friends betrayed you.
Let yourself remember.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, wait.<eos> Stay a little longer.<eos> I can't.<eos> Hath-set and I need to make another offering to Horus.<eos> The augers have said more sky rocks will be falling soon.<eos> Well, I hear he covets you.<eos> How fortunate I know the man who can handle him.<eos> Prince Khufu.<eos> What a surprise to find you here.
Where?<eos> Your go-to place.<eos> Where you sit there and you say that it's all your fault.<eos> Well, it is my fault.<eos> I'm the one who outed Darhk.<eos> I know.<eos> I seem to remember us all being there when you did.<eos> I ran for mayor because I can protect myself and I thought that all of you could, too.<eos> And you were right, we can.<eos> I know, but you didn't sign up for this.
You know, Joe and Barry and Iris are having people over for Christmas Eve, and they said we could invite whoever we want.<eos> - Who... who do you want?<eos> - You.<eos> I want to invite you, I mean.<eos> This is so painful.<eos> Have you guys seen Harry?<eos> No, I have not.<eos> I told him to rest.<eos> He's just as stubborn as all the rest of my male patients in this place.<eos> I'm gonna leave you two alone, okay?
Going after criminals is in my job description.<eos> It's not reckless.<eos> And powers or not, Mardon's gonna answer for what he's done.<eos> Patty... ♪ Deck the halls ♪<eos> ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ I don't remember those being the lyrics.<eos> I am tremendously creative.<eos> That I can tell you.<eos> You'd better be.<eos> I didn't break you out...<eos> I didn't break either of you out, because I was looking to make some new friends.
Yes.<eos> Thanks. Now let me make it harder for you.<eos> Get away from her!<eos> Grab my arm and siphon or keep burning.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Well, that was a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be.<eos> Any questions before we head to the final stop on our tour?<eos> Yeah. So when does this get scary?<eos> Hey! This isn't some haunted hayride, ok?<eos> If you want teenagers dressed up in silly costumes giving you jump scares, go to Grove Hill.
When will I see you again?<eos> I will find my way back to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> So it's kind of like "The Notebook" except you two never reconnect and he totally forgets about you.<eos> Julian was in a hurry to get to Europe.<eos> He convinced me to lie to Lily, tell her that Stefan was happy.<eos> Believe me, Julian had a way of convincing anyone to do anything.<eos> So why did Lily send you here?<eos> She didn't send me here exactly.<eos> She had a job, and I volunteered, and she has the family on a short leash back home with this whole "I took you in as orphans, so I know what's best for you" vibe.
She never goes anywhere without it.<eos> What is Valerie doing with Stefan's journal?<eos> It's the first thing she looked for when we realized we were trapped in 1903.<eos> The entry for July 15, 1863, should tell you why.<eos> Stefan, voice-over: I just had the strangest encounter outside the county fair.<eos> I met someone, a girl.<eos> We only spoke for a moment, but her name is Valerie, and she may be the most wonderful girl I have ever met.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Great show, everyone.<eos> I will catch you at the grapevine in a bit.
That's interesting.<eos> I'm gonna need a little help with the dirty work, so rise and shine, brother.<eos> We are going to interrogate a tall, beautiful heretic with a terrible attitude.<eos> Valerie?<eos> Rings a bell.<eos> I am missing something here.<eos> Oh, Stefan and Valerie are old flames from way back, and they haven't had a face-to-face since she came tumbling out of that prison world.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Valerie as in v-card Valerie, "wham, bam, thank you, ma'am," broke your heart and, uh...<eos> You know what? I think this would be the perfect opportunity for you two to catch up, unless there's a reason it would be uncomfortable for you.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, what's the occasion?<eos> My mother always used to keep fresh flowers when expecting guests.<eos> I suppose I picked it up from her.<eos> Ah, Julian, I presume. Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> He'll arrive home today if all goes as planned.<eos> This is a good thing, Lorenzo.<eos> I hope you can be happy for me.<eos> There's no reason the two of you shouldn't get along.
Did you ever hear of the black sea massacre of 1897?<eos> Julian annihilated an entire coastline on Christmas day, and yet Lily is still hopelessly in love with him.<eos> So?<eos> Stefan took out an entire village in Monterrey, and Caroline still wants him.<eos> To each, his own.<eos> Speaking of which, how did you two, um, meet?<eos> At the town fair.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> That's right, mm-hmm.<eos> And then you were supposed to meet after that, right, like, under a bridge or a tree or romantic park bench.
Incendia. Shouldn't we, uh, get a match?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> Guess it ain't a party until the mean girls show up.<eos> Look who's in a heap of trouble.<eos> What's Lily going to say?<eos> Let's ask her.<eos> Lily, we found Valerie.<eos> She's over here trying to kill to love of your life.<eos> Girls, I'll meet you in the car.
Should you ever attempt that again, I will take the boys far away from here.<eos> You will be alone, and you will never see them again.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Lily, voice-over:<eos> Giuseppe was a monster.<eos> He wasn't manipulating me, I wasn't blind to it.<eos> I knew it in my bones.<eos> The only thing I cared about more than leaving him was protecting your brother and you.<eos> Everything... That I did back then...<eos> I was doing for you.
Neighboring towns.<eos> We promised them a night of drink and conversation.<eos> Ah, so you compelled them.<eos> I wanted to show you what peace looks like.<eos> My family is civilized.<eos> None of these people are in danger.<eos> What? No tie?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I missed my stash.<eos> Boys, why don't you go mingle? I'll put this away.
What are you doing?<eos> What did I do to make you hate me so much?<eos> It's not about you.<eos> Not about me?<eos> Ever since I've been back, all you have done is try to strip me of my happiness.<eos> Answer me.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> Well, I see Stefan's plan went swimmingly.<eos> Probably explains why your fake guests are leaving.<eos> Sit down, both of you.

Ha ha!<eos> Brother, let's hit the road.<eos> Sit down, son, or I'll seat you myself.
You would have been an amazing husband.<eos> It's been so nice...<eos> It's been so nice to hear her voice again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to say good-bye.<eos> Good-bye, Ric.<eos> Hey, hey, what are you doing here?<eos> He did actually see us, didn't he?<eos> All right, everybody. Please stand up.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here, ok?
Why am I so nervous?<eos> Probably because the love of your life is far too vain to be wearing whatever that tiny little rock is, reflecting light in that box.<eos> Lily doesn't allow us to leave Mystic Falls, so my options were limited to coal-miner chic.<eos> A relationship as beautiful as yours deserves something a little better.<eos> This belonged to French royalty.<eos> A, uh, Princess, I think.<eos> She was telling me as she lost her head.<eos> - It's perfect.<eos> Oh, the perfect ring for the perfect couple.<eos> I'm so happy for you both.
A gift for us.<eos> "But could youth last and love still breed, have joys no date, nor age no need"...<eos> Marry me.<eos> 133 years is not enough, Nora.<eos> I want eternity.<eos> Yes.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course, yes.<eos> I'm happy for you two.
When she turned her back on me, I thought I'd never find that kind of love again.<eos> You proved me wrong.<eos> Next.<eos> You knew me at my brightest and my darkest.<eos> No matter what my mood, you always saw the light in me.<eos> I'll miss you, Lily.<eos> Cream violets.<eos> You remembered. Of course I did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll leave you two.
I have to do this right.<eos> ♪ But I'll find a way ♪ And I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> And all I want to do is just sit on our kitchen counter while you burn our dinner and ask you a million questions.<eos> God, I miss you.<eos> Thought you ran away.<eos> In my own house?<eos> I'm twice your age.<eos> I could take both of you.<eos> Well, you could certainly try.<eos> I would have killed you on sight if it weren't for your mother.
Let me guess... Lord Tristan de Martel.<eos> You know, I've always despised churches, but cemeteries I love.<eos> Churches celebrate fairy tales, guardian angels, patron saints, but cemeteries hold concrete proof that not one of those things can save you from the inevitable.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So your Strix vampires, they've been watching me, tailing me, listening to me, so they know I'm not an easy target, and I'm sick and tired of good people falling victim to the trash<eos> that The Originals bring to town.<eos> Now normal people can't enforce justice on vampires, but I will.<eos> I can, and I will, so...<eos> You guys keep watching me, but know for sure<eos> I'm watching you, too.
Now, if you're gonna help me, then help me.<eos> Otherwise, bugger off.<eos> All right. Ha ha ha!<eos> You really said that to him?<eos> "People are not awful. They want to be good."<eos> Wow, a bit saccharine, no?<eos> Why don't you ask your boyfriend?<eos> You feeling jealous?<eos> It seems as though you are, and yet you and Nik are not lovers.<eos> You admitted so yourself. You've never even kissed.
This stake was imbued with dark magic.<eos> It's strong enough to take down even you.<eos> So apparently, The Strix have no shortage of weapons.<eos> Well, at least they don't have Marcel.<eos> I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Look.<eos> I know he attacked you, but he could've used that thing on you, and he didn't, and, for what it's worth, he did save me.<eos> And healed me.<eos> A few minutes more, and I would have been dead.<eos> Do I need to remind you that because of your beloved hero, Tristan is free, Rebekah is lost.
- Who pays you?<eos> Our clients aren't the people we...<eos> We report back.<eos> So and so... .. likes it like this.<eos> So and so... likes a little of this.<eos> Blackmail?<eos> But that's not my business.<eos> You just do the fucking.<eos> I just do the fucking.<eos> 'They told me to meet him... 'in the way you met him.'
Oh, God. You fuck Mr. Irons in your fantasy?<eos> No, no. He's just there.<eos> He's watching me, telling me what to do.<eos> I'm really sorry about that.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Wait. Your family is driving all the way here just to sign the high school papers?<eos> Uh, they don't really trust the U.S. Postal Service.<eos> What about FedEx?<eos> Okay, Colton, what... what... what's going on?<eos> Okay, so they were cool with me coming out here for a couple of weeks, right, to meet Rita and to meet you, but, you know, they, like we talked about, you know, I, you know,
Do you... Do you want to go with them?<eos> Do you want me to go?<eos> I just want to do what's right. I want to do what's best for you.<eos> What... You're a grown man.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I... I think you guys got a really good thing going on with the baby, and, Raquel, I'm...<eos> I'm really sorry. Raquel, uh...<eos> I don't know, man. I don't... I don't know.<eos> I... I... I'm just...<eos> I'm going to give you some space, man.
You leave to fight?<eos> To make my wealth.<eos> If you want land or silver, you have to take it.<eos> You made me proud today,<eos> Uhtred.<eos> You made me proud.<eos> I don't know you, you don't have the appearance of a messenger. And Ubba's payment's not yet due.<eos> No, Lord, I was a ship's master.<eos> Ah, well I have no ships, I need no ship's master.<eos> I have news that you will want to hear.
(ALFRED) Do not look at me, Father.<eos> - I am a sinner. I'm a grievous sinner.<eos> - We are all sinners, my lord.<eos> And I am married.<eos> I should never have married.<eos> He sends temptation to test us.<eos> When we fail, he sends the Danes to punish us.<eos> I should never have married, I should've joined the church. I should've gone to a monastery.<eos> God would've found a great servant in you, but I feel he has other plans.<eos> If your brother were to die, it'd be to you people would turn.
(UHTRED) Not that it's your concern, but she's for Storri. A Saxon whore, from Ubba.<eos> I've seen you before.<eos> I served Earl Ragnar and now I serve Ubba.<eos> - (WOMAN SCREAMS) - (DANE 2) Quiet, woman. You'll see me again, I'm sure, boy.<eos> - I'm told Storri is at the church?<eos> - Monastery, looking after King Edmund and killing his priests.<eos> - (UHTRED) Hello?<eos> - Leave or it will be the death of you.<eos> - This church is mine by order of Ubba.<eos> - Master Storri, I have a gift for you.
Can we have some ale?<eos> Miserable King Edmund of East Anglia.<eos> You have had the night to consider my offer.<eos> How do you answer?<eos> - Are you dead or breathing still? - (GUTHRUM) With luck he's dead.<eos> We allow far too many of them to live as it is.<eos> - You allow nothing.<eos> - He lives.<eos> It's God who decides who lives.<eos> I would say your God has left you hanging, sir.
I will suffer your presence.<eos> I will provide you with horses, food, coin, and hostages. I will do all that you demand.<eos> But only if you, Lord Ubba, and all of your men submit to God.<eos> That is my demand.<eos> You must be baptised.<eos> You must stand in a barrel of water and they pour more water over you.<eos> - They want to wash me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Your scent upsets them, Ubba.<eos> - No, to cleanse you of your sins.
Because God is great, all-powerful, magnificent.<eos> Have him stop his yapping and prove it!<eos> Ah. Agreed.<eos> Prove to me your God is great.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Prove, prove, prove- - Look, here!<eos> God spared Saint Sebastian.<eos> - But the man died.<eos> - It was God's will.<eos> Would God protect you from my arrows?
Prove it.<eos> Prove, prove, prove- - Look, here!<eos> God spared Saint Sebastian.<eos> - But the man died.<eos> - It was God's will.<eos> Would God protect you from my arrows?<eos> - If he was all-powerful, he would?<eos> - Yes, if it was God's will, he would.<eos> (UBBA) So let us try.<eos> We shall shoot arrows at you, and if you survive, (CHUCKLES) we will all be washed.
- (BRIDA) Us both.<eos> Of course.<eos> I expected as much.<eos> - Father Beocca.<eos> - (BEOCCA) Lord?<eos> - Take your guests for refreshments.<eos> - I will, my lord.<eos> They may remain in Winchester, but I hold you responsible.<eos> Yes, lord.<eos> You should've gone along and prayed, it would've bonded you.
Agreed, my lord, he imagines we are jackdaws.<eos> (AETHELRED) Where on the road to Abbendum?<eos> - Where would you choose to meet--?<eos> - The place called Asec's Hill, lord.<eos> - You or Guthrum would choose?<eos> - I've seen it, the pass narrows. You cannot be out-flanked.<eos> For Danes to fight uphill, it'll be difficult, they'll be confident, they don't fear Saxons.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do they not fear us?<eos> They believe you to be farmers, nothing more.
We will give thanks to Odin for our deliverance.<eos> Do that!<eos> We are Danes!<eos> Show respect!<eos> Do it again and I will cut you prick to throat.<eos> You are a hero of Wessex.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We're alive.<eos> What is it?<eos> I couldn't wait to see you.
What is it?<eos> I couldn't wait to see you.<eos> I was told you are safe, but I needed proof.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Leave us...<eos> My wife will help me.<eos> My Lord.<eos> My privilege.<eos> Ensure it is repaired, and well.<eos> I'd be a lost fool without you.
My Lord.<eos> My Lady.<eos> Forgive me... I was, hoping for a moment to discuss the Ealdorman Uhtred.<eos> Father, forgive me but my Lord is in need of rest.<eos> He is.<eos> You are...<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Aethelwold.<eos> Were you on the hill?<eos> I didn't see you?
I fear no number of kneeling clergy men will change what a heathen's axe has already decreed.<eos> Our prayers should be with the King's successor, whoever that may be.<eos> The crown is mine, my birthright.<eos> You disagree?<eos> The argument against will be that you are young, Lord.<eos> I am my father's heir!<eos> Yes, you are your father's heir, but your father is also bonded to Alfred.<eos> A son comes before a brother.<eos> Then perhaps you should speak to the King directly.<eos> 'Tis my thinking, Lord, that if on his death bed your father were to name you as his successor, the Witan would find it difficult to go against him.
You are without lands, completely.<eos> Then that's what I want, that's what I deserve, land.<eos> I brought you here solely to convey my thanks, but we shall talk further at some point, now,<eos> I have other, more important matters to attend.<eos> I gave you victory, Lord, what's more important than that?<eos> The King is dead.<eos> Since when?<eos> I have not long left him.<eos> My first act as King will be to offer the Danes a peace.<eos> They will think you spineless... Lord.
Get down from the horse, boy.<eos> Get down from the horse and look at me.<eos> You are a beauty.<eos> Tell this King...<eos> What was his name?<eos> Alfred.<eos> Tell King Alfred that Guthrum accepts his invitation, and I will watch for him, and I shall ride out and meet him.<eos> I will pass on your message, Lord.<eos> This horse belongs to me now.<eos> Uhtred, Alfred is keen to find a use for you, but Brida is...
If you wish to occupy the fortresses, then do it, take them.<eos> How many have you taken to date?<eos> Father, how many have they taken to date?<eos> None, Lord.<eos> We can take all the fortresses at any time!<eos> We have taken the whole of England!<eos> And we can do the same with Wessex!<eos> Let me be clear, I am prepared to return to the sword, we outnumber you.<eos> We are many and we are dangerous, but I would prefer to establish a peace.<eos> And Uhtred, here, shall keep his head, but I will pay you well to leave Wessex.
And we can do the same with Wessex!<eos> Let me be clear, I am prepared to return to the sword, we outnumber you.<eos> We are many and we are dangerous, but I would prefer to establish a peace.<eos> And Uhtred, here, shall keep his head, but I will pay you well to leave Wessex.<eos> That is what people will read, that Alfred sought peace.<eos> Alfred paid Lords Ubba and Guthrum in silver in exchange for peace.<eos> It is I who is seeking an end to the fighting.<eos> That is what will be written.<eos> Uhtred.<eos> I would never have given you up to Ubba.
Uhtred, this is Aethelwold, another arseling.<eos> Nephew of the King.<eos> No, I am not the nephew of the King, I am the King, but Alfred likes to pretend, and every bastard appears to be happy with the lie.<eos> What are we talking about? Alfred.<eos> He will not allow me to fight!<eos> Have I told you that?<eos> Many times.<eos> Well, it's true.<eos> He will not allow me to fight.<eos> I would like you, warrior Leofric, to teach me how to fight, and I shall teach you how to...
He will not allow me to fight.<eos> I would like you, warrior Leofric, to teach me how to fight, and I shall teach you how to...<eos> You will not forget to pay for this.<eos> Have I ever?<eos> Once or twice.<eos> Alfred was caught humping a nun once.<eos> What I ought to do is slit his gizzard.<eos> Say that to anyone but me, boy, and you'll be hanged.<eos> You are hurting royalty.<eos> You are lucky Alfred hasn't had you killed.
I'll take it she has gone, then?<eos> I'm guessing that it's Alfred that kept you here?<eos> I sold myself for a mail coat and helmet.<eos> That's what we do, we sell ourselves.<eos> This year, what you're giving to Alfred, it's not about a mail coat, it's about you.<eos> The bastard thinks, didn't I say?<eos> He wants more than a year's service, he wants you to help take back England.<eos> All of England.<eos> Of course, when the year's up, you could go back to the Danes.<eos> That would at least give me the chance to kill you.
Or listen to what he has to say, Lord, is what I meant.<eos> Lord Ubba, may I present the Lord Odda of Wessex.<eos> There never seems to be a meeting that you do not attend.<eos> Is there more than one of you?<eos> Lord Ubba, Odda's Alfred's most trusted general.<eos> I don't give a shit who he is. All he needs to do is to surrender.<eos> There will be no surrender.<eos> What will there be?<eos> There will be no surrender.<eos> Though I do invite you to return to your ships.
We will not be returning to our ships.<eos> - And I shall not be moving from this hill.<eos> You have no business in Wessex.<eos> My business is to kill you.<eos> You may try.<eos> Guthrum's fleet's gone.<eos> Njord reached out from the deep and dragged Guthrum's fleet down to the sea-bed. -You are lying.<eos> -I watched the fleet die and its men go under.<eos> Storri, what do you say?<eos> Lord, I do not see for Guthrum, I... I see for you.
Excepting Uhtred.<eos> Father, if what Uhtred says about the storm is true, and Guthrum's fleet is all but destroyed, we would join forces with Alfred.<eos> We may well meet him on the road.<eos> Then we are all against Ubba.<eos> As a strategy it makes sense.<eos> I gave him my word.<eos> He will die and you can call him a hero.<eos> The others are here.<eos> You must decide what you will tell them.<eos> I have called for you, to tell you to ready your men, all men.
No, no more than is usual.<eos> I, erm...<eos> I worry that I do not inspire them. That they do not see me as a warrior.<eos> Lord...<eos> Lord, it is Odda.<eos> What is this?<eos> Young Odda? You have news?<eos> Where is your father?<eos> He was wounded in battle, a great battle at Cynuit, Lord.<eos> Lord, I have a gift for you.
It is, yeah, for a time.<eos> Guthrum will have no choice now, but to make peace.<eos> While your father recovers, you will stand in his place. His lands will be your lands and more.<eos> Wessex is saved.<eos> Everybody is walking to the palace.<eos> A celebration, it must be.<eos> A celebration of Prayers.<eos> I believe you did this.<eos> The great hall is now full, there is no more room.<eos> The King thanks you all for coming, but you need to pray here, outside.
We'd be lucky to see the inside, Lord.<eos> Good morning, King Alfred.<eos> Guthrum of the Danes.<eos> I, too, am a king now, of East Anglia.<eos> You don't need to bow.<eos> I will begin.<eos> I propose a truce.<eos> For any truce to occur, Earl Guthrum, you must leave Wessex -once again.<eos> -And if I refuse?<eos> We surround you.
Of course. And should you die as a captive, rest assured your debt shall die with you.<eos> Will they treat us well?<eos> You are one of them.<eos> If I am one of them, then why am I a hostage?<eos> They will treat us well for as long as the truce holds.<eos> -If it fails?<eos> -They will kill us all. Starting with the priest.<eos> I have made my peace.<eos> I am ready.<eos> Good evening and God Bless you all.
Amen.<eos> Is this rabble what so many are afraid of?<eos> They're like children!<eos> Enough.<eos> Enough!<eos> They're our guests for a while.<eos> There's one rule only.<eos> At nightfall, you will gather and sleep at the church. The doors will be barred.<eos> At daybreak, you will then be free to walk, talk, jump, hump, carry weapons.<eos> My men have orders not to kill you unless you deserve to be killed.

-May you enjoy a good day.<eos> -Thank you, Father.<eos> He is the King of Kings. -Capable of great, great things.<eos> -Such as what?<eos> Such as miracles.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Miracles?<eos> Such as what?<eos> (HESITATING) Such as you, Lord.<eos> You are a miracle.<eos> He has made you strong, yet merciful.

You are God-fearing Christians no more.<eos> You are Danes now. Pagans.<eos> You don't cross yourself nor look to the heavens.<eos> Let's make ourselves rich!<eos> (MILDRITH) My husband is protecting our kingdom.<eos> From whom? We're at peace.<eos> He only said he was doing Alfred's work.<eos> He doesn't trust the Danes.<eos> He thinks he knows better than the king.<eos> Your man, Leofric, will give you detail.
Our king has been attacked by a fellow Briton and neighbour, Cailyn, whose forces have seized the fort guarding our land.<eos> I am sent to tell you Peredur will pay you well to help him recapture this fort.<eos> Pay us well?<eos> How much?<eos> I do not know the sum, but I am sure he will be generous.<eos> He has silver?<eos> He is a king.<eos> Winchester it is not.<eos> Alfred he is not.<eos> The king greets you.
Call the men up. We stay here.<eos> I'll dream about that shadow queen.<eos> (LEOFRIC) You told her your name, and word travels.<eos> (ASSER) Uhtred Ragnarson.<eos> I notice that you have some Saxons amongst your ranks. Some.<eos> From Mercia.<eos> Rather fight than work in the fields.<eos> Pay is better.<eos> He'd like to attack at the earliest opportunity.<eos> He won't feed you more than a night.
On my own?<eos> You wanted to be first in line.<eos> What do you see?<eos> They are Danes!<eos> Real Danes!<eos> Stand still!<eos> Hold!<eos> (PEREDUR) What are you waiting for?<eos> - (UHTRED) They're Danes!<eos> - What do you care?
If not, I'll put it in the smith's fire.<eos> I accept.<eos> On behalf of the church, I accept.<eos> I trust I can rely upon your good judgment in dismissing the matter of my servant Oswald's wergild.<eos> He was a thief.<eos> - His family will swear otherwise.<eos> - My people will swear he was.<eos> And time will be wasted with no end.<eos> In that case, consider all matters resolved.<eos> Bless you.
Will you sleep alongside me tonight, under the furs?<eos> - Sleep?<eos> - Nothing more.<eos> I would like that. As the only other source of warmth would be a goat.<eos> Edwina.<eos> Lady?<eos> Please inform your family that I'll be travelling.<eos> With the child.<eos> We will leave for Lord Odda's estate.<eos> I would like you with me, but it is your decision.

Perhaps, but no more.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> You will provide the records as requested, please.<eos> Jules.<eos> You have to come with me right now.<eos> Good morning, Frank.<eos> Good morning, Mr McCarthy.<eos> You care for some coffee?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I heard you come in last night.
And we did some investigating of our own, like swapping out M's pen for a video monitoring device.<eos> I never had any reason to suspect it was a camera pen.<eos> And I used an old family recipe to get her fingerprints off her pen.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Since you already know more than you should,<eos> I will tell you that once NOV-Eight received inside intel that the prince's mission may be in danger, we sent Agent McAlister to find out whatever she could first, then protect the prince once he arrives and ensure he safely gets on that spacecraft.<eos> Count on it, ma'am.<eos> Girls, I'm rather impressed with your keen instincts and experimental methods.<eos> NOV-Eight needs new recruits.<eos> If you're interested, I'd like to test you out in the field under the leadership of Agent McAlister.
You decided that you would figure it out on your own.<eos> We were a team.<eos> Operation Cobra.<eos> I remember. But now you just want your dark magic back so you can do it alone.<eos> And I've seen what you do with dark magic.<eos> He needs time, Emma.<eos> We should really get to the library.<eos> We've got a lot to do.<eos> I have a stop to make first.<eos> I'll meet you there.
We put tables over there, and created a legal aid center.<eos> The medical center was near that wall.<eos> An information center was also here.<eos> The government wanted to stop this at the grassroots level, but the reaction was opposite.<eos> For Ukrainians and the country, it was the first time when the government so openly and brutally demonstrated they're against peaceful protests.<eos> Ukraine, wake up!<eos> People started protesting because they're sick and tired.<eos> At this point, it's not even about European integration anymore.<eos> People just want to live in freedom.<eos> Please don't let them provoke you!
I found out what they needed, warm clothes, hats, blankets...<eos> I was shocked how people stood in the street despite such cold weather all this time.<eos> I admire the courage of these people.<eos> I was on Maidan from the beginning.<eos> I saw how the students were staying here in Maidan,<eos> I was worried about them, and live not too far from here.<eos> It was a spontaneous idea, to stay in Maidan until everybody hears you.<eos> Until the world hears you.<eos> We are a European nation and we will fight for our future!<eos> I'm asking you one more time, I'm begging you, don't carry out the orders of Convict Yanukovych.
Those for this, raise your hand!<eos> Only under these three conditions could Maidan end in a peaceful way.<eos> These were our demands in February and they were supposed to be discussed and approved by the parliament.<eos> On February 18th, a crowd of unarmed people gathered to go to the Parliament.<eos> People without weapons or anything.<eos> A lot of patriots responded to the call for a peaceful rally to the parliament.<eos> We hope that our representatives will hear us!<eos> We supposed that a peaceful protest and rally to the parliament, supported by a great number of people, would become a turning point, and we would finally be heard.<eos> Waiting for us there were the police, Berkut, and Titushky.<eos> Remember when you were children, you were taught to love Ukraine.
No, it is. It's just we can do this.<eos> It's just we can't do this.<eos> We need...<eos> Hi.<eos> - So...<eos> - You got to be kidding me.<eos> We were sent here to help these losers?<eos> - Sent?<eos> - Wait.<eos> Who sent you? - No one!
Where's the HAZMAT team?<eos> They should be here by now.<eos> The evacuation caused a massive traffic jam.<eos> They're having trouble getting through.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> How are we gonna do this on our own?<eos> Patterson?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> We can do this.<eos> I can walk you through it.
Two of them have started losing their hair.<eos> All of the patients live or work in this 30-block radius.<eos> This has to be where the Dabbur Zann have set up shop.<eos> 30 blocks, that's a lot of doors to knock on.<eos> Which is why I've got every vehicle I can spare tasked with combing the area.<eos> Weller, you quarterback from here.<eos> Patterson's outfitted each team with one of these.<eos> Portable Geiger counters.<eos> This should lead us right to them.<eos> These potassium iodide pills should prevent you from getting radiation poisoning until we can recover and contain the cesium.

I was... I was all alone.<eos> I can't get those years back. You don't seem to understand that.<eos> I put Colton out of my mind.<eos> I put him out of our world to protect you, Josh.<eos> You have no idea how difficult it is to be a parent, right, Sarie?<eos> Wow. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You think I was so terrible?<eos> I didn't beat you.

Orientation?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For the exodus.<eos> What exodus?<eos> It's okay to be confused.<eos> Many new arrivals are.<eos> We had a guy from Riverside, Iowa show up, thought he was a starship captain.<eos> Are we supposed to understand what the hell you're talking about?<eos> You've been drawn here by inexplicable visions of leaving the planet on a chariot of fire, right? We were drawn here by inexplicable visions of finding food and gas.<eos> You didn't have a dream of a large elongated human form with almond eyes telepathically urging you to come to Roswell at this appointed time?

They live inside Pluto, which isn't really a planet. It's really a hollowed out spaceship. Okay.<eos> You know this is all very informative, but I'm due back on planet earth, so<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> You think I'm crazy. Yeah, I do.<eos> Well these days crazy stays alive.<eos> If I was you people, I'd get out of here before the zombie aliens come back and infect us all.<eos> Do it now before it's too late.<eos> Doc.<eos> And whatever you do, do not listen to that Bernadette chick.<eos> She will get you all killed.
Previously on Z Nation.<eos> Well, people. If we weren't already in an apocalypse, This would be a damn obvious sign.<eos> What do you call something worse than an apocalypse?<eos> Because This is it. Whatever it is.<eos> Swarm. Horde. Zunami.<eos> There's no end in sight.<eos> If you're not already west of this thing, you better get moving.
Danny?<eos> What the hell kind of Indian name is Danny?<eos> It's the name on my birth certificate. What's yours?<eos> Smith.<eos> John Smith. What's wrong with your color?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What's wrong with your color, chief?<eos> Excuse me, chief Fire Cloud?<eos> Thank you for hearing us out.<eos> We actually came here to warn you.
Something in their native tongue.<eos> What does Zendigo mean?<eos> I'll tell you what zendigo means.<eos> It's a plague you both carry.<eos> White man's disease.<eos> I dunno what you're talking about, But I can assure you we both had our shots.<eos> Your people infected us before.<eos> Zendigo nearly destroyed my people.<eos> We vowed never allow that to happen again.<eos> I'm only gonna ask you one more time.
Take yes for an answer, kid.<eos> Come on.<eos> Doc!<eos> Thanks for volunteering to be our early warning alarm.<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Let us go!<eos> You'll never see us again!<eos> You got that right.<eos> Look.<eos> You and I both know what happens if I let you go.
This is citizen Z.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> If you haven't found cover, then do so now.<eos> The first of the fast zombies should be reaching you any minute.<eos> Guys<eos> Guys<eos> Everything we've worked for, it's over.<eos> Everyone, it's time for us to go.<eos> We need to hurry.<eos> They will kill all of you.
Her spirit rests here.<eos> This place is sacred too.<eos> It is stronger than a million zombies!<eos> What if it's not?<eos> Then I go down with the ship.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Everyone. It is time for you to go.<eos> It has been an honor to serve as your tribal chief.<eos> In my absence, listen to my daughter.<eos> She has known you all of her life.
Don't worry. We filter and boil everything.<eos> This is my masterpiece.<eos> Let me show you where we keep the food under lock and key.<eos> We lock up all the food since we discovered some was disappearing<eos> I do all the cooking and cleaning and<eos> A regular cinder fella?<eos> I even clean up after the janitor.<eos> Guess I should be glad I'm alive.<eos> This way.<eos> Why don't you guys relax in the ballroom?
He surprised Murphy, sees the food, fires once.<eos> The bullet hits Murphy in the shoulder, continues on, hits victim number two in the heart.<eos> Now, wait. Hold on. You're telling me that the bullet passed through Murphy and hit this dude in the heart?<eos> Well no wonder he ain't turning.<eos> He's looking just like Cassandra.<eos> You better keep your eye on him.<eos> Damn straight.<eos> Hey guys?<eos> Okay, everybody.<eos> Could I ask you to come in here and join us in the trust circle?
Using the talking stick plus deductive reasoning, we can navigate a journey of discovery that will lead us to the true identity of the killer.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> Or we could just ask Greg who shot him.<eos> Look who just woke up.<eos> Hey, Greg.<eos> Who... shot... you?<eos> Don't even think about it!<eos> Not surprised a zombie figured it out before you corporate morons.<eos> Who you calling corporate? Shut it.<eos> And if anybody moves, I will not hesitate to kill you.
- Stand down, you fool.<eos> He's drunk.<eos> Call the authorities.<eos> Mate, you have to stay here.<eos> I don't have to do shit!<eos> I'm the goddamn King of England.<eos> You don't like me, do you?<eos> So be it. You don't have to.<eos> But guess what?<eos> I don't have to like you either.
Your guests are here!<eos> - Good Yontif!<eos> - Hi, Andy!<eos> Hi!<eos> Look at this! Beat the traffic.<eos> Straight shot down the 101.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Look at you! Our little balabusta.<eos> - Still warm! - It was Ali's idea.<eos> - Nice to see you.
Fuck, that's baller.<eos> Ooh-ooh! It's so good.<eos> Hop in. See if this is the one. Whoo!<eos> This one... This is like we all have our own bed.<eos> Josh can sleep in the back while I drive.<eos> - If you're sober.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're not driving.<eos> This is what we're going to do. I'm going to put little blankies. I'm going to make little nests.<eos> And I'm going to feed you little gummy worms as we go.
I don't even think we should tell her we came here.<eos> Oh, she's fine.<eos> What...<eos> I don't really know what I'm eating.<eos> It's nut loaf.<eos> Well, that doesn't really help me.<eos> Is it meat? Is it nuts?<eos> It's cardboard covered with gravy.<eos> I think it's good.<eos> All right, I'm gonna go see the, um... Crying Ass Shaman Bear. If you guys are good.
Maybe they'll pleasantly surprise us.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Want a smart cookie before we go protect the Prince and save the world from evildoers?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm glad to see you're all so... enthusiastic.<eos> But before we go anywhere, I'd like to get a sense of your skills.<eos> No worries.<eos> We got mad skills.<eos> No doubt.<eos> But I'm gonna need something that shows me how I can best utilize you out in the field.
I got this covered.<eos> [phone keypad clicking]<eos> [McKeyla] Amazing.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I just rerouted his computer to stream an endless loop of funny cat videos.<eos> He should be distracted for at least an hour.<eos> -Very impressive.<eos> -Thanks!<eos> Let's bolt before he catches on.<eos> Uh, since NOV-Eight asked me to guide you through this, here's lesson number one, secret agents don't bounce.
Uh, since NOV-Eight asked me to guide you through this, here's lesson number one, secret agents don't bounce.<eos> -Oopsies.<eos> -And they don't say "oopsies."<eos> Where do you girls think you're going?<eos> And how did you get in here?<eos> Sir, I'm Agent McAlister, and I've been assigned to watch over the Prince and ensure that he safely boards his spaceflight.<eos> Whoa, there, Harriet the Spy.<eos> I look after the Prince, okay?<eos> And there are no visitors allowed inside.<eos> So, you lot are gonna have to go home and swoon over his SnapBook, like all the other fan girls, okay?
All good. It's the last one and I wanted it anyway. [laughs]<eos> -Now tell us what you did with the Prince!<eos> -And about Black Star's secret plan.<eos> Don't worry, girls.<eos> I'm gonna get some answers from our new friend here.<eos> I just hope I don't have to use any unsavory methods.<eos> But that's entirely up to you, chico.<eos> Yes, yes, it's true, I work for Black Star, -but it's not what you think!<eos> -[chimes] He's telling the truth.<eos> -I've been trying to warn you.
No, no!<eos> Don't! Get off me!<eos> Call the lawyers.<eos> Call the-<eos> - Not so tight! Call the lawyers!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> And you, Jillian.<eos> All the secret phone calls and staying back to get the luggage.<eos> I knew there was something off about you, but I never imagined you could be involved in such an evil plan.<eos> You nosey, little spy girls think you're so smart, don't you?
In the meantime, we left hundreds of Danes stranded in Wessex.<eos> Wulfhere, I do not believe their intention was to ever leave.<eos> And in a few months there'll be more ships, more men.<eos> - Now is the time to fight.<eos> - (VVULFH ERE) To fight with what?<eos> We're without an army, the Danes will number thousands.<eos> The men are out there and they're waiting.<eos> What they need is the call.<eos> (vvul_I=l-lERE) mdeed, but...<eos> Lord... ..what if I suggest we escort you to Frankia?
- I am Halig.<eos> I take care of the horses.<eos> - Gone where?<eos> Now I'm thinking on it, he did not say.<eos> I thought you would know. - Wulfhere, where is he?<eos> - (UHTRED) He's gone, lord.<eos> My lord, it's you.<eos> - (ALFRED) where?<eos> - (UHTRED) He didn't say.<eos> - He has left you horses, lord.
You deserve so much more than the clothes of a nun.<eos> I have purpose, lord.<eos> My child is with God and I am close to God.<eos> There is joy in my days, at times.<eos> Do not fear the Danes. You will be protected.<eos> My son will ensure that.<eos> You are Earl Skorpa?<eos> (SKORPA) You are here to surrender and not waste my time.<eos> - I am here to negotiate.<eos> - Surrender and you will live. - Talk too much and I will kill you.

Why should I not simply crush you?
I now have to make a choice, whether to side with Guthrum or with Skorpa.<eos> One Dane looks like the other to me.<eos> I am occupying your land. Why should I not simply crush you?<eos> Accept my invitation.<eos> Eat with myself and with my father, and I will tell you all about my land, the range of my influence.<eos> I am sure an agreement can be reached. Neither of us need lose any men. Neither of us need be weakened.<eos> - Eat? - And drink. At my hall.<eos> I assure you this is no trap.<eos> I will arrive at your hall after the new moon.<eos> I shall expect you.
Was there sickness?<eos> - I would like to understand.<eos> - Children are frail.<eos> You will have other sons, I'm sure. With your queen.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I would like you to leave me alone. Never speak to me again.<eos> We have nothing that binds us, nothing.<eos> Avoid me. Please.<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson. Should I be pleased to see you?
- Yes.<eos> I would like you to leave me alone. Never speak to me again.<eos> We have nothing that binds us, nothing.<eos> Avoid me. Please.<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson. Should I be pleased to see you?<eos> - Skorpa of the White Horse.<eos> - I am expected by the Lord Odda.<eos> The Lord Odda's in the ground, buried as a traitor.<eos> So, what now? Do I speak with you? Does the truce stand?<eos> For today it stands. Tomorrow we'll kill you.
- A Dane's knife.<eos> - This thing?<eos> Yes, I took it from a Dane. A Dane I killed.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Winchester.<eos> This is before you grovelled to Guthrum?<eos> Before I presented myself to him, yes.<eos> I was not, however, treated in a kingly manner, and decided to escape.<eos> A king under the Danes is no king.<eos> Uhtred, I do like you, but I rather tire of your preaching.
- We ease! We ease!<eos> Hold!<eos> We hold here!<eos> We go no further!<eos> Edge backwards with me at my level!<eos> (SKORPA) Uhtred Ragnarson!<eos> - Can you hear me?<eos> - I hear you, Skorpa.<eos> - Do you wish to surrender?<eos> - I have a gift for you. Your queen!
Fuck this shit.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Regret and remorse.<eos> Amends and atonement.<eos> That's life, right?<eos> Well, this next one is for you, all you lost souls racing down that long road to redemption, and all you sinners running from your past but heading straight into that pit of darkness up ahead.

Where?<eos> Nowhere you can go, big shot.<eos> You'll fucking take me!<eos> Move, motherfucker!<eos> Get in.<eos> Get in. And drive.<eos> Fuckin' go, man!<eos> Where are my road warriors at, my veteran road hogs out there tearing up the pavement where the rubber meets the road?<eos> You may be an old dog, but you can still learn some new tricks.<eos> So what's stopping you?
- Hey. You can leave your stuff everywhere.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> I'm so glad that we got to do this before you start school.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?<eos> We still have this one last weekend to have fun.<eos> Play games and puzzles, make s'mores, with our little girl.<eos> It's just exciting, sweetie.<eos> Well, we all know the past can be a piece of shit sometimes, but when it catches up to you, you'd better be ready.
- Fuck Shane. Shane was an ass...<eos> Fuck!<eos> What the fuck is that thing?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Fuck this shit!<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Regret and remorse.<eos> Amends and atonement.<eos> Well, that's life, right?<eos> This next one is for you, for all you lost souls racing down that long road to redemption, and all you sinners running from your past but heading straight into that pit of darkness up ahead.

Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.<eos> Heather.<eos> Do you still want the ice?<eos> Geez.<eos> Rise and shine, High School.<eos> Your parental units are here.<eos> ♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon ♪<eos> You ate your sandwich.<eos> Kids,<eos> I just want you to know that it's okay that you're not crying.
- No, I'm seeing them for the first time.<eos> - What are these scratches?<eos> It's nothing. Kids must have scribbled some shit.<eos> - Who did this?<eos> - You're asking million-dollar questions.<eos> What the hell?<eos> So? Was it the frogs then? All jump up together and hit the van?<eos> Boss. Let's get the fuck out of here.<eos> Come on, bro.<eos> - I'll catch you!

You should go through the grove.<eos> - We've arrived then.<eos> - You mean the place behind those trees?<eos> Yes, behind that grove.<eos> 200 meters at most.<eos> - Cut the fucking crap.<eos> Come on. - What?<eos> Where, sir?<eos> We'll follow you. You'll lead the way.<eos> You should sit for a while and rest, Sir.
You just know that something's up.<eos> This has been happening to you since you were a child, Arda.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> Who the hell are you, you son of a bitch?<eos> How dare you chain the police?<eos> Bastard!<eos> Who the hell are you, you son of a bitch?<eos> Speak, damn it!<eos> Don't you have a tongue?<eos> I see you're here to join us tonight.

Don't you have a tongue?<eos> I see you're here to join us tonight.<eos> And we're here to welcome you the best way we can.<eos> On a night like this, when doors open and realms unite... we're here in this chamber together.<eos> Hell is not a place you go.<eos> You carry Hell with you at all times.<eos> You carry it inside you.<eos> We are your humble companions on the road that fate chose for you.<eos> While the stones fall into place, we can only be shepherds for you.<eos> And tonight... if fate put you first among the creatures that we are going to herd... there's nothing else we can do but guide you.
You know how I earn a living.<eos> Yeah, you're the tour guide.<eos> Before that I was a hunter.<eos> Best there ever was.<eos> And now there's something in them woods that needs hunting.<eos> Spotted it just outside of Dead Bear Gulch.<eos> It was none other than the Wailing Wampus Werewolf.<eos> There's no such thing as werewolves.<eos> Settle down, everybody.<eos> I'll catch this beast for you, but it ain't gonna be easy.
I'm so weak from the hunger I could eat this rope.<eos> Delicious rope.<eos> I don't see anything conclusive here, Shaw.<eos> Thought you might not, sheriff, which is why I drew a detailed sketch.<eos> I was skeptical of werewolves until I saw the drawing.<eos> Dude can draw!<eos> The end of the rope is the most delicious part!<eos> Mr. Weenie!<eos> Bad dog!<eos> The werewolf wants to destroy you, your family, your way of life.
That's the traditional werewolf interpretive dance... done to summon other werewolves.<eos> So graceful.<eos> It's settled, then.<eos> Mr. Weenie is the werewolf.<eos> So I am the werewolf?<eos> I'm always the last to hear about these things.<eos> So that would mean I ate Bobbie! And Bob.<eos> I must leave this place... before I eat my friends too.<eos> I mean, think of all the calories!<eos> If he is the werewolf, why didn't he attack you guys in your sleep?
75-year-old male.<eos> Started speaking gibberish at dinner. Bay number 4.<eos> He's gonna need t.P.A. Dr. Leighton.<eos> T.P.A. I think he needs t.P.A.<eos> I didn't ask, but I'm sure Dr. Guthrie will be thrilled.<eos> Follow him and try not to kill anyone.<eos> Dr. Rorish, I'd really like to observe that case, too. How nice for you.<eos> Waiting for a formal invitation?<eos> Go... now.<eos> I'm gonna need you at dispatch. I got two coming in, one critical.
Thafs about as normal as Batman smiling.<eos> What are your orders, fearless leader?<eos> Cyborg and I will secure the perimeter.<eos> Flash, you and Wonder Woman get the power plant crew out of that inferno.<eos> Superman and Hal, you're both immune to radiation.<eos> Stop the energy core from melting down or else Metropolis becomes a lifeless radiation hot zone for the next 10,000 years.<eos> That's a pep talk?<eos> Remind me to never attend your motivational seminars.<eos> Let's do this, guys.<eos> Don't worry, fellas, I'll have you out of danger in a flash.
[ALL LAUGHING]<eos> [CHANTING] We lead the world and there's no doubt<eos> When there's no work We play and shout<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Hello, former rulers of the world.<eos> [ALL GASP]<eos> Ifs Lex Luthor.<eos> Is it Luther or Luthor?<eos> I, Lex Luthor, the greatest criminal mind of our time and the leader of the nefarious Legion of Doom declare the immediate surrender of the world's governments.<eos> If you refuse well, let's just say Metropolis is about to be a cautionary tale.
Hal, you, Flash and Wonder Woman take out the Hall of Doom.<eos> Superman and I will stop Grodd and the forces on the ground.<eos> - What about me?<eos> -I need you to stay in the hall, Cyborg.<eos> Hold down the fort. And also keep an eye on this Martian.<eos> I told you, Batman, I am not a threat.<eos> So you say.<eos> But you did impersonate us, frame us, and cause our banishment from Earth.<eos> Yes, but other than that...<eos> Batman, I wanna go with you.
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be held prisoner.<eos> [WHIMPERING]<eos> For that, I am grateful.<eos> So you'll let me go?<eos> Yes, but I'm afraid they may not.<eos> [GROANS]<eos> BOY:<eos> Yay, Justice League!<eos> MAN 1:<eos> Sorry we exiled you guys. Our bad. MAN 2:
Soon, I'm sure.<eos> Oh, he left you something.<eos> "Thanks for letting me see that crazy house today.<eos> Feel like building one ourselves tomorrow?"<eos> What?<eos> He went back for the duck eggs.<eos> We found these eggs out in front of the house.<eos> Yeah, honey. I-I-I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> I know the two of you well enough.
- Oh, it was fine. Um, it was a little bumpy.<eos> I hate when that happens.<eos> I hit some crazy air pockets when I was flying back from the... The... The place I was at.<eos> You're doing great, Kara.<eos> Do you really...<eos> You really think so, Mom?<eos> Of course.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> This is Leslie Willis, coming to you alive and wired from Catco Plaza.
I know.<eos> You were always so much harder on her than me.<eos> Why?<eos> (MESSAGE TONE BEEPS)<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Ms. Grant has an emergency at the office. I'm gonna go handle it.<eos> (DOOR CREAKS)<eos> You both are in so much trouble.<eos> Do you have any idea how lucky you are?<eos> Anyone could have seen you.
Yes, I'm very pleased.<eos> To tell the truth, I feared your reaction.<eos> I wasn't going to act the way Constance's dad does.<eos> How does Constance's dad act?<eos> Let's not talk about it now.<eos> To the baby.<eos> To the baby.<eos> To the baby.<eos> A baby's a wonderful thing.<eos> If you don't mind, I'll go and lie down.
Well, then I guess you're not leaving.<eos> Oh, Federico.<eos> You're not Buffy La Caza Vampiros!<eos> You're the Tlacamelli Teplani. The Peacekeeper.<eos> Yeah, that's what people keep tellin' me.<eos> Gonzalez you are a man of justice.<eos> Yeah, a man like you understands.<eos> Oh, you understand that this santa sangre could keep culebras from preying on innocents.<eos> You understand what that means?<eos> Less exposure for us, and more peace for you.
- Whoa! - Yeah!<eos> Oh, hell yes.<eos> Thought I broke it.<eos> Hey, guys, I have to run home and get Tim a clean pair of pants.<eos> So if you...<eos> And shoes. Um...<eos> Anybody need anything?<eos> Oh, I-I got a chain saw in my shed.<eos> Yeah, chain saw!<eos> And, uh, is it okay with you if Tim uses your shower?
Well, all I need is, uh... a client.<eos> You guys, Lanie called.<eos> No usable prints from the crime scene, and no hits off ballistics.<eos> Yo, "The Butcherbird Song" is still a popular novel, right?<eos> I mean, it's 25 years old, but our victim should still be getting huge royalty checks.<eos> Yeah. It's required reading in most high schools.<eos> Then why was he living in a one-bedroom apartment and working as a janitor for the past five years?<eos> I'll call the publisher, have them confirm who he is.<eos> No need.<eos> We can do that for you.
Gentlemen, very nice.<eos> Grab a drink.<eos> Uh, what is this?<eos> This is just me saying thank you to my family at the 12th precinct. Oh!<eos> You're trying to buy our love.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - So we'll help you win Beckett back.<eos> No!<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> These are for you.
Are you okay?<eos> Are you okay? Were you scared?<eos> - Did you get hurt?<eos> - I met Supergirl!<eos> She was amazing.<eos> And she's so much prettier in person.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well... Did you notice any of her other attributes?<eos> Um, she's super strong...<eos> And smart and brave and kind and she saved you all.
I thought I'd lost you.<eos> Not getting rid of me that easy.<eos> - All right. Rendezvous with me--<eos> - Don%.<eos> Don't. It's not Donovan anymore.<eos> Jemm, I know it's you.<eos> (IN JEMM'S VOICE) You've only delayed the inevitable.<eos> (THUD)<eos> I will free the prisoners and break through to the surface.<eos> There's no escape for you.
I'm cooking.<eos> Who wants Chinese?<eos> Vinyl.<eos> My dad's collection.<eos> Turned me on to the oldies.<eos> I know this one.<eos> "Trouble" by Iggy Azalea.<eos> Produced by Invisible Men and Salt Wives.<eos> We had a lot of downtime on the island.<eos> Is the island where they sent you after Precrime?
Well, it's a pretty good reason to join up, don't you think?<eos> We never really had a choice.<eos> Of course.<eos> At least you still have your mother, your son.<eos> Rico?<eos> No, he's... he's not my son.<eos> He's my little brother.<eos> My mom hit 60 and went off of birth control and thought that she had an empty nest to fill, and then I moved back next door, so here I am.<eos> You want a drink? Okay.<eos> They found you when you were kids, right?
For the cops, you were on a trip, you didn't know anything.<eos> And for you?<eos> You're still asking me this question?<eos> Sorry.<eos> The more you're linked to the murders, the less you're likely to be guilty.<eos> - You must have seen something.<eos> - But what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you followed the killer.<eos> Or he fixed a meeting with you.
El Murfi isn't worth a damn if he's dead.<eos> Now back off!<eos> Just want to make sure he's the real Murphy.<eos> You wanna see the scars?<eos> I do.<eos> Not until you lower your weapons.<eos> Put them down.<eos> It is true then.<eos> If you lower your weapons, you have my word you will be safe.<eos> Look. If I wanted you dead, we would have left you out with the zombies.

Composting creates heat.<eos> Heat creates energy. Zombies for fuel.<eos> Clever.<eos> What's this?<eos> The future.<eos> Welcome to Mexico.<eos> It's a great privilege for you to see this place.<eos> I bet now you're glad we dug tunnels underneath the border,<eos> - aren't you? - Unbelievable.<eos> We've been tracking you for a while.

What's hard is guessing what you're gonna do next.<eos> Lucky for you, one of our drones spotted you shortly before a zombie knocked it out of the air.
Yeah, we'll... we'll take all that.<eos> Take them where, do you think?<eos> Somewhere without zombies.<eos> And where's that?<eos> You have zombies here.<eos> Sure, we do.<eos> But thanks to you, not for long.<eos> You see the potential here, yes?<eos> Well I see potential in you.<eos> So I could send you back into the apocalypse or
Louis, you're not telling me you're still going with that Harvard-only bullshit, are you?<eos> I'm saying, instead of picking fresh fruit off the vine, I'm gonna steal some ripe bananas right out the grocery store.<eos> The question is, whose grocery store are you planning on knocking over?<eos> It's Robert Zane, and before you try to talk me out of it, he just said that I'm not fit to lead right to my face.<eos> Then give me a gun and point me up a hill, because if he's coming after you, he's coming at me.<eos> And I got your back.<eos> You convinced Simms Chemical they had no proprietary right to your client's patent?<eos> Not only that. I got them to pay for half the research.<eos> It's good to see you, Louis.<eos> It's good to see you too, Katrina.
I mean, a legal clinic isn't the only way to give back.<eos> Father, I'm not sure if you heard me.<eos> I'm a convicted felon.<eos> Michael, you... You came from here.<eos> And if we can't offer redemption to one of our own, then... what kind of church are we?<eos> I don't know, Father, I...<eos> Father Conroy's going on vacation for two weeks.<eos> Just take his classes.<eos> See what it's like.<eos> The worst thing is, you'll realize that this isn't right for you.
Louis, that's Zane's biggest client.<eos> I know he goddamn is.<eos> He's about to be my biggest client.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> You're trying to tell the world that you should be managing partner, and the first thing you do is burn every bridge in sight?<eos> I don't care if I burn every bridge ever built.<eos> I am not letting Robert Zane come in here and push me around the day after Jessica leaves.<eos> So get Jeremy Cohen on the goddamn phone, Donna, or I'm not gonna forget you didn't.<eos> Then don't forget it, Louis.<eos> Because when this comes back to bite you in the ass, I want you to remember that I tried to stop you and you didn't listen.
These kids need your help.<eos> I wanted to help people as a lawyer, not as a teacher.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Difference is, clients actually want my help.<eos> Michael, these kids need it.<eos> They just don't know it.<eos> I don't know, Father.<eos> This is...<eos> Michael, if I just needed someone to grade papers and take attendance, I could've got a trained monkey to do that.<eos> I wanted you because I thought you, of all people, could get through to them.
That's the reason that I'm here and he's not.<eos> So we can get to work... or we can spend the morning sharing our memories of a man who spent the last 40 years giving his life to kids like you and me.<eos> Third grade.<eos> Camping trip to Lake Kanawauke.<eos> Fishing with a stick.<eos> He's still fishing with a stick?<eos> Still coming up empty.<eos> He taught me how to swim on that trip.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm pretty sure you didn't mean to leave this in the McKenzie file.

What?<eos> That's Zane's biggest client.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly why we're going after him.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Whatever time you set up that meeting, I guarantee you, Jeremy Cohen called Robert two minutes later, which means we need to figure out a way to make amends.<eos> No, I don't need to make amends.<eos> I need to make a statement, and that statement is,<eos> "Do not mess with the new managing partner of Pearson Specter Litt."<eos> Louis, that is the wrong statement to make.<eos> And if you insist on making it, I won't come work for you.
You have nothing to feel bad about, Father.<eos> You took a chance.<eos> Someone else will too.<eos> See you around, Father.<eos> Take care of yourself, Michael.<eos> I know it's only been a couple of days, but, will you say good-bye to the kids for me?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Robert.<eos> Twice in one week?<eos> What brings you by?
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I said Louis wasn't ready to be managing partner, but maybe you aren't either, because you're not around enough to know what's going on around here.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> You're the one who said, "Do something about Mike."<eos> Yes, I did, but I didn't say that you should spend your entire existence doing it.<eos> Donna...<eos> Harvey, you can't do whatever you want.<eos> Jessica's not here to pick up the slack anymore.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Well, if you do, then it's time you do what she would've done already.
Mike, not now.<eos> I'm not in the mood.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the mood when I got home to find Anita Gibbs waiting for me.<eos> - Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> She came to my house to tell me that if I even so much as try to get a job at a legal clinic, she's gonna make it her life's mission to stop me.<eos> - She can't do that.<eos> I wasn't even on her radar.<eos> I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me just because you can't accept the fact that I don't want to come back here.<eos> I wasn't trying to get you back.
You couldn't even shine Jessica's shoes and now you're trying to tear her legacy down.<eos> I was trying to live up to her legacy.<eos> Yeah, I don't give a shit what you think you've been doing.<eos> - Harvey, please.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Just let me say what I was gonna... I don't care what you were going to say to me,<eos> Louis, because all you care about is proving to me that you should be managing partner when everyone in the world knows that you shouldn't...<eos> Me, Robert Zane, even Donna.<eos> Harvey, please!<eos> Jessica didn't even want your name up on the wall, so if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner while she's still breathing, you're out of your goddamn mind!
- Louis...<eos> - The funny thing is, all I ended up with was the shortest, most humiliating run as managing partner in the history of the world.<eos> If you ask me, you may have had a short run, but you made your mark.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, unless I'm mistaken, we have ten associates starting tomorrow who chose to come here over one of the best law firms in the city.<eos> They did that because of you.<eos> It was because of me, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you did that all on your own.<eos> Nobody asked you to do it.
- You told me that painting was the one happy memory you had of your mother.<eos> Every application I filled out today asked if I was a convicted felon.<eos> None of these places are gonna hire me after I check that box.<eos> A legal clinic isn't the only way to get back.<eos> Are you offering me a teaching job?<eos> - I am.<eos> - You think this is funny?<eos> Cracks me up that our teacher was in prison last week.<eos> All you care about is proving to me that you should be managing partner, when everyone in the world knows that you shouldn't.<eos> So, if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner, you're out of your goddamn mind!
What happened?<eos> One of the students told their parents I was a criminal.<eos> They went to the archdiocese, and... you know, Father Walker had no choice.<eos> Why didn't you tell me this last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to step on your moment.<eos> You were so happy about Louis' offer.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna take the day to enjoy my life as a free man.<eos> And then tomorrow... I'm gonna start all over again.<eos> Ray's downstairs waiting for you.

Listen to me... you just suffered a huge loss, and you're acting like it's business as usual.<eos> I'm acting like I've got a job to do.<eos> Harvey, if you don't grieve him...<eos> I will grieve my father in my own way.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You'll bottle it up, and you'll try to move on, but...<eos> She's gonna be there, Donna.<eos> I know she is.<eos> But this funeral isn't about her.<eos> And it's not about you.
You'll bottle it up, and you'll try to move on, but...<eos> She's gonna be there, Donna.<eos> I know she is.<eos> But this funeral isn't about her.<eos> And it's not about you.<eos> It's about your dad... the man you love more than anyone in the entire world.<eos> And if you don't say good-bye to him, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your life.<eos> Donna, what are you doing here?<eos> The question is, what are you still doing here?<eos> I made you an 8:00 reservation to Boston, which means you should be halfway there by now.
As far as I'm concerned, that means you're worth taking a chance on.<eos> Wow, you really are a do-gooder.<eos> I'm not here to do good for you.<eos> I'm here to do good for my clinic, because I'm hiring a partner-level attorney from one of the top firms in the city for the price of the kid who gets me my coffee.<eos> You have a kid who gets you coffee?<eos> No, we can't afford that.<eos> But if we could, I'd pay him what I'm gonna pay you.<eos> So are you in or not?<eos> When do I start?<eos> I don't think I've ever seen you in a suit before.
You don't have to say it.<eos> I know.<eos> She's here.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> She asked if she could say a few words about Dad.<eos> And what, you're gonna let her? - Harvey...<eos> - She is not saying a single word as long as I'm here.<eos> Yes, she is, and if you make a scene in front of my kids on the day that we put our dad into the ground,<eos> I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you, because she's my mother, and I'm gonna let her say her piece.<eos> Harvey... It's good to see you.

It's good to see you.<eos> Wish I could say the same thing, Lily, but... I'd be lying if I did.<eos> Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> And whether you believe it or not, I loved your father.<eos> And I am sad to see him go.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't believe it, and I didn't come here to see you.
- Teddy Doyle just called.<eos> He has an emergency.<eos> So you mean Harvey needs my help. - Louis...<eos> - Donna, give me one good reason why I should help him.<eos> You're not helping Harvey, Louis.<eos> You're helping the firm.<eos> Teddy is a client of all of us.<eos> No, Harvey made it clear that there is no us.<eos> Louis, Harvey's going through something right now.<eos> His outburst wasn't about you.
Mike?<eos> What's going on? Rachel.<eos> I thought you weren't getting home till 8:00.<eos> - It's 8:30.<eos> - I guess I lost track of time.<eos> I have just been buried in this paperwork.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> Are we being audited?<eos> I got a job.<eos> And I would have called you right away, but I've been swamped from the minute I walked into the clinic.
You got a job at a legal clinic?<eos> Mike, that's amazing. Yeah, it is.<eos> - Um...<eos> - Yes, they know about me.<eos> In fact, it's the reason I got hired.<eos> Let me guess... they were smart enough to appreciate they can get someone with your experience for ten cents on the dollar.<eos> You got it.<eos> $35,000 a year to be exact.<eos> Which means... we should probably start packing up the place now, 'cause we definitely cannot afford to live here anymore.<eos> I would live in a shoebox with you if it meant you were happy.
They were his everything.<eos> No matter where he is... I know he is watching over them right now.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Doing my job.<eos> - This is my case, not yours.<eos> - No, Marissa.<eos> It's our case.<eos> We're on the same side.<eos> And if you'd just listen to me, you might learn something. - Like what?<eos> - Like the ways experienced attorneys can trick you.
You said 3:00, so I called her in at 2:30 because I knew you wouldn't give me the chance to meet her, just like I know the other side is gonna approach her when you're not there.<eos> - They can't do that. - Why? Because it's unfair?<eos> - Because it's illegal.<eos> - Only if she pursues them, which she'll never do because they're gonna find out whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her exactly the amount she needs to get by, and then she's gonna take it.<eos> If she does that, she'll end up homeless.<eos> Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen.<eos> Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you that she was gonna speak before you got here.<eos> I just didn't have it in me to have it out with you. It's okay, Marcus.<eos> She got to you, didn't she?
Maybe you don't care about these people, but I do. God.<eos> And I'm willing to fight to make sure they stay in their home, and I'm not afraid to tell her that.<eos> This is not about caring.<eos> There's a real world out there, and like I told you, there's an experienced lawyer on the other side looking to exploit our mistakes.<eos> If you over-promise and under-deliver, you're just making them that much more vulnerable to a shitty offer.<eos> Is that what they taught you in Corporate Lowballing 101?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You don't give a shit about these people, and Nathan and everyone else here might be buying your bullshit, but I know why you're really here.<eos> I get it.<eos> You checked up on me. I didn't need to check up on you.
And the only reason you'd stay longer is if things were going better than you thought they would.<eos> Thanks, Donna.<eos> I don't need your thanks, Harvey.<eos> I'm just really happy you're there.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> How could she not know?<eos> - I checked the box. - You did.<eos> But I was the one who brought the application to Nathan, and he told me not to tell anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he didn't want them to judge you.
Thank you, Oliver.<eos> You made your strawberry pie.<eos> It was his favorite.<eos> Maybe you forgot it was mine, too.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> It was a nice speech.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> Harvey... when my parents died, I felt like I was completely alone in the world.<eos> I don't want you to feel that way.<eos> I want you to know that whether you want me in your life or not, you still have a mother that loves you and will always be there for you.
Why now?<eos> Someone very special to me convinced me that I needed to.<eos> Whoever it is... I'm glad she did.<eos> That's good.<eos> I want you to know... that I forgive you, too.<eos> For what?<eos> For the last time I saw you and for you being gone all those years.<eos> I had my reasons to be gone.<eos> Yes, you did, when you were younger, but you're not a child anymore, and you haven't been for a long time.<eos> I can't believe you.

I can understand how this was just a mistake, because you are the same selfish, self-centered, disloyal woman you always were.<eos> And you are the same self-absorbed, childish man you always were. Well, whose fault is that?<eos> There you go.<eos> Leave.<eos> That's what you do best.<eos> What'd you just say to me?<eos> I said take a look in the mirror, Harvey, because I may have neglected my family in the past, but you've been doing it for as long as I can remember.<eos> So what am I supposed to tell the kids in the morning?<eos> You tell them I've got business back in New York.<eos> You want me to lie for you?
So, when you leave this time, just stay gone, because the truth is, this family works better without you.<eos> Rachel, I need you to help me with something, and I need it quickly.<eos> What is it?<eos> Teddy Doyle needs to access the proceeds from the sale of his company that were put in trust to avoid taxes, and he needs to do it without triggering those taxes.<eos> Louis, are you kidding?<eos> This isn't Dubai.<eos> He's not gonna be able to do that.<eos> I know that, but I need him to be able to anyway.<eos> I'll figure something out. Thanks.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.
I'm not just talking about birthdays, Harvey.<eos> I got sick again, couple years ago.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Why would I?<eos> So that we could have this at the same time? - Marcus...<eos> - No, listen to me.<eos> You know who helped out when Katie was taking me to chemo?<eos> Mom made dinner every night.<eos> Bobby took my kids to school every day, which means... while they might be monsters to you, to my kids, they're Grandma and Grandpa.

We just need to convince the court to accept these phone records.<eos> The problem is we can't convince the court of anything.<eos> I'm not a lawyer yet, and I was hoping you could do it, but then...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've got just the person.<eos> Harvey.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Depends on why you're here.<eos> I'm here to apologize for the way I acted last night.<eos> Is this 'cause Bobby came to see you?
I'm here to apologize for the way I acted last night.<eos> Is this 'cause Bobby came to see you?<eos> No, it's because Marcus got sick, and you took care of him, and he couldn't even tell me that.<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - I'm so angry.<eos> I don't want to be angry anymore, but I don't know how to stop.<eos> Then let me say how sorry I am for all the pain that I have caused you.<eos> You don't need to tell me how sorry you are.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Harvey, we both may have played a part in the last 20 years, but I was an adult, and I put you in that position.

It's... it's just, I had your painting on my wall for the longest time, and I just realized... how much I missed it.<eos> I love you, Harvey.

- We are requesting permission to evict if we don't have a check by 10:00 A.M. tomorrow.<eos> - $3,600.<eos> - Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - This is a job offer.<eos> - When you graduate, you're gonna have to pass the character of fitness test.<eos> - And you think working at your firm looks better than working at mine.<eos> - You're gonna tell me you had nothing to do with Harvey asking me to help you get a law license.<eos> - I wasn't even on her radar.<eos> I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me, just because you can't accept the fact that I don't wanna come back here.<eos> I was trying to help you.
I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me, just because you can't accept the fact that I don't wanna come back here.<eos> I was trying to help you.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> Stop messing with my life!<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> - I came to apologize for yelling at you - You don't have to do that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> I know you only had my best interest at heart.<eos> You always do, and...<eos> I shouldn't have snapped at you.
- She is so much worse than me.<eos> - Is she constantly talking about what a great memory she has? Dresses shitty?<eos> She have man purse?<eos> - Are you done?<eos> You have someplace you gotta be?<eos> - Actually, i am supposed to stay away from our apartment for awhile.<eos> - So anyway, I said to Louis, "i don't care "if most of the associates start in the bullpen. I'm not giving up my office."<eos> - That's great, Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of chardonnay, and I don't think you called me over here to tell me you submitted your application to the bar, or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.<eos> You're right.<eos> I called you over here to tell you that... I put my foot down with Mike.

I put my foot down with Mike.<eos> - You finally told him to pick a hairstyle and stick with it?<eos> - No.<eos> I finally told him that he made me a promise before he went away, and now that he's back and gainfully employed, it's time for him to make an honest woman of me.<eos> - Rachel, I'm so happy for you.

I'm happy for you.<eos> - Still up for being my best man? - Wouldn't miss it for the world.<eos> We going back to the church?<eos> - No, we're gonna do it at our place this time.<eos> - No, you can't do that.<eos> - Yeah, we just wanna keep it small, intimate.<eos> - I understand, but what kinda best man would I be if I didn't offer for you to have it here?<eos> - Pretty shitty one if you ask me.<eos> - So basically you came here to apologize, so you didn't have to get married at your shitty little apartment.<eos> - You think that I'd ask you to be my best man if we had a better location?
- I know, which is why we're having the best sparkling apple cider money can buy.<eos> - Well, in that case...<eos> What are we celebrating?<eos> - The fact that it's your first sonogram this week.<eos> - Louis, about the sonogram...<eos> Joshua asked if he could be there.<eos> - He's the baby's father.<eos> He wants to be in its life.<eos> - Or wants to be in your life.<eos> - Louis, i chose you over him.

- um, excuse me, i just need to- oh, hello, Benjamin.<eos> Have you come to manipulate my hard drive?<eos> Debug my processor?<eos> Reboot my motherboard?<eos> - Please, I just need to update your vox in peace.<eos> - If I wanted my vox updated, I'd be talking to someone with a lot more experience than you.<eos> - Ms. paulsen, i know you know this but I will remind you for the 37th time-- that vox is our computer's operating system, and it needs to be updated once a quarter.<eos> - Once a quarter?<eos> What, are we married?<eos> 'Cause I got news for you.

TheDonna: Please, thisisn'tmy firstrodeo.<eos> You're telling me.<eos> - Donna, could I talk to you for a second?<eos> TheDonna: Of courseyou can .<eos> Whatdoyouneed,hotpants ?<eos> - What--what is that?<eos> - It's a device called the Donna that Benjamin's working on, and it's awesome.<eos> Go ahead, ask it something.<eos> - I don't wanna ask it something.<eos> I wanna ask you something.
I'm gonna be in the same room as him, looking at an image of what he made with her.<eos> How do I not lose my shit?<eos> - You're right.<eos> It is his baby.<eos> And you're gonna want it to have as much love as it possibly can, and that means having a good relationship with its father, because there's nothing more important than family.<eos> You're right.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> - Hey, Mike.<eos> How's it going out there?<eos> What can I do for you?
- That's good work, and we can use that.<eos> But listen, I need you to do something for me.<eos> - You want Marissa to be first chair.<eos> - I think it's for the best.<eos> - Mike, I know why you think this is the right choice, but I can do this.<eos> - I'm sorry, Oliver, but at this point in your career,<eos> I don't think you can.<eos> you said it yourself-- you get flustered in court.<eos> - I know that, but if I'm going to be a real lawyer, I have to get better in trial, and the only way to do that is to get back on the horse.<eos> - And I'm telling you that when the right case comes along, I promise i will let you do that, but this is not the case.
- She put in for it.<eos> Give it back to Oliver.<eos> - I told you he'll lose.<eos> - Then he'll lose.<eos> Now I'm sorry, but I have to go.<eos> - God damn it, this is a woman's life, and you're going to a goddamn movie.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> - Are you f-- listen, we work in a clinic.<eos> Every one of our client's lives is hanging by a thread, and if they lose, they're out on the street, they don't get the surgery, or they get deported.<eos> And I haven't had a life in five years, which is why I hired you, so don't you ever say that to me again.
And I haven't had a life in five years, which is why I hired you, so don't you ever say that to me again.<eos> Look, Oliver's the kind of lawyer we get here.<eos> If he can't handle it, he can't handle it.<eos> That's how it goes.<eos> - Then I wanna petition the court to sit at the table with him.<eos> - No.<eos> - We can ask for a special exemption, and- and I said no, all right?<eos> They will not Grant it, and that is not your place here.<eos> - Then at least I can sit near him, and I can- you hear me right now!<eos> I gave you a chance, because I needed it, but if you risk the reputation of this clinic over one housing case, i will fire you and make sure that you are banned from ever sitting foot in a courtroom again.
is that clear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's clear.<eos> - this is a nice place you got here.<eos> - What are you doing here, Harvey?<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> I gotta figure out how- what if I told you i have a way to get you into the bar?<eos> - What?<eos> - Someone came to us trying to play games with Rachel's character and fitness interview and- wait, what--what the hell are you talking about?<eos> - Relax, I handled it, but now we have a chance to get you in.
- Harvey, there are no free lunches.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> - We need to come up with a lawsuit against velocity data solutions to drive their stock price down.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - What do you mean no?<eos> What--what's wrong with you?<eos> - What's wrong with me is i don't particularly feel like going back to prison, and the last time I checked, fabricating a lawsuit to manipulate a stock is illegal.<eos> - It's not illegal if we find a legitimate suit.<eos> that we'd just be telling ourselves that, just like we told ourselves we weren't colluding with Cahill.<eos> - And that got you out of prison, - Harvey, I'm more a lawyer now than I ever was.
- Hey, I'm doing what I wanted, and I'm helping people, so if you wanna call me a babysitter, you go right ahead, but right now the house is on fire, the kids are in the bedroom,<eos> - Mike, we have an opportunity right now.<eos> It's not gonna present itself again.<eos> - I appreciate that, Harvey.<eos> I do.<eos> But I'm telling you, my answer is no.<eos> - Hey, what's going on?<eos> What's the emergency? Where's Marissa?<eos> - Marissa's gone.<eos> - What do you mean gone? - I mean that you're first chair tomorrow, and we need to get you ready.
- Louis, that is so sweet, but it turns out Joshua can't make it.<eos> - What do you mean he can't make it?<eos> - He was gonna fly in, but something came up with work, so he canceled his flight. - What the hell kind of father is that?<eos> - Louis-- - this is bullshit.<eos> and if he's gonna be father, he needs to be a father.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't even want him to be here in the first place.<eos> - Well, I want him here now. - Louis, I thought you were a more forgiving person than this.<eos> - And I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> - And he's going to. But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.
I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> - Then the court has no choice but to dismiss this case with prejudice.<eos> - Benjamin, before you ask, i already told you- what if I could make it more like you?<eos> is your intuition, your empathy, and your heart.<eos> What if I could make it have that?<eos> - How could you possibly do that?<eos> to learn from your quips, i might be able to give it the ability to learn from your heart, but it would require your help.<eos> - You really think we could do that? - I don't know, but I know we can try.<eos> - Well, then the first thing that you need to learn is never, ever, ever sit in my chair.<eos> - Relax, Benjamin, I'm just messing with you.
- But get out of my chair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Louis, what-- what are you doing here?<eos> - I need to bring you a few things.<eos> - What is all that?<eos> - High school yearbooks, childhood photo albums, and six out of seven of the highlight reels my mother shot of us growing up.<eos> - What happened to the seventh?<eos> - Oh...<eos> Summer of dd.<eos> And if it's all the same to you, I would like to still be able to have sex again.

All right. Just calm down.<eos> - Think I give a shit about your family? - Hmm?<eos> - Just...<eos> - You wanna see your Rocky grow up, huh?<eos> - Calm down. Calm down.<eos> I'm gonna need a little time.<eos> I have to find a captain.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Twenty-four hours.<eos> And if you fuck me, Kevin, I will come back and kill you and all your family.
Relax. Unplug.<eos> Listen to music.<eos> See me in a month.<eos> I made extra salad.<eos> What'd the doctor say?<eos> Oh, he's not worried, Mom.<eos> He just says I need rest is all.<eos> Good.<eos> Nolan stopped by.<eos> He wants to see you.
- Put the gun down. - Go.<eos> Just go.<eos> - Kevin.<eos> - Go.<eos> Get the fuck out of here!<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Kevin, put the gun down.<eos> We have a baby, Kevin.<eos> I love you.
- He can't fix it, Belle.<eos> This is what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> No one can fix this.<eos> You're better off without me.<eos> Rocky, he's better if I'm gone.<eos> This is the only thing that I can do to help. You shut up.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> If anyone deserves to go, it's John.<eos> He's not gonna take you away from me.
This is the only thing that I can do to help. You shut up.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> If anyone deserves to go, it's John.<eos> He's not gonna take you away from me.<eos> You understand that?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You're gonna go to him.<eos> And you're gonna make him fix this.<eos> And he's gonna save you, and he's gonna save your family.
Fuck. I knew this was a bad idea.<eos> I told Belle this was a mistake to talk to you.<eos> I knew you were gonna give me that judgment.<eos> That thing you do.<eos> That "you're such a fuckup" stare.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Why do you do that?<eos> I mean, I'm seriously asking you.<eos> Why...?<eos> Why is it so important for you to be superior to me?
Why do you do that?<eos> I mean, I'm seriously asking you.<eos> Why...?<eos> Why is it so important for you to be superior to me?<eos> Me?<eos> I mean, I'm a fucking...<eos> I'm an asshole.<eos> Everybody knows it.<eos> I've fucked up my whole life.<eos> But why do you get so much satisfaction by feeling superior to me?
- Did you talk to him?<eos> - Fuck no.<eos> You know he was talking to Chelsea at the trial, right?<eos> Did you see that?<eos> What do you think he knows, John?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> - You don't have a number on him, do you?<eos> - Fuck no.<eos> I don't know shit about that kid.<eos> What exactly is it that you want me to do for you?
But there was a heaviness in the air.<eos> And I tried.<eos> I really tried to put it out of my mind for years.<eos> But I was right.<eos> You are, all of you.<eos> But you more than anybody.<eos> You've never really been happy.<eos> I could feel that.<eos> And I guess I just thought that I...<eos> I was so in love with you that... maybe... maybe I could help change that.

Yeah?<eos> I'm gonna need, uh...<eos> I'm gonna need some more time. Um, a few more hours.<eos> It's not easy to find someone.<eos> Fuck your family... Shut the fuck up.<eos> Don't you fucking say that!<eos> Listen, just...<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. Just give me a couple more hours.<eos> I'll call you back in two hours.
Danny wasted his own life.<eos> And then he blamed everyone else for it, okay?<eos> That is his fault.<eos> That is not your fault.<eos> And you.<eos> You didn't even have the strength to be born.<eos> They thought you were gonna die inside of me.<eos> I was in so much pain, so they cut you out.<eos> But I shouldn't have let them.<eos> I should have made you fight your way out.

I let you be weak.
Sarah was so delicate.<eos> So tiny.<eos> And Meg came out so fast.<eos> I hardly knew she was there.<eos> My sweet girls.<eos> - Please, let's just go.<eos> - But you.<eos> John.<eos> You tore me when you came out.<eos> You were covered in blood when they put you on my chest.

You remember.<eos> See that over there?<eos> - Did you ask her out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And?<eos> - She said no.<eos> That's her loss, bro.<eos> She asked me if you were my brother.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Maybe she likes you instead.
Come on.<eos> Hey, I would not do that to you.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're my fucking brother.<eos> And her friend said that she wants you to ask her out, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, so she's playing hard to get.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's a good thing.<eos> That means this girl Dana really likes you.
He wants the truth.<eos> He does not wanna know that.<eos> 'Cause that's all he's asking.<eos> He just wants to know what happened.<eos> John.<eos> Our whole lives you couldn't trust Mom and Dad.<eos> They lied.<eos> Change the family.<eos> You can help him right now.<eos> And that's what he's asking you.
In Cuba.<eos> They can't extradite us there.<eos> Kevin, where are you right now?<eos> About a mile past Marathon.<eos> Smooth sailing.<eos> - You took the inn boat?<eos> - It's too slow.<eos> I got a guy.<eos> You're not gonna make it.<eos> The Coast Guard's gonna pick you up.

Eugene, where are you?<eos> I need you.
"To whom it may concern...<eos> Dear everybody, my death has nothing to do with that asshole Tucker."<eos> "I hereby leave buckeroo to Suzy k., my only friend" who cared enough to bring him carrots.<eos> The rest of my stuff should be kept exactly where it is, like a shrine so people can remember me.<eos> Under no circumstances are my brothers "ever allowed in my room."<eos> "for Tucker, I'll leave a list" of all the guys I've had really great sex with so he can be jealous for all eternity...<eos> "Greg, Houston, Cody h., Cody d."<eos> Cody d.?<eos> Well it was just anal so I'll still get into heaven.<eos> The part about you is at the end.
Make sure they bury me in that dress.<eos> Look, iil'm sorry, Tracy, but il'm not gonna help you with this.<eos> No way. You have to.<eos> You're the only person I can count on to do what I say.<eos> Look.<eos> I know this hurts, but dying is not the answer.<eos> Living is.<eos> Look, Tracy, god would not want you to give up on yourself just 'cause...<eos> Just 'cause Jenny lewin's got a big mouth.<eos> He's probably got a miracle waiting for you right around the corner.
Tracy?<eos> Tracy?<eos> Eugene, you leave my daughter alone.<eos> Eugene, you answer me right now!<eos> You monster!<eos> You get your hands off my daughter, Eugene!<eos> I'm calling your father right now!<eos> Eugene! Eugene!<eos> Eugene, where are you?<eos> I need you.
I told you a bunch of times, okay?<eos> I got a stomachache.<eos> It's like piercing, sharp, grabby kinda of feeling.<eos> Sharp, grabby kind of feeling?<eos> Is that all you got to say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Feel better.<eos> Don't be mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you?
Shit.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> How do you know this guy again?<eos> Who? Denis?<eos> We go way back.<eos> He's hysterical.<eos> My god, man.<eos> You look great!<eos> Come here.<eos> It's good to see you.
He's a preacher.<eos> Preacher.<eos> Man of god, denis.<eos> We're on a really big mission.<eos> It's important stuff.<eos> Really, it is.<eos> "Three stooges." It's a classic, isn't it?<eos> In any language that's good.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll leave you to it.
What matter is I screwed him, and now I'm here in his backyard.<eos> Stupid New Orleans. All right.<eos> We... we could always just leave.<eos> You know, I'm a big proponent of running away from your problems. Yeah?<eos> Well, Jesse's not.<eos> As long as he thinks god's here, he's not going anywhere.<eos> I'm sure he might if he knew about your troubles.<eos> If he knew about my troubles, he'd make it a whole lot worse. Believe me.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's your exfiancé, and he loves you.
Some kind of coverup.<eos> Some sort of group.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out why.<eos> Well, that's cool.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, we're at this guy denis' place.<eos> Cassidy keeps talking about how great he is, but I think he pretty much hates Cassidy's guts, so...<eos> But he got cereal and poptarts.<eos> Is that why you called me?<eos> I'm just filling you in.
Previously on "The Magicians"...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Don't you fucking touch her.<eos> Fine, I'll take you first.
- Move!<eos> Wait.<eos> I had Reynard.<eos> I had The Beast.<eos> Man, fuck this.<eos> We're out.<eos> The chain was the only thing keeping my hand from-- Sorry.<eos> Not my problem.<eos> Do you know what a Niffin is?<eos> It's when too much runs through you, consumes you.
It was so much simpler when there was just one giant evil dick trying to kill us.<eos> - Now we're just--<eos> - Grown-ups.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> I have an idea... to help you. - Like a loophole?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're gonna ironically abandon me here to go find it.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I promise.<eos> I know you...
Alice was hurt a lot worse, Penny.<eos> She--she died.<eos> - Budget?<eos> - Citizen petitions.<eos> I want everyone to stop wanting things.<eos> Great time to ask for something?<eos> Your father makes knives for a living and knows where I sleep, so... Ask away.<eos> I'm know I'm not precisely the type you'd most likely choose, and I wasn't so experienced when we were first together, but you're so great at it.<eos> You're--you're huge, and it's so good.<eos> And, Eliot, I don't know how to politely ask you to fuck me.
So I did.<eos> We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich...<eos> half an hour ago.<eos> Then I ate it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's been a long time since I've had a hot shower.<eos> How you feeling? Uh...<eos> Better... nap, seeing you alive, magic methadone... methadone.
Then I ate it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's been a long time since I've had a hot shower.<eos> How you feeling? Uh...<eos> Better... nap, seeing you alive, magic methadone... methadone.<eos> Thanks... for all of it.<eos> So, um, how did you find me?<eos> After asking around a bit, I heard about a girl who was doing miracles for a quick fix.<eos> I called it "turning tricks."<eos> You think I'm judging you, I'm not.
I was a patient years ago.<eos> The Centaurs saved my life when no one else could.<eos> Now I try to repay that debt by serving them as a nurse.<eos> - The Centaurs?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Horse people.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - How--how long have I--<eos> Three weeks.<eos> Your injuries were severe.<eos> Your friends were called away, but they left that for you.
I cared about her, too.<eos> For what, like, ten minutes, including foreplay?<eos> Are you mad at me because I cared too much or too little?<eos> I'm mad 'cause you fucked up the one thing that<eos> - we were counting on you for. - You want to blame me?<eos> It was your cacodemon that killed her.<eos> That was not Alice.<eos> Alice was gone.<eos> So you just saved the day, huh? Could we just... convalesce from our horrible injuries separately, please?<eos> Nice to see you, too, man.

I'm going to.<eos> Nope.<eos> Damn it, Quentin!<eos> Sorry, I just--I panicked.<eos> I don't love blood.<eos> Who loves blood?<eos> I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!
Damn it, Quentin!<eos> Sorry, I just--I panicked.<eos> I don't love blood.<eos> Who loves blood?<eos> I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!<eos> You are so fucking pathetic, you--you--you floppy-haired, limp dicked dork.<eos> Fucking--no wonder Alice couldn't get off on you.
Right seems to be the popular direction.<eos> Julia?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Look, I can explain.<eos> - No. After you jumped in and screwed everything up with Penny, Alice died killing your little friend Martin.<eos> Then Quentin was almost ripped in half.<eos> And you have the balls to come here.<eos> Look, if you guys had trusted me, both Reynard and The Beast would be dead.<eos> None of that would have happened.<eos> Quentin should have left you in your little hedge hole, trading rim jobs for spells.
Look, if you guys had trusted me, both Reynard and The Beast would be dead.<eos> None of that would have happened.<eos> Quentin should have left you in your little hedge hole, trading rim jobs for spells.<eos> You actually think because you go to this bullshit school that you're better than me.<eos> I think I didn't get my friends killed.<eos> You don't have friends.<eos> You have people that are so afraid of you, they'd rather be on your side.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> Well... and you have no one.<eos> And you deserve no one. Look, I don't expect you to care 'cause this doesn't directly affect your hair or your social life, but since you let Reynard free, he has murdered over a dozen women, and this book might be my last shot at killing him.
It's Alice.<eos> Quentin, look, I... I know how you feel, man.<eos> Before, when your wards were slipping, I...<eos> I know.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - No, hey, no, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> You--you can't... you can't puss out right now.<eos> Think about Alice.<eos> She needs you, man.
Quentin, look, I... I know how you feel, man.<eos> Before, when your wards were slipping, I...<eos> I know.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - No, hey, no, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> You--you can't... you can't puss out right now.<eos> Think about Alice.<eos> She needs you, man.<eos> I need you.
- I'm gonna die.<eos> - We don't have that much time.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You don't know where I was.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> Marina, your clock is running out, okay?<eos> Please, you are the strongest person that I have ever met.<eos> I need you to pull it together now, and I need you to tell me.<eos> I need you to tell me about the thing that killed you.
40 years ago, she banished Reynard from Earth.<eos> That's where he was until you summoned him.<eos> That's where he was until you brought him back.<eos> I'm sorr--I'm sorry.<eos> Hi.<eos> Don't run.<eos> Are you gonna?<eos> What's the deal?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's kind of ignoring me. Yo, White Lady, we caught you.
She's kind of ignoring me. Yo, White Lady, we caught you.<eos> Hey, show some respect.<eos> Pardon me... Miss Lady?<eos> It hurts.<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> Uh... Why have you come?<eos> That's my arrow.<eos> You have to give me what I ask.<eos> Obviously, you turd.<eos> Look at you.
Someone's been rebuilt... and so cleverly.<eos> Feel that?<eos> Could you not?<eos> Here's a riddle.<eos> How much do you have to lose before you're no longer yourself?<eos> I don't know. Why don't you tell me?<eos> What is it, Quentin Coldwater, that you ache for?<eos> You have a crown and the power to reshape the very ether to your whim.<eos> What else could you possibly want?<eos> Um, technically speaking, uh, we both caught you, so...
No!<eos> What did you do to him? That screaming was irritating.<eos> He'll wake when he's healed.<eos> Now, I can't nap until I've granted your wish.<eos> I'd like to be happy.<eos> Could you do that? I can do wonders.<eos> But you should know... there's nothing I can give you that will soothe your Shade.<eos> There's only what I can take away.<eos> You'd take away my memories of Alice?<eos> Yes. I would free you completely.
The truth is your marriage wasn't a fucking funfair 100% of the time, so you had to have yourself a little escape hatch pussy at the ready.<eos> How's it going, lads?<eos> Yeah, I was just saying, do you know who you look like?<eos> Your PE teacher?<eos> I was just partying if you want to come out.<eos> You ever been up on the roof of this place? It's pretty cool.<eos> You can see for like... 1000 miles.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I love a good roof.<eos> As I look at you, all the reasons I fell in love with you have come flying back so much that I think I might throw up.

Well, nothing, it's just that...<eos> Shit.<eos> Who were you on the phone to?<eos> Harita.<eos> She wants to meet.<eos> - That's good, isn't it?<eos> - I don't know. We'll see.<eos> But it's lunch at Tanaka, so I don't care what she has to say.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Well, just, you know, whatever you decide, it's your decision.
You're going to a chamber music concert with Melissa?<eos> On the South Bank I think.<eos> We're meeting at a bar before.<eos> She's got the tickets.<eos> Oh, and Frankie's watching Million Dollar Baby.<eos> I sort of put it on by mistake and now he's really enjoying it very quietly, so...<eos> Have fun at your concerto.<eos> OK.<eos> Get up.<eos> - Hey, why don't we give you a ride? - No, I'm grand.

Don't be silly.
I mean, it was all right, got it out my system, but...<eos> - I meant telling the truth.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.<eos> Right, I have to go because my life coach has just arrived.<eos> - OK, sure, well, can...?<eos> ...be the best-looking person, but be ugly in yourself and it makes you unattractive.<eos> So, you found a receipt for a pill you've bought in the past and you've got an uncomfortable feeling in your tum-tum.<eos> That's it.<eos> Why didn't she tell me? I mean... Do you tell her every time you pop to Boots for a tube of haemorrhoid cream?<eos> I'd understand if she'd bought a fucking speed boat without telling you... it's a wee morning after pill!
I'd understand if she'd bought a fucking speed boat without telling you... it's a wee morning after pill!<eos> What else was she supposed to do? You said yourself you blew an historic load into her<eos> - in a public park. - We have a wavelength.<eos> We communicate verbally and non-verbally.<eos> And something feels fucked up and not right.<eos> OK, let me ask you something... can Sharon hide what she's feeling about anything?<eos> - No.<eos> - OK, I wanted you to say it.<eos> So you are going to find out, one way or another, sooner or later.<eos> If she's done nothing wrong, bully for you.
Hello there. Erm, so, do you want to tell me how you hit your head, then?<eos> - Um... - We were downstairs in the kitchen...<eos> Sorry, actually, just need to hear it from Frankie, if that's OK.<eos> - I fell off the chair in the bathroom...<eos> - Nothing happened?<eos> Well, I mean, nearly nothing.<eos> Like, close to nothing.<eos> If the choices are nothing and...<eos> You know, you can pretty much round it down to nothing. I guess he...<eos> - I guess he kissed me... - He kissed you.

I guess he...<eos> - I guess he kissed me... - He kissed you.<eos> He kissed you...<eos> so you were like, "Mm!<eos> Mm!"<eos> So he forced himself on you.<eos> Did you file a police report? I mean, a man kissed you against your will...
- What if I cut open my eye? I mean, best, best case scenario, you'd let me use your Oyster card.<eos> - That's not true!<eos> - Yes, it is. And then you'd text me a shopping list while I'm in the emergency room.<eos> Do you want to break up with me?<eos> Do I want to break up with you?<eos> What are we, 14?<eos> Well, what do you want to do?<eos> I know you think I'm a terrible person, but I guess I was angry.<eos> Don't do that, don't blame me.<eos> I was upset about the money you gave Fergal and the French hussy and the fact that, you know, you wouldn't apologise or admit that you'd done anything wrong.

Don't put that on me!<eos> Well, I'm just saying, it's a tough time.<eos> Fuck you for a second, OK?
And, you know, it's a tough time.<eos> There's a lot of...<eos> Brexit, you know?<eos> Your new president. Don't put that on me!<eos> Well, I'm just saying, it's a tough time.<eos> Fuck you for a second, OK?<eos> Fuck your guilt or whatever.<eos> The bottom line is, they need a mom, and I hate the idea of whatever you did with him less than I love them.<eos> And what are the other options?<eos> I leave you, I split up our family?
What the fuck?<eos> Okay, so, I'm not a doctor, and there's a chance I'm never gonna be one, but my best guess is that this is a baby.<eos> Congratulations, Mama!<eos> It's not a baby.<eos> I'm gonna throw you a shower.<eos> I found a place with a great patio.<eos> I bet it's a pulled muscle.<eos> Or... I heard about this thing where a spider crawled into this dude's skin and laid a bunch of eggs there, then died and then the eggs hatched, and there were, like, a thousand dead spiders all up in this guy's skin.<eos> Do you think it's that?<eos> I'm gonna kill you for even suggesting it.

Aw.<eos> I'm gonna love you no matter what.
My ear's bleeding!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As a result of an adulterous affair!<eos> I don't have much to say to you about that.<eos> Okay!<eos> Sophia, where are you?<eos> Shane just got this new game.<eos> He and Dax are totally shredding!<eos> Also, did I mention that Shane's here?<eos> Annie, I'm the one who called you.
I'm just gonna call in sick, and I'll come meet you.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm okay, really.<eos> All right. You are gonna be fine.<eos> I know this, I'm very smart like that.<eos> - Ms. Connick Jr.?<eos> - Yup, that's me.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Love you in case I die.
No, don't do that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm okay, really.<eos> All right. You are gonna be fine.<eos> I know this, I'm very smart like that.<eos> - Ms. Connick Jr.?<eos> - Yup, that's me.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Love you in case I die.<eos> Love you in case I die. For real.
Yup.<eos> You're good.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Yup...<eos> Whoa, hold up.<eos> ID, please? - Yeah, I left it in my car.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> I can't let you in.
All right, as requested, all the old vintage dresses I don't wear anymore.<eos> Probably unusable.<eos> Oh. No.<eos> Try it on.<eos> See, the lady at the shop said I could belt it.<eos> That lady fucking lied to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ooh, all right. Goin' right for it.<eos> I don't know if the sleeves were the problem.<eos> Ooh... Be still, you nut.
What is happening right now?<eos> - Oh, hi. - I need a break.<eos> - Getting food. You want in?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Maybe La Taqueria.<eos> Yeah, let me think about it.<eos> What are you listening to?<eos> That's Lee Iacocca on management strategies.<eos> Mm. Dax has all of his seminars on CD for school.<eos> So, you just thought that you'd pop one in and chill?
And charge you five bucks more for the chance to get a fourth-degree burn from your plate.<eos> No, thank you, fajita.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Well, I don't know that I'd go that far, but yes, it is a rip-off.<eos> Did you get the chance to sell that dead lady's clothes?<eos> No. I can't do anything until I find the perfect name for my store.<eos> - That's...<eos> - You. You are the problem.<eos> Another ignorant man walking around like he owns the place.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?
Oh. I'm getting a very strong feeling from you.<eos> You're on the precipice.<eos> You're feeling something, and it's...<eos> It could be big, but you're not sure what it is.<eos> Yes, awesome!<eos> Okay, is there a specific name? Something that describes me or my soul?<eos> Hopefully, one or two words that could fit into a URL?<eos> No, he doesn't really work in specifics like that.<eos> It's just more of feeling...<eos> That's true and I'm also not feeling you right now.
You know, it's none of my business, but it sounds like you... are the reason your relationship imploded.<eos> That's fair. Yeah.<eos> What about you?<eos> You ever cheat on anybody?<eos> No, that's shitty.<eos> That's what bad people do.<eos> Let's get on the trolley without paying.<eos> This is the Rice-A-Roni shot.<eos> Come on, city...<eos> I need you.
- They're the first to go.<eos> - Sounds like you're afraid of earthquakes.<eos> No, because you can't fall off an earthquake and land in shark-infested waters.<eos> That's true.<eos> Yeah. Sophia is not going out like that.<eos> I decide when, where I kick the bucket.<eos> And how's that?<eos> Oh, I just live 400 more years cryogenically and then someone accidentally unplugs my head freezer and I thaw and die.<eos> That's how my uncle went.<eos> I miss you, Big Bill.
Someplace magical.<eos> Behold, the secret gem stashed in the touristy butthole of San Francisco...<eos> Jolly Jack.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, I love this weird little fucker.<eos> You think he's done laughing and then he just keeps laughing.<eos> This is really weird.<eos> - Do it again.<eos> - Okay, ready?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.
Just come on.<eos> This fucking girl.<eos> ♪ I'm gonna tell 'em why I'm gonna tell 'em why ♪<eos> ♪ You used to love it ♪ ♪ You used to love it, ooh To ride my broom, honey ♪<eos> ♪ I used to love it ♪<eos> ♪ I used to love to ride the range With ya, baby ♪<eos> ♪ Sing the song ♪<eos> ♪ I ain't nothin' but a, hey hey ♪ ♪ Nothin' but a ♪<eos> ♪ A hey, a hey, a hey ♪<eos> ♪ I said you said I turn you on I turned you inside out ♪

Come on, now, they're all waiting.<eos> No, Mom!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, it's all right.<eos> If you don't love Kevin yet, you will.<eos> We all will.<eos> Nobody can understand you, sweetie.
Or... this.<eos> Take it in.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No one who feels as passionately as you do should be kept from a place like this because of money.<eos> Not if I can do anything about it, which I can.<eos> You're gonna give me $20,000?<eos> No, man.<eos> Come on. Please.<eos> I'm just gonna let you in.
- Okay.<eos> But this isn't about me being right or her being a lying sack of shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know what I'm gonna do.<eos> I will assure ladyshopper99 that I can get the dress cleaned and back in her arms before the wedding.<eos> Or you let me keep the dress and you kill ladyshopper99.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> You get caught, you go to jail.<eos> But you're released early for good behavior.<eos> I'm there to pick you up, I'm wearing the dress.
I have no money.<eos> - Hey, wait. This is about me, Kevin.<eos> I'm gonna need a Diet Coke with a lot of lime.<eos> Sophia!<eos> - Sophia?<eos> - Sophia!<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Come in, come in, come in.<eos> - This is for you.
Wow. Yeah.<eos> Well, it's the least I could do after being such a Nancy Miller this morning.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You didn't "borrow" my rice cooker for two years.<eos> Did you get your dress back in time?<eos> Yeah, just barely.<eos> Was she happy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Well, either way, I'm proud of you.
I bought a bot.<eos> Okay, what is a bot?<eos> Bot is a computer program that takes friends of friends, and then...<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - No, that ad's a trick.<eos> You're not gonna win a free Sidekick by clicking on JLo's eyes.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Your top eight.<eos> There's no Annie.<eos> Oh, yeah. I had to bump you.
It doesn't frame your face at all.<eos> You're so cool and beautiful, and you're hiding it from the world.<eos> And I guarantee that if you weren't, no one would've been mad that you stole a ball from a kid.<eos> Well, I've said more than my share.<eos> Will you... cut my hair sometime?<eos> Sure.<eos> I just need a trim.<eos> You need more than a trim.<eos> Annie.<eos> I don't wanna upset you, but... I don't know if I wanna go tonight.
Yeah, and Veronica's the third one that no one remembers.<eos> Veronica's harmless.<eos> She calls me Coach.<eos> I don't know why, but it's a really aggressive move on her part.<eos> Maybe she thinks you're the coach of Team Friendship.<eos> You don't think it's weird that she's never given us drink tickets?<eos> Why does she get to choose who's worthy all because she's got these little stubs in her kangaroo pouch of power? I mean, come on.<eos> Fanny packs are out, bitch.<eos> Like it or not, she runs oldies night, and there's nothing more fun.<eos> So, you have got to dig deep and switch that sitch.
Drink it up, drink it down.<eos> - Drink it all around.<eos> - That's so fucking funny!<eos> Shmemily, you made it.<eos> Where's Power Tits tonight, the library?<eos> All right, come on.<eos> ♪ I better be moving on ♪ - I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> No, no, I can't hear you.
No one's been in here.<eos> But the sign says reserved.<eos> So, if you wanna sit, there's always the bar.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Section's been empty all night.<eos> Hell, it's always empty.<eos> And I'm Coach.<eos> So, give me some of them drink tickets and take a lap already.<eos> Come on!<eos> That's why I call you Coach.

- Mm-mm. Then we're gonna get there and share a hotel room for two nights.<eos> This thing is stocked with four peanut butter and honey sandwiches, ten granola bars, and one sleeve of original Pringles.<eos> Hey, George.<eos> So, what now?<eos> Just find another ride?<eos> Yup, plan stays the same.<eos> I gotta go pee.<eos> I see you looking at me.<eos> Probably 'cause I'm like a supernova of good vibes, right?<eos> - Hot enough for you?
I don't know if you knew that, which... yeah, just leads back to the biting, so...<eos> Come on, Sophia.<eos> It might be time to rethink the whole Coachella plan.<eos> Plan stays the same.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, the tooth fairy doesn't have to give that much, Daphne.<eos> Is it a molar?<eos> Couple of girls just walked in.<eos> They got dirty necks.<eos> I'll have to call you back.
That's good. - Oh, shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah? How's that?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Am I hurting you?<eos> - No. Everything's fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Is this good for you?
It will help me not cheat on tour.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I like to keep it cas, remember?<eos> Cas, totally cas.<eos> So cas that I'm not even finishing the word.<eos> 'Cause finishing words is for uptight guys in suits, and I...<eos> - You know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's just cas for me.<eos> - That was to get you to stop talking.
- You know, to save trees. - Um...<eos> I'm actually not leaving.<eos> I've been thinking about it and... I decided not to quit.<eos> - I'm gonna take this back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Trust me on it, it'll be better for both of us.<eos> So, uh, why the sudden change of heart?<eos> Yesterday you said some pretty hurtful things about this suckhole of a job.<eos> Well, I just think the smarter play is not to make any big moves right now.<eos> I thought you said, as soon as you got your insurance card, you were gonna get the surgery, so that you could, and I quote:
Sophia alive, y'all.<eos> Hey, there's hot doc.<eos> I should say something to him.<eos> But I don't wanna sound crazy.<eos> But I won't, because I'm totally lucid right now.<eos> Not like those other weak-brained schmucks.<eos> All right, Sophia.<eos> Impress him with your...<eos> You're hot.<eos> I love you.
You know what I think about?<eos> How we used to move around a lot.<eos> You know, before coming here.<eos> You were always having to make new friends.<eos> - Kids be dicks, yo.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, I remember this one time, I took you to the park.<eos> We were living in Indiana.<eos> You must've been, I don't know, seven or eight.<eos> And you wanted to play tag with this group of neighborhood kids, but... they wouldn't let you.

Sweet Annie.<eos> So glad you're here.<eos> I came as soon as I could.<eos> And your dad was here, too, but he had to go to work.<eos> And that guy just gets hotter as he ages.<eos> And let me tell you, I charmed the hell out of him.<eos> He was all like, "Take care of Sophia." And I was all like,<eos> "Oh, well, well, well."<eos> He was like, "Hey, please, try to sell her on college.<eos> She listens to you." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
- For real this time.<eos> - Just reaching here. Uh... Is this because you have a rule against dating coworkers?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no. That's not it.<eos> - No.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Well...<eos> All right, well, this conversation's going swimmingly for old Rick.<eos> But hey.<eos> Got something for you.
Watch it!<eos> I'm doing business over here.<eos> That's right.<eos> I want all of it.<eos> Sorry about your theater.<eos> We did a lot of good work here.<eos> Important work.<eos> I think I'm gonna take that advertising job in Seattle.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Oh, fuck you, Kyle!
Are you a murderer?<eos> I am not a murderer.<eos> I'm Gail.<eos> Gail.<eos> I own Remembrances.<eos> You bought a pair of pants from me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Remembrances.<eos> How weird.<eos> I've been talking about you.
You went too far.<eos> You should never have cut those pants.<eos> I wouldn't do it if it was one of a kind. You know, I wouldn't cut couture.<eos> It's cold comfort, Sophia.<eos> If you wanted an altered version, you should've found a comparable fabric and used it as a pattern.<eos> And then, if you're like me, you should have wrapped the original garment in acid-free paper, put it in a box, and saved it for future generations to enjoy.<eos> - No one would do that.<eos> - I do.<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> I just sat on a bus for nine hours, all the way from Reno, to ask you to do better.
Why not?<eos> It's fun.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I'm a night bird.<eos> Let me fly.<eos> - Do you live here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just not very well.<eos> Careful.<eos> Look at you.

- Would you take 300 for it?<eos> - No.<eos> I'll take two.<eos> Deal.<eos> Here are two crisp hundred-dollar bills.<eos> I'm sorry, I have to do this.<eos> You really don't.<eos> - You have nice forearms.<eos> He does?<eos> Mobias, where is it that you fall on the wide spectrum of sexuality and possibilities?
- You have nice forearms.<eos> He does?<eos> Mobias, where is it that you fall on the wide spectrum of sexuality and possibilities?<eos> Uh, not that it's any of your business, but typically, in the small chance that I do feel anything, I do enjoy the touch of a woman.<eos> But if you're asking my preference, hmm, that would be self-pleasure... with a bowl of room-temperature...<eos> - Got it.<eos> Glad I asked. Saved you, Gail.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - That does change some things.<eos> This may surprise you, but I have over 600 episodes of The People's Court on tape.
This is delicious, yo.<eos> You know... uh... my mother wasn't around either.<eos> She left when I was 12.<eos> She took her clothes with her.<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> As far away from my dad as possible.<eos> Energy 92.7 and we're on Wednesday-morning barf patrol!<eos> Sophia, I'm glad we could finally agree to stop disagreeing.<eos> Thanks for the new memories.<eos> I want you to have this.
Sophia, I'm glad we could finally agree to stop disagreeing.<eos> Thanks for the new memories.<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> Gail.<eos> PS, I've done butt stuff.<eos> Hello, dog.<eos> You are dog, yes!<eos> You're very dog, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I like you.
I'd probably end up chained to a wall while some murder puppet hands me a dull knife. Ugh!<eos> Those movies are disgusting.<eos> Did you see Saw?<eos> Oh, I saw Saw.<eos> Did you see Saw?<eos> Oh, I totally saw Saw.<eos> - Shane, did you see Saw?<eos> - Don't want any part in this.<eos> Come on, you have to play along.<eos> I'm still mad at you.
And Oprah told me that 99 percent of women are wearing the wrong bra size.<eos> So, I go to Victoria's Secret, and find out that you get half off a bra if you open a credit card, so, I did.<eos> But then I moved.<eos> Never got the bill.<eos> Hence, never paid it.<eos> And this fucking bill, for like 19 bucks, ends up obliterating my credit.<eos> And the real dick punch, the bra never fit.<eos> And I only wore it like twice.<eos> So, really, the lesson here is,<eos> - never think you're smarter than Oprah.
- Don't you dare say it!<eos> I'm not asking my dad for help.<eos> No, no.<eos> I will find someone else.<eos> Anyone else.<eos> Maybe I could make up a guy to cosign.<eos> - You mean a guy like Henry...<eos> - Riffraff!<eos> The perfect fake boyfriend.<eos> Creepy randos just will not harass you at a bar if they think you're dating a smokejumper.
Oh, no.<eos> Don't use Henry, though.<eos> That's fraud.<eos> It's generally frowned upon.<eos> You seem nice.<eos> Can you cosign?<eos> Come on. No one our age can be a cosigner.<eos> You gotta have, like, savings and assets and shit.<eos> I do not wanna ask my dad.<eos> Maybe he'll surprise you.
You are here to buff.<eos> This is not the night to ask funny stories from when I was a kid, or lame shit like that.<eos> - I'll buff the way I wanna buff.<eos> - No stories.<eos> - I'd like to hear two stories.<eos> - Zero stories.<eos> One story it is, okay.<eos> Here he comes.<eos> - Dad, hi.<eos> Good to see you.
But there's one problem.<eos> My apartment is too crowded.<eos> With no room for new inventory, these awesome graphs I made will start going in the opposite direction.<eos> For your perusal.<eos> Now, I have a lead on a new office space and enough cash to put down months of rent up front.<eos> The jerk-off landlord won't rent it to me without a cosigner.<eos> That's why you were on time.<eos> I don't remember the last time I said this... but I really need your help.<eos> Motherfucking bar graphs!<eos> - I am so proud of you.
Hey, don't forget.<eos> Today's the last day to ship that order to London.<eos> Yes.<eos> Solid reminder.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> We inter-natch.<eos> We inter-natch for days.<eos> We inter-natch for datch!<eos> We inter-natch for datch, batch!<eos> - Love you, in case I die.

I mean, she totally could.<eos> I've never asked her.<eos> - I should ask her. - Yeah, you should.<eos> Then again, a career in makeup has always been my dream.<eos> I just don't know what to do.<eos> This is your Sliding Doors moment.<eos> You know, I never saw that movie.<eos> I bought a ticket and then didn't go.<eos> I always wondered where my life would be if I'd seen it.<eos> Well, just... think about what makes you happy.
Annie, I need your help.<eos> Right here, Sophia.<eos> I've got all this vintage stuff.<eos> Singapore called.<eos> They need a million more blazers.<eos> Typical Singapore.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I just filled the order.<eos> They should be getting them... now.<eos> Annie, what will I ever do without you?
So, what's your sitch?<eos> Single? It's complicated?<eos> 'Cause we can make it complicated.<eos> Oh, that's real nice.<eos> Go invisible on me.<eos> You're like a six at best.<eos> I'm here now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do I want?<eos> Are you seriously that upset about me not hiring you?
I'm the one who created this company from nothing.<eos> I'm the vision.<eos> I'm Nasty Gal.<eos> Everything you do could be done by an intern.<eos> I'm sorry, but you're...<eos> Watch it.<eos> Replaceable.<eos> What?<eos> Just say it.<eos> Fuck you.

Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> - I quit.<eos> - You can't quit a job that you don't have.<eos> No, I quit this.<eos> Us.<eos> You wanna leave?<eos> Great.<eos> I don't need someone hanging on to my coattails.<eos> I was fine before you, and I'll be fine after you.
So, speak freely.<eos> I avoid driving downtown because it scares me!<eos> About Nasty Gal.<eos> What are we going to do about her?<eos> She's threatening our livelihoods.<eos> She's completely lost her mind.<eos> We all eventually lose our minds.<eos> Did no one read the link I sent about chemtrails?<eos> Find another outlet, Sharon.<eos> We're all worried about you.
Nope.<eos> ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪<eos> ♪ "Glory to the newborn king" ♪<eos> ♪ Peace on earth and mercy mild ♪<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> No one cares!<eos> Sophia, did you just tell the Mission Street-wide Gay Men's Chorus to shut the fuck up in the season of Yule?<eos> Sorry, Lionel.<eos> I didn't see you there.
Fuck eBay.<eos> Fuck Christmas.<eos> Fuck Annie, fuck Dad, and fuck ye merry gentlemen!<eos> Sophia, it's Dad.<eos> Just checking to see if you're coming here for Christmas dinner.<eos> Not if Christ himself took me on mule-back.<eos> Hey.<eos> - But if not...<eos> - Oh, we are not.<eos> I wanted to let you know that I'm here for you.

Sophia, what a surprise.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> I'm just finishing up a Hungry-Man.<eos> Cut the fake hospitality.<eos> I know it was you.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> It's just business.<eos> You of all people can surely understand that.<eos> Don't you hoist me on my own petard.<eos> eBay kicked you off, Sophia.
Okay. Well, you can't be back here, then.<eos> Actually, I'm looking for Kathleen Downing.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> You know her name.<eos> She's in there.<eos> Sophia?<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> It is you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at you.
But I was really living in the harmony of our duet.<eos> Oh, I felt it, too.<eos> Symbiosis.<eos> And who is this?<eos> Oh, this is Colette.<eos> She's my manicurist.<eos> Yep.<eos> I do nails.<eos> - Doing nails?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - How's that going for you?
I mean, it wasn't my dream to be a mother.<eos> But your father was...<eos> We... were doing so well.<eos> And then... suddenly, he just stopped believing in me.<eos> Why?<eos> It's what he does.<eos> He crushes dreams.<eos> There are a lot of things I wasn't around to teach you.<eos> But here's something that I can:<eos> in life, the only one who can make you happy is you.
This entire theater lacks artistic merit.<eos> And you... you are a lousy lay.<eos> - Are you done?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here forever.<eos> Really?<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> - I'll go back to Des Moines.<eos> - Des Moines, that's rich.<eos> You think Bobby's gonna take you back after what you pulled?
Really?<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> - I'll go back to Des Moines.<eos> - Des Moines, that's rich.<eos> You think Bobby's gonna take you back after what you pulled?<eos> His fire insurance premiums have doubled thanks to you.<eos> I'll go back to Carbondale.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Say hi to my picture on the wall.<eos> Fuck you, Topper.
Four, three, two, one, Happy New Year!<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> Please, say something.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I don't like how you're using this song to manipulate my feelings.<eos> I didn't ask them to play it.<eos> Honest, it's tradition.<eos> It's shady.<eos> I've been begging you for ten minutes.<eos> And I haven't asked you to take off those ridiculous glasses.

I miss you.
And you got me invested in her hair and now I don't know what's going on.<eos> It's not good.<eos> I miss your stupid laugh.<eos> My stupid laugh?<eos> What about your stupid laugh?<eos> You have the stupidest laugh of all.<eos> You're like:<eos> Yeah, well yours is:<eos> I am sorry I was so selfish.<eos> Annie, I love you.

Of course it's going to work.<eos> We have the confidence of much older women.<eos> What impression... do you leave... on the world?<eos> I need to touch it.<eos> Sophia!<eos> - Gosh!<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> I'm so happy you are here to witness this.<eos> I mean, at first when I saw you, I thought I must be hallucinating.
Oh, my...<eos> I'm so happy you are here to witness this.<eos> I mean, at first when I saw you, I thought I must be hallucinating.<eos> Because how much truth and beauty can one room fit?<eos> That and the pot cookie I had earlier.<eos> It's the only way to watch art.<eos> - Nathan, Sophia's here!<eos> - Sophia.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh, it's so good to see you.
If you want, I could take two minutes out of my day to register a new web address.<eos> Or we could use that time to continue watching this skillful lovemaking.<eos> I've given that address to thousands of people. and get an eyeful of shaved sniz.<eos> Sophia, we can fix this.<eos> We'll say there was some confusion. It's no big deal.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - No.<eos> No. Fine is not perfect.<eos> Well, if you're looking for perfect...<eos> That is not what I asked you to do.
Cute jumpsuit.<eos> Yeah, if you're a lady astronaut.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> All jumpsuits are... out.<eos> And I fucking saw something that looked like this at that horrible place, too. Whoa.<eos> Hey, Soph.<eos> Sophia.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Calm down. You're coming unglued.<eos> Want me to restrain you?
You pushed through the pins and made an impression on the world that wasn't there before.<eos> If you quit now, you're just a girl with a bunch of old clothes.<eos> That jumpsuit is good.<eos> It'll sell.<eos> Kaavi's website is perfect.<eos> You believe me when I say it's gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> Now...<eos> I know you're new to this boss shit, but you can't just walk in here acting like a crazy person.
Hey.<eos> Anyone catch the sunrise this morning?<eos> Ah. It just keeps getting later and later every day.<eos> - I got you a coffee, K-dog.
And you, with the guitar.<eos> I'll always remember you as the girl on her knees.<eos> And you're gonna have to tell your kids that.<eos> Or maybe you won't. Kids are perceptive. They know when Mommy's a slut.<eos> Oh, boy. You're bringing the kids in.<eos> You're right. That was too far.<eos> This is on Shane.<eos> But still, woman to woman... so not cool.<eos> Sophia, please.<eos> Two years of my life wasted on you.
Toast over, I'm done.<eos> Well, don't let that moment linger, child.<eos> Turn the music back up.<eos> Just...<eos> - Do you want a drink or something?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> So, how did the launch go?<eos> I don't wanna talk about that.<eos> So, um...<eos> I needed to see you... because, uh...
You're so beautiful.<eos> Stop it.<eos> God, I fucked up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> She means nothing to me.<eos> Yes, but it matters to me, okay?<eos> I can't move on until you tell me every detail.<eos> Did she kiss you first?
Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> All right.<eos> [woman] Kick drum, please.<eos> Floor tom.<eos> All right, cymbals.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> I'm sorry. - Yeah.<eos> I'm good. I'm good.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without your computer.
Check, one, two. Check, one, two.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> This is my girlfriend Sophia.<eos> Sophia, that is Billy, Mickey, and Dr. Josh.<eos> What's up?<eos> Sophia, huh?<eos> Shane won't shut up about you.<eos> Hey, Shane.<eos> I'm feeling a bit nasally, so, get my Claritin-D before the show.<eos> Since we've been on tour, have I let you down?
The tour would take most of the day, but you're gonna love it.<eos> So, you're telling me that the entire time I'm in Tinseltown, not only am I not helping Britney, but there's a chance I won't even get to meet Katie Holmes and learn the secrets of her side smile?<eos> You really think you're gonna meet Katie and Britney wandering the streets?<eos> No.<eos> But we should be open to the possibility.<eos> Or, yeah, whatever.<eos> Eames House is cool, too.<eos> Penny Lane.<eos> You have gotta stop bumping into me.<eos> I'm so happy to meet you.
Annie, taking mysterious shit from strangers is crazy.<eos> It's not mysterious shit.<eos> It's drugs.<eos> - Annie.<eos> - Fine.<eos> No drugs for me.<eos> ♪ It's her routine that is Keeping it sane ♪ Why the face?<eos> You need a conference?<eos> I thought my first trip with Dax was gonna be amazing, but we're totally not vibing.<eos> Hmm. You want me to break up with him for you?
- Turn the TV off.<eos> - Where the steaks are world-class...<eos> - The sounds are bright, and the colors are loud.<eos> Do you hear all those dogs?<eos> This isn't like high school at all.<eos> Wanna take a shower?<eos> [groans] I'm kind of just waking up.<eos> Come on, it'll be fun.<eos> Never, ever... pull a soft hotel comforter off a woman.<eos> Hop on my back, I'll take you.
I'm a bitch.<eos> I'm the devil. Mm...<eos> You're so perfect.<eos> Sophia, she's a monster.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I am so sick of people telling me I'm not a grown-up.<eos> I run a fucking business.<eos> What is it that you do?<eos> This is insane.<eos> You get that I dropped everything, just to come see you this weekend. Right?

And my parents...<eos> It's gonna be this whole thing.<eos> And you don't wanna deal with it, 'cause you're not sure about me.<eos> You're the only thing that I'm sure of.<eos> I just don't wanna deal with it because they're crazy.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I mean, most black parents are cool with stuff like that, but not my parents.<eos> I'll charm 'em.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I love you, Annie.

Previously on "Suits"...<eos> It's a no.<eos> I thought you liked the idea.<eos> That was before I realized that it was nothing but sassy remarks.<eos> I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> If you're gonna get this worked up, it makes me think I don't really know you.
Rachel Zane deserves to be in the Bar.<eos> You're not only gonna stop blocking her, you're gonna run interference for her if someone else does.<eos> And in return, you'll do what I want.<eos> No, but I'll do what you want for something else.<eos> We need to come up with a lawsuit against Velocity Data Solutions.<eos> No.<eos> - What do you mean, "no"?<eos> - Fabricating a lawsuit to manipulate a stock is illegal.<eos> It's not illegal if we find a legitimate suit.<eos> Let's finish the job and get you back to being a lawyer.
- You remember that thing that we took care of for Rachel that you said might be worth doing?<eos> Well, it turns out it was worth doing.<eos> Only I'm doing it for Mike.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Seidel agreed to go to bat for him?<eos> Yes, and once it's done and Mike's in the Bar, he can come back here and work again.<eos> Harvey, that is great and nobody wants that more than I do, but it's just one meeting.<eos> Louis, I know that, but in about three hours, I'm gonna be under water for the next three days.<eos> Harvey--<eos> Louis, I know I told you I'd be there for you, but I need you to be there for me.
Well the answer is: you can't.<eos> No one can.<eos> Then why are we here?<eos> Because we used to dazzle Carly with rank.<eos> This year, we're gonna dazzle her with substance.<eos> By knowing her business better than anyone else.<eos> I'll take care of the business.<eos> What you two are gonna do is personally tailor the presentation to her.<eos> And as of now, we have less than 24 hours to do that.<eos> - We won't let you down, Louis.
I'm gonna go tell Harvey that we're in the home stretch.<eos> - How's it going, genius?<eos> - What?<eos> I said, how's it going?<eos> I'll tell you how it's going.<eos> It's not going to work.<eos> What?<eos> But I thought that you said-- I don't care what you thought.<eos> This isn't "Westworld." I can't make her human.<eos> Benjamin, I'm not asking you to make her human.

You're only human.<eos> If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> Besides, if I can't show you compassion, how can I ever expect The Donna to show compassion?<eos> Thanks Donna.<eos> I'm sorry if I got your hopes up.<eos> Figure out what we're going to say tomorrow?<eos> You get those complaints ready?<eos> - I asked you first.
How high did he go?<eos> A hundred million.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing, it's just I would've gotten him up to two.<eos> And how exactly would you have done that when you told me not to counter?<eos> I'm more intimidating.<eos> I walk into a room, people cave.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I think it's a gift when you leave the room.<eos> My gift to you was saving your ass when you screwed the pooch by involving me in this case.
Well, I've got news for you, Mr. Specter, the reason he hasn't come forward has nothing to do with his marriage.<eos> So, why don't you go find out what's what.<eos> And I got a feeling when you do, you'll drop this case by the morning.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You ran out of the presentation so quickly, I didn't get to ask what you thought.<eos> I had to get to class, but I thought it went great.<eos> What about Louis?<eos> He was over the Moon.<eos> I'm sure he's glad to have you back.
who may also be the best litigator I've ever seen.<eos> Maybe you didn't understand my question.<eos> I was asking what it was like to work with Zane, not Kaldor.<eos> Rachel, I'm serious.<eos> I learned a lot about your father while I was there and I'm telling you, it was all good.<eos> What about his temper?<eos> Well, maybe it wasn't all good.<eos> Well, good night.<eos> One more thing I learned about him.<eos> He doesn't just love you, he respects you.
You mind if I ask what it's about?<eos> I just got off the phone with Carly Donahue.<eos> Louis, what happened?<eos> Rachel said that it went great.<eos> I thought it did, too, but then she called me and said that the next time she asks for a meeting with me and Harvey, she better get a goddamn meeting with me and Harvey instead of two nobodies.<eos> - What did you tell her?<eos> - I told her how dare she talk about my superstars like that.<eos> She's lucky to have them.<eos> Louis, that's great.<eos> Good for you.
It's okay, Donna.<eos> It's not your fault, either.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'm Donna, I should have known.<eos> Maybe, but you always say part of being human is messing up sometimes and you may be Donna, but you're still human.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> You are ready.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> I want to know if I was wrong about you.
I wasn't lying to him when I said these people's lives matter to me and I wasn't lying to either one of you when I said I care about what kind of lawyer you're gonna be.<eos> Well, if you care what kind of lawyer I'm going to be, set the right example because you owe it to Nathan to tell him the truth.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's every yearbook I've ever had.<eos> It was so nice doing it with yours the other night I thought maybe tonight we could do it with mine.<eos> Louis, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong. I, uh--had a bad day and I wanted to talk to you about it.<eos> But you went to all this trouble and I don't want to bring you down.
They'll be back soon.<eos> Yeah, run along granny goody two shoes.<eos> I just don't want to get in trouble.<eos> Hey, idiot!<eos> You're in hell!<eos> You're already in trouble!<eos> Holeee shit!<eos> My frickin' jeeezus, check out new guy!<eos> My god, dude!<eos> Alright, dude, I gotta ask you a question and you gotta be honest:
Yeah.<eos> Well, now the fun is over.<eos> What if it isn't over, mein fuhrer?<eos> What if the fun's just beginning? What are we gonna do about that then?<eos> Go! Back to your hells!<eos> Quick!<eos> Once the machine starts, the doors lock.<eos> You can come in my hell if you want.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But they will put you in the hole.
Go back to your cell now...<eos> While you still can.<eos> What is your name by the way?<eos> Welcome to hell, Eugene.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> No more crying? Okay?<eos> 'Cause crying isn't gonna fix this.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> I trusted you, made you a part of my family.
'Cause crying isn't gonna fix this.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> I trusted you, made you a part of my family.<eos> And in return you made a fool out of me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, you better think of something 'cause "sorry" isn't gonna fix this either.<eos> Excuse me, boss.<eos> He's conscious again.<eos> Not sure how long we'll have him.<eos> Walk around, clear your head, and when I ask you again, give me a better answer.
You've forgotten us, haven't you?<eos> You moved on. Your life continued.<eos> But others weren't so lucky.<eos> The waters went down, but the pain rose, the grief continued...<eos> I lost my house, my clothes, everything.<eos> Asked the federal government for help... but you know how that goes.<eos> What is this?<eos> Infomercial.<eos> No tulip?<eos> What, she... She hasn't called you?
Yeah. It's just... That's just French.<eos> Right.<eos> Gonna grab something to eat and then we'll go.<eos> Whwhat?<eos> Wait... where we going?<eos> Jazz clubs.<eos> We still got 137 more to see.<eos> Yeah, but what... What about tulip?<eos> What about her?<eos> Are you... are you not wondering where she is?
Jazz clubs.<eos> We still got 137 more to see.<eos> Yeah, but what... What about tulip?<eos> What about her?<eos> Are you... are you not wondering where she is?<eos> I know exactly where she is.<eos> You do?<eos> We're in a fight.<eos> So she's out somewhere being mad at me.<eos> Being mad at you?
A "mark hairlik"? "Harelic"?<eos> From the Katrina commercials?<eos> Harelik.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> Nope.<eos> Alright. Coming.<eos> Hey guys!<eos> How you been?<eos> Hey, Jimmy, you still playing with this guy?<eos> He will rob you blind...
Do you understand?<eos> This is hell:<eos> Act accordingly.<eos> We will be watching.<eos> Hey Allie.<eos> How you doing?<eos> You got so big?<eos> Those bracelets are pretty.<eos> You make them?<eos> I hope my father kills you.
You know, this feels like one of those boyfriend/girlfriend...<eos> Then go, Reggie.<eos> Stay.<eos> We were having fun, Jesse.<eos> Remember?<eos> Till Carlos, we had fun.<eos> Before that little thing, we were having a hell of a time.<eos> That hurt me as much as you.<eos> It hurt you, Tulip?<eos> Were you hurt by it?
I don't know how to do it.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?<eos> Is that what you're trying to do here?<eos> Be a Custer again?<eos> Like having a crap job and a crap life gives you the forgiveness you need<eos> for what you done?<eos> Make you one of the good guys?

Sheets are silky bastards?<eos> I think a couple hundred foreskins have gone into making those, easily.<eos> Do you know, I was rich once.<eos> Bloody years ago.<eos> I really quite enjoyed it, actually.<eos> You know what happened here, right?<eos> You two had a falling out, and she was down.<eos> She fell in with the first twopoolowning bloke she met.<eos> And that was it.<eos> But she doesn't love him and she never did because she loves you, you stupid idiot.

You didn't?<eos> Well, that's what I've been saying.<eos> I mean, I wanted to.<eos> Settled for divorce papers instead.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I'll go and let her know her dad's still alive.<eos> She'll be thrilled.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm so bad for you.
"welcome back" waffles.<eos> Was that your boyfriend?<eos> He seems sweet.<eos> And terribly vulnerable, as humans tend to be. Okay.<eos> Look, just... tell me what you want and let's get this over with.<eos> You just had to piss him off again, didn't you?<eos> Camille?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'm a figment of your imagination, remember?<eos> Your brain's way of distracting yourself from all the pain, same as the last time Marcel stabbed you with that blade.
Sure, but paired with the solitude?<eos> Your great existential fear of being utterly alone, down here in the dark.<eos> Don't speak of it!<eos> Irritability is another form of sublimation.<eos> You're not annoyed with me.<eos> You blame yourself for getting into this mess.<eos> It's okay to admit.<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> Plus, you know, I'm dead.<eos> I miss you, Camille.
You believed there was a light in me.<eos> That I could be a light for my daughter.<eos> But outside these walls are legions of vampires who wish me dead, and the man I called my son has left me here to rot.<eos> I'm not a light.<eos> I am darkness... made of flesh.<eos> You are the reason your family is alive.<eos> You bought them the time they needed...<eos> Come on, you can feel it.<eos> The link you shared with them is broken, so now they're awake.<eos> And you know they're not just gonna leave you here.
Wouldn't you agree...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, I was just gonna order a pizza.<eos> You know, if we're gonna be here for a while.<eos> Fabulous. Yes, I still do have... a murderous hunger.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why do you guys even need me?<eos> Huh? I mean, I know I'm adorable, but I'm extremely small potatoes.<eos> Well, you are Marcel's trusted friend.<eos> We had planned on learning everything you know and then using you as collateral.
I want you to consider the risk.<eos> I have.<eos> I won't allow my family to face that risk.<eos> - Freya found Nik?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You get our brother, I will handle Marcel.<eos> Rebekah.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd show.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd still be you.<eos> I kept wondering if that hex had eaten you alive.
It would have.<eos> But I was...<eos> Linked... to Klaus.<eos> I know.<eos> I've known about that for a while.<eos> You had endless opportunities to kill him.<eos> Did you hold off on my account?<eos> Then, please, Marcel.<eos> If some part of you still cares about me, help me.<eos> For the sake of all we've been to one another, for all that we've shared, I am begging you to let my brother go.
What about your daughter's?<eos> Hope?<eos> She's out there right now.<eos> A fact that weighs upon me every second I'm in this hole.<eos> But... I can't.<eos> Can't or won't?<eos> For five years, you had to stay put.<eos> In order to keep your family alive, you had to keep yourself alive.<eos> No matter what the pain or fear or solitude.<eos> But now you can leave, and you choose to stay even though your daughter's waiting for you.

You don't want her to fall into that cycle of violence.<eos> And your fear is eating away at your strength.<eos> And that's why you can't free yourself.<eos> Okay, I have had enough of this nonsense!<eos> Klaus, admit it.<eos> Down here, you can't hurt her.<eos> You're just a myth.<eos> This great man who sacrificed himself to save his family, but in reality you...<eos> In reality, I would not be subjected to the ridiculous claims of a woman who died in my arms!<eos> I conjured you, so I can send you away.
Davina... Davina, the girl who was like a daughter to me, was lost forever, and the only thing that you could say was "they did what they needed to do"?<eos> That's all we knew how to do!<eos> Right or wrong, that's all my family has done for 1,000 years.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Is that really your defense?<eos> I have no defense.<eos> I know exactly what I am.<eos> As I know that none of us are innocent in this.<eos> Least of all you and me.<eos> I was a damn fool to ever love you.
I have no defense.<eos> I know exactly what I am.<eos> As I know that none of us are innocent in this.<eos> Least of all you and me.<eos> I was a damn fool to ever love you.<eos> And I could say the same.<eos> Then we are done here.<eos> We most certainly are not.<eos> You gonna use that on me?<eos> Infect me with the same hex that damn near destroyed you?
Fine.<eos> I will admit the truth.<eos> I do not wish to be the father I had, nor do I wish to be the father Marcel has come to loathe.<eos> Perhaps I am better as a myth. And Hope is better off without me.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> Or do you want more?<eos> Are you satisfied?<eos> Every parent is afraid of screwing up.<eos> Well, at least the good ones are.<eos> But Hope needs you.
Now more than ever.<eos> Hayley will protect her.<eos> And she'll do one hell of a job.<eos> But don't you think Hope deserves her father?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Yes, history could repeat itself.<eos> If you're not careful, it will.<eos> But you owe it to your daughter to try and change the narrative.<eos> For her and for you.
This guy, Aiden.<eos> He died.<eos> Killed by your aunt, actually.<eos> And afterwards, I hated everything.<eos> And I mean everything.<eos> Even the... sun.<eos> You know?<eos> It just kept coming up every morning, like it was any other day and the world hadn't completely changed.<eos> It's taken forever for me to feel normal again.<eos> How fortunate for you that you do.
Look, I'm really not a part of all this...<eos> Of course you are, especially when you're receiving coded messages from the man that's holding my brother captive.<eos> Now... listen very carefully.<eos> If something has happened to my sister, or if something is about to happen to another member of my family, this city and everyone in it will burn:<eos> you, your boyfriend, your friends, this bar, your home... Shall I continue?<eos> Now, tell me what "Teutoburg" means.<eos> It's a battle... where the bad guys caught the good guys off guard.<eos> Marcel is warning me that you're all here so that I can spread word to the rest of our guys...<eos> So you can keep us busy and Marcel can kill us.<eos> You're lucky Davina liked you.
Welcome back, sister.<eos> Kol!<eos> I think you got him.<eos> Can we leave this awful city now?<eos> Where's Elijah?<eos> You find some way to survive my bite and you have the audacity to come back?<eos> What happened?<eos> Immortality just got boring?<eos> I've come for my brother.<eos> Well, I got something else for you.
Your daughter's better off without him.<eos> Get Niklaus and go.<eos> Oh, he's not going anywhere, Elijah.<eos> Apne en vrata.<eos> Klaus! Wake up!<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey. You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Oh, I can't hold it much longer.<eos> Apne en vrata. Your family needs you.
Get Niklaus and go.<eos> Oh, he's not going anywhere, Elijah.<eos> Apne en vrata.<eos> Klaus! Wake up!<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey. You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Oh, I can't hold it much longer.<eos> Apne en vrata. Your family needs you.<eos> Hope needs you.
Klaus! Wake up!<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey. You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Oh, I can't hold it much longer.<eos> Apne en vrata. Your family needs you.<eos> Hope needs you.<eos> Stop!<eos> You win.<eos> Okay? We can't beat you.

What is it?<eos> A witch, a spirit?<eos> Vincent, this is my son.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna find Adam, I'm gonna bring him back to you.<eos> But whoever has him right now is using some very dark magic.<eos> Some very powerful magic, and you have to stay away from it.<eos> Promise me that.<eos> No, listen to me, okay, please.<eos> I know that this is tough for you, but you're gonna have to trust me.
New Orleans was our city once.<eos> Now it's yours.<eos> For good.<eos> Is the great Klaus Mikaelson accepting defeat?<eos> Or is this all just another distraction?<eos> Neither.<eos> In fact, despite your appalling behavior, I'm offering you a chance at peace.<eos> Attempt to kill us all, and you will be making a mistake.<eos> Any who survived would no doubt return to seek revenge, bringing our enemies back to your city in our wake.<eos> And even if you did manage to eliminate us all, one day my daughter would come for you.
You've destroyed more people, taken more lives, ended more families than anyone who's ever lived.<eos> All because you can.<eos> But here's the other truth.<eos> Despite being raised by you people... I am nothing like any of you.<eos> In fact, I'm proud as hell I'm not a Mikaelson.<eos> I beat you all without turning into you.<eos> And now you can live the rest of your lives knowing that the only reason that you exist is because I am showing you mercy.<eos> Now go.<eos> And don't ever come back.<eos> Remind me, if I'm ever gonna piss you off, make sure there isn't a crossbow lying around.
Name's Anton.<eos> He's really big in the paranormal world.<eos> This is the only picture I could find of him.<eos> I was looking at a new carving knife for Thanksgiving.<eos> 240 bucks.<eos> Big investment.<eos> Still thinking about it.<eos> Here he is.<eos> No last name, no phone number, just an expired e-mail address.<eos> But I am gonna find you, Anton.
Big investment.<eos> Still thinking about it.<eos> Here he is.<eos> No last name, no phone number, just an expired e-mail address.<eos> But I am gonna find you, Anton.<eos> And then I'm gonna read your book, you blurry son of a bitch!<eos> We have that open house today.<eos> Maybe you should take the day off, let me cover it.<eos> What? Huh?<eos> Well, it's just that everything's been so intense lately and I'm worried about you.

She claims she started a new spin class but really, she's having an affair with a guy named Bob.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She accidentally linked her cell phone to my computer so I can see all of her texts.<eos> Today, Bob copied and pasted all of the lyrics to Stevie Wonder's "Part Time Lover."<eos> - Which seems lazy and on the nose.<eos> - You should say something to her.<eos> It would only embarrass her.<eos> She's just trying to protect me from knowing she's in a crappy marriage.<eos> Maybe your mom's trying to protect you from knowing that she's a vicious killing machine.
See you, guys.<eos> So you two were alone in your room with the door closed.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> - Of course nothing happened.<eos> You're you.<eos> Will you leave him alone, Dan?<eos> He's just waiting for his moment.<eos> Honey, there's a casserole in the fridge.<eos> I'm going to spin class again tonight.<eos> Good for you, Mom.
♪ Too much time on my hands ♪<eos> ♪ Too much time on my hands ♪<eos> ♪ Too much time on my hands ♪<eos> ♪ Too much time on my... ♪<eos> - Whoa. - Yeah.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I'm on baby duty.<eos> But you can blow it in my face.<eos> Fuck it, just give it to me.<eos> So I got a cop question for you.
What the hell? You can't just walk in my house.<eos> I knocked, no one answered.<eos> Probably couldn't hear me over all this weed.<eos> Marijuana is nice, yes? I smoky with my black lover, have a sexy time!<eos> What reaction are you hoping for right now?<eos> I thought toking the indo made everything funnier.<eos> Baby's awake.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> Oh, come on, man, don't leave me alone with...<eos> - out you.
Ah, Joel...<eos> I know the finger belongs to Gary West.<eos> I know that you and Sheila worked with Gary.<eos> And I know that Lisa saw Gary dancing with your wife at the club, grinding her pelvis into a fine mist.<eos> And then Gary disappeared.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is such a drag.<eos> There is one thing I don't know.<eos> How could a pussy like you kill someone?<eos> I mean, I once saw you running after an ice cream truck.
You have been doing so well with your research and your bookstores.<eos> And I've been doing well sneaking up on people and killing them.<eos> We both have our strengths. What a team.<eos> Dan called me a pussy today.<eos> This feels... of a piece.<eos> That wasn't what I was saying.<eos> I was just saying I know you don't wanna go with me when I go to... shop for dinner, so I'll go by myself.<eos> No. It's okay.<eos> I don't like this shopping excursion you're proposing, but I can certainly handle it, so I will help you.<eos> Because what kind of man would I be if I sent you to the grocery store alone?

Because what kind of man would I be if I sent you to the grocery store alone?<eos> Well, I love you being my shopping partner, so thank you.<eos> Wow. Your wedding vows must have been awesome.<eos> I can't do it anymore.<eos> I can't just not say anything to my parents when I know they're lying right to my face.<eos> Hello.<eos> I just want to say, "Stop lying!<eos> I know that 'beef' you're shopping for probably once wore underwear."<eos> Am I just supposed to pretend forever I don't know they're killing people?<eos> On one hand, they love you and are trying to protect you, and on the other hand...
- No, it's fine.<eos> I was just trying to prove my point.<eos> Because you're not into me.<eos> But you just lied to protect me so I wouldn't get hurt, like your parents are doing to you.<eos> And I'm not hurt, because this was all a rhetorical exercise to make a point.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I see what you're saying about, um...<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hey, sorry if I embarrassed you by, like, thinking you actually wanted to kiss me.
- What are we gonna tell Dan?<eos> - I don't know. We have a couple of days till he gets back from his hunting/alibi trip.<eos> It's all going to be fine.<eos> I'm almost sure I didn't bite him.<eos> - We're gonna be fine.<eos> - Totally.<eos> Mostly.<eos> Honey, is my briefcase in the kitchen?<eos> Yeah, it's right... here.<eos> I hope we didn't wake you last night when we got home.
No.<eos> Put the knife to your own throat.<eos> No...<eos> Clarke, don't.<eos> No.<eos> You are a terrible influence.<eos> Roan is expecting me.<eos> Abby...<eos> Jake's a part of who you are.<eos> The king needs you... but be careful.
Fine. I'm in.<eos> Bryan stays here.<eos> His leg's still healing. I'm in, too.<eos> Good.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.<eos> Since Octavia murdered Pike,<eos> I'm the only one left who knows where it is.<eos> Why are you defending him?<eos> Pike was a dictator. He was an elected chancellor, and if you don't care about that, he kept me alive for 3 months.

You know we're all gonna die in 6 months, right?<eos> Not if we find what we're looking for today.<eos> Please. Tell me about another pointless task Clarke has roped you into or, better yet, don't.
Polyethylene silicone elastomers.<eos> We don't need that for a winter storm or to protect us from a Grounder attack.<eos> What are we really bracing Alpha Station for?<eos> Heavy lies the crown.<eos> I know the burden of keeping a secret you think is going to destroy your people.<eos> You locked me up.<eos> You floated my father.<eos> And now you understand why.<eos> No leader starts out wanting to lie or imprison or execute their people.<eos> The decisions you face just whittle you down piece by piece.
It's too soon.<eos> One simple task, and I'm failing.<eos> No.<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> There's nothing more that I can do for Roan.<eos> You need to go back to Arkadia, to Clarke.<eos> Your necklace.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> I'm here to ask you one last time to back down.
Oh, he should pay rent, he's here so much.<eos> God, you smell disgusting.<eos> I made a list.<eos> Sooner rather than later, Edie, huh?<eos> Keith?<eos> Wake up, Keith.<eos> He's still out.<eos> What time did you get home?<eos> Maybe midnight.<eos> I didn't want to wake you.
Let's be open to that idea.<eos> We do know he photographed Katie Pine.<eos> We can hear it on the audiotape.<eos> So, does he share them?<eos> Does he post them?<eos> CES is scouring the internet but, if you hear of any snuff photos, bondage, underage stuff, run it down.<eos> Cell phone trace?<eos> Sarge?<eos> A couple of days after Curry arrived here he travelled due south about eighty Kilometres and spent several hours just outside of Dorset.<eos> McLeod, I want you down there to have a look around.
So you just stand there like a dumb animal?<eos> I thought we were waiting.<eos> Go to work.<eos> Eric.<eos> It's not enough, you know, to get a little thrill out of this?<eos> A little tingle in your loins.<eos> 'Cause guess what?<eos> Anybody does.<eos> You put this in front of anybody and they'll watch.<eos> So don't think that makes you special.
I'm so sorry about last night.<eos> That's on me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I get a little... chippy when I drink.<eos> No hard feelings?<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're at Edie's house.<eos> You remember Edie, with the face?<eos> You must have had a few too many because you got pretty sick.<eos> They were gonna bounce you to the curb, so we brought you here.
Take your time.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall.<eos> It's old school.<eos> Is it, uh,<eos> Claire you wanted to speak to?<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> Did I tell you about her?<eos> You told me a lot of things.<eos> Looks like we're gonna lose you again.
Girlfriend?<eos> Did I tell you about her?<eos> You told me a lot of things.<eos> Looks like we're gonna lose you again.<eos> Wait, before you go, I do want to show you something.<eos> Hey.<eos> A little preparation in this area saves everyone a lot of trouble.<eos> I learnt that the hard way.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> It's for you, Keith.
I'm sorry.<eos> My ride fell through.<eos> Happens way too much.<eos> Last time.<eos> Promise.<eos> Thanks a lot for punching me in.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I asked last week.<eos> Consider it a standing request, Edie.<eos> I'll do the same for you.
Keith.<eos> It's a long exposure, if you move it's gonna be blurry.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Not that I want you to be still, I just want you to do what's natural.<eos> Okay. Look.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> I didn't say.<eos> Okay. Okay, I don't know if you got the wrong impression, but this is not my sort of thing.<eos> Oh no?<eos> I don't know if I did something to piss you off.
Okay. Look.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> I didn't say.<eos> Okay. Okay, I don't know if you got the wrong impression, but this is not my sort of thing.<eos> Oh no?<eos> I don't know if I did something to piss you off.<eos> Like what?<eos> I don't know if I said something.<eos> If we got into it.<eos> Does this feel like a spat to you?
How are ya this afternoon?<eos> What's this about? Well, we're just out canvassing the area, making sure everybody's feeling safe with everything going on in the news these days.<eos> Down here!<eos> Down here!<eos> Your husband uh...<eos> My husband?<eos> What?<eos> Is your husband here?<eos> My husband is dead.<eos> I will slice you wide open.
People living in the moment, being raw, not performing.<eos> I capture that.<eos> So is this the part when you ask to take pictures of me?<eos> Would you like that?<eos> You work at the music store, right?<eos> You should come by sometime and bring your pictures.<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You wouldn't like them.<eos> I wasn't freezing you out today, Delorme.
- I don't know.<eos> But they were here.<eos> That means they're watching.<eos> They'll be back.<eos> Look, you can let me go, okay?<eos> We can put all of this behind us.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> No.<eos> But sometimes people get into things and they don't know how to get out.<eos> Is he making you do this?
I have to talk to you.<eos> We shouldn't be seen together.<eos> Are you embarrassed by me?<eos> No.<eos> Edie.<eos> No.<eos> We just have to be cautious, okay?<eos> Now, come on, let's go.<eos> I made him bleed.<eos> For you.
- It's nice to meet you, Jemma. - What's your name?<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Thank you, doctor.<eos> I think we're finished here. May:<eos> If you won't read it, I will. Radcliffe:<eos> It's too much for a human mind to bear.<eos> Perhaps I could read the book.<eos> Everybody is trying to do their best to prevent another tragedy like Lincoln.<eos> But we built Aida to protect Agents like him.<eos> I can't figure you out.
Better safe than sorry, as they say.<eos> So happy you agree, 'cause it's also an order.<eos> Now get to work.<eos> *AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D.* Season 04 Episode 09 "Broken promises" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> Ellen.<eos> Glad you finally woke up.<eos> Looked like you were having bad dreams.<eos> It was about mom's birthday, when the chitauri attacked.<eos> Worst day of my life.<eos> Though finding you in that cocoon seven months ago was a close second.
He even recently signed up for a master class in directing.<eos> But there have been no new photos of Vijay in the last seven months.<eos> So either he's suddenly gotten camera-shy or...<eos> Or someone's hiding him.<eos> Not someone...<eos> the senator, considering she's the country's leading anti-inhuman hatemonger.<eos> I'd have a much better idea where she was hiding him if the director hadn't insisted I wear a hood before going on assignment.<eos> Just awful.<eos> It's hard to breathe in those things, huh?<eos> It is nice having someone here to talk to again... you, specifically.
No wonder she used all those cloak-and-dagger methods.<eos> You got a lead on his whereabouts?<eos> No sign of him, but she's been out of the office all week.<eos> Okay.<eos> Agent Rodriguez is still recovering, so that leaves you, me, and Agent Simmons.<eos> Wheels up in 10.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What? Where are we going?<eos> To rescue him.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
You still make my favorite breakfast.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's because you don't eat breakfast if I'm not there to cook it.<eos> I thought you were gonna sell this place.<eos> I had a couple of offers, but I decided to take it off the market.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> This is one of the last houses dad designed before he died.<eos> Seems like it should stay in the family.<eos> You're probably right.<eos> Plus, it's the perfect place for you to recover after your ordeal.
- No, it wasn't.<eos> Do you see any scarring, any special abilities?<eos> That's because it didn't change me.<eos> I'm the same person I've always been.<eos> I beat it, just like you said I could.<eos> Senator.<eos> I'm your brother...<eos> The same one who followed you around when we were kids.<eos> I've always looked up to you.<eos> I've always loved you.
Yes, I am.<eos> But I'm gonna need your help.<eos> Coulson: May...<eos> Where's Aida?<eos> Out there, looking for the Darkhold, presumably.<eos> I was about to fight her, and then...<eos> Woke up in here.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Seems Aida nailed you pretty good.
It's over, Aida.<eos> I did not kill anyone here.<eos> - That was intentional.<eos> - You murdered Nathanson.<eos> Nathanson insisted he reboot me before repairing my wounds.<eos> I regret what happened.<eos> Regret's not part of your programming.<eos> The Darkhold fixed that.<eos> It showed me regret and desire... so many astonishing things.<eos> It made you dangerous.
- Did you know he could...<eos> - I did not.<eos> Ellen: Vijay.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Simmons: Vijay...<eos> You need to come with us.<eos> Jemma.<eos> She's seen what you are.<eos> That's why they're here.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to make you their weapon.
She was supposed to be in a relaxing simulation.<eos> She was in a day spa, getting a hot-stone massage.<eos> How hot did you make the stones?<eos> I did exactly as you asked.<eos> Well, at least you didn't snap her neck, so that's an improvement.<eos> Fetch some restraints.<eos> We may have misjudged what it takes to keep agent may comfortable.<eos> So you're allowed to touch Lola?<eos> Wanted to let you know we're a few minutes out from the crash site.<eos> Did he ever let you drive her?
The flaw isn't in the hardware. It was in may herself.<eos> The simulation was rejected because agent may thrives in conflict and chaos, not tranquility.<eos> She's a warrior.<eos> You're saying fighting against me stabilized her?<eos> Precisely.<eos> If we want her to accept the simulation, we need to give her an opponent to fight, an enemy to vanquish, a dragon to slay.<eos> Shall I design a dragon?<eos> No.<eos> I have something else in mind.<eos> Don't worry. I'm gonna figure out what broke you.
I'm calling the shots.<eos> We were so close.<eos> Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.<eos> And all the answers it holds.<eos> Though poor Fitz...<eos> We could just reboot the head...<eos> In a controlled environment...<eos> And then we could diagnose the problem together. Please!<eos> Drop it.<eos> I'm gonna figure out what broke you.
I'm gonna figure out what broke you.<eos> Thank you, Fitz.<eos> Will there be another opportunity to acquire the Darkhold?<eos> Agent May's decoy will be more convincing.<eos> Her programming operates on a subconscious level.<eos> If agent May isn't aware of her mission to retrieve the Darkhold, then she won't be able to reveal herself.<eos> She'll instinctively climb the ranks, gain access, and get closer to agent Coulson, the man who knows just where this book is.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't think you'd get stuck on a milk run to Radcliffe's.<eos> We're gonna miss you in the field. I'll catch up.
Not again.<eos> I'm happy Turtleman came out to play this morning.<eos> You're Turtleman.<eos> It's not a nickname for your...<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> I get it. We could find a nickname for it...<eos> No, I'm good....<eos> But... okay.<eos> Me too.<eos> I enjoy you.
I was just covering the communications here, anyway.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I got to do something... else.<eos> Is that the text you just got?<eos> Yeah. It's just a change of plans.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> Look.<eos> I'm sorry. I know it's bad timing, but you guys are gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna catch up with you when you get back.
Okay.<eos> Fitz.<eos> You need something?<eos> Answers about Aida.<eos> Security report on the incident, need to close it out.<eos> Okay. What do you need to know?<eos> How much was Aida aware of what she was going to do before she did it?<eos> Could she have stopped it?<eos> This isn't about a security report, is it?<eos> It's about you.
Okay. What do you need to know?<eos> How much was Aida aware of what she was going to do before she did it?<eos> Could she have stopped it?<eos> This isn't about a security report, is it?<eos> It's about you.<eos> About ordering Aida to read the Darkhold.<eos> Trust me, I was trying to get her to do the same thing, and I'm asking the same questions that you are.<eos> I think you did what you had to do in the moment.<eos> It was a hard choice.<eos> Not when it comes to saving you and Coulson.
Yeah, we've got it covered.<eos> Uh, we could always use a fresh pair of eyes if you'd like to join us.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> I've... Stuff to do here.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, one of the upsides of having a girlfriend is you get to talk about what's bothering you.<eos> Yeah, well, doesn't really sound like an upside for the girlfriend.<eos> I know you're upset about Aida.<eos> I'm in a strange position.<eos> I don't want to intrude on you while you're... Processing.
You got further this time than your previous attempts at this course.<eos> What is this?<eos> We call it the framework.<eos> Your journey to escape Dr. Radcliffe's lab, our fight, all of this...<eos> It's a simulation.<eos> I assure you, you're safe.<eos> We've moved you to another location.<eos> You put this in my head.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe knew the best way to keep you busy was to give you something to fight.<eos> Something like you.
Not again.<eos> We don't know what's going on, but someone gave us up.<eos> The senator had inside information.<eos> I know. Details.<eos> It's like Nadeer had eyes inside our...<eos> Our headquarters.<eos> Hey. J...<eos> You've been studying Aida even though you were ordered not to.<eos> Yeah, Jemma, okay...<eos> I tried to give you a wide berth because I knew you were worrying it through, but this is an obsession.
I don't know.<eos> Once I tell Coulson, it might be rough for you.<eos> You're not telling Coulson.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you have a mission.<eos> Call it an instinct.<eos> It'll kick in when it's time.<eos> Till then, you won't be able to jeopardize what you need to do.<eos> What mission?<eos> See, I sent you in unaware so that you would seem more real.
I-I've been wanting to talk to you about this, and... Tell you about hope.<eos> Hope.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> That's it, then.<eos> Elena...<eos> No, I've been giving this a lot of thought.<eos> And you know, we go out to dinner, and then you do nothing, and then we do something, and then you go away.<eos> Because I don't take this lightly.<eos> Look, mack, I like you.
That's Billy.<eos> That's him kicking ass, and that's you, hiding behind the bar.<eos> I think you got us ... I think you got us flipped, there.<eos> I mean, you're ... you're literally wearing the same thing right now.<eos> We have no idea what Billy did with the Darkhold.<eos> I didn't want to know.<eos> That was the whole point in giving it to him.<eos> Well, we need to get it back and destroy it.<eos> - If you'd given it to me ...<eos> - And they'd have you now.

'Cause it'll show them how to wipe out the Inhumans.<eos> You knew Billy had the Darkhold?<eos> Well, yeah, I couldn't say anything with all the Red Shirts hanging around.<eos> - Do you know what he did with it?<eos> - It is secure.<eos> I'd like to help you, but honestly, I have some trust issues. Trust?<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> Fitz, it's not Radcliffe.<eos> Yeah, I know it's not! But he thinks like he does.<eos> Betrayed me, betrayed S.H.I.E.L.D., he made me lie to you, and he made me think he was my friend.
- He said shut up.<eos> You can do it the easy way ...<eos> Why don't you just turn him off?<eos> He needs to be powered on to access his programming, not that it matters.<eos> We all have programming.<eos> It may be more obvious in my case, but what is a human if not a function of programming?<eos> You've been programmed ... by betrayal, abandonment...<eos> Ward, who you thought was your friend,<eos> - Daisy who left you all, your father...<eos> - Hey. He's just trying to distract you.
Please?<eos> I keep telling myself I don't care if Radcliffe knows my father, I'm over it, but... maybe I'm not.<eos> Maybe I'm stuck in a loop.<eos> Radcliffe...<eos> Ward...<eos> It keeps happening.<eos> I don't see it that way.<eos> Come on, Jemma.<eos> You know that it's true.<eos> Yes, they betrayed you. And after everything you've been through, no one would blame you if you put up your own firewall.
Ward...<eos> It keeps happening.<eos> I don't see it that way.<eos> Come on, Jemma.<eos> You know that it's true.<eos> Yes, they betrayed you. And after everything you've been through, no one would blame you if you put up your own firewall.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> Instead, you became the most... open, loyal, caring person I've ever met.<eos> Maybe that's why it keeps happening.<eos> It's why I fell in love with you.
Destroy it.<eos> Yeah, that's the plan.<eos> Now lower your damn weapon<eos> - and give me the Darkhold!<eos> 'Cause it's not in your programming.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - You're not May.<eos> - Why would you say that?<eos> Because there's some things you can't fake.<eos> He switched you, didn't he?

- I can assemble a team.<eos> - That won't be necessary.<eos> I think it's time The Superior sends some men of his own.<eos> Anton Ivanov, a reclusive industrialist<eos> - with a submarine. - Bingo.<eos> You said you wanted to destroy the Inhumans and the thing that brought them upon us.<eos> - What is it? - A man.<eos> You can help me get to him?<eos> You're not May.<eos> He switched you, didn't he?
She's brave, and she's not afraid of death.<eos> But she deserves the chance to live what's left of her life on her own terms.<eos> I know you can appreciate that.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.<eos> Hello, sweetheart.<eos> You're lucky you're with us and not the FBI.<eos> We have you on tape walking into the Senator's office moments before the blast.<eos> What do you care?<eos> That woman hated things like you.
Any robotic humanoid must avoid the appearance of being... almost human.<eos> Even the slightest appearance of inauthenticity elicits a sense of revulsion.<eos> You mean avoiding the uncanny valley.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But you don't look at all uncanny.<eos> In fact... you look entirely authentic.<eos> Familiar, even.<eos> - I'm not unique?<eos> - Aida, you're absolutely unique.<eos> It was just... good science to model you on someone... real.
We can see and hear everything.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> Agnes, please, listen ...<eos> Hello, Holden.<eos> This is not what I had in mind.<eos> I'm sorry for all the precautions, but I have to be careful.<eos> There are people after me, you see.<eos> I-I-I've made some scientific breakthroughs as of late, and not everyone agrees with my methods, so ...<eos> Holden, stop.<eos> I asked you to meet me because I wanted closure, but if you don't have the guts to face me...

Bomb squad's meeting us on the ground.<eos> You ready?<eos> Do you remember my Degas print?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> You knew I loved that print.<eos> You told me that when I was cured, - you'd buy me the real thing.<eos> - I remember.<eos> I want you to know the day you left me, I threw that print in the bin.<eos> I couldn't look at it anymore.<eos> Agnes, I hate myself for disappearing on you, but I never gave up.
I couldn't look at it anymore.<eos> Agnes, I hate myself for disappearing on you, but I never gave up.<eos> I just...<eos> I've realized I was going about it all wrong.<eos> Instead of trying to cure your tumor, I should have been trying to cure death itself.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> Turn left here.<eos> Go around the corner.<eos> Come with me, Agnes, please.<eos> I can save you.
And how would you cure death?<eos> - By making me into an android? !<eos> - No, I'm done with robotics.<eos> This breakthrough I've made is way beyond that.<eos> I call it the Framework.<eos> I've built a world where death is obsolete.<eos> You wouldn't even be the first to experience it.<eos> I have a subject in the Framework right now, and she's thriving.<eos> I can give you a full and happy life. That's ...<eos> That's all I've ever wanted for you.
Those aren't ours.<eos> - Who, then?<eos> - The Russians.<eos> This is a trap.<eos> Shockley's the bait.<eos> They're here for us.<eos> See?<eos> It's pointless!<eos> I've already won!<eos> I don't have to kill you, just deliver you!

I really hope you figure this one out.<eos> What was the mission you were on here?<eos> May and I were sent to retrieve an 084.<eos> Years and years ago. With May?<eos> That can't be a coincidence.<eos> So, your plan was to ask the guard to let you in?<eos> You know how persuasive I can be.<eos> Can you even say, "Please open the door for me," in Russian?<eos> Almost.<eos> But I do know a few choice words I have for you right now.
You did this. You jinxed us.<eos> You literally willed this into existence.<eos> They don't cover safe-cracking - at the Communications Academy?<eos> - Don't worry. I have got this 100% under...<eos> Shut up. Don't worry.<eos> I'm good with my hands.<eos> - Not how I remember it.<eos> - Okay, here it comes. It's never long before you bring that up.<eos> Well, I remember you fumbling quite a bit.<eos> I didn't know you that well back then. I didn't want to be presumptuous.
S.H.I.E.L.D. claims to be a beacon for humanity.<eos> What it really is is a safe haven for Inhumanity.<eos> They... will come for me.<eos> That is the plan.<eos> Preparations here are nearly completed.<eos> That is nearly a satisfying report.<eos> If you're done playing with your food, there is still work to be done.<eos> Metaphor.<eos> Well done.<eos> Do my methods disturb you?
I'm pretty capable of protecting myself.<eos> You have enhanced yourself, I'm sure.<eos> I'd be a fool to expect anything else.<eos> Enhanced humans, aliens and their technology...<eos> The deeper I dug, I found there was one man at the center of it all.<eos> You.<eos> I thought the mission came before the man.<eos> Did you really think I was gonna leave - your defenseless ass behind?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I 100% did. I let you sweat a little.

Not for long.<eos> In the meantime, Daisy will contact the inhumans, inform them she's coming to collect them personally.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then execute them on sight.<eos> Which reminds me, the hardware we brought from the Russian's loading dock...<eos> Still in the shipping container on Zephyr one.<eos> I'll oversee it's off-loaded down into the basement now.<eos> Yo-yo's our most-valuable asset, so we want to get to her first.<eos> Sounds like the right idea.<eos> Yo-yo, we're coming to get you.
Who was the one that didn't want to leave the base, saying it was a calibration error?<eos> ! You knew!<eos> There's no calibration error!<eos> I'm not the one that's pointing the gun!<eos> I bloody well know that I'm not an android!<eos> You would lie and say that if you were!<eos> What are you doing? You don't know.<eos> You don't even know, like may.<eos> Stop it!<eos> The... the same goes for you.
Well, it's one of us!<eos> It's one of us, Fitz.<eos> Well, regardless of who it is... It's my fault.<eos> It is.<eos> It is.<eos> I perfected the technology.<eos> I started this whole nightmare.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't... Make me feel bad for you.
It is.<eos> It is.<eos> I perfected the technology.<eos> I started this whole nightmare.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't... Make me feel bad for you.<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you, Jemma. Even if you are a decoy.
You don't think that'll take too much time?<eos> It'll be more efficient than you think.<eos> Okay. I'll suit up.<eos> Zephyr in 10?<eos> I'll be ready.<eos> I need you conscious to map your frontal lobe, so you can't be too heavily sedated.<eos> The rest you can sleep through.<eos> You have Fitz's mind.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm doing it for you.
The rest you can sleep through.<eos> You have Fitz's mind.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm doing it for you.<eos> For us.<eos> What we've always suspected I now know to be true.<eos> Consciousness is separate from the physical self.<eos> Don't hurt yourself, Jemma.<eos> There's no reason to be afraid.<eos> I was always trying to protect you, pursuing technological solves to the problematic scenario that you could be harmed or killed.
And coulson just bashed an agent's head in and...<eos> They were all replaced... You, too.<eos> It's not you.<eos> It's not you!<eos> Simmons...<eos> It's me.<eos> What about you?<eos> Prove to me that you're not a frickin' robot. Because it looks like you're malfunctioning.<eos> No way to prove it.<eos> You won't know until they kill you.

Give me your hand!<eos> I'll quake you, not to hurt you!
We can't fight them, Daisy. It's too much.<eos> It's all too much.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Don't worry about fighting them, okay?<eos> I will. I will take them on myself.<eos> No, Daisy, don't do this.<eos> You don't have your gauntlets to protect your arms. It doesn't matter.<eos> Look, I know you still feel like you have to atone for Lincoln's sacrifice, but sacrificing yourself is not the answer.<eos> That is not what this is about.<eos> I can't lose you, too!
I don't buy it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Now get up.<eos> Really?<eos> Not even winded?<eos> We don't want to hurt you.<eos> That's not what it feels like.<eos> Daisy, this is for your own good.<eos> We didn't want to hurt you, but we have no choice here.<eos> Now let us download you before you bleed out.
You were right.<eos> Our programming is different.<eos> Are you afraid to die?<eos> 'Cause I am.<eos> I know I'm not real.<eos> I'm all phantom limbs.<eos> But that doesn't make the pain less real.<eos> You don't have to feel pain.<eos> You say you don't anymore.<eos> But that pain, that regret... That's what made you a person...
And rescue them.<eos> That sounds easy.<eos> Will it be easy?<eos> They have no idea.<eos> And if they're in there too long, their bodies will... Give out.<eos> Well, that's the hypothesis.<eos> So we have to go... now.<eos> Meet at the rendezvous right away.<eos> That's where I programmed the backdoor to get out.<eos> And listen, living in there too long may kill you, but dying in there will definitely kill you, so... Be careful.
Sure we can, Inhuman!<eos> Son of a...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Get him up.<eos> They can handle it on their own.<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're on another planet this morning.<eos> Look... I get it.<eos> You put yourself out there last night, and I let you down.
Are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I came looking for you.<eos> Get started with the briefing.<eos> No, no, no, May, it's me.<eos> I... I got into the Framework.<eos> I don't care what you've hacked.<eos> May, look at me.<eos> It's me... it's D...<eos> Do I have to get you drug-tested?
- Please, please, please.<eos> Get out! Get out!<eos> - Get out!<eos> - I just need to find my friend Daisy.<eos> - Can I use your phone?<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Please!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Just please close the door.<eos> I warned you not to be late.
Do I look like I'm Hydra?<eos> You look like a bag lady.<eos> I'm Jemma.<eos> Coulson let Hydra take your friend?<eos> Damn.<eos> You know, Coulson used to fight Hydra.<eos> He was as brave as you and got into more trouble and even trained me well enough to steal this car.<eos> Coulson?<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Look, I mean, they're definitely gonna stop you now.
No, she's a friend.<eos> - What is he doing here?<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> Down this trail!<eos> Daisy, they're coming.<eos> You need to do something before psycho stalker shoots us!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Ward, look at me.<eos> I have never betrayed you, ever.
Wait.<eos> You're right.<eos> May's biggest pain was killing the girl in Bahrain.<eos> You take that away, and hundreds of kids are killed in Boston.<eos> And Coulson is leading a quiet life.<eos> I'm worried he's not the same man.<eos> He really let them take a kid?<eos> And what did they do to Fitz to make him such an ugly person here?<eos> Well, that one's easy.<eos> They stole you from his life.
Eliminated a loophole for their escape.<eos> Next, we tighten the noose.<eos> So, you have surveillance on...?<eos> On one of them, yes.<eos> - I'd like to see it.<eos> - No.<eos> Your work is too important to be distracted by these criminals.<eos> I won't stand by as they try to destroy everything that we have built.<eos> I have to protect that.<eos> I have to protect you.
Daisy, it's too dangerous.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> I'll be in and out.<eos> No one will even know I'm there.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we find her.<eos> We've detained several Inhuman sympath...<eos> Dismissed, Agent.<eos> All this for one subversive?<eos> Why won't you let me help you?<eos> I need you focused on your work right now.
You're worried.<eos> Who is she?<eos> No one.<eos> She doesn't matter.<eos> She's plotting against me.<eos> I need to find her and expose anyone who's helping her.<eos> I'll send my team.<eos> Consider the threat eliminated.<eos> You'd really do anything for me, wouldn't you?<eos> I'd cross the universe for you.
Some of them have the Inhuman gene or they had a relative who did.<eos> Hydra's hunting them.<eos> It's all we can do to find them first, give them shelter, and relocate them somewhere safe.<eos> Well, look what the cat dragged in.<eos> Been too long, sir.<eos> What's happened?<eos> They got Skye.<eos> Is this gonna take long?<eos> We have a mission.<eos> Madame Hydra's office requested you specifically.
So, this Radcliffe... is he dangerous?<eos> Maybe not physically.<eos> But sometimes the greatest threats are the ones right in front of you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I should've never left Skye.<eos> I'm sure she'll be okay.<eos> Which I keep telling myself, but if anything happens... I'd never forgive myself.<eos> I'd die for her.<eos> Why don't I give you a minute?
- So, she's an Inhuman, then?<eos> What else have you been keeping from me?<eos> This woman is not from here.<eos> She crossed over...<eos> from the other side.<eos> - I thought that was impossible.<eos> - As did I.<eos> So this is why you've been so keen on finishing Project Looking Glass.<eos> The people from that world want to destroy what we've built.<eos> I was only trying to protect you.
Thank you.<eos> Listen, we need to talk.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> You're Daisy Johnson.<eos> We're both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to get you out of here, reconnect with Coulson and Simmons.
We're both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to get you out of here, reconnect with Coulson and Simmons.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - Yo-Yo is with us on the outside.<eos> She's safe.<eos> You have no idea how worried she is about you.
If you do this, I lose him forever.<eos> I will tell you everything...<eos> Everything...<eos> I just... I need you to trust me.<eos> Fitz would never hurt an innocent woman.<eos> Y-you're right.<eos> The subversives are here.<eos> I-I-I-I see now, I should've been more forthcoming.<eos> Please, put the gun down.<eos> I'll... I'll take you to them.
Simmons?<eos> You two were in love.<eos> Unbreakable.<eos> A force to be reckoned with.<eos> The Fitz I knew nearly drowned for Jemma.<eos> He crossed the bloody universe to rescue her!<eos> You see what we're up against?<eos> They mean to destroy us.<eos> She lies because I'm right.<eos> She's trying to deceive you.

How curious.<eos> Someone else tried that today.<eos> Maybe you heard him just now, learning his lesson.<eos> So, I re-ran your test results.<eos> Guess who turned out to be a potential Inhuman.<eos> Go on.<eos> Guess.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.
I didn't see the car, I swear.<eos> I think she was drunk or something.<eos> She swerved right into me.<eos> Little heads-up would be nice.<eos> Skye?<eos> I hope not.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Why are you doing this, Fitz?<eos> It's Dr. Fitz.<eos> And unlike the men who just left, I know the truth about you, and your world.
Somehow you conquered Hydra in your world, and now you want to conquer ours.<eos> All I want is to get out of here.<eos> Tell me where the Patriot is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did he come from your world, too?<eos> We all did, you included.<eos> And the other subversive, Jemma Simmons?<eos> She's not a subversive.<eos> Where is she?<eos> If I knew, I would tell you because if anyone could get you to wake up and realize that this nightmare isn't real, it's her.

Mack?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Phil Coulson.<eos> I was here when you first came in.<eos> This is Jemma Simmons.<eos> Ah, it's good to meet you.<eos> This little girl right here, this is my daughter, Hope.<eos> It's lovely to meet you, Hope.
Not a coward, but a man of action, a great man in a hard world.<eos> And in a hard world, we cannot afford the luxury of what?<eos> The luxury of sympathy.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We don't buckle to guilt or womanly sentiment.<eos> Everyone needs the strap across their back now and again.<eos> Teaches respect.<eos> You know that.<eos> You've felt it.<eos> And look where it's gotten you.

That's why, in my house, I'm the judge of what's fact or fiction.<eos> "Did you clean your room?"<eos> "Well, I'll be the judge of that."<eos> Dad, watch.<eos> I can do five in a row.<eos> Five times?<eos> Really?<eos> This I got to see.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What are you smiling at?

Really?<eos> This I got to see.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What are you smiling at?<eos> Same thing you are.<eos> Big, fake dad loving his little fake kid in this crazy fake world.<eos> I finally get why you don't like me.<eos> You think I'm someone I'm not.<eos> Forget I said anything.<eos> You don't believe me, and I... can't really look at you.
And me, what -- i don't make the list?<eos> Let's move.<eos> I did not think it possible for a machine to be on edge.<eos> It is not.<eos> I am simply recalibrating after a setback within the framework.<eos> Has one of your playthings rebelled?<eos> Agent may has begun to question the narrative she was programmed with.<eos> How very human of her.<eos> It is no more than a slight complication.<eos> Then I will un-complicate it for you.
Leopold...<eos> Finish it.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.<eos> We've just gotten word on their location -- no.<eos> Finish the machine.<eos> If project looking glass is completed, it won't matter.<eos> This body won't matter.<eos> O-of course.<eos> anything for you.
No need to explain.<eos> There's one thing i need to know.<eos> After you're gone...<eos> Do I get my Skye back?<eos> Honestly, i don't know.<eos> although she is hydra, so...<eos> Well, every relationship has its ups and downs.<eos> we'll get through it.<eos> for what it's worth, i didn't...<eos> I didn't totally understand him... Until I met you.
Madame Hydra's executive order is in response to...<eos> She's not subtle, that Madame Hydra.<eos> Yeah, just look at her uniform.<eos> It's so crazy hot.<eos> I-I mean, if you're into the whole "bad girl" vibe.<eos> Not... not me.<eos> I'm just... making an observation.<eos> Trip!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's so good to see you!
All right, take care.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, what's with the luggage?<eos> We're going home.<eos> Yeah, we just wanted to free up some bunk space for those more in need.<eos> That's super thoughtful, but we actually have a situation.<eos> Simmons just came back with some intel that could help us take out Madame Hydra for good.<eos> Sounds like you might want someone who's a little more combat ready.<eos> We need you.
Immortality.<eos> If that sort of thing appeals to you... yeah.<eos> Daisy's looking for a way out.<eos> Hello, Agent May.<eos> - I'm Jemma Simmons...<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> My squad's been hunting you the past week.<eos> Yes, I suppose that's true.<eos> How did a little pop tart like you evade capture?<eos> It's good to have you back.
It will kill everyone Fitz cares about.<eos> Call him, tell him to come here, alone.<eos> Why?<eos> So you can blow his brains out?<eos> I could never hurt him.<eos> I only want to talk.<eos> Now make the call.<eos> Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.

We're going back to our world.<eos> Coulson, wait!<eos> Coulson, get up!<eos> Get up!<eos> Coulson's gonna die.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> Stay here.<eos> This feels oddly familiar.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> We'll get you patched up. No.
Come on, May.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Just jump.<eos> Jump.<eos> I followed you.<eos> I'm amazed you went through.<eos> I was a little squirrelly on the other side.<eos> It was kind of cute.<eos> May, I'm so sorry.<eos> I tried to find you.
At least you had a shotgun axe.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> You were right.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> Simmons, you're up!<eos> Hello, Jemma Simmons.<eos> Seems you finally found me.<eos> - You don't get to say my name... not after everything you've done.<eos> It wasn't supposed to be like this.<eos> Aida... she took you from me, and I came here to rescue you.
Aida... she took you from me, and I came here to rescue you.<eos> So you kill my father?<eos> Right after he tells me that he loves me, you murder him in cold blood... as I listen.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Nothing that you've done has been an accident!<eos> You want to destroy this world!<eos> You want to destroy me!<eos> You want to destroy the woman that I love.<eos> That woman is lying to you!
Its name is Aida...<eos> Artificially Intelligent Digital Assistant.<eos> And stop making excuses for it!<eos> Radcliffe and Daisy told you the truth!<eos> Please...<eos> Fitz, you have to wake up.<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> No.<eos> Please... you don't have to do this.<eos> I love you.
You saw it with your own eyes... it's a computer program.<eos> All of it.<eos> Even Hope.<eos> She laughs at my jokes.<eos> We watch movies together.<eos> And when she's sad... when she's sad, I hold her.<eos> No.<eos> She's real to me.<eos> I understand.<eos> And I know how hard this is, but you have people... who really care about you... who love you very much.

Listen to me, Fitz.<eos> None of that is your fault.<eos> I wanted to do those things.<eos> It felt natural.<eos> I think I'm a bad person.<eos> No.<eos> No, you...<eos> - Leopold...<eos> - Ophelia?<eos> I am so happy to see you.
I didn't think you were coming back.<eos> Something go wrong?<eos> No.<eos> No, they all made it through.<eos> She doesn't know what happened.<eos> I was waiting till tomorrow to tell her, but I guess I don't have to now.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, look who's here.<eos> Dad.<eos> I tried waiting up for you.
Can we get one break?<eos> ! Guess they weren't assessing powers at Hydra as much as collecting them.<eos> Who even knows what Hydra was doing in the Framework.<eos> Wait.<eos> You do, I guess, right?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm... having trouble sorting through the...<eos> Two lives we lived?<eos> You feel that, too?<eos> Nice to see you again.
First day of class at academy...<eos> Befriending you, trying to understand what it felt like to connect with someone.<eos> But I wasn't able to actually feel anything.<eos> Until today.<eos> Feeling...<eos> Love, wonder, joy... For the very first time, and I think my heart might burst from it.<eos> At last, I get to make my own choices, and... And the first thing I choose, Leopold... is you.<eos> It's not that simple!<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> What stopped you?
You knew about her?<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> Not until I saw her face.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Yeah, well, in there, she's 10.<eos> And she's bright and adorable, and she means the world to him, even if it's not a real world.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He wouldn't have left her for anything.<eos> Even me.<eos> He didn't remember you, Yo-Yo.
He didn't remember you, Yo-Yo.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Then I'll go remind him.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> Do not...<eos> - I 'll go get him out myself.<eos> - Do not do that.<eos> Besides the fact that going into that world as an Inhuman is the worst idea ever, we need you here, making sure that the real Mack stays alive, or it'll all be for nothing.
I need to take one for the team.<eos> You'll be useless afterwards, unconscious or unresponsive.<eos> Well, so you give me mouth-to-mouth.<eos> What's up?<eos> You mad that I was Hydra in there?<eos> I don't blame you for that.<eos> Then, what?<eos> Did something weird happen with my robot self?<eos> Did I make a move on you?<eos> Phil, did I try to... Kill you?
I can.<eos> Especially you.<eos> How confusing this must be.<eos> So you can imagine how your actions could be perceived.<eos> You were ruthless.<eos> I was ruthless to win the heart of the man I love, the man you grew to be.<eos> My father's son.<eos> I thought his presence is what you'd have wished for.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just programmed to make you happy.
And I haven't been totally honest with you about what happened when you were not around.<eos> I knew something was up.<eos> What are you not telling me?<eos> - I drank the bottle of Haig. - What?<eos> !<eos> You piece of...<eos> We got to get to the surface!<eos> - We can't leave Mack!<eos> - You'll drown down here!<eos> I'll get you up top, then I'll come back for him!
What we felt...<eos> Past tense.<eos> 'Cause my future with Jemma's dead.<eos> Killed that, too.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There isn't room in my heart for two people.<eos> You were everything to me.<eos> I know.<eos> But as devoted as I was to you in the Framework... I understand you better now.
- but... - "But"?<eos> But what, Leopold?<eos> I just... I only mean that...<eos> - Jemma...<eos> - No!<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Look, calm down, calm down. We're just talking.<eos> This is...<eos> This is a new emotion for you.
This is...<eos> This is a new emotion for you.<eos> No!<eos> God.<eos> I clawed my way through that world, worked myself to the bone to have a choice... To have bones and blood and freedom and love!<eos> And... No!<eos> Okay, please, please... Just... just... just... Remember...<eos> Let's...<eos> Let's return to that mood.<eos> I chose you!
Let's return to that mood.<eos> I chose you!<eos> We need to extract Fitz from that room!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Don't move!<eos> We're not the enemy here.<eos> - Let's just keep our cool...<eos> - You shut your robot mouth.<eos> Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.<eos> I chose you!
I chose you!<eos> Now you choose me!<eos> That's not how it works.<eos> You can't control everyone anymore!<eos> Watch.<eos> We will build a life together, whether you want to or not!<eos> We're stuck in here?<eos> What did you do? !<eos> No!<eos> Fitz, I got you!
You can't control everyone anymore!<eos> Watch.<eos> We will build a life together, whether you want to or not!<eos> We're stuck in here?<eos> What did you do? !<eos> No!<eos> Fitz, I got you!<eos> Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Grab him!<eos> You're lucky she didn't kill you.
Go on.<eos> To be human is to suffer.<eos> You are far from human.<eos> I've read that book.<eos> We both know there are things beyond this universe.<eos> And you may, in fact, be one of them.<eos> I am nothing but torn and twisted insides!<eos> I can't stand it.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I can make you feel something else.
Previously on "marvel's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> I haven't been totally honest with you.<eos> I drank the bottle of haig.<eos> I chose you!
I wish we could, general, but my team and I are aida's primary target.<eos> Our presence would only endanger the lives of everyone there.<eos> If anything changes, you'll be the first to know.<eos> Is that a good-news face or a bad-news face?<eos> It's a weird-news face.<eos> Robbie reyes just stole his charger out of a S.H.I.E.L.D. impound garage outside of Dover.<eos> What's new?<eos> Nothing much.<eos> Beat up a couple dudes, turned out to be robots.<eos> I didn't think I'd see you again, not after you fell through that hell mouth.
Do we know who he is?<eos> No, looks like aida's been busy.<eos> She could've duplicated anybody.<eos> I'll run facial recognition, see if we can ID this guy.<eos> We look fantastic.<eos> We look fantastic.<eos> Don't disappoint me.<eos> You know I don't handle disappointment very well.<eos> That is why we are going to recreate the other world.<eos> To please you.
We must unite!<eos> Read this.<eos> You'll see the answer!<eos> There's still a pulse.<eos> Everybody out... now.<eos> And get some medical help.<eos> Phil.<eos> They'll be back for that.<eos> Hello, Daisy.<eos> I had a lot of time after you shattered my spine to think about what I'd do when I saw you again.
Everybody out... now.<eos> And get some medical help.<eos> Phil.<eos> They'll be back for that.<eos> Hello, Daisy.<eos> I had a lot of time after you shattered my spine to think about what I'd do when I saw you again.<eos> I decided it might be fun to watch you kill yourself.<eos> Aida, seriously, therapy.<eos> Just consider it.<eos> It's time for me to take you home.
Yes. Daisy.<eos> She's a friend.<eos> She and coulson and the others are safe on the other side.<eos> That's where I'm from.<eos> That's where you're from.<eos> I'm just trying to keep my kid safe and get these people out of town.<eos> I don't have time to...<eos> You're right.<eos> There isn't any time.<eos> Look around you, mack.
It's aida.<eos> The "a" stands for "artificial," remem...<eos> Ophelia, you're upset because... Because this is all new.<eos> There's... There's lots of feelings.<eos> That must be overwhelming.<eos> It is overwhelming.<eos> There are too many feelings, which is why I've decided to only feel one of them...<eos> Vengeance.<eos> It's hot and clean and sharp like a knife.<eos> And my vengeance is going to make you suffer the way that I have suffered.
Part of it seemed real.<eos> Maybe part of it was.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe on my end, too.<eos> So here's what I think we should do.<eos> When we get out of this mess, we take a couple of steps back, start again.<eos> Then when it feels right, maybe we open another bottle.<eos> Deal.<eos> Deal.<eos> See you on the other side.
Too late.<eos> This is making me feel better.<eos> Fitz, why do we feel better when we make someone else suffer?<eos> Because there's something wrong with you, you psycho!<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> Please, please, spare Jemma.<eos> So it's Jemma now?<eos> Trying to humanize her.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better than that.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> Please, please, spare Jemma.<eos> So it's Jemma now?<eos> Trying to humanize her.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better than that.<eos> Fitz, please.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Make her stop.<eos> The darkhold!<eos> That's the only way we could beat you.

Make her stop.<eos> The darkhold!<eos> That's the only way we could beat you.<eos> Let Jemma go, and I'll go get it for you.<eos> You did this, Fitz.<eos> I'm so sorry, Jemma.<eos> Coulson's reading the book.<eos> He's firing up the gateway right now.<eos> Come on. Please.<eos> Let me take you to it.
Because this world is ending, and I don't want you to end with it.<eos> Daisy said that hope wasn't alive in the other world.<eos> That's true.<eos> Well, I'm not living in a world without her.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Okay, it's now or never.<eos> Time's running out.<eos> That door is the only way out.<eos> Please, mack.<eos> Everyone who cares about you is on the other side of that door.
Am I the only sane person here?<eos> Daddy, make it stop.<eos> I'm right here, sweetheart.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Am I gonna die?<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I want to be real.<eos> Please, daddy. Don't leave.<eos> No, no.<eos> I will never leave you.
I'm right here, sweetheart.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Am I gonna die?<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I want to be real.<eos> Please, daddy. Don't leave.<eos> No, no.<eos> I will never leave you.<eos> You're my little girl.<eos> I will always love you.
That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful ghost rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> I do.<eos> Are you gonna tell the others?<eos> No.<eos> And I'd ask that you don't, either.<eos> I will when it's time.<eos> When I first saw you with hope, I...
- Are you fired?<eos> Not really.<eos> We can start work right away.<eos> I have so much to ask you.<eos> My head's buzzing with questions.<eos> Good thing you came.<eos> - Your room's ready.<eos> - No need. I'll go to my hotel.<eos> Look, tell you what.<eos> Why don't you take a shower and change?
So you... You'll meet characters from the book. The real people, though.<eos> So when you meet them... You may have questions but...<eos> Please don't ask them, OK?<eos> Ask me. Deal?<eos> Sure. I came here for you.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Oh, and... I want us to be alone.<eos> You, me, the book.<eos> We'll work more productively here.<eos> I can drop you at the hotel tomorrow. Huh?
A stray.<eos> Tommy.<eos> Tommy from the book.<eos> Like your dog as a kid.<eos> Tommy.<eos> Always Tommy.<eos> Neval.<eos> Yes.<eos> Orhan.<eos> - He's been dying to meet you.
The only person Deniz takes seriously.<eos> The only one he takes criticism from.<eos> Doesn't he mention that in his book?<eos> Mr. Oğuz.<eos> So you've met Orhan. Uh-huh.<eos> Mr. Oğuz is our host.<eos> He's also a superb writer.<eos> His books are always bestsellers.<eos> You must read him.<eos> If the zeitgeist interests you, that is.
For the book?<eos> My book, my films, everything I do... It's all just a sham.<eos> My life is a sham.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Do you really believe that, for goodness sake?<eos> You know who you are. And why you write.<eos> You also know the strongest pan of your book.<eos> Where, for goodness sake?<eos> Yusufs funeral and everything else involving Yusuf.<eos> Fuck you.
Nothing satisfies him.<eos> Nothing is enough for Deniz.<eos> Ms. Betül, Deniz is especially fond of you.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> I bought him ice cream at Baylan Patisserie every week.<eos> Then when you found someone handsome... You'd send the boy home in a taxi.<eos> At least I had the men one at a time.<eos> Süreyya, remember the three young men... Pounding on the door one day to see Güzin?<eos> What slander!<eos> Say that again and I'll sue you.

Mister, can you pass forward a fare for one?<eos> A fare for one.<eos> Can I gel out here?<eos> OK.<eos> Can I get a fish sandwich?<eos> What do you want from me, asshole?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Fuck Off!<eos> FUCK you!
Deniz wrote that you died in his book.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> I guess he wanted to see my face when I saw you.<eos> So how do I die?<eos> Suicide.<eos> Or that's how it comes across.<eos> So he even decided on my death.<eos> Why do I kill myself?<eos> He doesn't say.<eos> But he portrays you so beautifully.
He talks mostly about your childhood.<eos> Deniz is stuck back in those days?<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> If only I hadn't come that night... Or... I'd never left him.<eos> I wish, I wish, I wish.<eos> If only we hadn't swam together or held each other.<eos> If only I'd never met Deniz.<eos> If only I'd never met Deniz.<eos> No, stick it in your pocket.<eos> - It'll make you feel better.
I gave up writing a long time ago.<eos> Are You serious?<eos> Why'?<eos> - Let me get the dessert.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> [On the fem] that day... Sitting there quietly... Out on deck...<eos> Your shoulder was brushing mine.<eos> Walking towards the car... That first evening... When I first saw you...
A ton of shops have opened.<eos> The guy next door wanted me to sell up.<eos> So he could expand his shop.<eos> I said, 'My brother isn't here.'<eos> - "I can't decide without him."<eos> - You should've sold if you wanted.<eos> The shop's yours.<eos> You've put so much into it.<eos> No, I used you as an excuse.<eos> I'd have sold up if I'd wanted without asking you.
I was always on my own.<eos> You know what Mum's concern was?<eos> That you'd feel guilty about her.<eos> Imagine.<eos> She didn't want you to regret not being there when she was sick.<eos> You know how many times she made me swear...<eos> Not to say anything to you?<eos> But that's how she was.<eos> Amazing.<eos> People were so anxious to gossip and malign you.
-Sultan, where are we going?<eos> Sony.<eos> Can we go to the bus station?<eos> They have nowhere to stay here.<eos> We have a relative in Bursa. That's where they're going.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Bless you.
Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Deniz would never kill himself.<eos> Maybe someone decided it was time...<eos> - He left the stage.<eos> - You asshole.<eos> Who'd want to kill Deniz?<eos> You would know.<eos> Who got the stuff for him?<eos> Come on. Let's hear it.<eos> - Fuck you.
But phenomenal.<eos> To go to the heart of the city, to be a part of it.<eos> Of Istanbul.<eos> To be a pan of Istanbul.<eos> He'd wait for me on the shore.<eos> Because he knew he could never do it.<eos> My darling.<eos> My boy.<eos> Our Yusufs gone.<eos> He talked about you all the time.
He talked about you all the time.<eos> Any excuse and he mentioned you.<eos> Deniz, Deniz.<eos> He always talked about you.<eos> Ms. Süreyya.<eos> The car's waiting.<eos> Goodbye, Orhan.<eos> Mr. Orhan.<eos> I hate to trouble you, but... Remember to shut the doors and windows tight.<eos> I hate you.

Sony, I should 've let you know, but I couldn't do it.<eos> I tried. I set off.<eos> - But then I turned around.<eos> - I'll come wherever you are.<eos> I'm almast home.<eos> Where are you, Neval?<eos> What did Deniz write?<eos> - Neval, where are you?<eos> - I told you. Close to home.<eos> Stay where you are, OK?
- But then I turned around.<eos> - I'll come wherever you are.<eos> I'm almast home.<eos> Where are you, Neval?<eos> What did Deniz write?<eos> - Neval, where are you?<eos> - I told you. Close to home.<eos> Stay where you are, OK?<eos> You're breaking up.<eos> - I can't hear you properly.
What did Deniz write?<eos> - Neval, where are you?<eos> - I told you. Close to home.<eos> Stay where you are, OK?<eos> You're breaking up.<eos> - I can't hear you properly.<eos> - OK. I've stopped.<eos> Mia! did he write?<eos> The letter starts like this.<eos> I hate you.

Why do you say you hate yourself and me?<eos> Why do we have to punish ourselves because others have punished us?<eos> We need just one thing.<eos> And that's a little courage.<eos> I think I have it.<eos> I'm not afraid of you. I'll rise to your challenge.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> How about you?<eos> I'm sorry you couldn't come, Neval.<eos> I wanted to see you.
A dumb pen. You brought it.<eos> There's a woman in Europe. She's investigating this thing...<eos> This incident that John's connected to.<eos> She's gotten footing.<eos> Nothing meaningful, but footing.<eos> And, Alice, she cannot connect the person that John's positioned as right now to John Tavner.<eos> And she cannot connect him to you.<eos> It means his freedom.<eos> Something happened, and it means his freedom.<eos> He called you, I know, from this place on this night.
I wanna look out for him.<eos> Because...<eos> Why?<eos> Because I don't think anyone's looking out for him, Dad.<eos> I am.<eos> I'll go to him now.<eos> Okay, hon?<eos> I'll go right now.<eos> - Don't let go.<eos> - I got you.
Wow.<eos> I'm afraid I told you everything I can about that evening.<eos> I can't believe all that money fit in this pillow.<eos> I may have seemed a little nervous back there at TSA.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I just want you to know that fainting isn't a sign of weakness.<eos> It's just a sign that your bod doesn't have the support system to cross the finish line.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You have more than piping on your mind.
Don't get defensive.<eos> It's just a little weird, putting a guy in a bag.<eos> - You know...<eos> - What? That's not a fair technique in an argument to call someone defensive.<eos> It's a great technique, because they can't argue with you after that.<eos> They have to stop arguing or they'll sound defensive.<eos> Just make sure you get him to Edward that morning, because you have to get to the bagman straight away.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm glad to see you.
Fuck. Yeah.<eos> Fuck. - I got stuff to do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You are 22 minutes behind schedule.<eos> Fuck, man.<eos> Now, I'm sure the bagman checked out of the King Gerald.<eos> He knows you'll be looking for him.<eos> But you're gonna find him that morning.<eos> How?<eos> How would someone find you?
The first bunny ear, he meets the second bunny ear.<eos> Over, round...<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> What's up with him?<eos> He's French.<eos> What are we having here then?<eos> Reddiwip, marshmallows, hot fudge.<eos> My God!<eos> First one's for you.
You're forgiven.<eos> So...<eos> What are we doing today?<eos> I've heard there's this place in the Quarter where they shoot you in the chest for money.<eos> I think that might be fun.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wear a vest and that.<eos> It's a game.<eos> Where they pay you to get shot in the chest?
You just zoom in, then you...<eos> Okay.<eos> Seriously.<eos> What the hell happened with you and this girl?<eos> I didn't marry her, Tulip.<eos> I'll tell you that much.<eos> Which one?<eos> Tell me.<eos> That one.<eos> Don't make me shoot you, man.
Ain't no preacher here, man.<eos> I'm a Jew!<eos> You know, zoom in, resolve.<eos> "Hold on.<eos> Is that a clue there?"<eos> You know, like they do in the shows.<eos> Preacher?<eos> Are you serious, man?<eos> No!<eos> Don't make me bust you up!
Kill me then.<eos> See what happens.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> Or see what doesn't happen.<eos> The old man doesn't matter now.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Talk quick before I lose this bullet in your skull.<eos> You think you're working for God, don't you?<eos> Kill the Preacher, and God will give you what you want.<eos> 'Cause I got some bad news for you.
That just kills me.<eos> That's a television.<eos> That's an actor.<eos> This whole thing's a coverup.<eos> The real God left us down on Earth to fend for ourselves.<eos> Where is He?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I know what you want.<eos> You wanna go to Heaven.<eos> God won't get you there.
Where is He?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I know what you want.<eos> You wanna go to Heaven.<eos> God won't get you there.<eos> And know the signs of the world to come!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You leave us alone, I can.<eos> Can you now?<eos> Why did the angels send for you to kill me?
Can you now?<eos> Why did the angels send for you to kill me?<eos> Genesis.<eos> I got a power inside me.<eos> A power that rivals God's.<eos> I can command anyone in the universe to do my bidding.<eos> I can call upon the angels.<eos> I can send a man to Hell if I want.<eos> I've done it before.<eos> I can send you to Heaven.
Just wondering how it was all going.<eos> You close?<eos> Yep, I'd say I'm pretty close.<eos> Okay, 'cause...<eos> Denis is pretty sick.<eos> He doesn't have his medicine.<eos> Jesse?<eos> You still there?<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> Hey, while I have you...
Nope.<eos> Burner phone?<eos> Plastic Dixie cups?<eos> A bag of lawn fertilizer?<eos> I'm standing on the street in the middle of the Bywater, Tulip.<eos> I don't have lawn fertilizer.<eos> But I can get some.<eos> Now what?<eos> Now I'd get back.<eos> I'll call you back.
"The only living man without a soul."<eos> That's why the Word didn't work on you.<eos> You didn't have a soul.<eos> But now...<eos> - Now...<eos> - Drop it!<eos> Disarm.<eos> The gun, sabre.<eos> A copkilling, childmurdering son of a bitch trying to make his way through the pearly gates?<eos> You really think there's a place for you in Heaven?
Disarm.<eos> The gun, sabre.<eos> A copkilling, childmurdering son of a bitch trying to make his way through the pearly gates?<eos> You really think there's a place for you in Heaven?<eos> Up there with your wife and child?<eos> Living in peace for all eternity?<eos> No.<eos> I'll tell you where you belong.<eos> Right back in Hell.<eos> And that's where I'm gonna send you.
Preacher!<eos> Bollocks, this is ridiculous.<eos> Denis...<eos> Would you just do the...<eos> Do the remote for me?<eos> My fingers are still growing in.<eos> All right, so check it out.<eos> DVD, Bluray, got a PlayStation, Denis, see?<eos> PlayStation, Rock It Five.<eos> That's for you, Tulip.
It's gotta be a dirty cop or we'd handle it internally.<eos> You'll know the name Kyle Corbett, controls the bulk of the drug trade north of Toronto.<eos> Someone from our side is feeding Corbett information.<eos> Find the link between Cardinal and Corbett.<eos> Listen, we don't know Cardinal's done anything wrong. That's right.<eos> If he's dirty,<eos> I'm not getting in your way but right now, this nightmare... whatever else Musgrave has you doing, this is your priority.<eos> Clear?<eos> I need to go to Toronto for the autopsy.<eos> I'll come with you.
She called the school in the middle of the day and they pulled me out of class.<eos> Thought it was an emergency but she just wanted to talk about plans for the spring, a hike she wanted to take and some mural she wants to paint?<eos> She was all over the place.<eos> I should have known that she was in trouble.<eos> That's not her.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> She won't even remember making the call.<eos> I don't know how you stay so patient.<eos> They got something off the audio tape.<eos> I'll pick you up.
They got something off the audio tape.<eos> I'll pick you up.<eos> Is that your new partner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dad, she's hot.<eos> That's... she's-she's-<eos> Hi.<eos> Kelly, this is Delorme.<eos> - Lise.<eos> - Lise. Nice to meet you.
I had a meeting in the area.<eos> Thought I'd take a chance, see if you were free?<eos> I'm on my way out.<eos> Um, Josh, John Cardinal.<eos> The new partner.<eos> I gotta say I had a different picture in my mind.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Lise said that you seemed older than your years, but I don't know, you don't look that old.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I'll walk you out.
Look, nobody was talking to you.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Have a good night, kids.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I seem to bring it out in people.<eos> No, don't blame yourself, that guy was a head case.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Can I ask you a favour?
Could you walk me home?<eos> I don't feel safe with that guy out there.<eos> I-I just...<eos> My place isn't far.<eos> I just ordered this drink.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I could call you a cab if you want.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Where's your friend?<eos> You thought he was gonna walk you home like a gentleman.
Hello.<eos> Blessed be the fruit...<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> I'm Commander Waterford.<eos> Peace be to you.<eos> May God make me truly worthy.<eos> Right.<eos> Well.<eos> Good.<eos> Nice to meet you.
So privileged!<eos> The fuck?<eos> Welcome to the friggin' loony bin, right?<eos> All right, girls.<eos> We will have silence.<eos> Like little mice.<eos> Okay.<eos> Welcome to the Rachel and Leah Center.<eos> Up.<eos> Fuck you.
You're not there anymore.<eos> That's all gone.<eos> Now, get back into bed.<eos> What'd you hit me for?<eos> Wasn't it good?<eos> I can bring you another one.<eos> My name is Moira and this is the Red Center.<eos> I don't know any Moira.<eos> Don't you know what they'll do?<eos> They'll send you to The Colonies.
I got caught at the airport.<eos> We tried to cross in Maine.<eos> With my husband.<eos> Then we split up.<eos> They shot him.<eos> They weren't going to let any of us get away.<eos> Not if you had a red tag.<eos> This is your stop.<eos> As they used to say.<eos> It was nice to finally meet you.

Sometimes we walk home along by the river.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> By the river?<eos> With her.<eos> Ofglen.<eos> She's my partner.<eos> We shop together.<eos> Don't get too close to her.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> He wants to see you.
Exhale, exhale, exhale.<eos> Breathe, breathe, breathe. Hey.<eos> And hold, hold, hold. You're doing great.<eos> You smell so good.<eos> You do.<eos> Hi, Hannah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello there.<eos> You looking around?<eos> Is Daddy keeping you awake?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.<eos> Girls!<eos> Energy!<eos> Let Him feel your devotion... And we will be rewarded.<eos> Hold, hold, hold.<eos> Exhale, exhale, exhale.<eos> Good girl, Ofwarren.<eos> Good girl.<eos> You are doing so well.<eos> We are so proud of you.
Yeah, she's okay.<eos> Is she all right? She's okay.<eos> Don't take my baby!<eos> She's crying a lot.<eos> Don't take my baby!<eos> Please!<eos> No one knew anything about what your Commander might want.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But that doesn't mean it's bad.<eos> If he accuses you of something, don't defend yourself.
I guess it's a little strange.<eos> I want...<eos> This will sound silly.<eos> I'd like to play a game with you.<eos> A game?<eos> Do you know how to play?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Threeeightysix to threeeightythree.<eos> You're good, but I caught you at the end there.
All right.<eos> I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?<eos> I'll check my schedule.<eos> Well.<eos> See if you can squeeze me in.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Nothing exciting, just meetings.<eos> Well, after you get back, then.<eos> It's a date.<eos> Now, I think it's time for you to go home.
She picked it for me?<eos> For good luck, I'm sure.<eos> We're all so hopeful.<eos> Hopeful?<eos> You haven't asked for your napkins yet this month.<eos> And I know you're just a few days late, but a baby?<eos> Wouldn't it be wonderful?<eos> Blessed day, Offred.<eos> How was your walk?<eos> Very pleasant, thank you.
You look really comfortable like that, Serena.<eos> Offred... Would you like to hold her?<eos> Here she is.<eos> Do you think that's a good idea?<eos> Offred knows.<eos> She's done it before.<eos> Isn't she beautiful?<eos> - If you don't mind.<eos> There we go.<eos> Yes, let's get you over here.
Can I tell you another secret?<eos> Um... You can't tell anyone, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> He...<eos> He loves me. He loves me so much.<eos> Who?<eos> Him.<eos> My Commander.<eos> He loves you?
I'm sorry.<eos> I should've asked permission.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I imagine you two have a lot to talk about these days.<eos> Did Ofwarren seem well?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I'm afraid she might be losing touch.<eos> Well, that can happen sometimes... With the weaker girls.<eos> You know, what you do, what we do together is so terrible... It's terribly hard, and we must remain strong.<eos> Which is why I feel so blessed to have you.
Nick.<eos> Whatever they want to know, just tell them.<eos> I couldn't stop them.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, I'll call Morgan...<eos> - And you try the office again.<eos> - I'll call now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come home soon.<eos> I love you.

There's a law.<eos> Well, we found out we're boned.<eos> Big surprise.<eos> I should get going.<eos> We're pulling together a march for Thursday morning.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> This can't last.<eos> Hey, you have all my money now.<eos> So, congratulations.<eos> Come on. You know I'll take care of you.
It is so fucking patronizing.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bring it on. I wanna hear why I shouldn't take care of my wife.<eos> "My wife"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She doesn't belong to you.<eos> That's right.<eos> Yeah. No, no, no.<eos> She isn't your property.<eos> And she doesn't need you to take care of her.
'Cause we're less than.<eos> That's exactly...<eos> It's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> I'll take care of your money.<eos> Yeah. I'll take care of your body.<eos> You really got a fucking problem, you know that?<eos> Should I just go in the kitchen and cut my dick off?<eos> No, you should do that. And while you do it, take a video of it, 'cause the girls down at the collective will love watching that shit.<eos> They'll love it.<eos> It's not for the collective. It's for you. You know that.

You know that.<eos> Hey, Davis is closed.<eos> You're gonna have to take the train at Alewife.<eos> Shit.<eos> You want me to walk you to the station?
Her hair?<eos> Her lips? What part of her is so very pleasant?<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> Just, um...<eos> The whole package, I guess.<eos> So, on these walks, alone, did you ever do anything more than talk?<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Apologies, Offred.<eos> This is, rather delicate territory.<eos> Did she ever touch you?
We'll have order, please.<eos> Mr. Gambel for the State?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans, Chapter 1, Verse 26. By His word.<eos> And do you swear by His name that the report you have submitted is the truth entirely?<eos> Yes, I do so swear.<eos> Then in the name of God and His servants here on Earth, the accused are hereby found guilty.<eos> Martha 6715301, you are hereby sentenced to the Common Mercy of the State.<eos> And you, Handmaid 8967. Your existence is an abomination.<eos> True justice would see you sent to an eternity of suffering.

I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Except for the weird guy who just snuck into my room.<eos> Other than that...<eos> You're dripping.<eos> I brought you some ice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wish... I should've...<eos> I should've just driven away with you.<eos> No ice cream for you this month, young lady.
My beautiful miracle.<eos> Truly.<eos> Mrs. Waterford, I'm not pregnant.<eos> I got my period.<eos> When?<eos> Last night.<eos> You will stay here, and you will not leave this room. Do you understand me?<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Things can get much worse for you.

- No, I got it. - [sighs]<eos> That first moment when I tear into living flesh is like...<eos> Totally up to speed, honey.<eos> I should have killed him.<eos> Sweetheart, it's not your fault that Loki got away.<eos> You only had the one shoe on and you had a very light breakfast.<eos> I used to be the guy, you know.<eos> Crunch time?<eos> Give Ice the ball.<eos> "Ice"? When did they call you "Ice"?
"Ice"? When did they call you "Ice"?<eos> There was a guy.<eos> It was an away game.<eos> You didn't go.<eos> - So there was one guy once.<eos> - My point is...<eos> Didn't they always give you the ball? You were the quarterback.<eos> All I'm saying is, if I had stopped Loki, we wouldn't be in a car for the better part of two days waiting for him to return.<eos> - So you're not a killer. - [sighs]<eos> I love you for who you are, not who you think you should be.
- Nice buns.<eos> - [chuckles] Nice icebreaker.<eos> I haven't seen you around in a couple days.<eos> I've been kind of busy.<eos> Robots don't build themselves.<eos> Yet.<eos> Are we cool?<eos> I mean, after what happened the other day?<eos> The other day?<eos> Oh, when I tried to kiss you and you pulled away, horrified.
- I'm in charge of pens.<eos> - Said the brutally handsome man.<eos> - Now you're just making it worse.<eos> - Am I, stud?<eos> "A branch from Groot.<eos> Guardians of the Galaxy, 2014."<eos> Wow, I've never been this close to a celebrity.<eos> You should buy it.<eos> It's $1,000.<eos> If we get this, we won't have anything left for you.

I just want to make you happy.
Now if you have any problem killing this guy, any problem at all, you call me, okay?<eos> And if you have any problems finding that pen...<eos> Yes, I'll call.<eos> Look at us.<eos> Dividing up tasks, nobody doing what they don't want to do.<eos> - This is good for us.<eos> - I guess.<eos> Although I feel like I'm not really holding up my end.<eos> Well, honey, we shouldn't force each other to do something the other person doesn't want to do.<eos> Like when I dragged you to see the World Famous Lipizzaner Stallions.
- Till I met this hot cup of coffee. - [laughs]<eos> Well, have fun with your watermelon.<eos> Hey, I'd love to make a donation.<eos> What's your charity for?<eos> Blind... ness.<eos> They wanna stop it.<eos> Well, I don't have my checkbook, but I do have... $200. Is that...?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you sure you don't want the other half of my Molly?<eos> It'll relax you.
Would've been good to know.<eos> And I didn't call you a pussy.<eos> She was being hyperbolic.<eos> Oh, yeah, Eva's hyperbolic as shit.<eos> But if she says you're cool, you can go.<eos> - Really? - Nope.<eos> Huh.<eos> Excellent news.<eos> I got the pen.<eos> Oh, my God. I was so worried about you. [sighs]
I almost killed an innocent man.<eos> And even if I find a worthy charity to donate the money to, I'm still gonna get the tax write-off.<eos> - Oh, sweetheart, it's okay.<eos> And I hated being there without you.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I don't wanna do this alone.<eos> It was like when I gave birth to Abby.<eos> I did the messy parts, but I needed you to get me through it.<eos> You're never gonna be alone again.<eos> As much as I complain about Loki's friends, they made me realize I want to be there for you.
People you blackmailed me to kill, including your wife's boyfriend.<eos> That's right.<eos> I know everything.<eos> Whoa, you hear that?<eos> That's the sound of the tables turning.<eos> So let me get this straight:<eos> you have a file on a guy who's not dead, and another file on an active case that you must've stolen from my house?<eos> Well, that's another way of looking at it.<eos> Joel, you just had your little moment, but let me tell you how this is gonna go down.<eos> You're gonna keep doing what I tell you to, because if you don't, I'm not only gonna put you away, I'm gonna put your wife away too.
Tara Messer, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.
I don't care because we need him.<eos> Monday morning, you better start putting your money where your mouth is and find us another $50,000 case.<eos> Tara left a 15second voicemail.<eos> She's either gonna tell me that she never wants to see me again or she wants to make up.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your first year's salary in advance.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Harvey, I'm running out of ways to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.<eos> I'm offering you a deal.<eos> One for you, one for me.
One for you, one for me.<eos> I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year.<eos> I want to fund it for two, and any case I want to bring the clinic onto, I can.<eos> Done.<eos> - And there's one more thing.<eos> - You are not getting my office.<eos> Yes, I am, and I will tell you why.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.
Yes, I am, and I will tell you why.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.<eos> Harvey. What are you doing here?<eos> Nothing, I was just driving this baby around and remembered how much street parking you had.<eos> Is that supposed to impress me?<eos> Well, I hope so.<eos> Sure as hell impresses me.<eos> Well, it's nice to see you, but if you wanted an appointment, you should have called.

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and...<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - Please, let me finish.<eos> Things have changed since the last time I saw you.

- You did your homework.<eos> - Sure did.<eos> So the only question is:<eos> Thursday at 8:00 or Saturday at 9:00?<eos> One dinner, and if this chemistry you so clearly think exists doesn't, then we part as friends, no hard feelings.<eos> If it doesn't work out, no harm, no foul.<eos> Thursday.<eos> And if the car's too much, I can always have Ray drive.<eos> I like the car.<eos> What did you say? I couldn't hear you.
Thursday.<eos> And if the car's too much, I can always have Ray drive.<eos> I like the car.<eos> What did you say? I couldn't hear you.<eos> I like the car.<eos> Good. You're here early.<eos> I need you to take point on a consumer fraud hearing for Sandra.<eos> Nathan, I need to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know things got heated between us the other night, but as far as I'm concerned, it's water under the bridge, so if you're wondering if I'm still upset at you...

Just like I insisted on every other case I take from now on being pro bono.<eos> It sounds like you insisted on that to make yourself feel better.<eos> No, Nathan, I did that because I care about doing this kind of work, and if you're okay with it, I'd even like the idea of us partnering on a case every now and then.<eos> But what if I say I'm not okay with any of this?<eos> I know that you were the one that gave me another chance to be a lawyer when no one else would, but don't punish the clinic.<eos> With that, you could replace me and help a lot of people for a long time.<eos> - Is that for me?<eos> - No, actually, it's for me.<eos> You're later than usually this morning.<eos> I've been waiting for you.
- Is that for me?<eos> - No, actually, it's for me.<eos> You're later than usually this morning.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> Donna, about the other night.<eos> I know you said you wanted more, but before you say anything...<eos> - I want to be a partner. - Partner?<eos> Yes.<eos> I figured out what I want, and I want to be a partner at this firm.<eos> Donna, I don't mean to insult you, but you're not even a lawyer.
You think a bike rack would fit on this wall?<eos> You put a bike rack in here, your first pro bono, you'll be representing yourself after I shove it up your ass.<eos> Wow. That sounds uncomfortable.<eos> Now, speaking of pro bonos, when are you gonna get your old man records out of here so I can settle in and get to work?<eos> I'll get out of here once we take of Neil Stillman.<eos> Neil Stillman?<eos> Detour Industries?<eos> No, Neil Stillman, Jedi counsel.<eos> Okay, I was asking because<eos> Neil Stillman is a corporate client, so what happened to one for me, then one for you?

What kind of person goes to a sex club in Bangladesh?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> I had just seen "Slumdog Millionaire," and I was trying to find Freida Pinto.<eos> I believe she considers London her place of habitat.<eos> No, I'm not talking about the real Freida Pinto.<eos> I'm talking about my Freida Pinto.<eos> There's many different Freida Pintos out there, okay?<eos> So just... I'm not an idiot.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Louis, I'm just worried that if you sit around and stew, this breakup's gonna get the best of you.
Gretchen, I really appreciate that, but I'm not just gonna sit around.<eos> I'm gonna be pouring my heartbreak into those new associates.<eos> Are you sure that's the best idea?<eos> Look...<eos> I didn't just lose Tara.<eos> I lost a chance at being a father.<eos> And those associates have always been my children to me.<eos> My children.<eos> And the truth is, I've been neglecting them ever since they got here, but that ends this morning.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.
Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole?<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> Now, on your desks, I've made each of you a copy of my initial brief.<eos> Cling to it as if you wrote it yourself, and if any of you need to go to the bathroom, I suggest you do it now, because for the next two weeks, we are not leaving this room.<eos> No one will be shitting. No one will be pissing.<eos> - No...<eos> - Go ahead, ask him.<eos> Ask me what?<eos> I heard about your reputation, but... But what?<eos> Don't you worry about my reputation, son.
Louis, I'm gonna let that go, because I know you're hurting, but that right there is exactly why I'm right, because if you're willing to talk to me like that,<eos> God help those associates.<eos> - Yes, is this Dr. Feelgood?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I'm sorry. You've got the wrong number.<eos> This is Dr. I Have Work to Do.<eos> Well, in that case, I'd like to schedule an appointment as soon as possible.<eos> Harvey, why exactly are you calling me? First, answer me this:<eos> How many times have you considered picking up the phone and telling me that you've reconsidered<eos> If you don't count right now.<eos> Then let's just say I'm calling to tell you that I've been in a room full of models for the last hour, and all I can think of is you.
We should take a ride around the city.<eos> You go.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I ju...<eos> I might be taking over the associates, and if I do, I just want to be prepared.<eos> Rachel, that's amazing, but are you telling me that Louis is really ready to give that up? That's the long story.<eos> But I'll tell you about it later tonight.<eos> - No, you should go...<eos> Great, okay.<eos> - I love you too.
What if, by accident, I happen to be one of the people that let himself get too drunk?<eos> You just might as well keep drinking, 'cause if we're not having fun, what the hell are we doing here? Yes!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Svetlana...<eos> You know this office isn't gonna pack itself up, right?<eos> It's not packed because one of us has been at work for the last three hours.<eos> The other one of us was sleeping off all the work he did last night.<eos> You mean you're hung over from all the vodka you drank?<eos> Yeah, that's what I just said.<eos> I never should have hired you back.
- And you've also been avoiding the subject.<eos> This way, you have to take me seriously. I do take you seriously.<eos> Then walk the hell down to Louis' office and tell him I'm a partner.<eos> Donna, I can't just ram every decision down his throat. Every decision?<eos> You haven't even told him that you're stepping into Jessica's shoes yet.<eos> I'm waiting for the right time.<eos> And if I were a partner, I would tell you that the right time was yesterday.<eos> Donna...<eos> Harvey, you think I'm asking for charity, I'm not.<eos> I am asking for you to make official what I have been doing for years anyway, which is giving you advice, like you need to step the hell up and tell Louis that you're in charge, and right this second, you're either gonna take that advice,
I'm just a little distracted.<eos> Halfway through appetizers.<eos> Doesn't bode very well for how you'll be feeling when our flambé arrives.<eos> It's not that.<eos> Jessica left the firm last month.<eos> Everyone assumes that I'm next in line, and now I've got Donna telling me that if I don't step up...<eos> Wait a second, I thought you told me as of the other morning that you're now head of the firm. I just haven't told Louis yet, and Donna won't let it go.<eos> I think this may have been a mistake.<eos> - What?<eos> - You didn't come to me to date me, you came to me because you're in the middle of another crisis and you need me to walk you through it.
Yeah, of course I do.<eos> It's because it's natural for a client to transfer feelings of desire onto his therapist that aren't real.<eos> - What you may not know is that it's not unnatural for a therapist to feel the same way.<eos> You don't think I've had fantasies about you?<eos> That one day you'd show up at my office as I was heading home for the night, and I turn around, and you'd be there.<eos> You wouldn't say a word, but... you'd take me in your arms and kiss me, and... it would actually be the start of something special.<eos> Well, I have, which is why despite my better judgment, I'm here with you right now. - So what's the problem?<eos> - The problem is those fantasies weren't of me being a therapist to a man who's still too afraid to admit that he needs help, much less take control of a firm that bears his name.<eos> Thank you for dinner, Harvey. If you need a session, call my office.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't see you anymore, but I can give you a recommendation for someone who can.
I swear I was gonna tell you.<eos> Yeah, I heard, but I guess when you move on, you move on, right?<eos> - Come on, it's not like that.<eos> - Bullshit, it's not like that.<eos> You left, Mike, after everything you said.<eos> Would you please just let me explain?<eos> I fought for your goddamn job.<eos> I know that, and I will always be grateful for it, but I am telling you, it's better this way, because... Better for who?<eos> Based on that extra cash that you had to throw at Nathan?<eos> I'd say it's better for you.
- You don't understand.<eos> - I understand that you said that you wanted one last case together before you stepped up, but you clearly are not ready to step up, so I got to get my pro bono cases in before this place doesn't even exist anymore.<eos> Are you finished, or do you have a minute to hear why I let the sale go through?<eos> No, I don't care.<eos> Mike, I have no proof he knew.<eos> He's Jessica's client.<eos> How's it gonna look if he tells the world that we can't handle his business anymore?<eos> Well, I'll tell you how it looks right now.<eos> It looks like you're afraid and you're not in charge.<eos> Okay, you say something like that to me, you better get ready for a hit, because I am doing the best I can.
No, I don't care.<eos> Mike, I have no proof he knew.<eos> He's Jessica's client.<eos> How's it gonna look if he tells the world that we can't handle his business anymore?<eos> Well, I'll tell you how it looks right now.<eos> It looks like you're afraid and you're not in charge.<eos> Okay, you say something like that to me, you better get ready for a hit, because I am doing the best I can.<eos> No, Harvey, you're not doing shit.<eos> You're hiding, 'cause you're afraid.<eos> You're afraid to take responsibility for this firm, and you won't admit it to yourself. I don't have to listen to this.
You're hiding, 'cause you're afraid.<eos> You're afraid to take responsibility for this firm, and you won't admit it to yourself. I don't have to listen to this.<eos> Well, you're going to, 'cause way back when, you cared enough about me to tell me the same thing to my face, and I'm just returning the favor.<eos> I'm not her, Mike.<eos> I'm not her.<eos> You don't have to be her.<eos> You just have to go back to being you.<eos> The Harvey I met the day you hired me, he would have gone in there and told Neil Stillman to go fu... himself.<eos> So it's up to you.<eos> You can keep hiding out in Jessica's shadow, or you get out of it and start being Harvey goddamn Specter.
I don't care whether you agreed to it or not.<eos> You're gonna live with it.<eos> And I don't give a shit what your supposed title is.<eos> I'm not giving up my associates.<eos> And if you think you're gonna leave this bathroom without giving me the respect I deserve...<eos> I'm not giving up my associates.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - Harvey, what the hell kind of shit did you pull?<eos> Shut up and listen, Louis.<eos> Donna asked for a seat at the table, and I gave her one, because when she worked for me, she had my back, and would kill anyone coming for me, and when she worked for you, she did the same exact thing,
I don't want to talk to you right now, Louis...<eos> I want you to have the associates.<eos> Whatever you said to Donna, you were right. - Rachel, just let me finish while I'm still able to get it out.<eos> I know I can be rough on them... but it's only because I want to see them become the best lawyers they can be.<eos> But I'm not in the best headspace right now, and if I keep taking my anger out on them, they will not become great lawyers.<eos> They might not stay in the law at all, so... it's better that someone else takes over for a while, and I cannot think of a better person than you.<eos> I'm sorry that I went behind your back, Louis. You were right to.<eos> If you had asked me facetoface,<eos> I don't even know what I would have done, and that... just thinking about that makes me sick.<eos> Rachel, you're family, and if I lose you too...
Are you serious?<eos> Yes.<eos> And from now on, it's,<eos> "Are you serious, ma'am?"<eos> Have you got that, pretty boy? My God.<eos> Harvey's created a monster, hasn't he?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Donna... it's about time.<eos> I know we haven't spoken, and we didn't exactly leave things off well, but...<eos> I just really need to see you tonight if at all possible.
Shit.<eos> This one's for you, Charlie.
If you have such a love for money and so little love for life, why not pick the biggest one they got?<eos> Or maybe it's ladies' night, after all.<eos> I think one of the smaller...<eos> All right.<eos> Biggest one it is.<eos> You got it.<eos> oh, dear god.<eos> you got this. Okay?<eos> Remember, just hold your breath.<eos> And I love you.

We can make something beautiful and new.<eos> All you have to do... Is meet me at the train station with the microfiche.<eos> And...<eos> Anyone know where I can get a copy of that microfiche?<eos> Saltonstall: Yes.<eos> Very good indeed. Starr?<eos> And... Go.<eos> I told you already, Mr. Peterson, the answer is "no."<eos> I shouldn't even be meeting you right now.<eos> Give me the microfiche, you bitch, or I'll kill you and your family.
Mrs. Waterford, this is state business.<eos> She's pregnant!<eos> I just wanted to check if you were okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I should've just driven away with you.<eos> Mrs. Waterford, I'm not pregnant.<eos> I got my period.<eos> You will stay here, and you will not leave this room.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Things can get much worse for you.
We don't know anything really yet.<eos> I can guess.<eos> We get the turkey baster full of old‐man jizz, shoved up our twats so we can maybe pop out a baby for the Fatherland.<eos> Sounds awesome.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You spell "Aunt Lydia" with a "y," right?<eos> Oh, God, don't do that.<eos> What?<eos> I like to read when I take a dump.<eos> If they catch you writing, you will lose a hand.
Right on schedule.<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> Waterford's probably sterile.<eos> Most of those guys are.<eos> Sterile.<eos> That's a forbidden word.<eos> There's no such thing as a sterile man anymore.<eos> There's only women who are fruitful and women who are barren.<eos> I can help you.<eos> It could be the only way for you.

I can help you.<eos> It could be the only way for you.<eos> If Waterford can't get you pregnant, they won't blame him.<eos> It'll be your fault.<eos> It'll only take a few minutes, honey.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> Mommy loves you.

Go back to your room.<eos> How did you survive her?<eos> Just please talk to me.<eos> Blessed be the pure in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> Blessed be the pure in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> Aunt Elizabeth?<eos> One of the toilets is overflowing again.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Don't make a fucking sound.<eos> Anyone see you?
Where are you taking this Handmaid?<eos> Open the gate.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> He can't be in here yet.<eos> First is household staff, then the wife, then the Commander.<eos> And he knocks.<eos> He has to knock.<eos> He can't be in here.<eos> Sorry, did I startle you?

Do you know which train goes to Boston?<eos> It's coming in now.<eos> It's hard without the signs, right?<eos> They're going to replace them soon, I think.<eos> Where's your partner?<eos> You shouldn't be out alone.<eos> Can I see your ID card?<eos> Where are you posted?<eos> Moira, you wouldn't stand for this shit.<eos> You wouldn't let them keep you in this room for two weeks.
I'm sorry.<eos> Please. Please, I'm sorry. Please, please, please.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The most painful thing is not the betrayal of trust, June.<eos> Do you know what's most painful?<eos> The most painful thing in this entire ugly incident is the ingratitude.<eos> Don't you realize the opportunity you have been given?<eos> Yes, yes, I try to.<eos> You were an adulterer, a worthless slut!<eos> But God found a way to make you useful.
Where'd you hear that?<eos> Does it mean something?<eos> Not really.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> How is it a joke?<eos> It's only funny if you know Latin.<eos> Actually, it's probably only funny if you're a 12‐year‐old boy studying Latin.<eos> It doesn't really translate.<eos> It's something like,<eos> "Don't let the bastards grind you down."

Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Just swallow what's in your mouth.<eos> [gulps] Do you remember that dinner we had in Tuscany?<eos> - On the terrace, outside the castle.<eos> - [sighs] I keep thinking about how good that waiter would taste right now.<eos> [footsteps approaching] Running late.<eos> I'll grab something at Starbucks.<eos> Wait a second, sweetie.<eos> I know there's been a lot of changes in the last couple days but one thing hasn't.<eos> Your father and I are here for you if you ever need to talk.
And when we do find someone, we have to be prepared.<eos> - No more impulse killing, it's too risky.<eos> - Totally. We have to get tarps, gloves, mops, sponges, bleach to clean up the blood...<eos> All the blood.<eos> So much blood.<eos> Blood everywhere.<eos> - Hon?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You don't have to go with me.<eos> I'm not sending you out to do this alone, sweetheart.
We should buy some other stuff so we don't look suspicious.<eos> Suspicious that we're cleaning our house?<eos> We also need taco shells for Taco Tuesday.<eos> Which gets so messy.<eos> I feel bad that I wasted so much of Gary.<eos> We recycle, we compost, and yet I threw away 150 pounds of meat.<eos> You ate much as you could, honey.<eos> Even Gary wouldn't have expected you to finish him.<eos> Flash-frozen seafood.<eos> That looks good to you?

Do you wanna hang out? Oh, no, I can't. I'm seeing Cole.<eos> Look what he got me for our three-month anniversary.<eos> God, he's such a sweet boy.<eos> He's not a boy, Sarah.<eos> I mean, he's a 26-year-old drug dealer who drives a car that says, "Ask me about my tiny dick."<eos> [engine revving] Yo, Sarah.<eos> Don't be jealous.<eos> I just have an exciting life.<eos> And by the way, it is a perfect starter dick.<eos> I love you, okay?

Ahh-cha! I swear, I had no idea about that when we started dating.<eos> [Abby] His Instagram is KidWeed.<eos> - [Sarah] I thought that was ironic.<eos> - [silent mouthing]<eos> Excuse me, waiter?<eos> I'll have that.<eos> Did you know, in three weeks we'll have had this listing for a year?<eos> It's not our fault.<eos> It's priced too high, the seller won't come down, and there's about to be a murder in here.<eos> Hey, if you can, try to keep it contained.
It's no worse than what you did to the turkey on Thanksgiving.<eos> - We need new knives.<eos> - So buy some.<eos> They're expensive and they just get dull.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, we have a gift certificate to Williams-Sonoma.<eos> [doorbell rings]<eos> - [Joel] Cole! - So glad you made it.<eos> - It's good to meet you.
- Why not?<eos> - It saddens me.<eos> Mind if I smoke a little weed while we wait?<eos> [inhaling] So... selling drugs to kids, that seems pretty fucked up.<eos> Well, it wasn't part of the plan, dude.<eos> You know? I mean, I started selling pot in high school.<eos> I grew up, I tried to get out of it and my dumb sister gets a divorce so I end up having to help her out.<eos> Sometimes you do shit you never expected for the people you love.<eos> That is so true.<eos> I know, but then I look at you and I think you got a great career.
Yeah.<eos> You're not gonna die today.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry, everyone.<eos> So rude. Where's Cole?<eos> - I told him to go.<eos> - What?<eos> He's an okay guy and a really good listener.<eos> He doesn't deserve to die in an overpriced Spanish revival.<eos> I leave you for five fucking minutes and you bond with my dinner?
Porsche guy was from Nevada.<eos> He owned a strip club and a waste management company.<eos> Oh, nothing sketchy there.<eos> - Any family photos?<eos> - Nope.<eos> I found pictures of a few women but they were taken from inside a toilet, so probably not serious relationships.<eos> Maybe he won't be missed.<eos> What a night.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> - I love you, Joel, so much.

- ♪ Good morning to you ♪ - [Sheila] Mmm!<eos> What a beautiful day!<eos> I love walking with you guys. Friends, fresh air, sunshine.<eos> Look how hard you're working.
Oh, my.<eos> That is roomy. [chuckles]<eos> Rick, look at me, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> [crunching] I can make my hips go side to side now.<eos> - I could never do this before.<eos> - Why would you want to? Because it's a turn-on, Rick.<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> So what's a car like this set you back?<eos> It doesn't set you back, Rick, it launches you forward.
- What does that matter?<eos> - Trigonometry matters a lot. There are triangles in everything.<eos> Pizza.<eos> Triangles.<eos> Not the shape, the musical instrument.<eos> - Honey, anything you want to add?<eos> - Sure. If Abby doesn't want to go to school, she shouldn't go.<eos> - What?<eos> - Wait, you're serious?<eos> As a triangle. She's not gonna use half the stuff they teach in there and you never cared about trigonometry.

I wish I had more answers, honey.<eos> I know things may have changed from when you were here in high school but... it's still beautiful.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Come on, your mom's waiting for us at that science fair.<eos> Wait. Where'd you carve your initials?<eos> There it is.<eos> [Abby] Aww.<eos> That's sweet. It's been here over 20 years.<eos> Of course, the artwork around it is new.<eos> [computer voice] Nice to meet you.
Tell Abby don't bother coming to school tomorrow.<eos> What a cuntstick.<eos> - Hold this?<eos> - Sheila!<eos> - [gasps] Joel!<eos> Hi, you're here.<eos> Where's Abby?<eos> She needed to swing by her locker.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I have loved you since we carved our initials in that picnic bench.

[laughs] Because... it's canning season and the peaches may already have gone bad.<eos> - You like canning, too?<eos> - Get out!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I killed Dan.<eos> I thought you were just going to talk to him.<eos> Negotiations broke down, so I hit him in the head with a shovel.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - It just happened.<eos> He was threatening to send you to jail and saying mean things, and you kinda had to be there.
Right now.<eos> Dear Lord, I sit with some of your flock to ask...<eos> - [door opens, closes] - [Abby] I'm home!<eos> We're in here, praying.<eos> - Shall I?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> Dear Lord, I sit with some of your flock to ask...<eos> [Abby] Is there any Advil in your bathroom?<eos> to ask for your help in bringing Dan safely back to us.<eos> Lord, we love you...
Wait. You killed him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Men can kill, too.<eos> Did you also kill the frozen guy in the storage unit?<eos> - You know about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I've seen your blender and I know what's in your smoothies.<eos> Look, you need to kill and eat people, I get that.<eos> But here's what I need: no more lying to me.<eos> We were just trying to protect you from the truth because we want our family to be as normal as possible.
Yes.<eos> Uh, I'll tell Lisa you're here.<eos> Look at them.<eos> All rugged individuals, yet working together.<eos> In another time, they would've been cowboys.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> And don't just say you're okay.<eos> I don't know. I see things I feel are true and I share them.<eos> I've noticed.<eos> And I'm worried about you.
You were right about one thing, Dan.<eos> I won't be having sex in your lifetime.<eos> - Whoa, coming in hot.<eos> - He was such a jerk to my mom.<eos> And this is probably the most quality time he's ever spent with me.<eos> I'm just sorry I never got a chance to let him know how I feel.<eos> You could tell him now.<eos> I don't think he's going anywhere.<eos> There was never a moment I wasn't scared of you.<eos> But when I see you like this... I realize you're just a small, sad man.
I can't finish him.<eos> The dogs will be here pretty soon.<eos> - We're going to jail and it's my fault.<eos> - How is it your fault?<eos> I killed Dan.<eos> I brought death into this house.<eos> I'm the one that made killing seem normal.<eos> And it is so not normal, Joel.<eos> The way you've been acting today?<eos> I broke you.

Hello. I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood.<eos> To say "hello"?<eos> I know your "hello's," honey, and that one was pouring me a glass of wine.<eos> Well, it's been a few days and I guess I've just gotten used to the frequency, intensity and sheer insanity of your undead libido.<eos> It hasn't been that crazy. Sweetheart, we had sex in the bathroom at Target 'cause their logo turned you on.
Do you think we should get a gun?<eos> Statistically, if we have a gun, we're 2.7 times more likely to hurt ourselves than Loki.<eos> As is our right. I think between the icepick and your hammer-knife thing and your beautiful nails, we're gonna get the job done.<eos> The same job we do every day:<eos> selling a house. It's in a bad neighborhood.<eos> The bigger question is, why aren't you in school?<eos> 'Cause I'm selling a house in a bad neighborhood. See how lame that excuse sounds?<eos> We said we'd be honest with each other, okay?<eos> I did not have a class last period.<eos> Your turn. Sweetie, we are not going to lie to you anymore.
Oh, uh, where are we taking it?<eos> There is an illegal chop shop like two rows down.<eos> Chop shop?<eos> They chop things up, not fix them.<eos> You're cute when you're scared. Well, there's a lot more where that came from.<eos> [laughs] Sure, cupcake, I can fix it for you.<eos> I take cash, grass, or ass.<eos> And I'm good on cash and grass.<eos> - Dude, I'm 16.<eos> - Yeah, me, too. Nobody wants to fuck you, shit stain.
All he'll want is some cocaine and a handwritten thank you note.<eos> Well, that's great, but where did you get all these?<eos> From small, bad men who were no longer using them.<eos> Well, if they were just going to waste...<eos> Mmm...<eos> Sheila. Your skin is so soft and cold.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sheila, as far as we know, we're the only people like us in the world.<eos> - We should be together.<eos> - What? I'm married. I've only met you twice and both times I was trying to kill you.
I puked twice.<eos> Also, I think we're gonna have to throw out the pasta maker.<eos> I left it to soak, but it's not looking good.<eos> Did you try vinegar and baking soda?<eos> [softly] Oh. I shouldn't have made such a big deal about Loki.<eos> It just freaked me out you two having so much in common.<eos> But then I realized we've spent half our lives together.<eos> No one will ever have more in common with you than I do.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> And you're right, Loki is no threat to you.
- You have a toe problem?<eos> - I was going to tell you...<eos> Her toe fell off.<eos> She knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.<eos> - Your toe fell off?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - See?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - You shut up. No, you, and I'm really pissed about the door.<eos> - Guys! - Sheila, come away with me, and your toe problem won't be a problem, because I will accept you no matter how much you deteriorate.
Don't talk like that.<eos> There has to be.<eos> - We have to try, even if it's a long shot.<eos> - It is a long shot.<eos> But it's a sure thing that my daughter needs me.<eos> And I need to know that if I'm not gonna be here, she's gonna be okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll just go with Eric.<eos> How hard can it be to get a nervous paranoid recluse to show me his most prized possession?<eos> I have faith in you.
Mom, you don't have to sexualize everything.<eos> - He's not wrong.<eos> - Oh, you two.<eos> Hey, you told me you would clean up your room before you left.<eos> - I'll do it when I get home.<eos> - Promise is a promise, mister.<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Have fun today.<eos> I love you.
And "stoled" is not a word.<eos> What?<eos> How is he gonna learn?<eos> - College.<eos> - Smooth.<eos> While I enjoy mother/daughter stuff on the Internet, this isn't working for me.<eos> So why don't you get out of here before I press charges.<eos> I'm the one who should be pressing charges.<eos> Your brother took my money and didn't fix my bike.<eos> My brother was a stupid fucking idiot, so if he ripped you off,
Now we're learning another lesson.<eos> If you treat people firmly but with respect... [handsaw buzzing] [raising voice] ...you're more likely to get what you want.<eos> - He's not coming out.<eos> - It would appear not.<eos> Now what lesson are we learning?<eos> - [buzzing stops]<eos> - To let it go. We're gonna go have our tea and we're not gonna let our day be ruined by some pervert who can't even look us in the eye when he's cheating us.<eos> What kind of tea are you gonna get?<eos> Probably like a nice steaming cup of...<eos> fuck you, motherfucker!
bad vodka, poisonous flowers, Jews.<eos> [Joel] What about Serbia?<eos> What?<eos> Didn't your research also uncover a book about an event in Serbia or not?<eos> I don't know. 16th century Pozica. You've done your homework.<eos> Yeah. Big fan.<eos> I'm Joel.<eos> Oh, you're the guy who's called me a billion times.<eos> May I see the book, please?<eos> I don't know you and I don't take it out in public, but I do keep a digitized version of it along with ten gigs of paranormal, classified documents right here on this thumb drive.
Hey. So you moderate that Zombie Town subreddit.<eos> Oh, you're a fan? Uh, uh...<eos> I'm super busy right now but, uh, I guess I could sign something.<eos> No, actually, I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the, uh, undead subject you've been in contact with.<eos> What undead subject?<eos> Uh, he's been writing about a post-mortem female who's killed and consumed several people.<eos> - What?<eos> - [man] Yeah.<eos> You have?<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Then where's the book?<eos> - I need the goddamn book.<eos> I don't have it, I swear.<eos> I just pretended I did.<eos> All these people want something to believe in.<eos> I'm just here to help them with that.<eos> My name's not even Anton, it's Artie.<eos> - Artie?<eos> - Yeah, Joel?<eos> I wasn't addressing you, I was digesting it.
I don't have it, I swear.<eos> I just pretended I did.<eos> All these people want something to believe in.<eos> I'm just here to help them with that.<eos> My name's not even Anton, it's Artie.<eos> - Artie?<eos> - Yeah, Joel?<eos> I wasn't addressing you, I was digesting it.<eos> Oh.<eos> If it's all made up, why is the government after you?
So, I was wrong and it won't happen again.<eos> I'm sorry, I was thinking about how handsome I am. What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> What do you think I am?<eos> I heard you.<eos> But did you really think you could get away<eos> - with stealing government documents?<eos> - What?<eos> I'm taking you in, Eric Bemis!
So she'll never be like the way she was before, ever?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Well, that's a shame.<eos> [Sheila] I know it's not exactly what you wanted to hear, but it's mostly good news.<eos> I'm not getting better but I'm not gonna get worse.<eos> It's definitely a glass-half-full situation.<eos> We're still gonna have to kill people, but I'm not gonna have to find a lovely way to kill you, which was causing tension in the relationship.<eos> It was.<eos> I left open that box of crackers you love so much just so they'd get stale.<eos> I feel like being undead has made you more vindictive.
I get straight A's in everything except science.<eos> - Are you good at taking notes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Take this down, verbatim.<eos> I'd like a turkey sandwich on whole wheat, no mayo.<eos> Then run to the Rite Aid, get me a bag of raw cashews, a bar of free-trade dark chocolate, and three postcards with the Hollywood sign on them.<eos> I have nieces.<eos> Thank you for entrusting me with this super-exciting assignment.<eos> Oh, Abby, wait.<eos> Could you get me a roast beef on... nothing, 'cause I respect you and don't want anything.
Accurate statement:<eos> I know she drinks, 'cause last time I was here she did shots at 10 a.m.<eos> And, objective truth:<eos> you don't have blood, so you don't feel alcohol, therefore you can outdrink her.<eos> So, strongly held opinion:<eos> this is what we should do, because, crossing a line, your idea is stupid.<eos> - You know, I was thinking... - [doorbell rings] ...if it comes to it, maybe I'll have my sister kill me.<eos> Kathy?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Well, it just seems like this is really stressing you out.
- [Dr. Wolf] Abby!<eos> Abby!<eos> - The toxins have reached her brain.<eos> - Uh, no. No, they haven't.<eos> - Motherfucker!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Abby?<eos> Abby, can you hear me?<eos> - Yeah, what?<eos> - I hate you so much right now.
Look, I just don't want your resentment to build up and come out in an inappropriate way.<eos> - You see the irony in that, right?<eos> All right. I am angry.<eos> I don't like killing people and stuffing them into freezers, and throwing away my Pumas I just broke in because they got brain on them.<eos> The thing that kept me going was that one day our lives would get back to normal.<eos> But now that's gone!<eos> And I don't know if I can keep doing this.<eos> But I'm gonna try.<eos> 'Cause I know I'll never do this.<eos> I'm so sorry I attacked you.
I'll always do whatever I can to make us work.<eos> - [knock on door] - [man] Sheriff's department.<eos> Shit!<eos> Novak must've called the police.<eos> Oh, God. Let's get out of here.<eos> [groans] I going to be sick.<eos> You go.<eos> We're so close.<eos> [man] Everything all right in there, ma'am?<eos> - I don't wanna leave you.
Previously on "Suits"...<eos> This isn't "Westworld."<eos> I can't make her human.<eos> I'm just asking you to give her a little compassion.
My God. Maybe I really am a genius.<eos> Yeah, maybe you are.<eos> Well, then it's a good thing I didn't throw this away.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - I've compiled a list of everybody who's invested in products like this in the last five years.<eos> That's great, but we're not gonna need this.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because the thing that makes the Donna special is me.<eos> Which means we need to look into investors who know me.<eos> Yes, correct, and nobody knows you better than Harvey.

Not gonna be a lawyer.<eos> Mike.<eos> The thing is, I was fine with it until Harvey started dangling it in front of my face.<eos> I think the problem was, I actually started believing it could happen.<eos> Do you want me to stay with you today?<eos> No.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Besides, you've got a lot of work to do and I've got a big case to win.<eos> Harvey, there you are.<eos> Louis needs to see you right away.
Well, you need to make time.<eos> Because he came looking for you last night and he's upset.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Donna. But I'm too busy to hear about another crisis with his girlfriend or drama in his canasta club or how his mouth guard doesn't fit.<eos> Couture Apparel fired us.<eos> - What?<eos> - Carly got upset that Louis brought Rachel and Katrina to the meeting instead of you.<eos> And when he stood up to her about it, she fired him.<eos> Shit.<eos> Harvey, he feels terrible about it.<eos> He thinks he let you down.
But then he'll never get into the Bar.<eos> Why do you think I said I don't have time for anything else right now?<eos> So you're telling me that asshole's holding all the cards, and Mike's never gonna be a lawyer?<eos> No, no one's ever holding all the cards.<eos> And I don't give a shit what Mike said, I'm not going folding when I know we can win.<eos> Louis, before you say anything,<eos> Donna told me what happened.<eos> - Harvey, I am so sorry...<eos> - I know you are.<eos> But I didn't come here to scold you.
So whatever it was I was gonna tell Nathan, I don't have to tell him anymore.<eos> Just like that. You're giving up your chance?<eos> Look, I heard what you said to me last night about setting an example.<eos> So instead of telling Nathan that I was up to something shady, I'm telling you that I'm not.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> I need you to get down to PSL and grab half a dozen of those associates and bring them back here.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure this thing isn't over yet.<eos> Yeah, screw those assholes, they're nothing but a bunch of dickless losers.<eos> Yeah, I'll break them into little pieces for you, you have my word on it.

What can I say, if a man doesn't have the confidence to do that, then he's not really a man.
I love you too, Mommy.<eos> - Stu.<eos> - Donna.<eos> Gotta say, I didn't figure you for a guy who called his mother "Mommy." What can I say, if a man doesn't have the confidence to do that, then he's not really a man.<eos> But I'm guessing you didn't come all the way down here just to evaluate my relationship with the greatest woman on Earth.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I came here to show you this.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's a game-changer.<eos> And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
Am I interrupting?<eos> To tell you the truth, I've just been staring at this screen for the past 15 minutes.<eos> That's what I do all day.<eos> I call it working.<eos> But I'm going to guess that's not why you're staring.<eos> I was thinking about Mike.<eos> He told you he gave up the deal?<eos> He did, and, um... he said that he's okay not being a lawyer.<eos> But the look on his face didn't say that at all.<eos> Then you might be interested in what I have to say.
Now, you gonna go back to staring at that thing or you want to help me get Mike into the Bar and have some fun at the same time?<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> I need you to go home, put on something a hell of a lot nicer, and meet me at this address in an hour.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> I'll be done in a few minutes.<eos> - How's your day?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Louis, we talked about this.<eos> You can share your day with me.<eos> I'm here to cheer you up. It's not that.
Were you ever gonna God damn tell me?<eos> - Don't speak to me like that.<eos> - You went behind my back when you knew how I felt about this.<eos> No, I went behind your back because I knew how you felt about it.<eos> Is that supposed to make it okay?<eos> No, look, I was the one that didn't want to let things get too risky, but when Harvey laid it out for me, I decided that it wasn't.<eos> Then why didn't you come to me first?<eos> Because you're the one that says forgiveness is easier to ask for than permission.<eos> That's a bullshit reason.<eos> Then how about focusing on the fact that I did it for you?
Rachel, I was upset.<eos> It had just happened.<eos> No, Mike, that's just it.<eos> It hadn't.<eos> You've been living with this for so long, that's why you gave Harvey the go-ahead to begin with.<eos> I did that because I had to watch Oliver fail and there's nothing I could do about it.<eos> And if it wasn't Oliver, it was going to be someone else.<eos> Or something else.<eos> There's always gonna be some reminder that you weren't a lawyer.<eos> And it would eat away at you, because it's what you're meant to be.
And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react. No, I don't.<eos> I still haven't even told her<eos> I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner. - Louis...<eos> - Rachel, when Sheila found out, she said I wasn't her soul mate anymore.<eos> But that was Sheila, Louis.<eos> And the key phrase is "she found out."<eos> You didn't tell her.<eos> So you were okay when Mike told you?
Mike, I'm not trying to be an asshole, but we went to a lot of trouble to get that shit on Palmer and you looked like you wanted to kill me.<eos> So how do I know you're not gonna wanna change your mind?<eos> 'Cause I wanna be a lawyer.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Take out your wallet, pay for this coffee, and let's bring this thing home.<eos> Well, that was the most amazing 27 minutes of my entire life.<eos> Which part?<eos> When you sat there with your mouth glued shut or when you shit the bed describing the operating system?<eos> My God, I knew I should have stopped after the design specs.<eos> Benjamin, I'm teasing you.
But, in fact, we killed it. You're damn right, we did.<eos> Now get going, I'm gonna see you back at the firm.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I accidentally forgot my pen in the conference room. I have one you can borrow.<eos> Benjamin, when I say accidentally,<eos> I mean intentionally because it gives me an excuse to go back in there and eavesdrop on what they're saying about us. That's a great idea.<eos> Can I come with you?<eos> - No, I need to do this alone.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because when they see me without you, they're gonna think it's two against one and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.
Because when they see me without you, they're gonna think it's two against one and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.<eos> Wait, you actually think they would do that? Of course they will.<eos> These guys are vultures.<eos> Well, then shouldn't I go with you so we can stop it?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Then trust when they make me the offer, I'm gonna act outraged, tell them we'll never do business with them, and they'll give us an extra 5% right there.<eos> - So what'd you think?<eos> - I thought it was impressive.<eos> Then I think you're easily impressed.
I mean... they don't want to make us an offer.<eos> In fact, they don't want anything to do with the Donna.<eos> - It's my fault, isn't it? - Benjamin...<eos> You don't have to protect my feelings.<eos> A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and I know that's what I am.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> It turns out I am.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You have designed an incredible product.<eos> And I don't want to hold you back.
You just told me you found out you were working with a criminal and you turned it into a promotion.<eos> I know that, but you said we should get to know each other. What do you want me to say, Louis?<eos> I didn't know what your favorite movie was.<eos> Or what side of the bed you like.<eos> But I thought at least I knew what kind of man you were.<eos> Tara, please.<eos> This is the thing I'm most ashamed about in my life and I'm telling you to show you that I'm never gonna hide anything from you.<eos> Well, maybe you should hide some things from me. What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> I heard you.

What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> I heard you.<eos> How dare you say that to me after what I had to find out about you.
And now you're looking at me like I'm a monster!<eos> You know what?<eos> That's it.<eos> Well, where are you going? I'm sleeping at my place tonight.<eos> Look, Tara, please.<eos> If I knew that you were gonna react this way, I never would have told you any of this.<eos> But you did tell me, Louis.<eos> Good night.<eos> Tara, wait.<eos> I'll give you a call when I've had a chance to figure things out.
I don't just want you to set that hearing.<eos> I want you to bulldoze anyone who stands in my way.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Don't worry. You're not late for work.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I could use this.<eos> I got in pretty late last night.<eos> Does that have anything to do with the flowers I just found in the kitchen?<eos> Can't a guy just buy you flowers 'cause he loves you?
This could really happen.<eos> I know.<eos> What is it?<eos> I promised Oliver that I would tell Nathan about the whole thing.<eos> - Mike, you can't do that.<eos> - I know I can't.<eos> But I gotta get a couple days off for the hearing, which means I gotta tell him something.<eos> Louis, what are you doing here?<eos> I hope you don't mind I stopped by.<eos> I had to see you.
Well, in that case, Nathan, I've been working here seven days a week since I started, and I've got some personal stuff that I need to... Stop right there.<eos> Look.<eos> You just bought me 30 days rent.<eos> The least I can do is give you a few days back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay, let's hear it. - Hear what?<eos> The joke you spent all morning coming up with.<eos> What joke?<eos> I was just gonna ask you where the law library was, but then I realized you've never set foot in there.
And you are never getting my vote.<eos> Rachel, whatever you're doing, you need to put it down and start looking for every single instance where a person was admitted to the Bar and the vote wasn't unanimous.<eos> Mike, what's going on?<eos> Anita Gibbs got herself onto the board.<eos> Then what we should be doing is finding a way to get her kicked off.<eos> Harvey's working on it. But in the meantime, I need to know the ins and outs of this committee, because while she's on it, she's gonna use every dirty trick in the book to end this thing before it gets started.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go hole myself up in the library and start preparing answers to every dirty question<eos> Louis, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine, Donna. What can I do for you?
Unless Benjamin can get you below 30...<eos> He can't.<eos> But Stu says we can negotiate with whoever holds the patent, get them to give us an exclusion, and we'll still be able to move forward with The Donna.<eos> Donna, this is exactly what I need.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Tara and I got into a huge fight.<eos> She's deciding right now if we're gonna stay together.<eos> This is exactly what I needed to take my mind off it.<eos> Louis, I don't mean to sound insensitive, but this is incredibly important to me.<eos> I know you, and if this is gonna make you go in there and blow this thing up, I can't have that.
Oliver.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Is it still on?<eos> - Is what still on?<eos> - Your deal.<eos> To get into the Bar.<eos> Oliver, listen to me.<eos> Because when I asked Nathan where you were, he said you were taking a couple days for personal reasons.<eos> And all of a sudden, I got this pit in my stomach that wouldn't go away.<eos> So I decided to ask you if there's a reason I got that pit or if I'm just an asshole for doubting you.
So I decided to ask you if there's a reason I got that pit or if I'm just an asshole for doubting you.<eos> You're not an asshole, Oliver.<eos> God damn it, Mike!<eos> You told me you didn't have to tell Nathan because there was nothing to tell.<eos> And when I told you that, there wasn't.<eos> But then my deal got put back on the table.<eos> Which means you could have told him this morning.<eos> But you didn't, so now I have to.<eos> Please, hear me out!<eos> I'm not gonna hear you out, Mike.
I want to help the clinic.<eos> And the reason I didn't tell Nathan what I did is because I'm just waiting until I can help him even more. Help how?<eos> By being a shady lawyer?<eos> By being someone who wouldn't have lost Sofia Price her home.<eos> I cannot believe you just said that to me.<eos> I said it because it's true, and you know it.<eos> Look, I am gonna tell Nathan everything as soon as my hearing is over. You have my word.<eos> Why should I believe the word of a liar?<eos> Because of what I did for those miners and the clinic.<eos> And if that's not enough, how about what I did for you?
Article 4, 16A.<eos> Applicants are allowed a witness as a rebuttal for an accusation leveled by a committee member.<eos> That article hasn't been cited in 30 years.<eos> Maybe that's because no applicant has ever had to stand before the person who put them away.<eos> You make a point.<eos> We'll pick this up first thing in the morning with your witness. Thank you.<eos> Rachel, that was exactly what I needed.<eos> If you hadn't done that...<eos> I know.<eos> But right now I'm more concerned with the fact that she's turning them against you.
What's going on?<eos> Gretchen said you wanted to talk to me about the patent.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> I went back to them, Donna.<eos> And the reason I asked Stu and Benjamin to be here was so that you'd know I didn't shit the bed.<eos> Are you telling me you couldn't get them to back off the lawsuit?<eos> He's telling you we won't be able to patent The Donna at all. - What?<eos> - Donna.<eos> They weren't authorized to let us partner with them.<eos> That's what I sent you over there to take care of.
So I pulled out every trick in the book.<eos> And I got them to make you an offer.<eos> An offer sounds like a buyout.<eos> That's because it is a buyout.<eos> With a special provision that allows us to produce The Donna for in-house use.<eos> That's not good enough.<eos> Donna, we're talking about a lot of money.<eos> I don't care about the money, Stu.<eos> I care that Louis didn't fight for me.<eos> I did fight for you, Donna, I swear.
They got us dead to rights.<eos> There's nothing more I can do.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Louis Litt does not roll over for anybody.<eos> He didn't roll over, Donna.<eos> I went over it with Benjamin, and we can't get the overlap under 30%.<eos> I also ran it by my own attorney and he was shocked at what Louis was able to get us.<eos> So you're telling me you want to take it?<eos> We do.<eos> But The Donna wouldn't even exist without you, and we're partners, so if you don't want to, then we won't.
You're both here.<eos> Thanks for staying.<eos> Of course we stayed. Your message said it was urgent.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is there a problem with the settlement?<eos> - Truth about what?<eos> - I made a deal.<eos> A quid pro quo that we would handle the miners' case in exchange for the chance to be admitted to the Bar.<eos> Are you goddamn kidding me?<eos> I asked you point blank if something was going on, and you lied to my face?
I mean Gibbs offered me a deal.<eos> Mike goes on record admitting I knew he was a fraud, she'll vote to let him in the Bar.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You do that, it won't be a little time off.<eos> You'll get disbarred.<eos> And by then, he'll be a lawyer.<eos> And we can argue that he said that just to appease Gibbs. Bullshit.<eos> You do this, two out of three names on that wall will be gone, and I won't be able to keep this firm going.<eos> And if you can't, we'll have done it for Mike.<eos> Zane will hire you.
I want to do what we said we were gonna do and rebuild this place together.<eos> Well, what about what you owe me?<eos> You said we were partners.<eos> We are partners.<eos> Which is why I came to you with this.<eos> No, you didn't come to ask my permission.<eos> You came to tell me that you were gonna do this.<eos> And what if I did?<eos> Then you're not just an asshole.<eos> You're an idiot, because there's no way Mike Ross ever agrees to trading you for him.
You don't even know what it is.<eos> I don't care what it is.<eos> I'm not getting into the Bar if it means getting you kicked out.<eos> Mike, she wants me.<eos> She always has. No, Harvey.<eos> She wants both of us.<eos> And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> And if you don't get that, then she's got you right where she wants you.
I told her.<eos> We got into a huge fight.<eos> And she said she needed to think about whether or not she could forgive me.<eos> - And?<eos> - She just called when Harvey was giving us the news about Mike.<eos> Left a 15-second voicemail.<eos> I'm afraid to listen to it.<eos> Louis...<eos> She's either gonna tell me that she never wants to see me again or she wants to make up.<eos> Do you want me to listen for you?
But I'd like it if you stay with me while I do.<eos> Of course.<eos> What's that?<eos> I wanted to give you a present.<eos> Your first year's salary in advance.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Harvey, I'm running out of ways to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.<eos> Before you answer, you might want to take a look at this check.<eos> - You're trying to bribe me.<eos> - I'm trying to close you. - I told you...
Anyone I want to bring over from the clinic, I can.<eos> Louis doesn't get a say, you don't get a say, no Harvard rule.<eos> Done.<eos> And there's one more thing, and you're not gonna like it.<eos> You are not getting my office. Yes, I am.<eos> And I will tell you why.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> And she's not coming back.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.
I'm offering you a deal-- one for you, one for me.
I'm offering you a deal-- one for you, one for me.<eos> You are not getting my office. Oh, yes, I am 'cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.
I'm offering you a deal-- one for you, one for me.<eos> You are not getting my office. Oh, yes, I am 'cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.<eos> I'm here to ask you out.

Oh, yes, I am 'cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.<eos> I'm here to ask you out.<eos> As of this morning, I'm the head of my firm, and, when I thought of sharing that with someone, I thought of you.
Donna asked for a seat at the table, and I gave her one.<eos> You don't make her goddamn senior partner.<eos> If Jessica were here, she'd tell you to do the same exact thing.<eos> Jessica isn't here, but I am.<eos> I think I know what you may need.<eos> If you're telling me that I need to talk to Tara...<eos> You were gonna get married.<eos> That can't all end over a voicemail.<eos> I know we haven't spoken.<eos> I just really need to see you tonight.
There--you surprised me again.<eos> You know, the truth is I'm a little surprised by all this myself.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I mean, you disappear for nearly a year, and then, one day, you suddenly show up in a '57 Chevy-- '72 Ferrari, but, yeah.<eos> And you sweep me off my feet.<eos> And I liked it.<eos> That's good 'cause I wasn't sure you would.<eos> Of course you weren't.<eos> You don't really know me yet.<eos> Till yesterday, we'd spent about 50 hours together, and we'd spent most of them talking about you.

Wow.<eos> congratulations, Donna.<eos> You must be thrilled.<eos> I am.<eos> And I know what you're thinking-- how can a secretary be made a partner?<eos> But-- I wasn't thinking that, Donna.<eos> I know how hard you work and how much you mean to this firm and everyone in it.<eos> Thanks, Katrina.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I'll let you get back to work.
You mean the guy who played Superman?<eos> That was George Reeves.<eos> Arthur Reeves founded this firm.<eos> And when Gordon, Schimdt, and Van Dyke ran him out of town, they didn't just tear his name off the wall. They called his biggest client and told them to pack up their shit and find another firm.<eos> - What's your point?<eos> - My point is they wanted the world to know there was a new sheriff in town, and the message that sends isn't that you have something to prove-- it's that you're in charge.<eos> And you're staying that way.<eos> Hope you don't mind I took the liberty of hanging that.<eos> Let me guess-- it's your last official act as my secretary.<eos> I told you once before I wouldn't leave you high and dry.
It'll be our outside counsel, Mr. Ackerman.<eos> And, from what I've seen, nobody wipes the floor with Mr. Ackerman.<eos> Nice office.<eos> Mine's better.<eos> Isn't that the same line you used when you thought your Ferrari was better than my Cobra?<eos> It was better.<eos> And a good line never gets old.<eos> - Tell that to your hairline.<eos> - Tell that to your waistline.<eos> Good to see you, Harvey.

- Who do you think's bringing Pfizer over here in the first place?<eos> So then give him a corner office with a killer view because I'm not gonna do something like that for someone I barely know.<eos> Harvey--<eos> Well, I've known him for 15 years, and I'm vouching for him.<eos> I don't care if you came out of the womb with him.<eos> You don't just slap somebody's name on the wall to get a client.<eos> I'm not just slapping his name up, Louis.<eos> I'm making a move. - Harvey--<eos> - Hey, that's enough.<eos> I asked you last night if you had any problems with me calling the shots, and you said you didn't.
If that's what you want, then I would be honored to.<eos> Alex, I'm glad you called.<eos> We're still working out the paperwork--<eos> If you're still working on the paperwork, how come I just found out you're trying to poach my client?<eos> - What? - Don't bullshit me.<eos> Kevin Bauer told me that PSL called to set an appointment, and it sure as hell wasn't to tell my own client that I'm going to be name partner at your firm.<eos> God damn it.<eos> You're telling me you had nothing to do with this?<eos> That's exactly what I'm telling you.<eos> Then get your shit together and either make this thing happen or not 'cause I went out on a limb for you once before.
- Because I said so.<eos> - Harvey, can you at least talk to Mike?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> - Because I got a plane to catch.<eos> You wanted to talk to me?<eos> What gave it away?<eos> The nine texts or the 16 messages?<eos> I was on a plane.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm in your old office wondering why you even gave it to me if you're not gonna let me make simple personnel decisions.<eos> Mike, if you let this asshole bully you, you're gonna be backing down for the rest of your life.
It means you go out, you find a reporter, and you take control of the narrative.<eos> Instead of a lying fraud, you're a hero fighting for redemption.<eos> I don't have time to change my image.<eos> Look, if I lose this case, the only article that's gonna get written is that I never should have been able to practice law in the first place.<eos> Yeah, well, if you can't figure out a way to win without Rachel's help, then maybe I shouldn't have brought you back in the first place because I've had about enough of having every employee<eos> I thought we were gonna meet at the restaurant.<eos> I got down here early.<eos> Manhattan doesn't have views like this.<eos> Thanks for making the time to see me, Jessica.<eos> I will always make time to see you, Harvey.

I didn't want to end up focusing on myself like I did the last time.<eos> Why, is something going on?<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Harvey, you can talk to me about it.<eos> - But you said before--<eos> - I know what I said before, but this is different.<eos> How? Because you heard me, and you respected my wishes, which means instead of me listening to you as your therapist, you know, I'll be listening to you as your...<eos> Not therapist.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Look at that, even when we cancel, I feel like I'm getting to know you better.
Louis, it's natural for you to feel that way.<eos> You've worked hard to get where you are, and a new person threatens your position in the firm.<eos> That's not-- That's just not it.<eos> The one silver lining of Jessica leaving was that I thought that Harvey would finally turn to me, not only as his partner, but as his friend.<eos> That's not happening now because I'm being replaced.<eos> And you're scared of losing your friend.<eos> What do I do?<eos> I can't tell you that, Louis, but I can tell you it was your behavior that drove Tara away, and, if you keep letting your emotions dictate your behavior, you won't need to worry about being replaced.<eos> You'll drive Harvey away all by yourself.<eos> I'm not sure I've ever seen you here this late.
What?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I have to.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Bullshit, I-- I paid you $500,000.<eos> You haven't signed the partnership agreement yet, so I can refund your money, and--<eos> I don't want a refund.<eos> I want what we agreed to.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> You are not a lawyer, and being partner at a law firm-- it means something, inside the firm and out, which is why I wrote up a new release for you.
Well, we're celebrating, but we're not going out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> A reporter from "The Times" is gonna be here in five minutes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We are doing an interview.<eos> The redemption of a fraudulent lawyer.<eos> Well, that is the best news I've heard since finding out you got into the bar.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I think you should do it without me.<eos> Rachel, I--I couldn't have done any of this without you.
Uh, yeah, we could end up there.<eos> But I was thinking maybe we'd start out where I started out.<eos> - Where's that?<eos> - In the bullpen.<eos> What is it now, Harvey?<eos> You want to put the janitor in charge of bankruptcy?<eos> Or the guard downstairs could be head of litigation.<eos> - Are you finished?<eos> - Depends on what you say next.<eos> I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.
You were just tearing the statue down.<eos> Just like you saw me do all those years ago, and I didn't like it because the statue was me.<eos> Well, if it's the same to you, I'd like the statue to stay.<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> - There's one more thing.<eos> - There always is.<eos> I'm still bringing Alex over, only not as a name partner, but Pfizer's still insisting we drop Jim Reynolds.<eos> And you want to know if I'm okay with it?<eos> No, I'm letting him go.<eos> I'm just calling you to tell you before I tell him, like I should've done in the first place.
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> Waterford's probably sterile.<eos> Most of those guys are.<eos> If Waterford can't get you pregnant, they won't blame him.
It'll be your fault.<eos> I can help you.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> He tried to connect.<eos> That's what he needs.<eos> It has been so hard.<eos> Being alone in that room. I'm afraid I'm starting to give up.<eos> That would be a tragedy.<eos> The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans.<eos> I know this is a shock for you, Emily.

I'm afraid I'm starting to give up.<eos> That would be a tragedy.<eos> The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans.<eos> I know this is a shock for you, Emily.<eos> Things will be easier for you now.
Maybe.<eos> I'll have to be more careful.<eos> What's the fun in that?<eos> What have I learned, after 34 games?<eos> I've learned that he likes it when I flirt.<eos> And I like it when he lets me win.<eos> We're a match made in heaven.<eos> It reminds me of a poem I read once.<eos> "You fit into me like a hook into an eye" "a fish hook an open eye".<eos> I have a present for you.
Some of us retain an appreciation for the old things.<eos> I thought you might like to read it.<eos> It's not allowed.<eos> It is with me.<eos> I used to buy magazines like this at the airport.<eos> I read them when I got my hair highlighted.<eos> Now the models all look insane.<eos> Like zoo animals.<eos> Unaware they're about to go extinct.<eos> "Ten ways to tell how he feels about you."
Um, are you on Tinder?<eos> My friend's on Tinder.<eos> You on Tinder?<eos> No, I'm...<eos> No?<eos> Okay. Look, she is attracting a lot of chumps.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And I personally...<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to kill you in your sleep.
So cute.<eos> He's married.<eos> He does not act married.<eos> No, they never do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Blessed day.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to be?<eos> No.<eos> Must be nice.<eos> Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.
Under His eye.<eos> Always blessed.<eos> Did you see?<eos> She's back.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> Ofglen.<eos> Ofsteven.<eos> Right.<eos> It's so good to see you.
May the Lord open.<eos> Ofglen.<eos> Ofsteven.<eos> Right.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> We were worried.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> The Eyes took you?
Yeah.<eos> Gross.<eos> No, it could be fun.<eos> They'd have one of those vibrating beds.<eos> Think about it.<eos> We could go to the Hyatt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of those, you know, higher rooms with a view of the city at night.<eos> So, how would it work?<eos> I'd just... Come surprise you after work, or...
Please don't tell me what to do.<eos> I couldn't say no when Mrs. Waterford asked me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Okay, please?<eos> Please.<eos> Are you an Eye?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now go to bed before I report you.
Please.<eos> Are you an Eye?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now go to bed before I report you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want you to leave your wife.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> What do you mean, "Okay"?<eos> Look, I'm in love with you.
Yes.<eos> Now go to bed before I report you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want you to leave your wife.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> What do you mean, "Okay"?<eos> Look, I'm in love with you.<eos> What else am I going to do?<eos> I'm in love with you.
My Commander.<eos> Small dick, big mouth.<eos> It looks kind of weird without all the dead bodies, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you get used to things being one way.<eos> Hurry up in there.<eos> Coming.<eos> I left a clean dress for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> As soon as you're dressed, Mrs. Waterford wants to see you.
Awesome.<eos> I'll keep a good thought.<eos> Mrs. Waterford?<eos> All cleaned up?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, we have some important guests tonight, a trade delegation from Mexico.<eos> The Commander worked very hard to arrange this visit.<eos> We need to make the right impression.<eos> So, let's see you.
You look very handsome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're having dinner at the home of a very powerful Commander.<eos> Let them be nervous.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> How's your day going?<eos> You look pretty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wore it just for you.
You shouldn't wear anything for me.<eos> Nick?<eos> Bring her in.<eos> Deputy Ambassador Castillo, puedo presentar our Handmaid, Offred.<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> No, Mrs. Castillo is the Ambassador.<eos> Mr. Flores is her assistant.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No apologies are necessary.<eos> It is a pleasure to meet you.
Handmaids are having children for the entire nation.<eos> Offred knows how grateful we are for her choice in this.<eos> Come.<eos> Sir.<eos> Pardon the interruption.<eos> Ambassador, gentlemen, please join us for some hors d'oeuvres.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> Shall we make our way, then?<eos> Please, after you.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, Offred.
Things have to change.<eos> I know.<eos> There's still going to be a lot of pain.<eos> There's pain now.<eos> So much of it.<eos> We're saving them.<eos> We're doing God's work.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> He, uh... He wants to see you in his office.
It only makes it worse.<eos> Did you see the way she looked at us?<eos> Like we were fucking freaks.<eos> Who are they to judge us?<eos> Half their population is malnourished.<eos> They've had four elections in three years.<eos> What are they doing to save the planet? Hmm?<eos> Not a single thing.<eos> Can't they see the good work we're doing here?<eos> Am I boring you?
Cross my heart.<eos> And hope to die?<eos> Hope to die.<eos> All right, girls.<eos> Two lines!<eos> Best behavior!<eos> Praised be.<eos> It's like a dream.<eos> I think I went to a Bat Mitzvah here once.<eos> They won't let you speak.
It is my honor to present to you the children of Gilead.<eos> All brought forth in this district by our Handmaids.<eos> Now, let's go and say hello to the head table.<eos> Looks like Waterford's gonna get his trade deal.<eos> What did they talk about last night?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You didn't hear anything?<eos> Schedules, dates?<eos> Why do you care so much?
Talk to me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Offred.<eos> If they find us here.<eos> If they find us...<eos> Offred. If they find us together, I'm gonna get sent to the colonies.<eos> You're an Eye.<eos> You're untouchable.<eos> It's... That's not true.<eos> Fuck you, Nick.
Hey.<eos> Offred.<eos> If they find us here.<eos> If they find us...<eos> Offred. If they find us together, I'm gonna get sent to the colonies.<eos> You're an Eye.<eos> You're untouchable.<eos> It's... That's not true.<eos> Fuck you, Nick.<eos> Fuck you!
Offred.<eos> If they find us here.<eos> If they find us...<eos> Offred. If they find us together, I'm gonna get sent to the colonies.<eos> You're an Eye.<eos> You're untouchable.<eos> It's... That's not true.<eos> Fuck you, Nick.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> They don't rape you, do they?
They don't rape you, do they?<eos> He doesn't come in here once a month and read you a little scripture and stick his cock up your ass?<eos> I said I was happy!<eos> Offred.<eos> Don't call me that!<eos> It is not my name.<eos> Can I get you a glass of water?<eos> It's June.<eos> My name. It's June.<eos> It's nice to meet you, June.
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> We have some important guests tonight.<eos> Deputy Ambassador, Castillo, puedo presentar our Handmaid, Offred.<eos> It is a pleasure to meet you.
Lucas Bankole.<eos> He's alive.<eos> Please, write something.<eos> I'll try to get it to him.<eos> Are you okay? Is she all right?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here, come here, honey.<eos> Let Mommy check you.
Believe you, me, he owes me a fuckin' favor.<eos> Won't be much longer.<eos> Welcome to your little slice of heaven.<eos> As long as this slice of heaven has a shower.<eos> You got her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey come on, Hannah Banana.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look at you, you're tired.
They shot me.<eos> And then they took my wife and they took my daughter.<eos> I'm just trying to get back to them.<eos> I took the jacket to stay warm.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Let me look at that wound.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're going to bleed to death.<eos> Fuck you.
- Shit.<eos> - It's not his jacket.<eos> I topped off the tank and we got some ammo but there are patrols on the highway.<eos> We should move on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Help me with him.<eos> Grab what you can.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> You know at some point, you're gonna have to stop collecting strays.<eos> I should've stopped before I found you.
We gotta go.<eos> You know at some point, you're gonna have to stop collecting strays.<eos> I should've stopped before I found you.<eos> You got him?<eos> We got another one.<eos> Guardians shot him.<eos> Clear a spot.<eos> We need to lay him down.<eos> Don't worry, friend.<eos> We'll fix you up.
You sure you don't want more?<eos> Yeah, I want more.<eos> I think that's fine. Ooh!<eos> Look at that method.<eos> Very nice, I wonder who taught you that?<eos> Nobody taught me it.<eos> I just...<eos> You just came up with it?<eos> Interesting.<eos> I'm watching you.
Come here. Hey.<eos> Sit.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see anybody out here.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> It's quiet out here?<eos> Hi there, I'm Joe.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> It's pretty cold out, isn't it?<eos> It is. We should probably get inside?<eos> Yeah. Look at you.
I wasn't expecting to see anybody out here.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> It's quiet out here?<eos> Hi there, I'm Joe.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> It's pretty cold out, isn't it?<eos> It is. We should probably get inside?<eos> Yeah. Look at you.<eos> You're all cold.<eos> We better get you in.
It's all right.<eos> Look, they're patrolling all over.<eos> You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.<eos> I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No worries.<eos> This is pretty fucked up.<eos> Come on.<eos> May the Lord guide your steps and bring you to your June and your Hannah.
They can help you find them, maybe even get them out.<eos> No.<eos> No. I'm not...<eos> If you go back, you're gonna die.<eos> You're gonna die and leave them all on their own.<eos> Is that what you want? I don't...<eos> I don't...<eos> He's coming.<eos> Smart.<eos> I wasted a whole prayer on you.
I think they only had a few seconds.<eos> When?<eos> Three weeks ago.<eos> So, she's alive?<eos> We believe so, yes.<eos> Sorry...<eos> Sorry. Can I have a moment?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I love you
Fuck.<eos> This one's called "A Good Night's Sleep."<eos> Now, my songs are a little, I guess, a little brighter.<eos> Not to say that they're more intelligent, but they... they let a little light get in there.<eos> Cool.<eos> Yours don't really.<eos> Well...<eos> Let me ask you a question.
What, did I get the chord wrong?<eos> No. Perfect on the chords.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Um, the... there's joy in this song.<eos> Joy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm... I'm not really feeling your joy.<eos> I'm not really feeling joy.<eos> Well, what's getting you down?
I was thinking. But that's why we brought Stephen.<eos> That's his area of concentration.<eos> Yeah. Let's throw that to John.<eos> Lacking a little sex appeal here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Archduke Sebastian Room.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> John.<eos> John. Ooh, I just want to hug you.
Rob.<eos> John, it's happening.<eos> What is?<eos> My life.<eos> Starting now.<eos> Let's catch up later. We'll catch up.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I got something I got to do now. W...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got you, scumbag.
You enjoying Luxembourg?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For the most part, yeah.<eos> It's good food.<eos> How am I going to talk to these guys?<eos> I speak Portuguese.<eos> I could translate.<eos> Brazil has the fourth largest transport field in the world.<eos> It's my primary field. I could do it.<eos> I don't want them to see you.
- Yeah.<eos> You came all the way to Luxembourg to see if I'm all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, here's what we're going to do.<eos> First thing, you're gonna get some sleep.<eos> Then you're gonna eat.<eos> And then we're gonna have some fun.<eos> You pick the fun.<eos> Can I come?<eos> Well, it wouldn't be much fun without you, Eddie.
They blamed the aging Gerald and believed their king had gone soft in his advanced years.<eos> I want to know what you're facing, all of it.<eos> I need to know you're okay.<eos> So don't hold back.<eos> Spill it, kid.<eos> The detective asked to interview me about the thing.<eos> The killing?<eos> The killing.<eos> Of a man who was trying to choke you to death.<eos> Of a man who was trying to kill you.
A photo of me under another name. Yeah.<eos> She has it somewhere.<eos> She's going to interview me.<eos> Then if she looks at that thing...<eos> Why would you take that picture?<eos> This thing with the guy, it was making me, I don't know, happy.<eos> I didn't think.<eos> I was in the... afternoon spray, I guess.<eos> What? In the what?<eos> That's just when you're... you're feeling good... you don't really know what else is going on around you so much.
And I don't know for the other one.<eos> I'll select Tangled.<eos> Can we arrange for an employee to do that now before I arrive in the room?<eos> I would only like to see that film on the television.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> Who was your hallway pal?<eos> A stranger whose laptop I found in the bar and then I gave it back to him and then he was grateful.<eos> I'll say.<eos> My God.<eos> You know, I can't believe I found you.
And then, at the same time, I'm saying "It split all..."<eos> Excuse...<eos> Wow, man! I'm glad you made it.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We should hit them with, "Afternoon Spray."<eos> All right? I... I was, like, lost.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay? "Afternoon Spray."<eos> Okay. Here we go.<eos> We love you, Rob!
Save me a seat.<eos> Honey, I know it's a busy day, but if things settle down a bit later, could you maybe run me out to a shop to get a couple of those nice Irish wool sweaters they have here?<eos> You know, the big, thick, fisherman ones.<eos> - You know the ones I mean?<eos> - My dad's dead.<eos> Why am I not more upset?<eos> - You are upset.<eos> - Not enough.<eos> When you found out that kid you went to summer camp with died, you barely got out of bed.<eos> I had to slap you around.
Why am I not more upset?<eos> - You are upset.<eos> - Not enough.<eos> When you found out that kid you went to summer camp with died, you barely got out of bed.<eos> I had to slap you around.<eos> This is my dad.<eos> It isn't some kid you showed your dick to once.<eos> I spent my summers with him.<eos> Yeah, two summers.<eos> You cried until you threw up.
Hitting the order button and getting the buzz, like a junkie.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Just for letting me lay into your mother.<eos> I like a lot of things about you, but that is up there. That is near the top.<eos> Well, the things I hate about her are set in stone.<eos> So what you say, I listen to, but that's never going to be as bad as what I know about her.<eos> Well, thank you anyway.<eos> - We're OK, aren't we?<eos> - Yeah, what do you mean?<eos> I don't know, it's just been a tough year so far and... you're so great about the, you know, all the shit with me and
- Yeah, what do you mean?<eos> I don't know, it's just been a tough year so far and... you're so great about the, you know, all the shit with me and<eos> - that...<eos> You know.<eos> - Yeah. And you going back to Braeband when I know you hate it there, but you're doing it for us.<eos> I just... I think you're a really good person.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> You're a good husband and a good dad and for a little while, after you shower, you even smell good.<eos> I love you.
you know, make love to it.<eos> OK. Tell her I'm on my way.<eos> OK.<eos> Oh, no, wait - she looks like she's headed into a Nando's.<eos> It was brilliant, I cried a lot and then I threw up on the window of a Pret.<eos> - Well, that's great, honey.<eos> - I know. I cried for, like, an hour.<eos> I think I was worried because I... I've never lost anyone I really loved before.<eos> Don't ever leave me.<eos> I won't. Because I'm never going to leave you.

Is it important to have a gym in the building?<eos> How about cement floors, no windows and a view of a toilet?<eos> Because that will be home if Von Barlow tells her boyfriend what she heard.<eos> What's her real name again?<eos> Oh, my God. I don't... I don't know.<eos> Linda... something.<eos> I guess. Linda.<eos> Linda, who has "Solsbury Hill" on every single one of her Spotify playlists.<eos> Her heart is going boom-boom-boom.<eos> She could end you.
She's strong.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> We gotta use empowering words.<eos> Not cute and princess.<eos> She's strong and beautiful, and smart, just like her mother.<eos> My pretty princess wife.<eos> Masha-Allah.<eos> Can we get back to the discussion, please?<eos> Babe, if you're so overwhelmed with work and Farah, why don't we just hire a nanny?<eos> Because there's also you.
I don't know why this seems like such a big deal for you.<eos> Most of our friends have done it.<eos> Your dad has three wives.<eos> It wasn't always peace in the valley at our house.<eos> Plus, he's 63 years old, and manscapes.<eos> Not really one to model a life after.<eos> How about this?<eos> Let's be open to it?<eos> If the right person comes along, then we'll talk more.<eos> And frankly, a little trimming wouldn't kill you.
Ugh. This is killing me!<eos> Look at that snaggley smile.<eos> That's my guy.<eos> Teeth. Wow.<eos> All the Hardings got it.<eos> Snaggle's loud and proud.<eos> This is insane.<eos> You really need to attach me to a plank?<eos> You're a flight risk.<eos> If you try to run, this'll slow you down.
We're about to begin the séance.<eos> I'm sorry, the what?<eos> We are summoning Poussey's spirit.<eos> You know, making sure there's no unfinished business.<eos> Well, of course there's unfinished business.<eos> She didn't get to live her life.<eos> We... we just wanna offer her some peace.<eos> Well, y'all have fun with y'all pretend time.<eos> Here, Suzanne.<eos> I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.
This is some bullshit. Ooh.<eos> Actually, I'm kinda loving this.<eos> I mean, you wanna walk away from some free entertainment?<eos> Scoot over.<eos> I ain't taking off my shoes.<eos> Oh, we just need them in the circle.<eos> Come on, Taystee.<eos> Everyone, please... join hands.<eos> Everyone, please... join hands!<eos> Mighty spirit... we are ready to receive you.
- We want her.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, see, the thing is, we need one of those, like, just-edging-outta-cool, needs-to-pay-the-mortgage types who can say useful things, but with a tinge of sadness.<eos> I'm the tell-it-like-it-is judge.<eos> But I thought I was tell-it-like-it-is and you were gonna be, like, comforting and supportive.<eos> Are you fucking serious right now?<eos> Yeah, I guess that's a stretch.<eos> I can be supportive when I have to be.<eos> Yeah, the thing is, we were thinking that you could be the stage manager.
I have Morton's neuroma.<eos> Yeah, well, I probably have Wolfgang Puck's herpes, but I don't go around announcing it.<eos> Did you think you were being the cool girl or something?<eos> Don't you know the cool girl always ends up alone or fat?<eos> Or both in my cousin April's case.<eos> I thought it'd be like one of those open-minded relationships, you know?<eos> I think you mean open relationship.<eos> They can be quite wonderful...<eos> Don't correct her!<eos> Who asked you anyway?
There are no accidents.<eos> You're right.<eos> Everything is a choice.<eos> Come on!<eos> Remember, you must keep the circle unbroken.<eos> Whatever you do, do not break the circle.<eos> Hold up.<eos> What if we gotta pee?<eos> Do not break the circle.<eos> Poussey... we welcome you to this room.
Come on!<eos> Remember, you must keep the circle unbroken.<eos> Whatever you do, do not break the circle.<eos> Hold up.<eos> What if we gotta pee?<eos> Do not break the circle.<eos> Poussey... we welcome you to this room.<eos> As we sit here... we make this a place of welcoming.<eos> Everyone, tell Poussey we welcome her.<eos> We welcome you, Poussey.
"You've got another love, and I know it..."<eos> You're taking too damn long.<eos> "She'll cry and wonder.<eos> What went wrong?"<eos> See?<eos> Maya Angelou.<eos> I am crying and wondering what went wrong.<eos> We're all doin' that.<eos> You really think P would bother to have us look that shit up in a book?<eos> She says... she misses you.
The tension is real.<eos> The pressure is...<eos> Okay! That's like three intros already.<eos> Can we get on with it?<eos> All right.<eos> Ladies and, well, lady boys, please welcome to the stage our first contestant, CO Dixon.<eos> Whenever you're ready, Lee.<eos> ♪ Say money but it won't take you too far Take you too far ♪ Okay.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> ♪ To take what's given you... ♪ Now, I thought you were a little pitchy in the early verses, but you recovered nicely.
Ladies. All right.<eos> Ladies, all right.<eos> How're we doing? You guys good?<eos> You guys good?<eos> I've seen a lot of you out there taking pictures of yourselves with your newly-found phones.<eos> Takin' selfies.<eos> Or as they're called in prison, cell-fies.<eos> Wow. How many of y'all bitches like eating pussy?<eos> Ha-ha-ha! I mean, I don't know.<eos> I thought you were a little bit too Jay Leno or something.
Like a puppy that won't stop following me around.<eos> Von Barlow, you got a sec?<eos> All right, commercial break.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> I'm a little busy.<eos> What do you want? Look, I need to be sure that somebody keeps their mouth shut about a certain something that they overheard about somebody else in the bathroom.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.<eos> I gotta go weigh in.<eos> Look, do you hear what I'm telling you?<eos> I have information on you, too, you know.
I gotta go judge.<eos> Not you... something else, okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> Yo, why that judge look so familiar?<eos> 'Cause she's famous.<eos> That's the counterfeit cunt from Connecticut right there.<eos> Is this where you go when you want nothing to do with that shit?<eos> Who's in charge out here?<eos> She is.<eos> Oh, yeah. I recognize you from the chapel.
I'm so grateful.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me with this, Little?<eos> Of course it didn't fly at Liquor Barn.<eos> Yolanda fucking Ono?<eos> It says here you weigh 180.<eos> Any idiot knows Alpha Zeta Delta won't even consider potentials above 135.<eos> Now I have to go and get all six kegs myself?<eos> I'm so sorry, Meggs.<eos> I totally let you down.
I think you mean "Ree-see's Pee-see's."<eos> What's a Pee-see?<eos> And Bayley, obviously.<eos> Fry him up, too.<eos> Also, we have to get everyone's demands to make it count.<eos> And why we gotta include everyone?<eos> P was our girl.<eos> Yeah, but this ain't only our riot.<eos> Worst thing you can do is take another woman's voice when she's finally found it.<eos> Even if she's drivin' you crazy, messin' up your house, sleepin' in your bed, even.
Why don't you go stir the pot?<eos> 'Cause you're good at that.<eos> We'll alternate between intercostal and diaphragmatic breathing.<eos> Take a deep inhale and we'll hold it for a count of ten.<eos> One, two...<eos> Clearly, it's working great.<eos> Think of this as nature's CPAP machine.<eos> Now when you inhale, make sure to contract your lower abs and squeeze your Kegels.<eos> New one from Reg.<eos> "Concerned about you.
Pleasure to meet you.<eos> I'm the Counterfeit Cunt of Connecticut.<eos> You mean, you're not a real cunt?<eos> So that means you can make fake shit?<eos> Birth certificates, driver's licenses...<eos> My specialty's a ten dollar bill but, you know, they go Tubman on me, I might be screwed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the fuck is that, huh?<eos> How about Cesar Chavez or Che?<eos> You know, I know I don't know you very well, but... you seem like the type of woman who appreciates honesty.
Yes, sirs.<eos> I'm a bad man.<eos> Did... did bad things.<eos> You know, like I...<eos> I told you. Mr. Caputo says it... it makes a monster.<eos> Harold, do you have any idea what this kid's trying to confess?<eos> Probably another one of these poor fuckers with PTSD, wanting penance for Iraq.<eos> Or he's been sniffing bath salts all night.<eos> Look at his hands.<eos> Listen, pal, we're gonna let you sleep it off, and then we can talk about all the bad stuff you say you did... tomorrow.
Here we are, Baudelaires.<eos> Deemo...<eos> - But you would be dead wrong.<eos> - Dimmo...<eos> - My name is Lemony Snicket.<eos> - Dudy Damo... - It's my sad duty... - Democlay... to tell the tale of the Baudelaires' tragic lives.<eos> Dimoclath...<eos> But you likely have no such responsibilities... - Dimoclat... - And should escape from this sad story...<eos> - Demcaca... - before another storm of melancholy<eos> - engulfs you in dampness and misery.
[grunting] And what is the next step, boss?<eos> Brute force?<eos> No, no. I need something worthy of this grandiose locale.<eos> Something dashing, something romantic.<eos> You know, in many ways, I am married to the sea.<eos> This is actually a large lake.<eos> [Olaf] I am married to the sea, but my girlfriend is a large lake.<eos> - Land ho! - I told you to stop calling me that.<eos> [taxi driver] I'd say to him, "Lay off the big white whale for a few days.<eos> See how you feel. Take a vacation.
[door opens]<eos> I'm sure you know there are two kinds of fears: rational and irrational.<eos> Or, in simpler terms, fears that make sense and fears that don't.<eos> For instance, the Baudelaire orphans had a fear of Count Olaf, which makes perfect sense because he is an evil man who wants to destroy them.<eos> But if they were afraid of lemon meringue pie, that would be an irrational fear because lemon meringue pie is delicious and has never hurt a soul.<eos> Being afraid of hurricanes is perfectly rational because they can be quite sinister and destructive.<eos> But a fear of real estate agents, a term which here means "people who assist in the buying and selling of houses," would be an irrational fear because nothing sinister has ever come from the real estate market.<eos> [whistling]<eos> Count Olaf.<eos> I didn't think I'd see you again after all that unpleasantness with Mr. Snicket.
The Baudelaires are safe and sound and learning everything they need to know - about our secret organization.<eos> - Oh? They should've begun their training years ago, but it's not too late.<eos> [grunts] Rats!<eos> Their new guardian is the most fierce and formidable member of our organization.<eos> Wait, not Snicket?<eos> What?<eos> No. Isn't he dead?<eos> Is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you.
It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you.<eos> - Oh? The Baudelaire children will be destroyed,<eos> - and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats! You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.<eos> That's what I'm saying. You can push me around all you want...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - But Josephine will stop you. The children will stop you.
- Terrifyingly frightening?<eos> I won't be long, children!<eos> Don't do anything dangerous!<eos> You know, anything I wouldn't do!<eos> - Of course not!<eos> - Nothing you wouldn't do!<eos> I know you don't care for the sound, but maybe I could use your rattle to invent a burglar alarm so Aunt Josephine won't have to rely on piles of cans.<eos> And, Sunny, you can have the deck of cards.<eos> You enjoy playing poker more than I do.<eos> - That leaves you with the doll.
Just trying to keep it spicy, babe.<eos> You know, I'm pretty sure that penguins don't live in igloos.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> Where's that, now, at a zoo?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Hey, we're almost there, little man.<eos> Are you excited?<eos> I want to go home. Yeah, I hear that, but, uh, I'm afraid that's not an option right now, okay?<eos> But we're gonna find you and your family a new home.
Seven years.<eos> Not just since I've seen you guys.<eos> Since I've seen a baby.<eos> I used to be obsessed with them.<eos> I had, like, three dolls that I took everywhere.<eos> Kids still do that?<eos> Companies even make dolls anymore?<eos> Um, Isaac's more of a dinosaur kid.<eos> You guys are good parents.<eos> Clementine, I'm sorry I didn't recognize you earlier.
Did you win?<eos> Of course I didn't.<eos> But after that, I was the kid who knew stuff.<eos> So... I just kept going.<eos> It's time.<eos> Jamie?<eos> I can't move.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I'm gonna find you.

Out of the way, now!<eos> Get all friendlies inside the gate!<eos> - Friendlies are in.<eos> - Shut the gate!<eos> - I've got a clean shot.<eos> - Do not shoot.<eos> I repeat, do not shoot.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get the door.<eos> Spicy enough for you?
I've made some advancements, not breakthroughs.<eos> Anyway, that's irrelevant.<eos> These are the breakthroughs that matter now.<eos> So, this is the facility he's being held in.<eos> It's been abandoned for years, but this shows continuous electricity usage in the eastern wing.<eos> That must be where he is.<eos> How did you get all this?<eos> She stole it from the IADG.<eos> Why would you not just tell them you are Mitch's daughter?<eos> I'm sure they would welcome you on the mission.
We've gotten reports of a break-in near Columbus Park.<eos> Stolen property.<eos> Suspect matches your description.<eos> Huh. The mayor might disagree.<eos> I was just at a party with him discussing the new renovations to the museum.<eos> Donated a wing.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Guys, I can take it from here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I warned you, Jamie.
- Great. I'm sure the NYPD would love to know they're working with a criminal.<eos> Jamie.<eos> I care about you.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.<eos> But I can't sit back and watch you fall into darkness.<eos> Not anymore I can't.<eos> Do you know what I had to do to get that?<eos> It's over.<eos> Tell the NYPD whatever you want, but if I catch you again, I will bring you in.
What does that mean?<eos> This isn't working.<eos> Abe.<eos> Hey, I got your message.<eos> Um... No, it's me, Clem.<eos> Abe said you weren't returning his calls.<eos> Why?<eos> Clem, I... Uh, it's a long story.<eos> Whatever happened between you guys, it doesn't matter, okay?<eos> My father's alive and he needs you, Jamie.

I'm on my way.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> Abraham, I'm sorry.<eos> You were going to sneak off without us.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You and Dariela have a home here.<eos> You have Isaac.<eos> He needs you more than I do.<eos> I can't let you go alone.
We'll be wheels up in five.<eos> _<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you sure that you don't need anything?<eos> Food or-or water?<eos> Water, you've... you've had enough water for a lifetime.<eos> I'm sure that you have questions.<eos> I...<eos> I had a lot, too.<eos> When they first told me they found you, I couldn't believe it.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> You're not gonna go crazy on me, are you?<eos> Probably.<eos> I'm shutting you down, Roulette.

So that, one day, if you are so inclined you can make a difference.
Winn, you okay?<eos> - Jewel thieves?<eos> - Nabbed. I nabbed them.<eos> But, of course, Guardian had to show up and pick up some of the stragglers.<eos> That guy is really starting to get on my nerves. But he did help.<eos> - That's something...<eos> - Yeah, barely.<eos> I was the one who had to dodge the surface-to-air missiles.<eos> All he did was slap cuffs on wrists.<eos> Okay, what's bothering you?
- Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I will have that info for you very shortly.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - What?<eos> - Look at you.<eos> - What? - Are you kidding?<eos> You look like you've been shot with a love ray.
We surrender.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I got it.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Okay, yes.<eos> At least we got them right where we want them.<eos> Izzy?<eos> Are you Izzy Williams?<eos> Supergirl, you... you know who I am?<eos> Your mother is looking for you.
I want your hands at the controls. No, no.<eos> Agent Schott, she wasn't asking you.<eos> - That's an order.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> Winn.<eos> I'm not gonna be of any help to you out there. I mean...<eos> Okay fine, this, I wasn't mugged.<eos> All right, I was trying to help Guardian and I...<eos> If he'd showed up two seconds later, I don't...<eos> Hey, Kara needs you.

I need you.
Hey, thanks for the recharge.<eos> No, it was all this guy's idea.<eos> I couldn't make the trip myself, so I thought I'd send a little sun along.<eos> - Welcome home, Supergirl.<eos> - Thanks, J'onn.<eos> Earth smells funny.<eos> Always smell like this?<eos> Oh, my baby.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mom.<eos> I should've listened to you.

That's it?<eos> You gotta give me more than that.<eos> I have always felt so responsible.<eos> Like, weight of the world responsible.<eos> And my parents always relied on me to watch over my sister, so the few times that I've ever did anything for myself, it ended badly.<eos> And then Supergirl went missing and I just, I blew a gasket and...<eos> Because Supergirl's your sister.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Come on.<eos> Look, I know you.
Thank you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Club soda?<eos> - I see, thank you.<eos> - I found it. You look cozy and comfortable.<eos> Well, I am.<eos> So you still feeling betwixt and between?<eos> - No, no, I feel amazing.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> So what brings you by?
There we are.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> That's what I wanted to...<eos> About?<eos> Because the list of things you were wrong about is,<eos> - is, it's long.<eos> - Yes, long list.<eos> Um, I...<eos> About getting involved.<eos> And then I saw you with those people and...
Who writes this crap anyway?<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> Yes, it was the spear that was purportedly used to penetrate the side of Christ after he died on the cross.<eos> And now, it can be used to rewrite reality itself.<eos> Then what would the Speedster need the Spear of Destiny for?<eos> He could just go back and change history himself.<eos> Changes to history cause timequakes and aberrations, which we can undo.<eos> Changes to reality, however, those are permanent.<eos> Who's coming for you?
Wait, how do we even know where to find Washington?<eos> The night before crossing the Delaware, Washington was in Pennsylvania at the home of William Keith.<eos> So we're just gonna break into someone's house on Christmas Eve? - Yep, just like Santa.<eos> Keith would've thrown a Christmas banquet for Washington and his men.<eos> Secret mission on Christmas Eve.<eos> Congratulations, Mick, you just became a private in the U.S. Army.<eos> Nate, Amaya, you two will pose as wealthy newlyweds eager to make a contribution to the revolutionary cause.<eos> Jax and Stein, quarterback the mission from the ship.<eos> At the first sign of trouble, you Firestorm up.<eos> Ray, I need you to miniaturize down in the ATOM suit...
You're suffering from hypothermia.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're the one who doesn't think seals are cute.<eos> Whatever, I'm tired of arguing with you.<eos> I'm just gonna take a nap.<eos> No, Nathaniel, stay awake.<eos> I'm awake. I'm up. No, I'm not.<eos> You need skin on skin contact.<eos> My body heat will keep you warm.

I'm up. No, I'm not.<eos> You need skin on skin contact.<eos> My body heat will keep you warm.<eos> This isn't how I pictured getting you naked.
Shut up!<eos> He's with the Legion now.<eos> The Rip we know is gone.<eos> You know what day it is, Jax?<eos> It's December 25th.<eos> It's Christmas.<eos> It's when we remember to be our best selves.<eos> Why are you protecting him?<eos> I'm not protecting him.<eos> I'm protecting you.
You certainly know your way around a knife.<eos> Well, the League never covered poultry, but I'll give it a shot.<eos> I'm certainly glad to be human sized again.<eos> Man, it's good to have you back.<eos> This Christmas dinner idea? It might be your best one yet.<eos> It makes it feel kind of like home.<eos> Yeah, right down to the drunk uncle.<eos> Careful, Haircut.<eos> I'm your forefather now.<eos> - That's true. - Hey, I got you a gift.

Copy that.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The Spear allegedly has the power to rewrite reality.<eos> I know that you're one of the protectors of the Spear of Destiny, and I know that you know where the other pieces are hidden.<eos> Oh... okay, okay.<eos> The piece of the Spear's inside your telescope.<eos> Will you put the gun down, Jax?<eos> He's with the Legion now.<eos> Why are you protecting him?<eos> I'm protecting you.
And it's a good thing I did.<eos> These components appear to be a set, perhaps functioning together as transmitter and receiver.<eos> - Or commander and soldier.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> The commander wears the transmitter, sending orders via an electro-telepathic signal to this receiver, worn by the soldier.<eos> Well, anything with a signal can get hacked.<eos> That is the hope, yes.<eos> So all we need to is somehow boost the brain power of whoever's wearing this.<eos> Or find someone with a preternaturally powerful brain.<eos> You mean you?
Hey, we have enough enemies as it is - without fighting each other.<eos> - You left us, Amaya.<eos> I was there to protect the Spear, and I will continue to protect it until I take my last breath.<eos> Because you know that doing the right thing is more important than doing what feels right.<eos> You're still a member of the Justice Society.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> My heart belongs in Camelot.<eos> Your heart?<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> It wasn't duty that led you to join the Legends.
What?<eos> But the battle hasn't even begun.<eos> Precisely why we're leaving now.<eos> Listen, Amaya found the fragment, so there's need for this medieval warfare.<eos> That's great news, right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> In case you weren't listening, this is the part where we run.<eos> - I can't. - Sure, you can.<eos> Left foot, right foot, repeat, let's go.<eos> No, Nate, look around you.
Ray.<eos> Oh, come on, buddy, open your eyes, you stupid bastard.<eos> Ray, come on!<eos> Ray!<eos> Stop yelling at me.<eos> Ray, you brilliant bastard.<eos> It's not Ray anymore.<eos> It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.
Captain Hunter considered it barbaric and supremely dangerous.<eos> You two think you can figure this Cognitive Intrusion thing out?<eos> With the professor as my assistant, yeah.<eos> You cannot be serious.<eos> Very serious.<eos> So who's going in?<eos> I will.<eos> I brought Rip onto the ship.<eos> It's my responsibility. No way.<eos> I'm not letting you go in alone.
You sure these guns are gonna work in here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I ain't never been in nobody's mind before.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Yeah, yeah, I think they'll work just fine.<eos> Sara...<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> Ah, yo.<eos> God, I'm a bitch in Rip's mind.<eos> If that's how he thinks of you in his subconscious...
Like Evil Ray, Evil Stein.<eos> Evil Mick.<eos> I guess that's just regular Mick, but still.<eos> All right, let's find Rip, get what we need, - and get out of here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think... I think we ditched her.<eos> Okay, quick question, Ray.<eos> Your lady dinosaur friend, you said she recognized your scent.<eos> Wait, I believe her name was Gertrude.<eos> Right, I couldn't help but get the feeling that Gertrude didn't like you very much.
Wow, that's... that's great, Ray.<eos> Okay, once we find Rip, how are we gonna get him to tell us where Nate's grandfather is if...?<eos> - If Rip thinks we're all evil?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> One problem at a time.<eos> What's our other problem?<eos> Go find Rip. I'll hold these guys off.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> This is our ship.<eos> But there's always room for a pretty little thing like you.
Rip?<eos> That really you?<eos> I don't know who I am anymore, Mr. Jackson.<eos> What I do know is that we've got to get out of here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> This place only existed because Rip believed it did, and now that he's seen the truth...<eos> You have to leave.<eos> Thank you, thank you for believing in me even when I didn't.<eos> - You have to go.<eos> - Well, I can't just leave you.
Thank God.<eos> But what about the captain?<eos> You... you were with me all of these days in this prison.<eos> You were what saw me through, just as you have guided me to safety through all our years on the ship.<eos> That is my purpose, Captain.<eos> Yeah, but if this place isn't real, then does that mean that you don't exist either?<eos> Not in this form, no.<eos> But unless you let me go... you won't exist either.<eos> Not in any way that matters.<eos> I can't leave you, Gideon.
- I know.<eos> - Sorry, man.<eos> I'll start tomorrow.<eos> There you are. Oh, hey.<eos> Everybody ready to go?<eos> All right, I'll just be a minute.<eos> I gotta recalibrate the time drive.<eos> You okay?<eos> I was reminded... that partners must believe in one another.<eos> You know I have the utmost faith and trust in you, Jefferson.
But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was, until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> - You're a white Martian?<eos> - I am not like them.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I spared you so you can rot in a cell for all eternity.
Shoot shoot.<eos> Yeah, well, the last part got complicated.<eos> That's a bullet hole.<eos> That's a bullet hole in a suit I made.<eos> It grazed my arm.<eos> - Did you get shot?<eos> - I'm a little shot.<eos> That is it.<eos> That's it. We're telling Kara.<eos> - Would you please calm down?
Okay. The workload.<eos> The lying to Kara.<eos> It's gotta stop.<eos> Winn, you know what she's gonna say.<eos> Maybe she's gonna be totally cool about all this, all right?<eos> You guys have worked together before.<eos> She totally respects what you do.<eos> Maybe she'll be grateful for the help.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Seriously, this is officially the first time I have ever asked you for something.
Sorry.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Looks like an inmate named Lisa Gold and a thug disguised as a guard helped her out.<eos> Or she kidnapped them.<eos> Look, until we know for sure what happened, let's just stick to the facts.<eos> This was very well staged and very well thought out.<eos> And we know Livewire is not one for thoughts.<eos> Yeah, she's mostly "kill this, electrocute that."<eos> She's probably already killed that inmate and guard.<eos> Kara, I know Livewire's a sore spot for you, but just get a grip.
The city is not defenseless, Kara.<eos> I hate having a nemesis.<eos> Clark always makes it look so much fun, like you have a deadly pen pal you see once a year. But having a nemesis is stressful.<eos> Well, you're not alone in this fight. You have friends.<eos> You have help.<eos> And you're not the only hero in National City.<eos> Yeah, that's a good point.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, that is actually such a relief.<eos> I, for one, am relieved to hear you say that.
Do you have something against Mon-El?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I think he's a fun guy.<eos> He's just not a hero.<eos> Why do you get to decide that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Just... Forget it.<eos> I, um... Sorry.<eos> What did... What did you want to tell me?<eos> I came in here and bulldozed you.
- Not like me.<eos> Not like...<eos> - Mon-El?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> You saw him, he left civilians unprotected at that fight which I had to go back for.<eos> - Mon-El's still learning.<eos> - At what cost, Kara?<eos> There was a cop that took a lightning bolt because "Mon-El's still learning."<eos> He cares about himself, he cares about you, and that's what he fights for.
There was a cop that took a lightning bolt because "Mon-El's still learning."<eos> He cares about himself, he cares about you, and that's what he fights for.<eos> But he can change.<eos> You can't.<eos> You are never going to be strong enough for this.<eos> You do not get to decide who is a hero.<eos> And who are you to tell me how to be?<eos> Or who to be.<eos> I am meant for this.<eos> If you don't stop, I'll stop you.
And who are you to tell me how to be?<eos> Or who to be.<eos> I am meant for this.<eos> If you don't stop, I'll stop you.<eos> You're welcome to try.<eos> Do you want to know how she's doing? I know.<eos> I always know.<eos> She could be halfway across the city and I would... Feel her.<eos> The final cruelty of our war that I should still feel tied to those creatures.<eos> When I needed her, when you needed her, she opened up a vein for you.

Forgiveness is something you give to yourself.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, what's wrong?<eos> I can't trust you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You were reckless.<eos> You left your post and because of you, someone got hurt.<eos> I was trying to protect you.
I have these powers, and I should use them. That's not an answer.<eos> Do you like me?<eos> Do I like...<eos> Uh, at the moment, that's a tough call.<eos> You kissed me when you were sick.<eos> Yeah, um, says you.<eos> Are you working with me because you like me?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, okay?<eos> I want to work with you, Kara! And that is it!<eos> I'm sorry if that disappoints you.
Guardian for the win.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - It won't be long now.<eos> We're not saying goodbye.<eos> I'm bringing her back.<eos> I have to try the Bond.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> I've, uh, never attempted this with a White Martian.<eos> I don't know what'll happen.<eos> If things get hairy, I'm gonna pull you out.
You could have the real deal.<eos> I don't think you understand your purpose here.<eos> See, after seeing news footage of the attack, every military on Earth is gonna want my super soldiers.<eos> That's why I staged the attack on the police station,<eos> I knew Supergirl couldn't resist it.<eos> And she gave me a two-for-one deal.<eos> Showed everyone that my super soldiers could take the cops and Supergirl using just their electricity.<eos> My electricity.<eos> This is copyright infringement, asshat.<eos> I'm gonna sue you, and then, I'm gonna murder you.
That's where you two come in.<eos> Perfect specimens.<eos> Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.<eos> We will never fight for you.<eos> You will.<eos> You, you might definitely die.<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - Oh, what do you care?
That's enough!<eos> Come on!<eos> Stop!<eos> You two, go get them, I'll save Livewire.<eos> Got it.<eos> This might hurt a little.<eos> It's nice of you.<eos> Stupid, but nice.<eos> You're not looking so hot, blondie.<eos> I'll warm you up.
This might hurt a little.<eos> It's nice of you.<eos> Stupid, but nice.<eos> You're not looking so hot, blondie.<eos> I'll warm you up.<eos> You could kill me. For all the things you think I stole from you. But you wouldn't be who you are if not for me.<eos> This is who you are now.<eos> For better or worse.<eos> He tried to take your powers from you, not me.<eos> We may not be allies, but I will punish him for you.
I'll make you a deal, all-American Barbie.<eos> You can haul his ass to prison, but I never see the inside of a cell again.<eos> I can't make that deal.<eos> - Then he fries.<eos> - No, Leslie, don't!<eos> My name is Livewire!<eos> Livewire, listen to me!<eos> Why?<eos> You know you can't stop me from leaving.<eos> And you know you can't stop me from chasing after you.
They're coming.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, that's your door.<eos> - Come on in. - Thanks.<eos> So, are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just you, uh...<eos> You were right.<eos> I remember kissing you.
Do you... Do you want to sit?<eos> - I... I feel like... - Yeah, sure.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I remember.<eos> I was sick and alone.<eos> And you were leaning over me.<eos> And you must have been sad. Or something because your eyes were insanely blue.<eos> I mean, they always are.<eos> But they were like comets.<eos> And I had never seen anyone so stunning, and I kissed you,

Because I care about you.
Kara, you all right?<eos> Can I get you anything to drink?<eos> Just get me something strong.<eos> Actually, you know what, I'll have what he's having.<eos> Oh, he's been drinking exclusively club soda for the last week.<eos> Really?<eos> I'll just stick with my club soda then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> I saw you yesterday, too.
As an agent of the DEO, I have a duty to protect this Earth.<eos> If any of those monsters show up, I have to be ready.<eos> Well, like I said, they're coming. They're not here yet.<eos> So, you can stop...<eos> M'orzz!<eos> Mind if I cut in?<eos> I didn't know if we'd see you tonight.<eos> Why wouldn't you be?<eos> Thought you might be off Guardian-ing or whatever.<eos> You understand I'm just worried about you.
I don't need protection.<eos> M'gann. You're making a big mistake.<eos> Risking yourself helps no one.<eos> This is my fight, J'onn.<eos> You're cut off after this one.<eos> Armek.<eos> I knew you recognized me in the alley, k'onahr.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.

Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.<eos> The nest has been cold these 300 years without you.<eos> It was always cold.<eos> You've been impersonating a Green.<eos> How do you live with yourself?<eos> I thought you were dead, and I suppose it gave me some comfort.<eos> Your parting gift.<eos> No, you didn't kill me, but you came closer than anyone ever will.<eos> I've come to bring you back to Mars, k'onahr.

If you ever cared for me, you'll leave them alone.<eos> I'm going to make this very simple.<eos> You have two hours to turn yourself over to me.<eos> If you do, I may let them live.<eos> If you don't...<eos> Let's just say, I'm glad you made friends here on Earth, M'gann.<eos> It will be such a pleasure to watch them burn.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> They'll just find you again.
I refused to open my eyes to what was right in front of me.<eos> People who were willing to take a chance.<eos> It's taken me hundreds of years to learn to trust again after...<eos> After what my people did.<eos> You are not your people.<eos> Okay? You are kind and you are generous and willing to put yourself before others.<eos> You are different.<eos> Then you know that I can't just stay here and let these monsters hurt you and your friends.<eos> They're not just my friends, they're your friends, too.<eos> And they want to protect you.
Then you know that I can't just stay here and let these monsters hurt you and your friends.<eos> They're not just my friends, they're your friends, too.<eos> And they want to protect you.<eos> Please. Don't run away.<eos> Trust us.<eos> Man, the last time I saw them, I think I was in college.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, I don't remember.<eos> You know, for a super-fan, you are not that excited.
Hey.<eos> Shouldn't you be at your concert?<eos> Ah, well, I wanted to check in.<eos> I was just going to get an update, but I don't think we've found anything yet.<eos> I mean I wanted to check in about us.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry I bailed on your Earth birthday.<eos> You made all those plans.<eos> I made them this morning, it's not a big deal.<eos> This morning?<eos> - So last-minute of you. - I know.
- You promise? - Absolutely.<eos> You find out anything else?<eos> All is clear on the Martian front.<eos> We were about to game plan some new tracking techniques.<eos> M'gann.<eos> You're here.<eos> I want to help in any way that I can.<eos> I hate them even more than you do.<eos> It's very brave of you to come.<eos> We'll do everything we can to keep you safe.
- No.<eos> They can read minds, too.<eos> They know all your preferences, everything that makes you who you are.<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Whoa, whoa!<eos> - Holster your sidearms!<eos> - Yes, do that, please.<eos> - I wasn't looking at you.
Supergirl, Alex, you hit the basement.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> All clear.<eos> We're not so good at communicating these days, are we?<eos> I was mad before.<eos> About Earth birthday.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I shouldn't have bailed on you.
You shouldn't.<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> It's just...<eos> Ever since I've been on Earth, I don't know what life is like, without you there all the time.<eos> And I felt that changing and it's just...<eos> Scary.<eos> When my parents put me on that pod in Krypton, I... I don't think I realized what was actually happening.<eos> I didn't know that I was saying goodbye to them forever.<eos> I've been abandoned before, and I didn't wanna be abandoned again.<eos> I will never abandon you.
I'd never let you do that.<eos> I know you think it's your duty, but...<eos> It's not just my duty, M'gann.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> You've become dear to me in a way no one has been since...<eos> I just had this huge hole in my heart for so long now. I never thought... Dreamed that anybody would be able to fill it.<eos> When I realized you were a White Martian, I never thought that that person would be... You.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Your spirit is so beautiful and brave.<eos> Now that I'm able to see that, I can't imagine my life without you.
It's not just my duty, M'gann.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> You've become dear to me in a way no one has been since...<eos> I just had this huge hole in my heart for so long now. I never thought... Dreamed that anybody would be able to fill it.<eos> When I realized you were a White Martian, I never thought that that person would be... You.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Your spirit is so beautiful and brave.<eos> Now that I'm able to see that, I can't imagine my life without you.<eos> I'm brave because you showed me how to be.<eos> I'll protect you, M'gann.
I've been on my own for so long and...<eos> Though I had a mother, she wasn't warm, that's not our way, but she cared for me.<eos> I know she did.<eos> And I'd forgotten that feeling until now... What it feels like to have a family.<eos> Which is what makes this so hard.<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> Why?<eos> There must be other voices like mine.<eos> White Martians who have the desire and the capacity to change, who don't want to be defined by the hatred of our kind, but just need a push to do the right thing.<eos> They could kill you as soon as you land.

I'm so happy for you.
Well...<eos> Go ahead. Blow it out.<eos> Gently!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Was Maggie mad that you missed the concert?<eos> Well, luckily, I have a girlfriend that understands when deadly aliens besiege my place of work, that takes precedence.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad everyone is okay.<eos> That last White Martian...<eos> First of all, boy, did it do a good impression of you, and second, you got there just in time.
Do you remember?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm not crazy?<eos> Nope.<eos> I guess if the White Martian's bond is strong enough, the telepathy goes both ways.<eos> Yeah. I guess so.<eos> Kara.<eos> I'm not ever going anywhere.<eos> I promise.<eos> Just because I'm with Maggie, it doesn't mean I'm not with you...
I feel like everything's going to be okay.<eos> You have changed me forever.<eos> Goodbye, J'onn.<eos> Goodbye... Miss Martian.<eos> - It's... Kara!<eos> Mike...<eos> - Eve!<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> It's so funny, Mike, that you're here.<eos> I was going to call you later to talk about something, but...
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> We salvaged you and resurrected you.
I think having a sister will be good for Lex.<eos> The trial of Lillian Luthor continued today.<eos> Luthor, the suspected head of the anti-alien terrorist organization, Cadmus, has been charged with a host of crimes, including the use of a bio-weapon in an attempted extermination of all aliens in National City.<eos> That woman is bad news.<eos> Luthor claims that she is a victim...<eos> I hope once she's convicted, they, uh... They put her out on the town square for public shaming.<eos> On Daxam, it really seemed to cut back on recidivism.<eos> Uh, well, that kind of punishment actually went away a long time ago.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Yeah, I haven't, uh... Haven't seen you in a while. I've...
You really did a number on me in court.<eos> Measured, succinct, believable.<eos> The jury ate it up.<eos> I can just call the guard back and go. No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I promised myself I would be better.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> I asked you here because I wanted to let you know that I forgive you.
Please sit.<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> I asked you here because I wanted to let you know that I forgive you.<eos> That I still love you.<eos> The only time you ever tell me you love me is when you need something from me.<eos> I know I wasn't the greatest mother, but I did the best that I could.<eos> By making me feel unwanted.<eos> - Like an outsider.<eos> - You don't want to believe it, but I always tried to protect you.

Told me the truth about what?<eos> When your father and I first got together, it was the happiest time of my life.<eos> But after Lex was born, Lionel started having... an affair.<eos> I was clueless, until I went to surprise him on a business trip, only to find that he was with your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She was already pregnant with you by then.<eos> They paid her off.<eos> Your father came back to try and rebuild our marriage.<eos> Then when you were four, we heard your mother had died.<eos> The state was going to put you in foster care.

The state was going to put you in foster care.<eos> Your father brought you home and we adopted you.<eos> But he didn't like me spending time with you.<eos> I think it made him remember what he'd done.<eos> He felt guilty.<eos> He'd lash out.<eos> So, I stayed away.<eos> Gravitated to Lex.<eos> To protect myself.<eos> And you.

I mean, people still think Macaulay Culkin's dead.<eos> James, come on, you know we can't print this.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Snapper.<eos> And I think you should, too.<eos> Kara.<eos> Kara, come on, wait.<eos> No, no, are you kidding me?<eos> The only thing Lena has done is help.<eos> She called the police on her own mother over the Medusa virus. That's exactly my point.<eos> If she can betray her own mother, what is to stop her from pulling a long con on you?
And Clark believed in Lex for the longest time.<eos> No matter what people said, no matter what kind of proof he saw with his own eyes.<eos> No, Lex was his friend.<eos> - But Clark was wrong.<eos> - Lena is not Lex.<eos> But they grew up in the same house, Kara.<eos> I don't understand why you keep defending her.<eos> And you have so much faith in her, but none in me, as Guardian.<eos> That's entirely different.<eos> I am trying to protect you.
Are you going to tell me not to believe in her?<eos> You believe in a lot of people that others don't.<eos> Oh, did you talk to James?<eos> No, I'm actually talking about myself.<eos> You know, you believing in me, it meant a lot.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have been cold. - And distant. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And I'd like to apologize for that.<eos> Hey, I'm just glad to know that it's not me adjusting to Earth's chilly climate.<eos> I was mad at you, because I thought you were dating Eve.
You know, I'm not super hip on earthly social cues, but why would you be mad if I was dating Eve?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> You literally just said you were mad.<eos> No.<eos> Two seconds ago, you said, "I am mad about"...<eos> Yeah, I'm surprised.<eos> - Oh, not mad, surprised.<eos> - I'm surprised that...<eos> You'd just date someone else, when you were serious about me, because I mean if... How could you be serious if you did that?<eos> If you don't like me, why do you... Why do you care?
Two seconds ago, you said, "I am mad about"...<eos> Yeah, I'm surprised.<eos> - Oh, not mad, surprised.<eos> - I'm surprised that...<eos> You'd just date someone else, when you were serious about me, because I mean if... How could you be serious if you did that?<eos> If you don't like me, why do you... Why do you care?<eos> I'm gonna go check and see if they've found Lena.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Don't.<eos> You're still angry I had Metallo liberate you from that jail?
- Oh, not mad, surprised.<eos> - I'm surprised that...<eos> You'd just date someone else, when you were serious about me, because I mean if... How could you be serious if you did that?<eos> If you don't like me, why do you... Why do you care?<eos> I'm gonna go check and see if they've found Lena.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Don't.<eos> You're still angry I had Metallo liberate you from that jail?<eos> It makes me look more guilty when I'm not.<eos> Even if they found out the truth about you, no one would change their mind.
And if they could take the brightest mind on Earth and drive him crazy defending himself, imagine what they could do to you.<eos> Stop the van.<eos> I'm going back! To what?<eos> You have no life anymore, Lena.<eos> You have no one on your side.<eos> You're guilty, just like me.<eos> You're on the run, just like me.<eos> Join Cadmus. And together we can do all the great things you ever dreamed of.<eos> And with no Luthor men to divide us, I can finally be the mother you always wanted.<eos> Because I do love you.
It's a biometric lock.<eos> It scans for Luthor DNA.<eos> Tell me you don't have a bit of Lex frozen somewhere.<eos> I didn't say Lex's DNA.<eos> I said Luthor.<eos> Any Luthor can open it.<eos> And you, my daughter, are part of that family tree.<eos> You didn't have your green goon liberate me from prison because you loved me.<eos> Because you wanted to help me.<eos> You did it because I'm the only one who can open this vault for you.

Supergirl wore the last time she fought Metallo?<eos> - They're in pieces, I have to rebuild... - No, there's no time.<eos> I have to go now, or Lena's dead.<eos> Kara, we calculated the rate of radioactive decay.<eos> - It's faster than we thought.<eos> - How fast? Minutes.<eos> I mean, its half-life is decreasing exponentially.<eos> Kara, you have to turn back.<eos> When the Kryptonite explodes, it's gonna send out a radioactive cloud of Kryptonite gas.<eos> If you are anywhere near it, it'll kill you.
Everything we need to rid this planet of Kryptonians and every other alien invader, once and for all.<eos> You're worse than Lex.<eos> I promise you, I will be on the right side of history.<eos> Maybe then you'll believe that I was looking out for your best interests, after all.<eos> Whether you like it or not, I'll always be your mother.<eos> Oh, my beautiful boy.<eos> I had no idea...<eos> You finished it.<eos> Supergirl, I can't believe you're here.<eos> Kara Danvers believes in you.
Even when it's hard to find.<eos> Especially when it's hard to find.<eos> So, my office is overflowing with flowers.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Supergirl told me that it was you who sent her.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Well, that's what friends are for.<eos> I've never had friends like you before.

More like, you're an arrogant dude-bro and I'm the personification of the American way.<eos> I'm sorry, and I'm arrogant?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> It's just...<eos> Last year I thought I could have it all, and then I thought I couldn't.<eos> Then I had to pick.<eos> So, I chose being Supergirl over having a relationship.<eos> And then, you came along,<eos> and I thought you were... thoughtless and selfish.<eos> And I kept writing you off.
And I kept writing you off.<eos> And you kept proving me wrong.<eos> And I just got me thinking...<eos> Maybe I can have it all.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Darling!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is Mr. Mxyzptlk.<eos> And Kara Zor-El, I love you.
I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> Goodbye, J'onn.<eos> Goodbye, Miss Martian.<eos> And I just got me thinking... Maybe I can have it all.<eos> Darling! Kara Zor-El, I love you.
Candles!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Then, music!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Next, flowers!<eos> And for the piece de resistance...<eos> The ring!<eos> Kara, sweetie, it's like I said.<eos> I'm your one true love, your soulmate, your one true pairing as the kids say.<eos> My name is Mxyzptlk and I love you, Kara Zor-El.

Tell me...<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't know how you got to this planet, - but she's with me.<eos> - The other suitor!<eos> I didn't see you there, tall, dark and bland-some.
Are you crazy?<eos> You can't just put me in a wedding dress.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's Vera Wang.<eos> This is not okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, I came on strong.<eos> I'm just enthusiastic to finally be here with you.<eos> How do you even know who I am?<eos> I watched you cross the dimensions.

Everything else, yes. But go figure.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just not interested.<eos> Don't be sorry, buttercup, I know what you're doing.<eos> You're playing hard to get, which is utterly charming and delightful, by the way.<eos> What? No.<eos> No. I'm not...<eos> You're flustered, confused, your heart is racing?<eos> I have that effect on women.<eos> Let me tell you how this works.<eos> I chose you as my mate, and now I will wow you with breathtaking feats of ardor until you fall madly in love with me.

So, this Day of Valentine, is that something we're supposed to...<eos> - Maybe we should talk in private...<eos> - Okay, private.<eos> This is good.<eos> So, you and me...<eos> Um, there was something happening between us before - Mxyzptlk showed up.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. And I really, really want to get back to that.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Me, too... - But first, I have to get rid of him.<eos> I mean, of all the girls in all the galaxies, that the little imp had to pick you - to pursue you as his mate...
The ridiculous notion that you need a manufactured holiday to prove that you care?<eos> It just proves that people are patsies willing to throw away money on cheap chocolate and wilted roses.<eos> Makes me want to puke.<eos> I hate Valentine's Day.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I knew we were right for each other, Danvers.<eos> Can I get another Lallorian lager, please?<eos> 'Cause Valentine's Day sucks.<eos> Was this your spot?<eos> He says Lallorian lager is for weak-minded idiots. Like you.
He says Lallorian lager is for weak-minded idiots. Like you.<eos> Yeah... That is a very, very valid point.<eos> So why don't I buy you gentlemen something... Something stronger, right?<eos> Put the human down.<eos> I hate bullies.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I do too.<eos> Thank you for bailing me out.<eos> Not that I needed it because I totally had those guys.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That guy probably would've choked to death on your bones as he ate you.
Actually, lots.<eos> If you just take from it what you will, but between genies, djinn and leprechauns,<eos> I mean, humans have been documenting contact with reality-bending creatures for centuries.<eos> And how did they slay them?<eos> - On Daxam, we crush them.<eos> - What? No. Absolutely not.<eos> We learned the hard way that the only way to deal with them was to kill them quickly.<eos> - Let me... Let me take care of him.<eos> - No! No. We don't kill.<eos> I'm not going to let some imp stalk you and live.
- Parasite!<eos> - How is he still alive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> You're the one who's dead.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was going to ask you the same question.
Um, hello. I was helping her so...<eos> You?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> You're lucky I flew in when I did, Supergirl.<eos> I mean, do you think this fraud could have helped you save the day?<eos> What superpower?<eos> I guess he could have leaped over Parasite like a gazelle.<eos> Hey, that's...<eos> Oh, would you like to see my superpower?<eos> 'Cause I will just rip you apart with my bare hands right here if you're interested in that.
Oh, would you like to see my superpower?<eos> 'Cause I will just rip you apart with my bare hands right here if you're interested in that.<eos> Spoken like a true Daxamite.<eos> You're nothing but a thug.<eos> I mean, this goddess, she requires a man who's equal in her powers and wits.<eos> Who can come to her aid when villains suddenly pop up.<eos> Wait... Parasite...<eos> This was all you?<eos> Don't you... Don't you see what he's doing here?<eos> He's creating havoc so that he can play the hero and then impress you.
- I'm not jealous. Okay?<eos> I'm angry, because you have an unfair double standard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right, I don't hold you and Mxy to the same standard, because I expect bad behavior from him, but from you,<eos> - I expect much, much better. - Oh.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> - What?<eos> You do not get to turn this around on me.<eos> Because I'm the one in this situation, at this moment...<eos> Good to see you, Dana.
Yeah.<eos> You're right, I don't hold you and Mxy to the same standard, because I expect bad behavior from him, but from you,<eos> - I expect much, much better. - Oh.<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> - What?<eos> You do not get to turn this around on me.<eos> Because I'm the one in this situation, at this moment...<eos> Good to see you, Dana.<eos> - That is supposed to be mad.<eos> - You know what? I thought you changed. I really did,
I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry I'm late. - Better have a good reason.<eos> - I do.<eos> I just got us reservations at Saxon's, which, on Valentine's Day, is, like, harder than getting a Hellgrammite to eat leafy greens, so...<eos> So we are set for 8:00.<eos> Um... And you can tell me about Starhaven, and I'll tell you about growing up in Newark.<eos> And then I thought we'd get a nightcap.<eos> You know, just talk some more.<eos> I just feel like, um, when dating, it's better to get to know each other...<eos> I want you.
- Where is he?<eos> - He should be here.<eos> Most of the relics tested negative for Fifth Dimensional energy, however, there was one that might be of some use.<eos> Odd.<eos> Mon-El.<eos> Mxyzptlk!<eos> Show yourself, you smug, grand-standing dandy.<eos> Oh, bummer sticks.<eos> It's just you.<eos> I've come to challenge you, Mxyzptlk.
- But first...<eos> - Buddy.<eos> If we're going to take part in a proper duel, we're gonna do it like the gentlemen that we are.<eos> What the...<eos> How do you like the duds, Monsieur Hamilton?<eos> I'm a Burr man, myself.<eos> He gets a bad rap, but let's be honest, he was the one who knew his way around a pistol.<eos> Pistols at dawn! So revolutionary.<eos> I love it.<eos> So if I shoot you with this, you'll die?
So if I shoot you with this, you'll die?<eos> That is generally how these things work, yes.<eos> But don't throw away your shot, because you'll only get one.<eos> I only need one.<eos> Did you really think I would hand you a loaded gun that could actually kill me?<eos> You Daxamites really are thick, aren't you?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> You may have cut me off from the Fifth Dimension, Daxamite, but I still know a thing or two about the old fisticuffs.<eos> How could you think she'd ever want to be with someone like you?
I'm a God and you're a loser!<eos> - You're a dead man.<eos> - Strike that. Reverse it.<eos> I hear you're allergic to lead.<eos> Stop!<eos> - Kara.<eos> - Sweetheart.<eos> This volatile maniac tried to kill me!<eos> It'll be better for all of us once I snuff him out.<eos> I'll marry you!
- He talks too much.<eos> Let's get this show on the road.<eos> I'll get our officiant, you want the Pope, a Lubavitcher Rabbi?<eos> It would mean the world to me if I followed Kryptonian custom and got married on the soil of my people.<eos> Kryptonian soil coming up.<eos> No. I meant...<eos> I meant the Fortress of Solitude.<eos> I'll wear my mother's dress.<eos> So meet me there tomorrow at noon.<eos> I'll see you soon... Wife.
I wish I could snap my fingers and give you everything you wish for, and it kills me that he can do that stuff for you and I can't.<eos> And I acted badly, okay?<eos> Very badly.<eos> But please... Please do not marry him.<eos> I will be better for you...<eos> It's not just the jealousy thing, Mon-El.<eos> It's the patronizing ego thing.<eos> I told you I could handle Mxy, and you didn't listen.<eos> I swear to Rao, I will listen, Kara.<eos> I will respect you, just please, just give me another chance...

I'm sorry.<eos> Alex?<eos> Hey, Kara.<eos> Alex around?<eos> I was looking for her, too.<eos> She's not here.<eos> I was hoping I could see her.<eos> I need to apologize.<eos> I acted like an idiot last night.<eos> Look, I know Valentine's Day might not be happy for you, but it means something to Alex to spend a romantic holiday with someone she cares about.
I acted like an idiot last night.<eos> Look, I know Valentine's Day might not be happy for you, but it means something to Alex to spend a romantic holiday with someone she cares about.<eos> Maybe you might want to consider making some changes for her.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Kara, darling!<eos> Where are you?<eos> It's time!<eos> Kara! You said noon and here I am!<eos> - Kara!<eos> - I can hear you.
Kara, darling!<eos> Where are you?<eos> It's time!<eos> Kara! You said noon and here I am!<eos> - Kara!<eos> - I can hear you.<eos> Where's the dress? The flowers?<eos> The pigs in blankets?<eos> See, that's the thing, Mxy.<eos> I'm not going to marry you.

The flowers?<eos> The pigs in blankets?<eos> See, that's the thing, Mxy.<eos> I'm not going to marry you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I brought you to the Fortress in case you got violent again. 'Cause I didn't want anyone to get hurt when I broke the news.
- You don't love me?<eos> - Love isn't making demands of someone, or forcing them to marry you.<eos> Love is putting someone else's needs above your own.<eos> So you brought me all the way up here just to reject me?<eos> I think you're going to have to explain your catastrophic lack of judgment to your family.<eos> What's that, Uncle Jor-El?<eos> If you have to hold Kara down till she sees reason and becomes my bride, you will?<eos> I offered you the world, Kara Zor-El.<eos> Anything you wanted. And you reject it all?<eos> I could have made you a god, like me.
Anything you wanted. And you reject it all?<eos> I could have made you a god, like me.<eos> I don't want to be a god, Mxy.<eos> I just want you off of Earth.<eos> You don't get to tell me what to do until after we're married!<eos> Sorry, Uncle Jor-El.<eos> You think this is the worst it can get?<eos> One snap and I'll crack your world in half.<eos> Then where will you go, Kryptonian?<eos> I will hound you across the stars, Kara, until you admit that you love me.
Let's not be too hasty, huh?<eos> - Atomic Cauldron fusion increased 2,000%.<eos> When the Cauldron goes up, it'll explode with the force of a 400-megaton bomb.<eos> The Fortress is sealed so should contain the blast, but anyone inside it will...<eos> - This sounds bad.<eos> - You can't stop me from killing myself. It's in the rules.<eos> There's only room for one crazy person in this relationship.<eos> Maybe we should just, um, control-alt-delete this, and we can talk it over with a cup of Thoni tea.<eos> Being with you would mean being at odds every day with my heart, Mxyzptlk.<eos> I'd rather die in here than be with you.
Okay, please.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Just don't die.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not going to tell you the cancellation code.<eos> So there's a code?<eos> I can't read this.<eos> Atomic Cauldron detonation in 30 seconds.<eos> I don't have time to learn your stupid moon language!<eos> Please, Supergirl. I'm literally begging you.
You can't force love, Mxyzptlk, you have to let it find you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone is staring at me.<eos> Let them stare.<eos> You...<eos> I mean, you look just beautiful.<eos> - I didn't think you'd call.<eos> - Why?<eos> Last night was, like, beyond amazing on just so many levels.<eos> I figured it was a one-time thing for you.
Hey, I just wanted to let you know that you're awesome.<eos> No, you are.<eos> You out-tricked the most cunning intergalactic trickster, and you did it your way, without violence, which I never should have doubted because you're...<eos> You know, you're you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I also wanted to say I'm sorry. For acting like an ass.<eos> I've been giving it a lot of thought and I have realized that you are my Kryptonite.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Oh, uh...<eos> No, I mean, my feelings for you.
I'll get... I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go yet. Please.<eos> I get that you were upset that I wasn't listening to you and I...<eos> I tried really, really, really hard to listen to you this time.<eos> And I heard that you...<eos> You don't think that we belong together, and I respected that.<eos> No, but Mxy wasn't the only one I tricked.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> I just said it so you'd let me go to protect you.
Cover me!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They told me but I didn't believe it.<eos> Alex. My Alex.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know how long we were rotting out there in the Amazon, but... I came to at Cadmus.<eos> They saved me, so I could save Henshaw.<eos> They forced me to keep him alive, to enhance him.<eos> Physically turn him into the monster he was beneath.<eos> It is strange seeing you in Henshaw's skin.
The DEO and Supergirl won't be able to stop us this time.<eos> So, what you're telling me is that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and Alex and Kara's long lost father has returned from Cadmus custody with news that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion explosive using Kara's other-worldly heat vision radiation, and that they're going to drop that on National City and just kill us all?<eos> Ha! Is... Is this...<eos> Is this place bomb-proof? You could run a trace on Kara's heat vision radiation signature.<eos> Right, yeah well, if the bomb is armed, then yes, I might be able to pinpoint its location before it goes off.<eos> Good, get to work, Winn.<eos> Jeremiah!<eos> Eliza.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My God, did I miss you?
Fourteen years with Cadmus, this is all I ever thought about. Right here.<eos> Look at our girls.<eos> Thank you, Lizzie.<eos> I'm so sorry... That I wasn't here.<eos> It's going to be different now.<eos> We can make up for lost time.<eos> No.<eos> It's not possible. That time, it's gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that I love you and I have missed you every day.

I would run.<eos> - Because he was not a good man.<eos> So... You know what? I'm sorry about that.<eos> But this is not about you and your suspicion, and your disrespect are out of line. And you need to leave my home.<eos> - Kara...<eos> - No. - That's the...<eos> - No, no!<eos> You've ignored what I need from moment one today.<eos> I asked for privacy and time and you ignored that.<eos> And I asked you to give Jeremiah the benefit of the doubt and you ignored that too.
They demanded we all be better.<eos> I owe them a great deal.<eos> Don't sell yourself short, J'onn.<eos> It's easy for the young to demand change.<eos> And you were open to it.<eos> You did your part.<eos> A lot of lives are going to be better because of you.<eos> What did I say?<eos> You were the first human to treat me as an equal. Knowing who I really was.<eos> I didn't think that I'd ever see you again, my friend.
Dad?<eos> - What are you?<eos> - I'm sorry, friend. I've changed.<eos> J'onn!<eos> Put him down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> We have to get back. Now!<eos> Let's move!<eos> What have you done?<eos> J'onn, please, stay down, I don't want to hurt you any more than I have.
- What are you?<eos> - I'm sorry, friend. I've changed.<eos> J'onn!<eos> Put him down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> We have to get back. Now!<eos> Let's move!<eos> What have you done?<eos> J'onn, please, stay down, I don't want to hurt you any more than I have.<eos> I asked you a question.
Let's move!<eos> What have you done?<eos> J'onn, please, stay down, I don't want to hurt you any more than I have.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> What have you done?<eos> What I had to.<eos> Mon-El was right.<eos> You are a Cadmus man.<eos> J'onn, please, it's not the whole story.<eos> I will not let you leave.
Train.<eos> Go.<eos> Alex!<eos> Dad!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Look at me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?
Look at me!<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?<eos> You betrayed everyone at the DEO.<eos> Your friends.<eos> Our family, everyone that I love.<eos> You did that for me?<eos> Family's complicated, honey.<eos> I'm bringing you in.
I've never met a human that was actually up for dating an alien.<eos> Well, now you have.<eos> Any idea what Jeremiah stole from us?<eos> It's not good.<eos> He took the national alien registry.<eos> What is it?<eos> Cadmus has the list of all the aliens in the country.<eos> How could you?<eos> You betrayed everyone.<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?
That's not what matters.<eos> What matters is our father and there's still good in him.<eos> So, I just... I need you to convince J'onn, 'cause I have to be there when we find Cadmus...<eos> Alex...<eos> - I have to protect him.<eos> - Alex, listen to me. I am not gonna let anything happen to Jeremiah.<eos> I promise. But you are putting all of your focus on him when you should be focusing on the aliens we are trying to find.<eos> And when we find them, you risk making a bad call, putting him in danger. Or worse, getting yourself hurt.<eos> I have to go, I'm sorry. I have to figure out how to get this article run.<eos> I'll call you later.
I don't understand.<eos> Lillian was going to kill them all.<eos> You are forcibly deporting them.<eos> I mean, some of them have escaped famine and poverty and genocide.<eos> At least this way, they have a chance.<eos> - It was all a lie.<eos> - No.<eos> No, everything you told me in the woods. You said that you were working for Cadmus for me.<eos> And I am.<eos> From the moment Cadmus took me prisoner they told me they were gonna kill you and Kara unless I did what they said.
You can do this.<eos> You got this.<eos> Come on. Come on!<eos> Okay.<eos> And in breaking news, authorities have thwarted a terrorist plot to send registered aliens back into space.<eos> Alien families are being reunited.<eos> - It's a happy ending to what was... - Winn!<eos> - A harrowing series of events.<eos> - Oh, thank God, you're safe.<eos> Oh, I thought I lost you.
The rules are there for a reason. To make sure you get the story right.<eos> That's not luck.<eos> That's being a good reporter.<eos> You know what the worst part is?<eos> I was rooting for you.<eos> I'm sorry I disobeyed your orders, J'onn.<eos> But you shouldn't have done what you did.<eos> That was cruel.<eos> I did it because I thought you might be reckless and get yourself hurt.<eos> But then I almost lost you in that ship anyway.

I only did it to protect you.
It's just me.<eos> Supergirl is what I can do.<eos> Kara is who I am.<eos> I really loved that job.<eos> Hey.<eos> You have so much to offer this world.<eos> So don't let Snapper or anyone else tell you differently.<eos> Okay?<eos> - You know something?<eos> - What? Maybe being Supergirl and having you is enough.
Where the hell is he?<eos> And there we are. Hey...<eos> We're here.<eos> We're here.<eos> We are at the national city art gallery side entrance.<eos> Wow, you know that people generally go in the front door, and when they do, it's kinda during the day.<eos> So, let's come back in the morning! But they won't let us do what I want to do tomorrow morning. Whoa!<eos> What are you... Woman, you are a she-hulk.<eos> Where's your sense of adventure?<eos> Okay, winn, I'm not gonna make you do anything you don't wanna do.
Okay, okay.<eos> Wow, this is a little complicated so it just might take me...<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Well, I think it's time we give the noobs the old Supergirl welcome.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No way.<eos> Kara, you were...<eos> All we know about these people is that they want you, so you should be the last person to go.
Why would you want to beam yourself up to an unknown spacecraft?<eos> 'Cause, stuff...<eos> No.<eos> Mon-El...<eos> Are they bowing to us?<eos> Mon-El?<eos> Mother?<eos> Father?<eos> My son.<eos> We finally found you.
Our prince.<eos> Thank the gods you're alive.<eos> And returned to us at last.<eos> So, tonight, we feast!<eos> I can't stay.<eos> I'm also a hero.<eos> Well, trying to be with Kara's help and...<eos> Anyway, we have to get...<eos> Son, you can't leave.<eos> We've searched the stars to find you.
Son, you can't leave.<eos> We've searched the stars to find you.<eos> And we must get to know Kara as well.<eos> And I would love to know more about you.<eos> I knew you wouldn't stand in the way of a family reunion.<eos> We have much to discuss.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Hey, Maggie!<eos> My favorite pool shark.<eos> What can I do you for?
Were you at the national city art museum last night?<eos> Briefly.<eos> What did you do while you were there?<eos> Looking at some art.<eos> - In the middle of the night?<eos> - The lines are shorter.<eos> Winn, come on.<eos> Okay, fine. Fine.<eos> Lyra and I, we broke in after hours.<eos> It's just, like, when a beautiful woman asks you to do something, you gotta do it!
Hey!<eos> Look at that photogenic fella.<eos> Wait, where's my girlfriend?<eos> You get how that looks, right?<eos> So, let's review.<eos> You've admitted to being at the scene of a crime, and the security footage doesn't show anyone else but you.<eos> Any thoughts?<eos> I think I'm gonna need that one phone call.<eos> Where's that appetite of yours?<eos> Aren't you happy to see us?
Mon-El, you remember how well your servants were treated at the palace.<eos> Just like family.<eos> Because you stole them from their families.<eos> We liberated them from greater hardship.<eos> We gave them a path.<eos> How did you escape the blasts?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> When Krypton exploded, the kryptonite rained down, killing everything.<eos> We had to get off planet to persevere.<eos> And to find you.
We gave them a path.<eos> How did you escape the blasts?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> When Krypton exploded, the kryptonite rained down, killing everything.<eos> We had to get off planet to persevere.<eos> And to find you.<eos> So that we might return, now that the atmosphere is hospitable.<eos> To make Daxam great again.<eos> Daxam was never great.<eos> Has the Kryptonian rubbed off on you so much so that you have forgotten?
So, you survived the first dinner with the fam...<eos> - I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Can you really blame me for wanting to just be Mon-El, - a regular guy from Daxam?<eos> - Wow. With how you feel about Daxamites, if you had known that I was the crown prince, would you even talk to me?<eos> You didn't even give me the chance.<eos> I tried to tell you so many times, okay?<eos> I really did.<eos> What, is that supposed to make this better?<eos> Me being the prince doesn't change anything.<eos> Not how I feel about you...
Not how I feel about you...<eos> This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.<eos> You benefited from its cruelty.<eos> What about that Kryptonian emissary?<eos> Your guard...<eos> Do you even feel guilty?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I can't even look at you.
She doesn't.<eos> The crappy angle doesn't even show Lyra.<eos> I don't think that's a coincidence.<eos> - You think she set him up?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> When was the last time you spoke to Lyra?<eos> I mean, I've been trying to call her all day.<eos> Let me guess, her phone is disconnected.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> She framed you, winn.
Krypton made horrible mistakes.<eos> I can admit it.<eos> That's more than I expected.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Our planet died on my and my husband's watch.<eos> For our people to rise again, they need a future.<eos> Mon-El is young.<eos> He can be the face of that future.<eos> You want to take Mon-El back to Daxam?<eos> Would you rather he stay here and learn by degrees that he's not good enough for you?
You want the truth?<eos> You want to know about the 10-year war on starhaven?<eos> You wanna hear about how I watched my parents starve to death?<eos> Or do you want to know why I can't be alone in the dark anymore?<eos> 'Cause it reminds me of the six weeks I was locked below deck when me and my brother were smuggled onto earth.<eos> I'm a refugee.<eos> I'm a thief, too.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Maybe it's also true that... You were different.<eos> I liked you.
I'm a thief, too.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Maybe it's also true that... You were different.<eos> I liked you.<eos> Why did...<eos> Why did you con me?<eos> That gang.<eos> My brother, bastian, works for them, but he hasn't been carrying his weight.<eos> I told them I'd clear his debt.<eos> I didn't want to use you.
We get back Lyra's kid brother. We get out.<eos> Done and done, right?<eos> Lives saved, heroes praised.<eos> Agent schott, we have an intergalactic art-smuggling ring, and one of national city's most violent alien gangs in our grasp.<eos> - Ms. strayd...<eos> - Needs our help.<eos> - Is an admitted con artist.<eos> - Her brother is in danger.<eos> Have you ever met this brother?<eos> Or could this possibly be just another con from a woman who knows how to play you?
What are you doing?<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> I've been doing some very serious research on human relationships.<eos> And by now, in the movie, the girl usually forgives the guy for whatever dumb thing he's done.<eos> I had a nice chat with your mother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay...<eos> - What does she want?<eos> - You.
Okay?<eos> You can't take back the fact that you lied to me.<eos> - You can't un-ring that bell.<eos> - Well, I can try.<eos> Just forget about you and me for one second.<eos> Do you even understand the second chance you've been given?<eos> You thought you were the last Daxamite and you're not.<eos> Your people are alive.<eos> Your parents are alive.<eos> They need you.

Thank god.<eos> Nice job, guys.<eos> It took you long enough.<eos> Yeah, traffic was brutal.<eos> Go.<eos> This was your plan all along.<eos> I mean, if I told you that half of national city's heroes and a squad of deo agents was going to show up, were you gonna come along?<eos> Keeping secrets?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like I'm rubbing off on you.
Looks like I'm rubbing off on you.<eos> Go get him.<eos> A ring of alien art thieves and the real starry night, as promised.<eos> Just kidding...<eos> All within 23 hours and 15 minutes.<eos> Winn schott and gf exonerated.<eos> Boom. Um, as for just, like, any connection that Lyra and her brother might have with previous thefts?<eos> Well, I don't have any hard evidence, so I'll take their help in retrieving Van gogh as a sign of good behavior to come.<eos> You're a good egg, Sawyer.<eos> Leave before I throw you into holding for fun.
So, what's next?<eos> I guess bastian and I will find a new place.<eos> There's nothing keeping us here.<eos> That's it?<eos> You're just gonna leave?<eos> Don't you hate me?<eos> Not even close.<eos> So, what now?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She lied to you.
There's nothing keeping us here.<eos> That's it?<eos> You're just gonna leave?<eos> Don't you hate me?<eos> Not even close.<eos> So, what now?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She lied to you.<eos> You're just going to forget about it?<eos> Aren't you afraid she's gonna hurt you again?
Aren't you afraid she's gonna hurt you again?<eos> She didn't do what she did to hurt me.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice herself for someone she cared about.<eos> I mean, that's... That is a girl worth forgiving.<eos> Stuff's going on with you and Mon-El?<eos> - There's...<eos> - I'm not dumb, I see things.<eos> Listen...<eos> Whatever idiotic thing he's done, I'm sure... He has his reasons.<eos> You gotta decide if those reasons are good enough for you or not.

Before I lose you forever.

I'm a liar.<eos> And I really hope that you can still see the good in me.<eos> Please.<eos> Were you ever gonna tell me the truth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You just want things to be easy, Mon-El.<eos> But being a hero and falling in love, those are not easy things.<eos> They're hard and they're messy.<eos> And they hurt sometimes.<eos> - I would never hurt you on purpose...
- I would never hurt you on purpose...<eos> - Well, you won't again.<eos> - Kara, don't.<eos> - I can't... I can't do this.<eos> No.<eos> It's over.<eos> Son.<eos> We knew you would return.<eos> Well, Kara ended it.<eos> She did what's best for you.
No.<eos> It's over.<eos> Son.<eos> We knew you would return.<eos> Well, Kara ended it.<eos> She did what's best for you.<eos> It was never going to last.<eos> Yeah, did you tell her that?<eos> Enough about the Kryptonian girl.<eos> You have nothing tethering you here.
Things will be different this time.<eos> They won't.<eos> It'll be more of the same.<eos> I think about our lives there and it makes me ill.<eos> I detest who I was.<eos> I was ignorant, and blind to those around me and letting myself be propped up at the expense of our people.<eos> And I'm tired of being served and I'm tired of taking the easy way out.<eos> And I'm done being your prince.<eos> You sound just like her.<eos> That Kryptonian girl has poisoned you...
The best thing I know.<eos> And whether we're together or not, being near her, it makes me a better person.<eos> It makes me the person that I want to be.<eos> I wish you no ill will, but you should leave this planet and never return.<eos> Now send me back.<eos> Send me home, now!<eos> As you wish.<eos> Hey, hey! How you doing, buddy?<eos> Getting there.<eos> I got a little something to perk you up.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl and The Flash...<eos> Mother?<eos> Father?<eos> We finally found you.

Nice to meet you.<eos> - We used to date.<eos> - Ah, okay.<eos> - It's been...<eos> Yeah. - A lot of years.<eos> We should catch up sometime.<eos> Sure. That would be good.<eos> Sometime.<eos> I should go. And let you guys get up to whatever you've got going on.<eos> But it was really good to see you.

Or like, a hipster, up-and-coming kind of vibe?<eos> Exactly.<eos> For that kind of bounty, every low-life killer in the universe will be headed this way to take their shot.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> I'll just take them out. One by one. Hey, hey.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wait.<eos> Okay. Not that I doubt you, okay? But a series of battles with interstellar bounty hunters doesn't seem like a good way to ensure public safety.<eos> Alex is right.<eos> I want you staying out of sight until we can figure out who is behind this.

You want me to hide?<eos> Sometimes hiding is a strategic necessity.<eos> And since you asked, I too think that you should hide. 'Cause I just lost you.
Wait a second. You want me to hide?<eos> Sometimes hiding is a strategic necessity.<eos> And since you asked, I too think that you should hide. 'Cause I just lost you.<eos> Don't really feel like losing you again. 'Cause that would not be... Palatable.<eos> Hey, that's a very culinary way to put it.<eos> I cook now.<eos> I'm not going to hide.<eos> I'm the Girl of Steel.<eos> I don't bend. I don't break. I don't stand down for anyone.<eos> I know none of us can stop you if you choose to go out there, but please, as the people who care about you, give us a day to try and get ahead of this thing.
You placed the bounty on Kara's life.<eos> Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?<eos> You've become quite imaginative in your time here.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Who else wants her dead and has 300 quartz crowns?<eos> Does she seem like a person who has any shortage of enemies?<eos> I can assure you we have nothing to do with this.<eos> Okay, so, if it's not you, why are you still on Earth?<eos> Because we're hoping you'll come to your senses.<eos> Do you know how long we've been searching for you?
I can assure you we have nothing to do with this.<eos> Okay, so, if it's not you, why are you still on Earth?<eos> Because we're hoping you'll come to your senses.<eos> Do you know how long we've been searching for you?<eos> Years. Spent praying to the gods for the faintest hint of your survival.<eos> We thought we were lost.<eos> That we would be the last generation of Daxamites.<eos> But for your mother's strength, despair would have overwhelmed us.<eos> When you were a child, you used to grab my leg with both arms every time I tried to leave the room.<eos> I would have to peel you off of me like some gangly little magnet.

I would rather die than leave Earth without you.
Even to places that disagree with us.<eos> Maybe she's having trouble parking.<eos> She hates parking, she always valets.<eos> Do you want to try texting her?<eos> It's been 45 minutes.<eos> I'm sure there's a good reason she's not here.<eos> It's okay, Alex.<eos> No, it's...<eos> Look, I feel bad.<eos> I can see it was an awkward thing that I pushed you into and now...
Stand down.<eos> Come at me, bro.<eos> It was the Daxamites!<eos> Queen Rhea placed the bounty...<eos> You know, for a second there, I actually almost believed them.<eos> I mean, you're not safe.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> I mean, how?<eos> I know them.<eos> In their minds, they honestly believe that if they get rid of you, then I'm just going to go back home.
We can't take any action against the Daxamite ship whatsoever.<eos> - I have orders from President Marsdin.<eos> - What? Attacking them could spark an intergalactic war.<eos> They attacked us.<eos> I'll brief the President and wait for her instructions.<eos> Until then, our only mission is to keep Supergirl safe.<eos> Emily.<eos> Alex, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted to come see you.
- You're welcome.<eos> I mean, you... You don't know my parents.<eos> They won't stop.<eos> They want you dead and they want me to come home. And they're...<eos> They get what they want.<eos> That's why we have to talk to your mother.<eos> But J'onn just said we can't engage with them.<eos> No. He did not say that. He said we can't attack them.<eos> We can still talk to her.<eos> Then you can get her to realize that all she really wants is for you to be happy. And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, I'll contact the ship.<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Krypton on Earth?<eos> And I thought the location of our last meeting was vile.<eos> Uh, this place is sacred to me and my cousin.<eos> I thought it was the only place on Earth worthy enough to entertain you, Your Majesty.<eos> The Kryptonians were never very good at entertaining.<eos> Look. We know it was you.<eos> One of your bounty hunters gave you up.
Whatever connection you think you've found with my son during this tryst is a lie.<eos> - Hey, are you all right? - Um...<eos> I don't feel so...<eos> I should have handled this myself from the beginning.<eos> Where did you get Kryptonite?<eos> Our planet is littered with the corpse of yours.<eos> No, don't!<eos> I crossed an ocean of stars looking for my son.<eos> I'm not going to let you get in my way now.<eos> Your family awaits you.
No tricks?<eos> No resistance?<eos> You have my word.<eos> I'm sorry, Kara.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> So long as you're safe.<eos> Don't go.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Son. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to see you here.
It's done.<eos> It was you?<eos> You issued the bounty?<eos> I did what I had to do to get back my son.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I went to see Emily.<eos> What...<eos> Why? Well, I wanted to go talk to her after seeing how upset you were at the restaurant.<eos> I went to stick up for you.
We have all done dumb things.<eos> This is about the fact that you don't trust me enough to tell me the truth.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> Listen.<eos> I've thought a lot about this.<eos> You have a pattern of keeping things to yourself.<eos> You hid the truth about Emily, you made her seem like the bad guy.<eos> And then before that, you didn't tell me what really happened when you came out to your parents.<eos> And how badly they reacted.<eos> - You don't like to talk about you.

You don't have to be guarded with me.<eos> Okay? I'm not here to judge you for things that happened in the past,
He's up there because of me.<eos> Please.<eos> J'onn, I can't lose him.<eos> I want you to know that Kara Zor-El will be safe.<eos> And in time, you will see that coming home was the right thing to do.<eos> I already know it was right.<eos> If I didn't come back, Mother would have killed the woman I love.<eos> Your life will always be Rhea's responsibility.<eos> But son, you belong with your people.<eos> It means so much to them to have you back.
Ion thrusters are ready and the navigation system is set for Daxam.<eos> Take us out.<eos> You just don't know when to let go, do you?<eos> I was gonna say the same thing about you.<eos> Round two.<eos> Winn?<eos> Oh, thank God I am not in space.<eos> You are in space.<eos> Oh, yeah. I know. I mean, like floating around in space, dying.<eos> Uh, I'm here to rescue you.
I don't know all the details of your investigation, and I don't want to, but I do know that guy might be able to help you get what you need.<eos> He's waiting to hear from you.<eos> It is a transaction that you can lose from as much as you gain.<eos> It's for Renata... so nobody gives either of you any trouble on the jungle gym or whatever.<eos> Hey, Natalie.<eos> Um, I just...<eos> You should know, no matter where I am... I'll always be better than you.<eos> I'll catch up one day. You'll see.<eos> The closer you may be to a source, the better they may be, but then they have access to your life.<eos> The most valuable thing that I can tell you... is to be careful.

Let me talk to Agent Maxwell alone.<eos> How's your family?<eos> I still remember the look on your mom's face at graduation.<eos> Look, Miranda.<eos> - He's tired.<eos> - I know. - He hasn't slept for days.<eos> - I know. He just needs more time.<eos> The terror cell that took Charlie is part of the Islamic Front.<eos> We believe they're planning an attack here, as we speak.<eos> Out of respect for you and everything you taught, I can give you one more day.
Just leave me alone, okay?<eos> _<eos> Tidying up?<eos> I came here with a lot of questions. Got the answers that I needed.<eos> A clean slate... that's a powerful thing.<eos> You know, you once said I was the best.<eos> Well, saying goodbye to this is the only way I can be again.<eos> We doing this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Trainees, meet the class above you.
A clean slate... that's a powerful thing.<eos> You know, you once said I was the best.<eos> Well, saying goodbye to this is the only way I can be again.<eos> We doing this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Trainees, meet the class above you.<eos> They are one month ahead of you in their training, which means they're better, faster, and smarter than you.<eos> And more prepared for what's to come.<eos> Take a good look, 'cause these are the people that are gonna spend the day kicking your ass.<eos> In the field, you will face off against enemies who are always one step ahead of you.
Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. Asher, how are you so certain?<eos> Because I've spent the last three months of my life taking apart everything Elias ever said to me.<eos> I walked away from the Bureau... This city... My entire life, all so that I could make sense of what happened.<eos> And there is not a doubt in my mind that Elias Harper acted alone.<eos> He hated the FBI.<eos> He made his career taking apart their cases in court.<eos> The attacks were Elias' way of making a statement, and 32 agents paid the price for it.<eos> _<eos> This may seem like a game, but I can assure you it is not.
Now I know that I was wrong.<eos> Agent Parrish?<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm sure you've heard about Duncan Howell.<eos> Duncan Howell?<eos> N... no, I haven't heard.<eos> He took his own life last night.<eos> Before he did, he asked me to deliver a message to you.<eos> I thought I didn't have a choice."<eos> Does that mean something to you?
Interim Deputy Director, I'll ask you the same question... were you ever concerned?<eos> No, Mr. Chairman, I was not.<eos> Now, did either of you ever see Harper display any violent attitudes or opinions, either before or after he was dismissed?<eos> Mr. Chairman, Miranda and I will blame ourselves for not seeing the signs in Harper for the rest of our lives.<eos> His contempt for the Bureau's cases, his grandiosity, his need for admiration, his pointing the finger at others to deflect anyone from looking at him... we see those signs now, but we should've seen them then.<eos> In your opinion, did Elias Harper act alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, we've heard from over a dozen of your agents, and they all say the same thing, except for one.<eos> Why does Alex Parrish, an agent that you once described as a bright star, disagree with you?
Know what?<eos> We submitted five names, but because of your tantrum, they decided to cut from our class, too.<eos> We didn't break the rules... you did.<eos> Are you saying we had something - to do with this? - Yeah.<eos> - Of course you did.<eos> - Back up.<eos> Or what are you gonna do... give me a fake scar?<eos> Trainees, trainees.<eos> That's enough!<eos> As some of you may already know, the five that were expelled this morning were cut from both classes.
- Of course you did.<eos> - Back up.<eos> Or what are you gonna do... give me a fake scar?<eos> Trainees, trainees.<eos> That's enough!<eos> As some of you may already know, the five that were expelled this morning were cut from both classes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we know that the exercise was not fair. So...<eos> Meet your new classmates.<eos> - From now on, the 50 of you will live, breathe, and train together.
Okay.<eos> Well, who are you?<eos> Where's Samar?<eos> Samar won't be joining us.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> My name is Khaled Said.<eos> I am Samar's husband.<eos> Samar isn't married.<eos> But Haifaa, the woman you know as Samar, is.<eos> My wife, the woman you thought was your sister, has been kidnapped... Because of you.
Go build a robot.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> I did an ISP search on all the e-mails that Khaled gave us... and, um, you're wearing my shirt.<eos> Do you want it back?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know who's sending these e-mails, but I figured out where they're coming from...<eos> Croatia.<eos> In this job, you will make a lot more enemies than you do friends.<eos> We're not training you to be nice.<eos> We're not training you for what's fair.
Oh, sweetie!<eos> Look at you!<eos> You look fucking beautiful, Trin.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> Done.<eos> I say we get it.<eos> Box it up, patch it up, whatever the fuck you do with that stuff.<eos> Let's go, please, right now!<eos> You mean this one?<eos> You know it's $2,800?
What do you want to do here? Well, what do you want to fucking do?<eos> (Whimpering, sobbing) Fucking blame all this shit on me!<eos> He can take a fucking big hydraulic suck on my fucking nuts!<eos> (Meowing) What the fuck is that?<eos> Jimmy: (on computer) Hello?<eos> (Audience laughing)<eos> Hello? Jimmy Kimmel?<eos> Jimmy: Yes, yes. How are you doing?<eos> I'm doing good.<eos> How are you doing?
Bics are shit next to these.<eos> Just one click...<eos> Crickets are the future!<eos> They don't even have these in China yet.<eos> Maimouna, pack up!<eos> Get a move on.<eos> The bell's rung.<eos> It's door 206, second floor, on the right.<eos> - That way?<eos> - Okay. I'll give you a little leaflet against racism.
Oh, how could I?<eos> You know how I take my coffee.<eos> Excuse me, but they wanna see you upstairs in the partners boardroom.<eos> Tell them I'll be right there.<eos> Oh, and tomorrow is your mother's birthday.<eos> Get her something for me, would you?<eos> Of course.<eos> There is a sickness inside us.<eos> Rising like the bile that leaves that bitter taste at the back of our throats.<eos> It's there in every one of you seated around the table.
For only when we know what ails us can we hope to find the cure.<eos> I will not return.<eos> Do not attempt to contact me again.<eos> Sincerely, Roland E. Pembroke.<eos> Well, Mr. Lockhart... what do you make of that?<eos> Clearly, he's lost his mind.<eos> Our thoughts exactly.<eos> Man goes for a two-week spa vacation, and has a complete mental breakdown.<eos> Who the hell takes the waters in the 21 st century anyway?<eos> I trust you understand the sensitivity of some of the information in that letter.
I don't see anything.<eos> Did it hurt?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> Better that way.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Before.<eos> Are you a patient here?<eos> It's just, you're so much younger than everyone else.<eos> Director Volmer says I'm a special case.<eos> What about you?
But we're here to discuss you.<eos> An imbalance in your fluids.<eos> Strain to the major organs.<eos> Depleted immune system.<eos> Many indicators that you have in common with most of my patients... but I will confess I have never seen a case... as advanced as this... in someone so young.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Tell me, Mr. Lockhart... when was the last time that you actually felt well?<eos> Before you came here, when was the last time... that you even slept through the night?<eos> The mind may lie... but the body cannot.<eos> I should like to help you.
It was he, in fact, who first discovered the medicinal properties of our water.<eos> He sacrificed everything.<eos> He must have loved her very much.<eos> Yes.<eos> Like a sister.<eos> History is right, of course, to judge him on moral grounds. But, as a man of science... I can't help but admire him.<eos> The duty nurse will escort you to our isolation wing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Lockhart...<eos> If you wouldn't mind.
Eventually.<eos> Will you be okay here for a few minutes?<eos> I just have to go see about something.<eos> But I won't be long.<eos> Uh... Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> Do you know if there's a doctor here?<eos> What's that you're drawing?<eos> He won't talk to you.
You took him.<eos> Back to New York.<eos> What?<eos> They moved him.<eos> He's down here somewhere.<eos> You told me about the experiments, remember?<eos> Your puzzle?<eos> I like puzzles.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I left it for you.
Tell me... what were you doing in town?<eos> Just having a beer.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> It's all for your own safety, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> We don't believe in chemical anesthesia at the institute.<eos> The impurities inhibit the cure.<eos> But, you will find that with a proper focus... the mind can overcome any amount of pain.<eos> Trust, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> I mean, if we can't trust each other... then how can I help you?
They held me down and pulled my tooth out.<eos> They threatened me.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Because I know what they've done.<eos> There is a room full of bodies floating in tanks like specimens.<eos> These are very serious allegations.<eos> No shit.<eos> Director Volmer is a well-respected man.<eos> The sanatorium is of great importance for the local economy.<eos> Take me up there, and I'll show you what I saw.
That's it!<eos> There's nothing wrong with you!<eos> I am not well.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get the fuck off me! No.<eos> Get off me.<eos> Pembroke.<eos> Pembroke.<eos> What have they done to you?
Farm Station, stand down.<eos> Pike?<eos> You have no idea how good it is to see you.<eos> We didn't think you made it.<eos> Lacroix, Smith, watch our 6.<eos> Yes, sir. Everyone else, I said, stand down.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> Father didn't make it.<eos> How many of you are there?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Didn't have to be this way.<eos> If you were gonna kill me, you would've done it already.<eos> There's still time.<eos> Arrive level 3.<eos> - How you holding up?
I won't just sit there and watch you die.<eos> Heda... _<eos> Then this is good-bye... for now.<eos> Exit is secure.<eos> Let's talk about Mount Weather.<eos> I know you think it was your fault.<eos> Is that why you resigned?<eos> It was your fault... mine, too.<eos> Every life we honored at the memorial was lost because we trusted a Grounder.<eos> I talked you into it.
Never again.<eos> Never again.<eos> I know you're close to him... but he doesn't believe that we're fighting a war.<eos> He thinks Grounders can police Grounders.<eos> I mean, out there in the woods outside our home with a peacekeeping force?<eos> What would you do?<eos> What I wouldn't do... is wait for them to hit us.<eos> My scouts tell me that they've got 300 soldiers and not a single gun between them.<eos> Ten highly motivated men with automatic rifles is all it would take. I've got the men.<eos> You're asking me to get you the guns. - That's treason.
We were born in space.<eos> They told us the ground was uninhabitable, but they were wrong, and we've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed.<eos> Some of us have been broken by it, but most of us are still here, searching for other survivors from the Ark, trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness... a home.<eos> Our leaders believe that to survive, we need to make peace with the Grounders, but peace is a foreign concept here.<eos> I'm not going in.<eos> It's just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here.<eos> Pike?<eos> How many of you are there?
Listen up.<eos> Ok. If we want to get to Polis before the attack, we have to move.<eos> Attack?<eos> Do we have confirmation of that?<eos> We radioed, but no answer.<eos> They may already be dead, for all we know, and if they are, we need to be ready to respond.<eos> Don't make this about the missiles.<eos> This is about survival.<eos> We don't have the numbers, but the missiles in this mountain even the playing field, and you know I'm right.<eos> Even if I did agree with you, we still don't have the launch codes.

It's just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> The Grounders out there will attack this camp.<eos> If we wait, we die.<eos> 10 men with automatic rifles is all it would take.<eos> You're asking me to get you the guns.
Well, that's great... Isn't it?<eos> Ask his friend Otan.<eos> Apparently, he's there right now.<eos> I don't blame you for doubting, Abby.<eos> I know how it sounds, but it is real, and it is incredible.<eos> Everything that you worry about now... war, power... none of it matters in the City of Light.<eos> I heard you were here, sir.<eos> And I heard you made it, Hannah.<eos> I was so glad.<eos> Chancellor Pike would like to speak with you.
I'm not the same man that I was on the Ark, Charles.<eos> None of us is.<eos> I was a teacher.<eos> Now I'm chancellor.<eos> I am wondering, though, what do you know?<eos> He's threatened by you.<eos> I'm just a man who wants to save his people, no threat to you.<eos> Save us?<eos> Forgive me for being blunt, Thelonious, but I need to ask why you've returned.<eos> I just told you...
To save my people.<eos> Do you want him to think you're a fool?<eos> - You actually believe that?<eos> Ok. I'm game.<eos> How, exactly, are you gonna do that?<eos> By freeing the minds... from the bonds of physical and spiritual pain.<eos> I am here to show the people of Arkadia the way.<eos> You've lost him.<eos> Have some faith.<eos> Tell you what.
You step aside in case someone answers.<eos> I told you, no one's home.<eos> What?<eos> Bet you didn't think we'd be breaking the law together when you arrested me on the Ark, huh?<eos> This isn't a game, Nate.<eos> If we don't find out what Pike's up to, more people will die.<eos> Then let's not get caught.<eos> Chancellor Pike, good to see you.<eos> Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.
Tell me about this.<eos> I remain certain that Becca went into space.<eos> Unfortunately, it appears that she wasn't on any of the 12 stations that made up the Ark.<eos> But there were supposed to be 13.<eos> - Tell me more.<eos> - I wish I could.<eos> All I know is that it happened, that it was called Polaris.<eos> Stop that!<eos> Now you've had time to think, shall we continue our conversation about this?<eos> I already told you everything I know the first 10 times you asked me.
Um, well, I guess I will see you... at the gathering of the coven!<eos> Ooh, okay. - I'm not gonna, like, do it like that.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Just a hunch here, Mindy.<eos> Do you substitute quick, casual sex for real intimacy, just because it's the easier thing to do?<eos> Maybe with friends and associates, or even people you work with?<eos> Yeah, you could say that. But I'm trying not to do that with this new guy.<eos> Well, do me a favor and give me this new guy's number, so that I can call him and tell him to run away as fast as he can.<eos> Okay. I'm not joking, Mindy.<eos> I'm telling you this for your own good.
I'm calling the shots.<eos> Actually, I'm in charge, in case any of you have forgotten.<eos> No, I remember.<eos> I just don't care.<eos> Do I need to remind any of you that I'm a Time Master?<eos> Making discrete alterations to the timeline is what I do, so we're not just gonna charge into the past like a bull into a china shop...<eos> Half of what you've told us about the mission turned out to be lies.<eos> None of you have ever encountered Vandal Savage before.<eos> I have, and I'm telling you now, you are making a big mistake.<eos> Already did that when we trusted you.
Figure of speech.<eos> I got a feeling you guys might want to get those helmets of yours on.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> I'll provide a 25% discount to the organization which brings me the heads of these men.<eos> Can I burn some stuff now?<eos> I wish you would.<eos> - Now would be a good time...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> To kill you.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
Something you shouldn't be fooling around with.<eos> It's very interesting-looking.<eos> How about you cut the crap?<eos> To which crap are you referring?<eos> I hold two PhDs, and I'm working on a third.<eos> I'm a five-time winner of the Carlin Award.<eos> My point being, is I don't believe either of those kids you're hanging around with can even spell "physics."<eos> You know, I'm beginning to like the younger gray less and less.<eos> Either you tell me what the hell is going on, or I'm calling campus police.<eos> I'm not supposed to tell you.
But we are both tortured by this circle of death we are imprisoned by.<eos> Carter.<eos> He's lost.<eos> Get Kendra before Savage recovers.<eos> Come on, we can still kill this bastard.<eos> Kendra is the only one who can. We gotta go.<eos> Kendra needs medical attention.<eos> Gideon, get us underway as soon as Firestorm and the Atom are onboard.<eos> Get her to the MedBay now.<eos> I assure you, Dr. Palmer, there's nothing more you can do for her.
Stable, I think.<eos> Sara told me about what's happening with your wife.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was so seduced by the prospect of time travel, of adventure,<eos> I never stopped to consider the consequences of what we were undertaking.<eos> Gideon has managed to stabilize Miss Saunders's condition, but another time jump could aggravate her injuries.<eos> So we're stuck in'75?<eos> For the time being, yes.<eos> Given that, can I have a moment of your time, Martin?<eos> There's something that I would like to show you.
Be glad that you still can.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Hunter.<eos> How's Kendra?<eos> The same.<eos> So what now?<eos> Now?<eos> Now it's up to you.<eos> To do what, Rip?<eos> Last I checked, every time we try to do anything, it all goes to crap.<eos> Oh, once again I must disagree with you.
And your family will still die?<eos> So what you're really asking is, do we want to fish or cut bait?<eos> Return to 2016 and live out the rest of our lives as insignificant losers or...<eos> Make another play at becoming legends.<eos> Figure out how to end Savage and save the world.<eos> Preferably, without causing any more nuclear explosions.<eos> Savage has my attention.<eos> Look, we didn't know Carter from Adam, but if you take out one of my crew, you better pay the price.<eos> Surely Captain Hunter has a sound plan.<eos> What about you?

Okay, Mr. Laurence, I'll give it a shot.<eos> Laurentz.<eos> Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Laurentz.<eos> I'll give it a shot.<eos> Merrily We Dance. 27-apple, take one.<eos> Action.<eos> Oh, Monty.<eos> Come join me on the divan.<eos> It seems Allegra's a no-show, which is simply a bore.<eos> But I'll partner you in bridge.
But, um, let's try it a little differently this time.<eos> - Sure. - Let's try...<eos> Let's see, first of all, why don't we dispense with the mirthless chuckle?<eos> No mirthless chuckle.<eos> No, no need, really.<eos> It was a bad idea.<eos> It was bad directorial.<eos> My fault overthinking the thing.<eos> If you say so, but I'm happy to do another, maybe try her one more time.<eos> I mean, if you want that chuckle, I sure wanna give her to you.
Your feelings are not so simple.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> Roll camera.<eos> Merrily We Dance. 27-apple, take two.<eos> Action.<eos> Oh, Monty.<eos> Come join me on the divan.<eos> Seems Allegra's a no-show, which is simply a bore.<eos> But I'll partner you in bridge.
No, he's game.<eos> And gamey!<eos> Well, if he needs help, it's your job to help him.<eos> I'll have a talk with Hobie and take a look at what you've shot, but right now I've got a lunch.<eos> "Truth to these mutterings, Sestimus."<eos> Quiet, Engels!<eos> How pleasant to see you, Mr. Mannix.<eos> Your table is right over here.<eos> Thank you, Arthur.<eos> How you doing, Mannix?
I like this place.<eos> Sorry to keep you hanging.<eos> It's a tough decision.<eos> Nothing to apologize for.<eos> We said the deal was on the table for a week.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> No, I'm trying to quit.<eos> I just wanted to visit again to see if there was some impediment we could help with, or if something in the offer isn't clear?<eos> No, the offer's very clear. And very generous.<eos> We want to make it easy for you to say yes.
Aviation is serious.<eos> Serious business, serious people.<eos> You won't be babysitting a lot of oddballs and misfits, shouldering a lot of crackpot problems for...<eos> We have some kooks, sure, but...<eos> Of course they're kooks!<eos> It's all make-believe.<eos> I told myself I wasn't gonna badmouth the competition, and look at me.<eos> Sorry, Mannix.<eos> I'll stick with what we're about.<eos> Let me show you something.
It's all make-believe.<eos> I told myself I wasn't gonna badmouth the competition, and look at me.<eos> Sorry, Mannix.<eos> I'll stick with what we're about.<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> Ever heard of the Bikini Atoll?<eos> No.<eos> Test site.<eos> Just couple of rocks in the middle of the Pacific, until a few weeks ago, when we blew the H-erino.<eos> I shouldn't be telling you this.
We had a...<eos> Call for you, Mr. Mannix.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, he has it now?<eos> No, have him stay on set, I'll go to him.<eos> Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.<eos> Still do work there, for the day anyway.<eos> You make a good case.<eos> I'll let you know.
The studio's gotta be going nuts.<eos> Can we cut it off now and pick it up right here at the next study session?<eos> Okay, well, see...<eos> I'm afraid it's not that simple.<eos> And so, Baird Whitlock found himself in the hands of communists.<eos> Meanwhile, far from the crashing surf of Malibu, Eddie Mannix, torn from his lunch with a Lockheed man, hurries back to the vastness of Capitol Pictures, whose tireless machinery clanks on, producing this year's ration of dreams for all the weary peoples of the world.<eos> Hey, numbskull.<eos> Didn't you see the rolling light was on?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mannix.<eos> Can I help you find someone?
Wonders if you have a moment.<eos> Thora Thacker.<eos> Tell her I'm stuck on a call.<eos> I'll leave through the patio.<eos> Call didn't take so long then.<eos> Yes.<eos> No. Fast talkers.<eos> What can I do for you, Thora?<eos> Well, I'll be fast, too.<eos> I only wanted to notify you as a courtesy that I am running my Baird Whitlock story.
No one else knows about Hobie and Carlotta.<eos> No kidding.<eos> You're it.<eos> What kind of name is Thora, anyway?<eos> It's a name that 19 million readers trust.<eos> Don't play games with them, Eddie.<eos> Oh, nobody's playing games here.<eos> Is that big enough?<eos> Hello, Eddie.<eos> I'm notifying you as a courtesy before I run tomorrow's story.
It's a name that 19 million readers trust.<eos> Don't play games with them, Eddie.<eos> Oh, nobody's playing games here.<eos> Is that big enough?<eos> Hello, Eddie.<eos> I'm notifying you as a courtesy before I run tomorrow's story.<eos> Thessaly?<eos> Yeah, I just saw your...<eos> Ah, never mind.<eos> How you doing?
Minor injury. High ankle sprain.<eos> What did you think I meant?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> I saw your sister earlier.<eos> She was trying to resurrect some old gossip about Baird.<eos> Oh, I'm sure she was, that cow!<eos> She wouldn't know a news story if it bit her on the posterior.<eos> - Yeah, well, she's...<eos> - High ankle sprain?<eos> Is that really the best you could come up with?
You know, busy.<eos> I thought he asked to play infield.<eos> I see.<eos> Maybe we should make him honor that commitment.<eos> That's true.<eos> No, of course, you're right.<eos> Okay. Okay, I'll call the coach.<eos> Sure.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Mr. Mannix, you want me to run out and get you a bigger grip?
- Hello, Burt.<eos> Hello, Mr. Mannix.<eos> - Arne.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Listen, I don't wanna stick my nose in other people's business, but, uh...<eos> Well, I understand you've been associating with DeeAnna Moran?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we associated. Yes.<eos> But no more, no more.<eos> Don't you worry, Eddie Mannix.<eos> But, Arne, you are aware that she's...
Oh, Monty.<eos> Come join me on the divan.<eos> It seems Allegra's a no-show, which is simply a bore.<eos> But I'll...<eos> Reverse.<eos> Reverse!<eos> Reverse!<eos> I shouldn't wear scarves.<eos> It seems Allegra's a no-show, which is simply a bore.<eos> But I'll partner you in bridge.
So, it's commies.<eos> You ever been in this place?<eos> Pretty nice, huh?<eos> It's Burt Gurney's.<eos> He sings, he dances, he's got taste.<eos> You here alone?<eos> Everybody else went down to the beach.<eos> Well, all right, pard.<eos> Let's us head on back to town.<eos> You got Mr. Mannix worried sick.
On Wings as Eagles.<eos> Thora, I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> I'm sure you wouldn't.<eos> No, no, no, you don't understand.<eos> Let's sit down.<eos> I'm telling you not to run the column, Thora, for your own good.<eos> I can judge my own interest.<eos> This will be the story of the year.<eos> And it so happens the Hearst syndicate are looking to pick up a Hollywood column.<eos> And you think this will cinch it for you? You know it will.
I looked like Anne Hathaway in the last half of "Les Mis."<eos> I thought you guys knew that.<eos> I was the only one who got them in my hair down there.<eos> Lesson learned.<eos> Never buy a Fedora at Goodwill.<eos> I'm gonna tell!<eos> I'm gonna tell!<eos> This situation is FUBAR.<eos> I got to contain this kid.<eos> I can assure you, Superintendent, everyone's very excited to show you what they've been working on.
It is the perfect place to put a full-size loom.<eos> Or a darkroom for my postmortem photography.<eos> Your what?<eos> Just photography.<eos> Well, this is a fun suit, huh?<eos> What is this, gabardine?<eos> I will avenge you, Mr. Waffles.<eos> Armpit farts.<eos> He's not far.<eos> Here's an idea I want to run by you:
Yes.<eos> Ceilings hurt people.<eos> I am... stunned.<eos> I know you have to get going, Superintendent, so...<eos> And cut!<eos> All right, everybody.<eos> That is lunch.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> The teachers did everything on their own.<eos> That's very big of you to admit, Toby.
Yes, sir.<eos> Sir...<eos> - You heard!<eos> - All right, you right, you right.<eos> Not again.<eos> Mr. Zogu, Alex.<eos> We've been working on a pretrial motion for almost a year now, while...<eos> We've been working on a pretrial motion for almost a year now, while you've been out on bail and the U.S. Attorney is finally making us an offer.<eos> To be quite honest, it looks pretty fair.<eos> Our advice to you is to take the deal.
Let me tell you, sharing is overrated.<eos> If you have something special, you don't need to share it or hide it or feel sorry for the other losers that aren't as talented as you are.<eos> Never apologize for abilities that makes you better than other people.<eos> I thought this was a good teacher.<eos> My dad is gonna teach me how to shoot his gun.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe you should wait a couple years, but, yeah, better safe than sorry.<eos> Taser.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I help you?
Oh, hey, you must be the new guy.<eos> - Zack Reed.<eos> - Hey, Hal Pasquale.<eos> I teach computers and technology.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, I better...<eos> - So, are you married?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Ah. Same.<eos> But I'll tell you, some of the teachers here are fine.
But I'll tell you, some of the teachers here are fine.<eos> Oh, God, it's just so cool to have another dude working here.<eos> I really feel like my cycle's starting to sync, if you know what I mean.<eos> Uh, not really...<eos> Yeah, you and I, we should hang out sometime.<eos> I know a lot of clubs around here.<eos> It's like shooting fish off a fence.<eos> Yeah, sounds awesome.<eos> - We should do that.<eos> - Great. So when's good for you?
Or I'm going to shoot you, right here, right now.<eos> Really?<eos> Catch you later.<eos> All right, children.<eos> Listen up! We are going to proceed in an orderly fashion today.<eos> No more goofing off.<eos> No more peeing on my shoes, no more dumping paint on your head.<eos> We are getting serious.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Hello.<eos> These are very beautiful flowers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh. What do you call this flower?<eos> - Sunflower.<eos> - Sunflower.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> My name is Agent Zack Reed.<eos> FBI.<eos> Could I speak with you a moment?
Lose the pig.<eos> Hey, pig, stop following me.<eos> Look in those drawers, it could be hidden right in plain sight.<eos> Look in the desk.<eos> Ah. Great.<eos> Hey, come on, pig.<eos> I'm telling you, I don't need therapy.<eos> Are you sure about that, buddy?<eos> Could you tell me anything more about Jason?<eos> Oh, I can tell you he was always getting into trouble.
Are you sure about that, buddy?<eos> Could you tell me anything more about Jason?<eos> Oh, I can tell you he was always getting into trouble.<eos> His brother, different story.<eos> - His brother?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Kevin.<eos> - He died in a car accident.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> But let me tell you, he was smart.
- Call you later?<eos> - Okay.<eos> What do women see in you?<eos> Is it the muscles?<eos> Hey, hey, you.<eos> - Talking to Olivia?<eos> - Uh, what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, right.<eos> So that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Only if I get caught.<eos> Oh, the FBI will never stop looking for you.<eos> We like child support.<eos> You're going to pay.<eos> - How's your head, by the way?<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Time to die, funny man!<eos> Hands are not for hitting!<eos> That's what baseball bats are for.<eos> Thank you, lady.
- Oh, no, that's okay, I can handle it.<eos> - But your knee...<eos> You guys can leave, I'm fine.<eos> - Honestly, guys, you can leave.<eos> - Sure. What do we do?<eos> Mrs. Fishman, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to get you out of here.<eos> Mrs. Fishman! Wait! Wait!<eos> Wait! Please!<eos> We're here to help you, not hurt you, I promise.
Well, he stole your husband's ID and started impersonating him.<eos> He's also wearing his clothes like a fucking weirdo.<eos> We figure the same people that are trying to kill us... are the ones who shot your husband.<eos> "Us"?<eos> And who are you pretending to be?<eos> The legendary Butch Ryder.<eos> Butch Ryder?<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. We found pictures of you and your husband on Butch's tablet.
Okay, bub.<eos> There's 150 grand in here.<eos> That's over double what I owe Amex.<eos> So just take the rest, pay for your medical bills.<eos> Fuckin' buy a suit, maybe a 3D flat screen.<eos> Fuck, take it all, move to Maui.<eos> You know Hawaiian chicks love to fuck guys with red beards.<eos> I made that up, nobody does.<eos> Look, we're in a Rubik's Cube of shit right now, and it's up to me to make all the right moves.<eos> Walking you inside that crowded hospital ain't one of 'em.
A drug that replaces chemo... would ultimately cost them... trillions.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What?<eos> Make sure all my money goes to cancer research.<eos> You can... have my Nikes.<eos> I know you had your eyes on them.<eos> You really are a good guy.<eos> Tell Mama I'm comin'.<eos> Shecky! I forgot to ask you, who killed you?<eos> Shecky! Who did this to you?
- Leonard, I taught your dogs to lay down!<eos> It's a great trick.<eos> All you got to do is shoot them through the head.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, leonard, I--<eos> - I didn't think this was gonna happen.<eos> - Hap and leonard,<eos> Come out and play!<eos> - Here, buddy, you hungry?<eos> There you go.<eos> Can I help you? - Jeez, sorry, sir.
- Yeah?<eos> - Remember when I told you you weren't my type?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Just wanted you to know I meant it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hap collins?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Jack divit, fbi.<eos> Sheriff's office got a statement from you.<eos> Now that you're feeling better, we'd like to get one too.
- All my life I've not had a choice. - (BABY CRYING)<eos> I've been told what to do and what my feelings should be, and for once it was my choice.<eos> And I did what I felt to be true.<eos> And I felt what you must feel every day.<eos> I felt power over a man.<eos> What kind of power is that over a condemned man?<eos> Compassion, that is what lies in our heart.<eos> Not mine, father, mine's full of hate.<eos> You cannot follow hatred, that's what leads to everything we've just been through.<eos> You withhold your forgiveness for a man who faces execution, and ask me to grant you the Lord's forgiveness?

Oh, my egg head is pickled, muh-oyvic.<eos> Did you sleep here all night?<eos> Yes, you are right, I did.<eos> Valentine's Day, you see, is quite difficult for me.<eos> I saw that Stephen Hawking movie and all I could think is,<eos> "He's got a girl?" Give me a frickin' break.<eos> Two girls.<eos> Oh, I'll never win and I'll always have to only be looking.<eos> Listen, pal, I've had plenty of experience with one woman.<eos> And I can tell you, relationships are just trial and error.
I've changed my height, I've changed my eyes, my relationship status--<eos> I-I don't know why I put "unavailable" there.<eos> That certainly did not help matters.<eos> But now it is time to change my voice...<eos> Oyce... Voy...<eos> And the hoyvin and the flayvin are now "hasta la vista, Frinky."<eos> Ooh.<eos> Mm...<eos> I'm always next to the jerk who comes here to meet women.<eos> Hey, look, I get you.

Voy...<eos> And the hoyvin and the flayvin are now "hasta la vista, Frinky."<eos> Ooh.<eos> Mm...<eos> I'm always next to the jerk who comes here to meet women.<eos> Hey, look, I get you.<eos> You broke up with a long- time high school boyfriend 'cause he just wasn't going anywhere.<eos> Then you play the field, but it's all losers who just want to take from you.
Okay, we just... please.<eos> Please leave us alone.<eos> You just... you stay away from us.<eos> Why don't you come with me, son?<eos> Back to my house, and we'll call someone.<eos> Please go away.<eos> - Leave us alone. - Okay.<eos> Yeah, I did leave this number.<eos> He's been missing since last night. Dylan?<eos> - Is he there with you?
- Is that right?<eos> - Uh-huh. You know you were lost?<eos> No, I... I don't remember anything.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> Oh, only an hour.<eos> Is my mother here? No, you were brought in alone.<eos> Can you just undo these?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Only the doctor can.<eos> Now, we're trying to get you admitted, but we're pretty crowded, so just try to relax, and the doctor will check on you in a little while.

I think something bad has happened to her.<eos> Doctor'll check on you in a while.
Who's in charge here?<eos> I want to talk to his doctor right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> We won't know anything for a long time.<eos> They just got started.<eos> Let's get comfortable.<eos> Do you know how long I've been sitting out there waiting to talk to you?
Sit down.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> We won't know anything for a long time.<eos> They just got started.<eos> Let's get comfortable.<eos> Do you know how long I've been sitting out there waiting to talk to you?<eos> This is a county facility.<eos> We're underfunded and overcrowded.<eos> If you want to complain to somebody, call your county commissioner.<eos> Now, I've some questions I'd like to ask you about your son.
Are you a Christian Scientist?<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Thank you for your information.<eos> Can I take him now?<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> He is under observation.<eos> - Can I at least see him?<eos> - Not until we've assessed him.<eos> He's my son.<eos> What right do you have to tell me that I can't see him?
I'll check you in.<eos> I'm sorry you had to wait.<eos> I've been running the motel by myself the last few days, and my son's out of town, and the girl who usually helps me out... well, she needed some time off.<eos> You mean Emma?<eos> Yes, do you know her?<eos> I... spoke with her in the village the last time I was here.<eos> Nice girl.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Okay, Ms. Ellis.<eos> Um, I'm going to put you in room five.
- Yeah.<eos> Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.<eos> So the guys on four, they put together this map.<eos> It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.<eos> We'd like each-- yes?<eos> What about leads on the dt front?<eos> Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.<eos> The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings. He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.<eos> He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.<eos> I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.<eos> Why ?<eos> Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 , andit'sbiggerthan Oklahomacity.<eos> Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.<eos> His name is Dallas wolf.<eos> He gets 20,000 listeners a night.<eos> We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.<eos> But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang. And the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.<eos> So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.<eos> Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
- I'm a huge fan of your show.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> If you'll excuse me. I have to get ready for the march.<eos> - Yes, what is it?<eos> - An "investment"? - Mm-hm.<eos> I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.<eos> They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?<eos> I'm a public entertainer.<eos> Ah... fine.<eos> So, tell me why you're here today.<eos> I'm here because of the guy I called about.<eos> He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.<eos> Butthen,he 'stellingme howhecanget highlyregulateditems.<eos> Andtalkingabout planstothewatersystem, andthreateningme !<eos> Hisnameis NateThomas, andifhe doesanythingcrazy,<eos> Did he give you money?
I don't drink spirits.<eos> As you like.<eos> American Indian?<eos> Chiricahua Apache by birth and right.<eos> Are you familiar with the West?<eos> Only through the newspapers.<eos> It is not what it was.<eos> But then what is, Sir Malcolm?<eos> How do you know me?<eos> I've been following you.
I've told no one this.<eos> I am your true friend.<eos> Then, now, and always.<eos> Then I'll unfold a tale better suited to black midnight.<eos> When I left school, I came to London.<eos> I found work at a resurrectionist's mortuary.<eos> Thus the tools of my sorry trade were all around me.<eos> And before long, my mind turned fully to re-animation and bringing those sorry lumps of flesh to renewed life.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> May I help you? Yes.
- Yes.<eos> My name is Vanessa Ives.<eos> I was referred by a friend.<eos> He said I ought to come.<eos> Oh, lovely.<eos> Yes. Well, do sit down.<eos> Be back in two shakes.<eos> This way, Miss Ives.<eos> Make yourself at home, please.<eos> I'll be with you in a second.
Then why did you say small?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Politeness, I suppose.<eos> Is it impolite to have money?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I don't care about politeness.<eos> There are no manners here.<eos> If you want to scream like an animal, you should.<eos> Or cry. Or yell.<eos> There are no emotions unwelcome in this room, and if this process doesn't appeal to you, the door is there.
I might.<eos> You're not sure.<eos> You don't need the 10 shillings.<eos> But you do need interesting people.<eos> Why?<eos> - To collect. - To cure.<eos> Is there a difference?<eos> We've met before.<eos> I'm sure not.<eos> I mean, I've known someone very like you.
My ancestors...<eos> Yes. Generations ago.<eos> But that's immaterial.<eos> I'm your doctor, nothing more, understood?<eos> Come tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.<eos> And every other day at the same time.<eos> We'll begin our sessions?<eos> We already have.<eos> But... but, don't you want to know what's wrong with me?<eos> I already know what's wrong with you.
Come tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.<eos> And every other day at the same time.<eos> We'll begin our sessions?<eos> We already have.<eos> But... but, don't you want to know what's wrong with me?<eos> I already know what's wrong with you.<eos> You're unhappy.<eos> You're isolated.<eos> You think you're the cause of this unhappiness and are unworthy of affection so you've few friends.<eos> Recently you lost something you think very important.
But mostly the unloved ones.<eos> The unvisited ones.<eos> The cases that get dusty and ignored.<eos> All the broken and shunned creatures.<eos> Someone's got to care for them.<eos> Who shall it be if not us?<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Sweet, may I have a moment?<eos> Of course.<eos> Mr. Dudman, may I present to you Miss...
Fistfuls of flesh they ate and ate.<eos> So he comes for me... the Wolf of God.<eos> And the other one, the grey wolf.<eos> That I can't say.<eos> Shall I send some of these ones after him?<eos> No.<eos> No. He's too strong.<eos> What do you fear?<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> I can smell it on you.
Leave her be.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She'll never be happy sitting by the fire in your loveless mansion.<eos> Let her be. And let this wretched world end and let another begin.<eos> The world of the night.<eos> The world of the bat and the owl and the spider.<eos> The blessed dark.<eos> He's a handsome man, your master. Ah.<eos> Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.
Goodbye, Dorian.<eos> I hope they watch over you.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> And I'll be here.<eos> I'll always be here.<eos> You are painfully true to form in every instant.<eos> Weak and sentimental as you have always been!<eos> I should never have left you alone with her! It was a monstrous idea!<eos> We're well out of it!<eos> Fine words from you, who traffics in stolen corpses and dead flesh!

It was a monstrous idea!<eos> We're well out of it!<eos> Fine words from you, who traffics in stolen corpses and dead flesh!<eos> Oh, I'll show you monsters, Victor!<eos> Walk down that corridor and open any door.<eos> "Monstrous" you may call it, but I'll continue my work until I cure every inmate in this wretched place.<eos> And then you'd be happy?<eos> And then you'd get the acclaim and affection that's eluded you your whole life?

According to the old maps, the slaughterhouse is down that alley.<eos> This whole block's been condemned, so God knows what we'll discover.<eos> But whatever happens... Find Vanessa.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Yes.<eos> You take the front.<eos> Kaetenay and I will find our own way in.<eos> You're sure that's wise?<eos> We work best alone.<eos> It has been an honor to hunt with you.
My daughter's life meant no more than that?<eos> No more than that.<eos> Although, her flesh was sweet.<eos> And I enjoyed her.<eos> - You should go.<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> We're all doomed in this place.<eos> Makes a change for a Tuesday, though.<eos> Fuck him.<eos> I die proudly alongside all of you.
Would you like to see it?<eos> She seems so sad to me.<eos> She's in love.<eos> Why is that sad?<eos> Because it never lasts.<eos> He doesn't seem to have any doubts.<eos> He's not showing you his eyes.<eos> But just because it doesn't last... doesn't mean it isn't love.<eos> We should get back.<eos> May I get you a drink?
What am I looking for?<eos> Anything, any irregularities.<eos> What are you thinking? I'm thinking it wasn't me he was after. It was our clients.<eos> That's how he stayed one step ahead of us the whole time.<eos> He knew everything about me, about us.<eos> Christopher is Mr. X.<eos> Our security protocols have been changed.<eos> We've been hacked.<eos> We are confident we'll be able to meet the payment schedule this month.<eos> Yes, I know what the penalty is, but I can assure you we will absolutely make our delivery date.
He can help us.<eos> I am not going to sit in his supervisor's office telling a roomful of smug FBI agents what happened to me... what I let happen to me.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Just give me till the end of the day.<eos> I'll find something.<eos> Now are you ready to talk?<eos> You've been following me?<eos> Was that his car?<eos> Who is he to you?<eos> Did he take something from you?

Oh, sorry. Would you mind?<eos> You might want to take off your shoes.<eos> I wasn't looking for investors at first.<eos> But without them, a scalable version would take years.<eos> And, as you know, with the drought, we don't have years.<eos> Super-easy to use.<eos> The membrane... eh? ... removes all the salt and dirt and whatever we've been poisoning the fish with... allowing you... to drink it.<eos> I'll go first if you want.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I believe you.

Please.
I work here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Explosion, victim, cop.<eos> I got this.<eos> You think this victim might be connected...<eos> Yeah, it might be.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Ms. Durbrige, uh, good news, no broken bones from the blast.<eos> Uh, you're a very lucky woman.<eos> Do you have, uh, any idea who'd want to do this to you?
Uh, you're a very lucky woman.<eos> Do you have, uh, any idea who'd want to do this to you?<eos> I just asked her that. Hmm.<eos> Do you two know each other?<eos> No. Uh, yeah.<eos> We're married.<eos> Anyway. Uh, any ideas?<eos> I don't know. Who knows?<eos> I mean, half the world hates me because I'm rich, and the other half hates me 'cause the friggin' paparazzi love to make me look like a bitch.<eos> So you really have no idea who may have wanted to harm you?
Maybe. But even if it is unrelated,<eos> Vincent's files were stolen, too. Which means the hackers might not know what they have yet, but if they figure it out...<eos> Vincent could be exposed anyway.<eos> Either way, he's at risk. So the sooner we find out who's after Bootsy, the sooner we get his files back before it's too late.<eos> That's odd.<eos> Durbrige's heart rate just jumped.<eos> Hold it, freeze!<eos> Well, bright side?<eos> Well, everything seems fine.<eos> You still feeling light-headed? A little.

We saved lives, and we brought in a bad guy.<eos> That's pretty good for one day, right, Captain?<eos> - Suck up.<eos> - I do not know how to even begin to thank you guys.<eos> I mean, you saved me, my family, the witnesses.<eos> I am curious, though. How come that helicopter didn't take off?<eos> Everybody has secrets, right? Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Whatever it is, it's safe with me, believe me. I owe you.<eos> What about you?
He saved my life, and I never would have survived without him.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I can't hate him.<eos> Why else would you fall for him?<eos> He did everything right.<eos> And you dove through a hole in the universe for me!<eos> You're not Will.<eos> Will died saving Jemma... from me.<eos> Now you know how it feels, Coulson... to watch someone you care for bleed out right in front of you.
Can I ask, why here?<eos> I want him to see where it happened.<eos> Besides, I wasn't about to give him the location of our base.<eos> And apparently, he didn't want to invite us to his house.<eos> All clear.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - Director Coulson.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> Long overdue.<eos> Rosalind spoke highly of you.
She believed that I should be working with S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> I did always value her judgment.<eos> I'll miss her.<eos> I assume we're not here to share memories of a fallen friend.<eos> This... this problem...<eos> Rosalind said you called them Inhumans?<eos> Heads of state calling, not sure what's happening.<eos> Watchdog agencies hurling accusations.<eos> Fox News won't shut up.<eos> I don't need to tell you how delicate the situation is, but we have to do something.
We've got a team on the ground, and we're here to help.<eos> I don't know how it is that your agency still exists, nor do I want to know, but I appreciate your help.<eos> Does that mean you're reauthorizing S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> The public has a short memory but not that short.<eos> The image of Helicarriers crashing down on the nation's capital is hard to forget.<eos> Then why is this meeting happening if S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't exist?<eos> Because I need you to keep doing what you're doing.<eos> Privately.<eos> Publicly, the ATCU will still be the face of my administration's response to advanced threats.<eos> I'll appoint a new head to the agency, one who understands they answer to you.
I'll appoint a new head to the agency, one who understands they answer to you.<eos> So we're your black-ops response.<eos> Isn't black ops where you feel most comfortable?<eos> I certainly prefer it to bureaucracy.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We'll keep doing what we do, and you'll keep pretending we don't exist.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - One last thing.<eos> Gideon Malick.<eos> I can't help you.
He advises world leaders, he served on the World Council, he spent a lifetime and a fortune building influence.<eos> I can't pull that thread.<eos> But you can let him walk free?<eos> Rosalind bled to death right here.<eos> Malick may have blood on his hands... but my hands are tied.<eos> Yours are not.<eos> Is there any intel you're willing to give?<eos> Never spent enough time with the man to get in his head.<eos> Listen, I'm aware of your sacrifices.<eos> I thank you for your service.
I've dispatched a team.<eos> We need to replace our losses.<eos> Dr. Garner did a lot of damage, and our guest needs Inhumans.<eos> You have doubts.<eos> He can barely stand, doesn't speak.<eos> Because he spent hundreds of years clinging to life, trying to survive on the few men we were able to sacrifice every few decades.<eos> But I'm not a fool.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> I don't want my faith to be misplaced.<eos> Sir, he's asking for you.

I'm not hungry. And water.<eos> We live next to a lake.<eos> Which the Grounders have poisoned.<eos> We're filtering at the pump, but that can't keep up with demand, so that means no alcohol.<eos> How sure are you that the debris from the 13th Station fell into the ocean?<eos> A.L.I.E. and I ran the trajectories a thousand times, literally a thousand times.<eos> But what is the actual probability that you're right?<eos> Between 75% and 80%.<eos> Not good enough. Keep looking.<eos> I told you, this is as good as it gets.
Well, most of these crates are less than third capacity.<eos> I don't know what kind of outfit Chancellor Griffin was running around here.<eos> Kind that wasn't planning on a war footing for life.<eos> A word?<eos> You don't really believe you can make enough bullets to stop all the Grounders, do you?<eos> I have to.<eos> No.<eos> You need to turn yourself in and end this blockade.<eos> Is that why you're here, to run this plan by me?<eos> No, I'm here because I have a responsibility to speak to you like someone who understands this world in a way that you don't.
You need to turn yourself in and end this blockade.<eos> Is that why you're here, to run this plan by me?<eos> No, I'm here because I have a responsibility to speak to you like someone who understands this world in a way that you don't.<eos> The only way this doesn't end with us dead is you doing the right thing.<eos> Like you all did the right thing when you turned in that boy Finn?<eos> You surrendered one of the young lives you swore to protect, and the Grounders did what they always do.<eos> They betrayed you.<eos> There's only one way for this war to end... we put the Grounders down and keep them down until they know better than to take one more step in our direction.<eos> You've become a dictator, Charles.<eos> You realize that, don't you?

I was thinking you.<eos> Well, we were just talking about how I'm a drunken idiot.<eos> Pike put Monty in charge of internal surveillance.<eos> My guess is, he's got him in on electronic security, as well, which means we don't have to crack Pike's password, just Monty's, and who knows more about Monty than you?<eos> Sounds like a terrible idea.<eos> I'm in.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, anyone followed?<eos> No.<eos> What about you?
He says he's ready to talk.<eos> You have something to say?<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> On the Ark, you taught your students about the promise of our future, about the responsibility our descendents would bear when they finally set foot on the ground.<eos> We didn't start this war, but you can be damn sure I intend to finish it.<eos> I want immunity.<eos> I'm the chief engineer, and this camp needs me.<eos> That's up to Pike, but it shouldn't be a problem.<eos> What happened to you, Charles?
No matter.<eos> When I am Heda and the king bows to me, you and every last member of Skaikru will die.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Hey... _<eos> You inspire them.<eos> I'm not gonna let you give up, either.<eos> Chancellor on deck.<eos> I thought I had more time.<eos> I'm not here for you.
Please say you still have your radio.<eos> If we respond and Pike's listening...<eos> Go to channel 7.<eos> "Please say you still have your radio." That's 7 words after the word "trouble."<eos> It's code.<eos> Go to 7.<eos> Bellamy, are you there?<eos> Monty, it's Kane.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Pike knows that I helped you get out.
I can make it stop.<eos> I can lead you back to the City of Light.<eos> All you have to do is submit.<eos> No!<eos> I submit.<eos> Completely, Raven, permanently.<eos> No!<eos> Yes! I submit!<eos> Please... oh, please...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
This is unity, like you always wanted.<eos> Everyone back away, or the Commander dies. Thank God.<eos> Briggs, Grant, get behind me.<eos> You're Farm Station.<eos> There are no stations here, just the City of Light.<eos> Join us, Charles, please. There's no more need for fighting.<eos> We both know there's no way in hell I'm taking that thing.<eos> Sorry it has to be this way. No!<eos> No.<eos> How about you, Marcus? We need him.
That was a mistake. I don't think so.<eos> You will.<eos> Let me go!<eos> We are still experiencing a 3% rejection rate.<eos> Don't put Marcus with the others. Leave him to me.<eos> She can be persuasive.<eos> Chancellor, Dr. Griffin.<eos> Thank you for coming, Charles. I didn't know I had a choice.<eos> So what is all this?<eos> What I'm about to tell you is classified. If you tell anyone any part of it...
I need you to teach a crash course in wilderness survival... farming, hunting, building shelters.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, can I ask why?<eos> We're sending them to the ground.<eos> We have 99 prisoners here.<eos> We've divided them into small, more manageable groups.<eos> They'll be dead the moment the door opens.<eos> The ground won't be survivable for another hundred years or more.<eos> What did you find? Tell me.<eos> We're only telling you what you need to know, Charles, nothing more.
There we go.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who knows?<eos> It may do the same for us someday.<eos> Ahh... voilà... the difference between life and death.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to tell us the key to surviving on the ground.<eos> No, not really. No.<eos> Ms. Blake, how about you?
Previously on "Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Your APB's been lifted.<eos> You could go back to your old life if you want.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's pretty interesting here.<eos> I'll appoint a new head to the ATCU, one who understands they answer to you.
Sitting around a conference table, singing "Kumbaya" is not going to accomplish a damn thing.<eos> I'm less interested in the symposium than I am with the intel we can gather there.<eos> We need to know if any of these countries are harboring inhumans.<eos> So it's a sneaky, little spy mission.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D., remember?<eos> That's how we roll.<eos> May, I've got one.<eos> No joke.<eos> My gut tells me Malick will have a presence there... someone in his pocket trying to influence the delegates while getting information on any inhumans.<eos> Sounds like you.
Lincoln, enough!<eos> Stand down.<eos> That's an order!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing? !<eos> It's Creel.<eos> He was trying to assassinate you.<eos> Assassinate me?<eos> He's here to protect me.<eos> His absorbing powers don't seem so impressive now, not with all the inhumans around.<eos> Mr. Creel, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
The host must be dead.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm afraid this old body wouldn't be the right choice.<eos> Perhaps Giyera... an inhuman.<eos> I cannot inhabit inhumans.<eos> We cannot feed on our own kind.<eos> Well, I'm sure I could find a volunteer.<eos> Grant Ward will serve my needs until we're ready.<eos> Very well, then.<eos> I can assure you there won't be any more setbacks.
We have so much to learn about these creatures.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen.<eos> That's our guy.<eos> Because he called them "creatures"?<eos> Could be a mistranslation.<eos> Because he's Russian, And he's probably in cahoots with that Sushiyaki.<eos> Yakimura?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Talbot and I will find out what we can at the reception.<eos> The rest is up to you once the symposium starts.
So sorry.<eos> Um, there's something going on with Creel's DNA sample.<eos> I could really use a doctor who understands inhuman biology.<eos> Well, I happen to have one of those right here.<eos> Go do your thing.<eos> We're gonna pick this up right where we left off.<eos> Have a seat, please.<eos> I trust you've all had a chance to recover, freshen up from that reception.<eos> I got to say, it's nice to finally put a series of faces to all your unpronounceable names.<eos> Uh, okay, well, on behalf of president Ellis, I'd like to thank you all for gathering here.

Talbot, stop this.<eos> This man has violated our lives, he's violated our rooms, and he's violated our trust.<eos> He's a liar...and a fraud.<eos> This man is not Dr. Sean Lundwall.<eos> His real name is...<eos> This is Phil Coulson the director of Hydra.<eos> You're the inside man.<eos> Kumbaya.<eos> I hate to be a buzzkill, but this is a gun-free zone,<eos> So I'm gonna have to take that off you.
Don't you think Dr. Garner would have liked to have had a choice?<eos> All I know is that if the government got their hands on a vaccine, it won't be a choice.<eos> They will wipe us out.<eos> We do not have a disease, Lincoln.<eos> Technically, it is a disease.<eos> I studied this.<eos> Any disturbance of structure or function of the body...<eos> Oh, boy, someone went to med school, so, everyone, shut up and listen.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't hacking my way through life.<eos> Some of you know me.

You know the good works that my foundations do.<eos> Some of you don't know me yet, but you will.<eos> We'll work together to do good for the world.<eos> But what do you know of Phil Coulson, a man who claims to feel compassionately about these inhumans?<eos> Let's peel away some of the layers and see what's inside.<eos> Phil Coulson is no friend to the inhumans...<eos> In fact, he'd like to exterminate them, which is why he was trying to manipulate this group into putting them all in one place.<eos> He's lying.<eos> That's not what I want... that's what he wants.<eos> You're all welcome to believe him, but my reputation speaks for itself.
I never knew where we were gonna sleep, or if the beds were gonna be clean, or stains on the toilet or whatever.<eos> But when they pulled over to get gas, they'd let me go inside the store to get a piece of candy or an ice cream or something.<eos> That made me happy.<eos> Like, maybe life is all crazy, but... - at least you can get snacks, you know?<eos> How you sleeping at night, Joseph Caputo? Pretty good?<eos> -I'm sorry?<eos> -I'm Crystal Burset.<eos> Sophia Burset's wife.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I'm here to give you a chance to fix this before I call Lambda and the ACLU.
Now, look, I know I'm a little bit famous outside of here.<eos> The powers-that-be made a fuss and made some assumptions, but I didn't ask for this.<eos> You didn't turn it down.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna pitch a fit for my own discomfort.<eos> Lord, call me crazy, but I have learned, if someone is offering you something nice, you shut up and say "thank you."<eos> You can't shut up and say "thank you" at the same time.<eos> The two things negate one another.<eos> Oh, a dog with a bone, huh?<eos> It's the principle of it.<eos> But you're probably used to having your asshole polished by everyone you meet.
- Thanks to you, Linda.<eos> - No, thanks to you.<eos> No, this is you.<eos> - All right. - I guess both of us.<eos> Nice work, Joe and Linda.<eos> What do we got, uh, sandwiches?<eos> Sandwiches.<eos> -Do you wanna...<eos> -Yeah, let's go.<eos> - Yeah. - After you.
Stop crying.<eos> Remember? Crying makes you ugly and weak.<eos> We got each other.<eos> Ow. Jesus, Dwight!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I think I should go to medical.<eos> I should come with you.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Get off me, man!<eos> It looks amazing on you.
Previously on Penny Dreadful...<eos> I was introduced to a woman who saved my life.<eos> A mental doctor.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> May I help you?
Previously on Penny Dreadful...<eos> I was introduced to a woman who saved my life.<eos> A mental doctor.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> May I help you?<eos> I'm here to see Dr. Seward.<eos> Take a seat, Miss Ives.<eos> There are no emotions unwelcome in this room, and if this process doesn't appeal to you, the door is there.
Soon, he will kneel to us.<eos> This sad little world is ours.<eos> You must help me destroy her.<eos> What if I could tame her?<eos> Tell me about Vanessa Ives.<eos> I don't know anything!<eos> I don't know anything!<eos> You will open her secrets to me.<eos> My name is Dracula.<eos> You are aware, sir, of the extremity.
I don't know anything!<eos> I don't know anything!<eos> You will open her secrets to me.<eos> My name is Dracula.<eos> You are aware, sir, of the extremity.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, sir, the illegality.<eos> I mean, sir, we butcher 'em.<eos> I believe that's what I'm paying for.<eos> Well, I hope you have a memorable evening, sir.
Didn't want to scratch my hand.<eos> You mean you didn't want me to see you scratching your hand.<eos> The gloves are to remind you but the itch is still there.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I record my sessions for later review, saves taking notes.<eos> I've never heard my own voice.<eos> You wouldn't like it.<eos> No one does.<eos> These are for my ears only.<eos> It makes you uneasy.
Indirectly.<eos> What directly then?<eos> It's hard to say. Can you turn that off?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me your story.<eos> And if it involves murder?<eos> Then let it.<eos> And much beyond that.<eos> What's beyond murder?<eos> If you credit my story... if you believe the things I tell you, you'll never sleep quietly again.
Do all your people speak so enigmatically?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ethan came to me with blood on his face.<eos> The blood of my brothers and sisters and children.<eos> He wanted to die.<eos> He wanted me to take his scalp and wear it on my belt.<eos> And why didn't you?<eos> I thought it crueler to let him live.<eos> Have you ever hated a man so much you wanted him to suffer alongside you for all your days? So you could watch it.<eos> Such was your anger from what they had done to you and your family.

Teeth are decaying, indications of incipient scurvy.<eos> Pulse is... extremely elevated... And highly agitated.<eos> A monster, would you say?<eos> I've seen monsters.<eos> Well, violently deranged at least?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, let us see what miracles we can work.<eos> Mr. Balfour.<eos> Will you not greet our guest?<eos> I could do with some water, sir... if you're so inclined.
I could do with some water, sir... if you're so inclined.<eos> Honestly, no.<eos> It doesn't have the spark of life.<eos> Needs more shine to the eyes.<eos> That's it. More sense of nocturnal danger, I think.<eos> - Afternoon post, sir.<eos> - Ah, thank you.<eos> Keep at it, Phillip.<eos> Nocturnal danger, yes?<eos> Dear Dr. Sweet. If you're in mind to have an adventure, please meet me at the address noted below at 7:45 tonight.
How I've missed you.<eos> I've always loved the ocean and felt great affection for creatures of the deep.<eos> I suppose it goes without saying that they don't actually get so big, squids, I mean.<eos> Cephalopods are delicate little things, in fact.<eos> Well, do you favor some coffee?<eos> Simpson's is open, I think.<eos> Perhaps another time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Of course.<eos> May I get you a cab?
Mirror images.<eos> She wants us to build a gateway out of a mirror. Yeah.<eos> I believe we have one stored behind here.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, all this, this is, um, your personal library?<eos> Uh, not all mine.<eos> It's been cultivated over the centuries.<eos> First by the Founding Fathers, and most recently by the late Sheriff August Corbin.<eos> All... vital tools for the war against evil.<eos> Believe it or not, I know how you feel.
You're lucky that your government intervened -- that Interpol was brought in at all.<eos> For something as serious at this?<eos> Three highly decorated members of the Russian government, murdered in cold blood, on Russian soil, by former S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents.<eos> In another time, we would have found you three feet below the ice -- if we found you at all.<eos> You must have something to say for yourself.<eos> I'd like a cheeseburger, medium, with cheddar cheese, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, and tomato.<eos> And some curly fries.<eos> Crispy.<eos> Ms. Morse I'm your only ally here.<eos> There's no one else to help you, nowhere to run.
Hey, at least you look the part, dear.<eos> He's not wrong.<eos> Bobbi, you're with Daisy and Mack.<eos> Find the security hub and locate Malick.<eos> So that means I stay here alone?<eos> You're with me.<eos> Remember our mission protocol.<eos> Low profile, in and out, no one gets caught.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going to ask you some very basic questions to establish a baseline.
Uh, let us gather, please.<eos> Mr. Malick -<eos> - Gideon -- on behalf of the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Minister of Emergency Situations, we all welcome you.<eos> We're up, sir.<eos> And we would be very grateful for your assistance because I'm afraid our shared vision of sanctuary for these Inhumans is in jeopardy.<eos> How so?<eos> The Prime Minister recently sent his personal attaché, Yuri Krupin, to this site.<eos> The reason -- to shut down this entire project immediately.<eos> The Prime Minister is against a sanctuary? Yes.<eos> Because his opposition supports it -- namely, the Ministers you see before you.
One who happens to have access to nuclear launch codes.<eos> That does complicate matters, doesn't it?<eos> We know you have a history with the Prime Minister, so we were hoping that --<eos> You were hoping that I could help you smooth over this little incident so that our dream of a sanctuary wouldn't die here today.<eos> Can you help us?<eos> The son of a bitch is loving this.<eos> He's got them right in the palm of his hand. Where is the General now?<eos> He's, uh, on site, in restraints.<eos> Must be the Inhuman Bob and I saw.<eos> I can help you.
Expose yourselves as members of a terrorist organization?<eos> Because that's what people think S.H.I.E.L.D. is.<eos> We took an oath -- to be the shield.<eos> To protect those in danger.<eos> Well, now S.H.I.E.L.D., this team, is in the cross hairs.<eos> And the right thing for us to do is... take the bullet.<eos> Are you saying what I think you're saying?<eos> We've discussed it.<eos> It's time.<eos> I'll have your things sent to you.
So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> I do not.<eos> Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work for any U.S. Government agency.<eos> No.<eos> They do not.<eos> And they never will.<eos> You satisfied, Dmitri?<eos> One last thing.<eos> I would like to thank you both for your bravery and for the sacrifice you made, giving up your vacation.
Oh, no, it's not garbage.<eos> It's a neighborhood bench.<eos> It's for the community.<eos> Do you have a permit for the community bench?<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> Is that required?<eos> -It is.<eos> If you don't have one, you're gonna have to go down to City Hall and get one.<eos> -Or I can write you a 4950.<eos> -[Maria groans] I don't wanna write you a 4950.
And all of these people were... were killed by the same man?<eos> He's tracking gangs to their home turf and taking them out with military precision.<eos> But it doesn't stop there.<eos> What do you mean, "doesn't stop"?<eos> His targets aren't random, Mr. Grote.<eos> He knows exactly who he wants to hit.<eos> And if any of his intended marks are lucky enough to escape...<eos> Say they're off buying a sandwich, or in bed with the flu... recuperating under an assumed name at Metro-General... Sooner or later, he gets to them, too.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> My office is offering you a chance to save yourself.

Well, good for you, lady.<eos> Me? I got some serious reservations about this shit.<eos> Should I be concerned?<eos> All we need is for Brass to admit he's dealing drugs again.<eos> Okay, he doesn't have to say where, he doesn't have to say to who.<eos> Just get him to confirm it. All right?<eos> Don't make it the first question. Don't even make it the second one.<eos> Get there organically.<eos> You'll be in and out before you know it.<eos> - He's got no reason not to trust you.
He is a classless, graceless, shameless barbarian.<eos> What he did to you, Elizabeth, it was disgusting.
It isn't a veterans issue. It's public health.<eos> That's not my specialty.<eos> Wait, you're telling me you don't know anyone who's had breast cancer?<eos> I mean in terms of legislation.<eos> Fifty percent more.<eos> That's how many more black women die of breast cancer than white women.<eos> In our district, it's higher than the murder rate.<eos> Help us get this clinic.<eos> I don't deny that it's an important issue, but I have to pick and choose what I support.<eos> You're in a tight race back home, Congresswoman.
Claire and I spoke at length, Mother.<eos> Claire?<eos> You're calling the First Lady by her given name, now?<eos> Well, and I would hope you would, too, Congresswoman.<eos> You went behind my back, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> I'm not asking for a full endorsement.<eos> I'm just asking for your blessing on Celia delaying her run.<eos> And of course, a promise to not campaign against me.<eos> Jackie Sharp's big on Dunbar.<eos> Why would she help you?
Then you really should eat dinner.<eos> Your medication...<eos> Please don't make me ask you again, Michael.<eos> Just take it away.<eos> The smell of it is making me ill.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady of the United States.<eos> - Celia.<eos> - Thank you so much for arranging this.<eos> It's a big honor to be sitting next to you.
- Don't tell me this is a social visit.<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, if it isn't business... - It's business.<eos> - Members of Congress...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - ... I have the high privilege...<eos> - So...<eos> - Oh, hold on.<eos> The show is starting.<eos> - ...of presenting to you, the President of the United States.
- Oh, hold on.<eos> The show is starting.<eos> - ...of presenting to you, the President of the United States.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.<eos> One year ago, when I gave this address for the first time, it was during a very different period for our country.<eos> Our nation was recovering from a political scandal and a trade crisis with China.<eos> Before you stood a president no one had elected.

In fact, just today, she called me about a breast cancer clinic she has been fighting for over the past decade.<eos> Now, her plan is bold.<eos> A VA hospital expansion open to the general public, financed by federal money.<eos> A bold plan that will significantly increase successful diagnoses and treatment through education, screenings, and affordable care.<eos> Now, she's gotten resistance, time and again... from the Veterans Affairs administration, from her colleagues in Congress...<eos> - ...from those who don't want to see government funds going to Planned Parenthood.<eos> And yet, when she called me today, she was just as passionate about this clinic as she was when she first brought it up to me ten years ago.<eos> Well, Doris, it worked.<eos> I'll be working with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, HUD and the congressional leaders to get you that clinic.<eos> Because of you, we'll save lives.
Thank yourself.<eos> You played this well.<eos> How did you play it?<eos> Well, now, that's our little secret, isn't it?<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> Uh, Mr. President, I got this.<eos> Oh, Claire.<eos> Didn't the president make the most wonderful speech?<eos> Oh, he certainly did.<eos> And I thank you for convincing the president to mention Celia in his remarks.
You keep killing high-profile businessmen and seizing their assets.<eos> - That's no... - You mean, traitors?<eos> Look, I am aware that they were plotting a coup, but that still doesn't...<eos> Yes, because you orchestrated it.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Why else would Milkin fly to America?<eos> We had nothing to do with this.<eos> You... you lied to me about the Jordan Valley, you lied to me about Corrigan.<eos> I am not trying to replace you, Viktor.<eos> I'm trying to help you.
He's fighting for you now in the White House.<eos> We wanna help him to stay there.<eos> -Amen.<eos> -Amen.<eos> President Frank Underwood! All right!<eos> You're all wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> You know, it's on a morning like this, in a church like yours, that I'm very proud to be a South Carolinian.<eos> "How many of you drove to church? Let me start by asking, how many of you drove to church here this morning?"

"Especially here in Gaffney.<eos> Now, as president, I feel responsible for that.<eos> Or maybe, I feel even more so here.<eos> You know, we've never been a rich town.<eos> You know, a lot of times in my childhood, I thought to myself, 'Why, we just, we were almost like an invisible town to people...<eos> We didn't matter.'"<eos> That we didn't matter.<eos> And, of course, I was a white boy.<eos> And as poor as my family was, we still were a lot better off than a lot of your families... who not only had to struggle through poverty but had to fight racism as well.<eos> Now, how many of you remember 1973?
I work directly with the owner.<eos> Francis really needs this win in South Carolina.<eos> He sure does.<eos> Let's release more of the strategic reserve.<eos> That might slow down the price inflation, but it won't halt it.<eos> How are you two ladies enjoying those ribs?<eos> Mmm, I'm gonna need a nap after this.<eos> Well, you'll have time.<eos> I have two hours of fundraising calls to make.<eos> It was very nice of you to let us stay at your house, Mr. President.
Come on.<eos> Get in.<eos> I just learned today that Limestone College, founded in 1845, was the first women's college in South Carolina, and one of the first in the nation.<eos> And that's something to be proud of.<eos> And since then, this school and its students have flourished.<eos> A young, eager community of men and women of all races and backgrounds, a true reflection of America's future.<eos> How did he convince you to come back?<eos> I convinced myself.<eos> Forty-six years I was married to my husband before he passed.<eos> But if he'd pulled on me what Frank pulled on you, he would've been long gone.

I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> All right, I need you to come with me, sir.<eos> -Now, hold on.<eos> -Step outside, sir.<eos> I wanna talk to a lawyer.<eos> -I need backup at 4126.<eos> -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> -Come on, that's not necessary.<eos> -Not if you cooperate, sir.<eos> If I talk to you, I won't get in trouble?
I don't have the means, but you do.<eos> You've investigated him before.<eos> You know he's dangerous.<eos> Mr. Goodwin--<eos> Why would he go after me if I wasn't onto something?<eos> This was a high-level sting operation.<eos> Major resources were dedicated to it.<eos> I'm... I was a journalist, no criminal record.<eos> How am I suddenly such a threat, unless I'm--<eos> Even if I did believe you, I am no longer part of the DOJ.
A woman?<eos> - Brunette?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, about so tall, good-looking.<eos> Wouldn't give me her name.<eos> We should get photos of everyone in Dunbar's staff that fits that description.<eos> Already compiling it, ma'am.<eos> And as for you... you're gonna plant yourself in front of as many TV cameras that can gather around that bony ass of yours.<eos> You're gonna be wracked with guilt and overcome with conscience.<eos> And you do that and I'll make sure that you aren't charged.
Come on, be smarter than that, Oren.<eos> She'll sue you for slander.<eos> Just say you were bought and people will connect the dots on their own.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> I hope you don't welsh on your promise to me the way you did with Oren.<eos> You're family, Gene.<eos> I would never betray one of the family.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Ready?<eos> Many of you voted for me for mayor because you've known me your whole lives.
He probably thought no one would ever see it.<eos> But I am asking you to empathize with his predicament.<eos> And ask yourselves... what would you do to save your family?<eos> Now, whoever stole that photograph and vandalized that billboard, they're not trying to unearth some big scandal about my past, 'cause it just isn't true.<eos> What they're trying to do is divide us.<eos> What they really wanna succeed in doing is making sure you don't vote for me today.<eos> They've gone to a whole lot of trouble to make me look pretty bad.<eos> But that's politics.<eos> My hope in coming here today... and speaking openly and honestly about this... is that we can stay united.<eos> So my plan is to stay here as long as it takes, to speak to each one of you individually, and answer every question that you might have.
I want to apologize to anyone I might have offended by hoisting up such painful imagery.<eos> We're getting calls asking if it was us.<eos> -Do you think someone from our team--<eos> -Absolutely not.<eos> I think Underwood put this guy up to it.<eos> He's trying to turn this back around on us.<eos> We need to deny, forcefully.<eos> I'm already putting a press avail together at your next event.<eos> Maybe we need to reconsider Goodwin.<eos> -What do you have in mind?
I just lost my home state.<eos> I'm not gonna rake myself over the coals.<eos> Meechum?<eos> I'm not ruling anyone out.<eos> Sir?<eos> I brought the safety deposit box for you.<eos> You can put it down.<eos> -Meechum.<eos> -Yes, sir?<eos> Have I given you any reason to hurt me?
Meechum?<eos> I'm not ruling anyone out.<eos> Sir?<eos> I brought the safety deposit box for you.<eos> You can put it down.<eos> -Meechum.<eos> -Yes, sir?<eos> Have I given you any reason to hurt me?<eos> Hurt you, sir?<eos> Have I done you wrong in any way?
Oh, I assume...<eos> Unless it's just a bad attempt at making the ship a unicorn.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Colors are nice.<eos> I hate it.<eos> I guess I hate it, too.<eos> I suppose it's not a good idea to have the Confederate flag hanging here in the White House after everything that's happened in South Carolina. Even if it is sinking.<eos> What do you think we should put up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something you like better.
Or that's just a cover.<eos> I've been in the trenches for the past year while you've been gone, and now you doubt me?<eos> I don't need this.<eos> You got this job by digging up dirt.<eos> If you can't trust me by now, I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> Are you saying you wanna resign?<eos> That is the last thing that I want, but you're not giving me any incentive to stay.<eos> All right.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Seth, I'm choosing to believe you right now, but if I come to regret that decision--
You know she can't.<eos> This isn't something you can isolate on its own.<eos> If gas prices hit $6 a gallon, you're fucked.<eos> - You lose every key demo.<eos> - We're well aware.<eos> But if the president makes Claire his running mate, it makes the conversation tactical instead of economic.<eos> That buys you time on the Russia crisis.<eos> You solve that, confidence in the president translates into confidence in his choice--<eos> I didn't call you to be convinced.<eos> I called to offer you a job.
You'll turn this campaign around.<eos> I'm surprised, Doug.<eos> I didn't think you were very fond of me.<eos> I'm fond of talent.<eos> So is the president.<eos> - My loyalty is to the First Lady.<eos> - All I'm asking is that you talk to her.<eos> I'll tell you what. I'll show Claire your research if you show the president mine.<eos> I can agree to that.<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you, Heather.
My father really liked Francis.<eos> But as my daddy, he said to me, the day before we got married,<eos> "You have one life, Claire.<eos> Are you sure this is the man you wanna spend it with?"<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said I didn't want to live my life full of doubts.<eos> Well, I think Francis wants me to doubt myself.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - My mother... killing a lizard.<eos> - I'll get the door for you, ma'am.
We're on lockdown, ma'am.<eos> We had to scramble all the--<eos> Lockdown?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm gonna need you to stay in the house.<eos> - What-- - I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> You can't force me to stay in here.<eos> There is a current, highly credible threat to your life--<eos> I need to speak to your supervising--<eos> I am the head of your detail here in Dallas, ma'am, and I've been ordered to keep you securely in this house.
There is a current, highly credible threat to your life--<eos> I need to speak to your supervising--<eos> I am the head of your detail here in Dallas, ma'am, and I've been ordered to keep you securely in this house.<eos> Listen.<eos> Blunderwood! Do you know what they're chanting?<eos> "Blunderwood."<eos> And if I were their English professor, why, I would give them all an "A" for cleverness but a "D" for accuracy.<eos> But that's part of being president.<eos> You make enemies, and you can hear some of mine just outside, right now.<eos> So, I am grateful to each and every one of you for coming out and showing your support today.
I wanna try to hear what it is that you disagree with me about.<eos> I understand not everyone's for me.<eos> - No more wars!<eos> - Go back to Gaffney!<eos> Hello, how are you? Thank you for coming out.<eos> Hello, thank you for coming out.<eos> - You're doing a great job!<eos> - We know what you are!<eos> Hello.<eos> All right, I'm here to try to listen to you, but probably one at a time is gonna be a little better.
Hello, thank you for coming out.<eos> - You're doing a great job!<eos> - We know what you are!<eos> Hello.<eos> All right, I'm here to try to listen to you, but probably one at a time is gonna be a little better.<eos> Okay, maybe we could have a conversation, more one-on-one.<eos> It's difficult to hear you.<eos> I understand what you don't believe in, but what are you for?<eos> That would be a good question.<eos> All right, how about you?
It's difficult to hear you.<eos> I understand what you don't believe in, but what are you for?<eos> That would be a good question.<eos> All right, how about you?<eos> You've been yelling at me for a little while.<eos> What do you think I should be doing differently?<eos> - You should resign.<eos> - Well, now, I'm not asking for your vote, but what would you do if you were president?<eos> You're ruining our country!<eos> I came out here to try to listen to what you wanna say, but if all you're gonna do is scream--
- How is he?<eos> They're still in the OR.<eos> Probably a few hours left to go.<eos> Is he going to live?<eos> He took a direct hit to his liver, which is partially shattered.<eos> Fortunately, part of the left lobe is mostly intact.<eos> Now, we think there's a decent chance he will survive surgery, but even if he does, that's when the real fight begins.<eos> I'd like to see him.<eos> As soon as he's out, I'll make sure you know.<eos> Okay, thank you.
Just two hours before?<eos> Less than.<eos> How did he react?<eos> He was cold, I guess.<eos> I couldn't really read him.<eos> He looks so weak.<eos> - Should I come back to Washington?<eos> - Let's see how the next couple of days go.<eos> Well, just say the word, I'm on a plane.<eos> All right, thank you, LeAnn.
I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Please, let me know if there's anything I can do for you and your family.<eos> You can call me anytime.<eos> Yes, ma'am, that is my private number.<eos> And again, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Lucas Goodwin?<eos> - We didn't know he was out.<eos> How can that happen?<eos> He's released and you didn't know--<eos> Ma'am... as far as threats go, we've been far more occupied with you lately.
Yes.<eos> My Marjory, God bless her, she said that was pure bullshit.<eos> Oh, listen to me complaining while your husband is fighting for his life.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> Actually, I need the distraction.<eos> Let's talk Russia.<eos> I'm torn.<eos> Uh, we have this plane circling over the North Sea...<eos> - and I don't know what to do.<eos> - Well, what does your gut tell you?
Am I?<eos> You're looking for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake.<eos> While he's out there causing casualties, he's our top priority.<eos> Okay.<eos> How can I...<eos> I worked with the guy.<eos> I know a few things he doesn't know I know.<eos> You mean that'll help you find him.
That's a girl outside. A girl.<eos> - Most girls are.<eos> We're expecting a boy. Where is he?<eos> - Must've been a mix-up.<eos> - We asked for a boy.<eos> - Maybe they're fresh out.<eos> - Edmond, please.<eos> Are you Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> How do you do?
Can you imagine in the moonlight how it would look?<eos> Well...<eos> Did you come in a wagon?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, that's all right.<eos> Besides, if it isn't carried in a certain way the handle pulls out.<eos> So I'd better hang onto it because I know the exact knack of it.<eos> Best to Marilla.<eos> This island is even more wondrous than I imagined.<eos> And I can tell you that's saying quite a lot.
What've you got to say for yourself?<eos> I'll accept your apology.<eos> Alright, Harry, let's get you ready for bed.<eos> Come now, child.<eos> You haven't eaten a thing.<eos> Can you eat when you're in the depths of despair?<eos> I've never been in the depths of despair so I wouldn't know.<eos> Haven't you ever try to imagine you were in the depths of despair?<eos> Why on earth would I wanna do thing like that?<eos> I can assure you, it's a very unpleasant feeling.
I couldn't send her back to the orphanage.<eos> It's a girl had enough hardship in her life.<eos> Then you should have taken her to Mrs. Spencer.<eos> After all it was her mistake.<eos> It's only for a short time.<eos> It's only until Matthew takes her into the town. We'll figure out.<eos> Marilla, I picked these down by the brook.<eos> May I put them in water?<eos> Anne, this my neighbor and my good friend, Mrs. Lynde.<eos> How do you do?
I said, I hate you.<eos> Anne Shirley.<eos> How dare you say I'm skinny and ugly?<eos> How dare you call me I'm freckled and red-headed.<eos> You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling woman!<eos> All right, that is quite enough of that.<eos> How would you like to have such things said about you?<eos> How would you like to be told you were fat and clumsy and probably hadn't a spark of imagination?<eos> You have hurt me worse than Mrs. Thomas's intoxicated husband!<eos> I shall never forgive you!
Not hungry?<eos> Maybe later.<eos> Later then.<eos> Listen, Miss Anne with an "e".<eos> My sister is a very determined woman and nobody gets the best of her.<eos> So, if I were you I'd smooth over what's between you. And the sooner the better.<eos> - Apologize?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What say you?<eos> I suppose I could do it to oblige you.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> My friend Josh Wheaton said you might be able to answer my questions about God.<eos> Well, that definitely falls within my job description.<eos> How many questions have you got?<eos> So far, 147.<eos> Is something wrong? No.<eos> Josh encouraged me to write them down and be as comprehensive as possible.<eos> Of course he did. Well, I'll have to thank him next time I see him.<eos> Come on. So, what's your first question?<eos> Grace, I just have to hear it from you.
Criminal law?<eos> No offense, but I'm not a criminal.<eos> Don't be so sure of that.<eos> Your kind of case makes everybody uncomfortable.<eos> School boards, teachers, parents.<eos> It makes them feel... yucky.<eos> Yucky?<eos> Is that a technical legal term?<eos> You got a better word for it?<eos> Grace, I'm gonna level with you.
I may have a solution.<eos> There might be a way around all of this unpleasantness that would satisfy all parties.<eos> A disciplinary notice in Ms. Wesley's file stating the school board's objections to her behavior, a response from Ms. Wesley confessing the inappropriateness of and apologizing for her actions, along with a pledge not to engage in similar discussion of Jesus in the future.<eos> I'm confident that we can move forward on that basis. No.<eos> Grace...<eos> I can't.<eos> I'd like to request a brief recess to have a word with my client.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Grace, this is exactly what we were hoping for.<eos> I mean, this is the part where you say you're sorry, thank your lawyer, go back to your classroom, pick up your life, and move on.
Thank you.<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your witness, Mr. Endler.<eos> Mrs. Rizzo, you stated that Ms. Wesley talks about her faith all the time.<eos> I'm curious, can you give me a specific instance?<eos> Well, not off the top of my head.<eos> Well, has she, as far as you're aware, ever started her class with a prayer? No.<eos> Has she ever asked anyone in the teacher's lounge to pray with her?<eos> No.<eos> Has she ever asked you personally to pray with her?
"Jesus did exist, whether we like it or not."<eos> I put it this way:<eos> Denying the existence of Jesus doesn't make him go away.<eos> It merely proves that no amount of evidence will convince you.<eos> Thank you. No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Kane, your witness.<eos> No questions, Your Honor.<eos> That's lunch.<eos> We'll recess until 2 p.m.<eos> Can I help you with something?
But if you need to talk, I'm actually a pastor.<eos> It's been 3 weeks since my doctors told me<eos> I was in remission.<eos> Oh, Amy, that's wonderful.<eos> It is.<eos> Yes. But even though I've been given this gift, I've been questioning my faith.<eos> I know Jesus existed, but I'm struggling to believe.<eos> Actually, I think you already do believe, and the proof is you're not willing to put God back on the shelf now that your cancer is gone.<eos> He won't let you dismiss the thought of him.<eos> Part of you senses Jesus' presence and wishes that he would just go away and leave you alone.
I just don't have the right to speak.<eos> - Brooke, what are you doing?<eos> - Not unless you are called as a witness, young lady.<eos> If I put her on the stand, what am I gonna hear?<eos> That she asked a question and I answered it.<eos> Your Honor, we'd like to call Ms. Brooke Thawley to the stand. Objection, Your Honor! Ms. Thawley is a minor.<eos> Her parents do not want her subjected to the emotional pressure of testifying against her own teacher.<eos> Ms. Thawley, are you willing to testify on your own behalf?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> And do you understand that you will have to answer all the questions truthfully, regardless of your feelings, and that failure to do so is punishable by law?
Why didn't you tell me about this?<eos> You didn't ask, and I didn't think it mattered.<eos> Brooke, you realize that you have to tell the truth here.<eos> You understand that, correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, what did you mean when you said that you had talks about faith outside of school?<eos> My brother died in an accident 6 months ago.<eos> Ms. Wesley noticed that I wasn't doing so well, so she asked me if everything was all right after class.<eos> I told her I was fine, but I went and found her later on at the coffee shop.<eos> And did Ms. Wesley refer you to any kind of psychological counseling?
I'm afraid so.<eos> Your Honor, given the witness's reluctance to testify, can I have the court's permission to treat her as a hostile witness?<eos> You may.<eos> Proceed at your own peril.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> Grace, I want you to do something for me, something for everyone in this courtroom.<eos> I want you to apologize.<eos> I want you to say you're sorry and that you made a mistake.
Please be seated.<eos> Grace, I want you to do something for me, something for everyone in this courtroom.<eos> I want you to apologize.<eos> I want you to say you're sorry and that you made a mistake.<eos> Your Honor, what's going on here? Do it, Grace.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Why?<eos> Why can't you do that, Grace?<eos> Because I don't believe I did anything wrong.<eos> Well, as your attorney, I'm advising you to do it anyway.
Tommy... Then what is it that you want, Grace?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell us.<eos> I want... I want to be able to tell the truth.<eos> The truth?<eos> Whose truth?<eos> And what truth are you referring to?<eos> Grace, is there some truth that you know that no one else knows?<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> The other night, didn't you tell me that Jesus spoke to you personally?

The other night, you told me that Jesus asked you something.<eos> What did he ask you, Grace?<eos> Tell all of us.<eos> I think we deserve to know.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> All that matters is that you believe it.<eos> Tell us, Grace, under penalty of perjury, what was the question that God presented to you personally that night on campus?
And we all said amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a decision?<eos> We have, Your Honor.<eos> And how do you find?<eos> We, the jury, find in favor of Grace Wesley.<eos> We are adjourned.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you.
We are adjourned.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So, you did have a plan.<eos> No, you did.<eos> You stood up for what you believed in and you held on to your faith.<eos> I don't know anybody that would have done that.<eos> They were hoping to make an example of you, but instead you became an inspiration.
Contempt of court.<eos> You failed to produce your sermons upon court order.<eos> Please put your hands behind your back.<eos> Please be gentle. He has just been released from the hospital.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What is he being accused of?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have a right to an attorney.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.

- He knew your name.<eos> And mentioned Hydra.<eos> Can't be good.<eos> May even be a trap.<eos> We'll need ground tactical at the ready.<eos> You're coming?<eos> Good. With Mack on bed rest, we could use the extra muscle.<eos> Well, he's the only one with extra muscles, but I'll come anyway.<eos> We don't know - what we're walking into.<eos> I already told you - - I'm not crazy.
We're running out of time.<eos> Daisy... this is where I die.<eos> No. No!<eos> The man's Inhuman.<eos> The homeless man's Inhuman.<eos> They're after him!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I was hoping you could help.<eos> You all right?
Why?<eos> I, uh...<eos> My family, my ancestors were taught to believe that if we managed to return you from that godforsaken place that we would be rewarded.<eos> With what?<eos> Together, we are supposed to take over the world.<eos> And what does that look like to you?<eos> You have $9.2 billion.<eos> The influence that comes with any object of your desire can be yours.<eos> That's not enough?<eos> What can I give you... that you couldn't have before?
You have $9.2 billion.<eos> The influence that comes with any object of your desire can be yours.<eos> That's not enough?<eos> What can I give you... that you couldn't have before?<eos> Look, I've dedicated my life, surrendered my life to a higher power.<eos> That's the word power.<eos> And that's what you seek -- not wealth or control or clout -- no, true power.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> Intriguing.<eos> It's time to go above ground... and finally show you what true power really feels like.
This would be in your best interest.<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> This man has my full authority to negotiate this deal.<eos> Negotiate?<eos> Gideon, there is not a chance in hell that I am gonna sell you a single share of this company, let alone controlling interest.<eos> Let me show you what will happen.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Okay!<eos> I'll give you what you want.
Oh, God!<eos> Okay!<eos> I'll give you what you want.<eos> Please.<eos> There, okay?<eos> Just... leave!<eos> Leave us alone, okay? !<eos> Please!<eos> You're confused.<eos> I said I would show you what will happen.
Do not pursue!<eos> Lincoln, where are you?<eos> I have eyes on Ward.<eos> Do not engage.<eos> I repeat -- do not engage.<eos> Lincoln, we don't know what we're dealing with here.<eos> Pull out.<eos> It's time to say goodbye.<eos> I was sure I could save you.<eos> But you were meant to save me.
I'm going alone.<eos> I can't have any more blood on my hands. Except for your own?<eos> You can't go in there without backup.<eos> Look, I brought you all with me under false pretenses.<eos> Carter would still be alive if I hadn't have convinced him to come.<eos> No one's on this ship that doesn't want to be here.<eos> But I can't risk the whole team.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just me.<eos> And if it helps, I'm not giving you a choice.

Just me.<eos> And if it helps, I'm not giving you a choice.<eos> I'm going with you to that bank.<eos> Somebody say bank?<eos> Your services aren't required, Mr. Snart.<eos> This is purely reconnaissance.<eos> We know how to case banks.<eos> We're practically bankers.<eos> 'Cept we take the money out.<eos> Yes, and when I need someone to steal something, you'll be the first to know, I assure you.
I know.<eos> You need to have confidence this will work.<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> I can't save her.<eos> Based on what evidence?<eos> Are we not empirical thinkers, Dr. Palmer?<eos> Exactly how many people have you lost?<eos> One.<eos> Who did you lose?<eos> Someone close to you?
Are we not empirical thinkers, Dr. Palmer?<eos> Exactly how many people have you lost?<eos> One.<eos> Who did you lose?<eos> Someone close to you?<eos> Who was she, Raymond?<eos> For someone who doesn't remember me, you sure have a lot of personal observations to offer.<eos> Fine, don't talk to me, but fix the suit.<eos> It's the only chance that poor girl has.<eos> I'm gonna make this very simple for you, Mr. Blake.
What? To have a crisis of confidence.<eos> As unlikely as that might seem, I know.<eos> It was 2002. I was teaching quantum mechanics and I had one particularly gifted student.<eos> He was able to solve he Ehrenfest Theorem in less than an hour.<eos> He was, quite frankly, he only student in all my years of teaching who ever made me feel inferior.<eos> That student... was you.<eos> You were exceptional.<eos> And suddenly, just like that, you remember having me in your class.<eos> I always remembered.<eos> I just enjoyed taking you down a peg or two.
Ladies first.<eos> This area's restricted, folks.<eos> I'm just looking for the ladies' room.<eos> Hope you have a plan o get him out of here.<eos> Yup, there's a maintenance elevator leads to a loading bay.<eos> I'll have Gideon fly the Waverider down.<eos> I just wish we knew what Savage was gonna do with Carter's body.<eos> Why not stay and find out?<eos> Ah, the Gareeb.<eos> Mr. Blake has told us so much about you.
I just wish we knew what Savage was gonna do with Carter's body.<eos> Why not stay and find out?<eos> Ah, the Gareeb.<eos> Mr. Blake has told us so much about you.<eos> I've located three fragments.<eos> Okay, I see them.<eos> Damn, they're big.<eos> Remember, he initial blast will create smaller pieces.<eos> You'll need to...<eos> How does Jax put up with having you in his head?
Well, maybe if you actually remembered me being your student.<eos> Right around he subclavian artery, I remembered something.<eos> How I figured the solve o the Ehrenfest theorem... wo years after I was in your class.<eos> Why did you tell me you remembered me when you didn't?<eos> Because you needed a push.<eos> So all that stuff about me being exceptional?<eos> Was probably true.<eos> The fact of the matter is, I had many exceptional students over the years, I couldn't possibly remember them all.<eos> I was pretty amazing.<eos> If that were true, I suspect I'd have given you a higher grade.
I was pretty amazing.<eos> If that were true, I suspect I'd have given you a higher grade.<eos> I meant tonight.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> On that score, I cannot disagree.<eos> What're you planning on doing with Carter's body?<eos> Oh, you'll see.<eos> Mr. Blake informs us that you were hoping to steal our master's fortune, but while money has its uses, it is not the source of his power.<eos> Then what is?<eos> Let us show you.
How the hell could Kendra know that they're there?<eos> You have to save them!<eos> - What's going on? - I don't know!<eos> When we first met, I asked you who you were.<eos> Remember?<eos> That was the wrong question.<eos> I should have asked you "Why?"<eos> Why did you seek to kill me?<eos> What could I have possibly done to deserve that hatred I see burning in your eyes.<eos> Did I take something from you?
Gideon will upload you coordinates to the Greyhill Building.<eos> Rip and Sara are in danger.<eos> We're on our way, Professor.<eos> This is a perversion.<eos> No, this is the power you have no hope of defeating.<eos> Everyone here is sworn to live and die at my command.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause to them, I am a God!<eos> I pity you.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to have people willing to follow you up to the gates of Hell!
Which is why I need you to work on finding out where history records seeing him next.<eos> How is she?<eos> Better.<eos> Believe me, it was a team effort.<eos> As was, apparently, your recovery.<eos> Well, actually, I did most of the physical work and Professor was there for emotional support.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now, if we could just figure out a way to wrest the Amon Dagger out of Savage's hand into yours.<eos> I don't think I'm exactly up to taking him on right now.<eos> No, but you will be... and we'll help you get ready.
We're sorry for your loss, Kendra.<eos> I believe Anna would be proud.<eos> As am I.<eos> Gideon, ready us for take off.<eos> Whoa, are we being chased or something?<eos> No, but I imagine that right about now, the museum has realized that their prized emerald is missing.<eos> You want me to say I'm sorry?<eos> Sorry, I don't do sorry.<eos> Which is fine, Mr. Rory, because you are owed the apology.<eos> I should have told you all before that this wasn't my first attempt to vanquish Vandal Savage, but the reason I failed before...
Previously on Penny Dreadful...<eos> You are aware, sir, of the extremity.
By the throat quietly slit in the dead of the night.<eos> By the careful and silent... accumulation of power.<eos> And when you have that power?<eos> Well, what do you do when you've assembled an army?<eos> You go to war.<eos> Don't you think it's time you told me?<eos> Told you what?<eos> You could have tracked Ethan here yourself.<eos> Why'd you cross half the world to find me?<eos> Because Ethan trusts you with his life.

Speaking in tongues.<eos> This means something to you.
This car is for whites.<eos> Indians and niggers go back.<eos> Get your filthy ass up and out.<eos> This gentleman's with me.<eos> "Gentleman"?<eos> Indians travel with the livestock.<eos> That's the goddamn law here, friend.<eos> Before you speak another word... I ask you to consider this...<eos> How valuable is your life?<eos> Do you hold it dear?
Well, I'm in mind to try new things these days.<eos> Adventuring with Captain Nemo?<eos> Not battling sea creatures or sinking frigates, exactly, but still... New horizons.<eos> I had a wife, you see.<eos> She passed away just over a year ago.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - Thank you.<eos> So, I'm just finding my feet again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.<eos> I want you to know... When I saw you at the lecture, I thought of her.
I can't leave here. I have to stay.<eos> What?<eos> Because of the stuff I did with Romeo and Darius.<eos> What are you talking about? Romeo and Darius...<eos> they're gonna be fine. What?<eos> What did your mother say?<eos> Her mother said that Rachel is exactly where she needs to be.<eos> The question is, Mr. Wasserman, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I just came to check on Rachel, make sure she's okay. Mm-hmm.<eos> It sure doesn't seem like she is, though, thanks to you.
What are you doing here?<eos> And who the hell are you?<eos> - I'm Dr. Jeffer...<eos> - I am here to bring Rachel back to the hospital.<eos> Back?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She is the definition of a threat to herself or others.<eos> From what I understand, she got a man shot.<eos> It's complicated, okay?<eos> But I thought that she was at the hospital with you.
Her boyfriend talked her into leaving.<eos> I assumed you were on board. And why is that?<eos> Well, because you prefer Rachel when she's sick.<eos> She's better at her job that way, isn't she?<eos> No.<eos> She's only sick when she's with you. You're the one who drugs her up.<eos> She doesn't stay on drugs long enough to get any better, and then she keeps coming back here, back to... to this, to... to an environment that is toxic, plain and simple.<eos> Mm. That's rich.<eos> Yeah, this place is like "Little House on the Frickin' Prairie" compared to what I hear happens at your place.<eos> What happened between you two?
Make sure that you get the proper treatment here?<eos> I understand what you're talking about, but there is this other, core issue that is not being addressed.<eos> What do you think it is?<eos> I mean, would you like to talk about it?<eos> I would really like to talk about it, actually.<eos> Rachel.<eos> You know what?<eos> She's absolutely right.<eos> This is a family matter, and I am sorry for bringing you into it.<eos> I can keep an eye on her, and I will let you know how she's doing.
Your dragon. Go.<eos> Two beautiful women...<eos> Uh, hey, Madison? I need you to go and get yourself, uh, pretty, okay?<eos> Get camera-ready, because you are going to drop the hammer on Tiffany, so go.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Oh, please, get over it!<eos> It's obvious, I know what I have to do, because when I get married, it's going to be forever,<eos> I care so much for each one of you...<eos> He's doing it again, you know, every time with Graham.<eos> Can I help you?
Yeah, no phone, no wallet.<eos> If you guys are on the show, where are the cameras? Look, this isn't part of it, okay?<eos> I'm just taking these girls out for a spin.<eos> - Yeah. - All right, but listen, I'm Darius Beck.<eos> One of us is gonna marry him!<eos> - Tiffany.<eos> - Miss, are you okay? No, she's fine.<eos> She's just had too much to...<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> I'm gonna need an answer from you, miss.
My brother and I used to play here as kids.<eos> Gideon, your daughter impresses me.<eos> She's a true believer.<eos> Well, I tried to raise her right, same as my Dad raised me.<eos> She'll play a key role in this.<eos> Well, I'm happy to hear it.<eos> How fortunate it was for all of us that I was able to find you and bring you home.<eos> Trivial thing, daylight till you spend a few centuries in the dark.<eos> How much do you remember of those years, of your many hosts?<eos> Do their memories live on in you? Why?
It was payback.<eos> That's not what we do here.<eos> Well, what was the alternative?<eos> I mean, letting him live, letting him win?<eos> Don't you see?<eos> When I killed him, he did.<eos> I knew it would come back to haunt me,<eos> I just didn't think it would actually come back to haunt me.<eos> You're gonna tell us everything you know-- about Malick, about your plans, about that thing your brought back through the portal.<eos> I should thank you.
To lure you out of the cold, as it were.<eos> You've turned your back on the very institution you were meant to serve.<eos> Our job is to protect time, thereby protecting all life.<eos> I am trying to save the world from complete destruction.<eos> You and your band of rogues have run rampant throughout history.<eos> This is why we work alone, Rip.<eos> A team is a liability you've proven that.<eos> They keep you from making the tough choices.<eos> I am here because the council refused to make that tough choice.<eos> Well, they can sometimes be slow to realize the obvious, but I've been authorized to offer you a deal.
I'm through playing it safe.<eos> This time, we do things my way.<eos> Run, punk! Run!<eos> Jefferson!<eos> Chronos' blast forced us to separate...<eos> I... I didn't see where he landed.<eos> Jax!<eos> Jefferson!<eos> All right, no need to shout I'm right here.<eos> There you are, thank God you're okay.
So was Ronald, and look what happened to him.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't... I...<eos> I can't lose another.<eos> The reason I'm constantly lecturing Jefferson is because I'm the one who brought him along, and if something happens,<eos> I'm the one who has to go back to 2016 and tell his mother that her little boy is never coming home, and I would rather die than do that.<eos> That looks sore.<eos> What happened?<eos> Maybe you should ask the lunatic you put in charge of training me.<eos> I... actually, I was hoping that the arrangement between you and Sara might be, uh... mutually beneficial.
I'm the first person to have ever seen cosmic radiation with his own eyes.<eos> You know, let's keep it that way.<eos> Snart, you better keep Valentina out of the core containment unit.<eos> You used me.<eos> You work for American government.<eos> I'm wanted by the American government. Does that count?<eos> Look, I may be your white knight just this once, but that weapon Savage has you building?<eos> He's creating a nuclear-powered monster.<eos> I know.<eos> It was sweet of you to think of me as a damsel in distress, but... I'm not the one who needs rescuing.
You better kill me now.<eos> If I ever get my hands on you, I'm gonna get all "Rocky IV" on your ass.<eos> I'm gonna remember that, comrade.<eos> We must leave now, Colonel.<eos> There's still one more intruder, and he has the thermal core.<eos> We don't need it now.<eos> We have something far better.<eos> Ugh, thank God you managed to grab it.<eos> Where was my backup, Captain?<eos> Half the team is gone... Because of you.
Stein's a lot tougher than he looks.<eos> I mean, it will take a lot to break him.<eos> That's the good news.<eos> The bad news is that our compatriots are being held in an impenetrable Soviet gulag.<eos> Get a good night's sleep.<eos> You and Dr. Vostok have much work to do in the morning.<eos> My companions from the lab... what did you do with them?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They're alive.<eos> Whether they remain that way is entirely up to you, Professor.
We should get moving.<eos> He's running a temperature.<eos> We need to find a doctor.<eos> There...<eos> And again. Good.<eos> One more time.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> He just needs penicillin and rest.<eos> Can we buy that from you?
- We can't turn around now.<eos> Don't worry. We'll get there.<eos> - I think I've seen you before.<eos> - I'm a musician.<eos> Yes, a jazz musician, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> We know the way to Gilleleje.<eos> It's five kilometers to the train from here.<eos> Would you show the way?<eos> If you help us, we'll help you.
Do you know how to use that?<eos> I was a draftee.<eos> - And you?<eos> - No, I was rejected.<eos> - How old are you, kid?<eos> They're on their way here.<eos> May I?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I apologize for our little intermezzo.<eos> I apologize that I cannot offer you coffee.
Why is the church all lit up?<eos> Someone ratted them out.<eos> Damn it.<eos> - Is the church surrounded?<eos> - All the men are in place.<eos> German security police!<eos> I know you're in there!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Again.<eos> I order you to open the door.
Go.<eos> You're a free man.<eos> Please let me go.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Say something...<eos> Mrs Itkin?<eos> They've gone now.<eos> Jacob is with us.<eos> He's fine.<eos> Wait there. I'll help you down.
You're not really a religious man, are you?<eos> I have faith in my team.<eos> That's what he'll destroy first.<eos> You said they'll worship him.<eos> What did you mean?<eos> I'm saying that those that were loyal to me now serve him.<eos> He infected them, became a part of them, and they instantly joined the hive.<eos> Mind control?<eos> You're the head of Hydra.<eos> Why would I ever believe you?
I mean, all the ancient Satanic creation myths -- they were based on him, which you knew.<eos> The Devil promises everything and then lets you destroy your own world.<eos> I sacrificed my brother to him.<eos> Still, he took my daughter.<eos> And that image... of her body lying on that floor...<eos> I failed her.<eos> What else matters?<eos> What you do next matters.<eos> Are you trying to sell me on the idea that I can set everything right?<eos> I'm trying to sell you on revenge.
May...be cool.<eos> Where's Joey?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Coulson, you need to level with me right now.<eos> We need to get you checked out.<eos> Hive can sway Inhumans.<eos> Your team may have been exposed in the rescue.<eos> Wait.<eos> Sway -- like mind control?<eos> One of you killed Malick.
The rooftop.<eos> Daisy fought Malick.<eos> I found the bodies.<eos> But you said you caught a glimpse of Ward, didn't you?<eos> So you're saying he wasn't turned last night?<eos> No.<eos> He's been turned this whole time.<eos> I wasn't anywhere close to Hive!<eos> We can fix this, Lincoln.<eos> Let us help you.
We were attacked by something very smart and very dangerous.<eos> Hive destroyed the most sacred thing for a team...<eos> Yo-Yo.<eos> My name is Elena.<eos> ...trust.<eos> When will the results come in?<eos> Soon.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I think I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> I know you want to destroy Hive for what he's done to you.
When will the results come in?<eos> Soon.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I think I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> I know you want to destroy Hive for what he's done to you.<eos> We all do, and we will.<eos> I know you want revenge, but we have to be better.<eos> We have to do what's best for the team.<eos> It's times like this when there's no clear path that I understand why people pray.<eos> We don't know if any of the rest of you are infected, but we will soon.
Sir?<eos> The Cisco I know never dwelled on formality.<eos> What's more, your hair is different, your wardrobe neat, your comportment gentlemanly.<eos> Oh, yeah, you like?<eos> I just subscribed to GQ?<eos> A snide attempt at humor... almost Cisco-like.<eos> Almost.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> What I am stating unequivocally, sir... is that you are not Cisco, which means I am not in S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> Furthermore, I will never, never give you the formula.
Joseph Stalin.<eos> He became quite skilled at breaking a man... carefully aimed strikes to the bridge of the nose, along the shoulder blades, and right underneath the chin.<eos> Stalin gave me this as a gift.<eos> So it's to be torture, then?<eos> Get on with it.<eos> No.<eos> Nothing so prosaic for you, Professor.<eos> There are infinite ways to break a man, and I have an infinite amount of time.<eos> Firestorm is my life's work.<eos> I will never allow you to pervert it in pursuit of global conquest.
We don't need any more casualties.<eos> Besides, Mr. Snart and Sara have got it covered. Whoa, man.<eos> Why does it feel like we're on the JV team all of a sudden?<eos> What you are is one half of everything Savage needs to change the face of the Cold War.<eos> And you are the only person who can kill him.<eos> Yeah, so you can't just...<eos> I am not going to gift-wrap the two people in the world that Savage wants the most.<eos> We should get going.<eos> Oh, Ms. Lance, could I borrow you for a moment?<eos> I have something that might help you out with the mission.
They send you there, you never come back.<eos> You can hear the screams all night.<eos> This place, where is it?<eos> Who said you could eat?<eos> Hey, he's not hurting anybody.<eos> Who is this American with the pretty teeth?<eos> Must be a comedian, da?<eos> I'm sure we can handle this like adults.<eos> Sooka!<eos> I brought you something to eat, Professor.
What are you doing, Boy Scout?<eos> Yes, Boy Scout, what are you doing?<eos> Nothing compared to what I did to your mother last night.<eos> You have quite a mouth on you.<eos> So does she.<eos> Enough!<eos> You're killing him!<eos> That's it?<eos> Oh, but the Colonel will think that we are cheating him.<eos> I'll tell you how to stabilize Firestorm.
I was obsessed by your culture...<eos> Rachmaninoff, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy.<eos> Stop stalling.<eos> It's a shame I-I never got to see it before the collapse.<eos> What sort of nonsense are you talking about?<eos> In 1991, your economy fails, and your empire crumbles.<eos> But the truth is the world is better off.<eos> In my time, crooks and thieves rule your country, desperate to hang on to power and the riches they divide amongst their cronies.<eos> My country is by no means perfect, but at least we are free to criticize our government, vote in fair elections, and love whom we choose.<eos> I, uh, hate to break this to you, Dr. Vostok.
I, uh, hate to break this to you, Dr. Vostok.<eos> You are on the wrong side of history.<eos> For now.<eos> But you will help us change history.<eos> Proceed.<eos> Gideon, are you able to detect the Professor's life functions remotely?<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> His pulse is still strong.<eos> Yeah, not for much longer.<eos> Rip, Jax and I need to talk to you.
Which means that somebody would have to run 120 yards in less than 12 seconds.<eos> Given Mr. Jackson tore his anterior cruciate ligament...<eos> Have a little faith, Gideon.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> It's done.<eos> You know, I've never seen a theorem so simple, so poetic before.<eos> With this, I can decelerate the subject's rate of fission and decrease core body temperature.<eos> Yet something's missing.<eos> I'm telling you, that is the equation... everything you need to build a Quantum Splicer.
The lava expresses the anger of the devil who are living in that fire, volcano.<eos> Do the ancestors, then, live under the volcano?<eos> Yes, we believe that anybody who dies here goes to the volcano, and that volcano has become their village, where you can talk to them and they can talk to us.<eos> - Can you talk to the volcano?<eos> - I'm not, because, you know,<eos> I'm not related to the volcano.<eos> But one of my brothers is. He was talking to the volcano.<eos> His father...<eos> His father, when he goes up to the volcano, and if he wants to smoke, he just calls out and the fire will come down, and take the fire and light his cigarette or pipe or something like that.<eos> And if you brother talks to the volcano, is he allowed to tell you what the volcano has said,
And this how they demonstrate it.<eos> Many people here have lost the dance.<eos> They have lost the idea of dancing.<eos> Yes.<eos> The custom dance that you're going to see this afternoon, just my family will perform the dance.<eos> This a happier dance.<eos> The happiest dance.<eos> After we have gone through a long suffering, then we are happy to go back and dance and to express ourselves.<eos> I studied here ten years ago with some colleagues, scientists from Vanuatu.<eos> For you, is it strange to imagine that someone would come here to work, to study how the volcano works, how it erupts?
And that can show whether the volcano is inflating because magma is rising into the cone. Is that...<eos> That's right.<eos> That's the idea for the electronic distance measurements.<eos> In a worst-case scenario, I imagine the observer is at risk if there's a pyroclastic flow.<eos> If it's too late for the observer to evacuate, are there any options left?<eos> Yeah, that's the emergency.<eos> Then, if it is emergency, we have a bunker.<eos> It's a thick door.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - After you.
Yeah. They're famous photos.<eos> We know them.<eos> About this monument, it dates back to what time, roughly?<eos> It dates back to the early 20th century.<eos> It was erected by the heavenly people living around this area.<eos> And, according to the inscription on the monument, they prayed to Mount Paektu and Lake Chon here to give birth to a prominent person who can give prosperity and happiness to the Korean nation.<eos> And the person materialized?<eos> You are quite right.<eos> This kind of miserable nation was rescued and saved just by our great leader, the fearless patriot Kim Il-sung, who fought against the Japanese imperialists.<eos> And how do you feel, as a historian, with all the thousands of years behind you, how do you feel personally?
Things move fast around here.<eos> Your clearance.<eos> They've never had a colored in here before, Katherine.<eos> Don't embarrass me.<eos> This wasn't emptied last night.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not the... custodian.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Harrison's computer reporting.<eos> Take the desk in the back.<eos> I'll get you work in a bit.
Your clearance.<eos> They've never had a colored in here before, Katherine.<eos> Don't embarrass me.<eos> This wasn't emptied last night.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not the... custodian.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Harrison's computer reporting.<eos> Take the desk in the back.<eos> I'll get you work in a bit.<eos> Mr. Harrison won't warm up to you.
Turn it down?<eos> No, Al.<eos> I don't think...<eos> It was a joke.<eos> Paul, if the heat shield comes off... what do you think happens to our astronaut?<eos> I know.<eos> So we're gonna come up with a solve, right?<eos> Yes, sir. We're working on it.<eos> Ruth, what's the status on that computer?<eos> She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.
That's right.<eos> So you can throw that in the trash.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said you can throw it away.<eos> Here.<eos> It's not an insult to your work.<eos> It's just obsolete.<eos> That's how fast things are moving around here.<eos> If I said I was sorry, I'd be saying it all day.<eos> What I'm asking you to do, what I'm asking everyone in that room... all my geniuses... is to look beyond the numbers.
She's not married.<eos> She's a widow... with three beautiful little girls.<eos> So well behaved.<eos> Angels on earth is what we like to call them.<eos> Dorothy, slice of pie?<eos> I'd love one.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You already have a slice of pie... Uh-huh.<eos> I was just, uh, fixing my three babies some plates...<eos> Let me help you.
The Russians certainly aren't slowing down any.<eos> They can't build a damn refrigerator.<eos> How the heck did they beat us into space?<eos> And what do you ladies do for NASA?<eos> Calculate your trajectories.<eos> Launch and landing.<eos> You can't get anywhere without the numbers. No, sir.<eos> Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.<eos> Engineering.<eos> And I'm proud as the devil to be working with you.
Is that possible?<eos> Is it possible that it actually means more to them?<eos> We're in the fight of our lives, people.<eos> We're not on some epic joy ride.<eos> I just saw seven faces who aren't sure that we can get there.<eos> This is our problem.<eos> And so as of right now there's only two things you need to know going forward.<eos> One is staying here, working late, that's gonna be a fact of life.<eos> And two, don't expect your paychecks to reflect the extra time it's gonna take to catch up and pass those bastards.<eos> For those of you who can't work that way, I understand and thank you for what you've done.
Sir, might be the selector latch.<eos> I'm taking a walk.<eos> We're honored to serve our country.<eos> So we don't think about danger.<eos> We don't have time to be scared.<eos> We got a job to do.<eos> Mrs. Jackson.<eos> Colored seats are at the back of the court room.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> So, which one of you wants to go first?
We're just getting up to speed here, Mr. Harrison.<eos> I need more manpower.<eos> I need programmers, folks to feed the cards.<eos> Get them, for crying out loud. Okay.<eos> You're the IBM man, right? Yes, sir.<eos> Go pull them out of the sky if you have to.<eos> Let's get ahead of this thing or I'm not paying you.<eos> Understood.<eos> I got that one, I got that one.<eos> I'm not paying any of you.
You're working late today.<eos> Seems to always happen that way.<eos> Yes. Seems to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hear the IBM's up to full capacity.<eos> You certainly have a knack for it.<eos> My father taught me a thing or two about mechanics.<eos> You know, I have a few girls in the East Group that have an interest in learning more about it.<eos> It is the future.<eos> I may bring them by, if it's all the same to you.
We'll see if we can find another assignment.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Katherine, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> It's out of my hands, if you can believe that.<eos> I understand.<eos> Katherine.<eos> We heard you got engaged.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's thoughtful of you.
CAPCOM, do you copy?<eos> Friendship 7, do you copy'?<eos> Over.<eos> Again.<eos> Friendship 7, do you copy'? Over.<eos> Friendship 7, do you copy'?<eos> Over.<eos> Loud and clear, CAPCOM.<eos> Roger that.<eos> How are you doing?
I've never had an assistant before.<eos> We will figure it out together.<eos> And you swear this is legit?<eos> 'Cause I seen Shawshank and I don't wanna go to Seg because I did your taxes too good.<eos> I guarantee you, you will never see anything with my social security number on it.<eos> Never say never.<eos> You work for MCC.<eos> Maybe one day you realize you need food stamps and you don't know how to fill out the forms.<eos> Well, I'm your girl.<eos> I can walk you through it, but I'm gonna need them digits.
- I'm goin'.<eos> It's clearly that... time.<eos> -Look at me go.<eos> -Go.<eos> -May I ask you a question, Mr. Caputo?<eos> -Shoot.<eos> How did you choose her to be your assistant, exactly?<eos> -Between you and me? -Yes, sir.<eos> She's the only semi-intelligent one that I'm only... semi-attracted to.<eos> Well, if you'll follow me, I'll show you the bathroom.
All right.<eos> Hey, there, Judy King.<eos> Oh, guilty as charged, in all respects.<eos> That's a joke, darlin'.<eos> You know, a lot of people in here are funny without meaning to be.<eos> I learned the hard way to hold my mirth.<eos> Oh, well, let your mirth fly free.<eos> I mean to be funny.<eos> All right.<eos> Um... actually, I was wondering if I could speak to you about my friend.
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.<eos> The New Orleans police put out a call to... -Hi!<eos> My name is Brook...<eos> -Look and I was wondering if--<eos> Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.<eos> -But spare me the setup, all right? -I don't have a setup.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.<eos> You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.<eos> I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.
You know who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.<eos> You're a member of the community who has as much right as any of your neighbors to be concerned about the big-box monstrosity that's being proposed for the corner of Exposition and Euclid.<eos> I'd be happy to talk about it with you, if you have the time.<eos> Look, I'm watching this Hurricane Katrina stuff.<eos> It's really intense.<eos> The world's gonna be lousy with Katrinas if we let mega-corporations like Walmart carbon-bomb our planet.<eos> You wanna come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, I'll give you the whole shpiel.
You are such a cautionary tale.<eos> I would be, if people got the story right.<eos> But once I had to go around door-to-door announcing my status, the rumors got started...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's all so fucked.<eos> Here.<eos> It's not like Walmart's gonna lose.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Warden Caputo's office.<eos> This is Ms. Jefferson speaking, how may I assist you?
Anyway, don't matter, I ain't got him right now.<eos> Will you please let him know I called?<eos> All right, you take good care now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Shit. What?<eos> What happened?<eos> I didn't quite get his name.<eos> You don't know who it was?<eos> Well, it was some brother, sounded like a salesman-type, if you ask me.<eos> So I probably did you a favor there. Oh!
Many of his most trusted lieutenants were killed in a violent firefight, and some of our own brave soldiers gave their lives in the effort.<eos> But the operation ended in overwhelming victory.<eos> Remember where you are right now, my fellow citizens, because on this great day, the selfish forces of terror have been defeated.<eos> Those two didn't firebomb my house, and they definitely didn't kill Phyllis, so why the hell is Snyder announcing to the world that Geronimo's been captured?<eos> Because, like he said, he needs a victory.<eos> That's a big problem, 'cause the guys doing all the damage are still out there.<eos> Which means we're just getting started.<eos> Snyder is here.<eos> He's down in interrogation.<eos> He wants to see you.
We didn't have guns.<eos> We had something more powerful. We had words and images.<eos> We had the power to get inside people's heads.<eos> That's great, so you inspired real insurgents running around down the flats, killing innocent people in your name. That's real noble.<eos> Seriously, how are you doing what you're doing?<eos> You're not one of them. You are one of us.<eos> We're done.<eos> Let's go.<eos> 4-1-1-2, proceed to location.<eos> Can I talk to you a second?
Hey, guys.<eos> Dad!<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing there, little bear?<eos> Good. Just doing some math.<eos> Math?<eos> That's great.<eos> Katie home?<eos> She went to the Yonk for a delivery, she said, Mr. Bowman.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second, Lindsey?
Wow, sweetie.<eos> Where'd you get those?<eos> I traded a friend at school some oranges.<eos> All right.<eos> Luis Ortega.<eos> Character actor extraordinaire.<eos> Pool Cue Biker in one movie.<eos> Uh... Freddie, no last name, in another.<eos> Salesman, Thug Number Three, Grill Chef... 23 credits total, all small stuff.<eos> How'd you like a starring role?
Okay.<eos> Thank you, Luis.<eos> You're gonna be a big help.<eos> And, you might even have fun in the process.<eos> Bram.<eos> Hey, Mr. Carson.<eos> It's an hour until curfew.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just that I heard about Geronimo and I want to help you with your telescope.
It's an hour until curfew.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just that I heard about Geronimo and I want to help you with your telescope.<eos> Shh! Get it.<eos> Get in.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Does it work?<eos> No. Not unless I can find a high-quality lens or learn how to make one.<eos> I think I can get one for you.
She's got booze stashed in there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll have some.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To Phyllis.<eos> Not a whiskey girl?<eos> Whiskey makes me drunk and, uh, yeah, two actual drinks and I'm...<eos> Fun?<eos> Because I'm not fun?<eos> No, I didn't trust you because the list of people I trust fits on one hand.
And the questions.<eos> You're to begin other treatments tomorrow.<eos> What are they?<eos> Bring me the food.<eos> No.<eos> Is it day or night?<eos> Sorry?<eos> The light's never off and there's no window!<eos> Is it day or night?<eos> Which would you prefer it to be?
He can't find me here.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I'm not Vanessa Ives here.<eos> I am no one.<eos> I have no name, no purpose.<eos> Do you want a purpose?<eos> Don't you?<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> Is it day or night?<eos> Which do you prefer now?
Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!<eos> I know you.<eos> And from what you say, I've known you a long time.<eos> My ancestor, the old woman, Joan Clayton, what would she say to you?
I can't stop thinking about it.<eos> It is torture.<eos> I'll have to undo it all before morning.<eos> They can't know.<eos> They'd sack me if they knew.<eos> And then who'd attend to you?<eos> It'll be our secret, eh?<eos> Uh, this is my wife's.<eos> She told me what to do.<eos> I tell her about you.
And what can be the use of him... is more than I can see.<eos> He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head.<eos> And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.<eos> The funniest thing about him..."<eos> "I never can get back by day, nor can remember plain and clear,<eos> the curious music that I hear."<eos> I've got to go, before the day fellows get here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day soon, no one will touch you when you don't want to be touched.<eos> Or put makeup on you, or take it off.
Is it so important?<eos> To be different?<eos> To have such specialness?<eos> Would you want your son to be anything but what he is?<eos> I want him to be happy.<eos> But what if he's not?<eos> Would you want him to pretend?<eos> No.<eos> Then don't ask it of me.<eos> Let me help you.
Would you want your son to be anything but what he is?<eos> I want him to be happy.<eos> But what if he's not?<eos> Would you want him to pretend?<eos> No.<eos> Then don't ask it of me.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You're not ill, so you tell me.<eos> So... what are you?<eos> I've told you.
Let me help you.<eos> You're not ill, so you tell me.<eos> So... what are you?<eos> I've told you.<eos> And you don't believe in God so you don't believe in Satan either.<eos> I'm a stupid man.<eos> Very bad at my lettering and my figures, no gift for words.<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> And I'll listen.<eos> So. Why would the Devil be interested in you?
Battles I shall plan.<eos> Prophesies I shall unveil.<eos> Who are you to defy me?<eos> I am nothing.<eos> I am no more than a blade of grass.<eos> But I am.<eos> You think you know evil?<eos> Here it stands.<eos> Well?<eos> Why would the Devil be interested in you?
And you're a horrible liar.<eos> I'll miss your hair.<eos> So will I.<eos> No, I mean, I'm leaving tomorrow.<eos> What?<eos> This job.<eos> You have another?<eos> No.<eos> It's no great matter.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.
I...<eos> I couldn't stop crying.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I realized I was wrong.<eos> One person does live there, where it's cold and lonely all the time.<eos> So I, uh, tendered my resignation.<eos> I'll stay on long enough to see you tomorrow.<eos> The last person you see before the surgery will be someone who loves you.<eos> Good-bye, Miss Ives.<eos> I'll get you something for that burn.
- Come again?<eos> Why would I "like" to see this?<eos> Huh.<eos> Well, I guess "need" would have been better for you, right?<eos> Coroner came and gave things the eyeball.<eos> Says these poor saps died probably three years ago.<eos> Died?<eos> Well, we won't know for sure if they was murdered till after the autopsies.<eos> They were murdered.<eos> What do you make of this?
That smell like cat litter and old people.<eos> I've just got to get you out of here before the baby comes.<eos> All I need is enough money to get us set up in a decent neighborhood.<eos> For crying out loud, there are girls on the street who earn that in a weekend without having to tell a single joke or blow a punch line.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> Come here and stop worrying about us.<eos> I love you, job or no job.<eos> You're good in the sack and you make me laugh.<eos> CARNY OWNER:<eos> Let me tell you something.
Come on, is it that bad?<eos> Yes, it is, and if it were up to me...<eos> Right now, it is.<eos> I'd throw the book at him.<eos> ALL: (CHANTING) Throw the book!<eos> Throw the book!<eos> Throw the book!<eos> Throw the book!<eos> (CHANTING CONTINUES)<eos> What are you waiting for? Throw it! Throw it!
Jim, are you still...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It's okay, let it come.<eos> He showed me pictures of my daughter.<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> Yes, she's alive.<eos> And?<eos> The police are right behind me.<eos> I'll stay with you, until...
The only decent thing about me is the shame I feel.<eos> Oh, spoken like a true servant of God.<eos> This God, that would anoint you Lupus Dei... That would make you a glorious monster, and have you hate yourself for being so monstrous.<eos> He tortures you with guilt, and in return offers you what?<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> Do you feel forgiven?<eos> There is only one way to free yourself of guilt.<eos> Embrace your sins.<eos> Hey, is that necessary?<eos> I assure you, I mean you no harm.
We'll see, won't we, old sport?<eos> What's the method?<eos> I'm going to inject an electrified dosage into the prefrontal cortex of your brain.<eos> All right.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> No.<eos> That'll be all, Doctor, thank you.<eos> You will have no memory of this.<eos> Not of this treatment, nor of your crimes, nor of your sins, nor of your time in this horrid place.<eos> Every moment that has benighted your life and set you on your dark course... I will take from you.
Oh.<eos> It's like looking in a mirror.<eos> Here, this is from a distillery in Tennessee.<eos> Fella by the name of William LaRue Weller.<eos> You see, Billy, he puts wheat in the mash instead of rye.<eos> Everyone called him a madman for doing it.<eos> Now he makes millions, he's a mogul.<eos> So it goes for all of us.<eos> To building a better tomorrow.<eos> I'll send you home with a case.
I want to know why you were riding with that Apache filth.<eos> I was riding alongside a man.<eos> Tell me, Malcolm. When you were in Africa, how many of these "men" did you slaughter?<eos> It is like looking in a mirror.<eos> - We are not the same.<eos> - You're right...<eos> I still have one child to save.<eos> "Bring the fattened calf and kill it." "For this son of mine was lost and now is found."<eos> Ethan will live out his days on this land. And you will help me in this.<eos> And if I am unable to assist you?
Are you an Egyptologist also?<eos> Not quite, though I have studied the Egyptians in depth.<eos> I'm a Thanatologist, you see.<eos> I study death.<eos> Its every ritual, every guise.<eos> The great hereafter. If there is such a thing.<eos> Usually folks have run a mile by now.<eos> Most people find that rather off-putting.<eos> I'm not most people.<eos> Are you familiar with the name Dracula?
I've tried not to rely on anyone since then.<eos> I've done the same.<eos> But how I wish my friends were here now.<eos> I'm not the only friend you have.<eos> And wouldn't you rather be having drinks with that handsome doctor from the museum?<eos> I'm being hunted.<eos> I won't bring him into this.<eos> Why don't you give him the choice?<eos> - He'll think I'm mad.<eos> - I'll give you a note.
I tortured him with guilt.<eos> And I tried to mold him into the man I wanted him to be.<eos> But if I could have a meal with him now... Learn from my mistakes.<eos> Your son is a good man.<eos> I believe this.<eos> Despite anything you may have done...<eos> May have done?<eos> I wonder, Malcolm, if it had been your son and daughter he'd murdered...<eos> I see.<eos> He didn't tell you?
And before this night ends, there will be a reckoning.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> The museum is closing in 10 minutes, miss.<eos> Oh, yes, thank you.<eos> I'm looking for Dr. Sweet.<eos> Ah. Up with his pets.<eos> If we're to continue, you must know how dangerous this is.<eos> How dangerous I am.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You'll think me mad, but I'll tell you the whole truth of it.
Tell me.<eos> You'll think me mad, but I'll tell you the whole truth of it.<eos> There's a creature hunting me.<eos> He has been hunting me since the dawn of time.<eos> He wants... to feed on my blood, and make me his bride. And...<eos> He will bring terror to everyone I love.<eos> Does this creature have a name?<eos> He's called Dracula.<eos> Can you believe me?<eos> May I show you something?
He wants... to feed on my blood, and make me his bride. And...<eos> He will bring terror to everyone I love.<eos> Does this creature have a name?<eos> He's called Dracula.<eos> Can you believe me?<eos> May I show you something?<eos> We're preparing an exhibit on nocturnal animals.<eos> For two months the Natural History Museum shall become<eos> "The House of the Night Creatures."<eos> Ah, here we are, this is what I wanted to show you.
It feeds entirely off the blood of other living animals.<eos> So, of course, I believe what you said because I know such monsters exist.<eos> There are creatures whom God has cast into darkness and cursed to the night.<eos> This animal feeds off blood because it must.<eos> Because it has been afforded no other food source.<eos> Because if it does not, it will die.<eos> Am I to feel sympathy for this monster who hunts me?<eos> I have come to love all the night creatures you see around us.<eos> They are so shunned... And alone.<eos> But I have not an ounce of sympathy for any creature who means you harm.
Cursed.<eos> Does she have a feeling for things not of this earth?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't be afraid, Vanessa.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am with your friends.<eos> Sir Malcolm and...<eos> You know him as Mr. Chandler.<eos> Ethan?<eos> We are coming to you.
Sadly, almost every assumption you have is wrong.<eos> But I, I've been...<eos> Superstition, myth, and unfounded prejudice informs every page here.<eos> These are small-minded peasants and poets and theologians trying to make sense of something utterly inexplicable to them.<eos> So they invent any assumptions to fit their fears.<eos> Dracula can't walk by day, he doesn't cast a reflection, he can only be slain by a stake of consecrated ash wood.<eos> There's no sense to any of that.<eos> You may as well read the Bible for its history which, it goes without saying, is a fool's errand fit only for idiot children.<eos> Then how am I to find out who he is?<eos> Start with what he's given you.
I come from Highland stock, an old clan, and was practically raised with a claymore in one hand, so much did my father want the son he never got.<eos> And I'll be honest with you, I've done my share of butchering over the years.<eos> But this, my darling, this is not the work of a soldier.<eos> It's the work of a spy.<eos> You must get close enough to look into his damned eyes.<eos> And then have the grit to do it.<eos> Then help me.<eos> How can I find him?<eos> He's a tactician above all.<eos> He'll approach you with stealth and strategy, not a frontal assault.
Take away all your anger and pain and replace them with something much better.<eos> - What?<eos> - Calm, poise, serenity.<eos> We're going to make you into a proper woman.<eos> Do you want to be alone?<eos> Anything but.<eos> I wasn't made for ships.<eos> Only part of adventuring I abhorred.<eos> I should have abhorred leaving my family or the privations of the trail, but really it was only the ships.<eos> Oh, I know better. I know how much you cared for your family.

I know how much you cared for your family.<eos> Only when it was too late.<eos> We prize things most when we've lost them.<eos> I suppose I should thank you for what you did in the chapel.
The night I met you, in fact.<eos> In the opium house.<eos> I remember.<eos> Given the chance to go back, would you do it differently?<eos> Walk the other way?<eos> Never meet me, or her?<eos> You've seen what I come from, that dragon that raised me, that land that reared me.<eos> I've known very little grace in my life.<eos> But I did with her.<eos> And with you.
I want to serve you. I will love you till time has lost all meaning.<eos> Do you accept me?<eos> I accept myself.<eos> "And then all light will end and the world will live in darkness.<eos> The very air will be pestilence to mankind.<eos> And our brethren, the Night Creatures, will emerge and feed.<eos> Such is our power, such is our kingdom, such is my kiss."<eos> And I know my destiny, whatever it might be, is somehow intertwined with Ethan's.<eos> Of course, it's so hard to judge another's intentions. But I would say Ethan Chandler is perhaps the only truly moral man I've ever known.<eos> What do you think you're doing?
Let's say I look like a friend then.<eos> I'm looking for Vanessa Ives.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - A friend.<eos> You must be Sir Malcolm Murray.<eos> You, I don't know.<eos> Where is she?<eos> How do you know Miss Ives?<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss my relationship with her.<eos> Then I urge you to find that liberty.
The Night Creatures have been eating.<eos> A sight it would have been. Don't you think, sir?<eos> Ethan. London bridge is falling down...<eos> The creatures of the night.<eos> What music they make.<eos> Do you like it, Mr. Chandler?<eos> You are at one with the night, are you not?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She is happy.<eos> If you truly love her, that ought to be enough for you.
I am simply the man who stands gratefully at her side.<eos> - I will save her.<eos> - She is saved.<eos> While you were in America wrestling with your demons, she freed herself of hers.<eos> She has made her choice.<eos> Leave her in peace.<eos> I understand very little of the forces of my life. Those things that have shaped me, and cursed me.<eos> But I know that my destiny is joined with hers.<eos> I will not stop.<eos> I suppose I can't blame you.
- Would you like me to?<eos> - Oh, very droll.<eos> But I've had more than enough of that for one day, thank you kindly.<eos> Now, you... you're more my thing.<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> Shall we play, you and I?<eos> - I like games.<eos> - And if I win?<eos> You won't, little man.<eos> Don't I scare you?
I have, uh, spent most of my time exploring, searching for a way out, mapping the place best I could.<eos> There is powerful magic at work here, Lieutenant.<eos> These hieroglyphs are remarkably similar to the Sumerian I found on our ancient tablet.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times I wished you were here to help me decipher them.<eos> Thank you, Crane.<eos> For never giving up on me.<eos> I only did as I knew you would had our roles been reversed.<eos> I just wish I could have come sooner.<eos> Funny thing is it's like you've been here the whole time.<eos> I talk to you, Crane.

Shame what's become of this place.<eos> In its day, it was glorious.<eos> Sorry, dearest.<eos> This is my astral form.<eos> Like your fellow Witness, I have projected it here.<eos> No need for a spirit cabinet though when your husband is a god.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> And you are a very close second.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing from you.
What is the issue?<eos> We are on the same side, so why the static?<eos> Everybody just-just take a second, all right?<eos> Look, maybe we should hear her out.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> Look, I know it's been... it's been a really weird day for you.<eos> I get it, believe me.<eos> But we need to throw everything we got at this thing.<eos> PANDORA: There is still a chance to save your fellow Witness.<eos> I can show you how to use the Eye to return.
I was awake but dreaming.<eos> I was here but-but not here.<eos> In the darkness, lost I heard your voice.<eos> I followed it.<eos> We made it.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Slow.<eos> In the Catacombs, I didn't get a chance to tell you.
Okay.<eos> All right, got it?<eos> Walking and texting?<eos> You have officially assimilated.<eos> Ah. 'Tis Ms. Corinth.<eos> She wishes to meet up so she can recover a book that she allowed me to borrow.<eos> Which is a very good sign, is it not?<eos> It isn't, actually.<eos> Crane, you have every book imaginable.<eos> If she lent you something, it was to bond with you.
It's not the right music.<eos> - Didn't keep his attention.<eos> - It's more than that.<eos> He's following something.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> I get it now.<eos> This is not just about envy and punishment.<eos> He's looking for connection.<eos> He wants a wife.<eos> I told my family about you.

You follow, she dies.<eos> Normally, he would take a hostage to the tunnels. - But, that location has been compromised.<eos> - Well, why the sudden change in M.O.?<eos> He's been killing victims, not kidnapping them.<eos> He's sick of waiting.<eos> He wants a bride, and he wants one now.<eos> The Carriage House.<eos> The Kindred has been there before.<eos> It's where the Headless Horseman tried to keep his own bride.<eos> I will text you the address, we'll meet you there.

Crane, the Kindred does not want to harm Zoe.<eos> He wants to hurt you, which is a good thing.
Perhaps a different suggestion... No.<eos> Crane, E.T.'s a classic. You should see it.<eos> Truth is I came home to pick up a few things.<eos> I booked some time at the range.<eos> Gotten a little rusty since I've been away, so, keep it warm for me.<eos> Yes, of course I can.<eos> Are you maintaining a journal? Yeah, it's supposed to help me<eos> "define and sort through my trauma," but seeing as how every day<eos> I was down there was the same as the one before, it makes for a pretty boring read.<eos> And... to answer the question that you are thinking, but not asking directly... I'm fine.

Did you know a man can live without a spleen?<eos> Pandora promised him riches and glory in exchange for obtaining the Eye of Providence for her.<eos> When he failed to do so, she terminated his services.<eos> How the mighty fall.<eos> All right, so why'd you come to us, huh?<eos> Big fish like you, I mean, you must have a lot of people you can go to for help.<eos> Oh, yeah. One little arrest, all my associates turn their backs on me, - huh?<eos> - So I see your angle.<eos> You help us catch the monster...<eos> And we help you get out of town.
Toss your weapon.<eos> This is your girl, here.<eos> You were family once.<eos> "Family."<eos> August Corbin hated me.<eos> He was just a holier-than-thou son of a bitch.<eos> He never gave in to temptation. He never took a bribe.<eos> You could literally choke on his saintliness.<eos> Don't you move.<eos> You know, I actually think my father meant a lot more to you than you're willing to admit.
You could literally choke on his saintliness.<eos> Don't you move.<eos> You know, I actually think my father meant a lot more to you than you're willing to admit.<eos> And I know how that is, believe me.<eos> I mean, I spent my whole life pretending like his opinion didn't matter to me.<eos> And I have just been trying for so long to understand him.<eos> And, you know what, man, I think I finally do.<eos> You loved him, Atticus.<eos> We both did.<eos> And you know damn well what he'd say to you right now.

Such as?<eos> I've heard that Agent Mills is not as stable as she once was, that she's changed.<eos> Mills is a good agent.<eos> She'll find her feet again.<eos> Under your keen eye, Daniel, I have no doubt.<eos> Oh, one other thing:<eos> I want you to downgrade the search for Atticus Nevins.<eos> Minor resources only.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Because I ordered you to.
Daisy's still one of us.<eos> What she did here was not of her own free will.<eos> Hive infected her.<eos> She's his hostage.<eos> We need to remember that.<eos> But this alien creature messed with the wrong team.<eos> It thinks if it breaks our legs, we'll stop fighting, but it doesn't know how damn stubborn we are, especially when it comes to protecting our own.<eos> Hive is building an Inhuman army, but we're not gonna let that happen.<eos> So strap in.<eos> Because you might feel a little sick after this.
My name is Anon.<eos> Do you have an appointment with the doctor?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We're fellow geneticists.<eos> Like Dr. Radcliffe, we dabble in...human enhancements.<eos> Guys, this woman has been heavily modified, in ways you wouldn't anticipate.<eos> Mm, man, I need to get out more.<eos> Are you a patient of Dr. Radcliffe?<eos> We have...quite innovative eye technology.<eos> Perhaps it will serve you, as well.
Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hello.<eos> Please follow me.<eos> Back online and on the move.<eos> Copy that.<eos> This wasn't in the schematics.<eos> You first.<eos> Are we meeting Dr. Radcliffe?<eos> After you.
- Coulson!<eos> - Talbot?<eos> This isn't a good time.<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> Yes, Inhumans are real.<eos> But that's barely scratching the surface, 'cause I've stood on alien soil, and I've jumped through a portal to get there.<eos> So if it's discovery that you want and the science behind it --<eos> It's both.<eos> It's all of it.<eos> Okay, well, I can give you that.
No way.<eos> A real life Rosie the Riveter?<eos> Is there anything you can't manage to put a positive spin on?<eos> Uh, no, I got it: the DMV.<eos> So you do have a dark side.<eos> You making fun of me?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Doesn't mean I don't find your unwavering optimism... enjoyable.<eos> I find watching you weld enjoyable.<eos> Dr. Palmer, in case you weren't aware, you are on an open channel, and we can hear everything you're saying.
- Uprising?<eos> Is just what people called it when... Well, when all this happened.<eos> 15 years ago, he brought an army with him.<eos> - Who brought an army?<eos> No, it's not possible.<eos> How did you get off Lian Yu?<eos> Say something, damn it!<eos> Ms. Lance?<eos> Who is this? Somebody very dangerous.<eos> Then now is not the right time for me to say it... but please, remind me later to tell you that I told you so.
Right?<eos> Right. Oh, they're back.<eos> Where's Mr. Rory?<eos> Sleeping it off.<eos> We have the Neuromorphic Prototype.<eos> Any luck with the ship's engines?<eos> Yeah, it's all good.<eos> Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?<eos> Well, all my friends and family are dead, except for Oliver Queen, who happens to be dead inside and missing his left arm.<eos> Sara, I have told you...
Sara, I have told you...<eos> That this is just a potential future and that it's all gonna go back when we return to 2016... if we return.<eos> But what if we don't?<eos> We all know Carter's not coming back.<eos> It's not like we have the safest line of work.<eos> I think if Sara wants to stay and help that then we should.<eos> I mean, that's what we signed up for:<eos> - to be heroes.<eos> - I agree with Jefferson.<eos> Yes, of course you both do, because neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline.
But then I didn't know what I know now - and that he doesn't know yet.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> It's quite possible that you'll be compelled to testify tonight.<eos> - What are you saying? - My contacts in court assure me that the prosecution has a brand new witness, that could provide a definitive turning point in your case.<eos> No word yet on who he is, but they are transferring him to the courts, to give a deposition within the next three hours.<eos> I told the truth.<eos> There are gaps in your statement, Mr. Doria and I need details.<eos> The reliability of your testimony is based on the details.<eos> With them, I can convince the world that you're innocent.<eos> And I assure you that I can.
This is a good place to live but you need to adapt.<eos> Children? - Do you have any children?<eos> I see that...<eos> - Ah! No, no.<eos> No.<eos> My husband would like to, well, I... work too much and not...<eos> I don't know very well. Oh, well, don't be dismayed.<eos> I had Dani, well, Daniel, he does not like me to call him Dani, was I was almost 40.<eos> A child changes your life.<eos> But it also gives you everything.
Be careful with that.<eos> - To the right, please.<eos> Mr. Doria.<eos> Sorry to bother you on such a special day.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I just know that you're not Ivan Souto.<eos> Please.<eos> I am Daniel Garrido's father.<eos> I don't know if you saw the news, but... and they say he fled and, well...<eos> I'd like to ask you some questions, if I may.
My son is dead.<eos> Someone is laughing at my wife and at me.<eos> The day that the police spoke to you, Elvira and I were there.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> Our son used his cell phone until shortly before Tomas picked up that woman on the road.<eos> So, it was impossible that the phone was at home, unless she brought it with her.<eos> This could only have happened if she crossed paths with our son at some point.<eos> And then, she was not alone. There was someone else with her.<eos> - But how can you be so sure?<eos> - I already told you!
But, an airline ticket and a hotel reservation... they prove nothing<eos> Despite that... we trusted the police and returned home.<eos> Until a few Dias later, the news appeared accusing my son of being a thief.<eos> We understood that it was all a hoax.<eos> That was not our Daniel.<eos> In his whole life, he had never hurt anyone.<eos> My wife broke down... when she understood what that meant.<eos> But I wasn't going to stop fighting.<eos> I followed the one track I had left.<eos> You.
My wife broke down... when she understood what that meant.<eos> But I wasn't going to stop fighting.<eos> I followed the one track I had left.<eos> You.<eos> And I found out everything that you might lose by a mishap.<eos> What would it mean to you to admit that you were not in Paris, but with another woman instead.<eos> I went back to tell the police, but they didn't believe me.<eos> That's when I realized the power you have.<eos> The power that makes a wolf stronger than it is.<eos> But I'm not afraid of wolves like you.
There's someone that you have not named who knows more than those parents.<eos> Do you need help?<eos> Do you want to have the jury believe that passerby driver arranged the meeting at the hotel?<eos> - To what end, Mr. Doria?<eos> - To blackmail us for what he knew.<eos> That we were guilty.<eos> And that he couldn't find out who I was and that Laura was not my wife.<eos> Details, Mr. Doria.<eos> I have to warn you that the jury would only believe this absurd theory, if the details make it plausible.<eos> I have not yet told you how they arranged the appointment at the Bellavista Hotel.
Be on time.<eos> I'll call the phone booth in the parking lot and I'll tell you where to deliver the money.<eos> Don't come alone, or without the money.<eos> And don't try anything...<eos> or I will call the police.<eos> The envelope was sent from Bierge, three days ago.<eos> And the sender is marked Daniel Garrido.<eos> - It was here...<eos> - If it is not, it looks very similar, yes.<eos> Mr. Doria... did you observe the moon?
I'm glad it was nothing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe he saw something suspicious about our behaviour, and that he pretended to leave, and then hide.<eos> Sure, I understand your problem.<eos> You are trying to deflect your story from Daniel Garrido's death.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - The passerby driver is one who acts only for the money.<eos> And you think that if you hide behind that blackmailer, no one will think about the poor boy, and you'd look less guilty.<eos> Tell me, do you have a better idea?<eos> I'll ask you three questions.

It's a likely scenario to build your defense.<eos> It's something that would convince a judge.<eos> Tomas Garrido had a strong motive to commit a murder.<eos> If a father knows that the police protects those responsible for the disappearance of his son, he has only one option: - force you to face it.<eos> - Kill one of us and incriminate the other it's a way to get it.<eos> That's right.<eos> It worked perfectly.<eos> Everyone believes you guilty, Mr. Doria.<eos> The police, your own wife and even your financial partners.<eos> Tomas Garrido did not only implicate you for the death of your lover, but he also ruined your life and your business.
- Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I have a reservation.<eos> Room 715...<eos> That's how Tomas Garrido could get in the room without leaving any evidence.<eos> He just had to wait for you and Laura to get up to the room.<eos> From there, he could send the SMS with Laura's phone.<eos> He just sent us a text message with your mobile phone.<eos> And then hit you to put you out of action completing the perfect crime.<eos> If this was the case, Tomas Garrido had set up the stage for blaming you and disappear through the road that his wife had indicated.
The prosecution has no witness.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - Nobody has met with the judge.<eos> It was my invention, which I gradually shaped, with the details you gave me.<eos> You've been leading me on?<eos> Why didn't you tell me the truth from the beginning?<eos> To see if it was possible to get rid of Tomas Garrido from the room.<eos> I've always known that he was the culprit.<eos> It was also easy to discover that his wife worked at the hotel.<eos> And did you wait for me to tell you?

It was she that bore such a weight on her conscience, that, little by little, made her collapse.<eos> Until she realized that there was only one way to regain their dignity'.<eos> By now, she could no longer return the child to those poor parents.<eos> But there was something she could do. Tell them the truth.<eos> So she met them at the hotel where the lad's mother was employed.<eos> A secluded spot in which to put her plan in action.<eos> She went to Bierge alone through the valley.<eos> And when she got to the hotel station, She call you from a pay phone so you wouldn't suspect anything.<eos> Someone knows something.<eos> She made you believe that the passerby driver had seen something.
...then why the fuck are you using the phone? That he had found her and was blackmailing her.<eos> It was her way of trying to compensate those poor people for their loss.<eos> She didn't have the courage to confess it all empty-handed.<eos> Once in the room, all she had to do is wait. Then she set in motion the second part of the plan.<eos> She wrote a text message on her cell phone as a protection measure.<eos> Laura knew you would refuse to confess.<eos> Because you only care about one thing: yourself.<eos> So you made sure that nobody would see you getting into the room where Laura was waiting.<eos> But Laura had already reached the point of no return.<eos> When she told you what she intended to do, you lost control
Why?<eos> - You're very smart, make an effort.<eos> - I want an answer.<eos> When Tomas and his wife arrived at the hotel they learned of Laura's death. they realized what had happened.<eos> Of course, they examined the options and hesitated about what to do.<eos> But, not trusting in the justice system, what did they have left? Study the enemy and wait.<eos> To watch you.<eos> Tomas Garrido became a shadow in the shadows.<eos> He found an apartment in front of your building and managed to occupy it anonymously.<eos> And since then... he's kept you and anybody else that came in contact with you under constant surveillance.
Now you're in my hands.<eos> Adrian, are you there?<eos> Your phone's off.<eos> Everything is under control.<eos> And the Garridos suspect that you and you mistress are the culprits.<eos> Since she's dead, there's only... you.<eos> Where did you sink the body?<eos> There won't be no salvation without suffering,<eos> And you're not smarter than me.<eos> Police, can I help you?
Since she's dead, there's only... you.<eos> Where did you sink the body?<eos> There won't be no salvation without suffering,<eos> And you're not smarter than me.<eos> Police, can I help you?<eos> Mr. Doria?<eos> My name is Tomas Garrido.<eos> I'm Virginia Goodman.<eos> I am the father of Daniel Garrido.<eos> I want to tell you what really happened to my son.
I went to Harvard Med.<eos> I have degrees lining the wall of my office.<eos> And I don't have the slightest clue what's going on here.<eos> If you know something about this that I don't...<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> Nothing seems to faze you.<eos> And not to sound accusatory, but it's like you know something.<eos> Knowing something is different from understanding it.<eos> Yeah, I could tell you things, really bizarre things.

Hey, Coach, it's Scott and Stiles.<eos> Coach, You're in rehab. You didn't have a lobotomy.<eos> Coach?<eos> Don't you touch it.<eos> I've got Nurse Gonzalez by the balls of the last three moves and she knows it.<eos> Let it go.<eos> You're checking out of this place now.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Okay, Coach.<eos> But, we know you're fine.
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Lydia?<eos> Something's happening.<eos> Now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But something's wrong.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> You should hear the rest of the story.<eos> Why should I be listening to you?
Well, the good new is whatever the Turtle did, it only affected you temporarily.<eos> Yo. What was it like being in Turtle Time?<eos> Yeah, no, it was weird.<eos> It was like waves of inertness... like all the energy was suddenly sucked out of my body, and then it would return.<eos> That's because that's exactly what was happening.<eos> He has the ability to transfer all the surrounding kinetic energy into himself.<eos> Leaving everyone else in a temporary state of potential energy.<eos> That's right.<eos> So why could I still move? Your speed.<eos> Your speed allows you to change positions faster than anyone else.
Thank you, Cisco.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> Cool. I'm gonna do this...<eos> I'm gonna tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> You care for this woman.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Then keep her as far away from this as possible.<eos> And here's why.<eos> If Zoom finds out who you care for, who you love, who you live for, he'll take them from you.
Keep your eyes open for the Turtle.<eos> A sentence I never thought I would say.<eos> Cisco, are you and Harry in position?<eos> I'm the security feed.<eos> I've got the facial recognition software running, so we'll be able to spot Turtle before he makes his move.<eos> Turtle.<eos> Why do you insist on giving them ridiculous nicknames? Me?<eos> Who's the genius that came up with "Zoom"?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I'll tell you, about two years ago... this is on Earth-2, now.
Look, just meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs, all right?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to stop moving...<eos> Forever.<eos> What do you get out of killing me?<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> That's much too... fast and messy.<eos> I like to take things nice and slow.<eos> You don't have to hurt me to try to prove a point.<eos> This isn't about hurting you.
I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> No, yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, can you just...<eos> Uh, do you mind...<eos> Of course.<eos> Take your time.<eos> We already paid you.<eos> I gave you all of my money for that drop fee.
No, yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, can you just...<eos> Uh, do you mind...<eos> Of course.<eos> Take your time.<eos> We already paid you.<eos> I gave you all of my money for that drop fee.<eos> Yeah, and I dropped it, all right?<eos> Now I'm picking it up again.<eos> How much? I'll write you a check.
You've been out a long time.<eos> Mail call!<eos> News from home?<eos> Dear Damon, they tell us to only send good news, but I cannot.<eos> The days grow darker in Mystic Falls and my heart darker still.<eos> Sir, w-what would you say if I asked for two weeks' leave to go see my brother.<eos> You and every other man out here, Salvatore.<eos> - No.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> What if I was willing to help you with your little deserter problem, for example?
People wear masks for a reason-- to hide who they are-- just like you have been doing for the past 5 years.<eos> First, you decided to sign up for being the world's most overqualified I.T. girl, and then you decide to try being a hero, and look what it got you, a ringside seat to the rest of your life.<eos> You thought you were such a badass.<eos> Waller says the shipment of railguns is in the back of that truck, moving out in less than an hour.<eos> What does Shadowspire want with a whole shipment of railguns?<eos> Absolutely nothing good.<eos> It's nice to have you back, Agent Michaels.<eos> Feels like old times.<eos> What feels like old times is you keeping secrets that get good people killed.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that Alan and the other two agents might still be alive if you hadn't tried to keep your anti-Shadowspire operations off the books?
Oh, my God.<eos> I told you, John. The railguns were a distraction.<eos> Argus is the endgame.<eos> If this is retribution for the work Agent Chang and I did crippling Shadowspire, clearly it didn't take.<eos> Vengeance and retribution are useless pursuits.<eos> For one thing, they don't pay.<eos> I'm here for Rubicon, and you--you're gonna give me the codes to access it.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> I do. That's why I kept all these people alive.<eos> I'm gonna give you 20 minutes, and then... I'm gonna ask you again.
Lieutenant, we picked up an unauthorized comm out of the detention area.<eos> Take someone and look into it.<eos> Go on.<eos> You might not get the chance to enjoy it again.<eos> It's been 20 minutes.<eos> Am I gonna have to downsize your organization yet again?<eos> Apparently. Well, that's rather cold-blooded.<eos> You really don't know her that well at all, do you?<eos> Ms. Michaels is one of my most trusted agents.<eos> She knows better than anyone that I'm perfectly capable of watching you execute every person in this room, and I'll still never give you the Rubicon access codes.
Lucky for me, though, your CO and I go way back.<eos> If you're serious about Lyla Michaels giving up the Rubicon codes, you will get on the radio and tell Lieutenant Joyner the guy that taught him how to count cards is here and, uh, wants to help him out.<eos> Andy Diggle?<eos> You look pretty good for a dead man.<eos> Here I thought I put on weight.<eos> What are you doing at Argus, much less alive?<eos> Amanda Waller brought me in because of my former association with you guys, but, uh, small world, though.<eos> Your friend Ms. Michaels-- she's my sister-in-law.<eos> - Andy. - Point being, her husband is crawling around these ventilation shafts right now.<eos> If you put a gun on him, she'll tell you whatever you need to know.
Absolutely.<eos> Or maybe it was just somebody who's able to make themselves look like Roy.<eos> Don't act like it's the craziest possibility after everything that we've experienced.<eos> What's crazy is Roy stealing from tech companies.<eos> What did he take this time?<eos> A triode capacitor bomb.<eos> Tiny device, really huge boom.<eos> This is Alex for the 500th time today.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, I was just texting you.
It has always been my hope that my actions would inspire others.<eos> 4 months later, and they have.<eos> Knowing that, effective immediately, I will be suspending my campaign and throwing my full support behind Ruvé Adams.<eos> Now I would like to take a moment to thank all of my supporters for all of your hard work.<eos> What you've done will not be forgotten.<eos> New numbers are out.<eos> You're leading by 16 points.<eos> Alex, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that you put your heart and soul into this campaign, and--<eos> And your days of speech-making are now behind you.
I'm kind of over the Flash.<eos> I want a Green Arrow action figure.<eos> Well, the Green Arrow is pretty amazing.<eos> I will let you guys get reacquainted.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is everything ok? Detectives questioned William while the docs were checking him out.<eos> Darhk didn't take him.<eos> It was a guy with a missing hand.<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> I assure you, Mr. Queen, I had all the faith in the world that you would survive.
Hey, mom.<eos> Oh, hey, hon.<eos> I'm--I'm--I'm fine.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Why--why--why--why you think it was me that did something?<eos> Because you're a man.<eos> I'm trying to put some distance between us in case Darhk is after me because I can't stand the idea of anything happening to her, Felicity.<eos> Yeah? Well, she looked pretty upset. Yeah.<eos> Oliver's not here.<eos> I was looking for you.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Got an ID on your not so secret but very crazy admirer.<eos> Carrie Cutter.<eos> She's former SCPD.<eos> Love is a bullet in the brain.<eos> My hero!<eos> I'm Cupid, stupid.<eos> And if I don't help you?
He was the leader of the gunmen.<eos> He took myself, Thea Queen, and Felicity Smoak hostage.<eos> And while you were held hostage--<eos> Damien Darhk-- or whatever he calls himself-- was there calling the shots the entire time.<eos> Pass the witness.<eos> This, uh, holiday party, were you, uh... were you there as a guest?<eos> No, sir. I work security-- personal security for Mr. Oliver Queen.<eos> And I have been for the past 3-plus years.<eos> Even after Mr. Queen lost his job as CEO of Queen Consolidated?<eos> I mean... how much does he pay you, 10 cents an hour?
So why would I be doing that if everything I'm saying isn't true?<eos> In position.<eos> In position. There's no psychopaths here other than paparazzi.<eos> Tapped into security cameras.<eos> All clear.<eos> Everything OK?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You look perfect.<eos> I'd like to assure you, I won't breathe a word of what goes on here to the press.
Next step.<eos> Right.<eos> Are we OK?<eos> I wasn't exactly pulling punches on the stand.<eos> No, I'm glad you did.<eos> Because of that, Darhk's defense is blown to shreds.<eos> He's gonna spend the rest of his life behind bars.<eos> Hey, Quentin, you have a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Lieutenant Pike, if I could just talk to you before--
And what of Miss Venediktov?<eos> She's still here.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Where's my idol?<eos> It's not your concern anymore.<eos> It's nearby.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> The powers they bestowed are on the wane, but--<eos> Enough!<eos> As I was saying, the magics are losing their potency, but I still have enough to make short work of the two of you.
How the hell did you get in here? Heh.<eos> I used to be Ra's Al Ghul.<eos> This I know.<eos> What I'm less clear of is why my resources haven't been deployed to get me out of here.<eos> Well, that's what I'm here to explain.<eos> Although my time in here might be limitless, Malcolm, my patience isn't.<eos> That's cute.<eos> As I was saying, I've been in touch with your resources, and they don't seem to have any particular love left for you, Damien.<eos> Something to do with hocus and pocus and killing fellow members when you get miffed.<eos> HIVE is moving forward with Genesis but not with you.

The-- the thrill of this, the rush.<eos> I mean, we just took down a bad "Bee-yotch" tonight.<eos> It doesn't get any better than this.<eos> I was never in it for that, not ever.<eos> I wanted to make a difference, be a part of that beacon of hope you speak of.<eos> So come back.<eos> Rejoin the team.<eos> I think I figured out another way.<eos> It was actually that insane bee lady who gave me the idea, ironically... To remake this company to use the technology that helped me walk again to make people's lives better, to make Palmer Tech into the beacon of hope.<eos> Our mutual friends in HIVE have abandoned our other mutual friend Mr. Darhk, but he reached out to me, told me about you.
Star City?<eos> Hmm. There's a Nexus chamber there, as well.<eos> Wait. You didn't think it was a coincidence that Damien Darhk chose that city?<eos> You know Darhk?<eos> I wouldn't be much of a shaman if I didn't.<eos> Special brand of nasty loco that one is.<eos> Mmm. So if you know Darhk, why haven't you tried to end him?<eos> That's not the way of things.<eos> We immortals tend to stay out of the affairs of men.<eos> Unless someone owes you money.
Death. The more people he kills, the more powerful he becomes.<eos> Not just a pretty face this guy.<eos> Except Oliver's not gonna go kill a bunch of people just to be on the same level playing field as Darhk.<eos> All things have their opposite.<eos> Darhk draws his power from fear and death.<eos> Its opposite is light and hope, la Luz Del Alma, light of the soul.<eos> If you can channel la Luz Del Alma, you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.<eos> Then that is what I'm here to learn.<eos> I wish it were just that easy.<eos> If the darkness inside you outweighs the light, instead of repelling Darhk's magic, you will end up fueling it.
It's time.<eos> I know this feels personal, John, but it isn't.<eos> What's happening is just what has to happen.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it for Laurel.<eos> She'd be so disappointed in you.<eos> The only reason why you're still breathing is because one of us is still human.<eos> I'll hit you with a low dose of Darhk's magic, and then we'll take it up from there.<eos> Don't I need an idol or a totem?<eos> The tattoo Constantine gave you does many things.
The tattoo Constantine gave you does many things.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm--I'm sorry.<eos> I just--I just thought that these magic lessons would have, you know, more lessons.<eos> Magic is a manipulation of primordial energies, primordial as in prelinguistic.<eos> You'll probably want to take a few steps back, amor.<eos> Two sides of you-- darkness, light.<eos> Good, but that might be, as they call, beginner's luck, so let's kick it up a notch or two, hmm?<eos> The darkness and light are within you.
Two sides of you-- darkness, light.<eos> Good, but that might be, as they call, beginner's luck, so let's kick it up a notch or two, hmm?<eos> The darkness and light are within you.<eos> In truth, you are only fighting yourself.<eos> The friends you've failed, the people you've killed, they have no place in this.<eos> Don't give in. Cast aside your doubt, resist your darkness.<eos> What happened?<eos> He's not ready. I'll get it, I'll get it.<eos> Now let's go again.<eos> I could give you an infinite number of tries.

Yeah.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Uh, Captain, let's not go there just yet.<eos> Now you don't think that with everything that we have seen, that we have all seen, that there is a ch-chance that Laurel is back?<eos> Cisco keyed the Sonic device to Laurel's vocal cords.<eos> No one else is supposed to be able to use that. Right, right.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Quentin.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dr. Schwartz--ahem. I'd like to thank you for your discretion throughout all of this.

I'd like to thank you for your discretion throughout all of this.<eos> Doctor-patient privilege, and in any case, she, uh, helped this city.<eos> I mean, the least I can do is help her and you.
I mean, what happens below ground is simply not their concern.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> Get down!<eos> Get out!<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I am the mayor of this city.<eos> I don't care who you are!<eos> You're gonna be a lot less if you don't get out of that limo right now!<eos> Move.<eos> Can I help you with something?
Thank you.<eos> Mr. Queen, have time to answer a few questions?<eos> I'm not a candidate anymore.<eos> I'm just here to support the new mayor.<eos> So no comment on the write-in results?<eos> Uh, what write-in results?<eos> 48% of the electorate wrote in your brother's name on their ballots.<eos> That's a historic showing for a candidate who pulled out of the race.<eos> I'll let you and your former opponent catch up.<eos> Well, thank you for coming out tonight, Mr. Queen.
Do you have it?<eos> Perhaps now's a good time to remind you of our terms.<eos> Yes. You and your daughter get spared from Genesis.<eos> Is that still the play?<eos> I don't think you appreciate what this cost me.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Stop being so high-handed.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Mr. Merlyn, do you know what the Khushu idol is?<eos> Khushu is an old Arabic term for humbleness, suffice it to say, something I wouldn't associate with you.
He's in the wind along with 50 or so inmates.<eos> And Andy.<eos> You warned me, and I didn't listen.<eos> I'll never be able to forgive myself.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Just out of recovery.<eos> She's gonna be fine.<eos> She's a strong woman, your friend.<eos> The strongest.<eos> She's been asking for you.
This season on "Arrow"...<eos> The only way I know how to fight the darkness is to be darkness, and I don't want to be that type of person anymore.<eos> I'm running for mayor.<eos> And I promise you that I will never stop fighting to save this city.
That was Reiter.<eos> But there's another way off the island.<eos> And here I thought you'd never use the comm gear I gave you to radio for a trip home.<eos> Well, I lost it for a while, and the job wasn't done.<eos> And now it is.<eos> I sent you here to break up Reiter's operation and free his prisoners.<eos> You did both.<eos> You saved a lot of lives.<eos> I took some, too.<eos> Do you remember what I told you?
I sent you here to break up Reiter's operation and free his prisoners.<eos> You did both.<eos> You saved a lot of lives.<eos> I took some, too.<eos> Do you remember what I told you?<eos> That the only way out is through?<eos> Well, I am not out, Amanda.<eos> I'm still filled with darkness.<eos> This was never about expunging your darkness, Mr. Queen.<eos> That darkness will always be part of you.
Like you said, maybe you can't become a hero without succumbing to the darkness even a little bit, but you were able to defeat Darhk by giving the city its hope back.<eos> You're saying it's not black and white?<eos> I'm saying that there is a man who killed Darhk in cold blood, and that same man stood on top of a car and gave the city its hope back.<eos> What you're feeling isn't darkness. It's a schism.<eos> You're at war with two sides of yourself.<eos> Hello.<eos> Mr. Queen, this is Thomas Kemp.<eos> I chair the city council.<eos> Yes, of course, councilman.<eos> What can I help you with?

And that's why I have faith that... You're gonna do the right thing.<eos> Gentlemen, I have a little errand I need you to run, a loose end that needs tying up, not unlike...<eos> Do I detect some obstinacy, Mr. Brick?<eos> I'm used to giving the orders, Darhk, not taking them.<eos> Not even as a little thank-you for busting you out of Iron Heights?<eos> Whatever happened to gratitude?<eos> I'm here, ain't I?<eos> And when the whole world is sitting under a field of mushroom clouds, you will be glad that you are.<eos> Now then, back to the errand.<eos> Have either of you boys heard of the Calculator?
God help me if you are using the end of days to steal from my company again.<eos> I'm an excellent multitasker, but you can trust me this time.<eos> Dennis: Ms. Smoak.<eos> Oh! Mr. Dennis.<eos> Wow! You must be very desperate for me to talk to the board since you brought security to dragoon me.<eos> These men are not here to take you to the conference room.<eos> They're here to escort you out of the building.<eos> Heh. Excuse me?<eos> The board has grave concerns about your plans to basically give away the biostimulant implant.<eos> - Mmm. - They wanted to discuss the matter with you.
How bad is it?<eos> Kuttler was able to clone 90% of the processor.<eos> He may be able to extrapolate the remaining 10% to build us a workable processor.<eos> I'm gathering parts for him to work with, but we're still gonna need to upload the override codes to every nuke silo individually.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Reiter:<eos> My men are searching the woods for my property, but you chose not to die with them.<eos> I killed a few of the stragglers.<eos> My power has grown beyond your imagining.<eos> Let me show you.
I think I'm before you.<eos> I'm gonna take this call. - It's me. - No.<eos> - I think it's me. - I think-- LA Call Line.<eos> - I think he likes hearing sad things. - Oh, man.<eos> It was just a hang up.<eos> - Oh, that's all I get. - That's all I've ever had is crank call, - wrong call.<eos> - Most of us just get crank calls.<eos> - That's you now. - Go ahead, Maura.<eos> - C'est moi.<eos> LA Call Line, I'm here to help you. How can I help?
I'm trans, too.<eos> Hey, uh, what's your name?<eos> Elizah.<eos> My name is Maura.<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> At St. Christopher's, the clinic.<eos> St. Christopher's?<eos> - Yes. - Hold on one second.<eos> Um, can I ask you, are you, um--<eos> Do you have, um-- Is your mom around?
It's all right.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Drop when I tell you.<eos> Understood?<eos> Understood.<eos> Remember, James, the only failure is giving up.<eos> Primary.<eos> Tommy, now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I told you... today I die.
It will be dangerous.<eos> This is a much different time, and we're all at war.<eos> I know the 12 Monkeys are there as well and no doubt have something to do with the massive temporal disturbance.<eos> Paradox.<eos> See, I can send you back before that event.<eos> Mr. Ramse, you can find them, you can save their lives, and you can bring them back home.<eos> And when you do...<eos> When I do?<eos> I will guarantee your freedom.<eos> You'll be free to walk out of here with your son.
You're only sending him back two days before the paradox.<eos> Is that enough time?<eos> I don't want to give him the opportunity to simmer back there.<eos> No telling what he could do.<eos> Why are you sending him back if you don't trust him?<eos> Because at the moment I'm lacking of a great many things, and options are among them.<eos> So, let me get this straight, you want me to place a classified ad in the paper?<eos> Do it every day, and we'll find it.<eos> Assuming, of course, that some aspect of causality still works.<eos> That's gonna help you snatch us back home, right?
What tore that guy apart.<eos> You have any answers as to why that's happening?<eos> All right.<eos> I can only fix one of your mistakes at a time.<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> 1944, here I come.<eos> The target is the Mission Cross Mental Asylum.<eos> We'll put you as close as we can to the 600 block of Oak Ridge Terrace, Jersey City.<eos> That's where we lost the tether.<eos> It's up to you, Mr. Ramse.
You're looking wrong.<eos> Looking at what wrong?<eos> Time.<eos> You don't know how it works.<eos> But I can show you.<eos> What's that?<eos> This is an answer<eos> from the Red Forest.<eos> These leaves have been altered by disruption of space and time.<eos> I have no doubt they bring you visions, Miss Goines, but they'll also bring you death.

Something wrong with the tether.<eos> Thought you guys were in trouble. The paradox.<eos> - Let's go home, guys.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I need to find the woman who killed Crawford's son.<eos> Cole, it's over.<eos> We gotta get back to 2044.<eos> 2044?<eos> Your country thanks you for your service, Shirley.
Wait a minute.<eos> The guy that you went about in group? The Otter, whatever...<eos> Shh!<eos> What's said in group stays in group.<eos> Oh, uh, be right back.<eos> Order for me, okay?<eos> The usual.<eos> Oh hey, guy.<eos> Miss Goines.<eos> How are you?
Thanks for the tip.<eos> Oh, and you guys have yourselves a beautiful day, huh?<eos> How about a peek at the future?<eos> Got an article here I wrote.<eos> Goes to press in an hour.<eos> "NYPD Bungles Serial Homicide Case."<eos> Our names are all over this.<eos> What, are you assholes trying to blackmail us?<eos> Just trying to help you catch a killer.<eos> All right, if we give you this exclusive, this gets spiked, or you do.
Hey!<eos> - We don't have time for this!<eos> Kyle, tell me where he is!<eos> Kyle!<eos> Shit heel, hey, back off.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> Put him in our car.<eos> Thanks for the tip, Serpico, but your exclusive ends here.<eos> Hey, asshole, we need to speak to him.<eos> I've got the itching for a real nice obstruction charge for you two.

Hi, Daddy. We miss you.<eos> - And love you.<eos> - And love you.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain. No, uh, not at all.<eos> Just, uh, catching up on work.<eos> What is all this?<eos> And?<eos> And the trail's gone cold.<eos> In order to preserve the element of surprise, I wager the best course of action is to travel further back in time, but nothing here indicates where to find him.<eos> Well, perhaps I can help you look.
Rip, tell your crew to let us board, and I will happily save them.<eos> But either way, we are taking the Waverider.<eos> Take the damn deal, Rip.<eos> A captain never surrenders his ship.<eos> Besides, you'll never catch Captain Palmer.<eos> He once outran Kanjar Ro himself.<eos> Who's Kanjar Ro?<eos> Engaging protocol now, Captain.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - I wasn't talking to you.
Rip Hunter.<eos> Miranda Coburn.<eos> Those aren't your real names, are they?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because if our enemies knew our true identities, our ancestors and descendants across the timeline could be potential targets.<eos> As well as anyone else you might love.<eos> Which is why... Personal attachments are expressly forbidden by the Council of Time Masters.<eos> And grounds for immediate discharge from service.<eos> Do either of you deny that you were conducting an illicit affair in violation of this council's rules?

Good luck.<eos> Gideon, open the hatch.<eos> Sorry, Captain.<eos> I can't jerry-rig the door open.<eos> Don't worry, kid.<eos> It's not your fault. It's his.<eos> In case you've forgotten, Mr. Rory, you volunteered to be part of this boarding party.<eos> I volunteered to get away from my partner, who hasn't been acting like my partner ever since you fed his head with fairy tales about saving the world.<eos> Your partner has a mind of his own,<eos> Mr. Rory, which is more than I can say of you.
We've regained control of the Acheron.<eos> What's your status?<eos> What are you gonna do, Snart?<eos> I suppose it wouldn't be very fair if I arrested you after you reclaimed my ship and apprehended John Valor for me.<eos> Happy to help out a fellow Time Master.<eos> Even though I don't deserve that title.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> You've proven that today.<eos> You're still one hell of a Time Master.<eos> Which is why I'm giving you this.
Thank you, Jesse.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Every day you do nothing but make choices.<eos> You choose to be exactly where you are, but ask yourself this... is the person you say you want to be the person you're choosing to be?<eos> Ask yourself, "Am I ch..."<eos> Yeah?<eos> Here's a twenty.<eos> You need change?<eos> On a $9 fare?<eos> What does your heart tell you?

It happens all the time.<eos> Um, I think this is everything you asked for.<eos> You think?<eos> Th-the money, photograph, address, and the key to the house.<eos> - And a floor plan.<eos> - Yes, the floor plan, of course.<eos> So... are we good?<eos> Are we good?<eos> I-I just mean, is that all?<eos> I haven't told you how you will help me.
I am the best me I can...<eos> - _ - Shit.<eos> - How's the job hunt going?<eos> - I have a job.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - Diner in Statesville?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You got fired.<eos> - How'd you know that?<eos> - I went there to check on you.
That's really sad.<eos> I'm your parole officer.<eos> It's almost two hours away.<eos> You have to get a job, Letty, either that or I sign you up for some super fun community service.<eos> Hard pass.<eos> Are we done?<eos> - No.<eos> - I've answered all the questions.<eos> It's almost 7:30.<eos> Don't you have to be home for dinner or something?
Hard pass.<eos> Are we done?<eos> - No.<eos> - I've answered all the questions.<eos> It's almost 7:30.<eos> Don't you have to be home for dinner or something?<eos> I'm divorced.<eos> So, you like to work late to fill the void?<eos> And it helps with the whole sober thing.<eos> How's that going for you?
Yeah.<eos> So, you screwed something up.<eos> For sure.<eos> What's that called?<eos> "Wonder Above the Sea of Fog." You like it?<eos> I like how scared shitless that guy is.<eos> How do you know he's scared?<eos> You can't even see his face.<eos> If you saw somebody on the side of the road, broke down or in an accident or whatever, would you pull over and help?<eos> Did you see somebody who needed help?
Look, here's 50 bucks.<eos> Fine.<eos> Here's $100.<eos> Hey, can I get a...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Another beer?<eos> Why don't you ask the lady what she wants?<eos> I didn't know she was with you.
I'm Letty.<eos> Javier.<eos> "Letty" is short for?<eos> Leticia.<eos> - Leticia.<eos> - I know. It's awful.<eos> You don't hear it every day.<eos> - I got these.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> What do I owe you?
A little bit.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> His name is Javier.<eos> Your husband hired him.<eos> You should go.<eos> - Chase.<eos> - What?<eos> Your husband's name is Chase, right?<eos> Chase gave Javier a floor plan, a key to your house, a photo of you, and $50,000 to kill you.

He'll ask you to go upstairs and check his bedside table.<eos> Can we take the car in the driveway?<eos> I-I'm not leaving with you.
The last thing we need right now is the government hamstringing us with the Accords.<eos> We need to stop Hive by any means necessary.<eos> I'll deal with the government.<eos> You do whatever it takes to end this.<eos> All options on the table?<eos> Desperate times, desperate measures.<eos> You might want to go out the back.<eos> He's coming in.<eos> General Talbot, right on time.<eos> What in the Knievel happened to you?
He's a parasite.<eos> All he wants to do is consume.<eos> But he also has humans in there somewhere, and you've spent significant time with two of them.<eos> We need to know his end game, and we need to know it yesterday.<eos> Son of a gun.<eos> Right under my nose this whole time, like a pack of sewer rats.<eos> I didn't even know this SSR base existed.<eos> It was never on the books.<eos> I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> I'm trusting you with our biggest secret.
El mal presa a los debiles porque teme a los fuertes.<eos> Evil preys on the weak because it fears the strong.<eos> Guy in the black hoodie -- that was him.<eos> We want him alive.<eos> Save all the fun till we're back at the base.<eos> This is exactly why we need the Accords.<eos> It's about protection.<eos> - Whose protection?<eos> - Everyone's.<eos> People need to be protected when one of you runs amok.

Okay, let's see what we have to work with.<eos> Okay, you're gonna need, uh, that tape dispenser, a pencil, your food tray, and a piece of that mirror.<eos> Do you have any idea how to stop him?<eos> I mean, you make him sound invincible.<eos> Calm down, General.<eos> You'll pull something.<eos> "Calm down"?<eos> This is an end-of-the-world type deal.<eos> Don't you tell me to calm down.<eos> I'm the one that tells you to calm down.
Trust us.<eos> Oh, Daisy's back in the system.<eos> She circumnavigated the anti-subversion code and gained access to Lincoln.<eos> That boy sure sleeps a lot.<eos> Unless...<eos> It's a pre-recorded loop.<eos> You're all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Help is on its way.<eos> Trust you?
Unless...<eos> It's a pre-recorded loop.<eos> You're all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Help is on its way.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What have I done?<eos> I think you overcooked them, doc.<eos> How can I trust you when you can't even keep track of your own Inhumans?
I'd like to think that in a town with multiple murders and missing teenagers, the local insane asylum would be fertile ground for clues.<eos> Let's start by reviewing the files of every inmate with a history of violence.<eos> If you wouldn't mind getting me those files, Nurse?<eos> Literally for days.<eos> Is that a new perfume I smell?<eos> You know, if you're trying to drive everyone crazy, I have to tell you, it's working.<eos> I'm very busy right now.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You don't know how to have a good time.<eos> Now, what you need is a man who can show you one.
Are you kidding?<eos> I love tuna surpri...<eos> - Oh, my God...<eos> - Raymond!<eos> These are our new neighbors,<eos> Curtis and Gail.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Tuna surprise.<eos> So many surprises.<eos> Well, another reason why we dropped by was to let you know that we are having a soiree tonight.
Oh, there you are, dear.<eos> I could go for another glass of bubbly.<eos> Then I suggest you find a waitress.<eos> Well, I-I just assumed...<eos> You assumed wrong.<eos> So why don't you go ahead and get your own champagne?<eos> Wow, I guess this whole interracial marriage thing really is a novelty.<eos> Well, go ahead and let them stare.<eos> I've got the most beautiful woman in the room on my arm.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more.
But just so you know, I'm really good at keeping secrets.<eos> Funny you should say that.<eos> I did kiss a girl once.<eos> I didn't think that made me a...<eos> - You know.<eos> What?<eos> It's not a bad word.<eos> Well, it is around here.<eos> Well, good thing I'm not from around here.<eos> Uh, Nurse Lance, may I have a word with you, please?
Rushing a repressed woman from the 1950s into the freewheeling sexual mores of the 21st century...<eos> Actually, I was the one who freaked out.<eos> Ever since I got brought back to life, I haven't really... Experienced much in the way of feelings.<eos> And then when Lindsey kissed me...<eos> It was like you were being kissed for the first time.<eos> How romantic.<eos> It was more like terrifying.<eos> That's the thing that sucks about feelings is, you realize how much you can hurt someone or... get hurt.<eos> - Wakey, wakey.<eos> Do the words "police brutality" mean anything to you?
Beautiful, isn't it?<eos> It's folly!<eos> Franklin would laugh at such adolescent parlor tricks.<eos> I know what you're trying to do, Crane... goad me into jealousy.<eos> You think your delusions of grandeur will set you apart.<eos> Your master will enslave you as surely as the rest of us.<eos> I shall be rewarded for this.<eos> Sooner than you think.<eos> Clever ruse, Crane...<eos> I'll grant you that.
- Past tense.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Whatever we were, he's my boss now.<eos> It's all about timing.<eos> You, of all people, should know that.<eos> Didn't Joe just buy you a trailer?<eos> Did it come with a white picket fence?<eos> I mean, he means well, but sometimes he can just be such a... guy, you know?<eos> Hey, hold on, it looks like you're having some trouble.<eos> Let me help you with that.
Be careful.<eos> Lieutenant, please.<eos> I'm making that face again, aren't I?<eos> Good news is we've knocked that thing back twice now, so it should lay low for a while.<eos> That explains why it was sealed up in that well.<eos> There was no other way to get rid of the thing.<eos> Wait, that explains something else, too.<eos> I took a closer look at those photos and found another phrase: "There is no end."<eos> Look...<eos> I know you said the supernatural has taken a lot from you, but you gotta remember the supernatural has given you a lot of good, too.
I lost it!<eos> The answer to this might be self-evident, but... how is your survival exercise?<eos> We survived.<eos> So, you could see me just by touching the symbol?<eos> Not only that, I could feel your presence, as if I were in the very room with you.<eos> And that's how you found us?<eos> No, once I saw you in peril, I needed to determine a way to locate you.<eos> Fortunately, I had taken several artifacts to the doctor's laboratory, including... The Blavatsky Map. Able to track demonic presence.<eos> I simply followed it to the creature that bedeviled you.<eos> Crane... if the symbol works with the tablet of Witnesses, and it was able to help you...
Uh, Maryland. - ... Maryland for business.<eos> I should be going.<eos> Um, it was nice seeing you again, girls, and it's nice meeting you, Crane.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Take good care of my daughter.<eos> I appear to have missed something. No.<eos> You didn't miss anything.<eos> Pandora.<eos> The other Witness, where is she?<eos> Why would I divulge that to you?
So, tell me, why are you here?<eos> I need the rest of the Box.<eos> It was forged by the gods themselves to contain their power.<eos> It is the only thing that will stop him.<eos> The Hidden One?<eos> Why would we believe that?<eos> Because if you do not, then we will all be extinguished.<eos> So, your impending demise caused a change of heart.<eos> I speak the truth.<eos> If I were to believe you, there must be another way to stop him.
And she needs her Box to stop him. Yes.<eos> But... the Box can only be regenerated in the Catacombs.<eos> You want to go to the Catacombs?<eos> It appears it is our only option.<eos> If you believe Pandora.<eos> Lieutenant, you once allied yourself with her.<eos> To save you.<eos> Now this is to save all of us.<eos> This must be your decision.<eos> I know what that place did to you.
I hate the way that Danny found out.<eos> I should have told him before, so I could have controlled the message.<eos> Agent Reynolds is strong of spirit.<eos> He will be fine.<eos> And if there's one thing I've learned, it is that life rarely allows one the luxury of hewing to one's plans.<eos> The best we can do is adapt to those turns we never see coming.<eos> Go and fetch Betsy Ross.<eos> Tell her we need her help.<eos> Miss Ross has left camp. When?<eos> I don't know, sir, but she said to give you this after the boats returned.
Joe... he's in pain.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I can harness the power of the beast, but I can not direct it with precision.<eos> The Box, Abbie.<eos> Any fragments that you have in your possession... I need them now.<eos> I was really, really hoping that you were not playing me this whole time.<eos> Control yourself, Witness.<eos> The barrier...<eos> Joe, all of it, was a con so you could put your damn<eos> Box back together? I may be devious at a scale that rivals the gods, but I assure you, at this moment, I have no secret motive.
Joe...<eos> Joe.<eos> Crane!<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Wait, wait, wait...<eos> I saw you. Through the Emblem of Thura, I saw you.<eos> You were with Pandora.<eos> I thought all was lost.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Well, thank you, Lieutenant.
Joe.<eos> Crane!<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Wait, wait, wait...<eos> I saw you. Through the Emblem of Thura, I saw you.<eos> You were with Pandora.<eos> I thought all was lost.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Well, thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> It seems yet again, I owe you for my life.
Betsy Ross's flag to guide us to the Catacombs. Once there, we will restore Pandora's box and use it to drain the Hidden One of his power.<eos> Meanwhile, the rest of you will do your damndest to delay him. Slow him down by any means necessary.<eos> I know this is my first rodeo, but we seem very short on actual Intel on this Hidden One, and why the both of you need to go back to the Catacombs.<eos> It can only be restored if both of the Witnesses are present in the Temple of the Gods.<eos> If only one of them goes, the mission will fail.<eos> As in, you're not going?<eos> It's your Box!<eos> Pandora has provided us with detailed instructions how to access the antechamber within the temple.<eos> While she stays conveniently out of harm's way.<eos> None of you stand a chance facing my husband without me.
You're breaking up.<eos> Got them.<eos> Tell Joe good job.<eos> Get back here ASAP.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Mr. Mills, what brings you here?<eos> - Yeah, well, I was close by, thought I'd stop in and say hello.<eos> Oh. Is it a bad time?<eos> It almost impresses me. The insatiable mortal desire to fight what you cannot possibly conquer.<eos> I don't know what I hate about you most:
Look, I don't even know how much Walters knows, but he did refer to Abbie as an asset.<eos> And now you think the fact that she's a Witness has something to do with it.<eos> I messed up.<eos> I can't change that, but I can do my best to protect her.<eos> The least I can do is help save the world.<eos> It's very different in person.<eos> Sadder.<eos> Stranger, if that's possible.<eos> Your bishop, I presume.<eos> A rook, but you did always say that it looked like a bishop, and it was just me trying to get an advantage over you.

Many men on the moon.<eos> The -<eos> - Maaaaah.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Andaz is an inch taller than I am.<eos> Undersecretary Thomas, thank you for getting back to us so quickly.<eos> General Talbot.<eos> General Andaz.<eos> Yes, Undersecretary Thomas.<eos> I have an Arms Nullification order, and I need you to provide the Kill Codes for --
I know you're doing everything you can to try to jog your memory, but when he said absolution --<eos> I told her everything I know.<eos> Just like I told him.<eos> Once we get an update, so will you.<eos> You're a prisoner right now, but that's temporary.<eos> You have to understand -- this -- this is a new situation.<eos> I understand.<eos> The security protocols are in place to keep everyone safe.<eos> I get it.<eos> No one blames you for this.
Is that all you think this is?<eos> That I'm dope sick?<eos> You're not gonna feel like this forever.<eos> I want to.<eos> I want to feel this pain until I find Hive.<eos> And get revenge?<eos> I can't imagine what you've been through, but that craving?<eos> I know something about that.<eos> You think vengeance is the missing piece of the puzzle, that it will make you whole again, but all it does is break you further.<eos> You're going to get better.
I know that you care about us, Ward!<eos> I'm asking you to lead.<eos> I can't hold this much longer.<eos> You think we've done it -- fried his brain?<eos> Let's not wait around and find out.<eos> Do you believe I'm telling you the truth?<eos> Do you believe I'm -- -<eos> "Do you believe I'm telling you the truth?"<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course we believe you.
You got to hurry.<eos> Oh, turtle-man wishes for me to hurry.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Come on.<eos> "There are things about me... you wouldn't like me if you knew."<eos> You wouldn't like me if you knew -- if you knew.<eos> "You wouldn't like me if you knew."<eos> Sir?<eos> Focus.<eos> Let us help you.
I call them "Primitives."<eos> Radcliffe -<eos> - Dr. Holden Radcliffe.<eos> And I really can't apologize enough for what's happened to those people.<eos> No.<eos> You really can't.<eos> But I'm also a victim here.<eos> I was forced to develop that formula.<eos> You better do right by those people.<eos> I can tell by your mustache that you're a man of importance and not to be trifled with, so I will be absolutely honest with you -- the process is irreversible.

Are you sure we can trust them?<eos> LIEUTENANT: They're our fellow countrymen, Corporal.<eos> If we're not protecting them, then who are we protecting?<eos> If they were good Catholics, Mulcahy, they would be morally bound to surrender to the overwhelming odds in order to prevent useless sacrifice.<eos> But how will we look if we support a foreign imperial Protestant power against our own, Your Grace?<eos> For the past 20 years, I've worked with Mr Redmond and the Irish Party to see Home Rule achieved in this country, and for the Catholic Church to be at the centre of the new parliament.<eos> I'm only suggesting that we keep contact, to keep the door open.<eos> When I was with him at the post office, I felt something, Your Grace.<eos> Something powerful, something positive, something we should be a part of.<eos> They're hooligans, Father Mulcahy, and I forbid you to have anything more to do with them.
Did you have someone else?<eos> It was more I changed.<eos> How?<eos> I began to know my own mind.<eos> Before this, everything used to frighten me, but now, in spite of all this, I'm not so afraid.<eos> I'm of some use.<eos> MAN: Are you ready?<eos> ELIZABETH:<eos> Well?<eos> General Lowe thanks you for your advice regarding the collection and burial of civilian bodies,
Interesting question.<eos> No one's ever been clever enough to try that before.<eos> Actually, the hospital will sue you and come after your wages.<eos> Who's next?<eos> That's right, no wedding.<eos> Yeah. Don't come.<eos> Buh-bye.<eos> No, you have a great day, Spencer.<eos> And can I just say what a pleasure it has been to work with such an absolute professional.<eos> I'm gonna give you a five star Yelp review right this second.
Oh, come on.<eos> That thing you said about suing people got my attention.<eos> So I chatted up a few folks, and you know what?<eos> Everybody I met owes this hospital money.<eos> But how can that be?<eos> How is this happening?<eos> Since this isn't my area of the law,<eos> I ran my questions by a colleague in malpractice and she told me that in addition to having a very high rate of billing code error, you guys have set a record in the area for surprise charges, and litigating against patients,<eos> and I'm pretty sure that under the Affordable Care Act,<eos> Federal Regulation 7-8-9-5-4, you're not supposed to do that.
I'm gonna place your wrists in these restraints during extubation, okay?<eos> All right, Emma, if I could just get you to look this way for me.<eos> That's great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi, Emma.<eos> Oh, we've got a full house.<eos> All right, we're just gonna suction one more time.<eos> - Should I leave?<eos> - No. Okay, Emma, all I need you to do is to cough and to blow out when I tell you to.
We thought it might be impossible to find a hotel in Otter Creek with the cider festival going on.<eos> I see.<eos> Yeah, no, it's been quiet around here.<eos> You can take your pick.<eos> Oh, I love this place...<eos> the whole setup.<eos> Uber retro.<eos> It's very cool.<eos> Sort of mid-century.<eos> Mm, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Alex, thank you.<eos> From the bottom of my heart, thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> So you're from Portland?<eos> Yeah, we make specialty cider there.<eos> We use nine different types of apples.<eos> Oh, uh, well, that's a lot of apples.<eos> I'm particularly partial to the Arkansas Black apple.<eos> Oh, you know your apples.<eos> I'll put you in room seven, for good luck.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.<eos> Just write a script for me, so I don't have to think for myself.<eos> Honey, I would shove my hand up your ass and control your mouth like a Muppet if it would win you an Oscar.<eos> What do I know? I'm just the publicist you hired to help win you an Oscar.<eos> [woman] What's it like to play Seabiscuit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.<eos> [man] Your last attempt at a comeback was The BoJack Horseman Show.<eos> Pass.<eos> [man 2] People still see you as the guy from that sucky show from the '90s.
And you are Secretariat.<eos> And you... are Secretariat.<eos> BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie and I think such a textured performance.<eos> When you were on Horsin' Around, could you ever have imagined that you'd give a performance like this?<eos> - Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.<eos> - [laughter] I always knew I was more than just a dumb TV actor.<eos> Even if other people didn't always know that.<eos> - Seriously, though... that TV show... it wasn't me.<eos> This movie is me.<eos> And I can't tell you how great it feels to finally be doing the kind of work that I can be proud of.
Catch our breath.<eos> Looks like a good place.<eos> It'll be safer.<eos> How do you know?<eos> You see that?<eos> Light came on in that house.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> I'll stay. Make sure our radar friend moves past us.<eos> When he's gone, we're gone.<eos> Ofelia and I will keep you company.
- You don't know what's back there.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - I know what's there.<eos> It's our home. This is still our home.<eos> Seth, your dad doesn't want this anymore. He told us to take care of him.<eos> My father told me what he wants.<eos> - He taught me.<eos> - But he changed his mind.<eos> No, no, I don't believe you.
You committed yourself, Norman.<eos> Do you not want to be here?<eos> No.<eos> My mother made me.<eos> She wants me to be here.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> She spoke to me about you before you had been admitted.<eos> Oh, oh, so she was planning all of this, then?<eos> I think she was just very worried about you.<eos> She was worried she no longer knew how to help you.
I hope so.<eos> What if he says something wrong?<eos> All the secrets that I've tried to hide, things that other people won't understand.<eos> I have no control over any of it, and I have tried so hard for so long to protect him, until I couldn't.<eos> In a way, it doesn't matter. It's out there, for better or for worse, it's out of my hands.<eos> The chips will fall, so we'll see what happens.<eos> You know, I think that...<eos> I think maybe it's all gonna be okay, Norma.<eos> You just have to allow it to be.<eos> Do you think you're going to feel like talking today?
You know, I think that...<eos> I think maybe it's all gonna be okay, Norma.<eos> You just have to allow it to be.<eos> Do you think you're going to feel like talking today?<eos> I just have blackouts.<eos> Can I just get some medicine for that?<eos> You absolutely can.<eos> Your mom says that sometimes you talk to people who aren't there, that sometimes you can get violently angry.<eos> So can she.<eos> How can I help you, Norman?
You absolutely can.<eos> Your mom says that sometimes you talk to people who aren't there, that sometimes you can get violently angry.<eos> So can she.<eos> How can I help you, Norman?<eos> You want to know a secret?<eos> Everyone needs help.<eos> Someone is paying a lot of money for you to be here, so you should take advantage of it.<eos> No one comes here for the food.<eos> You committed yourself, Norman.<eos> On some level, you want help.

- Hey, a little help, please.<eos> No, let me through.<eos> He wants to speak to me. Hey!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Easy, Norman.<eos> Easy. Get off me!<eos> I just want to talk to him!<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard you were upset.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't see you earlier.
Easy. Get off me!<eos> I just want to talk to him!<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard you were upset.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't see you earlier.<eos> I was in the middle of a session.<eos> Oh, no, that's...<eos> That's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I do need to tell you something.
No.<eos> You okay, Bar?<eos> I'm good, yeah.<eos> It's just a lot.<eos> Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne should have been erased out of existence, right?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> It's possible Eobard was in the Speed Force, protecting him like a bomb shelter, keeping him alive and his time line intact.<eos> It's what's known as a "time line remnant"<eos> A what now?<eos> Here, let me... show you.
- I'm gonna miss you.<eos> - Miss you too.<eos> - It's nice to know someone will.<eos> - Wait, we talking about Barry?<eos> 'Cause it sounds like we're talking about Barry.<eos> He kept telling me there was stuff he couldn't share with me and I've been going a little crazy trying to figure out what that stuff is.<eos> Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing.<eos> - Neither are you.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Barry just told me that, you know, sometimes he helps you out with S.T.A.R. Labs stuff.
I-I don't want another person that Zoom or Reverse-Flash or any of these meta-humans can use against me.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Patty can't get hurt over this.<eos> Tachyons!<eos> 87th and Avenue J.<eos> Must be one of Mercury Labs' off-site facilities.<eos> Hack into their se...<eos> I've hacked in the security feed.<eos> - And once that...<eos> - I'm one step ahead of you.
Who are you?<eos> No one of consequence.<eos> No. I doubt that.<eos> I win again, Flash.<eos> All you have to do is provide him with enough momentum to get him past the space-time barrier.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Hey, listen to me.<eos> Thawne knows about you.<eos> Right here, right now.<eos> This is where he learns about you, all of you.
But that hurt stays in there with you.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Listen, I may not always show it, but I --<eos> May!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> If you kill me, you'll die.<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear.<eos> I have a weapon in place on this plane that's designed to kill you.<eos> So if you shoot me, I can't tell you what that is.
You and I - have a connection, right?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I swept the plane.<eos> Didn't see anything.<eos> I'm telling the truth, I swear.<eos> You won't see it.<eos> - Show me. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, just let me put this down.<eos> Remember, we don't want to hurt you if we don't have to.
You won't see it.<eos> - Show me. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, just let me put this down.<eos> Remember, we don't want to hurt you if we don't have to.<eos> People that are under sway -- they're not in control of their actions.<eos> They're not bad people.<eos> Well, except you.<eos> You were a murderous wank before all this.<eos> I did tell you.
I don't need anymore agents dying for my lapses in judgment.<eos> So you acknowledge that you'll die.<eos> I'm prepared to.<eos> If you plan on blowing this plane up with both of us onboard, it won't end this.<eos> Millions will still be turned.<eos> Yeah, they won't be handsome, but at least they won't be swayed and stuck with your winning personality.<eos> I'll end you first.<eos> And sense of humor.<eos> Look, I'll do whatever it takes.<eos> I crossed a line with you -- a line I vowed never to cross.
Early today.<eos> Well, you should eat.<eos> I will.<eos> After the meet.<eos> I don't know why you're so sure today's the day.<eos> I mean, you said the same thing a week ago.<eos> Just got a feeling.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm gonna eat.<eos> I wanted to thank you.
Most people, in any time period, aren't that lucky.<eos> Which gives us mesoscopic polymer and biomolecular simulations.<eos> Yes, Mr. Gates?<eos> If that's true, and you can soften matter, then doesn't that mean you could theoretically miniaturize an atom?<eos> In theory, yes.<eos> But trust me, you don't want to try it at home.<eos> And definitely not for at least another, mm, 40 years.<eos> Uh, aren't you supposed to be at home?<eos> I thought you said your son was sick. Yes, William.<eos> My in-laws are at my house, so if you don't mind, I'd rather be in here.
He's more than just a criminal and an arsonist.<eos> He's a member of our team.<eos> He's a lost cause.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.<eos> You will see that miracles abound on this old timeship.<eos> Gideon, start the regeneration process.<eos> What do you mean by "regeneration"?<eos> I took genetic samples from each of you at the start of our voyage for this exact eventuality.<eos> Why am I only hearing about this now?<eos> Because none of you had lost a limb yet.
You're one constant in a sea of variables.<eos> No matter what anyone tries to do, I will never leave.<eos> I will always be right here.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> They're gonna try and get rid of me again, and I need you to not let them.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I will never leave you.<eos> I will never leave you alone again.<eos> I am Mr. Robot.<eos> I've always told you we'd end up working together, Elliot, but still
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't, right?<eos> Do you feel alone?<eos> Darlene comes by sometimes.<eos> Is there anything you miss about your old life?<eos> It doesn't matter even if I did.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> 'Cause I can't trust myself back there.<eos> Why do you think you can't trust yourself?<eos> I'd like you to respond to my question, please.<eos> Elliot, it took a lot for me to talk to you after what you did, but I agreed with the condition that you were going to be more open with me.
- Go ahead, tell him.<eos> Tell him that you're slowly descending into madness.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - What?<eos> Stop what?<eos> There are only so many times before my bullets finally penetrate that thick skull of yours, and as the blood trickles out, so goes any sense of reason.<eos> Round and round we go, you not knowing what you did or didn't do, our infinite loop of insanity.<eos> If you know anything at all, or if there's anything you can do to help me...<eos> I need you to.<eos> I can't help you.
Now you're telling me you can't help me?<eos> What kind of business is this?<eos> I've been responsible for the last 20 years in paying off my home.<eos> Where's your accountability?<eos> Yet, if the tables were turned, you would have kicked me out of my own house.<eos> You know what?<eos> Cancel my account.<eos> I'm done doing business with you crooks.<eos> You deserve what you're getting.<eos> Ma'am, I can't say for sure we can give you all your money if you close right now.
Did you...?<eos> - One sec, bud.<eos> You're fucking me.<eos> Oh, you are fucking me.<eos> - Chad? - Ha-ha!<eos> - You're so fucking me right now, man.<eos> - All right, I got a friend, but... Stop it.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> What is Rebirth?<eos> Uh, let me tell you about Rebirth.
Why did you teach me to read, then?<eos> See?<eos> Lord looking out for you.<eos> Good morning, Abigail.<eos> Is your master home?<eos> Major André isn't here, sir, nor is he my master.<eos> Quite right.<eos> My apologies.<eos> He is mine, however, insofar as I owe him my current station and must harken to his summons.<eos> Oh, I see Akinbode succeeded in his task of delivering your son to you.

I assumed he went to you.
Buried?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're improving.<eos> Not really.<eos> Mary said that you wanted to speak to me.<eos> Did she?<eos> Yes.<eos> Something of a private, personal matter that you were debating whether or not to come forward with.<eos> Yes.<eos> Um... yes, I... there was something I wish to speak with you about.
I was thinking, and I wonder if it may not be better for all, if I moved back into Strong Manor.<eos> When Abraham spoke of intruding on his father's hospitality, I was forced to examine my own imposition.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, that might be a problem.<eos> Well, I don't seek to reclaim ownership, of course.<eos> Just residence.<eos> Anna.<eos> I mean a problem for me.<eos> When you say it would be better for all, I can't help but think that you're referring to the magistrate.<eos> For you, leaving Whitehall could not be seen as anything else than a very dark day for the man who now sits before you.
When you say it would be better for all, I can't help but think that you're referring to the magistrate.<eos> For you, leaving Whitehall could not be seen as anything else than a very dark day for the man who now sits before you.<eos> A year ago, I would not have been able to say these things without tripping over my tongue,<eos> but I'm not the same man as I was.<eos> I've been changed by this place, by what I've seen... what I have survived.<eos> And by the people I've met.<eos> My dear Anna, ever since I've had the opportunity of knowing you, I've been in love with you.<eos> And I have no doubts that you perceive my passions to be sincere.<eos> If you allow me to be your protector through life, I swear that I will commit myself to your happiness and I pray that you know that I make my intentions clear and from the deepest and strictest motives of respect.<eos> Uh... thank you.
Her sister Betsy?<eos> Could be weeks.<eos> It could be months.<eos> It could be months.<eos> I need privacy.<eos> "Dear Miss Shippen, I am pleased to hear from Miss Franks of your impending union.<eos> Allow me to wish you the greatest joy.<eos> Your friends here remark how they hope one day to meet your future husband, but they well understand the obstacles to such a meeting.<eos> And though they miss you dreadfully, they know you are doing everything you can to ensure the brightest future possible."<eos> Mr. Goodrich, I don't know what else to tell you.
Stay, please.<eos> General Arnold!<eos> Go.<eos> Go there.<eos> General Arnold!<eos> Check the inventory against the manifest.<eos> What is this?<eos> A warrant signed by Congress.<eos> I want it all marked.<eos> Signed by you.
We need to get out of the open.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> We shouldn't have ditched the car.<eos> We shouldn't be on foot!<eos> Were you in the military, law enforcement?<eos> - No.<eos> - Right.<eos> Still, I don't think this is a good idea.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Those people were coming after you.
Even kings have limits to their power, Will.<eos> We're gonna have to hole up here till help arrives.<eos> No.<eos> No more Redhats.<eos> We can't trust them.<eos> I've got to call the Task Force.<eos> We can't trust them either.<eos> Nothing goes over the air.<eos> Well, we can't hide in here forever.<eos> I promise you, as we speak, everyone loyal to me is hitting the streets.
You should ask my Navy captain father how he felt about me marrying an enlisted Army grunt.<eos> Where does your family live now?<eos> New Orleans...<eos> If it's still around.<eos> I honestly have no idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how did you get involved in all this?<eos> I mean, putting aside the conspiracy theories that this was planned for decades and our government was somehow complicit...<eos> Somebody must have approached you, right?<eos> Or recruited you before handing you a crown.
Snyder is an asshole who deserves what's coming to him.<eos> All we have to do is step out of the way.<eos> And then another bureaucrat with a new agenda replaces him.<eos> Snyder is the devil we know.<eos> How's the arm?<eos> I'll live.<eos> I know that this isn't an ideal situation... for a lot of reasons.<eos> But I'm a good friend to have.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I was gonna tell you this at our meeting today.
There's a ton of red tape and bureaucracy.<eos> All right, look...<eos> I don't have the power to navigate this on my own.<eos> - Of course you don't.<eos> - But I'm working on it.<eos> Understand that I am really exposing myself here for you guys.<eos> This is not something I would do for anyone else.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Negotiating... with the Chief of Staff to the Governor General of the entire Los Angeles colony.<eos> I was going to introduce you to her before we got... waylaid.
- Negotiating... with the Chief of Staff to the Governor General of the entire Los Angeles colony.<eos> I was going to introduce you to her before we got... waylaid.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - Helena Goldwyn.<eos> She has the power to make this whole Charlie thing happen.<eos> How do we know you're not just saying this to get what you want?<eos> Come on, Katie, give me a little credit.<eos> This is family. Mm-hmm.<eos> I wouldn't lie about something like that.<eos> I promise you, I'm on your side, and I want to see this happen just as much...

Slow them down?<eos> How? I'm gonna hole up here... shoot whoever comes through those doors.<eos> I'm having a drink.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> You still believe anything that man says?<eos> I have to believe him... because I don't know what else there is.<eos> Even if it risks your life?<eos> Our lives?<eos> Everything we have is tied to him.<eos> I'd like to remind everyone who might be paying attention that I rescued your husband and all the rest of you from a life of misery and imprisonment.
Hey... aah!<eos> Jesus!<eos> - Hold it.<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> Let's see how long he survives without us!<eos> I realize that we are all in an unusually stressful situation... that does not bring out the best in us, so I'm willing to forget this.<eos> That's because I'm a reasonable man.<eos> And if you think otherwise, then you really don't want to meet the people who spend their days plotting to take my seat.<eos> I'm sorry to be the bearer of unpleasant truths, Katie... but I'm the best there is.<eos> And I really am trying to help you.
- They're not with us. - You are...<eos> - Maddie.<eos> - I'm working for Charlotte.<eos> - My wife has excellent taste. - Whatever you're going through, we're going through together.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> Why can't I go to school anymore?<eos> Because the government is giving us a tutor, and that's gonna be your new teacher.<eos> - Your son Charlie is alive.<eos> - If you are lying about this...<eos> I really want to help you get him back.
20.<eos> A friend.<eos> Get in.<eos> Come on.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I figured out how to search photos.<eos> We have one face with 14 different identities.<eos> U.S., Canadian, German, French-Algerian...<eos> - Damn.<eos> - This mean something to you?
New place?<eos> It's called Hillhaven.<eos> Ingrid Bergman lived here once, I'm told.<eos> Bored of the other house?<eos> I keep a few different places.<eos> For convenience.<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Not gonna turn that down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I had to pull a lot of strings to get you access to the Rolodex.
Please don't touch the art.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Charlotte wants you to manage the correspondence today.<eos> What?<eos> You put me back on envelope duty?<eos> Brett will set you up.<eos> Charlotte, I don't understand.<eos> No, apparently you don't.<eos> You serve at my pleasure.<eos> Whatever I've been kind enough to give you, I can take back just as quickly.

I hate it here.<eos> This place birthed all our pain and sorrow.<eos> I refuse to let it be the place where our sister dies.<eos> Let us not wait for Kol and his witch's tricks... let us simply tear this town apart and find her.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> See, I just ran every single vampire out of this town, so... visiting hours are, well... never.<eos> Ah, hello, luv.<eos> We're here for a spot of search and potentially destroy.<eos> Do tell, where are the areas off-limits to general staff?<eos> You just wait right here... and I'll have someone out here to help you with your inquiry.
I'm very proud of you for what you did today.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And so is the Master.<eos> Speaking of which... get your things together, we're leaving here.<eos> Where are we going now?<eos> The Master has revealed himself, and we are going to join him.<eos> You know, at first, I wondered why the professor wanted you up in Palmer's penthouse with him, but now I think I got it.<eos> Keep the weakest link close.<eos> You gotta hit me, huh? Either with your fist or with insults.<eos> Did nothing Setrakian said land with you?
Yes, sir.<eos> I will be back for both of you, shortly.<eos> Mr. Desai... your duties are about to expand greatly.<eos> You will be pleased to learn that we have a great need for a helpful human confederate.<eos> That's very good to hear, Mr. Eichhorst.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Humans... think of evolution in terms of progress and advancement.<eos> This final errand will be the catalyzing event precipitating a new era on Earth, akin to the meteor that felled the dinosaurs and ushered in the Ice Age.<eos> I'm honoured, sir... and humbled.<eos> Once we dock, you will take the suitcase and place it exactly where I showed you on the map.
"yearning to breathe free,<eos> "the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<eos> "Send these, the homeless,<eos> "tempest-tossed to me.<eos> "I lift my lamp beside the shining door."<eos> What is it?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm going to have a look around.<eos> Godspeed, everyone.<eos> You too, Professor.
Previously, on Colony...<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Does it work?<eos> Not unless I can find a high-quality lens.<eos> I think I can get one for you.
Broussard work for you?<eos> I know he's the guy you want, and I'm prepared to give him up.<eos> I've decided to make a deal, and you're gonna negotiate on my behalf.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because you're invested.<eos> If you succeed, I'll disappear, and your wife's secret will disappear with me.<eos> If you fail, her name will be the first thing I spill under interrogation.<eos> People died for you, and you're just gonna sell 'em out?<eos> You know, you work for the Occupation.<eos> Do I really need to justify anything to you?
Where is he?<eos> Waiting to make sure he isn't being set up.<eos> How do we know we're not being set up?<eos> We don't, but you wanted to meet him.<eos> So, you're the guy, huh?<eos> What do I call you?<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Care to explain, Mr. "Whatever-You-Want," why I should trust a man willing to stab his own friends in the back?<eos> Because you're a survivor, like me.<eos> I can give you what you need.
Whatever you want.<eos> Care to explain, Mr. "Whatever-You-Want," why I should trust a man willing to stab his own friends in the back?<eos> Because you're a survivor, like me.<eos> I can give you what you need.<eos> Something real.<eos> Broussard.<eos> If you want him, you need me to set him up.<eos> In exchange, he wants to get outside the Colony.<eos> Why would you want that?<eos> Because I'm a pessimist when it comes to the future of the bloc, and I have no desire to live under the thumb of you or your compatriots or the RAPs.
All right.<eos> Now what?<eos> He was dead when we got there.<eos> The guards were too.<eos> Must have been Broussard.<eos> How could Broussard possibly know about our rendition house?<eos> How's he pull off half the things he's done?<eos> I don't like it either, sir, but that's how it went down.<eos> Something about this doesn't smell right.<eos> I want the truth, or all the goodwill that you've built with me, favors that you thought you were owed-- gone!

- He's awake.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You're being released to go home.<eos> Oh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you need us to call anyone?<eos> About what?<eos> Any relatives... someone to come pick you up.<eos> You've lost your mother.<eos> You understand this, right?
Do you need us to call anyone?<eos> About what?<eos> Any relatives... someone to come pick you up.<eos> You've lost your mother.<eos> You understand this, right?<eos> Carbon monoxide poisoning can affect memory.<eos> I'm so sorry, Norman. I...<eos> I know this must be very hard for you.<eos> Grieving's a complicated process.<eos> These will guide you through it.
Mm-hmm, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, I... I just dropped it.<eos> It was broken, and I'm just trying to get it to the dumpster.<eos> Are you Norman Bates?<eos> Yes, yes, I am.<eos> I'm Detective Chambers from the Oregon State Police.<eos> Oh. I'd like to talk to you.
I, uh...<eos> I've been at the Pineview Institute for the last two weeks, and they got married while I was there.<eos> But surely they had a relationship before that.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I... I loved my mother more than anything in the world, but she did not have stellar taste in men.<eos> The men that she's been with have all turned out to be nightmares... manipulative and abusive.<eos> I... I don't know what precisely was going on with this Alex Romero, but I never trusted him.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Uh... uh, I'm sure you've heard things around town... you know, about how he dealt with the drug trade. And I...<eos> I don't need to tell you.
Norman would like to see his mother.<eos> He's not supposed to be in here.<eos> Sabel...<eos> Fine.<eos> Mother.<eos> Mother, I wish you had just told me the plan.<eos> Hey, listen, I just got a customer, so I got to call you back.<eos> Okay, bye-bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?
He's not supposed to be in here.<eos> Sabel...<eos> Fine.<eos> Mother.<eos> Mother, I wish you had just told me the plan.<eos> Hey, listen, I just got a customer, so I got to call you back.<eos> Okay, bye-bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Can I help you?
Okay, ready?<eos> Look at me, Mother.<eos> Mother, look at me.<eos> Look at me, Mother.<eos> I'm right here, Mother.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Mother, look at me now.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Can I help you?
She was a lovely woman... too lovely for this world.<eos> It'll be a darker place without her.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Yes, well, I'm, uh... thank you, but it... this is really just not a good time, so...<eos> I...<eos> I understand. I just wanted to do something.<eos> Chicken enchilada casserole.<eos> I made it.<eos> Thank you for stopping by.<eos> I, uh... this is really very kind of you, very much.
The mob stayed quiet longer than I thought, but the wheels are spinning now.<eos> This whole damn place is going to hell.<eos> We were waiting for opportunity to knock.<eos> Well, here it is. You think this is enough to sell Snyder on our story?<eos> I think after this, he'll eat it right out of our hands.<eos> I specifically tripled last night's Homeland Security detail to avoid this.<eos> What the hell happened? There were a lot of people on the street before curfew last night, mostly in peaceful recognition of the anniversary.<eos> There was some looting, a few protests that turned violent, but most of the violence appears to have been spontaneous and random.<eos> - Most, but not all. There were four or five incidents that may have been coordinated.<eos> Proxy, can we talk to you in private?
How would they get in and out? Maybe someone found a way under the wall that the RAPs never sealed.<eos> What's important here is it looks like someone's invested in making you look bad.<eos> The scarier attacks from last night were all well-orchestrated, but then everyone vanished without a trace.<eos> It's like when the Taliban was hiding out in Pakistan.<eos> Nobody had the balls to cross the border and go after them.<eos> Everyone looked the other way, so they had safe haven.<eos> Let's say for a moment that I was interested in exploring this.<eos> Let us take a run through the wall into downtown, check it out.<eos> All right.<eos> Do it. Lagarza's unit will come with you.
It's him! It's him! It's him...<eos> My name is Lucas Vidal,<eos> I have been a priest specialized in exorcism for 35 years.<eos> For believers, I am the salvation.<eos> To unbelievers, I am a farce.<eos> EXORCISM RITUAL<eos> Father Lucas!<eos> Father Lucas?<eos> Hi.<eos> Two young boys are at the gate and want to talk to you, they are producing a movie.
Would you like some water, some coffee?<eos> - Yes, I'll have some coffee.<eos> - I want some water.<eos> And you, Priest?<eos> For me nothing, thanks, sister. Thank you very much.<eos> Then, excuse me.<eos> Yesterday, on the phone, you told me that you are producing a film about exorcism.<eos> That's right, Father.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Well, as you already know, Bruno and I just graduated.
What are you talking about?<eos> Jonas, what are you doing? - Jonas!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Jonas!<eos> Jonas, what is this?<eos> Jonas, my love!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Jonas!<eos> - Father Lucas!<eos> - Hi, Eduardo, how are you?
- Dad!<eos> Jonas!<eos> Jonas, what is this?<eos> Jonas, my love!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Jonas!<eos> - Father Lucas!<eos> - Hi, Eduardo, how are you?<eos> You were in there and I did not even see you...<eos> - How are you?
- Hi, Eduardo, how are you?<eos> You were in there and I did not even see you...<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine, thank God!<eos> - What about the seminar?<eos> - Well, it's going very well.<eos> Sorry I came this way in this rush, but remember your old teacher?<eos> - Father José?<eos> - Yes of course!<eos> He asked me to give you a message. Wow!
- I'm fine, thank God!<eos> - What about the seminar?<eos> - Well, it's going very well.<eos> Sorry I came this way in this rush, but remember your old teacher?<eos> - Father José?<eos> - Yes of course!<eos> He asked me to give you a message. Wow!<eos> Father José, I haven't spoken with him for two years,<eos> I'm curious, I want to hear.<eos> He did not tell me much, Father Lucas, just asked me to deliver this letter to you.

Wow!<eos> Father José, I haven't spoken with him for two years,<eos> I'm curious, I want to hear.<eos> He did not tell me much, Father Lucas, just asked me to deliver this letter to you.<eos> And he said the matter is one of extreme urgency.<eos> I'll read it and I'll get in touch with him.<eos> So that's fine, now I need to go.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm late for class. Go there, I don't want to disturb you.<eos> - God be with you!<eos> - You too.

- the case of Maria Lúcia.<eos> - Right.<eos> And they had to use the ritual of the cross, you know... abolished in the Middle Ages by the church itself.<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Wait! Wait!<eos> What does this have to do with me, with my future, with my life?<eos> Everything, everything, Lucas.<eos> Father Pedro Biaggio, he came to find an apprentice to replace him, Lucas.<eos> And have they found this apprentice yet?<eos> - I told him about you.
I always dreamed of meeting the Biaggios and now I'm going to be his student, his apprentice, my God in heaven!<eos> - So, Lucas.<eos> - Wow!<eos> Father José, did he make an appointment?<eos> Is this meeting already scheduled?<eos> - Because I need to prepare myself.<eos> - Calm down, calm down!<eos> He said that as soon as everything is ready, that is, at the right time, he will call you himself.<eos> Look...<eos> I don't even know how to thank you.
He shot himself in the head in front of the whole family.<eos> And until today, I've been looking for answers, I don't know why he did it.<eos> Father Jaime, already deceased, without the help of the Vatican, suspected that he was possessed by a demon, called Alus Mabus.<eos> And your father, of course, in the last act of faith, did what he did to save you, not him.<eos> But how do you know all this?<eos> I'm Lúcia,<eos> I worked with Father Jaime for 15 years, that is the reason.<eos> Oh, I knew!<eos> Look, Mrs. Lúcia, you removed a gigantic weight off my back.<eos> And I thank you for that.
Deep down, I already knew,<eos> I just needed to listen.<eos> Good, excuse me now.<eos> Mrs. Lúcia, do you live near here?<eos> I live on the other side of the street with my son, Alberto.<eos> - He's the one who takes care of me.<eos> - Not long ago, right?<eos> Yes, yes, recently.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I make a point of accompanying you.
Yes, yes, recently.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I make a point of accompanying you.<eos> So let's go.<eos> May God be with you!<eos> With you too.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Hi!<eos> Can I help you?
You cannot have accompanied my mother, it's impossible.<eos> But I accompanied her.<eos> My mother died 15 years ago in Santa Barbara de Graças.<eos> What do you mean, she died?<eos> My mother died!<eos> But I...<eos> - Wait a minute, priest what?<eos> - It's Father Lucas.<eos> Which Father Lucas, is it some joke?<eos> You're joking, are you here with someone?
- Are you crazy? Calm down.<eos> - You're useless!<eos> Lucas, your soul will be mine.<eos> The bastard got me.<eos> He got me.<eos> The bastard got me.<eos> Sir...<eos> The bastard got me, Lucas.<eos> Who got you, Sir?<eos> If you stay, I can help you...
If you stay, I can help you...<eos> Father!<eos> Ready?<eos> Father Lucas?<eos> This is father Pedro Biaggio.<eos> - Oh, father Pedro!<eos> - Am I disturbing you?<eos> Not at all, not at all...<eos> You're not bothering.<eos> And by the way, I don't know how to tell you this, but it seems that it was transmission of thought, because I just had a nightmare with you.
Sit down.<eos> Okay.<eos> First of all, Father Pedro, I wanted to thank you...<eos> Lucas, I've separated this for you.<eos> - Thank you, Father Pedro, I...<eos> - Open it!<eos> It was blessed by our Holy Pope.<eos> I think it will be very useful.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lucas, I'm going to give you absolution.
Father Thomas, I swear, I did everything to save your brother,<eos> I did what I could...<eos> But I could not,<eos> I think he made a bad choice.<eos> I didn't feel prepared... I think...<eos> So I must conclude, that in this moment of terror you have taken my brother's place and without practice, exorcised the girl.<eos> Yes, that was it, in the midst of all confusion<eos> I don't even know how it happened, I don't even know...<eos> Father Lucas, my son...<eos> You ask me why my brother chose you, because he, as I, have seen in you, exceptional qualities to replace him.
- Thank you.<eos> - May the Lord be with you!<eos> - He is between us!<eos> Bless them all, almighty God.<eos> The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> Go in peace.<eos> May the Lord be with you!<eos> Thank God!<eos> I want to tell you something new.
Thank you very much!<eos> The pleasure is mine.<eos> I am a photographer here in the region and also in the parish.<eos> I've been following some of your work for some time.<eos> How wonderful!<eos> What is your name?<eos> - My name is Erick.<eos> - This is Father Lucas.<eos> - Hi, Father Lucas.<eos> - How are you?
Would be great!<eos> Even because I want to take a picture of you to the Vatican.<eos> I want to introduce you there.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Just one more.<eos> Ready, it was great!<eos> Wonderful, thank you!<eos> Would you be able to arrange me a copy?<eos> Only you can give me your contact, your address...<eos> Please give me a paper so I give you my address.
What's happening, Father Thomas?<eos> What is going on?<eos> Why am I tied up?<eos> What's happening, Father Thomas?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Father Thomas, it's me Lucas.<eos> Lucas, your friend.<eos> It is you!<eos> Father Lucas, my friend!<eos> Father Thomas, if anything is dominating you, some evil force, resist!
Lucas, your friend.<eos> It is you!<eos> Father Lucas, my friend!<eos> Father Thomas, if anything is dominating you, some evil force, resist!<eos> You're stronger than that. You're stronger than that!<eos> - I'm stronger.<eos> - You are!<eos> - I am!<eos> - Let me go.<eos> Set me free, I can help you.
Father Lucas, my friend!<eos> Father Thomas, if anything is dominating you, some evil force, resist!<eos> You're stronger than that. You're stronger than that!<eos> - I'm stronger.<eos> - You are!<eos> - I am!<eos> - Let me go.<eos> Set me free, I can help you.<eos> Let me go.<eos> I can help you.
I don't take orders from you.<eos> I can't believe I ever did.<eos> Well, that's debatable.<eos> I'm calling on you for two reasons.<eos> First, we could use your help.<eos> What's the second reason?<eos> We're headed to 2147 to engage Savage.<eos> Is that the second reason or the first?<eos> Ah, forget it.<eos> I owe you an apology, Mr. Rory.
I don't see him.<eos> It's because he's surrounded by Daddy's goon squad.<eos> Northeast corner of the plaza.<eos> Got him.<eos> You sure you don't want to just shoot him?<eos> It'd be a whole lot easier.<eos> Stick to the plan, both of you.<eos> Now, Ms. Lance.<eos> I'm in position.<eos> It's up to you now, Mr. Snart.
No, I imagine he had someone do it for him, didn't he?<eos> You're hardly lacking in tutors, are you... such as Mr. Savage.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My son Jonas always wanted to learn to swim.<eos> I promised him that I'd teach him, but there never seemed to be... time.<eos> My son never learned to swim, because he was killed.<eos> So... you brought me here to kill me.<eos> I brought you here to save my son's life, your life in exchange for his.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No you're not.

You're trying to tell me that you're Sidney Palmer?<eos> Sidney?<eos> Wait, the bust in your lobby is of my stupid brother?<eos> Of course.<eos> He must have gone to work for Felicity in 2016 after I vanished.<eos> He allowed my tech to be perverted by the defense industry. That is so Sidney.<eos> So that means that she's not...<eos> I'm not a father.<eos> So we still need your help disabling the robots.<eos> A... and why should I believe you?
Damn reruns.<eos> "Even then, a wish, I mind its pow'r,<eos> "A wish that to my latest hour<eos> "Shall strongly heave my breast,<eos> That I for poor auld Scotland's sake..."<eos> All right, you little monsters!<eos> You've awakened Scotland's shame!<eos> Willie, you know you can't play that torture trumpet to kids.<eos> I'll just use it to vape, then.<eos> Class, I would like you to meet your new teacher, retired Air Force Sergeant Ms. Berrera.
Can you meet me after class?<eos> No problemo.<eos> I can move my 3:30 freeze tag.<eos> Ugh, just cancel.<eos> Bart, I'm glad that you're trying, but I am worried that you're starting from a place far behind most students.<eos> It's because I am so troubled, ma'am.<eos> Vulnerable.<eos> I need a firm but pretty hand.<eos> Oh.<eos> Would you like Martin Prince to tutor you?

Interesting.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I have one question.<eos> Yes.<eos> When you're in the shower, do you shampoo your mustache?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's a must-stache, not an if-you-feel-like-it-stache.<eos> All right, have a good day.<eos> Dickory doo.<eos> I brought you some candy, Carol.
When you asked me to go skating, I really thought you knew how.<eos> Uh, I thought I could learn by watching YouTubes this morning.<eos> All right, Simpson, I'm here.<eos> Do what you do best-- your worst.<eos> Look, Seymour, I'm not gonna do a thing.<eos> Carol, he's all yours.<eos> Wow.<eos> The first war I've won.<eos> Uh, Carol, all that's left is for you to meet my mother, and, uh, up she skates now.<eos> My son, I just want to say, I wish the four of you the best.
Huh... So, she could also take down someone like you?<eos> ADA Elliot James. Took the fall after Reyes mishandled informants in the, uh, Teller case about a year ago.<eos> Nicole Kent got booted from your office after she failed to quiet the EnSynth scandal.<eos> Chris Davidson... did you ever meet him?<eos> Fired after the State Supreme Court disqualified your entire office from the Pell case due to "widespread misconduct."<eos> "Widespread."<eos> But not everyone got fired.<eos> See, Reyes walked out in one piece.<eos> She's good at throwing people to the wolves.<eos> So, sure, she can take down Nelson and Murdock this month, but how long before you are getting pulled into the shit with the rest of us?

Well, he slept with someone.<eos> So... probably mention that.<eos> -Cindi Babineaux.<eos> -Yeah, Cindi Babineaux.<eos> Five years ago at a mascot competition.<eos> Can I help who's next?<eos> -Remember that?<eos> -And I would take the...<eos> - Ladies?<eos> Ladies? Can I help you?
So, make sure you spell it or say it, "In your ear."<eos> Otherwise, you know, people think you're talking about something else.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> We're two days away from the competition, and I hope you're proud of yourselves because, literally, hundreds of mascots wanted to compete in this year's competition.<eos> And the judges and I went through all the applications and the audition tapes, and we even had to hire translators because there are some kind of weird languages out there.<eos> And believe me, it wasn't cheap.<eos> And we finally narrowed it down to 20 finalists.<eos> That's you people.<eos> Give yourselves a round of applause.<eos> I can see some of you out there sizing up the competition, looking at 'em and thinking, "That's my arch enemy."
It might just be hers.<eos> -I think it's this.<eos> -It could be. - Hi. What's your name?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Tommy. -Tommy, this has been a delight.<eos> -Oh, well, thank you so much.<eos> -You bet, darling.<eos> -Take care. God bless, sweetheart.<eos> AJ.<eos> You know, I could nudge some of my people towards you.

-They must be a little bit late.<eos> -I better call 'em.<eos> -Yeah. -Hi! What's your name?<eos> -Hi. Lindsay.<eos> Have you ever spent any time inside a mascot outfit?<eos> No, I never have.<eos> It's like, you know, walking around with a porta-potty.<eos> Porta-potties, I've been in.<eos> Many of them. Then you know what that smells like.<eos> Ooh. -Let me share with you what I do.
No, I never have.<eos> It's like, you know, walking around with a porta-potty.<eos> Porta-potties, I've been in.<eos> Many of them. Then you know what that smells like.<eos> Ooh. -Let me share with you what I do.<eos> -Oh, wow, please.<eos> Okay, I'm all ears.<eos> I'm an aromatic engineer.<eos> -Kind of an inventor.<eos> -Right. -So, I'm gonna show you...
Never comes out in the day...<eos> Maria. Took 'em to a ball game.<eos> And so, I found, as the game progressed, that... Well, they were watching the mascots more than they were watching the game.<eos> And I popped a lot of money for those tickets, so, you know, that got me interested in mascotting.<eos> And I go home, and I start researching a little bit, and it's fascinating because so many people think mascotting's been around for 200 years.<eos> Wrong.<eos> So wrong.<eos> I mean, you can go back to like 1500 BC.<eos> The Egyptians, you know, they only paint with everybody looking to the left.<eos> You ever noticed that?
You're a funny little guy.<eos> Thanks. You'd make a good mascot.<eos> -Actually, I am.<eos> I'm a mascot.<eos> -Oh! My name is Ron.<eos> I'm the Worm. Oh, you're the Worm!<eos> -I've heard talk about you.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I think I saw you.<eos> Oh, good. Hope you liked what you saw.
- Hello?<eos> Hello, Cindi.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Why are you calling?<eos> Why are you... you?<eos> Who is this?<eos> You've got the wrong number.<eos> Was I ever here?<eos> What happened?<eos> We're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time.
Oh, my.<eos> And of course, none of this would be possible without our main sponsor, Mr. Buddy Campbell.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> Campbell Tile and Carpet. You say it, we lay it.<eos> You know, as judges we had some very difficult decisions to make.<eos> And no winner was unanimous.<eos> Each one of us had to serve as a tiebreaker.<eos> So, I think that goes to show the high level of competition, and so, certainly, congratulations to all the finalists.<eos> And it is now my honor to introduce to you, Gabby Monkhouse.
-Bad baby.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> She has Munchausen syndrome.<eos> Help.<eos> Help!<eos> But, you know, and that's the kind of chemistry that we have now.<eos> -Yeah, it's fun.<eos> -And it's fun.<eos> Hello, Miss B.<eos> How are you?
Would you mind looking up a few urgent things for us?<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Yes. First question.<eos> Is Beyoncé really getting divorced?<eos> Because we read a real suspicious-sounding article in US Weekly, and--<eos> Mr. Healy!<eos> - Hello?<eos> Are you still--<eos> - Uh... how may I, uh, assist you this fine afternoon?
- Uh... how may I, uh, assist you this fine afternoon?<eos> I wanna see Caputo.<eos> Well, his next availability, mmm-hmm, one second... is, mmm, in two weeks.<eos> You're kiddin' me, right?<eos> You know, Mr. Healy, back in the day, it was real good... when we had plenty of time to see you, but now, I... I don't know.<eos> --Really, huh?<eos> How about, uh... two boxes of Good and Plenty?<eos> -Five.<eos> -Three.<eos> Mr. Healy's here to see you.
I left your car in the driveway.<eos> Sorry to bother you. Is everything okay here?<eos> Is there something you want?<eos> Uh... just want to tell you I'm here.<eos> Right across the way.<eos> Mind if I come in?<eos> Just for a minute.<eos> Uh, we can talk.<eos> I don't wanna talk.<eos> Look, appreciate you letting me borrow your car, but don't give you the right to come sniffing around here.
Gotta stay strong for Betsy.<eos> You wanna take a look?<eos> I mean, it's pretty wicked.<eos> I'm gonna take your word for it.<eos> Uh, George Buck?<eos> Hi, the hospital told me I might find you here.<eos> Hi, uh... are you one of them?<eos> Sorry, one of who?<eos> Please, just leave me alone.<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to you.

Oh, and, Princess... have fun.<eos> Oh, you came.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Please, have a seat.<eos> I need a favor. Okay.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Wait.<eos> I need your weapon.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> I need to speak with you. In confidence.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.<eos> Can I be of any assistance?<eos> I plan to assemble this cot for my son.<eos> So bring me any tools I may require and keep my bourbon decanter full.<eos> Of course, Your Majesty. I'm at your service.<eos> Is there a problem, sir?<eos> Whatever it is you're doing, it stops now.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Accessing the surveillance database.<eos> I was gonna come to you, sir, when I had something, eventually.
Your work, however, is to keep the Prince safe.<eos> What you're doing is not only distracting, it's dangerous.<eos> More dangerous without my weapon.<eos> Oh, for the love of God, will you stop it with the English accent?<eos> Look, son, there are decisions made here every day without you.<eos> High-level, covert conversations.<eos> If there is something I should know...<eos> There's nothing you should know beyond this.<eos> I went out on a limb for you, Mr. Frost.<eos> I gave you a second chance. And a first.
Will you at least consider it?<eos> Good.<eos> And, please, reach out if you have any questions at all.<eos> Or if you simply want to get a drink.<eos> Lord knows, I need one some days.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> I can see myself out.<eos> Oh, and, Liam, this position, it would be in New York.<eos> - In case that mattered. - Good to know.<eos> I have some things to say to you and I thought it best I say them directly and in person.

I can't forgive you for betraying me, Lucius.
I can't and I won't.<eos> Then, with all due respect, Your Majesty... ..I killed the King of England. And I will remain in prison till my dying day.<eos> We're going to absolve you of all charges.<eos> You will not!<eos> All the work we put into this, all the sacrifices we made... you made... ..the monarchy cannot overcome another scandal.<eos> We both know it.<eos> One more global disgrace and the people will vote to abolish. If they don't storm the gates and burn the place down, instead.<eos> Lucius, you're in prison for a crime you didn't commit.<eos> How could you want to protect this?<eos> Why would you care?
- I did no such thing.<eos> - So you could be Queen.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Admit you did it.<eos> - I did it.'<eos> I've been chasing this moment for so many years.<eos> It must be nice to have reached the end.<eos> But it's only the beginning, Mr. Pryce.<eos> We have work to do. So much work to do.<eos> Liam trusts you.
But it's only the beginning, Mr. Pryce.<eos> We have work to do. So much work to do.<eos> Liam trusts you.<eos> And you're about to destroy his entire world.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> That's what my dad wants.<eos> I just see people who have nothing to do with this about to be ruined.<eos> Maybe in time you'll understand.<eos> - I already understand.<eos> - He trusts you, too.
Previously on The Royals...<eos> Does this mean anything to you?
It just keeps getting worse, doesn't it?<eos> Pretty flowers.<eos> Like the ones on my grave thanks to you getting me killed.<eos> But then, people kill people all the time around here.<eos> Don't they, baby?<eos> It's open.<eos> Ted, I didn't know you cared.<eos> I found these outside your door, Your Highness.<eos> I think the staff didn't want to disturb you.<eos> I wanted to speak with you in confidence about that symbol on your necklace. Okay...
Not today, I'm not.<eos> We've located her vehicle.<eos> It was abandoned in a very secluded area off the M25.<eos> There are signs of foul play.<eos> She's dead? She's missing, but all indications are...<eos> Then there's hope.<eos> She could be alive. Your Majesty, there was blood in the vehicle and no sign of Violet.<eos> No hospitals have reported treating or admitting anyone with her name or matching her description.<eos> In my professional opinion, we're looking for a body, not a missing person.<eos> Most of the personal effects in the vehicle are evidence. But I thought this might matter to you.
It's a long story.<eos> For all we know, Grandma did it.<eos> Deal with your homicidal mother.<eos> I need to try to fix a 30-year tragedy.<eos> And, Mum, if anything comes up about Dominique... we won't lie about it.<eos> Good.<eos> Don't.<eos> It was driving me crazy like that.<eos> As you wish.<eos> I just wanted to check on you.
I'll be right outside.<eos> Open this door!<eos> Jasper, open the door and let me out!<eos> He trusted him!<eos> We all trusted him and he slaughtered him!<eos> Open the door! Open it!<eos> Princess?<eos> Where's Imogen?<eos> She said she had to go.<eos> Uh, she also said thank you.
We'll make this right, Len.<eos> And then what?<eos> Once all this is over? Who's going to be left, Liam?<eos> We will.<eos> You and me.<eos> - They don't get rid of us.<eos> - We get rid of them.<eos> - The King's Cup.<eos> - A football match?<eos> The first annual football match dedicated to the late, thanks to you, King Simon Henstridge.
You can't hide from it.<eos> You can't erase it.<eos> And you can't take it back.<eos> Use mine.<eos> Tell them there was a struggle.<eos> Call it an act of self-defense.<eos> It's just a lie.<eos> We all live with them.<eos> You asked me why I did the things I've done.<eos> I'll tell you.
It just consumes you. It just burns you up.<eos> A video is going to play during your father's dedication that documents Dominique Stewart's death and the many other sins of your house.<eos> So from where I'm sitting, you have two choices and they're both fairly grim.<eos> You either pull the trigger and be judged for it, or you step outside this vehicle and face the world as that video plays.<eos> There's a third option.<eos> You're not the only one with a video.<eos> Interesting.<eos> But if you fail...<eos> You should be more concerned with the alternative.<eos> What becomes of you if I don't?
- Very helpful, thank you.<eos> And now, a dedication to King Simon from his son,<eos> His Royal Highness, Prince Liam Henstridge.<eos> Time's up, son.<eos> Don't call me son.<eos> We're in.<eos> We push this button and the world will know Ted did it.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I can do it.<eos> What you see of our family is pretty much what we allow you to see.
Come back tomorrow. We're all out. ...and we have to pull together, both sides of the aisle...<eos> We're all out for today.<eos> Sorry, come back tomorrow.<eos> - We're all out, guys.<eos> We're all out.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> Come back tomorrow.<eos> We're all out for today, sir.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> Hey... can I siphon a couple of gallons from you?
How serious is it?<eos> He needs a liver transplant.<eos> I wasn't aware that...<eos> You better get used to negotiating with me.<eos> If the president dies, it's you and I... or nothing at all.<eos> My apologies, Mr. President.<eos> I didn't intend to insult you.<eos> Let's keep a dialogue open.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'd like the opportunity to present you with a detailed proposal countering the Chinese demands.
Nothing.<eos> I know that must sound awful.<eos> It's a lot to process.<eos> There's no right way or wrong way.<eos> - Wait, hold on. - No.<eos> ...Marjory wouldn't approve.<eos> - We got sidetracked.<eos> - Yes. China.<eos> I have an idea, if you can trust me to handle it.<eos> I'd trust you with my goddamn life, Claire.
- None that he knows of.<eos> But it's not like we can ask around.<eos> In November of 2013, Ms. Barnes was struck by a D.C. Metrorail train.<eos> D.C. police classified it as an accident.<eos> Some have speculated that...<eos> Have a seat, Remy.<eos> Sorry about Frank.<eos> Please, don't bother.<eos> I've had enough people say they're sorry, and I know you don't mean it.<eos> I can't help you the way you want me to.

LeAnn told me she was very clear with you.<eos> It won't work. Tusk wants to help you even less than I do.<eos> Well, nobody's doing any favors here, Remy.<eos> He's going to get very rich from this.<eos> - Why don't you speak to him yourself?<eos> - Because he won't listen to me.<eos> This needs to seem like your idea, not mine.<eos> - And you'll make a killing, too.<eos> - I don't need the money.<eos> Because you care about other things now.
The First Lady put a bug in his ear.<eos> Well, whatever bug she put in there won't crawl out.<eos> I'll set up a meeting.<eos> Just you, me and him.<eos> I don't think a meeting is enough.<eos> We have a vice president that does not know what he is doing, Doug.<eos> He needs to completely turn over all diplomatic affairs to the State Department. - Otherwise, my hands are tied.<eos> - Not now.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> When we're finished, I will come and find you.
Hey, Kate.<eos> I tried calling.<eos> Home and cell.<eos> Pulled out the cord. Turned off the cell.<eos> Because of people like me.<eos> The others had the courtesy not to show up on my doorstep.<eos> - Courtesy never got me anywhere.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Off the record.<eos> - If it were anyone but you...
Chinese disowned me.<eos> They'll come around.<eos> Who put you up to this?<eos> - Starting my own firm.<eos> - I thought you were out?<eos> I was fooling myself.<eos> So, president gets shot, and you just can't help taking advantage of the chaos.<eos> What you call chaos, I call opportunity.<eos> And you're my first client.<eos> I wish you the best.
You lost a lot of money during the Walker scandal.<eos> I did, indeed, which is why I'm turning you down.<eos> I'm sorry you came all the way out here for a "no."<eos> You don't wanna go to prison, do you?<eos> Lose the rest of it?<eos> I've already been pardoned.<eos> For the money laundering, not for perjury.<eos> You said that Walker knew, and he didn't.<eos> What you didn't say is that you were working with Frank.<eos> Why should anybody believe you more than me?
We've invited Russia and China to attend, but we didn't wanna move forward until we had congressional approval. - Bob?<eos> - We should discuss privately.<eos> You're going to Brandenburg yourself?<eos> If his health continues to worsen--<eos> We'll assess as we get closer, but, no, I'll stay here if it looks dire.<eos> We should probably draft an appropriation in case we need to pay for a state funeral.<eos> - Doug.<eos> - Madam Secretary.<eos> I could've come to the White House.<eos> The organ network, it answers to you. Yes and no.
- Doug.<eos> - Madam Secretary.<eos> I could've come to the White House.<eos> The organ network, it answers to you. Yes and no.<eos> Uh, in a regulatory capacity--<eos> You have the power to modify the recipient list.<eos> That's up to the network.<eos> They have an expert committee that--<eos> The president's life isn't going to be decided by a committee.<eos> Let me show you something.
No, I use Google.<eos> Uh, it's a small market share, but still, it's billions of searches a month.<eos> Now, what if a certain candidate got more hits, was ranked higher, more positive coverage favored over negative coverage?<eos> What if that candidate was William Conway?<eos> Manipulating searches?<eos> The public would turn on them.<eos> - It gets them millions of votes.<eos> - Can you get me solid proof?<eos> Well, I am not getting involved in something like this.<eos> What I will give you is advice as a friend.
China cannot be at the center of this negotiation, or Raymond Tusk.<eos> Involving the oil companies is the only shot we have at winning Republican support.<eos> Do you remember when we played beer pong and you let me win?<eos> The two of us were sitting right over there, in those two chairs, and you asked me for my advice.<eos> It was good advice.<eos> And you listened to it.<eos> I don't know why you won't now.<eos> You were proposing a way forward.<eos> This time you're not.<eos> Well, unlike you, my nomination was confirmed by the Senate, because they believed I knew what I was doing.
I agree.<eos> So I'll tell the truth.<eos> I'll own it.<eos> Yes, that you didn't meet with him.<eos> Are you suggesting that--<eos> It's the attorney general's word against Heather's.<eos> As your lawyer, I can't be part of this conversation.<eos> We can still win this campaign.<eos> I'll be in the lobby.<eos> I'll back you up.
Well, I know this plan better than anyone.<eos> - Mr. President--<eos> - There is only one shot at this.<eos> - Everyone at the same table.<eos> - What about Frank?<eos> In Brandenburg, I can be useful.<eos> I can't here.<eos> The First Lady cannot negotiate on behalf of the United States government.<eos> The delegation is at your discretion, Mr. President.<eos> It might be good for you to have some support.
Would you give us a moment, please, Cathy?<eos> Just a little while.<eos> I'll be outside.<eos> So... how is surgery going?<eos> So far, so good.<eos> Ah, you must be exhausted.<eos> Now, sit. Sit.<eos> I imagine you'd rather be at the hospital.<eos> Well, this is too important, and you weren't going to negotiate with Secretary Durant.<eos> What makes you think I'll negotiate with you?
The terms, yes.<eos> But why are you here... and not with Francis?<eos> When your mother is sick, you go to her.<eos> Not your husband, hmm?<eos> Were the stories true?<eos> Are there problems, Claire?<eos> What are your concerns with the Chinese?<eos> There are too many drilling sites in sensitive areas.<eos> It's a security issue to us.<eos> And what sites, in particular, are you worried about?
Were the stories true?<eos> Are there problems, Claire?<eos> What are your concerns with the Chinese?<eos> There are too many drilling sites in sensitive areas.<eos> It's a security issue to us.<eos> And what sites, in particular, are you worried about?<eos> Oh, you... you are familiar with the individual zones?<eos> It's my plan.<eos> I know it backwards and forwards.<eos> I see, so that's why it's so important to you.
Germany?<eos> A lot to catch you up on, Mr. President.<eos> - Raymond.<eos> - The Chinese are getting skittish.<eos> They wanna know why it's taking so long.<eos> Now, if Petrov doesn't agree soon, they may back out.<eos> - Thank you, Raymond.<eos> - I'm on standby.<eos> We need to shake hands on this. No.<eos> No, I told you, nothing on Sakhalin Island.
You fly in, you puff up your chest and you pretend to play president.<eos> But what would you be without your husband?<eos> Nothing.<eos> A pretty face.<eos> So, yes, play the president if you like.<eos> Go. Tell the Chinese they get nothing on the Pacific.<eos> You think you can do that, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> Your people are hurting.<eos> Six months at most, they're gonna be marching on Red Square.<eos> I'm done letting you have your dignity.
There's multiple reports that she and Petrov had a long meeting.<eos> They greeted each other.<eos> That's it.<eos> So we deny?<eos> The president hasn't approved the plan yet.<eos> We wanna focus on his recovery, not the--<eos> - Yes? - Secretary of Health for you, sir.<eos> I'll find you in your office.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> - I just sent you an email.
It's only by the grace of the good Lord that I'm not pushing up daisies myself.<eos> And I am done with pushing my luck.<eos> But you're the... sheriff.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> By the way, you might find a warrant or two out for me around these parts.<eos> You know, we have stuff back on the ship that can fix your... you know...<eos> Fix what?<eos> Yep. Nothing.<eos> Never mind.<eos> What can I get you?
Just spare me the lecture, Captain Hunter.<eos> You, of all people...<eos> This isn't about the mission, Martin!<eos> Do you not recall happened when Dr. Palmer left a bit of his suit back in 1975 and nearly destroyed Central City?<eos> That was an accident.<eos> I'm not talking about our mission or Dr. Palmer's technological gaffe.<eos> Calvert... that town clearly holds some emotional resonance for you, judging from the looks you've been exchanging with Mr. Hex.<eos> How do you know it's a town?<eos> Gideon?<eos> Calvert, Oklahoma... what happened to you there, Rip?

Yes.<eos> How?<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Oh, it's... it's not a miracle, I can assure you.<eos> Uh, M-Mrs. Neal...<eos> Sarah. when the illness is gone,<eos> Do you understand? Yes.<eos> Yes, I shall do it.<eos> Sarah...<eos> I wish you well.
Okay.<eos> You desperately want to belong somewhere... with someone, which is the real reason why you sneak into fancy faculty parties.<eos> Not because you're sick of your ramen and video games routine.<eos> And now, your mind is racing. You're wondering what you can possibly say or do to keep me on the line, because the last thing you want is to spend the rest of the evening with that scotch and that shaggy-haired friend of yours.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You're pretty.<eos> You even work the blind thing.<eos> But you're dumb.<eos> You lost before you even stepped to the plate.<eos> You get all of that from a pair of old wingtips?
There's an actual list?<eos> - Mr. Nelson, I...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Believe me, the sooner this Punisher mess is off our plate, the better.<eos> So... show me a subpoena, and...<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Are you really going to make me jump through hoops for this?<eos> Trust me, there's nothing I'd rather do more than cooperate with your office. But a legal firm sharing privileged communications with a client, I mean, even a deceased one, without a court order?<eos> I've seen lawyers get disbarred for less.<eos> And I don't know about you, but I worked really hard for my law degree.
- I was a friend of...<eos> - Ben.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> Look, I think that I owe you an apology.<eos> - At the funeral, I thought that you...<eos> Look, Ben...<eos> Ben was a real pain in my ass.<eos> So it follows that his friends would be, too.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, I don't think you're gonna like my answer.
Applauded for putting all the thieves and muggers and rapists in the morgue, where they belong.<eos> Let those bastards feel scared walking down the street for a change.<eos> It's Son of Sam all over again.<eos> It's Bernie Goetz...<eos> It's like the only thing protecting us is Frank.<eos> I just moved my family to New York, and now we're moving out.<eos> If anyone can kill anyone in this town...<eos> where does the insanity end?<eos> Counselors, over 400 potential jurors have come through this courtroom.<eos> So I should tell you, if you can't agree to move forward with the 12 men and women selected, I will make this trial a living hell for all of you.
I mean, there's no way Matt misses this, right?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...<eos> Frank Castle brutally tortured and murdered 30 people.<eos> Thirty that we know of.<eos> He took the law into his own hands.<eos> Acted as judge, jury, and... most violent executioner.<eos> And you will hear that the defendant's victims were criminals... but the victims are not on trial here today, and justice does not belong in the hands of a man like Frank Castle.<eos> This isn't the Wild West.<eos> Justice is served here... in a court of law.<eos> And it is up to each of you to take back the city from lawless vigilantes... like Frank Castle.
Okay, so... you're 19... standing in hot sand... sun burning down... noise... yelling, gunfire...<eos> The only thing that you know for sure is that you're surrounded by an enemy that wants you dead.<eos> But you do it.<eos> You endure it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you have orders.<eos> And you have a duty.<eos> And also because your life doesn't end here.<eos> You have people you love waiting at home.<eos> Because... aside from being a decorated marine... the man before you is a good husband and an excellent father.
Everything's been removed from inside the room.<eos> He's tied down, but keep your distance and mind the tape.<eos> Do not step past it or I get to make my dream come true and arrest you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Matt, the tape.<eos> My name is Matthew Murdock.<eos> These are my associates, Franklin Nelson and Karen Page.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You protect shitbags.<eos> We came here today to make you an offer.
But you take a quick look around, you'll notice we're the only ones who are.<eos> As you may well know, your list of enemies extends well beyond the gangs you've killed.<eos> You're very good at making powerful enemies.<eos> And the day you were admitted to Metro-General for the round you took to the head, a do-not-resuscitate order was placed on you.<eos> And a shoot-to-kill order, just a few days ago.<eos> We know, because we heard it given.<eos> These orders were issued by the District Attorney.<eos> And the fact that she's had it in for us ever since we started asking questions tells us we're on the right track.<eos> Someone in the DA's office wants you dead, Mr. Castle... and we'd like to know why.<eos> You let us take your case, we can soften your sentence, and give you a shot.
- It's in some kind of code.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> If invoices for drugs and guns and human trafficking aren't encrypted, then what is?<eos> Wow, what are they hiding?<eos> Same time tomorrow, Matthew?<eos> We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars, and decades of planning on this operation.<eos> And now... our most valuable secrets have been stolen.<eos> I'd be very disappointed to learn you aided this theft in any way, Gibson-san.<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> We entrusted you with access.
All right, watch your head.<eos> Inmate 5-5-4-6-7. Fisk, Wilson.<eos> Everything off.<eos> Clothing and personal items in the bin.<eos> Newbies wear white.<eos> That's yours.<eos> I deeply regret that it's come to this, Mr. Fisk.<eos> I assure you my firm did everything we could... but the case against you was, quite simply, bulletproof.
We're making progress, but I have to be honest.<eos> Given the magnitude of charges, we were lucky we could plead you out at all.<eos> Vanessa, huh?<eos> I've secured a percentage of your holdings offshore, as requested.<eos> - She wants to come see you.<eos> - She can't.<eos> She must stay where she's safe for the time being.<eos> Of course.<eos> She'll have everything she needs.<eos> But with that said, you need to understand that a good number of your assets were seized by the government, Mr. Fisk.
It's the best move, Mr. Fisk.<eos> In fact, it's the only move.<eos> Those you cannot teach to fly, teach to fall faster.<eos> The boogeyman of crime.<eos> The man who cast a shadow in the dark.<eos> You'll stop reading those eventually.<eos> It's best to accept that real life is what happens on the inside.<eos> Maybe your life, Mr. Dutton, not mine.<eos> We never met before, have we?<eos> No, but your reputation precedes you.

- Yeah, something like that.<eos> That right?<eos> Well, I don't help shitbag, has-been mob bosses.<eos> - "Has-been"?<eos> - You heard what I said.<eos> I'm simply proposing an arrangement.<eos> I don't do arrangements.<eos> You should rethink that... considering the amount of enemies you have in here.<eos> I'm not gonna be your goddamn trigger man.<eos> - I'm offering you the opportunity to confront the man implicated in the deaths of your family.

It's already been done.<eos> - What's been done?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> I'll protect you.<eos> They have my son.<eos> They took Daniel!<eos> I don't know what they're doing to him.<eos> These bodyguards weren't protecting me.<eos> They were holding me hostage.<eos> If I tell you anything... they will kill my son.
The Farm.<eos> - Stay here.<eos> - I'm coming with you.<eos> He's my son.<eos> You wanna be alive to see him?<eos> Stay here.<eos> Doctor?<eos> Doctor, my name's Karen Page, I...<eos> Sir, I know your testimony in the case against Frank Castle hurt your career.<eos> I think I can help you.
- I'm not with them now.<eos> - We're with the New York Bulletin.<eos> After what happened at the courthouse, the mayor asked me to step down.<eos> I know I sound paranoid, but... there have been people following me.<eos> You're a target because of what you know.<eos> 'Cause whatever that is, they... they want to keep in the dark.<eos> Karen has found something that will bring the truth to light.<eos> Here, uh...<eos> This... is this the body they asked you to make disappear?<eos> - I shouldn't be talking to you.
You want me on the outside so I step on every piece of shit I see.<eos> That way, nobody gets strong, and we...<eos> The city's yours for the taking.<eos> Something like that. Yeah.<eos> So if you can do that, if you can get me out, why not just do it yourself?<eos> Because I play the long game, Mr. Castle.<eos> You see, when I'm finally let out of this cage... it won't be to wage war.<eos> It will be to win one.<eos> You, sir... you need to focus on now.<eos> I've given you a chance to walk free.
You... You are running this place.<eos> Yeah, you did set him free.<eos> You ask such small questions, Mr. Murdock.<eos> I know you're regaining power in here.<eos> Yes, ask my lawyer. He'll deny it.<eos> Ask the guards!<eos> They'll deny it.<eos> Ask the inmates here.<eos> They'll cut their tongues out before they talk.<eos> But I have something to say to you.
Good.<eos> Daniel.<eos> Your father's here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's weak, and he'll need another transfusion, but he's coherent.<eos> Hopefully the others will respond the same way.<eos> I don't know how to repay you.<eos> Trust me, billing will find you.<eos> I'll give you two a minute to catch up, but then the police will be wanting to question him sooner than later.
Look, look, Karen, Karen... I understand that this whole journalism thing is new to you, but a real journalist doesn't just up and quit.<eos> - Well, that's not fair.<eos> - That's exactly fair!<eos> Stories don't disappear, they... they change.<eos> They become different stories.<eos> Change?<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> I need to go home.<eos> I need... I need a shower. I need to eat, I need to sleep.<eos> Why do you care so much about Frank Castle?
- That's exactly fair!<eos> Stories don't disappear, they... they change.<eos> They become different stories.<eos> Change?<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> I need to go home.<eos> I need... I need a shower. I need to eat, I need to sleep.<eos> Why do you care so much about Frank Castle?<eos> Hmm? I mean, maybe once upon a time this was about whether or not he was innocent or some sort of, you know, psycho murderer, but that ship sailed a long time ago, along with your career at Nelson and Murdock.<eos> So... So why do you still care?
I'm...<eos> Like you said, it's been a long night.<eos> We'll nail him.<eos> Until then, I'm just glad you agreed to accept police protection.<eos> I appreciate the offer.<eos> All right, the car's outside.<eos> Powell and Reed will escort you to a safe location.<eos> We'll keep someone posted outside, 24/7.<eos> Right.<eos> If you remember anything, anything... you know where to find me.
And you, not a word to anyone, understand?<eos> You don't think that this looks just a little bit strange?<eos> At least bring in the coroner, have them check and see...<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> I'm not jeopardizing this hospital's financial future over a nurse's wild-eyed...<eos> Wait, all of a sudden, this is about money?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> This hospital was attacked. People are dead...<eos> Enough.<eos> I've heard all I'm going to from you, Temple.
My kid's at basketball, asshole.<eos> Yang, you better get up here.<eos> Come here!<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Screw you.<eos> The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Madame Gao.<eos> I see from the uniform you've taken the Devil's name to heart.<eos> Yeah, I had to...<eos> 'cause of people like you.
Just stay away from me.<eos> 911, what is your emergency?<eos> Hello, yes, please.<eos> Connect me to the 15th Precinct, please.<eos> Trust me, my men won't disturb us.<eos> Yeah, I don't take much on faith these days.<eos> You know, word was you left Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I'm surprised you came back.<eos> What made you think I ever left?<eos> The multiple charges pending against you, drug dealing, money laundering.

I suppose after all this time, I expected more from you.<eos> Like what?<eos> An understanding of the real threat facing this city.<eos> Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm looking at one.<eos> However, tonight I'm only after information.<eos> Perhaps you should ask your police.<eos> I don't want you.<eos> I want your competition.<eos> A heroin dealer with the street name Blacksmith.<eos> And you think I can help you?
Close us out, Josie.<eos> Karen Page, what the hell are you still doing here?<eos> It's Christmas Eve.<eos> Shouldn't you be home celebrating with all that family that you... can't stand, like everybody else?<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry. I must be projecting.<eos> I, uh... can't seem to stop staring at a blank screen.<eos> - Writer's block.<eos> - Mmm. There's a cure.<eos> - Scotch.<eos> - That helps you write?
Tell them something they don't know.<eos> Hell, I'd read the shit out of that.<eos> Happy Hanukkah.<eos> - Scotch.<eos> - Mmm, you know, just... just in case.<eos> I'll expect 2,000 words in my inbox before Santa shows up.<eos> You got it, boss.<eos> "What is it, to be a hero?<eos> Look in the mirror and you'll know."<eos> "Look into your own eyes and tell me you are not heroic, that you have not endured, or suffered... or lost the things you care about most.
I didn't even wanna take this case.<eos> - It'll be okay, I...<eos> - The whole city is watching.<eos> If I screw up, I'd never work again.<eos> And, frankly, you'd probably never work again, either, by association, which...<eos> Stop, Foggy.<eos> Stop thinking about screwing up, about losing.<eos> You need to think about winning.<eos> Colonel Ray Schoonover, United States Marine Corps.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
And the crimes he's accused of today?<eos> Could the man you knew have committed them?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Lieutenant Frank Castle that I know is a hero.<eos> A man who deserves our respect... and our gratitude.<eos> Not the same man.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> No more questions, Your Honor.<eos> People?<eos> I'd like to personally thank you for your service to this country, Colonel.
People?<eos> I'd like to personally thank you for your service to this country, Colonel.<eos> My father served in Vietnam.<eos> - Do you know what he told me about medals?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> He said the only people who truly know what happened are the ones that were there.<eos> You told a nice story, Colonel... but how can we know that it happened the way you described?<eos> Well, perhaps I wasn't clear.<eos> I was there, ma'am.<eos> That officer that didn't listen to Frank, got his men trapped... you're looking at him.
It can plunge a seemingly peaceful individual into... mental and emotional chaos.<eos> It sure sounds a lot like PTSD.<eos> No, that's not where we're going.<eos> Just... listen.<eos> Could you define it for the jury, please?<eos> Extreme emotional disturbance.<eos> It's twofold.<eos> First, the defendant is so emotionally disturbed that he loses control.<eos> And second, the defendant has a reasonable explanation for said disturbance, from his point of view.<eos> Are you aware that Frank Castle's wife, son, and daughter were all murdered right in front of him when he sustained the brain injury in question?
I did that.<eos> - Yeah, you did. - Uh-huh.<eos> Look, Frank, I can't judge you.<eos> That was tough in there for you, right? It was...<eos> It was, um, hard?<eos> You gotta do something for me.<eos> I need you to take the stand.<eos> Come on, for what?<eos> Why would I...<eos> The jury has to know what happened to you, what you go through every single day.
I need you to take the stand.<eos> Come on, for what?<eos> Why would I...<eos> The jury has to know what happened to you, what you go through every single day.<eos> After this afternoon... I don't think we have any other shot.<eos> What?<eos> And what do you think is gonna happen here?<eos> We're not gonna win this thing.<eos> No, but we can still reduce the charges.<eos> Look, that might not be important to you, but it is important to me.
Uh, Your Honor, the Defense would like to call Frank Castle to the stand.<eos> Bailiff, bring in the defendant, please.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> Frank's wearing a suit.<eos> He looks better than I ever have, and he's not even wearing a tie.<eos> Order.<eos> Think about what you want, Frank.<eos> - Something's not right.<eos> - No turning back now.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
What happened that day?<eos> The day your family was so tragically killed.<eos> - I understand, it's difficult.<eos> - Do you?<eos> Do you understand?<eos> 'Cause I don't think you understand shit.<eos> I'd like permission to treat the witness as hostile, Your Honor?<eos> Granted.<eos> All right, Frank.<eos> You don't want to tell us? I'll tell you.

I'll tell you.<eos> I'm gonna tell you exactly what kind of man you are.
Oh, no problem.<eos> I just love hiking through the woods in the middle of World War III.<eos> What if, instead of encountering these resistance fighters, we meet up with more of Savage's forces?<eos> Why else do you think I brought along Firestorm and The Atom?<eos> Give me one good reason why we shouldn't blow you straight to hell.<eos> Better yet, give her several good reasons.<eos> My wife and son live in Whitechapel.<eos> - It was hit hard.<eos> - I know.<eos> The same fate will befall you if you don't accept our help.
Our propulsion engine was severely damaged in the crash and is no longer functioning.<eos> So where does that leave us?<eos> All right, our only option is to take the Jumpship and try and outrun it.<eos> The Jumpship seats seven.<eos> The cargo bay's filled with refugees.<eos> I'm well aware.<eos> Well, we can't just leave them there; we...<eos> Martin!<eos> Professor, you are gonna be just fine.<eos> I promise you.
They're safe.<eos> Every one of them is alive and well.<eos> But for how long?<eos> Apparently, time wants to happen.<eos> Oh, I think you'll find that time... for once... is on our side.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to pay a visit to an old friend.<eos> Well, you seem quite happy for a man behind bars.<eos> Why shouldn't I be happy?<eos> It seems that you once again have failed to kill me.<eos> A momentary setback, I assure you.
I checked with Gideon.<eos> Bringing Savage onboard didn't change the timeline, and your family still dies.<eos> The timeline is always in flux.<eos> Once we get to the Vanishing Point, all will be well.<eos> Is that why you're pushing the ship beyond its limits?<eos> This has been my ship for the last 13 years.<eos> No one knows its limits better than I do.<eos> Not even Gideon.<eos> The Waverider will hold together.<eos> I promise you.
Dr. Palmer.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?<eos> You're gonna tell me how to free Carter's mind.<eos> Oh, well, all you had to do was ask.<eos> Are you sure you want me to?<eos> Of course I'm sure.<eos> Because the moment I release him, you will lose her forever.<eos> You don't know Kendra.<eos> I know Chay-Ara.<eos> And I know the man who stands between you and your love has stood between me and mine for millennia.
And we're worried it's just the beginning.<eos> - The beginning of what?<eos> - It's like I said, Rip.<eos> As long as Savage is alive and on this ship, he is dangerous.<eos> The Time Drive is rebooting.<eos> We will soon be on our way.<eos> I'm asking for a little faith, gentlemen.<eos> Sorry, fresh out.<eos> I take it you and Mr. Snart are of the same mind? Yes.<eos> And what of you, Miss Lance?

Yes.<eos> And what of you, Miss Lance?<eos> You're the one who said you'd sell us out for your family.<eos> Well, if that's how you all feel, none of you is obliged to continue on this voyage with me.
I'm saying that this mission has always been a voluntary enterprise.<eos> And the mission was to kill Savage.<eos> Which doesn't seem to be on the table anymore.<eos> Very well.<eos> Leave, if that's what you...<eos> It's been a blast, Rip.<eos> Good luck getting to the Vanishing Point.<eos> Tell your pals Chronos says,<eos> "Kiss my ass."<eos> What about you, Sara?
That night, you and your acolytes...<eos> Were celebrating the acquisition of your friend Carter Hall's body.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's my understanding this ritual involved you sharing your immortality with your followers.<eos> And you wish for me to do the same for someone else.<eos> Someone dear to you.<eos> Your nuclear counterpart, perhaps?<eos> Yes.<eos> And as impertinent as this may sound, I need your help.<eos> Well, clearly, your friends didn't give you the full account of the ritual.
- What'd you do, Poindexter? - What do you mean?<eos> The Jumpship.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Well, it's really more a question of when.<eos> But, oh, yes.<eos> You both wanted to return to 2016.<eos> Got it in one.<eos> I did what I had to do to save Jefferson's life.<eos> Now we must do whatever's necessary to repair the Waverider and deliver Savage to the Vanishing Point.<eos> Oh, back so soon with the stench of defeat written all over you.
Is that it?<eos> Got your little game figured out.<eos> For all your intelligence, you still didn't manage to make Chay-Ara yours.<eos> I wouldn't expect a psychopath like you to understand.<eos> Kendra is free to do what she wants.<eos> You know what I see when I look at you?<eos> I see weakness masquerading as goodness.<eos> I'm not the one trapped in a cage.<eos> Well, if it weren't for this cage, you wouldn't have that arrogant look on your face.<eos> You think I'm afraid of you? No.
You made five grand last summer babysitting.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> - No, I don't do babies. - You do now.<eos> Think of it as a thank you for saving your life.<eos> You better not drop my future criminal partner.<eos> Otherwise you're in trouble, comprende?<eos> We've got Mr. Snart's younger self.<eos> Next stop is you, Professor, and you, Mr. Jackson.<eos> How strange to imagine, holding one's infant self.<eos> Actually, none of you should participate in your own abductions.
Off you go. So, this is where Rip plans on keeping our baby selves.<eos> If all goes according to plan, we'll only be here for a few minutes, then presumably never remember.<eos> When's the last thing anything went according to plan?<eos> I don't think there was a last time.<eos> I really would sit up if I were you.<eos> She'll kill you if she catches you slouching.<eos> Don't be fooled by appearances. That woman is as tough as nails.<eos> Funny how you never mentioned having a mother.<eos> Adoptive mother.<eos> Now, can I interest any of you in some more tea? Thank you.
My true loyalty is to my children.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Time Masters fill their ranks with children, orphans pulled from throughout the course of history.<eos> When Michael arrived at the Refuge, he had nothing but the clothes on his back.<eos> There's a reason it's called the Refuge, and a reason that it exists in a secret location in history.<eos> The Time Masters will never think to look for you here.<eos> Thank you for your assistance.<eos> Look, I know I make a gorgeous baby, but I should warn you.<eos> You've got your hands full with me.<eos> I assure you, you're not the first tough case to arrive at my door.
Look, I'm gonna make this easy.<eos> I already have.<eos> The lives of your team's nearest and dearest for their younger selves.<eos> And I'm gonna counter that demand with an offer of my own.<eos> I will surrender myself if you spare the lives of my crew and their loved ones.<eos> A noble gesture.<eos> But worthless.<eos> My directive is to eliminate your entire team, not just you.<eos> Yes, well, I'm not talking about me now.<eos> I'm offering you me in the past.
But worthless.<eos> My directive is to eliminate your entire team, not just you.<eos> Yes, well, I'm not talking about me now.<eos> I'm offering you me in the past.<eos> Rip Hunter before he became a Time Master.<eos> Eliminate him, and this team will never have been.<eos> If this is some kind of trick...<eos> It's no trick.<eos> Enough people have died at my expense.<eos> Gideon will send you the location.
Proud of you, honey.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> My wife doesn't seem to remember me.<eos> Because until we return your younger selves to the timeline, you... none of you will have ever existed.<eos> But we will return you.<eos> When we left 2016, I just assumed I would return to the exact moment I left, that Clarissa wouldn't even know I was gone.<eos> So I didn't say good-bye.<eos> And now I fear I will never have that chance.<eos> You will.<eos> Look, I've told you before that I am not going to risk your marriage in order to save my wife.
This is what will happen to Earth if Savage is not there to lead it.<eos> Without him, all human life is extinguished.<eos> Even this realm falls to the Thanagarians.<eos> Are you impressed now?<eos> No.<eos> You are as mad as your friend Vandal if you think that he is the world's only hope.<eos> We've examined the timeline.<eos> There is no other hope.<eos> I don't expect you to take my word for it.<eos> That's why there's something else I have to show you.
The only place in the universe free will exists is here at the Vanishing Point.<eos> No!<eos> No matter what you do, it will happen.<eos> And there is nothing you can do to stop it.<eos> No, I acted without your consent.<eos> In... in defiance of your orders.<eos> Everything I've done has been to save my family.<eos> No one controls me!<eos> We counted on that, your anger, on you going rogue.<eos> We needed something to spur you on, to give you purpose.

I don't know.<eos> I still feel responsible for everything I've done.<eos> And it still keeps me up at night.<eos> It's the things I didn't do that keep me up at night.<eos> - What's that? - Oh, I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's being on this ship traveling through time<eos> I started to wonder what the future might hold for me... and you... and me and you.<eos> You want to steal a kiss from me, Leonard?<eos> You better be one hell of a thief.<eos> How you feeling, Martin?

You don't.<eos> Kill them.<eos> Returning the Jumpship to the Waverider. - Good luck, Mr. Jackson.<eos> - Hope I'm not too late.<eos> No, Jefferson, you're right on time.<eos> - How did you... - What?<eos> You thought you were the only one who knew a thing or two about time travel?<eos> We need to get to the Oculus before reinforcements arrive.<eos> Take about two minutes to figure out how to self-destruct this thing.<eos> We'll buy you some time. You lot guard the entrance.
They're mortal.<eos> They're beneath us.<eos> I want to speak with Time Master Druce. - Mr. Savage.<eos> - I wish to speak with Druce.<eos> Time Master Druce is dead.<eos> Hunter.<eos> We've lost the ability to manipulate time.<eos> And how is that of concern to me?<eos> You are beyond our aid, Mr. Savage.<eos> We cannot help you any longer.
Yeah, well, I think you don't just enjoy punishing the bad guys.<eos> I think you're starting to like seeking justice for the good ones.<eos> He's the Devil!<eos> He's the Devil!<eos> Lucifer?<eos> Well, good morning, Detective.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Setting the table.<eos> - You broke into my house?<eos> Yes, well, I hope you don't mind, but I made a little brekkie.
Right, so just ask me one more time.<eos> Lucifer, there's a girl missing.<eos> Yes, it's just not every day someone kicks you out of your house, then three hours later asks you on a date.<eos> It's not a date.<eos> It's a work thing.<eos> - Oh. - And are you gonna help me or not?<eos> All right.<eos> But only 'cause it coincides perfectly with my own plan.<eos> And what plan is that?<eos> Well, to have sex with you, of course.
- See, you need me.<eos> The department needs you, because you're the one...<eos> I'm the one?<eos> On the list for the Player thing.<eos> You're quite adorable when you're flustered.<eos> I'm not flustered.<eos> I'm nauseous.<eos> Now you're blushing; I'd say I'm making headway.<eos> Okay, look, let me make myself perfectly clear.<eos> I will never, ever, ever sleep with you.
Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Off you pop.<eos> You're Lindsay's brother.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> Because she's a cop.<eos> Great. Say that louder.<eos> I don't think everyone heard you.<eos> Right. Sorry, yes, we're here undercover to find out what happened to your sister.<eos> If you can help me, I'll tell you what happened.
Killed her?<eos> You sure about that?<eos> No, but... look, I know my sister.<eos> She's a good person.<eos> She's sweet.<eos> She wouldn't just run off.<eos> She's not even from L.A.<eos> I'm all she has out here.<eos> She's all I have.<eos> Kevin, I promise you, if anyone here hurt your sister, I'll find them.
No, but... look, I know my sister.<eos> She's a good person.<eos> She's sweet.<eos> She wouldn't just run off.<eos> She's not even from L.A.<eos> I'm all she has out here.<eos> She's all I have.<eos> Kevin, I promise you, if anyone here hurt your sister, I'll find them.<eos> And I'll punish them.<eos> Any method you prefer.
What if you have all those manly whatnots and a woman still doesn't respond?<eos> You may think you have them, but you don't.<eos> - Yeah. - That's why you're here, right?<eos> So, gentlemen, you follow these rules, and you will bed any Betty you desire, guaranteed.<eos> I'm certain I've got everything on your little list, and more, actually, yet this woman here won't have sex with me.<eos> Just listen to the speech, buddy.<eos> The system works.<eos> No, but I doubt that.<eos> Because... because if I can't "bed a Betty," then how do you possibly expect any of these poor miscreants to succeed?<eos> Especially when they're taking advice from a-a wanker such as you?
Yes, I-I'll figure out a way into the party.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> And-and again, I...<eos> So we're going to the Player after-party.<eos> Not you.<eos> I am. Well, I'm not sure how that's possible, now that you've blown your cover.<eos> Well, that was 100% your fault.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> None of that would have happened if you'd just complied with my request.<eos> Do you honestly think you can just ask people to have sex with you and they will?
The berries are ripe and ready to be harvested.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> Huh?<eos> Now, you can't argue with that, can you?<eos> What happened to...<eos> My God.<eos> Oh, oh. Well, yes, I suppose it is his fault.<eos> Whose fault?<eos> My father.<eos> Your dad did that to you?
I'm afraid that's not possible, but I do have another option for you.<eos> How about a broken back, hmm?<eos> You don't understand, I have to go!<eos> They're gonna kill her now!<eos> You just killed Lindsay!<eos> They? They who?<eos> The people who took her.<eos> - Where is Lindsay?<eos> - I don't know, okay?<eos> I swear to you, somebody kidnapped her.
Uh, I'm kind of a polarizing guy.<eos> Okay, the hater list is long.<eos> Hello there, this is Lucifer Morningstar.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> - Do not shush me.<eos> - Who's on the phone?<eos> - All one word, that's right.<eos> Yes, I'll be speaking on Carver's behalf from now on.<eos> No, I'm not a cop.<eos> I assure you.
Yes, I'll be speaking on Carver's behalf from now on.<eos> No, I'm not a cop.<eos> I assure you.<eos> - Is that the...<eos> - Yes, it's the kidnappers.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Of course we have the money.<eos> Just give me a time and location.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> No, I promise you, no police.
Hmm.<eos> I like this line of questioning.<eos> Does this mean you're finally coming around?<eos> No. Just answer the question.<eos> Well, I... I do feel something, but it's not pain so much as, uh, a pressure, a nuisance, really.<eos> Okay, so what does it feel like if you get shot?<eos> Ow.<eos> Well, you asked.<eos> But that's it?<eos> Like, a bullet just bounces off you?
- No, afraid not.<eos> That's the stuff of movies and TV.<eos> Mm-hmm. They always get it wrong.<eos> Well, look, I-I have to admit, I've seen some things I can't explain, but I don't believe in all that Bible stuff.<eos> So you're an atheist.<eos> How ironic.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> I do believe there's good and evil and right and wrong.<eos> But the whole fiery damnation thing, no.<eos> Does it scare you?
Mm-hmm. They always get it wrong.<eos> Well, look, I-I have to admit, I've seen some things I can't explain, but I don't believe in all that Bible stuff.<eos> So you're an atheist.<eos> How ironic.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> I do believe there's good and evil and right and wrong.<eos> But the whole fiery damnation thing, no.<eos> Does it scare you?<eos> No, I mean, how could I be scared of something that I don't believe in?<eos> Do I scare you?
It was just another night for you, but it was a big deal for me.<eos> Oh, God, I'm... I am so sorry, Lindsay.<eos> I-I'm different now.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> But I am.<eos> Okay, may I speak now?<eos> Because I happen to be an expert on punishment, and I'm not sure it fits the crime here.<eos> I mean, Carver made a mistake... well, several really... but... you're different.<eos> He's changed.<eos> Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Please don't hurt me.<eos> Why does everyone say that before they're punished?<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Detective, you should leave.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you?<eos> Did you do this?<eos> I've been trying to tell you, I'm the Devil.
Don't kill me!<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Detective, you should leave.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you?<eos> Did you do this?<eos> I've been trying to tell you, I'm the Devil.<eos> That's... that's not possible.<eos> I assure you, Detective, it is.
I'm broke.<eos> Oh, come now.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You're the Weaponizer.<eos> What is it your badass-kicking self truly desires, hmm?<eos> For my wife to be happy.<eos> That's why I've been willing to take any job.<eos> So she won't find out.<eos> She's my... lighthouse.<eos> What happened to you, man?
I thought he was broke.<eos> Oh, I paid his bail.<eos> Even in this woeful, pathetic state, the Weaponizer does not spend one minute in jail.<eos> "Not on my watch."<eos> See what I did there, with the...<eos> I literally don't know what to say to you right now.<eos> Mr. Morningstar.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, Ryan Goldburg, uh, Kimo's business manager.<eos> I wanted to thank you for making his bail.
He's the one who killed Wesley! !<eos> No, it was her idea!<eos> It was her idea to switch out the Nunchuck Award, cover it in blood...<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> You stole from me, killed Wesley, then you tried to frame me for it? ! Kimo...<eos> I cared about both of you!<eos> No, please!<eos> Kimo... put the gun down.<eos> They murdered Wesley.<eos> And they will pay for that, I promise you.
Though, why do I feel like you're getting more out of our bargain than I am?<eos> Ooh! Hello!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here.<eos> - Donald.<eos> - How are you, sir?<eos> - Oh, I didn't order a drink.<eos> - Courtesy of the owner.<eos> This is from Lucifer?<eos> He asked me to make you something you'd like.
I've looked into you.<eos> Your name really is Lucifer Morningstar.<eos> And as far as I can tell, you didn't exist five years ago.<eos> On the earthly plane, no.<eos> People don't appear out of thin air.<eos> Who were you?<eos> How did you survive getting shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?<eos> Is that your normal reaction to someone saving your life? - Investigating them?<eos> - When I see something I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.<eos> Well, I've given you the answer, Detective. It's not my fault you won't accept it.
Do you know what I think?<eos> I stopped trying to guess.<eos> I think you like me.<eos> What part of the look on my face gives you that impression?<eos> No, no, no, it's not about the face.<eos> It's about the eyes, what's behind them.<eos> I think you see something that you truly desire, and you... you don't know what to do with yourself, do you?<eos> Really?<eos> - That's more like it.<eos> Detective, I never knew you cared.
No bulletproof vest.<eos> What?<eos> I just couldn't imagine how you'd get it under that suit, but I had to check. What is it?<eos> What is it? What is it?<eos> I'm gonna figure out your secret, Lucifer.<eos> Not a secret if I'm telling you the answer!<eos> It's...<eos> Why don't I affect you, Detective? What makes you different?<eos> I guess we both have our mysteries.<eos> Well, I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Oh, God, not that again.
I don't want to talk about it. Oh, so there is something.<eos> Two girls?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - An Eiffel Tower?<eos> What's an Eiffel Tower?<eos> It's marvelous.<eos> It's when two chaps high-five at the top, then the young lady...<eos> Okay, there is an eight-year-old in the room who doesn't need to hear about an Eiffel Tower.<eos> What...? What about the case?<eos> If I were secretly working on it, having you around drawing attention wouldn't be good, would it?
Are you coming or what?<eos> Oh, sorry, I thought this was the part where you leave me behind and say something like, "Lucifer, stay.<eos> - Good devil."<eos> - I'd rather keep my eye on you.<eos> So how do you plan on catching our murderous protégé anyway? Well, I was thinking, what if he never left the scene of the crime?<eos> What, and instead blended in with the other paparazzi taking photos?<eos> That's quite clever.<eos> Yeah, so if we recognize anyone from the crash, it could be our guy.<eos> I'm fine. Why?<eos> Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he? He did.
What, and instead blended in with the other paparazzi taking photos?<eos> That's quite clever.<eos> Yeah, so if we recognize anyone from the crash, it could be our guy.<eos> I'm fine. Why?<eos> Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he? He did.<eos> Got to hear all about your wicked right hook.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He also told me it was a low point for him.<eos> Which I believe, actually.<eos> Yeah, I think our dung beetle, of all things, desires redemption for what he did to you. Yeah, well, he's not going about it the right way,
Yes, we're really not interested in your formative spank bank years, all right?<eos> I'm so sorry about what happened. I would've done something, but I'm not good with violence.<eos> Well, lucky for us, we found you anyhow.<eos> You were looking for me? Why?<eos> Because she wants justice for Robbie Russell Jr.<eos> What is it you want, Josh?<eos> To be first.<eos> To always be first.<eos> Really?<eos> What, did Nick teach you that?
But now that begs the question: what do I do with her?<eos> I have to warn you, he's heavily medicated.<eos> I doubt he'll be able to string two words together right now, much less have a conversation.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, Jimmy.<eos> So this is where you ended up, huh?<eos> I was so wrapped up in recovery, I forgot to come visit.<eos> You know, from when you shot me.<eos> I have to ask you something, Jimmy, about that day.<eos> What happened to you, Jimmy?
Um... What kind of case is it?<eos> Well, the nature of the investigation isn't important. I'm strictly here for professional advice.<eos> What do you do when your case hits a wall? Mmm.<eos> What do I do when I get stuck? Yes.<eos> Well, I grab a pair of fresh eyes... someone who's not gonna be afraid to be honest with me, even if it's not what I want to hear.<eos> Hello.<eos> That's a brilliant idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It kinda is.<eos> So... maybe if you help me, I could help you.
What are you grinning about?<eos> I'm just realizing the gravity of what you're saying.<eos> That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?<eos> That even if you don't choose Hell, all I have do is wait for some pitiful thug to end you and right back to Hell you go.<eos> You hadn't put that one together yet, had you, Lucy?<eos> You just made my millennium.<eos> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I'm Carmen Grant and I humbly welcome you to our Evening of Faith.<eos> Tonight we shall behold items that prove the miraculous is real.<eos> There is a power we can't see, but its light burns bright in the priceless artifacts that have traveled from around the world and, dare I say, Heaven and Hell, to find their way to you!
Do you mind if I come in?<eos> You, Carmen, slightly more difficult to identify, aren't you?<eos> No phone, no bank account, home registered under one of your many aliases.<eos> Seems wings aren't the only thing you falsify, eh? - I can explain...<eos> - I'm still moved by your words.<eos> "I'm a man that believes in one simple divinity,<eos> - the almighty dollar."<eos> - You don't understand... No, I understand.<eos> Perfectly.<eos> A lifelong atheist, you took one peek at the wings and something changed in you.
I thought he was bringing me a sculpture.<eos> Were you disappointed?<eos> I didn't know what they were.<eos> I never would have done it if I had any idea what I was actually dealing with.<eos> Please, please. You can't take them away.<eos> I can't live without them.<eos> Perhaps you don't understand.<eos> They're mine.<eos> Now, before I deal with you, I have just one burning question on my mind.<eos> Who tipped you off?
PreviouslyonLucifer...<eos> So you're the Devil, and you've left Hell behind totakeavacation inLosAngeles.<eos> How could you possibly help me?<eos> I have a certain skill set. I can be very persuasive with people.<eos> I got it; the name, the whole "Lucifer" thing, and desire is like your superpower.<eos> Howdidyousurvive gettingshotsixtimes?<eos> Is that your normal reaction to someone saving your life?<eos> When I see something I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.<eos> Well, I've given you the answer, Detective.
How can you decline this ravishing siren's invitation to imbibe?<eos> Well, if L.A.'s taught me anything, constant rejections do build character.<eos> Sincerely doubt "constant rejection" is something you ever deal with.<eos> You could learn a thing or two from this guy. Oh.<eos> Witty, charming and wise.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Lucifer. Morningstar.<eos> Right, you're the club owner guy who grants people favors.<eos> Yeah, I don't need anything from you.
Especially you.<eos> Oh, one last thing before I go.<eos> Which of you is into killing attractive redheads?<eos> Lucifer?<eos> Detective!<eos> A word?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Finding, then punishing Ali Thornton's actual killer.<eos> How did you know to come to this agency?<eos> I tried to tell you, Detective.
Why don't you tell me what you really want, hmm?<eos> What desires drive a man such as yourself?<eos> I want to be the greatest agent of all time.<eos> Really?<eos> And to do that, I need to protect my clients.<eos> Come on.<eos> And, uh...<eos> If you want to protect Ty, tell us what you know.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> I'll tell you everything. You look into something. Here's a deal.
So when I figured it out, he had already fallen for her.<eos> Oh, suppose I can understand why.<eos> See, after a while, Debra got possessive, controlling-- she thought she was managing him.<eos> So I told Ty he needed to break up with her. He refused.<eos> I made Ty file a restraining order after she broke a girl's nose just for buying him a mojito.<eos> Quite a hair trigger on this Debra, by the sounds of it. Hmm.<eos> If Debra found out that Ty was with that poor girl...<eos> Finally, some rain.<eos> Maybe someone up there is looking out for us.<eos> I can assure you, He's in no way meteorologically inclined.
Wrong gender as well, apparently. Finally, we're getting warmer.<eos> Why are you so hell-bent on proving Ty's not the killer? Like I've been saying,<eos> I want to punish the real killer.<eos> But why?<eos> Is it 'cause you pushed him towards Ali at the party?<eos> Well, I don't see what that has to do with anything.<eos> And I think you're starting to agree with me. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, would you? Bye!<eos> Bye!<eos> There she is.<eos> - Debra Macall? I'm Detective Decker, LAPD. We need to ask you a few questions about Ty Huntley.
Try to look even more like a douche.<eos> Mission accomplished.<eos> She's here.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Ronnie Hillman, problem-solver extraordinaire.<eos> Mm, you checking for a wire or are you just pleased to see me?<eos> Little bit of both. Mmm!<eos> Hello, Mr. Morningstar. Rest assured...<eos> I can help you with your problem.
Why rush? I say the rack.<eos> Ooh. That way, we can really enjoy it.<eos> Better.<eos> Yes, much better. Every joint of every limb dislocated before it's torn off.<eos> No, no, no, no, no-- look, look, look, I just...<eos> I just wanted to get chicks and-and free drinks.<eos> Um, really.<eos> My name is Justin.<eos> I'm from Sherman Oaks.<eos> Oh, Justin... the things I'm gonna do to you.
I just wanted to get chicks and-and free drinks.<eos> Um, really.<eos> My name is Justin.<eos> I'm from Sherman Oaks.<eos> Oh, Justin... the things I'm gonna do to you.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I-I'm sorry!<eos> I only came here one time and I just told some girls that I owned the place, and... and that opened some doors for me and so I just started rolling with it.<eos> How dare you abscond my name!<eos> Please, don't hurt me.<eos> Please. I'm not gonna hurt you, Justin, I'm going to destroy you.
Yes, well, now you owe me one.<eos> Ty!<eos> Ty!<eos> Oh, my baby. Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you.<eos> You are?<eos> Yes, you are crazy, baby.<eos> But you're my crazy, you hear me? Yeah?<eos> Warms the cockles, doesn't it?<eos> So, Detective, looks like you've solved another case because of me.<eos> I solved this case despite you. What?
Oh, my baby. Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you.<eos> You are?<eos> Yes, you are crazy, baby.<eos> But you're my crazy, you hear me? Yeah?<eos> Warms the cockles, doesn't it?<eos> So, Detective, looks like you've solved another case because of me.<eos> I solved this case despite you. What?<eos> What about the cell phone I found?<eos> That was key evidence. Evidence you almost destroyed.<eos> I got you the leverage you needed to crack Ronnie.
They got divorced. And then Richard sent Dr. Shaw a death threat.<eos> It's been more than a year, but that kind of anger can bubble up when you least expect it.<eos> Add him to the list of angry patients.<eos> That's just it. Richard's the only one so far.<eos> Dr. Shaw's patients seem remarkably happy with him.<eos> Oh, do they now?<eos> See, cheater therapy works.<eos> Maybe you should've tried it with Detective Douche.<eos> Or was that what broke you apart?<eos> What is wrong with you lately?
How about I not dignify that with an answer, and instead ask my favor?<eos> I was wondering when you'd get to it.<eos> I want you to talk to Arietta before Connor gets involved.<eos> And why not go to the police? Got something to hide, do you?<eos> They were useless.<eos> Couldn't find anything on Arietta. Why not ask your boss then, hey?<eos> The Almighty Himself. I already have.<eos> Oh, no luck?<eos> On the contrary,<eos> I believe he led me to you.
Oh, I find that hard to believe.<eos> No one's born a priest. Before the cloth, I was just<eos> Frank Lawrence, touring musician. Really?<eos> Let me guess... cowbell.<eos> Close.<eos> Piano.<eos> Good ol' rock and roll. Opened for Dylan, Bowie, the Stones...<eos> The Rolling Stones?<eos> Yep.<eos> It was a crazy time, let me tell you. I was a lot like you, really.
Dan, I know I wanted to talk, but, um... my mind, it's just...<eos> Somewhere else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, mine, too.<eos> Can we do this another time?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No problem.<eos> Hi.<eos> Bit late for a new case, isn't it?<eos> I'm not here for a case. I'm here for you.
We're canvassing the entire area for witnesses now, ma'am.<eos> Let's check with the nearby businesses,<eos> All right. and check the-- Yeah.<eos> Excuse me. Have you thought of all new offensive things to say?<eos> No, I've changed mind.<eos> I've come back to help. Any leads yet? I need your help like I need a third boob.<eos> Mmm! Wait.<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> Knew it was a mistake the minute it came out of my mouth.<eos> We're partners, and I'm offering you my services.
You're Chloe's ex, right?<eos> And you're Lucifer's pet on a leash.<eos> Now answer the question.<eos> Well, technically, that wasn't a question.<eos> Is your divorce final yet? That's none of your business.<eos> Now, are you gonna show me your records, or do I need to get a warrant?<eos> We have nothing to hide. That's great.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> Mm-hmm. Actually, the books are in the office. And there are way too many of them to carry all by myself.<eos> But if you come out back with me, I'll let you see whatever you want.
There's a lot of money in the apparel industry.<eos> All the more reason to keep our noses clean.<eos> See, we used to cover the docks, not anymore.<eos> I specifically ordered them off-limits.<eos> Maybe someone missed the re-branding memo.<eos> Killer wore a bracelet with an iron cross.<eos> Left an imprint on the dead security guard at the warehouse.<eos> Look, uh, a lot of bikers wear iron crosses.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm interested in your guys who have iron crosses.<eos> Hey, look, I've told you everything I know.
Your personal records only go back five years, and the books from Lux are way too clean.<eos> It's... I had Dan go and check it out.<eos> You had Dan deal with Maze alone?<eos> Oh, dear. For the first time, I actually feel sorry for Detective Douche.<eos> It all points to you being a criminal.<eos> So what's the big deal?<eos> What if I am a criminal?<eos> I'd have to arrest you. Ooh, whip out the cuffs, then. Why shy away from a little bondage fun?<eos> You know, Lucifer, this is serious.<eos> And despite all your weirdness I... I actually really like working with you.
I saw them.<eos> Who stole them?<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Who... stole them?<eos> They were yours.<eos> Who stole them?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh... you are gonna more than sorry unless you tell me everything.
I'm always here. Pops worked me to the bone.<eos> A taskmaster, was he?<eos> No matter what you gave him, it wasn't enough?<eos> It wasn't. And I gave him a lot.<eos> Ah, to the bone, indeed.<eos> Did you have any altercations with Pops?<eos> Sure.<eos> All the time. Nothing I did was ever good enough for Pops.<eos> And it never would be, would it?<eos> Which is why he left you with no choice but to take matters into your own hands.
Was there something that you wanted to do when you came back?<eos> Uh, I don't know, like...<eos> Oh, come now.<eos> The prodigal son returns to his overbearing father.<eos> What could you possibly desire?<eos> I wanted... Yes?<eos> ...to have one more meal with my dad.<eos> So you just got into town last night?<eos> Yeah, I-I met Dad here for breakfast.<eos> Did you notice anything strange about him or the meal?
I can recommend you to someone else.<eos> No, I like you.<eos> Look, you helped Lucifer, and I need you to help me.<eos> What seems to be the problem?<eos> I'm stuck in a place I don't belong, and I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.<eos> I need to figure out how to be more normal.<eos> So... "So" what?<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Well, that's not how this works.<eos> Do I need to sleep with you too? What?
So... "So" what?<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Well, that's not how this works.<eos> Do I need to sleep with you too? What?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Really, I'm good.<eos> What I can give you... is my advice.
Daniel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you find something?<eos> A Naomi Austen. She worked as a hostess here last year till she was fired.<eos> She has two arrests for heroin possession over the last year alone.<eos> Poor girl doesn't learn her lesson, does she?<eos> That name sounds familiar. Oh, okay. So one of the cooks said that she showed up two days ago, and was yelling at Javier and Anne, so...<eos> I'll see if her P.O. has an address.<eos> It's already in the file.<eos> You don't care who you piss off, do you?
Nice and tight.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Anne was arrested a few blocks away, so she'll be eating prison slop for a long time to come.<eos> For getting me out. Well, couldn't exactly rush out of there alone.<eos> How would that look?<eos> That's it?<eos> No "thanks for saving me first"?<eos> Is that what happened?<eos> It's funny, it's all so fuzzy now.<eos> Can't believe it's gone. We found out what your dad never got to tell you.
Did Corazon have access to this knife? Yeah, probably.<eos> This here is just for show.<eos> The blade springs inside the handle. Hmm.<eos> Strange.<eos> 'Cause if it was real... it could definitely match the marks found on Rose's body.<eos> We do have an actual version. Hold on.<eos> Knife's gone.<eos> Okay, we need to find Corazon now. - Do you have, um, his real name, uh, where he lives, his address?<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> Looks just like you.
Knife's gone.<eos> Okay, we need to find Corazon now. - Do you have, um, his real name, uh, where he lives, his address?<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> Looks just like you.<eos> I manscape.<eos> I'm starting to understand why you chose this persona.<eos> All-powerful... Invincible...<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Ah.<eos> Or it's because you think that everybody's out to get you.
What do you want me to do, take it all back?<eos> No, can you take your shirt off, please?<eos> What?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I need to see your back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to know if you're an angel sent to destroy me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is this about the scars on your back?<eos> Look, I have no idea what happened to you or what's going on with you now, but... not everyone's out to get you.
Because I want to know if you're an angel sent to destroy me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is this about the scars on your back?<eos> Look, I have no idea what happened to you or what's going on with you now, but... not everyone's out to get you.<eos> It's registered to Mike Carey.<eos> Funny. Come on, I'm just joking.<eos> What a pleasant surprise. Did you find anything?<eos> Place seems empty.<eos> It's definitely Mike Carey.<eos> Detectives, can I show you something?
What do you say we get some ladies up in here, huh?<eos> Blow off some steam! Emphasis on the "blow," huh?<eos> Why are you in my house?<eos> Because I got your back, man.<eos> I saw the way they treated you at the crime scene.<eos> Anyways, I know you didn't kill those people.<eos> Did you?<eos> I'm just joking!<eos> You need to relax, get yourself a little shiatsu.<eos> Ah... This feels good. Feels good, hanging out here with you.

I respect the hell out of you.
You've got red paint on your hand.<eos> Huh?<eos> Just like the paint we found at the warehouse.<eos> I must've gotten it on me at the scene. Oh, I doubt that.<eos> Everyone was wearing gloves.<eos> Aw, man! You caught me!<eos> Literally red-handed.<eos> Oh, I was, I was wondering when you'd figure it out.<eos> You know, when I asked if you did it? Totally thought you were gonna ask me.<eos> Been dying all day to tell you.
And you think you know who that is, don't you?<eos> The whole world does.<eos> A torturer, maybe.<eos> An inflictor of just desserts, sure.<eos> But a senseless murderer I am not.<eos> Perhaps I need to clarify my position. Hey, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I've got this, remember?<eos> Don't worry, Malcolm.<eos> I'm not gonna send you to Hell.<eos> I'm going to bring it right to you.
And that's okay, but we're different.<eos> Like, too different.<eos> Well, as a wise man once said, "opposites attract."<eos> I believe that was an animated cat in a music video.<eos> - A wise animated cat.<eos> - Excuse me. Hi.<eos> I am looking for Andy Kleinberg.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Don't waste your time with him.<eos> Let me get you a drink.
with some Vaseline and a car battery. - What?<eos> - That was a move I call,<eos> "Gentlemen, start your engines."<eos> It's bloody brilliant.<eos> Did you and Lucifer have any intimate moments?<eos> Obviously, we were intimate.<eos> We were hella intimate.!<eos> Did you not hear about the honey? I mean...<eos> We're talking about, um, emotional intimacy.<eos> Like, um... did Lucifer, bring you dinner?

- Just fun...<eos> - but meaningless.<eos> - Meaningless.<eos> - It meant nothing.<eos> Nada.<eos> I never saw him again.<eos> See where I'm going with this?<eos> Well, look, man, the good news is... none of them has motive to be the killer. Because none of them cared enough about me to murder.<eos> Thanks for calling me in.<eos> I actually wanted to speak with you.

Thanks for calling me in.<eos> I actually wanted to speak with you.<eos> Wait a minute, why is she here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I keep telling the detective she's not my ex.<eos> I wanted to tell you that you impressed me.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> I gave you all the reason in the world to betray Lucifer.
I did nothing of the sort.<eos> You took that case just to try and get me to call Lucifer a liar in court.<eos> True, but I would never hurt Lucifer.<eos> I was trying to prove that you weren't worthy of him.<eos> I see.<eos> What about the other women that you don't think are worthy of him? What'd you do to them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.<eos> He's different when he's with you.
Demon.<eos> You just need to realize it for yourself.<eos> Not because I said it.<eos> You're saying I'm awesome.<eos> I'm saying that you need to say that you're awesome.<eos> Believe that you're awesome.<eos> Yes, you're awesome.<eos> Hell yeah I am.<eos> Thanks, Doc.<eos> Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?
What're you doing in my...<eos> Lucifer! - Okay, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, come out with your hands up.<eos> This is one of your exes?<eos> Do you know, I'm really not sure...<eos> I... darling, could you do this?<eos> And say, "I am not a crook."<eos> No, it's definitely not Sexy Richard Nixon.<eos> I'm quite certain we've not slept together.<eos> Well, I could have told you that.
This is one of your exes?<eos> Do you know, I'm really not sure...<eos> I... darling, could you do this?<eos> And say, "I am not a crook."<eos> No, it's definitely not Sexy Richard Nixon.<eos> I'm quite certain we've not slept together.<eos> Well, I could have told you that.<eos> Care to explain the wall?<eos> I'm just... really into Lucifer.<eos> And who could blame you.
See? Trust me, he should know.<eos> No, it's for you, isn't it?<eos> It's a selfish way for you to all feel better about yourselves about how much you ignored this poor sod in life.<eos> Oh, did you choose this suit?<eos> Mr. morningstar, this way.<eos> Oh, you do remember me?<eos> Feel free to carry on.<eos> You have no right disrupting this funeral. This is my business.<eos> Yes. Your least profitable one.<eos> Your main source of income is creating new identities, which is why I came to you five years ago to get my proper papers and all that.
We're not, and we don't.<eos> I have no idea how he can afford all this stuff.<eos> Well, if you don't make good money, why do you do this job?<eos> 'Cause I get to shoot people, which is something you should keep in mind. No really.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I hate it when people get away with things they shouldn't.<eos> And you like to shoot people. Yeah.<eos> And to think I almost killed you in your sleep that one time. Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, now I know why he likes working with you.
I repeat-- if you do not, we will have no choice but to shoot you with our new bazooka.<eos> We've actually been waiting months and months to use it, so, on second thought, please, speed away.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, I could ask you the s...<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> You going somewhere without me, hmm?<eos> Right after all this talk about trusting you, you're immediately keeping secrets?<eos> I don't have time to explain to you.<eos> Something came up. Something that obviously requires quite a bit of cash.<eos> I didn't know you had it in you, detective.
Monkeys are self-aware.<eos> They see themselves, in a mirror, right?<eos> I bet a raped monkey suffers like a woman.<eos> So a raped woman, raped monkey, same thing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What I'm saying isn't so crazy.<eos> Why are we in vet school?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> It's easy, really.<eos> I expected no less from you.
Do you use condoms?<eos> I've never...<eos> Right.<eos> OK.<eos> Ouch.<eos> And this is your rush week?<eos> OK. I think it's food poisoning and you're having a reaction.<eos> Drink lots of liquids. Water, that is.<eos> Avoid solids. Fast a whole day, even.<eos> I'll get you a cream.
OK. I think it's food poisoning and you're having a reaction.<eos> Drink lots of liquids. Water, that is.<eos> Avoid solids. Fast a whole day, even.<eos> I'll get you a cream.<eos> I am hungry though.<eos> My stomach always feels empty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What'd they give you?<eos> Raw rabbit kidneys.<eos> Someone tells you to eat raw rabbit kidney, and you do?
So you cheated.<eos> No.<eos> You admit your friend did.<eos> No.<eos> Miss, I don't have a soft spot for top students, unlike all my colleagues,<eos> I feel more sympathy for your friend than you.<eos> School is tough for him.<eos> He has to fight to stay.<eos> But you, the wonder child, you ride in and depress my students.<eos> Some would sooner drop out than compare themselves to you.
Do you love me?<eos> You hear me in there?<eos> (GATE BUZZES)<eos> What the hell took you so long?<eos> (GROANS)<eos> What the... (GROANS)<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> How much fun is this?<eos> This isn't about fun.<eos> This is my one chance to train you in proper flight technique.
I'lI be waiting for you.<eos> Oh, Winn.<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> - Why did you lie to the feds?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, I've spent my entire life just trying to forget what he did. Trying not to be just consumed by this anger that I have for him.<eos> And trying, even in my best moments, to forgive. But I still just hate him.<eos> I'm leaving an agent here, in case your father shows up.<eos> (SIGHS) Agent Chase...<eos> There's something I have to tell you.
And trying, even in my best moments, to forgive. But I still just hate him.<eos> I'm leaving an agent here, in case your father shows up.<eos> (SIGHS) Agent Chase...<eos> There's something I have to tell you.<eos> If we're going to get inside Lord Technologies, we cut the power in the rear of the lab and infiltrate the basement.<eos> While the emergency generators kick in and his army pounces on us.<eos> This isn't the way in, Hank.<eos> You have a better idea.<eos> You are the greatest asset that we have and nobody knows about it.<eos> all these computers and these weapons, they're nothing compared to you.
How did this happen to you?<eos> Do you know that even with all the amazing toys I've built,<eos> you're the best thing I ever made.<eos> You're just like me.<eos> lam nothing like you.<eos> Don't underestimate yourself.<eos> There's something unique in a child's view of the world.<eos> Something innocent and pure. There's love.<eos> And a way of looking that we as adults tend to forget.<eos> We at Dunholtz Toys want to bring this to the world. Each time you choose a toy, whether it be a doll or a figurine, a race car, building block, you are beginning a journey that's so...
Who was it?<eos> Does this mean I'm on a planet where you're talking to me again?<eos> (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)<eos> Oh, my God, I forgot...<eos> Ms. Grant, I'm sorry, if you'll just give me a minute,<eos> I'll go get your latte.<eos> Oh.<eos> I had a little extra time this morning, so I stopped and I got my own.<eos> Oh. And I almost forgot,<eos> I picked one up for you, too.
Did somebody send you?<eos> Are they making you do this?<eos> We kill Supergirl.<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> (PASSENGERS SCREAMING)<eos> (STRAINING)<eos> She's as strong as me. She flies like me, she fights like me, except for the fact that she talks like Cookie Monster, she is exactly like me.<eos> Red Tornado was programed to analyze and mimic your fighting style and velocity.<eos> Dr. Morrow is dead, but perhaps his schematics for an android--<eos> No. But she is not an android. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We hit her with the Kryptonite dart, but instead of weakening her-- lt made her stronger.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, once again a super-powered monster is unleashed on National City.<eos> And this one's controlled by Maxwell Lord.<eos> Whoever's behind this, we have to neutralize the threat.<eos> You say she's diametrically opposed to Kara?<eos> Fire breath, freeze-vision, it's like she's a mirror image.<eos> In that case, I'll have the labs start reverse engineering the chemical compound to our synthetic Kryptonite.<eos> If its atomic structure is making Bizarro stronger, reversing its ionic charge should have an oppositional effect.<eos> Anything else you'd like to share?
Well, lucky you, because this is the last one.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Maxwell Lord, you're under arrest.<eos> On what charges, hmm?<eos> Aren't you going to read me my rights?<eos> I'm acting on behalf of an extra-legal enforcement organization.<eos> Meaning you don't have any rights.<eos> Unless you want to tell me where Bizarro is.<eos> Mmm, not really.<eos> But I do have some information you might find interesting.
I'm acting on behalf of an extra-legal enforcement organization.<eos> Meaning you don't have any rights.<eos> Unless you want to tell me where Bizarro is.<eos> Mmm, not really.<eos> But I do have some information you might find interesting.<eos> Your sister, sweet-faced, mild-mannered ingenue Kara Danvers?<eos> You take me in, I tell the whole world she's Supergirl.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> Where you're going, there won't be anyone to hear you.
(BIZARRO GROWLING)<eos> I can't get a clean shot.<eos> Just do it!<eos> Kara, I don't know what this is going to do to you if I hit you.<eos> (CHOKING) Take the shot!<eos> (BIZARRO GRUNTS)<eos> (PANTING)<eos> (EXHALES)<eos> HANK HENSHAW:<eos> She's been asking for you.
You're not gonna be alone, either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> (GULPS)<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.<eos> Maxwell Lord made her to be just like me.<eos> And she was.<eos> Guess my girl came in second place.<eos> We'll see how funny you think it is when you've been in that cell for a few years.
Now I see how much more advanced you are than us savages.<eos> I'm General Samuel Lane of the United States Army.<eos> I wonder how many of your fellow humans you had to kill in order to achieve such a rank.<eos> And yet you call me a threat.<eos> (SCOFFS)<eos> When I was a little boy, my daddy used to take me and my sister to the movies.<eos> Saw a picture called The Day the Earth Stood Still.<eos> It was about an alien, like yourself, who came to Earth and threatened to destroy it if human beings didn't change their wicked ways.<eos> I had nightmares for months.<eos> And do you know that still, today, when I look at you,
Look into my eyes, Ker-rah.<eos> What do you see?<eos> - Um...<eos> - Bags.<eos> I stayed up until dawn watching the news coverage of Supergirl.<eos> All the interrupted muggings, and the averted car crashes. And the more I watched, the more I thought about the terrible things that happen while you're here at work.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Then that should prove to you that I'm not her.<eos> I'm in here while she's out there.<eos> Oh, please. We both know that Supergirl is capable of pulling off that parlor trick.<eos> What it really proves to me is how little this job means to you.
(CLATTERING)<eos> (JAMES PANTING)<eos> Next time... I won't stop with the camera.<eos> (PANTING)<eos> May I speak with you, Ms. Grant?<eos> Oh, well, that depends.<eos> Show me your cape.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> I know you want me to tell you I'm Supergirl, but I can't do that.<eos> What I can tell you is that this job, this place, is more important to me than you realize.
No, you can't.<eos> Ker...<eos> (WHOOSHING)<eos> I never realized how absurd you look in that ridiculous outfit.<eos> Blue, yellow, and red.<eos> It's like a color wheel threw up.<eos> (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Grant. But James Olsen said you wanted to see me.<eos> Something about you thinking your assistant was me?<eos> Oh, for God's sake, are we gonna keep on playing this tiresome game?<eos> I told you it wasn't a game, Ms. Grant.
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media. But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> HANK HENSHAW:<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> ALEX:<eos> All these weapons, they're nothing compared to you.
I won't say at my head, but in my general direction and I read it, saw it was for Adam, and maybe...<eos> I finished it for you.<eos> (GASPS)<eos> -(BREATHES DEEPLY)<eos> - I know.<eos> I know this is really bad.<eos> I didn't think he would just show up.<eos> Who told you to think?<eos> You wrote to my son. Now, get out. You're fired.<eos> I was just trying to help you.
-(BREATHES DEEPLY)<eos> - I know.<eos> I know this is really bad.<eos> I didn't think he would just show up.<eos> Who told you to think?<eos> You wrote to my son. Now, get out. You're fired.<eos> I was just trying to help you.<eos> You know my mom died.<eos> I don't get to have a second chance with her.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you and Adam.
- SUPERGIRL:<eos> No.<eos> - Whatever it is, it's gone.<eos> -(PANTING)<eos> (SIRENS WAILING)<eos> Transport Senator Crane to headquarters, right now.<eos> What was that thing?<eos> A creature that doesn't leave any survivors.<eos> We have to move her now, before it comes back.<eos> - What did it do to you?
If you're not gonna be here to handle my calls, Ker-rah, then I suggest you just keep walking and throw yourself off the balcony.<eos> - How did dinner with Adam go?<eos> - Oh.<eos> And then there's that.<eos> Why didn't you prep me?<eos> You took it upon yourself to lure him in with your sunny Danvers sentimentality, and then you just let me go there unprepared.<eos> He's never gonna talk to me again.<eos> I'm sorry it didn't go well.<eos> He didn't come here to see me. He came here because of the letter.<eos> He might as well have come to see you.
And your license has been expired for three years.<eos> Does it expire?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> The expiration date hints at that.<eos> Oh. Well, I'll get everything fixed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ma'am, you cannot drive.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> How am I supposed to get to the DMV?<eos> You'll figure something out, I guess.
God, what was that, like, sympathy or something?<eos> Mr. Luschek... I believe that what you are referring to is called guilt.<eos> But I don't have anything to feel guilty about.<eos> Well, guilt is tricky that way.<eos> Yeah, look, I need an honest opinion.<eos> -Am I a piece of shit?<eos> -Do you want it straight?<eos> -No. -Mmm.<eos> All right.<eos> From what I've observed, you're lazy, you're selfish as all get-out... you don't care about much, you don't seem to shower that often.
Well, that is the most idiotic plan that I have ever heard.<eos> Now, this is comin' from a lady who once tried to sell her own line of ketchup.<eos> But...<eos> Heinz is the only ketchup.<eos> Nobody wants fancy ketchup.<eos> Where were you in '96?<eos> - I was 14.<eos> - Oh, go fuck yourself.<eos> Honey, you can't confess.<eos> It's not gonna do you or her a lick of good.
I want to sue.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure that's the move right now.<eos> A man tried to kill me.<eos> I got to defend myself.<eos> Then you rolled him in a rug and dumped his body.<eos> Manslaughter.<eos> Obstruction of justice.<eos> Aiding and abetting.<eos> Destruction of evidence.<eos> Mr. Finestra, how you doing?
Am I?<eos> Answer the man.<eos> No, you're not a jerk, but I didn't do anything.<eos> Mr. Galasso, please. He would never...<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> He'd fuck you, his partner, right up the fucking ass, but he wouldn't dime me to the cops?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> He's a scumbag.<eos> You're right, a fucking weasel.<eos> But still, to do this, set you up, it requires forethought.
- Joe, come on.<eos> I just... You're a real prick, you know?<eos> I could say a lot of fucking things right now.<eos> - Like what?<eos> The fuck you talking about?<eos> - Joe.<eos> Guy we know, a little beef we had.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - You out of your fucking mind?<eos> Corrado, this had nothing to do with you.
You're not gonna let Travis die out there alone because you're scared for me.<eos> We're past that.<eos> Look, we found this place.<eos> We'll find another.<eos> Mom, we've lost too many.<eos> Are you really gonna leave for the man who abandoned you?<eos> Come with us, Victor.<eos> I had the chance to kill myself.<eos> I chose not to.<eos> I wouldn't die for him, and I'm not dying for any of you.
Maddy.<eos> - Victor--<eos> - I'll be okay.<eos> - Go.<eos> Now.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> They told me you had left.<eos> I saw something and came back.<eos> Let me help you.
Medevac.<eos> It landed in a camp.<eos> Your people never have to know. They'll never find out.<eos> If they follow you... There's a weight that comes.<eos> Luciana and i will do it together.<eos> - Luciana wants to stay.<eos> - Not for the place.<eos> She wants to stay for the people and for you.<eos> She doesn't wanna look at me.<eos> She didn't believe in you because you were immune.

(Gideon) Hold on!<eos> J 'fades away<eos> Oh really?<eos> She was no longer at the time of ejection because she was "annoyed"?<eos> Young girls are irrational and emotionally unstable.<eos> You shall have the chronographs of Lucy and Paul...<eos> L No!<eos> I quiet, exciting<eos> No way.<eos> I'd have said that to you.
Gideon did not come home yesterday.<eos> Did he say something?<eos> No, I can not reach him either!<eos> - Something is not right.<eos> (Charlotte unconcerned) (TV) In addition I bury the CEO...<eos> Hey, wait a minute!<eos> The St. Germain Enterprises, William de Villiers.<eos> (Moderator) Mr de Villiers, it seems as if their company In the eyes of the global economy hurricane?<eos> What do you answer the insecure demonstrators?<eos> Of course, we understand the excitement, But I can assure you, That this is a normal market reaction.
(Telephone rings) J 'end<eos> Hello?<eos> - (Gwen) Charlotte?<eos> - I'm here in Gideon's loft.<eos> No safe line...<eos> I calm, but exciting<eos> Ahm, yes, here...<eos> Here speaks...<eos> Violet Purpleplum.<eos> Miss Montrose, how are you?
Missed me.<eos> Oh, it is 100% non-deadly.<eos> Right now, the laser's on setting two, your basic sunburn-level discomfort.<eos> Dial that bad boy up to ten... we're talking third-degree burns.<eos> Andale, Andale!<eos> Speedy... Ow!<eos> Just a little sting.<eos> Nothing I can't...<eos> Nice shooting, Tex.<eos> Well, well. Wouldn't wanna run into you in the prison yard.
Well, that's a new one.<eos> We don't get touched a lot in here, except by the lezzies.<eos> Sometimes, you need a little human contact.<eos> Especially by an expert.<eos> You're all set.<eos> Hope it was as good for you as it was for me.<eos> Don't forget about my friend over there.<eos> She really misses her boyfriend.<eos> Last frisk of the day.<eos> Can I help you, miss?
I'm just looking for now, thanks.<eos> So comfy.<eos> - I'm Lucas, if you need anything.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Ever drive one of these bad boys?<eos> I wasted half my life driving a Saab.<eos> My wife always said they were safe in an accident.<eos> But they still couldn't pull any bodies from the car wreck of our marriage.<eos> You are bad.<eos> Well... you see anything here you like?
I wasted half my life driving a Saab.<eos> My wife always said they were safe in an accident.<eos> But they still couldn't pull any bodies from the car wreck of our marriage.<eos> You are bad.<eos> Well... you see anything here you like?<eos> Uh... definitely.<eos> Uh, what would you recommend?<eos> Well, the Gran Turismo is awesome, but the Gran Cabrio always gives me a special little tingle.<eos> The Gran Cabrio it is.<eos> We're just gonna need some ID and I'll go hook you up with the keys.
You are all set.<eos> You can take the one down in front in Etruscan onyx.<eos> Uh, Etruscan...<eos> Between the classic obsidian and the midnight noir.<eos> Oh, the Etruscan onyx!<eos> Wait till you feel this transaxle layout.<eos> A pretty lady who knows cars.<eos> This is like a junior high wet dream.<eos> It's important to chase your dreams.<eos> After you.
Yeah... Two spoiled little monsters. Fourteen and 16.<eos> From a previous marriage?<eos> Well, I've only been married the once.<eos> Learned my lesson.<eos> - I'm sorry, I thought you...<eos> - Edward's pretty tough to nail down.<eos> But you can't blame me for trying.<eos> Trying to close the deal, so to speak.<eos> Good.<eos> What about you?
Go ahead, tell my dad. I don't care.<eos> Why? Why would I tell your dad?<eos> No, I... I'm only saying if you did, I wouldn't care.<eos> Danny, telling Jack that you were arrested by a Baltimore rent-a-cop would mean telling him that I was arrested by a Baltimore rent-a-cop.<eos> So rest easy.<eos> Your career as Norma Rae is safe with me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> 'Course I can't speak for her.<eos> So... Linda, huh?<eos> I knew you were in bed with my father, but I didn't know you were doing it with Satan herself.
Are you just too afraid to know?<eos> No.<eos> Come on, don't be silly.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Please.<eos> Just... keep this between us.<eos> Of course.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> You saved my family's life.<eos> I, uh, don't know how to thank you.
That's understandable.<eos> We don't talk much these days. Marriage.<eos> And I certainly did not expect to get kidnapped.<eos> I must have pissed somebody off.<eos> But not Voynov.<eos> I don't even know who he is.<eos> Except that he's on some DHS watch list, which is why I wanted you to think I worked for him.<eos> Why?<eos> So you'd be willing to meet me, preferably unguarded, for obvious reasons.<eos> Your reputation precedes you, Vincent.
What was that?<eos> I'm off the bridge, headed south on Hicks. Where to next?<eos> I've got Vincent on a Port Authority surveillance camera - walking east on DeGraw.<eos> - Okay, then where to?<eos> I don't know, that's the last I see of him.<eos> There's a junkyard ahead on Wharf. Maybe try there.<eos> Try? Vincent might not have time for me to try.<eos> It has to be right.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> At least now I know why I was told to be careful with you.
It has to be right.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> At least now I know why I was told to be careful with you.<eos> So what are you?<eos> Some kind of experiment gone wrong or something?<eos> Or something.<eos> I thought you were supposed to capture me, not kill me.<eos> Not what I was told.<eos> Come on, who sent you?<eos> I can't tell you that, now, can I?
- Oh, nice.<eos> So was Jesus.<eos> - You know who killed him, don't you? - The Romans.<eos> Listen.<eos> We have nothing against Jews.<eos> We just follow the law.<eos> So if you're hiding anyone, you'd better say so.<eos> We have nothing to say.<eos> They send them to work in Germany.<eos> What's that to you?
- We hear different stories.<eos> - People parrot each other and exaggerate.<eos> Well, shall we go upstairs together?<eos> We've known her for such a long time.<eos> - Where is your money?<eos> - My husband had our money.<eos> - And where's your husband?<eos> - He is caught already.<eos> Would you mind turning around?<eos> I believe I can help you.
Lages...<eos> Lages has set a bounty.<eos> Jan, if you want to stop... I'll understand.<eos> Do you have more people on the force?<eos> Well, then.<eos> The Germans also need a new supply.<eos> I can find out when they'll be ready for transport in The Hague.<eos> This house has been requisitioned by the Devisenschutz.<eos> It will be put up for sale, but for now you're safe here.<eos> And how can I thank you?

Gentlemen, come stand next to me.<eos> A family.<eos> I was going to give them to Lages.<eos> But for 40 guilders extra they're yours.<eos> Do you have a light?<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Ten guilders is a lot of money.<eos> - We have to help one another.<eos> - Out of your own pocket?<eos> What do you get out of it?
- And my ID card?<eos> - I'll hold onto it.<eos> - But if I get arrested?<eos> You won't get arrested.<eos> You'll be watched.<eos> Come, they're upstairs.<eos> Good afternoon, everyone.<eos> Pretty smart, hiding in your own house.<eos> - And now?<eos> - I believe I can help you.
But he passed away.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> What was it like?<eos> He was the love of my life.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> Is your sister not here?<eos> Well, what have you got?<eos> Do I really have to tell you?
You said you could help me get to England by way of Antwerp.<eos> - True.<eos> Eventually.<eos> - I think it's time.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> This... is for you.<eos> Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers.<eos> - Is this not more for Catholics?<eos> - As long as it works.<eos> It brought me to you.
- No.<eos> - Come on.<eos> No, that can't be.<eos> - Where are the previous owners?<eos> - Emigrated.<eos> - And I paid them dearly for this.<eos> Sweetheart, they're safe.<eos> I put them on the boat myself.<eos> I was promised protection.<eos> Did Dries Riphagen promise you protection?
We arrest normal families, not bankers.<eos> Then why don't you quit as a policeman?<eos> They'll send me off to Germany. Then what?<eos> - You could go into hiding.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> That's what the Jews are doing.<eos> Think, Jan. Think hard.<eos> Gerrit van der Veen.<eos> - Does he trust you?
Is Dries at home?<eos> No.<eos> Can I come in for a second?<eos> I'm a colleague.<eos> I hardly know any of his colleagues.<eos> - How well do you know your husband?<eos> - How well can you know someone?<eos> I feel for you, Mrs. Riphagen.<eos> And for your baby.<eos> - You have a tough time ahead.
Bye, my darling Dries.'<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - I'm so glad, a Dutchman.<eos> As I told your German friend...<eos> I'm sorry, I don't want to do this.<eos> But otherwise he'll send my wife and child to Poland.<eos> Please, if you know anything...<eos> Maybe I can win time or warn people.<eos> He will force me to go on till you're dead. If you know...<eos> If you talk, I may be able to help you.
- You know very well.<eos> - Sorry, I have no idea.<eos> - Where's Bella?<eos> - Bella?<eos> Bella Tuerlings.<eos> - Or whatever her real name is.<eos> - What's this about?<eos> You forced Bella to betray Gerrit van der Veen.<eos> I didn't do that.<eos> What did that girl tell you?
I helped a damn traitor.<eos> Your own group.<eos> Do you want sugar or apple syrup on your bread?<eos> You open the door.<eos> My name is Lapian.<eos> Personal secretary of Mr. Einthoven.<eos> Mr. Einthoven would like a word with your husband.<eos> - What about?<eos> - These are our references.<eos> Gerrit van der Veen spoke highly of you.
- Yes.<eos> - That bastard.<eos> - Why?<eos> He's my murderer.<eos> He came to Assen, like a thief in the night, to shoot me.<eos> Because I know too much about him.<eos> - He's going to work for Louis Einthoven.<eos> - Then Einthoven swallowed his lies.<eos> I'm prepared to tell the truth, about Jan and all those SD informants.<eos> But I'll only tell you.

Freddy van Nuenen had lists of addresses of Jews in hiding.<eos> We've looked all over Rotterdam. Not a trace.<eos> If she talks, everything will be in vain.<eos> We did all we could.<eos> Put Toon on.<eos> - Wim, where's the SD archive?<eos> - It's being processed.<eos> I want access to it, now.<eos> - Reason?<eos> - I don't have to give you...
He has to avoid this location for the time being.<eos> - How long?<eos> - A week.<eos> So now it'll take another week. Dries.<eos> He told you everything he knows.<eos> Dries is innocent.<eos> I want to go on with our life.<eos> The war is over.<eos> Frits, does Jan know I'm still alive?<eos> - Can I trust you? - Yes.
- How long?<eos> - A week.<eos> So now it'll take another week. Dries.<eos> He told you everything he knows.<eos> Dries is innocent.<eos> I want to go on with our life.<eos> The war is over.<eos> Frits, does Jan know I'm still alive?<eos> - Can I trust you? - Yes.<eos> No, can I trust you?
Dries is innocent.<eos> I want to go on with our life.<eos> The war is over.<eos> Frits, does Jan know I'm still alive?<eos> - Can I trust you? - Yes.<eos> No, can I trust you?<eos> I have a safe in Luxembourg.<eos> The people I saved entrusted their valuables to me.<eos> - Why did you never tell this?<eos> - I didn't know if I could trust you.
He doesn't know I'm here, does he?<eos> Put that thing away.<eos> You can't kill me.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> Then you'll have to kill my wife too. And Harry Rond.<eos> And Lame Toon.<eos> And ten others who know I'm here.<eos> What did you think, dirty little Communist?<eos> Shall I tell you something, Wim Sanders?
That you kill me so I take all secrets to the grave.<eos> Shut up.<eos> No, I won't shut up.<eos> I can tell them things.<eos> About Sanders.<eos> How I hoodwinked him.<eos> How he helped me escape.<eos> The people he killed.<eos> I can tell them about all the Jews I betrayed.<eos> I don't want anything from you.
Or just show her your dick.<eos> There's a pretty good chance she's gonna lap that shit up.<eos> Don't get upset.<eos> It's silly.<eos> It's a silly joke.<eos> Look, I'm not a misogynistic pig.<eos> I think women should judge men equally and harshly.<eos> You know what never fails?<eos> Judge men based on what they drive.<eos> Ladies... if a guy picks you up in a minivan, he is telling you,
"Yeah." "Yeah, she gave me tip money.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I was in, uh, London...<eos> Canada.<eos> Um, they have one.<eos> And...<eos> Doesn't that kinda bother you?<eos> A little bit?<eos> When a barely city is like, "Let's name it after an awesome city."<eos> And they have the nerve to ask you, "How do you like London?"
God." Fuckin' Beef is the name...<eos> Fart is a better name for a strip club.<eos> If somebody was like, "You wanna go to a strip club?<eos> It's called Fart." I'd be like, "No, I don't want to go there."<eos> "There's another one called Beef." "All right, let's check out Fart."<eos> "See where that ends up."<eos> I feel like... the worst part, honestly, of traveling in our country is that there's no surprises.<eos> I swear to you, I travel every week, and it's really a disappointment.<eos> Every place is exactly what I thought it was going to be.<eos> You know? I can prove it to you.
I mean, don't you feel like we could draw a circle around the Midwest and be like,<eos> "Do we need this?"<eos> Except for wherever you're from.<eos> That place is fucking awesome.<eos> The Northeast, shady fucking people in shady cities.<eos> That's all they are. Just shady.<eos> Just fucking all those places.<eos> Jersey, Philly, Balti... they're all...<eos> "How you doing?" "Not now, thank you very much."<eos> "Can I help you with something?" "Nope.
So... Midnight on this flight, the lights come on, and that's too early, right?<eos> That's too early for the red-eye.<eos> I panic.<eos> I think we're dying.<eos> So...<eos> I see the attendant, I go, "Hey, what the fuck's happening?"<eos> She goes, "There's a medical emergency in the back.<eos> Are you a doctor?" And I go, "Look at me."<eos> "You think I'm a doctor?"<eos> And she goes, "Are any of you?" And we go, "No."
we've been together ten years.<eos> And women will actually ask me, sometimes, they'll be like, "Ten years?<eos> That's a pretty good run.<eos> What's the secret?<eos> Is there a secret?"<eos> And I want to tell you that there is.<eos> And ladies, the key to your man's heart is through his... taint.<eos> Now, if you don't know, the taint is that little strip of land between a man's balls and his butthole.<eos> Also known as the Devil's Driveway.<eos> Now some of you are like, "I don't want to go there.
They'll be like, "You know, like, I liked her, but she's not slutty.<eos> She didn't do anything slutty."<eos> I'm like, "Huh.<eos> You tell her what you like?" "Unh-unh."<eos> I'm like, "Oh.<eos> Well, you weird silent fuck."<eos> "You gotta tell her.<eos> If she likes you, she'll do it.<eos> Gotta tell her, 'Put on a clown suit and peg me.' Or whatever you like."<eos> I'll tell you my favorite. I don't give a shit.
There's a hierarchy to the whole thing.<eos> Here's how it works. Japanese, they're number one, which is weird 'cause their genitals are blurry.<eos> But they're number one.<eos> Right? Then...<eos> Chinese and Koreans are right there.<eos> And everybody else who's, like, tan, like...<eos> Vietnamese and Filipino, they're like...<eos> "Fuck you!"<eos> True or not?<eos> Yeah. Don't you feel better about everything right now?
Uh... What do your parents say about them? What's the shit that they talk?<eos> They wanted me to marry one.<eos> They wanted you to marry one?<eos> They wanted her to do whatever you want.<eos> Are your parents Saudi or...?<eos> Can I get this fucking straight for a second?<eos> Your parents were like, "We want our beautiful Chinese boy to marry a Japanese girl so that 'she'll do whatever you want'"?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. So who's this fucking lady sitting next to you?
I miss zero part of having a day job.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> I miss zero part.<eos> The only part I still miss is spreading rumors and gossip about people that work there.<eos> That's the fucking best.<eos> It is! I remember.<eos> Going to work sucks.<eos> That's universal.<eos> I mean, shit!<eos> Most of you will have it on Monday.
And my dad goes, "Oh, I thought he was."<eos> "Is that the end of your investigation?<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> Why did you tell me that?" He goes, "I don't know."<eos> I said, "Did somebody tell you?" He goes, "I can't remember."<eos> I said, "Have you been telling everybody for 15 years that Tommy Lee Jones is gay?"<eos> And he goes, "Yep." I go, "Don't you think we should stop?" He goes, "Now we should."<eos> Just made that shit up.<eos> This is not made-up.<eos> I'll tell you this, man.
Immediately he leans down and he whispers in my ear so nobody else can hear, and he goes, "I've been watching a lot of Netflix."<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, I never thought that sentence could be terrifying.<eos> And now he's just looking at me like, "Now you say something, bitch."<eos> Ya know? I was like, "I never turn it off.<eos> It's the best." I don't know what to say.<eos> He goes, "Now I recognize you."<eos> And I go, "What?"<eos> And he holds up the DVD.<eos> And I go, "I just gave that to you."
I had to fight for it.<eos> You hear that, Carol?<eos> Another name fan.<eos> - This is really impressive.<eos> - We help a lot of women.<eos> Some come in just to get clothes, but we also do job placement and mentoring.<eos> Oh. I will be right back with your donation receipt.<eos> May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, it fits you perfectly.
-It's specific.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna start taking shit from anybody, including you, just because I need a job.<eos> Well, that's unfortunate.<eos> Because short of being a pirate, taking shit is part of every job.<eos> I thought mentors were supposed to be all nice and encouraging.<eos> This is me being nice and encouraging.<eos> God, you're like a two-legged version of my mom.<eos> You went to A Change of A Dress for a reason. Right?<eos> I mean, you probably are right, you have more to offer, but nobody's gonna see that unless you drop the attitude.<eos> I know what I'm doing. I could actually help you get a great job.
Oh, so good.<eos> Can I just say, you not paying me was probably the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> I still can't believe I didn't know you moved in with Eric.<eos> Well, this is what happens when you skip SoulCycle.<eos> Hi, Grace. It is so good to see you again.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It's me, Barry.<eos> Uh, you hired me from Burt's Bees.<eos> The accountant.<eos> I got you the iPod nano for Secret Santa and...
-'Cause I've had it so easy?<eos> -Haven't you, Miss Beach House?<eos> Listen to me, missy.<eos> I have worked since I was 15, and the only reason I stopped was because I retired from a business that I built.<eos> You've had it so hard?<eos> Try being a woman in her 70s. Talk about being invisible.<eos> People act like you don't know anything, that you don't count.<eos> Well, screw that, and screw you!<eos> Screw you, too!<eos> I don't know why I thought I could ever help you.
What are you gonna do, serve it in a cauldron?<eos> Who's the bartender here?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> -I do need to find something to do.<eos> -Right? I should be the mentor.<eos> You know mentors do it out of the goodness of their heart.<eos> -You don't get paid.<eos> -Well, then I should keep doing this.<eos> Look, I know I'm a lousy mentor, but can I give you one last piece of advice?
This'll be one of the few times left I can drive you guys around. Huh?<eos> Uh, I...<eos> You won't be able to hear my dad tell jokes that only he thinks are funny for an entire car ride unless you come.<eos> You don't really wanna miss that.<eos> Wow! I got more gifts than I thought I did.<eos> Can I put this in here?<eos> Yeah, I'll get it.<eos> Thank you, Marcia.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I help you?
You know, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves and nobody even believes that we exist.<eos> If ever something were to happen to me, I've made arrangements with a colleague from Baltimore to take over.<eos> Hmm. Hey, do you, uh... You live alone?<eos> You know this.<eos> I'm sorry, I just meant how long?<eos> Always.<eos> That must be so lonely.<eos> Uh, you know what?<eos> I'm doing much better.<eos> I shouldn't have emailed you.
Clothes you got all dirty from the dust.<eos> One identity in an individual with Dissociative Identity Disorder can have high cholesterol. One.<eos> There have been cases where one identity is allergic to bee stings. The others are not.<eos> Are there moments where two identities can coexist at the same time?<eos> There are times when two identities can take the "light" or "the spot"<eos> or consciousness at the same time.<eos> This happened with a student that I was working with.<eos> And her left and right hand were taking notes in different handwritings about separate things at the same time.<eos> The differences in the identities can be dramatic.<eos> As much as the difference between you and me and every person in that auditorium.
It's kind of like a chenille sweater-dress.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Barry.<eos> I don't think you are.<eos> I've developed a nose for sensing whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.<eos> Have I done something?<eos> You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment two days in a row.<eos> We're just feeling overwhelmed. Garden-variety issues.<eos> I think Orwell or Jade or Samuel or Heinrich had the light for a moment and emailed me. And you're here to tell me everything's okay.<eos> I emailed you.
Yes, I am.<eos> I'm gonna take a professional guess based on the description of all 23 identities that live in Kevin's body, that I've gotten from Barry.<eos> I think I'm talking to Dennis.<eos> But he's been banned from the light because, among other reasons, he has a proclivity to watch young girls dance naked, which he himself knows is wrong and has fought against with little success.<eos> I'm encouraged we can finally meet.<eos> And I've guessed this because you've adjusted the chocolate dish twice since you came in here and I understand you have OCD.<eos> I see.<eos> Now, I see. That's clever.<eos> That's clever, but I'm not Dennis.<eos> And you and Patricia have been banned from the light for quite a while now. Primarily, shall we say, because of your beliefs.
Okay.<eos> But after Mr. Dennis has finished his getting-ready ritual.<eos> I have to go.<eos> He's got an appointment.<eos> When I fall asleep, one of the others keeps trying to reach the doctor lady to tell on us.<eos> That pant, it's got a red lining.<eos> You can see it in the long slit down the side.<eos> We have been talking about silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.<eos> Can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night for an emergency session due to garden-variety issues?<eos> I was down and I emailed you and I woke up and I feel better.
I just want to bring the details back. We'll just talk about the details.<eos> A high school from Camden, New Jersey was on a field trip at your place of work and two young ladies came up to you.<eos> And one took your hand and put it under her shirt on her breast and the second one did the same and then they just ran off laughing to their friends.<eos> You surmised that it might be on a dare.<eos> You said they were 17 or 18.<eos> You said it upset you for days.<eos> It was just a teenage prank.<eos> I get that now.<eos> And see, that's my mistake.<eos> I believe that I went over this incident with you too fast.

He doesn't know how powerful we can be.<eos> Would you mind telling me when you first came into existence?<eos> And how you and Patricia, the other undesirable identity, became aligned?<eos> That's okay.<eos> Do you still have strong beliefs?<eos> That depends on what.<eos> This story of The Beast.<eos> One thing, Dennis, that may comfort you if you are confused is that you've met the other alters.<eos> You're all in a room in chairs, right? Yeah.<eos> But you never met The Beast. Because he doesn't reside with the rest of you.
You can't get in. - No, it's okay.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Hello, Dennis.<eos> One of the others emailed me just now.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Dennis,<eos> Kevin is really lucky to have you.<eos> You are quite extraordinary.<eos> I just don't want you guys to get hurt.
Kevin's mother had rather malevolent ways of punishing a three-year-old.<eos> Is that when you arrived in the light? Yeah.<eos> The one way to avoid her attention was to keep everything spotless, everything perfect.<eos> I know you're coming from good intentions, Dennis, but there are other ways to help Kevin now.<eos> I've lost so many patients into the system.<eos> I want you to know, Dennis, I will never stop fighting for you.<eos> My patients have become my family.<eos> They are what I've chosen instead of a more traditional path.<eos> I hope you feel you can be truly honest with me.<eos> I actually wanna be honest with you.
Lord knows I did not have love for you when you needed it, I know that.<eos> So you ain't gotta love me.<eos> But you gon' know that I love you.<eos> You hear?<eos> You hear me, Chiron?<eos> I hear you, Mama.<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Come here, Mama.<eos> Be right with you.
But you gon' know that I love you.<eos> You hear?<eos> You hear me, Chiron?<eos> I hear you, Mama.<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Come here, Mama.<eos> Be right with you.<eos> I'll be right back with your check.<eos> Be right with you, boss, just let me get this out the way.
Right there in the file that Hill gave us...<eos> If I had an undercover agent on the base with a TMSI catcher device...<eos> Oh, my God, I have to stop Vincent.<eos> Why?<eos> What's he gonna do?<eos> I don't know, but Hill set Vincent up.<eos> So if you want to protect innocent lives, you have to let me warn Vincent that he is walking into a trap.<eos> You are gonna grant me access to computer HQ, now keep moving.<eos> You're making a mistake, Keller.<eos> Bigger than the mistake I made trusting you, Colonel?
Agent Chandler...<eos> You planted that bomb on Vincent.<eos> We saved your life, and you tried to kill him.<eos> I warned DHS, because I wanted to stop him.<eos> Vincent is a dangerous man. That is a lie.<eos> You know he's not.<eos> I know what he is.<eos> Now, you're upset, obviously. But don't say anything you might regret.<eos> DHS has all the information they need on Vincent Keller for now.<eos> We trusted you.

We trusted you.<eos> And I will do everything I can to help you through your loss.<eos> Take her to DHS for debriefing.<eos> Hey, Keller, you got to get out of here.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Yeah, well, I guess neither one of us is good at following orders, Colonel.<eos> Now, keep pressure on this. Okay? Otherwise you're gonna bleed to death.<eos> You never walk away from helping people. Even now.<eos> Keller?<eos> Whoever set you up, they're not gonna stop.
Now, keep pressure on this. Okay? Otherwise you're gonna bleed to death.<eos> You never walk away from helping people. Even now.<eos> Keller?<eos> Whoever set you up, they're not gonna stop.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Catherine...<eos> Go...<eos> Go!<eos> I'm not letting you get away.<eos> I don't know what other companies are courting you, right now, but Tanirushi is prepared to make you a sizeable offer.
You supposed to be protecting us!<eos> I almost died for it. In front of my wife and my daughter.<eos> Now I don't know who put a bounty out on your head, but I told you and your wife to end this before it blew back on me.<eos> My whole career is on the line.<eos> You beasting out is exactly what I need to prove that I shot you in self-defense.<eos> This can't just look real.<eos> It has to be real.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Synthesized adrenaline.<eos> Should help you overcome your control.
Deputy Secretary Hill is in danger, too.<eos> He doesn't know what Vincent is capable of.<eos> If Hill threatens Vincent, he's gonna have no choice but...<eos> No choice but to what, Agent Chandler?<eos> You assured us that your husband wasn't dangerous.<eos> He can be, if I'm not with him.<eos> Even if we believed you about Hill, it's not our call.<eos> I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do about it.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> Do you realize what you're doing, Agent Chandler?
What the hell happened?<eos> Hill planted that bomb.<eos> He's the one who's been trying to kill Vincent.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought Hill was on our side?<eos> Turns out the Feds suck.<eos> I just hope I can find Vincent before it's too late.<eos> I tracked Vincent's earpiece to 62nd Street near the airport.<eos> You want Tess to send backup?<eos> I think I'm bringing my own.<eos> You really don't want to do this, you know.
Mr. Coldwater?<eos> Quentin. Quentin?<eos> Quentin!<eos> Describe The Beast that attacked you.<eos> How did it get in here?<eos> Mr. Coldwater, what did The Beast say to you?
After you.<eos> Hey!<eos> Come on, open the door.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey! Hey, don't be an asshole.<eos> Open the door! Dude!<eos> We were frozen.<eos> Some kind of paralysis spell... took over the whole room.<eos> Let's just nip this all in the bud.<eos> I already told you, the Dean had something in his hand.
The books, they're just...<eos> They always felt realer than anything.<eos> Then it's real.<eos> That's not a real answer.<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> Okay, do it.<eos> Oh, Quentin, I am pleased!<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> You're a much better liar than I expected you to be.
Yeah, did you... how did you?<eos> Because I've dreamed of it too.<eos> And I've looked into that Beast's eyes.<eos> What?<eos> Do you think you have a destiny?<eos> Um, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I used to believe that crap too when I was young.<eos> There is no destiny, no born heroes.<eos> I can't tell you why... why The Beast came sniffing for you.

You can either step up to it or not, it's up to you.<eos> We'll just hope for the best.<eos> Who are you?<eos> So will you if you don't get strong.<eos> Learn fast, any means necessary.<eos> Which is why I'm so pleased to see you sitting there like you don't have an Emerson's in your pocket to repel any spell to wipe your mind.<eos> You stole that.<eos> Who stole it?<eos> Relax, nobody's taking your mind today.<eos> We'll make something of you yet.
I hate these dreams.<eos> It's like your feet are stuck to the floor or you're paralyzed.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You released me, remember, in the real hospital?<eos> I remember what I said.<eos> What was it?<eos> Uh, "You can't keep me here.<eos> I haven't hurt myself or anybody else."<eos> You know that isn't true.<eos> Well, none of this is true, but I said that to you in real life before Brakebills.
- All of them, Alice.<eos> We need them for Bridge.<eos> They collect us from all over the galaxy to feed off our emotions.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> It's an episode of "Lost in Space."<eos> "Star Trek."<eos> What?<eos> That's an episode of "Star Trek."<eos> It's an episode of "Star Trek."<eos> They finally got to you.
I can't--<eos> No, I didn't sign up for this shit.<eos> No, you have to go reverse it now.<eos> Well, I can finally reach you again, but that's never been the problem, has it-- my reaching you?<eos> Will you please, just for once-- no more riddles, okay?<eos> Just tell me what to do.<eos> It doesn't matter what anyone tells you.<eos> You make the web you're in. You're the spider and the fly, just like...<eos> Look, I can help.<eos> I can give you the exact wording of the spell.
A pleasure.<eos> So it was quite a long trip, isn't it?<eos> Quite.<eos> What's the commotion?<eos> Oh, that's Sir William Webb from Australia.<eos> He's our tribunal president.<eos> No more bloodshed to cover, these reporters try to stir up trouble in other ways.<eos> Why did General MacArthur choose you as the president of the tribunal?<eos> [reporter 1] Give us the goods.<eos> Well, you'd better ask the General that one, boys... if you can get him to talk to you.
The State Department has changed its mind.<eos> They seem to think it prudent that we add a few more Asian judges to the mix.<eos> I can manage the increased number.<eos> Ah, good.<eos> Good. I have a few recommendations for you.<eos> And I'd also like to speak at the opening of the tribunal.<eos> I think it might help to move things along.<eos> But the trial and its affairs are the purview of the judges.<eos> As president of the tribunal, I cannot let you speak. Nor can I allow you to influence our deliberations.<eos> You have a definite lack of détente, Webb.
[MacArthur] Yes?<eos> [man] Your next meeting is waiting for you, sir.<eos> [MacArthur] Thank you.<eos> And thank you.<eos> -[knocking on door] -[Webb] Come in.<eos> Uh, good evening, Sir William.<eos> Oh, Justice Mei.<eos> More protocol, I'm afraid.<eos> You have the British judge sitting in my place.<eos> I'm afraid I don't follow you.
The accused before us... include former prime ministers, finance ministers, chiefs of staff... and others who have filled the highest places in the government of Japan.<eos> The former high rank of the accused... entitles them to no greater consideration than would be extended to the humblest Japanese private... or Korean guard.<eos> To our great task... we bring open minds, both on the facts and the law.<eos> The onus will be on the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> I will now call on the accused to plead guilty... or not guilty.<eos> [interpreter] Excuse me, Mr. President.<eos> Defense lawyer Kiyose.<eos> [speaking Japanese] [interpreter] Before the commencement of this arraignment process, one point I would like to make is that Sir Webb is not qualified to administer justice in this trial.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> [interpreter] I wish to assure you that this challenge is made with the greatest respect for this court.
-Oh, you're the judge from Netherlands.<eos> -Yes, indeed.<eos> You've got quite some catching up to do, hmm?<eos> "Even the majority verdict is presented as unanimous.<eos> Dissent is never disclosed."<eos> -I beg your pardon?<eos> -Your words in the chamber.<eos> I heard most of your discussion while having tea with President Webb.<eos> [McDougall] Justice Röling.<eos> I'd like you to meet Justice Jaranilla from the Philippines.
-Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Not long ago, I could not have imagined -being on Japanese soil.<eos> Nor handing out justice, I suspect.<eos> Certainly not in these peaceful circumstances.<eos> -Good evening.<eos> -Evening.<eos> -[in English] Excuse us for a moment.<eos> -Of course.<eos> [in Dutch] Are you enjoying Tokyo?
We should all work together to improve the process.<eos> We'll welcome any proposals you might have.<eos> I have made proposals and they were not accepted.<eos> Then let's reexamine them.<eos> If you leave now, it sends a very bad message.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I have already given this a great deal of thought.<eos> My first sworn duty is to serve as the chief justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court.<eos> I cannot forsake that for this.<eos> I wish you all good luck.
What do you think you're doing?<eos> Oh, no, it's the giant.<eos> If you run away from me, you will regret it, inmate.<eos> Officers in proximity, apprehend inmate Whitehill, approaching C-Yard like an antelope.<eos> And here is living area.<eos> The TV works, but he likes it like that.<eos> I think his name is Randall.<eos> -Does someone come and clean at least?<eos> -That is tenants' responsibility.<eos> Look, if you don't like it, you don't have to be here.
- Yes? Find out if Isabelle's parents still live in Vedène.<eos> OK, I'll check. Bye.<eos> Don't worry, Julie.<eos> Your aunt's solid. You know her.<eos> No.<eos> But she won't give up.<eos> Sorry, but Abdel's the only one that knows I'm here.<eos> Maybe you should...<eos> This is Julie Ravel.<eos> You've all heard about her.
Hello, young lady.<eos> René Coutelé. I think we have an appointment.<eos> Of course I remember her.<eos> She was a shy, retiring woman.<eos> She loved her job.<eos> Did she ever not show up or arrive late?<eos> Isabelle?<eos> No, never.<eos> That's why I called her father when she didn't come in.<eos> Did she ever mention any friends to you?
That was the convent. Mother Élisabeth is waiting.<eos> - Mother Élisabeth?<eos> - Yes. Ah!<eos> You wanted to talk about one of the children.<eos> About her mother, especially.<eos> When a woman gave us a child, we never asked her name.<eos> And they'd never come back.<eos> Never.<eos> Giving up a child is very difficult for a mother.<eos> I don't think I can help you, unfortunately.
Bellac!<eos> - Abdel told me to wear a vest. - Yes.<eos> - OK? - OK.<eos> OK.<eos> You couldn't let him mess your life up.<eos> My life?<eos> What life?<eos> I've got no one.<eos> I always thought my father would come for me.<eos> There are two people here to meet you.
It's your signature, sir.<eos> No, I never signed this document.<eos> Looks like your handwriting, Mr. Palmer.<eos> It is a forgery.<eos> Mr. Duncan, take me to my car.<eos> Sir, I can't let you go anywhere, not in your current condition.<eos> Carla, your job is not to tell me what I cannot do, but to help me do the things I need to do.<eos> Now, help me to my car.<eos> We're going to that ship.<eos> Do you realize you're leaving the safe zone?
You tell me what is or is not my concern.<eos> I've paved the way for all of this.<eos> All of this, including that ship.<eos> Do not overestimate your role, Eldritch.<eos> You are but a servant to the Master.<eos> I am no such thing!<eos> I am not like you: his emissary, his employee.<eos> I am Eldritch Palmer.<eos> I answer to no one.<eos> Certainly not to you.
Proceed.<eos> Jawohl.<eos> Shoot them all.<eos> Including those two.<eos> Schliessen!<eos> Wait!<eos> You chose wisely but slowly, Fetrovsky.<eos> Now, drop him into the pit with the rest.<eos> Proceed!<eos> There's something I didn't tell you.
I tried.<eos> I was denied access to my own ship.<eos> So I went back with armed guards.<eos> All dead.<eos> Every crewman on that ship.<eos> And the cargo hold... empty.<eos> Surely, you must have some clue what it was.<eos> I simply don't have the strength to pursue the matter any longer.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> The formula for the white will help you regain your strength and stamina.

That badge is gonna get you hotel privileges, security, food...<eos> I'm waiting for somebody.<eos> Who exactly are you waiting for, sir?<eos> My son.<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Alright, guys!<eos> Let's move on.<eos> Time to make the donuts.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Brought you more raw materials for the bioweapon.
Of course you do.<eos> You want to know if our search for the Master's demise might also bring about your demise as well.<eos> The book is not yet deciphered.<eos> We still have much work to do.<eos> You will share with us what you have found!<eos> You would be wise not to threaten me, your only ally in this war.<eos> I am not your servant!<eos> I am your best hope.<eos> Fortunately for you, your enemy and mine is the same.<eos> - Can I help you get...
- Back off, big fella.<eos> - Back off!<eos> - I see you got it, huh?<eos> You have a great day!<eos> That's my kinda lady.<eos> Hey, sunshine.<eos> Miss me?<eos> You were gone?<eos> Only for four days.<eos> Guess you didn't notice.
Would you give me and the Professor a moment alone to have a conversation?<eos> Humans only.<eos> - Happy hunting. - Yeah.<eos> You too, slick.<eos> How can you trust that guy?<eos> Mr. Quinlan has been instrumental in translating these pages.<eos> What happens when he gets everything that he needs from this book?<eos> You're splitting rent and utilities with a muncher on steroids!<eos> What happens if you wake up one morning with his stinger in your neck?<eos> If I do, your "I told you so" will be a source of great comfort before you dispatch me.
He's late.<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> What a difference a day makes, huh?<eos> Feeling better, Eldritch?<eos> Ah, it's incredible.<eos> My best biochemists failed to crack the secrets of the white, and yet, somehow, you found a way.<eos> What have you found out about the shipment from Egypt?<eos> Cyrus Minow is the man who ordered me off my own ship.<eos> That's his address. The ungrateful son of a bitch is living in my housing under the protection of my own security personnel.<eos> There's a key card and Stoneheart IDs inside giving you access.

Knock, knock!<eos> Some soup for you.<eos> - Hmm! - And, uh, looking through Fet's personal items...<eos> which I recommend no one do...<eos> I found a thermometer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I washed it.<eos> I don't have a fever.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine. - How are you?
Is this how you pay for your big-screen TV?<eos> I swear I have never seen this place before.<eos> I did not know what they were...<eos> What do you want me to do, hm?<eos> Do you want me to die?<eos> Do you want me to get turned?<eos> They've won.<eos> - I was just doing my job.<eos> - As said by countless facilitators of genocide throughout time.<eos> Do not speak again if you wish to remain alive.
- What are you doing up?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Just thinking about how many times I've almost died - in the last few weeks.<eos> - Oh. I feel much better now.<eos> - Good enough for one of these?<eos> - Always.<eos> Thank you for taking care of me.<eos> It was really quite sweet.<eos> It's nice to see your nurturing, feminine side.<eos> Oh, I figured you'd like that.

The Ancients need sustenance, yet cannot forage for themselves.<eos> - No!<eos> We will find them tonight.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo?<eos> He did better than that.<eos> He led us right to the facility where they were keeping it.<eos> On East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx.<eos> That ring a bell?<eos> You knew its purpose.
Were we still seeking victory or simply forestalling defeat?<eos> There's no need to take your next turn. You've already lost.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> We can play out the next six moves, or you can just knock over your king right now.<eos> Maintain some dignity.<eos> Yeah, it's not gonna happen.<eos> Fine, it was bullshit.<eos> But this game is so boring!<eos> Yeah, well, I think it's over, anyway.<eos> Behind you.
Go there.<eos> That's where we'll meet.<eos> Stay strong, honey.<eos> - We're coming to get you. - Okay.<eos> Wait, Mom.<eos> How are you and Dad together?<eos> We'll explain later.<eos> Okay, honey?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you guys.
Thank you.<eos> We all did.<eos> Authorities in San Francisco are attributing a tremendous amount of lives saved thanks to local experts, who were able to give ample warning of the massive quake.<eos> Meanwhile, recovery efforts have begun in the Bay Area where FEMA, the National Guard and U.N. relief teams have all been mobilized aided by the thousands of volunteers pouring into the state.<eos> Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name.<eos> Ollie.<eos> Ben.<eos> I found this on the boat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanna thank you guys for being there for Blake.
I do know that if you push me away, you won't survive. They'll kill you both.<eos> You manipulative asshole.<eos> I know.<eos> I've heard that before.<eos> Look, if there's one thing I understand in life, it's the bottom line.<eos> And these people, I know how they think.<eos> They've built something, and they won't let it go.<eos> They'll spend whatever they need to, eliminate whoever they have to. They'll just keep coming.<eos> Now I'm not asking you to understand all of this. But I am asking you to grab your daughter and get in the car.<eos> I can take you some place.
-Augie!<eos> -I'm gonna fuck you two up!<eos> -Where you gonna go now?<eos> -There he is!<eos> -Get 'em!<eos> Kill 'em!<eos> No! My mints!<eos> Hey, everybody, we got mints!<eos> It's raining mints!<eos> Now I got you!
Is this a sybian?<eos> -No!<eos> -I assure you this is a sybian.<eos> -You get off it.<eos> -Try this. Let me on.<eos> -Let me get off.<eos> -Let me on! It's a sybian.<eos> Oh, wait a minute, guys, seriously.<eos> Come on, what do you want?<eos> I'll give you anything.
Wow, orpheus.<eos> Don't you ever get lonely down here?<eos> You must have once wished you had a family, right?<eos> Guess what? No.<eos> Fun times we're all having together.<eos> You know what else would be fun?<eos> Finding curt.<eos> It's the reason we came down here.<eos> Fine. Whatevs.<eos> I can get you wherever you wanna go.
Oh, shit, god, fuck me.<eos> I came by to inform you that the concert has been rescheduled.<eos> The good news is you're all still getting paid and laid.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh, fellas, please leave your costumes.<eos> And there is an assortment of groupies waiting outside to suck your dicks.<eos> - Fuck, yeah, dog!<eos> - Word.<eos> Okay, demons and damned, before we sacrifice any mortals, I'd like to introduce to you my favorite boy band, shirtz 'n' skinz!
Uh, two shots of-- fuck is the name of that drink?<eos> Jack. two shots of Jack for me<eos> - and a fuzzy ball.<eos> - Navel.<eos> A fuzzy navel for this pretty little thing next to me.<eos> Oh, and do you have any curry back there?<eos> Jameson, asshole.<eos> I stand corrected. The lady wants "Jameson asshole."<eos> Anyone named Jameson in here?<eos> I'm going to kill you all.
- Noah?<eos> - You're okay.<eos> - God, everyone?<eos> - I think.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Billy?<eos> So sorry.<eos> Baby?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I'll kill you!
- I'm so sorry.<eos> - ( Sobbing )<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> We need to get the hell out of here.<eos> That's what we need to do.<eos> - Shut up, Davidson.<eos> - What, you want to stay here?<eos> I hate it when he makes sense, but he's right. - Yeah.<eos> - Do any of you guys have a phone?
don't worry about the dude in the basement.<eos> We're super... fucked.<eos> - No!<eos> Troit!<eos> - Let it go.<eos> Get down.<eos> Okay, who's the cowboy?<eos> You're the cowboy, huh?<eos> I fucking hate you guys!<eos> Which one of you fucks flipped my car, huh?
Wait!<eos> Smell me now!<eos> I can to fixing your car.<eos> I seen you has broken it.<eos> I didn't break it.<eos> I'm a very good driver.<eos> It's supposed to leak like that.<eos> Can I come into the out now?<eos> I know the fugitive Boov has made yet another in a series of horrible... yet unintentionally humorous mistakes.<eos> But let me reassure you, the signal he broadcast... is being handled.
whole plant takes advantage for our parties.<eos> On party nights all The doors are open.<eos> Idonotbelieveinlimits between people.<eos> Men,women,blacks, white, young, old ...<eos> Down the hall it is where we have the dark room.<eos> Is the dark room?<eos> It is an ancient ritual American Indians Shawnee.<eos> Where the blind can see and the ugly become beautiful.<eos> Someone once made me a armpit for half an hour, is divine.<eos> Let me show you my another favorite room.
Take my hand on the way.<eos> Squeeze very strong.<eos> Hello, Tiger. Where did you been hiding?<eos> 6 o'clock 01:00:39.508 -- 01:00:43.218 - Who is this beautiful girl?<eos> Your name is Amy.<eos> And you are beautiful as ...<eos> Marcia, we really have to leave, we are behind.<eos> Agree.<eos> Good, Alice greets me.<eos> Actually, we'd spend more time with you.
- There is no God?<eos> - All I'm saying... is that if there was ever a time that man needed God it was then and trust me, he wasn't there.<eos> If you're expecting God to save you, he ain't gonna.<eos> Most men came out of that war wanting nothing more to do with killing, but not you... you went looking for it.<eos> God is not responsible for the life you choose.<eos> I did not choose it!<eos> Get off my land.<eos> We just come to finish the conversation that was interrupted, Dan.<eos> Let us avoid unpleasantness.<eos> Sir, I implore you to see reason.
- We're leaving now!<eos> You stay away from her.<eos> - What are you saying, Tom?<eos> - You don't think I see what's going on?<eos> What's going on? - Tom.<eos> - Stay out of this, Reverend.<eos> Look at all of us?<eos> He comes back here after all these years and we welcome him home with... smiles and open arms.<eos> Why?<eos> I'll tell you why.
Woman came out screaming, covered in blood.<eos> First I thought I'd shot her.<eos> Then her husband come out... carrying a little boy.<eos> I killed a boy, Pop.<eos> He looked to be the same age as William.<eos> He just lay there dead 'cause of what I'd done.<eos> Just like William did.<eos> William didn't die because of you. You're not responsible for your brother...<eos> You told me not to take him down to the river.<eos> I told both of you.
I'm speaking to you.<eos> Tom made a deal with McCurdy and now he's changed his mind.<eos> Mary Alice, you need to go home and speak with your husband.<eos> He's gonna get himself killed.<eos> I don't want that for my boy.<eos> You know why he's doing this.<eos> To prove that he's as good as you are.<eos> Mary Alice, I've seen this before and it only ends one way.<eos> You wanna save your family?<eos> You take what McCurdy's offering and you move away. You understand me?
"In this town, there was a place called The Krusty Krab,<eos> "where folks would come to eat a thing called the Krabby Patty.<eos> "Every greasy spoon has a fry cook, and the one who worked here<eos> "was named SpongeBob SquarePants."<eos> # Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? #<eos> # SpongeBob SquarePants! #<eos> # Absorbent and yellow and porous is he #<eos> Just hold it. Hold it.<eos> # SpongeBob SquarePants! #<eos> # If nautical nonsense be something you wish #
# SpongeBob SquarePants! #<eos> Stop!<eos> There's only one thing worse than talking birds, and that would be...<eos> Singing birds!<eos> Okay, I promise not to si-i-i-ng.<eos> Take it from us.<eos> He really does hate singing birds.<eos> Just keep weading.<eos> Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.<eos> Come closer while I tell you the tale.
Curse you, fine print!<eos> Refund! Refund!<eos> Refund!<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm not your enemy!<eos> Plankton is your enemy!<eos> So is he an anemone or a plankton?<eos> Well, someone had to do it.<eos> But Mr. Krabs...<eos> He took this from you!
Well, someone had to do it.<eos> But Mr. Krabs...<eos> He took this from you!<eos> - Krabby Patty...<eos> - I can almost taste it.<eos> Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take the secret formula.<eos> Not now, SpongeBob!<eos> Hey!<eos> I ordered a double Krabby Patty!<eos> So join me! Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of you a free Krabby Patty!
It's okay, everyone.<eos> The post-apocalypse is almost over!<eos> Ain't that right, SpongeBob?<eos> "Eugene, eat my<eos> "subaquatic air bubbles.<eos> Love, Plankton"?<eos> You grabbed the wrong bottle!<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!<eos> That's okay, SpongeBob.<eos> We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then.
It's not about feet.<eos> What is it about, then?<eos> It's about being a team and sticking together, no matter what!<eos> The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air.<eos> - Bubbles!<eos> - SpongeBob, you know this guy?<eos> Don't hurt us!<eos> We're sorry we got you fired.<eos> Hurt you?<eos> Why, I traveled back through time to thank you.
This is what you call riding in style.<eos> Not a lot of legroom in here.<eos> Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!<eos> Note to self:<eos> Never stow away in a gym sock.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I feel tingly!<eos> My neck!<eos> I've done all I can.<eos> The rest is up to you.
Wait a minute!<eos> Now all we need is some ink!<eos> Which Squidward has helpfully provided.<eos> It happens when I'm nervous.<eos> Whatever you're going to do, make it quick!<eos> They're closing in on us!<eos> I'm gonna write us an ending.<eos> Will it be a happy ending?<eos> It's going to be superpowered!<eos> I'll show you a happy ending.
- Aye-aye, Captain!<eos> What did you say?<eos> There's sand in my ears and I can't hear you!<eos> - Aye-aye, Captain!<eos> - Aye-aye, Captain!<eos> # Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? #<eos> # SpongeBob SquarePants! #<eos> # Absorbent and yellow and porous is he! #<eos> # SpongeBob SquarePants! #<eos> # If nautical nonsense be something you wish #
These adorable little freaks are heading to Orlando too.<eos> Yeah, I see that. Hey, Walter Junior.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Tina. - Hi.<eos> Pinkie.<eos> What do you say we give these fellows a ride?<eos> - New friends.<eos> - All aboard the Nelson Express.<eos> You, one eye, You're sitting next to me.<eos> Glad we came along before some weirdos picked you up.
When I started out, people said a woman could never rob a bank as well as a man.<eos> Time's changed.<eos> I love you, Scarlet!<eos> Look at all those faces out there, we are all so different.<eos> But we have one thing in common.<eos> We were born with flippers.<eos> No? Just me?<eos> Okay.<eos> We have big dreams, and we will do anything to make them come true.<eos> Have any of you ever dreamt of working for the greatest supervillain of all time?

Manic.<eos> The Queen's been kidnapped, Sgt.<eos> Blimey!<eos> - What's going on? - Hello.<eos> Gentlemen do not steal ladies' crowns!<eos> Oh-Oh dear!<eos> You scoundrel.<eos> After them!<eos> - Stop the blighter! [SWORD IN THE STONE]<eos> You're surrounded.
Whatever is bothering you, we can make it right.<eos> - Just name it.<eos> - Hurrah! - King Bob!<eos> - Yeh.<eos> Whoa, wait.<eos> - King Bob.<eos> Yes, King Bob.<eos> King Bob?<eos> King Bob?<eos> How dare you.
- Scarlet, over here.<eos> Pardon Me?<eos> Wow, so many.<eos> Good for you,<eos> Well. You all get what you deserved.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I don't want you to take this the wrong way.<eos> But I hate you. I thought I could get over what you did. But I feel so betrayed.<eos> I think, yes, I think we're gonna have to break up.<eos> And it's not you.

- That's the old Hangman costume.<eos> RYAN:<eos> Looks pretty dumb.<eos> MAN 2:<eos> Some kid told us not to touch it.<eos> -Did a little drama nerd tell you not to touch it?<eos> I think he told me too.<eos> But then I didn't listen to him because I'm such a badass.<eos> MAN 3:<eos> Dan and Mark, can I see you guys up on stage?
He knows his lines.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> RYAN:<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Everybody knows he's gonna choke like Charlie did.<eos> We don't say that name, Ryan. I've told you that.<eos> -It's bad luck.<eos> RYAN:<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't get you drama nerds and yourjargon.
Find a light switch.<eos> REESE:<eos> Yeah.<eos> RYAN:<eos> The lights aren't working?<eos> What, is the power out or something?<eos> REESE:<eos> I cannot see anything at all.<eos> RYAN:<eos> Just ask and you shall receive, man.
I'm Ben Whittaker.<eos> I received an e-mail about an interview for the senior intern program.<eos> Hey, Ben. How's it going?<eos> It's going good, real good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Take a seat around the corner, and someone from talent acquisition will come get you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "Talent acquisition"?<eos> Okay, you guys have to remember, the homepage has to read in a glance. - Right.
I got it.<eos> I'm so psyched.<eos> I'm pretty psyched myself.<eos> All right, a few words about Jules.<eos> She started about the fit only 18 months ago.<eos> This whole idea was hatched at Jules' kitchen table right here in Brooklyn.<eos> Jules tried everything on that she sold, described the fit herself, and apparently it worked.<eos> She was online in four months.<eos> She started with 25 employees. She's now up to 216.<eos> With you 4, 220.
I'm in.<eos> ♪ Here she comes ♪ - Cheers!<eos> - Cheers!<eos> ♪ Walkin' down the street ♪<eos> You are a crazy son of a bitch.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I didn't, actually.<eos> I'm sure my blood pressure was through the roof. But it was worth it.<eos> Good times!<eos> Guys, I can't... I literally can't thank you enough for what you just did.
Well, there's a lot to it.<eos> There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.<eos> The double-entry system, that takes a while to get used to.<eos> And we study company law too and that terrifies me.<eos> So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s and all the legal issues that went along with that.<eos> She plays golf and she's really good at it and if she'd been at the dance last Saturday, then I don't think you'd have looked at me twice because Rose is beautiful.<eos> I'm worried.<eos> You haven't eaten anything.<eos> Too busy talking.<eos> What is the matter with you girls now?
I'm worried.<eos> You haven't eaten anything.<eos> Too busy talking.<eos> What is the matter with you girls now?<eos> Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.<eos> Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?<eos> Eilis has a young man?<eos> We didn't know.<eos> She won't say anything about it.<eos> And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?
We didn't know.<eos> She won't say anything about it.<eos> And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?<eos> Anyway, I met him on Saturday night when he called for Eilis, and he's a gentleman.<eos> Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?<eos> We know he's quite nice-looking.<eos> Didn't like his shoes much.<eos> What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?<eos> They were a funny colour.<eos> I'll tell you this much.
You just splashed his mother, his father, and the walls.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> Dear Rose. I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.<eos> He isn't as important as Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that, but I want to tell you everything that's going on.<eos> Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.<eos> You know what she's like.<eos> He's decent and kind, and he has a job and he works hard.<eos> We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.<eos> I think of you and Mother every single day, but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here I didn't have before I met him.<eos> My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.
- Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Right down the third base line.<eos> Is he annoying you?<eos> - Cos he was annoying me. - No, no, no, no.<eos> I got a brother the exact same age.<eos> - Hey, are you Irish?<eos> - Is it so obvious?<eos> I'm just about to marry an Irish girl, so I guess I notice it more.<eos> There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.
(POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)<eos> Everybody! Everybody.<eos> Everybody, everybody.<eos> Can I get your attention?<eos> Uh...<eos> - What you laughing at?<eos> - WOMAN:<eos> Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Record-setting week.<eos> And I wanna say congratulations to you all.
- WOMAN:<eos> Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Record-setting week.<eos> And I wanna say congratulations to you all.<eos> After expenses... $1.2 million.<eos> (ALL CHEER)<eos> Great work, great work.<eos> After the big game's over tomorrow, this place gets bleached down. Anything not nailed to the floor goes in the incinerator.<eos> Horst here has all of your travel money.<eos> Once you get home, I will wire you all your cuts.
- Should I ask who that is?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - Bad guy? - Yeah.<eos> All right, fuck.<eos> - You all right? - Yeah.<eos> - You're kind of out there, aren't you?<eos> - Probably.<eos> Yeah, that's okay.<eos> Can I talk about Mom for a sec?<eos> What happened between you two?
Nope.<eos> - It wasn't the worst part.<eos> - The worst part is that you didn't.<eos> I like the look.<eos> If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.<eos> I need your help.<eos> It's nice to be needed.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.<eos> Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.
By whom?<eos> Parties unknown.<eos> Do we have an ally?<eos> Ultron's got an enemy.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo. Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.<eos> I have you.

Ears, everywhere else.<eos> You kids had all the tech you could dream up.
I could take out the driver.<eos> Negative. That truck crashes, the gem could level the city.<eos> We need to draw out Ultron.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Well, he's definitely unhappy.<eos> I'm gonna try and keep him that way.<eos> You're not a match for him, Cap.<eos> Thanks, Barton.<eos> You know what's in that cradle?<eos> The power to make real change. And that terrifies you.
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> I think a lot about meteors. The purity in them.<eos> Boom! The end.<eos> Start again.<eos> The world made clean for the new man to rebuild.<eos> I was meant to be new.<eos> I was meant to be beautiful.<eos> The world would have looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy.<eos> Instead, they'll look up in horror because of you.
Eden, what the fuck?<eos> Until you stop making a joke out of everything, you'll never learn a thing.<eos> That's why nobody cares what you think.<eos> Um... Yeah. Okay.<eos> She fucking gored me, man.<eos> That was loud.<eos> - Oh, it's not-- - for the vegetarians.<eos> Has she been acting like this all night?<eos> Yeah. David, too.<eos> Look, I'm all for whatever you gotta do to get by, especially you two, with what you went through, but you didn't lose your mind.
You know, they all have lost someone, and then they-- they help each other.<eos> You know, it's really a science rather than, like, some weird religious cult or anything.<eos> You know, it's smart people like--like us, here in L.A., New York, thousands of people.<eos> You'd be surprised. Yeah, my boss is into it.<eos> It's like a new est or something, right?<eos> Yeah, no-- I think it's a little more grounded than that, you know, more practical.<eos> And at the same time, it's very spiritual, you know, however you define that.<eos> Seriously, what goes on down there?<eos> I mean, is it like a self-help group thing or...<eos> Well... Since you asked, we have something that we'd like to show you.
I mean, it is a pretty heavy thing to drop on us, David.<eos> But it's not heavy.<eos> For us, it's not.<eos> - No.<eos> - It's okay. Not everybody gets it.<eos> It's not about the fact that she died.<eos> We all die.<eos> What's it about?<eos> It's about communion.<eos> Right, like Eden said, she's just trying to show you that there's nothing to be afraid of.
- And that skinny girl-- look, I'm not kidding.<eos> Come on. Hey, I got you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Yeah, they're a little weird, but this is L.A.<eos> They're harmless.<eos> Let's just get through this night, give them a break.<eos> Let's steal some more of this wine.<eos> Oh, now that is something I can get behind.<eos> Come on. Hey, guys, listen!<eos> I realize that some of you might have found that video a little disturbing or off-putting, and I apologize for that.

Nah, Gina, it's not.<eos> Last thing I want you guys to think is that I'm trying to force my ideas on you.
All right?<eos> To admit your desires.<eos> You know, because anything is possible once you strip away social constraints and embarrassment and those negative emotions that, you know-- the things that hold us down.<eos> So honesty, okay?<eos> That's what it's about.<eos> Want to give it a shot?<eos> I'll go first.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want... To tell you, Eden, and David...
I'll go first.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want... To tell you, Eden, and David...<eos> Will and Kira and Gina,<eos> Miguel...<eos> Pack a lunch.<eos> And Tommy-- there are so many.<eos> Ben, Claire, pruitt...<eos> I want to tell you all that I love you.
You're the worst rehabber in the world.<eos> No, David, don't.<eos> I was kidding.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> That's okay. That's the point of the game.<eos> Okay. I wasn't kidding.<eos> Bust that shit out.<eos> There you go.<eos> I like this game.<eos> I want to tell you about my wife Margaret.
I don't pretend to know what you went through with your wife, and you don't know me.<eos> You can't.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> I tried to convince Claire to stay.<eos> I felt bad about, uh, my story scaring her.<eos> She seemed to understand.<eos> No, I swear to god, every day.<eos> Every day I get an email, and it's just I'm going, you know, "what is this?<eos> Is this, like, gonna kill my hard drive?"<eos> And it's usually some stupid fricking video of, like-- how many cat videos has Claire sent you?
My dear... even if we go no further, we made it all the way to the Supreme Court.<eos> And that's quite a long way for an Austrian girl like me.<eos> Can you please show me the way to the washroom, sir?<eos> Good, now say it again, but with an American accent.<eos> If you say it like this, then nobody will understand you.<eos> You can talk.<eos> You sound like a silly Frankfurter.<eos> I am a man, not a sausage.<eos> Maria Altmann!<eos> Which one of you is Maria Altmann?
DARPA designed this.<eos> So it could actually be real, right?<eos> It's possible.<eos> We should try to build it.<eos> You guys, my dad messed around with a bunch of junk down here.<eos> Why would he hide junk then?<eos> It's in a fricking case in the ground?<eos> Even if it wasn't junk...<eos> Dude, he must have left this for you.<eos> Okay, I know you'd like to think that my dad left me a time machine, okay,but"
What's my hand doing?<eos> David, the battery's overheating!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was...<eos> That was awesome.<eos> These batteries are dead.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Guys?<eos> Does this seem familiar to you?
I mean, we have the means, right?<eos> This is what we should be doing in the first place, not partying-<eos> Hey.<eos> Guys, what's the emergency?<eos> David, look at this.<eos> There was a plane crash, David.<eos> Seventy-seven people on board a flight from London to Madrid.<eos> It happened five days ago.<eos> Jesus.<eos> So, why are you guys watching a plane crash?
And fish soup three times a day.<eos> It's so disgusting.<eos> There's an eyeball in mine.<eos> It's staring at me.<eos> Yuck. Come on, Ruby. It's not that bad.<eos> I don't even like fish! Do we have to eat this, Mrs. Trinklebury?<eos> I'm gonna vomit. Thanks to Bog-Eyes, We're on curfew and vomit soup all week.<eos> Yeah, Bog-Eyes. Don't you be rude about my food!<eos> I put a nice piece of mackerel in there.<eos> One of you should find it.
♪ Of space You know, you really should enter the talent contest.<eos> I... I can't sing in front of other people.<eos> Rubbish.<eos> You sing to me all the time.<eos> That's different. In front of strangers,<eos> I go all like jelly.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I'll do it with you.<eos> You will?<eos> Neither of you are going anywhere!

[Audience murmuring]<eos> Oh, Belle, come on!<eos> It's starting! Molly Moon!<eos> Oh, Molly Moon!<eos> I can't wait to see her!<eos> She's so famous!<eos> [Applause] ANNOUNCER: Molly Moon!<eos> Please let this work.<eos> Hello, everybody.<eos> It's nice to meet you.
You know, they took their glasses off.<eos> MOLLY: Aw, they look happy now.<eos> We've got to get those jewels back, don't we, Nockman?<eos> Yeah.<eos> REPORTER: Mystery surrounds the discovery Of two notorious criminals<eos> Found in Trafalgar Square this morning. Police believe they masterminded Yesterday's Shorings Bank robbery.<eos> The jewels from the heist were recovered Along with 847 garden gnomes.<eos> Now there's a Christmas puzzle to solve.<eos> So tell them you're going to Briersville, hmm,<eos> And they'll tell you where to change trains.
I thought Bartholomew was dead? And I'm a ghost.<eos> He came back as a ghost with even greater powers.<eos> Ghost, you go away!<eos> My powers are even greater now.<eos> I cannot handle this.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Stay away from him.<eos> Clarinda, you don't know what a ghost can do to you!<eos> Even from beyond the grave.<eos> Grandma's gonna take you to the birthday party, okay?
I apologize sincerely.<eos> I'm gonna clean all this up.<eos> Dad, no. Don't clean it up.<eos> Dad, stop.<eos> Just don't, okay?<eos> Stop. I'll do it.<eos> I just want to get you out of this room.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi, guys. I'm sorry about all the yelling.<eos> Mimi's gonna take you to the birthday party, okay?
And another thing, Rudy.<eos> Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting with you and Trudy at your office... to discuss her investing in the manufacturing of my new idea.<eos> No.<eos> I'm still getting to know her and falling in love.<eos> I can't do that. I won't do that.<eos> And what manufacturing idea?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I have always been there for you, no matter what.<eos> I didn't go away to school.<eos> I stayed to help you and Mom through the divorce and do your accounting.
I have ventures that I'm planning to launch here... at this existing business.<eos> You never mentioned any of this... until I came to Trudy to ask for an investment.<eos> What's Morris's third question?<eos> Are you prepared... within six months of commencing this venture... to show adequate returns?<eos> I accept your terms.<eos> Don't do it, Joy.<eos> What's the fourth question?<eos> You are in a room, and there is a gun on the table.<eos> And the only other person in the room is an adversary in commerce.<eos> Only one of you can prevail.
Okay. We need a phone call right now.<eos> When they can't call through, we gotta keep them watching.<eos> Did we get a call? Did we get a call?<eos> Got it. Keep this going.<eos> Phone call right now.<eos> Wait, wait, wait! We have a caller!<eos> Sharon from Colorado.<eos> Hi, Sharon.<eos> Hi, Sharon. Cindy and Joan!<eos> I can't believe I'm talking to you!
I have dog germs!<eos> Get hot water! Get some disinfectant! Get some iodine!<eos> Let's keep this thing moving.<eos> Time's a-wasting.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Break a leg, Chuck!<eos> Treat your assistant kindly, Charles.<eos> Okay, Sally, we're running behind, so gallop, don't trot!<eos> Save the applause for the end, everyone.<eos> If you like this, wait for the encore!
Bye!<eos> This sucks.<eos> Tell me when the lady comes back.<eos> I'll put in another tape.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look for one marked "Shoulders."<eos> Fellas, how's the game going?<eos> Who's winning?<eos> Why aren't you guys talking to me?<eos> I'm one of you!
Go, Mike, go, go, go!<eos> Fuck!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit!<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with your house?<eos> When you grow up, you're going to take care of your sister and a lot of others.<eos> Because the two of you are going to help us find other special people just like you.
He requested it.<eos> I do not believe my faith will object.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> From the 14th chapter... of Saint John.<eos> "Let not your heart be troubled:<eos> "You believe in God, "believe also in me.<eos> "In my Father's house are many mansions:<eos> If it were not so..."<eos> "I would have told you." "I go to prepare a place for you."
Find me a man who knows how to set a fire.<eos> Next time we go into that godforsaken valley, we'll burn it to cinders.<eos> If I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's leave him, gentlemen.<eos> We were gonna spend the rest of our lives... together.<eos> Stand easy. Mr. Wise. Mr. Colonna.<eos> I am told that you cadets decided to lead the charge of your own volition.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Are they not teaching you the value of the chain of command at the Institute?
Yeah, go on.<eos> -Yeah, shuffle up, Will.<eos> -Dance now, boy.<eos> -Shuffle on over.<eos> -There you go.<eos> -That's some white boy shit right there.<eos> Now, I do want to carve my eyes out.<eos> -What'd you say?<eos> -Hey, fellers...<eos> I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.
And, Chico, if you ever grab my arm like that again, I'll put six bullets in your head.<eos> --That's quite a beating.<eos> Hope you and your drink are okay.<eos> Why do you want to meet this Frank Stockburn so badly, huh?<eos> Frank Stockburn's my father.<eos> If Frank Stockburn is your father, raise your hand.<eos> Gall dang!<eos> Chico's right.<eos> Getting late, starting to thin out.<eos> Can I tell you guys something?
Getting late, starting to thin out.<eos> Can I tell you guys something?<eos> Because I don't wanna have no secrets between us.<eos> Of course.<eos> -Yeah, we're brothers.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Now, I know Dad is a white man, but my mother... was actually black.<eos> So that, technically, makes me half-black.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Well, I didn't wanna hide that from you in case you guys slipped up and made some racial slurs -not knowing I wasn't 100% white.
Excuse me, Sheriff.<eos> Is there a church in this town?<eos> This is Rattler's Gulch, you halfwit.<eos> The meanest, crookedest, most hellacious town in the West.<eos> We don't need no preacher telling us what we can and cannot do.<eos> So it's all right if I do this to your wife?<eos> I can't wait to see all you nice people when I'm dangling!<eos> You sick bastard.<eos> Get this over with.<eos> You're in for a real treat today.
We got the money!<eos> - The Ridiculous 6 got all the money!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Tommy!<eos> Tommy! What's Dad like?<eos> Is he funny?<eos> Yeah, is he a good listener?<eos> Is he strong?<eos> All great questions.<eos> I'll tell you this.
Wait!<eos> You can't just leave us here, you gotta get us out!<eos> --You don't need to- - Hey, hey, hey! We still got the money!<eos> Yeah, I hid it in my pants.<eos> We'll give it back to ya!<eos> We don't need no more.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Can you at least help me pick these ants out of my beard before you head out?<eos> Please?<eos> Tell you what, we'll dig you up on one condition.
Right out there.<eos> But we can't waste any time.<eos> Chico... I can't figure it out right now.<eos> I gotta...<eos> Just give me till sunrise. Let me think.<eos> Dear brothers, by the time you read this, I will have caught up with Dad.<eos> And I'm sure you're sore at me for sneaking out on you.<eos> But this fellow, Cicero, who took Pa, also took my mother's life, and I mean to make him pay for that.<eos> Things might get messy.<eos> I can live with all the bad stuff we've done, the hold-ups, the burglaries, the accidental decapitation, but I couldn't live with myself if something happened to one of you.

Especially when I was shooting somebody.<eos> Well, killer, your luck just ran out.<eos> Your hand touch that knife, boy, it'll be the last thing you ever touch.<eos> Oh, I ain't using these knives.<eos> No.<eos> Not for my mama.<eos> I saved a special one just for you.<eos> Now you die, Injun-lover.<eos> He dies, you die.<eos> Fourteen of us, six of you.
Don't deny who you are.<eos> If you knew who we really were, you'd be very scared right now.<eos> Don't overplay your hand, son.<eos> I'm still holding an ace.<eos> I found her.<eos> I-- I told you I'd find her.<eos> This little beauty stumbled into our camp a few days ago.<eos> She actually tried to rescue me.<eos> I'm guessing this means you don't want me to be your best man no more, huh?<eos> Well, I'm gonna make this real simple for you.
Come on, get the horses!<eos> My ass! My ass!<eos> Is this here still valid, or is it too burnt up?<eos> Let me take a look here.<eos> Uh, that looks good to me. I mean, this looks good.<eos> What in the hell?<eos> You didn't scoop yours out, did you?<eos> What was the question again?<eos> What?<eos> Did any of you really do it?
Look how old you've become.<eos> Something far worse has happened to you.<eos> You know what I've come for.<eos> I know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.<eos> The map to Skywalker.<eos> We know you found it.<eos> And now you're going to give it to the First Order.<eos> The First Order rose from the dark side.<eos> You did not.<eos> I'll show you the dark side.
In the morning, you go.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I had no idea we had... the best pilot in the Resistance on board.<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Not really.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> No one has been able to get out of you... what you did with the map.<eos> You might want to rethink your technique.<eos> Where is it?<eos> The Resistance... will not be intimidated by you.
But you tell us where the base is... I'll get you there first. Deal?<eos> - Droid, please!<eos> - Pilex driver, hurry.<eos> - So, where's your base?<eos> - Go on, BB-8, tell her.<eos> Please.<eos> - The Ileenium system?<eos> - Yeah, the Ileenium system.<eos> That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can.<eos> I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.
During the long, dark period of the Great Wars, an elite class of soldier rose from battle.<eos> Their unbreakable code was simple... possess a noble heart of courage, right conduct, and absolute devotion to one's master.<eos> From out of those years of bloodshed, an empire would emerge.<eos> Its power would assimilate persons of every color, creed, and faith.<eos> This uncontested rule eroded the traditions of the great knights, but not for all.<eos> Lay down your swords, you may walk free.<eos> I'm the official envoy of the Emperor.<eos> I carry a message for Lord Bartok.<eos> I welcome you to the castle.
I carry a message for Lord Bartok.<eos> I welcome you to the castle.<eos> I will take the message.<eos> The message is for you master.<eos> Anyone who wishes to speak with my master must first speak with me.<eos> Do you believe that the words of the Emperor are fit for a mere retainer?<eos> I have no doubt that your arrogance is effective in other houses. Therefore, it is a mistake I am willing to forgive.<eos> What is your name, foot soldier?<eos> I'm certain that the Emperor himself would want to know who has been so charitable toward his envoy.<eos> An introduction would have been the right place for you to start.
When they've taken half my land?<eos> When it comes to a point where I have to exercise my own tyranny over those beneath me to support the bribes of those above?<eos> Who does he think he is?<eos> Perhaps he did not understand what is expected of him.<eos> He understands perfectly.<eos> Does he arrive here planning to make a name for himself at my expense?<eos> Or is he so filled up with pride that he has no room for humility?<eos> Here, dog, a silk for your filth!<eos> Where are we expected?<eos> There is something I wish to show you.
I'm reaching the end of my patience with you.<eos> We can play this game as long as you like, but you'll receive no bribe from me.<eos> Is that what this is to you? A game?<eos> How do you think the Emperor would respond to his command being thought of as a game?<eos> Since you're only threat seems to be running to the Emperor like a pouting child, - you should ask him as soon as possible.<eos> - I need not ask.<eos> You were ordered to this review by the Emperor, and yet you reject his word.<eos> I reject any attempt by you to exert some delusional power over me.<eos> It is you who live under illusion, not me.<eos> I offer you no threat but a promise.
- I need not ask.<eos> You were ordered to this review by the Emperor, and yet you reject his word.<eos> I reject any attempt by you to exert some delusional power over me.<eos> It is you who live under illusion, not me.<eos> I offer you no threat but a promise.<eos> I will not only take your property and standing, but I will turn everything connected to the Bartok name into dust.<eos> And when I'm done, it will be as if neither you nor any generation before had ever existed.<eos> You should be careful not to overstep.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> I have known many like you, men who... once their hairs bleed grey and their spines cut them like daggers, come to revise their own history.
The prisoner will now be permitted to address his peers before our master passes judgment.<eos> What has just been said of me is true.<eos> I offer no argument nor dispute the simple facts.<eos> But they hardly begin to cover the scope of my true crimes.<eos> Honor requires more than admission, so I offer a full confession and the whole truth.<eos> For far too long, I failed to recognize my own hypocrisy.<eos> I ignored my own cowardice, conveniently hiding behind a position of political compromise.<eos> And for what?<eos> To retain the meager wealth and rank that men desire.<eos> So I come before you a condemned man for having finally stood up to injustice.
To retain the meager wealth and rank that men desire.<eos> So I come before you a condemned man for having finally stood up to injustice.<eos> My shame and regret is that I failed to do so before it arrived in my own court.<eos> We supply the armies, we build the roads, we employ the nation.<eos> Still, we remain silent while our coffers are emptied and our freedoms eroded.<eos> There will be times where we are powerless to injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.<eos> This man, Gezza Mott, is a cancer, growing.<eos> And the only proper thing to do is to cut it out.<eos> You all know what I speak of.<eos> Each one of you has been subjected to his extortion.

All those in your house shall be evicted from your lands.<eos> The Bartok clan is no more.<eos> And your delusions of self require more extreme measures.<eos> Your crime and defiance to the ordinances of the capital shall be repaid with nothing less than your head.<eos> - You cannot do this!<eos> - How dare you address the Emperor directly!<eos> My Lord, a judgment of this kind is unprecedented for a nobleman.<eos> This display of arrogance cannot go unanswered.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Your Commander is fiercely loyal to you, Lord Bartok.
We must deal with Commander Raiden with a quick and firm hand.<eos> Do you offer this for our master's benefit or your own?<eos> Did you see how he stood before you?<eos> He's a rabid dog, that one.<eos> We control the warriors through their absolute loyalty to their masters.<eos> How do you think two million of them would react if we eliminated one of their own for exemplifying... - ...the virtue of loyalty?<eos> - What if he should seek vengeance?<eos> He is not to be touched.<eos> There are already too many disavowed looking for a reason to act.<eos> If you come upon real proof that he intends to move against you, then I will order his death.
But that you'd sell your sword only proves you never will.<eos> If you have something to say to me to make me think otherwise, now is the time.<eos> Sir, the Minister has been summoned.<eos> His wisdom and loyalty will forever be remembered.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Before his passing, First Council recommended I pay attention to your dealings with the noblemen.<eos> He believed your methods are exceeding political and moral propriety.<eos> There is a balance to be maintained between dominance and patronage.<eos> Your initial gesture as First Council will be a new tax relief for both the citizens and the noblemen.<eos> It is the great honor of my life to serve you in this capacity.

- It is him!<eos> - Stay in your chambers.<eos> Why did I ever trust you?<eos> I told you, you imbecile!<eos> Remain in your chambers!<eos> Open the flaps!<eos> Ready the archers!<eos> Lord Bartok was my oldest and dearest friend.<eos> I knew you would not allow this disgrace to go unavenged.<eos> My master told me that should I be left without anyone to trust, that I could always trust you.
Whatever it is, it can't be worse than my imagination.<eos> I'm thinking of 10,000 terrible things right now, so, just tell me.<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> I just want you to leave.<eos> I'm going nowhere.<eos> So, just tell me everything.<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, baby?<eos> I killed a man.<eos> Now, let me tell you a story about Vee.
Red flowers, white flowers.<eos> It'll be perfect.<eos> But right now, I've got to put you to sleep myself.<eos> Because I love you the most.<eos> You understand me, son?<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> I am not your son.<eos> You are not my pop.<eos> You are a bad man.<eos> Now, let me tell you a story about Vee.
Hey, you know who could fix the kid in a snap? Vlad.<eos> What?<eos> We don't need to call Vlad.<eos> We got this.<eos> You see, Denisovich, monsters are nice, just like you.<eos> But when the moon comes out, the real monster fun begins.<eos> Being scary.<eos> Right, guys?<eos> Guys!<eos> What is wrong with you? Come on.
Mike was afraid he'd get disemboweled and eaten, - but I told him he was just being silly.<eos> - That was you, Linda.<eos> There they are.<eos> You know, we have a couple of mixed families in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd invite them over.<eos> They might be nice for you guys to talk to since you're thinkin' about moving here.<eos> Hi, Caren.<eos> Hi, Pandragora.<eos> - Welcome, Mavis.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
People are totally cool with our lifestyle choice.<eos> I mean, the kids get picked on a little, but it toughens them up.<eos> Oh, hey, you guys.<eos> And this is Loretta.<eos> She's married to Paul, - who's a werewolf.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Yes, I was telling Mavis about the other monster-human couples in town.<eos> - I am not a werewolf. - Oh.<eos> I thought...<eos> Well, you're welcome to stay and have some cupcakes.
- Where could he be?<eos> I don't know why I ever invited you.<eos> Stop squirming.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Because this is wrong.<eos> Why doesn't anybody get that?<eos> Humans don't belong with monsters.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> - I am not!<eos> I am holding you hostage.
In what has been described as the world's deadliest conflict since World War II, millions of people have been killed.<eos> Massacres and rape, routinely used as weapons of war, have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes.<eos> For years, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, NGOs, have been providing humanitarian relief in an increasingly unstable situation, often requiring the presence of private security contractors to ensure aid workers' safety.<eos> The conflict is fuelled by the country's vast mineral wealth, with all sides suspected of deliberately prolonging the violence to plunder natural resources such as gold, diamonds, copper, coltan, and other high-value minerals to meet the growing demand of the Western world.<eos> Despite calls for a ceasefire and the presence of UN peacekeepers, a deteriorating humanitarian situation of poverty and corruption jeopardize hopes of a lasting peace and reconstruction of the shattered nation.<eos> Jimmy!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What are you drinking?<eos> Oh, you guys look pretty tonight, but I got my gal over here.<eos> I'll buy you one.
Target vehicle: B7 armored white, Toyota Land Cruiser.<eos> The convoy will travel westbound down the boulevard.<eos> He'll hit a natural choke point, giving us three to five-second window of opportunity.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You guys are already zeroed for ballistic advantage.<eos> Your drop cards are adjusted to Kinshasa density altitude, right?<eos> - Roger that.<eos> - Roger. Green light?<eos> Felix will give the green light when he confirms the target is inbound.<eos> Felix will also designate which of you shooters engages.
You motherfucker.<eos> You come back here, I'll give you Annie.<eos> You know where we are, or did you forget that, too?<eos> You're gonna meet me out in a public place, right out in the open.<eos> - Why would I do that, Jim? - Why would you do that?<eos> Take a look at your phone.<eos> I'm gonna send you a little something, okay?<eos> Your drop cards are adjusted to Kinshasa density altitude, right?<eos> Felix will give the green light when he confirms the target is inbound.<eos> Felix will also designate which of you shooters engages.
Did you guys hear about Jessica? - Yeah.<eos> - It's, like, all over school.<eos> Did you know Jessica?<eos> We used to be friends, but...<eos> You were all friends before?<eos> No, I used to be good friends with her, but...<eos> Oh, you... not anymore?<eos> No, just, like, high school.<eos> You know, you grow up.<eos> But nothing happened between the two of you?
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Jess.<eos> What happened today?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Did she come up to you today?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Jess, are you sure you're OK?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hi, ladies.<eos> How are you?
- Love you, too!<eos> So, Day... ha! Day One kinda... kinda sucked.<eos> So we'll try again tomorrow if we feel like it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> OK!<eos> OK.<eos> OK, so... my name is Avery Keller, and this is my first... video... journal thing, so... yeah, I don't really know what to talk about.<eos> I...am a normal teenage girl.<eos> Maddy, Tessa, Kayla, and Emily... and they're... super fun.<eos> All right, so my girls and I want to show you what it's like to be the sophomores...
Phenomenal, but the question I ask all of you is, why didn't you say the grades that person had?<eos> Sports they played?<eos> Cars they drove?<eos> Money that they did and didn't have?<eos> Anybody?<eos> Because that's irrelevant.<eos> It's not important?<eos> Doesn't matter?<eos> Then why do we believe so much that it does matter?<eos> The big question is, where do some of you go to be safe?

You can't be yourself there.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Uh, I don't think Jessica Burns felt safe here.<eos> Tell me why.<eos> Um, maybe she didn't have that person, that best friend to make her feel safe or make her feel comfortable and accepted.<eos> So if you could change the outcome, then what could you have done?<eos> Because that... that sometimes is where it all falls back.<eos> What could we all do?<eos> Be there for her?<eos> I have something... that I want to show you guys.
OK, you all stand right next to me whenever we talk to Jessica.<eos> Is it harassment?<eos> Is it... harassment?<eos> No, so why don't we just drop it?<eos> You're really trying to this!<eos> It's not!<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's not harassment.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Thank you. Thank you guys so much for starting all this bullshit!
All right, let's break it up!<eos> No hanging around in the corridor!<eos> Sports Club. Fencing on Saturdays.<eos> I want you all to come over here.<eos> Form three... four lines.<eos> Make sure you have space around you.<eos> Just form four lines.<eos> One behind the other.<eos> My name is Endel Nelis.<eos> Some of you know me already.
I want you all to come over here.<eos> Form three... four lines.<eos> Make sure you have space around you.<eos> Just form four lines.<eos> One behind the other.<eos> My name is Endel Nelis.<eos> Some of you know me already.<eos> Be quiet when I'm talking.<eos> Hands out of your pockets.<eos> I will try to teach you how to fence.
Bye, darling.<eos> Practically the same thing.<eos> Shall we go up?<eos> She checked out, sir.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Mrs. Greenslade checked out earlier, sir.<eos> Did she say where she was going?<eos> Not to me, sir.<eos> Very, very sorry. Okay.<eos> I tell you, he turned white as a sheet.
A bride as radiant as this one deserves a more splendid setting for her wedding party and I have just the place.<eos> Please, step into Vikram's beautiful minibus. And for those who are less close to it, or just move slower you may use either of his cousin's and together we shall ride to my new hotel!<eos> - Don't look at me. - No, no, no.<eos> Don't look at him.<eos> Although, as the future unfolds, perhaps we will also take the Supreme Quality Hotel under our wing and my old friend Kushal shall find himself working but a short distance beneath me such is the level of my victorious magnanimity.<eos> But for now, to your chariots!<eos> And let us travel to the new jewel in my crown!<eos> The apple of my eye!<eos> Let us travel to the pearl in my oyster!<eos> No longer the Viceroy Club but my gift on her wedding day to the girl of my dreams, where I will welcome you.
- And now... - ...they can take flight together.<eos> Read this.<eos> ...and as they embark on this...<eos> Vegetarian, non-vegetarian journey, yeah journey on which we send them with all our love and, and, and tremendous you know not obviously...<eos> This is what the the young...<eos> This is what the young make us remember...<eos> For this is what the young make us remember that in the end that in the end, it's all very simple that all it takes is to look into someone's eyes and say..."Yes...<eos> ... "this is what I want."<eos> And for them to reply "It's what I want, too "and there's nothing to be afraid of."<eos> Evelyn and I would like to wish the two of you all the love and luck in the world.
Thank you, Mrs. Donnelly.<eos> I know you'll understand me missing the reception and I hope you'll forgive me for not coming to say goodbye.<eos> Go and have the honeymoon you deserve.<eos> I'm sure there'll be somebody there to see you off.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There is no such thing as an ending.<eos> Just a place where you leave the story.<eos> And it's your story now.<eos> I spent 40 years scrubbing floors and the last months of my life as co-manager of a hotel halfway across the world.<eos> You have no idea now what you will become.
-It's like they don't recognize you anymore.<eos> -Thank you. Yes.<eos> [WHISPERING] Alissa!<eos> Hey!<eos> It's me, James.<eos> I know.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why do you look like that?<eos> Just eat your fucking salads.<eos> I'll fucking kill you if you say anything.
-No.<eos> So let's let that go.<eos> You remember. You know.<eos> With what Ricky did and the ticket and you freaked out and Darnell took control of the situation.<eos> - Stop.<eos> -Is this motherfucking"?<eos> Boyz n the Hood, man. [ALL LAUGHING]<eos> - This is a bad time.<eos> RUSSELL:<eos> Okay, I tell you what, man.

Yeah.<eos> - You all right?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> You know what?<eos> I got something I wanna say to y'all since I'm guessing this is the first time that you've ever been forced to listen to a black man.<eos> You know, maybe you guys should just calm the fuck down.<eos> Black people ain't trying to hurt you!
Give me the gun.<eos> I think you have the safety on.<eos> Shit!<eos> OW.<eos> Ugh.<eos> See?<eos> Safety's on.<eos> Safety off.<eos> Martin was right. You are a lucky little shit.<eos> Don't give me reason to find you again. Either of you.
-Shoot her.<eos> Shoot her.<eos> You need to shoot that bitch anyway.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> You're wasting time. Police'll be here any second.<eos> That's right.<eos> We're talking the real police.<eos> The ones that's gonna come here on boats with sirens on them that's got dogs that can swim.<eos> Let me tell you something about swimming dogs.<eos> Now, let me tell you, you're gonna bullshit a bullshitter just make the bullshit plausible.
So I've been suggesting games that are closer to my personal interests.<eos> What interests are you referring to?<eos> Mostly World War ll.<eos> I see.<eos> So you've been playing war games?<eos> Yes.<eos> And some moms and dads as well.<eos> Alright everyone, let's get started.<eos> Find yourselves a good spot on the floor.<eos> Try to make sure you have enough space between you.
Hey, buddy.<eos> You okay, there?<eos> You look a little down.<eos> Are you still shaking off that hangover from the bachelor party?<eos> That's nice.<eos> Oh, my god, She's fucking begging for it!<eos> She's totally begging, get it, get in there.<eos> Look at her. She wants it bad!<eos> Oh, yeah. She wants more than just a fucking pizza delivery, huh?<eos> That's bigger than the average bear right there, I tell you.
I'm not gonna remember a movie I've never seen just because you're singing a song I don't know.<eos> You don't know Samuel L. Jackson, you don't know Rocky.<eos> You are literally pop culture illiterate.<eos> I have a college degree.<eos> My pop culture references are Hamlet, Achilles and Dorian Gray.<eos> Ever heard of any of them?<eos> No, but I'm pretty sure Mr. T could kick their ass!<eos> Yeah, Sam, you really need to be educated.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Um, can either of you tell me who wrote The Great Gatsby?
I'm sorry, I, uh...<eos> You better be planning on buying that!<eos> He just reminds me of when I was a kid.<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> $40.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have $40, here.<eos> You see him anywhere?<eos> No, Let's try in there.<eos> Hi, have any of you guys seen a talking teddy bear run through here?
We did it, guys!<eos> We got to the crossroads!<eos> Our competitors, Lycos and GeoCities, are crushing us.<eos> Those guys are fucking nerds, Brad.<eos> What about Yahoo, huh?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Yahoo?<eos> What's Yahoo?<eos> Exactly.<eos> As your head of RD, I have to tell you that Lougle cannot continue down this path.
I owe you 50 bucks.<eos> Hey, lick my pussy.<eos> Just kidding, guys.<eos> I'm up here.<eos> What's up?<eos> What are you doing up there?<eos> Why are you down there, stupid fuck?<eos> You guys, last night, my eyes<eos> -opened. -Okay.<eos> I'm telling you, you guys, you got to get up here.
He could lose an arm! That happened last week.<eos> Swallow a watch!<eos> Can you swallow a watch, Nick?<eos> I hope not.<eos> Fuck a dude!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Okay!<eos> Say some more stuff!<eos> Say something else!<eos> Now, remember, folks, when you see something you like, you make your selection, and it'll show up here on the board.
No, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> I know how this looks.<eos> No. You don't.<eos> You see my son?<eos> Do you know my son?<eos> Jacob!<eos> Has anybody seen a grown-up Garbage Pail Kid?<eos> There's Winkle.<eos> I pay you girls to like me.
The man who will apparently do anything to keep his shitty career going.<eos> Meanwhile, when's the last time I shared a romantic dinner with my Wife?<eos> Or just did anything, just the two of us?<eos> It's been a minute.<eos> I'll bet there's a lot of people here tonight who have been taken for granted.<eos> This lady right here.<eos> When's the last time your man gave you flowers, just because?<eos> Fuck you, dude.<eos> Right?<eos> On this special occasion, be thankful for the one you're with.
His hair's breathtaking.<eos> He looks like Cap'n Crunch fucked Paul Revere.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why did Lou kill Lou?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Believe me, I did us all a favor.<eos> This one was bad.<eos> Okay. The bigger question is, how did you kill the other you?<eos> That's not the only me.<eos> You think you're the only you?
- Have you heard from Synne or Frank?<eos> -Live, look at this.<eos> What is that?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> -To Karl. Just keep on working.<eos> Frank!<eos> Synne?<eos> Synne, do you read me?<eos> Frank?<eos> Want us to come and get you?
To the basement.<eos> Stay here, in case they show up.<eos> Someone sliced open the man in the stairwell.<eos> That's a police case, Even. Drop it.<eos> If Frank had made that call, help would have arrived by now.<eos> Make the call if I'm not back within 20 minutes.<eos> But not before, OK?<eos> It's your responsibility now.<eos> I put my faith in you, Even.<eos> Synne and Frank, I'm on my way down to you now.
But above all... through heartlessness.<eos> Going with a Nazi to make us half-Nazis! Yes.<eos> But you came with me to save Alphonse's honour.<eos> You loved our mother.<eos> You have a heart.<eos> And a lot of courage, to say that.<eos> I agree.<eos> Now I love you completely, Grandma.<eos> Thank you, dear children.<eos> Thanks to you, I feel light.
It's just as well.<eos> I don't want him to know.<eos> It's humiliating enough, him showing off with Rachida.<eos> I don't want him sorry for me.<eos> Home already?<eos> - You OK?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We must talk to the kids.<eos> Children,<eos> Mum and I have something to tell you.
I'm naked!<eos> You're just a puppet, Victor Mayence!<eos> A poor idiot in love with a woman who laughs at him!<eos> Marianne, I love you!<eos> I love you.<eos> Stop it, you'll catch cold.<eos> Champagne.<eos> You're making a huge mistake.<eos> Just let her screw, OK?<eos> Go away or I'll murder you.
- Come on, we're late.<eos> - Your ex-wife?<eos> Why?<eos> - For support.<eos> - To witness your triumph.<eos> All of us are here.<eos> I'm off.<eos> I won't spoil it.<eos> The perfect couple.<eos> I wish you every happiness.
You're a nice girl.<eos> You'll find a good husband.<eos> I'm already engaged.<eos> To David, an Irish man.<eos> - Is he serious?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's a preacher.<eos> I'm going to Dublin to meet his family, but...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I want to stay with you.
Not this time, sweetheart.<eos> I'm bored!<eos> How could she bring a Nazi into the family and give this poor child a monstrous father?<eos> Have you no morals?<eos> Thanks, Alphonse.<eos> Franz was a soldier like you, Dad.<eos> He wanted to be a vet.<eos> Hitler also loved animals.<eos> What about all those he killed?<eos> Who are you to judge?
Maybe you're trying not to fall for her by fantasizing about incest?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Playing cat and mouse?<eos> Her hold on me is that, to reach the mother, I depend on the daughter.<eos> I'll play her game.<eos> She'll see who's more cunning.<eos> I'll give you some pills to calm this painful obsession.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're here!<eos> Oh no. I told you I didn't want any fuss.
Thank you.<eos> We're here!<eos> Oh no. I told you I didn't want any fuss.<eos> I wrote a speech, but it's rubbish.<eos> I promised not to cry.<eos> "Marianne, on your last day..."<eos> Shucks!<eos> We love you! That's it!<eos> Champagne!<eos> Thank you all.
- You declared me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So you'd be an Elbert and get this house.<eos> So the husband shot you like a rabbit, and sent me to an orphanage.<eos> To lead the life of a bastard, ward of the state!<eos> Grandma...<eos> He was 20. He meant well.<eos> He made me a bastard!<eos> I was disgraced by this kid who screwed his superior's wife!<eos> I apologize to you all.
Where are you off?<eos> Very flashy.<eos> You're after a woman.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> It's so he looks like a modern politician.<eos> I need a hat.<eos> I can't go out bare-headed.<eos> Dad's clothes.<eos> I called to ask him, but he's always on voicemail...<eos> That's what I came to tell you.
I'll be there.<eos> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.<eos> I know I don't have to tell you this, but we need a good one tonight. More than ever.
Let's give 100% out there.<eos> All right, let's do this!<eos> Give us a kiss.<eos> Look, Paul, I know I said two weeks, but I'm telling you, this band is on the verge.<eos> After tonight's gig, the money is going to start pouring in.<eos> No, I'm not a thief.<eos> I just need a little bit more time.<eos> In my flat?<eos> To cut my hands off? My balls?<eos> We are the Yellow Blackguards and we bring you love!
Fuck you talking about, other planets?<eos> There's only one planet.<eos> Planet Earth.<eos> Here.<eos> Look.<eos> Yeah, but you're not seeing the opportunity for creative expression.<eos> You don't understand what I can do with the colors.<eos> It's not that I don't understand, it's that I don't give a fuck.<eos> Look, I have been working for you all night.<eos> You're going to like it.
To put it simply, guys, human beings simply aren't built to function at the cruising altitude of a 747.<eos> Okay, once we get above here, above the South Col our bodies will be literally dying. And I mean literally dying.<eos> It's not called the Death Zone for nothing, guys.<eos> So the game is, can we get you up to the top and down to the bottom before that happens?<eos> - You sure can. - Oh!<eos> Beck Weathers, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> You might have noticed a bit of the Lone Star State?<eos> 100% Texan right here, people. 100% Texan.<eos> You've met Mike Groom.<eos> I'd like to introduce you to Andy Harris.
They were gonna send a journalist up the hill and asked me if I was interested.<eos> It was his call in the end.<eos> All right, Caroline MacKenzie, team doctor.<eos> Why don't you kick it off, Caro.<eos> - Hi, everyone.<eos> - Hey, Caro.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's fine.<eos> So Rob and Harold and Mike will tell you all sorts of stuff about mountaineering, but from a medical standpoint getting you to the top of Everest is really about oxygen.
Yeah, but Anatoli, you're guiding for Scott this year.<eos> You have people's lives in your hands.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Never used it. Never will.<eos> Bigger problems if you run out.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll put some more bottles of O up there.<eos> All right, that'll be good.<eos> All right.<eos> Just so long as you guys are clear.
I'm gonna drop back with Frank, he's struggling a bit, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Straight down.<eos> Let's get him on the oxygen.<eos> Rob Hall to Scott Fischer, Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,<eos> Mountain Madness, how do you copy?<eos> Hey, man!<eos> Scott, here.<eos> I've been down to Base Camp, and I'm back at Camp One.<eos> I'm gonna catch you tomorrow.
Yeah, ring Jan and tell her that we're heading out.<eos> I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours when we get to the summit.<eos> Turnaround's 2:00 p.m.<eos> Good luck, and Godspeed to you all.<eos> Okay, thanks, Helen.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> I'll see you guys up there.<eos> - Take it easy, Scott.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> Gonna get a couple hours of sleep, and I'll be right behind you.
I'm cold.<eos> Mike, Harold, Ang Dorjee, put the brakes on, guys, we got a problem.<eos> We're out of gas, Doug.<eos> We're out of gas.<eos> Need to keep moving, come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> Mike, Harold, do you copy?<eos> I need someone.<eos> I need someone to come back up with oxygen, over.<eos> Somebody, please, I'm begging you.
Ang Dorjee stashed four bottles there, Harold.<eos> Harold, where are you?<eos> Can you hear me, Harold?<eos> Harold!<eos> Harold, can you hear me?<eos> Think it'll take me about half an hour to get back up to the South Summit.<eos> Okay, I'm coming.<eos> If you don't have oxygen, mate, don't come up, don't come up.<eos> We're moving on.<eos> I'm coming up to you, Rob.
It won't go, it's frozen!<eos> Take this.<eos> The glove.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Come on, mate.<eos> Come on, Harold.<eos> Thanks for coming back.<eos> Hello, Base Camp.<eos> Helen, it's Jan.<eos> Why haven't I heard from you?
What if there's like a nuclear bomb down there? Chemicals and shit.<eos> Could they want that? (COUGHING IN THE DISTANCE)<eos> Let's ask him.<eos> Hang in there, Sully. You're gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> (GROANING)<eos> (SCREAMS) DAVID:<eos> Who are you? What do you want?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> They're coming for you guys. You don't stand a chance.
Empty your pocket.<eos> Just do it, Scott.<eos> There's nothing in my...<eos> Okay.<eos> This isn't mine. This isn't my fucking phone.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - That's not my phone!<eos> He's been sending them information.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Gina, he was with you guys when you made the call.
- Go ahead.<eos> SOLDIER: That's a negative on the gas.<eos> (IMITATES GUNSHOTS)<eos> Antifreeze.<eos> Alpha team is ready to engage, waiting on Bravo.<eos> Okay. They are in position.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> David, slow down!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I can help you guys out there.
That's a long story.<eos> Come on.<eos> - (GROANING) - (COUGHING)<eos> Brody.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Fuck, those things hurt almost as much as the real thing.<eos> Why were you trying to hide this thing?<eos> What? I didn't wanna get shot in the knee caps.<eos> Oh, don't shoot! Don't shoot!<eos> I'm so glad you guys are okay.
Come on ... we are looking for Lily.<eos> We build the camp again.<eos> - There is no longer camp.<eos> You are cut down, I ran away.<eos> There is nothing more.<eos> Monsters are on the hunt.<eos> Come on!<eos> We hunt monsters.<eos> You too!<eos> I bring you past the dog ...
Monsters are on the hunt.<eos> Come on!<eos> We hunt monsters.<eos> You too!<eos> I bring you past the dog ...<eos> but that was it!<eos> Attention!<eos> The Chain!<eos> Come on nothing!<eos> Here you can kill almost everything.
To kill a monster, you have to be a monster.<eos> I'm a monster.<eos> All of these monsters ... were children.<eos> What have I done?<eos> Rusty?<eos> In order to survive in a world full of monsters ... You have to be a monster.<eos> You can stop this.<eos> The pain, the suffering.<eos> Drinking!<eos> When I connect to you ... I'm as good as dead.
You do whatever it is you gotta do.<eos> When you find that sumbitch, just do me one favor.<eos> What's that?<eos> Don't miss.<eos> Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando.<eos> I hope it's not a problem.<eos> Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days.<eos> That was a problem.<eos> Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic, that is vacation.<eos> Anyone messes with you here, they mess with the entire country.
What are you, in the fourth grade?<eos> Man, can you just get out of there?<eos> I mean, it's a free market.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Rock, paper, scissors for her.<eos> Are you guys for real right now?<eos> Look at you.<eos> You both look whupped already.<eos> You got stalker eyes.
- Shit!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> - Got it!<eos> - Get out!<eos> Still miss the bullets, Brian?<eos> - Ah! There they are.<eos> Disaster.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I get you an invite to the most exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.
You got one minute. 60 seconds.<eos> My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay?<eos> Precious and short.<eos> I need really great ideas.<eos> Snoop is coming!<eos> Oh. Sorry, my boobs are all crazy.<eos> I was just jumping.<eos> I just came from auditions.<eos> You guys weren't there.<eos> I was hoping for the chance to sing for you.
Man, they massive!<eos> How are we gonna compete with a group that size?<eos> They're so freakin' in sync.<eos> Do we clap? Do we clap? Do we clap?<eos> Politely clap.<eos> Barden Bellas.<eos> You came here to see us?<eos> Is it because you are... What do the American kids say, "Jelly"?<eos> We are so not "jelly."<eos> We should really thank you for making this tour a reality, you know, with your bumbling ineptitude.
Barden Bellas.<eos> You came here to see us?<eos> Is it because you are... What do the American kids say, "Jelly"?<eos> We are so not "jelly."<eos> We should really thank you for making this tour a reality, you know, with your bumbling ineptitude.<eos> We should send them something.<eos> Fruit basket?<eos> Yum, yum.<eos> Or would you prefer mini-muffins?<eos> Okay, we didn't come here to start something with you guys.
Anyone else scared?<eos> Not really.<eos> I already lived longer than I expected.<eos> Password.<eos> Fart noise.<eos> Did you not see the parentheses?<eos> Bellas!<eos> I'm so glad you all came.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Standing in front of you, ladies, happens to be the world's biggest a cappella fan.
I was going there anyway. I was going there anyway.<eos> I know Clay Matthews wants it.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, let's get this thing started.<eos> Let's take a look at the first category.<eos> Ooh. Songs about butts.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Anything on the radio, basically, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Think about what you're gonna sing.
Oh! Oh, oh! I am all about this!<eos> Nobody in this room has loved more tender than I have.<eos> Please pick us.<eos> Let me have it.<eos> - Let us have it.<eos> Let the world have it.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I would give it to him.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Well, why don't we start with you?
Let's see what the next category is!<eos> Oh.<eos> Yes! Oh!<eos> Oh, I was his personal assistant!<eos> - Unfair!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yes, yep.<eos> - We got this.<eos> Yeah, we got this. Get in there.<eos> Okay, then why don't we start with you, Das Sound Machine?
They are an embarrassment to a cappella and all that it stands for.<eos> This is what happens when you send girls to college.<eos> Is it?<eos> Is that for a class?<eos> No, it's just when I get stressed, words sort of flow right out of me and I try and channel them in my songwriting...<eos> Are we just gonna ignore what happened back there?<eos> Guys, hello?<eos> The Worlds are right around the corner and you guys are acting like we didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!<eos> Why are you yelling at me?<eos> I almost burned to death because of you a-ca-bitches.
And guess what?<eos> Boobs should never be trapped!<eos> Unless it's for support if you have lower back issues.<eos> Okay!<eos> If I'm about to die, I'm sorry!<eos> I didn't mean any of that stuff I said!<eos> I love all of you! I love all of you awesome nerds, and I love being a Bella. I'm just so stressed out right now...<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, my gosh!<eos> Jessica and Ashley, I don't actually know which one of you is which.
I don't wanna fail.<eos> But if you just would have said something...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But I'm weird about that stuff.<eos> I thought I could figure it out on my own, and I can't.<eos> Maybe I don't have anything original to say.<eos> I wish I could do what you do.<eos> Well, I feel the same way about you.<eos> You're so good, it's intimidating.<eos> All I've ever wanted is to be one of you.
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter.<eos> Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear things that do sound so fair?<eos> My noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope that he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.<eos> Hail, lesser than Macbeth and greater.<eos> Not so happy yet much happier.<eos> Thou shalt get kings though thou be none.<eos> So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.<eos> 'Banquo and Macbeth, 'all hail.'<eos> Stay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more.<eos> Say from whence you owe this strange intelligence and why, upon this blasted heath, you stop our way with such prophetic greeting.
To the selfsame tune and words.<eos> The King hath happily received, Macbeth, the news of thy success.<eos> As thick as hail came post from post and every one did bear thy praises, in his kingdom's great defence, and poured them down before him.<eos> And we are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks.<eos> And, for an earnest of a greater honour, he bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor.<eos> The Thane of Cawdor lives.<eos> Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?<eos> Treasons capital, confessed and proved, have overthrown him.<eos> Do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me promised no less to them?<eos> That trusted home might yet enkindle you unto the crown besides the Thane of Cawdor.
We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.<eos> We hear our bloody cousin is bestowed in England, not confessing his cruel parricide, filling his hearers with strange invention.<eos> But of that tomorrow.<eos> Hie you to horse.<eos> Adieu, till you return at night.<eos> Goes Fleance with you?
We hear our bloody cousin is bestowed in England, not confessing his cruel parricide, filling his hearers with strange invention.<eos> But of that tomorrow.<eos> Hie you to horse.<eos> Adieu, till you return at night.<eos> Goes Fleance with you?<eos> Ay, my good Lord.<eos> Our time does call upon's.<eos> Farewell.<eos> Within this hour, at most,<eos> I will advise you where to plant yourselves, acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time the moment on't, for it must be done tonight, and something from the palace.
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in to saucy doubts and fears.<eos> My royal Lord, you do not give the cheer.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Sweet remembrancer!<eos> Now, good digestion wait on appetite and health on both.<eos> Here had we now our country's honour roofed, were the graced person of our Banquo present,<eos> who may I rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance.<eos> His absence, sir, lays blame upon his promise.<eos> What is't that moves Your Highness?<eos> - Which of you have done this?
O proper stuff!<eos> Prithee, see there.<eos> Behold.<eos> Look, lo!<eos> How say you?<eos> This is the very painting of your fear.<eos> This is the air-drawn dagger which you said led you to Duncan.<eos> Why do you make such faces?<eos> If I stand here, I saw him.<eos> My worthy Lord, your noble friends do lack you.
Not bad.<eos> But did you really kick the water or only think you did?<eos> Come on, somebody are fighting.<eos> Fight!<eos> Fight! Come on.<eos> Cheung Fong of Wing Chun.<eos> Ip Ching of Wing Chun.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop fighting.<eos> I told you two not to fight.
Tell me what went on today.<eos> The kids were naughty and fought.<eos> They'll learn in time.<eos> Come here, Ah Ching.<eos> Disciple. Aren't you going to apologise?<eos> Ah Ching is at fault too.<eos> Ip Ching, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Cheung Fong.<eos> Shake hands.<eos> Now you're friends.
But it's late.<eos> You should rest.<eos> I'll see you off.<eos> Master.<eos> Uncle Ip has a wooden man too.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uncle Ip is very famous.<eos> But one day I'll be more famous.<eos> Which of you is better at kungfu?
Soon, we'll be sisters.<eos> As you know this is pledge week and these pathetic losers are what's left of the even more pathetic losers who rushed our hallowed sorority,<eos> Tau Omega Sigma. We are the beginning and the end.<eos> The beginning and the end.<eos> These girls are the last three, but to be one of us they have to go through a final trial.<eos> Girls.<eos> Are you stupid bitches or are you TOS wolves?<eos> It's time for the wrestling match.<eos> Grease those pigs up!<eos> Can't hear you!
Now you have the keys. All right?<eos> Now when you get out go and get some help.<eos> No, you can't leave me here. Not with those things running around.<eos> This will be the safest place for you, Stephanie.<eos> You heard the Warden.<eos> We need to move fast and you're injured.<eos> No.<eos> You need to stay still.<eos> It'll help with the blood loss. I'll be okay.<eos> I want to go with you.
RUN!<eos> Come on! Hurry!<eos> I'm trying. I don't know which one.<eos> OPEN IT!<eos> OPEN THE DOOR!<eos> Come on. You're not going to let me die like this, are you?<eos> Eaten by a friggin dinosaur.<eos> I've known men like you.<eos> Small on the inside and no matter how many people they hurt they always stay that small.<eos> I'll tell you what.
He was lying.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But if I had thrown it in there it would have still been very unpleasant.<eos> Where you two little wolflings going?<eos> Come here. Give daddy wolf some love.<eos> Oh, gross.<eos> Why can't you just leave us alone?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> All I want is a kiss.<eos> From each of you.
Tris, you can't just go around killing people.<eos> No, she's right.<eos> Listen to your sister.<eos> Tris, I think you should go to Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself.<eos> I'll stay with Caleb so that you don't get him killed, too.<eos> What?<eos> Come on, you know.<eos> Like you did your parents.<eos> Come on!<eos> What do you think you're doing?
Of course you are.<eos> You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.<eos> Deadly.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Ask him.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not coming with you guys. What?
Deadly.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Ask him.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not coming with you guys. What?<eos> To Candor.<eos> I'm not coming with you guys.
Wait! No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Initializing message.<eos> Hello.<eos> I come from outside the wall.<eos> Where we have all but destroyed each other.<eos> We designed your city as an experiment.<eos> We believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.<eos> And we created factions to ensure peace.<eos> But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions.
I come from outside the wall.<eos> Where we have all but destroyed each other.<eos> We designed your city as an experiment.<eos> We believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.<eos> And we created factions to ensure peace.<eos> But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions.<eos> These will be the Divergent.<eos> They are the true purpose of this experiment.<eos> They are vital to humanity's survival.<eos> If you're watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded.
When that message gets out, it'll be the end.<eos> What message?<eos> You'll see.<eos> I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.<eos> We have separated you from the rest of us.<eos> And we created factions to ensure peace.<eos> The time has come to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.<eos> We've allowed you to believe that you're the last of us.<eos> But you're not.<eos> If you're watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded.
Is he sick<eos> He is punishing me<eos> Yang Ke<eos> Look<eos> Behind this mountain it is the Swan Lake<eos> This is the place I told you about that looks like heaven<eos> Look look at the swans There, do you see it<eos> Here come the nomads<eos> Welcome<eos> I didn't think you would come here, too
What does it say?<eos> Read it.<eos> He's left you everything.<eos> It's all yours.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Take care, you hear.<eos> Walk on.<eos> Bye.<eos> So who will join us, lads?<eos> Which one of you fine boys will put on the scarlet uniform and proudly serve his Queen and country?
Are you sure?<eos> How does this sound?<eos> Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.<eos> All right?<eos> Walk on.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> A short time ago, I had the privilege and the simple fortune of meeting this angel.<eos> Your mistress.<eos> And now I stand before you her husband, your master, and the proudest man you will ever see.
You've certainly seen it all.<eos> What were you thinking? Say it! You may have seen.<eos> I do not answer for each orphan disappeared in the night.<eos> Not responding.<eos> No.<eos> This is just awful!<eos> Getting worse all day have removed the dirt from her.<eos> The purple is beautiful.<eos> Resolved.<eos> How do you want, Countess! I want!
They were acting so weird when I asked for it.<eos> Books kept under lock? -Yes!<eos> I'm supposed to come in on the top floor keep?<eos> I to open the lock?<eos> I will not stay until winter.<eos> It is better to die in the woods, but live here.<eos> Stop! But it's true!<eos> Where's Arpad?<eos> Escaped is likely.<eos> You too.
Needs my head or wants to throw me in jail? Did not bring any new, not even a big deal.<eos> Will you stand before the court.<eos> To raise charges against you.<eos> Murder.<eos> Who? Needless're chatted in the presence of the king?<eos> I delivered to you as needed.<eos> But besides're loyal to their king.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Despite your of silence and dedication, wants court proceedings?<eos> Do you realize that any appreciation and can you fix it?
I was disembodied.<eos> Point in all that we do not hurt you with their knives.<eos> I was in the river...<eos> Then goruæeg star shine.<eos> I walked deeper into the woods.<eos> And I still go, so the stone was more difficult on you.<eos> For me? -Yes.<eos> There was a rock at you.<eos> Yes, you could not move.<eos> They emanated rays to you.
You can go back to that, just not now, okay?<eos> I want you guys to have a few years of being normal kids.<eos> But we're not normal kids, Dave.<eos> Yeah... we're multi-platinum singing chipmunks! Oops.<eos> Well, right now, you're acting like a bunch of animals... who just threw a giant house party without my permission.<eos> Does this mean no miniature golf tomorrow?<eos> It should, and normally, it would.<eos> But, you're gonna give us one last chance, right?<eos> I think he means our 158th last chance?<eos> Look, selfishly, I wanna spend as much time with you guys as I can... before I have to go to Ashley's album release in Miami.
Good luck!<eos> You kind of hope your heart surgeon doesn't need luck.<eos> ... Have fun!<eos> Nailed it!<eos> Look, paparazzi.<eos> I guess they heard we were coming.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> It is good to see you.<eos> Can you get one more from this side? Yeah.<eos> Guys, they aren't here for you, come on.
We... just wanted to spend as much time as possible with you before you left for Miami.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll make breakfast.<eos> I love breakfast.<eos> Alvin, grab it.<eos> Ooh, ooh, Belgian waffles, pancakes.<eos> So excited.<eos> Okay, guys--<eos> Miss Price from next door, she's gonna peek in on you... make sure you're all right.
Make yourself at home.<eos> Thank you, David, that's very generous of you to open your home.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's really impressive.<eos> I actually don't speak Spanish.<eos> He said that it's very generous of you to open your home.<eos> I also speak Spanish.<eos> And you're not fooling anyone with your good boy routine.<eos> I'm fooling everyone.<eos> They have no idea that I'm going to make you my personal servant.
I don't wanna go to jail. I don't wanna go to jail!<eos> That's not mine.<eos> You just holding it for a friend?<eos> No, no, not that, not that.<eos> I don't get paid enough.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Real smooth, Simon.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I just, I got so nervous.<eos> You are lucky I don't flush the both of you down the toilet!
I've got a meeting with Homeland Security next week about a promotion.<eos> Another congratulations, sir.<eos> Shut up!<eos> What do you think they're gonna bring up when they interview me?<eos> My decade of perfect service... or that one time that three chipmunks turned my flight into Noah's Ark?<eos> Probably the time with the chipmunks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, I meant the other one.<eos> Look, sir, what could we possibly have done to make you hate us so much?<eos> I'll tell you what you did.
Just like a guinea pig Armageddon!<eos> Well, thanks for checking on them, Miss Price.<eos> False alarm.<eos> Soundsfike they're having a blast. Good.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, Alvin, I think maybe we should go somewhere else.<eos> Whoa, hey. Sorry, fellas. 21 and over.<eos> But it's dark outside, and we don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> Well, I wish I could help you out, but I got a bar packed with people... waiting to hear a band whose singer is stuck 50 miles from here with a flat tire.
I hope he gets home safe.<eos> I got a splinter in my tail.<eos> I can't sleep without my pillow.<eos> I don't suppose they make Tempur-Pedic tree branches, do they?<eos> Seriously, guys?<eos> You're the ones who are supposed to be comfortable sleeping in trees, not me.<eos> We're not talking to you, okay?<eos> Not after you tried to leave me behind!<eos> First, awesome, because<eos> I don't wanna talk to you either.
Man.<eos> Right.<eos> Whoopsies.<eos> That.<eos> Guys.<eos> Nuts.<eos> Seriously, guys, the No-Fly List?<eos> At least we're not on the No-Drive List.<eos> There's no such thing as a No-Drive List, Theodore.<eos> I'm sure you guys will find a way to start one.
Guys.<eos> Nuts.<eos> Seriously, guys, the No-Fly List?<eos> At least we're not on the No-Drive List.<eos> There's no such thing as a No-Drive List, Theodore.<eos> I'm sure you guys will find a way to start one.<eos> Let's not overreact, Dave.<eos> The only reason we left home in the first place...<eos> Guys, not now, okay?<eos> I worked my butt off on Ashley's album, and because of you three... I might not even get to the record release!
Theodore, you saved my life.<eos> Like we always say, you mess with one of us...<eos> Don't make me say it, man, it's so lame.<eos> Miles, he got hit by a car for you.<eos> You mess with all of us.<eos> All right!<eos> Ouch! Miles, we are so sorry.<eos> We haven't been fair to you from day one.<eos> And the truth is... you'd make a great brother.<eos> I feel the same about you guys.
Run, run!<eos> Hurry, hurry!<eos> He's coming!<eos> Hurry, Alvin. Hit the button!<eos> Come on, Alvin!<eos> Hurry, hurry!<eos> Here's Suggsy!<eos> He's like the Terminator! Yeah!<eos> This is ironic.<eos> We're gonna be going up... but I'm taking you boys down.

I'm gonna pay someone to have you stuffed.<eos> Right.<eos> And I'm gonna give you as a gift to Anna, who will hopefully take me back.
Wow.<eos> Whoo!<eos> I love you, Dave!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nailed it.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you, my 990N9-<eos> We still got it.<eos> Whoo! Girls, thank you.<eos> We owe you one.
And I promise to be a better dad from here on out.<eos> What are you talking about, Dave?<eos> You're the best dad we could ever have.<eos> What do you say to a little family dinner when we get home?<eos> You know, so we know where our kids are the entire time we're together?<eos> That sounds perfect.<eos> Whoo-hoo! We rocked it!<eos> Simon, did you see me?<eos> I was on fire!<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, but I had fun getting in trouble with you guys.
What about my mother?<eos> - Drakan will kill her.<eos> - We can't do anything about it.<eos> Save yourself, Dina.<eos> Off you go.<eos> I won't go without Mother.<eos> Go now!<eos> Drakan will kill you!<eos> - Not if you help us.<eos> - I can't help you.
Good show, Martland!<eos> Bit redundant, really, as he's dead.<eos> - Alastair, what are you doing here?<eos> - I followed you.<eos> Wouldn't do to have you walking into all this mess on your own, now, would it?<eos> Jock, give me the painting.<eos> - Sit down!<eos> - Drop the knife! I will shoot you.<eos> Yes, most likely by accident.<eos> None of you will ever know what it's like to make love to a man with principles.
I MISS YOU.<eos> I MISS THE KIDS.<eos> JUST PLEASE, CALL ME BACK.<eos> RETURN MY CALLS.<eos> - I LOVE THIS PLACE.<eos> YOU GUYS REMEMBER THE CAMPSITE?<eos> LOOK AT THOSE TREES.<eos> ISN'T THAT PRETTY?<eos> THAT'S THE STREAM, RIGHT OVER THERE.<eos> THAT'S WHERE WE BATHED YOU.
SO HERE WE GO.<eos> ALL RIGHT?<eos> POSSIBLY SAVE YOUR LIFE.<eos> THIS WILL COLLECT THE HEAT DURING THE DAY, AND THEN AT NIGHT, THE GROUND COOLS.<eos> THE TEMPERATURE CONVERSION IN THE MORNING WILL COLLECT THE CONDENSATION AND YOU'LL HAVE WATER.<eos> NOT A LOT OF WATER, BUT A LITTLE.<eos> ENOUGH TO MAYBE MAKE A DIFFERENCE.<eos> WATER TRAP.<eos> - THANK YOU.<eos> - Raven: I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SIGNAL USING GRASS.
- FINNISH ARCHITECT, FOUR LETTER WORD, THIRD LETTER "R."<eos> - EERO...<eos> SAARINEN.<eos> - MY BRILLIANT GIRL.<eos> WHAT WAS THAT?<eos> - A RAVEN.<eos> GRANDPA CHET SAID THEY-- THEY CRY OUT WHEN THEIR NESTS ARE THREATENED.<eos> - THAT IS CREEPY.<eos> - YEAH, OKAY.<eos> WELL, I'M SLEEPING BETWEEN YOU TWO TONIGHT.
- SHE NEVER EVEN ASKED US IF WE WANTED TO COME HERE--<eos> - MAYA, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS!<eos> I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE, YOU KNOW?<eos> Angela: I'M SORRY, KID.<eos> YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS.<eos> Maya: WELL, I MEAN... SHE'S A PAIN, BUTI MEAN, I DON'T THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL.<eos> - Angela: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL?<eos> IF SHE HADN'T TEXTED ME, I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHERE YOU GUYS WERE.<eos> YOU KNOW, IF SHE WEREN'T SO SELFISH, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW.<eos> --JaCk: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS? -Angela:
GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!<eos> JACK!<eos> COME ON!<eos> ALL RIGHT.<eos> IF I LEAVE YOU ALONE HERE... YOU WILL BE SCARED SHITLESS.<eos> - SHOULD WE GO TO HER?<eos> - I DON'T KNOW.<eos> IT'S A TRAIL.<eos> HURRY UP.<eos> - Angela: HOW COULD YOU THINK I WOULD EVER HURT YOU?
JACK!<eos> COME ON!<eos> ALL RIGHT.<eos> IF I LEAVE YOU ALONE HERE... YOU WILL BE SCARED SHITLESS.<eos> - SHOULD WE GO TO HER?<eos> - I DON'T KNOW.<eos> IT'S A TRAIL.<eos> HURRY UP.<eos> - Angela: HOW COULD YOU THINK I WOULD EVER HURT YOU?<eos> I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH!

COME HOME.<eos> -LT'S HOT.<eos> - HEY, LOOK, YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT ON.<eos> COME ON, MAYA, LOOK AT THIS.<eos> - WE'RE OVER HERE.<eos> --JAC K!<eos> STAY TH ERE. I'M COMING TO YOU.

- YOU DID THAT.<eos> YOU DID THAT.<eos> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU ENOUGH.<eos> Jack: BYE, RAVEN.<eos> Maya: THANK YOU.<eos> - YOU'RE WELCOME.<eos> - I CAN'T BELIEVE JACK DIDN'T EAT IT ALL.<eos> - READY?<eos> - ONE MORE MINUTE.<eos> I LOVE YOU GUYS.
- I knew you'd say that.<eos> - Oh, come on. - Alright, alright.<eos> We were set up and look at us now.<eos> Dom, it is like your single years have been completely wiped from your memory.<eos> I mean, do you remember that one girl who just cried?<eos> She cried all the way through giving you a blow job.<eos> She was weeping.<eos> So sad.<eos> And look at you now.<eos> And look at you both. Yeah, really special.
- This is...<eos> - It's Jack!<eos> He's looking for... Who are you looking for again?<eos> Nancy.<eos> Is this a 40th party? Nancy!<eos> Nancy, are you here?<eos> - I'm Nancy.<eos> - I'm Nancy.<eos> I'm Nancy!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, you're not. None of you are Nancy.
Yes!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Oh, we're all going, are we?<eos> OK.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.<eos> I'm just... just gonna say a few words. Er...<eos> Er, I actually had something prepared but...<eos> I lost it. It's kind of a long story...<eos> Actually, I'm just gonna tell you, cos it's actually the reason I was so late and the reason why this speech is gonna be so rubbish.
Big Ben.<eos> Akan is a cock!<eos> Oh ,my.<eos> Looks like Akan's already begun.<eos> By tomorrow, these poor chaps, will be super, robotic soldiers like yourself.<eos> Look out!<eos> What's red and bad for your teeth?<eos> On your feet, lad.<eos> On your left.<eos> I'm gonna buy you some time.
Good luck, man.<eos> ADONIS:<eos> So where are we?<eos> BIANCA:<eos> North Philly.<eos> So this is Max's.<eos> Hey, superstar!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm well, thanks.<eos> How you doing?
And I wanna make it count.<eos> Now, on that note, we would need you to change your name to Creed.<eos> It's just a formality.<eos> And what if I say no?<eos> Well, then there's no fight.<eos> Without the name, there's no fight.<eos> It's a non-starter.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you both take a day, talk about it and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Goodison Park here in Liverpool, England, where tonight this is the main event.<eos> Twelve rounds of boxing for the light heavyweight championship of the world.<eos> For the thousands in attendance and the millions watching around the world, ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble!<eos> In the red corner, wearing the stars and stripes, his professional record, 16 fights 16 victories.<eos> Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!<eos> And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing black with blue with 36 fights, 28 KOs, he's the light heavyweight champion of the world,<eos> "Pretty" Ricky Conlan!<eos> - Okay, let's go.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> How you doing, lads? You know what I expect of you both.
Oh, my God.<eos> Out in the field.<eos> Yeah. With a gun!<eos> What?<eos> "Hi, terrorists.<eos> Oh, golly!<eos> "Oh, I shot myself!<eos> Whoops! "I meant to shoot you, not me!"<eos> That's probably what I'd say.<eos> "Hey, terrorists, you better watch out, "or I'll make you a chocolate cake.
I don't think that's what...<eos> Like a sort of upside down kidney bean.<eos> "This is what I look like when I'm asleep."<eos> Shut up, be quiet.<eos> She won't know who we are.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, Nancy.<eos> Hi, Susan.<eos> Hi!<eos> Look at you two cuties sitting here being all cute.
Oh, dear.<eos> Be prepared for anything.<eos> She's erratic. It's impossible to tell what she's thinking.<eos> Probably because she's thinking in Bulgarian.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm just tying up my shoelaces.<eos> You're wearing a loafer. Get over here.<eos> Get in!<eos> Shit!<eos> People are trying to kill me and all that's left of my fucking security team is you two defending me... and you look like somebody's demented aunts on vacation!
That's Lord Alcaman.<eos> The last king to rule the entire world.<eos> How did he do it?<eos> He must have commanded a large army.<eos> No. He was a sorcerer.<eos> He walked on air, he commanded fire, and he had dark magic.<eos> And the key to his power is painted on the side of an urn.<eos> That urn is now in the hands of a fool.<eos> I'll find Drazen.<eos> I will hunt him down and bring his head to you on a spike.
I'll find Drazen.<eos> I will hunt him down and bring his head to you on a spike.<eos> No. You won't.<eos> Drazen wasn't only a thief. He was also a spy.<eos> Clever enough to fool us both.<eos> He came from the Northern forest.<eos> A kingdom called Norvania.<eos> Your Majesty, give me a dozen men.<eos> I will burn that castle to the ground.<eos> I will bury them under it and bring you the urn.
By getting a foothold into the system of power.<eos> I just couldn't make the full commitment.<eos> Why?<eos> You know, the wedding night commitment?<eos> I couldn't go through with it.<eos> Not with Drazen.<eos> I left him at the altar at our wedding.<eos> Wedding!<eos> Young man.<eos> If you're here to ask for my daughter's hand in marriage, I give you my full blessing.
Well, with the right amount of power, every man is dangerous.<eos> Do you see that, Father?<eos> Those are words of a king.<eos> - I don't want to be king!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I do not. - Yes, you do!<eos> No, in fact, I don't want anything!<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You want to prove that Lord Alcaman, one of the great myths of world history, is nothing but a campfire story.<eos> I'll decipher this, and I will prove to you there is no such thing as magic.
Don't kill me.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> I have a job for you.<eos> And a gold coin if you get it done.<eos> Show me where it is!<eos> You!<eos> Something you wanna tell me?<eos> No, no, no, no. - Let me hear it?<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> I promise you, My Lord.
I love you, too, Valina.<eos> They heard you.<eos> All praise he who speaks to the creatures of the forest.<eos> All praise!<eos> All praise! All praise!<eos> All praise!<eos> Years ago, there was a king who united all the nations of the world under his reign, because he conquered them all.<eos> On the top of that mountain lies a crown that guarantees the power rest with me in Norvania.<eos> I would gladly give my life for Norvania.<eos> And when the time comes, I expect you to do the same.
The crown?<eos> I'm guessing it's in there.<eos> Finally, he made one thing easy to find.<eos> Too bad it won't be yours.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> One step closer, and I'll kill her.<eos> I'm trading up.<eos> Roland, are you insane?<eos> You're outnumbered. Oh, yeah?<eos> Let me introduce you to my friends.
Uh,doessheeat ?<eos> Sheeatscroissants andcrabapples.<eos> She likes things that begin with "C"?<eos> No.<eos> She enjoys espresso.<eos> No collaborating.<eos> Croissants...<eos> She's French.<eos> You need to play more games, Jules.<eos> Only one of you can be the winner.
End call.<eos> - Gwen? - This conversation has ended.<eos> That's your mother?<eos> Yup. She doesn't even look like a mom.<eos> Holo me when you hear from Arcadia?<eos> Tell her about the Eastern Board luncheon.<eos> I'll make sure my mom holds you a spot.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's old looking.<eos> Who was that with you guys?
Someone's got to straighten out your priorities before you squander everything for Jules.<eos> This might be a bigger sacrifice than you imagine.<eos> Gwen, it's not like you're a consciousness in a jar that we're dumping into another jar.<eos> The technology is not there yet.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My marketing characterizes the procedure. It's just that, a consciousness transplant.<eos> That's marketing.<eos> What's the reality then?<eos> In order to reproduce your memories, we have to plant electrodes in your brain. And in the brain of the new host.<eos> We use a semi-separable feedback loop between the two of you, to generate a psycho-physiological twin.

When we went to the DCS show, it was incredible how everyone was so friendly, and so into it, and all the things they do.<eos> I just love that we could be a part of something like that.<eos> With something that's so close to us that brought us together.<eos> It's incredible.<eos> - The wonderful thing about this show is that so many things amazing have happened.<eos> But today, you get to have something that's going to be even more amazing.<eos> There's a young man here that I'm looking for.<eos> His name is nick.<eos> Nick?<eos> Oh, Nick! Nick would like to take a moment with all of you here.
We had a treaty for the tern.<eos> -The situation has changed.<eos> You can't say that now.<eos> -Yes!<eos> No! You can't.<eos> Lower the car or<eos> I'll call the cops.<eos> -Maybe call the whambulance?<eos> Damn nature communists.<eos> There's no living with you.
Who knows who's perfect for what.<eos> I spent so much time counting everybody else's blessings, I don't know that I ever had the opportunity to count them for myself.<eos> Maybe now you'll have some objectivity.<eos> Isn't that... Maybe that's what's happening.<eos> Okay, so look, Jose...<eos> Look, no, no, no, no.<eos> I think she's gonna call.<eos> They always come back.<eos> No, yeah, I know, they always come back, we always split up.<eos> I mean, isn't it possible that some people are just meant to be miserable lonely, old, childless and alone living with you?
Will you please teach me, Daddy, because I'm...<eos> - You know, I hear you.<eos> - Yeah, I know. I said it audibly.<eos> You think it's permanent, Joe?<eos> Don't call me that, please.<eos> - You're not Mexican.<eos> - I'm an eighth.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have to make a confession to you.<eos> - To all of you, actually.
Hey, you know, good for you, right?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You still have daddy issues, is that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, good. All right.<eos> Well, in that case, to a year.<eos> - To coconut water.<eos> - Mother of Christ, really?<eos> Penny and Mark, it's so good to see you kids together again.
- I'd show you. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, thanks for telling me, you know.<eos> - I mean...<eos> All right, all right.<eos> - You're welcome, buddy.<eos> Okay, so you sure there's nothing else of any consequence you're maybe forgetting, omitting?<eos> That honeymoon comment got 31 likes.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You all set?
Buttheonlything Frankwasknee-deepin wasthebabypool.<eos> Hey, what you got there?<eos> SPF 50?<eos> No wonder you two look so young.<eos> You know, if we hooked up, I'd have to turn myself in for statutory rape.<eos> Statutory rape's the not-bad rape.<eos> Hey. No leaving.<eos> butStatenIslandgirls wereneverinterested inmeandFrank.<eos> Theywerealways toobusyfawningover thiskindof guy.<eos> You know, I'm pretty sure you guys are just aiming too high.
Ooh. Staff party.<eos> Uh, Danny's not, 'cause he's going to Orlando to get his vagina enlarged, but I will be there.<eos> Oh! That's cute they invite the baby pool lifeguards.<eos> Oh, it's cute that you exist.<eos> Why can't there just be two of you, Rachel?<eos> Why can't there be zero Franks?<eos> I do everything here, okay?<eos> I'm not a baby pool lifeguard.<eos> I'm a lifeguard who happens to be at the baby pool right now.<eos> Well, it's been great hanging out with you guys.
What's that, Frank? Oh! It's like Whac-A-Mole, but with penises and glory holes.<eos> And you just, like, whack the penis back into the glory hole, so it doesn't...<eos> Doesn't, you know...<eos> I understand.<eos> How's the Disney planning going?<eos> Oh, my God. Dude, do you remember that one time where you did the entire Jungle Cruise and everybody laughed at you because you looked like a fucking moron?<eos> All right, you, I'm gonna go shut that door and open a window.<eos> Maybe knock down a wall.<eos> I just hear the cat kind of screaming a little bit.<eos> Guys, you gotta check this out.
Uh, this is my buddy, Danny.<eos> He's totally cool.<eos> He's my friend.<eos> I feel like these guys are...<eos> Like the gay versions of us?<eos> Fuck, man.<eos> So what's up?<eos> We got a party? You want liquor, I know. I got to ask.<eos> Right?<eos> I'm fucking with you. Always fucking with you.
You think they make enough money to live off of Choco Tacos and Ninja Turtle pops?<eos> All right, guys. Regardless of Frank ruining a kid's life, I got the keys.<eos> Yeah, and Danny, we got them booze.<eos> Yeah, and everyone I know, man, woman, child, homeless man in ski goggles, they're all coming to the party.<eos> Now, we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way.<eos> I saw a little hand reach under my stall.<eos> It was a child's hand.<eos> I don't think it was his.<eos> Who do we got here?<eos> Which one of you is Brian Barr?
We'll see. I only get a plus one.<eos> Yo.<eos> Will Hunting, this is disgusting.<eos> All right. Come on. Quit your dog shopping.<eos> Chuck's at lunch.<eos> It's game time.<eos> All right? I'm out today.<eos> All right, man.<eos> You're gonna miss all the action.<eos> I'm telling you, Osama Bin Laden had this dog.
Hey, wait. What's this I hear about a party tomorrow?<eos> Oh, there's a party at Great Kills.<eos> Bring whoever you want.<eos> Bring your friends. Bring your moms.<eos> Just bring whoever you want.<eos> My man Pixy Stick.<eos> Is that me?<eos> I'm Pixy Stick?<eos> Cool. Pixy Stick.<eos> Out you go.
Come on. We're gonna go for a little ride, Chuck.<eos> Yeah, hop in.<eos> I call shotgun then, all right, boys?<eos> Look at you two. You smell great.<eos> Dad.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Make sure you have her home by midnight.<eos> He's just kidding.<eos> I don't have to be home till 1:00.<eos> Hey, guys, you guys got to see my dick.
It was very fun.<eos> I'm really sorry I missed it.<eos> No, I'm sorry. I overreacted. I just...<eos> All right.<eos> Oh! Oh, my baby.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Are you sure you still want us to drive you up?<eos> 'Cause if you want to go alone, we understand that.<eos> I'd really like you guys to drive me up.
God, grant me patience...<eos> What's this?<eos> -It is a talus bone.<eos> Son, you never give that away.<eos> That means they like you.<eos> Thank you, son.<eos> Those who would like to get married this year, step forward.<eos> When it's work, they avoid it, when it's women, they race each other for it.<eos> I'll show you!<eos> Which one of you is the oldest?
How are you?<eos> How are you?<eos> Very well.<eos> Let me put out the light.<eos> God damn it...<eos> Aziz!<eos> Aziz, where are you going, Aziz?<eos> Celal, how wonderful.<eos> Father!<eos> Aziz is coming after you!
Kids, easy.<eos> Chief, Haydar, thank you for everything.<eos> Come on, Haydar.<eos> Come on, everyone, sit down.<eos> Nice...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Go to your seat.<eos> Alright, children.<eos> This is our first day of class.<eos> But before we start, let me tell you this: I am your teacher.
When the snow comes, the village turns into a prison.<eos> Everybody surrenders to God.<eos> For eight months, we depend on God, for four months, on the government.<eos> If you'd like to write a letter, write it now. It would take eight months to get an answer.<eos> Really?<eos> Then, I'll write a letter right away.<eos> -Godspeed.<eos> He writes beautifully, like a first class civil servant.<eos> Aziz has already started writing.<eos> I could teach you also, if you want, you could write as well.
Father, don't worry about Aziz.<eos> He's doing fine.<eos> Let's get back inside.<eos> It's cold out here.<eos> -Listen to me, son...<eos> -Father?<eos> Some people have eyes in their hearts.<eos> They see the world through those eyes.<eos> They see everything through those eyes.<eos> May God always guide you all towards kind-hearted people.
Dear, go take a seat.<eos> Hazar, what happened?<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No, no. We have dust in our eyes, that's why we're crying.<eos> Mother, I know The Quran, if you are going to ask me about it.<eos> My dear, it's done.<eos> Mother, I know how to cook too.<eos> Would you like me to tell you about it?<eos> Beans, chickpeas, eggplants, baba ghanoush, pickles, casseroles, gumbo, lentils, soups, rice, pasta, stuffed vegetables, zucchini, potatoes,<eos> Mother, ask, and I'll tell you how to make it.
Aziz!<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing. All is well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Aziz is not at school today.<eos> Why?<eos> Father, is he sick or what?<eos> Go and look.<eos> Go get him.<eos> Now, I am going to give you your report cards.
Aziz?<eos> Father!<eos> Father!<eos> Father!<eos> Neither Aziz nor his wife are here.<eos> They left this letter. They are gone.<eos> "Before I start my letter, I greet you all. I give my regards to my elders, my love to the younger ones.<eos> I know, you'll all be sad, but I had to go.<eos> Nobody has ever understood me, listened to me.<eos> Mom, dad, I would have given my all to talk to you, but I couldn't.
Nobody has ever understood me, listened to me.<eos> Mom, dad, I would have given my all to talk to you, but I couldn't.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Everybody in the village mocked me for years for not talking, for being disabled.<eos> It was okay. But now, I'm 31 years old.<eos> I have a wife.<eos> It's too difficult for me to watch the villagers harass my wife.<eos> I'm not leaving for myself, but for my wife.<eos> Maybe they won't make fun of me where I go.<eos> Don't you worry about us.

Don't you worry about us.<eos> I am going to come back one day.<eos> I love you all very much.<eos> Please give me your blessings."<eos> -God bless you.<eos> "Take good care of my horse, and may God take good care of you."<eos> Go on.<eos> I'll be a teacher too when I grow up.<eos> I don't know when I'll be back again.<eos> I won't forget you or all the things you've done for me until the day I die.
I can never find the button.<eos> Squeeze its balls.<eos> I've already tried that.<eos> There it is!<eos> I told you!<eos> Goddammit!<eos> It's broken down, Lobo. Bring the stick that's behind the seat.<eos> Lobo! Go see if there's a mechanic back there.<eos> But quickly!<eos> Any of you know about cars?
You see I am here<eos> His heart's voice<eos> The heart skips a beat<eos> What is a heart?<eos> The heart! The heart!<eos> Disruptive technology A B theeta beeta gaama<eos> Five hundred and seventy-five methods, fester.<eos> He's prepared a play for you<eos> Straight from the heart<eos> Clap if you like it
What if you kill me 'Boom'..<eos> ...and I pee on your shoe.<eos> Ooh la-la...what a lovely shoe.<eos> What brand shoe?<eos> Jimmy-chu.<eos> Armani?<eos> I am tired of talking.<eos> Pardon me, where's the wine? Where?<eos> Salute.<eos> Pretty, pretty girls... I've a message for you.
I am tired of talking.<eos> Pardon me, where's the wine? Where?<eos> Salute.<eos> Pretty, pretty girls... I've a message for you.<eos> This Madhubala, she and me no together. No, no, no girlfriend.<eos> Yes...<eos> Madhubala...free.<eos> Madhubala available.<eos> And in my heart... there is lot of love, amore.<eos> I want to give you love, come...
He's been following me around all week.<eos> Anyway, we're here today to talk about our esteemed recipient.<eos> No athlete wants to go under the knife. But when you do, you feel comfortable with Dr. Conners.<eos> He's not just changing professional athletes... and the way they look at medicine. He's also changing the world. And he's helping everybody.<eos> From pandemics to war-torn regions, to extreme poverty situations, they feel safe in his hands.<eos> To our MVP and to my good friend, Dr. Aaron Conners.<eos> Good luck. Thanks.<eos> Wow. Hey. Look at this.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Very nice. Very nice of you guys.
It wants you to believe that you'll look wonderful in that thing.<eos> But then to put it on and feel like,<eos> "Nah, you look kind of fat in it, you don't look that good in it, you're sorry you bought it, but there's another one you can buy."<eos> [Kasser] So think of all of the car commercials you see that show,<eos> "Well, I've really made it now, I'm a competent person because I'm driving this BMW or this Audi."<eos> Or think of all the shampoo commercials you've seen, where the person now has beautiful flowing hair and is loved and appreciated by the people around them.<eos> The basic message is the same:<eos> the way to solve the problems of your life, we all have problems in our life, the way to solve the problem in your life is through consumption.<eos> Hey, you guys!<eos> Today I am coming to you guys with a clothing haul!

I mean, if you want to grow flowers, you don't plant them in a closet.<eos> So either you're stupid or deep down inside you don't want monogamy either.<eos> You fucked my best friend!<eos> Which brings me to my third and final point.<eos> Your chief complaint is not that I screwed someone; it is who I screwed.<eos> That's what it's about, right?<eos> So much like the counter-intuitive plan to secure an exclusive relationship with a guy that you don't actually want to date - moi, your issue with me and Sarah--<eos> - Do not say her name!<eos> - Your issue with us is purely driven by a societal insecurity, not to mention a culturally infused female competition.<eos> My heart goes out to you ladies.
Let's check out downstairs.<eos> You can do it.<eos> You want to hold my hand?<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> Come on, one step at a time.<eos> - Okay, one more. Good.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Welcome home, honey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm very, very happy to see you.
Leo's been our friend since your morn was little.<eos> Jack, Jack, come on.<eos> Say... It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Yeah, it's all right.<eos> It's all right, sweetie.<eos> - Let's just... - Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come on in.<eos> So, what can I get you?
Hey.<eos> Uh, maybe tomorrow, we can cut that hair.<eos> What do you say, Jack?<eos> Ma?<eos> What?<eos> What? It's where my strong is...<eos> That's true.<eos> He says that's where his strong is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I'll just let you rest, huh, and we'll... we'll see you downstairs.
Let me try.<eos> Bravo, bravissima.<eos> Sit, sit, sit.<eos> I got you espressos.<eos> Yours is decaf.<eos> I don't get to see you two enough.<eos> Just so you know, Pascal, I have to be at my friend's house by 3:00.<eos> Gretel, call me Dad, please.<eos> Geez, okay.<eos> Look at you young ladies, you look so much older.
She's looking for another one.<eos> But we kind of don't have any money.<eos> She doesn't know I'm asking you.<eos> I get it.<eos> You're just trying to help.<eos> But...<eos> You know, Minnie, neither of us can help her.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> You could help if you cared about us.<eos> I care about you, Minnie.
Someone who really wants to talk to you.<eos> Mom.<eos> - I need to know that this is real.<eos> - Okay.<eos> She's saying something about a stage, an audition.<eos> She says that when you were on stage, you wanted to know if she was there.<eos> She was there.<eos> And she was so proud of you.<eos> She wants you, and you, Sean, to know that you don't need to look for her anymore.<eos> Because she'll always be with you.

Truck's unloaded.<eos> Driver needs a signature.<eos> Actually, uh, he needs it right here.<eos> You know, if, uh...<eos> If you need any help,<eos> I used to run shipping at a... At a bakery.<eos> Heard you's a writer.<eos> Well, that too.<eos> And a commie.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Women in Prison.<eos> Dames fighting in their underwear.<eos> It's perfect, except it stinks.<eos> What else, Hymie?<eos> Pirates.<eos> Can't afford the ocean.<eos> Fix them all.<eos> You want more, we got more.<eos> Oh, baby!<eos> So, what do you think of the new neighborhood? - I like it.
Yeah, if it doesn't exist, very new.<eos> What about the Rosenbergs?<eos> They stole the atom bomb.<eos> They didn't steal it off a fucking camera truck.<eos> So look, we bought a gorilla suit.<eos> We gotta use it.<eos> So, you had five jobs. Mmm-hmm.<eos> And now we got them and now you got none?<eos> Oh, now I'm free to get five more jobs and five more writers.<eos> And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.
Easy, Payne. He's just a kid. No, he's not.<eos> He's an outlaw, just like us.<eos> Anywho, let's drink.<eos> To friends! Old and new.<eos> Spin it.<eos> That's pretty good.<eos> Get that dirt, all of it, clean, clean it.<eos> I need to piss.<eos> Away from camp.<eos> It's easy to see how you two crossed paths.
I don't know about you, but to me there's something a bit funny about tortoises.
I don't know about you, but to me there's something a bit funny about tortoises.<eos> The way even the teenagers are wrinkly.<eos> I bet that leads to some awkward moments.<eos> "Oh, Brian, I love you so much.<eos> How old are you?"<eos> "I'm 17. How old are you, Janet?" "I'm 86." "Goodness me.<eos> You're old enough to be my grandmother."<eos> "Yeah, actually, Brian, ~ "I ~ AM ~ your grandmother."<eos> But the story I want to tell you, although it does involve tortoises, it doesn't begin with a tortoise.
The truth is there were two loves in Mr Hoppy's life.<eos> One was his flowers and the other was a secret love he kept all to himself.<eos> And like so many secrets, it was the most important thing of all about him.<eos> Because Mr Hoppy was in love... with the girl downstairs.<eos> Good morning, Mr Hoppy. Ah.<eos> Mrs Silver.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> By the way, our story is mainly concerned with this - the second love.<eos> If you want to find out about the flowers, watch Gardeners' World.
~ What floor are you? ~ Four.<eos> Oh, isn't that lucky?<eos> I'm moving in on three, below you.<eos> I hope you're not one of those rowdy types, keeping me up all night with your hip-hop stylings. No.<eos> But my name is Mr Hoppy, in fact. Hoppy.<eos> Oh, what a gorgeous name!<eos> And do I detect a little American accent there?<eos> Well, yes, I am an American. Oh, how divine.<eos> Oh, you're a gorgeous bunch.<eos> From Cary Grant to Paul Newman, I can't keep my hands off the lot of you!
Alfie! She didn't notice a thing.<eos> I'm quite a happy Hoppy!<eos> I'm..quite...a...happy... Hoppy!<eos> Yes, I am! Happy Hoppy!<eos> Yes, yes, yes!<eos> Alfie! We did it!<eos> Spot of tea?<eos> Come on!<eos> Mr Hoppy's secret plan was a cunning one. See,<eos> If a creature grows slowly enough, you'll never notice it grows at all.
Yes, he is. 26 ounces, to be exact.<eos> ~ Can I tempt you with something else to fill the hole in your life? ~ No. ~ Now you say goodbye to the big fella. ~ No, it's a pretty big hole.<eos> I've got an elephant out back.<eos> Not exactly an elephant.<eos> More a very big dog.<eos> Same shape ears.<eos> 'One down, 99 to go.<eos> 'That evening, Mr Hoppy sat on his balcony, certain of one thing. 'That he and Mrs Silver would never be together.'<eos> Sit tight, guys.<eos> I want you to know something.
I don't think so.<eos> She's a little old for NYU.<eos> $11.60.<eos> You must have had a lot of hash browns, sweetheart.<eos> Probably only eats once a week.<eos> Let's split it five ways.<eos> No, I think I owe someone an apology.<eos> That ought to do it.<eos> That's $100.<eos> I suppose I'm gonna have to drop one of you off.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Back to L.A., on a date.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Blind date.<eos> Lynn set it up.<eos> - I'm too old to be dating, but...<eos> - You're never too old to date.<eos> Anyway, I hope you girls enjoy yourselves, don't forget to...
Yeah?<eos> You can stay with me and Dex for a few nights.<eos> Take this moment to feel the calm in your body.<eos> To feel the peace in every cell of your being.<eos> Rolling over onto your side, come up into a comfortable, seated position.<eos> Put your hands on your heart.<eos> Gently opening your eyes, bringing that sense of peace and oneness... to everything that you see today.<eos> - Namaste.<eos> - Namaste.<eos> Okay, you guys, thank you so much.

The queen is my guest.<eos> I promised her I would be safe here.<eos> Are not you forgetting something?<eos> Or pact.<eos> I will read later, ma'am.<eos> You need not bother.<eos> You are a knight, right?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> This is the castle of my family.<eos> We defend these lands during the English conquest soldiers like you.
Good... you should have remembered that when kidnapped me and killed my followers.<eos> I heard you recommended a warrior. It is to protect the castle?<eos> The castle ruins can easily survive a siege.<eos> It is not far from the court.<eos> Will not resist to my arrival. Will get us without discussion.<eos> King's orders?<eos> I am leaving?<eos> Yes, it goes away.<eos> Where I go?<eos> To a castle in England where do you can never leave.
Continue.<eos> Ever seen in one place can become when there is no faith.<eos> Ask your guarantee in writing, sealed and sealed with the royal emblem, that no church, monastery or chapel will be played by our hosts.<eos> How can a king refuse a request so noble?<eos> You will have your paperwork when they leave.<eos> It is a promise and a duty.<eos> What wind blows in my direction?<eos> My curses of course were in vain since you're here.<eos> King's greetings and on our part, for their hospitality.<eos> With all that said, I receive, knight of the Knights and I wish you the best on your way.

It would have been better for me.<eos> But not for me.<eos> What pleased you have to kill men?<eos> Taking them from their families?<eos> His sons?<eos> That's what I do.<eos> And what I have to.<eos> Por quê?<eos> I am a knight.<eos> But you seem to like.
The same pride, loyalty and courage.<eos> -What is your name?<eos> -Stewart, Your Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty...<eos> Am I still am?<eos> This letter says I need to give everything I have.<eos> So who am I but a ... Miserable?<eos> My dear young Stewart,<eos> Robert nephew of the six golden haystacks ...<eos> I want to tell you a little secret.
I want to tell you a little secret.<eos> But not betray my trust.<eos> Not even my children know it.<eos> No message will get through to them.<eos> All messages of the "rebels" will be intercepted, which means that my arrival in Rouen will be a surprise.<eos> Yes. Another little secret among kings.<eos> Louis gave me all the necessary provisions, and gave me free passage to Rouen ...<eos> Let me make a small suggestion ... if I can.<eos> No no no no.<eos> I trust you, little Stewart, and I want to deliver a message for me.
Friends become enemies ...<eos> Powerful men win ...<eos> All communications were broken ...<eos> Rebels are defeated.<eos> Children will be put back in place.<eos> -Still Not thanked him ...<eos> Alys.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> We're safe!<eos> You delivered us, thank you.
Alys.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> We're safe!<eos> You delivered us, thank you.<eos> In fact, we fail in our goal.<eos> The castle will not be safe for long.<eos> I feel more defeated now than at the beginning of the siege.<eos> Forgive me, disturbed his prayers, and it's late.<eos> Eu sei...<eos> I know about you and your father.
The horse.<eos> So the first knight was created.<eos> Being a knight transcends the normal human being.<eos> Opens the door to an ancient world that is often difficult to master.<eos> It is a fraternity fight that always seeks to bring order the chaos of history.<eos> The higher your honor, deeper the abyss where the rider walks on the edge.<eos> You know what keeps us trapped in this world?<eos> A espada.<eos> She constantly reminded of how their way is difficult.<eos> The more you point a blade to his enemies, over the limit will come to you.
Good management has foresight, Ms. Sinclair!<eos> Now... I am bringing this mine back online.<eos> I want that iridium extracted by the end of this week.<eos> But, sir, that's impossible.<eos> Just to clear the rubble for survivors is gonna take months.<eos> Plans have changed.<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> You want some Gothic ranch action?<eos> Damn it. Not again.<eos> Tell you what.

Don't leave with the keys.<eos> Val, go get her.<eos> Oh, this is not fun. This is not fun.<eos> Go.<eos> Don't stop. I want no stops.<eos> I want you to get me to the airport now...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well done, dear boy.<eos> Well done.<eos> Now, either one of you care to explain what the hell is going on?
Sky, are you in there?<eos> Henry!<eos> You don't think I know what happened back there at the bar?<eos> It was Marcus.<eos> It was his idea.<eos> I went after him. And?<eos> He's dead.<eos> He took the deputy's car, and he's dead.<eos> What about Sinclair?<eos> - I assumed she was with you. - No.
My horse, some ATVs outside, and propane tanks.<eos> We rig 'em up, lead those dinosaurs back to the mine they came from.<eos> Some of us will set up on top of the crater rim and pick them off with the tracers one at a time as they come in.<eos> Yeah. I got a few surprises for them at the mine.<eos> Might come in handy. Yeah.<eos> You and the sheriff's as good a shot as any.<eos> It won't work. There are too many.<eos> We got a stockpile of ammo, propane tanks.<eos> We rig it up and draw them away.<eos> - What makes you think they'll follow?
CHAPTER 1-LOCKS<eos> There's a void inside of me that I just don't know how to fill.<eos> Should I be yearning for money or for love?<eos> We are but actors and the streets are our stages.<eos> I used to love a girl but she's now a slut.<eos> I used to love a girl but now she's a slut.<eos> One, two, three...<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> Let's see what it is.<eos> Ayhan, let me take a family photo of you guys.
No, no.<eos> I'm just lying.<eos> I just write and play.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> Listen closely.<eos> Isn't that everyone's favorite melody?<eos> What about that soothing smell?<eos> Don't you believe in the tale of the curvy mermaid with snakes in her hair.<eos> I don't know what I am and what I shall become.<eos> I'll tell you everything once again when I have my own language.
-Yeah. -And you.<eos> -Patti.<eos> Just beautiful.<eos> -Happy holidays.<eos> -Happy holidays.<eos> Remember what I said. Okay.<eos> Steve, you got a great family, man.<eos> You know, getting to do this for you, well, you know, it's just good deeds.<eos> It's what I'm about.<eos> Thank you.
So- - So, you sayin' if I get you in this party, you'll give me those shoes you got on your feet right now?<eos> -Oh-- -Yes.<eos> That's easy, man.<eos> Come on, let's do it.<eos> -What?<eos> -Nice!<eos> I'm playin', man.<eos> I don't want your shoes.<eos> Oh, man, you had me.<eos> I'll get you in the party, though. -That's easy.
[Kareem laughing] Busted face, and all he's worried about are his shoes.<eos> Dude, it went viral last night. It's everywhere.<eos> This is gonna be so good for the store.<eos> Plus, now you should be happy. Now everyone gets to see what an asshole Avedon is.<eos> We're not gonna be able to use that to promote the store. He'll sue us.<eos> Au contraire.<eos> He signed a contract to rep us. We can use his name and likeness.<eos> Why aren't you pissed?<eos> I put the store in jeopardy, bro.<eos> You do realize that Avedon is no longer gonna do any advertising for us, right?
Like, it doesn't.<eos> It doesn't mean anything without her.<eos> Steve?<eos> I love her.<eos> Oh, shit. -I gotta go.<eos> -Dude, you can't go.<eos> We're about to open the doors.<eos> Did you see that line? This is our moment!<eos> Stevie, don't do anything crazy.<eos> It's over between you two. This is real right here.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> The cameras ping off the movement of the chip. Oh.<eos> There's hardly any cars around here.<eos> Yeah, cars.<eos> I haven't seen a single airplane the whole time I've been here.<eos> Now, look who it is.<eos> Kate. Hi...<eos> Harold.<eos> Um, Ethan, this is Kate and Harold Ballinger. We know each other.<eos> I'm so glad you two are...
Citizens of Wayward, we are truly blessed.<eos> Not every community is as fortunate as ours. That's right.<eos> We truly care for one another.<eos> We protect each other.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sometimes even... From each other.<eos> And we will not allow anything or anyone to endanger our way of life.<eos> And I don't agree with the naysayers, those who say that being Sheriff is a thankless job.<eos> It's trying sometimes.<eos> But knowing that I've got the support and the trust of every single one of you gathered here tonight, that's what keeps me going.
you're like me, you know?<eos> We even like the same things.<eos> I always... - I always thought you were like me.<eos> - That hasn't changed.<eos> I am like you.<eos> I'm still the same person, Mom.<eos> No. You're not.<eos> You've been lying to me for years.<eos> Your father will have to know and you should tell him.<eos> I was going to tell you both at the same time but everybody was staring at me.
It means what it means.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hi, Mom. It's me.<eos> - Jenny.<eos> How are you?<eos> - I'm good, how are you? - I'm fine.<eos> - How are things?<eos> - Great.<eos> Things are great.<eos> How are things with you?
The two bull dykes on the top floor.<eos> - Don't call them that.<eos> - What? - Bull dykes, don't call them bull dykes.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because they're people, that's why. People like you and me.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I should have said the two bull people on the top floor.<eos> - What's eating him?<eos> - Bobby, just let it go.<eos> Eddie. Eddie, listen.<eos> Ellen told me what Jenny wanted to talk to you guys about. - I'm sorry.
Hey, Kitty.<eos> My dad wants to know if one of us straps it on in bed.<eos> I'm so sorry, Dad.<eos> She's a little bit funny. She doesn't like to tell people what she does or doesn't do in bed!<eos> I don't know who you are anymore.<eos> And I don't know if I care.<eos> - What's happened to you?<eos> - I'll tell you what's happened. I grew up.<eos> I used to care so much about what the two of you thought but not anymore.<eos> Why would I? How dare you talk to me about meeting the right person. Do you know who you meet every time you or Mom change?
Well, they must have done something wrong.<eos> We've all had problems with our kids, but nothing like this.<eos> I really feel sorry for them.<eos> And this wedding is embarrassing enough but those two are planning on having children.<eos> How can they have a normal life growing up in that house?<eos> It isn't right.<eos> Since when did you two become such big experts on what's normal and right? Rose.<eos> We didn't mean anything. We're just worried about you.<eos> Tell me, Marion. Is it normal and right for your daughter to get pregnant by every passing stranger and leave you to raise the kids?<eos> Or for... for Karen and her bum of a husband to never get a job and... and rob you and Denny of every last penny of your retirement savings!
I don't know, Rachel.<eos> Possibly.<eos> A face mask is a little extreme.<eos> Although I don't think he should sit with us anymore.<eos> And you should have your own mug.<eos> Do you all agree?<eos> We cured cancer.<eos> We cured the common cold.<eos> We can cure S.O.S. You're going to live, pal.<eos> Thank you all.
I'm almost finished, Dominic.<eos> All the other illustrators received their pieces hours ago...<eos> I'm almost finished, Dominic.<eos> But I appreciate your patience.<eos> Of course.<eos> Silas, you made it.<eos> This is great.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> Everybody, this is Silas.<eos> The one I was telling you about.
But you don't know that he died.<eos> What if he didn't?<eos> I can talk to my old colleague.<eos> He was the pilot who took us on the air patrol.<eos> If they get caught, the whole plan could be traced back to you or to the group.<eos> You said interfering was too risky.<eos> If you make this decision you know... there is no turning back.<eos> If you do manage to get out... you can never return.<eos> Of course.<eos> When you get to the border ask for Oliver, he will fly you.
You'll have to ask him about that.<eos> I just spoke to him.<eos> He said it's all coming from you.<eos> Yes?<eos> He said that, did he?<eos> I'm no expert on scrapie, Grímur.<eos> But when I examined the ram yesterday, that was the first thing that came to mind.<eos> Damn it.<eos> If we have scrapie in the valley, we're in deep shit.<eos> You lot over on the east side have no need to worry if scrapie shows up here.
A fly?<eos> No, a butterfly.<eos> She got it at the dentist's.<eos> - And?<eos> Were you brave?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go play.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Let me spend some time with her. And with you.
Mail it?<eos> Thank you,<eos> Marlene.<eos> Take care.<eos> "For Sandra and Ronja."<eos> Dear Sandra.<eos> It's me, Herbert.<eos> It's slowly getting worse with my voice.<eos> It's disappearing.<eos> That's why I wanted to tell you...
- Exactly.<eos> This is what you see when you're young.<eos> Everything seems really close.<eos> And that's the future.<eos> And now...<eos> And that's what you see when you're old.<eos> Everything seems really far away.<eos> That's the past.<eos> Brenda... Can't wait to get started.<eos> And I am so proud of having written this screenplay with you.
Brenda wanted to play Eva Braun a hundred years ago.<eos> She spent six months working on her role.<eos> I have been studying all the hotel guests for a weeks now.<eos> I've been meticulously observing you, Fred, Lena,...<eos> The Russians, the Arabs, the young and the old.<eos> And I have finally come to a conclusion.<eos> I have to choose.<eos> I have to choose what is really worth telling... horror or desire?<eos> And I chose desire.<eos> You, each one of you you opened my eyes.
Come on Lacy.<eos> Oh God in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come...<eos> You filthy liar!<eos> We know what you did!<eos> You killed those babies!<eos> Fucking bitch!<eos> You're a filthy liar!<eos> You know what you did!<eos> Don't deny it now.<eos> Did you look at that window?
You're dreaming, Bruce.<eos> This isn't real.<eos> Give him the knife.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Don't cry sweetheart.<eos> It's only a dream.<eos> Our secret recipe.<eos> Go on. Drink.<eos> I'm not one of you!
This isn't real.<eos> Give him the knife.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Don't cry sweetheart.<eos> It's only a dream.<eos> Our secret recipe.<eos> Go on. Drink.<eos> I'm not one of you!<eos> I'm not one of you!
" Number 4, the Seahawks and the Chiefs. "<eos> " D.J. Hackett is gonna make the catch and Ty Law will launch him backwards. "<eos> " How far backwards? "<eos> " Eyes on me! Eyes on me!<eos> Gentlemen! "<eos> " This is a game of awareness. "<eos> It is a game of desire.<eos> That's why we have the three-whistle drill.<eos> Let's go!<eos> When I blow this whistle three times, you seek out a teammate.
Is this English soil?<eos> It was once.<eos> Now it ain't.<eos> - Whose is it?<eos> - Ours!<eos> When the King brands us pirates, he means to make us monsters, for that's the only way his God-fearing, tax-paying subjects can make sense of men who keep what is theirs and fear no one.<eos> I'm not just going to make you rich. I'm not just going to make your strong. I'm going to make you the princes of the New World!
In a matter of days, they'll locate our wreck and our camp, and they will kill every last member of your crew.<eos> And they'll deserve it, none more so than you.<eos> Bring them back.<eos> We'll ready the nooses.<eos> Wait.<eos> The Urca's gold is secure.<eos> A full complement of soldiers, reinforced batteries... 18-pounders, all of them... and men who know how to use them.<eos> There's no way of approaching that beach from the land.<eos> Why the fuck are we listening to him? Yeah, why?<eos> We should be cutting your goddamn tongue out for all the lies you've told us.
I would volunteer in exchange for your pardon.<eos> That leaves one man to go.<eos> One volunteer...<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll go.<eos> Then let's put Mr. Flint's plan to a vote.<eos> All in favor?<eos> Lord Thomas Hamilton?<eos> Are you the liaison sent by the Admiralty?
I am, my lord.<eos> They say it started with a man named Henry Avery.<eos> Sailed into the port of Nassau, bribed the colonial governor to look past his sins, encamped his crew upon the beach, and thus began the pirate issue on New Providence Island.<eos> Where and when will it all end?<eos> I suppose that's where you and I come into the story.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, my father the earl holds great sway amongst his peers in Whitehall.<eos> He has asked for the assistance of Her Majesty's Navy in pacifying the island to which he holds title.<eos> He was assured that this request would be considered - a matter of the utmost importance.<eos> - Undoubtedly, my lord.<eos> Then perhaps you can tell me why they decided to send you.
You are a rising star with a bright future in the Admiralty.<eos> You can understand my concern.<eos> Not really.<eos> Perhaps my lack of education is showing.<eos> I intend to accomplish something here, Lieutenant.<eos> I intend to save Nassau before she's lost forever.<eos> And I cannot do that with a partner who might be more concerned about advancing his career than he is about realizing this goal.<eos> - You want to save Nassau, my lord?<eos> - Very much so.<eos> Then perhaps my job is to make certain you know what you're getting into.
I'm not doing it.<eos> I don't need to return to Nassau.<eos> I am happy to find some other place to survive.<eos> St. Augustine is that way.<eos> It's at least a week on foot, Tequesta tribes in between.<eos> I doubt you'll survive to see sunrise tomorrow.<eos> How are you even gonna get out there with one arm?<eos> What is this exercise intended to prove, Lieutenant?<eos> You want to understand why piracy flourishes in the West Indies.<eos> I'm about to show you.
To attempt to address this subject is doomed to defeat from the outset.<eos> It's not him I wanted you to see.<eos> No mercy!<eos> Take him all the way to hell!<eos> It's them.<eos> Civilization needs its monsters.<eos> You think Whitehall wants piracy to flourish in the Bahamas?<eos> No, I don't think they want it, but I think they're aware of the cost associated with trying to fight it.<eos> And I think that that sound travels.<eos> You're an educated man, my lord, but I think it worth reminding you that in most cases a man trying to change the world fails for one simple and unavoidable reason... everyone else.
Look.<eos> Doesn't it make more sense for us to prompt the lookout to come down, than for us to go up there after him?<eos> You are truly amazing, you know that?<eos> We're both better off now than we were two minutes ago, yet you're angry about it because it didn't happen your way.<eos> Might you consider for a fucking moment that your distrust of me is completely unwarranted?<eos> I warned you about Billy.<eos> Was I right?<eos> I found you over Mr. Gates's body, and did I do anything but defend you?<eos> When you were sinking to the bottom of the sea, who do you imagine it was who dragged you onto that beach?<eos> Brace yourself, but I'm the only person within a hundred miles of here who doesn't want to see you dead.
- Starting shit without telling us.<eos> - Let me explain.<eos> - Don't you fucking talk back to me.<eos> - All right.<eos> Either she's on her back, or she's out on the streets.<eos> But if it ain't one of the two come tomorrow, I'm gonna deal with it my way.<eos> I will be very honest with you.<eos> I could torture the two of you to find out who you are, how many more of you there are and what you're hoping to accomplish here.<eos> I could find it out and you would both suffer.<eos> But today is your lucky day, at least for one of you.

I don't fuck customers.<eos> Everybody here knows it. Now you do, too.<eos> A sound rule.<eos> Unfortunate for me, but sound nonetheless.<eos> Still, it is unthinkable to me that someone this beautiful is forced to spend her nights alone.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Ned Low.<eos> You met my quartermaster Meeks this morning.<eos> From what I understand, we were shortchanged a fair amount on a prize haul owing to the condition of its containers.<eos> I understand Mr. Meeks told you The episode on the Good Fortune was a case of self-defense.
I'm going to tell you a story about a boy who would never grow up, about the pirate who wished to kill him, about the island where fairies roamed.
And if you lucky, somebody won't have to beat it into you.<eos> Now, that ain't my style.<eos> But I ain't too old to change.<eos> Get this cleaned up... and me and you gonna be okay.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let's go, sweetheart.<eos> Compliments of Mr. Wyatt's late-night outing... he will be wearing the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo!<eos> He will wear it today, tomorrow and for as long as I say!<eos> This is not the only tuxedo I have in stock, Mr. Dye.<eos> Any one of you even think about going AWOL, Mr. Stein... I will outfit all you fish in a flash.
Oh, wow, if it's Bernville, and it's autumn and it's after 6... don't be caught dead without the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.<eos> Made from the finest Dacron in Akron, rubber capital of the world.<eos> It is smart, dashing and now, the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.<eos> If you gotta be bad, but you wanna look good, this is the tux for you... and you, and you and you.<eos> It comes in a rainbow of colors, red, yellow, tan and brown.<eos> The Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo!<eos> It is a veritable clusterfuck of a tux.<eos> Any takers? Five ninety-nine.<eos> It's 7.99 at Walmart.<eos> What about you fellas over here?
(BARKS)<eos> Well, look what we have here.<eos> We hit the jackpot.<eos> Attaboy, Max.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> KYLE:<eos> Mom, I know it's been too long since we last talked. They doubled our patrols, but it's paying off.<eos> Our battalion's never had a find like this.<eos> We owe it all to Max.<eos> We're so proud of you both.
- Hey, Dad. How you doing?<eos> - I'm good, Kyle.<eos> - You shouldn't mess with your mother like that.<eos> - Yes, sir. Sorry.<eos> - What'd y'all dig up over there?<eos> - The usual. Just a lot more of it.<eos> You know, RPGs, AKs. A lot of Russian junk left over from the '80s.<eos> I'd trade that M-4 for one of those Russian AKs any day of the week.<eos> - I'll run that up the flagpole, sir. - Well...<eos> Anyway, I think both of you deserve a medal or something.
Whoa!<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> What's on your mind, Ray?<eos> Something just isn't sitting right.<eos> That deputy's place is way out there in the middle of nowhere.<eos> What would Justin and Max be doing out there, Pam?<eos> I don't know, Ray.<eos> I told you, he wouldn't talk to me.<eos> If you wanna know what's going on with Justin... I think it's time you ask him yourself.<eos> I've been keeping the peace between you two since the day Kyle left this house.
- Get in the truck.<eos> What happened?<eos> Give me the keys and get in the truck!<eos> (MAX BARKS)<eos> Justin.<eos> Wait.<eos> Justin, I'm just slowing you and Max down.<eos> (TRUCK REVVING IN DISTANCE)<eos> So much for taking that truck out.<eos> You and Max just go on to the highway... and I'll keep these guys off you as long as I can.
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> It's okay, Reg.<eos> I thought he was a friend.<eos> I know.<eos> Want me to stay tonight?<eos> No. I'm good.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm good.<eos> How y'all want me to talk to you when you keep fucking hitting me?
I thought he was a friend.<eos> I know.<eos> Want me to stay tonight?<eos> No. I'm good.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm good.<eos> How y'all want me to talk to you when you keep fucking hitting me?<eos> How many other corrupt motherfuckers are you working with on this side of the border?<eos> All right. Look...<eos> It's exactly what I told you, all right? They just...
Fuck! Get it out!<eos> Get it the fuck out!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Get it the fuck out!<eos> Get it out!<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> And fuck you!<eos> Fuck!<eos> How many officers do they have working on the force?<eos> I'll tell you everything you wanna know. You just gotta promise me that my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?
Hey, it's about your own self, but bird Flamingo it has disrupted my work<eos> I'm sorry about him.<eos> Making himself stuck in my two years ago and he did not want to go.<eos> Name is Stayput. I was his best friend Obesey.<eos> You're so annoying.<eos> We joke like this all the time.<eos> Now I have to share my last moments with the rear seats were always raving.<eos> Hmm ..<eos> Hey, why do not you come with us?<eos> What? Oh, you're so kind, but I'm afraid we will just slow you guys.

Oh, you're so kind, but I'm afraid we will just slow you guys.<eos> Shut up, fool!<eos> Heh, do not listen to him!<eos> We would love to go with you!
Hmm ..<eos> Go to the top of the hill.<eos> A good idea!<eos> Look at him.<eos> Hmm? How can he go up there?<eos> Come on, Leah, they have saved us.<eos> We can not leave them just here to drown.<eos> Oh, well, but they are your responsibility!<eos> Welcome to join in this team!<eos> Really? We could go with you?
I'm sorry, sir, it certainly other animals do it on this ship ..<eos> You can not .. Wow, that was almost alone!<eos> A little .. a little bit too excited for my taste.<eos> Your plan goes well.<eos> You make a good bait.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Hey, let me out!<eos> Which road? We do not have much time.<eos> I do not like being in here ..<eos> Uh, let me think. I would become good friends you if you get me!
Exhale, pull the trigger.<eos> Predator.<eos> The adjustments are off on the sight.<eos> I can tell, it's a little off here.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> - Paul Blart, Mall Cop.<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> Eduardo Furtillo, head of security of Wynn Las Vegas.<eos> Pleasure to meet a fellow brother-in-arms.<eos> You know, a fun fact for you, you might not notice, but Mr. Furtillo here, being the head of security, is in a black coat while...
Your lip is sweating.<eos> It's sweating.<eos> There is an audience out there of security professionals that paid good money to hear you speak.<eos> They want to hear you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> They didn't pay anything, but they do deserve your best.<eos> They deserve it. They deserve it.<eos> Yeah, come on, man.<eos> Just loosen up, baby, loosen up.<eos> Coming at you!
And second off...<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Strange.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> Get rid of this.<eos> Hey, Yo, have you guys seen Maya?<eos> - Who's Maya?<eos> - I introduced you to her.
Let me hear ya say, "I got it."<eos> I got it.<eos> I'm gonna need a hand tyin' these fellas up on the roof.<eos> Give O.B. $50 when we get to Red Rock.<eos> He'll help ya.<eos> Well, I agree with O.B.<eos> This storm got me concerned.<eos> We get goin' a lot quicker you helped out, too.<eos> Goddamn it to hell, I'm already regretting' this.<eos> Now, I can't likely help you tie fellas to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.
Stagecoach driver, could you come down here and join us?<eos> I got to hold these horses.<eos> I can hear you just fine from up here.<eos> Well, you just heard me tell this fella I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Red Rock is my town now.<eos> And I'm gonna enter my town in bounty hunter's chains?<eos> No, sir!<eos> Sorry, bushwhackers, I ain't entering Red Rock that way.<eos> Now, when you finally get to Red Rock, you gonna realize every goddamn thing I said was right.
All three of us were on that stagecoach out there.<eos> Coffee beans.<eos> Over there.<eos> Get your hand out of there.<eos> New sheriff of Red Rock's traveling' with us.<eos> Sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.<eos> He's a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle.<eos> Good.<eos> Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable.<eos> So, the new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with you?
Give me the key!<eos> You motherfucking black bastard!<eos> You're gonna die on this mountain, and I'm gonna fucking laugh when you do!<eos> What'd I say 'bout talkin'? Bastard.<eos> Meant it, didn't I?<eos> And you need to understand you just killed the only man here committed to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.<eos> Now, one of y'all... is workin' with her.<eos> Or two of y'all is workin' with her.<eos> Or all y'all is.<eos> But only one of you poisoned the coffee.
Maybe.<eos> But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.<eos> He damn sure wasn't.<eos> But he sure enough laying' over there dead now, though, ain't he?<eos> He damn sure is, you sons of bitches.<eos> Just like any one of us would've drunk that coffee.<eos> Like me, goddamn it.<eos> Now, those of y'all with your hands on the wall don't practice in poison need to think about that.<eos> Think about how it could've been you rollin' around here on this floor.<eos> And how the man standin' next to you would be responsible.
Well, that's what I meant in the barn when I said that sure don't sound like Minnie.<eos> Now I am calling you a liar, Senor Bob.<eos> And if you lyin', which you are then you killed Minnie.<eos> And Sweet Dave.<eos> Four measly bullets, and there goes Senor Bob.<eos> But that still don't get us no closer to which one of y'all poisoned the coffee, though.<eos> Do it, Chris?<eos> No, it sure don't.<eos> Now, one of y'all poisoned this coffee to free Daisy.<eos> If I don't hear a confession from one of you motherfuckers quick, fast and in a hurry, I'm gonna pour this whole pot of coffee down that bitch's goddamn throat.
What you think, Pete?<eos> Well, I must admit, he does make the setup more convincing.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll talk to the old man.<eos> You three collect the bodies and chuck 'em in that well out there.<eos> And then start unhitchin' the horses and gettin' 'em in the barn and gettin' 'em fed. Well, hang on.<eos> I mean, puttin' the horses away, that's easy enough, but dragging' these fat bastards up and down the mountain, that's fuckin' impossible, mate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, this is a store, so there's gotta be a wheelbarrow around here somewhere.<eos> Start with the horses, and as soon as I get through with this old hickory tree, I'll come out and help you, okay?
I don't know what you mean.<eos> That's a... We can call that a stylistic choice, I guess.<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> We got business.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> I know. Eerie, right?<eos> Whoa, come on.<eos> Give me 30 seconds.<eos> Could be the most profitable 30 seconds of your lives.<eos> Let me tell you about a young guy.
Let me tell you about a young guy.<eos> Actually, he's about your age.<eos> He lived a long way from here in a town called Cicero, Illinois.<eos> And in Cicero, he was the man.<eos> I mean, when he strolled down the street all the corner boys would give him the high five.<eos> All the finest babes would smile at him and hope that he would smile back.<eos> They called him Slippin' Jimmy and everybody wanted to be his friend.<eos> Slippin' Jimmy.<eos> What the hell kind of name is that?<eos> Well, I'll tell you now.
They said we have to go there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> We heard that too.<eos> No.<eos> It's too far.<eos> We'll never make it.<eos> I'm gonna draw them away from the house.<eos> And when it's clear, you get to the truck, but don't start it.<eos> Not until I give you the signal.
- Just to say hi.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hello, Maggie.<eos> Hi.<eos> John had a meeting, so he asked me to drop them off.<eos> - Come in. - Thanks.<eos> Now, I have made you a nice snack.
All right, Paul, here I come to cut up your apple.<eos> Hey, Jonathan.<eos> I don't know if you guys are, you know, back yet or not.<eos> But, listen, if you are, give me a shout, okay? I think...<eos> Hey, Ben I don't know if your couch is available.<eos> But I can bring beer!<eos> Felicia. Thank God you're home.<eos> Hi, how are you doing?<eos> Not so good.<eos> - So she already told you guys? - Well, she...
I am not hearing this.<eos> When I heard the explosion, I thought the walls of the Fort were going to come down.<eos> Did ye use yer breath or yer farts to subdue them?<eos> Are ye calling me a liar?<eos> Aye, because ye are lying.<eos> Ye kilt nobody.<eos> Oh, oh, for god's sake, Angus, sit down.<eos> Stop flapping yer gums. Use it for something useful for a change.<eos> Yeah, I'm not gonna tell it if you're taking that tone.<eos> I don't believe I've properly thanked all of you.
'Twas Dougal's arrangement, ye see.<eos> It's no simple story, I can tell ye that much, but an explanation will have to wait.<eos> Colum summons me.<eos> I must go.<eos> Aye, ye canna keep a MacKenzie waiting.<eos> But we'll speak again?<eos> Aye. You have my word.<eos> Ah, it's the bridegroom.<eos> Aye.<eos> Now that I have all three of you weasels gathered together, who would like to explain Fort William?
Szorlok.<eos> He's the darkest of the necromancers.<eos> 80 years ago the Vitalian army was at Deira's doorstep ...<eos> Santri Senturi Impes octrus Urum.<eos> Behold the Darkspore.<eos> Santri Senturi Impes octrus Urum.<eos> Worship me as I reforge the heart of the Lich King.<eos> And now you will fulfill your true purpose in this ceremony.<eos> Lich king, for a thousand years your power will rival the gods.<eos> Szorlok, in the names of all the gods, I command you to stop.
- Send this one.<eos> He need the work out, some of those angers.<eos> You and I can get my silver's worth of the bed.<eos> Paid forth to the noon.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Noon.<eos> Tell Teela we all mourn with her.<eos> Have a fruit.<eos> Noon?<eos> Your slave girl with the deformed foot. I like to purchase her from you.
- I will come with you.<eos> And I will report to you. And I will deliver the Darkspore to the Paladin..<eos> He will know how best to hide it.<eos> Declare yourself.<eos> Declare yourself.<eos> Attack.<eos> Go to Mineas. Get reinforcements.<eos> Make haste.<eos> Hold them off.<eos> Did I ever tell you about those ten giants and their incredibly large...
- Thane.<eos> Don't lie to us, long-ears . - I speak the truth.<eos> There is no honour in lying.<eos> I'm bound to you until that dept's been repaid.<eos> Just what every girl wants.<eos> He's lying by the way.<eos> He is a Druchii and they lie, lie<eos> Probably planning on slitting our throats tonight ... and painting pictures of it all over his face.<eos> You believe him<eos> I am telling you: He is pure evil.
It is so hard to find a moment of privacy in this woods.<eos> Put the sword away, you won't be needing it tonight.<eos> Dagen.<eos> Get up.<eos> Qole, my sword.<eos> Can someone hand me my sword?<eos> Damn it.<eos> - Good shot.<eos> We've come for Marek.<eos> The rest of you are free to leave.
Can someone hand me my sword?<eos> Damn it.<eos> - Good shot.<eos> We've come for Marek.<eos> The rest of you are free to leave.<eos> You have to kill us first.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> Gods. They are magnificent.<eos> And she's good at the rope.<eos> - Any of you bastards try to follow us ... and I'll slit her throat all the way her spine.
It may be pop psychology, but think it over and come back to talk again.<eos> Sure.<eos> What happened?<eos> Recognize me?<eos> No.<eos> - Can't you go eat together?<eos> - No, not without you.<eos> We need you to defend us.<eos> You look like death warmed over.<eos> Who'd hassle you at this time?
Dammit!<eos> Calm down.<eos> Where's my glass?<eos> Calm down.<eos> - l have an announcement to make.<eos> - Without the glass.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Sit down, you!<eos> You know what the party's for tonight?<eos> I'll leave it to Georgio to tell you.
Calm down.<eos> - l have an announcement to make.<eos> - Without the glass.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Sit down, you!<eos> You know what the party's for tonight?<eos> I'll leave it to Georgio to tell you.<eos> Stand up!<eos> Go on, tell them.<eos> I'll tell you what the party's for.
You're hot, shortie!<eos> Tony, why do you hang with us?<eos> We're not the same age, not the same social background.<eos> You're not as smart as us. And you hang out with us.<eos> - Seriously, how come?<eos> - You got an ulterior motive?<eos> I don't need one. I like you guys. You're fun.<eos> You're real clowns.<eos> Who's your favorite?<eos> Out of all of you?
I like that.<eos> I'm so sick of these wankers.<eos> Hey, easy, Mel.<eos> We'll see you later, girls.<eos> I'm looking for somebody.<eos> Hello.<eos> Seen this guy?<eos> Is that him?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you both.
Annie.<eos> You're the only one that truly knows me.<eos> It's because of you that I can do this walk.<eos> You give me the strength and the ability.<eos> Without you, I couldn't do it.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Everybody, wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up! Wake up!<eos> There's something I have to tell you that I have not said before.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I would like to make a toast now.<eos> To all of you, my accomplices.<eos> I know I can be...<eos> A bit difficult.<eos> But, but you never gave up on me.<eos> And because of this, I was able to walk on that wire.<eos> So for allowing me this honor, thank you.
Yeah, it takes some time to take it all in.<eos> It's not that.<eos> It's just... basic logic.<eos> Or illogic.<eos> I mean, if... if... if what Mrs. Fisher is teaching is actually true and these Abbies actually exist, how have I never heard of them before?<eos> They're running around in broad daylight in Idaho.<eos> We are in Idaho, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We are in Idaho.<eos> And what Mrs. Fisher is teaching you is true.
Who?<eos> Who? Who will know? That is what I need to know from you.<eos> You said you saw something.<eos> I woke up after the accident, but... I don't remember much.<eos> I must have been drugged.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> "That's impossible.<eos> How could it be 4028?<eos> How could we have skipped so much time?"<eos> But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state which allows it to survive all winter long without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
- thank you. - My pleasure.<eos> Over 2,000 years ago, a great scientist foresaw the coming of the Aberrations.<eos> The perfect equation that held our planet together was unraveling, and he knew Mother Nature would do as she always does... she would evolve, she would change the equation, she would change us.<eos> This scientist wanted to save a select sample of humans from this change to preserve our kind as we once were.<eos> So he created an ark.<eos> He created Wayward Pines.<eos> A scientist?<eos> His name is David Pilcher.<eos> Unfortunately, you will never meet David Pilcher, but you can take comfort in the fact that he is always watching over you.<eos> He will never allow anything to happen to you because you are the future.
Wayward Pines.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> And I'll show you how, together, we can change things for the better.<eos> Or if you prefer, you can discover for yourself what is out here.<eos> It's your choice, Ethan.<eos> What you learn today is for your eyes and ears only.<eos> You do not tell your parents.<eos> You do not tell any adults for one simple reason.<eos> The future of this great town lies not with the adults but with you.
The truth is too much for their minds.<eos> Telling them would not only put their lives in danger and not just your own but all of Wayward Pines.<eos> _<eos> David Pilcher foresaw a great flood,<eos> - and he built an ark, - _ and he filled this ark with people like you and me.<eos> People he deemed necessary for the survival of mankind.<eos> - We are the lucky ones, the chosen few. - _<eos> But this ark will only survive if we all follow the rules.<eos> If there is one hole, one crack, then the water will get in, and we will all drown.<eos> It's up to you to make sure that doesn't happen.

Jesus, you two fight way too much to end up together like everyone expects you to.<eos> I'm gonna check the gennies.<eos> Keep those sticky fingers to yourself while we were gone, little sis?<eos> No, hell, no.<eos> Little silent monk tried to take my arrows.<eos> Hey, Chicago, man, check under the pillows.<eos> Keep your damn hands in your Polly pockets.<eos> Was it a pretty fruitful run? Yeah.<eos> Figured it was only a matter of time before one of these chicks get prego.<eos> Well, she's barely 14, and I'd rather screw a zombie than any of you, so I think we're good.
We mean we're moving on from the mall, all of us.<eos> Your instincts are way off.<eos> You never defer leadership to a woman.<eos> I'm sorry. Did you forget who robbed you blind right in front of your eyes?<eos> - Not sure that's as insulting as you think.<eos> - Hey!<eos> This is not a democracy.<eos> The decision's been made.<eos> We're heading to the farm.<eos> So which one of you is the dictator?
Give me your gun!<eos> Listen to me, will you?<eos> Give me your gun, Captain!<eos> - Myung-Woo!<eos> - Captain!<eos> I'll explain everything.<eos> Just listen to me!<eos> Myung-Woo! Who sent you?<eos> Was it Kim Koo?<eos> Did he order you to kill me?
Two perfect puzzle pieces, like hand in glove.<eos> Yes, yes, it's embarrassing to talk about.<eos> But what if... what if Ben was a bee and Amy was a flower?<eos> Well, that wouldn't be funny at all, would it?<eos> Wayward Pines needs a new generation.<eos> And one day, not too long from now, you all will have the honor of parenting the first generation of 100% originals.<eos> Now, take a look around the room.<eos> This is a small town. Right?<eos> Chances are, your mate... your co-parent is sitting right here in this room.<eos> And it's part of my job as your teacher and counselor to help you find each other.
You will wait for me?<eos> Sorry.<eos> A small thing. It says:<eos> AD 007.<eos> 007, my license plate.<eos> My dream since I was a child.<eos> Wait for me!<eos> Romy.<eos> Good morning, teacher.<eos> I will show you your rooms in few moments.
Yes, but I'm talking about my movie.<eos> Pier had liked my script, had even spoken with a...<eos> With whom?<eos> Stop telling yourself this bullshit.<eos> Take the money and use it for what you can do for real.<eos> Now do not be afraid.<eos> What happened, it happened unfortunately.<eos> Regardless, you all did very well.<eos> It is true.<eos> I am pleased with you.
- Bye.<eos> - Goodbye, Annie.<eos> Bye, Miss May.<eos> So, I'm just going to read a few lines here and see if we can connect to whatever is in the house, okay?<eos> So, you just sit there and um, maybe close your eyes and just try to believe what we're doing is real.<eos> It's just so helpful if you're in a zone.<eos> We are addressing any spirits here.<eos> This house belongs to the living.<eos> Their names are Paul and Anne, and they have a connection to your world.<eos> Their son Bobby is with you.
I don't...<eos> Ah!<eos> We're going to get out of here, Annie.<eos> Dagmar!<eos> What in Hell is going on?<eos> These folks been in this house two weeks and they're still alive.<eos> Why?<eos> Something special about them?<eos> You wanted this house so bad you were willing to kill for it so we just let you.<eos> Having you here made every sacrifice after you a hell a lot easier.
So?<eos> Are you the same person?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Christy...<eos> What else haven't you told me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> After what happened today... This isn't the time to make any decisions.<eos> Girls need us.<eos> Both of us.<eos> I'll drop you both off.
Thanks.<eos> Any, word from the police?<eos> Anyone who hurts a child, I say kill him.<eos> Let God sort it out.<eos> I told you he hates me.<eos> You must have done something.<eos> Anybody been over to see Jess yet?<eos> You guys, Tom was here all the time.<eos> Nat, you loved him.<eos> What's wrong with you guys?
You comin' down to Baton Rouge.<eos> That's wonderful, Carmen.<eos> And we would love to be there, but, uh...<eos> You know what, right now Bernie and I are going through some financial difficulties...<eos> Shut your pie hole, Franklin.<eos> You're not gonna have to pay for anything, cheap-ass.<eos> Daddy's pickin' up the tab.<eos> That's really generous of your father, but...<eos> But nothin', Vega.<eos> I already e-mailed you your flight arrangements.
- Carmen's parents live here?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Reminds me of my vacation home.<eos> All right, finally!<eos> Now we can get this party started! Oh!<eos> Damn, you look good, girl.<eos> Now, you boys had your chance.<eos> I'm a taken woman now, okay?<eos> Come on in.<eos> I wanna introduce you to my mama and daddy.
Nice guy.<eos> No one has ever made me feel the way he does... and I've never been happier.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> If you don't mind me asking.<eos> He was in Afghanistan on the front lines.<eos> He took an IED for a buddy.<eos> I'm sorry, Carmen.<eos> Nothing to be sorry about.<eos> That man lives his life like he's standin' seven feet tall.<eos> I wanna thank you all for comin', and now I'd like to say a few words.

A toast.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Carmen and Geoffrey, we wanna wish you all the best in the world forever.
- My car?<eos> This week, we have family in... in town... and... and I'm playing chauffeur.<eos> Oh, yeah. No, hey. I totally get it.<eos> I get that.<eos> Listen, either you give me this car... or I'll beat the shit out of you.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> - You boys got somewhere you gotta be?<eos> - Yeah. We're all set.<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> Unless you gonna let my ass go, I don't want shit from you.
Your wife brings the money. Alone.<eos> We see anyone else there, your daughter dies.<eos> Now hang on one second.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> I'm lookin' for Chief Broussard.<eos> He said he'd be back in 20 minutes.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Any of you boys wanna play canasta?
Damn, Green Machine!<eos> Is that you or a lead pipe in your pocket?<eos> Stay down, bitch.<eos> Well, I guess that's about it.<eos> Oh, come on, boys.<eos> You sure you don't wanna chill out here a few more days?<eos> We'll make it worth your while.<eos> We'd love to, but Bernie's got a doctor's appointment first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> All right, then. Bring it on in for the sweet thang.<eos> You have no idea how grateful I am to the both of you.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm deeply indebted to both of you.<eos> You brought my child back.<eos> Words can never express how much I appreciate that.<eos> But you gave me somethin' else.<eos> For the first time in 30 years, guys...<eos> 30 years... I feel alive again.<eos> And because of that, I've found my true purpose.<eos> I wanna bring justice back to those places... that have been completely drained of it... and I wanna do it with the two of you.

You know, Bernie and I... have other responsibilities.<eos> Oh, Frank, I'm aware of that.<eos> I know you got your community center.<eos> And of course Bernie's got his liquor store.<eos> I'm not asking you to give that up.

Nothing.<eos> I can't find Marcus.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Hug the shadows.<eos> Only move when you have to.<eos> Hit and run. Got it?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> They slipped past all of you.
Wow.<eos> You're something else, rachel.<eos> I don't know. Do you think that you're, like, forward Because of, um...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was just saying that, like,<eos> You know, when bad things go down, Sometimes your kid brain computes it as, like, um...<eos> I don't know. "i must be unlovable."<eos> I am... Completely... Loveable.<eos> [ spits ] Burn in hell, you witch!<eos> All of you, just burn in hell!
Cold eggs and ham.<eos> Going once, going twice.<eos> Rachel?<eos> Uh, Rachel?<eos> Go for Rachel.<eos> Rachel, there's somebody here to see you.<eos> Flying in.<eos> Did you just call me a slut?<eos> Burn in hell, you witch!<eos> All of you, just burn in hell!
It's lunch time.<eos> Just got to pack up some stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get along, little doggy.<eos> Starving.<eos> I don't know how you guys do it.<eos> Yeah, I, um, I ju...<eos> Lizzie, I just wanted to apologize, you know, about that footage and all.<eos> No, no. There's no need to explain.<eos> I knew about you guys already.
- You have something to say? Give the man a chance to speak.<eos> There's probably a reasonable explanation, right?<eos> Thank you, Athena. Um...<eos> The truth is, I did start texting my ex-fiancée after Rog came to visit.<eos> There you go.<eos> Rog reminded me of home, of the people I grew up with who think it's silly for me to be on this show. They think it's beneath me.<eos> Which... it sounds snobbish, I know.<eos> But I listened.<eos> Because when you're born into a certain class, there's only one kind of person you're supposed to marry... someone exactly the same as you.<eos> But here, with all of you, it's so new, so different, so filled with possibilities

- Not anymore. He has his life together and he's not married.<eos> Hey!<eos> I know you. We're the same, you and me, and Bill's gonna bore you to tears.<eos> I deserve to have a life, Chet.<eos> Let me have it. Rehearsing in three, two, one, and Graham.<eos> Each of you received an invitation to start the day, and each of you will receive an invitation to end it.<eos> All right, "A" camera, on Adam.<eos> - Let's do this.<eos> - Action. As you can see onstage, ladies, we have envelopes with your names on them.<eos> Two of these envelopes are empty, which means for a pair of you, sadly, it's time to go home.
Two of these envelopes are empty, which means for a pair of you, sadly, it's time to go home.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hell.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - You lied.<eos> - Whoa. - Come on. - You play me, I'll play you.<eos> Come on. - Camera 1, follow Athena.<eos> - Yeah, follow me.<eos> Athena. I am not stopping.<eos> I will tell you what happened.
It's gonna be so romantic.<eos> I always let her have the last word.<eos> Makes a marriage work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kelly's got, uh, one last request just to seal the deal.<eos> What do you say? Hey, whatever it takes.<eos> Here we go.<eos> You think they care about a black woman in America?<eos> Just try coming after me.<eos> I'm gonna tell you everything.
Chet stole "Everlasting" from both of us.<eos> It's your word against his.<eos> Well, unless you were to find your original look book.<eos> You have taken everything from me.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Some people think it's old-fashioned to ask a girl's family for her hand in marriage.<eos> But here at "Everlasting," chivalry is not dead.<eos> Adam will be going home with one lucky lady this week to meet her family in hopes of taking their relationship to the next level.<eos> Adam.<eos> Ladies, I wish I could go home with each and every one of you. But, um no, seriously, I, um...
So let's give them some hard-core Americana.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Okay, so I was thinking about a sweet, little mini rodeo followed up by a church dance... Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're working way too hard.<eos> Screw the rodeo and just get your "woof woof"<eos> to lose it to the big guy.<eos> Yeah, but she hasn't even admitted that she's a virgin yet, so...<eos> Well, then get her to.<eos> Come on, Goldy.<eos> It's 10k off your debt if you can pop her cherry in Dixie.<eos> Now the rest of you ladies will be making video invitations explaining to Adam why you would like him to meet your family.
Standby for Mary's video invite.<eos> Are these gonna be big enough for you?<eos> Throw away the cue cards.<eos> I've got a new script. - Great.<eos> Cheers. - No.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> All right, people. Mary's video invite, take one.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Okay, so, what do you need to sell this?<eos> I'm thinking, like, a silhouette in the window of the two of you taking your clothes off, and then just, you know, making some noises.
Except your laptop, that is.<eos> You have 24 hours to pay me or the MacBook goes on Craigslist.<eos> No. There's things on there that could hurt people.<eos> Great reason to pay me.<eos> I read your unsent sappy love e-mail.<eos> Bethany, stop. Jeremy is engaged to Lizzie now.<eos> I also found the crew list.<eos> Pay me by 10:00 P.M. or it goes live to all of them.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> So, this afternoon kicks off as all good dates do... with a cocktail party during which three of you will be chosen as guests for an intimate, romantic dinner.
Thank you so much.<eos> Everyone settle.<eos> Action.<eos> Ladies, it is now time for Roger to pick Adam's companion for the day-long date.<eos> Have you chosen well, Roger?<eos> Oh, indeed I have, Graham.<eos> Adam.<eos> Maya.<eos> Now it is time for the elimination round.<eos> Ladies, for five of you, this magical fairy tale ends tonight.
We'll deal with the family.<eos> You let your people know, but I want to zip this thing up airtight, all right?<eos> That means no Twitter<eos> - and no Instagram pics.<eos> - Got it. I'll be up there on the first flight in the morning, so you send the crew home but hold the cast.<eos> And I do not want a single frame shot until we are back up, understood?<eos> Okay. Brad, about how long are we talking about here?<eos> A week, a month... no idea, and I won't know until we get Legal up there and see what's happening.<eos> - Right, of... of course, but we don't want the cast<eos> - to stew on this. - Forget it, Quinn, okay? You're shut down.
Wagerstein: Oh, now that sounds like a very nice thing to do, ladies.<eos> You know, in the spirit of "Everlasting."<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> "In the spirit of 'Everlasting'"?<eos> They trap us in here like rats in a cage. They pit us up against each other. Nobody cares about anyone.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Yes, it is, and you know it.<eos> They count on us to lose it here.<eos> Mary killed herself because of this place.<eos> I mean, what is wrong with you people?
I got to make a... phone call.<eos> You should go get some sleep. - Mm? - You look like crap.<eos> Nothing a couple shots of tequila can't fix... or bottles.<eos> Ah, look who's back. Did you get some rest, sunshine?<eos> Well what was that about?<eos> You literally held me prisoner.<eos> You suck at poker, Shia, so I didn't want to put you in the position of having to bluff.<eos> Listen, the police... they ruled Mary's death a suicide, so there's not gonna be any more questions.<eos> Shia: Really?<eos> Is that all you care about?

Don't either of you feel guilty?
Hi!<eos> Oh, lil.<eos> Mommy!<eos> Oh. You know what? Who let shia talk me into this family playdate?<eos> Ugh. This is a grade-a boner-killer, people.<eos> Boner-killer!<eos> Louise, it's so good to see you.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> I bet you didn't even miss us.<eos> I miss you every minute.
And you guys, wait till you see what we have planned today.<eos> It is fantastic.<eos> [ laughs ]<eos> Mary, cheers. Thank you.<eos> Oh, is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, couldn't be happier. Look at me.<eos> [ laughs ]<eos> Virgin, silly. The real ones are for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, i'll give you the grand tour.
Camera "A," eyes up. WOMAN: Copy that.<eos> Her royal highness, the Duchess of Sandwich, Camille Cromwell.<eos> Young ladies, please take your seats.<eos> I will join you.<eos> [Clears throat] Who is that?<eos> It's his grandmother. How do you know that? Slut.<eos> Who here has slept with my grandson?<eos> [Coughs]<eos> So, Granny, which of these girls do you like?<eos> You just need a picture bride, a Kate Middleton, someone to make pretty babies and pose well.
Yes, of course. Yeah!<eos> - I love you, Adam. - And I love you. - QUINN:<eos> That is pretty good. Now go grab Anna before she gets hypnotized by that devil rock. Hey, can I talk to you?<eos> Sure, what's up?<eos> Everybody, um, I was just wondering if I could have your attention for a minute?<eos> Jeremy, what are you doing?<eos> I, uh, I think you guys know...<eos> A little bit too much, probably...<eos> About, uh, this woman and my relationship.<eos> You know that I love you, always will, and you'll never find anybody who loves you more.
I wouldn't coming down there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry he's such an idiot.<eos> "Unbutton your shirt," he said, like I'm a piece of meat.<eos> Listen, he's an idiot, but I really think that that was just, like, his version of trying to help you.<eos> Adam knows I'm hot.<eos> I have a brain and a heart.<eos> He needs to see that. You know something? It doesn't have to be either/or.<eos> I wouldn't shy away from the chemistry that you have with Adam because that is a very important part of a relationship.

And now that ice princess is pulling into the lead, and I'm just...<eos> Grace, you guys have had a connection since day one.
By the way, "Points" magazine just did a feature on her.<eos> I marked it on the off-chance you'd be curious to see what she says about you.<eos> "Part of my fascination with Grayson's choreography is how far he stretches the classical style to make it expressive and engaging."<eos> And she gets points for paying attention.<eos> She cites you as one of her greatest influences.<eos> I have to admit I always thought she had a certain... je ne sais quoi.<eos> Can we afford her?<eos> I'll make it work.<eos> Oh, God, look at her hair.<eos> Which one of you is Claire?
And... where is she?<eos> 122.<eos> If I called your number, you'll be staying to work at the barre.<eos> Everyone else, thank you for coming.<eos> Next group.<eos> And a-one and a-two, plié, passé.<eos> And a-one and a-two, plié, passé.<eos> Think!<eos> You don't think!<eos> I'll see you four one at a time for solo work.
Okay.<eos> First things first...<eos> Take your shoes off.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go. Take them off.<eos> Bare feet, please.<eos> Okay, everybody, please stand.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> How are you?
Pronate all the way through the arch, through the balls of the feet, through your toes.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Even slower than that.<eos> Let's stop looking in the mirror and start looking at each other.<eos> Really look.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stop where you are, close your eyes...<eos> And breathe for a moment.<eos> Feel the floor under your feet.<eos> Get in touch with all that is you.
I've corrupted you.<eos> It's...<eos> Yeah.<eos> My guests of honor.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Happy to be here.<eos> Ballerina.<eos> I'm so very joyful you are here.<eos> Come.<eos> I will show you where you will perform.
You've been seduced by all this emotional body/soul mumbo jumbo, this Cannavian witchcraft!<eos> Here's your accompaniment.<eos> Now do it again!<eos> 4, 5, 6!<eos> Ballet is a classical dance form, demanding grace and precision.<eos> Rigor!<eos> Craft!<eos> You will be lucky if you come anywhere close to perfection in your lifetime!<eos> We're done here.<eos> Each of you need to look deep inside and ask yourselves if this is where you belong.
It's hardly a secret to me.<eos> I've seen it thousands and thousands of times.<eos> Ross, Stop!<eos> Ross!<eos> Mishka!<eos> We had a girl.<eos> They said she was beautiful.<eos> They say you can't choose your family, but here at the American Ballet Company, we have done exactly that.<eos> We have disproved the platitude.<eos> I have chosen each and every one of you, and each and every one of you chooses to believe in me and in the mission of this miracle-making company.
I am fully committed to the removal of Captain Vane from that fort.<eos> You are talking about rendering Nassau completely unprotected.<eos> - I know.<eos> - What say you, Captain?<eos> Fire.<eos> It would appear we lost track of time.<eos> - Fire!<eos> Please.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> Surely you must realize this is a fruitless errand.
You're worried I'll challenge Flint.<eos> Well, the thought crossed my mind.<eos> But I'm hoping that once you have a moment to process all of this, you'll remember that you are the same man who when handed a blank page pulled from Mr. Singleton's corpse, stood by the captain for the sake of the bigger picture.<eos> Then you'll realize you were right then.<eos> And the same kind of perspective is what's called for now.<eos> Enough!<eos> I'm going to see my brothers now.<eos> Until I know what you're going to say to the men, I can't let you say anything to the men.<eos> He returns at last.<eos> It's good to have you back, Lieutenant.
The navy will do whatever Parliament tells it to do.<eos> We're in a time of war.<eos> If the Sea Lords were to recommend a change of strategy, who would ignore them?<eos> The war has got nothing to do with it.<eos> Doesn't it?<eos> Isn't a lawless Nassau a weakness that Spain could exploit?<eos> How would you do it?<eos> By offering our plan directly to the Sea Lords.<eos> Making our case to them.<eos> - They'd hear you?

I think Charles Vane is something you and I survived.<eos> What happens to him now is no longer of any concern to me.<eos> This morning, you and Max.<eos> You know what? I ain't got no right.<eos> We'll get through it.<eos> Always do, don't we?<eos> Steady.<eos> Stand.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, are you hurt?
And if I can identify the specific motive or not, I still come to expect that stench anytime you darken my door.<eos> Find Mr. Silver for me, if you please.<eos> Captain.<eos> You've explained to your men their responsibilities here?<eos> Aye, they know your plans to recover the gold must be kept secret and silent. If it were to be discovered by another crew, they could become competition for its retrieval.<eos> You know how to keep a secret between three men?<eos> Shoot two of them.<eos> What kind of fool tries to keep a secret amongst 100?<eos> The faster we retake the fort, the faster you'll be back on the water en route to the Urca with my men in your service.<eos> Even if the information were to be divulged that the gold is still to be won, even if another crew could discern its specific location, even if they could refit rapidly enough to get out there ahead of you,
I understand it all because I was there the day our lives ended and all of this began.<eos> But I have been devoted to you since that day.<eos> I have been loyal and protective and fucking committed to you since that day, and I am asking you to come with me so that I can save your life.<eos> There's an opportunity here today. An opportunity that may not present itself again.<eos> If we act right now, we can prevent a catastrophic loss to the Empire.<eos> We can make England stronger tomorrow than she is today.<eos> We can save Nassau and all it takes is for us to do a very reasonable thing.<eos> Military pardons?<eos> I know how it will be perceived, sir.<eos> I know how it looks for me to even raise the subject with you here.

Lord Hamilton isn't someone we should be wary of, he is exactly the kind of man we should be listening to.<eos> On the day I was made an officer, you pulled me aside.<eos> You told me how proud you were of me.<eos> You told me that a measure of a man is in the moment when he is confronted by himself.<eos> By opposing voices in his head, both arguing that they are right, but one has to be wrong.<eos> To know the difference in that moment, that is what makes an officer.<eos> What makes a man.<eos> Well, I see the difference here, sir.<eos> I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did.
Well, I see the difference here, sir.<eos> I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did.<eos> And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I would like to defend you.<eos> I would like to remind myself that every man has his flaws, his weaknesses that torment him.<eos> I would like to help you recover from yours.
No charges will be drawn against you provided you leave London quietly and are neither seen nor heard from again.<eos> If either the earl or I feel that this bargain has been breached, the charges brought against you will be swift and unyielding.<eos> Where's Thomas?<eos> They came.<eos> The earl's men.<eos> It happened quickly before I could do anything to stop it.<eos> - They took him. - Took him?<eos> Took him where?<eos> Bethlem Royal Hospital.<eos> He is to be committed there, owing to his uncontrollable grief over having learned of my affair with you.
- They took him. - Took him?<eos> Took him where?<eos> Bethlem Royal Hospital.<eos> He is to be committed there, owing to his uncontrollable grief over having learned of my affair with you.<eos> - Our affair?<eos> - That is what the story will be.<eos> I have been given until nightfall to vacate this house. And then you and I are to disappear.<eos> I have friends in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels.<eos> I can get you set up comfortably.<eos> Perhaps at some point, I can figure out a way to get you back here.
- You think you're angry about this?<eos> - I'm beyond that.<eos> He is my husband.<eos> Before they took him away, he made me promise him... that no matter what happened next, that you and I... would take care of each other.<eos> The danger here is real.<eos> Thomas is gone.<eos> And now you and I must leave this place.<eos> We need to get you moving.<eos> When we get to the harbor, I'll arrange passage for you.<eos> Anything you need that you don't have, I'll see sent to you.

Perhaps even mutually exclude each other.<eos> - I will make it work. - How could you possibly?<eos> I don't know... yet.<eos> He agreed.<eos> He agreed?<eos> Abigail Ashe will be surrendered to you in exchange for which you will agree to make no further move against him or the fort.<eos> He lives.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm having a difficult time believing that he agreed.<eos> He agreed, he didn't agree. What difference does it make?<eos> I am guaranteeing that the exchange you offered will be honored.
He lives.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm having a difficult time believing that he agreed.<eos> He agreed, he didn't agree. What difference does it make?<eos> I am guaranteeing that the exchange you offered will be honored.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You want me to go to my men and deny them a fight that I have led them to believe is critical for the future of this place and do so based upon your word that Charles Vane will compensate them for it?<eos> That is exactly what I'm asking you to do.<eos> I'll say it again.<eos> I am guaranteeing the terms of this deal.<eos> If you deliver on your promise, if you prevent any further attack on the fort, I will bring the girl down from the hill and deliver her to you.
Yeah.<eos> The shit half.<eos> You get the tobacco and sugar and I get what?<eos> Blankets, pots and pans.<eos> Your half of the tonnage is worth nine-tenths the value.<eos> It's closer to four-fifths.<eos> We agreed we would reach a reasonable settlement here. As in an equitable result.<eos> As in a result based on reason.<eos> Had we come to blows over this prize, there's no doubt my men would have won it whole.<eos> I'm offering you a meaningful share just for having got here first.
So Vane stays in the fort.<eos> A fort with no ability to threaten the bay for weeks, if not months.<eos> And therefore no ability to stop us bringing back the Urca gold safely.<eos> As for Vane, I don't like leaving him up there any more than you do.<eos> It's an awful compromise to be sure, but one well worth making given what is being offered in return and what it promises for the future of this place.<eos> How unsurprising that you cast aside our arrangement the first moment it suited your whim.<eos> My priority has always been and will always be the welfare of my men.<eos> And your good word being no priority at all it would seem.<eos> A hard choice, sir, but one that any responsible captain must make given the changing circumstances.<eos> I'm only sorry that you cannot see past your own pride to join me.

You cannot imagine what I've sacrificed to gain this captaincy.<eos> I may have lost the only person in the world I cared for to gain this captaincy.<eos> I cannot lose it.<eos> Not so soon. Not like this.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is likely the most reasonable distribution given our relative strengths.<eos> Then can we consider ourselves in agreement about our terms?<eos> With one or two small adjustments, if you wouldn't mind hearing me out.<eos> Of course.<eos> For what little comfort it may provide right now, I believe you've made the right decision.
Yes.<eos> So what happens if we win the vote and the gold isn't delivered in a timely fashion?<eos> Vane reneges. Delays to achieve better terms. Certainly these are plausible outcomes.<eos> How long do we wait for the situation to resolve itself?<eos> The gold is still a priority.<eos> There's been no change in that.<eos> You have my word.<eos> That's all I needed to hear.<eos> I should get to work.<eos> I'll keep you apprised of the numbers.
Battle Creek Police.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's blurry.<eos> It's a phone... it doesn't have an optical zoom.<eos> It's blurry!<eos> It's useless!<eos> - I'm gonna die because you guys...! - Shh, come on, hey, hey.
- She had to go back.<eos> She can't risk showing up late for work.<eos> He got pinned between the truck and the Dumpster.<eos> - We should take him down to the hospital.<eos> - So they can execute him?<eos> What happened at the fence?<eos> Two got away, four got taken...<eos> - and Kate's in jail.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Look, I really want to help you guys, but I can't stay.
The King needs you.<eos> You will not reject me at my hour of need.<eos> I detest politics and have no talent for diplomacy.<eos> Such things can be learned.<eos> The council will benefit from your wisdom and common sense.<eos> There are men more able than I.<eos> I beg Your Majesty to choose one of them.<eos> I did not expect you to abandon me in my hour of need.<eos> I am not the Cardinal, sire.<eos> I could not serve you as he did.
You would be wise to listen...<eos> Who do you think you are talking to?<eos> Never insult the King again in my presence.<eos> Will you let this outrage pass?<eos> Frankly, I wish I'd done it myself.<eos> You're a dangerous man, Rochefort, but an entertaining one.<eos> Now, what is this urgent news of yours?<eos> If I might speak to Your Majesty in private?<eos> Constance, I'm so glad you're here.<eos> D'Artagnan speaks of you in glowing terms.

You do want to come? Very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I will see to the arrangements.<eos> Monsieur Bonacieux, how are things in the drapery business?<eos> Should I be buying wool or silk this season?<eos> It's so unseasonably cold.<eos> Wool is always the most versatile of cloths. Oh, really, is it?<eos> That's good to know.<eos> - I hope you're well, madame.

The King gave me his authority.<eos> The day my men take orders from the Cardinal's stooge is the day I resign my commission.<eos> For the sake of France, we must find a way to work together.<eos> I accept your terms.<eos> The last person the Spanish will expect to see is their old prisoner, Rochefort.<eos> Naturally, they'll be grateful to the bandits who bring him in.<eos> You will be the bandits, of course.<eos> If we're caught out of uniform, we'll be treated as spies.<eos> That means instant execution.<eos> Well, if that prospect scares you...
It was a routine patrol.<eos> Did he get word back to the castle?<eos> He says he will only answer to God now, not some French...<eos> Well, then he questioned our parentage.<eos> Go with God.<eos> Let's take their uniforms. The castle guards will think we're a Spanish patrol.<eos> If they heard our shots up at the castle, they'll be ready for us.<eos> We have to continue, no matter what the risk. We've come this far.<eos> You don't need to remind us of our duty.<eos> And if I tell you to shoot, you do it.
We should take their horses, too.<eos> Give ours a rest.<eos> What about D'Artagnan?<eos> If he's alive, he'll find us.<eos> Please don't be alarmed.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Keep away.<eos> Don't worry, I'm a gentleman.<eos> You're undressed!<eos> Not for your benefit, I can assure you.
One?<eos> - Where is Rochefort now?<eos> -I heard shooting,<eos> I have no idea what happened to him or my friends.<eos> - So, they might all be dead?<eos> Something is wrong, General?<eos> You do not like chess?<eos> On the contrary, I don't like you.<eos> Is this polite, General?<eos> Have I not been a friend to you?
If there was, I'd know.<eos> They sometimes bring in supplies at the back of the castle.<eos> There might be a gate there.<eos> One stupid move and you die.<eos> This is not what we agreed. Your escorts should be dead.<eos> Whose fault is that?<eos> Only you and De Foix were allowed to escape. No one else.<eos> Those were my orders.<eos> Then you better pray your men do a better job this time.<eos> Get up, damn you!
With the Cardinal gone, I thought our world would be safer.<eos> Now I'm not so sure.<eos> Given that your plan failed in so many respects, you have done well.<eos> Sadly, a dozen men died.<eos> The Musketeers proved more resourceful than I expected.<eos> Alvarez was a good man.<eos> His death was never part of our bargain.<eos> The fewer people who know my true allegiance, the better.<eos> And that is not your decision to make.<eos> I promised you I would win the confidence of the King.
Where does this lead?<eos> Just out the back.<eos> These cobbles look like they've been scrubbed clean, look. Yeah, definitely.<eos> Blood?<eos> Look at this.<eos> The handle's been sawn off.<eos> Ah, once you're out here there's no way back in.<eos> It's just a missing door handle, that's all. It's nothing sinister.<eos> Your last chance.<eos> If I could help you, I would.

But LeMaitre was caught and sentenced to hard labour in the colonies.<eos> It can't be him?<eos> - Yeah, wasn't his brother a...<eos> - Blacksmith?<eos> We're looking for your brother.<eos> Try the Americas.<eos> We've heard he's back in Paris.<eos> If he was back here I'd know.<eos> He'd have come to see me.<eos> I wouldn't tell you about it, but I'd have seen him.
Hey, LeMaitre can avoid the main roads by taking the Forest of Evreux.<eos> And then from Rouen, travel by river to the port.<eos> The ship in Honfleur, when is it scheduled to leave?<eos> Tomorrow evening.<eos> We'll catch them at Rouen.<eos> I told you never to come here, ever!<eos> The Musketeers know about Sebastian. They're searching for him now!<eos> - Was my name mentioned? - No.<eos> No.<eos> If anything comes back on me, I'll come down there and kill you all!
No.<eos> Your men should never have taken him to that tavern. It was reckless!<eos> And now he is in the hands of criminals.<eos> So...<eos> What now?<eos> Rochefort?<eos> If the Musketeers are confident of returning the King, we should allow them to complete their task.<eos> The city is quiet.<eos> Everyone believes the King has a mild head cold and is confined to his rooms.<eos> Rochefort's swift response has bought you time, Captain.
His father will be there.<eos> Captain!<eos> Why was the King taken?<eos> Between ourselves, no need to worry the Queen any more than necessary.<eos> The man who abducted the King is a convicted criminal.<eos> He sells his captives to the Spanish, to be used as galley slaves.<eos> We suspect he has no idea who he's taken.<eos> You don't suspect the Spanish themselves?<eos> In this case, no.<eos> I have complete faith in you, Captain.
What about me?<eos> And all we have planned?<eos> I am making great strides with the Queen.<eos> Already she trusts me.<eos> And this way we can achieve in one night what might take you a decade.<eos> Say you do kill Louis?<eos> What then?<eos> There will be chaos.<eos> Anne will be Regent to the young Dauphin.<eos> That should suit you.
He's very fair-minded and generous and clever.<eos> He's a buffoon.<eos> Preening and prancing in his palace, totally ignorant of the people that he governs.<eos> Louis is our King, and a good man.<eos> He deserves our respect.<eos> Good to see you, brother.<eos> Gus sent me.<eos> The Musketeers are searching for you.<eos> Then you better make sure you stop them.<eos> Madame Bonacieux. The way I spoke to you before was inexcusable.
My father was a great king, much-loved.<eos> Always found wanting, compared to him. I know that.<eos> I was only eight when he was assassinated.<eos> A child, fatherless.<eos> Robbed of so much.<eos> It's not the hardship of the galleys that I dread the most.<eos> It is a life apart from my son.<eos> Your father?<eos> He was killed when we came to Paris.<eos> When you were a boy, he taught you things?
It's impossible.<eos> I saw him.<eos> His clothes.<eos> - He was just another drunken idiot.<eos> - That drunken idiot was the King.<eos> Why do you think the Musketeers are so desperate to find him?<eos> And when they catch LeMaitre, he'll give you up to save his skin.<eos> They can't hang me.<eos> I didn't know he was the King.<eos> Of course they won't hang you.

Until we are certain that we are safe.<eos> When I was a boy and I was tired my valet would carry me.<eos> My father carried me.<eos> Sometimes I'd pretend I couldn't walk another step. Just to be in his arms.<eos> That's only because you didn't have a valet.<eos> - No, no! Wait! - Ahhh!<eos> Your Majesty, you all right?<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> Don't shoot me!<eos> I'll tell you everything!
It's Gus! Not me!<eos> It was all his idea.<eos> He's in charge.<eos> Your brother's camp, where is it?<eos> A mile south, by the river.<eos> Now for God's sake, get this thing off me!<eos> Oi! Come here!<eos> Kill everyone in the camp!<eos> Shoot anything that moves!<eos> I promise you, this kindness will be repaid a hundredfold.
Get up! Come on!<eos> Pepin, come on.<eos> Pepin, get up!<eos> After them!<eos> I thought you'd never stop running.<eos> Quickly, we must hurry.<eos> Find LeMaitre!<eos> No one gets away!<eos> No one gets away.<eos> It is the right decision for you and France.
He wanted a taste of the real world, and he didn't like it.<eos> And someone has to be to blame.<eos> That would be us.<eos> - Madame Pepin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> My name is D'Artagnan, of the King's Musketeers.<eos> I'm here about your husband.<eos> Is he safe?<eos> He died in service of the Crown, fighting to protect the King.<eos> His Majesty sent me here today to give you this. To express his personal gratitude.

Submerge your heart ... calm your Chi.<eos> Unsheathe your sword!<eos> It's sheathed in your spine!<eos> Drink this holy elixer, it will ease your symptoms.<eos> To slay demons, you must first purge your heart of demons.<eos> Master!<eos> Behold! Who says humans can't defeat demons?<eos> Today, you are the victors, or today you have triumphed.<eos> The Dark Crystal is yours now, and a new world is upon us!<eos> In seven days, on the night of the full moon... your spirits will return to you!
My sole desire is to make a great contribution ... to the glory of our Tang Empire.<eos> May I come in?<eos> I was in a great hurry, but alas encountered a blizzard.<eos> My Lady, your hands are so cold!<eos> My name is Little Snow, I've been icy cold since birth.<eos> It's so cold in here.<eos> I don't have a fire basin.<eos> You're studying so you can better serve the glory of the Tang Dynasty, right?<eos> How do you know that, my Lady?<eos> Can you even remember all these books you've read?
He's delusional, Gina.<eos> Him and his brother were psychotically close.<eos> I can't imagine what losing Luke has done to his fractured mind.<eos> But I do know who his next target's gonna look like--<eos> Lily Gray.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why would he sit this one out?<eos> I'd unleash hell on earth if you got killed.<eos> I guess Mark's just a little more sensitive than you.<eos> Why am I letting you guys have all the fun?
- All right.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Look, here are the packets.<eos> You take a packet... you dip it in the oil and swallow it.<eos> Easy, right?<eos> You swallow 50, and I pay you $10,000.<eos> All right?<eos> But with you two, we have a problem.

You do.<eos> No, you can see her later.<eos> Go back to your room... and vvait.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Am I alive or dead?<eos> - You're a little dazed, but alive.<eos> You're with friends, dorft be afraid.<eos> Yes, you have fought off your illness.<eos> My doctor examined you, he says you're weak but you'll get better.<eos> And vve will help you.

Go on, get back to work.<eos> Bruno...<eos> What did you say that stone was called?<eos> Heliotrope.<eos> It gets its name from the sun because its magic powers come from the surfs rays.<eos> - And he who finds it...<eos> - Becomes invisible.<eos> Invisible?<eos> I clon't believe that, Buffalmaooo!<eos> They were fooling you.
Right!<eos> For every end you need a finale!<eos> Friends!<eos> Have you forgotten?<eos> - We need to bake some bread.<eos> - I'm coming!<eos> I just Wanted to say I know a bit about farmhouse chores.<eos> My grandparents were country folks.<eos> And when I was a child, in summer, I would watch them baking.<eos> So, if you trust me, I can help you.
You should see the crest he's working on for us.<eos> Pity I will lose him one of these days.<eos> Why will you lose him?<eos> He's too talented, vvord has gotten out to the Workshops.<eos> You brought him up, educated him, and you'd let him go?<eos> - It's not like you.<eos> - I'm happy for him.<eos> He deserves it.<eos> May Florence admire him!<eos> I've been expecting you.
On your knees.<eos> Cursed by God!<eos> Go on, tremble...<eos> In some corner of hell they're making room for you.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> What sin could be more shameful than to ruin the reputation of this convent, sanctified over centuries?<eos> Your own convent, my daughters.<eos> You honor it with your prayers, with your purity, and this sister of yours has sullied it with her shame.<eos> And we're supposed to blush before the eyes of God and the world for your sake?<eos> We can make you disappear, you've no idea What vve can do.

Mama, look at the falcon up there.<eos> If you get him for me, I promise I will get better.<eos> You're lovely!<eos> He's a hunter too, you knovv, like your falcon.<eos> But I Want to hold the falcon.<eos> And What will vve do with this puppy?<eos> I'm here... My son Rinuccio...<eos> Forgive me, I'd like to sit dovvn.<eos> It's hot today, isn't it'?<eos> I've come here, Federico, hovv can I put it... to compensate you for the damage your love for me has caused.

What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You've gone as white as a sheet.<eos> - I live on my own here.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> I cook my ovvn food.<eos> Yes, the game you hunt with your falcon, I knew that too.<eos> - You're very good.<eos> - it's not the hunting season now.<eos> - I'll help you.
- I'll help you.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Wait here, please.<eos> Or over there, the view's better.<eos> I'll go and prepare something.<eos> Help me.<eos> What do I do?<eos> She's come to my home to ask me for something simple, and I...<eos> She vvorft come again.<eos> You'll be surprised, Federico... when I tell you my little boy...
She vvorft come again.<eos> You'll be surprised, Federico... when I tell you my little boy...<eos> When do I tell him?<eos> Before or after we've eaten?<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> This linerfs nice.<eos> The tablecloths nice too.<eos> What is it, Gubbio linen?<eos> Why haven't you eaten anything?<eos> Arerft you feeling Well?

- Yes.<eos> There are no falcons here.<eos> You dorft Want to, eh?<eos> I see, Federico.<eos> There's my falcon.<eos> Federico degli Alberighi!<eos> We're Monna Giovannafs brothers.<eos> No, let's talk here.<eos> I am Ricciardo, the eldest, and the first to speak.<eos> I'll be honest with you, we came here reluctantly.
Magistrates to maintain order.<eos> Carpenters to raise buildings.<eos> Clergy to raise spirits.<eos> Foodstuffs to sustain them all for six months, perhaps a year.<eos> Three ships to transport it all, sailors to sail them.<eos> And an honest governor, the first in recent memory, to oversee it all.<eos> In short, you'd be assembling a colony, boarding it onto ships, transporting it across the Atlantic, and hoping that when it arrives, it takes to an environment that has resisted every attempt at stable commerce for the past 50 years.<eos> Oh, and then there are the pirates that we've agreed not to discuss.<eos> Are you sure three ships would be enough?<eos> My lord, I feel I have to be honest with you.
But being a pirate on this crew for a little while longer, it offers me an opportunity I don't believe I can find anywhere else on Earth... one big prize.<eos> And with it, freedom.<eos> From water, from Randall, from hunger, from wages... from you.<eos> Just one question.<eos> In approximately two days' time, when we arrive back at Nassau, you and I will both be unceremoniously expelled from this ship.<eos> That would seem to be an impediment to your plan.<eos> In less than two days, I intend to be a captain again.<eos> I suggest you find a way of earning your way back onto this crew as well.<eos> Captain, a word, please.<eos> Mr. Meeks, how can I help you?
Yes?<eos> A moment, if I may?<eos> Of course.<eos> Have you read any of these?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> A shelf of books, so many lives unled... so many possibilities.<eos> I glanced, but nothing rang familiar.<eos> Nor for me.<eos> You know the irony of all this?<eos> When we first found you, I was the one who saw the promise in acquiring you and Mr. Gates was the one who opposed it.
Found them harder to keep in line, more resistant to persuasion.<eos> I prevailed.<eos> What was your argument?<eos> That I was tired of being the only one he had a hard time keeping in line.<eos> Mr. Flint, I'm sorry, but I have a tremendous amount of preparations...<eos> It's killing me... what happened.<eos> What I did to Mr. Gates.<eos> I keep on replaying it in my mind every waking moment, trying to see another way.<eos> I don't expect you to understand, but I need you to know that no one on this ship feels his loss more keenly than I do.<eos> I know he developed a great affection for you.

Jesus.<eos> That's worse.<eos> You might like him, sir.<eos> Actually, I went to one of those salons of his, the ones that half the Royal Society attend but most deny.<eos> Most of those men are pretenders, sir, attracted to his ideas because they make them feel like radicals.<eos> But Thomas... when he talks about the need to rethink things, systemic things, I think he truly believes what he's saying.<eos> And what's more, I'm afraid I might believe a good deal of it as well. Thomas?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> He refuses to stand on ceremony, insists on the familiar.<eos> I know what you're thinking, but I assure you, sir, my judgment, as it relates to this assignment, is still intact.
Apologies.<eos> Perhaps it's my jealousy showing.<eos> Liaison to the Hamilton family, that's quite an appointment.<eos> Congratulations, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I must say, I thought myself quite qualified, but then I suppose perhaps for this particular assignment, you were the better man.<eos> Of course, I can understand how it would be of such importance to you.<eos> Someone of your station...<eos> son of a carpenter's mate given a chance to socialize with a lord.<eos> Hold that position for long enough and you might convince everyone you're something more than you actually are.
Only one way to find out.<eos> Anyone up for a little hunting?<eos> I'm sorry, you were saying something about your judgment on this matter remaining intact.<eos> I apologize, sir.<eos> Good sense escaped me for a moment.<eos> An insult to the man's wife that had to be answered.<eos> It reflects not upon my fitness to continue handling Lord Hamilton.<eos> I know how important this posting is.<eos> I know you know.<eos> My concern with you is over that which cannot be known.

Raise the black too soon and the prize will run.<eos> Raise it too late and you'll induce panic and a greater chance of resistance.<eos> You ought to show your colors at just the right moment to get them to strike theirs.<eos> Raise the black.<eos> Raise the black!<eos> Gun crews at the ready.<eos> Hold your breath, lads.<eos> They struck their colors.<eos> See?<eos> I told you.
How am I going to explain to my proprietors that I gave up their goods without a fight?<eos> What kind of man am I?<eos> You hope he has answers to those questions.<eos> You hope that he can reassure himself that he made the right decision.<eos> You hope that he doesn't realize that the thing that he thought he was surrendering to... the thing that drove fear into his heart the moment he saw the black... that that thing is nowhere to be found.<eos> Are you him?<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> I said are you him?<eos> Are you Captain Flint?<eos> I assure you, sir, you do not want to test us.
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.<eos> And one more thing... darling, I can understand why you wouldn't want to tell me about this, but please know that all I have ever wanted for you is to be happy.<eos> Come to bed when you're through.<eos> Was it close?<eos> The vote.<eos> It was.<eos> I suppose you warned me... didn't you?<eos> To avoid that course through the shipping lanes.<eos> Perhaps it was my hubris that drove me to it.<eos> To show you I had it in me to lead.
What about?<eos> It's all right. It has nothing to do with you and I.<eos> He'll be arriving in less than two hours.<eos> I'm sorry, who?<eos> The fourth Earl of Ashbourne.<eos> Lord Proprietor to the Carolina colony, including the Bahama Islands, and peer of the realm.<eos> Lord Alfred Hamilton.<eos> My father.<eos> I'm told he expects a full report of our efforts to devise a plan for the management of Nassau.<eos> And you're concerned how he'll receive it?
Give us the room.<eos> - I have as much right...<eos> "You must ask yourselves who represents"<eos> the greater threat to your interests... my men in this fort "or the madman on the water."<eos> It's effective.<eos> Mm, I can see that.<eos> What I cannot see is how Charles Vane alone was clever enough to turn this all into political theater in which he is the defender of the island's welfare.<eos> Are you suggesting he had help in crafting his reply?<eos> Did he?<eos> Were I to have aided Captain Vane against your efforts, helped him move into a more favorable position last night, what would such a move say about the trust you and I are supposed to share?
And I am perfectly aware of the danger that presents.<eos> But when it comes to Charles Vane, you and I simply do not see him in the same way.<eos> Now, if you can see a way, an effective, credible way out of this that doesn't involve disabling the fort, I would love to hear it.<eos> If you think that he will hear reason.<eos> Not with you holding a gun to his head.<eos> Then I suggest you talk to him.<eos> Because one way or another, he is leaving that fort.<eos> And right now my way is the only way that I can be certain of that.<eos> My name is Charles Vane and you are now my guest.<eos> As such, no harm will come to you as long as you do exactly as I say.
I've been at school in London.<eos> What?<eos> I'm asking if there's any reason I should expect he may not be willing to pay to ensure no harm comes to you?<eos> You're asking if he loves me?<eos> He'll pay you what you ask.<eos> Can you write?<eos> Of course.<eos> Then write the following.<eos> You're a prisoner of the pirate Captain Charles Vane.<eos> Your ransom, should your father ever wish to see you alive again, is £250,000.

Can I assume when you say you'll go to the beach to make this appeal, you mean me?<eos> All right, then.<eos> Why do you think they went up that hill?<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> If we're to stop any more men from joining his side, isn't it a prerequisite that we try and understand the thinking of the men who have already joined him?<eos> Sorry, are you asking my opinion?<eos> Well, uh... I suppose one could argue that it's simple fear.<eos> Their fear of losing the fort being greater than their fear of Vane remaining in it.<eos> But then again, it's possible this has nothing to do with the fort. Nor with Vane.<eos> Perhaps it's just them expressing their opinions about you.

- The island needs commerce to survive. It needs labor.<eos> It needs men and women vested in its interest. Don't these men fit that description?<eos> Couldn't they become part of the solution?<eos> You don't need me to answer that.<eos> - They're men. - They're traitors to the Crown.<eos> - What difference does that make?<eos> - Makes some difference to the Crown.<eos> To pardon a traitor is the act of a coward.<eos> And given our current war footing, precisely no one in Whitehall wants to wear that label right now.<eos> If you propose this to your father, he will almost certainly distance himself from it and most likely from you.

Well, I guess one of them must have gotten away.<eos> So what do you make of this business between Captains Flint and Vane?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lovely performance.<eos> Hello, friend.<eos> Man around the bend has something to say about this business at the fort.<eos> The fuck's going on in there?<eos> Pulled a man out of the water.<eos> Up by the north point. That's lucky.<eos> We were just about to send for one of you.
We're not supporting it, we're relaying it.<eos> With all due respect, I can't see the difference.<eos> I think I can live with that.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> The only one who can stop this is Flint.<eos> I'll just have to find someone to convince him.<eos> He's moving in a direction that promises unimaginable chaos.<eos> He won't listen to me, but perhaps he would listen to an appeal from you.<eos> I appreciate your frustration.<eos> Were there something I could do to help, I assure you I would.

The men in charge had allowed it to fall into disrepair.<eos> Please, help me to dissuade him from putting us on that path again.<eos> If you're concerned for your safety, perhaps you should request sanctuary along with your father at the Underhill estate.<eos> I'd be happy to carry the message.<eos> You think this is about me?<eos> You asked me for my help yesterday with Mr. Underhill.<eos> You asked me today again for my help, but I'm sorry, what you ask is simply impossible.<eos> You don't give a shit about the rest of us, fine.<eos> But Flint.<eos> Don't you care enough about him to at least try to stop him from doing this?
A war, sir, to ensure that a Protestant sits on the throne of Spain.<eos> Thomas, if I were a rival of this family, I would be shouting from the rooftops that any man who proposes to pardon a traitor in times such as these is himself a traitor.<eos> We are fighting a war in the service of the son of God.<eos> And it is treason to offer forgiveness to any man who would seek it?<eos> What in the hell is it you think we're doing here?<eos> This isn't your goddamn salon, Thomas.<eos> If you do not forgive men their sins, your father will not forgive your sins.<eos> - I don't want to hear it! - I know you don't.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> I'll ask you once again, am I to assume by your silence that you are in agreement with this proposal?
I find his intent to be good and true.<eos> And I find yours wanting, sir.<eos> I will be relaying my findings to Admiral Hennessey in short order.<eos> And now I think it's time you left, sir.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Did you just ask my father to leave his own house?<eos> Right now he will be dispatching messages to the Sea Lords, the Southern Secretary, his friends in the Privy Council.<eos> He will stop at nothing to ensure that this plan never sees the light of day.<eos> And now you're in the line of fire.<eos> People can say what they like about you.
And now you're in the line of fire.<eos> People can say what they like about you.<eos> But you're a good man.<eos> More people should say that.<eos> And someone should be willing to defend it.<eos> Pastor.<eos> It's before dawn.<eos> I don't sleep anymore.<eos> I've seen you at my service.<eos> I've kept my distance, but I've seen you there.
A few hours ago, I informed my father that this was my intended solution for the pirate issue on New Providence Island.<eos> We've talked in this room, you and I, about reason.<eos> We've talked about justice.<eos> We've talked about virtue and the right.<eos> We've talked and talked.<eos> And now, perhaps, it is time to do that which we've only spoken about behind closed doors.<eos> I am committed to this end.<eos> But it is a long road and I will need your help to see it through.<eos> How can I help?<eos> I don't believe you've been properly introduced.
I'd never seen a structure like it.<eos> It seemed indestructible.<eos> If you would have told me then the decision you face today, I don't know if I would have believed it possible.<eos> Richard Guthrie sat on the throne of commerce when I arrived.<eos> Made men rich, they said.<eos> Then his daughter took his place, made Nassau strong.<eos> Everyone knows this.<eos> I wonder how many know that there was one man standing behind them.<eos> Standing behind both thrones, keeping the world spinning.<eos> You're as invested in the future of this place as any.
Sheldon, shh.<eos> The wedding's starting.<eos> I see what's happening.<eos> Sides are forming.<eos> Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.<eos> I'm not taking sides.<eos> Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.<eos> Really?<eos> At least you got picked.<eos> Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?
You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy.<eos> You're immature, you're selfish, you just insulted me to my face.<eos> I don't need any more time to think.<eos> We're broken up.<eos> Amy...<eos> Will someone take me home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on, I'll give you a ride.<eos> ...symbolizes your eternal love.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Are you?<eos> Do we have the resources, or should I request assistance from the mainland?<eos> I can handle this.<eos> You were drinking.<eos> Hildur, I was off duty.<eos> If the murder team come over from the mainland, they'll be looking at you, Hildur, won't they?<eos> Charlie wouldn't give you the glacier.<eos> Our missing girl's name is Natalie Yelburton... 29 years old.<eos> You all have her picture.<eos> Many of you know her... friends of hers.

It was all their idea.<eos> - Right, kids?<eos> - Cake! Cake! Cake!<eos> Cake! Cake! - Okay, okay.<eos> Cake! Cake! Cake!<eos> Cake! Cake!<eos> Oh, look at that beautiful looking cake!<eos> Who did this to monster!<eos> Oh, you can't hide from monster!<eos> Monster can smell you!
Okay.<eos> Still, it's extremely fragile and I don't trust those movers after the mess they made at the gallery.<eos> Mmm-mmm.<eos> No, I'll take care of it.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Okay, gracias, I'll have it all packed up for you.<eos> Okay. It's almost dry though.<eos> Yeah, so I'll just text you when it's at the gallery.<eos> Don't worry about anything,<eos> I got it all under control. You have a good weekend at the beach.
Looks like everyone's gone for the long weekend.<eos> The Gregorys?<eos> No, I don't know anyone around here by that name.<eos> What's the address?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> My phone got wet and she left hers at her house.<eos> The taxi just dropped us here.<eos> We've been walking around for, like, 20 minutes.<eos> Yeah, my feet are, like, dying.<eos> Well, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you.
Thank you.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Oh, I don't mind.<eos> We don't want to mess up your house.<eos> Yeah. Excuse me.<eos> Um, thank you so, so much.<eos> - I know this is so random.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> Hang on, I'll get you an iPad and some towels.
I'm Bel, by the way.<eos> Evan.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Ashley's online.<eos> Cool.<eos> You're a life saver, Evan.<eos> Not everyone would just let two total strangers into their house these days.<eos> Well, you don't look that dangerous.<eos> Worst case scenario, I know I can take the both of you.
Thank you so much, Evan.<eos> You're welcome...<eos> - Genesis.<eos> - Genesis.<eos> Yeah, like the beginning of time.<eos> In the beginning.<eos> Sorry. Yup, that was...<eos> You're sick of that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll, uh... I'll go get you some.
Sorry. Yup, that was...<eos> You're sick of that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll, uh... I'll go get you some.<eos> Hey, Evan?<eos> Where should we put these?<eos> Oh, I'll take them.<eos> No, we can do it. We don't mind.<eos> I got it.<eos> I made you some tea.
Death?<eos> You're gonna kill me?<eos> You're gonna fucking kill me!<eos> Why?<eos> Why! Because I fucked you?<eos> You fucked me!<eos> You fucked me!<eos> You came to my house!<eos> You came to me!<eos> I got you a car, I brought you your clothes, you took a fucking bubble bath!
It just shows up at my fucking door!<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> "We're flight attendants.<eos> Come on, fuck us!<eos> No one will know.<eos> Come on, fuck us!"<eos> Oh, twosomes, threesomes. It doesn't matter!<eos> Starfish! Husbands!<eos> You don't give a fuck, you'll just fuck anything, you'll just fuck anything!<eos> Well, you lied to me, I tried to help you!
- No, no, no, Evan! - You broke the rule.<eos> - Evan, why did you do that?<eos> Well, now she'll fucking find you!<eos> Not really.<eos> I hung up as soon as it hit voice mail.<eos> I knew you'd pussy out.<eos> You fucking whores!<eos> You fucking whores!<eos> I'll fucking kill you, you fucking-fuck bitch cunt!<eos> I'll fucking kill you! You fucking bitches!
There was no other way.<eos> Others never forgave me so that was the end. Red thorns.<eos> Heroes do what others can not.<eos> Not because I want. Not for themselves and their friends.<eos> They choose the path that nobody wants. More dark roads.<eos> You can do that?<eos> Yes I think so.<eos> All right.<eos> For you.<eos> Thank you.
Discount!<eos> Discount?<eos> Wait wait.<eos> Stop joking.<eos> We go somewhere, get out of here.<eos> You and I. We're going for a walk.<eos> Do not. I have to go.<eos> Red thorns.<eos> Another beer.<eos> You must have lost its sense if you do not quit.
I seem so callous?<eos> You have never taken seriously Dagen affection for you.<eos> Purio have business with the captain.<eos> The Purio captain is a little busy today fighting.<eos> Only matters of war pass this point.<eos> CAPTAIN want to see me. I assure you.<eos> You can spend.<eos> But only you.<eos> Do not.<eos> I'm with you.
Up there if he dies before we get there, our track ran out.<eos> Along with the Mission. Along with your friend 's life.<eos> Water.<eos> So thirsty.<eos> Purio Where is the captain?<eos> Please.<eos> Enough!<eos> Where?<eos> In the shop of the wounded.<eos> What brings you to this hell?
Wait, eel is my friend.<eos> To share the secrets of their wanderings to require accounts.<eos> If I give you to the eel, he cut me out of the supply chain.<eos> Please, Captain.<eos> You kill me?<eos> Morire plague anyway.<eos> If the worms do not kill me first.<eos> I need to find eel.<eos> It is the key to saving a dear friend.<eos> He makes a sweet girl like you working with a slug like betylla?
The gods will take care of you fail.<eos> You choses them?<eos> Gods can do to stop me.<eos> When I have viday power over death?<eos> I'm not afraid of dying.<eos> This amuses me.<eos> Those willing to die, even marek. Although eventually it will be the cause of your own destruction.<eos> You know this is true.<eos> And still you can not help but serve their purpose.<eos> She never. It will help you.
– Yes, just about.<eos> The family will take the ferry today and I'll work a couple of days more.<eos> – So you're not going now?<eos> – No, you're not quite rid of me yet.<eos> – Dad, it's our turn.<eos> – Are you going to go or what?<eos> Wait here.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> – I bought the apartment and stuff.<eos> – Hi, I have to show you something.
What kind of... You have to see him.<eos> You have to go and see him.<eos> - Jules, what kind of fit? - It's not right, Frank, what's happening to him, and they won't listen to me.<eos> He's asleep now.<eos> Just go and see him, Frank.<eos> Sorry, Jules.<eos> I need Frank.<eos> Yeah, well, his son needs him more.<eos> Go and see him, Frank.<eos> What's going on with you two?
- He'll send an army.<eos> - So we unite.<eos> Look what we can achieve when we band together.<eos> Will you lead us?<eos> No.<eos> He will.<eos> You must follow my orders without question.<eos> All of you.<eos> Treat his wound, then tie him up.<eos> We've come to join you.
I have lost too many men.<eos> I will not risk more.<eos> - We have many mouths to feed.<eos> - They have come from far.<eos> You've done well.<eos> It is him who brings them hope.<eos> Durant's men will show no mercy.<eos> Have none for them.<eos> We will fight together as warriors.<eos> Remember what they've done to you and your families.
They arrive tonight.<eos> You've brought too many horses.<eos> No! No!<eos> Betray!<eos> Betray!<eos> Betray!<eos> Betray!<eos> Betray.<eos> Make the most of the hours you have left, Saxons!<eos> You'll soon be nothing more than dust!
Me?<eos> What's wrong with you, bro?<eos> Margo Roth Spiegelman, 2:00 a.m., she's single... she's dancing, it's dark.<eos> And you don't make the move. I don't understand that.<eos> It's not even like that.<eos> It's like... I don't know. We were connecting.<eos> We were on a mission. It was different.<eos> So now what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll let you know when I see her.
Ha-ha! Not "Fattina." It's "Bettina."<eos> Doesn't even sound like a real name.<eos> Yeah. What was her last name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just say her last name.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> It was a one hit, and a quit.<eos> It was a "hit it and quit it"?<eos> Yeah. I hit that honey bunny.<eos> I've told you guys this so many times. I don't wanna go over this again.
You teach me and I'll teach you.<eos> Pokémon!<eos> Gotta catch 'em all.<eos> Gotta catch 'em all Gotta catch 'em all.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Lacey?<eos> You scared the shit out of us.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I followed you.
We have not talked about it yet.<eos> I am not sure I want you to come with us to Wessex.<eos> I am ready.<eos> I have endured many hours of training.<eos> Lagertha herself even helped me.<eos> But what if you are with child already?<eos> If I lost you, then I would also lose my child.<eos> I am coming with you!<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> I'm going to cook you little piggies.
I had no idea.<eos> And that is the beauty of it.<eos> Ragnar and Lagertha talk only of farming.<eos> Farming.<eos> Who wants to go places and farm?<eos> Where is the glory in that, Einar?<eos> Where is the glory in that?<eos> **<eos> Welcome near!<eos> I bid you all welcome.
But if you, Ragnar Lothbrok, and you, Lagertha, would join with us, I am sure of victory.<eos> **<eos> **<eos> **<eos> ** **<eos> Um, King Ragnar, I have given you land.<eos> Let me tell you the truth, as God is my witness, some of my nobles do not agree with what I have done.<eos> They are afraid.<eos> But I am determined to honor our treaty.<eos> In return, some of you, at least, must fight for Princess Kwenthrith.
I think you know who that is.<eos> I will protect you.<eos> The captain of Scarborough, he offered me and nine men of my choosing full pardons if I would aid him in the capture of a fugitive from justice.<eos> You understand what I'm asking you to do?<eos> Go back and watch the gold.<eos> Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers who are watching the gold.<eos> Her father is a very influential man.<eos> If I return her to him, I believe that I can win him as an ally.<eos> Courting Lord Ashe and retrieving the Urca gold are working against each other.<eos> If you prevent any further attack on the fort, I will bring the girl down from the hill and deliver her to you.
I think I've got a pretty strong case.<eos> His way, a lot of them will die tonight.<eos> My way, they won't and we'll gain the favor of a man who could move this place a step closer to sustainability.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Though, still, his argument would seem to be the easier one.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Sure.<eos> "Captain Flint will betray anyone to get what he wants.<eos> Yesterday it was Mr. Gates, today it was me.<eos> Which one of you would like to be tomorrow?"
Which one of you would like to be tomorrow?"<eos> Captain?<eos> They're ready.<eos> There's only one item for consideration tonight.<eos> Captain Hornigold?<eos> A man asks for your trust, he asks and offers you things in the future.<eos> And the brighter those things may be, the more you must ask yourself,<eos> "What is it they are intended to blind me to in the present?"<eos> It's no surprise that that man wants to shift your attention to the future.<eos> To the things he says he can give you.
Is that so?<eos> I believe I've been clear about the nature of my investment here.<eos> The gold was the inducement.<eos> - Now no gold...<eos> - It's an unfortunate development that we have to adapt, and quickly.<eos> I've had about my fill of adapting lately.<eos> Doing your bidding, keeping the crew in line for you.<eos> I wasn't the only one to benefit from that.<eos> It certainly seemed that way.<eos> Even now you're the only one benefitting from it.
You walk out on this, and where the fuck are you going?<eos> You'll address the men?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Many of them won't want to hear it.<eos> Don't you want to discuss how you'll approach them?<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Some fuckin' day, huh?<eos> I'm sure you idiots had half that money spent already.<eos> What were you gonna do with it?<eos> - Mm. I was gonna walk away from all you people and never look back.
Then what is it you wish to discuss?<eos> Best we do this in private.<eos> Can I have a word?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm waiting on a final tally, but I believe we've lost around 18 defectors over the last few hours.<eos> Some due to loss of the gold, some following Hornigold out the door out of loyalty to him.<eos> Anyone we'll miss?<eos> Mr. Dufresne.<eos> Really?<eos> He saw the crew's overwhelming support for you, felt his resentment towards you had become an impediment in his existing amongst them.
But the truth is it's just as likely you let go and dropped me into the sea.<eos> Which do you think it was?<eos> Doesn't much matter, as far as I can tell.<eos> I'll likely never know for certain.<eos> It's possible you'll never even know for certain.<eos> And right now, I'm more focused on what comes next than what's passed.<eos> I believe you were right.<eos> I believe that for what comes next, the men of this crew will need your leadership.<eos> So I will do what needs to be done to preserve it and protect it.<eos> Mr. Gates turned his back on you.
Unless we had something to offer them that might change their thinking about us.<eos> You think there's something valuable enough to make the British Navy forget that you and I are pirates?<eos> And what do you think would have that kind of value to them?<eos> Not what.<eos> Who.<eos> How soon before you can sail?<eos> First light.<eos> No need to delay.<eos> My father has left for the interior to lay the groundwork with Mr. Underhill for the partnership.<eos> With any luck, by the time you return, you and Governor Ashe will be greeted by a group of handsome men, pretty wives, and rosy-cheeked children.
How unrecognizable the woman I am now would be to the woman I was then.<eos> I recognize you.<eos> You recognize me?<eos> Yes.<eos> So that's in our favor.<eos> The question is... will Peter recognize either one of us?<eos> Five million pieces.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> How in the fuck am I supposed to prepare to carry five million pieces of eight across an ocean without anybody knowing I'm doing it? !<eos> I don't know, but perhaps if you asked a little louder, there might be someone on the moon who could help you.
But I have news I think you'll want to hear without delay.<eos> May I sit?<eos> When you engaged me to monitor the goings on across the way, for a generous stipend, I might add, I must confess, I thought you'd overestimated our young friend Max, worrying that she was clever enough to create any real trouble...<eos> I'm sorry, is there a point you are trying to make?<eos> I was wrong.<eos> There is something afoot at the inn.<eos> I believe I know what it is.<eos> And I believe you'll want to know it, too.<eos> Next item!<eos> I know my role here is to recount information to you.
Can't remember.<eos> Can't trust a fucking thing out of his mouth.<eos> Yeah, the story's his, the story isn't his.<eos> But the power of the telling... that is clearly his.<eos> At the moment, he's using it to help the captain.<eos> But God help us if he ever realizes what else he could use it to accomplish.<eos> And as he swung, I watched the crowd jeer at him.<eos> I watched them laugh and celebrate.<eos> Women, children, all of them.<eos> I tell you, friends, what lies ahead isn't just the governor nor his lieutenants or his soldiers or their guns.

- Clear out!<eos> - Who is it?<eos> What about this?<eos> Upon our return, we anchor the ship off the southern coast.<eos> A team of men excavate a trench inland.<eos> We leave the bulk of the coin in the trench, keep the location secret, and rotate men in watches to keep it under guard?<eos> Your answer as where to secure five million pieces of eight is to dig a hole?<eos> All right, how about this?<eos> It is astonishing how much damage a woman can do once you let her in the door.<eos> Is he talking about you?
It would seem these monsters are men... sons, brothers, fathers.<eos> And it would seem these men fear their own monsters... an empire... a navy... a king.<eos> My father.<eos> So much I've left behind me...<eos> London, my youth, and comfortable stories.<eos> So much lies ahead in Charles Town... a future and harder truths.<eos> I feel I must face it honestly, bravely.<eos> I must face it as my father's daughter, and I believe that in order to do that,<eos> I have to tell them what I know.<eos> I've told you my father is a reasonable man, and that is true about most things.
Until I received a letter from him years ago in which he recounted to me the story of a ship... headed for Charles Town attacked by pirates.<eos> The ship which was attacked was named the Maria Aleyne.<eos> The ship was set upon by Captain Flint and his men.<eos> And in the midst of the bloody assault, there was one particular victim, a very important man traveling under an assumed name.<eos> His name was Alfred Hamilton.<eos> Given the lengths to which this man had gone to protect himself, the fact that he fell under Captain Flint's sword... suggested he'd been hunted, pursued, and then executed in cold blood and with great malice aforethought.<eos> The motive unclear, but the intent apparently dark and awful, monstrous.<eos> He said the act was completely incompatible with civilized society. That he would dedicate his life to eradicating it.<eos> And that there would be law in the Americas... the day Captain Flint swung over Charles Town.<eos> I appreciate what you've done for me.

We may not have the right weapons, but we are ready.<eos> I ask you, Li Kung, when do we take the fight to these bastards?<eos> We must remain composed and only make our move when everything is in place.<eos> Patience is the key to victory.<eos> You've been preaching patience for many months now.<eos> Where has that gotten us?<eos> Are you questioning my leadership?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> So, who among you has a complaint tonight?
Where has that gotten us?<eos> Are you questioning my leadership?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> So, who among you has a complaint tonight?<eos> Step forward and challenge your opponent.<eos> From the shadows you attack me?<eos> Master Ho will challenge any of you to step in the ring and fight me with honor.<eos> I'll take all of you on.<eos> Who among you wants to take on Master Ho?
Keep on walking.<eos> Someday, I'll shove my shovel down his gullet.<eos> You keep your nose on the grindstone, brother.<eos> He's itching for a fight today.<eos> A girl is dead!<eos> They found another girl near the village!<eos> A girl is dead!<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> Get back to work!<eos> Unless you want to join your dead friend!
Their bodies just shriveled up like dried fruits.<eos> They say it's evil spirits.<eos> But I know it's the ghost of Lord Pi.<eos> It's like they're voided of...<eos> Chi.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Play with each other.<eos> Make each other wet.<eos> Giggle, laugh, enjoy.<eos> I have three rules I will tell you now.
Chi.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Play with each other.<eos> Make each other wet.<eos> Giggle, laugh, enjoy.<eos> I have three rules I will tell you now.<eos> The first rule, if you bite me, I'll rip out your teeth.<eos> If you talk to me, I'll rip out your tongue.<eos> If you look at another man, I'll rip out your eyes.<eos> But aside from this, I'll give you the finest food and the finest wine, and we will have a fine time.
Strong.<eos> You shouldn't take kindness for a weakness.<eos> Sometimes it takes more courage not to fight than to fight.<eos> My best friend, Chow-Li, was murdered, and then my uncle.<eos> My father did nothing.<eos> I'm sure he has his reasons.<eos> Well, someone has to do something.<eos> We can't just wait for Master Ho to act.<eos> We, Beetle Clan, challenge Li Kung to a duel.<eos> I have no fight with any of you.
- Brother Kung's right.<eos> - You saved our lives.<eos> And to liberate this town, it's gonna take all the help we can get.<eos> I can make you legs, Mayor.<eos> And you can join the fight.<eos> I am grateful for the sentiment, but...<eos> But how?<eos> I could forge you legs. The way I forged these arms.<eos> I never have dreamed of such a thing.<eos> With legs, I can stand with you all and rid this town of the Beetle Clan, once and for all.
She makes you believe that anything is possible.<eos> And looking around here tonight at all these people, and my family, and everything, I realize that she was on the right track.<eos> Stand up.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> Now, in case you haven't heard, there's a pier being dedicated to us, the Rayburn family here, in a few days off the coast highway.<eos> Just a couple of planks, but I'm glad you're all here to help us celebrate that.<eos> There's something else I wanna say, and I'm not quite sure how to say it.<eos> Many years ago, we had us some trouble.<eos> I recognize some of the people here who helped us through that.<eos> I probably should have thanked you back then.

"Maybe you see everything that's happening, but I will tell you anyway."<eos> "The midwife says it all looks good.<eos> It's due in two weeks."<eos> "I miss you."<eos> Hello, everybody!<eos> How are you doing?
I am...<eos> I am perfect!<eos> Hear now.<eos> Listen, listen!<eos> The sopranos!<eos> And the booming kettle drums!<eos> At the London opening in 1743 George II stood up during the hallelujahs!<eos> You hear it...<eos> That's how great it is.<eos> Does any one of you think you can handle this?
I can't do this.<eos> People can tell you you're worthless.<eos> But you decide if you believe them.<eos> I think dancing would make me feel good.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Everyone needs to practice.<eos> Practice, practice...<eos> It needs to be in you. Sheet music away, and let's do it by heart.<eos> And, three, four...<eos> Let me just show you.
And no man given that kind of influence will remain honest for very long.<eos> Yes?<eos> Came to make sure you two were still alive.<eos> No one's heard from you in hours.<eos> The lieutenant was just recounting to me his belief that the only thing that stands between us and a prosperous Nassau is an ocean, 100 years of history, and human nature.<eos> Has he been like this all day?<eos> More or less, ma'am, yes.<eos> A gift.<eos> One of my favorites.<eos> And you might find it helpful in dealing with my husband going forward.
Thank you for noticing.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I think it's no secret that since my arrival I've been repeatedly provoked and harassed by the Guthrie woman.<eos> And, as her aggression seems to be escalating, I thought it wise to speak of this in the open.<eos> Her aggression towards you?<eos> Conspiracy with my quartermaster to depose me. And a provocation by her man-at-arms.<eos> I think you and I have both seen enough of these things to know they never end well.<eos> What are you telling me for?<eos> I saw you that day in the tavern.<eos> I hear you and she have a connection.
Would have been a little heavier, only she taxed us over the state of the containers.<eos> Are they still in there? Far as I know.<eos> Door hasn't opened all morning.<eos> When she finally emerges, tell her I've left.<eos> I'll make contact with Captain Hornigold, inform him of our arrival, and arrange safe passage into harbor.<eos> I'll then attempt to persuade him to assign the bulk of his crew and his ship to sail in consort with us.<eos> With a little luck, we'll be on our way back to the Urca wreck within a matter of days.<eos> And how do you plan to answer the question?<eos> What question is that?<eos> Why is this request coming from you, Captain Flint, and not from Mr. Gates?
- Then you resist them right back.<eos> They all know that we're headed back for the Urca's gold. They all know where it is. They all know that its defenses are weakened.<eos> We simply cannot allow that information leaking out onto the beach.<eos> Or let them go if you like.<eos> To whatever extent you're comfortable competing with a dozen other crews to retrieve that gold.<eos> Mr. Silver should be back aboard with provisions within a few hours.<eos> That ought to keep tempers in check.<eos> Are these the ones?<eos> Handpicked.<eos> You understand what I'm asking you to do?
So they had that in their favor.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I thought we needed to get back to the ship as quickly as possible.<eos> You're bringing something to read?<eos> It isn't for me.<eos> Strange.<eos> You and I have never shared more than a few words, and yet I feel like we're old friends.<eos> Do you?<eos> Of course.<eos> James talks about you all the time.
Do you?<eos> Of course.<eos> James talks about you all the time.<eos> Captain Flint.<eos> He's told me what you've accomplished in this place.<eos> With those men.<eos> In spite of them.<eos> It's no small feat.<eos> And I admire it.<eos> Do you know what he told me about you?
And I admire it.<eos> Do you know what he told me about you?<eos> What's that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> When I ask him, all I get is a shrug or a laugh or an innocent suggestion that he has a longtime companion.<eos> Her name is Barlow and nothing more.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> Is it possible that you're so unremarkable as to resist any further description than that?<eos> Certainly possible.<eos> You conspire with my father to sabotage our plans. You betray our trust. You cause almost irreparable damage as a result.
And if he's being honest, neither does he.<eos> I'm sorry. I saw the look on his face the last night he left this place and I beg to differ.<eos> Every man has his torments. Demons born of past wrongs that hound and harass him.<eos> You perceive the effects of Captain Flint's demons.<eos> Echoes of their voices.<eos> But I know their names.<eos> I was there when they were born.<eos> I know the things they whisper to him at night.<eos> So you can believe me when I tell you that within his chorus of torments... none of them look or sound like me.<eos> I don't know what it is that you owe Flint or that he owes you.

Is that possible?<eos> Well, it might have been possible when I had someplace to bring it all back home to.<eos> Before the bay fell into the hands of a madman.<eos> Fucking Hornigold.<eos> He told me Vane killed 30 of his men. That he was prepared to take back the fort, but that you sabotaged his efforts.<eos> I told him he must be mistaken.<eos> Eleanor Guthrie would never be so wantonly reckless with the security of this place.<eos> - I understand your concern, but...<eos> - Do you?<eos> Because what I find most troubling about all of this is the sense that you don't share it.
At that point, Mr. Gates' faith in our mission... his faith in me was lost.<eos> I had to use my judgment whether to let him abort our entire endeavor and see my plans, your plans, evaporate or to stop him.<eos> I stopped him.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What was necessary.<eos> Because I knew that the future of this place is everything.<eos> And that there is no sacrifice too great to secure that future.<eos> I thought you and I were in agreement about that.<eos> I'm sorry you were put to that choice.<eos> I know what he meant to you.
Are you familiar with Jonathan and Margaret Grey, Lieutenant?<eos> The Duke and Duchess of Surrey?<eos> As you may or may not be aware, they hold one of the largest collections of Egyptian artifacts in all of Europe.<eos> I thought perhaps today you'd join me in viewing them as my guest.<eos> You mean yours and your husband's?<eos> Thomas is otherwise engaged.<eos> It would just be you and I.<eos> I don't think that's a very good idea.<eos> Why wouldn't it be a good idea?<eos> Would you not enjoy my company?
This isn't an abstraction, ma'am.<eos> - Were your husband to hear...<eos> - I love my husband.<eos> I know what's said about me behind my back.<eos> Whispers of infidelities.<eos> My husband's heard them.<eos> And I suspect, given the look on your face, you've heard them, too.<eos> Thomas and I are not bothered by them.<eos> The only question that remains is... are you?<eos> It doesn't concern you?
When you set sail, my friend had his ear and you were ballast.<eos> Then he calls my friend a mutineer and puts him in the sea.<eos> Now he's giving you his ear.<eos> How can you stand so close to him knowing what he's capable of and that sooner or later you'll be next?<eos> Five million pieces of eight.<eos> Why?<eos> How do you do it?<eos> You were right.<eos> I don't know where her loyalties lie.<eos> Told you as much.
I'm quite certain this isn't the way to the Greys' residence.<eos> I quietly instructed the driver to take you home.<eos> Propriety.<eos> Lady Hamilton, do you know what would happen in my world if people just did as they please with no regard for convention?<eos> Columbus would still be sailing in circles off the coast of Spain.<eos> I imagine there are two kinds of men who make their life at sea.<eos> Those whose sense of duty forces them to leave any sense of permanence or identity behind them and those for whom that is the attraction.<eos> Which do you think I am?<eos> I think you're someone who's very good at managing how you're perceived.<eos> And perhaps getting what you want without anyone ever knowing how you did it or perhaps if it ever happened at all.
Where are you?<eos> What?<eos> For as long as I can remember, you have told me how important Captain Flint is to the future of this place, to your future.<eos> You have put money behind him.<eos> You have put your credibility behind him.<eos> And now you would resist him?<eos> Join with Captain Vane against him?<eos> This isn't about taking sides.<eos> It's about protecting the fort, protecting Nassau.<eos> Eleanor, you need to ask yourself what you want, where your loyalties are... and whom do you trust?
Eleanor, I wasn't asking permission.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I told the men what you asked.<eos> They're not pleased.<eos> Good.<eos> Is it?<eos> Once you go down this road, what if there's no turning back?<eos> I know how you all must feel.<eos> How desperate you must be to go home and be embraced by Nassau again.<eos> But I'm here to tell you, that place no longer exists.
Good luck finding him.<eos> Who said anything about "him"?<eos> You have a choice, my friend.<eos> You can stay here at Illyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Meereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.<eos> Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?<eos> When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen?<eos> Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.<eos> Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.<eos> The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freed men and the former slaveholders.<eos> All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.
No fighting pits.<eos> Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.<eos> I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.<eos> - If you--<eos> - How many times must I say no before you understand?<eos> Whatever he wants from me, he's not going to get it.<eos> If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...<eos> You should reopen the fighting pits.<eos> What?<eos> My mother was a whore. I told you that.
You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?<eos> I'm only here because of those pits.<eos> I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.<eos> Soon I was famous.<eos> 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit.<eos> I made so much money for my master, he set me free when he died.<eos> I joined the Second Sons.<eos> And then I met you.<eos> You're the queen.<eos> Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.
Truly you are.<eos> But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining.<eos> I think you're making a terrible mistake.<eos> The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.<eos> Mance Rayder, you've been called the King-beyond-the-Wall.<eos> Westeros only has one king.<eos> Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.<eos> Kneel and live.<eos> This was my home for many years.<eos> I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
I'm happy to take it. I've already spoken to the undertaker. Let me go.<eos> I've spent too much time looking at you and seeing my fiance. Today, I looked at you and saw the man I love.<eos> And I don't need a party in a grand hotel to tell the world how wonderful you are.<eos> I've a funny feeling that the world already knows.<eos> ♪ Hello, young lovers<eos> ♪ Whoever you are<eos> ♪ I hope your troubles are few ♪ All my good wishes Go with you tonight<eos> ♪ I've been in love like you<eos> ♪ Be brave and faithful and true ♪ All my good wishes Go with you tonight... ♪<eos> Tea's ready. It's true then? You are staying on permanently?
If we do everything perfectly... we add 533 days to our mission.<eos> 533 more days before we see our families again.<eos> 533 days of unplanned space travel... where anything could go wrong.<eos> If it's mission critical, we die.<eos> Sign me up.<eos> All right, cowboy, slow down.<eos> You and I, we're military.<eos> Chances are, we go home, they'll court martial us.<eos> Yeah, there's that.<eos> And for the rest of you guys... I guarantee they will never send you back up here again.
Engine alignment, perfect.<eos> Communications, five by five.<eos> We are ready for pre-flight checklist, Commander.<eos> Mission Control, this is Hermes actual.<eos> We will proceed on schedule.<eos> We are T-minus 2 minutes, 10 seconds to launch, by the mark.<eos> About two minutes, Watney.<eos> How you doing down there?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm anxious to get up to you.
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out how to slow down.<eos> Martinez, burn the jets.<eos> Copy that.<eos> MAV to Hermes.<eos> Watney?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> What's your status?<eos> My chest hurts.<eos> I broke my ribs.<eos> How are you?
There was a complication during launch.<eos> Copy that.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> We've corrected the intercept range, but we've got a problem with intercept velocity.<eos> How big a problem?<eos> 42 meters a second.<eos> Well... shit.<eos> Commander, I have an idea.<eos> Go ahead, Mark.<eos> Well, if I can find something sharp in here... and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit... I could use the escaping air as a thruster... and fly towards you.
Copy.<eos> Hook me up.<eos> Done.<eos> I have visual on the MAV.<eos> What's the intercept range?<eos> I'm checking.<eos> 312 meters.<eos> Did you say 312?<eos> Great.<eos> I'll wave at you guys as I go by.
Wait!<eos> Stop following me!<eos> All we need is a bioelectric transmitter.<eos> She's gonna die!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> She's a robot!<eos> Yeah, but she's my friend.<eos> I don't want to hear about it!<eos> Bagu. please!<eos> And why should I help you?
You think you know the Art of War better than me<eos> Charge<eos> Damn<eos> Stay down<eos> We don't have enough men<eos> Who's in charge now'?<eos> - Me<eos> -No one'?<eos> Then I am<eos> Listen to me if you want to live
You kill them Revenge<eos> Vengeance is...<eos> Vengeance. Baochou<eos> Baochou<eos> Why you want revenge'?<eos> This is not your business<eos> Anything happen in Silk Road is my business<eos> Revenge makes more hate<eos> Today we meet We are friend<eos> I want to help you
We will meet him<eos> Yes, General<eos> Lucius, no<eos> Huo An<eos> If you stand with us you will be butchered<eos> The city we built is a dream<eos> It'll only last 15 days<eos> I cannot be further in your debt<eos> Think<eos> If Tiberius want to catch you why he need a hundred thousand men'?
Falco<eos> Young master<eos> On behalf of the Roman Empire I commission you First Centurion of the Legion<eos> My deepest honor<eos> Ag riPPa ls there something on your mind'?<eos> Perhaps we have come too far<eos> From Rome'?<eos> From all the things I've always tried to teach you<eos> You taught me the road to be a great lord is predestined<eos> I didn't teach you to kill your own father
Look after our kids<eos> Look after yourself<eos> It wasn't easy for us to be together<eos> And it won't be easy for us to be apart<eos> Welcome home<eos> So nice to have you hanging around again<eos> Everyone in Rome including my father thought you were the finest warrior in the Empire<eos> No I think of you more as a chess piece<eos> Think about it Lucius<eos> If I hadn't purposely let you escape Purposely
50m'<eos> Go ahead<eos> Captain Something happened before you returned this morning<eos> Our great General Tiberius has enacted a plan to unify the Silk Road<eos> I've already asked him to acquiesce<eos> He said no<eos> All of the thirty-six nations have acquiesced<eos> And you are the last<eos> We need you to do one thing<eos> What did they want you to do'?
I kept on asking myself<eos> Why her'?<eos> Why me'?<eos> General Huo said We can't change the past but the future is firmly in our hands<eos> He said everyone has their misfortunes but we need to contain the pain and turn it into motivation<eos> A person who only laments the past is a coward whereas a person who can change the future is a true hero<eos> He said heroes are not afraid to die<eos> Nonetheless, I have to admit that the fate of the Silk Road can't be changed by the Protection Squad alone<eos> Still, I'm truly thankful<eos> I thank you all for joining me in rebuilding this city
that I won't have the chance to see him grow up<eos> My brothers on the Silk Road I have already given my all<eos> People are rarely satisfied with the truth<eos> If I can satisfy you all with my life Then I shall die with no regrets<eos> But I do have one last request<eos> Please raise the memorial flag that we made together<eos> Raise it up for me<eos> So I can take one last look at our child<eos> I will be forever indebted to you<eos> I promise to repay you in my next life
Lucius<eos> Huo An<eos> I'm not sure why but I've always liked those who've hated me because through our hatred our real selves are revealed<eos> You see humans become bit more practical as they reach their end<eos> Now Huo An Pledge your allegiance to me and I will let you live<eos> How can you be so blind Dare to speak about truth<eos> I'm Huo An work so hard in the Silk Road<eos> - I'm the one who should be a Chief -What are you doing Get back here<eos> How can you give Yin Po the Chief position?<eos> You think he will hand over the border to you Just so he can be a chief?
Go<eos> Hurry now<eos> I want to die with you<eos> Engage<eos> Captain<eos> Captain<eos> Sun<eos> Parthians<eos> Disengage the army<eos> Tiberius The criminal who killed Crassus and blinded Publius stands here before you
Captain<eos> Sun<eos> Parthians<eos> Disengage the army<eos> Tiberius The criminal who killed Crassus and blinded Publius stands here before you<eos> This is an outrage<eos> A conspiracy<eos> Consul Crassus and I signed this peace treaty So as to guarantee the safety of your brother<eos> Because your father knew of your evil plan<eos> So let me ask you on behalf of your father and brother
Top grades.<eos> The COS says nothing to me.<eos> Not one word.<eos> A week later... Jeff gets promoted.<eos> Screw the CIA.<eos> That's everyone in NE and SAD working on Afghanistan.<eos> I gotta take a leak.<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm doing something terrible.<eos> I can tell you what's wrong with you.
But... There will be hell to pay if we do not finish ... Before he woke up.<eos> He?<eos> What... What the hell?<eos> Life?<eos> What is this?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> Why did you run away, you bastard?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Forgive him, I beg you.
We realtor liked high school girls like this.<eos> Dirt what are you talking about?<eos> Do not laugh.<eos> I sort of yakuza.<eos> This menyebalkanku life.<eos> Someone does not necessarily become yakuza.<eos> Then...<eos> What we take a kind of national exam?<eos> Does not that violate laws against incorporation?<eos> We no space... For two criminals like you.
You do not want to do that.<eos> I do not mind.<eos> And... I yakuza now.<eos> To hell with your protection.<eos> All of it!<eos> Let's do ..<eos> So, you're going to bite us too?<eos> Come on!<eos> Try me, motherfucker.<eos> I will kill you.
Where were you?<eos> I'm drowning out here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Two short stacks.<eos> Let me get you guys some more syrup.
After Rudolf Abel, maybe.<eos> And me.<eos> Now wake up!<eos> I have to sleep.<eos> I just have to sleep.<eos> I told you could sleep.<eos> Once we talk what need to talk.<eos> You must focus on me.<eos> Your government does not care about you. You know that.<eos> Any of you.
I told you could sleep.<eos> Once we talk what need to talk.<eos> You must focus on me.<eos> Your government does not care about you. You know that.<eos> Any of you.<eos> You know that 12 U-2 pilots incurred brain damage.<eos> They are vegetables because of altitude, insufficient oxygen.<eos> They keep you flying, Gary.<eos> You and your friends.<eos> They gave you this, a scratchier.
- Oh my God!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> I've not seen that in the daylight, man.<eos> - Did I do that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh my God, I'm talented.<eos> I'm worth something.<eos> We should probably be quiet.<eos> - I think Dom's on the phone.<eos> - Okay, what is up with you two?
You take the boyfriend within out on a date.<eos> Which is you, your inner boyfriend.<eos> Did you do that?<eos> Oh, please, please tell me.<eos> I promise I'll put it back on the shelf.<eos> - I did.<eos> - My God!<eos> Well, you know, I am impressed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How... how did it go for the two of you?
Come. Come now, or it's too late.<eos> My Lord.<eos> Burgred, wait!<eos> King Ecbert has arranged for some of the laborers who worked here to help us farm the land.<eos> What are they saying?<eos> They're saying their grandfathers used some of these tools.<eos> **<eos> **<eos> **<eos> May I tell you something?
Why did you not go with them?<eos> Have we any news of our army?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But with Ragnar Lothbrok, how can we fail?<eos> Ever since I saw Ragnar Lothbrok and his kin at my father's house, I've been fascinated by these Northmen, especially by their pagan ways.<eos> You were a monk at Lindisfarne, Athelstan.<eos> But you lived amongst the pagans.<eos> Tell me, what was it like?<eos> Lady Judith, you are a good Christian woman.<eos> How could I describe such things to you?
Cut off his sleeve.<eos> Come here.<eos> You sure you want to go ahead?<eos> No, not my head.<eos> Just cut off the stinking arm, man.<eos> Get on with it.<eos> Too bad it's not your flicking arm.<eos> You could have saved some money.<eos> Freyr and Freya, ye gods, be with him now.<eos> Earl Ingstad and I would like to thank both of you for your hospitality and kindness.
And to King Ragnar, of course.<eos> Ragnar is not here.<eos> He and the men have gone raiding.<eos> But you are welcome to what food we have, and to a bed of straw.<eos> You are talking behind my back!<eos> Please do me the honor of talking to my face.<eos> We meant no disrespect, sire, but wondered why, if you're prepared to share our farming secrets with the pagans, you do not, in return, ask them to share their boat-building secrets with us?<eos> And why is it, since we give them land to farm, we do not ask them to convert to the only true God?<eos> Yes, I understand your concerns, but as things stand, the Northmen, in the shape of Ragnar Lothbrok, are currently fighting beside us to help us gain the throne of Mercia, that huge kingdom, for our puppet, Princess Kwenthrith.<eos> Now, who among you would choose not to turf a few farmers off our land, rather than gain, through this alliance, a greater part of England itself?
A Roman god.<eos> A pagan god.<eos> Like your gods, Lagertha.<eos> She is not like my gods.<eos> My gods are as real as you and me.<eos> They laugh.<eos> They bleed.<eos> They rush around the skies.<eos> I have been a wanderer for most of my life.<eos> I want to tell you of the time that I went to Utgard.
No, I didn't.<eos> When she threw away her stick, I hurled myself upon her!<eos> But the moment that I laid hands on her, I realized she was strong.<eos> And she caught me in a lock and threw me off balance.<eos> I clung to her desperately,<eos> Can I have some more ale?<eos> This story is always so difficult to tell.<eos> But after a struggle, I was forced to one knee...<eos> And so I lost.<eos> Then, what happened to you?
But make it worth her while, for she is already at the gates.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> Ah, Ragnar.<eos> My ally.<eos> Burgred has something to say to you.<eos> I did not mean to fight against you today.<eos> I am young.<eos> I was led by evil counselors.<eos> I beg your forgiveness, King Ragnar.<eos> I forgive you.
The gods have vouchsafed me nothing, told me nothing.<eos> They have neither warned me, nor promised me anything.<eos> And I have foreseen nothing.<eos> But we have foreseen something.<eos> We women, we dreamt that you were...<eos> You were tied up, that you were bleeding, and you could neither move nor cry out.<eos> That is what we saw.<eos> We saw that nobody could help us.<eos> It's true.<eos> No one can help you.
I have seen its gates.<eos> And I see that its gates are already here, to my eyes.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means exactly as I have said.<eos> I do not lie about what I see, King Ragnar, only sometimes I withhold things, for human beings cannot bear too much reality.<eos> Then if you can see, tell me if I will conquer Paris.<eos> I can see that not the living, but the dead, will conquer Paris.<eos> Not the living but the dead?<eos> And I also see that the bear will be crowned by a princess.<eos> Which does not bode too well for you, King Ragnar.
Quiet.<eos> I have made up my mind.<eos> And this year, we shall attack Paris.<eos> Paris?<eos> What is Paris?<eos> That is a good question, brother.<eos> Paris is a city in the country of Frankia.<eos> Next!<eos> Why haven't you told us all about this before?<eos> Because I'm telling you now.
That's how it was.<eos> That's what happened when you were away.<eos> Wait!<eos> There's more, Ragnar.<eos> There's much more.<eos> Do you not know who Harbard is?<eos> Harbard is another name for Odin.<eos> It was Odin who slept with your wife.<eos> The god, Odin, who came to Kattegat.<eos> I am ashamed that my word as king meant nothing to some of you!
And this!<eos> And him!<eos> All for treason!<eos> And my Lord Radolf.<eos> Arrest him also.<eos> Wait, Sire...<eos> For I showed him nothing, nothing but love, and this... This treachery is my reward?<eos> Out of my sight!<eos> And Aethelwulf, you think you will escape so lightly?<eos> All of you! Leave!
I was blind, but now I see.<eos> I was dead, but...<eos> I'm reborn.<eos> Father, hear my prayer. And let my cry come unto thee.<eos> For the gift of sight,<eos> Lord, thank you.<eos> For the gift of faith. Thank you.<eos> For by you all things were created that are in heaven and that are in earth.<eos> Visible and invisible. Whether they be thrones, powers or dominions, all things were created by you.<eos> And for you.
I join you in the expectation of the greatest raid in the history of our people.<eos> - Who is this chunk of meat?<eos> - This is Earl Siegfried.<eos> Lord Ragnar.<eos> I put my ships and my warriors at your disposal.<eos> I'm sure that you remember King Horik's son, and the widow of Jarl Borg.<eos> They also have expressed a desire to take part in our raid.<eos> Erlendur.<eos> Torvi.<eos> I have to say that I am a little caught off guard, seeing you here.
It's far too good for you.<eos> Whore!<eos> The Northmen have been scouting the countryside, and our defenses.<eos> We must expect an attack any day now.<eos> Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.<eos> It is much on my mind.<eos> I did not want to be sent away.<eos> I wanted to stay here with you.<eos> There is nowhere I would rather be than here in Paris, beside you, in your hour of need.<eos> But I must tell you both, I have been much about the city.
Oh, clever you.<eos> - Yes, he's named after his father.<eos> - His father?<eos> I think you may know him.<eos> Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> Our nobles, before you killed them, never reported that you were with child, still less that the father was Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> Nevertheless, he is Ragnar's son.<eos> And nothing will stop him from returning to these shores, both for Magnus and for his settlement.<eos> We have destroyed his settlement.<eos> Then he will return with vengeance upon you.
Of course, some reward.<eos> Who is this young man?<eos> - His name is Ansgar.<eos> - What is he accused of?<eos> He is a stranger, a Christian, a missionary, so he claims.<eos> He has been in the marketplace denouncing our gods.<eos> Is it true?<eos> It's true that I begged the people here to desist from worshipping false gods and serving the devil.<eos> Your gods are made with human hands and are deaf, dumb and blind.<eos> What salvation can they bring you?
I assumed we'd depart tomorrow at some point.<eos> Leave as soon as possible.<eos> There are foul things brewing here.<eos> Yes?<eos> They're here.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Good.<eos> Then we move at sundown.<eos> The proposal that I have come all this way to make is one that may at first strike you as implausible.

And how long after that was it that you decided to murder Alfred Hamilton?<eos> I received a letter from a former servant.<eos> She mentioned innocently that Alfred was travelling in secret.<eos> And she mentioned the name of the ship.<eos> I encouraged James to find him.<eos> And to kill him.<eos> If you're going to blame anyone for it, please, blame me.<eos> The governor may know who you are.<eos> I only know what you are.<eos> Let us agree that if either one of you gets any closer to the governor than you just did, I will be forced to consider that a threat to his person and I will shoot you where you stand.

Persuade Captain Vane to surrender the ship.<eos> Governor Ashe?<eos> He's coming here?<eos> Plans are underway as we speak.<eos> When he arrives, I propose that you and I greet him together and we explain to him our joint venture to reclaim Nassau.<eos> My ships, your sugar.<eos> The return of legitimate commerce and the return of law.<eos> For so many years I have watched you and your kind thieve and whore and kill like a plague upon this island, doing whatever you please because you can.<eos> I've heard your appeal.<eos> How could I be expected to trust one of you?
What?<eos> Then I...<eos> My lord, I know there are many reasons to say no to this, however...<eos> - Colonel Rhett.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'd like everyone to clear the room.<eos> Sir?<eos> I'd like to speak with my guests privately for a moment.<eos> Wait in the hall, please.<eos> I believe there is a way that I can help you achieve your intentions for the future of Nassau.

You could almost certainly win them to your side.<eos> But there are other men who will oppose it categorically for the same reason all men refuse to do things they should.<eos> Pride.<eos> You think they're too proud to put pardons on the table?<eos> I think they fear you.<eos> And to capitulate to something one fears is a humiliation that powerful men cannot accept.<eos> If we are to persuade them to ally with you, then we have to completely redefine their understanding of who you are, what you are.<eos> How do you propose we do that?<eos> With the truth.<eos> I will come with you to Nassau, survey the situation.
With the truth.<eos> I will come with you to Nassau, survey the situation.<eos> If it is as you say it is, you and I will sail to London together.<eos> And when we arrive, you will stand up and you will tell your story.<eos> My story?<eos> What part of my story?<eos> All of it.<eos> You will tell them about the affair with Thomas.<eos> You will tell them how it ended.<eos> You will explain to them what it drove you to do.
And when you do, Captain Flint will be unmasked, the monster slain.<eos> And in his place will stand before all the world a flawed man, a man that England can relate to and offer its forgiveness.<eos> What you're asking of me...<eos> I wish there were another way, but I have given it great thought and I cannot find it.<eos> Tell me this is something that you are willing to do, and you and I will walk out of this house together, announce our partnership to the street, and prepare to set sail for Nassau.<eos> Your clock by the wall... where did you obtain it?<eos> What?<eos> It looks very much like one that used to reside in my husband's parlor in London.<eos> Identical, in fact.<eos> I don't remember gifting it to you. It was there when I left.
Your clock by the wall... where did you obtain it?<eos> What?<eos> It looks very much like one that used to reside in my husband's parlor in London.<eos> Identical, in fact.<eos> I don't remember gifting it to you. It was there when I left.<eos> So I ask again, how is it you came to possess that clock?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> From whom?<eos> From Alfred Hamilton.<eos> The earl was no friend of yours, yet he grants you gifts from his own home.
That is what civilization is.<eos> I am so very sorry for what you have suffered and for any part I may have played in it.<eos> Please believe that.<eos> But at this point, the most important thing is what comes next, what we make of this.<eos> - You destroyed our lives!<eos> - Miranda.<eos> - You caused our exile!<eos> - I am sorry for what I did.<eos> - Thomas died in a cold, dark place...<eos> - I am trying to help you.
I knew his reputation.<eos> I knew he was most likely telling me the story I wanted to hear, but his contrition was utilitarian at best.<eos> But you, you don't even seem to be wanting to appear that way.<eos> The time for storytelling is past.<eos> Now is the time for cold, hard truths.<eos> What is this?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Are you Underhill? - I am.<eos> - Then I suggest you step aside, sir.<eos> We've no quarrel with you.
Man your stations.<eos> Ready the guns.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> So... what do you suppose happens next?<eos> Pirate vessel!<eos> Pirate vessel!<eos> What follows is a message from the Lord Governor of the Carolina Colony.<eos> "I trusted the good faith of your arrival and I accepted Captain Flint as my guest in the same spirit.<eos> But I now regret to inform you that he has violated that trust in a most deceitful manner." - What?

Now, let me tell you what happens next.<eos> You were right.<eos> Right about what?<eos> They can't tell the difference between you and I.<eos> Nassau is strongest when she's feared.<eos> And if what promises to happen here tomorrow actually happens, a trophy made of one of her most notorious captains, she may never be feared again.<eos> So I suggest we do something about this.<eos> I suggest we... get him the hell out of there.<eos> Captain Hume.<eos> I understand you hold in your possession 10 pardons for whomever was to deliver you Captain James Flint.
Yes, kale shake.<eos> Dehydrated cactus powder.<eos> I'm training for a 5K.<eos> Hello, Noah.<eos> Mr. Lovato.<eos> Eddie.<eos> Come on, we're in business together.<eos> I think it's appropriate to be on a first-name basis, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, how are you?
Yeah.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> Good?<eos> Good.<eos> You boys ever hear of the seven rules of economics?<eos> That's okay.<eos> Basically there's seven fundamental notions, let's say, that reflect how our economy operates.<eos> There's scarcity, there's subjectivity, there's inequality, competition, imperfection, ignorance and complexity.<eos> But I believe there are eight. Luck.<eos> Which as of yesterday morning, you boys seem shit out of.
But I believe there are eight. Luck.<eos> Which as of yesterday morning, you boys seem shit out of.<eos> Because as of today, you owe me 400 grand.<eos> The number was 200.<eos> You forget the cost of money.<eos> Which is a theory, another basic fundamental rule.<eos> With all due respect, sir, we didn't borrow the money from you, Noah did.<eos> Noah. Are these your partners?<eos> Yes, yes they are.<eos> Well, then, you share the debt equally.
Did you ever hear of the Quantum Ten?<eos> Group of guys, they got together, fired by ambition and passion.<eos> They created quantum physics.<eos> They knew with ambition and passion comes execution.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm shitting green, and then running three times a day, 'cause I know what it's like to execute. Okay?<eos> I know what it takes.<eos> It takes motivation.<eos> And you guys have plenty of it.<eos> I'm offering you gentlemen a way out.

It takes motivation.<eos> And you guys have plenty of it.<eos> I'm offering you gentlemen a way out.<eos> I'm offering you a panacea to your problems.<eos> All you have to do is collect him, hold him, for 24 hours.<eos> My guys'll hunt down Tyrone, they'll set a time and place, I'll contact you, okay.<eos> And if you do this for me, I will consider the slate clean.<eos> I hate this shit.<eos> It's like wheat grass, but it's not as good as wheat grass.<eos> Hey, Bernard, lemme tell you though, Let me tell you what this motherfucker said to me
Guys?<eos> Guys!<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> That's on a need-to-know basis.<eos> Right now you don't need to know shit.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Don't worry about all that, Marques.<eos> This'll all be over in 24 hours, as long as you behave.<eos> Behave?<eos> You got a set of stones, I'll give you that.
Fucking flawless!<eos> Do you know what a scratch that size, that sure as shit ain't coming out, does to its value?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's worthless now.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I just made my first decision.<eos> What's that?<eos> When I get outta here, you the first one I'm gonna shoot.<eos> I'm gonna go out on a limb here and take an educated guess.<eos> Since I've never set eyes on any of you before, the reason why I'm taped to this chair is not personal in nature, which makes this unfortunate chain of events... a business transaction?
It's just...<eos> No, you know what, I'm sorry,<eos> I overreacted, you're right, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This is my wallet.<eos> Noah Dorfman, 316 North Flushing Avenue.<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> That's an old address.<eos> What you probably are unaware of Zach, and Noah Dorfman, is I have Demetrius Flemmings' blood coursing through my veins.
You know, it's part of the territory, occupational hazard.<eos> Occupational hazard?<eos> Eddie, I hit this man in the head with a fucking toilet lid!<eos> Putting a bullet in the back of my fucking head is gonna be the first thing on his list.<eos> You know what, Eddie, maybe we'll untie him and let him go.<eos> Or better yet, why don't we just let him know and his fucking uncle, fucking who put us up to this!<eos> Really?<eos> Now you listen to me, you little motherfuckers.<eos> I'll cut your fucking heads off and stuff them down your fucking necks, okay?<eos> Until my niece gets back, you're gonna do exactly what I want you to do.
Yeah, I can't do that.<eos> You don't think there's a search party out there right now looking for me?<eos> I bet you dimes to dollars, somebody caught a few digits on that license plate of yours.<eos> It's only a matter of time before that doorbell ring.<eos> I ain't gonna lie to ya, Noah.<eos> Somebody's getting invoiced for this shit.<eos> It just doesn't have to be you.<eos> Where's Marques Flemmings?<eos> I didn't even know that puto was missing?<eos> We know all you pimps and drug dealers, you have your noses in up each others' business.
Now we just sit, and we wait. Sit and wait, wonderful.<eos> Well, did he give you any idea how much longer it'd be?<eos> Shut up, Noah!<eos> Look, let's just take shifts watching him, all right?<eos> We'll switch out every two hours.<eos> This way we can get some sleep.<eos> - Yeah, all right. - Okay, all right.<eos> I'll go first. You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did I ever tell you guys how I got this scar on my ear?
Well. I just wanted you to know that, you know, I feel bad about it and, and I'm sorry.<eos> Half, a million, dollars.<eos> That's my offer.<eos> All you got to do is un-cuff me, and let me walk out that door unchecked.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> 500K that you get to keep.<eos> For yourself.<eos> My brother, you better think hard.<eos> My offer ain't just gonna hang out there in the ether.<eos> Before sunup one of you's gonna realize, that you ain't got the stomach for this kinda thing. Now take the dough.
It's one of the evils of humanity.<eos> We all win somethin' and lose somethin' at the same time.<eos> Okay, so you're Socrates now?<eos> No, I'm simply saying that we all brought into this world with a sheet of columns.<eos> And the shit you do in one column has to be balanced out with the shit you do in the other.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Okay, stay with me and see if what I'm saying don't start making perfect sense.<eos> All right.<eos> Me. I'm here, cuffed to this chair, because of some malevolent act that I did out there.<eos> And, as you can imagine, given my line of work, that side of the column is pretty god damned full, so I'm fairly certain that your friend here did something on his end, let's just say
You fucking piece of shit.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> You say he's an informant?<eos> Actually in his circles, it's better known as a rat.<eos> Or a snitch.<eos> Or maybe just a plain cock-sucking weasel.<eos> So back in the alley there, that was probably... Most likely Feds chasing us.<eos> We probably interrupted one of their recording sessions when we showed up.<eos> I do not feel well.<eos> Do you guys have any idea how altogether fucked you are?
Consider the slate clean.<eos> That's it, it's over?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No need in discussing that this guy had a fucking wire on him when we picked him up?<eos> You already knew that, didn't you?<eos> Look Zach, I think the less we know the better.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Zach, Noah's right, let's just get this over with.<eos> What's left?<eos> Okay, I need each of you to put a bullet in him. What?
Yeah.<eos> No need in discussing that this guy had a fucking wire on him when we picked him up?<eos> You already knew that, didn't you?<eos> Look Zach, I think the less we know the better.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Zach, Noah's right, let's just get this over with.<eos> What's left?<eos> Okay, I need each of you to put a bullet in him. What?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now I know you're asking why, but I'm gonna give you that two-part answer, okay?
I feel like we're in high school, right now!<eos> Right now, at this moment.<eos> We always fuck with him. He loves it!<eos> I put every single one of my clients into that stock.<eos> You're having a pretty shitty morning.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Sorry in advance for making it worse.<eos> You know the man you asked me to look into, Eddie Lovato, seven nephews, all boys.<eos> He doesn't have a niece.<eos> Until my niece gets back, you're gonna do exactly what I want you to do!
And I know the press have taken their shots, but you are coming off of this a winner.<eos> All right, enough about work.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Client of mine's having a barbecue in Grand Isle.<eos> - The fishing village?<eos> - Yeah, the fishing village.<eos> Who do you think my clients are?<eos> Only kind of seafood won't kill you these days.<eos> You got your potatos, you got your corns, little bit of crab oil, some garlic, then you got your Cajun spices, and God help you if you get this in your eyeball.
They understand that people... they need someone to tell them what to remember. And what to forget.<eos> They need great men to insulate them from frailty.<eos> What's good, what's bad.<eos> Because only great men know how to make people's powerlessness tolerable.<eos> My mother grew up a couple miles east of here in Metairie.<eos> My father grew up in the city.<eos> I was raised in Broadmoor. Graduated Jesuit High.<eos> My parents had friends who worked at this plant.<eos> I had friends whose parents worked at this plant.<eos> And I have friends now who work at this plant, some of you are here today.
Easy there, Blitzen.<eos> My old friend, Comet.<eos> It's time.<eos> Who's there? !<eos> Merry Christmas, Bailey Downs!<eos> It's Christmas Eve, the most wonderful time of the year.<eos> I'll tell you what, listeners. "Dangerous Dan" is gonna tell you a secret.
I mean with Will. The way he's been acting.<eos> Yeah, sure, whatever.<eos> You know what, forget it.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Yes!<eos> "Dangerous" Dan!<eos> Let's listen to this Christmas classic.<eos> We should have stayed on the road.<eos> Didn't exactly wear my "trudging through the woods" boots.<eos> Look, this will help us shave a half hour off our walk back to Etta's, plus I gave you all the option of staying in the car.
You sacrificed us for Krampus to save your selfish old ass!<eos> Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.<eos> You don't know the forces that you are playing with.<eos> Yes I do.<eos> And I know something else.<eos> You've been a bad girl.<eos> Mother of God!<eos> Police are telling people just to stay away.<eos> All right, just keep clear of the mall.<eos> I know a lot of you are worried about your friends and family, well the best thing you can do is just stay put.
- It's only me.<eos> Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> It's time.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Put your hands up now!<eos> What the hell is it about Christmas in Bailey Downs?<eos> Are we cursed or something?<eos> Why does this season of love and peace and goodwill keep ending in blood and death and horror?<eos> You keep the spirit in your hearts, you hear me, people, you hug your loved ones and you keep them close and you treat them every Christmas like it might be your last.
I'd say that's against the rules.<eos> And if you break the rules, you have to be reckoned.<eos> That's the sheriff's duty.<eos> What the sheriff does and doesn't do is none of your damn business.<eos> You see, that's where you're wrong.<eos> The future of this town is in our hands.<eos> Not yours, and not your sheriff's.<eos> So you tell him... that if he doesn't do what he needs to do... if he doesn't reckon those traitors soon... someone's going to do it for him.<eos> I will tell him no such thing.<eos> Now you skedaddle... or I'm having the three of you locked up.
Everybody.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Is this really what you want?<eos> Do it!<eos> - I'm not going to kill Kate.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm not here to kill anyone.<eos> I'm here to tell you the truth... because we're running out of time.
He created this prison you live in.<eos> He watches everything you do.<eos> He tells you what job you can hold... who you can marry... and when someone has to die.<eos> He uses fear and violence to control you... because he's afraid that if you know the truth... that you'll self-destruct.<eos> You'll turn on each other.<eos> But can't you see?<eos> That's what's already happening.<eos> The world we knew is gone.<eos> It no longer exists.<eos> You don't have to like it, but you have to accept it.
He drank too much.<eos> Impossible.<eos> -Up I stink of beverages.<eos> Cal!<eos> -Izločimo It.<eos> The time has not yet expired. The rules do not prohibit sleep.<eos> TOURNAMENT<eos> He took off us.<eos> -I Said you can handle.<eos> What about you?
Last time I saw you, you were like...<eos> That must've been what?<eos> - Three, four years ago?<eos> - Uh, Seven.<eos> Seven years, but, you know, close.<eos> So, I see you already got your wristbands.<eos> And this is for food.<eos> And Zara here is going to take great care of you until I'm done working tonight, okay?<eos> You're not coming with us?<eos> I really wish that I could, but tomorrow I can take you into the control room, show you behind the scenes and all of that.

Come on!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Parents be aware, this show may be disturbing for smaller children.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> You were supposed to call me when you landed.<eos> Are you having fun?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Aunt Claire gave us passes, so we don't have to wait in line.<eos> Wait, she's not with you?
There are people in there.<eos> Get them out of there now.<eos> Now!<eos> Paddock 11, this is Control.<eos> You need to evacuate the containment area.<eos> Paddock 11.<eos> Paddock 11, do you copy?<eos> Yeah, what's the problem?<eos> It's in the cage!<eos> It's in there with you!
- Wait, are you following the dinosaur?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Get ACU out here.<eos> Real guns this time.<eos> ACU is airborne.<eos> They took the helicopter.<eos> Who's flying it?<eos> Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?<eos> Afghanistan, sir.<eos> Did your general ever fly into battle with you?
Okay?<eos> Our little side project's about to get a shot in the arm.<eos> I don't want a bunch of lawyers messing around with something that they don't understand.<eos> You get it?<eos> Hey?<eos> I'm gonna take that as a yes.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for your patience.<eos> The next ferry will be leaving in 45 minutes.<eos> If you require immediate medical attention, please report to the nearest health service station.<eos> Is this what you had in mind?
He even fell out with his own son. May God rest his soul.<eos> And I'm sure he won't want anything to do with the child.<eos> Heidi!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Heidi, come here right now!<eos> Coming!<eos> Hello, Grandfather.<eos> Hello, Alp-Uncle.<eos> This is Heidi. Your grandchild.<eos> I've found a position in Frankfurt. So now I'm bringing her to you.
When you're finished, you can go.<eos> But I want to take her with me.<eos> Heidi is staying here.<eos> In the village they say you don't let her go to school.<eos> Because of your obstinacy, she won't learn to read or write!<eos> You want her to turn wild up here?<eos> Why do you care about her all of a sudden?<eos> Uncle, last time I had no other choice.<eos> There's nothing more to say.<eos> If you don't let her go to school, they'll take her away from you and put her in a home.
How will that work?<eos> You can't walk.<eos> Peter!<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> I'm not leaving Klara on her own.<eos> Move, go!<eos> - Peter!<eos> He'll get over it.<eos> We're going!<eos> Heidi, I'd love to go up there with you two.
I love you.<eos> Keep in touch, OK?<eos> - OK. - Bye.<eos> Oh God.<eos> Welcome to Ban Nam.<eos> Hello.<eos> Great that it worked out.<eos> Elisabeth.<eos> Once she finds a gift, she sticks with it.<eos> So, let's show you our partner school.
- Yes. Mr. Miller, a lot of us don't have tents.<eos> Didn't you read the packing list?<eos> - What's that?<eos> The packing list for your parents.<eos> - My parents don't speak German.<eos> So why didn't YOU read it?<eos> Because you said the list was for our parents.<eos> Are we going to bake bread on a stick?<eos> Danger could sleep in my tent.<eos> Yeah, right! Should I gift wrap the optional sex for you, too?
Where's the mascot?<eos> OK.<eos> She's not talking.<eos> OK, time for waterboarding.<eos> Enough, she wants to talk.<eos> You're sick!<eos> She wants more.<eos> No, no, no. My mobile!<eos> No.<eos> I'll tell you where it is, you cunts.
Are you dead?<eos> No!<eos> - Good.<eos> Then I can kill you, fucking kids.<eos> Man, Mr. Miller.<eos> We were trying to help you not to do something stupid!<eos> You're so stupid!<eos> Especially you!<eos> You're not gifted as you might've noticed today!<eos> I can think of 5 million things better than spending one more hour teaching you.
You would not be a a role model.<eos> Are you afraid you're not good enough?<eos> What are you after?<eos> - Just answer.<eos> I don't have to answer a child.<eos> He lacks objectivity.<eos> And he has massive complexes.<eos> We should call our parents.<eos> You're not calling anyone until I have my diamonds!<eos> None of you!

Forever 21?
What are you?<eos> - Teacher.<eos> What?<eos> Who's that?<eos> He's an orphan too.<eos> They're friends.<eos> They're expressing sympathy.<eos> Our stuff!<eos> Our phones!<eos> We'll help you.
I mean your parents.<eos> Who gave up alcohol and nicotine for nine months, most of them anyway.<eos> And who had to watch helplessly as their innocent, sweet babies became shitheads.<eos> - What did you write?<eos> Mom, dad, thanks to Mr. Miller, this is the nicest place I've been.<eos> A lie.<eos> - But I'm totally homesick.<eos> I know I never say so, but I love you.<eos> God, how embarrassing.<eos> - Oh my God. I hope you can forgive me for not always being the way you imagined.

How sweet!<eos> To me, you're gifted. Gifted at dressing like a slut, dissing people, and in driving me nuts.<eos> Maybe because you're important to me. Even if I won't always be your teacher.<eos> You'll never be alone as long as I'm here.<eos> Please stop drawing hearts on my sneakers, it's incredibly annoying.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Who's it from?<eos> From me, you freak.<eos> Is she getting better grades than us now?<eos> I dislike you all equally.
He wants us to grow... up out...<eos> To grow out of it.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Mr. Miller is an asshole.<eos> - Yeah, but all teachers are assholes.<eos> Better a cool asshole.<eos> - Ms. Schnabelstedt deserves better.<eos> What's she look like naked?<eos> Is she prettier than me?<eos> I don't want to hurt either one of you.
I just want to let you know that.<eos> I was desperate.<eos> I just- I felt so fuckin' powerless.<eos> - You are not powerless, Brodie.<eos> You can still stop this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> - What was that, guys?<eos> - Shit.<eos> - There's something in there.<eos> - Which one of you cunts wants to be skull-fucked first?
Well, it's obviously a mistake.<eos> Get Jim Hobart... no, Ferg Donnelly on the horn.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Ladies, this is how rumors get started.<eos> So this stays in this room till things get sorted out.<eos> Back to work.<eos> I'll get Ferg.<eos> So now I just want you to play.<eos> Just pretend we're not here.<eos> I'm giving you my permission to play with all these great toys.
I wish I could see the look on your face.<eos> I bet you're not laughing anymore, are you?<eos> No, Lou, I'm not.<eos> Well, sayonara, my friend.<eos> Enjoy the rest of your miserable life.<eos> Meredith.<eos> If we're trying to keep the office calm, closing those curtains is a bad idea.<eos> So spill it. Have you heard something? Yes, I did.<eos> Lou's moving to Tokyo.<eos> I'm not even going to tell you why because it would give him pleasure.
We know it was hard enough to convince you to stay when McCann bought us.<eos> I can't imagine how you feel about things now.<eos> Yeah, I'm not going.<eos> So we are proposing that we retain our independence in our California office with a few select clients who've insisted on it.<eos> Who else is going?<eos> Burger Chef and Sunkist so far.<eos> It's strictly for conflicts.<eos> And, well, conflicts.<eos> Tell your superiors nothing is going to change.<eos> I know I always come at you guns blazing, but to them, I'm still the new guy and Ed's son-in-law.
Now he obviously thinks it's less bold to change agencies.<eos> You're wrong. Dow would be thrilled to finally have all their accounts at McManus, John Adams.<eos> Kenny, you know that we know this account inside and out and we have Don Draper.<eos> That's why you stayed anyway.<eos> That's true.<eos> We've done this before.<eos> You know we can.<eos> You know, I've fantasized that one day I'd be in this situation with you, Roger.<eos> And, Pete, well, you're not exactly an innocent bystander.<eos> I've toyed with you long enough.
I discovered a plan to reclaim a prize that is so large that it would upset our world here.<eos> Go get us our prize.<eos> - Are you Underhill?<eos> - I am.<eos> We've no quarrel with you.
But there may be something I can give you to make it work.<eos> And of all the villains on the sea to which we have become accustomed to fearing, is there a name spoken more frequently or with more revulsion than Flint?<eos> Until today and then potentially never again.<eos> Burn in hell!<eos> Now cast your gaze upon this once fearsome animal, brought down by his own hubris and folly.<eos> The villain Flint who perverts the law, kidnaps our women, and slays our blessed sons.<eos> I meant what I said earlier.<eos> This outcome, it's not at all what I would have wanted.<eos> Vice Admiral Lord Kensington.<eos> I don't need to explain to you his interest in achieving the greatest possible exposure for this proceeding.
How would I know that?<eos> Find out for me, please.<eos> And have it made ready for me immediately.<eos> To buy what?<eos> This journey will be a strange one, gents.<eos> Unlike any we've taken before.<eos> Because of that, I have been coy with certain details.<eos> Namely what it is exactly we'll be hunting.<eos> That ends now.<eos> Brace yourselves, gents, and let me tell you a story about a Spaniard named Vazquez.
There's no way of keeping that out of the record?<eos> Could you?<eos> Of course you could.<eos> You could just throw it into the fire.<eos> But should you?<eos> It was produced in front of your entire constituency.<eos> You are the protector of the law in this place and you brazenly disregard that at your own peril.<eos> All it takes is one juror to be taken in by this, one juror to be seduced by the scandal of it all... and Flint goes free.<eos> Flint isn't going anywhere.<eos> That book might engender a couple of unpleasant months for you here, raise a couple of uncomfortable questions, but what it will not do is affect the outcome of Flint's trial.
A moment's peace?<eos> Far from it.<eos> I heard the Guthrie shipping concern was officially disbanded.<eos> Captains Naft and Lawrence's crews scattered to the wind.<eos> And Mr. Frasier left to preside over its remains, empty warehouses, and this tavern.<eos> Were I in your situation, I might be willing to consider selling whatever interests I had left here and moving on to a more civilized place.<eos> I've heard I ought to expect this visit.<eos> Heard that the madame from the inn has been taking advantage of the panic in the street, offering the merchants pennies for their interests.<eos> For a few whose faith in this place was truly waning, the chance to leave with anything to show for their interests was a blessing.<eos> You'll find me less eager to sell than the others, for I know that your faith in this place is derived from the secret knowledge that it is soon to be awash with Spanish gold.
So that's it.<eos> You believe you can leap into Miss Guthrie's shoes and lord over what remains of their family's enterprise.<eos> I have no interest in making the same mistakes Eleanor did.<eos> No interest in fencing their plunder.<eos> No interest in lording over them in any way.<eos> For people like us, power in this place is most effective when it is least perceived.<eos> That is my offer to purchase your inherited interest in this tavern.<eos> It is more generous than any of the others received by your colleagues.<eos> I will expect your response by nightfall.<eos> Why is this so important to you?
"I have to tell you what I know.<eos> The ship was set upon by Captain Flint."<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I wish to speak on behalf of the defendant.<eos> You have not been recognized. Sit back and you'll...<eos> These men convinced you that they speak for you.<eos> - That the power you've given them is used in your interests.<eos> I will not have the order in my court usurped by your foul desires.<eos> That the prisoner before you is your enemy and they your friends.<eos> For those of you who live to see tomorrow... know that you had a choice to see the truth and you let yourselves be convinced otherwise.
SoI 'mleavingSanFrancisco tolivein halifax,Canada.<eos> AlthoughI 'msad toleaveXY magazine,<eos> I'mexcitedto finallyaccept thespeakingoffers I'vebeenreceiving thispastyear, thankstomy work asa writerandactivist.<eos> What a lot of people aren't aware of is that the terms "heterosexual" and "homosexual"<eos> were only introduced about a hundred years ago.<eos> Asmymother usedtoalwayssay ,<eos> "whenyouhelpothers, you'rehelpingyourself aswell."<eos> We often read about more sexually...<eos> Mygoalis to threadaneedle throughthefabric ofthiscountry andstitchtogetherthe lives ofgaykidseverywhere.<eos> I know a lot of you are balancing religion and sexuality, but I mean, come on, what god would punish you for finding love?
I want you to know how much you meant to me.<eos> I know you don't care anymore.<eos> But I needed to say it.<eos> For closure.<eos> This whole thing... It broke my heart.<eos> Tyler... I'm sorry. But I need to live for myself now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Take care.<eos> Now, sometimes somebody's gonna ask you what you believe.
He showed me the truth.<eos> A lot of people have pasts they're not proud of, but god forgives, right?<eos> My life has changed so much since I've met you.<eos> And my feelings for you are real.<eos> My feelings for you are real, too.<eos> But I feel like we should just keep hanging out and see what happens.<eos> Maybe not settle on anything too specific. If that's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi, I'm Michael.<eos> Now, I wanna tell you a little secret about a great gift from god.
You're to hand over the Great Seal.<eos> Apparently, a written request from the King is necessary.<eos> Do you have one?<eos> No?<eos> Oh, that's careless.<eos> My lawyer, Thomas Cromwell.<eos> You want us to ride back to Windsor for a piece of paper?<eos> In this weather?<eos> Ah, I see, yes.<eos> Actually, my lawyer tells me I can't give you the Seal, written request or no.
Well, you can forget all talk of pledges and witnesses.<eos> Now, get his father down from the borders.<eos> And if the prodigal defies his father, he'll be tossed out of his heirdom on his prodigal snout.<eos> Now, get your daughter married into Ireland before her intended hears any rumours of spoiled goods.<eos> Finished, My Lord Cardinal?<eos> Finished.<eos> Butcher's boy.<eos> Butcher's dog!<eos> Come out, dog!<eos> He's talking to you.
Pity.<eos> A son.<eos> The King wants a son.<eos> Eighteen years of marriage with no heir.<eos> Now, he's decided some sin must have been committed to cause this curse.<eos> God, where did you learn this?<eos> At the docks, little after I left home.<eos> Earned a living from it for a while.<eos> Everyone thought they could beat a child.<eos> What else should I know about you, monstrous servant?
What else should I know about you, monstrous servant?<eos> Once, in Italy, I held a snake for a bet.<eos> Was it poisonous?<eos> We didn't know. That was the point of the bet.<eos> The sin?<eos> Oh, yes, the sin.<eos> I remember when they brought the Queen over from Spain to marry Henry's brother Prince Arthur.<eos> Sixteen, barely a word of English.<eos> But when she danced, her red hair slid over her shoulder...<eos> God forgive you.
Here, take.<eos> Now, in this current emergency, it will be to me that Pope Clement looks to, well, keep Christendom together.<eos> So, suppose if I were to travel to France, and gather together the cardinals in a council, you know, to conduct the business of the Church in the Pope's absence.<eos> Now, if this business just happened to include the King's private matter, might we not roll on it?<eos> And voilà, the King of England will be a bachelor.<eos> What?<eos> Not more gossip from the silk merchants.<eos> Rumour is, the King has moved from Mary Boleyn to her flat-chested sister.<eos> Anne?<eos> She hasn't forgiven you for that business with Harry Percy. Well...
If it wasn't for the law, I'd be a lord.<eos> Cromwells had money.<eos> We had estates, thieved off us by lawyers.<eos> Suppose you don't admit to me now, do you?<eos> Suppose you hoped I'd be dead.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> My wife told me I should come see you.<eos> Well, now you have. Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> Master, I have a question to put to you.
So, what next?<eos> A new plan, a Legatine Court.<eos> We ask the Pope to send his envoy to act in his name, and rule here in England on the validity of the King's marriage to Katherine.<eos> Urn, when you were in France, my wife and daughters died. Oh, Tom.<eos> "Whom the Lord loveth..."<eos> Master Cromwell?<eos> Thomas Cromwell reading a prayer book?<eos> Now I know how bad things are.<eos> How is he?<eos> He asks after you the minute you've gone.
-No.<eos> Well, you might not think of us, Mark, but we think of you.<eos> - Purkoy!<eos> Don't let him out!<eos> Lady Anne.<eos> Master Cromwell.<eos> You have your inventories?<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> Since My Lord Cardinal's reduction, have you seen much progress in your cause?<eos> He's the only man in England who can obtain for you what you need.
He's the only man in England who can obtain for you what you need.<eos> Very well.<eos> Make his case.<eos> You have five minutes.<eos> Otherwise, I can see you're really busy.<eos> The Cardinal's the only man who can deliver an annulment from the Pope. He's the only man who can deliver the King's conscience, and deliver it clean.<eos> -If the King wants it, and according to you, the Cardinal, formerly the chief subject of the kingdom, wants it, then I must say, Master Cromwell, it's all taking a marvellous long while to come to pass.<eos> And she's not getting any younger.<eos> No one's more distressed than the Cardinal that the King cannot have his heart's desire, which was ever the Cardinal's desire too.<eos> He knows that all the King's subjects repose their hopes in you -for an heir to the throne.
Because if I'm not there to speak for the Cardinal, they'll kill him.<eos> Cromwell, I am content you are a burgess in the Parliament.<eos> My Lord.<eos> I spoke to the King for you, and he is also content.<eos> You will take his instructions in the Commons, and mine.<eos> Will they be the same, My Lord? God damn it.<eos> Cromwell, why are you such a person?<eos> It's not as if you can afford to be.<eos> Oh, smile away.<eos> The King will grant you an audience, but he is preparing a quarrel against you, Master.
- How can a butcher's son understand... -Lagloire?<eos> Are you a butcher's son? Blacksmith's.<eos> Are you really?<eos> Could you shoe a horse?<eos> If I were put to it.<eos> I was a soldier myself.<eos> Oh, were you?<eos> Were you?<eos> Not with any English army, I'll be bound.<eos> I knew there was something about you that I didn't like.
- But there was one that stood out.<eos> And what was his name?<eos> JoJo.<eos> He operates around this area.<eos> Lady backpackers or foreigners who need money.<eos> Nothing there.<eos> A couple of regulars recognized them, but didn't really know who they were.<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> You guy... You two look a bit lost.<eos> How can I help you?
I'm in love with her.<eos> You're married.<eos> You love your wife, too?<eos> Was Angel in love with you?<eos> - So you killed her?<eos> - What?<eos> She's dead?<eos> - And you are?<eos> - He's my father.<eos> How long have you been seeing her?
What do you not understand?<eos> I need immediate backup.<eos> These girls are in real danger.<eos> I'll pass along your message, Detective.<eos> Controlling, relentless, vindictive, schizo crazy bitch.<eos> My wife is like Satan with a fat ass.<eos> If she comes home from Boca and I don't have my wedding ring...<eos> Did I mention it was her grandpa's ring?<eos> You want to hear the gory details that the ring survived Dachau and her grandfather did not?<eos> Which one of you ladies is gonna tell me where my ring is?
Here, put.<eos> This is the hand he holds...<eos> He prefers holding his sword to my hand...<eos> But he holds your hand dearer than any sword.<eos> He has held my hand without letting go of yours...<eos> He has loved me, but not broken ties with you.<eos> He may call me his inspiration, but you remain his strength...<eos> His love for you has not withered.<eos> I may be illegitimate, but your coming here..<eos> "has validated my presence amongst you all.
Maybe you don't know this, but the mistreatment of animals is a federal crime.<eos> Is this funny to you?<eos> They can bring formal charges against you, and you could lose your job.<eos> Do you not need your job, Santiago?<eos> Yes, I need it.<eos> Mr. Murphy, do you recognize these men?<eos> Yeah, you guys stalled me at the airport so you could take my passport and copy and scan it, didn't you?<eos> - What?<eos> - May I?<eos> You both are being accused of conspiring against a federal agent of the United States.
- You think extradition's a victory.<eos> - It is.<eos> Escobar will not go lightly.<eos> He will make Colombia bleed.<eos> Now more than ever is the time for solidarity.<eos> You make the mistakes, and then you preach solidarity?<eos> - Shut up, fag.<eos> - What the fuck, Carlos?<eos> Why are you always defending him?<eos> Did he get your sister back for you or not?
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist countries with or without cocaine, that would be considered treason by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?<eos> Well, damn... you guys are good.<eos> Communist sympathizer.<eos> We're gonna wrap you up in a big, red bow and drop you right off at Reagan's doorstep.<eos> Using Cuba and Nicaragua as refueling stops for coke shipments, that's treason and trafficking.<eos> What's that, two life sentences for the price of one?<eos> That's right.<eos> Well... see, I figured this day might come.<eos> Why don't you uncuff me, boys.<eos> I got something to show you.
Did you do something wrong?<eos> Your dad did nothing wrong.<eos> These are people who are jealous of us, who are trying to take what we have.<eos> You have to be strong.<eos> I want you to be strong.<eos> You have to be strong and never show weakness.<eos> I promise I'll never be weak.<eos> And watch out for your sister.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> I love you all very much.
The Medellín cartel was Miami:<eos> swimming pools, bikini girls... tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.<eos> - The Cali cartel was New York:<eos> elegant, smooth, subtle.<eos> Where they could fuel the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine, and still make sure everybody showed up for work on Wall Street the next morning.<eos> At first, Medellín and Cali worked side by side.<eos> But in Colombia, when money's involved, blood inevitably flows.<eos> There had been violence between Medellín and Cali before.<eos> But right now, a war on two fronts was not something Pablo could afford.<eos> We have Miami... and have left you alone in New York.
If he asks me... of course.<eos> There is no way around it.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> All right, all right, let's just go find this girl.<eos> We'll look around and see where she's hiding.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Here you go.<eos> It's OK, Natalie.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Before you know it, we'll get you some food. Right?
And for you, visiting days will be... every day.<eos> - I'm serious, Pablo.<eos> - So am I.<eos> The problem, Pablo, is that... now that you have admitted to trafficking in narcotics, my image as a journalist cannot be associated with yours.<eos> So then... now you think I am going to damage your credibility as a journalist... is that it?<eos> You understand what I'm saying.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I think that... it's time for me to set you free, so that...<eos> you can find a boyfriend who's honest... so that you can get a little house, have little kids,
We should give him credit.<eos> The man is a genius.<eos> Well... all the more reason that we should negotiate our surrender.<eos> But you know that Pablo took it upon himself to close that door.<eos> So we need to take advantage of your political contacts, especially General Jaramillo.<eos> Can you talk to him for us?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> But I don't think it will be enough.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That you're going to have to offer something more, something that interests them enough to make a deal with you.
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá in a bombing you coordinated.<eos> She was 17 years old.<eos> And this guy here... this is Trujillo.<eos> You killed his father and his brother for being cops.<eos> - That has nothing to do with me.<eos> - No?<eos> You know... if you support evil, you are evil.<eos> Look at them.<eos> I just want you to look at their faces.<eos> A few of the victims you've left in your wake.
- All right.<eos> - Go on.<eos> How are you doing, son?<eos> I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.<eos> When... you were nine... or ten...<eos> How you would ride around on your bicycles.<eos> You'd go up into the mountains and just disappear.<eos> The whole day would go by...<eos> And we would call you...<eos> We seemed crazy, yelling for you all over the place... until finally you would appear.
Pablo won't accept anything under $12 million, Pacho.<eos> Twelve million is nothing to you.<eos> Do you want to know something?<eos> It's over.<eos> What's over?<eos> - The Medellín cartel.<eos> No, you're wrong, Pacho.<eos> We export twice the amount you do.<eos> You invited me here to give me this line of bullshit?<eos> Pablo put a war tax on the two of you for $250,000 a month.
- Gentlemen!<eos> - What a bumpy ride, Paisa.<eos> Where did you learn to drive?<eos> We closed the deal at ten million dollars.<eos> This takes care of the problem we had in LA and ends the war.<eos> Sounds like a good proposition.<eos> Do you know what this means, boss?<eos> We can maintain our infrastructure and the government won't be the wiser.<eos> That way, we can... double our exports in less than a month, Pablo.<eos> How did he behave... when he offered you the money?
That way, we can... double our exports in less than a month, Pablo.<eos> How did he behave... when he offered you the money?<eos> What do you mean, "how did he behave"?<eos> What was his attitude?<eos> Well... he was respectful, Pablo.<eos> Respectful in what way?<eos> - He wants peace, just like us.<eos> - Yes, but... how did he react when you told him our solution?<eos> In a positive manner.<eos> He just offered you the money, just like that?
Respectful in what way?<eos> - He wants peace, just like us.<eos> - Yes, but... how did he react when you told him our solution?<eos> In a positive manner.<eos> He just offered you the money, just like that?<eos> Well... he started at three million dollars.<eos> Right?<eos> - But we said no, and told him you wouldn't take less than 12.<eos> So he offered ten, and we felt that was a fair deal.<eos> Offered you three million?
If he really respected me, he would be grateful if I accepted 20.<eos> That's right, boss.<eos> Ask for 20. In one shot.<eos> Tell him I'm not happy with less than 30.<eos> The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.<eos> Thirty million...<eos> if Cali wants peace.<eos> Very good.<eos> I also need to raise the war tax.<eos> From now on, a million a month, for both of you...
Don't destroy the talisman - it's too powerful... too important.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - Let me take Andy's place.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> I'll go willingly...<eos> And you'll be safe.<eos> You can keep your powers.<eos> It's a fair deal.<eos> The kid has a point.<eos> Neither of you know what it's like.
- Pretending to be Detective Murphy.<eos> - I'm not pretending. I...<eos> Look, long story short, is he here or not?<eos> - Why do you keep saying that?<eos> - Saying what?<eos> It's annoying enough when Detective Murphy says it.<eos> It is?<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I'll make a call.<eos> Dudes, I am telling you
- This is not good.<eos> - Oh, finally!<eos> If you're Sam - and Sam is Roland, then we just told Roland everything.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Your mum is coming to get you as soon as she can.<eos> My mum...?<eos> Roberts, this is ridiculous - I'm a grown man.<eos> I thought I knew everything when I was your age too.<eos> I'm older than you!<eos> What happened to you boys when you went missing?
You're flickering.<eos> Why are you flickering?<eos> You still don't understand, Andy.<eos> We think we've found another altar.<eos> It's miles away, and we don't have much time.<eos> Alright. But you're not all going to fit in my car.<eos> Seriously? It's an emergency, and you're worrying about seatbelts?<eos> Yeah, seriously!<eos> I'm still an officer of the law.<eos> I'll take four of you, max.
Those dead Mutts... how could Malcolm kill them all?<eos> This was on the neck of the people who attacked us.<eos> None of this makes any sense.<eos> Malcolm's in Baton Rouge.<eos> Do you know where he'll be?<eos> Clayton: (On phone) I have an idea.<eos> A spider hole he used to hide in when he was hurt.<eos> I'll text you the coordinates.<eos> Nick: (On phone) There's something else.<eos> Jeremy didn't give you the full picture.
We can communicate with Savannah.<eos> That's how we know about Aleister.<eos> And that there is a werewolf on the compound that gave up Malcolm's name.<eos> They attacked his house in Rochester, but he escaped.<eos> But as dangerous as your wolf may be, he pales in comparison to Aleister.<eos> Savannah has been through so much.<eos> She's impressionable.<eos> This monster... abducted her right from our home.<eos> A 12-year-old girl.<eos> We'll help you find your little girl.
There is also the stench of bleach, as if you're trying to cover something up. Elena:<eos> There was a lot of carnage.<eos> We take pride in our home and everything in it.<eos> Have you seen our Legacy?<eos> Quite the collection, yes.<eos> I may have leapt to a hasty assumption.<eos> I've seen everything I need to see.<eos> My humble apologies.<eos> One can only hope that every Pack member is as loyal to their Alpha as you clearly are to Rodrigo.<eos> I wish you best efforts in finding him.
We stand down now, Savannah may never come back.<eos> I want her back just as much as you do.<eos> I was there when he took her.<eos> I didn't protect her.<eos> This thing, this Aleister...<eos> I will not let our future be dictated this man.<eos> He's not just a man.<eos> Paige, this is all we have.<eos> Savannah... are you with us?<eos> Savannah's voice: I'm with you.
Four hours combing the area by the barn.<eos> She could be anywhere by now.<eos> What about the back roads?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Paige has made the connection.<eos> If they're anywhere near Savannah, she'll know.<eos> I still can't believe this is our best shot at finding them.<eos> Their telepathy has been useful to us in the past.<eos> Savannah, are you with us?<eos> I am with you.
I'm just trying to protect you.<eos> Oh, so now you're my friend, huh?<eos> I recognize how special you are.<eos> I don't want harm to come to you.<eos> Why aren't you like everyone else, hypnotized?<eos> I don't need "the focus" to have passion for my work.<eos> This is a great honor, Elena.<eos> You can lift the veil on so many mysteries.<eos> Together, we can achieve great things.<eos> I'm not going to help you.
I can help you.<eos> Quick, jump over.<eos> We're getting you out of here.<eos> Run.<eos> Stop fighting.<eos> Focus on Changing back.<eos> Back away.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Aleister: How did this happen?<eos> None of you would touch this.
And I would kill to protect you, okay?<eos> We're going to get out of here, Savannah.<eos> I did what had to be done, okay?<eos> I'll keep an open channel for Paige.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> There's no time to waste.<eos> We need to reach Savannah.<eos> Clay: Where have you been?<eos> Ruth: Finding the truth.<eos> I haven't been fully transparent with you, until now.
You're afraid of what you'll find.<eos> (Banging continues) Clay: Descending stairs into darkness... a dream that means death.<eos> It's the only way out.<eos> (Banging) Don't go.<eos> There's no room for fear.<eos> What's down there, let it tear down the walls, let it set you free.<eos> His scent is here, but it's weak.<eos> We need to split up.<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> I don't want either of you to do what needs to be done.
I didn't have a choice.<eos> It was the Prophesy.<eos> Say it, Mother!<eos> You ordered the execution of an innocent child.<eos> Yes.<eos> You were a problem and I needed you dead.<eos> It was me.<eos> It was my choice.<eos> But if you care about innocent people, then let them live. No.<eos> None of you are innocent.
Let's finish this.<eos> It's okay...<eos> - Argh!<eos> - Is he okay? It's the first wave of the Change.<eos> He's caught in the pain.<eos> It's affecting all of us.<eos> Oh, save your strength, sweetheart.<eos> How are you alive?<eos> We came to an understanding.<eos> I'm with you on this, all right?
It's done.<eos> It's over.<eos> What your mother did for Elena, for all of us...<eos> She saved us.<eos> But she's gone.<eos> No, she's not.<eos> She's in this place, and her spirit guides us.<eos> Always.<eos> There was a time when you came to me, and I turned you away.<eos> I promise you, I will never turn you away again.
This is for Yoshino. And Chika. And these are for Suzu-chan.<eos> - Are you not coming in?<eos> - I have a plane to catch.<eos> And I want to visit my mother's grave.<eos> I see.<eos> See you. Take care of yourself.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'll come with you to the grave.<eos> Auntie scolded me.<eos> She told me the house belongs to you all now.
And I want to visit my mother's grave.<eos> I see.<eos> See you. Take care of yourself.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'll come with you to the grave.<eos> Auntie scolded me.<eos> She told me the house belongs to you all now.<eos> I didn't realise.<eos> I felt suffocated, living there.<eos> I never thought that house would become so precious to you.
I wonder... Maybe the garden veranda.<eos> At this rate, you'll never get married and move out.<eos> Ask me, too.<eos> You have strange tastes.<eos> You're mean.<eos> You, Suzu?<eos> I have a lot.<eos> I made a lot.<eos> But you're still a kid.<eos> Compared to all of you.
I had it sculpted nice and big just to remind myself of my humble beginnings.<eos> Anyway, back to you.<eos> Let's have a look at these little guys over here.<eos> So, if you wanna look like one of your drawings, I would go with this one. Right here.<eos> How much?<eos> Wow.<eos> - That's a lot of money. - Mhm. I've been saving up to buy a condo.<eos> Well just remember, you can't show off your condo at the beach.<eos> Hey, guys. Carl Stromway here.<eos> I just wanna introduce a special tool that'll help all of you who wanna show off that sexy body at the beach this summer.
Is it true that, some time ago, you gave your violin to me so that my cousin could sell it?<eos> And when he promised to undertake the consignation, did he give you a receipt?<eos> Get the receipt.<eos> Thank you, Bennemin.<eos> I return the receipt to you, dear cousin.<eos> And this, good Bennemin, is for you.<eos> A hundred dollars.<eos> It was sold for three times the asking price to an American.<eos> All you peat diggers must be wondering why we are here, what our business here could be.<eos> Well, you too are offered the opportunity to enter it into a contract. Whereby you would be signing a form which in away is an IOU but which is not valid once the money has been repaid. Right, cousin?
You've been through hard times.<eos> The years of peat are numbered.<eos> The future lies elsewhere.<eos> Your future lies elsewhere.<eos> To be exact: in the United States of America.<eos> From now on you're no longer peat diggers, but colonists.<eos> Entrepreneurs, in fact.<eos> You've taken out a mortgage on your future wage by financing the journey.<eos> Before long you will all be free people in a free country.<eos> I wish you a safe journey and I thank you for your trust also on behalf of my cousin Walter Vedder without whom this would not have been possible.
- Yeah.<eos> Hey, pretty lady.<eos> You know, I'm really excited to chat with you tonight.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If everybody could listen up for a second...<eos> Fiona made the turkey tonight.<eos> I got dibs on the drumstick.<eos> The drumstick's mine.<eos> You know this has been a really difficult time for me.<eos> I wanted to say how thankful I am for each and every one of you.
John came by here yesterday.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What'd you tell him?<eos> I told him you spent the night.<eos> Anything else?<eos> What else could I tell him?<eos> I don't know what you boys are up to.<eos> Who says we're up to anything?<eos> You boys are always up to something.<eos> That's what makes you so fun.
- Few weeks ago.<eos> - She kicked you out?<eos> - Sleeping at the boatyard.<eos> I didn't notice. You seemed fine this weekend.<eos> All an act. Well, for her, anyway.<eos> Don't tell anybody. Okay?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> - I don't want people knowing.<eos> With Dad sick in the hospital, I don't want people knowing.<eos> What happened between you guys?
How old are you?<eos> Hmm, 17.<eos> 17?<eos> Like, soon.<eos> I fucking love Europe.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Hi, this is Nora's voice mail.<eos> You can leave a message after the beep tone.<eos> Please do know that I'll be out of Paris Until the fifth of January.<eos> I wish you all a very happy New Year.
What the fuck were you doing with this girl?<eos> She wanted to do coke.<eos> Well what about your fly?<eos> What?<eos> Close your fly. Oh shit...<eos> You know I was knocking.<eos> The music's loud.<eos> Yeah, but not enough To make me not hear what you were doing.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I hear you!
I'm sorry.<eos> This weekend was once in a lifetime for our family.<eos> And you were just gonna leave us all behind to wonder what in God's name you were doing God knows where?<eos> I didn't wanna leave.<eos> Stop trying to make me feel better.<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> No one told you, did they?<eos> They didn't tell-- Mama, I- - I asked to come home.<eos> I wanted to move back.<eos> I wanna work with you.
Pinocchio... you don't understand shit.<eos> Listen, Gypsy, I don't want to get into trouble because of your business. Fuck off!<eos> If it wasn't for me you'd still be selling peanuts!<eos> Aren't we planning on robbing an armored cash van?<eos> And now what the fuck is going on with these Neapolitans?<eos> Riccardo, you talk to him because he is pissing me off!<eos> Pinocchio is right.<eos> Before having decided for everybody, don't you think you should have asked?<eos> But they just called.<eos> The load arrives tonight, when was I supposed to tell you?
Gripping onto a rock<eos> In the middle of the arctic ocean.<eos> We're alone.<eos> We need each other.<eos> And when we lose someone from the town, We feel it.<eos> That also makes us strong. Together.<eos> It'll take time for us to get over this, But we will.<eos> Summer's coming. There will be better days. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... For those of you who are leaving us,
She can have you, just go!<eos> What is going on with you two?
I need you to do a quantitative PCR on some fluid stains.<eos> Then a capillary electrophoresis.<eos> We would like you to cross check it with the DNA from an eyebrow follicle.<eos> Is this a blood swab?<eos> - Yes. - Whose blood?<eos> That is what we have to establish as fast as we can.<eos> The Professor's?<eos> I'm not allowed to say.<eos> The lab is not forensically accredited is it?<eos> No. Any results we give you wouldn't be admissible as evidence.
I think it works more as a metaphor Than science in many ways.<eos> But it's true, there appears to be<eos> Some strange behavior among the animals here...<eos> And what are we doing?<eos> Building ice-hotels.<eos> Investors over people Every time for the governor!<eos> You don't know what you're talking about, you old cunt.<eos> Investors are people.<eos> And they're the only ones that matter to her, aren't they?<eos> You sharing the kickback, are you?
Ask me any question you want.<eos> Don't worry. I will.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> See you tomorrow, then. Yep.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was with Carrie.<eos> She's asleep, at last.<eos> Good.<eos> I just wanted to check and see if you were okay.
Tell me!<eos> Tell me!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Frank!<eos> My God.<eos> If we don't get the truth, they'll take Liam.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Look at the state you've got yourself into.<eos> Look at the pair of you.
She who holds the pocketbook.<eos> Here, look at this.<eos> My newest crime.<eos> Still under construction, of course.<eos> Details are hard to come by on this one.<eos> It's so recent.<eos> Though the newspapers have provided some guidance.<eos> But before long, we'll have it all sorted out.<eos> Our grisly murderer exposed to the eyes of London at two shillings a peep.<eos> I give you the Mariner's Inn massacre.
Get that tarpaulin in the corner and the bucket there.<eos> On the floor.<eos> Was a sail on a ship long time ago.<eos> It's waxed for them storms, you know, at sea.<eos> Pull up your skirt and lie down.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> - Get ready with the pot.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Think about this next time you let that dandy man put his hand in your skirt.<eos> What will I do with you girls?
Better still...<eos> May he let us know when we are home.<eos> Now, put this cursed thing back and bring me my box.<eos> And God tells us our duty in Leviticus.<eos> A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death.<eos> Aye.<eos> Right.<eos> They shall be stoned with stones.<eos> Their blood shall be upon them.<eos> Will I picture you a future, lads?
And God tells us our duty in Leviticus.<eos> A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death.<eos> Aye.<eos> Right.<eos> They shall be stoned with stones.<eos> Their blood shall be upon them.<eos> Will I picture you a future, lads?<eos> That woman, unchecked, leads to my ruination.<eos> I'll have no choice but to close the manor and find me better grazing land eastward.<eos> What'll happen to you, then, Jack?
What'll happen to you, then, Jack?<eos> We sell off.<eos> And who's to buy?<eos> Who's to buy any of it, Jack?<eos> Spencer?<eos> Hugh Martin?<eos> Gil Taylor?<eos> Tell me, who'll buy your land, this dead land where nothing will graze?<eos> You'll be properly like the bloody Irish, then. Digging out spuds with your fingernails.<eos> Starving day by day while your little ones die afore you.
See you.<eos> Monsters are not accepted in the human world.<eos> If any of them crossed the border, we used to have the Monster Hunt Bureau take care of them.<eos> And they did such a good job that people nowadays don't know monsters even exist.<eos> Since the last dynasty, almost all monsters crossing the border were caught.<eos> The Monster Hunt Bureau... became useless and closed.<eos> Great monster hunters like you turned into normal people... and served small businessmen like me.<eos> You were totally wronged.<eos> Now, your time has come!<eos> If one of you... can grab that expected baby monster king, the monster world will be in chaos... and monsters will flee all over.
Yingying.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> This is my husband Zhengtao.<eos> This is Miss Huo.<eos> Nice to meet you, Miss Huo.<eos> Let me tell you.<eos> We should hire a bodyguard... like them.<eos> They said... if hiring a bodyguard, we should look for those with coins hanging on them... for prestige!<eos> Fine, fine, fine.<eos> I'll let you girls chat.
He died.<eos> What?<eos> I'm fine too.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> The baby is so quiet.<eos> No crying-<eos> Where's Niuniu?<eos> Niuniu?<eos> Niuniu may have gone to see the baby.<eos> Does any of you inside see Niuniu?
We loved each other.<eos> Then you had to come back with your metal plate and your head full of bees.<eos> Chester, stop, I-I can't pull my my feet through! Stop...<eos> Stop talking.<eos> - You're distracting me. - When are you gonna do real magic?<eos> Stop it, Marjorie.<eos> Haven't you done enough to ruin my life?<eos> You're nothing without me.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Every one of you.
Well... looks like... you get a shot at a normal life now.<eos> Jimmy... I'm happy for you.<eos> How dare you come in here unannounced.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You need to leave.<eos> What are you babbling about?<eos> Your monsters.<eos> They have been plotting their revenge all day in Ethel's caravan.<eos> They're gonna kill you.<eos> Why should I believe you, huh?
We should just leave, all of us, join a new show.<eos> Penny, do you really think if there wasn't another option, some other freak show out there, I wouldn't take you away in an instant?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> Our world is dying, sweetheart.<eos> This is the end of the line.<eos> But we've got to eat, and that kid's got money pouring out of his ears.<eos> I say we let him keep feeding us until that lemon runs out of juice.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Turn it off!<eos> I told you a million trillion times, the blue light is for "Night and Day."
The town hasn't gotten wind of your new act.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You must have done something wrong.<eos> Sir, this is quite typical.<eos> You haven't got a lot of experience in this sort of thing, but you'll see.<eos> You think you're so smart.<eos> You don't know anything, you stupid freak.<eos> He's only trying to help.<eos> Oh, shut up, you ugly cow.<eos> No one cares what you think, any of you.
Oh, shut up, you ugly cow.<eos> No one cares what you think, any of you.<eos> I'm in charge here, and I say it's your fault.<eos> Obviously, no one's coming to the show because you are boring.<eos> The town has had their fill of your mediocre oddities.<eos> The thrill is gone.<eos> You're yesterday's news.<eos> Audiences want a new type of freak.<eos> Something different.<eos> Maybe I need to give you all some new, startling look.
We're just getting started.<eos> Maid, you're very poorly trained.<eos> You're not allowed to sit at the table with us.<eos> I ain't no maid.<eos> Mm, ring any bells?<eos> I know we all look alike to you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Wedding night's been cancelled. You've been had.<eos> Did you honestly think, for one second, that we'd lay with you, in your bed, after you massacred our entire family?<eos> But I was going to... give you everything I have!
You wanted to be the star of the show-- here's your chance, big shot.<eos> I'm not an escape artist.<eos> I'm a song-and-dance man!<eos> You're a murderer!<eos> You killed our family-- shot 'em dead in the dirt.<eos> Those were good people!<eos> I'm good people, too!<eos> I was just doing what God put me on this earth to do.<eos> You ca... you... you can't punish a man for fulfilling his purpose!<eos> Please... please... my darlings... I forgive you for all of this.
Some by your hand and some not.<eos> A man came through here and started putting our kind in glass jars.<eos> Filled up a museum with our kind.<eos> Saw it with my own eyes!<eos> That's where you think freaks belong-- powerless, behind glass, a human car crash to stare at and remind you how lucky you are.<eos> Well, maybe that's true.<eos> Maybe that's all we are, but let me tell you this, pretty boy.<eos> You may look like a motion picture dreamboat, but you are the biggest freak of them all.<eos> Please!<eos> I'll give you money.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> You mean you don't recognize me?<eos> Klaus: It's been a long time, Finn.<eos> Hayley and I will return home.<eos> Elijah will remain here with you.<eos> He's been experiencing some side effects since his ordeal as our mother's captive.<eos> You ready to do this thing, get hitched?<eos> It's a mystical unification ceremony.<eos> Hayley: You wolves are here because you want freedom.<eos> My vamps and I are willing to stand with you against the witches.
This is a lie of my creation, and my brother doesn't forgive.<eos> He doesn't forget.<eos> Therefore, I think it's best that I forget for both of our sakes.<eos> Elijah?<eos> Elijah?<eos> What the hell is wrong with Marcel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't even think straight, I'm so freaking hungry.<eos> We're all hungry.<eos> You come anywhere near me, and I will give you a headache that will last a century.
We don't all get to get out of this alive, son.<eos> Point made, but nobody loves a joke more than old fox boy here, but if you could just get me back to my body...<eos> Elijah: I must confess, I rather enjoy watching you twist in the wind, not unlike the way you left Rebekah,<eos> I imagine.<eos> Yes.<eos> What did you do to Rebekah?<eos> For goodness' sake, she crossed me. So I crossed her back.<eos> Look.<eos> How narrow-minded of me.<eos> Rebekah, you don't know where she is, and the only thing standing between you and our sister is this selfish fool.
Joe?<eos> Joe.<eos> You never did get those gas masks. I'm sorry.<eos> I failed you, brother.<eos> Not if you make us into vampires like you.<eos> Let's make this fight more even.<eos> Turn us.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I am sorry I let you down, ok, all of you, but the way that you are feeling right now...
You never did get those gas masks. I'm sorry.<eos> I failed you, brother.<eos> Not if you make us into vampires like you.<eos> Let's make this fight more even.<eos> Turn us.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I am sorry I let you down, ok, all of you, but the way that you are feeling right now...<eos> This despair, this hunger...<eos> I have been through it, and if you let me help you survive it, I guarantee you, it will only make you stronger.
That's our rule.<eos> That is how we survived 300 years in this city, and that is why we get to call it home, because we live by a code.<eos> The same one that won't let you tell your own people that you're dying of a werewolf bite?<eos> I'm not dying of anything.<eos> I've got a vial of Klaus' blood in my place right across the river along with enough blood to satisfy all of you.<eos> All we have to do is get there.<eos> You once asked me what I was fighting for.<eos> I told you I was fighting for this city, for our home, but if we feed out there, we lose it.<eos> The barrier will be down any moment now.<eos> Let me help you get home.
I'll see if I can track them down.<eos> Gia: Welcome back, soldier.<eos> Fed you some of Klaus' blood.<eos> You weren't exactly lucid.<eos> They're all getting into the rest of your blood bags downstairs.<eos> But not you.<eos> I'm sorry for being a pain in the ass.<eos> Only the weak don't challenge authority, Gia.<eos> You did good.<eos> I applaud you all for your strength of character.
You said...<eos> I thought she was...<eos> The only way to truly protect her was to convince the world of her death.<eos> I hope you understand once it's safe for you to leave here, our secret cannot leave with you.<eos> She's perfect.<eos> Now that we've entombed our mother, I intend to finish making the city safe for hope, which to start means dealing with the lingering problem of Finn.<eos> Once he figures out what you've done to your mother, he's gonna go off the deep end.<eos> That's exactly why we need to keep you out of harm's way.<eos> Hayley and I will return home and take care of my wayward brother.<eos> Elijah will remain here with you.
He does look peaky.<eos> - You feeling all right?<eos> - Don't make me ask again.<eos> Well, I assume you're referring to our mother.<eos> Fear not.<eos> She's tucked away somewhere perfectly safe.<eos> You'll never find her.<eos> You think you've won.<eos> Let's see how long that arrogance lasts, brother.<eos> You wolves are here because you want freedom, and I promise you if you stay you will be free, but we need as much help as we can get.

My vamps and I are willing to stand with you against the witches.<eos> In return, all I want is a promise, that there will be peace between our sides after the wedding.<eos> You're the one who spent the last 100 years killing and cursing us.<eos> Which means you might want to listen to what I have to say.<eos> I see you're brokering a truce...<eos> Between mongrels and parasites.<eos> Now just how long do you really think that's gonna last?<eos> A month, a week, a day?<eos> What you don't yet seem to understand is that the only thing that can exist between your two degenerate species is hatred, war, and death.<eos> But I imagine given a little time confined together that you'll come to see things the way I do.
Sorry. You're right.<eos> What's the second?<eos> I want you to help watch our guys, all right, make sure nobody starts looking for trouble.<eos> So you got any brilliant ideas on how to keep this under control?<eos> What people in new Orleans have always done when trapped in close quarters with mortal enemies...<eos> Drink and hopefully blow off a little steam.<eos> Rebekah, it's me again.<eos> Please call.<eos> Yahtzee! Ha ha!<eos> If there's one thing I've learned about you people it's that there's always a bottle of booze around.
I just thought you had left.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> My sister's missing, my family's in jeopardy.<eos> I am, uh, utterly powerless to help them.<eos> This is not a state of affairs I'm accustomed to.<eos> Perhaps I'm not weathering this ordeal as well as one would hope.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> If you ever want to talk about it, it's kind of what I do.<eos> We were a family once.<eos> I remember the love between you, how happy you were that I was your son.
When placed beside the behemoth size of yours, certainly.<eos> Could we dispense with this fascinating dispute for just a moment and return to the subject of our supposed long-lost sister?<eos> There's not much to discuss, Elijah.<eos> Said she was Freya and then darted off into the night.<eos> And you believed her.<eos> Well, I met the girl in a mystical loony bin.<eos> She could be anyone telling any lie, but she did seem familiar somehow.<eos> Then how is she still alive, a question as ridiculous as its possible solutions, given this family's annoying predilection for cheating death?<eos> I don't know, Nik.<eos> I'm just telling you what she said.
Wolves are bonded by what is most important to us... The earth of our territory, the blood of our packs.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Too many ears...<eos> But I need some of your blood.<eos> It's... it's a stall.<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> Your timing is perfect.<eos> Mixing these elements, we irrevocably bind ourselves to one another, creating a new Crescent pack.<eos> I ask each one of you, do you renounce your alpha status?
Tonight's the night.<eos> Once everyone's asleep, I'll grab you.<eos> Where did you get this, huh?<eos> Don't.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> Do you know what I do to thieves?<eos> That hurt.<eos> You little bitch.<eos> No.<eos> you take from us and we take twice as much from you.
The Panticapaeum Institute?<eos> Yeah, that's it.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Our city manager, Ben Caspere, was going to be here to explain this, but I suppose I can approximate the information.<eos> So everybody knows Proposition 1 has passed.<eos> And next year construction will start on a $68 billion high-speed rail up Central California.<eos> An undeveloped valley adjacent to the rail and the coastal highway has been purchased by several holding companies anticipating a commercial development that will be in line for hundreds of millions in federal grants.<eos> And the feds have guaranteed cost overages.<eos> I was told something a long time ago.<eos> Let me share it with you.
- Great, take your time.<eos> Yeah, let's keep moving, huh?<eos> Right this way.<eos> When are you two gonna learn how to shut up?<eos> You're like Lucy and Ethel without the charm.<eos> - We was just trying to help.<eos> - You wanna help?<eos> Start by shutting up and doing what I ask you to do.<eos> Stop gabbing while you're serving.<eos> Stop thinking that anyone needs you to do more than your job.
- Thank you.<eos> - All right, Joe, thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> Watch yourself on Route 16, huh? Uh, speed trap.<eos> So?<eos> I'd polish up that resume if I were you, Ford.<eos> Can I have one of those?<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> What the hell is wrong with all of you?
I know that last turn at the end, that left, it's confusing.<eos> Yeah, I made it just fine.<eos> Um, look, I'll keep it short.<eos> MCC is gonna be taking over Litchfield, effective as soon as the paperwork goes through.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought everything that could have gone wrong on that tour, did.<eos> Yeah, well, it was a real shit show.<eos> But we toured the maximum security facility before we came to visit you guys, and with the number of bodies down there, and the potential for the unused space, it was a no-brainer.
Ay, Dios.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> We're family, right?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - "Of course."<eos> Of course.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen when you get out.<eos> You'll call each other up... maybe meet for drinks, make more plans but then cancel them, push them off, you're suddenly really busy.<eos> But the truth is... you're avoiding each other because it only took that one drink for you to realize you don't have anything in common... and all you got was a reminder of the time you spent in this fucking hellhole.
- Drew?<eos> Fucking people, man.<eos> You know, I didn't force them to get in the cab, and now they're acting like it's my fault, like I should feel so bad they're gonna have to spend a couple nights in jail.<eos> Some people like to blame everyone else for their problems.<eos> Like my brother.<eos> Pins everything on our dad.<eos> I'm like, "Get off it."<eos> He molested me, too.<eos> I turned out fine.<eos> Tell you what, those two could use a couple of nights in jail, you know?
We don't like the kitchen.<eos> We like Norma.<eos> Get off my floor!<eos> Look, Norma doesn't even know what she's doing.<eos> No offense.<eos> That's not true.<eos> She has powers.<eos> Powerful powers.<eos> I prayed to Norma for deliverance, and deliverance felleth from the sky.<eos> I'm telling you, what Elvis did for music and Eminem did for rap, Norma is gonna do for jungle magic.
Yes, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You can take your sandwich.<eos> You want us to come?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, Luschek.<eos> Aren't you worried about leaving computers with inmates?<eos> Well, maybe if any of you were technically savvy, or Asian, but, uh, we screen for that.
Arturo's friends.<eos> Willy said he saw green alien guys when he was tripping on your shit.<eos> - They were leprechauns.<eos> - Dude, aliens sounds so much cooler.<eos> But they had little hats.<eos> Aliens can't have little hats because of their antennas or whatever.<eos> Do you think you could hook us up again?<eos> My boy Jason here wants to try it.<eos> Lately, he's been kind of down.<eos> Yeah, I could hook you up.
I bet they're running low.<eos> I just refilled them.<eos> Well, stay on them.<eos> That no carb trend is back.<eos> I'm up to my ears in buns.<eos> Oh. Look who decided to grace us with her presence.<eos> Throw an apron on, we'll talk punishment later.<eos> I got the job.<eos> It's supposed to start in a few minutes.<eos> I just wanted to come let you know.
- Says who? - Says me.<eos> Well, you're not in charge.<eos> Is this why you bought those penny-loafers?<eos> Where the fuck is this guy?<eos> - Fu. - Hmm.<eos> Does this stuff really work?<eos> Which stuff?<eos> The stuff.<eos> For men.<eos> I've been with you guys for months now and it's like half the business:
Well, this self that you speak of, it's not a fixed object.<eos> That's a story that we're telling, right?<eos> - If you want to change the self, you got to change the story.<eos> Because the desire to transform, the thing that brought you here today, means you've already begun to change.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm not here to save you, children.<eos> I'm just a bearded guy in white pants.<eos> They call me Guru Mack because I'm a teacher.<eos> And I can teach you how to change your story.
What are you babbling about?<eos> Norma's a healer.<eos> She has powers.<eos> You believe this?<eos> She's performing miracles, Red.<eos> Everyone's talking about it.<eos> We booked some time in the chapel, and we were hoping to meet tomorrow.<eos> Chapel?<eos> What is she... your priest?<eos> The poor woman doesn't speak, so she can't tell you to fuck off, but I can.
Tell me this is a joke.<eos> No.<eos> It was a memo from Jeffrey in Food Services and Linda in Purchasing.<eos> You didn't think I'd put you in charge if you actually had any power, did you?<eos> She's not gonna come.<eos> Maybe we should take turns leading a prayer circle.<eos> Or we could just keep meeting with her one-on-one.<eos> But I thought the whole point of this was to organize.<eos> I told you!<eos> What did I tell you?
Well, my sisters... fear not... for I possess the keys to the gastrointestinal kingdom.<eos> Ramen flavor packets?<eos> You're the one who bought out the commissary.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But I'm willing to share... if you accept my proposal.<eos> Nay... my invitation... to join me on a... miraculous adventure.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - I need your panties.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I will give you the panties, but I need you to wear them.
- What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - I need your panties.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I will give you the panties, but I need you to wear them.<eos> I need your vag sweat.<eos> And maybe some, um, colorless discharge.<eos> I'm starting a business selling stinky panties to perverts.<eos> That's the miraculous adventure?<eos> It's easy.<eos> I give you flavor packets, and you give me something you're, uh... you're already giving away for free.
It's not like I'm asking you to sleep in my bed... or bring me back leftovers of Lasagna Classico... which you pay for with my money, which you know I enjoy, which you never finish!<eos> "I don't want to be a fat person."<eos> You know what? I had a really good day today.<eos> I had a really good day today.<eos> And I just wanted to come home and share it with you... and you don't care.<eos> At all!<eos> What do you really want from me?<eos> My freedom.<eos> I think you and your mother ought to go get an apartment.<eos> -I'll help you pay for it.
Everyone has the right to unionize.<eos> Shit. Motherfucking shit.<eos> But I have access to budgets now.<eos> And all that noise about the whole shebang coming crashing down if MCC starts covering benefits, it is 100% true.<eos> They must have given you a pretty good pay raise.<eos> Yeah, like 30 pieces of silver.<eos> I have done nothing... but save your asses since this prison was scheduled to close.<eos> You're goddamn right.<eos> It was a pretty good pay raise.<eos> And any one of you ungrateful, selfish sons of bitches would have thrown me under the bus and run me over to get the same.
It was a pretty good pay raise.<eos> And any one of you ungrateful, selfish sons of bitches would have thrown me under the bus and run me over to get the same.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> It's the year of Caputo.<eos> You know, we had a union captain once who told us that the corporation would call an optional meeting and then try to scare us out of unionizing.<eos> I remember that.<eos> He said, "When they did that, we should say," and I am paraphrasing...<eos> "Fuck you!"<eos> That's right, because he said,<eos> "The company needs you more than you need them."
We need a leader.<eos> We need you, man.<eos> We do.<eos> We need you.<eos> Well, for starters, stop meeting in the break room.<eos> Don't give them a reason to squash you.<eos> These guys are pros.<eos> They will call a meeting.<eos> It will seem optional, but it won't be.<eos> And once they have you captive, they are going to feed you a bunch of BS about it being a friendly workplace.

Yo, Sophia ain't a drag queen, yo.<eos> She ain't walking around in a costume.<eos> I feel bad about it.<eos> - This is why I do my own hair.<eos> - Wait, that's hair?<eos> This whole time I thought you was wearin' Mickey Mouse ears!<eos> You...<eos> Oh, tell me what's happening here.<eos> Mmm, at the moment, we enjoying some corn. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Corn that doesn't belong to you.
I don't have a lot left over for your hurt feelings.<eos> I was minding my own business.<eos> I'm here... because I realized you might be my only friend.<eos> I'm sorry, Sophia.<eos> Everybody acts cool most of the time, you know?<eos> "Oh, Sophia, hit me with the gossip."<eos> "What do you think about bangs, Sophia?"<eos> You start to feel like one of the girls.<eos> But then something turns... and you realize... you're still a freak and you'll never be one of them.<eos> Jesus said, "But I say to you, love your enemies and... Pray for those who persecute you."
I am the keeper of the packets, you drongo.<eos> - What did you call me? - Hey.<eos> Hey,hey-<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> This is Stella. She's cool.<eos> Yo, I don't like surprises.<eos> Yeah, my accent can be very alarming.<eos> This is a win-win.<eos> You get to make your meals partially edible and wear panties that make your butts happy.<eos> There's a thong and six packets of ramen flavor in there for each of you.
You feel all sexy for who?<eos> O'Neill?<eos> I feel like I got a secret, you know?<eos> Like we're a part of this secret club that no one knows about.<eos> I feel cool.<eos> Oh, my God, you just said that, and my nipples got, like, super-hard.<eos> Bye.<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> Show me your tits, and I'll tell you.<eos> I'm one of you.
Can't turn around without seeing Litchfield's newest butt buddies.<eos> We were talking about Stella's family.<eos> Do tell.<eos> - Alex!<eos> - Come on.<eos> I'm just trying to hang out with our new friend, Justin Bieber.<eos> Would you like to go speak privately?<eos> - I can leave.<eos> I'm sorry for interrupting.<eos> I'll give you guys some privacy so you can get to know each other even better and fuck.
- Previously...<eos> - They say I'm a witch.<eos> Are you?<eos> I think I can save his life.<eos> I smell the vapors of hell on you.
It was old-fashioned poison.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> I started with white arsenic a few months ago.<eos> Thought it would kill Arthur off before the child began to show.<eos> And then you'd be free to marry Dougal.<eos> It's a boy, ye ken?<eos> He's kicking.<eos> Food for the witches.<eos> Wait!<eos> I need to talk to you!
Stating in evidence that the accused, one Geillis Duncan and one Claire Fraser, both standing before the church's court for the crime of witchcraft... did inflict pain, suffering, and death upon the citizens of Cranesmuir<eos> There were no familiar faces in the crowd, none of my friends from Castle Leoch.<eos> My knowledge of witch trials told me that the accused rarely walked free.<eos> Make way.<eos> Make way.<eos> Please, I demand to be let into the proceedings.<eos> And you are, sir?<eos> My name is Edward Gowan, Your Honor, lawyer, former writer to the signet, Edinburgh.<eos> Let him pass.<eos> And what brings you here, sir?
I fell to my knees and prayed for God to curse her malevolence and wreak his mighty vengeance upon her body and soul.<eos> And God answered my prayers.<eos> He said to me...<eos> "you have made a prodigious mistake."<eos> When young Tammas Baxter was seized by Beelzebub, I administered the last rites.<eos> I abandoned hope.<eos> Blinded by vanity, hubris, I rebuked Claire Fraser.<eos> But it was she who determined the boy was ill from ingesting poisoned flora, and Claire Fraser did what I could not... saved the boy's life.<eos> Blessed congregation, hear my confession.<eos> I failed Tammas Baxter, I failed you... and I failed God.

I beseech you... let me go.<eos> Bear witness to her fiendish ploy.<eos> It would take Satan himself to drive a man of God away.<eos> - She's a witch!<eos> - Burn her!<eos> - Witch!<eos> - Burn her!<eos> I have done nothing!<eos> Mrs. Fraser!<eos> Father... this court forbids you to leave this parish.
Father... this court forbids you to leave this parish.<eos> After heedful consideration...<eos> Your Honors, a momentary recess.<eos> Briefly, Mr. Gowan.<eos> Briefly.<eos> Allow these ladies some privacy, please.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm afraid the climate has turned, and there is no coming back from it.<eos> Well, what do we do?<eos> We save one of you.
Allow these ladies some privacy, please.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm afraid the climate has turned, and there is no coming back from it.<eos> Well, what do we do?<eos> We save one of you.<eos> Neither one of us is a witch.<eos> It doesn't matter what you are. It's what people think you are.<eos> And people thought you were a witch long before this English lass came into our midst.<eos> And let's be frank... you've practiced your murky trade for years.<eos> The only thing that ever stood between you and a pile of kindling was your husband, and he's dead.
And let's be frank... you've practiced your murky trade for years.<eos> The only thing that ever stood between you and a pile of kindling was your husband, and he's dead.<eos> Are you my lawyer or my judge, Mr. Gowan?<eos> I've tried, Mrs. Duncan, but you're beyond saving, and you ken it.<eos> So what is it you're saying, Ned?<eos> I'm saying that if you claimed that Geillis Duncan bewitched you and renounce her...<eos> - "Renounce her"?<eos> - Mm-hmm. State that she tricked you and drew you into her evil web.<eos> What if I don't?<eos> They'll burn you both.

Strip her and skelp her!<eos> No!<eos> Get off me, you bastard!<eos> Get your bloody hands off me, you bloody bastard!<eos> I shall dance upon your ashes.<eos> Claire!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Sir, you have no place in the working of this court.<eos> I swore an oath before the altar of God to protect this woman!<eos> And if you're telling me you consider your authority to be greater than that of the Almighty, then I must inform you that I am not of that opinion myself.
That's great.<eos> - Connor...<eos> Look, you wanted to talk.<eos> Let's talk about how you lied to Michaela and me, how you sold us out to Annalise.<eos> - You want to talk about that?<eos> - Don't drag me into this.<eos> No, we're on the same team, Michaela.<eos> But these two... I mean, w-w-what did Annalise call them, the... the... the quiet ones, the dangerous ones?<eos> I mean, for all we know, they're still playing us.<eos> Playing you?

I'd only just told him that I was gonna tell the world the truth about him.<eos> Wouldn't you run?<eos> You listen to me closely and do exactly as I tell you.<eos> Remove the body.<eos> He cannot stay here.<eos> Heads, we go back for the body.<eos> Your DNA is under his nails, on his skin, so the only way to get rid of it is to burn the body.<eos> We go back for the body and then what?<eos> We do what with it?<eos> - Have any of you thought about that?

Wes' for the study group.<eos> We have exams this week.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Is Professor Keating around?<eos> From there, we all headed over to the bonfire.<eos> You all drove together, in Mr. Walsh's S.U.V.?<eos> That's right.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> A witness told us that he saw Mr. Walsh's car parked outside the Keating house that night.<eos> Is Michaela in there with you?
Why don't you try working too?<eos> - I'll brush my teeth.<eos> -Very good, honey.<eos> But hurry up!<eos> You could walk Auguste to school.<eos> - Watch outwith that!<eos> - It's cool. He'd love it.<eos> We'll see each other tonight.<eos> Goodbye, kids.<eos> Love you!
- Hello, Sol.<eos> These mussels are delicious.<eos> And the crab. So fresh.<eos> And they give you three sauces!<eos> Look at this oyster!<eos> Do you think they realize they live in their own spoon?<eos> We've only had this seafood platter 700 times.<eos> - Sol's a little anxious tonight.<eos> - Something happen at the office?<eos> Actually, we do want to talk to you two about something.
I mean, if I found out you were being indicted, I would've said sure.<eos> But this?<eos> Oh, my God. What am I gonna tell my kids?<eos> Why don't you start with, "Do you know where poop comes from?"<eos> How am I in trouble right now?<eos> Sorry, Dad.<eos> Look, I'm sorry you had to find out this way and I know it's a shock,<eos> - but... honestly, it was killing me.<eos> This is why I didn't want to talk about it yet.<eos> I didn't want to fall apart in front of you.
- Where is he?<eos> - Welcome.<eos> There he is.<eos> See those two birds?<eos> Behind Jesus?<eos> I don't see Jesus. But that's the general direction.<eos> They look like they really love each other, don't they?<eos> - Do birds mate for life?<eos> - No one does.<eos> Whichever one of you is the lady bird, don't trust him!
How did you get the almond to actually stick to the chicken?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Egg whites!<eos> Hmm. There are eggs in this?<eos> You have a problem with the eggs but not the chicken?<eos> - That's classic.<eos> - Just egg whites, no yolk.<eos> And then you just grind up the almonds with a little paprika.<eos> He's like a magician in the kitchen.<eos> - Do you think it's dry?
I'm sorry, is there some kind of manual that we didn't get that tells us how to act in this situation?<eos> Because you two seem to be the only ones who know the rules.<eos> We just think you should have been honest.<eos> I'm sorry, are you trying to be ironic?<eos> No. I'm trying to be your father!<eos> You don't have to point out to me that I hurt your mother!<eos> I know she's been hurt.<eos> Lying only makes it worse.<eos> - They've been through enough.<eos> - Because of you!
I wish I could stay longer.<eos> - Don't apologise today. Come on. - Yeah.<eos> Just relax and have fun, Mom.<eos> Let the wheels stop turning.<eos> Well, I do really only have an hour.<eos> Good, 58 more minutes.<eos> Who's tending bar?<eos> I'll shake and stir.<eos> Gotta be 5 p.m. somewhere.<eos> I really did miss being with you guys.
Dad, they're scared.<eos> - Yeah, I don't blame them a bit.<eos> - Hey, you gonna be around later?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sure. - I have a surprise for you.<eos> That man there...<eos> That's my dad.<eos> He taught me how to swim.<eos> He taught me good.<eos> Now I'm gonna teach you guys.
That's my dad.<eos> He taught me how to swim.<eos> He taught me good.<eos> Now I'm gonna teach you guys.<eos> And one day, I'm sure, you guys are gonna teach someone else.<eos> I think my mom's pregnant.<eos> There you go! All right. There you go.<eos> Come on, let's pick a pair.<eos> Let's pick a pair.<eos> Take a look. See what you like. That's good.
Fourteen.<eos> Well, you know, he...<eos> Dad expected the best from us. Because he wanted the best for us.<eos> Everything that--<eos> Everything that I have, everything that we all have is because of him.<eos> He made me who I am.<eos> And now my brother Danny, he'd like to say a few--<eos> Well, I know how he feels.<eos> I know how we all feel.<eos> And we'd like to thank all of you, everyone... for coming out and paying your respects... to our father.
-Yeah.<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Aren't you going to watch the show with us?<eos> -No, I'm going out for a while.<eos> Don't come home too late.<eos> -No, no.<eos> Thanks for dinner, Grandma.<eos> -Yes.<eos> How's it going between the two of you, dear?
Have you got a ride?<eos> -Yes, with Robbi.<eos> Do you think there is room for me?<eos> I don't think so...<eos> The car is full.<eos> Yes, I have to go.<eos> Try one of the others.<eos> OK.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> No chance I can ride with you?
What color would you like to be?<eos> Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Any color's fine with me.<eos> Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.<eos> Blue and yellow make green.<eos> Well, then it's settled.<eos> Ready to go?<eos> Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.<eos> Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.
Night-night.<eos> Good morning... sir.<eos> I see we're getting an early start this morning.<eos> Oh, what do you want, Sid? Sir... when you hired me to be your squire, it was the most exciting thing to ever happen to me.<eos> - Mm. - Best squireship in the land.<eos> My parents completely plotzed.<eos> But ever since Madalena...<eos> - Don't say her name.<eos> - Right.<eos> There's someone here to see you.
My people were taken captive.<eos> My entire family either killed or imprisoned.<eos> Oh, that's terrible.<eos> That's just terrible.<eos> Still, you've got a nice way about you.<eos> I'm sure you'll land on your feet. Nice meeting you.<eos> Door's on the wall.<eos> Before being captured, my father hid me in the cellar and handed me the priceless Jewel of Valencia.<eos> I hid in that cellar for months as my family was slaughtered above me.<eos> I now offer you this priceless jewel, all that my country has left to offer.
I'm embarrassing yourself.<eos> Can I buy you a drink? No!<eos> Good.<eos> You can buy me one.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> Two months ago, you were imprisoned in a cellar.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> Ah, here we are.<eos> Regular spots, please.<eos> Thank you very much.
Good.<eos> You can buy me one.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> Two months ago, you were imprisoned in a cellar.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> Ah, here we are.<eos> Regular spots, please.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I believe you know where to stand.<eos> Now, let me ask you one question.
A bit of tea, please.<eos> Tea for the king!<eos> I'm not really a yeller.<eos> I've been fighting a bug since the invasion.<eos> I swear, it's the plague.<eos> It's not the plague.<eos> - Feel it, though... does that feel lumpy?<eos> - No.<eos> - You didn't even feel it.<eos> - We beg you to show mercy to our people,
Well, it's delightful.<eos> Just delightful.<eos> Kill the king, make her watch.<eos> No!<eos> Sid, fetch me a drink.<eos> When he tells me to fetch, those are my favorite moments.<eos> Thanks again for the drink. Drinks.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> My father used to tell stories of you, - of your skill in battle... - Mm-hmm.

Will we be foreigners now?<eos> I can't imagine it.<eos> Will the Debrecen post office stop delivering here?<eos> How could it, once we're in a different country!<eos> But the letters will get through, won't they?<eos> Of course, Grandma, but I won't be able to work abroad.<eos> But there'll be a post office here too.<eos> There has to be a post office!<eos> Of course, if I swear allegiance to the king of Romania.<eos> So what will you do?
You can't be smart enough here.<eos> In the worst case, we'll start our own office and give Aladár a job.<eos> - What as? - Who cares.<eos> This nonsense can't last forever.<eos> It won't be like that, my boys.<eos> At worst you'll take over my office.<eos> Provided, that's the worst.<eos> Horthy, Horthy, Horthyl<eos> This is Lajos.<eos> I've brought him to meet you.
They know nothing about us.<eos> What we do, how we live here.<eos> Everything will be like the old days.<eos> We'll stay who we've always been.<eos> She is alone here a lot.<eos> It's made her bitter.<eos> Now they've billeted some Hungarian officers here, and they said we were collaborators.<eos> That we gave in to the Romanians. I don't understand that either.<eos> What were we supposed to do?<eos> How are you, Margit?
I was shitting myself.<eos> I was the only one on the tram.<eos> What a lovely tree!<eos> You can't sit still...<eos> - Hello, Bertha.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hello, Teri, how are things there?<eos> Merry Christmas, Dugó!<eos> Are you alright?
We'll go to Old Gardó's in Gyüre.<eos> What'll we do there, in the back of beyond?<eos> We'll manage.<eos> And at least nobody knows us there.<eos> Right?<eos> It's still warm.<eos> Lajos, I didn't really mean it...<eos> That's okay, Mari. Better safe than sorry.<eos> - Well, God bless you.<eos> - And you.
First day of the month!<eos> Pay up!<eos> Make your payments!<eos> Pay up!<eos> Pay your respects to Sir Horsa.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Here's your blood money.<eos> And much good may it do you.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Here's your blood money.<eos> And much good may it do you.<eos> -Watch your mouth!<eos> Pay up!<eos> Come on, pay up!<eos> Coins.<eos> What good will a few coins from a poor man do you?
Get inside.<eos> Go.<eos> Who did you think defends the garrison, eh?<eos> You there.<eos> Old man!<eos> Got clay in those ears?<eos> It's time for your tribute.<eos> Trade's dried up.<eos> People are scared, they've moved south.<eos> I haven't sold enough to give you a cut.
My father used to mine soil and rocks, and sometimes, he said...<eos> Ah! His tools!<eos> He said sometimes, the heavens would drop a rock to the Earth, a rock full of riches.<eos> It is north of the wall.<eos> There are painted flesh-eaters everywhere.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I bet there's gold at the end of that rainbow.<eos> I can do it.<eos> I wish you good fortune.<eos> Watching you young boys run around the village made me wonder what a son of ours would have become.
Yes. And they're very valuable.<eos> There's no telling what he might do with them.<eos> But save your strength.<eos> The time to face Brude will come soon enough, now that you're on our side.<eos> I'm on no one's side but my own.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Look.<eos> The druids prophesized that a favorable omen would show in the sky.<eos> And it has.<eos> A dragon has returned to our lands, and I believe it brought you to us.
Wall-crawler?<eos> That's Rhonu.<eos> You want my advice?<eos> Just nod and say, yes.<eos> I told you to keep the southerner bound.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Rhonu, he can help us.<eos> He's a knight, and the dragon saved him...<eos> He's no knight.<eos> I am, and have no quarrel with you.
So valuable.<eos> Brude chose the moon to be his spirit guide.<eos> When it ebbs, at dawn, his powers will be at his weakest.<eos> Sleep now, Mother Moon.<eos> Swell thy belly to bring upon a blacker night.<eos> Come.<eos> We're going hunting.<eos> I can bring forth a fog so thick it will hide your movements,<eos> yet so natural they'll never suspect it's me.<eos> You better be worth a hundred crowns, or I'm frying the lot of you.
No. I can travel faster over ground I've already covered.<eos> Besides, I'm a knight.<eos> I'm chosen.<eos> The dragon trusts me.<eos> All right.<eos> South it is.<eos> But Brude has men taking slaves in the hills.<eos> We'll have to be careful.<eos> We?<eos> Well, I'm coming with you.
That's it.<eos> There's a cave up ahead.<eos> Gareth.<eos> What do you see?<eos> A shadow.<eos> It has shape and feeling.<eos> Yes.<eos> Brude's dark sorcery has opened the shadows to me and through our hearts, to you as well. Come.<eos> I'll show you how it works.<eos> Waiting for me to carry you over the threshold?
Come on.<eos> The code.<eos> When Drago regained his form, could that have been your doing?<eos> Me?<eos> How?<eos> Well, you upheld the code.<eos> You came back.<eos> And to my recollection that was the precise moment Drago appeared.<eos> You share feelings, pain.<eos> Perhaps he can feel the valor in you too.
And you'd still have your head!<eos> My blade shall defend the helpless.<eos> See?<eos> I've taught you something.<eos> And now for your last lesson, squire.<eos> The old codes have been bought and sold.<eos> A knight is only worth his profit!<eos> Aim for their front line.<eos> You, raise your elbow.<eos> Don't they teach you anything here?
The curse is broken!<eos> You saved me!<eos> The village idiot strikes again!<eos> I only see a knight.<eos> Sir Gareth.<eos> Druid's alive!<eos> Get him down!<eos> Gareth?<eos> I guess it worked.<eos> I'd say you've earned that robe.
I'm sorry, but you have to...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You have to go home now.<eos> - Lars, open the gate.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Put your boy down. Put him down.<eos> Wait... wait.<eos> I have three children of my own.<eos> I understand your situation.<eos> But if we're to help you, you have to go home.
Are you sweeping that HLS?<eos> 2-5 here.<eos> I can't give clearance.<eos> Out.<eos> Lasse, look at me.<eos> Are you there?<eos> Look at me. - We'll get you home.<eos> - Lasse, stay with us.<eos> - Lasse!<eos> - Lars, Michael, behind you! - Visual?
Sucking with teeth!<eos> Sucking with teeth!<eos> Sucking with teeth!<eos> Sucking with teeth!<eos> -My darling!<eos> -Not a word, not a word!<eos> -On what grounds?<eos> -Leave her alone!<eos> She let a foreign agent into a firing range that belongs to the army.<eos> What do you mean not with you?
-I'll kill you!<eos> Take it easy, Avihu.<eos> You insulted her on my behalf.<eos> And I only wanted to make her happy.<eos> I did everything alone, it has nothing to do with her.<eos> Take, sweety.<eos> Drink a bit.<eos> Very good hero.<eos> Now give back the CD.<eos> And we'll take you to eat hamburger in a gas station.
Both of us are good cops.<eos> Do you want to get to know the bad cop?<eos> Bring in Meluban.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm Noah Meluban. The General Security Services inventor.<eos> Look, I bought this pruner in a gardening store.<eos> I added here at the edge two nails.<eos> I learned in Cambridge that the penis has such an elastic tissue that it heals in no time.<eos> And then it can't be proven.<eos> Shall we talk about you guys a bit?
Hope you enjoyed your stay in the Holy Land, you traitor.<eos> Say hello to Iran.<eos> You see, it's only a school.<eos> Not Uranium.<eos> Just a school.<eos> Mr. Mohsin, if this is a school, then please show us the children<eos> Good morning, girls.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I want to remind you today that we will have visitors from the Atomic Energy Organization.<eos> You are not allowed to ask them any questions and you should not even answer their questions.
And, if left alone, will also eat his own shit.<eos> OK, boys and girls, settle down.<eos> All right everybody, come on!<eos> Come on! Come on guys, let's move it!<eos> We have a visitor from our friends in Washington, so eyes and ears.<eos> Agent Stiles.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I know a lot of you guys have seen me lurking about, and it's not because I'm a butterscotch-bacon donut addict.<eos> Thanks very much, guys.<eos> The truth is, I head up a federal task force for Homeland Security, which basically means I'm here to help you guys catch the bad guys.
What do you mean?<eos> I've been getting calls and e-mails, and my friend Michael was threatened.<eos> - Threatened?<eos> - What do you mean, threatened?<eos> Emma! Why didn't you tell us this?<eos> Because I thought that...<eos> I don't know, I thought that I could figure this out on my own.<eos> - Honey.<eos> - I just...<eos> - I didn't want you guys to worry about me.
Sorry about the cats.<eos> - Is this even better than the cat video?<eos> Now times really, that's better, right?<eos> How is it that you have mood for a game? Yes?<eos> - What kind of a game?<eos> You will see.<eos> Will you Loser play a game?<eos> Clear.<eos> - Yes?<eos> But I warn you, that's not for sissies.
Everyone has filmed there.<eos> That was not meant for YouTube.<eos> - No it was not.<eos> But now it's there.<eos> It really disgusting.<eos> - Blatant thing ...<eos> Why did you do that? - Seriously now?<eos> I'll throw you coins in the face, bitch.<eos> Real, how can you be so perverse?<eos> - That makes you good fun ...
Yeah. - Really? Where's he going to school in the fall?<eos> Have you guys taken your tours yet?<eos> - Tours?<eos> - Touring the schools?<eos> Yeah. Go around, look at them.<eos> - Okay. - Well, I get a little bit crazy<eos> - about that stuff. - Yeah, another...<eos> It's all coming up. Just as long as you get your applications in early, you'll be fine.<eos> If you need a letter of recommendation,<eos> I'm sort of the mayor of this area, so I can absolutely help you. - Thank you.
Brother, hearcel loathes you most of all.<eos> Freya will help me here.<eos> I need to know my child is safe.<eos> You and Hayley can assure that.<eos> Mm. Is this for me?<eos> Oh, sweet angel of mercy.<eos> This almost makes up for the whole kidnapping thing.<eos> Oh, let's not forget, that whole kidnapping thing kept you alive.<eos> As for the coffee, it's the least I could do, considering you helped us make our breakthrough.<eos> The last I remember was... you saying you figured it out, and then we started drinking tequila like water.
Vincent, it's me, again.<eos> We were supposed to meet an hour ago.<eos> All right, call me back as soon as you get this.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> I'm calling my guy.<eos> All right, whoever you are, this is the wrong day to be playing games.<eos> Elijah. What are you doing here?<eos> Did you not learn your lesson the last time I put you down?<eos> Does this bravado help to relieve your pathetic fear?<eos> Oh, you think I'm afraid of you?
If Marcel has seen something similar...<eos> Then we're all on the chopping block.<eos> I need to purify you both.<eos> No!<eos> Not yet.<eos> If the Hollow can look into me, then I can look back at it, find out what it is, what it wants.<eos> It's too dangerous, Klaus.<eos> This thing came after Hope.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll give you an hour. And something else.
No!<eos> Not yet.<eos> If the Hollow can look into me, then I can look back at it, find out what it is, what it wants.<eos> It's too dangerous, Klaus.<eos> This thing came after Hope.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll give you an hour. And something else.<eos> The means to kill the unkillable king of New Orleans.<eos> If Marcel comes after you, use this.<eos> You're mad I kept a secret from you?
If Marcel comes after you, use this.<eos> You're mad I kept a secret from you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Chastise me once you've made it through the day.<eos> I do miss it out here.<eos> Yeah, looks like you're not alone.<eos> You know, we could be happy out here.<eos> I think you might stand out in that suit.<eos> Well, I was thinking jeans, shorts and flip flops.<eos> I want to build a life with you, Elijah.
I want to build a life with you, Elijah.<eos> With Hope.<eos> I want us to be happy.<eos> So we do that.<eos> Together.<eos> In jean shorts.<eos> - Grandma Mary!<eos> - Well, hello, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, my girl.<eos> I picked you some flowers.
I want to talk about what really caused that massacre last night.<eos> So young.<eos> And taken before her time.<eos> While those immortal tyrants continue to wander free.<eos> What is this?<eos> Evil spirit appears to me as the guy I hate, for what?<eos> Huh? To scare me?<eos> If this is all in my head, I could just as easily wish your ass away.<eos> Your wishes won't bring back the dead.<eos> Nor will they grant you solace.
And I assume I have the misfortune of addressing the, uh...<eos> What was your name?<eos> The inept?<eos> The vacant?<eos> The Hollow.<eos> You address no one.<eos> I...<eos> I am not here. I'm only in your head.<eos> I can see your worst fear:<eos> the father that you loathed, the terror that this is how your daughter may one day perceive you.
So I know you're safe.<eos> You know your way around, don't you?<eos> New Orleans native, I take it?<eos> I wonder, were you buried somewhere in the vicinity?<eos> Perhaps someone disturbed your tomb.<eos> Is that why you're such an angry ghost?<eos> You don't intend to kill Marcel, do you?<eos> Your father was right.<eos> You are a coward.<eos> Because of you, he's lost everyone he loved.

Nicely done.<eos> Imagine if I made you kill someone you cared about.<eos> Maybe I already have.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Next time, it might even be Hope.<eos> No!<eos> Even if you could resist, who will stop Marcel?<eos> After all, I'm having my fun with him.<eos> And I will make him tear through your family like you have these people.<eos> Now, you only have the one choice, boy.
But there's stuff about my parents in there.<eos> What does he say about them?<eos> Ramblings about how they were traitors for dealing with vampires.<eos> You can see his writing deteriorate as his thoughts.<eos> In the end, he can't even form a coherent sentence.<eos> Elijah, I think the Hollow made Mary's husband kill my parents.<eos> Klaus, I was worried.<eos> Freya, stay back.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't want to hurt you. But I can't trust myself.
You do belong somewhere.<eos> I did terrible things to find my family, Elijah.<eos> And when I did, they were already dead.<eos> And now I find out that the same people who killed them are... the ones who hurt Hope.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I will not let anything happen to you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - What is it? - You need to come back to the city, or Marcel's going to kill Klaus.<eos> Of course. You say our feud is over, but you're off building a weapon that can kill me.<eos> Well, I wouldn't need it if I knew you could be trusted!
Kill your son, Klaus.<eos> Otherwise, I will find a way to control him, and Hope will never be safe.<eos> Mercy... is for the weak!<eos> Leave my family alone!<eos> I prefer my mind remain unaltered for the time being.<eos> Weird.<eos> I feel the exact opposite.<eos> Rest easy, brother.<eos> My spells have Marcel bound and cloaked.<eos> Even more, I can find no trace of the Hollow's magic in either of you.
What if the Hollow is behind those deaths, too?<eos> And if it went after the Labonairs before... what if it wan w to finish what it started.<eos> Ooh. The mighty Freya Mikaelson felled by antiseptic.<eos> Keelin... thank you.<eos> ♪ ♪ Is that gratitude?<eos> From the Viking witch who spends her days channeling evil spirits to save vampire brothers?<eos> Yeah, you got a concussion.<eos> Sometimes...<eos> I'm forced to do things that I... regret.<eos> And... for what I did to you...
Redemption?<eos> He's never gonna change.<eos> Not even for his own daughter.<eos> Oh, he already has.<eos> She has changed him.<eos> You, Marcellus, you are not needed, welcome or wanted.<eos> You have only been spared purely because you are my brother's greatest weakness.<eos> And I cannot show any mercy to anyone who would demonstrate threat towards this family.<eos> And if indeed you should prevent the redemption of the cruel, the wicked, the vindictive Niklaus Mikaelson...<eos> I promise you... I will deliver another kind of nightmare.
I'm quite familiar with the Harvest ritual.<eos> Now let us begin.<eos> Don't talk about what you don't understand, Elijah.<eos> Most people I know aren't too keen to give their daughters over to a sacrifice, especially when it went so poorly last time.<eos> Harvest ritual takes preparation.<eos> So, we tell them the truth.<eos> We have no choice.<eos> Demand the sacrifice.<eos> I'm not demanding anything of anybody, Elijah!<eos> Look, I'm working with you because I want to defeat the Hollow.
Well... while you're here, you may as well help me go through this stuff.<eos> You might find something useful.<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> How to Defeat the Hollow: Volume One.<eos> Hidden in here amongst these old Guns N' Roses records.<eos> Oh, sweet child of mine.<eos> Whoa. I need a vampire to do a spell.<eos> You... just volunteered.<eos> Right... so, let's see, you threw my best friend into a supernatural hell world, but, sure.<eos> Let me bend over backwards and do you a favor.
Hi.<eos> I think this is yours.<eos> Hope.<eos> I haven't seen this in a century.<eos> So, you're the little boy who used to live in my house.<eos> Once upon a time, I lived here with your dad.<eos> He keeps you down here because he thinks you want to kill him.<eos> Do you?<eos> Listen,<eos> I will tell you anything you want to know. Okay? If you get me some blood from your dad's stash.
Do you?<eos> Listen,<eos> I will tell you anything you want to know. Okay? If you get me some blood from your dad's stash.<eos> I'm seven, not stupid.<eos> Right.<eos> You know, you're also pretty courageous.<eos> Come down here and talk to a stranger.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> I'm a Mikaelson witch.<eos> I'll tell you what, let's start fresh, all right?
- The girls got to be selected!<eos> - You find a way.<eos> And then the girls will be resurrected.<eos> Any delay only helps our enemy.<eos> You know, I'm surprised your parents haven't stormed down here looking for you.<eos> My mom trusts me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But your dad's never trusted anyone in his life.<eos> If he took care of you when you were little, why do you hate him?<eos> What did he do to you?
The Apisi... they were the guardians who protected the bones in ancient times.<eos> It means nothing now.<eos> I don't have the information you want.<eos> - Well, then, we're done here.<eos> - Wait!<eos> I do know one thing.<eos> I know where that Malraux wolf is right now.<eos> Keelin.<eos> Hey, I'm just leaving the Ninth now.<eos> I'll order you a hurricane.
- Well, then, we're done here.<eos> - Wait!<eos> I do know one thing.<eos> I know where that Malraux wolf is right now.<eos> Keelin.<eos> Hey, I'm just leaving the Ninth now.<eos> I'll order you a hurricane.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You don't know anything about her.<eos> I know she's important to you.
They're in the Ninth Ward now.<eos> In St. Theodora's Health Clinic.<eos> Honestly, she might be dead already.<eos> But if you kill me, then you'll never find out where her body is.<eos> I beseech you... accept this offering as a sign of our faith.<eos> What is this?<eos> What... what is this?<eos> They're angry!<eos> They won't accept the sacrifice. I told you this was not my magic...<eos> They hate you, and they hate me for helping you!
'Cause you just put four little girls' lives at risk.<eos> I'm trying, Vincent.<eos> Now, whatever happened tonight, we prevented the city from being destroyed.<eos> What happens if what we did didn't work tonight?<eos> It did.<eos> But now we have an ally against the Hollow.<eos> Yeah, Elijah.<eos> You are an infection on my city.<eos> You have absolutely no virtue and you have no value, here or wherever it is that you decide to drag yourself next.<eos> I feel so sorry for that little girl, that she's got to be raised in a household with a punk like you.
- I got distracted today.<eos> I was worried about you and I made a mistake that could have cost lives.<eos> And that can't happen again.<eos> There's no reason for us to see each other anymore, Keelin.<eos> Stay in New Orleans.<eos> My brothers will keep an eye on you.<eos> - To keep me alive? - Yeah.<eos> If that's what you want, fine.<eos> But you should know that when I saw you lying there today, I was terrified.<eos> And all I could think about was how I wish I had told you the truth.
Fine, I get that.<eos> But given that the Hollow is, like, pure evil incarnate, maybe you should consider reaching out to people who are just a little more powerful than me. Like...<eos> Like Mikaelson people.<eos> I work better alone.<eos> Really?<eos> Then what am I doing here?<eos> You're the only one I trust, all right?<eos> Just look after her.<eos> Meanwhile, I'm gonna track down the Hollow.<eos> I never told you... but over countless years, you have meant so much to me.
The Hollow has risen.<eos> Nothing can stop her.<eos> Not you, not even the Ancestors, despite what they might claim.<eos> The Ancestors?<eos> I thought he'd never shut up.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Are the Ancestors back?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I could have seen her.<eos> Do you think I would deny you that happiness?
Look, I don't need to inform anyone of my tactics, especially you.<eos> Well, if they're this ill-conceived, perhaps you could do with my help.<eos> Well, I love it when you two bicker. We did come here for a reason.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> The Hollow's weapon.<eos> The magically crafted source of all our current misery.<eos> Magic...<eos> I need that.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - Have you lost your mind, or has the Hollow stolen it from you again?
- Have you lost your mind, or has the Hollow stolen it from you again?<eos> Children, please use your words.<eos> - You're out of order. - Those thorns are made with my blood and the Hollow's magic,<eos> - so give it to me!<eos> - Stop it, both of you!<eos> Elijah is gone, we are under attack, and we cannot defeat our enemy with you two<eos> - at each other's throat.<eos> - She's right.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna give the thorns to the Hollow.<eos> I want them for something else, and I don't need them to hurt you.
Well, then you should go.<eos> I'll find the thorns myself, butcher my way through this entire city if that's what it takes, and if it turns out Marcel has taken them, I'll deal with him as well.<eos> Oh, lovely, you're sounding like your old self.<eos> Well, someone has to protect this family.<eos> And there it is.<eos> The excuse that you always use.<eos> You know, if you're so determined to be this way, then everything that Elijah has done for you, including his death, will be for nothing.<eos> Must be in here.<eos> Elijah?<eos> I'm here to help you.
Take the Objects.<eos> Just please let me talk to her.<eos> You Mikaelsons come around asking for favors, threatening, manipulating.<eos> That's why we're gonna make sure you never see Davina Claire again.<eos> Let me talk to her now!<eos> You guys put up a good fight.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Still, at the end of the day, too little... too late.<eos> And that is the last one.<eos> I suppose I should say thank you for your hard work.
You can have one or the other, power or friends.<eos> You know that's psychotic, right?<eos> Yeah, but then... maybe there's some truth to it, too.<eos> Well, for what it's worth... pretty glad you're my friend.<eos> I mean, whatever's coming, whatever this city's gonna face, the Hollow, the Mikaelsons,<eos> I know that you will do the right thing.<eos> I've never doubted that.<eos> The Hollow's unlike anything we've ever faced before.<eos> There's a... a darkness to her, coldness.<eos> And I'll tell you, Josh, as strong as I am, she took me down like I was nothing.
Something like that.<eos> You should be here, too, you know.<eos> Well, everybody got what they wanted.<eos> At least we have each other.<eos> Kol... I'm going to stay in New Orleans.<eos> At least until we see this through.<eos> Can I convince you to do the same?<eos> I don't think I can.<eos> I'm not in the mood for games, witch.<eos> What if I told you I could bring Davina back to life?
Oh, no, Ms. Mikaelson, I'm coming with.<eos> I've got yours.<eos> Right, right.<eos> You knew this day would come. All those years abstaining from magic, afraid that if you practiced,<eos> I might come around.<eos> Still, after all that, here I am.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Hiding inside the body of a vampire, because you're not as strong as you want me to think.<eos> You always had such spine.<eos> It's what I enjoyed most about you.

To what do I owe the displeasure?<eos> I thought we had a truce.<eos> We do.<eos> If we didn't, I might've responded differently when Davina asked me to sacrifice you.<eos> And does our truce extend to my brother, despite your extensive grievances?<eos> Well, yeah, I want to get Sofya back and stop the Hollow.<eos> As long as you guys want the same thing, I don't see why we can't play nice.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, far be it from me to jump to conclusions, but the last time anyone saw my brother, he was on his way here to talk to you.
Though I believe the odds are in my favor.<eos> Once the ritual is completed, my spirit will return to New Orleans' soil.<eos> From it, I will be reborn far stronger than I have ever been.<eos> You are just another body for my brother to slay.<eos> You expect your brother to avenge you?<eos> Inspired, perhaps, by duty to the familial bond.<eos> I've been inside Klaus' mind.<eos> You care for one another so deeply.<eos> It's quite ludicrous, this dedication to one's own blood.<eos> After all, look where it got you.
That my impending execution pleases you.<eos> There's no shame in taking pleasure in finally felling a long-standing foe.<eos> "The man who killed Klaus Mikaelson."<eos> That'll make a lovely epitaph on your tombstone.<eos> May be engraved sooner than you think, if things don't go our way.<eos> The truth is, Klaus, I never thought I'd live to see this day.<eos> See, growing up in New Orleans as kids, we-we hear stories about the evil Klaus Mikaelson.<eos> Yes, yes, and now I'll finally reap my just desserts.<eos> No.<eos> I was gonna say, here you are, finally living up to the potential that Cami saw in you.
Right now, I need you to gather up your young ones, pull together your families and get out of town.<eos> Seek safe haven someplace else. Do not come back here until I tell you that it's safe to come back here.<eos> Vincent, come with us.<eos> No<eos> You can't fight on your own.<eos> No, but what I can do is make sure nobody else gets pulled into this thing.<eos> Now what I need for you to do:<eos> get Adam, take him someplace safe.<eos> Take this.<eos> It helped you once before.
You Mikaelsons, you always find a way to get right back on top, don't you?<eos> And I bet you got a plan all figured out. As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> A rather festive one, in fact.<eos> I'd love to tell you all about it.<eos> Well, if you're gonna help me fight this thing, you're gonna have to know what it is that you're up against.<eos> Come in before I change my mind.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> We were heading out, and now we're throwing a party, I see.<eos> One that will be attended by New Orleans' most influential supernatural denizens.<eos> You do realize that everyone hates you.
So, you know... one plus one equals captured.<eos> They invited you, hoping to sell the illusion it was Marcel's idea.<eos> Well, it's your lucky day.<eos> I'm your plus-one. Yeah.<eos> Actually, I wasn't even gonna go.<eos> I'll be damned if I'm gonna let Marcel rot right underneath Klaus's feet.<eos> This might be our one chance to get him out.<eos> I can deal with Klaus. You will find Marcel, or I will reconsider allowing you to live.<eos> I like her, for what it's worth.<eos> Uh, all the same, I should've told you she was still here.
I'm sorry I didn't.<eos> Well, you can make up for it by doing me a favor.<eos> I learned about the man who killed my parents.<eos> He was connected to the Hollow.<eos> I was just a baby when they were killed. I don't remember it, but I...<eos> I do know where they were killed.<eos> I was hoping, maybe, with your spells and your witchcraft...<eos> You want me to do a reading.<eos> Hayley, violent death has a very specific energy.<eos> I could conjure up whatever there is to see, but you might not like it.
You ransacked my place. Classy.<eos> Well, to the victor goes the spoils.<eos> And now that you know I have it, you know I can use it at my leisure.<eos> Then use it. Or else go back to your stupid party. Excellent.<eos> You can hear our merriment above.<eos> Freya assured me that you would.<eos> She also assured me that her boundary spell would render you invisible to anyone outside our bloodline.<eos> If you think that waving that blade around is gonna scare me, you're more desperate than I thought.<eos> You misunderstand.<eos> This is not to scare you, it's merely to illuminate your conundrum.
Well, given your reputation, one can never be too careful.<eos> Not unless you have something to worry about.<eos> Which you do, because you're the high priest of the Hollow.<eos> You seem to have made up your mind about me. Not really fair.<eos> After all, you're the one who allowed the Hollow into this world.<eos> See, your ancestors were the only thing holding it back.<eos> And when you severed that link, you allowed it to go free.<eos> And it has been feeding and growing in power ever since.<eos> See, I wonder if it will want to show you its appreciation.<eos> Perhaps by letting you see your dead wife.

Both of you!<eos> Leave us.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Let's start again.<eos> So what is it you like about him, then?
Either way, we really ain't got nothing to talk about.<eos> That's fine.<eos> But I should say... thank you for helping my family.<eos> Your niece.<eos> Besides your niece, I don't give a damn about you or anybody else in your family.<eos> I'm here right now because there's something that's hurting kids in my city.<eos> And the second that it is gone, I'm gonna make sure that you're gone, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> You hate me because of what I did to Davina.<eos> You know, I can't say I blame you.
Want me to break his legs?<eos> How about, uh, we just grab a drink?<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me what it wants.<eos> Well, the Hollow has lain dormant for a long time.<eos> It needs to feed.<eos> The poor dear.<eos> You know, I understand it has a penchant for innocent children.<eos> Only as hors d'oeuvres.<eos> It prefers the power channeled by the death of someone like you.

Well, I'm terribly sorry, of course.<eos> Still, I am glad I confiscated all your weapons, what with you being so hell-bent on revenge and all.<eos> Careful not to overplay your hand, Klaus.<eos> I've hated you a lot longer than I've known Marcel.<eos> Was a hell of a show you put on tonight, Elijah.<eos> Hell of a show.<eos> I did what I had to.<eos> And you're quite welcome.<eos> Dominic wanted you dead.<eos> So, am I supposed to thank you?

It can't be bargained or reasoned with.<eos> I don't bargain. And I'm done with reason.<eos> What about you?

Easy, Klaus.<eos> The only reason I'm heading your way is because I don't want you anywhere near Mystic Falls.<eos> Things tend to get murder-y when you're around.<eos> Well, that's a fair point.<eos> Now, Alaric, if our pleasantries have run their course...<eos> Oh, hey, listen, one more thing.<eos> The Lockwoods, they didn't just safeguard the bone...<eos> They kept records with names, dates and locations.<eos> Turns out they had knowledge of other families that were charged with guarding the rest of the remains.<eos> Now, does the name Labonair mean anything to you?
- It's familiar, yeah.<eos> - Well, good.<eos> That might be a lead to help you find the rest of the remains.<eos> Which you'll have to do yourself, because my days of fighting monsters are over.<eos> Okay, so here's the deal...<eos> I will be at Jack's Bar-B-Q Shack off Route 59 until 2:00.<eos> If you're not there by 2:10, I chuck the bone and the records in a Dumpster and I'm gone.<eos> And then you can fish them out of the trash yourself.<eos> Well, I'm afraid I'll be otherwise occupied, so you'll be meeting Elijah.<eos> And if, perchance, he's running late, I suggest you exercise some patience and have yourself a beer.
Of which we have none.<eos> The hell are you doing here?<eos> If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Meeting an expert shortly.<eos> He'll be coming by way of Mystic Falls, carrying one of the bones and the means to find another.<eos> Between the three of us, we should have those remains by sundown.<eos> Why should I trust you?
We may as well get some answers. So are we to wander around this dreary purgatory in search of lost souls?<eos> I wasn't sure you were gonna show up.<eos> Well, I'm full of surprises.<eos> I hope you intend to make our trip worth the effort.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> And you are gonna listen to every single word I have to say, because right now, I'm the only thing standing between you and the Hollow.<eos> How is Kol?<eos> Can't see anything here except New Orleans.<eos> I believe he's currently traipsing through the French Riviera, though I'm sure he'll return once I tell him how lovely you remain.<eos> - Death becomes you. - Stop talking.
Yeah, the only reason that you invited me on on this little road trip is so you could play bodyguard.<eos> - Baby-sitter.<eos> - Keep my power from falling into the hands of the Hollow, right?<eos> Now, see, you're always working some angle to protect your family.<eos> At least Klaus is up front about it, but not you with your manners and your suits and your handkerchiefs.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> We're under threat.<eos> I know that, and I know how you handle threats.<eos> You made that clear when you tore my heart out five years ago.<eos> And just so we're clear now, there's no way I will ever forgive you for that.
- You think this is a joke,<eos> - No, but it is a trifle tedious.<eos> Perhaps you could get to the bit of the story that might be of some use.<eos> You want to defeat the Hollow?<eos> She only has one weakness.<eos> You have my undivided attention.<eos> What is it?<eos> You.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> I'm done talking to you.
You men and your silly posturing.<eos> You should know better.<eos> After all, your prize already belongs to me.<eos> Sofya, I know you're still in there.<eos> She is.<eos> Strong soul rattling around in a dying shell.<eos> But like all the rest of you, she's nothing compared to me.<eos> One last time.<eos> Give me what I seek.<eos> - Why don't you come get it?
So they burned her remains, but not all the pieces could be destroyed.<eos> As long as those pieces were together, her power only grew.<eos> The indestructible bones were distributed among four families... each charged with keeping the bones apart, so that they would never come together again.<eos> Now that she's free, she won't stop until those pieces are gathered.<eos> Well, then put her back in the prison that held her for the last eon.<eos> I will.<eos> And that's what you're here for.<eos> Hurts, huh?<eos> My blood?<eos> Whoever told you how to destroy me left a little something out.
Tell me, which of you will die to stop me?<eos> No one is dying today.<eos> Well, then I guess we're done.<eos> You okay?<eos> I think someone is going to die.<eos> Davina has Klaus.<eos> Wait...<eos> The Ancestors need a sacrifice to put the Hollow down for good.<eos> Davina will not hesitate.<eos> Well, I must say, it's adorable you think you're able to end my life, but you lack the means, sweetheart.
The Hollow created the means.<eos> Thorns from a rosebush grown from Marcel's blood.<eos> That's all I need.<eos> And I've already sent the Harvest Girls to go get some.<eos> When they return, your time is up.<eos> So to cage the Hollow, you need to kill me?<eos> It's a bit convenient, isn't it?<eos> I helped break the link to the Ancestors, which is how the Hollow escaped.<eos> You're going to die a slow, painful death.<eos> I'm sorry, but the best I can do is make it a little easier for you.
- No, Davina.<eos> He's lived ten lifetimes, that's more than enough.<eos> He's Hope's father.<eos> She'll still have you.<eos> But if we don't stop the Hollow, then Hope will die.<eos> You can save her, Marcel.<eos> - And everyone in New Orleans.<eos> - Stop this.<eos> This is about your grievances with me.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
Davina!<eos> - Davina, please...<eos> - You don't have to do this.<eos> I'm sorry, it's the only way.<eos> No!<eos> You promised to help, but you're not helping.<eos> You're hurting us, and I won't let you.<eos> My dad said you study this stuff. Yeah, that's right.<eos> There are a lot of amazing things in the world to study.<eos> And some of them are even things that don't want to hurt you.
Those for me?<eos> After what you did today, your dad compelled the entire Magnolia candy shop.<eos> Dad seemed sad.<eos> I think that he wanted to be the one doing the helping today.<eos> But we both agreed on one thing:<eos> you were very, very brave.<eos> I just thought about what you would do. It's like you always say:<eos> if we stick together, nothing can hurt us.<eos> Always and forever.<eos> I suppose I owe you thanks.
I need you.<eos> I love you.<eos> But we've got to figure out a way to fight and win and still have something that I recognize as a good life.<eos> Rebekah asked me if there was somewhere I could go to be happy.<eos> Begin again.<eos> Manosque.<eos> It's this... beautiful village in the south of France, the... countryside.<eos> And when we end this... and we will end this...<eos> I'll take you there.<eos> And... promise you... I will make this right.
Illegal and creepy, but very romantic.<eos> She left me for a professional water-skier. She said she was the only woman who ever looked hot in a life vest.<eos> How do you fight that?<eos> I think we need more padding.<eos> Like a base layer.<eos> You know, like a...<eos> like a tarp or something.<eos> Whoa. I didn't even ask you to move in, Pipes.<eos> That's, uh... that's pretty presumptuous.<eos> Alex Vause, may I put my prison-issue mattress next to your bulldozer scoopie thingy, and ride out a nightmare with you?
- And I do?<eos> We all think about taking down these cabrones, but we don't act on it 'cause we got things to live for.<eos> You gotta get outta here and see your girl.<eos> Look at me. Hey.<eos> You need to take a timeout, okay?<eos> Why don't you help me clean up?<eos> We could do it together.<eos> Busy hands could help clear your head, huh?<eos> My head hurts, all right?<eos> I want nothing to do with you.
Charging people to work?<eos> This is America, lady.<eos> Slavery ain't legal here!<eos> Mei... are you in here against your will?<eos> Come on, slave!<eos> We're hangry!<eos> How long does it take to fry, poach and scramble some damn eggs?<eos> Ladies, I am moving as fast as I can.<eos> You know, all I have is powdered eggs.<eos> Did we say you could talk?
Yo, we're all on the news, dumbass.<eos> It's good 'cause people need to start taking us serious...<eos> No, my actual ass.<eos> See.<eos> Really?<eos> Way to keep it classy, perra.<eos> - That hoo-ha out, too?<eos> Shit.<eos> - I put it all out.<eos> Um, can I help you with something?
We were only prison gay.<eos> Minus the gay part.<eos> Yeah, what can I say? I missed you.<eos> How's everything out there?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Gettin' mad job offers.<eos> You know, different nail salons.<eos> After they seen my cheetah toes, everybody been fightin' over me.<eos> - You see?<eos> I told you you'd kill it.

I told you you'd kill it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You called it.<eos> How about you?<eos> Same shit, same day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something like that.<eos> You all right, girl?<eos> You sound funny.<eos> Listen, I gotta tell you something.
- You can hide in here.<eos> Get... get in.<eos> - What?<eos> Trust me, I've seen it done.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - People fit.<eos> Just get in.<eos> Get the fuck in there.<eos> Don't close it all the way. Shhh!<eos> Let me give you a little preview of how this thing's gonna end.
Because lye doesn't feel anything until it touches ephedrine.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Have you ever... wanted somebody that you shouldn't?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's called masturbating.<eos> Now, say goodbye and walk the fuck away, son.<eos> God. God damn it.<eos> Now the Estée Lauder makeup bag is our final offer and if you act now we'll throw in, uh, lightly used Invisalign braces.<eos> Oh, wait. For what size mouth?<eos> Mmm. They might work for you, gappy.
Now get down!<eos> Heel!<eos> - Shit, we at the White House?<eos> - Sure ain't no Black House.<eos> Uh, Janae!<eos> Over here.<eos> This is Courtney, your buddy for the day. Courtney, Janae.<eos> We are so glad to have you here.<eos> Come on!<eos> I'll give you the tour.
It went through arbitration. It was... a guard's word against a dead inmate's.<eos> But where there is guilt, there's recourse.<eos> There's always pins that can be pushed under fingernails.<eos> How do you plan on getting to his fingers when you're in here, in a riot, and he's out there, with no charges against him?<eos> Maybe, if you wish hard enough, he'll suddenly decide to sit down and write a confession called "I did it."<eos> Yes... that's good.<eos> - But that's good...<eos> - No, that's not good.<eos> Red, let's make a deal.<eos> If you help me out of this, I will write you a glowing commendation for your file.
She ain't in mourning.<eos> She ain't outraged.<eos> This is our fight, T.<eos> Ours and Poussey's.<eos> And you're gonna let some fuckin' white woman, like, karaoke our song.<eos> That's fucked.<eos> I got this.<eos> You get to keep the laptops?<eos> No, we keep them during the year and then we return them so that they can update or replace them over the summer.<eos> Oh, so what did you think of class?
Oh, so what did you think of class?<eos> I'm sorry we spent so much time on citations.<eos> Erik thinks we need to know MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.<eos> One of these is my brother's.<eos> For chess.<eos> He's a total nerd.<eos> He's at Carnegie Mellon now.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do you like musical theater?<eos> Because I have something amazing to show you.
Can you please let him out?<eos> Hey, do you have any big erasers?<eos> I have sensitive cochlea!<eos> - And I can't stand this fucking idiot.<eos> - Fine!<eos> Shut up!<eos> All right.<eos> You wanna go to the bathroom, Stratman?<eos> Come on, come on. You...<eos> You go in the fucking Poo.
Why the fuck would I do that?<eos> It's 120 degrees in here.<eos> The stench...<eos> My vomit is almost reaching the rim.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No can do.<eos> You know there will be severe consequences for this.<eos> You know that, Ruiz?<eos> Riots end, and inmates go to Max with years added to their sentence.<eos> If you help me, I will help you.
My daughter won't even know my name by the time I get out anyway.<eos> Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?<eos> 'Course I'm sure!<eos> You... you had a hearing already?<eos> - Then it's not a done deal.<eos> And with the speed paperwork moves around Litchfield, I wouldn't be surprised if his recommendation is not even in your file yet.<eos> Have you seen your file?<eos> Piscatella, he's a... monster.<eos> He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.<eos> But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.
'Course I'm sure!<eos> You... you had a hearing already?<eos> - Then it's not a done deal.<eos> And with the speed paperwork moves around Litchfield, I wouldn't be surprised if his recommendation is not even in your file yet.<eos> Have you seen your file?<eos> Piscatella, he's a... monster.<eos> He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.<eos> But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.<eos> I've seen you with the other inmates.<eos> They look up to you.
The aesthetic can come up and then the clientele can come up a little bit, and you'd be surprised...<eos> You know, your name's right here. Sir? You can put it right down here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Manager wanted me to make sure you still had one of these in your room.<eos> - Yeah, we're all set.<eos> It's chock-full of, uh clever-sounding, overly-judgmental one-liners.<eos> Yeah, look, Wyatt, is it?<eos> I really don't wanna have to get you fired today, okay?<eos> Well, if you could, I'd have to thank you.
This job's my old man's idea.<eos> Something about "calluses and character."<eos> Yeah, well, you're blowing leaves, not hiding Anne Frank.<eos> I doubt that that argument resonates with a Baptist Kansas City lawyer, but I'll give it a go.<eos> - Your dad's a lawyer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We've got a, uh, summer home out here.<eos> And, uh, well, I'm going to Mizzou in the fall.<eos> - Dad's not happy about my major, so he's hoping I'll have some, like, come-to-Jesus summer and switch.<eos> - What about you?
Hey, uh, you wanna pick up the, uh, brothers Langmore,<eos> Wyatt and Three?<eos> Yeah, they're living with their dad, Russ.<eos> His trailer's in the cove.<eos> Right.<eos> - Sheriff, you have a picture of Ruth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She is a B and E magician.<eos> Don't put down anything around her that you're fond of.<eos> Hey. Why do I buy you a phone if you don't answer it?
to kill us? Yeah, I don't think that he will.<eos> Why would he?<eos> - You don't have to do this. - I know.<eos> - Listen. - You don't.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> On this piece of paper is Del's e-mail. And underneath it is an address and the number of a storage unit.<eos> And that's where his money is.<eos> That's where he'll find it.<eos> In three hours, I want you to call the sheriff, and I want you to tell the sheriff that I haven't come back<eos> - and that you're worried.
Dennis.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Soft boiled eggs, Quiche Lorraine, cold smoked salmon, hot smoked salmon, organic muesli, fresh apricots, Greek yogurt. Yep.<eos> A whole spread.<eos> And let's add some muffins, and breakfast breads, etcetera, to that.<eos> Muffins and breakfast breads, etcetera?<eos> That's right.<eos> A whole spread.<eos> Seriously, get away from me, man.<eos> I don't want you around me anymore.
Now I'm normal, a-hole.<eos> Dennis.<eos> I don't care about you.<eos> I'm full of shit now.<eos> Look, man, I care about that, I'm sorry, but I never asked you to fuck anyone, guy.<eos> Guy? I'm guy now?<eos> Dennis, stop.<eos> I won't think twice.<eos> I won't blink.<eos> Imagine something you don't think I can actually do to you. Because we're friends.
When are you going to be British?<eos> You've been here 25 years.<eos> What does it mean, long face?<eos> Why so blue?<eos> I have a task.<eos> I have some work this year.<eos> So, what?<eos> It involves your brother.<eos> I'll need your help, Kkyman.<eos> I'm going to ask a good deal from you.
And no one will ever love him.<eos> That's pretty heavy.<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> So get with it.<eos> For sure.<eos> You sound "not all in." FYI, I'm a fighter.<eos> And I am fighting for these memories.<eos> So, are you on my team?<eos> Count me in.<eos> Hey, just wanted to give you an update about my life.
Yeah.<eos> That's all he has to do.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Could it really be that simple?<eos> Thanks, Tim.<eos> You can have a heart attack now.<eos> Fuck you, buddy.<eos> Hey? Stay there.<eos> No matter what happens.<eos> Stay and fend off whatever comes at you this week.
Okay. So then?<eos> What happened next on that day?<eos> Then we just stood here.<eos> Then I felt a feeling...<eos> John.<eos> John, you're wife's here.<eos> Hey, Dennis.<eos> Hey, John.<eos> John, come here.<eos> Are you okay?
Mum is dead.<eos> And Hopeful, she's dead too.<eos> And her friend Sunshine, she's dead.<eos> And Eliza.<eos> And quite a few other people are dead.<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> You can't say things like that, grinning like an idiot.<eos> Smile, really.<eos> Try.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.
One portion.<eos> Is there going to be food sexism even in the future?<eos> Is this bloke utopia?<eos> It's probably reading me as two people.<eos> The heartbeats.<eos> If you're going to travel 20 light years, you're going to want to make sure you've got somewhere to sleep at the end of it, aren't you?<eos> - So, what do you do?<eos> - Sorry? Two hearts?<eos> You send a rocketload of intelligent robots up ahead of you.<eos> They build you a place to live, so that, when you arrive, it's all waiting.
You've moved on.<eos> You know what happens if I don't move on? More people die.<eos> There are kids living rough near here, they may well be next on the menu.<eos> Do you want to help me? Do you want to stand here stamping your foot?<eos> Because let me tell you something. I'm 2,000 years old... and I have never had the time for the luxury of outrage.<eos> What do you mean, "on the menu"?<eos> - Is this where you live?<eos> But there's no-one here.<eos> Good work!<eos> Except you, Dot.
Fish pie!<eos> Hello.<eos> Aren't you magnificent?<eos> I ate that pie!<eos> I liked that pie!<eos> Definitely not carnivores.<eos> Which means you're cooperating with the creature.<eos> Providing for it.<eos> What do you get in return?<eos> What did it take for you to evolve into that?
Leave me alone.<eos> How about that for a new idea?<eos> I didn't ask to be re-assembled, did I?<eos> Knocking.<eos> What was that about?<eos> No-one's going to open the door, just because you're knocking!<eos> Getting cocky now, are you?<eos> Why?<eos> What do you think you know?<eos> What has he told you?

Thank you!<eos> My husband is in an adjoining room with his ex-wife.<eos> So that's great.<eos> Fun Ethan is here.<eos> Fun Ethan actually farted a little earlier.<eos> - Should we...<eos> - Go in?<eos> Yes, let's get in this bitch.<eos> - So what's up?<eos> - I haven't heard from you in a while.
Are you ready? We've got some orders.<eos> Dial it back, babe.<eos> It's not...<eos> - I'm sorry. My husband is sitting there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's so funny. They told us to sit here.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Time to get served up. Time to get served up. What?<eos> - Hey. How's it going?<eos> - Good. How are you?
They just fought.<eos> Well, then, get divorced and then sleep with someone else.<eos> I mean, this isn't a wedding, this is a celebration of cheating.<eos> I don't know. I think guys get married specifically so that they can cheat.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. I think then, you know, it makes it more exciting.<eos> It's, like, less... dull and lame.<eos> The sex is spicier.<eos> - That is the dumbest thing I've heard.<eos> - Thanks. - From you.
- A little. I just moved to the city.<eos> - I haven't seen her in a long time.<eos> - Where's her husband?<eos> I don't know. He's not here.<eos> Yeah, I mean, are they solid, you know?<eos> Because me and her are vibing, kind of hitting it off.<eos> Maybe she wants a piece of the Party Dog.<eos> Listen, Sam is married and she's not gonna leave her husband for some horny surgeon, okay?<eos> You're pretty worked up about this.<eos> You wanted to know the situation, I'm telling you.
- You knew that.<eos> - You could have texted me.<eos> - You texted and said you weren't going!<eos> - Don't lie! You weren't coming.<eos> Whatever. I came here to have a good time and not to sit there and watch you just fawn over Dr. Horn Dog Party Dog.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> I watch you and Lisa all the time.<eos> I'm not flirting with her to rile you up!<eos> - Forget me and go dance with your wife.<eos> - I wanna dance with you!
I'm gonna stop you right there because I'm not loving the whole vibe of this interaction so far.<eos> And I would literally rather have my period for a thousand years, non-stop, than continue this portion of the conversation.<eos> Huh?<eos> You mentioned something earlier about wanting to bone?<eos> - Oh. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - See right here on Tinder, we matched.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> And then, I texted you, "Hi."
I don't know.<eos> Maybe you should have, like, grabbed me by the shoulders, and whispered something real sexy in my ear.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Like...<eos> "Go in the bathroom and take off your panties.<eos> I want to smell 'em."<eos> And you would have done that if I told you to do that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's a huge chance I would have just punched you in your ding-a-ling.
You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was rude.<eos> How do you pay your rent?<eos> I work at a non-profit in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I teach public school kids how to write and produce their own plays.<eos> So, how do you pay your rent?<eos> I, uh, I live in deep Bushwick.<eos> Like, deep, deep, deep Bushwick.<eos> What about you?
Okay, well, thanks.<eos> This was interesting.<eos> In, like, an anthropological way.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could.<eos> Look, I don't want to disappoint you or anything, but...<eos> I don't think we should make out.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I gave up on that idea halfway through the meal.<eos> I enjoyed being honest with you.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes.<eos> Damon.<eos> I should have never let you go.<eos> Damon, this is literally so crazy.<eos> Please come off the ledge.<eos> I can't. I won't go on without you.<eos> You're being so melodramatic right now.<eos> I live on the second floor.<eos> I need to tell you how I feel.
Oh, well, what did you do?<eos> Everything else?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Anal?<eos> What?<eos> No! Are you crazy?<eos> Anal?<eos> Well, do you like him?<eos> I'm not even sure if I like dudes anymore.<eos> Well, let me know if you wanna make out because I would totally be into helping you transition.
- Who?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We had dinner.<eos> We, um, stayed over at my place and we had dessert?<eos> The divorced guy.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry, I forgot that was your name.<eos> No, sure, that's understandable.<eos> Uh, how are you?
We, um, stayed over at my place and we had dessert?<eos> The divorced guy.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry, I forgot that was your name.<eos> No, sure, that's understandable.<eos> Uh, how are you?<eos> It's, um, kind of a weird moment for me.<eos> I guess I'm okay.<eos> - What about you?
- Oh, I'm great.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Listen, I had a terrific time the other night.<eos> Oh, my God. Is this a booty call? No.<eos> No. No.<eos> Do people still say booty call?<eos> This is totally a booty call.<eos> Oh, Boone.<eos> Okay, I guess it's kind of a booty call.<eos> But I did enjoy spending time with you.
- Sweet.<eos> - Let's do it on three.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - One, two, three...<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Okay, how do you feel?<eos> I already hate it.<eos> I want to know what's going on already.<eos> What about you?
- And then it wasn't.<eos> Well, why do you think that is?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You tell me.<eos> - Oh, wow!<eos> You act so...<eos> You don't realize how frustrating it is, how stubborn,<eos> - and hardheaded you are sometimes.<eos> - I am not stubborn.<eos> Okay, do you want me to explain to you why it ended?
And I can tell because I just so happen to be a brain-eating zombie who loves kids' brains.<eos> Yes. I knew that.<eos> And I have something to tell you.<eos> I'm a zombie slayer.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> And we have a long feud going back... centuries, and centuries, and centuries.<eos> Yes, and for some reason, we always seem to run in circles which is why we've been feuding for so long.<eos> Yes, this is a cosmic dance between two people.<eos> Two people who don't know how to fight.<eos> But I came here today to tell you... that I love you.
Two people who don't know how to fight.<eos> But I came here today to tell you... that I love you.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - It's Boone.<eos> - Who?<eos> Just kidding.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> What's up?<eos> I was just, um, calling to let you know that Damon finally started watching The Sopranos and he thinks it's pretty good.
Well, that depends, Boone.<eos> What's your idea of a real date?<eos> Hot dogs and laser tag?<eos> - Um, I'm busy.<eos> - I'm joking.<eos> Something brilliant.<eos> No, we'll, um...<eos> We'll have a great time, I promise.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll go on a real date with you.
But I've never really felt love.<eos> Until now, Dustin.<eos> You complete my everything.<eos> I love our love.<eos> I love you.<eos> Madison, I know.<eos> You made me see that the one could be anyone.<eos> As long as there's love.<eos> And having you by my side is what completes me.<eos> I can honestly tell you this has been the best day of my whole life.
I am both flattered and offended.<eos> No, I just...<eos> I can't believe you've never skated.<eos> I've been six feet tall since I was 12 years old.<eos> Not once have I thought, "Oh, let me put some wheels on this."<eos> - You're doing great.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> You wanna try without the baby thing?<eos> I don't want to let go of this.<eos> Everybody's kind of sniggering at you.
"You're so right. That cat video was cute and funny."<eos> That's amazing.<eos> You're like a genius or something.<eos> - You don't think it's awful?<eos> - No, I think it's trash.<eos> But it's cool that you do it.<eos> - That's awesome.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Do you think I could get a hook up for like my mom and my sister?<eos> - How thoughtful of you.
- You don't think it's awful?<eos> - No, I think it's trash.<eos> But it's cool that you do it.<eos> - That's awesome.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Do you think I could get a hook up for like my mom and my sister?<eos> - How thoughtful of you.<eos> - Do you know a guy? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I, sort of, know a guy.<eos> How about you?
- What?<eos> A rejection letter?<eos> No. I would love to read one of your plays.<eos> Maybe, I'll think about it and get back to you.<eos> You'd happily share it with a room full of strangers, but for me, you have to think about it.<eos> Yeah, well, it's different to share it with somebody that you know.<eos> It's like really intimate.<eos> I already know I'm gonna like it.<eos> Okay, well, don't do that.<eos> If I do show you my stuff, and that's if, you have to promise me that you will be honest.

- Jess... - Jess.<eos> Jess.<eos> Jess.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm okay, just thinking.<eos> I was gonna make some coffee.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> - Oh, I am more of a tea person. - Ah.<eos> So...<eos> Then, I shall bring you tea.
Uh, hey.<eos> - Ms. James?<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> What are you doing over here?<eos> Where's your mom?<eos> Oh, she's waiting for me around the corner.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Well, my dad got your message.<eos> Can you just tell him I'm sorry about that?<eos> He told me to tell you that he's glad that you haven't been broken by life yet.
I'm so excited.<eos> - This is gonna be great. - Huh.<eos> Yeah, yeah, great.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My dad's still taking my brother to Six Flags.<eos> So?<eos> So?<eos> Six Flags seems pretty awesome.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I thought you were serious about this program?
I'm not mad at you.<eos> I'm just really disappointed.<eos> Look, you have to go to this writer's weekend, okay?<eos> Otherwise, I'll be super hurt if you don't.<eos> That's not fair!<eos> Wake up, Shandra.<eos> Since when is life supposed to be fair?<eos> You know what?<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'll send you a postcard from Six Flags.
Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to apologize.<eos> About what?<eos> I'm really, really sorry for making you feel bad about wanting to spend time with your dad.<eos> Do you mind if I sit down?<eos> Well, this is a really cool room.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I thought about you a lot this weekend.<eos> I thought of how it must be hard to be 11 years old and have your parents negotiating through lawyers to spend time with you.
Who did you pick?<eos> My mom.<eos> But it wasn't because I loved her more.<eos> You know, I really loved both of my parents.<eos> I just thought that my mom would have harder time without us.<eos> And that really broke my dad's heart. And he hasn't forgiven me for that.<eos> But you never got that dog either, did you?<eos> No.<eos> That's sad.<eos> I brought you back something.

Thanks.<eos> I would really, really, really like to help you work on your play.
Cool.<eos> Because your mom already told me I could stay for dinner.<eos> And so far, it smells dope!<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I was so pleased you called.<eos> I brought you some tea.
I was so pleased you called.<eos> I brought you some tea.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You remembered.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> Look, I am really sorry.<eos> What are you talking about? It...<eos> You don't need to apologize for anything.<eos> No, you told me early on you were still trying to figure stuff out and I guess I just didn't listen, and...<eos> You know, for what it's worth, I, uh, I called, and got my Windsurfing Magazine redirected to my place.
What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm just going to London.<eos> Okay, what for?<eos> I've been invited by the Donmar Warehouse Theater to teach at a children's playmaking workshop and direct a stage reading of one of my plays.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, congratulations!<eos> - Thank you. - Oh!<eos> Uh, anyway, I got you something.

- Just keep cool.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You've got this.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were coming tonight.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I know how much this means to you.<eos> That's...<eos> How are you?
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were coming tonight.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I know how much this means to you.<eos> That's...<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good?<eos> I'm good, yeah.<eos> You?
It's like kind of a big deal.<eos> Nice!<eos> Good job.<eos> - Have you ever been to London?<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> Oh, it's the best.<eos> You're gonna have such a great time.<eos> You know, I, um...<eos> I have a ton of frequent flier miles.<eos> You know, just if you wanted to bring someone with you to show you around the town.
Get out of the way.<eos> Can't believe it's you.<eos> I'd rather eat a skunk's balls.<eos> I'll save it for later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was nice of you.

They made me a custodian.<eos> I had free run of the place.<eos> I saw things.<eos> I learned how they think.<eos> Someone gets out of Hell to tell the tale?<eos> Never.<eos> Listen to me, Eugene.<eos> Hell is more than Zagnuts and flat basketballs.<eos> There are other places they can put you.<eos> That was nice of you, Eugene.
What, the... the vampire part?<eos> The not dying part.<eos> If you could have that, would you want it?<eos> Live forever, huh?<eos> I guess it'd be cool.<eos> You don't have to worry, 'cause nothin' hurts you, you know?<eos> There's nothin' to be afraid of.<eos> Yeah, well, things still hurt.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You got all your fingers chopped off.
Christ, I can't remember the last time I was on a beach.<eos> Yup.<eos> Me neither.<eos> I hate the beach.<eos> And there's the boredom.<eos> You've heard every joke...<eos> Drugs barely work.<eos> And then everyone you ever cared or loved just...<eos> Just dies.<eos> Except you.
Or a coffee pot.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think he might be right.<eos> The resolution's completely deteriorated.<eos> Maybe if we did a-a pixel recalibration.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> An Extrapolator.<eos> I told you we could make things worse.
No, guys!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Guys!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> No!<eos> No! I said stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Eugene? !<eos> I called your father!<eos> He's gonna be very upset with you!
I called your father!<eos> He's gonna be very upset with you!<eos> Finish the job.<eos> Eugene!<eos> Go on, Eugene.<eos> Finish the job.<eos> That's right.<eos> Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, that's right.<eos> Come on.<eos> I told you I was gonna come for you, Eugene.
Papa, please.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You had to see for yourself.<eos> You had to see.<eos> Once they find out you are the mistake, that is where they will put you.<eos> And not just for an hour or two, but forever.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> You have to trust me, Eugene.<eos> I want to help you.

Oh, no?<eos> Then what?<eos> I have a son.<eos> And I imagine you have dozens, but congratulations.<eos> No, it's not like that.<eos> Look, Denis is not new, alright?<eos> He's old.<eos> And he's sick.<eos> How well do you know him?<eos> I just told you he's me son, didn't I?
So, what, are we looking for God on YouTube now?<eos> Is that what it's come to?<eos> God is missing, Cass. It's important.<eos> Without God, there's no structure.<eos> No order.<eos> Without someone at the wheel, we hit the rocks. It's just chaos.<eos> There has to be someone in charge. You see, without God, we...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No. Thank you, Papa.
Come here, let me see it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, see, you've got to be careful now.<eos> All right?<eos> The sun's bad. The sun's very, very bad.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come here.<eos> Drink this.<eos> It'll help you heal.
We need more than one. Great.<eos> Do you take credit card?<eos> No means yes.<eos> Is a corporate card okay?<eos> Yeah, 6-0-1-1...<eos> Hey, uh, I know we just met, but, uh, I really need to borrow your gun.<eos> Uh, I can't tell you why, and everything's cool...<eos> I mean, I'm cool.<eos> I just need a gun.<eos> Are you okay?
Copy that.<eos> Still nothing? Nope.<eos> All clear.<eos> Anything?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Who's the guy in the kitchen? He's just the cleaner.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Just, uh, the cleaner.<eos> Mr. Clean Machine doing his cleaning thing. Okay.<eos> - You all right? - Yep.
Step away from the car, you...<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Hey!<eos> 10-double zero!<eos> Officer down!<eos> What is it?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Turn it down!<eos> I can't hear what you're...
Cass! They're here!<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Jesse, I got to...<eos> - They're here!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> I need one alive!<eos> What'd you do that for?<eos> He's one of them, Jesse.<eos> That's what I was trying to tell you.
Okay, well...<eos> I'm gonna go keep a look-out.<eos> Yeah, that's a good idea.<eos> We'll, uh... clean up the cleaner.<eos> We're gonna need an ambulance up here.<eos> We've had an accident.<eos> Copy that.<eos> What now?<eos> Something is coming, Cass.<eos> I'm telling you.
In October 2012, we chose to represent Breast Cancer Care and I decided to use all of my savings to begin construction on Doris.<eos> A year and a half into the project,<eos> Cambridge rower Emma Mitchell joined the team.<eos> There was a lot of hard work securing sponsorships that we needed.<eos> We did a final recruitment in May of 2014, and this is where we met Izzy, Natalia, as well as our two reserve rowers, Lizanne and Meg.<eos> We've trained extensively, both mentally and physically, to make sure we are best prepared for anything that we face.<eos> At the end of the day, this is unsupported.<eos> We've got to roll with the punches.<eos> That's part of the expedition.<eos> To me, if you've then got somebody following you along, it's too easy to have an option to jump out and go, "We'll just jump on that bigger ship because that's going to be a bit more comfortable,"
And then we're back on the oars at quarter past 3.<eos> [Emma] Life on Doris is beautifully simple.<eos> All you have to do is sit on the oars and row for two hours, and then you have your two hours where you're either eating or sleeping or doing the jobs and stuff that you need to do on the boat.<eos> [Laura] Doris is our pink 29-foot ocean rowing boat.<eos> There's two cabins, one at each end.<eos> The cabins are about the size of a fairly small two-man tent.<eos> We've got solar panels along the top of the boat, and they're connected to our batteries, which are underneath the bit that we sleep on in the cabin.<eos> If we drain those batteries, we've got no way of using our GPS or making water and stuff off the electrics.<eos> So, we need to be really careful and calculated about that.<eos> I tell you what. Spend 48 hours sitting in your own bathtub at home and imagine you've got a lid over it, so, you can't quite sit up straight.
I can't believe it's nearly Christmas.<eos> And when we left the U.K., it was the very beginning of April.<eos> It's absolutely mental. I can't believe we're still out here.<eos> And I don't know how we're still doing what we're doing every day, every shift, but we are.<eos> [bell rings]<eos> [Laura] Friends and family and stuff are all at home celebrating Christmas and, um, yeah, I just don't feel very Christmasy even though we've got decorations up and we're listening to Christmas carols and stuff and...<eos> Um, yeah, I just found it quite difficult, really, being away.<eos> Didn't realize how difficult I'd find it.<eos> Hi, Auntie Mary.<eos> How are you?
Previously on THE ROYALS...<eos> So you want to tell me what this text is about?<eos> I'm working on a story about her Royal Highness. And the relationship she's having with her bodyguard.<eos> I gave you so many chances.
'I'd like to hire you.' 'To do what exactly?<eos> ' whatever it is you did and however it is you did it.<eos> Do you want to have sex?<eos> 'When posed by you, the answer to that question is always yes.'<eos> I want to start a charity for wounded vets, help them get their lives back on track.<eos> Mum's been filling me in on everything you've been doing, all your charity work.<eos> She thought maybe I should take it over.<eos> We can't even take a picture together because you're afraid it might get out.<eos> Do you mind taking a picture of us, Sparrow?<eos> I know you have history with Robert, but you have a future with me.
The... The boxing match, yeah.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You're here about a girl.<eos> She's coming over.<eos> Tell her I'm... I'm cool.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Madden's... cool.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> I believe I owe you a free drink.
You're here about a girl.<eos> She's coming over.<eos> Tell her I'm... I'm cool.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Madden's... cool.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> I believe I owe you a free drink.<eos> Only a month later. Perfect timing.<eos> How are you?
- Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Madden's... cool.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> I believe I owe you a free drink.<eos> Only a month later. Perfect timing.<eos> How are you?<eos> How's the girl?<eos> Let's just say things are...<eos> What about you?
Why did you set this up?<eos> Because you hated the secrecy.<eos> And this is a way of introducing you to the public, without the press clamoring for a story.<eos> Because they've already.<eos> Cinderella.<eos> They won't look past that.<eos> So it's a stunt?<eos> No, it's a story that we don't have to hide from.<eos> Look, I know it's a lot, but we can deal with the press stuff later.<eos> Right now, I just want to be with you.
That is not low-key.<eos> I want to build something beyond just being Royal, have a life that matters.<eos> - Make the world better.<eos> And you do, too, or you wouldn't be here now, or this weekend.<eos> And I suspect your father saw that in you all along.<eos> ♪ I'll get you back to me ♪ It's a shame you're so difficult to hang out with.<eos> You know, those poor lepers, they could have been saved.<eos> ♪ You know you're not the only one... ♪ You know, when I was on that island, I knew that if I ever got back here, everything would be like a circus.<eos> And it is.<eos> But being down here with you makes it all easier.
- Oh, sh... - Shit, you scared me.<eos> No, you scared me with that performance back there.<eos> You should win an Oscar and use it like a dildo.<eos> Sorry, I just had to clear my head.<eos> You got that gun on you?<eos> Yeah, it's in my underwear drawer.<eos> What you think?<eos> Go collect the guards from the bubble.<eos> Bring 'em to the chapel.<eos> Get Flaritza to help you, all right? - Flaritza?
Well, I can't go out there.<eos> When there's a revolution, who do you think it is that gets guillotined first?<eos> - The one percent. - Marie-Antoinette.<eos> - The one percent.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And I intend to keep this one-percent neck.<eos> I had it contoured last January after Colicchio told me that it had more rings than a Swiss roll.<eos> But I told him he looked like a manscaped scrotum, which is less poetic, but extremely apt.<eos> You're scared.<eos> That's a new shade from you.
Daddy, this is little-girl stuff.<eos> And you're my little girl.<eos> Name the stars in his belt.<eos> Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka.<eos> Okay, wise guy.<eos> What do you do if it's a cloudy night?<eos> Hope for the best?<eos> Sometimes, knowledge can be dangerous.<eos> When you know the right word for something, it can make you overconfident, dull your senses.<eos> The planet always has something to teach you.

How do you lose a gun?<eos> I don't know. Somebody knocked me out.<eos> I wake up, and I'm this person who's supposed to have power, and I just fucking shot someone.<eos> Shit, I hate when people cry.<eos> Hey, hey, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We've all pretended to have guns that we don't have.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll show you how I make everyone think I got a gun.
- Like, to lift it.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> We could be, like, plastic surgeons.<eos> It's not Demi Moore good, but at least it's, like, Meg Ryan good.<eos> - Yeah, so we ready?<eos> - Maybe a little eyeliner? You know, to wake his eyes up.<eos> Yo, stop fucking around.<eos> Get him on stage.<eos> This ain't over.<eos> When we're done with you, your outside's gonna match your insides.
Don't you be trying to bring any of that crap from inside out here.<eos> Out here, we're trying to relax and shit.<eos> Like you're really relaxing in the middle of all this after what went down?<eos> It's more like I'm just tryin' not to make shit worse.<eos> Yeah, I hear that.<eos> You seriously trying to sit out now?<eos> I think so.<eos> You know, I'm trying to get back home to my baby girl one day, and this might be the only way to avoid all the fucked up shit that keeps finding me.<eos> It's like... It's like I'm a fucked-up-shit magnet.<eos> It ain't you.
Look at Neri!<eos> She's showing.<eos> -You're texting with Cal?<eos> -What else am I gonna do?<eos> It's not like I'm busy with any important riot duties.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sitting this out must be so hard for you.<eos> You gonna spontaneously combust if you're not in charge of something soon?<eos> Whatever you say, my great leader.<eos> I am only here to serve you, my great leader.
That things are gonna be fine?<eos> How does that work, exactly?<eos> Is there a, uh... a magic wand or some type of special God who loves homicidal white guys?<eos> It's not gonna be fine.<eos> The whole point of life is waiting to see what comes next, but... I already know exactly how mine's gonna go.<eos> So what's the point?<eos> I should die.<eos> -Run?<eos> -Mmm-hmm. Run.<eos> As fast as you can, until you feel like your lungs is about to collapse.
-Run?<eos> -Mmm-hmm. Run.<eos> As fast as you can, until you feel like your lungs is about to collapse.<eos> Until you can't think about nothing but how tired your legs are.<eos> I think I'm still drunk.<eos> You won't be after this.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey!<eos> We gonna need your snacks.<eos> Oh, you see how you just say, "yours"?
Before we kidnapped her and nailed her to a cross.<eos> Hand over all your Cheetos and Takis.<eos> Now.<eos> Ooh, Chapman coming in hot!<eos> We didn't get any.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hand 'em over.<eos> We have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - You are a liar. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Anyone ever tell you about the catching bees with honey thing?
Why?<eos> Ms. Tendler said that you--<eos> I'm... I don't think she understood what I was trying to tell her.<eos> Why can't I come?<eos> It's just not a good time for us.<eos> Us.<eos> -Right.<eos> -Uh, look.<eos> I want you to take this.<eos> It's not much, but I want to help you.
I'm talking to people.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm just gonna leave you all to it.<eos> How about that?<eos> And if y'all think that I deserve to be thrown up in the poo-poo or whatever, then fine.<eos> That makes you no better than them.<eos> You know, that's really sad, because they suck.<eos> We had the chance to rule hard up in here.<eos> Y'all don't wanna rule?<eos> -I thought I'd tell you something. -Uh-huh.
Uh, you made a vow, you need to commit to Vinnie, something like that?<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, I get it.<eos> I memorized it.<eos> You can save it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> That is a twist I was not expecting.<eos> I realized when... when we was...<eos> I was looking down at you, and then I saw, "Oh!
Why are you laughing? No.<eos> No, no, no. I'm... I'm...<eos> This is not funny.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, yes. I know you're serious. I know, baby.<eos> And that is the problem.<eos> Because you are also bat-shit crazy.<eos> I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.<eos> It's the hormones.<eos> The hormones, they made me do it with you.
I guess this is how it ends.<eos> Well, this is your chance to retire from all that nonsense out there.<eos> Ain't you tired of dealing with numbskulls?<eos> Fighting for food?<eos> Trying to find a minute of quiet without someone squawking in your ear?<eos> Don't you feel taken for granted?<eos> I got enough supplies down here for all of us.<eos> It's, maybe, a little cramped?<eos> "Thank you, Frieda."<eos> "Gee, this is awful nice of you, Frieda."
Okay, we don't need yellow drink. We need calories.<eos> This got calories.<eos> It's made from the lemon candy at commissary.<eos> Exactly like my mama used to make.<eos> You just take the candies, crunch 'em, right?<eos> And you twirl it around, and then you get that taste.<eos> - Good, right?<eos> - This shit is tasty.<eos> It's like my mama used to say,<eos> "When life hands you lemons, make water with a taste."
Yeah, growing' up, I used to have imaginary friends.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Until one of 'em stole the other one's - imaginary Easy-Bake Oven...<eos> ... and ran him flat over in her imaginary car. Classic.<eos> So, uh, what's, uh, your friend's name?<eos> Mommy is not imaginary.<eos> She and Daddy are here for visitation.<eos> I don't think they're doin' visitation today.<eos> But it's visitation day.<eos> It is visitation day, but all the doors have been locked.<eos> There's no guards to watch you cry.
Thank you, but my name's Tiffany.<eos> Suzanne, hair is not for eating!<eos> It's for keeping your brain warm!<eos> Are you a child?<eos> You're smarter than that.<eos> You should know better than to eat your hair. Hair is not for that.<eos> That's supposed to be like a blanket on your brain to keep you cozy, warm, and protected.<eos> Instead, you're just sitting here, eating it!<eos> Seriously?<eos> I told you.
She think her mama is here.<eos> Well, tell her it's cancelled.<eos> Dude, she jabbering' like The Exorcist.<eos> I don't want to get puked on.<eos> Well, I can't play Mama right now.<eos> You see a problem, you deal with it.<eos> I got enough goin' on.<eos> So that's how it is?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll help you.
The fruits are your fruits.<eos> I mean, um... we could do somethin' for Poussey.<eos> She never did get a proper memorial.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> There's that Ravenclaw brain.<eos> - Don't get cute.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> You woke up.<eos> See?<eos> Told you.
Get your crayons.<eos> I've always been more of a girth gal, myself.<eos> Don't like them long jobbies that poke your cervix.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> Ain't nothin' like a Fat Albert.<eos> Those fatties stretch you out.<eos> I like to stay tight.<eos> Ain't yoga good for that?<eos> No, but it does make the dirty wheelbarrow position a lot easier.<eos> How 'bout you, Norma?
I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Somebody did get shot, and there was a lot of blood.<eos> And I got nobody in here, baby.<eos> - I got nobody.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Go and find someplace to hide.<eos> Someplace safe, away from the guns, all right?<eos> I'm on my way. You... you're comin' here for me?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Listen, I got to tell you somethin'.
And I got nobody in here, baby.<eos> - I got nobody.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Go and find someplace to hide.<eos> Someplace safe, away from the guns, all right?<eos> I'm on my way. You... you're comin' here for me?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Listen, I got to tell you somethin'.<eos> Vinnie. Vin...<eos> Vinnie? Vinnie, I got somethin' to tell you.
Look, I wouldn't be threatening to destroy it if I didn't think it was great.<eos> - Six orange, going once... - No!<eos> Fine!<eos> Pleasure doin' business with you.<eos> - You really shouldn't have.<eos> - Oh, of course I should have.<eos> - Oh. - Well...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But what about visitation?<eos> Now, we done told you, Suzanne.
What exactly do clams got to do with Poussey?<eos> She from Philly.<eos> Well, they're sort of vaginal, you know?<eos> Because of their shape.<eos> Well, technically, oysters make pearls, not clams.<eos> But they're representational here, right?<eos> Do they symbolize pleasure?<eos> Exactly. Yes.<eos> They're orgasms.<eos> - We'll get back to you.
That's copying.<eos> No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> Mine is gonna be so much better.<eos> How she even get pregnant?<eos> She didn't.<eos> Ain't you heard of Lorna la Loca?<eos> Oh, that's Lorna la Loca?<eos> She's cuter than I thought.<eos> Nichols?<eos> Man, didn't anyone ever teach you to knock?
Uh, it's good to be back here.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna do some impressions for y'all today.<eos> Holy ravioli.<eos> My husband put his mozzarella all over my baked ziti, and he told me that he loved me.<eos> Isn't that romantic?<eos> Lorna la Loca!<eos> Hey, blondie.<eos> Does the, uh, carpet match the drapes?<eos> Hey, uh, let me test the echo in your love cave.<eos> I promise, you'll only like it a lot.
And no flash photography.<eos> Just be respectful. Okay.<eos> So simple.<eos> Maybe I should learn how to read.<eos> You brought her favorite.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry about last night.<eos> I was drunk and insensitive and rude, and you did not deserve that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I know how much she meant to you.
Well, why are we even talking about this?<eos> Piscatella's not the kind of man who slips on marbles.<eos> On ice.<eos> They slip on ice in the movie.<eos> We need to kick him in the back of the neck.<eos> Maybe we can do that paint can thing.<eos> Or the tarantula.<eos> Like you can jump high enough to get him on the neck.<eos> - I would knock him down first. - With what?<eos> I'll tell you with what.
I'm the one that gets the updates.<eos> You care so much, come in here and ask Doctor Velasco yourself.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> But right now, it's not that easy, right?<eos> Because I'm in prison, okay?<eos> But you better believe that when I get out, you are the first bitch that I am gonna go find.<eos> Hold... hold for a moment.<eos> I'll see if he's available.<eos> Yo, you might be better off with, uh, an anti-psychotic.<eos> If you give me the keys, I'll get you some.

Just 'cause you dressed up like a trashy Audrey Hepburn doesn't mean you can be such a bitch, okay?<eos> I am feeling very sensitive right now.<eos> How about you go find somebody else to be your warm fuzzy place, okay?

- Mmm.<eos> - We need some education, some rehabilitation, but we ain't getting nothing 'cause they want us to fail out here.<eos> Those prison companies? They want us to keep going back in because we the easiest product for them to restock.<eos> No, no.<eos> Ms. Diaz is right.<eos> Those private prisons are awful.<eos> Uh, the food, guards always frisking us up...<eos> Oh, please, ain't no guard ever touched you.<eos> 'Cept for that doughy one that smelled like weed.<eos> But you liked that, didn't you?
Because from where I'm standing, you sure don't look like it.<eos> Gloria, what was I supposed to do?<eos> The gun fell in front of me.<eos> Everybody was screaming.<eos> He was acting like a fucking prick. Oh!<eos> So he made you shoot him?<eos> No, it was those bitches. No, it was your mother and those bitches.<eos> She made you do it, and everything else that's fucked up in your life. Huh? Right?<eos> Where were you when all this was going on, huh?<eos> That gun may have landed in front of you, but it was your finger that pulled that damn trigger.
She made you do it, and everything else that's fucked up in your life. Huh? Right?<eos> Where were you when all this was going on, huh?<eos> That gun may have landed in front of you, but it was your finger that pulled that damn trigger.<eos> You did that.<eos> You did that!<eos> Look...<eos> And I know that sometimes our only choices are between shitty and shittier, but whatever we end up doing, we gotta own it.<eos> Somehow find grace in it.<eos> Come on.<eos> The bodega was out of the wing ones, so I got you the extra-long.

- He asked about you.<eos> That's not embarrassing at all.<eos> - Why? You like him or something?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause I think he got a little crush on you.<eos> We're friends. I known him forever.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Well, your friend got manners.<eos> Introducing himself to your mother?<eos> That's the kind of guy that's gonna open car doors for you and shit.
- Yo, we ain't fucking around.<eos> - Neither are we.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - What's going on, Pipes?<eos> Pulling the lever.<eos> Diaz needs to turn herself in. Or riot amnesty is off the table for everyone.<eos> We're sacrificing the one for the many.<eos> And what's the difference between her and me?<eos> You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Diaz needs to turn herself in. Or riot amnesty is off the table for everyone.<eos> We're sacrificing the one for the many.<eos> And what's the difference between her and me?<eos> You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Everything, apparently.<eos> Where'd you get a goddamn gun?<eos> I don't know. He brought it. That Humps guy.<eos> You're humping the guard?<eos> What is with you and guard fucking? Jesus! No.
But then... I shot him.<eos> I didn't think it was a big deal.<eos> It was just his leg.<eos> He was fine at first.<eos> But I don't know what happened.<eos> Now he can't move or talk.<eos> Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> How is that good?<eos> Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna tell them he brought the gun in before and put that shit in your mouth and threatened to blow your head off because he's a fucking psycho.
Help! Help!<eos> No.<eos> Don't.<eos> Come on, you... you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I don't have to kick your ass either, but keep talkin'.<eos> No, don't do this!<eos> - Go.<eos> - Please!<eos> Hey, Boo.<eos> - Let me talk to you.
Let me tell you something, tile is not like grass.<eos> It splashed back up on me.<eos> Ew, gross.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just have, like, weird associations with pee.<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look, kid, I know. I'm sorry you're having some issues.<eos> But you're just gonna need to find somebody else<eos> - to help you unravel this drama, okay? - What?
- Pennsatucky!<eos> - Get off her!<eos> - Pennsatucky!<eos> Maybe now you'll listen!<eos> You can't rehab a monster!<eos> She needs to be locked up for everyone's safety! No, I don't!<eos> It's not even fair!<eos> You guys fucking terrorize me every single day!<eos> I can't even take a piss? I told you!<eos> I told you you would find me.
We sent him away. Mission aborted.<eos> And maybe that point just isn't connecting because you just deep fried your amygdala.<eos> Look, even if girlfriend, I mean, comes strutting in here, he's what, about seven feet tall, dressed like an extra from Cruising. I'm pretty sure I'll spot him walking down the hallway.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here, have a little drink.<eos> Now, you should probably expect some, uh, primo headaches, a little bit of short-term memory loss, even a soupçon of hellish hallucinations.<eos> Let's try and sleep through some of that?<eos> Oh, I feel like my hot flashes are having hot flashes.<eos> That, too.<eos> I'm gonna make you a cold compress, because I am all in on this whole role-reversal thing we got going here, okay?
But we love that you were thinking of us.<eos> I'm gonna grab the ice. I'll be right back.<eos> No, no, don't leave me.<eos> Don't leave me alone!<eos> I'm not. Uh, nobody's ever really alone, Red.<eos> We got a lifetime of regrets to keep us company.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> I discovered a whole new muscle in my back I hadn't pulled yet.<eos> You?
Where did you get those?<eos> -A boy from the university.<eos> He said they make the ass of the wearer look like the Charlie's Angels.<eos> -Where can you even wear them?<eos> -A party. Tonight.<eos> He invited me.<eos> -And he said I could bring friends.<eos> -I don't like parties.<eos> Soggy herring and accordion music.<eos> Nervous men asking you to dance.
The fuck is Irkutsk, anyway?<eos> All right, excuse me.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Tryin' to live my best self, here.<eos> Is that you, hot girl?<eos> Look, hey, man, I'm really sorry I don't remember your, you know, exact name after we did the sex and all.<eos> I just want you to know that, uh... that does not mean I don't hold you in a very high...<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You need to sacrifice a few more for the good of the many.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that it worked.
-Well, we're still negotiating.<eos> -So the end justified the means.<eos> Look, I know how I am with a cause.<eos> I know that I'm like a dog with a bone.<eos> Or an angry dragon on its lonely mountain of gold.<eos> That, too.<eos> I know she freaks you out...<eos> Worthy Cause Piper.<eos> And she freaks me out, too.<eos> -But you're not sorry.
She's gone!<eos> -Who?<eos> -Nicky!<eos> You haven't seen her, have you?<eos> Well, no, we're going through this fun phase where she can't stand to look at me.<eos> I'm probably the wrong person to ask.<eos> Into thin air.<eos> -Like Nadezhda! -Ooh!<eos> God bless you.<eos> Why don't you care?
The work. You don't hate it?<eos> I don't have a choice, so I make the best.<eos> No.<eos> Stop that.<eos> Don't make the mistake of committing yourself to the old ways.<eos> You need to be ready for when the world changes.<eos> It happens fast.<eos> It's happening now!<eos> And you're going to show me these new ways?<eos> I'm going to show you everything.
No! -Angie, you suck at this!<eos> - No, I wasn't done! - Give it to me!<eos> Peace out.<eos> I see you!<eos> Hello?<eos> I said I...<eos> Come on, bitch, pick up!<eos> -You are religious?<eos> -Church of Satan, ma'am.<eos> Look. Uh, man, I should've told you there was a riot.
-What?<eos> Yo, this bitch lied to me twice!<eos> Aleida, calm down.<eos> I'm staring at my daughter in handcuffs right now!<eos> I ask you to look out for her and the next thing I know she's shooting somebody and confesses?<eos> Her life is over!<eos> You've been fucking up her life for 23 years, querida.<eos> You think that I was gonna undo that in a week?<eos> All you had to do was be an equally bad mother, not a hundred fuckin' thousand times worse.<eos> Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... I'll fuckin' cut your tit off.

I would love to stay here and get yelled at, but I got my own kids to worry about.<eos> Well, I'll be prayin' for them little bastards, 'cause they don't stand a chance with you as their mother.
Shouldn't we go where it's more populated?<eos> Is this the teen-scream scenario? Hmm?<eos> Me in the letterman jacket, you with the pom-poms.<eos> Okay, babe, whatever gets your knickers wet.<eos> No, I'm really serious.<eos> Don't you think it's spooky?<eos> -I heard people are going missing. -Mmm.<eos> Maybe the SWAT team is plucking us out, one at a time.<eos> - They can do that? - Aw...<eos> Don't you worry about that, babe.
I think there's a pattern, see?<eos> Norma, missing.<eos> -Oh, boy.<eos> -Frieda, missing.<eos> Gina, missing.<eos> Yoga, and now Blanca and Nicky--<eos> -Let me guess-- -Missing.<eos> I didn't know that Piscatella paid such close attention to your social circles.<eos> This is serious, damn it!<eos> Red, I wanna believe you, but you're making it impossible.
So Nicky didn't complete a task set out before her?<eos> Like, shocker.<eos> She's probably with that new girl.<eos> Somehow she found a sexy loner we've never seen in prison before to hook up with.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> Red, what's the, uh... What's the frying pan for?<eos> For hitting him with.<eos> Okay.<eos> You need to get some rest, okay?<eos> And when we see Nicky, we're going to have her kick that girl out of bed and come find you.
Are you gonna tell me what they are or you gonna surprise me?<eos> Now...<eos> Grace?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> This is wrong on so many levels.<eos> If you're gonna contour your blush, you gotta blend better.<eos> I'm not comfortable.<eos> Oh, you poor thing.<eos> Who did this to you?
-If we were married...<eos> So that's your plan.<eos> Listen.<eos> We don't have to be together in that way.<eos> It can all be for show.<eos> I know you think... I'm not man enough for you.<eos> - Dmitri--<eos> - When we get to America... you can go your own way if you want.<eos> I can?<eos> But maybe... maybe I will show you I'm not a gerbil.
-Where is he?<eos> -Off playing Jason from Friday the 13th. Or Jason's mom, technically.<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Let's just say it's a good thing I do yoga.<eos> Wait, I never do that shit.<eos> -Yoga. Where is she?<eos> -I don't know. -And Gina and Norma?<eos> Shit! -I don't know!<eos> Oh, what? I mean, this isn't enough, uh, distressed damsels for you?

I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Hands are too clean for a forger. She'd be inky.<eos> Or maybe she's just such a good forger, she went ahead and forged herself.<eos> What?<eos> How's she so fast?<eos> Adrenaline and lies.<eos> Yeah, you fully hiding, ain't you?<eos> Fuckin' thermometer planet.<eos> Come on!<eos> One more round.<eos> I ain't playing with you no more.
You've captured six women in a closet.<eos> Such a big strong man.<eos> But what about all those other little chickens out there, huh?<eos> Ready to pluck your feathers and rip off your balls?<eos> There are 20 women guarding the hostages.<eos> Three hundred more are strolling around the hallways, hungry and bored, looking for some action.<eos> What exactly were you thinking you'd do?<eos> You think I'm here to rescue the hostages?<eos> I've taught my guards to fend for themselves.<eos> I'm here for you, Reznikov.
Even rioters need to sleep sometimes.<eos> Pee.<eos> Now I'm free, free to pee.<eos> Ghosts are not real.<eos> Ghosts are not real!<eos> And clowns can't help it!<eos> They're just doing their job!<eos> My face is wrong.<eos> My face... is under... the wrong.<eos> Love the face God gave you, Suzanne.
-None taken.<eos> The man was prepared.<eos> Who's Bone?<eos> Stop mucking around.<eos> Bone a big fella?<eos> Bone is short for Skin and Bones.<eos> He was a kid who volunteered here back in the '70s.<eos> He ran the swim fitness program.<eos> But then they drained the pool, and that was that.<eos> How come he sent you a postcard from Guatemala in '82?
I wouldn't mind a roll in the hay with this one.<eos> Okay!<eos> Enough!<eos> Everybody, sit down!<eos> No more touching what ain't yours to touch.<eos> Bunch of careless stoners!<eos> You are guests in my home!<eos> Don't make me trigger the booby traps.<eos> You're pathetic. You know that?<eos> What happened to you that you're like this, Piscatella? Huh?
What's the original narcissistic wound?<eos> Nicky, stop.<eos> He doesn't speak human.<eos> Now that is right, Stalina.<eos> Because I discovered a long time ago that actions speak a whole lot louder than words.<eos> Inmates will always try to cheat, manipulate or deceive you.<eos> There must be consequences.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Fucking stop it!<eos> The fuck is wrong with you?
I got "blank, blank, N, T, blank."<eos> I got "S, A, blank..."<eos> Santa!<eos> -"Dancer," like the reindeer!<eos> -Nice.<eos> Nice.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> You seem down.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> Nothing that matters to you is stupid.
It's stupid.<eos> Nothing that matters to you is stupid.<eos> All right, it's not a big deal.<eos> Rosado and his merry band of bitches swiped my radio yesterday.<eos> I'll kill them.<eos> No, seriously, should I kill them?<eos> -No.<eos> Come on. -I'll kill them.<eos> I will kill them for you.<eos> I brought you something. -What?
No, seriously, should I kill them?<eos> -No.<eos> Come on. -I'll kill them.<eos> I will kill them for you.<eos> I brought you something. -What?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> What, Christmas is coming early this year, huh?<eos> It's just a little stocking stuffer.<eos> It's, uh... some chocolate for my chocolate.<eos> It's always candy with you, huh?
-Yeah.<eos> I think that's when she gave up trying to fix me.<eos> Thank God she did, huh?<eos> Look, you're perfect like God made you.<eos> -You hear me?<eos> -Really?<eos> I hate this.<eos> Having to hide.<eos> Having to be apart.<eos> Uh, let me show you something.
Oh! Or the forger lady!<eos> Like, someone with a useful skill.<eos> Well, what about Gandhi over there?<eos> - I'll have the healing touch.<eos> - Too brown.<eos> But a man's finger could be nice.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You're comin' with us.<eos> I don't know you, but whatever's going on over there, it sounds rough, and, um...

There is only so much taxpayer money available.<eos> You want to tell the kids at PS whatever that their music program's been canceled because a bunch of inmates need to cage their rage with arts and crafts?<eos> This is not about resource allocation, it's about priorities.<eos> Is the goal to rehabilitate these women, or line the pockets of MCC's shareholders?<eos> Who gives a shit about MCC?<eos> You are arguing with the wrong bogeyman.<eos> I represent the governor, and his priority is that we end this ASAP.<eos> Well, it's my priority to make sure we do right by these women.<eos> And why do you think I'm here, Joe?<eos> To have a threesome with you and that lunatic who ran in here before?
Real nice.<eos> You woke us up for this shit?<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> Yeah, this is not a healthy relationship right here.<eos> I think it's kinda hot, actually.<eos> So... angry and sweaty.<eos> Like they wanna fuck each other to death.<eos> We ain't never gonna get to Bayley with this shit.<eos> Not a single new demand has even been agreed on since they started scrapping'.<eos> Man, I keep tellin' you, T, white people mess up everything. Twerking, cornrows, Africa... the White House.
- Those stairs are a doozy.<eos> - I will teach you.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Shut up!<eos> -Shh.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Nice Indian man?<eos> You should be sleeping, probably.<eos> Sleeping is very healing.<eos> And when you wake up, you'll be feeling better and they'll bring you soup and pills.
Grace?<eos> Graystee?<eos> Aw, no, no, no!<eos> What the fuck is goin' on?<eos> -The issue is he is not breathing.<eos> -What?<eos> And the body needs oxygen, or else the cells curl up like old leaves.<eos> But don't jump in the leaves, because the pile might have ticks and spiders in them.<eos> Okay.<eos> What happened to you, Suzanne?
Yes... I am.<eos> It's like they taught me at Jesus camp for little homos.<eos> "The righteous will rejoice when he sees vengeance.<eos> He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked."<eos> Oh, I bet your feet are disgusting.<eos> You see, this is the thing about female prisoners.<eos> Men understand violence.<eos> They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.
Come on, Desi.<eos> We take 'em out when they start screaming.<eos> I don't hear anything, do you?<eos> He saw me.<eos> I know you're down here, inmate.<eos> Oh, please, make this hard for me.<eos> It'll give me the pleasure of wrecking you later.<eos> Oh, you're gonna have to do better than a pushpin.<eos> Teamwork!<eos> Ah, how do you like that, Fruit Brute?
This must be what the Maasai tribesmen feel like after they've speared an elephant.<eos> Except white men aren't exactly an endangered species, and this animal is going to wake up.<eos> Ah, he'll be out for a couple hours.<eos> - Where the hell are we?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - What do we do when he wakes up?<eos> - We torture him into a confession.<eos> Don't you think that we have all already suffered enough in service of your revenge scheme, Red?<eos> Did he do that to you?
That's some weird shit, Ms. Fig.<eos> For real, though.<eos> I mean, just let the girl...<eos> Taystee... it has been 12 hours and we haven't gotten anywhere.<eos> - Your point was?<eos> - Healthcare.<eos> Do you know what happens when we get sick?<eos> A CO decides if it's essential or not.<eos> A man who don't know or care nothin' about us tells us if we sick enough to go to the doctor.<eos> And if it ain't essential, you gotta lie in your bunk, hoping that your fever don't get too high, or you gotta find a friend who can afford Tylenol from commissary.
Ugh, that's disgusting.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Don't worry, I got it.<eos> You, long pants.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Aren't all pants long?<eos> - Didn't you hear me?<eos> I said let's go.<eos> - I don't understand, I was...<eos> Hey, did I say you could talk?
It was, like, green or blue or something?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> I made Benny say it was his fault.<eos> I told him I'd take his Spider-Man if he told you.<eos> You know what I remember?<eos> At the pool...<eos> You must have been nine or ten.<eos> Benny sat and watched you and your friends dive off the diving board all day.<eos> He wouldn't even swim.<eos> Just watched you.
All right, what you wanna do is keep 'em on their toes.<eos> Yeah, you gotta mess with their brains.<eos> - Why is your face all red?<eos> - Oh, I slapped her to stay awake.<eos> But we good now. We got something better.<eos> Yo, check this out.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> All right, so, see this?<eos> You take your coffee, then you take your card.<eos> And you gonna line that bitch up, right?
Yo, let me do a line.<eos> Come on, come on. Fuck it.<eos> Grab that shit.<eos> Watch this shit.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> The more it hurts, the doper the... the high, right?<eos> - Totally.<eos> - I think y'all crazy.<eos> Excedrin work just as good and it don't hurt.<eos> - The pain lets you know that you're alive.
So you tell me what's more important... one girl who can't handle not getting her breakfast on time or the rest of us who is in here tryin' to survive every day?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Live on the scene here at Litchfield Prison.<eos> No new activity in the last few hours. We are still awaiting any...<eos> - Hey, I was watching that!<eos> - And I was turning it off.<eos> You better get your booty to the bus stop.<eos> If the bus leaves without you, you got a long walk.<eos> And I'm not writing no late-excuse letters to the school.<eos> It's like you don't even care about her.
- Who?<eos> - See?<eos> Cindy.<eos> My sister?<eos> Your daughter.<eos> She's in that jail that's going off, and you're pretending she don't even exist.<eos> I care about her very much.<eos> - You're not worried?<eos> - Honey...<eos> I didn't tell you before because I didn't want you worrying, but Cindy's not in that place.
I really liked that suit.<eos> Yeah, well, you should see me in suspenders.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Oh! - What?<eos> How can I put this politely?<eos> Have you been rolling around in a pile of horse shit since I've been away?<eos> I had to hide in the Poo to escape a Mexican mongoloid!<eos> Wow, I don't even know which part of that is the most offensive.<eos> Impressive.<eos> How about I get you a nice hot shower?
- Gloria.<eos> They're taking him into surgery.<eos> If you want to talk to him first, I thought... maybe he can hear you.<eos> Yes, yes, eh...<eos> - You'll hold the phone to him?<eos> - Yes. Go ahead.<eos> I know you don't like it when I call you that, but you're still my baby.<eos> And everything's gonna be okay, you hear me?<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> The doctors, they're gonna take care of you, and I'mma be there real soon.

Until I get there, I need you to...<eos> I need you to fight.<eos> You put up those fists and you fight.<eos> I ain't never gonna tell you that again after this, but today... today...<eos> Today, you fight.<eos> You fight like hell!<eos> I love you. I love you, Benjamin Mendoza.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you more than my life.<eos> I would trade places with you. I would trade places with you if I could.
Sneak in here undercover for the outside, you fucking mole!<eos> No, I really didn't do that.<eos> And the only thing you haven't lied about is being a cunt.<eos> - Please. This is a huge misunderstanding.<eos> - Really? 'Cause I'm pretty clear about Caputo's dick in your mouth.<eos> No, I... have a narrow jaw.<eos> That's... not the point.<eos> Please, just...<eos> Okay.<eos> If you just listen to me, I promise you, I promise you, I will tell you the truth, okay?
Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.<eos> - For me?<eos> Please, don't do your thing right now.<eos> Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.<eos> I wanna go see if all this is ending so that I can get you some real help.
Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.<eos> I wanna go see if all this is ending so that I can get you some real help.<eos> And I also wanna see if all this stuff we've done has been for nothing.<eos> You wanna know if me getting my ulna snapped by Godzilla helped your little cause?<eos> Alex... I know that you're hurting.<eos> What he did...<eos> I wanted to die... just sitting there, not being able to help you.
He cheated on me.<eos> And I'm, like, way above his pay grade.<eos> I mean, I... I thought that he was headed up MCC's corporate ladder, but clearly, the man simply does not have what it takes.<eos> And if I'm going to be perfectly honest... there is such a thing as too big, you know?<eos> I'm kind of tight down there, so...<eos> - Your poor, counterfeit cunt.<eos> - I'm sorry, Boo. I am.<eos> But I was too afraid to tell you.<eos> You know that there were parts of Von Barlow that were real, that were me.<eos> You know, I... I don't have a problem with the cunt you created.
Oh... You're gonna PayPal me, pronto.<eos> Well, it looks like I am down to 3%, and I did not bring my charger.<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> let's go looking.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Hey, nurse?<eos> You still open?<eos> - Do you really wanna keep playing that?<eos> - What happened to you?
- Hey, nurse?<eos> You still open?<eos> - Do you really wanna keep playing that?<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> I got mauled by a bear.<eos> - You take some of Red's vitamins?<eos> - Oh, I wish.<eos> Any drugs of any kind would have really helped with the tsunami of fucked-up that was last night.<eos> But, sadly... still sober.<eos> You gonna tell me what happened, or you... you gonna keep stalling with all your words?

When you do the same thing over, over, over, over again, expecting different results.<eos> Well, I think it was actually Einstein, but proceed.<eos> See, they look positive to me.<eos> I mean, I know some of the lines is blurrier than the others, but I think I'm so fucking crazy, I'm seeing shit now.<eos> Babe... you're actually pregnant.<eos> I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh, unless you put these in someone else's piss...<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> - Well... okay, you're with child here.<eos> No, that's not... that's not... possible, because you said...<eos> I didn't believe you.
It's not exactly the stuff of masturbatory fantasies.<eos> But, uh...<eos> Hey, I'm happy for you.<eos> This is what you always wanted, right?<eos> Vinnie...<eos> Vinnie doesn't want to have anything to do with this.<eos> He won't even answer my calls.<eos> Fuck Vinnie.<eos> All right? We'll make it work.<eos> I will help you.
Perfect for my CPAP.<eos> I wonder how long it'll take 'em to wrap this all up.<eos> Hadn't really planned on so many... visitors.<eos> I've been called much worse and stayed much longer.<eos> Oh, Frieda.<eos> Look at us!<eos> He was so sure he had the win.<eos> Fool.<eos> Don't "us" me.<eos> I helped you out, but the game I play is defense.
Fool.<eos> Don't "us" me.<eos> I helped you out, but the game I play is defense.<eos> - What happens to him outside...<eos> - Outside?<eos> No.<eos> I can't let them take him out without a victory lap.<eos> Them taking him out is your victory lap, Red.<eos> He'll be prosecuted.<eos> - When is it enough for you?
Mark it, Norma.<eos> You could ask for help.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you have some magical yoga poses that will help me?<eos> Those tend to work better when your bones are intact.<eos> Why'd you tell Chapman to go?<eos> Because she didn't want to stay.<eos> Piper always needs to have a cause.<eos> Or some other escape hatch.<eos> Seemed to me like she wanted to help you.
Shut Litchfield down!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mom!<eos> Piper, honey, is that you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> My child is trapped in a prison riot.<eos> One shows up for those sorts of things.<eos> Please tell me you're not leading it.<eos> I guess I should be flattered that you think of me as a leader.<eos> Honey, are you okay?
I was a freshman in college and we had this devastating hurricane.<eos> I mean, half of the university was under water, and... several of us were trapped in a dorm.<eos> Thought I would die from the heat, waiting for the life rafts to come.<eos> And then I saw your father paddling across the lawn... in a rowboat.<eos> He knew I was in there, so he volunteered to bring us some food.<eos> Cans of corn.<eos> That's what he brought me.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Yes. It's nice that you want to be there for Alex.<eos> I always thought you would be the girl in the relationship though, but I suppose there was always a healthy dose of testosterone in you.
- But we can't go out there.<eos> If those bitches find out we lost the hostages, they'll kill us.<eos> Or shove us into some crap box, like they've been doing.<eos> Or like we've been doing.<eos> Don't make me question the mixed morality of what we been doing here.<eos> Come on.<eos> You think about what you're gonna say in the press conference?<eos> 'Cause we should be complementary but not redundant.<eos> You think they'll ask me to say something?<eos> They brought you a suit.
Just wait here.<eos> - I'm gonna go get Fig back.<eos> - Back from where?<eos> I thought you might wanna go back to your sexy librarian look.<eos> 'Cause that's why I wear them.<eos> It has nothing to do with the having-to-see thing.<eos> Right, there's that too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to listen to me for a second.<eos> I think that this thing might be over and I'm gonna be able to get you some real help soon, but first... I want you to have this.
They need Skaikru medicine.<eos> Move.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Nyko.<eos> What if it's a Grounder attack like they did with Murphy?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The sickness.<eos> We lost more than 40 on the way.<eos> Luna?<eos> Please don't turn us away because of what I did to you.
- You should be.<eos> One kill to prevent thousands, that's good politics.<eos> You said there'd be food here.<eos> There should be.<eos> These woods have always been good to me.<eos> Now there's not even bugs.<eos> Well, fortunately, I'm not hungry enough for that to be upsetting yet.<eos> I actually kind of miss Polis.<eos> They had this drink there... sweet, made out of sheep's milk.<eos> Ontari gave this to you?

Then let's not.<eos> I didn't have a choice, ok?<eos> Emori...<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go to Arkadia.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm a better thief than I am a hunter.<eos> - I'll come with you.
All supply runs go through me, and shouldn't you be working on the patch to Sector 5?<eos> A patch for a ship that can only save a hundred people?<eos> Why are you surprised?<eos> I am an engineer.<eos> We have no way to generate water.<eos> The harder number is 400.<eos> Can you really sentence 400 more of our own people to death?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> What if you do?<eos> What if I told you there might be a fallout shelter less than a day's drive from here, a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands?
Till something better comes along, yeah.<eos> Close the gate.<eos> All right.<eos> Start it up.<eos> Already told Jackson, we can't spare anything, especially not antiradiation meds.<eos> We're talking about 7 doses.<eos> That's a quarter of our supply, Abby, a supply that has to last us for 5 years on an irradiated planet.<eos> We're gonna need every one of those pills, and you know it.<eos> You're right.<eos> We put you in charge of the supplies.
I did.<eos> Hey, no, no, no.<eos> What's the point?<eos> A.L.I.E. used tech to control us.<eos> No one will ever take over our minds again.<eos> So you're the new Flamekeeper.<eos> This is a sacred space.<eos> Leave before you get hurt.<eos> Give me the Flame.<eos> It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king.
And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.<eos> And I thought, "Great." But I'm here now.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I should take you home.<eos> No.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'll take a cab.<eos> - I'm taking you home.<eos> What is going on with you?
In my home state?<eos> Well, you and LeAnn better get over here right now.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> There's something wrong with the numbers in the precincts that we're getting from this morning.<eos> They don't match up.<eos> It's never happened before in South Carolina.<eos> - Well, you have nothing to say about that?<eos> - Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.<eos> Oh, you don't believe that for a second.<eos> I can't win with you.
- And what are you thinking about now?<eos> I'm all through thinking, baby.<eos> - I just came to say goodbye.<eos> - Goodbye?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You're the one that's going, baby.<eos> Not me. I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.<eos> Suppose you stop being fancy.<eos> Let's have it, whatever it is.<eos> All right, I'll tell you.
We all had to surrender after that.<eos> And they rounded us up, chucked us into trucks and took our IDs.<eos> And then we were ambushed on the road.<eos> So, our people could still be there, where the trucks were hit.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Not a smart idea.<eos> They've all disappeared.<eos> You don't know that for sure, Aunty.<eos> Blair, he can help us.<eos> He did good by you, Koen.
And blankets.<eos> It's freezing in this place.<eos> You can't risk heading out into the city, but I can.<eos> Give us a list.<eos> We'll get going.<eos> You're not up to it, Aunty.<eos> I'm not sitting around here using up supplies these buggers need.<eos> Besides, Nerida and Alinta are out there.<eos> I'll bring you whatever I can find.<eos> How you going, Aunty?
But things are about to change.<eos> You're special, Boondee.<eos> You will be the Hairy who changes the lives of your people, and I will be the man who makes that happen.<eos> Then you will respect me.<eos> Get me another meeting with Frith.<eos> Hello, little subbie.<eos> Come out to play.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want to see what you're made of, subbie.
- Let her go!<eos> - No!<eos> Do it!<eos> - She's seen too much.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That we should kill her?<eos> Or do you wanna rip off another finger?<eos> I know he's a Hairy, but what about you?
Ebola?<eos> If that doesn't work, I've got one more trick up my sleeve.<eos> Make a start on it.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - It feels good.<eos> - You sure?<eos> I might stay the whole afternoon, actually.<eos> - I have a lot of things that I need to...<eos> - Charlotte. Jarrod, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to ask you exactly that question.
I'll be right back.<eos> - It feels good.<eos> - You sure?<eos> I might stay the whole afternoon, actually.<eos> - I have a lot of things that I need to...<eos> - Charlotte. Jarrod, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to ask you exactly that question.<eos> - We agreed you'd stay home.<eos> - Well, I changed my mind.<eos> It's not only up to you.
Slade.<eos> Slade, please!<eos> Slade.<eos> Slade!<eos> She has to come with us.<eos> We don't know anything about her.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Koen West.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
Look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> Hairy!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Come up!<eos> You must submit to the CA!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, - What happened?<eos> It's okay, it's okay, you're fine.<eos> You're fine.
Nobody's run anything.<eos> I checked your vitals and hid you away in here.<eos> Kept everybody else at arm's length... including your husband.<eos> I can't go home.<eos> Well, there's no rush.<eos> No, I mean I can't go home.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> Charlotte, can we talk?<eos> Give me a chance to apologize.<eos> I hate arguing with you.
We're prepped for fetal extraction.<eos> And this group is being set up to mimic a subhuman womb.<eos> The fetus will continue to develop normally?<eos> Exactly as if it were in a healthy mother.<eos> No danger to the mother with this procedure?<eos> Any surgical intervention carries a certain risk, but the risk is not significantly greater here.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Ah, you hear that, boy?<eos> It's killing me.<eos> Means the past is reaching out to you, trying to show you something.
- I know Waruu.<eos> He knows your people.<eos> He'll make it impossible.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> - He's my son.<eos> - Koen and Waruu?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Does that make you feel better?<eos> It doesn't help me at all.<eos> I'm just letting you know what you're up against.
Yes... the mother who shaped those two sons.<eos> I'm not proud.<eos> You're human.<eos> You can drive me to Bennelong House.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> I am not my son.<eos> Take me to Bennelong House!<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Why should I trust you?
Alinta.<eos> Mum!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's CA.<eos> Grab your stuff.<eos> Culture is difficult to control, and being a Cleverman forces you to be consumed by it.<eos> How's that?<eos> Ah, you listen to the voices in your head.<eos> Some people think that you're crazy.<eos> The more they say it, the more you believe it, and you find yourself in a dark place where no words can help you.
They prefer to pretend that I'm not here.<eos> You are here.<eos> If you give me your keys and a list of things you need, I'm happy to go get them.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I better go.<eos> You're really scared of him, aren't you?<eos> What's happened?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Might make you less scared if you talk about it.
It's fine.<eos> I better go.<eos> You're really scared of him, aren't you?<eos> What's happened?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Might make you less scared if you talk about it.<eos> Why are you sitting here in the dark?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Not really.<eos> What can I get you?
How many people know what I'm carrying?<eos> No one else knows, just you, me, and our doctor.<eos> - You can trust him, I promise you.<eos> - Trust?<eos> You did this to your wife!<eos> So that we can raise our child together.<eos> We can be an example to those that come after.<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> - What, after it was born?<eos> - I wanted to tell you, believe me, but you were so happy.
How long is the term?<eos> Do you know?<eos> Do you know any of that?<eos> Or is it just cross your fingers and hope for the best?<eos> And you say that you love me!<eos> I wouldn't do this unless I was sure it was safe.<eos> - I'd never hurt you.<eos> - You're experimenting on me!<eos> You're risking my life!<eos> You'll be safe, I promise you.
And get that footage off the CA system.<eos> We don't want them anywhere near this.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> Please, I need...<eos> I need food and water.<eos> I'm worried about my baby.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> - We'll get you some water.
Go!<eos> Run!<eos> Stop!<eos> Step back. You're under arrest.<eos> You bastard.<eos> Latani!<eos> - Latani!<eos> - Latani!<eos> You've been with Jimmy. Yeah.<eos> The old bastard showed you the accident, didn't he?
I'm sorry.<eos> - We gotta let 'em go.<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> Let 'em go.<eos> Stand down, Dolan.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> - Subbies aren't kids.<eos> - She'll be right.<eos> - They're animals. - Hey?<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
Let 'em go.<eos> Stand down, Dolan.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> - Subbies aren't kids.<eos> - She'll be right.<eos> - They're animals. - Hey?<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> - Are you okay? You sure?<eos> The woman...<eos> She's the one I told you about.
- Something's broken.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I can't heal right anymore.<eos> This is Waruu, isn't it?<eos> I messed both you boys up.<eos> I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.<eos> I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.<eos> Aunty...<eos> It's alright, boy.<eos> I don't expect anything from you.
Things are as they should be.<eos> I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.<eos> Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.<eos> That was nice of him, wasn't it?<eos> You're the worst kind of subbie.<eos> You know that?<eos> Not sticking with your own kind.<eos> Preying on weak, innocent humans.<eos> Selling them your sob story.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.
You know that?<eos> Not sticking with your own kind.<eos> Preying on weak, innocent humans.<eos> Selling them your sob story.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, we're going to have a little fun, then.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Not if you were the last thing on earth, darling.<eos> You're probably crawling with lice.
What's that?<eos> What's that?<eos> You're casting a spell or something?<eos> You're going to need a lot more than that.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> One...<eos> Two...<eos> Three...<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> You alright?
If you've hurt her in any way...<eos> She's unharmed.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> And all of her details now, including her crime, - are in the system.<eos> - I am the system.<eos> Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.<eos> I'll deal with the charges later.<eos> Now, where is she?<eos> I'll take you.<eos> Thank God you're alright.
And I could see your mother had gone into labour.<eos> I grabbed her arm and I pulled...<eos> I pulled her from the wreckage.<eos> There was... so much blood.<eos> And you were coming.<eos> I could see that.<eos> Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.<eos> I didn't have to do much.<eos> I always thought it was my fault that she died.<eos> This got nothing to do with you, boy.
This got nothing to do with you, boy.<eos> I brought all this on.<eos> I guess we're even, then.<eos> Enough yapping.<eos> We gotta get you out of them clothes.<eos> You're a leader, boy.<eos> You're going to start looking like one.<eos> Like Uncle Jimmy...<eos> mad hair and no shoes.<eos> Do you like it?
Let you be the face of the initiative?<eos> After all that work you did in the Zone, Waruu.<eos> What good did that do?<eos> The initiative's the only way I could see to save the Hairies.<eos> Well, he isn't going...<eos> He wasn't going to save anyone.<eos> Is your child a Hairy?<eos> Makes sense.<eos> All the experimenting he's been doing.<eos> He didn't tell you, did he?
They'll stop us.<eos> I'll find your mother.<eos> And everyone else they locked up.<eos> You with me?<eos> Waruu!<eos> Waruu!<eos> You're alive.<eos> He's not here.<eos> - Where's your mum?<eos> - I'll show you.
You left us for dead.<eos> They were gonna kill us.<eos> And you just left.<eos> You're right.<eos> Is this where you say you're going to make it all better?<eos> Nah, I can't make it better.<eos> Truth is, I screwed up.<eos> But I found you, and I got them to release you to me, and now you're here.<eos> So when you're done being angry with me, you might want to think about what happens next.<eos> - That tag hurting you, bub?
You know that, don't you?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> - Confirm, dispatch.<eos> - No activity.<eos> East entrance is clear.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Going to have to buy you some pyjamas. Guess so.
- You with me?<eos> - No.<eos> We're Bindawu.<eos> This is our land.<eos> And we will have it back.<eos> Without skins.<eos> Killing more people won't change anything.<eos> We fight now.<eos> We fight for sovereignty.<eos> That won't get you anything but bloodshed.
They can't fight.<eos> - Their strength's been taken.<eos> - Hide. Like scared little children!<eos> I know a way out of here.<eos> I've used it before.<eos> - Then we run.<eos> - No-one's running.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> You're going to force them to stay?<eos> Kill your own people if they resist you?
The government needs to sit down and negotiate a treaty<eos> - with the Hairypeople.<eos> - Our people don't even have a treaty.<eos> What makes you think the Hairies will get one?<eos> I'll surrender myself to the government.<eos> You'll be the man that saved the city.<eos> Do you have the authority to make that deal?<eos> Or do I have to talk to your boss?<eos> I have the authority.<eos> Prove that I can trust you.
Someone I haven't seen.<eos> I want a girl who's real."<eos> So, I bring you in so they can see that they don't actually want the thing they think they want.<eos> Look...<eos> I do cast some experimental projects on the side, if you are open to that kind of thing.<eos> - What kind of thing?<eos> - Would you consider erotica?<eos> Porn?<eos> Like, in the Valley?<eos> Obviously, I'm not suggesting you go have sex on camera... unless that's something you're interested in.
- What?<eos> Debbie, boob.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, make it stop.<eos> I'm a fucking bovine mutant.<eos> - Maybe if I do this?<eos> - Here.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Did I tell you the casting director offered me porn?<eos> Uh... you?
- That's good.<eos> Did I tell you the casting director offered me porn?<eos> Uh... you?<eos> The girl who changes under her shirt?<eos> I don't do that anymore.<eos> Well...<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Obviously you shouldn't do porn.<eos> Unless it's, like, porn Shakespeare.<eos> Since you're such a nerd, you'd probably enjoy that.
I've called you like a million times to hang out.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Ruth, are you okay?<eos> It's just... little, stupid stuff.<eos> You know, like, don't know if I can pay my gas bill.<eos> I've got $83 in my bank account, and I'm waitressing all weekend.<eos> And I've eaten Cinnamon Toast Crunch for my last... six meals.<eos> But, hey, you know, I'm gonna do porn.<eos> So, things are looking up.<eos> Can I tell you something that I realized recently?
- Are there sides?<eos> - I didn't get any sides.<eos> This is how this is gonna go, all right?<eos> No more talking.<eos> Just sit there... and look at me and smile.<eos> Okay?<eos> Tell us what the hell we're doing here.<eos> - Hi, Cherry.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> - How you doing, baby?
All right.<eos> I'm feeling generous.<eos> Sophie's Choice.<eos> Why should I pick you and not her?<eos> Go.<eos> Girl fight.<eos> I'm a real actress.<eos> I will work my ass off, and I will make you believe me when I do stuff, even if it's just hair pulling.<eos> Well, that was a very nice pitch.<eos> What about you?
Haven't you learned anything from that sad fucking scene study class?<eos> Things don't just happen.<eos> People make choices.<eos> They want things, and then they go for them.<eos> Can we go somewhere and talk about this?<eos> - I don't wanna fucking talk to you. - I wanna... I wanna kick your ass.<eos> And then I never want to see you again.<eos> No!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'm not gonna fight you!
- That's never gonna happen.<eos> - No, ma'am. Her mother drinks every day.<eos> But you are laundering money.<eos> I'm helping people, uh, get their money back into the bank so they can pay their taxes.<eos> I got a job interview.<eos> - What?<eos> How? - Technology.<eos> - I'll give you a ride.<eos> - No, thanks, I can Uber.<eos> Wendy, you know, you can borrow the minivan for the groceries, and I can use Buddy's car out back.
Come July 3rd, every tourist on that lake's gonna be too drunk or lazy to leave their Grady-White.<eos> Black Cats and bottle rockets fetch double.<eos> Lady Fingers and inch-and-a-halfers go times three.<eos> And the Jack?<eos> Predilection for sour mash doesn't make a man stupid.<eos> Doesn't inspire confidence either.<eos> Point taken.<eos> You know, you're not your daddy.<eos> That's right.<eos> And if Daddy were here, he would have hung you out by your ball sack already.
This all sounds good.<eos> So, would you consider yourself a self-starter?<eos> Yeah, definitely a self-starter, sure.<eos> And I'd say I have leadership qualities, as well, but not to the point where I'd undermine the boss, or suck the air out of the room.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - Yeah. Could you start this weekend?<eos> Uh, could you excuse me for a moment, please?<eos> Oh, dude.<eos> On three, pop shove, right now.<eos> You just got hit by a girl!
- or failing a class. - I'm not saying that.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ, Marty.<eos> You can't just rationalize this away.<eos> I know what you think of me right now, and that's fine.<eos> But I love my kids, and I'm not gonna fucking lose them.<eos> Oh, come on. Where are you going?<eos> I've got shit to figure out, Wendy.<eos> The Blue Cat alone is not gonna cut it.<eos> What's up, ladies?<eos> Fuck happened to you?
Maybe, uh... after you, like, invest some of that money or whatever, I could maybe... borrow some to go someplace?<eos> Like a vacation?<eos> Florida or some shit like that?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Or for good, maybe.<eos> Well, where are you gonna go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well...<eos> Here's what I'll tell you... we're gonna get a lot more than 20 grand soon.
They're bobcats.<eos> Tell her, Russ.<eos> You'd be surprised, the market for exotic pets.<eos> Look online.<eos> They're all over this area.<eos> Make a hundred times what we've spent with the cats.<eos> Get the fuck over there.<eos> You see a pair of balls on either of them?<eos> Goddamn it, Boyd.<eos> I told you three times to check the undercarriages.
Not bad. Yeah. Sí.<eos> Sí, sí, sí.<eos> Uh-huh. Well, uh...<eos> Could you represent me in a deal?<eos> Um... Would that constitute a conflict of interest?<eos> No?<eos> Gracias, amigo.<eos> Uh, Charlotte, um, any chance you can throw on a windbreaker or something?<eos> - It's 94 degrees outside.<eos> - Yeah, well, if it's readers you're after, why don't you put some Shakespeare on your ass?
The deal was eight large, okay?<eos> This is feeling like a slow trickle.<eos> You know, it's not even, uh, Fourth of July.<eos> So... Ah, American Independence Day.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what else comes in July?<eos> - Uh, I don't, no.<eos> - My birthday.<eos> You wanna know what I want for my birthday?<eos> - I want a good night's sleep... a good shit... and several million clean from you.
This is a situation where the less you know, the better.<eos> And what's in it for me?<eos> If you wanna get ahead in business, it's questions like that, asked in that way, that you're gonna want to avoid.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Is that businesslike enough?<eos> Listen, I don't like to give extraneous details.<eos> There's a safe.<eos> And I need the contents.<eos> Anything else would be extraneous or counterproductive.<eos> However, I... I will admit that it is relevant to tell you that I'm offering you ten percent of what's inside.
However, I... I will admit that it is relevant to tell you that I'm offering you ten percent of what's inside.<eos> And what's on the inside?<eos> That's where we get into the extraneous again.<eos> It's at my risk.<eos> I want 80%.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> As your boss, I hope I'm not gonna have to negotiate every single time I ask you to do something.<eos> - Fifty.<eos> - How about I ask somebody else to do it?<eos> I'm gonna give you 25%.
I know.<eos> That's why it seemed so strange.<eos> Did you know that turkey vultures have a wingspan of over six feet?<eos> They feed on dead animals.<eos> The carcasses give off a chemical that the vultures can smell over a mile away.<eos> Jonah, are you saying... that you're dragging dead animals here to the house so you can study vultures?<eos> Yeah, if you cut their bellies a little bit... the vultures will come swooping down at, like, 35 miles an hour.<eos> I was really careful to wash my hands afterwards.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I was trying to tell you before about that... that great big house on Sunrise Beach on Mile 18?
And if he is cute... I'll let him.<eos> Oh, hey. - Hey.<eos> - What'll you have?<eos> - I'll have a Miller Lite.<eos> - Um, okay.<eos> ...two, three, go!<eos> One, two, three, go!<eos> Hi, it's Gary Silverberg.<eos> Please leave a detailed message after the beep.<eos> I've been trying to tell you since yesterday about that half-built house on Sunrise Beach.
- Um, okay.<eos> ...two, three, go!<eos> One, two, three, go!<eos> Hi, it's Gary Silverberg.<eos> Please leave a detailed message after the beep.<eos> I've been trying to tell you since yesterday about that half-built house on Sunrise Beach.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, I used the money from the Chicago house and I bought it.<eos> Now, I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure you can inflate construction costs and launder money through it.<eos> And quite frankly, I don't give a shit if you like it or not.
I... I'm sure you did.<eos> We all have lots of questions about his death, and I was wondering if you maybe had any information.<eos> How'd they treat you down there?<eos> Oh, you know...<eos> You speak to Sheriff Nix?<eos> - My lawyer did.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> What lawyers say, I guess.<eos> This Marty Byrde...<eos> - I don't know what to tell you about him.
Stay on the ground, man.<eos> Stay on the ground. Man, back!<eos> Just because you made a mistake doesn't mean you can't turn this around.<eos> No, no, no, no. Hey, wait, wait, look at him.<eos> See, he's gonna make it.<eos> Right now, you've got a second chance... down the road.<eos> But if you commit murder... you're gonna go away forever.<eos> - I'm not fucking playing.<eos> - I know you're not.<eos> And I know you got this rage inside of you that you gotta... put somewhere.
You gotta...<eos> See, here, that goes in there...<eos> So you live here? Now?<eos> Uh, only for the summer.<eos> So is there any chance I can get you to the party cove?<eos> Gets pretty wild on a holiday weekend.<eos> Uh, I wish, but I'll be chained to that dock.<eos> I see.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How much do I owe you?
- Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just through the holiday weekend.<eos> I gotta work at the Blue Cat.<eos> Well, it'll be fucking slammed here.<eos> I'll make it worth your while, cash-wise, I promise.<eos> You got any questions, just give me a call. Okay?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Who... who the hell said you could come in here without my permission?<eos> Did your pinko parents not teach you the meaning of private property?
Well, wasn't the swamp thing on the dock in business with your dad?<eos> If so, looks like a mighty dangerous place to be.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I've been here nearly 30-odd years.<eos> And in that time, every son of a bitch I've seen move here was running from something unsavory.<eos> What were you running from?<eos> You moved here, right?<eos> What did you do?<eos> Now, hold it still. You let the barrel slip 'cause you weren't staring through the shot.
Yeah, fine.<eos> Although, let me ask you a question.<eos> Uh, what do you know about the name... Snell?<eos> Well... they've lived here as long as anyone can remember.<eos> Moved up into those hills when the dam was built.<eos> Lake swallowed up their ancestors' graves.<eos> Folks tell all kinds of tales about the devious things that are going on on that farm, but who knows what is just urban legend.<eos> How'd Bobby look when they fished him out?<eos> Like a peeled pumpkin.<eos> Let that be a lesson to you, Ash.
Thanks.<eos> Hey, no lap dance for you.<eos> Yeah... free money.<eos> Who the hell is that on the pole?<eos> We needed to class the joint up if we ever wanna make any money.<eos> - And this was Marty's idea?<eos> - Mm-mm. Mine.<eos> I looked at our inventory and I felt that it was lacking.<eos> Don't get your thong in a bunch.<eos> Competition's good for you.
You hired new dancers.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're a big hit with the boys.<eos> Well, that is your call.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I mean it's yours, if you want it.<eos> - The club?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll run the books, you can take care of the day-to-day.<eos> I'll give you 1,000 bucks a week.
- Oh, what the fuck, Wyatt?<eos> - What the fuck to you!<eos> Why am I the only one who acts like an adult around here?<eos> I'm 17. You're, like, fucking 40.<eos> So?<eos> So... fuck you!<eos> Sure you don't wanna go get lost or something?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> But I would like to use the bathroom.<eos> There's a really nice one up the road I want to show you.
- Which was really nice of her.<eos> But we beat you.<eos> What's that?<eos> But we beat you here.<eos> You weren't there when we passed, so you must have already been with Mrs. Becker.<eos> But we beat you here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, right.<eos> Yeah, no, she got lost on the way here, and I wasn't paying attention.<eos> - We're just glad you're all right.

It's a big locals' thing.<eos> Celebrates the end of summer.<eos> Sounds cool, I guess.<eos> You know, I...<eos> Not your scene.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just...<eos> Sorry.<eos> All right, hand me that patch kit.<eos> It's not you, you know.
I'm gonna need a ride afterwards. They need...<eos> They need another van to help expedite the work, so I'm just gonna leave them mine.<eos> A ride?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometime in the afternoon. I'm not sure when.<eos> Uh, yeah, I... I can give you a ride.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey. How you doing?<eos> There are, like, a dozen staff members outside, all dying to buy you a beer, and you're stuck in your cave - with your worried face.
Last night, um...<eos> Yeah?<eos> When you...<eos> You've never done that before.<eos> I thought you'd like it.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - What does it mean?<eos> - Why would you think I would like that?<eos> After all these years, you...<eos> I thought you did.
Hey.<eos> Listen. Hey.<eos> Rachel. Listen to me.<eos> I work for somebody...<eos> Stop fucking around with the paper.<eos> - Marty, I need you to go now.<eos> - I know. I heard you.<eos> I work for somebody, and if I don't hit my target, there's gonna be men that are gonna come here, that are gonna kill me.<eos> They're gonna kill my wife and kill my kids.<eos> Well, I can't help you with that.
I'm talking about my life, my family's life.<eos> - I need you to go now!<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Let me explain to you the situation.<eos> - I'll tell you everything. - I'm gonna call the police.<eos> Trust me, you're not gonna call shit.<eos> You're not gonna tell...<eos> - Marty, go, now!<eos> - Put the fucking phone down!<eos> Put the phone down, and let me finish telling you what all of this is about.
I wanna talk to Ruth a sec.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> In case you guys get hungry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You seeing' Cade today?<eos> If you didn't wanna worry, you shouldn't have fuckin' hit me.<eos> I reacted fast, without thinking.<eos> They're gonna be late.<eos> An accessory.<eos> That is what she's gonna make you.
An accessory.<eos> That is what she's gonna make you.<eos> An accessory to murder.<eos> I mean, tell me you understand that.<eos> We'd be opening a bait shop in fuckin' BoraBora by the time the Cops came looking for me.<eos> Russ...<eos> I'm gonna get Byrde to invest in our shop.<eos> Yours and mine.<eos> Because he's alive and he can give us exactly what we need now.<eos> Not whatever tidbit your niece decides to throw at you 'cause he's dead.
Uh... I'll tell him if I see him.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, uh, listen, is there a better time for us to talk?<eos> 'Cause I definitely think it's worth a couple of minutes of your time.<eos> It's a great fund.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah. Give my best to Sheri.<eos> Bye.<eos> Fifteen years, I look after their money, I do a great job of it, and all they want is Bruce.<eos> They trusted you with their lives.
No, I dropped her off myself.<eos> - I'll call her.<eos> - When were you gonna tell us?<eos> School policy is to send out a text and an e-mail at the end of the day.<eos> That's a stupid fucking policy!<eos> This is a large public school, Mrs. Byrde.<eos> Voicemail.<eos> Hey, Jonah?<eos> Have you seen Charlotte?<eos> Charlotte came into school with you, didn't she?
Just walk to Sam's?<eos> I'm visiting my dad near St. Louis.<eos> I was gonna leave an hour ago.<eos> But I can show you near the station.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's go. - Oh, and you can borrow the beast.<eos> Oh, it's running again, huh?<eos> Uh, yeah, I got it fixed.<eos> Here.<eos> I'll text you.
You look like a whore.<eos> You know where the phrase "Don't stick your neck out" comes from?<eos> Fuckin' chickens.<eos> When they feel their head on the chopping' block, they actually stick their fuckin' necks out.<eos> Makes it easier to chop off their own heads.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Stupid chickens.<eos> No.<eos> Stupid you.<eos> You had Marty Byrde and you let him go.
I tell them what I believe to be true.<eos> That this is a family sabbatical.<eos> Return to simplicity.<eos> You hate it here, too.<eos> It's the first thing people see when they come in.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Did you not hear what Marty Byrde said about it?<eos> He complimented it.<eos> So, he's a smart man.<eos> - He could teach you a few things.
- I introduced you two.<eos> Kid puts blacklight posters all over his room.<eos> Now he lectures me about art?<eos> Inherits a business, and now he's the last tycoon.<eos> You're my employee, Mom.<eos> You work for me, remember?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> All I heard were the mutterings of someone who lets the dog lick peanut butter off his feet.<eos> Can I... Can I ask you a question?
Starlings spread diseases in both humans and livestock and cost up to $800 million a year to treat.<eos> They're on the list of the world's worst invaders.<eos> - Daddy?<eos> - Charlotte?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I scared you.<eos> Well, you're home.<eos> That's all I care about.<eos> - You all right? You all right?
I've spoken to Coach Daniels and her spot is still available<eos> - on the swim team, and Mr. Oakes...<eos> - You what?<eos> He wants Jonah to be part of the science decathlon<eos> - now that he's in middle...<eos> - Hang on a sec.<eos> You talked to both of them without talking to me first?<eos> I'm just trying to do what's right.<eos> While excluding me from the process?<eos> What's the matter with you?
You said that we're business partners, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right?<eos> Well, sometimes business partners disagree.<eos> Caitlin's mom said that she would house them.<eos> Hang on.<eos> You trying to teach them your little trick?<eos> When shit gets hot, you pack up and run?<eos> Oh, fuck you, Marty!<eos> Let me tell you something.
How do you do that?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I don't understand how you did that.<eos> Explain it to me.<eos> You slapped my ass, Marty.<eos> Yeah, I slapped your ass because I thought that you liked it.<eos> Oh, that is such bullshit<eos> - and you know it.<eos> You are full of shit.<eos> - Why is it bullshit that I would want to do something you might like?
You are full of shit.<eos> - Why is it bullshit that I would want to do something you might like?<eos> - My own wife.<eos> But I was so confused...<eos> - Just stop.<eos> About what you might like, I ended up doing exactly what your lover did.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - That's fuckin' bullshit.<eos> Do you know how many times you could've said no to that guy?<eos> You could've said no the first drink that he bought you.
- Stop.<eos> - You could've said no when he asked for your number, but you didn't.<eos> You could've said no the first goddamn motel room that you booked.<eos> Or the first time he stuck his fuckin' tongue down your throat.<eos> Right?<eos> Or the fuckin' first time he slapped your ass.<eos> Why would I say no, Marty?<eos> Why?<eos> Who was I saving myself for?<eos> Intimacy from you?

I know that speech. I gave that speech to people who sat in this chair when I was sitting in yours, so, you know...<eos> Look, my... my résumé clearly tells you that I can do this job.<eos> And I understand that the future of campaigning is online.<eos> I'm on Myspace, I'm on Friendster, and there's a new network called Facebook, which I think is gonna be influential.<eos> So, I know how to reach young people.<eos> I'll level with you.<eos> You seem like a nice woman, and, clearly, you're qualified.<eos> So is everyone else, and they're coming off recent campaigns.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Anthony, what did I tell you?
Though I did see a hot candy striper on the third floor, so I'm gonna have to duck out and say hello... - Hmm. - for a few.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Have some action.<eos> Look, Marty, if you need help... with anything...<eos> like, anything, watching the kids...<eos> You've never watched kids in your life.<eos> That is true, but how hard could it be?<eos> They're just like you and me, only... only smaller.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Marty, you can't blame yourself for what happened.
- Wait!<eos> - Stay the fuck away from me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Stop.<eos> - Ma!<eos> Ma! - Don't you fucking touch me!<eos> Wait!<eos> Just stop!<eos> You fucking touch me again, so help me God, I'll tell your bosses you assaulted me.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you? - You!
Stay the fuck away from me!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Okay, you ready?<eos> Time for bed.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - No, just one more?<eos> - Mm-mm. But I'm thirsty.<eos> I need water.<eos> Well, what's that got to do with cartoons, huh?<eos> You want me to get you some water, sweetheart?
Daddy'll do it. Let's go.<eos> Right.<eos> - Good night, Mommy.<eos> Night-night.<eos> There you are.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't need to be.<eos> I want you to know, I'm getting better. I am.<eos> And... I know I'm...<eos> I'm very aware that I've been... distant from the kids, and from you.
Wanna handle her first, or you ready to buy?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> You got a photo ID?<eos> All right. Just gonna need you to fill this out here.<eos> Pen there.<eos> There you go.<eos> You want a scope and a sling for that, too?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Does make for a nicer profile.<eos> Now this sling might give you a little trouble.
Towns a lot better than this one.<eos> Rivers that really run.<eos> - Cleaner lakes, in places that are...<eos> - Hey, Russ.<eos> Places that... me and you could...<eos> That we could be.<eos> There's this spot in Oregon.<eos> I'm sure we could get an investor and...<eos> Russ, stop.<eos> I need you to hear something.
- It's not the same. - But she did it.<eos> - She told me she did it.<eos> - That's hearsay.<eos> Without real evidence, I need a confession.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - Here.<eos> Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!<eos> - You fucking turned me!
- That's hearsay.<eos> Without real evidence, I need a confession.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - Here.<eos> Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!<eos> - You fucking turned me!<eos> - I...<eos> You fucking turned me!
You gotta be fucking kidding me.<eos> Look, true or false? You have no idea what it is that I do or who I do it for.<eos> - That is not the point.<eos> - Right? You've never helped me and I will make sure you never would help me.<eos> You never signed anything. You never even handed me a goddamn pen.<eos> Which means there will be nothing to implicate you in whatever it is that I do, okay?<eos> - Jesus, Marty.<eos> - Even so, I know that if the authorities caught me, if they busted me, they would try everything to link you to me, right?<eos> And it would be difficult for you to prove that you didn't conspire.<eos> Unless, of course, I made it very easy for you to prove your innocence.
I love these.<eos> Okay, there.<eos> You're set. Have a Superstore day.<eos> $67.93.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - We can't talk in there.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> - Dad said.<eos> - Said what?<eos> I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
Dad and Boyd got into some business thing and we're leaving town.<eos> What thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm guessing not actual business.<eos> They took the guns.<eos> When are they splitting?<eos> Tonight.<eos> And you're going with them?<eos> He's my dad.<eos> I'll let you know where we are when we settle.
- Did you do this?<eos> - What?<eos> Somebody fucked with all the wiring.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's been rigged.<eos> - Rigged?<eos> - Yeah, right there.<eos> It's rigged.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> You knew that they were coming after you.
I need to distribute these, and you need to keep preaching.<eos> - Now, take...<eos> - Don't fucking... touch me.<eos> I need to talk to Jacob.<eos> Service is over.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Service is over.<eos> I need to talk to Jacob.<eos> Where are the hymnals now?<eos> Preacher still with you?
So where are you going without Marty, Wendy?<eos> That's a lot of gun for a little guy.<eos> - You need to leave.<eos> - No.<eos> We're gonna visit for a while, right?<eos> - Get to know each other.<eos> - Stay back!<eos> - You don't wanna shoot anybody, Jonah.<eos> - Stop!<eos> I'm gonna take that gun from you, okay?
- Then we're gonna make something up.<eos> - Are you drunk?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm enlightened.<eos> Del Rio's got a clean sheet.<eos> That... that's why they use him to travel back and forth.<eos> We can't touch him.<eos> Jesus, what fucking box factory are you working in?<eos> The same one that'll take away your badge if you try to make a bust without cause.<eos> You need to stop worrying about the law.
What the fuck!<eos> Hey, stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop. What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - It's none of your business.<eos> - What did you say to me?<eos> - What? None of it fits anyone, and it's too shitty for Goodwill, so what're you getting so mad for?<eos> It might not feel like it now... but there's gonna come a day when you're staring at a picture... of your dad wearing some... fucking stupid motorcycle T-shirt... and you're gonna wish to fucking God... that someone said to you, "You know what?
Who knows anything with him?<eos> I know what happened, you know.<eos> I figured it out when the guns went missing.<eos> They weren't going to the Blue Cat for a fucking beer.<eos> They were going to kill Charlotte's dad.<eos> At least rob him.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> What, business opportunity?<eos> Skipping town?<eos> Not telling you?
- You don't believe that, do you?<eos> No, you're right.<eos> There's gotta be a God.<eos> 'Cause there's a devil.<eos> I think you're the fucking devil.<eos> Okay?<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Please tell me you're okay.
I wanna make a toast... to the love of my life.<eos> Belle, I wanna tell you something.
The, uh... ♪ And though I'm nobody's poet I thought it wasn't half bad ♪<eos> Kevin?<eos> - I didn't mean to do it, I swear.<eos> - I'm sorry. - Kevin.<eos> Kevin.<eos> Kevin.<eos> Look at me, son.<eos> You made the right choice.<eos> You need to look forward, not back.<eos> You got the rest of your life ahead of you.
You made the right choice.<eos> You need to look forward, not back.<eos> You got the rest of your life ahead of you.<eos> Now, this is what you're going to do.<eos> You're leaving here and driving to the house where it happened.<eos> - I can't go back there, Mr. Gilbert.<eos> - No, son.<eos> - Don't make me go back there.<eos> - Son, there's no way you can think clearly right now. I can.<eos> That's what I'm offering you, a clear path.
- I do, Mr. Gilbert.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Say you understand.<eos> - I...<eos> - I understand. - Good.<eos> When you get to the house, my guy will be there, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> He'll need to know everything.<eos> Every detail.<eos> He'll tell you what to do, what you need to say.
- Who the fuck... - do you work for, puto?<eos> - I just drive. I don't know shit.<eos> Who... the...<eos> - fuck?<eos> - Mr. Gilbert.<eos> Who the fuck is Mr. Gilbert?<eos> He's Roy Gilbert.<eos> You don't fuck with this guy.<eos> I wanna fuck Roy Gilbert.<eos> And you.
You don't fuck with this guy.<eos> I wanna fuck Roy Gilbert.<eos> And you.<eos> No, man.<eos> No, you...<eos> You didn't do nothing.<eos> You're just doing your job.<eos> You know, I'm gonna let you go, man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'll be okay.
And you.<eos> No, man.<eos> No, you...<eos> You didn't do nothing.<eos> You're just doing your job.<eos> You know, I'm gonna let you go, man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> As long as you do exactly what I tell you.<eos> I'm here to help you help yourself.
Clock's ticking.<eos> You go get that... you come right back... and by that time, you should be ready to piss again.<eos> Wait, who's Eric?<eos> He's been calling and texting all night.<eos> Oh, that's right, that's right.<eos> He called Marco when I was here.<eos> That's what made me snap.<eos> That's Eric O'Bannon.<eos> Eric fucking O'Bannon.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
- Give me the money.<eos> No, get your own fucking cash. Fuck.<eos> You piece of shit.<eos> What did you do now, huh?<eos> I literally didn't do a fucking thing and no one's gonna fucking believe me.<eos> - Then take the cash.<eos> Take it all. - Got it.<eos> I have more.<eos> - Where?<eos> - If I give you everything I have, you swear to me I'll never see your face again?

- Give me that phone.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> I've been calling.<eos> - Give me the phone.<eos> You know what?<eos> I tried.<eos> - What the fuck do you want?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I've been calling you.<eos> - I don't wanna talk to you, Kevin.
- Give me the phone.<eos> You know what?<eos> I tried.<eos> - What the fuck do you want?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I've been calling you.<eos> - I don't wanna talk to you, Kevin.<eos> Don't hang up, please.<eos> Don't hang up, John.<eos> I have to tell you, something really bad has happened, John.
- You understand me?<eos> - Where are you? It doesn't matter where I am!<eos> - You stay right there.<eos> - Can I go home?<eos> Can you what?<eos> I gotta get a drink, man.<eos> I'm so thirsty, dude.<eos> Listen to me, you fucking asshole.<eos> You stay right where you are.<eos> Stay where you are, let me get there, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.
It's...<eos> You got gas?<eos> My gas.<eos> Your gas is out.<eos> Okay.<eos> We got a tank. We got a spare tank.<eos> Empty.<eos> It's empty?<eos> Why the fuck is it empty, Ma?<eos> Chelsea's supposed to bring you fresh ones.
You gotta hold this thing in your nose, put your hand up there.<eos> It'll be okay, okay?<eos> This is not my fault, okay?<eos> You're gonna keep calling Chelsea.<eos> It's gonna be good, okay?<eos> Just keep calling her, okay?<eos> You little cunt.<eos> I heard that, Mom.<eos> Come on, answer, you fucking fuckwad.<eos> Ozzy, I got your fucking payday for you, dude. I got John Rayburn served up to you like a pig on a fucking silver fucking stick.
He's not answering my calls.<eos> I only have his cell phone number.<eos> You don't have any other contact for him?<eos> I called his home.<eos> He's probably long gone by now, on his boat or his plane, or however he does it.<eos> Vanishing is his best talent.<eos> Where's Meg?<eos> She's not answering my calls either.<eos> - God, she's useless.<eos> - If you're dizzy, why don't you sit down?

No, he said the less I knew the better.<eos> But he'd get Kevin out from under this.<eos> To frame someone else.<eos> That's the word.<eos> Frame.<eos> Mom, I...<eos> It's Belle.<eos> Kevin.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> There are gonna be a lot of questions coming at you.
Frame.<eos> Mom, I...<eos> It's Belle.<eos> Kevin.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> There are gonna be a lot of questions coming at you.<eos> And you're gonna say, "I don't remember."<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> You're gonna say, "I don't remember."<eos> You're gonna give me a chance to try to figure something out for you.
Did you know we were talking to O'Bannon?<eos> - Talking to him?<eos> - Immunity.<eos> He had some intel on Danny at the Red Reef.<eos> So, a cop who's about to offer immunity to a witness gets murdered by his own witness.<eos> Does that make any sense to you?<eos> No.<eos> Why would your brother be at Marco's so late at night?<eos> That's something we're gonna have to ask him.<eos> How you feeling?
Ozzy.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Look at me.<eos> You're in my apartment.<eos> You're in Miami.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Oh, my God. What?<eos> - Shit, where did you go?<eos> - Work.<eos> I told you I would be back for lunch to check on you, remember?
- The Rayburns are behind this shit.<eos> - Don't go down there.<eos> I told Danny the same fucking thing when I bailed you guys out and look what happened.<eos> Yeah? Why the fuck not?<eos> I'm gonna fucking hang John Rayburn out to burn and I'm gonna show you.<eos> It didn't start with him.<eos> Ozzy, don't go back there.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - It didn't start with the kids. Yeah?<eos> Who told you that?
It didn't start with him.<eos> Ozzy, don't go back there.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - It didn't start with the kids. Yeah?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Danny told you that? Who told you?<eos> Who?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Don't bring it up if it doesn't matter.<eos> - Who told you? - My mother.
Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> He ran right up to me and gave me a big hug.<eos> John?<eos> Who is that?<eos> - You don't wanna know. - I do wanna know.<eos> Save you a lot of heartbreak, you don't wanna know.
How?<eos> How are you gonna do that, John?<eos> Eric and Danny, they used to go down to mile marker 100 or so.<eos> They used to go out in the mangroves.<eos> They used to go out there and party.<eos> Off of Dusenbury Creek.<eos> Some shack or something.<eos> I'm gonna need your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be in touch with you.
He's been so great.<eos> He even paid for a specialist to come in from Miami.<eos> Really?<eos> - You're old friends, aren't you?<eos> - No. No, we just...<eos> We just knew each other a long time ago.<eos> He's been so good to us.<eos> He's not who you think he is, Belle.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm just telling you.
Listen really closely.<eos> - We've got a witness that saw you there...<eos> - No.<eos> He was dead when I got there, John, I didn't do that to him.<eos> I believe you. I don't think you could've done that...<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Did you come to finish what you started last night?<eos> You don't have much time.<eos> Now, I'm just here...<eos> I'm just here to give you the opportunity... to protect yourself.
My mother-in-law wants him christened on Sunday or she won't go back to Tallahassee.<eos> - And Belle?<eos> - Well, she's definitely ready for her mother to go back to Tallahassee, so we're gonna do it.<eos> Well, happy wife, happy life.<eos> We'd love for you to come, if you can.<eos> Um, Belle will call you with all the details.<eos> - I'd be honored.<eos> - Great.<eos> Now, I... I need you to sign this.<eos> It's just a... a note that you wrote in support of allowing Eric to attend his mother's funeral.
Okay, detectives, circle back with the CI, stay on it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> How's it going, Jake?<eos> - You really wanna know?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey. You got a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, that pissing match back there between you and the boss, that about him or me?
No, it's okay.<eos> I'm up.<eos> What, right now?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Hey, brother.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You okay?<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to let you know as soon as I heard that the prosecutors called and Eric O'Bannon gets to go to the funeral tomorrow.
Why are you so upset about this?<eos> You know what happens when you ask a guy like Roy Gilbert to help you?<eos> People get shot, don't they?<eos> Well, I mean...<eos> Do you think that's such a bad idea?<eos> Get out of my car.<eos> Get out of my car!<eos> Okay.<eos> Eric should be at her funeral. You know that, right?<eos> You need a little faith, John.
- I'm relaxed. Get your shit in the boat.<eos> - Here we go, come on.<eos> - We're coming.<eos> I told Gilbert I would give you guys a ride.<eos> This bus is leaving in two minutes.<eos> - Come on, come on, come on.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> Welcome to Florida.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I told you, it's Franny and Zooey.
- It's a gift.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's a gift.<eos> More of an acknowledgment.<eos> It's from Roy.<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> - That's from...?<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> - It's for you!<eos> He wanted me to tell you that he appreciates your work.
Any excuse to see my little guy.<eos> Hi.<eos> I have everything in here that you're gonna need. Uh...<eos> - There's diapers, wipes, these two...<eos> - Kevin, I had five children.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - They were all babies once upon a time.<eos> Use Purell on your hands.<eos> Be careful, please.<eos> Mom has something that she wants to tell you, Kev.
Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I spoke with Soledad Diaz today.<eos> They're gonna accept the plea.<eos> They are?<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> So, it's over?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you so much. Thank you so much! - Oh!
- Hey, Kevin.<eos> - I really gotta go, man.<eos> - When did you get this?<eos> - Today.<eos> - You drove down to Key West to get this?<eos> - No, it was a gift.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Really.<eos> John, I don't have to explain my business to you.
- Wow, you did clean your act up.<eos> - I'm trying, Sheryl. I'm trying.<eos> I'll get that Patrón.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - You, too.<eos> You must come to Cuba, Kevin, before it completely changes.<eos> - You like to eat, papi?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Who doesn't like to eat?<eos> I take you to the best paladares.
Yeah.<eos> - I miss you.<eos> - You too.<eos> You homesick?<eos> For what?<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Hey, Rock.<eos> You gotta help me out here, Rock.<eos> I'm trying to stay cool.<eos> How you doing, pal?
Thanks, Mom.<eos> - I'll take some coffee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I called the pizza place. I ordered a pizza.<eos> I shook down the kid who brought it, and he sang like a canary.<eos> So, you must be the famous Billy.<eos> Relax with the standing and sticking your chest out.<eos> I'm just here to talk.<eos> I don't have anything to say to you.
- I like it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I like it, too.<eos> I don't like it at all.<eos> It looks crazy.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> When you're done with hair and makeup, check with Jenny about costumes.<eos> - If you're waiting, stretch with Cherry.<eos> - Who put you in charge?
- Can we do this? - Yeah, let's go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> These two warriors go back at it.<eos> She needs to be ready in five minutes.<eos> - She needs to stop blinking.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - You are.<eos> You're like an epileptic. - Hey.<eos> How you doing?
- You heard me.<eos> I said, I'll fight you.<eos> Who, you?<eos> Bored housewife in dress?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am a proud American mother.<eos> - Oh, no way. She was faking.<eos> - Did you know? No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I would've told you.
Of course not.<eos> I would've told you.<eos> In a world without freedom.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Freedom!<eos> And I'm ready to kick your Soviet ass all the way back to Siberia.<eos> Please.<eos> Look at this brave American.<eos> Honey, will you just hold this?<eos> If this is too silly for you, you can leave.
The hotel.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got the good people of Venice to support the hotel development.<eos> You remember. Come on, man.<eos> You were there.<eos> And in exchange, Topher was gonna... well, I think I was gonna get a house.<eos> A house?<eos> Topher promised you a house?
Really. - Condolences.<eos> - God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.<eos> The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.<eos> No. Not the seat.<eos> Motherfucking...<eos> Aw, fuck off.<eos> Motherfucking...<eos> I know it's rough, man. I get it, you know?<eos> He's your best friend and all, and you miss him like hell.<eos> But know this, he will never apologize to you.

You should get on line, Chip!<eos> He is a real coolio too.<eos> Like, I haven't paid rent in like, three or six different months.<eos> So, I mean, that's one thing.<eos> But, you should hurry, because he said that rents are gonna skyrocket soon because of the new hotel going.<eos> So-- Shit!<eos> Out!<eos> - What?<eos> - Fuck, man.<eos> I can't hang out with you.
- Sorry, I--<eos> - Okay, let's just get started.<eos> - I have back-to-back sessions all day.<eos> - I have your mail.<eos> Put it on the shelf.<eos> So you said in your e-mail that you have a dance background, but you're just a bit out of shape. Right?<eos> Well, I haven't played as much paddle as I used to.<eos> That's not exercise.<eos> Lose the bag.<eos> So I'm gonna give you a beat.
Freestyle.<eos> Rosa?<eos> Sorry, I'm late. I--<eos> Oh, I thought I'd booked a private session.<eos> - You're Bryan?<eos> - Yeah. We e-mailed.<eos> Okay. So, wait, who are you?<eos> Dennis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm beneath you.
You know what? I have a really great Syrah.<eos> You have to taste this.<eos> Well, I can't right now because I have a client in Malibu.<eos> And it's three o'clock in the afternoon.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, take this as a gift, and, you know, for later.<eos> Are you around later?<eos> Yeah. You're going to Malibu. Sorry.<eos> Yeah. - I'll just hang onto it for you.
Wait. London's in--<eos> Dude, I had no idea this was your place, man.<eos> I... She said Venice, not Mar Vista.<eos> Dude...!<eos> Chip, it's all part of the chain of cause and action, man.<eos> You know? First, up goes a fancy hotel and the next thing you know, my landlord wants thousands of dollars from me or I'm out on my ass.<eos> But isn't that what you owe in rent for the last six months?<eos> I-- Come on, man. You sound just like him.<eos> All right, man.<eos> Here. Let me help you out.
- Hey.<eos> - Sorry, I had to help Cooler.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> Did you get your bike back?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I got close a couple of times, but...<eos> - It's good, I needed the workout, so...<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I'm Scott.<eos> I'd be stoked to give you a tour.
- Yeah.<eos> - And then Noir...<eos> - Noir?<eos> Yeah, I just...<eos> I just think it was too much for his old heart to handle.<eos> Sweetie, you've gotta get rid of the dog bed.<eos> I like to look at it.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Here, all right.<eos> This... belongs to you.
Hey, man.<eos> Here, all right.<eos> This... belongs to you.<eos> It's been playing on my mind, that last conversation we had.<eos> You know, there was a lot going on...<eos> The fact that I had been drinking, and the jacket.<eos> And I now realize that you also wanted to know the truth about the accident.<eos> And I'm sorry, I didn't pick up on that in the moment.<eos> I just...<eos> But I could tell you now.
I...<eos> She was sober but, you know, it would have killed her career.<eos> - So you took the fall for her? - No.<eos> I did it for me.<eos> 'Cause I thought...<eos> I thought if I did this, if we had this thing-- this secret-- that maybe it would keep us connected.<eos> That somehow, that would... keep us together.<eos> She was already breaking my heart.<eos> I just wanted it to break a little slower.<eos> Look, Chip, I don't blame you.
Look, Chip, I don't blame you.<eos> But you were in love and you were desperate.<eos> I don't blame you for telling that lie in that moment.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Problem is, though, Chip, you didn't just tell that lie in that moment, you did it again and again.<eos> And not just in the rooms.<eos> You did it in every room that you ever set foot in.<eos> You lied to me, you lied to anyone who would listen.<eos> And we did. We all listened.<eos> We all believed you.

Yeah.<eos> You knew about that?<eos> He's down here now for the trial.<eos> Asshole. What good's he gonna do?<eos> He's changed.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Sort of had an epiphany when he was in jail.<eos> My brother's always involved in stupid bullshit.<eos> When am I gonna learn to expect the fucking expected?<eos> Did Eric tell you that he called me?
Singing, remember that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did it happen, John?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> But you were there.<eos> We were all there.<eos> No.<eos> No, Danny.<eos> With Danny.<eos> And you.
I'm so sorry you're going through this right now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I can't believe I have to deal with this shit now.<eos> It wasn't even hurting before.<eos> Now it hurts every time I even talk.<eos> - He hasn't even done anything yet.<eos> - Did he give you anything? For the pain?
Nothing's falling apart, Nolan.<eos> We're all still here.<eos> In spirit, if not in body.<eos> You're not.<eos> We're not.<eos> People are gone, Sally.<eos> And anyone who's left is just kind of... I don't know, messed up.<eos> Well... things'll work out.<eos> They always do.<eos> Told you.

Run!<eos> Monty, you can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> Jasper!<eos> Let me go.<eos> No!<eos> Clarke, what do we do?<eos> The sky is... falling.<eos> The sky is falling.<eos> What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?<eos> It's just rain, not radioactive ash.<eos> Dude, not cool.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> Don't be like that, guys.<eos> Guys!<eos> When did everyone around here lose their sense of humor?<eos> Abby, if you're right, then Luna's the miracle we need.<eos> I wish I were with you.
Rumors of the Flame's destruction are spreading.<eos> People on the street openly call for the king's head.<eos> Your choices have consequences.<eos> Would you rather I killed Indra's daughter?<eos> I'd rather you didn't kill.<eos> Our mission is to keep Roan on the throne, to buy time for the others to find a way to save us from the radiation.<eos> I'm doing that.<eos> By decapitating an innocent boy.<eos> Everyone's guilty of something.<eos> There's a darkness in you, Octavia.
"Rogue." I'm a warrior.<eos> No.<eos> A warrior knows when not to kill.<eos> Lincoln taught you that.<eos> You seem to have forgotten.<eos> You're right that we have a job to do here, and right now, you're making it more difficult.<eos> Chancellor Kane, the king would like to see you.<eos> You're no longer part of my security detail.<eos> I had Helios saddled for you.<eos> The ride home will do you good.

I got you.<eos> Cover Luna.<eos> Cover Luna!<eos> Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Go.<eos> I got her.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Get down.<eos> Emori, are you ok?
Let's move out.<eos> I'll take up the back.<eos> We shouldn't be in this forest, John.<eos> We need to cut our losses. Why?<eos> Hey, what are you not telling me?<eos> Just trust me.<eos> There are worst things on this island than drones.<eos> We're safer at your bunker.<eos> It's not stocked.<eos> - I told you, I ate everything.
- Just put it away.<eos> Monty, talk to me.<eos> - Hey, what... what's going on?<eos> I know you know something.<eos> The ship will only save 100 people.<eos> Guess Clarke made a list.<eos> - You didn't tell me?<eos> - Clarke has a plan.<eos> Clarke lied to our faces.<eos> She didn't... even tell you she was making a list.
That... that is just great.<eos> Guess what, Monty.<eos> You're not.<eos> What?<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Clarke thinks you're expendable.<eos> Clarke, wait.<eos> Really?<eos> I found your list.<eos> I guess we know who really matters to you.
Clarke, wait.<eos> Really?<eos> I found your list.<eos> I guess we know who really matters to you.<eos> Jasper...<eos> You're not God, Clarke.<eos> You don't get to decide who lives or dies.<eos> The list is a backup.<eos> We have a...<eos> Well, I guess you don't mind if I tell everyone, then, right?
Mia, Mia, slow down!<eos> Slow down, Mia!<eos> Slow down.<eos> Slow down!<eos> Slow down!<eos> Brakes!<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> I'm just gonna need a minute.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Adrian, you okay?
Slow down!<eos> Brakes!<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> I'm just gonna need a minute.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Adrian, you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> How's my hair?<eos> Improved.<eos> Adrian, are you okay?
- I have no idea.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Is help coming?<eos> You were supposed to wait for us.<eos> Calm down.<eos> - Where'd you go?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> What...<eos> Who told you you could release my prisoners?
- Hey, Connor!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey, take it easy.<eos> - Connor.<eos> - Try it again.<eos> I dare you.<eos> You think that's gonna make me stop calling you a pussy?<eos> Come on. Hey!<eos> We could have been killed back there.<eos> I don't have to explain anything to you.
Ok.<eos> - Ohh... - You're ok.<eos> All right.<eos> This is the last batch of moonshine.<eos> Feels a little light.<eos> Your hunters are slipping.<eos> I can only dry what they bring me.<eos> Hey, any word from Jaha?<eos> Did they find Bellamy's unit? Yeah.<eos> They're back, and we forgot to tell you.
They're back, and we forgot to tell you.<eos> Hi.<eos> How light were we?<eos> Always so serious.<eos> Better.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> The earth will be more generous next time.<eos> See you then.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Uh... did you charge the radio that I gave you when you were here?
1, 2...<eos> I was on my way home from Polis when I found her.<eos> Ok.<eos> Get her to medical now.<eos> Getting her here saved her life. Thank you.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, shh, it's ok.<eos> It's ok.<eos> You're ok.<eos> Octavia, you've lost a lot of blood, but you're home now.<eos> I'm gonna help you.
Abby, what happened when you tried to get the Nightblood protein to bond with Luna's DNA?<eos> The structure of the RNA fell apart.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Abby, she just had a seizure.<eos> Because I think I know why Becca couldn't make it work in this lab.<eos> Computer, show me prototype Nightblood<eos> RNA binding in a zero-g environment.<eos> It would work.<eos> Simulation complete.<eos> Your hallucination told you this?
I broke it?<eos> You nearly killed Octavia.<eos> You're holding Bellamy and our Chancellor hostage.<eos> You marched an army here to do what, exactly?<eos> Why would you kill us when you know we're all gonna die soon, anyway?<eos> We're not here to kill you, Clarke.<eos> We're here to take your ship, a ship you restored to save your people, not mine.<eos> That ship is a backup plan.<eos> It'll hold 100 people tops.<eos> Then you won't mind if we take it.

It doesn't have to be like this.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> The way I see it, you have two choices... tell your shooters to stand down, give us your ship, and use whatever time we have left to find your Nightblood solution, or tell them to open fire.<eos> We have more bullets than you have men.<eos> You'll lose.<eos> Maybe.<eos> We'll both take losses, Kane and Bellamy among them.<eos> You think you can shake my resolve?<eos> I was willing to sacrifice my own mother to stop A.L.I.E..<eos> And I was willing to sacrifice mine to help you.
Look out.<eos> Skaikru!<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> I need to talk to whoever's in charge.<eos> Is Octavia alive?<eos> Speak.<eos> One of our people has moved out of formation.<eos> I've reason to believe he's trying to kill your king.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Why do you think he's telling you this?
I've been through worse, Doc.<eos> Not worse than this.<eos> Raven, it could kill you.<eos> Could or... will?<eos> So, what, I survive long enough for everyone else to die?<eos> I can't do that, Abby.<eos> Even if it costs me my life... you have to let me go.<eos> Abby, wait.<eos> Why haven't you had any symptoms?<eos> They used the EMP on you, too.
Kane and Monty will be executed, and our side will open fire.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> You're a prisoner.<eos> You're just saying what they want you to say.<eos> I know all about that.<eos> I'm done with this.<eos> Move, or I'll kill you, too.<eos> Riley, stand down, ok?<eos> I am begging you.<eos> I know how you feel about them, and I know what they did to you, but your life... your life was saved for a reason, and this isn't it.

You wondering why the fuck you decided to do this yet?<eos> No.<eos> I'm wondering why I picked something that takes so many fucking visits.<eos> You said you wanted it finished by your birthday.<eos> And so it shall be.<eos> Thirty fucking five.<eos> What are you doing up?<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> This fucking tooth is killing me.<eos> Didn't Dr. Fred give you something for the pain?
Well, sure, honey.<eos> We're booked, but you can have your old room.<eos> - That's fine. Thanks.<eos> - Is everything all right at the motel?<eos> Oh, yeah, no, it's fine.<eos> It's the... The plumbing at the hotel and...<eos> In the building.<eos> They're working on it.<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> - Just want you to know I'm grateful.
Sure, okay.<eos> Do you think it would help if I testify?<eos> In relation to what?<eos> We don't want you getting mixed up in this.<eos> I'm a Rayburn.<eos> I'm already mixed up in it.<eos> Would've broken your daddy's heart to see you leave the way you did.<eos> You didn't even press your dress.<eos> I was in a hurry to get away.<eos> Leaving us for a man who didn't even give you a ring.
But you could rebut that.<eos> You could give Meg a human face.<eos> I'll get back to you, Mr. Marx.<eos> How does it feel to be 35 again?<eos> It's a great excuse to have a party.<eos> And since when do you like parties?<eos> Since my family is not at them.<eos> I got your message.<eos> I'm not coming home.<eos> You realize that Eric's defense is attempting to make you a suspect?
And since when do you like parties?<eos> Since my family is not at them.<eos> I got your message.<eos> I'm not coming home.<eos> You realize that Eric's defense is attempting to make you a suspect?<eos> I said, I got the message.<eos> I mean, I thought at least once you heard that you could at least... give me a fucking call or something.<eos> Why?<eos> I knew you would track me down.<eos> You don't care what people are saying?
Meggie?<eos> Is that you, honey?<eos> - Is that you?<eos> - Do you have any gin?<eos> This is Meg's house.<eos> She only drinks tequila.<eos> She doesn't have room for more than one bottle in this place?<eos> Oh, you look so tired, Mama.<eos> Come on.<eos> I raised you better than to say that to a woman over the age of 20.
I saw him sitting in his car.<eos> I think he might have been crying.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - I passed him on the way up. On the way down, he was still there.<eos> I left my phone in the car, so I couldn't call sooner.<eos> Where?<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> LC said she saw you.<eos> You okay?
They won't lock.<eos> I mean, the locks are there, but I...<eos> They won't work.<eos> And then I wake up right before I see who the person is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I probably sound crazy.<eos> I don't think you're crazy.<eos> Kevin...<eos> Kevin's told me he's had a dream very similar to that.<eos> What about you?
Move on with your lives, put this shit in your rear-view mirror.<eos> Listen, um, I wanna say... thank you for everything you've done.<eos> A new day begins, right, Kevin?<eos> Good night, man.<eos> Well, that was quite a performance.<eos> The jury wept.<eos> - I almost shed a tear myself.<eos> - I did what I had to do.<eos> You always do, Sally.<eos> That's what I admire about you.
Hard to forget.<eos> I'm involved with them in something big.<eos> I need it to go through in order to finance this project.<eos> Okay.<eos> But, uh... there have been some hitches in the deal.<eos> I need you to help.<eos> I don't know, Roy.<eos> I'm finally free of all that shit, you know?<eos> Well, of course.<eos> You wouldn't have to do anything... you're uncomfortable about.

I've been thinking about... The day my father died.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was six.<eos> - I know.<eos> You told me this.<eos> - I didn't tell you this part.<eos> We were... so happy. We were about to fly for the first time for a family vacation.<eos> We were going to Arizona.<eos> And me and my sisters were out in the front yard, playing tag and running through the sprinklers. And my mom called us in, and she told us that he had been killed in a truck accident.<eos> Honey, you okay?

- I am terrified of her.<eos> Come work with me for six months.<eos> Worst thing that could happen is you come back to Camelot.<eos> - Why don't we just start with a visit?<eos> - Done.<eos> When? Well, I'll tell you what. Next year there's a pier dedication for Mom and Dad.<eos> - Oh, fancy.<eos> - How's that? Think Danny will show?<eos> Oh, I hope not.<eos> Don't you miss... actual police work?
- Oh, really?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Yes. You know this family's never gonna let you on the inside.<eos> - They're my family too at this point.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Best thing you can do for John... is for you guys to get as far away from here as possible.<eos> You're a beautiful woman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> - What's up with you tonight?
We could arrange a marriage.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> You pay.<eos> I'm still not gonna lower my price, though.<eos> We have a boss too, you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who do you think he will blame for this?<eos> Look, Nic, I can...<eos> Forget these two fucking guys.<eos> Listen. I trust you and I know you trust me.

I trust you and I know you trust me.<eos> And I'm telling you, straight up, I'm up against a bottom line here.
- Gee, thanks.<eos> - But you're a Rayburn.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the fuck does that mean?<eos> What really happened, Sally?<eos> Do you think Eric's innocent?<eos> Doesn't matter what I think.<eos> It's a real tragedy.<eos> I wanna hear it from you.
Your instincts.<eos> That's all it is in business.<eos> Anyone can type numbers in a spreadsheet, but...<eos> - spreadsheets can't tell you who to trust.<eos> - True.<eos> So you're okay with it?<eos> More than okay.<eos> - We'll take it from here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I wanna show you something.
- No. - You're gonna be in here...<eos> - Too much planning. Too much at stake.<eos> I want you to be there.<eos> I c... I can't.<eos> Roy, I can't do that.<eos> I don't know what's going down.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> My guys will take care of everything.<eos> - You just take care of the Cubans.<eos> - Okay. - They trust you.
Look, it...<eos> I'm your grandmother, Nolan, like it or not.<eos> You're stuck with me.<eos> And this is what families do.<eos> They hand things down.<eos> Rayburn House Inn.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Roy had a heart attack.<eos> He's in the hospital.<eos> He wanted me to tell you.
Good.<eos> Destroy them or die for them.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Did you fuck us, Kevin?<eos> Nicolas, is that you?<eos> Did you fuck us?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Where the fuck are you, pendejo?<eos> We trust you.
He'll give us Gilbert.<eos> Then we'll arrest both of them.<eos> - Yeah, she's really sweet.<eos> - Well, mission incomplete, I'm afraid.<eos> No John.<eos> - You couldn't find him?<eos> - No.<eos> I checked the motel, the inn.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Wow. Twenty years on the job, you couldn't find a guy that wasn't hiding from you.
He found you and he built it.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> I only knew what I didn't want.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that, Roy.<eos> Everybody changes.<eos> Never changed for me.<eos> I didn't wanna be responsible for anyone.<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> In some ways... I envy you, Sally.<eos> The only thing you ever cared about... was your family.
She's good.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Alone.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's that about?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> There's something I gotta tell you.
I did something I shouldn't... I said...<eos> Well, I definitely said<eos> - something I shouldn't have.<eos> - What?<eos> John, listen to me, okay?<eos> I'm coming clean, and I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry from the bottom of my fucking heart, but the last time we were here, I kissed Diana.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> That's why we didn't come back,<eos> - that's why I can't face you...
- Okay.<eos> You're overreacting.<eos> - Is this about O'Bannon?<eos> What's with you and the case?<eos> Guy's doing 30 years.<eos> It's over.<eos> - Why are you fucking asking questions?<eos> - You're acting really paranoid right now.<eos> Then what was in the file, Mike?<eos> - Why did he give you a file? - What file?
- You looking into this case?<eos> - I'm not looking into it.<eos> - Why did Aguirre lie to me when I said, "Mike Gallagher.<eos> He's in fucking town."<eos> He lies about it.<eos> Why would he do that, Mike?<eos> - Why the fuck did he lie about that? - Okay.<eos> Hold on, hold on, okay?<eos> Okay, just calm down a little bit here.<eos> There is something that I... I didn't tell you.
Okay, just calm down a little bit here.<eos> There is something that I... I didn't tell you.<eos> You've been turning me down, like, non-stop.<eos> I got a shit ton of work in Boston, and I'm looking for a partner, somebody I can trust.<eos> So I approach Aguirre.<eos> He says, "Sure, I'll consider it."<eos> He gives me his résumé, his financials, but I tell him, listen,<eos> "Don't tell John until you've made up your mind."<eos> Now, look... you're going through something.<eos> Only thing I'm doing, I wanna help you climb out of it.
I get it, John.<eos> Usually you're the guy that goes and answers a call for help, so what, you're not allowed to make one yourself?<eos> - You're not supposed to be here.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> I am supposed to be here.<eos> Look, everything's going fine, John.<eos> I've got a job.<eos> Mom's okay.<eos> I have a good relationship with my son.<eos> I don't have to borrow money from you anymore.
Secret of life?<eos> Knowing when to leave.<eos> Knowing when to leave.<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Hey, come here a second.<eos> Come here.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your secret's safe with me, okay?<eos> I won't tell anybody what you told me.<eos> I didn't tell you anything.
Who chose those teams?<eos> - Who chose them?<eos> - Oh, you little rat.<eos> Oh, you little Dickens, you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been coming here.<eos> Are you gonna stand here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> Come on.<eos> He does this every fucking time.<eos> I told you.
I told you.<eos> It's like bringing home a damn time bomb.<eos> Hey, Mom?<eos> Just promise me you won't tell the others, okay?<eos> You'll always be my baby.<eos> A mother and her firstborn have the strongest bond, I know you feel it too.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want me to do exactly?<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> I just want to show you all that'll be yours one day if you want it.
You can't even stay at your own house.<eos> Danny.<eos> I need to know... that my family's gonna be safe.<eos> John.<eos> You're waiting in your car... for somebody to kill me.<eos> You're hoping that he does.<eos> What about me?<eos> Aren't I your family?<eos> Let's you and I meet tomorrow.<eos> There's something I want to tell you.
If I had to do it over...<eos> It doesn't work that way, right?<eos> You don't get that chance.<eos> You said what you said in court.<eos> Well, I didn't have a choice.<eos> You had to protect Kevin.<eos> We all know that.<eos> It's not your fault, John.<eos> That's what you came here to ask me, right?<eos> If we blame you?
Why didn't they stay together?<eos> They never were together like that.<eos> How did they meet?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never asked.<eos> Do you have any good memories of my dad?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I thought so.<eos> I told you a story about us swimming.
And then we had to go back and pick him up.<eos> Are you sure that's true?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I heard your story. I don't buy it.<eos> You guys grew up around water.<eos> You'd have been swimming since you were really little.<eos> What really happened?<eos> It's not a story.<eos> - That's what happened. That's true.<eos> - I mean with you.
There's just what is.<eos> And maybe we can figure this out together.<eos> You stay the fuck away from me.<eos> - Sit down. - You stay the fuck...<eos> Now, listen.<eos> You have to learn to be able to leave the past behind. I...<eos> I know that you're upset because you think that your father is disappearing.<eos> And I know that you're upset because Eric is dead.<eos> But you... You gotta be able to let these things go.<eos> That's what I should have said to you in the car.
And I know that you're upset because Eric is dead.<eos> But you... You gotta be able to let these things go.<eos> That's what I should have said to you in the car.<eos> Said when?<eos> In the car, on the way back from Eric's wake.<eos> - That's what I should have said.<eos> - Eric's wake?<eos> I've been here dealing with Sally.<eos> What about Mom?<eos> Are you okay?
But you... You gotta be able to let these things go.<eos> That's what I should have said to you in the car.<eos> Said when?<eos> In the car, on the way back from Eric's wake.<eos> - That's what I should have said.<eos> - Eric's wake?<eos> I've been here dealing with Sally.<eos> What about Mom?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Is there something wrong with you?
It's me, John.<eos> I don't know what happened, but everything's gonna be all right.<eos> We're gonna get through this.<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Mom, she's not the answer.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - This isn't it.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I want to talk to you outside.
The question is, why do you need me here?<eos> Why do you need me... here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, I told you you couldn't handle it.<eos> What the fuck was I supposed to do?<eos> I was just a kid.<eos> I couldn't do anything.<eos> He was too strong.<eos> I couldn't do anything.<eos> I don't blame you for any of that.
Yeah, I told you you couldn't handle it.<eos> What the fuck was I supposed to do?<eos> I was just a kid.<eos> I couldn't do anything.<eos> He was too strong.<eos> I couldn't do anything.<eos> I don't blame you for any of that.<eos> You were a kid.<eos> What could you do?

You were a kid.<eos> You couldn't stop him. I don't blame you.<eos> But you just said you don't blame me.<eos> - I don't blame you.
He was too strong.<eos> I couldn't do anything.<eos> I don't blame you for any of that.<eos> You were a kid.<eos> What could you do? You were a kid.<eos> You couldn't stop him. I don't blame you.<eos> But you just said you don't blame me.<eos> - I don't blame you.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> I don't blame you for that.
I don't blame you for that.<eos> Ever since then, though, John, what do you think you've done?<eos> What do you think you've been trying to do?<eos> You've been trying to protect me.<eos> You've been trying to make me okay, haven't you? Huh?<eos> You've been keeping me weak with loaning me money, going to pick me up all the time, making excuses for me, I wouldn't show.<eos> You've been keeping me an asshole.<eos> I didn't need any of that.<eos> Didn't make me any better.<eos> What did I need from you?
John, you really don't remember him saving you?<eos> - Mom, the doctor said that...<eos> - You're right.<eos> They said rest and your memory will come back slowly.<eos> So we just won't force it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Nolan stopped by while you were napping.<eos> How long was I asleep?<eos> Maybe an hour.<eos> He wants to talk to you, John.
[narrator] As one of the few black faces in this mostly white place...<eos> - [man] Anyone? - [narrator] ...<eos> Sam had become used to episodes like this... [man] Anyone with some special connection to the material?<eos> [narrator] ...and run-ins like these.<eos> You look like Beyoncé.<eos> Storm from the X-Men. Wait, what are you?<eos> [narrator] Sam had enough and took to Winchester's syndicated student radio station.<eos> Dear white people, here's a little tip.<eos> When you ask someone who looks ethnically different, "What are you?" the answer is usually,<eos> "A person about to slap the shit out of you."
However, after pressure from the administration, - the party was canceled.<eos> - [electronic beep] But somehow, unbeknownst to Pastiche, an invite went out anyway.<eos> And it is here we find Sam and her camera, at the epicenter of one of the biggest scandals to hit Winchester so far.<eos> And like most parties, the hangover from this one... is a motherfucker.<eos> ♪ What's in close with what I think... ♪ Dear white people, here's a list of acceptable Halloween costumes:<eos> a pirate, slutty nurse, any of our first 43 presidents.<eos> Top of the list of unacceptable costumes: me.<eos> Winchester couldn't get through 2017 without blackface?<eos> ♪ And I'm still kinda young... ♪<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Am I being too loud for you?
All right. What CW show are we in?<eos> You know what I'm trying to say.<eos> You want more.<eos> I gotta go get a shower.<eos> - Later, gator.<eos> [Sam] Lionel Higgins, right?<eos> Um, yes.<eos> From the Winchester Independent.<eos> Covering this meeting. I just need someone to give me the lay of the land.<eos> [Sam] Sure. You did that article about breaking up the party.
Don't want to bug, but I know you forget to eat.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Is this the party?<eos> You okay?<eos> "Hate it when bae leaves"?<eos> Uh, yeah, I know.<eos> But, you know, uh, in my defense, the use of "bae" was purely ironic.<eos> You didn't think to ask before you posted that?<eos> Uh... Um, I'm sorry.<eos> Are you embarrassed?
- [indistinct chatter] [woman] He's cheating.<eos> Well, you don't seem to mind any other time.<eos> There were cameras there.<eos> Roland Martin was a mere two feet away, and we all know how he loves to blast people on Twitter.<eos> I'm still in therapy from the last time I was trending.<eos> - But I'm in love with you. - [man] You better tell him.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You are the leader of the free world.<eos> You don't get to fall in love.<eos> And what about you?
We feel that our vizier will find a solution for this problem.<eos> Nobody will be able to gossip about it because of fear.<eos> People are having difficult times.<eos> They too have the right to love, to become mothers, and raise dutiful children for our empire.<eos> We'll do everything possible for these villagers who are my countrymen.<eos> But who will be charged with this duty...<eos> My vizier.<eos> Mustesna, you don't have any relatives, right?<eos> -I don't, my vizier.<eos> -I'll assign you a crucial duty.
Alright. For this crucial duty, you'll need to divide into two groups: single and married.<eos> Now, the married ones who have children, go back to your initial places.<eos> Now, those from the Black Sea region and Caucasia, divide as a group; the Kurds and Zazas as a group; the Arabs and Persians as a group those living on the coast, the Rumelians and Thracians, as a group; ...and those from Anatolia and the nomads, as another group.<eos> What is your name, son?<eos> Nazik, sir.<eos> Iâ€™m from Kayseri.<eos> Move over there.<eos> Pasha, I'd like to die on the battlefront for my country instead of dying here.<eos> I'd like to take you with me, but it seems that you've already completed your duty for your country.<eos> May God give you a long life.
We will fight on your behalf.<eos> Don't forget to lubricate your rifles.<eos> Okay, we won't!<eos> Girls, I had a very beautiful dream last night.<eos> -What was it? -What was it?<eos> Well, I was in a heaven like place.<eos> Peace be upon you, ladies.<eos> And upon you!<eos> Oh, Gulbahar. The sultan of sultans.<eos> Just say "yes", I'll dedicate my life to you, my quiet Gulbahar.
But now, you want me gone.<eos> What happened?<eos> Listen!<eos> What?<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Good riddance, Kudbettin.<eos> I'm leaving now, but I will tell everything to the magistrate.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Don't make me mad.<eos> I'll tear you apart.
-I swear, I didn't! It's a lie!<eos> According to the Islamic law, this thief's hand shall be cut off as a warning to others.<eos> Your honorable magistrate.<eos> In our district of Bursa, this heathen stole exactly 200 horses and 15 thousand coins which belonged to our state.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I swear that they're wrongly accusing me, your honor.<eos> Our Prophet Muhammad who was sent as a mercy to mankind said that:<eos> "I swear by God that even if my daughter Fatima were to steal, I would cut off her hands."<eos> All these poor people work and pay their taxes, but you steal what the Muslim people have. Is that so?<eos> People like you need to be killed!
-Did he say "salad"?<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> Whip!<eos> Whip!<eos> Now, tell me the truth.<eos> What did the vizier say?<eos> Whip!<eos> Whip!<eos> Stop...<eos> My God, I'm coming to you.
They never stopped praying no matter what I said.<eos> Mom, you know what, the magistrate is about to die anyway.<eos> If we find an opportunity, that is, if the magistrate becomes our father...<eos> And?<eos> Then, we'll own everything. We'll have power, prestige, gold, emeralds, velvets, lands and soldiers.<eos> We need to side with the powerful to avoid being weak with the weak.<eos> Power brings money, but money doesn't bring power.<eos> Look at these little trollops.<eos> Where did you learn all those things?<eos> -From you.

Don't you ever call me "pasha" when we get there, okay?<eos> -Okay, pasha! -Okay, pasha!<eos> Tighten this and my waist will look thinner.<eos> -You'll tighten my waist too, okay?<eos> -Okay, I'll do it.<eos> Girls, I'm so excited.<eos> Fortunately, my waist is thin.<eos> Just like a glass.<eos> He will see a thin waist for the first time in his life.<eos> Meftune, you look great, but I wish God would have made you a bit taller.
Why did you call me "pasha"?<eos> What are we going to say to the magistrate of this village?<eos> Father Mustesna, relax.<eos> Don't worry about him.<eos> I took care of everything.<eos> I'm sure the magistrate is shaking in his boots now.<eos> I know state affairs.<eos> Father Mustesna, speak seldomly.<eos> Everybody already knows that you're a pasha.<eos> Now, we'll tell you the most important issues that you need to know.
You're not porters anymore.<eos> You are the new owners and true masters of these lands.<eos> Go, make me proud.<eos> Pasha...<eos> If you have nobody to support you and if you are poor, nobody is interested in you.<eos> Rich people never look at our faces while we carry their goods.<eos> But you...<eos> You looked into our eyes.<eos> You treated us like humans.<eos> Pasha, we're grateful to you for choosing us and for giving us a chance to live these beautiful moments.
But you...<eos> You looked into our eyes.<eos> You treated us like humans.<eos> Pasha, we're grateful to you for choosing us and for giving us a chance to live these beautiful moments.<eos> Pasha, we aren't educated, wise and elegant like you.<eos> We are mere porters.<eos> Thank you for treating us like humans, pasha.<eos> Pasha, who would take care of poor porters like us other than you?<eos> Pasha, you made orphans like us happy.<eos> May God give you a long life.

Go on then.<eos> Oh, my sweetheart with an exceptional face.<eos> -Pasha...<eos> -God.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Oh, my sweetheart with an exceptional face.<eos> After I was honored with the magnificence of your pretty face, I was rejuvenated by your love.<eos> I never intend to annoy you, I would like to exhibit my sincerity.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -Don't you like it?
I don't want anything.<eos> Dilaver, come to your senses.<eos> I swear, we'll mess you up!<eos> Do what you have to do as a husband!<eos> Otherwise, we will muck you up!<eos> We can't wait for it, come on!<eos> Don't shout!<eos> It went completely soft!<eos> I don't know how to do it!<eos> I'll teach you, Dilaver.
The prayers are in our mouths.<eos> The prayers are in our mouths.<eos> Oh, bride, bride, bride!<eos> Red-dressed, hennaed bride!<eos> May God protect you, Sparkling, veiled bride.<eos> Sparkling, veiled bride.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Who cries before her wedding?<eos> You found someone to love, so you need to be happy.<eos> Mom, we have a magistrate father thanks to you.
Holden Caulfield is a spoiled rich kid from the Upper East Side who goes to a fancy prep school.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> Uh, what about you, Mr. Anderson?<eos> Well, my dad's not a billionaire Wall Street CEO, and if he is, he owes my mom a whole lot of back child support.<eos> So I'm partial to Lord of the Flies.<eos> I don't think Holden Caulfield would last a week on this island.<eos> He'd be running around like a little punk, wishing for this nightmare to be over.<eos> Kind of like a substitute teacher.<eos> Oh! Well played, Max.<eos> You know, the good news is you have a very bright academic future ahead of you.
What took us so long to do this?<eos> Uh, probably because it took you seven years to ask.<eos> Hmm. You know, a part of me thought you'd never propose.<eos> Well, it's like my favorite Justin Bieber song.<eos> - "Never Say Never."<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Or my second favorite Justin Bieber song...<eos> - "Sorry."<eos> - That was a good one.<eos> - Would you look at the flowers!
You're still at the hotel?<eos> Yeah, where are you?<eos> I am at the church.<eos> You're at the what?<eos> Boy, you did not go to my wedding without me!<eos> Dude, you weren't in your room, man.<eos> I know, because I was stuck in an elevator!<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Listen, I just need you to come down here and get me before everybody notices I'm gone.<eos> Hey, Rob, I got something to tell you, and I don't think you're gonna be too jazzed up about it.
Yeah, baby, I'm fine.<eos> I just really wanted your wedding day to be perfect.<eos> It will be, once you're in it.<eos> How soon can you get here?<eos> Well... funny story!<eos> - I managed to get arrested.<eos> - For what?<eos> Because I may have ran butt-naked through the Bridge Run.<eos> Rob, I don't understand.<eos> I'm only sharing this with you because it's gonna be on the news at five, six, seven and 11.
Because you're not a man and you never will be.<eos> Wait, what are you even talking about?<eos> I got kidnapped last night!<eos> "I got kidnapped last night." Wow.<eos> Somebody's trying to sabotage my wedding, and I'm gonna find out who it is.<eos> That could be anybody, Rob.<eos> What's that loud ringing?<eos> Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong!<eos> Those are church bells, you idiot.<eos> Now, look, you're running out of time.
Yeah. - That's the centerpiece of the reception. - All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on, back up.<eos> Give him room now.<eos> Give him room. Let him breathe.<eos> Can I use your man right there?<eos> I come up and...<eos> You first come up and... ♪ Everybody dance now ♪<eos> - Slap it hard.<eos> - Oh! Come here and you grab like this.
I want you to keep reaching out to shareholders.<eos> Give them what they want, but do it quietly.<eos> I don't want this getting leaked before we announce next week.<eos> All right?<eos> Anderson, what happened? Are you drunk?<eos> I'm not drunk.<eos> I'm on drugs.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Did you just puke coins?<eos> Would you look at that?
She's a big girl.<eos> We gonna be here all day.<eos> I didn't mean "big" in a bad way.<eos> I bet you is warm.<eos> "I have for the first time found what I can truly love."<eos> I found... you.<eos> You are my sympathy... my better self... my good angel.<eos> I am bound to you... with a strong attachment.<eos> I think you're... good... gifted... lovely.<eos> A fervent... a solemn passion, conceived in my heart... and it leans to you and draws you to my center.
Let's just leave the pigeons alone.<eos> They're just playing.<eos> - No, Rob, there's pigeons in the church.<eos> - Yeah, I know, baby.<eos> We'll worry about that later, okay?<eos> Father, do your thing.<eos> - Rob!<eos> - Would you just leave the pigeons alone?<eos> Please, would you just, baby, just leave the pigeons alone?<eos> What is wrong with you?
I did?<eos> Rob.<eos> Rob, is this true?<eos> I don't... I don't... I don't know.<eos> No. You know what?<eos> You're done, Othello.<eos> We're gonna go.<eos> Megan. Megan. Megan.<eos> I believed in you, Rob, when no one else did.<eos> I will never forgive you!
But it just seems no matter what I do, I just can't get anything right.<eos> Baby, what are you talking about?<eos> You're here.<eos> - Let's do this.<eos> - No, it's not about the wedding.<eos> Babe, I'm talking about the rest of our lives.<eos> I don't have a career, any goals.<eos> Maybe I'm not husband material.<eos> Is this about my dad?<eos> I mean, baby, since when do you care what he thinks?
Where are you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Listen, I don't have a lot of time to talk.<eos> I just want to tell you that I am sorry.<eos> I've been stuck.<eos> I've just been holding on to a bunch of bullshit, and you haven't gotten what you needed from me.<eos> It's kind of like with your kids, you know, your patients.<eos> You say they grow up fast when they're dealing with a crisis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I've been dealing with a crisis of unimaginable proportions, and I just want to tell you that I am... I am getting out my own damn way.
Yeah. And he's also the kind of man that's planning to take over your company.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> He's bought up 47% of your shares and has a lead on another five.<eos> Now, I know I'm just a substitute teacher, but... sounds to me like you're screwed.<eos> Cody, is this true?<eos> You always treated me like garbage.<eos> Worse than garbage.<eos> It wasn't until Megan and I broke up that you could even remember my name.<eos> I have been waiting for this moment for years.<eos> I'm sorry I can't take everything that's important to you.
If there's any way I can possibly repay you...<eos> Well...<eos> And now we come to the portion of the ceremony that holds great significance, the vows.<eos> I understand you two have written your own?<eos> Yes.<eos> Megan, would you like to begin?<eos> Actually, Father...<eos> May I?<eos> Megan...<eos> I know I haven't made it easy for you.
Why don't y'all get out here and dance?<eos> Come on, that's what this dance floor is for. Yeah.<eos> What happened when you broke into the solo, though?<eos> So did you have fun?<eos> Oh, it was all right.<eos> All right?<eos> We got married, Brian McKnight sang your favorite song.<eos> - That was incredible.<eos> - What more do you want?<eos> Uh, well, you know. When we get to the room, I can show you.
Previously on "The Magicians"...<eos> Zillion bucks says The Beast comes back any minute, so what's the plan?<eos> Okay, so here's the thing.<eos> I can't really touch the knife.<eos> We need the power of a god.<eos> I have gifted you my Bestowal.
Okay, so here's the thing.<eos> I can't really touch the knife.<eos> We need the power of a god.<eos> I have gifted you my Bestowal.<eos> Imbibe it.<eos> The more it burns, the less time we have.<eos> There's a spell that seems strong enough.<eos> These are my students.<eos> They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.<eos> No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.
I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...<eos> The Beast can wait for five minutes.<eos> You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.<eos> Well, almost all of you.<eos> Just revel in your majesty for one fucking second.<eos> Be regal, miscreants.<eos> You're such a stupid, stupid, man.<eos> I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.<eos> El...<eos> El... El, you okay?
I mean, he'd want to booby-trap his kingdom, right?<eos> So apparently, he left curses behind.<eos> Here, actually.<eos> So you think Eliot might be cursed?<eos> I mean, she was vague, but I mean...<eos> Did either of you notice that Eliot started acting strangely once he took a drink from the goblet?<eos> I mean, it could be poison or a potion.<eos> All right, well, we probably shouldn't drink from ours just to be safe.<eos> Or maybe it was just some primo Fillorian shit that went up his nose, and he's on the bad end of a trip because he's him.<eos> Did something happen to you? Nope.
Few blocks away.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Take us back now.<eos> Well, we can't go back.<eos> Reynard's scented you before.<eos> If he smells you again, he won't show.<eos> If you want him, you might just have to risk losing your bait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're saying this now?<eos> Well, if I'd told you before, would you have agreed to it?
Heroin.<eos> I always suspected this was how I'd go.<eos> Potassium chloride will shut down the heart.<eos> Adrenaline will kick-start it.<eos> You die.<eos> Curse ends.<eos> I revive you.<eos> Except what if any part of that plan doesn't work?<eos> Look, asshole.<eos> You don't like my idea, why don't you go find someone else to save your annoying fucking life?
I bet you love coming here and fucking with mortals 'cause back home in god-land, you barely rank.<eos> Watch your mouth, or I'll slice out your tongue, and I'll eat it in front of you.<eos> You're really not getting the message that you don't scare me.<eos> Oh, I think I do scare you.<eos> So rare for someone to try to summon Our Lady on their own.<eos> You're all alone, aren't you?<eos> There's... no else in your life.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Trying to hurt my feelings?<eos> And the best you can come up with is "why couldn't you find a man?"
Get the other needles. Hurry.<eos> Hey!<eos> Stay back.<eos> Margo, we don't have time for this.<eos> We got to revive 'em now.<eos> What's best in life, Penny?<eos> What?<eos> What's best in life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women.
And not that you weren't amazing before, but...<eos> Quentin, where are you going with this?<eos> You've grown.<eos> And you're still growing, and my point is that I am too.<eos> Are you saying you're "not that guy anymore"?<eos> No, I'm saying that I'm not just that guy anymore, and I think that you...<eos> I hope that you give me the opportunity to be better and actually deserve you.<eos> And I know that that sounds stupid, but I just... I feel like we could die in, like, an hour, and it's giving me a lot of clarity right now.<eos> I don't know what to say, Quentin.<eos> Also, I'm gonna make you the best ice cream sundae you've ever had.
Alice.<eos> We can make a deal.<eos> Think of the fun we could have together.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> But I want to.<eos> Disappointing.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Alice!<eos> You got her attention. Now what?<eos> I'm sorry for all the times I was a total dick to you.
Yeah. It's gaining sentience.<eos> - [woman] Mmm. - [Troy] Did I do it right?<eos> - [Troy] Ah. - [woman] Mm-hmm. - [Troy] Oh, it feels so good.<eos> - [woman] Yeah.<eos> [Troy and woman moan]<eos> [Troy] Oh, fuck, right there.<eos> [Troy] Let's pick up some speed. - [woman] Yes!<eos> - [Troy] Okay.<eos> [Troy moaning] - [woman] Yes.<eos> - [Troy] All right, you like it?
I am.<eos> We cannot sit about and do nothing.<eos> [Troy] Things are being done as we speak. I said Reggie has a meeting with the dean today.<eos> If cops in the real world aren't held accountable, how can we expect a Winchester cop to suffer anything but a slap on the wrist?<eos> Exactly. We need to make an example out of that glorified security guard.<eos> Yo, I want to know who called the cops.<eos> Bring that fool to me right now.<eos> - [man] Yeah. - [woman] Exactly. What the fuck were these guys doing with guns in the first place?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Exactly. Brother Reggie, just know that our thoughts and prayers are with you...
- No, no, no, hear me out. You have Dear White People.<eos> I have Pastiche.<eos> Together, we have Dear White Pastiche or Pasty White People.<eos> It's totally your call either way. But the point is, we can make racism our bitch.<eos> Weren't you the one who brought us such feel-good hits as the lawn jockey issue and the blackface party?<eos> Well, that was actually our first collab if you think about it.<eos> I also wrote a piece called "The Cream in the Oreo"<eos> about my first mixed-racial threesome.<eos> People called it "an enlightening tale of race..."<eos> Kurt, I will never, ever, never, ever, ever collab with you on your piece of shit racist magazine.
Just my friends.<eos> I mean, they're starting to think you're imaginary. Besides, for some wackadoo reason, the more I see you, the more I miss you.<eos> Nice one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Reggie, uh, where are you?<eos> We all waited for you at the dean's office.<eos> Anyway, um,<eos> Gabe came up... we came up with this great idea to disrupt the rally tonight.<eos> Uh, call me back ASAP.<eos> You okay?
I can't get ahold of him.<eos> He's been MIA.<eos> [Vanessa] Well, makes sense.<eos> Public victim.<eos> Public what now? Well, in Behavioral Psych, we've been talking about how public victims don't have time to grieve because their trauma is immediately politicized, especially with social media and the 24-hour news cycle.<eos> They switched to Arabica beans.<eos> Reggie. Yo.<eos> What's up, Sam?<eos> [Sam] Hey. I've been looking for you all day.<eos> How are you?
Just glad I got the chance to share it with you.<eos> I can't believe I've been missing out on this.<eos> [chuckles] It's not that big a deal.<eos> It is a big deal.<eos> It was fearless... and honest.<eos> You know what?<eos> What if you shared it at the pep rally tonight?<eos> Sam.<eos> Reggie. Reggie.<eos> We'll make sure the blockade gives you space so you're not interrupted, and we'll even get you a bullhorn.
- [scoffs] If you can shake the earth at an open mic, you can shake the whole damn school.<eos> My pain is not your platform.<eos> The whole movement is about pain.<eos> That's why we're out in these streets, because of our pain.<eos> You don't think Martin had pain?<eos> You don't think Malcolm had pain? Right now, I just need to be a man and not a movement.<eos> Ever since freshman year, you have done nothing but look to me to be the leader of the movement.<eos> You've put it on me every single day.<eos> Don't you think there's a woman under here?<eos> Sam, I didn't mean to put anything on you.

On the back of the speech?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Forget it.<eos> "There's still time"?<eos> There's still time for what?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You and your husband.<eos> Getting ready to win an election.<eos> I see the way you're acting.<eos> Do you realize we have every intention of winning today?
Mm-hmm, that is not what you were wearing last night.<eos> Walks of shame are for the ratchet.<eos> Jackie O. or Marilyn?<eos> Is this some girl riddle where the only answer is I'm an asshole?<eos> When you get elected today, am I your Jackie O. or your Marilyn?<eos> I hate any hypothetical that ends with me getting shot in the head.<eos> All of the above?<eos> Mm, that doesn't work for everything.<eos> So, uh... see you later or are you rationing that so I don't get addicted?<eos> I'll text you.
Damn. This brother can do anything.<eos> Oh, Pastiche... is going to pay.<eos> Am I the only one who sees that this emperor is bare-ass naked?<eos> Look, I know we don't agree on a lot of things-- Most things.<eos> Like, all the things.<eos> Then vote for Aidan, Colin or Muffy if you can tell 'em apart.<eos> [Troy] Hey, ladies, having fun?<eos> Hardly.<eos> This display of toxic masculinity and peacocking perpetuates a rape culture on campus.<eos> Couldn't agree with you more, my sister.
It's important to vote, period.<eos> Whether on a collegiate, local or national level, what makes this country great is that we have the power to choose our leaders.<eos> And the broken vending machine in Bechet that gives two-for-one sodas?<eos> That also makes this country great.<eos> [laughing] [camera shutters clicking]<eos> My dad says if I lose, he's moving to Canada.<eos> Fingers crossed that I can remain stateside.<eos> -[woman] Yeah.<eos> If you'll excuse us a moment.<eos> Son, I'd like you to say hello to Neika Hobbs,
No, I realize we live in a delicate time rife with racial tensions.<eos> And my dad found out.<eos> Yeah, if you're so innocent, then why was I the one that called the cops and not you?<eos> [Kurt] 'Cause Sam invited people over.<eos> They showed up at my house, and, you know, purple drink ain't gonna serve itself, know what I mean?<eos> -I'm kidding. I'm kid-- look, Troy.<eos> If you get elected, you need to give me a pardon.<eos> -Not a governor.<eos> -A social pardon.<eos> I've been bailing you out since grade school.
You know, the BSU is pissed at you.<eos> And they're not wrong.<eos> What the fuck was that lawn jockey shit on your cover?<eos> It's a commentary on how people don't even know why they're angry anymore.<eos> The lawn jockey used to signal to slaves on the Underground Railroad if a house was safe.<eos> Where did you get that from?<eos> Wikipedia, man.<eos> You are tiptoeing towards "piece of shit," man.<eos> Oh, so Sam's the only one who's allowed to be provocative?<eos> -[phone dings] -[Kurt] If you threw a white-face party, I'd defend you.
Why are you living yours for him?<eos> He pays my room and board?<eos> Today at Armstrong-Parker, I told everyone how bad I wanted to fight for them.<eos> And you know what?<eos> What?<eos> Think I meant it.<eos> Then why did you vote for someone else?<eos> You don't think you deserve to wear that crown?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Let me let you in on a little secret.
Here you go. Let's get you inside.<eos> Can't let this beautiful chocolate melt in the rain.<eos> I'm Troy.<eos> And I basically grew up here, so... if you need anything, I'm your man.<eos> [Coco] What about Professor Jackson's lazy eye, though?<eos> I mean, I can never tell if he's looking me in the eyes or at my boobs.<eos> -[Muffy] Oh, it's both.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> [laughing]<eos> Thanks, Reggie, but I only live one flight up from you.

[moans] Beauty is pain.<eos> Do you guys know what you're doing?<eos> Providing a public service.<eos> Where else you gonna get your hair did around here?<eos> Yeah, black hair matters.<eos> What are your majors?<eos> Neurobiology.<eos> -And yours, Tanika?<eos> Tanika dropped out last semester and won't leave.<eos> -Ain't nobody talking to you, Abigail.
You think I'll overdose if I take the whole bottle?<eos> I look too cute to die tonight. [groans]<eos> [exhales deeply] [inhales deeply] Oh, yeah.<eos> Here... hit this.<eos> What is this?<eos> This is Goldie.<eos> Goldie, meet Coco.<eos> This is the answer to all of your weave-related ailments.<eos> From me to my best friend.<eos> Girl, who sold you this?
Don't Assata Shakur me.<eos> I told you about Assata Shakur.<eos> And what would she say about you overdrawing your bank account for a weave?<eos> You have a rat's nest on your head with a comb sticking out of it, running around campus trying to be Miss Blackety Black-Black.<eos> I wanted an avant-garde look, like Solange-- something that says, "I'm woke, but I'll also kick your ass in an elevator."<eos> Dear white people, let me tell you about yourselves when I don't even know who the hell I am.<eos> Oh, I don't know who I am, Colandrea?<eos> No, you don't, but I do.<eos> You're the girl who didn't learn she was black until Beth Wheeler left you out of her second-grade sleepover 'cause you'd be "the only one."<eos> That is the last time I share a personal story with you.

So, yeah, I tone it down, make myself more palatable, join a sorority.<eos> What's so wrong with that? [scoffs] Everything.<eos> Dear white people, you made me hate myself as a kid, so now I hate you, and that's my secret shame.<eos> Dear white people, if you wanted to demoralize us with your European beauty standards, mission accomplished.<eos> Dear white people, you're a selfish bitch, and I don't want to live with you anymore.

[Karen] Coco, I'm so glad you're here.<eos> This guy acts like he doesn't know who I am.<eos> Well, do you know these girls? I do!<eos> -Oh. -What?<eos> -[sighs] -[Muffy] Are you okay? [inhales deeply]<eos> I just had my first powergasm.<eos> Would you like to have your second?<eos> Oh, okay, how about another drink?<eos> No, um... not while I'm standing here.<eos> "It's my 'light-skinned privilege' to give you this peace offering. Sam."

Well, a bit. I just wanted to get the ball rolling.<eos> But even then it didn't work because you only sold it for four grand.<eos> It cost you 14.000 to make so you cost our production company ã10.000.<eos> No, no, not true.<eos> - I put a reserve on it. - What reserve?<eos> ã100.000.<eos> - So it didn't sell at all, which means you cost us ã14.000?<eos> Well, yes, but we've ended up with The Excellent.<eos> No, we're stuck with The Excellent.<eos> It's really difficult to know, working with you, things like this, is it ambition or are you a lunatic?
- Alice Cooper.<eos> - Ridiculous again.<eos> - Half of The Eagles.<eos> - Which half?<eos> - Glenn Frey.<eos> - I don't like that half.<eos> Nashville. Right, what's come out of here?<eos> Miley Cyrus.<eos> Brilliant!<eos> - You just said that out loud on television.
You see, I say you don't need to buy a BMW M3 because for £11,000 less you can have a Jaguar XE S, which is nicer to drive, more comfortable and just as fast.<eos> - It isn't just as fast.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - They both do 155mph.<eos> Yes, because the BMW has been electronically limited to 155.<eos> The Jag is just... limited. Sorry to interrupt.<eos> It's just that both my colleagues are wrong.<eos> Because if you want a small, fast saloon car, what you absolutely have to have...<eos> If you're gonna start going on about that Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio, I am gonna stab you in the eye with this pen.
OK. And we start with this. It's the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio.<eos> - For God's sake!<eos> - This is important news.<eos> It's not important news.<eos> It's niche news for morons.<eos> It's not!<eos> It's a superb car, because you can have it with the same 500 horsepower engine that you get in the Quadriplegio.<eos> And with that... with that you get four-wheel-drive.<eos> So that one will work in the wet, will it?<eos> Hammond, when somebody has a baby, OK, do you go up to it and... "Look at my new baby that I've...
Well, he'll have made a statement of some sort, so...<eos> Freight ship. Full-on freight ship.<eos> Or a tanker.<eos> He hasn't overdone it.<eos> Is that him?<eos> What is the point of that?<eos> Will you come and tie it up?<eos> That's the worst boat I've ever seen. That's awful!<eos> - What's the matter with it? - Well, it...<eos> We gave you $5,000 to buy a boat.
When do we drink our own urine?<eos> Look at that thing now!<eos> Bloody Nora!<eos> That is just... fabulous!<eos> I could have buzzed around this amazing machine all day, but there was still important environmental work to do.<eos> So, reluctantly, I broke off to rejoin my stranded colleagues.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Well, no!<eos> We've just been left to drift in a Land Rover!<eos> Fortunately for you, none of these ceramic tiles is loose, otherwise I'd chuck it at your head.
Add a device.<eos> - Pardon?<eos> Add a device.<eos> Using the pair function and the external device...<eos> He was brilliant.<eos> That is the problem.<eos> That is the problem, but, Hammond, i have a solution. Ok?<eos> No, don't scoff. Don't scoff.<eos> This is a system that is cheap, works anywhere in the world, and you can fit it to any car, no matter how old it is.<eos> Let me show you how it works, ok?
It's just a man!<eos> It's gavril from Bulgaria.<eos> He can do anything. Right, select drive.<eos> There you go.<eos> Call bell-end.<eos> Now, he picks up the phone, he does all the dialling. My hands are on the wheel, I'm safe.<eos> He holds it next to my ear so it's hands-free.<eos> Who's bell-end?<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to talk to you.
That doesn't get any worse.<eos> Hello, and welcome!<eos> Welcome to The Grand Tour, which, once again, comes to you from the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland.<eos> The reason why we're still here is, after last week's show, these two got talking to a man in the local town, who has convinced them that, in that lake, there is a monster.<eos> Well, there is a monster.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> No, but the man was very convincing.<eos> Did he sell you a tea towel with a drawing of the monster on it?
I maxed the Range Rover at 149.<eos> And James May, because he's a blithering idiot, 6,000rpm.<eos> The idiot's car had also drained its tank, so while he was filling up, I set up another of my clever demonstrations.<eos> Gentlemen, observe.<eos> You can buy very expensive sunglasses.<eos> These ones are made from real gold.<eos> Or you can buy very cheap sunglasses.<eos> But what do we all do?<eos> We all have Ray-Bans.<eos> You do know you're just being irritating, don't you?
Yeah, sure.<eos> Here. Take this one.<eos> What?<eos> Those teens won't say no to Bridgeville's star quarterback.<eos> Go long.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, babe, nothing was gonna happen.<eos> Maybe you just listen to me once, you know, instead of always listening to your asshole friend.<eos> Hope you geniuses aren't planning another science experiment.<eos> Hey, if I'm looking to get date raped, I'll invite you into the conversation.
Have you seen him?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You should...<eos> You should stay here, get some rest.<eos> I haven't slept in two days.<eos> You can, put it in the garage.<eos> Please tell me why we're lying to this poor bastard.<eos> We should tell him.<eos> He has a working car, and in case you haven't noticed, we're kinda stuck here.
I didn't like the dark either, until my dad found a cure.<eos> He made up a story called "The Owl Who Says What."<eos> He even wrote a book about it.<eos> Owls say, "Who."<eos> Yeah, not this one.<eos> The other owls left him by himself alone in the dark, because he was different.<eos> - Was he scared?<eos> - Yeah, but he discovers a way not to be afraid of the dark.<eos> How?<eos> I could read it to you if you want.
No!<eos> Alex!<eos> Look, I didn't know she was in there. Mom!<eos> - You can't go in there.<eos> It's not safe! - Lila!<eos> Run, baby!<eos> Run!<eos> Lila!<eos> Eve.<eos> You okay?
Alex!<eos> Look, I didn't know she was in there. Mom!<eos> - You can't go in there.<eos> It's not safe! - Lila!<eos> Run, baby!<eos> Run!<eos> Lila!<eos> Eve.<eos> You okay?<eos> You okay?
She knew she was dying, yet she didn't hate Him.<eos> She loved Him for the life He had given her.<eos> Please don't let her down by listening to Nathalie.<eos> Father, you're needed.<eos> She's talking about the Black Spring again, and they are listening.<eos> Father.<eos> - Hi.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> It was interesting, you know, what we did.<eos> What, me beating the shit out of you?
We're leaving.<eos> It was interesting, you know, what we did.<eos> What, me beating the shit out of you?<eos> Yeah, that was interesting.<eos> See you around, I guess.<eos> Yeah, see ya.<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Adrian?<eos> - I gave you the keys, Adrian!
Alex, is that you?<eos> Please help!<eos> Please!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Help!<eos> Jay, please hurry!<eos> Jay, hurry!<eos> Be careful!<eos> Jay!<eos> Are you okay?
Did you do this?<eos> Did you lock me in there so you could play hero?<eos> What? ! I heard someone screaming.<eos> I didn't even know it was you!<eos> Then who was it?<eos> How should I know?<eos> You really think I could have done this? !<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck you, okay?<eos> ! I do everything I can to be nice to you, to help.
I didn't even know it was you!<eos> Then who was it?<eos> How should I know?<eos> You really think I could have done this? !<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck you, okay?<eos> ! I do everything I can to be nice to you, to help.<eos> I just saved your goddamn life, and you just continue to repay me with paranoia!<eos> What were you doing here?<eos> I was looking for you to see if I could stay at the loading dock.
- You know what!<eos> You must repent and embrace God. - Link.<eos> - Repent, and embrace God.<eos> He said, "The Lord is faithful and that He will... He will strengthen and protect us from the evil one."<eos> You think I'm evil, Link?<eos> You're leading them astray.<eos> Embrace Him!<eos> It's His house!<eos> - You'll respect Him!<eos> - Link, let me help you. No!
30 seconds later, dogs appeared in the mist, her dogs.<eos> She was so happy to see them.<eos> Then they ate her.<eos> It reacts to us somehow on a physiological level.<eos> I just don't know how yet, but if I can find out, then I can save people.<eos> This will slow your metabolism and your hormone output.<eos> Maybe I can slow how the mist reacts to us.<eos> If it doesn't attack after around 30 seconds, I'll know I'm on the right track.<eos> What's the matter, sweetie?<eos> Is your mind playing tricks on you?

Mom?<eos> Mm, baby doll.<eos> Every day, I tried to say it, but I could never get the words out.<eos> Say what?<eos> I love you.<eos> I wish I had been better.<eos> Don't you wish you could have been a better daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.
Come on.<eos> Quick.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom!<eos> No!<eos> I told you to stay away from her! Mom, stop!<eos> He saved me.<eos> Saved you?<eos> From what?<eos> What happened to you?
What... What is that?<eos> They just started coming down outside.<eos> It's the State Guard.<eos> They're coming!<eos> It's so wonderful.<eos> How long do you think it'll take?<eos> It could be today.<eos> Come in.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> I'll tell you later.
It's in process, but, Clarke, it isn't gonna be an easy ride.<eos> What don't I know?<eos> With the secret of Praimfaya out, I sent Echo and my army back to Polis to keep the peace.<eos> That's good.<eos> We need peace to distribute the cure.<eos> More than half of them deserted on the way.<eos> With the end coming, they want to be home.<eos> I don't blame them.<eos> Do you blame them for burning Trikru villages as they go?<eos> That's funny coming from you.
That's funny coming from you.<eos> Enough.<eos> We know the woods are a war zone.<eos> After what happened with Ilian, I can't spare many of the guard to protect you.<eos> My security detail can protect us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's very generous.<eos> We are all in this together now.<eos> I'm gonna check on Octavia before we go.<eos> Clarke, I'm going with you.
Brace for impact.<eos> Aah!<eos> - Jeez. - Mission failed.<eos> All work and no play makes raven a dull girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> All right?<eos> I have had enough of your stupid, little jokes.<eos> Why don't you take it easy, huh?<eos> You're just a self-loathing bottom-feeder.<eos> Abby's an idiot for trusting you.
It's ok.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> She'll be all right.<eos> Will you?<eos> The darkness can kiss my worthless ass.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You're the new Raven-sitter.<eos> Is it Octavia?<eos> Keep your eyes on the trees.<eos> She hasn't forgiven you, has she?

You don't know me very well.<eos> I know that you stole medicine to save Adria.<eos> I know that you saved Raven from the drones.<eos> And I'm definitely rethinking that decision right about now.<eos> I know what it's like to hate yourself, John.<eos> Because of the color of my blood, I was raised to be a killer.<eos> The Flamekeepers harnessed my rage and taught me it was nobility.<eos> For years, I reveled in death and violence.<eos> I killed my own brother.<eos> So trust me when I tell you, if I found peace... you can.
Fly it yourself.<eos> Switching to manual.<eos> Murphy!<eos> Thanks.<eos> We have to get to them before they get to Polis with that fuel.<eos> They'll use it to make bombs.<eos> They'll kill everyone.<eos> You mean they'll use it to kill Ice Nation.<eos> All you care about is your own people.<eos> Yeah, like you're any better.
Whose murder?<eos> Who is making this accusation?<eos> No.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Hello, Father.<eos> This is not real.<eos> This is some kind of nightmare or... a vision, or...<eos> Is this a dead girl which I see before me?<eos> But I was in my rooms, and then, um...<eos> I assure you I am as real as the guilt in your heaving heart.
She knew all too well the risks of engaging in battle.<eos> And I would die a thousand deaths if it meant she would live but one more hour.<eos> But in the end she made a choice.<eos> And what of me, Father?<eos> Was I a soldier, too?<eos> Do you recognize this box?<eos> I spent 200 years in it.<eos> Eating dirt.<eos> Breathing in my own filth.<eos> Because of you.
Henry...<eos> I didn't know you existed.<eos> No.<eos> Because you were too busy soldiering.<eos> Be honest with yourself... if you had known that Mother was with child, would anything have changed?<eos> Would you have done anything differently?<eos> You're right.<eos> The first duty of a parent is to protect their child.<eos> A... A friend reminded me of that only recently.<eos> I will always regret what happened to you, Henry.
We can get it.<eos> W-Wait, you have access to the Smithsonian storage units?<eos> - W... - Well, if by access you mean do we have a way to sneak in and take stuff without people knowing? Then, yeah, we got access.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Look, we... always put everything back.<eos> Mostly everything.<eos> I don't want to know this.<eos> I don't want to know this.<eos> What?<eos> You are loving this, aren't you?
Leather balls?<eos> Takes one to know one.<eos> A hundred a pound.<eos> Cash.<eos> We'll take all of it.<eos> Pay the man.<eos> Semper Gumby, right?<eos> Semper Gumby.<eos> Marines.<eos> I'm telling you, the guy went full-on demon and I saw pictures of him when I was researching the Banneker folio. And guess what?
You are guilty.<eos> Always will be.<eos> It is inevitable.<eos> You know what you have to do.<eos> Good-bye, Father.<eos> He's over there.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> That cannot be comfortable.<eos> Wouldn't want to see his dry cleaning bill.<eos> Okay, remember I showed you how to control the flow.
Previously on "The Path"...<eos> - I'm moving into the city.<eos> I don't want to talk about it. I've already decided. It's a done thing.<eos> - I would like to invite you to climb to 2R.
Be The Light.<eos> Righteous and good.<eos> Give me your strength, your patience.<eos> Righteous and good.<eos> - Hey.<eos> The hell is wrong with you, man? Are you trying to give me a heart attack?<eos> - This was your idea.<eos> I'm the one holding the bag of burgers in the middle of the woods.<eos> - That's right. - What if a bear came at me?<eos> - Well, then he would be doing you a favor.
- Just give me the results for the water.<eos> - McClusky shut that down. - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why? - I think Penetti's been on his ass.<eos> They want these guys out of commission, pronto.<eos> - That's bullshit.<eos> - What does the water have to do with your case?<eos> Just get Penetti something and get the fuck out of there.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> What's going on with you?
You should come inside after. We have some boots that might fit you better.<eos> - I have boots. - That's fine.<eos> You can take them both.<eos> Whatever you want. I'm Hawk.<eos> - Daniel.<eos> It's good to meet you, sir.<eos> Mom?<eos> - I didn't recognize you at first.<eos> - Uh, yeah. - It's different. I know.<eos> - Looks good on you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and I don't know...<eos> I'm a little scared, you know, 'cause I don't know how it's gonna be, and, um... no.<eos> No, Mom, I'm not... that's...<eos> No, that's not what I'm saying, I'm...<eos> No, Mom, that's... no, please.<eos> Don't come, okay?<eos> Just don't come.<eos> I'm fine. I just... I wanted...<eos> I wanted just to tell you, you know?
I nearly forfeited that for this.<eos> I've been acting out of anger, rage.<eos> - You've been acting out of loyalty to Steve.<eos> Don't lose sight of that.<eos> - Following Eddie led me back there.<eos> To the war. The men whose lives I took.<eos> That was no coincidence.<eos> I was made to see that.<eos> I am no longer the man who committed those atrocities.<eos> - It was Steve who helped you see that.
- No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> In a way. I don't think you're living up to your full potential. - What?<eos> - I don't think you're doing everything you can for the movement.<eos> I know you and your mom don't have the easiest relationship,<eos> - but I think if you...<eos> - I mean, denying where you come from and who you are and all the good that money could do for so many people.<eos> - Don't do this, Hawk. - But you say you want to help people. This is how you can make the greatest impact.<eos> - Did your mom ever leave you stranded at a friend's birthday party for hours after everyone else had gone home?<eos> Your friends' parents just staring at you, not knowing what to do with you except never invite you back, obviously.
What... what does the faith of the appraiser have to do with anything?<eos> - Maybe a conflict of interest, given your urgent need for this loan.<eos> But it is extraneous.<eos> The truth is, trying to add debt on top of accumulating losses is a step toward bankruptcy.<eos> - She hates surprises.<eos> - That's all I'm saying.<eos> - Here, put this in the car for me.<eos> Hey, Eddie, is everything okay?<eos> - Better than...<eos> - We're, uh... We're coming to see you.
- Better than...<eos> - We're, uh... We're coming to see you.<eos> What?<eos> Eddie, no.<eos> The wedding's in a couple hours, and I'm coming right home after that.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, we thought it'd be fun...<eos> Hang out at the beach all day...<eos> Until you're done. Then we can road trip back together.<eos> Eddie, are you sure that everything's okay?<eos> Eddie, I'm sorry, I just... this is so sweet of you, and I'm just really tired and these girls are really insane, and I just...
We need to help her mother.<eos> - No, I don't need a ride, thank you.<eos> What?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I need you get in the car, sweetheart.<eos> - No, Mom, look, I...<eos> Mom, I can't do that, okay?<eos> - Sean, listen to your mother.<eos> - Sean, my name is Wendy Kennair.<eos> She's gonna help you, Sean.
He's traveling.<eos>  I'm sorry to say,<eos> Brenda is suffering from liver failure,<eos> And she's been placed in hospice care.<eos>  How long does she have?<eos>  We don't like to make predictions, but it could be any time.<eos> If you could help us contact him, that would be very help<eos>  Yes, I'll do that right away.<eos>  Hi, baby.  You're hurting me.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm just so happy you're okay. Let me see you?
 You okay, bud?<eos>  I fell asleep, and when I got up,<eos> Eddie was gone.  God.<eos> I'm so sorry this happened. Well, relax.<eos> We're gonna go home, okay? We're gonna just talk all about this later, okay?  Okay.<eos>  You better believe we will.<eos> How could you leave our son with that psycho?<eos>  Benson.  That's what he is. His whole family is.<eos>  Stop. Please.<eos>  What the hell's wrong with you?
 This isn't a surprise.<eos> This is the least surprising thing you could tell me.<eos>  She says she has something to say.<eos> Are you with her?<eos> Yes, and she seems so small and frightened.<eos> And I have been with people on the threshold before, but this something's holding her back.<eos>  Yeah, well, that's it's not possible.<eos> I'm out here on the other end of the earth, trying to fix my fuckup.<eos> Look.<eos> Can I,  can I just say that this... this may have more of an impact on you than you think.
But what I'm offering you is a chance to feel unlimited fulfillment.<eos> Not joy, all right?<eos> When you take The Light into your heart, you unlock something infinite.<eos>  It's like an elevator in a tower with no limits that just keeps going as far as you can imagine.<eos>  Why do I feel like I'm at some timeshare place?<eos> Who is he, Jackie?<eos>  He runs a cult.<eos> -  No. No. - Really?<eos> -  No, we're not a cult. - But, listen.<eos> Noa, my daughter, has been there. He has helped her so much, and I thought that he could help you too.
Is it over?<eos> All of this?<eos>  No.<eos> Of course not. We're handling it.<eos> Cal and I together, we're handling this.<eos>  Lately, at the center, when someone has a problem or someone needs help with anything, they come to me, and I help them if I can, and if I can't,<eos> I tell them straightup.<eos> Because they know I'll be honest with them, even when the truth hurts.<eos>  The Movement is stronger than ever.<eos> In you, clearly.
He took me there.<eos> I saw... what it could be.<eos> I felt love. I felt forgiveness.<eos> I felt peace.<eos>  Eddie.<eos> Come in.<eos>  Is Johnny here?<eos> Please tell me.<eos>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's okay?  He's fine. He's fine, but where the fuck were you?<eos> Where did you go? What  I'm gonna tell you what happened.
Disappear.<eos>  Just take your keys and go.<eos> Just keep driving. Till you're far away.<eos> Till you feel safe.<eos>  I can do that?  Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos>  I can do that.  You should.<eos>  I should.<eos>  Cal.<eos> I'm so glad it's you. I have to tell you, um, your mom, she passed.
I wanted you to know the check that we were hoping for, I can't I can't get it after all.<eos>  Did you hear what I just said?<eos> I know that I'm failing you.<eos> Wish there was another way, but...<eos> Sarah, I don't I don't think that I could live with the person I've become Iif...  It's okay.<eos> No.<eos> No, it isn't.  Not right now, but it will be.<eos> I will see to it.<eos>  What did she need to tell me so badly anyway?<eos> Did you find out?  She wanted to apologize.

Don't wait until it's too late to be a good mother.<eos>  I have something for you.<eos>  Was this Steve's?<eos> It was the first one made for him after The Ladder was revealed.<eos> I took it off him when we found his body.<eos> I kept it safe.<eos> Wasn't even sure why.<eos> Until now. No, Richard.<eos> I can't accept this.<eos>  The Light is in you.  No.
 Richard.<eos> What, this?<eos> Look, that's the lightning.<eos> What?<eos>  Is it?<eos> You know.<eos> No.<eos> You will build The Garden.<eos> Richard, I just...<eos> And we will follow you there.
I know, but...<eos> He's gone.<eos> And we got to move. The wreck's a beacon.<eos> I know these mountains.<eos> I can get us home.<eos> Travis would want that.<eos> You don't know what Travis would want.<eos> Joe.<eos> Man, who'd you piss off the draw guard again, huh?<eos> Your father wants to talk to you.
But you got to give me the gun.<eos> Do it, Nick.<eos> Give him the gun.<eos> Get her to the infirmary. Yes, sir.<eos> Secure her before you treat her.<eos> All right, everybody, that's enough fun.<eos> The show's over.<eos> Go back to doing what you were doing.<eos> Go in there, get yourself looked after.<eos> - Mom, I want to be with you.
I truly am.<eos> Well, he's a good man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> I'm sure he was... to be with a woman like you.<eos> The handcuffs really necessary?<eos> They are just in case, yeah.<eos> Thank you for bringing her back.<eos> Alicia?<eos> Yeah?<eos> You okay?
Not sure I can do that.<eos> The hell you can't, Nick.<eos> You don't know what sets him off.<eos> He doesn't know what sets him off.<eos> Okay, but if we stay, we need to do something.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I'm doing something.<eos> No, what do you mean, Nick?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Do you want my knife?
What happened to you out there?<eos> The boar's back.<eos> Keeps digging up the fence posts to get to the cabbage.<eos> Could use an extra pair of hands tracking it tonight.<eos> Stay away from Madison and her family.<eos> They're my friends.<eos> They came here under my invite.<eos> They trust me.<eos> They came here not to get eaten. I wouldn't flatter yourself.<eos> Yeah, but they're staying 'cause I said I'd protect them from you.
It was that night, because we were never sure we were gonna close the deal.<eos> Thomas's counter was aggressive.<eos> Either way, the sun had come up, and you and Thomas were making crepes chocolates on a bonfire of God knows what.<eos> It was the wood case of the Vino Hormaechea '89.<eos> And all the while I was singing Juan Gabriel to a cactus.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Oh, man. I'm...<eos> I'm assuming...<eos> Thomas did not...?<eos> So, you escaped this hotel in this crazy woman's car, and all you have with you are your wits and charms and this crunchy suede coat?
Easy.<eos> ¿Qué?<eos> This man was cartel before the fall. His function was to take from honest people and to kill those who refused.<eos> Which he did.<eos> See, in my world now, there is no room for such people.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey...<eos> Dime... did you truly think that we were friends in the old world?<eos> We made each other money.<eos> That's very American of you, Victor.

You want what is not yours.
I mean, people would suspect you, but... well, they really wouldn't know for sure.<eos> I wonder how long it'll take you to turn.<eos> Eighty-seven minutes.<eos> Eighty-seven minutes given my weight, BMI, age.<eos> You know, if you do do it, you should time it.<eos> Journal's in my pocket.<eos> You are not a scientist.<eos> Time it.<eos> Nick... please.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Troy here is gonna take a party out, but we're gonna need volunteers.<eos> Blake. Mike.<eos> Coop.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> And Madison Clark.<eos> All right, everybody, enjoy your meal.<eos> Your kids are over there.<eos> I know.<eos> I knew you would drink it all.<eos> I told you I'd be your guardian angel.
Hey, Dante's not going to be happy about...<eos> Hey, you're making a mistake!<eos> You're making a mistake!<eos> You see?<eos> I told you I would be your guardian angel.
Daniel... she is alive.<eos> She's holed up in a hotel down the coast. Rosarito.<eos> It'll take us a day to get there.<eos> Maybe less.<eos> Hey... get me out of here and I'll take you to her.<eos> We can get there by morning.<eos> She's waiting for you.<eos> She's waiting for me?<eos> Daniel...<eos> I don't believe you.
Hey... get me out of here and I'll take you to her.<eos> We can get there by morning.<eos> She's waiting for you.<eos> She's waiting for me?<eos> Daniel...<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> What's not to believe?<eos> She survived the fire.<eos> We found the hotel.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Tell me about it.<eos> So, to what do we owe this delightfully unexpected visit from my ex sister-in-law?<eos> I came as soon as I heard the news.<eos> I had to see the miracle for myself.<eos> And what news is that, darling?<eos> - Our retched king's cancer.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You mean the big news.<eos> In fact, the only news anyone is talking about round here.<eos> So, come for a front-row seat to his misery, have you?
I'm sorry, Your Highness. That was a really bad joke. An American joke.<eos> They're all bad.<eos> An American working for the British royal family.<eos> How did you end up here, mate?<eos> We scour the world for the best, don't we?<eos> Jasper's the one that found out about Dad's murderer.<eos> And yours, it turns out.<eos> Not MI6, not Scotland Yard, this guy.<eos> Jasper Frost. My boyfriend.<eos> Mm, I wanted to introduce you because I thought that you should know what's going on.
I mean, everyone here knows.<eos> Um, Liam really loves him.<eos> And Mum, too.<eos> Well, I'd like to shake the hand of the man who found my father's murderer.<eos> And of course, I have high standards for my only sister, but... it's sure a hell of a start.<eos> Once again, inspiration comes from a most unexpected place.<eos> A sincere thank you.<eos> Now, to make sure it sticks.<eos> What in the name of the risen Christ?<eos> The only way I was ever able to ensure that you'd completely process something was by following it up with a shag to cement it in.
I don't... feel well.<eos> I get it's a ton to process.<eos> You should get some sleep.<eos> Once you're over the shock, we can catch up. - Um, sorry.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's not every day a zombie leans in to kiss you.<eos> You need time, it's natural.<eos> And I have no expectations.<eos> I just thought I owed you a visit in person.
You won't have to for much longer, old boy.<eos> Tomorrow... you'll be invisible.<eos> I'm sorry I never called.<eos> The night before you, um, the accident, we had a call scheduled and I didn't call because I was... wasted.<eos> And I made this promise with myself that I would never call you when I'm wasted.<eos> And it's been eating me up ever since that day.<eos> I-I can't say I can remember.<eos> So, absolutely let go of that one, okay?<eos> But you seem great now.<eos> I don't know if Dad would agree with you.
So...<eos> It's important, isn't it?<eos> The last conversation you have with someone.<eos> Especially our father.<eos> - He was harsh on us.<eos> But he had a lot of expectation.<eos> As he should have.<eos> - We are the royal family.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> But I am so proud of who you have become.
Now it is something people can make a business out of.<eos> [in Afrikaans] I found this place and cleaned it up by myself.<eos> Before me, it was a dump.<eos> There was dirt, rubbish and diapers.<eos> But I saw it as a spot where I could work.<eos> I started with rusted corrugated iron.<eos> And people thought, "What good can come from here?"<eos> I want people to see that you can always find a way to make a living.<eos> They must know that God gave them hands, a brain and ears.<eos> And when He gave you these things, it wasn't for someone else.
The fact that you're standing around a fire, braaiing a raw piece of meat.<eos> What I really like about organizing a big braai is the opportunity to meet new people.<eos> People are not necessarily friends and they don't necessarily stay friends but they can interact.<eos> Unfortunately, growing up with an Afrikaans upbringing... I was 18 years old towards the end of the Apartheid.<eos> I was raised to fear black South Africans.<eos> Um, although it wasn't intentional, we were all raised with this idea that it was dangerous to know black people.<eos> Everyone treated black people as if they were inferior, um, as if they couldn't do the same things that white people did. Um, which is unfortunate, because as children, you're easily influenced in the way you think.<eos> Obviously, when you're a teenager, you start to think differently.<eos> Luckily for me, things started changing.<eos> You make up your own mind, and you start to figure out that people are just people.
Chops, sausages, google eggs, a bit of onion, and bread and butter, salt and pepper, dead horse.<eos> That's it. That's the barbecue.<eos> I'd like to see salmon patties on there, but no one's done that yet.<eos> Nah, just bacon, eggs, snags.<eos> Just your basic shit.<eos> That's what a barbecue is.<eos> It's not like putting a hangi down, where you've got to spend hours and hours.<eos> Barbecue, you should be able to start it up, crank it up. Over and done with in half an hour, everybody's sitting down having a feed.<eos> As long as you've got someone decent cooking!<eos> Hey, how are you?
If there is such a thing as being reborn, I'd like to be born as a Mongolian again.<eos> [indistinct chatter] [in Swedish] Like this.<eos> It becomes an extreme... form of depression when it's very cold for a long period.<eos> You get tired, and feel down.<eos> You don't have the happiness and willingness to do stuff, create stuff, be creative.<eos> You get bunkered in, just laying around watching TV.<eos> And the very second the sun starts shining, there's some kind of euphoria in people.<eos> And in some way, you have to go out, you have to do stuff outside.<eos> You have to take the opportunity to experience the sun, the warmth, for as long as you have it.<eos> You have to fill up on sunlight, so that you have the memory of it for the rest of the year.
The Armenian soul is fire and flames.<eos> I have loved sculpture since childhood.<eos> You have to be in a good mood to make a sculpture.<eos> If you are angry, you can't make a sculpture.<eos> Making khorovats is an art too.<eos> You have to be eager, put your soul into it, to make the khorovats tasty.<eos> The interesting thing is, you make it with your own hands, and then you enjoy it.<eos> That's the best thing, that you make it with your own hands and put your soul into it.<eos> And then enjoy it with your friends and family.<eos> People that are close to you.

And Edgar and I decided that was not right, we just did not like that at all.<eos> And so, we were going to take the sign down and we did!<eos> And we had some of our customers say,<eos> "Well, we'll never be back to your restaurant!"<eos> And he says, "Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, but this is the way it needs to be."<eos> We just thought it was something that needed to be done.<eos> And we wanted to be a part of trying to get it to where we felt like all people should be equal.<eos> So I guess it was just something that he and I really felt deep in our hearts, that needed to be done.<eos> In life, the only way you're going to get ahead is that you gotta work for it.<eos> You know, nobody's just going to just drop something in your lap.
It's just a game to you.<eos> No, it's not a game.<eos> It's my calling.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> How'd you escape the fire?<eos> We all had you for dead.<eos> I was spared.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I don't have a home waiting for me in heaven.<eos> Maybe it was the devil that wants me down here with you.
Or I'll feed every goddamn one of you to the crows.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We need water.<eos> You want your message delivered, give us water to get back.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Madison Clark.<eos> You bought into a lost cause, Madison Clark.<eos> It became my cause when you shot down the helicopter.<eos> You took someone of mine.<eos> I wanna show you something.
It's truth.<eos> And I'm talking about before the apocalypse.<eos> Doubt it's improved much since.<eos> You say what you want, but the man I saw yesterday was a threat.<eos> He had command.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You got a little crush?<eos> We gotta tell people something.<eos> You talk to them.<eos> It's good they start hearing more from you anyway, Jake.
But he never quit on me. Never.<eos> Even when others did.<eos> He didn't quit on you, Troy.<eos> He just stood by his family.<eos> He wouldn't look at me.<eos> He just...<eos> Hard to know how to react to something like that.<eos> You make sure no one else leaves.<eos> Save them from the same mistake.<eos> I'll help you.
No, thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> You?<eos> Especially me. I'm high on life.<eos> I like that.<eos> Hey, slow down.<eos> Slow down.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> You know that song,<eos> "can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with"?
Your home. Your gun.<eos> There's blood in it.<eos> It's in the earth.<eos> It's in the earth.<eos> Bible study?<eos> Jake's.<eos> Jake?<eos> It's nothing serious.<eos> The rhythm method is bullshit.<eos> I told you that, right?
I'll sleep like a baby.<eos> Say it was Troy.<eos> It was.<eos> No one would believe us.<eos> They're more afraid of what's out there than anything he could do.<eos> You should've told me first before you did this.<eos> You would've said no.<eos> No. I get it.<eos> I hate it, I get it.<eos> I would have backed you like I'm backing you now.
I was worried.<eos> Vernon and Kathy?<eos> - And Gretchen.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> Talking to Walker right now, it's not a good idea.<eos> This... this makes it more urgent, more reason to go, not less.<eos> When I said for you to own it, I didn't mean this.<eos> I'm not doing this because of what you said, Alicia.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Vernon Trimbol's dead, too.<eos> I hope it was a long and... painful illness.<eos> He died with his family.<eos> His wife, his daughter.<eos> You killed them.<eos> Is this girl speaking for you?<eos> We need the violence to stop.<eos> Soon will, Jake.<eos> Three down, one to go.<eos> My father never did anything to you or your people.
Let's not spook the young recruits, huh?<eos> Here.<eos> How the hell'd you get here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Tell it.<eos> Tell me, then I'll tell you how I tried to find you and almost got goddamn eaten, how we all almost died because you took the truck and the hotel was overrun.<eos> Alicia, I thought it was safe.<eos> - We checked every room. - Nowhere is safe.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I almost died after that.
- His daughter was my friend.<eos> - No, there was no...<eos> There was no mission two nights ago.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Taqa goes out with the war parties.<eos> - He didn't.<eos> - He was with me.<eos> We have a parley.<eos> I need you to go back and tell my father the terms.<eos> Taqa will send a scout with you.
You're staying here?<eos> We swap hostages and offer tribute.<eos> Jake, your father's not gonna listen to me.<eos> - He barely knows me.<eos> - Alicia... this is the only way to put off their attack.<eos> Taqa guarantees my safety.<eos> His word is good.<eos> Then I'll stay.<eos> - No.<eos> - Jake, your father needs to hear this from you.
Fair?<eos> Say it's fair.<eos> It's fair.<eos> I'll have someone bring you in some food.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> They'll bring it anyway.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> I'm trying to rescue you, okay?<eos> Don't scream.<eos> You're gonna get us all killed.
Shit, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Someone's coming.<eos> - They're not gonna make it.<eos> Bring the truck down and meet them.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Behind the trucks!<eos> They're out behind the trailers!<eos> - Come on, I got you.
- How many?<eos> - Eh, four, five.<eos> It wasn't just Troy.<eos> I convinced him. - I made the call.<eos> - You don't make calls, Madison.<eos> It's not your place to make the call. - I made a deal with that guy!<eos> - Against your father's wishes!<eos> - To save all of us!<eos> - He played you!<eos> Walker wasn't gonna negotiate with you! You never had anything!
Watch your fire!<eos> There, they've come back!<eos> Kill him anyway!<eos> Okay, let him breathe.<eos> You broke the parley, Junior, stole the hostage, killed my men, all because I trusted you.<eos> - It was Troy and the girl's mother.<eos> - It's all the same.<eos> I brought you water and I returned your hostage.<eos> Not good enough.<eos> I promise you...
Buenos días, señorita.<eos> Welcome to America.<eos> ¿A dónde vas?<eos> Heading to Santa Fe.<eos> My fiancé was there.<eos> You're American.<eos> Long way, Santa Fe.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Here.<eos> I suggest you head back from whence you came.
Ofelia.<eos> Get some rest, Ofelia.<eos> What... what did you do?<eos> ! - What did you do?<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Eh, let's move.<eos> - Come on.<eos> All right, three more. Okay? Come on.<eos> Can we get another cool compress on him?<eos> I got you, big guy.
Guy's got his demons.<eos> I'm not his judge.<eos> All this, this hell we're in, it's all because of him.<eos> - All right, ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The Clarks took me in.<eos> I cared about them, cared about Nick.<eos> You volunteered for what you did.<eos> You didn't tell me it was anthrax.<eos> You turned me into a killer.
- Dad.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Bargaining power so Jake can make a deal.<eos> Well, I'm not sure they're in a negotiating mood.<eos> Walker values these relics.<eos> It's a trailer full of rocks and beads and bullshit.<eos> You scared, Jeremiah?<eos> Better be careful, son.<eos> You may not like my hospitality, but I guarantee you you'll find it better than theirs.
- I would ask that you stop your campaign of false propaganda.<eos> The stuff that DeKaan puts in that water isn't going to show up on your average tests.<eos> - Can you find it?<eos> - Yeah, but it's not cheap.<eos> I told the people of Clarksville that I would test their water, and now I need the funds to do it.<eos> - She blackmailed you.<eos> - I can go to jail if I have to.<eos> - I am not letting you go to jail.<eos> - I had other relationships.<eos> - You're my wife, and I am with you, if you're with me... only me.
Nothing to be nervous about, really.<eos> - Can you go ahead and place your left hand, palm down, on the clear page in front of you?<eos> - Like this?<eos> - That's exactly right. Do you understand why you're here?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Is it supposed to do this?<eos> - We keep damage stored inside of us. It becomes chemicals.<eos> When the right questions are asked, the chemicals mix with our sweat.<eos> The pink tells us that you're holding back.<eos> You need to uncover more, so we can help you... help yourself.
Not yet.<eos> Well, what controls you?<eos> Yeah, that would definitely be my thing.<eos> - It's all been like this.<eos> - Run of the mill, sex stuff.<eos> Before I came here, I was watching it, like, 16 hours a day.<eos> - I told you there's been nothing.<eos> If the FBI have someone among us, I haven't found them yet.<eos> Sarah, um...<eos> Lisa Jackson would have told you anything to get her tape back.
- Gaby, you've been accusing me of that for years. - It's just not true.<eos> - Just unburden.<eos> - I'm not the one who needs to unburden.<eos> I know why Kodiak went to Siberia.<eos> - To escape persecution. - It had nothing to do with me.<eos> - He wanted to get over you.<eos> - He got caught dealing marijuana.<eos> I'm not having this conversation.<eos> - I need to because having him here is throwing me off.<eos> - I'm with you, Hank.
- He got caught dealing marijuana.<eos> I'm not having this conversation.<eos> - I need to because having him here is throwing me off.<eos> - I'm with you, Hank.<eos> You... I always have been.<eos> Don't let your fears send you down that road again.<eos> - Gab...<eos> - Don't lie.<eos> Don't backpedal.<eos> I am with you.
Get in the car, Sarah.<eos> We're talking to Libby.<eos> - Look, I've called her, all right? She won't pick up.<eos> - Eddie, we will take care of this.<eos> - This is a family matter, Cal.<eos> Sarah, just get in the car.<eos> We're gonna go help Hawk.<eos> - Tell me what you need me to do, all right?<eos> I want to help you take care of this.<eos> - I can have him taken away from you, Sarah.
First thing that pops into your mind.<eos> Even if you don't understand the question.<eos> - I know more... than I should know.<eos> - All right, how so?<eos> - I know things I shouldn't.<eos> Like I know that becoming a father is making me... feel different.<eos> - Different?<eos> - Well, in "The Ladder" it says that family is important,<eos> "if the individual family in our communities are working, then our larger family is working."<eos> - I'm... I'm not sure I'm, uh, I'm following you.
- Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> I will crush you.<eos> - But he wants to talk to you now.<eos> Hey, Brendon, here she is.<eos> - You called my fucking son?<eos> You're sick.<eos> You're sick.<eos> Brendon? Hello?<eos> Honey?<eos> How are you?
You're sick.<eos> You're sick.<eos> Brendon? Hello?<eos> Honey?<eos> How are you?<eos> Of course.<eos> You're sadistic.<eos> - You know, it's already hard enough to sleep at night.<eos> Locking our kid away isn't gonna make it easier.<eos> - How did you know...
- I've thought about being back here so many times.<eos> - Are you seeing that girl from the hospital?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you and Cal?<eos> - No.<eos> We could never be together like that.<eos> I promise.<eos> - I'm worried about you.<eos> Hey. The hospital helped.<eos> - Did they put you on medication?
No.<eos> I'm just, uh... Checking drivers licenses.<eos> You know, women lie about their age all the time.<eos> What happened to that coach?<eos> - I fired him.<eos> - What?<eos> You fired the only guy with any wrestling experience?<eos> I don't want to make a dumb wrestling show. I don't wanna just take things out of the playbook.<eos> - You trying to fuck this up, too?<eos> - Come on. I gave you another job.
- Were you guys about to bone?<eos> I can pee in a bucket, I don't care.<eos> I'm married.<eos> But we did. 1978.<eos> It was me, her, and her husband.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You need to pee? Pee.<eos> - Don't bring shit up like that, man.<eos> History is a beautiful thing.<eos> I haven't talked to you since the... You know, the...
- That's right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cherry is a bona fide badass on the outside.<eos> On the inside she's like a marshmallow, like a Mallomar.<eos> And who doesn't like Mallomars, right, baby?<eos> Why you look so surprised? Listen...<eos> When I get back I want to see some moves.<eos> Some slamma jammas, some whammos.<eos> You know, anything that makes it look like we might just pull this thing off.<eos> If you need help, ask the big one.
Okay.<eos> - I wanna start with a hold and release.<eos> - Like a lockup?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Show me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> A lockup, it's kind of like dancing when you first start, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> So, we start here first.<eos> This way I can tell you which way to go.
- Okay.<eos> A lockup, it's kind of like dancing when you first start, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> So, we start here first.<eos> This way I can tell you which way to go.<eos> - So, I'll lead and you follow.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so, if I wanted to put you in, say, a headlock.
She was kicked in the stomach by her Guatemalan swim coach who was jealous she lost her virginity to the captain of the diving team.<eos> Good. Good.<eos> Kick in the stomach, I like that.<eos> Swim coach, I don't know. We can lose him.<eos> We need a better assailant.<eos> What animal would kick a pregnant woman in the belly?<eos> What kind of person would ruin the life of a gorgeous, successful, pregnant woman?<eos> What kind of homewrecker would do that?<eos> Ruth!<eos> Doesn't seem like too much of a stretch for you.
- Shut the fuck up.<eos> Okay.<eos> - He's talking about me.<eos> - They're talking about her.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - Now, here you are, you're ripe.<eos> Fecund.<eos> A custodian of new life.<eos> You're a fertile harvest goddess.<eos> Now... pull your shoulders back, and strut like you own the ring.
-[Carlota] Leaving already?<eos> -I don't belong here. I quit.<eos> -[Ángeles] Lidia.<eos> -Will you hand it in for me?<eos> I have to go.<eos> If it's about the call, I can talk to Sara.<eos> -[Alba] I don't want you to.<eos> -But she can help.<eos> I don't want you to help me.<eos> Not you, not Ángeles, none of you!
I'm just a man celebrating finally getting a decent job with a woman in his arms who drives him crazy.<eos> [Carolina] You mean "lover."<eos> [Mario] I told you, I'm leaving her. It's a matter of time.<eos> We agreed not to do this in the office until your wife quits.<eos> [Mario] What does it matter?<eos> [Carolina] How can you be so sure she's going to quit?<eos> Because I'm her husband... and I ordered her to do it.<eos> Well, Sara's offered her a promotion... and from what I heard, the conditions are much better than what she's had up to now.<eos> [Mario] She didn't say anything to me.<eos> Nothing can justify the way Lidia treated you.
[Ricardo] But it wouldn't have become a reality without your work.<eos> He hired the architect and supervised construction personally.<eos> Three years of colossal work.<eos> Uh, Majesty...<eos> Let him puff his feathers like a peacock.<eos> You don't need his praise.<eos> You have his shares.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm fine, really.<eos> Don't let what he said get to you.
I'm sure he's replaced you by now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Your ball's been posted.<eos> [Alba] Victoria taught me to forget. She taught me not to tie myself to anything I couldn't leave behind.<eos> People who think they are our friends are just people we can take advantage of when we need them... before leaving them behind.<eos> That's what Victoria said.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I acted like an idiot this morning.<eos> I felt bad and took it out on you.
You save yourself a lot of trouble.<eos> And you can keep yourself from getting hurt.<eos> Sure, you're right. You're right.<eos> Anisette, I hope you work.<eos> Besides, Ángeles is a smart lady.<eos> She must know what her husband's like.<eos> [Ángeles] Mario, I didn't tell you...<eos> Sara offered me a promotion.<eos> That's why I couldn't resign.<eos> I didn't tell you because I didn't know how you'd react.
[Ángeles] Mario, I didn't tell you...<eos> Sara offered me a promotion.<eos> That's why I couldn't resign.<eos> I didn't tell you because I didn't know how you'd react.<eos> And we've been arguing so much, I was afraid you wouldn't understand.<eos> So why tell me now?<eos> Because now I know what I want, Mario.<eos> I do now.<eos> I listen to you, and I see what a wonderful night we're having... and I know what I want.<eos> I know I want to be with you.
Are you sure?<eos> They say that children and drunks tell the truth.<eos> Don't tell me you didn't have fun, even just a little bit.<eos> We won't get kicked out?<eos> No, Lola's bark is worse than her bite.<eos> Relax.<eos> When she goes to sleep, you can go home.<eos> Girls... could I stay here with you?<eos> Just for a couple of days, until things calm down and I find a solution.<eos> Did something happen to you?
Relax.<eos> When she goes to sleep, you can go home.<eos> Girls... could I stay here with you?<eos> Just for a couple of days, until things calm down and I find a solution.<eos> Did something happen to you?<eos> [crying] I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't want to burden you with my problems.<eos> You have enough of your own.<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> If you get it off your chest, you might feel better.
I've been working here for years.<eos> Marga, keep a lookout for Sara.<eos> Yes, I'll be the lookout.<eos> Go, get inside. I'll do it.<eos> [Emilio] Mr. Pascual!<eos> Get in.<eos> [whispering] Do you know the subscriber number?<eos> San Blas 415.<eos> [in French] 415 San Blas.<eos> Carlota, I need to talk to you.
-Who is this person?<eos> -What does that matter?<eos> I want to know if you're in danger, Alba.<eos> I owe money... and if I don't pay it back, I'll go to jail or worse.<eos> That's why I opened the safe.<eos> I'm not the girl you knew.<eos> This is what I've become.<eos> When you pay these people... could you start a new life? Maybe here?<eos> I haven't relied on anyone for ten years, and this won't be the exception.<eos> I didn't say I'd give you the money.
Wait!<eos> Ángeles, wait!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't know Mario.<eos> Mario's lying to you.<eos> -You have to know.<eos> -It's not true.<eos> -He's lying to you.<eos> -That's not true.<eos> I've tried to help you, and now you want to destroy my marriage.
-It's none of your business.<eos> I kept my part of the bargain.<eos> I hope you intend to keep yours.<eos> Did you do it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Now get in the car.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Please, get in.<eos> I want to show you something.
So if you have things you need to do, you should go ahead and do them.<eos> I'll be spending my day convincing the Senate to vote for me, so there's no speeches necessary.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> You know what? I do have some things to do.<eos> Some people I need to check in with.<eos> So... Tom.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yes?<eos> You ready, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> I'll have a car waiting for you.
- Better late than never.<eos> - Sorry I missed dinner.<eos> Why the back?<eos> I'm pretending you're an Uber.<eos> Just help me out.<eos> My sister-in-law.<eos> She came when you couldn't.<eos> Do you think the dead judge us?<eos> No.<eos> What did he do that you liked the most?
A permanent bond between Wessex and Mercia.<eos> Which one of you is Aethelred?<eos> Alfred forced me to renew my allegiance.<eos> He sent me to kill the Northmen brothers, Erik and Sigefrid.<eos> After taking Sigefrid's hand, I banished them.<eos> You will take one ship and you will leave Northumbria.<eos> You will not return.<eos> I swear!<eos> And at last, in Northumbria, I took my revenge against Kjarten and his son, Sven, freeing my enslaved sister, Thyra.<eos> Let me help you.
I have done my utmost to serve Alfred but with no reward, no response...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To wash the blood off my hands and then to bed!<eos> Do you not believe me! ?<eos> Where did you see this corpse?<eos> Mercia. Beyond Watling Street.<eos> You crossed into Daneland?<eos> I went to the part of Mercia that Alfred gifted to the Danes, yes.<eos> You happened to wander across Watling Street?<eos> I was sent for! I was invited! And the same will happen to you!
He dislikes me more by the day.<eos> Then you should ask him to release you.<eos> And we will go north, to my brother and to Ragnar.<eos> I am content here, but we cannot become an enemy of Alfred.<eos> Lord.<eos> Hild. You look fearsome.<eos> I think I preferred you with a sword.<eos> My sword has become heavy.<eos> But you could probably kill someone with that, though.<eos> I need to speak to you plainly.
- Yes. I like that.<eos> Lord?<eos> Lord?<eos> Have you made a decision yet?<eos> Have you given it thought?<eos> Given thought to what?<eos> Uhtred.<eos> My request to marry, Lord. I would like to have a family.<eos> Lord, you will answer the man.<eos> I will speak with her at Winchester and give you my decision.
The Ealdormen of the Witan, are saying.<eos> Lord of Mercia, perhaps.<eos> Alfred would never allow another Saxon to be called King.<eos> Nor would a certain dead man called Bjorn.<eos> - He wishes to meet you.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> You're pinching my skin, you're pinching my skin.<eos> This was clean!<eos> Why is it that you're being trusted with my business?<eos> Who gave you this message? - A skald!
- Kill him.<eos> - No, please, Lord!<eos> Please, Lord, no, please!<eos> Get the message into his mouth and kill him!<eos> Spare me!<eos> Spare me and I will repay you with gratitude!<eos> Please, Lord!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Bjorn, you have blood.<eos> I have given you life.
- No, please, Lord!<eos> Please, Lord, no, please!<eos> Get the message into his mouth and kill him!<eos> Spare me!<eos> Spare me and I will repay you with gratitude!<eos> Please, Lord!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Bjorn, you have blood.<eos> I have given you life.<eos> I have sent you a message.
She is too good for him.<eos> Why ARE we delaying?<eos> Did Sihtric witness something at the grave-side...<eos> Sihtric saw nothing.<eos> May I say that you look quite beautiful.<eos> God looks upon me with favour I do not deserve.<eos> Lord God in your heaven, we are humbly gathered before you on this day of thanks and celebration.<eos> If you don't mind!<eos> The point I make is simple:<eos> all of the power, all of the wealth, all of the land that could belong to you, will now belong to him.
Yes, by all means, strike me.<eos> But in your heart, in your purse, you know I speak the truth.<eos> Yes, hit him.<eos> All I will say, again, is that the dead man speaks the truth...<eos> Lord?<eos> Some would say it's treason.<eos> No, no, this wedding is treason...<eos> Lord?<eos> This wedding is a betrayal of Wessex and the men of Wessex.<eos> Meaning you?
But if the Lord of Mercia believes that men sinking to the bottom of the river is an advantage, then let him attack.<eos> Uhtred, your advice may well be sound, but how am I to trust it?<eos> Lord?<eos> Why do the brothers call you the next "Lord of Mercia"?<eos> They call me the next 'King of Mercia", lord.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do they call you "King"?<eos> What has been said, Uhtred? What has been agreed?<eos> Nothing has been agreed.<eos> How am I to trust you? !
Rudolph the rude-nosed reindeer...<eos> Now then, would you mind telling me what it is you think you're doing?<eos> I think it might be some kinda Hercule Poirot-type deal, where he gathers everybody in the parlor.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Actually maybe, I dunno, I haven't slept in like a week and I've been eating Dexedrine like candy, so... are you seeing tracers yet?<eos> I... no, shut up.<eos> What is this all about?<eos> It's about you, killing my partner!<eos> What?<eos> who told you that?
Zip it! I...<eos> I can explain!<eos> Yes. Please explain what you've been doing in my bar for the past year.<eos> Because either you were moonlighting as a singer just to make ends meet on a government salary, or you were working undercover to bring me down!<eos> Dun-dun-dun!<eos> Not helping! But if I were undercover, obviously my agency would be in the know, and so if anything happened to me, you'd...<eos> Lana!<eos> what the shit, Mother?<eos> I, I didn't mean to! This damn thing's got a hair trigger!<eos> That's what I was trying to tell you!
now is not the time.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry, father.<eos> Please continue.<eos> And do you, Cecil, take Trinette to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Ow! I do!<eos> So, I guess I'll see you around.<eos> And so that's pretty much that, I guess.<eos> Vengeance-wise.<eos> And I, I don't know if you feel avenged, or if that even matters to you.

Jesus Christ.<eos> And I know the case took a long time, but like you always said,<eos> I have a tendency to get sidetracked.<eos> Which, honestly, was kinda shitty of you.<eos> And the smart thing would've been to read your envelope full of clues and then start rampaging, but... holy shit,<eos> I wonder if that was your will.<eos> Although I can't imagine you having anything that I would possibly want.<eos> I mean, I'll swing by your apartment and take a look around, but uh...<eos> What else, what else?<eos> Oh, I brought you some heroin.
You created a killer.<eos> On the street, they're calling her Skairipa.<eos> Your decision-making has grown increasingly questionable.<eos> I'm glad you're still alive.<eos> I never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> Sword doesn't care what you meant.<eos> It just cuts.<eos> Pike stood right there.<eos> You do this and you're no better than he was.<eos> There's a darkness in you, Octavia.
Sword doesn't care what you meant.<eos> It just cuts.<eos> Pike stood right there.<eos> You do this and you're no better than he was.<eos> There's a darkness in you, Octavia.<eos> It's the end of the world, Kane.<eos> Darkness is all we have left.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> You won't survive out here alone.<eos> Let me help you.

Is that...<eos> An ischemic stroke.<eos> Well, that means it can heal, right?<eos> As long as she takes it easy, she'll recover.<eos> She's almost as stubborn as you are.<eos> And you?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mom, I spoke to Jackson.<eos> He doesn't think you're fine.
Who do we test?<eos> Emori, hey.<eos> I'm heading up to the house.<eos> Does anyone want anything while I'm up there?<eos> No, we're fine.<eos> Thanks, Emori.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Honey, you should go with her.<eos> No. I just got here.<eos> I want to be here with you and help.
I can't find my sister, but I do know where they are.<eos> Bellamy, stop.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No unnecessary risks.<eos> You come home safe. I got this.<eos> Raven says the black rain will be here soon.<eos> Raven's right.<eos> I used to love the rain.<eos> Now it terrifies me.<eos> I would have thought nothing terrified you.
You can cook? Uhh.<eos> You can read.<eos> Yeah, I know what you're thinking, Clarke.<eos> Why are all the good ones taken, right?<eos> A good randzi is rare.<eos> John would be celebrated by any clan.<eos> Yeah, he's a real catch. Mmm.<eos> ♪ I need you to show me the way ♪ Oh, my God.<eos> I'm gonna go get cleaned up.<eos> Yeah, let me show you where to go.
♪ I need you to show me the way ♪ Oh, my God.<eos> I'm gonna go get cleaned up.<eos> Yeah, let me show you where to go.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Down the hall.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We're getting out of here. What?<eos> Now?<eos> Why? I'll explain on the way to the bunker.<eos> I already told you the bunker's not an answer.
You said you'd be here.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> What am I supposed to tell them?<eos> The truth.<eos> Mark.<eos> Peter.<eos> I can't get to you.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> We'll come to you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> You did more damage than you took.<eos> Not enough.<eos> Don't tell me you've never killed for revenge.<eos> Well, then, I guess you're better than me, because I'm going to.<eos> But first I'm gonna make him suffer for what he did to me and my brother.<eos> I'm gonna cut him for every time he cut me.<eos> I'm gonna make him beg the way I begged.<eos> We're not gonna let him hurt you again.
He will say anything to survive.<eos> And the second we let our guard down, he will strike.<eos> He will kill us all.<eos> But I am not gonna let that happen, Clarke, because today, I am the commander of death.<eos> I only came here for the food.<eos> Things I can trade.<eos> I scavenge so my family can eat.<eos> Please. That's it.<eos> Find the right angle.<eos> I'll help you out.
The fence...<eos> The fence I tied my mother to... before I cut off her fingers.<eos> Before I cut my father's throat.<eos> Before I cut my brother's throat.<eos> Go home, Ilian.<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> You feel the way you're supposed to feel after you take a life.<eos> I feel nothing.<eos> Now go back to your stupid sheep.<eos> I don't believe you.
I feel nothing.<eos> Now go back to your stupid sheep.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I saw the pain in your face when you aimed that gun at my head.<eos> We're done talking. You may not want to feel it, but it's there.<eos> I should've pulled the trigger.<eos> - Why didn't you?<eos> - Just shut up. You think you're a killer, but you couldn't kill me.<eos> Whatever escape from the pain you were looking for wasn't there anymore.<eos> I told you my sad story.
I heard the ASU's having a cook-in.<eos> Hard pass.<eos> People have completely forgotten about this blackface party.<eos> The whole thing, it's like they just...<eos> Reggie. Sometimes being carefree and black is an act of revolution.<eos> She's right, man.<eos> Saturday's a day of rest.<eos> You ain't Jewish, man.<eos> You don't know my life.<eos> But you let the ladies walk all over you.
Deal with it.<eos> Two, who are you?<eos> I'm the girl you guys are gonna share your weed with.<eos> Ikumi, your new catchall Asian friend.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay, girl.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, nice app, Reggie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Glad you like it.
Wait, so it's bad if I'm just repeating what's in the song?<eos> - Dude, seriously?<eos> - No, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But it's not like I'm a racist.<eos> Never said you were a racist.<eos> Just don't say "nigga."<eos> Like, you didn't have to say it just then.<eos> I guess it just felt kind of weird to censor myself.<eos> It felt kind of weird to hear you say it.
I'm sorry.<eos> But it's not like I'm a racist.<eos> Never said you were a racist.<eos> Just don't say "nigga."<eos> Like, you didn't have to say it just then.<eos> I guess it just felt kind of weird to censor myself.<eos> It felt kind of weird to hear you say it.<eos> I mean, how would you feel if I started rapping to songs, you know, that say "honky" and "cracker"? I wouldn't care at all.<eos> Exactly, that's the difference.<eos> The fact that you don't care and I do.
Has anyone seen Sam?<eos> This really feels like something she would plan to make a point.<eos> Kurt, I'm good.<eos> I just don't like being called a racist.<eos> Again, he never said you were a racist.<eos> He said "don't say that word."<eos> I'm not some redneck.<eos> Is that what you think of me, Reggie?<eos> Yeah, Reggie. You call your friend a racist and yet you're surprised when he's upset.<eos> We're friends, but suddenly, I'm supposed to give you nigga dispensation?
I'm going in my wallet.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you'd shown me that when I asked, we could have avoided all that.<eos> Okay, party's over.<eos> If you don't live here, go home.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Think we should walk together.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> Reggie... are you okay?

Okay.<eos> Cover her face.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I don't want her watching us.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... why did someone murder your partner?<eos> That's what I'm trying to find out.<eos> Really?<eos> I would think who is much more important than why.<eos> Because if you found out who killed him, you could make them tell you why.
You look like shit.<eos> Couldn't sleep.<eos> Noisy house guests.<eos> What do you mean, "house guests"?<eos> Stop it!<eos> What are you doing here, anyway?<eos> I heard they did a nice wedge salad. Ooh.<eos> We don't. Aw.<eos> And now that we've settled that, if you two will please excuse us?<eos> Okay, Mother, but remember what I told you.

Really?<eos> Absolutely!<eos> Why-why... why do you think that?<eos> Did she...<eos> Just admit that you like her.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, of course I.. Hey! Yeah.<eos> - Me and him?<eos> - We just!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Kriken sonraun en branon.<eos> Kom graun, oso na groun op.<eos> Kom folau, oso na gyon op.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> What's it mean?<eos> From the earth, we will grow.<eos> From the ashes, we will rise.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't think you would mind if I...
I know it's bad and everything is dying and all, but I'm just gonna say it...<eos> I don't miss mosquitoes.<eos> Don't miss them. This is all a big joke to you, isn't it?<eos> Now you're getting it.<eos> That's exactly what it is.<eos> One big cosmic joke.<eos> You'd realize that, too, if you pulled the stick out of your ass.<eos> That's enough.<eos> That is enough.<eos> I'm just trying to help you.
She could be the one that saves us all.<eos> How?<eos> _<eos> Gaia, these men need your help.<eos> The tattoo.<eos> Look. The center.<eos> Still think it's a coincidence?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Oh, I found it.<eos> And I now believe it's so it could lead me to you.
Still think it's a coincidence?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Oh, I found it.<eos> And I now believe it's so it could lead me to you.<eos> Tell us about the symbol.<eos> Where does it come from?<eos> It's the holy symbol of our order.<eos> Mother.<eos> Gaia, please.<eos> Skaikru helped you protect the Flame.
Azgeda is our ally.<eos> We have the royal seal.<eos> No one has to die.<eos> You're assuming they'll honor the seal.<eos> The closer we get to Praimfaya, the less alliances seem to mean.<eos> How much faith do you have in yours?<eos> First, we survive.<eos> Then we find our humanity again.<eos> I'm sure they said the same thing in Mount Weather, too.<eos> You ok?

We're doing the right thing.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Certainty's a luxury leaders can't afford.<eos> I'm no king.<eos> Maybe not, but you were born for this.<eos> Lexa knew it, and so do I.<eos> You don't back down when things get hard.<eos> It's always hard.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> I know you don't believe it now, but one day, they will thank you for what you're doing here.
I don't dance.<eos> I don't really want to dance.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yes!<eos> Good idea.<eos> Let someone else save the world for once.<eos> Yeah.<eos> John, enough.<eos> You can't stop this. No. No, Emori.<eos> I'm not letting this happen to you.
Clarke.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We're testing me.<eos> It worked.<eos> It's been two hours.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Ready.<eos> I won't let you do it.<eos> Mom, I trust you.
What is it, Monty?<eos> "From the ashes we will rise."<eos> What if it's not just a motto?<eos> What if it's an instruction?<eos> Do it.<eos> The 12th seal.<eos> Ready?<eos> 1, 2...<eos> Hold this temple.<eos> After you, my friend.
She said you claimed to have had information about Vice President MacLeish before he was confirmed.<eos> The president would like to know what that information was.<eos> Agent Wells, you need to answer my question.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I don't know you.<eos> And if the president wants answers, the president himself.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> I'm gonna be fine.<eos> I don't want you to worry.
- Gauze and forceps.<eos> - How's the drainage?<eos> - Right there.<eos> - Good. Hold it.<eos> It's delicate surgery, Peter.<eos> If he doesn't survive it, then we have nothing to worry about.<eos> - We are right back on track. - Okay.<eos> Well, Lozano is still out there.<eos> FBI, Homeland, someone must have a lead on him by now.<eos> And then, as acting president, you can insist they report directly to you.
They were asking me if I had authorized you to look at my personal phone logs from two years ago.<eos> All right, so, I'll ask again.<eos> What's going on, Emily?<eos> - It must have been a miscommunication. - Yeah, right.<eos> Like the other day when you told me you were working late because the president was having second thoughts on his choice for the HUD secretary, something the president knew nothing about?<eos> What, was that a miscommunication, too?<eos> Talk to me, Emily. What's going on?<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss this. I'm sorry.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means I can't talk about this with you.
All right, let's close him up.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> It's quiet.<eos> Kirkman's still in surgery?<eos> There was a complication, but, uh... it looks like he'll pull through.<eos> So will we.<eos> How the hell can you be so sure of that?<eos> Because he's got nothing on us.<eos> Catalan is dead.<eos> The evidence connecting you and him doesn't exist anymore.
The Dow, NASDAQ, and SP are approaching Black Monday-type losses.<eos> The Dow Jones Industrial Average has already plunged a staggering 2,000 points in one day, after the shooting of President Kirkman.<eos> You better not be eating my Jello.<eos> It's my Jello. I earned it.<eos> - Good morning. - Hmm.<eos> What did the doctors say?<eos> They removed all the bullet fragments, and they say there is no permanent damage.<eos> Good.<eos> Last night, I kept hearing voices out in the hall. Yeah.<eos> It was just people coming by to see how you were.

I need to go back to the White House.<eos> Yeah, well, you'll be out of here soon enough.<eos> No. I mean now.<eos> I can't just sit here.<eos> Tom, you just got shot.<eos> You are lucky to be alive.<eos> Alex, the people that are behind this are still out there.<eos> There's a traitor in the White House.<eos> I'm not gonna find them by just sitting here.<eos> Okay, Tom, I need to tell you something.

I didn't even know you played.<eos> I was serious about it for a while, but now I just play to release stress.<eos> And does it work?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> So, I just got back from the hospital.<eos> Listen, I-I get why you're being so cagey.<eos> It was a matter of national security.<eos> Aaron, he asked me to vet you.<eos> It was strictly classified, so when you confronted me,<eos> - I couldn't tell you what was going on.
You're not gonna win with him.<eos> - So I'm discovering. - Look, I promise you,<eos> I will do everything I can to take it easy.<eos> Besides, last time I checked, I think I outrank you.<eos> Alex, I know you're mad at me, but I really do need to get back.<eos> You're gonna have to trust me.<eos> Tom, I saw the way you looked watching that press conference.<eos> What is going on?<eos> - Is it MacLeish?<eos> - I can't tell you.

- Thank you.<eos> I thought I knew how this town worked, but it doesn't make sense anymore.<eos> You know, every... everyone I thought I could count on, everything, it doesn't matter.<eos> The system wins in the end, right?<eos> I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm naive.<eos> Maybe I'm both.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Did I ever tell you about how I got my first job at the White House?<eos> Harvard Lampoon connection.<eos> I told you?

You back?<eos> No, no, it's just a quick hit.<eos> Oh, how you been?<eos> You haven't, uh... You haven't returned my texts in a while.<eos> Well, it's, uh... it's complicated.<eos> You weren't really with the FBI, were you?<eos> Look, uh, Seth, I'm tired.<eos> No, no, no, it's fine.<eos> Come on. I mean, I know a non-answer when I hear one.<eos> If I felt you needed to know something, I would tell you.
You're already here?<eos> Okay. I'll be there as fast as I can.<eos> Aren't you gonna let me in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're trouble.<eos> You don't know the half of it.<eos> Sorry I'm early.<eos> For once, there was no traffic.<eos> No worries.<eos> Unemployment doesn't suit you, cousin.
How do we stop him?<eos> You have to talk to the First Lady.<eos> Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> Oh, my God, Tom.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I so did not mean to step on your announcement.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> Hell, it wasn't even a mistake.<eos> I mean, you know I agree with you.
You'll land on your feet.<eos> And if there's anything I can do, let me know.<eos> - I mean that.<eos> - Thank you, ma'am.<eos> So how'd it go? - Good.<eos> I think.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Was that Speaker Hookstraten?<eos> Chuck, it's me. The place is completely cleared out.<eos> I need you to look into the building records.
Think of it this way. You could be doing late night.<eos> How's it going?<eos> - I'll go see how close they are.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You look great.<eos> - Tom, I look like a mannequin.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Tom, I'm just no good at playing this, you know, submissive-wife role.<eos> - No one's asking you to.
- About what?<eos> Why you left the White House?<eos> Look, I know you don't do anything without good reason, but my mom said you were thinking about moving back to Texas.<eos> I just want to say, for the record, it's a really bad idea.<eos> Nadia, I made it about as far as I can make it in this town.<eos> It was a really good run.<eos> Now it's... It's time to try something new.<eos> - Can I just say one thing?<eos> - Now you're asking?<eos> Before you, no one thought it was possible to get out of our town.
Before you, no one thought it was possible to get out of our town.<eos> You probably don't remember this, but... the summer after you graduated from college, I was maybe 10, and you came home for a visit.<eos> And the only thing you could talk about was moving to D.C. to work in the mailroom of some senator that nobody had ever heard of.<eos> I'll never forget that you told me it didn't matter that we came from nothing.<eos> - Look, Nadia, just...<eos> - Because... No, shut up.<eos> You were gonna prove that even we can make a difference.<eos> That's why you came to D.C.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Because of you.
I just need you to tell me which Republicans would be open to a sit-down?<eos> The murder rate in particular cities in this country is unacceptable to President Kirkman...<eos> Senator, I understand and appreciate your position, but 84% of the country wants tougher background checks.<eos> Now, the American people have spoken, and it's our job to listen.<eos> - Hey. I'm very sorry to hear you say that, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye. Who was that?<eos> Senator Franklin.<eos> We're five Republican votes short.<eos> How are you doing?
Run the op-ed now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm good. Thanks.<eos> Long time.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> I've noticed.<eos> So, why are you looking for Patrick Lloyd?<eos> It's a two-way street.<eos> You want Intel from the Agency, I get Intel from the Bureau.<eos> Beck... I've never denied you anything when you've asked for it.
Yeah, I'm just...<eos> I'm in no rush to get back to the fleabag motel.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> I will.<eos> It's me. Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Look, I know I told you to lay low, but I need your help. Name it.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Patrick Lloyd.<eos> Little pea, how are you?
Patrick Lloyd.<eos> Little pea, how are you?<eos> Hey, Daddy.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss you more than anything in the world.<eos> Me too.<eos> Where is Mommy?<eos> Upstairs, helping Leo with his homework.<eos> Want me to go get her? No.<eos> No, I want to talk to you.
Yeah, smart move, too, setting yourself up as a moderate alternative to Bowman, but this isn't about politics.<eos> This is about our old friend, the late Vice President Peter MacLeish.<eos> MacLeish?<eos> I heard you delayed his confirmation vote as VP.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What I want to know is why.<eos> My sources say you were waiting for some evidence from an FBI agent.<eos> We're getting into matters of national security here.<eos> Yeah, I'll make it easy for you.

I was starting to wonder if you'd stood me up.<eos> Come here.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Is it about what I said earlier? - No.<eos> No, I promise.<eos> I just got a lot on my mind.<eos> Come on, let's get ready.<eos> Tom, I'm worried about you.<eos> I can see it in your face, the toll this job is taking on you.

I need another beer. Do you guys want anything?<eos> No, I'm good, thanks.<eos> So, POTUS is heading up to Toronto.<eos> Yes. The White House is all mine.<eos> No, seriously, it's his first NATO summit. First time out of the country.<eos> Polls are high.<eos> I mean, he's on a roll.<eos> So are you.<eos> I do have to admit, it feels good.<eos> What about you?
They believe that you could be a potential witness in their investigation into the Capitol bombing.<eos> No way. I'm not giving up my sources!<eos> No one's asking you to.<eos> So what are you asking me?<eos> To go in for an interview.<eos> That's all. See what they want.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Because they can subpoena you if you don't.<eos> Fine. Let 'em.<eos> What Alyssa's saying is if you go in voluntarily, it buys good will, for you and the paper...

The Nuclear Planning Group voted.<eos> They're not gonna be putting your initiative back on the agenda.<eos> So that's it then.<eos> Sir, the First Lady's on the phone for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Next time.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> We're fine.<eos> How are you?
I know this can't be easy.<eos> No.<eos> So, I've... I've been thinking about you all day.<eos> You know, the story.<eos> I-I think I understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> You shutting me out at the hospital when that FBI agent came to see you... the way you react every time Mike enters a room... the reason you can't let the family come back to the White House.<eos> It's true, isn't it?<eos> Someone else blew up the Capitol, and you don't know who it is, do you?<eos> There are so many things I've wanted to tell you. So many things I still want to tell you.

So many things I still want to tell you.<eos> But you can't.<eos> I was thinking, a year ago... the only thing I ever had to worry about on a weekday was whether or not I'd get to Penny's soccer practice on time.<eos> That is a lifetime ago.<eos> Tom, how can I help you?
I'm going to honor his request.<eos> But... not indefinitely.<eos> I'm... speechless. I don't know what to say.<eos> Not the best quality for a press secretary.<eos> Well, let me just say "thank you."<eos> That'll work.<eos> Don't think for a second I'm going soft here.<eos> I'll still be kicking your ass all over the schoolyard.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Previously on "The Path"...<eos> What if we're wrong about our exemption application being recalled?<eos> We don't have any money, Cal.<eos> - Please, take a seat.<eos> - Who the hell is that?<eos> That's Sarah Lane.<eos> And that is why the exemption is so very important to us, Lisa... 'cause what you did will never, ever go away.<eos> I need you to get in the car, sweetheart.<eos> Sean, my name is Wendy Kennair.<eos> She's gonna help you, Sean...
She's gonna help you, Sean...<eos> you, Mary, and our grandchild. You're getting out.<eos> Jacqueline Richards?<eos> You contributed on behalf of your daughter, Noa, to our cause.<eos> - I'm a friend of your son's.<eos> - My son?<eos> I'm afraid he's out of town.<eos> Your doctor, Steven Meyer... he hurt him.<eos> I picked a son, but he was the wrong son.<eos> You will build The Garden, and we will follow you there.
You will build The Garden, and we will follow you there.<eos> Sometimes I was with both of them on the same night.<eos> Some nights, I would have dinner with Katie and the kids and then make up some excuse, like leaving for a business trip, and then go back to Tracy for the rest of the week.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> It's something I'm dealing with.<eos> It's my life.<eos> Your lives, plural, Don.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You came to us drowning in guilt, overwhelmed, and talking about taking your own life.<eos> We helped you. We asked you to search within yourself to figure out why you were doing what you were doing and why you started two separate families both built on lies;
- It's black and white, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, Kansas is black and white, but Oz is in color.<eos> The land of Oz is entirely green, but the inhabitants are wearing these green-colored glasses, and they don't know that their world is the same colors as everyone else's.<eos> Their "leader" is called the Wizard of Oz, but really, he's just a regular guy from Kansas that has everyone fooled.<eos> Thanks for letting us throw you a baby shower.<eos> Uh, how do you two know each other again?<eos> - Oh... - College.<eos> We're old friends.<eos> I hope you enjoy the book.

Of course.<eos> Hey. Did you hear?<eos> The IRS stuff... it's over.<eos> I heard Cal might've had to go to jail. Is that true?<eos> I don't... don't think so.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Please.<eos> Stop.<eos> You're out of shape.<eos> Chasing after you is exhausting.
You're really doing the "bring the girl home - to meet the family" thing?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I am, yeah.<eos> I've met your family.<eos> I know. I-I just...<eos> I want you with me when I go home.<eos> You're so "aww, shucks," it's incredible.<eos> Yeah, I'll go.<eos> This is a token of our appreciation for your incredibly generous donation.<eos> The Movement thanks you.
They blackmailed you too, didn't they?<eos> They played you your unburdening sessions?<eos> Welcome.<eos> Thanks so much for having me.<eos> Oh, I'm just so happy that Hawk wanted to bring you.<eos> - She's a good one, this one.<eos> - I know she is.<eos> - Hawk's back.<eos> - Hey, kid.<eos> I missed you.
Once we decided that even our own loved ones were dead to us because they didn't believe exactly in what we did, we probably stopped truly... loving then too.<eos> I can see why you want this.<eos> You've suffered by that ideology.<eos> This has nothing to do with me.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Don't forget it's ego of the individual that always threatens the good of the whole.<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Fuckin' shelf.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Are you okay?
I left too.<eos> You left... out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> Um, why don't we go downstairs? I'll buy you a cup of coffee.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> One cup of coffee.<eos> Cal, where the hell are you?<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
Sorry you had to suffer her venom.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's me.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I couldn't let you walk away.<eos> You're everything that...<eos> Everything I said up there was about you.<eos> Hank.<eos> Why are you contacting Tessa?<eos> Wait, she told you?
Previously on This Is Us...<eos> I'm not sure you've ever experienced anything real your entire life.<eos> And that's our cue to leave.<eos> Our lead actress vanished a month ago, off the face of the planet.<eos> You got involved with her. You slept with the Tony-nominated star of my play - and ruined everything.<eos> - Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too. It didn't ruin anything.
- Kevin, can I ask you something? - Yeah.<eos> Even though every feminist bone in my body will stop talking to me...<eos> What's up?<eos> What are we doing? Like, do we like each other?<eos> Are we just sleeping together?<eos> Because if we're just sleeping together, that's... that's totally fine. I...<eos> I mean, 'cause I can't, like, totally process that someone like you would sleep with me, so...<eos> Whoa, what does that even mean?<eos> I don't understand what that means.<eos> Listen, here's the thing. I like you.
Would it be okay if I had some of that Japanese whiskey?<eos> - Will you mind? No? - Hey.<eos> Oh, well... very nice chatting with you, Randall.<eos> Thanks, Jess... ie.<eos> Jessie.<eos> Randall, I'll be staying at Jessie's tonight.<eos> Wow, staying over?<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, you got your chemo meds?<eos> I can bring it down for you, if you like.
Name?<eos> - Uh, Toby Damon.<eos> - Place of birth? Palm Springs. I hate surgery.<eos> I hate the word surgery. I hate, I hate surgeons.<eos> I hate sturgeon, the fish, 'cause it sounds like "surgeons."<eos> God, I'm freaking out. - Just breathe, babe.<eos> - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah.<eos> I just don't want you to freak out, okay?<eos> Well, don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you... is the thing.
You would?<eos> Wait, just like that? Just like that.<eos> It was just like that from the moment I met you, kid. All of this is just... life trying to get in the way.<eos> You're back.<eos> Do you think we've bonded?<eos> Since you moved in.<eos> I kind of thought we had.<eos> Sure. Then why is it so easy for you to push me to the side?<eos> Me, Beth, the girls.<eos> Ever since Jessie came back into your life, it's like you don't care about spending time with us.

And I'm not trying to act like some kind of jealous teenager, nor deny you your love life, be...<eos> And don't give me some damn story about your cat.<eos> I can feel it now, Randall.<eos> This cancer is coming for me sooner than later.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Now, Jessie can handle it.<eos> He's seen this stuff.<eos> He's been helping me make arrangements, taking me to some of the best state-funded nursing homes, trying to find a good place to go before this gets really bad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I will not put this on you, Randall.

It's our family, William.<eos> Look, this is your home now.<eos> You've lived in this home, and... if it comes to that, you can die in it.<eos> You're not gonna be crawling underneath someone else's porch like some dog.<eos> I don't want to do this to you.
Might as well take advantage, right?<eos> - For sexy hair... - Like this.<eos> You got it.<eos> - Dev, how was your trip to Italy?<eos> - It was great.<eos> You must come with us to hajj in Mecca next year.<eos> Your father says you're quite pious.<eos> Uh, you know, I try.<eos> Dev says prayer five times a day, every day.<eos> Do you like this mosque we're going to this weekend?
It's not funny.<eos> Look, I get it. For you guys, religion has this cultural value.<eos> It's not like that for me.<eos> It's people calling me terrorist and getting pulled out of airport security lines.<eos> That's because you lost your passport three times.<eos> I lost it twice.<eos> - No, three times.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I don't want to talk about this anymore.<eos> I am really disappointed in you.
I asked her to heat up a pizza.<eos> She said, "Go and do it yourself!"<eos> I got scared.<eos> It's been two weeks.<eos> Isn't this a bit much for just eating pork?<eos> It's not about eating pork. It's not about the religion.<eos> It's about you ignoring us, not realizing who you are.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You see, our parents raised us to be a good Muslim.<eos> When you went out to school, we gave you a Qur'an.
You might want to see this.<eos> Thanks, babe. Yeah.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Had too man fries, I guess.<eos> You need your strength.<eos> Heard y'all want to leave.<eos> Forget about the plan?<eos> Kay!<eos> You would have died on the streets without Zeke.<eos> And what about you, Germ, huh?

They can always buy more.<eos> It ain't the plan.<eos> Plans change.<eos> Like I said, we gotta stick together.<eos> All right, I mean, think about Kay.<eos> She sees that you're strong, she's gonna stay strong, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There, that's my boy.<eos> I could use another taste.<eos> How about you?
The others must have hid.<eos> She said she saw a green van peel out of here around 1 a.m.<eos> Did the clerk get a make and model?<eos> Unfortunately not.<eos> She thought maybe mid-'70s, but she just didn't think much of it at the time.<eos> Garcia.<eos> What's cracking, crime-fighters?<eos> We found a Texas driver's license of our latest victim,<eos> Kevin Jones, date of birth December 18, 1991.<eos> I texted it to you, but it they wanted to keep low, it could be a fake.
It's called a minimax algorithm.<eos> You can use it for all finite Two-person zero-sum games.<eos> To give you the optimum game strategy.<eos> Soon algorithms will run the world. Whoever writes them will have the power.<eos> The americans realized ages ago.<eos> Your medicine.<eos> They know they can only Remain the supreme power. If they intercept the whole world's Internet traffic.<eos> The whole world!<eos> The americans are Building us a trojan horse.<eos> But I can teach you how to fight it.
No trouble.<eos> It's on my way.<eos> Mom?<eos> Hey, you must be leon, right?<eos> I just brought your mom a cool game.<eos> I wonder if you'll like it.<eos> Who is that, mom?<eos> This is my boss.<eos> It turned out really great.<eos> You'll like it.
But then I didn't hear from him for ages.<eos> Then that email came That I didn't understand.<eos> Go on.<eos> Dalton told me Case was onto something big.<eos> He had the bnd after him, Maybe even the nsa.<eos> I didn't take it seriously at first.<eos> When I got the email, I went to see case and... - he was dead.<eos> I thought maybe he was right after all.<eos> So why should I trust you of all people?<eos> I'll turn you into a terrorist, lukas.
What are we doing here?<eos> Waiting.<eos> What do you mean waiting?<eos> We've no other choice. We wait here.<eos> I can't wait here.<eos> - But you can't Head back out there.<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Screw this. Fuck!<eos> - Trust me!<eos> I don't even know who you are, So why should I trust you?

I don't even know who you are, So why should I trust you?<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Case asked me four weeks ago if I was interested in breaking a story.<eos> He was onto something big.<eos> Now you tell me?<eos> Why didn't you tell me before?<eos> Why didn't you say that before?<eos> I didn't know you either.<eos> How was I to know I could trust you?

I didn't know you either.<eos> How was I to know I could trust you?<eos> Did he tell you anything else?<eos> He was onto a Secret nsa program: Burning man.<eos> He had information on it.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> It's all connected.<eos> What?<eos> - 1.8 by 10 to the 10.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?
Yes.<eos> Why not?<eos> I have to go.<eos> - Okay? - Sure.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Look after yourself.<eos> Sorry...<eos> I didn't know...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The cops are after you.
I have to go.<eos> - Okay? - Sure.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Look after yourself.<eos> Sorry...<eos> I didn't know...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The cops are after you.<eos> Piss off!<eos> 1.8 by 10 to the ten, That mean anything to you?
What have you done?<eos> He put me under pressure.<eos> He threatened to hurt him.<eos> Who?<eos> Slomo.<eos> What did he want?<eos> To...<eos> To know what you're planning.<eos> You didn't!<eos> Because of you, I'm wanted for murder!
To know what you're planning.<eos> You didn't!<eos> Because of you, I'm wanted for murder!<eos> My wife doesn't recognize me.<eos> Everyone thinks I'm sick.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> We always have a choice.<eos> You should have warned me.<eos> You could have helped me, But you play your little games And talk of trust and...<eos> I believed you!

We need someone we can trust. I know who can help.<eos> - Lukas!<eos> - (Lukas:) I need your help.<eos> He's got my son.<eos> (Marc:) Okay. Out of the car.<eos> Hurry.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Do you know what this is?<eos> This is your secret agent equipment.<eos> Wizzy brought you this. Cool!
- (Shots fired) - (Marc crying out)<eos> (Marc:) Ha! Who's the winner after all?<eos> (Ethereal music)<eos> So you never found the access code.<eos> No.<eos> And you still don't know what it is? Burning Man?<eos> I'm honestly quite happy that I don't know.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No, we're done.<eos> (Lukas:) I don't know how I'll ever thank you for this.
Previously on "Criminal Minds"...<eos> I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent.<eos> That's great.<eos> Well, I made an offer.<eos> I'm expecting a response tomorrow and my fingers are crossed it'll be a yes.<eos> But I can tell you this agent's been with the bureau nearly 20 years, And we met on a case for Interpol.

All right.<eos> Look, if you need anything, you just call me, ok?<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Everything quiet on the homefront?<eos> No.<eos> My daughter and my grandson are sleeping in the safe house, and her mother, well, she never loved the perks of this job to begin with.<eos> You should go home and get some rest.<eos> Is this you being the compassionate boss?<eos> No, this is me being the compassionate friend.<eos> You keep burning the candle at both ends, There won't be much of you left.
I want to say thank you, though, agent Rossi,<eos> - for everything.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard about agent Clark.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> I liked him, too.<eos> I never told you this, But the first case I worked after I took your class...
But we got the cell.<eos> They were planning to bomb a soccer match, and it would have been a catastrophe.<eos> I never heard about that.<eos> Joint Taskforce with the CIA.<eos> They kept it quiet.<eos> You can't... blame yourself, you know.<eos> Those deep cover agents, they volunteered.<eos> I don't.<eos> At least not anymore.<eos> And that's because of you.
You can't... blame yourself, you know.<eos> Those deep cover agents, they volunteered.<eos> I don't.<eos> At least not anymore.<eos> And that's because of you.<eos> We save lives, and that's all that matters.<eos> And every life we save, it's a win.<eos> You taught me that.<eos> "The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living."<eos> Marcus Tullius Cicero, and a lot of people are living because of you.
- Why not?<eos> - Because he's dead.<eos> He got hit by a car, a Saab, and I just didn't have time to call you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this is probably devastating for you.<eos> I mean, I've had a week, so, I've kind of moved through it.<eos> But, uh, I have the number of the woman that hit him, if you wanna call her and cry.<eos> Do you wanna call her and cry? I don't want you to cry here.<eos> - You belong in an asylum.<eos> - You'd love that, wouldn't you?
Trying to keep a safe distance from my pal Debbie.<eos> - It's a party. Don't overthink it.<eos> - Last time I went to a party with Debbie, I got drunk and slept with her husband.<eos> Well, lucky for you, he's not invited this time.<eos> - Melrose, can we all fit?<eos> - Oh, no, are you kidding?<eos> Guys, I've had ten strippers and a baby pool in this puppy.<eos> Cram your asses in here!<eos> Come on, get in.<eos> I'll ride with you.
This is my first Hollywood party.<eos> Are you tripping?<eos> We're appreciating this piece of art.<eos> Oh, yeah. I like art that tells you exactly what it is.<eos> - Can you give us a little alone time?<eos> - Oh, don't mind me.<eos> I'm just hiding from Debbie.<eos> I'll go.<eos> So, what is this, the old Malibu ambush?<eos> You gonna ply me with some drinks and tell me you don't like my vision?
Sam, I hired you to direct a wrestling show.<eos> Which I came up with. It was my idea.<eos> It was the seed of an idea.<eos> - I'm... I'm trying to elevate the form.<eos> - And that is so bitchin', but can you maybe also not do that?<eos> When I said I wanted something different,<eos> I meant the way "Ms. Pac-Man" is different from "Pac-Man."<eos> As in, almost the exact same thing, but with a bow in her hair.<eos> Not set in the desert after a nuclear war.<eos> Oh, okay. So, I see, you don't want story.
I thought I was gonna like...<eos> "Oh, Bob Mackie! I need that."<eos> But I don't even know who this is.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. - It's a stranger.<eos> We just gotta strip you down to your essence here.<eos> Naked already?<eos> You see me.<eos> I am raising a baby with someone I can't even talk to.<eos> And if I leave him, where do I live?<eos> Do I live here with you?
Stupid.<eos> He is so stupid.<eos> Flor... when you cheat on your wife... don't admit everything to her.<eos> Lie.<eos> Lie to her, Flor.<eos> Flor, I'm gonna sit down on the floor.<eos> I feel like I'm losing my mind every 20 minutes.<eos> Twenty minutes is... about as long as I can possibly pretend that everything's okay.<eos> And I don't have anybody to talk to about it.<eos> Except you.
Sam, your ideas are so complicated.<eos> Okay?<eos> Check this chick out, right?<eos> - Me?<eos> - This is clear. She's a sexy party girl.<eos> And she's a rip-off of Madonna, who is so huge right now.<eos> - What?<eos> - And this one.<eos> She walks into the ring, there's no backstory, there's no dialogue about where she came from.<eos> Look. What's the first thing that jumps out at you?
What is it?<eos> Junkchain.<eos> I'm Junkchain, and I bring the pain.<eos> Peace.<eos> - I'm Ethel.<eos> - I'm Edna.<eos> And we're the Beat Down Biddies.<eos> You want a piece of me? I got moles older than you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll come at you. I'm like a good fiber cereal.<eos> I'll make you shit your pants!
That Asians work really hard, but also do karate and are really shy?<eos> - You mad about something?<eos> - Hey, Sam.<eos> Watch this.<eos> Nice!<eos> I call it a Lebanese Cannonball.<eos> Beirut's signature move.<eos> - Can you do it in the ring?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Hey, Mr. Director, I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
Like my first feature credit.<eos> Swamp Maidens of the Viet Cong.<eos> Watch it.<eos> This one, Gina the Machina.<eos> This thing? So offensive, it was banned in 49 states.<eos> Pretty proud of that.<eos> Look at these.<eos> Couch of Pain, Blood Disco, Blood Disco Two.<eos> You should watch these.<eos> I mean, bring them back, but... you know, take them, maybe make notes.

No.<eos> God, what is this?<eos> An acceptance speech?<eos> You know I get flustered.<eos> I've been reading a book about marriage.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> A book is really gonna help save this.<eos> I am moving back in.<eos> I have been sleeping on my cousin's couch for two weeks.<eos> - I have given you space.

This is my house.<eos> Now... can I put Randy to bed, please?<eos> You wanna sleep here?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Shit.<eos> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> Is that dead?<eos> What is that?<eos> It was a squirrel.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
You goddamn... wolf.<eos> - You just called me a wolf.<eos> - What?<eos> You just called me a goddamn wolf!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, most people call me a freak, so... thank you.<eos> I've worn this... or some version of this, every day for the past five years.<eos> It's not a costume.<eos> Just me.<eos> And what I do in the morning... what I put on, what I wear... it's not for you.
So, I've just been practicing some landings.<eos> Um, so, if I did like a jump off the ropes type thing,<eos> I could sort of land in like a somersault-y, um... type thing.<eos> I could just mark it for you.<eos> And reset.<eos> Anyway.<eos> And then, um... And then my, uh, character is... is Liberty Belle. She's the all-American hero.<eos> Uh, she's kind of like the role model for kids.<eos> Um, so, I could then say something like... Like...<eos> "Be all that you can be."
Not your problem?<eos> We're guests at this hotel.<eos> And our TV keeps fuzzing out.<eos> It says "free TV," not "free TVs."<eos> You want watch? Go to room of another prostitute.<eos> Wrong number.<eos> Is the animal handler.<eos> He injects his homosexual lover... with venom of snake.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> In Soviet Union, television watches you.
Ice Cream Gulag.<eos> There, you go in, it's so cold, you die.<eos> I like you like this.<eos> I like you more than I usually like you.<eos> Is because you are weak American.<eos> I will destroy all you hold dear.<eos> Russians, best villains since the Nazis.<eos> It's too bad you can't do it for real.<eos> Why can't I?<eos> Well, if you're Russian, you have to fight the all-American hero, and Debbie's not talking to you.
I understand how to do that.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Steel Horse! Steel Horse!<eos> My brother said he's super nice.<eos> Hi, Dale.<eos> I'm Carmen, Tom and Kurt's little sister.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sure.<eos> We just wanted to come back and tell you how amazing that was.
Oh, good morning.<eos> I'm so sorry, I, uh...<eos> Well, had a little bit of an emergency.<eos> Well, everything's fine, but...<eos> I'm just gonna grab my keys, and...<eos> Oh... no smoking.<eos> Keith thinks I quit.<eos> Well, it's my first pack since Randy was born, so...<eos> did Steel Horse live up to the name?<eos> - They told you.
Yeah?<eos> - Hello. - Hi. I never got your email.<eos> I'm sending it now.<eos> I'm sorry, am I at 211?<eos> This is 207.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> No problem.<eos> Alice, leave. At once.<eos> I realized Alice had left.<eos> I followed you from McMillan.
- Not yet, not yet.<eos> Lakeman locks down the paperwork.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> - You're my husband. Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I just, whenever I think about that, I feel so lucky.<eos> Okay, well, I have to tell you something, honey.
Then what help are you, man?<eos> This is a song about somebody I killed.<eos> If I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.<eos> Fuck your rules, this concerns John.<eos> I'm putting my foot down.<eos> Fuck your foot. I should be at home with Efram, instead of helping you do this fucking shit.<eos> Well, stop!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?
Fuck your foot. I should be at home with Efram, instead of helping you do this fucking shit.<eos> Well, stop!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> The doctors couldn't find anything wrong.<eos> I mean you took a hell of a wallop but they said there were no...<eos> Nothing's broken, nothing's...<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> No, you're not all right..
What time is it?<eos> It's lay down.<eos> That's what fucking time it is.<eos> It's 1:35.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Just stay there, John.<eos> Are you really unhurt?<eos> Because the girl gets out in 25 minutes. With the bag...<eos> Lay down. Just lay there, John.<eos> So you're saying you're okay.
She hogs the ring and the story makes no sense.<eos> - Find someone else.<eos> - Maybe you're too picky.<eos> Am I?<eos> Or am I your headliner?<eos> Unless you've got some other name-brand actress hiding under the bleachers.<eos> No, you know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> We'll just keep going until we find somebody you're comfortable with.
And you love this shit.<eos> You love being a temperamental star.<eos> I know you do.<eos> If you were at home with that kid, your life would become just anger and resentment.<eos> No work, no husband.<eos> You would burn up in a smoldering ash heap of rage and disappointment.<eos> You think that's good for you or your boring baby?<eos> It's not.<eos> Look.<eos> - Ruth is the right match for you.
Your wrestling has really improved.<eos> Oh, no, we're both gonna look like assholes.<eos> I mean, Cherry's moves are amateur hour.<eos> There's no impact, and it's not exciting.<eos> At the men's match, Steel Horse rode in on a motorcycle and did, like, I don't... backflips and shit.<eos> You went to a wrestling match?<eos> Yeah, you're not the only one who does research.<eos> Well...<eos> I'll put in extra time, happily.<eos> Whatever you want.

Do you think they'll do it?<eos> Do you not see what I see?<eos> You doing great, girls.<eos> So, do I grab onto a specific body part?<eos> You sort of grab everything and fall backwards.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're not gonna drop me, right?<eos> No, I swear.<eos> I got you.<eos> It's like a fucking trust fall, only I stare at your face and remember all the reasons I don't trust you.
You're not gonna need luck.<eos> I scripted the match so you'll win.<eos> Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.<eos> We all saw it.<eos> Just go get ready.<eos> Now.<eos> What'd you do to her? Why is she framing you?
But Ruth?<eos> We're working together.<eos> Is this some sort of elaborate ploy?<eos> You sound crazy.<eos> I sound crazy?<eos> You joined a wrestling television show.<eos> Yeah, I guess you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can't...<eos> Put... Fuck.<eos> It wasn't a fucking trailer park.<eos> I was watching you and I was like, "I don't even know who this woman is.
No, like a man who's sick of wondering where the fuck his wife and child are.<eos> And then the Russian guy at the desk was kind enough to invite me to the live girl-on-girl wrestling match starring daytime television's former Laura Morgan.<eos> Which is also mind-blowing.<eos> You put your name on this trash?<eos> Fuck you, Mark!<eos> You always fucking do this.<eos> Whatever success I have, whatever good thing that I have built, you wanna piss all over it.<eos> Fine, here.<eos> What, are these fucking divorce papers?<eos> Guess you better get yourself a lawyer.
Here you go.<eos> Signed, sealed, notarized. Fuck you!<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> Hi, I love you.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I don't accept this.<eos> How can you not?<eos> You're the one who served me.<eos> I was freaking out.<eos> I couldn't find you, I couldn't even talk to you.
I had to get some power back in this situation.<eos> - The balance was off.<eos> - Well, it's too late.<eos> I already made another copy and sent it to my lawyer.<eos> No lawyer is gonna let you sign a document that guarantees me - ten percent of all your future income.<eos> - What?<eos> It was a dramatic gesture.<eos> Oh, how actress-y of you.<eos> I claimed you were having an affair with Burt Reynolds.<eos> I never actually intended to hand the papers to you.

Did the movement involve blood sacrifice?<eos> - Your girlfriend is quite the comedian.<eos> - We're not...<eos> - She's not my girlfriend.<eos> - If you want the space, it's 9,000, and I would need 4,500 to hold the booking.<eos> Take your time.<eos> I mean, the place looked great in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.<eos> "Snakes.<eos> I hate snakes."<eos> What's the matter with you?
I mean, this could either feel dinky or it could feel epic, so, let's go big, let's make it visceral, let's make it like a...<eos> But I'll leave enough room around the sides of the stage so, I can get in with the handheld, so, we can feel the struggle, the drama, the victory, the defeat.<eos> The glitter.<eos> - Are you making fun of me?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> Honestly.<eos> I think... honestly... it's perfect.<eos> Told you.<eos> Are you waiting for me to open the door for you?
- Cool.<eos> Party. Party.<eos> Today's your birthday... birthday, birthday.<eos> Birthday, birthday.<eos> - You're really coming, right?<eos> - I'm right behind you.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> It's like a murder scene in there.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'll just dock you for the sheets out of your paycheck.
It's Sheila's birthday.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> I mean, look, I'll go with you.<eos> We'll get a cake, it'll be a date.<eos> It'll be... It'll be fun.<eos> You don't actually like me, Sam.<eos> You're just afraid to be alone.<eos> What do you mean I don't like you?<eos> I just had period sex with you.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> I had my own hostage situation here.<eos> Those hijackers have nothing on this little terrorist.<eos> I will be back at five.<eos> Don't make me wait, Mark.<eos> - Are you taking off?<eos> - I have practice in an hour.<eos> It's in an hour.<eos> I could have three meals in an hour.<eos> Um, well... I am not staying for you.
We used that money to remodel the deck.<eos> So, all I had to do to get you over to the house was freeze your trust.<eos> Heh. I'll remember that.<eos> Oh, hand me my readers.<eos> What's with the seating chart?<eos> Lily getting remarried?<eos> Very funny.<eos> No, your sister left the Persian months ago.<eos> I'm having a fund-raiser for Nancy's Just Say No campaign.<eos> I sent you the details.
You have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in less than three months.<eos> Unless you're running for office, I can't possibly imagine where all the money has gone.<eos> I'm producing a women's wrestling show for KDTV.<eos> Yes, it's real.<eos> It's the first time I've put your money into something I care about.<eos> And I just need 9,000 more dollars so I can finish what I started.<eos> Just say yes. - That's off-message.<eos> - Think of it like an investment.<eos> An opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a really exciting new venture.<eos> I don't have any specs, but I can get you a business plan.

And who knows if anyone's gonna watch this?<eos> - We are not that good.<eos> - I know, but...<eos> Sometimes I'm so sad you took away the option of us ever being able to have a normal fucking conversation.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Sam?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I didn't recognize you.<eos> Thanks?<eos> - Can I talk to you?
She's wonderful.<eos> She cuts my fruit up into little pieces.<eos> You know, I've always been embarrassed by Bash's obsession with wrestling.<eos> I've been embarrassed by a lot of things my son chooses to spend his time doing... but wrestling always sounded like... pure trash.<eos> But what you said... now that is the first time I have come close to getting what all the fuss is about.<eos> So... thank you.<eos> Now, tell me again, what do you need?<eos> - Nine thousand for a venue?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not giving you any more money.
Previously on The Royals...<eos> Take a shot.<eos> You're gonna keep getting back up, that's what you do, but I will keep putting you back down.<eos> I told you I wouldn't be the girl waiting for you to show up, Liam, and yet here I am, waiting for you to show up.

They're testing Big Ben.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> I've got to go and inherit the throne to the greatest empire the world has ever known.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> I've been ready my entire life.<eos> ♪<eos> All rise!<eos> Liam?<eos> Liam!<eos> - I need to talk to you.
Are the claimants... ..ready to speak?<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi?<eos> "Hi"?<eos> That's what you're going with?<eos> - It's really good to see you. - Where the hell did you go?<eos> I had some stuff I had to take care of.<eos> The less you know, the better. I've been sitting in silence... ..wondering what the hell I did wrong.<eos> Texting you like a pathetic loser, crying every night and you just show up like nothing even happened.

You be sorry, Jasper.<eos> You enjoy that.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Rosie...<eos> - You need to step away.<eos> - Helena, please, Len...<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Are you gonna shoot me, honey?<eos> Call me "Honey" again, I am.<eos> You'd better make sure your safety's off because, I assure you, mine is.
If you do shoot him, aim for the heart.<eos> He already broke mine.<eos> That's the last time you ever aim your weapon at me and live to tell about it.<eos> The file came from your computer.<eos> Our digital forensics team verified it.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> It looks like it was.<eos> Dave, how long have we known each other?<eos> 30 years?<eos> I'm telling you it wasn't me.

He's not a traitor, gentlemen, he's a hero.<eos> Uncuff him.<eos> Uncuff him, for God's sake!<eos> I appreciate your service, gentlemen, and I'll be happy to talk to anyone who needs more clarification.<eos> You'll likely have to do that, Your Highness.<eos> I'll see you out.<eos> Was any of that true?<eos> I should've stayed a detective.<eos> I'm so sorry, James.<eos> I never meant to cause you or Sara Alice any harm.
I personally like this one better.<eos> You would.<eos> Nice drugs.<eos> I don't do them much these days,<eos> I just keep them around in case of emergency, or if guests pop in, obviously.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> No. I've got a shipment coming in from Morocco soon.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> So, I want to talk to you about my latest project.
Help yourself.<eos> No. I've got a shipment coming in from Morocco soon.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> So, I want to talk to you about my latest project.<eos> My family owns quite a bit of coastal real estate all over the world.<eos> Most of these properties are empty and a bit faded, so I plan to restyle and rebrand them as boutique hotels.<eos> Like the Chateau Marmont's way cooler little brother.<eos> - Ooh, or little sister. - Or little sister.<eos> Which brings me to you.
Hey.<eos> I'm not supposed to be here, but I wanted to come and see you, because I need to try and explain myself.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I don't want you to.<eos> I got fired today... ..because I took a file of classified information and I gave it to a reporter.<eos> I did that because the reporter knew about my past and I was trying...<eos> I'm leaving soon.<eos> After the coronation.<eos> I'm gonna be someone more than a princess.<eos> I'm leaving this behind, including you.

It means the Fickle Ferry isn't running at all.<eos> Then how are we gonna get to Curdled Cave?<eos> Pirate style.<eos> There is also fine print attached to this sad tale.<eos> A number of concerned people are worried that if you watch the Baudelaire orphans steal a sailboat and sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman...<eos> We're gonna steal a sailboat, sail across Lake Lachrymose in the middle of Hurricane Herman.<eos> you might be tempted to do such a thing yourself.<eos> We're stealing these, too.<eos> So allow me to offer you a piece of advice, even though I don't know anything about you.<eos> Do not take a sailboat that does not belong to you.
LEMONY: "Seeing in black and white" is a way of saying that a person looks at the world in a manner that is oversimplified and often incorrect.<eos> Like many newspapers, the Daily Punctilio is printed in black and white, and its look at the world is oversimplified and often incorrect.<eos> The death of noted scientist Dr. Montgomery Montgomery was not due to snake allergies.<eos> The destruction of Josephine Anwhistle's home was not the work of a cabal of real estate agents.<eos> Lemony Snicket is not dead.<eos> I am sorry to say that there was not a terrible accident at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill during the Baudelaires' time there.<eos> There were two.<eos> It is my duty to report these events correctly, the way they actually happened.<eos> But if you prefer to look at the world in black and white, then you should avert your eyes or pick up a newspaper instead.<eos> Because I know the shocking truth behind the accidents at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill, and I can assure you... it's better if you can't see.
Dolores, avert your eyes!<eos> - (GRUNTS) - But, Dolores, no!<eos> Those people are wrong.<eos> The Encyclopedia Hypnotica tells of a woman who, whenever she'd hear the word "omelet," would cluck like a chicken.<eos> (CLUCKING) - What are you doing? - (CLUCKS)<eos> And a man who, upon hearing the word "Nero,"<eos> could suddenly play an instrument he'd never studied.<eos> Dolores, put down that violin!<eos> The Encyclopedia Hypnotica does not mention the fatal accident that happened during the Baudelaires' time at Lucky Smells Lumbermill.<eos> "Fatal" is a word here which means "caused the death of one person who... it is my solemn duty to inform you... was not Phil."

I dated you! - Secret words? - (SHIRLEY AND ORWELL BICKER)<eos> According to the Encyclopedia Hypnotica, a hypnotist chooses one word to induce hypnotic suggestion, like "Nero" or... or "omelet," and another one to break it.<eos> Charles, would you tell Dr. Orwell to please stop bringing up the past?<eos> Stop bringing up the past.<eos> Charles, would you tell Count Olaf to stop talking in that voice?<eos> Stop talking in that voice.<eos> - (AS OLAF) You drank all of my wine.<eos> - You poisoned my coffee.<eos> - You tried to hypnotize me!<eos> - It was the only way to shut you up!
Our parents wanted us to be safe.<eos> We don't know what they wanted.<eos> Not anymore. We don't know why they were in Paltryville. We don't know why there were so many things they never told us.<eos> But we do know how we remember them.<eos> And the parents I remember would've wanted us to help.<eos> Then we go back.<eos> Trying to run away, are ya?<eos> SIR: I'm not an idiot.<eos> I've been trying to figure out what to do with you since you caused that accident that crushed a man's debarker dispenser.<eos> That glib attitude will get you nowhere.
Nice try.<eos> But did you really think we'd use the same word on your bratty brother that we used on the mill workers?<eos> You will never find the word to save your brother.<eos> And you certainly won't find it in time to save Charles.<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me! OLAF: Sorry, Charlie.<eos> No one's coming to help you now.<eos> CHARLES:<eos> Where did the girl go?<eos> Perhaps you've been told never to shout "fire" in a public place.
Lucky, push!<eos> - Lucky, pull!<eos> - ORWELL: Lucky! Don't listen to your sister.<eos> Hey, why didn't you think of that?<eos> I just stopped by to see if everything was running smoothly, and I'm glad I did.<eos> - Because it wasn't.<eos> - Ah!<eos> How did you even get inside? There's an angry mob at the door.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't trust you with all my secrets.
I don't trust you with all my secrets.<eos> You know, they say holding a baby can make all these deep, primal parenting instincts kick in.<eos> - I don't see it.<eos> Lucky... would you like to send that log into that saw?<eos> - (WORKERS CLAMORING) - NORMA RAE:<eos> You think you're so superior, with your fancy optometry degree and weird hypnosis thing.<eos> Well, I don't need a partner.<eos> I was better off alone, where my plots were simple and straightforward and didn't involve any high-concept science fiction gimmicks.<eos> Are you breaking up with me again?<eos> No, I'm breaking up with you...
Oh, no, you can't.<eos> (PANTING) Now put my sister down.<eos> Yes, you may have saved Charles, but there will still be a fatal accident at the lumbermill tonight.<eos> - Oh, there you are.<eos> - (BABBLES) If you want our fortune, you can have it.<eos> Just leave Sunny alone!<eos> You think you're so clever, but you only see in black and white.<eos> Just like your parents. They were shortsighted, too.<eos> With their, "You can't hypnotize people!" And, "What about free will?"<eos> And, "We're going to kick you out and have your license revoked, and if we ever have children, we're never gonna let you anywhere near them!"
He's brokenhearted, and he wants very much to forget the whole thing.<eos> So he isn't just knocking on Dr. Orwell's door because he needs something for himself?<eos> No.<eos> He's just in town, looking for Dr. Georgina Orwell, in the hopes of somehow making things right.<eos> Because life is so short, it is so rare to meet, to find someone who shares one's brilliance, one's charm, one's dubious moral code in a world gone gloriously wrong.<eos> Such people must stick together like comrades, like partners, like...<eos> You've changed your hair. Olaf.<eos> Georgina.<eos> I swore I would never let you darken my door again.<eos> I took a solemn oath that my office would be closed to you forever, even during regular business hours.
Mother?<eos> Father!<eos> - Get over here, you three.<eos> - How was your work trip? Mrs. Quagmire:<eos> Oh, we're just happy to be home.<eos> How did you hurt your leg?<eos> Breaking out of prison in Peru.<eos> I beg you, turn this program off now.<eos> Imagine this story has a happy ending.<eos> You can pretend the woman at the door is the Duchess of Winnipeg, and she's come to throw the Baudelaires a pony party at her chateau.
I never intended for any of that to happen.<eos> Yet, you still said nothing.<eos> So now I'm supposed to feel guilty for something you did?<eos> Well, how about feeling guilty about something you did?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you ask Reggie?<eos> Hey, hell of an article.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> I never blamed you for making that call.
Hmm. Not silencing millions with your hetero-supremacy.<eos> -Ah, that's right.<eos> -[announcer] Three, two, one. Go!<eos> Hey, uh, you going to the Griffin Day thing?<eos> Yes, to wave and smile and be seen as a sign that racism is over.<eos> How reassuring.<eos> I was supposed to cover it, though, I was thinking, what if I turned my parade story into a story about you?<eos> You shit-fucking turd!<eos> Sure.<eos> Have you been formally diagnosed with Tourette's?
Nice speech, Mr. President. [Sam] Mm, yeah.<eos> Not a single racist got a pardon and you promoted fire safety. Way to go.<eos> [Troy] I'm surprised to see you two here.<eos> You know, floats and marching bands and... actually, celebration of any kind just doesn't seem like your thing.<eos> [Reggie] It's not.<eos> Couldn't give two fucks about a Griffin.<eos> [Troy] "I can't breath"?<eos> What?<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> You should have caught that.
Could use you on the Pastiche staff.<eos> Yeah, it's the least you could do, considering how much Troy has done for you.<eos> Sam, please, I don't think I can survive such a hostile learning environment.<eos> I think I need a safe space.<eos> Where will you ever find anyone who can relate to your experiences?<eos> God, our repartee is magic.<eos> We'd really make a dynamic duo, hmm?<eos> Sure, walk away.<eos> I have a feeling we'll be seeing her byline in Pastiche soon enough.<eos> Do you get off on being an asshole?
I'm not exactly fluent, but was that straight for, "I'd hit that"?<eos> Or, "I already hit that"? -[chuckles]<eos> -What?<eos> But she's faculty.<eos> And she has a fiancée.<eos> And she's... gay.<eos> No, she's not when she's with me.<eos> -What about Coco?<eos> -What about Coco?<eos> Look, am I here with Coco, or am I here with you?
My dad makes me do these, uh...<eos> Drug tests?<eos> Really?<eos> Remember your freshman year?<eos> Well, mine's a bit of a blur.<eos> Patronizing sigh.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> You're a lifesaver. [chuckles]<eos> Lady, I can mix you something way better at the bar.
Convincing.<eos> [strained] I'll be back. Excuse me.<eos> [heaving]<eos> Your assignment was to cover the parade, not go on a bender with Troy.<eos> I'll get you your article on the parade.<eos> It was pretty uneventful.<eos> Kurt Fletcher and Pastiche handed out their latest issue.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call that uneventful.<eos> People have been snapping and tweeting about it.<eos> And you weren't there to cover any of it because you're on, what? A date?
Give me this magazine, you--<eos> Oh, you think that's a picture of you? You?<eos> Who puts the... [Sam shouting] -Who does that?<eos> -[Reggie] Give me that shit!<eos> -Your freedom of speech is on the line? -[knock on door]<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Empty inside. [chuckles]<eos> You, uh, want to watch something?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> I just gotta finish up some work, and I'll join you in a bit.
You'll want to hurry and eat if you're to meet the train on time.<eos> I pray this isn't foolishness... but it's too late now.<eos> We made a practical decision; we'll just have to hope for the best.<eos> With any luck, Mrs. Spencer will have picked out a good one;<eos> a hard worker and obedient like we asked for.<eos> I couldn't tolerate a lazy boy or a sullen boy. No, I couldn't abide it and I wouldn't.<eos> In spite of all the worry, I'm relieved to know that you'll have a regular hand about the place. You can't buy loyalty.<eos> You coming in sometime today?<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, you must be in a state.
You want these children to starve to death?<eos> Do something right for a change! You're more trouble than you're worth.<eos> Nothing but a miserable piece of trash!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> We'll see what Mr. Hammond has to say about this when he gets home.<eos> Are you quite all right, dear?<eos> I like imagining better than remembering.<eos> Why are the worst memories the most insistent? I wouldn't know.<eos> Try to rest.<eos> "If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, but your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends."
Oh, for heaven's sake, child, what are you doing on the ground?<eos> Now, you listen here and stand up.<eos> - What do you make of this?<eos> - I, uh... I figure... she's traveled a long way to be disappointed.<eos> Well, she shouldn't be here.<eos> You should never have brought her home.<eos> She's had a shock. She's not the only one.<eos> Enough of this foolishness.<eos> Come along inside.<eos> I'm speaking to you, child.
I can see it plain as plain you want to keep her.<eos> She's a real interesting kind of person.<eos> That's one way to put it.<eos> You should've heard her talk coming from the station.<eos> She can talk fast enough and it's nothing in her favour.<eos> I don't mind the conversation.<eos> I don't like children who have so much to say.<eos> There's something I don't understand about her.<eos> No, she's got to be dispatched straight way back where she came from.<eos> I could hire a boy to help me and, uh... she could be company for you.
A reason?<eos> My family wasn't inclined toward idle chatter.<eos> Do you miss your parents terribly?<eos> They lived good, Christian lives.<eos> You can't begrudge God for bringing them home.<eos> I suppose not.<eos> You suppose not?<eos> Why is it you find yourself an orphan?<eos> It happened when I was an infant.<eos> I'd like to know the circumstances, if you've a mind to tell them.
- Oh, dear Lord!<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Shhh. It's all right.<eos> It's all right, Belle. There's no need to worry anymore, Belle.<eos> - Belle?<eos> - That's her name.<eos> Wasn't that an adventure?<eos> Wasn't it just.<eos> - You're sure you're all right?
I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off.<eos> That is a very untidy habit and I can't allow it.<eos> You must fold your clothing neatly and place it on the chair.<eos> I haven't any use for little girls who aren't neat.<eos> I was so harrowed up in my mind last night, I didn't think about my clothes at all.<eos> I'll fold them nicely tonight.<eos> Although I have been known to forget.<eos> I'm usually in such a hurry to finally get to bed.<eos> Well, you'll have to remember if you're going to stay here.<eos> You understand that you're on trial, yes?
I like this prayer.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name!<eos> It's like a line of music.<eos> Just get on with the business of learning it.<eos> "Our Father, who art in heaven"...<eos> Regardless of the outcome here, you should have something to wear besides that flimsy bit of business.<eos> I have a leftover piece of cotton on a bolt that may do nicely.<eos> You're going to make me a dress?<eos> You need something suitable that fits you. A new dress!
Don't worry yourself.<eos> I feel too sorry for you to have any anger left in my mind.<eos> But if you will take my advice you will have that "talking-to" with a fair-sized birch switch, and get her on the next train out.<eos> Goodbye, Marilla.<eos> She'll make her own way home.<eos> She's in her under things, so she's gotta come back.<eos> The girl needs to learn some sense. I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have lost my temper and embarrassed you in front of Mrs. Lynde.<eos> - I hope you can forgive me. - Are you all right? - Yes.<eos> - I'm sorry for worrying you.
It was a great satisfaction.<eos> In fact, I can't even imagine... that I'm sorry.<eos> Well, let's hope your imagination is in better working order by morning.<eos> You can't send her back over this. Don't be so sure.<eos> Oh, it's... it's good that, uh...<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, I'm astonished at you.<eos> And you'll take her up a meal?<eos> When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behaviour?<eos> But she'll stay up there until she's willing to apologize and that is final!<eos> How's by you, Anne?
I am a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable society forever!<eos> It was awful of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth. And it was the truth.<eos> Every word you said was true.<eos> My hair is red and I am freckled and skinny and ugly!<eos> Now, what I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it!<eos> Oh, Mrs. Lynde, please, please say you can forgive me!<eos> If you refuse, oh, it'll be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl.<eos> Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde! There, there.<eos> Get up, child. Of course I forgive you.<eos> I guess I was a little hard on you, but I'm just an outspoken person.
It'll ease Marilla's mind... that I've got help.<eos> Matthew... are you sure you still want me to stay?<eos> The thing of it is, and Marilla won't admit this, but she's getting older, too.<eos> I'll go right in!<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> - Good day to you, Matthew. - William.<eos> Checking the perimeter?<eos> Anything I should know about?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about your new... acquisition.
Amethysts are so much more romantic.<eos> This was my grandmother's.<eos> My mother bequeathed it to me. Well, it's perfectly elegant.<eos> Are you ready to go?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> It's just... this is a meeting of great auspiciousness.<eos> It's her mother you've got to reckon with.<eos> If Mrs. Barry doesn't like you, it won't matter a wit how much Diana does.<eos> Whatever is the matter with you, child?
Please, call me Eliza.<eos> And... this must be Anne.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> Thank you for having us, Eliza.<eos> Marilla, Anne, please come in.<eos> I don't believe you said two words during tea.<eos> You didn't even remark on the cake.<eos> Mother let me help her bake it special.<eos> You enjoyed it... didn't you?
Did you take it?<eos> I was playing with it, but I didn't take it.<eos> - You were told not to touch it. - I'm sorry.<eos> It's just it's so beautiful, I couldn't resist.<eos> You were told to set the shawl on the chair.<eos> I did.<eos> I've looked everywhere and the brooch is nowhere to be found.<eos> Give it back. Right now.<eos> But I didn't take it, Miss Cuthbert. Honest, I didn't.<eos> I don't believe you.
If I do, can I stay here at Green Gables?<eos> Did you, or did you not, take the brooch?<eos> I lost it. I...<eos> I was... I was playing Lady Cordelia when I took the brooch outside with me.<eos> As I was drawing water from the well, I leaned over to make a wish and it fell in.<eos> I heard it make a splash as it disappeared down into the depths.<eos> I'm ever so sorry, Miss Cuthbert.<eos> Pack your things.<eos> But you said if I confessed I could stay!<eos> I told you that brooch meant a great deal to me.
I'll take you home.<eos> Raven, you need to slow down.<eos> Your brain scan showed evidence of a stroke.<eos> The door is stuck.<eos> Raven, it could kill you.<eos> We can't create nightblood unless we go to space, but Luna can.<eos> We can inject ourselves with her bone marrow.<eos> Then we become nightbloods.<eos> I bear it so they don't have to.<eos> One day, they will thank you for what you're doing here.
Raven.<eos> Becca?<eos> You can tell me that it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket?<eos> Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?<eos> You know this is dumb, right?<eos> We'll all be dead before anything grows.<eos> The earth survived praimfaya once.<eos> It will again.<eos> We do this for those who come after us.<eos> Let me show you.
My little boy's all grown up.<eos> So what?<eos> We hole up in a bunker now?<eos> Do everything Jaha says?<eos> Back to life on the ark?<eos> Now that is just crazy talk.<eos> Since when do we listen to what Jaha says?<eos> The tunnel's just through those woods. How long are you staying?<eos> If you forgot anything at the lab, let me know.<eos> Or I could keep you company.

You don't want to live in a bunker, and you don't want to be the good little soldier, always doing what Clarke tells you to do.<eos> I know what you do want.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> God, you're not...<eos> You're not real.<eos> You're just...<eos> That doesn't mean that I'm not right.<eos> What the hell do you want from me?<eos> I want to help you.
If I'm not back in an hour, my army will attack.<eos> You must be Gaia. - I'm...<eos> - I know who you are...<eos> Wanheda.<eos> You helped my people find the bunker.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you gave the flame to an unworthy king, who saw it destroyed.<eos> I am not as grateful.<eos> Let's see what all the fuss is about.<eos> After you, Wanheda.
We could share it equally.<eos> All of the clans can survive.<eos> That's what Lexa would have wanted.<eos> You're right.<eos> She would have.<eos> And if she were here, the clans might actually have obeyed her.<eos> But seeing that there's no commander to rule us... War it is.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know you have the flame.<eos> I know Octavia gave it to you.
Whatever the hell you want.<eos> Monty?<eos> Everyone left.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I love you, Harper.<eos> Change your mind?<eos> No.<eos> I'm here in case you guys change yours.<eos> Always the optimist.<eos> I love that about you.
I'm dying, Murphy.<eos> Come on.<eos> Abby said if you didn't use your brain, we...<eos> We're past that now.<eos> You're going to space?<eos> Have any idea what it feels like to be in pain every day?<eos> When I was spacewalking, everything was right.<eos> I just want that again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for doing this to you, raven.
He was in the tower.<eos> We sent some people for him, Bellamy, and Octavia.<eos> Bellamy was the only one we could get in time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Give me your radio.<eos> Marcus has his.<eos> The walkies are no good down here.<eos> Clarke.<eos> I'm letting them say good-bye.<eos> I understand your need to know, but I promise you there is nothing but more pain on the other side of that radio.
That's the third time today.<eos> Get the seizure kit.<eos> Jasper.<eos> Masquerade ball?<eos> Nice.<eos> You think this is a joke?<eos> Radiation levels are almost in the red.<eos> Why do you think everyone's getting sick?<eos> No more drugs.<eos> Harper, are you ok?
Jasper.<eos> Masquerade ball?<eos> Nice.<eos> You think this is a joke?<eos> Radiation levels are almost in the red.<eos> Why do you think everyone's getting sick?<eos> No more drugs.<eos> Harper, are you ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine.
Let him go, Monty.<eos> Move!<eos> Come on, Riley.<eos> Come on.<eos> Harper, get the med kit out of the Rover.<eos> Ok.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Look at his face.<eos> He's at peace.<eos> What's the matter with you?
We did the right thing, Clarke.<eos> Yesterday, we were right.<eos> Today, we have to live with being wrong.<eos> We're back on the Ark.<eos> Killing our own people so that... so that we can live.<eos> Locking them up.<eos> Bellamy's sister is out there.<eos> He would do anything to open that door.<eos> Do you think that's a risk we should take?<eos> No, but unlike you, I hate myself for it.
Ok.<eos> Good.<eos> In the meantime, Bellamy has a lot of friends in the guard.<eos> We need to put someone on his door that wants to survive more than be liked.<eos> I think I know someone like that.<eos> They're just gonna keep him locked up for 5 years?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Clarke, this is his sister we're talking about.<eos> I think we both know he's never just gonna let that go.<eos> Look, all I need to know from you is...

You and Jasper are my family.<eos> You're all I have left.<eos> We can face anything together.<eos> You're a fighter.<eos> You don't give up.<eos> That's why I love you.<eos> But I don't love you.<eos> - Harper...<eos> - God.<eos> Do I have to spell it out for you?
It's T-minus now and counting.<eos> Let's go for a walk in the stars.<eos> She's not going to space to die.<eos> She's going in the bunker to live.<eos> Even if this idea doesn't kill you, you will just be normal again.<eos> She was never normal.<eos> Maybe not, but with me in her brain, she's da Vinci, Einstein, Mozart.<eos> And I choose Raven Reyes over those 3 hacks any day and twice on Sunday.<eos> Enough. Raven, what makes you think that the future will be any different than the past?<eos> Even if you live, the pain will still be with you.
- Just get in.<eos> If I open the door... and everyone in this bunker dies... who will run the hydroponic farm or the air scrubbers or the water recycler?<eos> No one.<eos> This isn't about saving my people.<eos> It's about saving the human race.<eos> No.<eos> Let them come.<eos> It's time to face the music.<eos> Yes?<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
We thought we were saving the human race.<eos> But now what...<eos> Now we actually are.<eos> Those people outside will kill us if we open that door.<eos> All of us, starting with Clarke.<eos> Are you really willing to let your daughter die?<eos> I am sorry for your loss, Abby.<eos> Marcus was a good man.<eos> He still is.<eos> Abby, I promise you, Octavia won't let anything happen to Clarke, and neither will I.
You're gonna have to make it a kill shot.<eos> It's the only way you're gonna stop me.<eos> Oh, I knew you'd come through.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Octavia, they're here.<eos> Everyone except you.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> You said...<eos> I said your people would live.<eos> I didn't say anything about you.
I know.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Here's the takeaway.<eos> You don't have to be willing to die to really live.<eos> I am.<eos> If this works, you'll wake up, and we'll both be gone.<eos> You're always with me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You did this, Reyes, not me, not her.<eos> It was in you all along.
- No.<eos> Don't take that off.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Don't take that off.<eos> No. This is not making...<eos> No.<eos> You need to let us go.<eos> - Yeah. Like hell I do.<eos> Get off...<eos> - Just go! Get off or I will never forgive you.
Don't live with that.<eos> No.<eos> No, say... say you love me.<eos> Don't do this to me.<eos> Please.<eos> Say you love me or you'll regret it, Monty.<eos> This is unsanitary.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> No!<eos> I'm just trying to help you!
Don't do this to me.<eos> Please.<eos> Say you love me or you'll regret it, Monty.<eos> This is unsanitary.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> No!<eos> I'm just trying to help you!<eos> This isn't a joke.<eos> This is real, you idiot.<eos> Let me help you.
Hey, hey, hey, where's Emori?<eos> I haven't seen her.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Ethan!<eos> Ethan!<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> It's ok.<eos> - Emori!<eos> - John?<eos> Hey, did they hurt you?
We're sending a team to get you today.<eos> You're sure about this?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need you and not just for the hundreds of things we know you can fix, but for the thousands that we haven't even thought of yet.<eos> Thank you, Abby.<eos> I'm just glad you're all right.<eos> You'll be, too.<eos> My brain is healing.<eos> The seizures have stopped.<eos> When I get there, we use the same procedure on you.
On a good day, it takes 10 hours to get to the island and 10 hours to get back.<eos> That doesn't leave you much room for error.<eos> Mom, I know, ok?<eos> We'll be careful.<eos> I love you, Clarke.<eos> Don't ever forget that.<eos> This isn't good-bye.<eos> Mom, I know what you saw in that vision, but I'm a Nightblood now, I mean, right?<eos> Maybe it worked. Clarke, listen to me.<eos> I told you there we no good guys, but that's not true.
It's human nature to fight.<eos> I'll never forget that you did for me.<eos> A word, Octavia?<eos> I fear this will only get worse if Skaikru can't decide.<eos> You know how this has to end.<eos> What if I can't do it?<eos> You gave your terms.<eos> There is no going back.<eos> I know this is hard, but you're the champion, Octavia.<eos> Wonkru looks to you now.
I didn't do this on my own.<eos> No leader ever does.<eos> It felt good to be safe.<eos> I never felt that way before... like I had a home.<eos> Hey, your home is with me, ok?<eos> Why did you come on this mission, Clarke?<eos> Raven's my friend.<eos> Yesterday, you were fine leaving your friend out to die, my sister, too, Kane...<eos> I wasn't fine with it, and you know that.<eos> Bellamy, I never meant to hurt you.
I opened that door.<eos> You did what you thought was right.<eos> Was it right, Marcus?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do what's right, and 364 people die.<eos> You saved so many others.<eos> You saved me, and I don't mean just by opening the door.<eos> I don't know who I am anymore.<eos> The things that I let myself do in that lab...<eos> I told you, we will find our humanity again.
There you go.<eos> - ...is, uh... - [laughter]<eos> God, I just want to eat them up.<eos> I can't believe I'm not there. This is so stupid.<eos> Two of our favorite writers and I'm stuck on a boat.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, the video of our recording has already hit over a million views.<eos> - [laughs] - [laughs] The TV station has never seen anything like it.<eos> So, my boss, Kobi Kihara, was wondering if we could do a follow-up story on you.<eos> - Do you believe in happy endings?
I've lived so long with my head buried, I should be able to breathe sand by now."<eos> I know that line.<eos> It's from The Price of Life is Death.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Puck loves cheesy movies.<eos> Cheesy?<eos> I don't like him either.<eos> You were right.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Hey, guys, we're so glad you could join us on this beautiful day.
Those familiar with the story of those terrible strikes will understand the tragedy of what happened to your father.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My father was killed during one of the riots.<eos> - I'm sorry, Capheus.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Would you say that this tragic incident is what powers your desire for social justice?<eos> To be truthful, the thought has never occurred to me until now.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But surely the desire for justice lives in all of us.<eos> Few of us are willing to risk it just as you did last week.
One of our reporters was in your matatu and captured this extraordinary event.<eos> Can we roll the tape?<eos> - [crowd chanting] Van Damn! Van Damn! - Unbelievable.<eos> This very brave young man diffused an angry incident that threatened to get much worse.<eos> Kibera has been a deprived neighborhood for forever.<eos> Why has this anger reached fever pitch now?<eos> Water.<eos> Think what we all need water for.<eos> We cannot live without water.<eos> What do you pay for a liter of water that is packed to your home, Miss Kobi?
The problem, it seems to me, begins when they don't.<eos> When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get on their bus...<eos> I think this is when leaders become something else.<eos> What?<eos> Politicians.<eos> - It's a beautiful day, Mrs. Rasal.<eos> - It is, Mr. Bhoopalam.<eos> Mrs. Rasal.<eos> Hello.<eos> Who are you?
I'm an actor.<eos> So?<eos> I knew your son, Raoul.<eos> He interviewed me years ago.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know your face.<eos> Raoul found your movies...<eos> Cheesy?<eos> No.<eos> You underestimate yourself.
Raoul was always different.<eos> Even when he was very young.<eos> We were a family of journalists... my wife, Raoul, me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The truth was not a thing to be hidden or denied.<eos> Not under our roof.<eos> But to hunt for truth, you need a sixth sense for it.<eos> Journalistic intuition.<eos> In my 40 years, I never knew anyone with an intuition like my son.<eos> You and Raoul were lovers?
I want to let you know that I'm...<eos> I'm not gay. Okay?<eos> I...<eos> I'm...<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I just think that... as an actor, it is important to be open to all kinds of experiences.<eos> Sure.<eos> [stammers] It was just... [sighs]<eos> - Journalistic intuition?<eos> Well, let's just say... you are my son's type.

[sighs]<eos> - Journalistic intuition?<eos> Well, let's just say... you are my son's type.<eos> Señor Pasquale...<eos> Can I ask about his disappearance?<eos> I know he went to Chicago for a story.<eos> Do you know anything about it?
Since he disappeared, I haven't been able to come in here.<eos> These are his photographs.<eos> [Nomi] That's the cabin.<eos> We need to know where these pictures were taken.<eos> Do you know where these pictures were taken?<eos> Um... somewhere in California.<eos> The woman in the picture was important to the story.<eos> Can you take pictures of all of this stuff and send it to me?<eos> Do you mind if I take pictures?<eos> Do you know her?
Can you take pictures of all of this stuff and send it to me?<eos> Do you mind if I take pictures?<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Her name is Angelica.<eos> When my son was disappeared, the police said he was involved with drugs.<eos> I knew they were lying.<eos> When they came here, they were looking for something.<eos> They did not find it.<eos> You see?<eos> My son believed his secrets would be safe with you.
Heavens.<eos> We just have some questions.<eos> Oh, my, my!<eos> What's all this about?<eos> Actually, one of your neighbors found these prison uniforms<eos> Familiar, are they?<eos> Yeah, of course they are.<eos> They used to be mine.<eos> The uniforms have numbers, Mrs. Cho.<eos> So you can just drop the innocent old lady act.

I know you won't mind showing me your warrant.<eos> One of the escaped convicts was a Min-Jung.<eos> You and she were cellmates, weren't you?<eos> The only thing I hate more than rhetorical questions... stupid rhetorical questions.<eos> Harboring fugitives, Mrs. Cho... that's a serious crime.<eos> I don't want to have to put you back in prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They were here.<eos> But they left last night.<eos> You can search the place if you don't believe me.

One of Angelica's cluster.<eos> This is the origin of their zombie factory.<eos> Means Kolovi knew about it from the beginning.<eos> These are early experiments of the men who I believe are responsible for your son's disappearance.<eos> That one is Professor Kolovi.<eos> I showed him a picture of my son and he denied ever meeting him.<eos> What did your journalistic intuition tell you about him?<eos> He's a lying snake who would open his own mother's throat if he could profit by it.<eos> When was the last time he spoke to Raoul?<eos> When was the last time you spoke to Raoul?
Hello?<eos> Raoul?<eos> Raoul, is it you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.<eos> I hope one day I share that same opinion.<eos> - Do you know where they were headed?
Raoul, is it you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.<eos> I hope one day I share that same opinion.<eos> - Do you know where they were headed?<eos> - No.<eos> Would you tell me if you did know, huh?
Don't move!<eos> Put your hands up!<eos> I said hands up!<eos> Good.<eos> Look... we don't want anybody to get hurt, right?<eos> Stay still.<eos> Stay still.<eos> Good.<eos> Stay still.<eos> Who are you?
- You all right?<eos> - Everybody, calm down!<eos> Come on!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> That was fucking real!<eos> Do you have to do everything so intensely?<eos> No.<eos> Just the things that matter.<eos> These are the last year reports from the controller general.<eos> Yeah, you can just put them there. - Thank you. - You're welcome.
Daddy, look what I made!<eos> Now this line describing the flank, that is sublime.<eos> Come, let Daddy get dressed.<eos> Good morning, Milton.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited.<eos> It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.<eos> How are you feeling?
Love to talk, but my date's arrived.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.

Exactly.<eos> Did we make a mistake doing the concert?<eos> No.<eos> It just proved there's a whole bunch more of us out there than we thought, and that there must be some kind of an intelligence network because they all seemed to know who you were.<eos> We just have to try and figure out a way to get them to trust us.<eos> Aye, that's the rub, laddie.<eos> Mr. Hoy is back.<eos> What a charming little empty box you've chosen here.<eos> All the modern amenities of a prison cell.<eos> Where are you visiting from?

Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.

I'm serious.<eos> I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you.<eos> What?<eos> It's her.<eos> Angelica?<eos> Spring of '52.<eos> A very, very covert conference was convened at the British airbase on Cyprus.<eos> Authorities from NATO, the Warsaw Pact, China, and the Arab League sat locked in a room debating reality.<eos> After weeks of haggling, walk-outs, and bullying, the Biologic Preservation Organization was born.<eos> How do you know all of this?

- Something's wrong.<eos> The research might be helpful.<eos> That's what the Nazis said!<eos> You fucking hide out in Walden while they herd the rest of us into cattle cars.<eos> Do you think they might be right?<eos> I'll go to Iceland.<eos> She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?
She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.<eos> What's his real name?<eos> I don't know myself. Not sure I want to know.<eos> When our kind have nightmares about BPO, they're usually about him.<eos> - Where do I find him?<eos> I do not ken where you get your brass goolies from, but maybe I'll be able to give you what you want.

Well, you get the gist.<eos> Sapiens invented Google in the 1990s.<eos> We've had it since the Neolithic.<eos> How long does it take?<eos> I'm looking for Cannibal.<eos> Get him on the phone now!<eos> I don't know what he thinks he's doing.<eos> This is my research, this is my project.<eos> Tell him I'm gonna straighten him out!<eos> I've got the answer, but I don't think you're going to like it.
Nom!<eos> Dr. Metzger.<eos> I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.<eos> Prep her for surgery.<eos> Nomi, what have you done?<eos> Is he in there?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> I told you, he's trying to destroy my work.<eos> I love you.<eos> You really believe that neurografting is possible?
I know.<eos> You want to run as far from the pain as you can.<eos> Dad!<eos> Come back!<eos> I know, baby. I went so far, I didn't know how to get back.<eos> Terrible news.<eos> How sad to let your father die alone like that.<eos> Just stay the fuck away from me.<eos> Or what?<eos> I know things were difficult between you and your father.

Mr. Bak wants everything to be perfect.<eos> You are the face of his hospitality.

Van Damn!<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, my son.<eos> If your father could see you now.<eos> He would be so proud.<eos> We should go.<eos> He's right. If we're late, they'll think we're afraid, no?<eos> Van Damn! Van Damn!<eos> - We can avoid the traffic on Nyong by...<eos> - Leave it to us. You're not a bus driver anymore.
Your friends at the KDRP may know something about politics, but I know Nairobi.<eos> The true measure of a candidate's viability in this city is not measured by polls or numbers.<eos> You know that someone is a serious contender by the size of the bounty.<eos> There's a bounty on my head?<eos> There's a bounty on anyone who runs against Mandiba.<eos> How serious is it?<eos> I would say now the price is somewhere between a beating and a kidnapping.<eos> But let's see what happens after your rally.<eos> This will tell us how dangerous they think you are.<eos> Are you telling me you think I should withdraw?
Are you telling me you think I should withdraw?<eos> Withdraw now and you will have done the exact opposite of what you set out to do.<eos> Instead of undermining Mandiba's hold over this city and his control of Kibera, your withdrawal will serve to make him invincible.<eos> Then I can't withdraw. No.<eos> And I can't claim to be like everyone else if I have armed guards following me everywhere I go.<eos> You are right to understand that politics requires courage.<eos> But if you're asking for advice, I would suggest you stop driving a bus where every day, you arrive at the same appointed time.<eos> Will you answer a question honestly?<eos> As honestly as I can.<eos> Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?
- Me, too.<eos> You came here today before us as two.<eos> You will leave as one.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> Teagan Marks, do you take this man to be your husband, to love and to cherish, to have and...<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I'm really sorry about this.<eos> I wish I didn't have to do this, but I don't have a choice.<eos> Special Agent Bendix, FBI.<eos> - I'm going to ask all of you...
Excuse me!<eos> I'm really sorry about this.<eos> I wish I didn't have to do this, but I don't have a choice.<eos> Special Agent Bendix, FBI.<eos> - I'm going to ask all of you...<eos> - You motherfucker.<eos> To remain in your seats until we have secured the individual in question.<eos> - Now hold on a second...<eos> - FBI.<eos> What right do you have to come into my church?
What the hell, Bug?<eos> You said it worked.<eos> It did work.<eos> You saw it worked.<eos> I knew this. I knew this was going to happen.<eos> Mom, Dad, do something.<eos> It's your own fault.<eos> I told you not to include him.<eos> No. I won't let you.<eos> If you want to finish your sacred rite, get out of the way.
- Oh, yeah. Go ahead, obstruct.<eos> Get ready to arrest Miss Caplan, too.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Amanita, it's okay. It's okay.<eos> It's not. This isn't your fault. It's this moron!<eos> He's had his head so far up his ass, he didn't bother to check.<eos> Check what?<eos> Good citizens of San Francisco's upper tax bracket, this man, Agent Jeffrey Bendix, has stormed into the middle of this sacred ceremony, violating this important moment for absolutely no other reason than the gratification of his male ego!<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I urge you to contact your congressperson...
Prove it!<eos> Show us the warrant, Agent Bendix.<eos> I have the arrest warrant right here.<eos> He doesn't have a warrant.<eos> Of course I have one.<eos> Dad?<eos> - Agent Bendix...<eos> - Nomi Marks is wanted by at least three different agencies in the federal system.<eos> I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow, Wise, Allegretti Marks?<eos> I sincerely hope that you're going to show me the warrant.

You think you're gonna just call up and get me a meeting with Kit Wrangler?<eos> Who is Kit Wrangler?<eos> Academy Award-winning producer.<eos> Yes, of course Mr. Wrangler's in a meeting.<eos> I mean, "Daniela who?<eos> What, Mexico?<eos> Where?"<eos> The thing is... to whom am I speaking, by the way?<eos> Jean-Baptiste.<eos> Look, Jean-Baptiste, I need you to indulge this Mexican madwoman for two minutes.
Yes, of course Mr. Wrangler's in a meeting.<eos> I mean, "Daniela who?<eos> What, Mexico?<eos> Where?"<eos> The thing is... to whom am I speaking, by the way?<eos> Jean-Baptiste.<eos> Look, Jean-Baptiste, I need you to indulge this Mexican madwoman for two minutes.<eos> Just two minutes, because every career, every successful Hollywood story can be reduced to a single moment, to one break where someone recognized an opportunity that no one else did.<eos> These next two minutes, Jean-Baptiste, could be the difference between where you are right now and the first associate producer credit of your career.<eos> I want you to go online, click YouTube, type in "Lito Rodriguez, São Paulo Pride."

Ladies of the Canyon.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, it's so not Iberian Dreams.<eos> But Peter's genius is sensing when an actor's having a moment.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> He's not gonna do it for less than two million.<eos> Oh, really? We'll see what you think after Ellen.<eos> That's right. She loves an LGBT story.<eos> Call me back.<eos> Oh, my God, you heard that?
That's Peter again.<eos> I have to call you back.<eos> I know.<eos> Lito loves Iberian Dreams, but the Ladies offer is real.<eos> It's killing me.<eos> It's heartbreaking, but it's timing, and this business, it's all about timing.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> I'll wait...<eos> if you think you can do something.

That's really weird synchronicity.<eos> But, hey, timing is everything, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, sure. Put him on.<eos> Hello, Kit.<eos> I know.<eos> I felt it, too.<eos> I believe in this project.<eos> I believe it was destiny.<eos> I can't wait for you to meet him.

If I can be frank, Mrs. Rasal...<eos> I met Raj quite a bit after your wedding, and it never occurred to me, not once.<eos> But the moment I saw your reaction to the fact that I hadn't been to your wedding, I realized the scale of my mistake.<eos> This is what they mean I think by... the "civilizing nature of women."<eos> - I mean, everyone makes mistakes.<eos> But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.<eos> No, but I did.<eos> And my karma has rewarded me with another opportunity to talk to you.<eos> You believe in karma, Mrs. Rasal?
That's not enough.<eos> - Well, Kala believes she can make them.<eos> - We won't have time to test them.<eos> - Are you talking to Will?<eos> I got some pretty bad news.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> It's his dad.<eos> He's dying.<eos> Who are you?
What happened?<eos> Shock brought on by septicemia.<eos> We think he fell.<eos> Hurt himself.<eos> I found him on the floor.<eos> On the floor?<eos> - How long?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> But he's a fighter.<eos> Who are you?
Hurt himself.<eos> I found him on the floor.<eos> On the floor?<eos> - How long?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> But he's a fighter.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - It's me...<eos> - Dad.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
I've been meaning to talk with you.<eos> It's terrifying, isn't it?<eos> The president and I have a simple request.<eos> Tell us what you see.

And I also do not care about your investigative committees.<eos> No, that is not what I care about today.<eos> The House will cease.<eos> That is not what I care about today.<eos> I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.<eos> A good man, a husband... a father... who was beheaded on American soil.<eos> And this chamber chooses to debate me?<eos> - The House will suspend. - I asked to speak to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.<eos> - Madam Speaker!<eos> - Mr. President, you must yield the floor.

At large.<eos> How much more proof do you people need?
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.<eos> I demand that this Congress declare a formal declaration of war against ICO, both here and abroad.<eos> Motion to adjourn.<eos> - Second!<eos> - The House will adjourn. - The president will cease.<eos> - I will not cease!<eos> I will never cease.<eos> I demand that this Congress declare a state of war has existed and does exist between ICO and the United States of America.<eos> And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.<eos> Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
I pointed that out, sir, but... the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.<eos> All right.<eos> Mrs. Miller.<eos> - I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you, I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.<eos> The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If you don't mind...
Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need to...<eos> I wanted to say about my father...<eos> He was so strong... so brave.<eos> My father was taking us to...<eos> My father...<eos> - Come on, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - My father... You killed my father.

Yes, sir.<eos> - Quite a crowd out there.<eos> - Well, we better bring Birch in first. Yes, sir.<eos> Congressman Birch.<eos> Bob.<eos> Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?<eos> - It certainly was.<eos> - I couldn't see it any other way.<eos> No disagreement from here.<eos> Well, you know how the Republicans are.
The declaration caught him off guard.<eos> Had to keep him out of it.<eos> It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.<eos> Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.<eos> - Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> - A stunt.<eos> Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.<eos> - Charlie, if I may...<eos> Tom, please, what are you implying?
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> - A stunt.<eos> Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.<eos> - Charlie, if I may...<eos> Tom, please, what are you implying?<eos> This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.<eos> And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.<eos> I'm not denying what happened to the Millers. It was a tragedy.<eos> No, but you are.
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.<eos> And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.<eos> I'm not denying what happened to the Millers. It was a tragedy.<eos> No, but you are.<eos> Because denying it is the tragedy.<eos> This is a pattern.<eos> Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,<eos> - continues to operate in the shadows.<eos> - Tom...<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article.
But that's all we have.<eos> Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.<eos> I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.<eos> Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed...<eos> Tom.<eos> Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.<eos> Cleared?<eos> Please.<eos> The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.<eos> You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.<eos> They can call it what they want.<eos> Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air... It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.<eos> Or call it for what it is.<eos> "Home and abroad."<eos> The president is essentially asking for permission - to fight a war on our soil.<eos> - We can't push back too hard.<eos> We can't afford to look soft on terror.<eos> We can't look the other way, either.<eos> You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.

We all, I know, reject the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.<eos> What I mean is, this is a time for reflection, not aggression...<eos> So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.<eos> Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.<eos> The post has been shared over 100,000 times.<eos> I want to talk with her.<eos> - Hannah?<eos> - The mother.<eos> We've been very careful about where you appear.<eos> - LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
Where?<eos> When you got shot.<eos> I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.<eos> You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.<eos> And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?<eos> Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Do you have a smoke?
- If you can get into the NSA...<eos> - That's not possible.<eos> Into their system, you can fix this.<eos> - You're not listening to me.<eos> - I am.<eos> I know the Underwoods.<eos> The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.<eos> You can help them win.<eos> I know you can.<eos> I got on the paper right around the time you left.

The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.<eos> How do we justify?<eos> The White House counsel's been all through that. It's there in black and white.<eos> We're virtually closing down our borders<eos> - without any hard evidence to back it up.<eos> - It's coming.<eos> A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.<eos> They could be hurt by this.<eos> A change in policy this big, I want it done right.<eos> I want you to let the world know that if they want to continue coming to this country for our hospitals, our colleges, our golf courses and God knows what else... they're going to have to deliver more than my head on the end of a burning stick.

I have reached out.<eos> Then I need you to reach further.<eos> I want actionable intelligence.<eos> I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least, that everyone's out there looking.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> We're clear.<eos> Thank you, Cathy.<eos> I know you won't let me down.<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Is that why you're here?
Calm down.<eos> He's not a monster like they all say.<eos> - I lost him somewhere. - But he's not...<eos> But still, monsters do exist, don't they?<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.<eos> I don't know why I say anything anymore.<eos> I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.<eos> Didn't you know what was going on in your home?

- Would you like to see it?<eos> We can show it to you, if you like.<eos> No. Please don't.<eos> What he did to that family, to that man...<eos> What sort of person would do such a thing?<eos> He's my son.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I know. It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.

Who did the Speaker put on the committee?<eos> Mostly lifers, with secure seats.<eos> We're two weeks out.<eos> It's hard to say no to war.<eos> You and I have some things in common.

We cannot confirm at this time, but we believe this is connected to the manhunt for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.<eos> The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.<eos> The FBI is still not commenting, but if you look at this aerial view, you can see heavily-armed men making their way through this wooded area.<eos> Sir, he's not here.<eos> All we have are some loose domestic connections. A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.<eos> He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.<eos> Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.<eos> And risk to reward no longer tenable.<eos> Sir, we have reached a breaking point.<eos> Did you think I didn't already have him?

She looked right through you, didn't she?<eos> I don't need to see this person anymore.<eos> - Get rid of the asset.<eos> - Sir.<eos> He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.<eos> We are at war.<eos> And he is an enemy combatant.<eos> And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.<eos> So don't give me your pride or your position.<eos> Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.

I'll take care of it.<eos> Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.<eos> And I want you to get some good, usable footage... of his killing.<eos> And then destroy everything else.<eos> We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.<eos> The administration and the intelligence community were hoping to take him alive.<eos> But I would like to commend Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green. And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.<eos> The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.<eos> And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.<eos> You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?<eos> The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.<eos> They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.<eos> That's right.<eos> They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - That's right, Doug.<eos> "Fuck."<eos> It's difficult to underst...<eos> Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
- That's right, Doug.<eos> "Fuck."<eos> It's difficult to underst...<eos> Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.<eos> The president called Mrs. Miller.<eos> I promised you and your daughter that I would...<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.

And do not use my husband's name. Listen, Mrs....<eos> She hung up.<eos> Let's go for a walk.<eos> Mr. President!<eos> Tell them what they need to know.<eos> Mr. President!<eos> Hello.<eos> Mr. President. Thank you, thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> You have nothing to be afraid of.

Do you know why I pulled you over tonight?
All I remember of Warsaw is people standing in line.<eos> Ah, Mr. Mukherjee.<eos> Nice of you to find the time to return to our tables.<eos> You see, Wali, this country is not yet lost to the Kardashians.<eos> There are still some here who know how to show some respect.<eos> This way.<eos> Where's my main man Eddie?<eos> Family emergency, I'm afraid.<eos> Sorry to hear.<eos> - Hope you'll give him my best.
Sorry to hear.<eos> - Hope you'll give him my best.<eos> - Of course I will.<eos> We'll get you sorted out with chips. And of course...<eos> Pappy Van Winkle.<eos> A lovely gesture... but I'm afraid my trainer has made me promise to abstain.<eos> You see, if I let myself get fat, then the girls will only want me for my money.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to your game then, huh?<eos> For the whiskey.<eos> Don't tell me your margins are such that you can afford to buy liquor that never gets drunk.
Bullshit.<eos> I'm all in.<eos> That is $19,000.<eos> Sir?<eos> Call.<eos> It's a straight, ten high.<eos> Trip sevens.<eos> Straight takes it.<eos> First lesson of poker:<eos> Unless it's a bluff, never make a bet that can only be called by hands that beat you.

What if you stayed in here forever?<eos> What if... you... never left this room?<eos> Get the fuck outta here.<eos> Some fuckhead busts your headlight don't mean you get to bust his face.<eos> Good news is the guy's an old scumbag.<eos> Thing is, we don't know yet what kind of cell phone video we might be dealing with.<eos> So I want you to listen to your good friend, Bo.<eos> You sustained multiple blows to the head during the altercation. Okay?<eos> Your PBA rep advises you not to make any statements till we can confirm your cognitive functions were operating normally.<eos> I understand you suffered a blow to the head as well.
- That's actually not bad. - Thank you.<eos> But when he runs the name Marius Josepovich through the database...<eos> Yeah, you're right. You're fucked.<eos> [sighs]<eos> But that's not your problem. Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.<eos> He didn't lose the eye.<eos> They are gonna get to me sooner or later, okay?<eos> Now, you know, no matter how pissed off I am at you, and I fucking am, that I would never wanna see you get hurt...<eos> Katie, no.<eos> If they show up, you tell them everything you know about how to find me, you understand?
Because I'm gonna switch it out. Look.<eos> He won't notice the difference?<eos> He's gonna be too distracted. - By? By the woman having a seizure on the floor.<eos> Shit!<eos> This was always your bread and butter, all right?<eos> Frank Winslow, Manhattan North,<eos> Narcotics and Vice Enforcement.<eos> How exactly can I help you?<eos> Marius Josepovich?<eos> You're gonna have to be more specific than that.
- Oh, don't worry, he's not a suspect.<eos> He's just a former known associate of some of the key people.<eos> Detective, if one of my parolees is connected to a crime,<eos> - procedure dictates...<eos> - No, no, no. I wouldn't say he's connected to it.<eos> Then what would you say?<eos> I think you and I got off on the wrong foot here.<eos> I am gonna go ahead and call my own number on that one.<eos> I got sent to a department mandated shrink for a while, said I broadcast hostility.<eos> I hear you were a Marine.
I am gonna go ahead and call my own number on that one.<eos> I got sent to a department mandated shrink for a while, said I broadcast hostility.<eos> I hear you were a Marine.<eos> Nope.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Oh, yeah. No such thing as a former Marine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Seems like half the guys in my squad are jarheads.<eos> They join up as soon as they left active duty.<eos> You ever consider going that route?
Even did a full semester towards an associate degree in criminal justice at Duchess Community.<eos> Turns out social work was more my speed.<eos> The important thing is we're on the same side. Oh, yeah?<eos> And what side is that?<eos> Law enforcement?<eos> No, that's where I'm gonna have to disagree with you.<eos> How's that?<eos> I know not here to enforce, brother.<eos> I'm here to empower.<eos> You are gonna empower these shit-stain ex-cons to do what exactly?

If you want somebody... You take me.<eos> Nana, are you down here?<eos> No!<eos> Nana?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nana, I can't get the door open. It's shut!<eos> Nana?<eos> No!<eos> Trust me, you've made the right decision.

- Not even her family?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Well, ever since the horrible incident with their daughter in the basement, which would never ever happen again, by the way, they want to have nothing to do with it, so they... they...<eos> Decided to put the house up for sale once the state allowed them to do so and told my agents to get rid out it.<eos> - Seems odd.<eos> - No, no!<eos> It's not uncommon when people face this kind of family tragedy. But only because of bad memories and stuff.<eos> Which is why we're playing it safe. We're placing a furnace.<eos> You are very smart.
I'm gonna check it out.<eos> Really?<eos> I refuse to be intimidated by my own house.<eos> It's cold down here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Just me.<eos> Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Name's Oscar.<eos> I'm the electrician.<eos> You called us about replacing your furnace.

I didn't think you were coming until tomorrow.<eos> I had some down time, so I thought I'd check it out today.<eos> - That real estate lady...<eos> - Yeah, she let me in.<eos> Yeah, I didn't see your truck out front. Sorry.<eos> This is my wife, Jennifer.<eos> I'm Paul.<eos> I'd shake, but it's kinda dirty down here.<eos> Got it.<eos> So, listen, you don't seem to have any problem with your heating.
Built to last.<eos> Apparently, there was a fire here a couple of years ago and a girl got burnt pretty badly.<eos> I wouldn't go sticking your face in there.<eos> These suckers get pretty hot.<eos> Damn hot.<eos> Yeah, well, if we were to replace this one, how much would it cost?<eos> Well, I'll let you know when I'm done with my assessment.<eos> Just trying to figure out where all these pipes lead.<eos> Lot of pipe down here.<eos> Okay, we'll leave you to it, and you'll let us know when you have an estimate?

Okay, fuck this shit.<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Get me the fuck out of here!<eos> Open the goddamn door.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Too many weird fucking fumes in these cellars. It's playing with my head.<eos> Help me, dear god!<eos> Hey, you almost done?
I am all over that.<eos> We haven't been out in quite a while.<eos> Okay, you wanna go upstairs and change, and we'll take my car?<eos> Yes, I will go change.<eos> Uh, okay, he's acting fucking weird.<eos> He's trying to be on best behavior.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> We're changing our plans for you. Don't forget that.<eos> Without a reservation, it's gonna be a few minutes.<eos> You may wait at the bar, if you wish.
Without a reservation, it's gonna be a few minutes.<eos> You may wait at the bar, if you wish.<eos> Bar sounds good. I could use a drink.<eos> Karen, you? - Always.<eos> - I don't like to wait.<eos> We came to have a good time, right?<eos> Good times...<eos> Jennifer. I'm ready to have some fun.<eos> Hi.<eos> - What would you like to drink?
Jennifer. I'm ready to have some fun.<eos> Hi.<eos> - What would you like to drink?<eos> - I'll take a red wine, please.<eos> - A Cuba libre.<eos> - Red wine, Cuba libre.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Tell me about this guy you're seeing.<eos> What's he like, what's his name?<eos> Oh, excuse me, do you work here?
His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.<eos> Oh, I don't want someone else.<eos> I just want you.<eos> What the hell is your husband doing?<eos> He's probably just trying to get us a table earlier.<eos> - Cabernet.<eos> - Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.<eos> Can I let you in on a little secret?<eos> You couldn't have me if hell froze over.
- Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.<eos> Can I let you in on a little secret?<eos> You couldn't have me if hell froze over.<eos> What if I told you...<eos> To the keeper that Paul is.<eos> I could provide you with the most explosive sexual experience of your entire life.<eos> Four words.<eos> "Never going to happen."<eos> Never say never.<eos> Excuse me sir, can I help you with something from the bar?

Could you make sure they don't burn?<eos> I'm gonna run upstairs.<eos> I think I need a shower.<eos> Now that Karen's gone, nothing's gonna come between us.<eos> Karen?<eos> No, ma'am. I'm Leo, with flow plumbers.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I received a call the other day.<eos> Of course, yes. My husband called you.<eos> Come on in. Thank you.
Just call me when you get this, okay?<eos> I should restock these.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Oh, shit. I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. It was my fault.<eos> - Don't worry about that. I'll recover.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. It was my fault.<eos> - Don't worry about that. I'll recover.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.<eos> But I think I can help you.<eos> You're living in the house, aren't you?
- I'm sorry.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. It was my fault.<eos> - Don't worry about that. I'll recover.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.<eos> But I think I can help you.<eos> You're living in the house, aren't you?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?

No.<eos> But I think I can help you.<eos> You're living in the house, aren't you?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> The only survivor.<eos> The accident with the furnace. You're the girl.

The accident with the furnace. You're the girl.<eos> It was no accident.<eos> There's something evil living in that house.<eos> Have you been in the cellar?<eos> Have you seen the black room?<eos> Leave!<eos> Take your husband and get out!<eos> It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more.<eos> It feeds off human desires.<eos> But, if you're not careful, it will literally eat you alive.

Did not disappear, like they say.<eos> She was swallowed up by that house.<eos> She died saving my life...<eos> Trying to trap the evil that was summoned decades earlier.<eos> Get out, before it takes you, too! Body and soul.
You think we can get our old apartment back?<eos> So, I know it's been a while, but I'm still feeling the effects of that house.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Well, maybe tonight we can do something about it, now that everything's back to normal.<eos> I meant to tell you, we may have a problem.<eos> Not everything's back to normal.<eos> It did that to you?<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> Let's make a baby.<eos> Trust me, you've made the right decision.

That's why I'm having this conversation with you and not the AD.<eos> - Bowman. - Yeah.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> Overnight, seven VIPs went missing in the LA area.<eos> The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, chief engineers at Lockheed and Boeing, an official with the Defense Nuclear Agency, and three senior military officers.<eos> Now, it appears that at least three of them were extracted by a militarized entity whose origin, at the present, is unclear.<eos> The others... well, the others are unaccounted for.<eos> Your department heads have your individual assignments.<eos> The goal is to bring these people back home safe.<eos> Can you share any theories as to what this is about, sir?
Some kind of coordinated terrorist attack, maybe.<eos> Turn here.<eos> I'm doing you a favor, you know.<eos> I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.<eos> I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted".<eos> Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard.<eos> FBI.<eos> Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything.<eos> We're here to help you.<eos> If you're FBI, I want to see IDs.

They must have jammed my 3G radio.<eos> I couldn't get a call out.<eos> What kind of engineer needs a panic room?<eos> Good question.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?<eos> There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.<eos> If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.<eos> They're asking you to make a choice, Alan.<eos> It's just the first of many that you'll have to make in your new position.

- Because I'm your father, and I love you.<eos> Uh, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> The Hosts are only able to sequester a tiny percentage of the population.<eos> What the hell are you talking about, Alan?<eos> Okay, so look, I can only bring one person.<eos> Please, Cynthia, just do this for me, okay?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Stop it, stop it.<eos> Who are these people? What're you-- excuse me?<eos> - What're you doing here?

Hang tight.<eos> We need to get outta here.<eos> Now?<eos> Tell me your survival instinct isn't screaming right now.<eos> - Whatever's going on out there, a couple of feds aren't going to make a difference.<eos> I can't just walk out of here.<eos> Who's walking out on who?<eos> See you around... partner.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> I hope you have good news.
Tim Lawes.<eos> The Lockheed engineer. - Okay.<eos> - Sir, do we have any idea--<eos> What the hell?<eos> Shit.<eos> Hold on, sweetheart.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, you okay?
It's gonna be all right.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe.<eos> - Alan Snyder? - Uh, yes.<eos> One of our Proxies.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I'm Helena Goldwyn, the Governor-General's chief-of-staff.<eos> - Nice to meet you. - Yes.<eos> I know that this is a lot to process, but you just have to tell yourself that what's happening was inevitable.

Yeah.<eos> Right?<eos> Jesus. Fuck.<eos> Jesus fuck!<eos> That was definitely a gunshot.<eos> Where are we gonna go?<eos> I don't know. Maybe the dorms?<eos> Hide under the covers until it's over.<eos> 'Cause prison blankets are so bulletproof.<eos> You went off book.

There's shit to do, shit that might need a gun to do.<eos> The Nazi chicks, they might need backup while they're rounding up the guards.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Don't matter if you're tired.<eos> Whoa, I said I'm tired.<eos> I'm gonna rest for a bit, and then I'll go get shit done, or whatever.<eos> Sounds good to you?<eos> Best plan ever.<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> You know, you could probably leave your boxes packed.

I have sensitive cochlea.<eos> I'm dying in here.<eos> But the only way is with a key, and only Caputo and Piscatella have keys.<eos> No, that can't be the only way.<eos> Can't we, you know, cut some wires or something?<eos> We?<eos> Piss off, Bloody Mary.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> I'm making earplugs out of pencil erasers.<eos> You know, Flores is outside with a shiv, and I'm closer to the door than you are.

No, a nickname can't be with "bad" and "ass" in it.<eos> - How about Sexy Ass? - Uh...<eos> But then no one's gonna know how hard she is, yo.<eos> - Cold Ass Diaz?<eos> - Get off the ass track.<eos> How about Dominator?<eos> The Dominator.<eos> Too kinky.<eos> You know, you can't keep shooting things down without pitching.<eos> Now, you gonna read the words just like they written.

- How long has he been unconscious?<eos> - He's been in and out.<eos> - And he's lost a lot of blood.<eos> - Thanks for bringing him in.<eos> If you got this, I'm gonna go check on Daya, okay?<eos> You're gonna need some help.<eos> I was a firema... firefighter.<eos> Well, great.<eos> I'll take all the help I can get.<eos> Okay, you need to lose the shoes.

Six pack abs?<eos> Ooh, I wanna see those.<eos> All right, so... how do I post it?<eos> Man, where do I post it?<eos> I got an old Myspace account.<eos> Still might work.<eos> Snapchat.<eos> I hear it's all about Snapchat now.<eos> What?<eos> Why'd you make that snort noise?

- Why are you helping them?<eos> Because their message still exonerates MCC, so what the hell do I care?<eos> Bad apple guard.<eos> Sympathetic victim.<eos> Justice will be served.<eos> That's what I've been trying to convey since the beginning.<eos> He was a kid who was under-trained, in over his head, who made a grave and terrible mistake.<eos> See, that's not good for MCC.<eos> He was a kid who killed my friend.<eos> My friend, who was a person, and you didn't say her name or nothing about her.

How long do you think this riot of yours can last?<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> For what to happen, exactly?<eos> - I don't know, for Bayley to get arrested. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - For the guards to get fired. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - For the food to get better. - Mmm.<eos> For classes and better jobs, and maybe, like, basic dignity. Mmm-hmm.<eos> We should write this shit down.<eos> Not good for MCC.<eos> Barring the arrest... I hope you get everything you want.
CO Bayley murdered her.<eos> And we want justice.<eos> "Her name was Poussey Washington.<eos> She was kind and loyal..."<eos> - "...smart..."<eos> - I knew it.<eos> - "...and our best librarian." - I knew it.<eos> Oh, my God. Will you stop following us?<eos> We tried.<eos> You're on your own.
Less oxygen...<eos> More carbon dioxide.<eos> And then, when Sho's ready, a growth medium.<eos> In this case, glucose.<eos> Come on, dance.<eos> Did it just move?<eos> Hugh?<eos> My God.<eos> It worked.<eos> You woke it.
And, Allen, what is your question for Commander Golovkina?<eos> Is it green?<eos> It isn't visible at all, actually.<eos> It's microscopic.<eos> A single cell.<eos> To put it into perspective, your body is made up of trillions.<eos> There's an alien inside of me?<eos> I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so.<eos> Well, we have another question from 8-year-old Mari.<eos> Are you bringing the alien back to Earth?
I wish I had a time machine, so I could visit the 10-year-old me.<eos> Did he want to be an astronaut?<eos> He wanted out of the wheelchair.<eos> And how does he feel now?<eos> Like a bird.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I don't hate my chair.<eos> I love it.<eos> For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it.<eos> You're one of a kind, Hugh.
Calvin was growing very fast, and this has now given me time to reinforce firewall precautions with the crew.<eos> The box must stay sealed, the lab must stay sealed, no matter the risk to Calvin.<eos> It's just floating.<eos> Because of my mistake in the lab.<eos> And it was going so well.<eos> What?<eos> Something my dad used to say.<eos> "It was all going so well."<eos> I'm toying with the idea of stimulating it electrically.<eos> - What do you think?
I don't know.<eos> My job is lines of defense.<eos> Imagine the worst thing that could ever happen, and then the worst after that, and the worst after that, and then I...<eos> - I've planned for all of them.<eos> - I understand that.<eos> But risks are taken for reasons.<eos> Because of Calvin, we're gonna learn so much about life.<eos> Its origin, its nature, maybe even its meaning.<eos> - No, I know.<eos> - You're a doctor.
Its origin, its nature, maybe even its meaning.<eos> - No, I know.<eos> - You're a doctor.<eos> Stem cell research.<eos> What if Calvin could make stem cells obsolete?<eos> Help cure the incurable...<eos> Reverse the irreversible.<eos> I have to fix this.<eos> Good.<eos> Are you ready?
Tell him to relax.<eos> - Derry? Derry, look at me.<eos> - Tell him to calm down.<eos> Look at me. Relax.<eos> Just relax your hand.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's in between my fingers.<eos> Can I make a suggestion?<eos> Can I just... Can I go in there and get him and...<eos> No, you're not going to go in there.
Just relax your hand.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's in between my fingers.<eos> Can I make a suggestion?<eos> Can I just... Can I go in there and get him and...<eos> No, you're not going to go in there.<eos> No, of course you're not, because we have to maintain quarantine.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - No, I can do this. I can. I can do this.<eos> - Can you try and distract it?
There's a man dying in there!<eos> We can't hear you if you take your comm out!<eos> No!<eos> No, you are not going in!<eos> - Help him!<eos> - Open the door!<eos> Don't open the door, okay? Don't open the door!<eos> Stay back!<eos> I need to see your face.<eos> Can you turn around?

Kat. We lost them.<eos> - How much of that went out?<eos> - Some.<eos> I think.<eos> There is no way to be sure.<eos> Looks like communications just failed.<eos> Can we talk to each other?<eos> David.<eos> It's Kat.<eos> Do you copy?
They're independent systems.<eos> Can we run a diagnostic from here?<eos> The transmitter has failed.<eos> But we have to go outside to access it and get Earth back online.<eos> Then I have to walk.<eos> Let me.<eos> No.<eos> After Rory, I'm best qualified for walk-and-repair.<eos> This is not protocol.<eos> It's way too risky for you to go out there and fix the comms.

It was stipulated. In writing.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What was stipulated in writing?<eos> What was stipulated?<eos> David, first things first.<eos> When we're back in touch with Control, we'll turn our attention to Calvin.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Rate, 61 beats a minute.<eos> Pressure, 97 over 53.<eos> I'd hate to see you relaxed.
Is it possible Calvin could have gotten into coolant?<eos> Possible.<eos> We have to know.<eos> - There is the issue.<eos> - Commander?<eos> It's bone-dry.<eos> Calvin is a carbon-based organism.<eos> It needs food, water, and oxygen, just like us.<eos> We have to consider the possibility it consumed the coolant for food.<eos> David, could you list all the water sources aboard?
The whole thing is absolutely gone.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I guess the expensive doesn't like Virginia.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> This is a problem.<eos> You'll have to fix that wheel.<eos> We're gonna have to find it first.<eos> Them potholes are real bad on tires.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> Mister, is this what you're looking for?

Thank you, lady.<eos> How are we doing, fellas?<eos> We're all done.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> So which way to Fredericksburg?<eos> About 15 miles on that road. Can't miss it.<eos> Great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you, ma'am.<eos> You're, uh, you're gonna let her drive?
No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I just...<eos> I got drunk.<eos> And I lost myself.<eos> I wish we hadn't thrown out that gin.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good evening.<eos> We'd like a room.<eos> Where are you folks from?
We're on our way to Montgomery.<eos> Oh, I like your bulldog, Mister.<eos> We're sold out tonight.<eos> Sold out?<eos> But there's clearly no one here.<eos> No vacancy.<eos> There aren't any motorcars parked outside.<eos> We got a dress code here, and she's breaking it.<eos> He doesn't like my knickerbockers.<eos> Pity a nice girl like you should be let to wear them kind of clothes.

No.<eos> I am tired and hungry, you would like to take a bath, and we would like to get a room.<eos> Not my problem.<eos> I ain't renting a room to some Yankee bed bunny.<eos> Now, I... You calling my wife a...
Everything looks the same, feels the same, even smells the same.<eos> You realize what's changed... is you.<eos> Zelda, are you back for the ball?<eos> Oh, uh, I don't know.<eos> We just needed a place to stay.<eos> Actually, uh, I need to freshen up.<eos> Can you tell Scott I'll be right back?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you sick, honey?
- That I know of, no.<eos> - But you do need some kind of help.<eos> - Uh, it's just where I come from there's a legend about a witch with a cottage made of candy.<eos> - Well, the cottage is mostly wood, and I'm more of a healer and...<eos> Gardening enthusiast.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I need your help. - And you're offering...?<eos> - Offering?<eos> Um... - Gold... Is always good.<eos> - You would be helping the next high king of Fillory.
- On the contrary, we've verified what attracts Reynard. - What?<eos> - Witches doing rituals?<eos> I mean, that's thousands of people every day.<eos> - Not this type of ritual.<eos> Come on.<eos> - So, what do I do?<eos> - Well, per the books, you strip and jump in, I guess.<eos> Here, I'll help you.<eos> - You'll need to help him sew those back on his wrists.<eos> - Who are you?
- This guy is fucking weird.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Go, go.<eos> You know, you're very beautiful.<eos> Where are you from, hmm?<eos> Earth?<eos> Love women from earth.<eos> - Is it supposed to take this long? - No.<eos> - He may have drowned.<eos> - Are you kidding? - Why didn't you...
Love women from earth.<eos> - Is it supposed to take this long? - No.<eos> - He may have drowned.<eos> - Are you kidding? - Why didn't you...<eos> - oh, oh, oh.<eos> - There we go.<eos> Are you sure I can't interest you in an elixir?<eos> It... it's small batch and very fresh. - No, thank you.<eos> - I have a tooth powder that I think you are going to love.<eos> - You know what?
- As you wish.<eos> Pleasure to serve.<eos> - I think he wants a tip. - 20 gold pieces is customary.<eos> - Okay, that sounds like a lot.<eos> - Well, this is Chatwin's torrent. - We don't have...<eos> - There was nothing about charging in the books.<eos> - Oh, uh, you'd rather pay in labor?<eos> I think three to five years.<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You said none of this before I went in the river. - Because I have manners...
- Hmm, like notes on cake, but no actual recipes.<eos> That's helpful.<eos> Who wrote it?<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - What? - I know where we need to go.<eos> - Brakebills?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mr., uh, Mr...<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Can I help you? - Hell, yes, you can.
- What? - I know where we need to go.<eos> - Brakebills?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mr., uh, Mr...<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Can I help you? - Hell, yes, you can.<eos> - These don't work.<eos> - Well, by all means, request a refund.<eos> - Very funny.<eos> - You did this on purpose.

I'm sorry, not possible.<eos> We are full.<eos> We don't have room.<eos> Uh, well, you can tell that was negative.<eos> Um, hold on.<eos> One more idea.<eos> Allora. I have a reservation for one... Dev.<eos> Si. Can we sit together?<eos> It's not a problem for me if it's not a problem for you.<eos> But do you even know this woman?

Mamma mia.<eos> Your Italian is disgusting!<eos> Be quiet.<eos> I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?<eos> We'll never find it!<eos> You idiot!<eos> How did you let your telephone get stolen?<eos> Listen, do you want to buy something or not?
Are we gonna look for the phone?<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> What did I tell you? My son isn't a thief.<eos> We saw him.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We can't find the phone.<eos> He's not going to admit it.<eos> Every one of his neighbors will just say he was somewhere else.<eos> Do you really want to push the issue against this guy, huh?
More deceased here.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I have a visual on the tower.<eos> Before executing the objectives, I need to verify if this is really the echo.<eos> Shit!<eos> Sorry, buddy.<eos> - Will?<eos> - Abby? - Oh, my God, Will!<eos> - What... what happened?<eos> We thought you were dead.

The box was destroyed.<eos> - We moved to a camp on the outside...<eos> - Wait. Back up. What'd you say about the box?
We have developed a clean and simple way of converting mass into pure energy.<eos> In just a few more months, we will launch our energy tower powering our world for millennia to come.<eos> Alterplex Energy.<eos> Simple.<eos> Safe.<eos> Countdown the future...<eos> Mr. Porter.<eos> Abigail Vos, chief of Alterplex Operations. Welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I believe you're familiar with my partner.

Welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I believe you're familiar with my partner.<eos> Dr. Klintsen.<eos> This is a great honor, sir.<eos> You know, I was researching at NASA when you introduced duplicate matter theory. That was the find of the decade.
- Thank you.<eos> Sorry, what is going on?<eos> - These NASA assessments claim you have...<eos> "Little to no risk aversion."<eos> A similar view held by your flight-school instructors.<eos> Those... those assessments are classified.<eos> Wait. Is this... is this some kind of a job interview?<eos> 'Cause, you know, I appreciate the mystery flights and everything but I could've saved you all a lot of time and trouble.<eos> I am not interested. - Thank you.<eos> - You haven't heard our offer.
Michael?<eos> What the hell is happening here, man? What the hell's happening?<eos> Put the gun down, put the gun down!<eos> I'll tell you what's happening, but first you gotta answer me!<eos> Bullshit.<eos> How did you survive?<eos> How did you survive?<eos> Shit!<eos> Warning!<eos> Citizen, you are trespassing in a restricted area.

Take four steps forward and lie face-down, arms and legs spread.<eos> Wait! Wait! Wait!<eos> Let me prove it to you!<eos> Let me prove it to you.<eos> Positive identification.<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> Remain where you are.<eos> A transport is on its way.<eos> It will escort you to Alterplex command in a few seconds.<eos> Remain where you are.
After decades of research, we are proud to finally unveil the future of energy harnessing and realize our dream for a better tomorrow powering us for millennia to come.<eos> This is a notification for all Alterplex personnel.<eos> Reminder.<eos> Due to the increased violent protests the emergency security policy will now also include sectors five... - ...seven and ten.<eos> - Yes. No. We're not there yet.<eos> We're still waiting on the...<eos> diagnostics report, yeah.<eos> Well, I'll check on him. I'll check him. Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> So glad you're here, Will. I'm sorry.

How are Mia and Donny adjusting?<eos> Well... a little up and down, to tell you the truth.<eos> You know, new city and everything.<eos> They have a lot of questions.<eos> And frankly I still don't fully understand what I'm doing here myself.<eos> Before we go any further this is for you.<eos> It's not a gift, I'm afraid.<eos> It's a locator.<eos> Keep it on at all times.<eos> Once we're live, you're on call 24/7.

What is this?<eos> What in hell is really going on down here?<eos> Run it, please.<eos> After the end of fossil fuels, mankind is faced with its greatest challenge yet.<eos> With the world's energy consumption tripling in the last decade alone a new form of sustainable energy is needed.<eos> A system that outshines solar, wind and even nuclear energy.<eos> After years of research we at Alterplex have found the answer to the energy crisis by leveraging the immense hidden power of M-theory first proposed by Edward Witten in 1995 and enhanced by Pieter Klintsen's duplicate-matter theory.<eos> M-theory unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory.<eos> By deconstructing space-time into a higher number of dimensions our tower is able to create a mirrored echo of our local universe.<eos> You're copying the entire universe?
You're copying the entire universe?<eos> ...symmetry down to every last quantum particle with one crucial difference.<eos> The echo universe will be devoid of organic compounds.<eos> Instead, it will be a lifeless cosmos providing a limitless amount of matter that can be transformed into power.<eos> Acting as a dimensional conductor the tower will create multiple gravity portals which will harvest the echo's mass and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy.<eos> This energy is then transferred cleanly and safely into our world powering it for millennia to come.<eos> I had the exact same face.<eos> - Parallel universes?<eos> - An echo universe.<eos> And this here is where you come in.

The box will counterbalance any instabilities that might occur in the echo.<eos> Instabilities?<eos> Very simple.<eos> It plugs right into the echo tower.<eos> Someone needs to get it there.<eos> - May I?<eos> Just plug it in?<eos> - That's it?<eos> - That's it. There's a terminal at the base of the echo tower.<eos> You jump over, take the box to the tower, plug it in and jump back in time for dinner.
Don't trust her.<eos> Reynard is waiting with what's left of the team. We're regrouping.<eos> - No. No. I can't...<eos> - The plan failed, Will. Badly.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Come with me, and we will fix this.<eos> Abby.<eos> No, Abby. I can't.<eos> - We gotta go.<eos> - You have been identified.
I'll bring him in...<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> Run! We see you.<eos> Lie on the ground, and place your hands over your head.<eos> This is your last warning!<eos> Alright!<eos> Abby, let's go! Come on!<eos> Drive! Come on!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Goddamn you!
Okay?<eos> You should get out and enjoy the city a bit.<eos> Have you taken him out on the canals yet?<eos> We'll be fine, Will.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Bleeding.<eos> Shit.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You alright?
We'll be fine, Will.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Bleeding.<eos> Shit.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You alright?<eos> We have to bring you to Reynard. He'll know what to do.<eos> Reynard and his team just tried to put us in a coma!<eos> Because you attacked us!

He'll know what to do.<eos> Reynard and his team just tried to put us in a coma!<eos> Because you attacked us!<eos> - Will?<eos> - They were aiming at me, Abby.<eos> - Why?<eos> You're one of us!<eos> - Not anymore, Abby.<eos> Just get me into the tower. The tower.<eos> What are you going to do without the box?
Drone! Drone!<eos> Will!<eos> We have to move out of the open.<eos> Come.<eos> Safe.<eos> Let's go!<eos> ...we are not the military.<eos> We are an energy corporation. And The Rebels?<eos> They're anarchists. That statement, given by Alterplex CEO August Reynard condemning the environmental group which attacked...<eos> If you find any water, take it.
Let's go!<eos> Let's go! Come on!<eos> Flyjack 21-B require ground support at grid two.<eos> Flyjack 21-B require ground support at grid two.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Stay down.<eos> We're about to lay down suppressing fire.<eos> On red, shoot to kill. Repeat, shoot to kill.<eos> Visual on target! Engage!<eos> You okay? Okay?
Look out!<eos> What's it doing?<eos> It's working.<eos> Hey, Donny, you see that?<eos> See that beam of light?<eos> That is pure energy that is being sucked down into the tower.<eos> That's gonna power the whole city here, maybe the whole country.<eos> - Sucking it from where?<eos> - Well...<eos> Will Porter, you are now on call.
We need to get him real help.<eos> Will, Will, Will, Will.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait. Wait.<eos> - Stay with me.<eos> I know a place, just a few blocks from here.<eos> No, no, no. It's me, it's Michael.<eos> I got an injured man here.<eos> Carry him.<eos> You brought us here?
I know a place, just a few blocks from here.<eos> No, no, no. It's me, it's Michael.<eos> I got an injured man here.<eos> Carry him.<eos> You brought us here?<eos> I had no choice, okay?<eos> He's bleeding to death.<eos> Weapons down, please.<eos> Weapons down. Come on!<eos> Are you awake, Will?
Are you awake, Will?<eos> - Where's Hugo? - Will!<eos> Come on, all your weapons down.<eos> Hey, Hugo!<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> I'd tell you, but we need the medic before he bleeds out. I'm telling you.<eos> Hugo!<eos> Stay here.<eos> - Come on, leave her alone.<eos> - Don't you fucking touch me!
- ...and I think maybe it's time that...<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that's so important to you.<eos> Mia, if he misses home, we'll go back on a trip.<eos> Let me go talk to him, okay?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - How long have I been out?<eos> - Who are you?
Let me go talk to him, okay?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - How long have I been out?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> No, we have to... we have...<eos> we don't have a lot of time.<eos> What...<eos> - Hey! - Easy!<eos> Who are you?
- Hey.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - How long have I been out?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> No, we have to... we have...<eos> we don't have a lot of time.<eos> What...<eos> - Hey! - Easy!<eos> Who are you?<eos> You have to let us go.
- How long have I been out?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> No, we have to... we have...<eos> we don't have a lot of time.<eos> What...<eos> - Hey! - Easy!<eos> Who are you?<eos> You have to let us go.<eos> We need to get out of here right now.<eos> - You work for Alterplex, just like her?
What...<eos> - Hey! - Easy!<eos> Who are you?<eos> You have to let us go.<eos> We need to get out of here right now.<eos> - You work for Alterplex, just like her?<eos> - You need to let us go now. - Tell him.<eos> Tell him.<eos> - Yeah, tell me.<eos> - Who do you work for? - What?
Tell him.<eos> - Yeah, tell me.<eos> - Who do you work for? - What?<eos> Come on, Michael.<eos> - Tell him.<eos> - Michael?<eos> Michael, come on.<eos> We need to go, we need to get out of here.<eos> Who is this guy?<eos> What are you doing?
Come on, Michael.<eos> - Tell him.<eos> - Michael?<eos> Michael, come on.<eos> We need to go, we need to get out of here.<eos> Who is this guy?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No, no, no... Don't.<eos> What are you do...<eos> Are you listening to me? We have to go!
Move out, guys!<eos> Move! Abby! Move!<eos> Will, come on!<eos> This way! It's the only way out!<eos> Michael, let's go, let's get the fuck out of here.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Abby, come on!<eos> Let's go! Go! Go!<eos> Come on, move it!<eos> Attention. You are harboring a wanted individual.

Abby, come on!<eos> Clear!<eos> - This way! - Abby!<eos> Abby! I couldn't tell you about the box!<eos> I know an escape tunnel nearby!<eos> Shit!<eos> Let's go! Come on!<eos> - Give me the box, Will. - We gotta move!<eos> We gotta move! Come on!<eos> Why are you standing there?
Let's go! Come on!<eos> - Give me the box, Will. - We gotta move!<eos> We gotta move! Come on!<eos> Why are you standing there?<eos> We gotta go down.<eos> Come on. Quick.<eos> Abby?<eos> Abby! What was I supposed to do?<eos> I couldn't tell you about the box once I knew I was in the echo!<eos> You weren't even supposed to be here!

Will Porter, please call in as soon as possible.<eos> Wait.<eos> Really?<eos> This for me?<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> So you sent me on a suicide mission?<eos> I'm tired of being fucked around, Abby! I am done!<eos> Where did my family go?<eos> Where are they, Abby?<eos> Will, where are you going?

Please, I didn't mean for this to become a big thing.<eos> Mia, it's a huge deal.<eos> You're my sister.<eos> I promised to look after you. And I...<eos> I don't feel like I've done a very good job.<eos> We're going home.<eos> All of us.<eos> - First thing in the morning I'm going to quit and we'll get on the first plane out of here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What kind of person are you?

I'm sorry.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Shit!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Critical failure protocol!<eos> You're going in!<eos> Will!<eos> I guess that resignation will have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry. - Where are they taking you?<eos> - Porter! You have to go now!
Take them up front.<eos> Hello, Will.<eos> - Whatever he says, don't listen to him!<eos> - On your knees! Stay down!<eos> - Don't trust him.<eos> - Jordan, let's go.<eos> It's an interesting strange beautiful paradox.<eos> Those two worlds conjoined like twins just from the womb.<eos> We have to sacrifice one so the other may endure.<eos> You're going to sacrifice the original universe.

- There is still time.<eos> - Time for what?<eos> You think I'd actually help you?<eos> With everything I know now?<eos> I know. This is a difficult decision.<eos> Difficult?<eos> Difficult?<eos> Killing my family is difficult?<eos> That's why going back is the only solution.<eos> You can see them again.

And I I don't feel like I've done a very good job.<eos> We're going home.<eos> All of us.<eos> I promise, I can fix this.<eos> I can't let you do it, Will.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't let you touch the box.<eos> This world is already dying.<eos> This cannot be the end.<eos> Do you realize what you're doing?

I'm Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> May I?<eos> Well, that depends.<eos> On what?<eos> On what you got in that flask of yours.<eos> Whiskey.<eos> I'll get you some ginger ale.
I'm Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> May I?<eos> Well, that depends.<eos> On what?<eos> On what you got in that flask of yours.<eos> Whiskey.<eos> I'll get you some ginger ale.<eos> I take it straight.<eos> How do you feel about free love?
Free love?<eos> Like Blake or Shelly's concept of?<eos> And Isadora Duncan.<eos> - The dancer.<eos> - She was an atheist. She had two children out of wedlock.<eos> They both died.<eos> It was quite tragic.<eos> - I didn't know. - Hmm.<eos> May I?<eos> No, you may not, old bean.

No, you may not, old bean.<eos> So what about this Isadora Duncan?<eos> Have you ever seen her dance? No.<eos> But I like her style.<eos> She's dark and wild as sin.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm the only girl in town with style. I guarantee you that.<eos> Lord, it's so blazing hot.<eos> I don't know how y'all can stand to wear all that wool and not want to strip down and jump in his own creek.<eos> Well, if you promise to join me.

Well, if you promise to join me.<eos> Oh, you think I wouldn't?<eos> Okay, then. Let's go.<eos> You mean tonight?<eos> It's almost midnight.<eos> - So?<eos> - Zelda,<eos> Daddy's r'aring to go.<eos> I got to scoot.<eos> You can telephone me some time.
- Zelda,<eos> Daddy's r'aring to go.<eos> I got to scoot.<eos> You can telephone me some time.<eos> Oh, can I?<eos> Judge Anthony Sayre's residence.<eos> Don't take any guff from the operator.<eos> They don't look kindly on soldiers phoning local girls.<eos> I'm going to be a famous writer some day.<eos> You should know that.
Who's that, Zelda?<eos> Just some boy.<eos> Sayre residence.<eos> Hello.<eos> She's not home, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> Because I could tell by the sound of your ring.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. Zelda's not here right now.<eos> No, Lieutenant Fitzgerald. She's not back yet.<eos> Yes, I'll let her know you called.<eos> Better call after 9 unless you want to antagonize the judge.
Oh, no. I saw it three times.<eos> We haven't been to the arcade for a while. Miss Sayre!<eos> - Ha ha!<eos> - What? - Uh-oh.<eos> - Oh, Lord.<eos> Now don't get awful flushed.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Miss Sayre.<eos> Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?

I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> I'm looking for you.<eos> Seems you found me.<eos> I imagine I have Tootsie to thank for that.<eos> Livye Hart, this is Lieutenant Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Much better now that I've found the elusive Miss Sayre.<eos> I'm hardly elusive, but life can be so awfully distracting.<eos> In fact, I'm surprised you even have a moment to chat with us, given how busy you must be with all that writing of yours.

Really?<eos> Well, I would be rewriting my novel right now, but I can't finish it because I find myself inordinately concerned with your phone line, Miss Sayre.<eos> No matter how many times I'd call, somehow I can't seem to find you in.<eos> Sounds like the problem's not the phone line.<eos> What were you calling about anyway?

How much money do you make anyway, Daddy?<eos> I'm sure Scott would like to know what a person gets paid to do a real job.<eos> I agree with Judge Sayre.<eos> Writing is not a real job.<eos> Now until you get paid for it.<eos> But I plan on getting paid a lot for it some day.<eos> As soon as Scribner's publishes my first novel. That's right.<eos> Now, Mark Twain, he was a millionaire.<eos> And Theodore Dreiser, they were voices of their generations.<eos> You are going to be our next Mark Twain?

That's right.<eos> Now, Mark Twain, he was a millionaire.<eos> And Theodore Dreiser, they were voices of their generations.<eos> You are going to be our next Mark Twain?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I'm going to be the next F. Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> Well, your father didn't care for me.<eos> Ah, he doesn't care much for any boy that comes courting.<eos> Most boys are too scared to talk to old Dick.<eos> And yet, knowing that, you threw me right in there anyway.

Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> Well, your father didn't care for me.<eos> Ah, he doesn't care much for any boy that comes courting.<eos> Most boys are too scared to talk to old Dick.<eos> And yet, knowing that, you threw me right in there anyway.<eos> Well, after the professors of Princeton, your father is a whoop and a holler.<eos> I like him.<eos> If I were the judge, I would lock you in a tower - like a princess.<eos> - He already has.<eos> What do you think Montgomery is?
If I were the judge, I would lock you in a tower - like a princess.<eos> - He already has.<eos> What do you think Montgomery is?<eos> It's a good place to be from. No buts about it.<eos> Well, hello, there, Zelda.<eos> Hey, John Sellers.<eos> Hi, y'all.<eos> This is Lieutenant Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> You got a cigarette for me, John?<eos> How long you in town for, Lieutenant?
I went to college, if that's what you mean.<eos> John Sellers was just telling us about the new car his daddy just got him.<eos> A Franklin Touring, slick as all get-out.<eos> Cost more than $3,000.<eos> Well, whoop-Dee-Doo.<eos> Isn't there anything more interesting to talk about than motorcars?<eos> Lieutenant Fitzgerald's going to think we're all a bunch of asinine clodhoppers.<eos> The thought never crossed my mind. Come on.<eos> Let's scoot before we get comfortable.<eos> You have a lot of friends.
Let's scoot before we get comfortable.<eos> You have a lot of friends.<eos> When I was 6, my mother threw a birthday party for me.<eos> Invited every child in school.<eos> No one came. - Not even one?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Not one.<eos> I ate the entire chocolate cake all by myself.<eos> And several candles.<eos> Oh, you are a heartless woman, Zelda Sayre.
I'm extremely talented at talking my way out of trouble. Oh.<eos> Are you now?<eos> And, uh, I've played hooky from high school nearly every day and still managed to graduate with a high B average. - Hmm.<eos> - And there's my lips. They're quite famous.<eos> Rumor has it I have the most kissable mouth in town.<eos> By the look of it, I can't disagree.<eos> That's not exactly a virtue in this town.<eos> Everybody knows everybody else's business.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You want to know what I think?

You know what you are? You're a narrow-minded pallbearer who wants to lock me up in this morbid Southern coffin of a town for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, I won't have it.<eos> I'll be with him if I want to be.<eos> That boy isn't who you think he is.<eos> You'll be making a terrible mistake.<eos> Well, it won't be the first time.<eos> Hey, Fitzgerald!<eos> Fitzgerald, move your ass up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You slept through the briefing.
Previously on "Bates Motel"...<eos> It's like there's a cord between our hearts.<eos> It's you and me. It's always been you and me.<eos> We belong to each other, and I don't ever want to live in a world without you.<eos> We pulled two bodies out of Falls Lake a couple days ago.<eos> We're charging you additionally with the murders of Jim Blackwell and Audrey Ellis.<eos> Norman is nice... okay, he's kind, he's a good person... but he just... he has another side to him.<eos> You know, I don't... I don't know what you'd call it, maybe multiple personalities or something, but he... he changes.
I'm not lying.<eos> All right, get this out wide.<eos> 30-mile radius, and call in the U.S. Marshal Service.<eos> I want everyone on this.<eos> And get somebody to check the residences. Bates and Romero.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Your brother Norman was kidnapped from the police station by Alex Romero.<eos> How the hell did you let that happen?
He took him somewhere to kill him.<eos> Okay, now, I-I don't know if that's... if that's the woods or if that's Norma's grave, I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is in... this is insane.<eos> Norman is sick, okay?<eos> He needs psychiatric help.<eos> Did you forget your brother has been charged with multiple murders?<eos> What, so... so that means, you know, you don't care if something happens to him?<eos> The person I care about the most is Regina Worth, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back safe.<eos> You better not let anything happen to him.
You sound like Norma.<eos> Tell me you love me, Emma.<eos> I'm not gonna arm you up so you can go and do something stupid.<eos> I'll never love anyone else but you.<eos> You screwed me there, Emma Decody.<eos> Yes?<eos> Uh, did my brother Norman check you in here?<eos> He's, uh, in his early 20s, dark brown hair, and really polite.<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> You, um... You need to leave.

He... Look, it... He made a mistake checking you in.<eos> Just... just take your kids, and leave.<eos> Okay. Um, kids.<eos> Kids!<eos> I need you to put your stuff in your roller bags.<eos> - But Mom!<eos> - Do it now!<eos> Here's some... here's some money.<eos> There's a... there's a motel, the Kings Motel.<eos> It's just... just up the road. You can stay there.
Someone's gonna hear you.<eos> Jim?<eos> Jim?<eos> Y-you there?<eos> It is 68 degrees and partly sunny in Bend, with another chance of rain on Saturday.<eos> Romero.<eos> You've got a visitor.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> How's life?<eos> Oh, I'm here because you were worried about me.

Say, 7:00 at the Temple Street Bar?<eos> I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.<eos> Great.<eos> It's a date.<eos> Great.<eos> Bye.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - See you.<eos> Hey.<eos> How do you feel?

That's good to hear.<eos> A pair of Eurasian jays.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> So we'll give this a go, then?<eos> Partner?<eos> We'll give it a go.<eos> Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> - I'm just visiting my sister. - Of course.<eos> Uh, which credit card will you be using today?
Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> - I'm just visiting my sister. - Of course.<eos> Uh, which credit card will you be using today?<eos> - Uh, cash.<eos> - Cash is fine.<eos> Who's your sister?<eos> Norma Bates.<eos> What?<eos> Um, when was the last time you talked to her?
Norma Bates.<eos> What?<eos> Um, when was the last time you talked to her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like, a year and a half ago.<eos> I've been out of the country.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your sister... she, uh... she passed away.<eos> It was a terrible tragedy.<eos> What are you talking about?
Uh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your sister... she, uh... she passed away.<eos> It was a terrible tragedy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> I was just with her son. He would've said something.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Look, she... she died.<eos> She committed suicide.<eos> It made the local news.<eos> I'm so sorry you had to hear about it this way.
Ah, Mr. Davidson.<eos> You need a room again for a few hours?<eos> No.<eos> I came to see you.<eos> This double date...<eos> I just came by to see... what kind of a man you are.<eos> I'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.<eos> All I can tell you is... stay out of it.<eos> Well, you're right.

Just go out the window now.<eos> Take the keys.<eos> Get in the back of the car and lay down so no one can see you.<eos> I will be done with dinner soon.<eos> Just wait for me.<eos> Norman, do you still like me?<eos> Yes. Mother, yes.<eos> I still like you.<eos> Now go!<eos> Given what happened... I can go to a circuit judge and effectively argue that your life is in jeopardy in here and that it was punitive to ever put you in a medium-security prison based on a perjury charge.
- What are you doing?<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - No, Mother. You can't.<eos> - Can't I?<eos> Bourbon, neat.<eos> How's your night going?<eos> Oh, it's going.<eos> I'm just sick of my job.<eos> I hear you.<eos> What do you do?
Carlos, this is Merche.<eos> - This is no time to call.<eos> - I have to speak to Laura.<eos> You can speak tomorrow.<eos> Please, don't call again at this time.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> You forgive me.<eos> If you'd been pregnant, we would have had it, I swear.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If you don't want an apprentice, remove the sign.
Call me afterwards.<eos> - No, Carlos.<eos> - Please, promise me.<eos> - Call me when you come back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> FRIDAY, APRIL 29<eos> You're fired.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're fired.<eos> You gave me the morning off.
He works here.<eos> There's no one here with that name.<eos> Well, it's a nickname.<eos> His name is... Garcia.<eos> Or Garces.<eos> Garces.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I have to speak to him.<eos> He's doing his rounds.<eos> Can you call him?

Okay, Norma.<eos> Like when we were little.<eos> That pure place.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Norman will probably have to kill you.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> I love you, Norma Louise.<eos> I know.<eos> What are you doing? Whoa.

Point that somewhere else, okay?<eos> You trying to steal our car? No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was hiking, and I got lost.<eos> I'm just gonna step out of the car, okay?<eos> Point... point that away, will you?<eos> Hey, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna close the door.<eos> I'm sorry. I... i took a really bad fall, And I'm cold, so I just got in there<eos> Okay? I'm bill. What's your name?<eos> You don't look like a hiker.
Yeah, I know. Didn't exactly dress right. - It was pretty stupid.<eos> - I'm gonna get my mom.<eos> No, no, no, you don't need to do that.<eos> Found Norman in the basement, Passed out, holding hands with his uncle While he thought he was Norma.<eos> I carried him upstairs and put him in bed.<eos> Move.<eos> Feels like things are coming to a significant head.<eos> The action's good.<eos> The ribbon is dry.<eos> Do you know where I could get this thing inked?
Yeah. I'm a writer.<eos> You want something to write with, I got laptops.<eos> Desktops are...<eos> Yeah, those aren't for me.<eos> Most people like to think that old technology is useless.<eos> That's not true.<eos> It's just become unfashionable.<eos> Well, if it worked for Hemingway,<eos> Chandler, and hammett, It's gonna have to work for me.<eos> What are you writing?
You're not taking responsibility for all this.<eos> Booth. If we hadn't quit our jobs...<eos> Allison Monroe still would have been killed.<eos> We know that this guy's got this, like, crazy genius IQ level and he's manipulative as they come.<eos> Talk about a classroom from hell.<eos> These are your clothes, Bones.<eos> The victim is meant to be you.<eos> As I said on the phone, I'm happy to do whatever I can do to be of assistance. But that said, I can't breach doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> I'd like you to return to your dreams.<eos> If you knew what I knew, you'd be so proud.
He took her, and he's gonna kill her.<eos> I need your damn notes.<eos> She said that your hands were burnt, like they'd been in some kind of an explosion.<eos> Dreams aren't always literal, I mean, Wendell could just be a symbol here.<eos> A symbol for what?<eos> For someone who used to work at the lab.<eos> Zack?<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> It is good to see you again.<eos> You and I... We have so much to talk about.

Basement and five floors up.<eos> I say we start at the top, work our way down.<eos> Or maybe not. He's in the basement.<eos> How do you know?<eos> It's Zack.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> You understand?<eos> It's the only place he would take her.<eos> Zack, you don't have to do this. Stop.
The syringe, he wasn't going to use it on me.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Dr. Brennan is telling the truth.<eos> My plan was to inject myself. This is sodium thiopental.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> I need Dr. Brennan to believe me.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> ♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Dr. Saroyan, hey.<eos> You sure you want to be out here?

Perhaps I should be kidnapped more often.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> How are the kids?<eos> They're fine. And clueless.<eos> My dad is taking such good care of them, they had no idea I was missing, which is a good thing.<eos> Right, uh, well, Booth, Dr. Brennan, this is<eos> Dr. Roshan.<eos> He is the head of the facility where Zack was institutionalized.<eos> Dr. Roshan, thank you so much for being here.

Withdrawn, I think, is the... best way to describe him.<eos> Listen, Booth, why don't you, uh... why don't you let me have the first crack at him?<eos> No.<eos> I'm the one Zack wanted to see;<eos> I should be present.<eos> No. Aubrey's right.<eos> Zack wants you, which is the last thing that we should give him.<eos> Dr. Addy, hello.<eos> My name is Special Agent James Aubrey.<eos> As you can imagine, I've got quite a few questions to ask you.

I hope you appreciate I'm being forthright.

And then "breaking" into the local library in order to read and also to access their computers so I can keep up-to-date with all my friends and colleagues.<eos> Dr. Brennan, Hodgins, Angela, and Dr. Saroyan.<eos> Zack, you've been spying on all of their e-mail accounts?

We do not.<eos> Not over e-mail.<eos> Angela, what is that untitled folder?<eos> Let me check it out.<eos> Dr. Alexander Bancroft.<eos> Why does that name sound so familiar?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Um... this has to be a mistake.<eos> So, this puppet show from hell is everything probative we found in Graham Reynolds' basement.<eos> As you can see, there's blood trace on the drill bit and spindle as well.
I get it, Aubrey.<eos> You know what, it-it fits.<eos> I mean, and Zack here, you know?<eos> Being kind to Hodgins and...<eos> You're not convinced.<eos> I just want some outside help on this.<eos> Call Behavioral Analysis.<eos> See if there's a profiler available.<eos> Um, I think maybe I could be of some help with that.<eos> I thought you got transferred to Kansas City.
As is self-evident.<eos> So... anything new going on?<eos> Dr. Brennan, I wanted to let you know that I've identified the bone shards we found in the puppeteer's basement.<eos> Did all the fragments belong to our previous victims?<eos> Yes. Based on the texture and color, I was able to ascribe the majority of the fragments to Melissa Goodman, the most recent victim.<eos> What about any evidence that could possibly exonerate or... convict Dr. Addy?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't find any such evidence.<eos> Nor was I looking for any.<eos> You always taught me to examine the evidence without any preconceived bias.

Mr. Bray, i-if you would, I could use an extra set of eyes.<eos> While performing a histological examination on this chipped fragment of a central incisor, I found something of note.<eos> This piece of tooth shows tetracycline banding.<eos> Evidence that the victim took antibiotics before age eight.<eos> Right, but I've already examined all three victims, and this banding wasn't present in any of their teeth.<eos> I concur.<eos> Which means this fragment came from a fourth victim.<eos> Okay. No.<eos> But here...<eos> You know what?
But here...<eos> You know what?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Oh. If it was latent, it could be...<eos> I'm just gonna orange Post-it.<eos> Move this guy here and here.<eos> And then I can...<eos> Uh, green. I got it.<eos> What'd you get? I got it.
Not necessarily.<eos> Memory loss is a symptom of this condition.<eos> So one personality isn't cognizant of what the other is doing.<eos> What about Dr. Faulk?<eos> You still think he could've done it?<eos> I think that he is an excellent suspect.<eos> Think about it.<eos> His parents were murdered when he was seven years old.<eos> That's exactly the kind of trauma that brings on D.I.D. Plus, he's a psychiatrist, and, in general, they tend to be like...<eos> You know what I mean?
I don't care where they are.<eos> Find him.<eos> Hello.<eos> Booth.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Cam, slow down.<eos> Slow down.<eos> What do you mean Bones is gone?<eos> This is even creepier than I imagined. Oh, sorry.<eos> Uh, this is Booth on the phone.<eos> Why don't you take the wall by the windows? Okay.
There's a fourth victim?<eos> Yes. Listen, Bones, do me a favor.<eos> Just get out of the basement right now.<eos> Will you listen to me for once?<eos> Booth, I can't hear you. You're breaking up.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Geez, Bones...<eos> Wendell?<eos> Are you okay, Wendell?
Dr. Hodgins, please swab for particulate evidence.<eos> Dr. Hodgins?<eos> You're only now noticing he's not here, aren't you?<eos> We couldn't stop him from going.<eos> Zack, I've brought you some visitors.<eos> Hodgins.<eos> This is unexpected.<eos> And Miss Delfs.<eos> It is a pleasure to see you again.<eos> Oh, I'm... flattered that you remember.
Hodgins.<eos> This is unexpected.<eos> And Miss Delfs.<eos> It is a pleasure to see you again.<eos> Oh, I'm... flattered that you remember.<eos> It was just so many years ago.<eos> But, um, I was working on my dissertation, and Zack was nice enough to grant me a series of interviews.<eos> Miss Delfs was just one of many who came to see me.<eos> It is odd, but being perceived as a murderous cannibal does have some advantages.<eos> Okay, Dr. Lecter, why don't you take a seat?
Zack, look at me.<eos> Angela found the e-mails that you sent.<eos> The ones in Dr. Bancroft's name.<eos> I see.<eos> You are right to be angry with me.<eos> No, Zack, what you did... it was genius...<eos> I have feeling again in my legs.<eos> Hodgins, you should not be thanking me.<eos> Why not?<eos> Is it because you feel guilt for other things that you've done?
Dr. Faulk?<eos> Hello?<eos> Booth...<eos> Hmm? I don't think he's here. You think?<eos> Aubrey, it's Booth.<eos> I want you to put an APB out on Dr. Faulk.<eos> Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.<eos> Your husband, when... when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.

The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you.<eos> Steer your investigation.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Come on, Booth.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it?<eos> Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.<eos> Ooh, thank you, Agent Aubrey, for your enthusiasm-- you're a heck of a salesman.

Done.<eos> No.<eos> No. No.<eos> No.<eos> Booth, just think about this.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> There are two ways this can go.<eos> Let's say Zack is innocent.<eos> He takes a look, doesn't find anything, or, better, he looks and finds something that we missed.<eos> So you think he's innocent?
Let's say Zack is innocent.<eos> He takes a look, doesn't find anything, or, better, he looks and finds something that we missed.<eos> So you think he's innocent?<eos> Oh, no; he totally did it, which is why I want to confront him with what he's done, because then, maybe...<eos> His other personality will present itself.<eos> Look, I know it's a long shot, but just... let me talk to Zack.<eos> Okay?<eos> Let me be the one to present him with the case file.<eos> Do it.<eos> Tell Zack the plan, will you?
Look, this is the perfect opportunity.<eos> If it is him, this will help lure out the alternate identity.<eos> What if it's not him?<eos> Well, then your wife will be in no danger whatsoever.<eos> Please, Booth.<eos> I-I need to do this.<eos> Yes, just stick with me. Bones, just...<eos> I like this part.<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> It is so good to have you joining me.

Yes, thank you.<eos> I've had ample time.<eos> If Dr. Brennan and I could proceed...<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Just one question before we start.<eos> I-I wondered... what you thought of my profile of the killer.<eos> My opinion is immaterial.<eos> My expertise is in forensic anthropology, not psychology.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> You know what?

Sorry.<eos> Um, what about blackouts?<eos> Have you had any in the last year?<eos> Zack.<eos> If you and I are going to continue, you have to answer that.
Have you had any in the last year?<eos> Zack.<eos> If you and I are going to continue, you have to answer that.<eos> Yes.<eos> I admit I have had lapses in memory, most likely due to changes in my medication.<eos> Now may we continue?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Dr. Brennan.<eos> If we could, I would like to start with the third victim.<eos> Specifically, on the right hand, you found longitudinal fractures of the second, third and fourth proximal phalanges.
When I asked why Karen left, Paul said-- and I quote-- "legally," he couldn't comment.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'm gonna keep asking around, but in the meantime, you want me to take Karen off the case?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> And also, I got Dr. Roshan waiting for you.<eos> Apparently he's got some suspects he wants you to look at.<eos> Okay, bring him in here.<eos> Doc.<eos> Agent Booth, thank you for seeing me.

I got your point, okay?<eos> You think that Zack is guilty, but once again my gut is telling me something else, all right?<eos> Once again?<eos> Hold on a second, what are you saying?<eos> Are you saying that you didn't think he was guilty the first time with the lobbyist?<eos> I got to go.<eos> Ms. Delfs, for the last time, I'm fine.<eos> Please stop following me.<eos> Well, Dr. Brennan, I'm just trying to help.<eos> I really think that after what happened with Zack, you need time to process.

Dr. Brennan.<eos> I think you need to come with me.<eos> Let's find you a place to sit down.<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Faulk warned us someone would insert themselves into the case, manipulate it.<eos> That the killer would need to feel in control. The ki...<eos> Oh...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I need to know why you left your last job.
That the killer would need to feel in control. The ki...<eos> Oh...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I need to know why you left your last job.<eos> Uh, okay-- it's because my married boss kept hitting on me, incessantly, so I hit him back.<eos> Incessantly.<eos> Dr. Brennan, is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine, except for a whole lot of crazy going on.<eos> Uh, Mr. Bray, I'm fine, unless... unless you have something.
Yeah, everything's fine, except for a whole lot of crazy going on.<eos> Uh, Mr. Bray, I'm fine, unless... unless you have something.<eos> Uh, yes, actually, I did find something.<eos> Here, take a look at the victim's L4.<eos> There appears to a sliver of fused vertebra attached, but what doesn't make sense...<eos> Is that the sliver is connected at a near 90 degree angle.<eos> Oh, I know what happened.<eos> The lower half of the body is not missing.<eos> It's still attached to a living person.<eos> Don't you see?
The lower half of the body is not missing.<eos> It's still attached to a living person.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> This half of the body used to be part of a larger whole.<eos> Conjoined twin.<eos> It fits.<eos> After being separated from his other half, the killer must have adopted his dead twin's personality.<eos> Zack didn't do it.<eos> Aside from the one on his forehead, he has no scars on his body.<eos> Yeah, I'm not even gonna ask how you know that.
Uh, add a beard and glasses.<eos> I need to call Booth.<eos> Bones, what's up?<eos> I was just heading back.<eos> Booth, Zack didn't do it.<eos> It was Dr. Roshan.<eos> I have proof.<eos> You... you have to trust me.<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> Dr. Addy, you've had quite a trying day, haven't you?
Dr. Addy, you've had quite a trying day, haven't you?<eos> Allow me to give you something to help you relax.<eos> Zack... give me your arm.<eos> I promise... this will only sting for a moment.<eos> Doctor, as I have always told people...<eos> I'm stronger than I look.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> Good-bye...<eos> Dr. Addy.<eos> Zack, you okay?
I'm okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Thank you for coming to visit.<eos> It is nice to see you both in a non-adversarial climate.<eos> Zack, given what's happened, I've been looking into having you transferred, if that's what you'd like.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been doing a great deal of thinking on the subject, and I believe I am now ready to reenter society.<eos> No, no, hold on, Zack, okay, this is a transfer.<eos> You understand that, correct?

Not even to save myself.<eos> No, I don't believe it.<eos> You confessed.<eos> The evidence...<eos> Should be reexamined.<eos> I did not kill him.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Booth...<eos> Trust me.<eos> Listen, you know what, we're gonna help you.

I don't want to have to put my mind to it.<eos> But you will, baby.<eos> Whether you want to or not.<eos> I'm just gonna run this laundry downstairs.<eos> I can do that, Mama.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt.<eos> Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.<eos> And so you have.
I can do that, Mama.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt.<eos> Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.<eos> And so you have.<eos> Mr. Perkins will see you now.<eos> - Fitzgerald.<eos> - Mr. Perkins.<eos> There you are, my boy.
It's Mark Kovac.<eos> This is our guy.<eos> Says here that General Josip Radik was shot at long range during his son's sixth birthday.<eos> Did you kill my father, Agent Booth?
Which means you don't have him yet.<eos> You need to sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> - He was right next to me.<eos> - Just see them.<eos> I'm happy the little guy's okay.<eos> How do you know it's a guy?<eos> Just got a feeling.<eos> Okay, Dr. Brennan, close your eyes. Now,<eos> I'm gonna touch one of your fingers, and you try to touch the corresponding finger on your other hand with your thumb.
Move through it.<eos> Man, are you kidding me?<eos> The blast emptied out all the bone storage drawers.<eos> It appears I'll need Dr. Vaziri's help.<eos> Not just Arastoo.<eos> You're gonna need all the help that you can get.<eos> Hey, I came as soon as I heard.<eos> Is Dr. Brennan okay?<eos> Well, we just got to wait.<eos> You know, right?
Well, he was in prison two nights ago, right?<eos> So he didn't set off those bombs.<eos> What about security inside the Jeffersonian? No.<eos> Everything between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. has been deleted.<eos> This guy is methodical.<eos> Which means it's high time we all consider joining Aubrey in Los Angeles.<eos> Maybe Judge Judy needs a prosecutor.<eos> There's no way I'm running. Tell you what.<eos> Go get Kovac's ex-wife.<eos> You think she's involved with this?
I can assure you, this is nothing compared to a mass burial site.<eos> In Guatemala, in Coban, I helped exhume over 500 sets of remains, all innocent victims of their civil war, their wrists still tied, blindfolds over their eyes.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. Brennan.<eos> What a horrible thing to witness.<eos> You remember that so clearly.<eos> Does that mean you're doing better?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> I mean, I do remember things.<eos> I-I remember watching Cam propose to you, how happy you looked.<eos> I remember that you used to carry a cigarette behind your ear to remind you of your father.

Our bomber's DNA.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen to me, Mrs. Kovac, I'm only gonna ask you one last time.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I told you.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Your husband calling your phone-- okay, that was a setup.<eos> No, no.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through.

What?<eos> You're hiding someone.
You're hiding someone.<eos> No!<eos> I am not!<eos> I swear to you.<eos> Agent Booth, two months ago, I found out my husband's real identity.<eos> Listen to me, Jeannine.<eos> This is my last offer to make a deal.<eos> I leave this room, and it's over.<eos> I swear to you, I don't know anything about what Mark has done, or what he's planning to do next.<eos> You willing to prove that?
They haven't helped trigger anything?<eos> No.<eos> Are those photos from Cam's wedding?<eos> They're from the reception.<eos> Since we know that Cam's ID was probably stolen from there, I thought it might help us find something.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Isn't that one of the waiters?<eos> Yeah, except he's carrying Cam's purse.<eos> I think this could possibly be the accomplice that we're looking for.<eos> When's the last time that you spoke to your husband?
It was you.<eos> It was you!<eos> Whoa! What?<eos> Agent Booth, It's all right.<eos> - Sit down. Lose the act.<eos> - what... what's happening?<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I told you I don't know where my husband is.<eos> All right, how about your brother?<eos> - What are you talking about?
- Sit down. Lose the act.<eos> - what... what's happening?<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I told you I don't know where my husband is.<eos> All right, how about your brother?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Stop lying!<eos> We know Mark Kovac is your biological sibling.<eos> That's sick.<eos> You're accusing me of incest?
All right, how about your brother?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Stop lying!<eos> We know Mark Kovac is your biological sibling.<eos> That's sick.<eos> You're accusing me of incest?<eos> No, we're accusing you of murder, and that's just for starters.<eos> We found your DNA on the explosive.<eos> The whole marriage thing, that was a cover-- almost worked, but it didn't.<eos> You've been working with him this whole time!

Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just delivered two buckets of fried chicken to your office. Really?<eos> Wow.<eos> To celebrate?<eos> Or commiserate.<eos> I heard about your breakup.<eos> And in my professional opinion, emotional eating always helps.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you hungry?
Oh, it's almost as mysterious as Dr. B's birthday party.<eos> Oh, speaking of which, I know it's a surprise, but can you give us a hint on the dress code? Yes.<eos> Wearing clothes would be advisable.<eos> Couldn't find a trail, but found this, huh?<eos> Smoking the dope.<eos> Not surprising.<eos> This is a local teen party spot.<eos> Hey, if there's any weed still in that pipe, I'll take it.<eos> Back to the lab for a forensic workup, guys, geez.<eos> Could you all please stop yammering and just get on with it?

Angela, don't you need to get that? Sorry, yeah, um...<eos> Okay, this is the third time that this unknown number has called today.<eos> Hey, good news.<eos> You're... asymmetrical.<eos> Ange, you said it was barely noticeable.<eos> Anyway, based on the colonization of mold spores on the marijuana that was in the pipe, I was able to determine that it was last smoked, like, 80 hours ago, so...<eos> So whoever was smoking in the woods was probably there right around the victim's time of death.<eos> I'm s-s-sorry, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> All right.<eos> You Randy Stringer? Uh, yeah.

Uh, yeah.<eos> But I didn't call an Uber.<eos> Oh, I'm not Uber. FBI.<eos> Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens. So?

FBI.<eos> Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens. So?<eos> Far as I know, there's no law against communing with nature.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.<eos> We found your marijuana pipe.<eos> According to your record, you got picked up twice for selling LSD and once for assault with a deadly weapon. Nah, nah.

Nah, nah.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.<eos> I was in the parking lot at a Phish show, cutting up some salami with my pocketknife, when the pigs nabbed me for dealing. Pigs?<eos> What is this, 1969?<eos> I'm telling you, man, the only thing I assaulted that day was some nice Soppresatta.<eos> Or, uh, maybe it was pepperoni. Randy.<eos> Do you recall seeing anything unusual in the woods that night?
If Angie can figure out a way to access it wirelessly, she may be able to find the victim's ID. Oh!<eos> Hodgins, your eyebrow appears to have grown back.<eos> Sorry to ruin your laugh-fest, there, but, yeah.<eos> I constructed a replacement using hair from my own beard. Really?<eos> Oh, here we go again.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Yeah. Hi.<eos> Listen, I don't have any credit card debt, and I'm-I'm just not interested in buying one of your cruises, so...<eos> Are you sure you're calling for me? Yeah.
Do you hear that?<eos> ! That's our song! Listen.<eos> You hear the soul in that?<eos> ♪ Do you do more than dance? ♪ I can't believe it.<eos> I've known Ian half my life.<eos> We've worked on AMI's development ever since our days at MIT.<eos> Who's Amy?<eos> The name is an acronym for Advanced Modular Intelligence.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here, let me introduce you.
Well, so am I.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> For a human.<eos> As we continue to educate AMI on the subtleties of human emotions, I'm afraid she's picked up a few bad habits.<eos> This robot can recognize facial expressions?<eos> Yeah, better than most people.<eos> AMI, please tell us what you observe.<eos> Dr. Brennan appears 78% curious and 22% jealous.<eos> Agent Booth is 94% amused and six percent skeptical.<eos> And you, Kate, are 100% nervous.
Yeah, better than most people.<eos> AMI, please tell us what you observe.<eos> Dr. Brennan appears 78% curious and 22% jealous.<eos> Agent Booth is 94% amused and six percent skeptical.<eos> And you, Kate, are 100% nervous.<eos> Oh, well, of course I am.<eos> I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI.<eos> Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?
Oh, well, of course I am.<eos> I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI.<eos> Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?<eos> Oh, no, we had a very fruitful working relationship.<eos> Had Ian lived, I am confident that we would have reached singularity within the next decade.<eos> - Sorry, singularity?<eos> - Uh, singularity is when intelligent machines become indistinguishable from humans.<eos> So, did you notice anything unusual about Ian's behavior last Friday?
So, did you notice anything unusual about Ian's behavior last Friday?<eos> Oh, unfortunately, I was out of town, delivering a speech.<eos> But I can give you his online calendar.<eos> Ian was highly scheduled, so I'm sure everything that he did should be on there.<eos> Bones, Bones, take a look at that guy with the... the wrist brace.<eos> Excuse me, sir. Yeah.<eos> It's okay, Alan, they're with the FBI.<eos> Then they should be smart enough to realize that it isn't an injury at all.<eos> It's carpal tunnel.<eos> You know, from sitting at a computer all day.

Ow!<eos> You are hurting me.
This man does not suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome, but he does have a boxer's fracture.<eos> Don't need a robot to figure that out.<eos> I've reviewed your medical records, Alan, and the injuries to your metacarpals are an exact match for the bruises on Ian's skull. Fine.<eos> So I hit him.<eos> That doesn't make me guilty of murder.<eos> Well, I'm not sure I trust the guy that sucker-punched his boss in the back of the head.<eos> I had just worked my third 16-hour day in a row when Ian tried to force me to work through the weekend.<eos> - I was tired.<eos> I lost it. - Really?<eos> You know what I think?

That's great.<eos> Where were you last Friday night?

That's great.<eos> Where were you last Friday night?<eos> Same place I always am-- my desk at Social Cybernetics where I was coding all night long.<eos> Well, our team will have to verify that. Yeah. Sure.<eos> Go right ahead.<eos> But if you want to find the actual killer, you ought to be questioning those nuts from Stop the Robopocalypse.
Well, our team will have to verify that. Yeah. Sure.<eos> Go right ahead.<eos> But if you want to find the actual killer, you ought to be questioning those nuts from Stop the Robopocalypse.<eos> The Roba what?<eos> Robopocalypse.<eos> They are a radical group who believe that A.I. is out to destroy humanity by enslaving the human race.<eos> Yes, and Ian's favorite hobby was going onto their blogs and baiting them into fights.<eos> The same Ian that built these robots that helped these autistic kids?<eos> I know-- that seems out of character.<eos> Not if you knew the guy.
I know-- that seems out of character.<eos> Not if you knew the guy.<eos> Ian's death may have been a loss to the field of artificial intelligence, but in reality... the guy was a dink.<eos> Did he just say "dink"?<eos> I think he did.<eos> Any word from the NFL?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I can't stop stressing about it.<eos> Even if they do call Dr. Brennan for a reference, what if it backfires?<eos> You know, she does have a tendency to be blunt.

All right.<eos> Well, I mean... I'm no expert on women, but that really sounds like a trap to me.<eos> Is this really where the head of Robopocalypse lives, in the middle of this industrial wasteland?<eos> Well, this is where Angela tracked down his, uh, Wi-Fi coordinates, so he's got to be in there.<eos> Am I the only one smelling barbecue here?<eos> Good nose, Aubrey.<eos> Matthew Coburn?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Uh, we'd like to have a word with you.<eos> Come on, Matthew, give it up, will you?
You're kiddin' me, huh? Geez.<eos> Get off my partner.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Thanks for showing up, Aubrey.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just because I blogged about the military smart drone program doesn't make me guilty of treason.<eos> I had no idea those files were classified.<eos> We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.<eos> You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.

Well, destruction of property is still a felony.<eos> You'd want to destroy robots, too, if you realized what the government was doing with them.<eos> They're weaponizing this stuff.<eos> Turning them into autonomous robot killers.<eos> Hold... hold on a second here.<eos> I-Ian didn't even make weapons.<eos> I mean, the guy made robots that helped autistic kids.<eos> So he said.<eos> Guys like Ian always claim that they're trying to save the world, but the only thing they care about is selling out to the highest bidder.<eos> Do you know how many "amazing scientific discoveries"

See, when Alan comments, he starts at the beginning of the line, whereas Kate comments at the end and in all caps.<eos> So quirks like these are what you're calling a signature.<eos> Right. Now all I have to do is compare all the coders' signatures to the code used to delete AMI's data and see which one's a match.<eos> And... none of them are lining up.<eos> Okay, there's one more that I can try.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Ian was the one who deleted AMI's memory.<eos> Dr. Brennan, something's puzzling me about this injury on the proximal end of the tibia.<eos> It appears to be a postmortem tubercle fracture.<eos> You are correct.
Oh, my God.<eos> Ian was the one who deleted AMI's memory.<eos> Dr. Brennan, something's puzzling me about this injury on the proximal end of the tibia.<eos> It appears to be a postmortem tubercle fracture.<eos> You are correct.<eos> But tubercle fractures are not caused by objects striking the bone.<eos> They are created by forceful impact upon landing.<eos> Maybe the body was thrown into the trunk of a car when it was being transported.<eos> Well, if that were the case, we would have found corresponding injuries.<eos> You're right.
Well, if that were the case, we would have found corresponding injuries.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was stupid of me.<eos> No wonder the NFL hasn't called.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes. Had I been grading you, I would have given you a solid "B."<eos> But I'm capable of A-plus work.<eos> You've seen it.

But if you want to assume the position of lead forensic anthropologist, you need to do A-plus work at every moment of the day.
Not what I was expecting.<eos> That's a good way of saying it.<eos> Or putting it, not that I would put...<eos> You know... Hey, perverts.<eos> Want to keep your greasy mitts off my dolls?<eos> Look, I didn't do nothing wrong.<eos> Manufacturing sex dolls is not a crime.<eos> Mr. Esposito, we don't have any problems with your business.<eos> Well, that's not entirely true, but it's...<eos> We're here because you met with Ian Goldberg last Friday.

A guy like me can't hang out with a smart guy like that?<eos> Ian was murdered.<eos> This warehouse is the last known place he went.<eos> Ian's dead?<eos> I took a look at your old military records.<eos> Well, it turns out that you were dishonorably discharged for...
Ian was murdered.<eos> This warehouse is the last known place he went.<eos> Ian's dead?<eos> I took a look at your old military records.<eos> Well, it turns out that you were dishonorably discharged for...<eos> What'd they call it?<eos> "Excessive use of force."<eos> So, I had anger issues back then.<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> I think that Ian had the A.I. you wanted for your sex dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him using force, you wound up beating him to death.

What, selling, uh, robotic sex dolls?<eos> Sex bots are the future, my friend.<eos> Right now, I'm selling dolls that look and feel just like real women for six grand a pop.<eos> Now, can you imagine how much Ian and I would've raked in selling dolls that talk like real women, too?
Yeah, but who does that with a small blade like that?<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> We're dealing with highly intelligent computer scientists.<eos> It's possible they went to great lengths to obscure the evidence.<eos> What if it's the opposite, okay?<eos> What if we're not dealing with a genius, but a knucklehead stoner who already told us he has a pocket knife?<eos> So, we ran a drug screen on Ian's blood.<eos> Came up positive for LSD.<eos> You two were tripping on acid together the night that he died.
You two were tripping on acid together the night that he died.<eos> So, whatever, man.<eos> Ian and I did that sometimes.<eos> Said it helped him think outside the box.<eos> Doesn't mean I killed him. Well, we found sodium nitrate in the knife wounds in Ian's neck.<eos> Wh...<eos> What does that mean? It's a preservative used in sausages and other smoked meats.<eos> See, man, the package said it was all natural.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Oh, look, man, I d... I didn't mean to do that, you know?

That portable Bluetooth speaker, man.<eos> Let me get this straight: you killed Ian over a bad present?

That was pure creative genius.<eos> So when Ian said he made a deal and wanted to go to the woods to celebrate, I assumed I was getting a piece of that action.<eos> All he gave me was a lousy portable Bluetooth speaker, so I hit him in the head with it.<eos> You must have been tripping pretty hard to try to cut off his head with a pocketknife and then hide his body up a tree. I...

I...<eos> I took two tabs.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> But you're gonna have a lot of time to think now, 'cause you're going to prison for a long time.
You did?<eos> Yes. But you made such a big deal about me not being a genius.<eos> Well, I did do a rather remarkable acting job, didn't I?<eos> Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled. I tell you, Bones, keeping a secret is not one of your strong suits.<eos> That's a good job. That's one of the many benefits of growing older.<eos> We grow wiser in the process.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Oh... I'm gonna miss all of you.<eos> Champagne...<eos> You are a highly-skilled scientist, Daisy.

Easy.<eos> Wow, you were not kidding.<eos> This is like one of those black snake fireworks.<eos> I told you!<eos> All right.<eos> Science is cool!<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. You've got to work on your delivery. Uh...<eos> Excuse me, are you FBI?<eos> Because I must insist that you remove all these people in Hazmat suits immediately.
I'd say at least 70.<eos> Killing Grandpa, huh?<eos> That's not good press for your company.<eos> You want to put that camera away?<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> Maybe our victim here was one of the plaintiffs suing Goodlife Chemical. Hey, Bones, can you just tell me when the body was dumped in the acid there.<eos> I can't say with any accuracy, but Hodgins would have a better idea.<eos> Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> So, do you have direct access to this site?
Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> So, do you have direct access to this site?<eos> I must warn you, if you even insinuate my involvement in this man's death,<eos> I will sue you for slander.<eos> Right.<eos> That's exciting.<eos> Go ahead and try.<eos> Oh, no, it's the press.<eos> Could you people please hurry along?

I said hurry! Let's go!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, the acid is all over me!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm... Calm down, calm down.<eos> Oh! You want me to calm down?<eos> ! Calm down?<eos> ! Are you insane? !

That's ageism, Booth.<eos> Ageism?<eos> Now you're accusing me of being ageist? Yes.<eos> However, If you'd like to talk about something else, we could always return to you being...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> How about those Mets?<eos> What are the Mets?<eos> Have to admit, this is a lot nicer than I expected.<eos> Right.<eos> Did you just, uh...

Are you okay?<eos> Given your occupation, I would imagine you'd be accustomed to literally being surrounded by death.<eos> What?<eos> Death is inevitable.<eos> Bones, you don't...<eos> And in his case, relatively imminent.<eos> Stop.<eos> Sorry, she didn't mean that.<eos> She just likes to blurt things out.<eos> You're gonna have a very healthy and happy life in front of you.
Golf clubs.<eos> Rebar.<eos> Baseball bat.<eos> - Nunchucks...<eos> - Guys. Our victim was an old man in a nursing home.<eos> You might want to think cane.<eos> Cane.<eos> Here we are.<eos> This is Mr. Felbeck's suite.<eos> As you can see, we provide very spacious accommodations for all of our residents... uh, excuse me, what exactly is that?

So, they suffer from dementia, Alzheimer's.<eos> When they get confused, there are times when unfounded accusations are made.<eos> Booth, I found something.<eos> She found something.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Is this where he died?<eos> No, this is where he went to heaven.<eos> My husband is euphemistically referring to sex.<eos> By the sheer quantity...<eos> You're gonna need a new cleaning service.
Excuse me.<eos> Listen, let me just do all the talking.<eos> I don't want you to excite them, or say something that's gonna, like, freak 'em out.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I have no intention of causing this poor woman a myocardial infarction.<eos> Hi, ladies.<eos> Uh, Barbara Baker, can we speak to you for one moment?<eos> Oh, not now.<eos> I'm 84 and I'm playing bridge.<eos> Whatever you need cannot be more important than playing bridge.
Hi, ladies.<eos> Uh, Barbara Baker, can we speak to you for one moment?<eos> Oh, not now.<eos> I'm 84 and I'm playing bridge.<eos> Whatever you need cannot be more important than playing bridge.<eos> It has to do with James Felbeck.<eos> If anyone looks at my hand, I'll know.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Is James okay?<eos> Maybe you'd like to sit down.
Barbara!<eos> Calm down... Oof! Ooh!<eos> Hey!<eos> I said stop it!<eos> Booth, I would say we have our next suspect, except I'm not sure who seems more guilty.<eos> Mr. Tucker or the cane-wielder herself?<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's gonna leave a bruise.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> You must arrest him.
Mr. Tucker or the cane-wielder herself?<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's gonna leave a bruise.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> You must arrest him.<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> Do I look like a murderer? Yes.<eos> Let's just... remain calm, all right?<eos> Look, all I have to do is ask a few questions, that's all.<eos> You want to question us together?

Well,<eos> Columbo always questions his suspects separately.<eos> That's very true.<eos> I'm... that was... the actor.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm not Columbo.<eos> My husband doesn't believe you're true suspects. Yeah.

Yeah.<eos> - Because you're so old.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Thanks, Bones.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't...<eos> Barbara, let me ask you a question, please, do... why do you think, uh, Rufus here is involved?<eos> 'Cause he's jealous.<eos> Ah, Ge... Jealous of your relationship with Mr. Felbeck?<eos> You two previously dated?
I courted Barbara.<eos> He asked if I wanted to pork.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It's a line that's had limited success.<eos> James, on the other hand, was a gentleman.<eos> He was kind and a good man.<eos> A surprise.<eos> Someone that I could see myself spending the rest of my days with.<eos> Mr. Tucker. Hmm?<eos> Where were you the night before last?
I've been looking at the victim's medical charts.<eos> James Felbeck had osteoporosis.<eos> So his bone matrix was compromised. Well, yes and no.<eos> He was taking part in a drug study to repair lost bone mass.<eos> And as of his last bone density test, which was six months ago, his T-score was +1. +1?<eos> Doesn't sound too promising.<eos> Actually, it means his bones were as strong - as a 30-year-old's.<eos> - And given the severity of the damage we're seeing, I don't think there's any chance one of the fellow residents could have done this to him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, are you Red Hudmore? I'm FBI,

Uh, did you know him?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> What about Rufus Tucker?<eos> He said he saw you in the TV room the night before last.<eos> Yeah, I was there till, uh... uh, 10:00.<eos> He kept flipping the TV channels and talking about his all-time favorite television babes.<eos> A gentleman... would never talk that way about Donna Reed.<eos> Wait a second...<eos> You were with the 720 MP Battalion?
Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> What about Rufus Tucker?<eos> He said he saw you in the TV room the night before last.<eos> Yeah, I was there till, uh... uh, 10:00.<eos> He kept flipping the TV channels and talking about his all-time favorite television babes.<eos> A gentleman... would never talk that way about Donna Reed.<eos> Wait a second...<eos> You were with the 720 MP Battalion?<eos> Don't tell me you heard of us. I have not.
My pops, my grandfather, he served with them back in the '50s.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> That's what they called us.<eos> That's right.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Bones, hold-- one more thing.<eos> You know, I may need another set of eyes and ears on the property while I'm gone, in case you see anything.

Golden retriever, beagle, Pomeranian...<eos> Yeah, they're all comfort dogs.<eos> The kind used in therapy.<eos> Also I found trace of the victim's blood.<eos> Which means wherever they do this type of therapy is most likely the room in which he was killed.<eos> This is the common area, where we do our dog therapy, among other activities.<eos> Who had access to the room last night?<eos> All the staff and residents have full access 24/7.<eos> This is Sam, one of our orderlies.<eos> He'll clear the area so you won't be disturbed.

Listen, come on, we got to get the orderly.<eos> What is it?<eos> We got to go find the orderly, come on.<eos> Excuse me, Sam?<eos> Sam Wadkins?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Booth? Yeah?<eos> There's blood on these supplies.<eos> Mr. Wadkins, will you take a seat, please?
Yeah.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Booth? Yeah?<eos> There's blood on these supplies.<eos> Mr. Wadkins, will you take a seat, please?<eos> I prefer to stand.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> So, our lab found Mr. Felbeck's blood on one of the solvents in your cart.<eos> If you want any leniency, I'd suggest now would be a great time to confess.

He hit my car.<eos> All I did was give him a push.<eos> Yeah?<eos> When you're six-six, 300 pounds, accidents can get pretty messy, can't they?<eos> I didn't kill Mr. Felbeck.<eos> He and I were friends.<eos> We used to watch movies together, boxing matches.<eos> He used to tell me about his time as a welterweight.<eos> He was one of the coolest old dudes I ever met.<eos> Okay, then, so, as his friend, then tell me, if not you, who else could have killed him?

This is a long time coming, old man. Okay.<eos> This is very, very demented. Yeah.<eos> Ready...<eos> 321 psi.<eos> That's a... That's a good, strong blow.<eos> Yeah, it felt really, really good.<eos> The problem is the ribs are barely fractured.<eos> Which means the killer is someone significantly stronger than Hodgins.<eos> Or our victim's bones weren't as robust as they were six months ago.<eos> I see you're, uh... you're taking some of our computers out for evidence.

No, I... I don't feel like it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, it's good exercise.<eos> We can go scope out some suspects. Well, I...<eos> Come on, let's go for a walk.<eos> Oh, ah, heck.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me give you a hand.<eos> Let me give you a hand.<eos> You get that. All right, all right...

What happened?<eos> We were just going for a walk, and he fell.<eos> You were exerting him, weren't you? No, I didn't.
And someone has been using it to sell prescription medication online.<eos> Was it the victim?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But whoever they are, they've been running some pretty questionable searches.<eos> I mean, anyone who looks up naked pictures of Donna Reed...<eos> that's just wrong.<eos> What, did I say something?<eos> Booth, I know who you need to bring in for questioning.<eos> Mr. Tucker, we did some digging on the computers at the retirement home.<eos> We know that you were selling James Felbeck's drug medication online.

So you want to know what I think happened?
Well, my taxes pay for your salary.<eos> I'm glad to see that they're not being wasted.<eos> Okay. So you want to know what I think happened?<eos> Might as well. I'm paying for it.<eos> I think you stole his medication to sell online, replaced it with some kind of placebo.<eos> Felbeck found out and he confronted you.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, I take back what I said about the excellent detective work.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you tell me what happened?

Why you?<eos> Hmm?<eos> You two close?<eos> No.<eos> Barely knew each other.<eos> But he knew... I was street.<eos> You're street? Yeah.
Felbeck needed that medication.<eos> His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.<eos> He tell you why he needed that money? No.<eos> He said it was urgent.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Promise.<eos> Thank you so much for coming in.

I understand that he was a boxer.<eos> He was a boxer? When?<eos> That's a lifetime ago.<eos> He told me he started boxing in his early 20s.<eos> Before the war.<eos> Wait, he said that he served in the military? Uh-huh.<eos> What is it, Bones?<eos> I need to get back to the lab.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Baker.<eos> You have been very, very helpful.

You have been very, very helpful.<eos> Dr. Brennan, I ran all the tests you requested.<eos> Did you examine the victim's metacarpals?<eos> Yes, but because the bones were submerged in acid, all the remodeling has been obscured.<eos> What about x-rays?<eos> They're right here.<eos> There are no calluses on the victim's metacarpals.<eos> Which there most definitely would be had he actually boxed.<eos> What about the metatarsals?<eos> Did you find any remodeled march fractures?

There are some sacrifices that a man just should not have to make.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> So, what was the bigger lie? Get this, okay?<eos> The roommate in Richmond, Virginia?<eos> His name was Rufus Tucker.<eos> Oh, funny, Rufus didn't mention that.<eos> That's right, bring him back in now, okay?<eos> Wow. Two detectives.<eos> Even more of my tax dollars at work.<eos> You lied to us.
Even more of my tax dollars at work.<eos> You lied to us.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I...<eos> I may have made some omissions.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're-you're right.<eos> I lied.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We know about you and the victim, how the two of you used to live together.

I've-I've swindled.<eos> But there is one thing I am not.<eos> You're not a murderer.

It's a match.<eos> So our killer was struck on the left side of the skull.<eos> Have you met anyone with a head injury?<eos> No.<eos> But the downward strike could've hit other parts of the body.<eos> Angela, run a new reenactment, this time hitting the clavicle.<eos> I think I know who did it.<eos> Hey, Red.<eos> Hey, Booth.<eos> What are you doing here?

Hey, Booth.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Look, Red, I know what happened.<eos> I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> Look, Dr. Brennan took a look at your x-rays, and... we know that you... fractured your left clavicle.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was an impact fracture, they said.<eos> From me impacting the ground.<eos> Look, I was there, Red.<eos> I saw what happened, you landed on your right side.

The fracture came when Felbeck hit you with his cane.<eos> You want to tell me what happened?<eos> It was when he started talking about the war.<eos> You caught him in one of his lies.
Studies show that sleep deprivation greatly diminishes productivity.<eos> So do you want me to wait before I call someone?<eos> What I want is assistance, if that's not too much trouble.<eos> Of course.<eos> I will... get right on it.<eos> Booth, you got a visitor, and, uh, FYI, he brought some tiny cakes with him.<eos> Uh, they're petits fours rather than cakes, Agent Aubrey.<eos> Whatever they're called, they look delicious. Hey.<eos> Uh, just a little back thing.<eos> Double-G. Glad you could make it.

Chef.<eos> Oh. My apologies, Chef Dr. Wyatt.<eos> Just call him Gordon Gordon.<eos> Agent Booth, um, while I'm absolutely delighted to be freed from the, uh, sweltering confines of a kitchen, you do know that I-I haven't really practiced any psychiatry for some time.

Plus, I need you, all right?<eos> Sweets said that you were the only one he trusted with his files, so.
It's just like riding a bike.<eos> All right? Plus, I need you, all right?<eos> Sweets said that you were the only one he trusted with his files, so.<eos> Yes.<eos> Poor Sweets.<eos> And I take it those are Dr. Sweets' session notes--<eos> - All of them with-with Dr. Addy?<eos> - Yes. Booth and I already read through all of them hoping to find something that could exonerate Zack.<eos> But, uh, we could definitely use someone of your expertise.<eos> Um, Agent Aubrey, if you were to yield to your desire, rather than fight it, I think you might be able to return to the matter in hand.
The Steel in the Wheels Original Air Date on March 7, 2017 ♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Well, uh, did some digging.<eos> Turns out there were 58 armed robberies in the tristate area during the week that the victim was killed.<eos> How many involved a handgun...<eos> Yeah, 19.<eos> Four of those were caught, which leaves us with 15 unknown masked bandits.<eos> Let's get the rest to the lab, see if they can narrow it down.<eos> Whoa. What the hell's going on here?<eos> Well, you told me to make myself at home. Have a biscuit.

Okay, so you found nothing in Sweets' notebook?

Thank you for coming in.<eos> So we need a-an assembled skull, like, yesterday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give me an hour, tops.<eos> You have 20 minutes, or I think Brennan is gonna have an aneurism.<eos> She just lost her father.<eos> I think her crankiness is just a symptom of her grief.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know. I just- - I wish there was something we could do.<eos> Hey. Have you found an ID?
Multiple accounts of breaking and entering, petty theft, burglary.<eos> So because of his past, you don't think that he's worthy of a proper investigation.<eos> What? No. I'm just saying that he had a checkered past.<eos> And I'm saying that just because somebody has a record it shouldn't define who they are.<eos> Dr. Brennan, just to be clear, you know that I'm not talking about your father here, right?<eos> I never said that you were. Oh, don't let me interrupt.<eos> But I could hardly pass this gorgeous creature without saying hello.<eos> Dr. Wyatt.<eos> Mmm. So good to see you again.<eos> Why are you wandering around with that cart?
Yeah, sorry about that.<eos> Booth had to go to the chiropractor to get his back checked out. I guess I accidentally double-booked.<eos> That's the victim's mother in there.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Dr. Wyatt has come all this way to assist us, and you and Booth couldn't find a space for him to work?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I-I'm sorry. It's extremely inconsiderate.<eos> Oh, really, it's a slight inconvenience.<eos> One that needs to be remedied immediately.<eos> I tell you what, can you just give us a few minutes and then the room will be all yours.

I just...<eos> I don't understand who could do something like this.<eos> Dustin never did anyone any harm.<eos> I know that this is difficult, Mrs. Doyle, but can you tell us when you last saw your son?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe two, three weeks ago.<eos> That job of his made it hard for him to get away.<eos> To what job are you referring? He was just promoted to the manager of the Waffle Shack on Thorndike Street.<eos> Uh, ma'am, I hate to tell you, but, uh, our records show that Dustin was fired from that job six months ago.<eos> No, you're wrong.

Most people don't notice.<eos> It... it would be much worse without my medication.<eos> Mrs. Doyle, our records also show that you're currently not employed.<eos> No.<eos> Dustin is the one who has been taking care of me.<eos> Prescriptions like yours could... cost upwards of $5,000, $10,000 a month.<eos> Well, like I said Dustin was an angel.<eos> Dr. Saroyan.<eos> Perfect timing. I believe I have found something of note.<eos> Ah, what have you got?
That would suggest that he was in a car crash within hours of his death.<eos> I just received ballistics on the gun we found near the body.<eos> It shows that it was fired and that there was one bullet missing from the chamber.<eos> So between the car crash and the fact that Dustin fired his gun, that should help us to narrow down the list of possible robberies.<eos> I'll let Booth know right away.<eos> But before I do...<eos> I have a little something I'd like to give you.<eos> What is this?<eos> A gift.<eos> Um, you may or may not know, but we have a tradition here at the Jeffersonian.

I heard you finished your doctorate, making you the first ever forensic anthropologist to be certified in both the United States and Cuba.
Charlene, this is Agent, um...<eos> Aubrey. FBI.<eos> Charlene was our brave teller who was held up.<eos> I'm sorry, I already spoke to an agent about the robbery.<eos> Yeah, this is about a homicide.<eos> The man who robbed you was murdered.<eos> Does that mean the money's been recovered?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Working theory is that he had an accomplice that killed him for his cut.<eos> Now, listen, do either of you recognize this guy?
This is him.<eos> This is definitely the man who robbed me.<eos> I can tell.<eos> I remember he had nice eyes. Nice eyes?<eos> The guy who held you at gunpoint?<eos> I know it sounds strange, but he was kind, all things considered.<eos> Seems to me like this may not have been Dustin's first heist.<eos> If it was, he certainly acted like he knew what he was doing.<eos> No, Dr. Hodgins, don't get up.<eos> Good Lord, don't tell me that you've gone and joined the Freemasons. Well, if I did,

Well, if I did,<eos> I wouldn't reveal it, now, would I?<eos> It's good to see you again.<eos> Likewise, my friend.<eos> So to what do I owe this honor?<eos> Hey, I thought you were taking a stab at Sweets' files there.
Good Lord, don't tell me that you've gone and joined the Freemasons. Well, if I did,<eos> I wouldn't reveal it, now, would I?<eos> It's good to see you again.<eos> Likewise, my friend.<eos> So to what do I owe this honor?<eos> Hey, I thought you were taking a stab at Sweets' files there.<eos> Yeah, a dead end, I'm afraid.<eos> But... by good fortune, I did get to see a rather exciting video of our deceased bank robber being aided by an accomplice.<eos> And that got the little gray cells churning.<eos> Okay, Poirot, what do you got?
Well, "accomplice" made me think of "apprentice."<eos> Apprentice as in Gormogon?<eos> Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but Dr. Addy's assertion is that he didn't murder anyone, but that the previous apprentice killed the lobbyist.<eos> That's right, yes. And then Gormogon killed the apprentice to make room for Zack.<eos> Killed him on the exact same night as the lobbyist, no less.<eos> Wait, hold on a second, your-your gray cells are getting me a little lost here. Well...<eos> in order to exonerate Dr. Addy, we need to find the previous apprentice and examine his body for whatever evidence it may yield up.<eos> The previous apprentice?<eos> Who was murdered and disposed of God knows where almost ten years ago.<eos> Well, unless you've got a better suggestion... I say let's start right away.
But... this is interesting.<eos> Take a look at his right hand.<eos> Gunshot residue.<eos> Which could mean he shot himself.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I also found torn ligaments in the wrist.<eos> So, likely, there was a struggle, and the killer turned the victim's own gun against him.<eos> Excellent work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can take the remains now.

Excellent work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can take the remains now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr. Fuentes, I can't help but notice that you're not wearing your new jacket.<eos> Did I get the wrong size?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, it's perfect.<eos> Thank you again for that.<eos> You don't think you're getting out of this room without an explanation, do you? Mm.
No, no, it's perfect.<eos> Thank you again for that.<eos> You don't think you're getting out of this room without an explanation, do you? Mm.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, there are very few jobs in the D.C. area for a forensic anthropologist.<eos> A fact that Arastoo reminds me of on a daily basis.<eos> Getting my doctorate means that it's time to move on.<eos> And wearing the jacket just makes it a little too real for me.<eos> And the fact that I'll soon have to leave all of you.<eos> I understand.<eos> But you're still coming to my wedding, right?
I'm hardly surprised, given the way they were driving during the getaway.<eos> Wait, what's a demolition derby?<eos> Oh! Oh!<eos> Oh, my dear, it's the absolute pinnacle of American culture.<eos> You get these old junk-boxes slamming and smashing into each other, bursting into flames, until there's only one vehicle left standing.<eos> See?<eos> Bam!<eos> That is absolutely barbaric. Okay, come on.<eos> Aubrey says there's one this weekend.<eos> What do you say, you want to tag along with me, Doc?

Okay, come on.<eos> Aubrey says there's one this weekend.<eos> What do you say, you want to tag along with me, Doc?<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Hmm? Why don't you both go undercover and compete?
Okay.<eos> I'll get over it. I have no interest in those childish antics.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll just go by myself.<eos> I didn't think you'd want to drive one of those cars, anyway.<eos> Why? Because I'm a woman?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, no.<eos> On second thought, I order you both to participate.<eos> On the one hand, you'll get a better handle on who Dustin's accomplice was if you're on the inside, and on the other hand, I think the aggression of the derby will be rather therapeutic for you, Dr. Brennan.
There, right there.<eos> That car there.<eos> "Filthy Rich." Well, that's a stretch, BOOTH:<eos> Yeah. but I imagine a bank robber could name a car that.<eos> Oh, no. Look at the body, all right?<eos> That's from a '77 Coupe de Ville and the bumper and the-the doors - are from a '73 Chevy Caprice.<eos> - The two models that the accomplice's car was comprised of.<eos> I think we should go find that driver.<eos> Be advised, the race will be starting in five minutes. Now, to locate the apprentice's body, what we need to do first is to get inside the mind of Gormogon himself.<eos> You're gonna get into the mind of a cannibal while eating?
Get your food off my car. Ooh.<eos> Nice set of tools, too.<eos> There blood on that wrench?<eos> Bro, I don't know who the hell you think you are, but if you don't pick that up, there's gonna be a hell of a lot more blood on this wrench.<eos> Put it down.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> You got a dent in your car.<eos> More bad news, you're under arrest, pal.<eos> All right, Ray.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?
Put it down.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> You got a dent in your car.<eos> More bad news, you're under arrest, pal.<eos> All right, Ray.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?<eos> I need to ask you a few questions.<eos> No, man.<eos> This ain't right.<eos> You didn't tell me you were FBI.
More bad news, you're under arrest, pal.<eos> All right, Ray.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?<eos> I need to ask you a few questions.<eos> No, man.<eos> This ain't right.<eos> You didn't tell me you were FBI.<eos> So what, you're saying it's okay to swing a wrench at a guy, as long as he's not in the bureau?<eos> You mean like you did with Dustin Doyle.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, Ray.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?<eos> I need to ask you a few questions.<eos> No, man.<eos> This ain't right.<eos> You didn't tell me you were FBI.<eos> So what, you're saying it's okay to swing a wrench at a guy, as long as he's not in the bureau?<eos> You mean like you did with Dustin Doyle.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You know what I think?
So what, you're saying it's okay to swing a wrench at a guy, as long as he's not in the bureau?<eos> You mean like you did with Dustin Doyle.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think that something went wrong at your last heist.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Heist?<eos> - I don't even know what that is.<eos> - Come on. You don't know what a heist is?

You don't know what a heist is?<eos> It's like a robbery.<eos> - You know what a robbery is, right? - Yes.
It's like a robbery.<eos> - You know what a robbery is, right? - Yes.<eos> I mean... not firsthand or nothing.<eos> Look.<eos> This is just a big misunderstanding, okay?<eos> I mean, maybe I hit Dustin, but if he's saying that I heisted a bank...<eos> No. Dustin isn't saying anything, Ray.<eos> Dustin's dead.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I think you're trying to trick me.

Ray, I could trick you by pretend throwing a ball and palming it in my hand.<eos> Now, you didn't know that Dustin was dead, did you?<eos> You're scared.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> But I'm not saying another word.<eos> Not until I speak with a lawyer.<eos> Damn it.<eos> We have been at this all day.<eos> We've got absolutely nothing.<eos> If you don't watch your anger, Dr. Hodgins, I have a good mind to send you off to the demolition derby, too.

All right, look, my gut is telling me that we can still find this guy, that he's out here, all right?<eos> So Gordon Gordon says it's good for you, too.<eos> Booth.<eos> What?<eos> Demolition derby's not therapy.<eos> It is idiotic and... and dangerous!<eos> Especially when you have a hurt back.<eos> Look, my back's fine.<eos> All right?<eos> Look, and these... these cars are built to protect you, all right?
That's because the architect of D.C., Pierre L'Enfant, was a Freemason, and the rhombus is a key symbol. Excuse me.<eos> Oh, Agent Aubrey.<eos> Look, I hope this isn't a food-related matter, because, uh, it's not a good time.<eos> I'm busy looking for trees. - What?<eos> - Acacia trees.<eos> Angie's plotting all the acacia trees in D.C.<eos> in case the apprentice is buried underneath.<eos> Well, that's great, but believe it or not, that's not what I was calling about.<eos> Uh, listen, Doc, I need your help breaking a suspect.<eos> Booth says that you got wicked, Jedi-like ninja powers or something?

No.<eos> He's an idiot, but there's no way that he's gonna talk.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if you'd give me a moment to think, yeah?
Well, if you'd give me a moment to think, yeah?<eos> Well, do it fast, 'cause this derby's about to start, and my guess is, by the time it's over the second accomplice is gonna be as good as gone.<eos> Angie, would you do me a favor and focus on the western side of the old map?<eos> Okay.<eos> Why? Well, the Freemasons, the west, with the setting sun represented finished projects and death.<eos> Um, Agent Aubrey,<eos> I think I have a solution for you-- you should let the idiot go free.<eos> What?<eos> No. At minimum, the guy's an accessory.<eos> Which is why you should keep him in your sight, but first let him lead you to his partner in crime.
And the bank manager said that $60,000 was taken.<eos> Which is why they roughed up Dustin-- 'cause they thought he was holding out.<eos> Then what?<eos> Just... let him go?<eos> Dr. Fuentes.<eos> Dr. Brennan... that is an interesting wardrobe you have on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your new lab coat looks very nice as well.<eos> Oh, thank you. You...<eos> Now show me you are worthy of your new title.
Now I think I know why.<eos> Is that the, uh, victim's car? Yeah.<eos> Looks like he came back to the bank the following day.<eos> That's a hell of a risk.<eos> Yeah. And then, look-- he follows that other car out.<eos> Wait, can you get the license plate on that other car?<eos> I've got the feeling I know why he came back.<eos> Ms. Fisher, we had a team go through your car, and we found some blood caked in the trunk.<eos> There, see?<eos> You don't understand, this isn't my fault.

- bam, boom, and she was back!<eos> - I was not back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wanda, on the other hand, might have been back.<eos> Wanda?<eos> Wanda's back.<eos> Oh, that's your-your nom de guerre, is it?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I have to thank you.<eos> You were correct-- the derby was just what I needed.
Yes.<eos> And I have to thank you.<eos> You were correct-- the derby was just what I needed.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear it.<eos> You see, I think it's very therapeutic every now and then, to-to get out of your proverbial skin, yeah?<eos> Right.<eos> What about you, huh?<eos> Thinking about, I don't know, hanging up the apron there and coming back to the bureau and, uh, shrinking it up a bit?<eos> Agent Booth, I must admit that, uh, over the last few days, I... I have had a few moments where I really, really enjoyed myself, but the fact is, I failed in my assigned task.<eos> No, no, you didn't fail.

Is everything all right?<eos> What's going on, Bones?<eos> Cam, I'm putting you on speaker.<eos> Is that her?<eos> Dr. Brennan, you're on with Hodgins.<eos> Dr. Brennan, want to make sure you know that Cam is right here next to me-- I don't want there to be any chance you think I've falsified evidence.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He found the apprentice.<eos> Uh, Dr. Hodgins, it's Chef G... it's, uh, Dr. Gordon Wyatt here.<eos> A-Are you sure that it's him?
The Mikaelson compound.<eos> Midnight.<eos> _<eos> All right, ladies, do not slow down on me.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I'm getting the next round.<eos> Just take a sec, pull yourselves together.<eos> Another round, please.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Beer, please. You look like you're having fun.
As a member of the queen's guard, command of the army has fallen to me until the king awakens.<eos> If he awakens.<eos> Until a new Commander can ascend, Polis is to be ruled by ambassadors of the coalition.<eos> If Azgeda wants it, they must take it by force.<eos> Consider it taken.<eos> No Skaikru leaves this city.<eos> Looks like saving the world will have to wait.<eos> That's it.<eos> Let me help you, please.<eos> It's good to see you're making friends.
It's different now.<eos> They owe me, ok? Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Ok?<eos> Ok.<eos> We can still pick up a few things first, right?<eos> Sir, that's everyone we could find.<eos> Stationed 10 guards at the temple door.<eos> Are you sure you don't want me to stay?

Bulimia nervosa.<eos> Although, more nervosa than bulimia now.<eos> That's Kendra.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Welcome to Threshold. I'll, uh...<eos> I'll go get Lobo.<eos> Lobo!<eos> This is... very nice, homey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, hi, are you Lobo?
Like "mucus."<eos> But I prefer "Luke." Lobo is a dame.<eos> - A dame?<eos> - A broad, a skirt.<eos> Raymond Chandler is my muse since I got here.<eos> To the hardscrabbled streets of LA, that is.<eos> - I'm from London, originally.<eos> - London?<eos> How interesting.<eos> Did you come all this way for Dr. Beckham?
You... You look like a ghost.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Why?<eos> Mom, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> My God.<eos> - No dad?<eos> - I'm sorry, work.<eos> Well, he has to support his family... and pay alimony, still, and the medical bills and...<eos> Understood.<eos> Bet you didn't expect this much "gynergy" today.
- Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> - I'm not crazy about your name.<eos> - What?<eos> "Ellen" doesn't suit you.<eos> It's too old-fashioned.<eos> - I've never really liked it.<eos> - So, change it.<eos> I can't just change it.<eos> I can't, right?<eos> Just tell people to call you by a different name.
What I'm trying to say is, why does she get to leave the house when she's only level two?<eos> - It was Luke's night out.<eos> - Yeah, but Ellen got to go.<eos> It's "Eli" now.<eos> It might make you feel better to know that Dr. Beck scheduled a special trip for you guys in a couple of days.<eos> - Tell me it's not the Holocaust Museum.<eos> - No. My mother took me there to make me feel shitty, you know, about starving.<eos> It's okay. We're Jewish.<eos> Damn, Dr. Beck.<eos> Are you trying to turn me straight?
- It's okay, I promise.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Art.<eos> Somebody tell me why we're here!<eos> Because we're alive.<eos> Very good.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You're shaking like a chihuahua.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.
That baby was never gonna make it.<eos> - Where is Luke, anyway?<eos> - He's at the doctor for his knee.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.

I like it that way.<eos> Women generally wanna spend time with somebody they date.<eos> Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy, doctor.
That would be easier, right?<eos> Then you could write him off.<eos> - Does he talk to you about me?<eos> - You know I can't answer that.<eos> - I just don't see the point.<eos> - In what?<eos> There is no point.<eos> Or at least, big picture, we don't get to know what it is.<eos> Why we live, why Megan lost the baby, why that girl killed herself.<eos> - You're not reassuring me, doctor.
- In what?<eos> There is no point.<eos> Or at least, big picture, we don't get to know what it is.<eos> Why we live, why Megan lost the baby, why that girl killed herself.<eos> - You're not reassuring me, doctor.<eos> - I can't reassure you.<eos> This idea you have that there's a way to be safe... it's childish and cowardly.<eos> It stops you from experiencing anything, including anything good.<eos> You don't think I feel bad enough already?<eos> I know I'm messed up... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be.
I thought this was new information, but, many of these studies have been around for 50 years.<eos> I couldn't believe I'd been eating processed meats virtually my entire life and was just now finding out how dangerous they are.<eos> Why hadn't I been hearing about it from the American Cancer Society, the largest cancer group in the nation?<eos> When I went on their website, I was shocked to see that none of this information was featured on their home page.<eos> But, even more shocking, on their Eat Healthy page, they actually encouraged eating Group One carcinogenic foods like processed turkey and canned meats.<eos> This is after the World Health Organization reviewed over 800 studies definitively linking processed meat to cancer.<eos> Thanks for calling your American Cancer Society. My name is Sam,<eos> I'm a cancer information specialist.<eos> How may I help you today?<eos> Yeah, I was calling because I was wondering why you all recommend people to eat processed meat on your website, which the World Health Organization has classified as a Group One carcinogen?

And that's the part that leads to the diabetes, it's the fatty foods, not really so much the sugar.<eos> It's not that sugar's good for you.<eos> There's no nutrients in it.<eos> It's excess calories.<eos> But, when you eat sugar, you don't get inflammation right away.<eos> When you eat sugar, you're not getting plaques forming in your vessels.<eos> When you're eating sugar, your body's gonna store most of it as glycogen or burn it as calories.<eos> And so this focus on sugar has taken all the focus off meat, dairy, eggs, pork, turkey, chicken.<eos> People need to understand.<eos> If they're child gets diabetes, you've just taken 19 years off their lifespan.
PCBs have been banned since the 70s, but, they persist in the environment, dioxins.<eos> All of these compounds can create hormonal, reproductive, developmental damage as well.<eos> Eating organic beef, poultry, pork or fish will not help you avoid contaminants like mercury, like dioxins, like strontium-90 because they fall out over all sorts of farm fields and water bodies, and then they don't skip over the organic fields.<eos> And so really, the contaminants are coming in regardless of how these animals are raised.<eos> I had always been concerned about the possible health impacts of GMOs but, then found out that most of the world's GMO crops are actually consumed by livestock, with dairy cows consuming the most per animal.<eos> This fact, with everything I learned about bioaccumulation made dairy terrifying.<eos> Especially considering how much cheese I ate in my life.<eos> Cheese is an amazing product when you think about it.<eos> It's probably one of the single best foods in compromising health that you're gonna actually feed to people.<eos> Think about it, you've got an animal product.
So, we need to reduce the growth factors in our body, like IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor one, it's this cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in every stage of cancer cell growth and spread and metastases.<eos> Any animal protein boosts the level of IGF-1.<eos> Dairy products increases your risk for various forms of cancer, especially those related to your hormones.<eos> So, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer.<eos> So, this is not a product even in its most pure state you wanna be consuming because it does come with risk.<eos> I found out that dairy can increase a man's chance of getting prostate cancer by 34%.<eos> And for women who've had breast cancer, just one serving of whole dairy a day can increase their chance of dying from the disease 49% and dying from anything 64%.<eos> Why weren't breast cancer sites like Susan G. Komen warning everyone about this?<eos> Thanks for calling Susan G. Komen, this is Jocelyn, how may I help you?<eos> Yes, so we're wondering why you don't have a huge warning about the dangers of consuming dairy on your website when there's a direct link to breast cancer.
In the animal agriculture industry, as in the tobacco industry, these companies really have a vested interest in making sure that the public doesn't have information about their effects and what risks are really posed to consuming them.<eos> You have this system where animals are living in their own waste, they're living next to animals that are sick or, even dead, and they're stuck in cages with these animals, that bacteria tends to spread, that the pathogens that are being created<eos> in these filthy conditions are breeding resistance to antibiotics and the public are becoming exposed to those.<eos> We already have people dying.<eos> From salmonella and other things that you eat, we have about 3,000 people die every year in the United States.<eos> That's more than the number of people that were killed in 9/11 in the Twin Towers in New York.<eos> If we had some terrorist organization killing 3,000 people a year, we would be all over it.<eos> The antibiotic-resistant bacteria deaths that we have on top of that, you get 20,000 people dying a year.<eos> That's seven 9/11s every year.<eos> Can you imagine?
Can you imagine?<eos> If that many people were being killed by some terrorist group in the United States every year, we would find them!<eos> You know, the World Health Organization has said we're nearing a post-antibiotic era in medicine.<eos> You'll be at risk in minor surgeries o have a fatal infection.<eos> You'll be at risk going to the dentist if you have a tooth extracted.<eos> Or, it'll be like civil war medicine.<eos> You get an infection in your leg, and you cut your leg off.<eos> So, you have this very dangerous situation.<eos> By crowding these animals in, they become a perfect engine for generating a new flu virus that can come out into the community.<eos> If you lived near a swine spray field, not even the CAFO but the waste disposal field, you are three times more likely to have a MRSA infection.
My nephew down the street, he's got cancer, he's in terminal cancer, stage four.<eos> Not a smoker, not a drinker.<eos> And it's not in his lungs, it's in his lymph nodes.<eos> Now see if you live here and saw the way they do, we don't eat no pork.<eos> Well, I don't eat bacon because I know where it come from.<eos> When they die, they go into a box, and they decompose because they swell from the heat.<eos> A truck come and pick 'em up, take 'em to the processing plant in Rose Hill, ground 'em up into feed, and feed it back to the hogs.<eos> If I come out this door, if he's spraying there, it's gonna come in my face.<eos> It hits you right in the face.<eos> Smell like something that you have never smelled before.
Yeah, they spray.<eos> And when the people come, everybody be closing their nose up saying how it stink.<eos> They can want a cookout on Sunday, he'll spray.<eos> Do you think he does it on purpose?<eos> I think so.<eos> 'Cause he just sprays Sunday.<eos> He always sprays Sunday.<eos> And in most of these area, hog houses and turkey house, it's in a black area or the Hispanic area.<eos> It's either or.<eos> Do you think it's also a civil rights issue?
How could they expect people not to get diabetes if this was the food they were recommending?<eos> And then, I saw multiple peer-reviewed studies published on the National Institute of Health website showing that a low-fat plant-based diet was more than twice as powerful at controlling and even reversing diabetes than the ADA recommended diet that included meat and dairy.<eos> The mission of the American Diabetes Association is to identify a prevention and a cure for diabetes.<eos> But, in the meantime, to improve the lives of all people who are affected by diabetes.<eos> And what's the best way to prevent this?<eos> For type two diabetes, it's unclear.<eos> We can't prevent type two diabetes in everybody.<eos> We were doing research, we came across a lot of studies that said that you actually could potentially cure or reverse diabetes with a purely plant-based diet.<eos> I don't believe there's sufficient evidence to demonstrate that.<eos> How does it compare to the ADA diet that you recommend?

But, if it's a diet that's not the proper diet, like if anyone follows a diet that they eat McDonald's...<eos> I can't tell you what a proper diet is.<eos> I can tell you what an improper diet is.<eos> So, then we can talk about the good diets.<eos> I'm not sure why...<eos> I'm not gonna get into that.<eos> - Into diet?<eos> - No.<eos> Why not?<eos> If that's where you want to go with this, I'm sorry, I'm not the person that you should be talking to.

I'm not gonna get into the argument with you.<eos> Why is it in argument?<eos> It's just to talking about in European study of diabetes and other places that have studies, why...<eos> There are lots of studies...<eos> Why is it even an argument, I guess?<eos> There are lots of studies in the literature.<eos> Many of which have never been replicated or frankly, are wrong.<eos> That's why we do peer review, okay?<eos> The European Association of Study of Diabetes has been peer-reviewed or, the...<eos> I don't know what study you're referring to, and in the absence of being able to see that study,
Every single one of these organizations was taking money from meat and dairy companies that are associated with the causes of these diseases.<eos> This would be like the American Lung Association taking money from the tobacco industry.<eos> I was sick of not getting answers.<eos> So, I went to the headquarters of these organizations myself.<eos> We have to speak to someone in person.<eos> There's millions of people dying from the foods that they are recommending people to eat.<eos> I wanted to find out why Susan G. Komen had accepted $35 million from Yoplait, when their products can increase a woman's chance of dying from breast cancer 49%, and ask American Cancer Society if taking money from KFC and Tyson was a reason they promote eating meat.<eos> But, every one of these organizations declined to be interviewed.<eos> What's really sad is that we cannot trust information from these leading health organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association because they are taking money from the very industries who are causing the problems that they're supposed to be helping to prevent.<eos> So, that makes the truth something that you are not gonna be hearing, as far as nutrition goes, from these organizations.
Well, that would be the end of their funding, that would be the end of their jobs, there would be lawsuits that would bring the entire catastrophe down upon their heads, and they would essentially disappear as organizations.<eos> This one time I got invited to a charity fundraiser for the American Diabetes Association.<eos> I showed up, and they had a whole buffet, and it was all just animal products.<eos> I remember like a big thing of barbecue chicken.<eos> And I was like, I stormed out.<eos> I said like, serving chicken at a diabetes event is like serving alcohol at an AA meeting.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> We had scheduled to film an interview with a prominent surgeon.<eos> But, before we could get inside the building, the hospital's media relations manager stopped us.<eos> Actually I understand that Dr... said that you could film here today, but, unfortunately, that's not gonna be able to happen.

The committee who writes these guidelines has been made up of individuals who have received money from McDonald's, the National Dairy Council, the American Meat Institute, the National Dairy Board, the National Livestock and Meat Board, the American Egg Board, Dannon,<eos> candy and sugar companies, Coca Cola and Anheuser, just to name a few.<eos> Which means we are getting our dietary recommendations from the very industries that are killing us.<eos> And when they, the USDA, makes a pyramid or a Power Plate every five years for the American public, they're gonna guarantee that on that plate are gonna be foods, which when consumed, will result in millions of Americans perishing.<eos> The USDA, which is supposed to be protecting us, has two missions.<eos> It's supposed to protect us, and it's supposed to protect the producer.<eos> And guess what, when those two come head to head, they usually choose the producer.<eos> In internal documents uncovered by Dr. Greger, the USDA admitted that eggs cannot legally be called nutritious, low fat, part of a balanced diet, low calorie, healthful, healthy, can't say it's good for you or, even safe.<eos> Yet they still promote these products to the American people through federal checkoff programs.<eos> If you ask somebody if they have heard of a checkoff program, the odds are they haven't, although daily, they are seeing the messaging that these programs produce.

And this is the USDA, this is the government.<eos> If you've seen those ads for the Pizza Hut pizza, the stuffed crust or a pound of cheese.
I have to use this for my prostrate.<eos> And then I have to use this for the heart.<eos> And I have to use this for blood pressure.<eos> And it's just on and on and on.<eos> The doctors are telling me this is what I gotta do for my whole life.<eos> And it's frustrating and very stressful.<eos> And I don't know how long my liver is gonna last taking all this stuff.<eos> Under conventional medical treatment, whether it be for autoimmune disease or even conditions like high blood pressure or, diabetes, you're told that you have to take drugs.<eos> And not just for a week or a month or, a year, you're told you have to take drugs forever.<eos> You're guaranteed that if you follow your doctor's advice, you'll be sick forever.

They're behind walls, they're underground.<eos> They're in these secret facilities that no one knows about, but if they did, they would be shocked and outraged.<eos> And I think people would not want to think that their pharmaceuticals, that their food are coming from these places.<eos> And that's why I think it's such, the ag-gag laws are what they are is because they are trying to silence people into not speaking out and not showing the truth.<eos> I finally realized how deep the collusion truly is between government and these industries.<eos> And how dangerous it could be to expose them.<eos> These concerns intensified after meeting the USDA whistle-blowerrrr who revealed mad cow disease in the US meat supply.<eos> USDA operates like the military.<eos> So, when I got on TV and that right away, USDA sent out memos to all the veterinarians and food inspectors,<eos> "If anybody from the media ever contacts you, do not talk to them.

You could see there's a bump or some kind of abscess underneath the hide.<eos> Most of the time when the hide's pulled off, either that will open up the abscess and the the pus will come out, or if it's deep-seated, when the inspectors are doing their work or the company employees, they might stick their knife into an abscess, and it explodes all over the place.<eos> I had heard enough.<eos> I was utterly disgusted by the corruption, the greed, the disease and the abuse I was learning about.<eos> The very animals we were killing were killing us and the planet.<eos> But, so many people eat meat and dairy every day of their lives.<eos> And we are so concerned about getting enough protein.<eos> Do we have to eat meat to get complete protein?<eos> Oh, my God, oh my God.<eos> You want me to jump off this building, don't you now?
Do we have to eat meat to get complete protein?<eos> Oh, my God, oh my God.<eos> You want me to jump off this building, don't you now?<eos> Well first of all, all protein is made by plants.<eos> I'll state that again for the record.<eos> All protein is initially made by plants, all of it.<eos> And it is not necessary to eat animal tissue in order to get protein.<eos> Only plants have the ability to actually take nitrogen from the air, break those molecules apart and incorporate that nitrogen into amino acids and then make protein.<eos> Any protein you get from an animal is simply recycled plant protein.<eos> If you ate a diet that was calorically adequate and even things like brown rice and broccoli and you got enough of it, you'd get enough, both quantity and quality of protein.

Those are so amazing to see you like this only a few weeks later.<eos> I know!<eos> From going from the walker, needing wheelchair assistance at the airport to strolling down the street, enjoying the fresh air, the sunshine.<eos> Two weeks, it's all it took, two weeks to get off all the meds and start to feel the inflammation just kind of drain out of the body where the movement was much easier.<eos> Just a lot of healing occurred very rapidly just by doing the right things for your body.<eos> When you're treating diseases with drugs, you know there's one drug you take for cholesterol, a different class of drugs you take for high blood pressure, different class of drugs you take for diabetes, but, with diet, a plant-based diet affects all these diseases.<eos> One diet to kinda rule them all.<eos> The impacts of eating this way go far beyond ourselves.<eos> By getting rid of heart disease alone, we would save up to $48 trillion in the USA, three times the US GDP.<eos> Conditions like high blood pressure, you don't have to take the drugs the rest of your life and be sick forever.

Ironically, when patients come to doctors with questions, they assume that the doctor knows something about nutrition and so it's kind of a double whammy that doctors haven't been taught much about nutrition.<eos> Why don't we hear about this from dietitians when nutrition is their entire specialty?<eos> Turns out the American Nutrition and Dietetics Association puts out nutrition fact sheets written by the industries themselves.<eos> The industries pay $20,000 per fact sheet and explicitly take part in writing them.<eos> So, you can learn about eggs from the egg industry.<eos> You can learn about lamb from the lamb industry.<eos> This would be like learning about the benefits of smoking from the tobacco industry.<eos> When people are eating meat, I think of it as a bit like smoking.<eos> It's sort of Russian roulette.<eos> You may not get diabetes, but your chances of getting diabetes, about one in three.

I came to TrueNorth to help me with my asthma and to lose a little weight, and it's amazing just in two weeks of changing my diet, don't have to take any asthma medication, no antidepressants, no pain medication,<eos> no heart medication, nothing. No medications at all.<eos> And it's really, it's just incredible.<eos> I was taking oxy and Advil, and I was taking 800 milligrams of Motrin three times a day just to get through the day because I was in so much pain.<eos> - And now, nothing.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Nothing at all.<eos> - Two weeks.<eos> Two weeks, 14 days.<eos> All that medication, you're completely off.
I'm a professional parkour athlete, a two-time world free running champion, and more recently I got into Ninja Warrior where I'm captain of Team Europe as we won USA versus the world.<eos> For something like Ninja Warrior and parkour, specifically, you really need to have a good strength to body weight ratio, so I was carrying mass that I really didn't need.<eos> And when I went vegan, I lost 15, 20 pounds.<eos> I was more agile, I was more efficient and more stamina in my body.<eos> Just that extra bit of pop that I didn't have before, it just gave me that extra strength.<eos> This is a vibrant way to live.<eos> It can enhance you as an athlete, for me, a hundred percent better athlete than I was before, it's unlocked a whole new chapter of my training.<eos> The science is there, the health is there, the athletes are there proving that you don't need to eat dead animals to be strong, to be healthy.<eos> I started working out when I was 47 years old.<eos> All the muscles you see, I gained as a vegan.
I felt amazing.<eos> I competed in my first marathon in six years, training half the amount and beat my personal record by 23 minutes.<eos> Less than a month later, I did my first full Ironman.<eos> Although I could possibly get away with eating a little bit of meat and dairy without ill effects to my personal health, I could no longer willingly support an industry I knew was causing so much suffering to communities, families and all life on the planet.<eos> A whole new world opened up.<eos> I felt whole again.<eos> Connected to a greater sense of what true health is.<eos> And where true health doesn't end with me, but begins with us.<eos> If people adopted a plant-based diet, the changes we would see in our individual health, in our national health situation and in this physical, environmental world we live in, would be so profound.<eos> Today, you can say, I'm not gonna eat that stuff anymore.

Otto.<eos> - Otto.<eos> - Audrey.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> No.<eos> I'm in trouble.<eos> What?<eos> This employment agency.<eos> What job you looking for?
Marty Joseph.<eos> Long time. Yeah, I've been playing out on the Left Coast.<eos> I'm not too crazy about their politics, but I like the color of their money.<eos> Last month I took 10 grand off of Matt Damon.<eos> I kicked Jason Bourne's ass.<eos> Funny.<eos> [laughing] I don't believe I've had the pleasure.<eos> Marty Joseph, this is Raj Kumar Mukherjee. Ah, I know that name.<eos> Yeah, I hear you're a real hitter.<eos> And I understand you sell cars.

I would love to be wrong.<eos> [cough] But I don't think that I am.<eos> There's one way to find out for sure.<eos> So...<eos> I had this game.<eos> - It's mine... tight. - [Karolina gasping]<eos> You had no chance of winning this hand, no chance... well, one.
[whisper] I'm going to kill you last so you can watch your brother die.<eos> But first, I'm going to deal with that asshole.<eos> Oh, I've been waiting to put a bullet in your fucking head - for a long time. - Vince, I swear to God.<eos> - I don't...<eos> I swear... - Put the gun down! Hey!<eos> I'm... I'm FBI. Okay?<eos> This man is a federal witness under my protection. I just sent a distress code to the FBI field office.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> My head is spinning right now.<eos> Marius, is this... is this part of the plan, or are you just making this shit up as you go along?
For all the fucked-up things I've done in my life, whoo! That takes the cake.<eos> - Nurse is here. - Marjorie: He's not a nurse.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> This was about revenge.<eos> But revenge... revenge is so much sweeter with this. Wow. It was a barometric safe.<eos> I know.<eos> They're a bitch.<eos> Looked into freezing it with liquid nitrogen. I looked into drilling and filling it with water, doing a concussion.<eos> Ah, I had a hard time finding this place.<eos> You need to go down and show everyone how to get up here.
You got a great memory, Chuck.<eos> That red bill and everything. What was the name of that little girl that lived, uh, three houses up from us?<eos> - She had, like, a pageboy haircut. - Jimmy.<eos> And she was always in the dirt, always dirty.<eos> - Jimmy!<eos> Jimmy! - I liked her.<eos> She was always...<eos> Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.<eos> And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.

I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> Oh.<eos> And mention my lily pond.<eos> It's in my garden.<eos> Lily pond.<eos> Okay, ladies.<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient.<eos> And, Mrs. Aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me... anything at all... you can call me day or night.
Yeah.<eos> Just tell him to pull up to the gate and honk.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> They're on their way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You sell a gas cap for an '87 Caprice wagon?<eos> Should.<eos> GM caps should be in the blue on the bottom there.<eos> Now, you're sure I can't help you carry those to your car, Mrs. VanKamp?

Ohh!

Ohh!<eos> - Roses. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Petunias, orchids.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - They don't smell, you know?
It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.<eos> I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.<eos> Captain, please. Why don't...<eos> Sit down.<eos> Take a load off. Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink?<eos> And your so-called war hero, "Fudge" Talbott?<eos> No such person... never was.<eos> Granted, some artistic license may have been taken.<eos> You entered government property under false pretenses, sir. Whoa, whoa.
- Huh?<eos> B-29.<eos> FIFI's a B-29.<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?<eos> - You don't like the commercial.<eos> - No, no, I don't, but this has nothing to do with the comm...<eos> Well, constructive criticism is always welcome. - But I didn't...<eos> - But you should realize that most people find it uplifting...<eos> - ... patriotic, even. - No.<eos> - You check your recruiting numbers. - I-I-I...

Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...<eos> Here.<eos> A plane ticket home.<eos> Your friends aren't your family, Micky.<eos> I remember you showing up messed up the night of the bonfire.

That would be weird, right?<eos> Uh, totally.<eos> Just tell her I have a meeting.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Congratulations on the internship.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Keating.<eos> Keating.<eos> You're getting out of here.
Keating.<eos> You're getting out of here.<eos> I'm being released?<eos> No, we're transferring you to county till your bail hearing.<eos> Up and at 'em.<eos> Tilt your head forward.<eos> I'm gonna search your hair.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> These are yours and yours alone to take care of.<eos> If you lose or destroy any property in your cell, you will receive a fine.

Hi.<eos> Everyone's in the waiting area.<eos> They want to see you, but the doctors would only let me in.<eos> I told them I was your lawyer.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wes died before the fire.<eos> The M.E. told me.<eos> Did you see anything before the explosion?<eos> Mm.<eos> I know you're in pain, but the detectives will be here soon.
Did you see anything before the explosion?<eos> Mm.<eos> I know you're in pain, but the detectives will be here soon.<eos> Good.<eos> I want to tell them who did it.<eos> - Frank.<eos> - No.<eos> Where is he, then?<eos> I want to ask him to his face.<eos> You know he would never hurt any of us.
Good.<eos> I want to tell them who did it.<eos> - Frank.<eos> - No.<eos> Where is he, then?<eos> I want to ask him to his face.<eos> You know he would never hurt any of us.<eos> Of course he would.<eos> Leave.<eos> If you tell the police, it will hurt all of us.
Can we see her?<eos> The doctor said she's too weak.<eos> Does she remember anything?<eos> No.<eos> She's in shock.<eos> I'll call Meggy, see if she can get us in.<eos> Don't.<eos> She needs to be with people right now.<eos> She needs sleep.<eos> Or you just don't want us to see her.

And this is not the place to talk about it.<eos> Go home.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> I will call you once I know anything.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To see Annalise.<eos> Just... tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> You should come back with us.
No.<eos> You should come back with us.<eos> I think I'm just gonna go home.<eos> Ol, it's not healthy to be alone right now.<eos> No, I...<eos> Actually, I think that's exactly what I need, so...<eos> Laurel thinks it was you.<eos> - And what do you think?<eos> - Just answer me.<eos> You think I'd do this to Annalise?
Actually, I think that's exactly what I need, so...<eos> Laurel thinks it was you.<eos> - And what do you think?<eos> - Just answer me.<eos> You think I'd do this to Annalise?<eos> After everything?<eos> I don't know what to think anymore.<eos> We know who did this.<eos> It's the Mahoneys.<eos> They must have found out Wes is Wallace's son, that you knew him.
Doesn't matter who did it.<eos> Only person locked up is me.<eos> Your ball hearing is tomorrow at 2:00.<eos> I called Helen Hughes.<eos> She wants the case.<eos> Eve would be a conflict of interest.<eos> Everyone's a conflict of interest.<eos> You have to do this.<eos> No.<eos> I will find someone you trust.

Come on.<eos> That was funny.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> - I thought it was.<eos> - It wasn't.<eos> Hey.<eos> Those detectives are here.<eos> Could these drugs hurt the baby?<eos> No.<eos> They have you on Dilaudid because it's safe for pregnancy.
No.<eos> They have you on Dilaudid because it's safe for pregnancy.<eos> Send them in.<eos> I walked in, I didn't see anyone, so I looked in the kitchen.<eos> That's when I saw that the basement door was open, so I went down there.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Um...<eos> I just heard a... mm...<eos> A noise coming from upstairs, and then I woke up here.<eos> When Professor Keating called you, did she say why she wanted you at the house?

You're trying to charge her with my attempted murder, right?<eos> Annalise didn't do this.<eos> Because you know who did?<eos> Well, that's your job to figure out.<eos> It's got to be Frank's, right?<eos> He's only been back a week.<eos> Yeah, well, it only takes one orgasm to make a baby.<eos> Can we please stop talking about this, especially in front of my mom?<eos> Why?<eos> You afraid she's gonna want to adopt it?
Yeah, but that was before she knew anyone was dead.<eos> She knew.<eos> She's probably at the airport.<eos> I-I can go grab her.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't care.<eos> Look, anyone would be upset by this.<eos> I'm upset because our friend is dead, not because of that terrible woman.<eos> Did you really just call Waitlist your friend?<eos> 'Cause I kind of recall you hating him before he became barbecue.

No.<eos> Well, Nate, I'm sorry, but we're gonna need to reassess your position here.<eos> You tell him about us?<eos> - Nate.<eos> - That's a no.<eos> We've been sleeping together.<eos> I imagine any demotion might be construed as sexual harassment.<eos> Grabbing a woman's ass is never okay.<eos> I thought you were my girlfriend.<eos> That's the best excuse you could come up with, Baby Trump?

That's not what I meant.<eos> So you're a racist and a pervert.<eos> H-How does that make me a racist?<eos> I-I can understand a pervert, sure, but...<eos> Wes. Wes!<eos> This is my friend Wes.<eos> He'll tell you.<eos> Doesn't she look exactly like Michaela?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're just making this worse!

You think that was racist, don't you?<eos> I just think you're white.<eos> Please don't tell Michaela.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I just need sleep.<eos> I told you I want to be alone.<eos> I know.<eos> I just didn't know if you really meant that.
How you doing?<eos> I just need sleep.<eos> I told you I want to be alone.<eos> I know.<eos> I just didn't know if you really meant that.<eos> What's going on, Oli?<eos> Annalise asked me to delete everything on her phone last night... before I knew Wes was dead.<eos> - That means she did this, right?<eos> - No.<eos> You told Bonnie you thought she did it.
Annalise asked me to delete everything on her phone last night... before I knew Wes was dead.<eos> - That means she did this, right?<eos> - No.<eos> You told Bonnie you thought she did it.<eos> Yeah, I was wrong.<eos> She's being framed.<eos> Or maybe you're lying to me the same way you lied about the night of the bonfire.<eos> Sam Keating went missing that night.<eos> His remains were found a few weeks later.<eos> Did you all do that?
- That means she did this, right?<eos> - No.<eos> You told Bonnie you thought she did it.<eos> Yeah, I was wrong.<eos> She's being framed.<eos> Or maybe you're lying to me the same way you lied about the night of the bonfire.<eos> Sam Keating went missing that night.<eos> His remains were found a few weeks later.<eos> Did you all do that?<eos> Do you really want to know?

- We don't even need to talk.<eos> - Connor, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um...<eos> I'll be at Michaela's.<eos> Thanks for seeing me.<eos> The autopsy report's not out yet.<eos> I know, but you must have heard something...<eos> I haven't.<eos> I can't be telling you when I do.
- Connor, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um...<eos> I'll be at Michaela's.<eos> Thanks for seeing me.<eos> The autopsy report's not out yet.<eos> I know, but you must have heard something...<eos> I haven't.<eos> I can't be telling you when I do.<eos> Why'd you go to her last night if you don't want to help?

You should go.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Visitor.<eos> - For who?<eos> Her.<eos> Your kids are here.<eos> Oh, finally!<eos> I won't look.<eos> Hey, you gave in!<eos> Now you got a visitor.
Your kids are here.<eos> Oh, finally!<eos> I won't look.<eos> Hey, you gave in!<eos> Now you got a visitor.<eos> Don't forget to wipe.<eos> I pushed the bail hearing a day.<eos> Why?<eos> They still haven't released the autopsy reports, which we need if we want to challenge a bail denial.<eos> Did you go to Nate?
I promise.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.<eos> Tell me you found something.<eos> Call log from the station last night...<eos> Every call made or received.<eos> Best I could do.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> She needs a real lawyer.<eos> What would Sam say right now?<eos> You're as good as Annalise.

Yeah, they were here.<eos> They wanted me to tell them it was Annalise.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Annalise wouldn't hurt Wes.<eos> She would if he was gonna turn her in.<eos> - She probably had Frank do it.<eos> - Connor.<eos> And you're just protecting Frank 'cause the baby's his, right?
- She probably had Frank do it.<eos> - Connor.<eos> And you're just protecting Frank 'cause the baby's his, right?<eos> Shut your mouth right now.<eos> Annalise wouldn't do this.<eos> Then why did she have Oliver delete everything from her phone?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She told him to clear her phone before he knew that Wes was dead.<eos> And now he might go to the police.<eos> You have to stop him.

Wes is dead, and you're not upset at all!<eos> Who's the person who started all this?<eos> It's always been him.<eos> - Stop talking.<eos> - So, yeah.<eos> Maybe part of me is relieved that he's gone.<eos> - Connor!<eos> - He did kill someone, after all, so maybe this is just karma.<eos> The baby is Wes'.<eos> Well, you should just get an abortion now, 'cause Waitlist isn't the type of father you want for your child.
- Do it!<eos> Hit me!<eos> - Asher!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off of him!<eos> Asher, what is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> Waitlist!<eos> Aww.<eos> You look like a picture straight out of a Middleton brochure.

I'm kidding.<eos> I talked about Oliver the whole time.<eos> It's lame, I know.<eos> He just needs space.<eos> How do you know?<eos> He got really drunk at my birthday party the other night and told Meggy.<eos> We should let them go, right?<eos> Like, if we were at all good people, we'd want them to be free of us.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What did you do to him?
Like, if we were at all good people, we'd want them to be free of us.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> I-I assume there's a reason that he went all frat boy on you.<eos> I said something stupid.<eos> Grief makes people do stupid things.<eos> How are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't even look at you right now.<eos> Is that what you were like when you ran over Sinclair?

We're dealing with your mess right now, not mine.<eos> We're all a mess right now!<eos> That's the point!<eos> And maybe I'm supposed to hide that or pretend that I'm some unfeeling jerk,<eos> but...<eos> Wes is dead.<eos> That doesn't mean you get to act like an animal.<eos> Go home.<eos> What?<eos> I'm staying here with Laurel to make sure you didn't put her on suicide watch.
Brookline, Mass.<eos> Hannah Keating called the police at 10:30 that night.<eos> It was after the fire started.<eos> I don't know how she could have found out about it so soon unless she knew it was going to happen.<eos> Or she was working with the Mahoneys.<eos> It seems insane, I know, but she's always wanted the house, and she'd know that hurting Wes would hurt you.<eos> I called her.<eos> Automated voice-mail box for...<eos> Hannah Keating.<eos> You always hated my black ass living in your mommy and daddy's house.
You always hated my black ass living in your mommy and daddy's house.<eos> So take it, Hannah.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> Not like anything good happened to me since the minute I moved in here.<eos> That's not enough to incriminate you.<eos> She thinks I killed Sam, so she'll say whatever it takes to ruin me.<eos> She finally won.<eos> It just took me helping her.<eos> Shopping for Meggy?<eos> You feel bad you dumped her and think tacky jewelry will win her back?
Shopping for Meggy?<eos> You feel bad you dumped her and think tacky jewelry will win her back?<eos> No.<eos> Then who's it for?<eos> Do not say Annalise.<eos> No. God.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> The same reason you didn't want to tell us about Asher.
No.<eos> Then who's it for?<eos> Do not say Annalise.<eos> No. God.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> Why not?<eos> The same reason you didn't want to tell us about Asher.<eos> Because I was embarrassed of him.<eos> Which makes sense if you're Laurel in this situation, but you...

Mm.<eos> You're worried Frank's gonna find out.<eos> He'll kill you.<eos> You know that?<eos> We're happy.<eos> I just... don't want to ruin that.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - But I do not approve.<eos> You broke up with Meggy like five minutes ago, and now you're already buying jewelry for some other girl?

It doesn't matter.<eos> Please.<eos> I need to be distracted.<eos> Um...<eos> I kicked her out.<eos> It was before I knew what happened.<eos> Or I'm just a horrible person.<eos> You're not.<eos> I am.<eos> Whatever you need or decide,
Whatever you need or decide,<eos> I'm here for you, okay?<eos> Oh, press it.<eos> It's green.<eos> Automated voice-mail box for...<eos> Hannah Keating.<eos> So, take it, Hannah.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> No, no!<eos> You burned a boy in your house.

And I'm thinking,<eos> "Why can't this queen defend me?"<eos> Jacked up, ain't it?<eos> No matter how high or how far we climb, they gonna find a way to pull us back down.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> If I compel them to disclose Hannah as their source,<eos> I can undermine her testimony completely.<eos> She accused you of killing Sam.<eos> It all speaks to her bias against you.<eos> Tell me you think it's a good idea.
Your Honor, the State's evidence to support their allegations against my client is lacking, if not non-existent.<eos> We aren't arguing the facts of this case today, Your Honor.<eos> Any effort to deny my client bail must be based on credible evidence...<eos> But the State's case is based on an anonymous source.<eos> Objection.<eos> Speculative.<eos> My client was arrested before an autopsy of the victim could be conducted.<eos> There's an independent basis for probable cause.<eos> It's our right to ask that the source be identified to know whether there's any warrant to this case.<eos> Mr. Denver, may I ask why you don't want to reveal this source?

We are bad people.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Look, I don't even care that Wes is dead.<eos> I don't.<eos> Honestly, I do...<eos> I feel nothing.<eos> I'm just broken and sick, and I need all of this to stop.<eos> So, please... please, just do what I never could.<eos> You're bleeding.

We approached Wesley Gibbins with an immunity deal in exchange for his cooperation in building the case against her.<eos> Mr. Gibbins did not sign the immunity deal, but you can see he made notations which prove he was about to accept the terms.<eos> Unfortunately, he left the station and, in just a few hours, was killed in a fire.<eos> We proffer that Mr. Gibbins went to Ms. Keating's, told her about the investigation, which is why she killed him.<eos> Your Honor, there are other suspects the D.A.'s Office is refusing to look into.<eos> Furthermore, our investigation...<eos> The victim was an eyewitness in the Charles Mahoney murder trial.<eos> All the evidence points to Ms. Keating.<eos> Clearly, the Mahoney family had motive to kill Mr. Gibbins.<eos> Ms. Winterbottom, you asked for more evidence.
A young man has been murdered, and it is of the upmost importance to A.D.A. Atwood and myself that Ms. Keating be brought to justice for this heinous crime.<eos> You're right.<eos> I acted like a Neanderthal, and... clearly, that's something I have to work on, and I will, but... to have to spend another night in that dorm, alone...<eos> Promise me I'll never see you act that way again.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> That's not behavior I can handle.<eos> - I know, and I...<eos> - Asher...<eos> I'm not the only one you need to apologize to.
Dr. Bradfield of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office has confirmed our initial suspicions that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death is asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation.<eos> This reaffirms our belief that Ms. Keating planned and executed the fire in order to kill Mr. Gibbins.<eos> Mmm!<eos> Smells like fresh fish.<eos> I saw someone there... in the basement.<eos> They ran out of the storm door.<eos> Was it you?<eos> No.<eos> It should have been you.<eos> He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.
No.<eos> It should have been you.<eos> He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.<eos> But he's dead.<eos> I don't blame Annalise for that.<eos> I blame you, 'cause it's always you.<eos> I loved him so much more than I have ever loved you.<eos> It should have been you.<eos> Well, look who's back.<eos> You're not permitted to be here.

You said he died before the fire.<eos> Before I did the official autopsy.<eos> Our initial theories change all the time.<eos> Here.<eos> I ain't trying to kill you.<eos> What, y'all girlfriends now?<eos> It's Frank.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> They're saying Wes died in the fire, and it's not true, so... Just... I need you.<eos> We were told you wanted to make a statement?
Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...<eos> - He died 'cause I left him there.<eos> - We'll fix this.<eos> This is proof Mr. Lahey moved and hid the body from Miss Atwood.<eos> I can fix this.<eos> If you just give me a chance...

If you just give me a chance...<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You are suspended!<eos> Atwood admitted she moved Wes' body.<eos> Why aren't we talking about going after the people who killed Wes?<eos> We don't know who killed him.<eos> He testified against Charles Mahoney a week before he died.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Wes was cremated.<eos> All this time, you've been telling me Annalise was hiding something when you're the one with a secret.

1, 2, 3, 4.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I say that to myself so that maybe I'll start to believe it and feel bad.<eos> Because I'll admit, right now,<eos> I don't feel that bad.<eos> It's like my brain just broke... all the way.<eos> And I can't get that image of her out of my head.<eos> I keep having this dream...<eos> Cars crashing into a convenience store, and there's all these people trapped underneath.<eos> They're screaming at me the most vile things that you've ever heard.

- Mistake after stupid mistake.<eos> - It's just stuck...<eos> - Why do I have to always be... - in a constant loop.<eos> Worrying about everyone else?<eos> - I just want to throw up. - "Disgusting, repulsive,<eos> - "dried-up, old bitch."<eos> - Hate me. - I hate it.<eos> - I deserve it.<eos> It's just enough to make me want to die.<eos> - Would you like to share?
It's just enough to make me want to die.<eos> - Would you like to share?<eos> - No. You sure?<eos> We're good listeners.<eos> I'm new.<eos> But you already know that, so...<eos> And I have a problem... with drinking, yes.<eos> But I got other problems, too...<eos> Lots of them.<eos> Like, I could take up this entire meeting talking about them, and you would be entertained.

There was even a woman in here whose 6-year-old daughter died in a school shooting.<eos> I mean, the world is ugly.<eos> People get depressed, and so they drink.<eos> That's clear.<eos> But, I don't know.<eos> Sitting in these rooms, talking about it...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.

Why are you ignoring my texts?<eos> I've been busy.<eos> Busy ratting us out to the fuzz?<eos> Would I be here if I did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they put a wire on you.<eos> Copy that, officers?<eos> I didn't go to the cops.<eos> Did Oliver find something on Annalise's phone?<eos> - Is that what you don't want to say?
- No. - Then what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Why are you lying?<eos> - 'Cause he's always doing it.<eos> I brought you here to fill the seats behind Annalise, not to bicker.<eos> Do I have anything to worry about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Worry about wasting Annalise's time with this impossible motion to dismiss.<eos> We win this, and all of our problems go away, including yours.<eos> So get in there, sit down, and act like you actually like Annalise.

We win this, and all of our problems go away, including yours.<eos> So get in there, sit down, and act like you actually like Annalise.<eos> Is it true you were fired from the District Attorney's office, Ms. Atwood?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> I forged a signature on the form ordering the transfer of Wesley Gibbins' body.<eos> The signature of an investigator from your office...<eos> Nate Lahey?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you explain to the court why you would tamper with evidence this way?
Malicious prosecution.<eos> Overruled.<eos> I wasn't tampering with evidence.<eos> I was protecting it.<eos> How does transferring a body protect evidence?<eos> Ms. Keating has a history of committing unlawful actions to win her cases.<eos> I was trying to protect all of our evidence.<eos> Now.<eos> Transferring the body broke chain of custody, according to Rule 901.<eos> Anyone, including you, could have manipulated the evidence.

- Sustained.<eos> Bonnie.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, the Rule of Spoliation states that you may not benefit from the destruction of evidence.<eos> I never meant to.<eos> Intent is irrelevant.<eos> Your Honor, who is trying the case here?<eos> Ms. Keating, either act as your own counsel or advise your lawyer on your own time.<eos> Ms. Atwood, did you or did you not order the cremation of Wesley Gibbins' body?<eos> I did not.<eos> Do you know who ordered the cremation of Wesley Gibbins?
- So we need to break her.<eos> We would've if I was the one asking the questions.<eos> We go back in tomorrow, so everyone come back to my house, and we'll figure out ways to prove she lied.<eos> Has anyone considered the possibility that Atwood has nothing to do with this?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> The Mahoneys killed Wes and got Atwood to help them cover it up.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - Why does anyone do anything?<eos> Money, son.<eos> When you have Mahoney's cash, you can get people to do anything.

Shh!<eos> My husband's murder is still unsolved.<eos> So, while one nightmare might be over, we are still deep in the middle of another.<eos> I owe it to my husband to find the person or persons who shot him dead in the middle of the street.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Great, so, we sit here and wait for her to come kill us, too.<eos> She's not gonna kill us.<eos> - She's gonna pay someone to kill us.<eos> - No one's getting killed.<eos> You said so yourself that these chuckleheads are dangerous.

And if we find proof that she had any contact with the Mahoneys, they all go down.<eos> And isn't that what you want, to find out who killed Wes and how to make them pay?<eos> So, that's what we do.<eos> We don't stand around here complaining.<eos> We act.<eos> So let's get to work.<eos> - You wanted to see me?<eos> - Close the door.<eos> I saw you in court today.<eos> Who were you there for?
So I need you to look me in the eye and tell me that you are not in contact with Keating.<eos> We've been done for a long time now.<eos> I'm not here to play games, so either trust me or fire me.<eos> No one's getting fired.<eos> Good.<eos> What's this?<eos> Atwood's Wi-Fi password.<eos> She works out of her home office sometimes, so if she had any secret communications, she'd do it from there.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> If Denver finds out that you're helping me,
What's this?<eos> Atwood's Wi-Fi password.<eos> She works out of her home office sometimes, so if she had any secret communications, she'd do it from there.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> If Denver finds out that you're helping me,<eos> - it could hurt both of us.<eos> - Don't worry about that.<eos> My ass could go to jail for the rest of my life.<eos> It's my job to worry about everything right now.<eos> Why do you think I'm here?
If Denver finds out that you're helping me,<eos> - it could hurt both of us.<eos> - Don't worry about that.<eos> My ass could go to jail for the rest of my life.<eos> It's my job to worry about everything right now.<eos> Why do you think I'm here?<eos> Say "thank you."<eos> This is Atwood's Wi-Fi password.<eos> Get into her computer, phone records, bank statements, anything that'll link her to the Mahoneys.<eos> Well, you got her password.
It's a file that's better for Michaela.<eos> I have no idea what you're doing.<eos> No, no, no, please, don't.<eos> Please do...<eos> He looks better than I thought.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You can't even look me in the eye.

Uh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no way for me to find out whose number this is.<eos> - Unless we call it.<eos> - We can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> If the Mahoneys or one of their goons picked up, then we'd know they're in cahoots with Atwood.<eos> And lets them know that we're on to them.<eos> Keep digging.<eos> See if you can trace the number to anyone.

Asher, I think you're probably reading into things.<eos> He's not.<eos> Michaela.<eos> - Just tell them.<eos> - Tell us what?<eos> Yeah, seriously, what's going on?<eos> Uh, I think we should just give Connor some space.<eos> - Open your mouth.<eos> - Connor might've killed Wes.<eos> You know, you're much nicer on HumpR.

Help!<eos> Annalise!<eos> He didn't have a pulse.<eos> Or maybe I just couldn't find it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But his body was still warm, so I started CPR.<eos> - Why didn't you call 911?<eos> - Because I didn't have my phone.<eos> - There was a phone in the house.<eos> - You weren't there.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Come on, Wes!<eos> Breathe!<eos> He wouldn't breathe, so I-I kept doing the... the compressions.<eos> But then...<eos> There was, like, a... like a crack, like a bone or... or rib or something.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe that's what killed him, you know, maybe, like, a... a bone punctured his lung or something.

No, no, Connor, h-he was hurt before you got there.<eos> - Hey, do not baby him right now!<eos> - Connor, Connor, Connor.<eos> Did you see if he was hurt?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Because that would help us figure out how he died.<eos> I didn't see anything!<eos> He just... He just looked dead.<eos> Yeah, 'cause you left him there to die!
- No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Because that would help us figure out how he died.<eos> I didn't see anything!<eos> He just... He just looked dead.<eos> Yeah, 'cause you left him there to die!<eos> There was gas!<eos> I smelled gas.<eos> Whoever killed him cut the gas line.<eos> - You mean you cut the gas line.
- You mean you cut the gas line.<eos> - Laurel.<eos> - Oh, God, Laurel.<eos> - I swear I didn't do this!<eos> How are we supposed to believe you right now?<eos> Look at him!<eos> Look how guilty he feels.<eos> Yeah, maybe 'cause he killed him.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Why are you just telling us this now?

And don't do anything without talking to me.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To buy a gun so that I can use it on Connor.<eos> I have an OB appointment.<eos> Still pregnant.<eos> I really think that we should call the mystery number.<eos> I can block my cell.<eos> There's no way they'll know it's mine.<eos> You heard Annalise.
- Today.<eos> Right after Charles Mahoney was released.<eos> Hello?<eos> Was that a thank you?<eos> No.<eos> When the judge asks me how I got the information, should I just tell them that you broke into her car?<eos> I'm doing everything I can, Annalise.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You should just talk to her.

No.<eos> There's the yolk sac.<eos> That thicker area there is the fetal pole.<eos> And... there you are.<eos> The heartbeat.<eos> It's a big decision.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How much time do I have?<eos> Pennsylvania allows abortions up until 24 weeks.<eos> Just know the law requires you to have a consultation with counselors where all your options are laid on the table
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I just, uh...<eos> I came to a doctor's appointment.<eos> Being back here made me think of you.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I thought that we weren't friends.<eos> Meggy...<eos> Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?

I miss him, and I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.
There's nothing that makes her look stupid.<eos> I couldn't track the phone number, either.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Guys, what about this?<eos> It says, "Stop being a weenie and call the mystery number"!<eos> We're not calling the number.<eos> What about asking your dad?<eos> No.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> There's nothing in Wes' autopsy about the cracked rib, so you can put me on the stand, and I'll tell the truth.

The State objects, Your Honor.<eos> I've had no time to prepare a cross.<eos> Mr. Denver has just stated that she is a critical witness to the State, which means he should be prepared to question her.<eos> I'll be prepared for the trial.<eos> The point of this hearing is to determine whether there will even be a trial, Mr. Denver.<eos> Please step up, Ms. Castillo.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> You know why.<eos> Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.<eos> How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?
You know why.<eos> Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.<eos> How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?<eos> The Mahoneys?<eos> Then who asked you to cremate Wes' body?<eos> I didn't order his body cremated.<eos> We're not in court anymore.<eos> No need to lie.<eos> Everything I said under oath was true.<eos> You don't believe me, I don't care.

Don't come here again.<eos> Why did you contact the defense today, Ms. Castillo?<eos> To tell the truth.<eos> Who did you lie to?<eos> The police.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't know who I could trust.<eos> But now that I know that the D.A. hid Wes' body,<eos> I know that I was right.<eos> What were you too afraid to tell the police?
He was in the basement.<eos> He was unconscious.<eos> But his body was still warm, so I-I started CPR.<eos> For how long?<eos> A minute or more.<eos> And I kept wanting to get him to breathe, so I just kept pressing on his chest.<eos> Um...<eos> But then, I must've...<eos> I must've pressed too hard, 'cause then I, uh, I heard a bone break.<eos> What you're describing is a rib fracture, Ms. Castillo.
But then, I must've...<eos> I must've pressed too hard, 'cause then I, uh, I heard a bone break.<eos> What you're describing is a rib fracture, Ms. Castillo.<eos> But the medical examiner testified that there were no other injuries.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> - Motion to strike.<eos> - He was dead before the fire.<eos> Why are you hiding that?<eos> Please don't address the D.A.<eos> Why are you concealing how he died?

Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo,<eos> I'm advising you to calm down.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No further questions.<eos> You're a law student, Ms. Castillo, so I assume that means you can define "perjury" for the court?

The prosecution enters into evidence this affidavit from the Federal District of Mexico City.<eos> It contains a statement from Ms. Castillo confessing that she made a false claim of kidnapping as a teenager.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> The D.A. is presenting improper character evidence.<eos> Ms. Castillo, is this your signature on this statement?<eos> Hm.<eos> It is.<eos> Then your objection overruled, Ms. Winterbottom.<eos> Continue.<eos> Do you admit to fabricating a story about getting kidnapped?
Hm.<eos> It is.<eos> Then your objection overruled, Ms. Winterbottom.<eos> Continue.<eos> Do you admit to fabricating a story about getting kidnapped?<eos> I can explain.<eos> I'm not asking for an explanation,<eos> - just a yes or no.<eos> - It's not as simple as that.<eos> Did you or did you not sign that document admitting that you lied to authorities about getting kidnapped?
Answer the question.<eos> I did.<eos> - So, you're a pathological liar?<eos> - No.<eos> Really?<eos> Because even a sociopath couldn't lie<eos> - that well on the stand.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> I lied about seeing Wes, not about being kidnapped.<eos> You signed an affidavit admitting you made the whole thing up.
God!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> !<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna fix this.<eos> How?<eos> By telling the truth... That Laurel told my story.<eos> No, Connor...<eos> It's the least I can do at this point.<eos> No, it's the dumbest thing you can do at this point.

And you believe her?<eos> Now I don't know if I believe you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> After everything I've done to you, said to you...<eos> Still meeting me in cars, helping me...<eos> It's hard for me to believe you're not part of all this.<eos> You're being scapegoated, and I see it with my own eyes.<eos> That's why I'm helping you.<eos> I'm calling the mystery phone number.<eos> You hear that, Connor?
- Give me the phone!<eos> - Move!<eos> - Put the phone down!<eos> - Hang up the phone, Asher.<eos> Denver.<eos> He's been gunning for me ever since the Hapstall case, Sinclair.<eos> I strong-armed him into closing the case.<eos> This is such a reach, Annalise.<eos> No.<eos> What's a reach is you prosecuting me...
Expensive.<eos> And extremely damaging for HHM's reputation.<eos> Not my first choice, or yours, I imagine.<eos> The firm could choose to buy me out... for an amount that is almost certain to bankrupt it.<eos> I spent decades building this firm.<eos> I don't want to be the agent of its destruction.<eos> There is a third option.<eos> There's no reason we can't put all this unpleasantness behind us... and continue on as we have been.<eos> I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> And if you agree... I think we can settle all this right now with a simple handshake.
He'll come around.<eos> Don Hector?<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> He'll come around.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> These are from Kevin and Paige.<eos> Well, I guess they're from everybody at Mesa Verde.<eos> Oh, and there's a card somewhere in here.<eos> Here.<eos> - You brought the book?

Oh, and there's a card somewhere in here.<eos> Here.<eos> - You brought the book?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Mr. Gatwood.<eos> The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure you're getting steaks, too.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Texas.<eos> He wishes you a speedy recovery.<eos> You are so lucky.
They'd way rather have a cute guy.<eos> In their heads, they can make a cute guy rich, but you can't make a rich guy cute.<eos> I'll prove it to you.<eos> Mark Zuckerberg.<eos> That guy's got $65 billion in the bank, but girls look at his face and go, "Not enough."<eos> If you gave girls the option between Mark Zuckerberg at full strength and, say, Channing Tatum, with, like, a traumatic brain injury... women would still be, "I'll go with Channing.<eos> I have flash cards. I can nurse him back to health."<eos> Because you're cute, women.<eos> So we chase you around.<eos> You're cute, with your heads and your bodies.
"and we have another show in 20 minutes!"<eos> Good luck not thinking of me next time you do that one.<eos> What's the side one, where you're facing the same way?<eos> Spoons?<eos> Let's call this garbage.<eos> This is a garbage-ass position.<eos> "Why are we fucking like we're underneath the bed?"<eos> And then, finally, there's...<eos> There's doggy style.<eos> Here's something you might not know about doggy style:

And the next week, I got an e-mail on my phone, and it said, "The will of Daniel J. Brennan."<eos> I was, like, "I guess I'll open it."<eos> Which, by the way, isn't in the commercials.<eos> It's not like, "Listen to music.<eos> Take selfies. Open wills."<eos> So, I opened it on the street in New York, and I'm scrolling down, and it says, like, "My son Joe gets one-tenth.<eos> My daughter Sheila gets one-tenth."<eos> Then it got to me... and it said,<eos> "My son Neal gets nothing."<eos> Which still hurts, you know.
Obviously, about the Neika stuff.<eos> Yep, that makes way more sense.<eos> I'll give you a minute.<eos> [Coco] Lionel.<eos> It's not as good as you think it is.<eos> What?<eos> Being with him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> [Sam] Dear White People of Pastiche-- which is redundant-- redacted pages?<eos> That's what you're calling satire these days?

Really?<eos> Coco, what are you doing here?<eos> She's trying to convince me to stop the protest, which you put her up to, so don't act all surprised.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I figured you weren't going to do it.<eos> You're right, I wasn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So why are you here now?<eos> To ask you not to protest.<eos> You two are the fucking worst.
I must go to him now.<eos> Yes, you should.<eos> On the other hand, sexual intercourse does sound good.<eos> [Reggie] Now that Troy and his sycophants are gone, we can get to work.<eos> All right, so we should probably split into groups.<eos> [Sam] Oh, yeah.<eos> Rashid and...<eos> - Ikumi. - Yes.<eos> - Yeah. - Good idea, Reg.<eos> [Sam] We're gonna put you two on signs.
[Sam] We're gonna put you two on signs.<eos> May my art be your weapon.<eos> I'm in. I'm excited.<eos> I cannot do bubble letters, though, just FYI.<eos> Al, we're gonna need you and the Black AF to take the lead on social media.<eos> Also, we're gonna need water, bullhorns, snacks, and if you get anything gluten-free, I will smother you in your sleep.<eos> On it and completely turned on.<eos> [Sam] Reggie and I will handle prep and permits.<eos> We've done it before.<eos> And... Oh! Joelle and Gabe, you two can canvass all the affinity groups on campus, 'cause we need to show a united front.
Not my type.<eos> Well, what is your type?<eos> - Maybe I know somebody.<eos> - You don't.<eos> Come on. Try me.<eos> [sighs] Stop following me, crazy man.<eos> The LGBTQIA Union would love to, but we have a screening of Bowling for Columbine that night.<eos> Oh, we already talked to Annie, and they're canceling that, so... [woman] Actually, we have our own screening.<eos> But it's nice to hear that Annie came to her senses and realized she shouldn't rip off other people's programming just to get back at me.<eos> If you come across that bitch again, tell her it'd be a real shame if her boyfriend found out where she really goes when she says she's at the library.

Thank you, Ryner, for all you and the Olkari have done to assist us.<eos> Once we defeat Zarkon, it is my hope that we can continue to unite our forces and rebuild the once great coalition that my father, King Alfor, began.<eos> Princess, it's time.<eos> Everyone lock into position.<eos> We're taking this thing up.<eos> Princess, we are go for launch.<eos> Charging main turbine.<eos> Commander Thace, you have sent encrypted messages to outside forces.

Get me more power.<eos> I must connect to the Black Lion.<eos> Kolivan, I'm in. Now, what?<eos> Now, you need to reset the system, using the codes that Thace obtained.<eos> It'll be down for a dobosh.<eos> That's when we'll upload the virus.<eos> -It doesn't seem to be working.<eos> -Try it again.<eos> Keith, are you there?<eos> And now, we know you were attempting to shut down the system.

[Zarkon] I want weapons systems activated immediately!<eos> Restart the entire crystal core manually if you have to!<eos> Our ship may be without power, but we are not.<eos> I can use the komar to draw the quintessence directly from Voltron, rendering him lifeless.<eos> It is time I face Voltron myself.<eos> No, lord!<eos> It is certain death!<eos> Today, the Black Lion will be mine.<eos> Your obsession with the Black Lion is clouding your judgment!<eos> You must not go out there!
We've neutralized the engines.<eos> Let's target the bridge.<eos> Ready...<eos> [Lance] What is that?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Attack!<eos> No!<eos> It's pure quintessence!<eos> [Coran] Paladins!<eos> Can you hear me?
[Coran] If it destroys planets, what did it do to the paladins?<eos> [Allura] Paladins!<eos> Shiro! Can you hear me?<eos> [Shiro] Yes, Princess.<eos> We're alive.<eos> -Oh, thank the ancients!<eos> -Is Voltron operational?<eos> It's not working.<eos> [grunts] I can't move my lion.<eos> You've been hit with some kind of witchcraft that draws the quintessence out of you.

What's that?<eos> You must get moving.
[grunts] Voltron's still not responding.<eos> [groaning] [sighs] It's Zarkon.<eos> We must buy them more time.<eos> Get us in closer.<eos> -Divert all power to our weapons system.<eos> -What?<eos> Princess, we'll be defenseless!<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You are true paladins now.
We cannot give up.<eos> [grunting] Did we win yet?<eos> Coran, you and Slav do what you can to get the Castle functioning again.<eos> Kolivan, can you get me to the komar?<eos> It will be dangerous, but I know a way.<eos> -You and Antok come with me. -[both grunt]<eos> We're going to have to attack the witch directly if we hope to stop that thing.<eos> Coran, the bridge is yours.<eos> No!<eos> You've been weakened by operating the teludav.
One way or another, this may be our last battle.<eos> We've got to give everything we have.<eos> Dig deep and fight!<eos> [grunts] [growling] Attack!<eos> This is my time to reclaim the Black Lion.<eos> Nothing can stop me.<eos> [grunting] He's trying to control my lion.<eos> I can feel him in my mind.<eos> Fight it, Shiro!<eos> You should have fled like your predecessors.
- What happened? - Uh, nothing.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, my God, babe, what did she do?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> Let me go!<eos> - What did she do?<eos> Hey. What do you got?<eos> Man: Hey, I've got the stuff.<eos> Come by when you're ready.
Also studied primitive societies in 1894.<eos> He disappears into the jungles of Borneo never to be heard from again.<eos> Presumed dead, 1898.<eos> It's all here.<eos> I cracked her email.<eos> - And the window's today only? - Mm-hmm.<eos> But I don't get it.<eos> What's this person's connection to all this?<eos> Right, need to know basis.<eos> What are you two up to?
What's this person's connection to all this?<eos> Right, need to know basis.<eos> What are you two up to?<eos> Keep pushing on P.T. There must be some record of him in the last 100 years.<eos> - He might have assumed a new identity.<eos> - Publishing under a pen name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So when we get back, can I have a timeline?<eos> Neolution from day one.<eos> Where are you guys going?
Yeah.<eos> Going for a walk. Just clearing my head! Where was it?<eos> Mud!<eos> You understand me? I'm asking you a question, Mud! Oh, no!<eos> I haven't seen anything!<eos> You're lying.<eos> Where is he? Where does he hide? I don't know!<eos> Now leave me alone!<eos> - Where was he?<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you recognize me now? Sarah Manning.<eos> And her mom.<eos> I like her.<eos> How's Helena and the pregnancy?<eos> That's from her.<eos> Psychopath!<eos> The Castor soldiers and the women that they infected...<eos> Yeah, but she's going to tell us about P.T. Westmorland, aren't you, Virginia?<eos> Well, well.<eos> Haven't you come far.
Yup, I'm right here.<eos> Morning, love.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Where you off to?<eos> I'm going down the lab to see the boys.<eos> I'm just trying to fit this Coady story into the mix.<eos> Yeah, making monsters with P.T. and Susan back in the day.<eos> Wish we could talk to Cosima.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't have to whisper.
Leekie was studying skin and organ regeneration using the same gene in spiny mice.<eos> Did you know that spiny mice have 90% of the same genes as humans?<eos> Really?<eos> And you're supposed to pick them up by the tail, like this.<eos> When you put him down he feels safe and crawls all over you.<eos> You know, I saw... Um... Auntie Helena.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How is she?<eos> She misses you.
They've been testing her at Dyad.<eos> What? Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I just got here. I'm telling you now.<eos> Delphine, you're requested for dinner.<eos> I'm coming too.<eos> You're not invited.<eos> Just stay here until I get back.<eos> LIN28A.<eos> Tell Westmorland I found his fountain.<eos> You are not suitable for dinner.
Little tricks and then, maybe even gain Rachel's trust? Yeah?<eos> Well.<eos> That is the hustle, isn't it?<eos> How do you go about that? How do you gain someone's trust?<eos> You have to figure out what they want first. And then give it to them without them realising it.<eos> And what is it that Rachel really wants?<eos> LIN28A.<eos> The so-called Fountain of Youth gene.<eos> We're decades ahead of popular science.<eos> You're both lucky to be here.
We'll see to this.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> You lock the door, you stay put till I give the all clear.<eos> That thing is in the house.<eos> Be quiet, Ira, close the drapes.<eos> - Chickens coming to roost.<eos> - These are not my chickens.<eos> That man that's coming after you, there's a direct line from him to Kira.<eos> Listen to her, Susan.<eos> How are you going to exploit Kira's mutation?
- Chickens coming to roost.<eos> - These are not my chickens.<eos> That man that's coming after you, there's a direct line from him to Kira.<eos> Listen to her, Susan.<eos> How are you going to exploit Kira's mutation?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> - No, no, I don't.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.
These are the faces we have so far.<eos> Timothy Midwell, died 1969. Alcohol poisoning.<eos> No.<eos> Henry Gonard, died '68.<eos> He fell from a punt and drowned.<eos> Probably also alcohol poisoning.<eos> No. Winston Tralley, died '65, rugby accident.<eos> No!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Cosima, please tell me you have something.
She knows we're not returning Kira.<eos> I'll take care of them.<eos> Don't hesitate, Simon.<eos> It's Art. Don't worry, I'm alone.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You won't believe it.<eos> They're not here.<eos> You need to return at once.<eos> Kira!<eos> What did you do to her?
Well, now everyone will know.<eos> Sister Irina, help!<eos> Sister Irina!<eos> I didn't see anything!<eos> You can learn nothing in here!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> ♪ Of all the comrades that ere I had... ♪<eos> Some of you know what we have been through more than others.<eos> But you all knew S didn't go anywhere without a fight.
♪ I'll gently rise and I'll softly call ♪<eos> ♪ Good night and joy be with you all ♪<eos> She wrote us a... A letter. Three of us.<eos> Before she was taken.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> I can do it, it's all right...<eos> It's okay, it's okay...<eos> "Just remember, my loves, death is nothing at all.<eos> I've only slipped into the next room.<eos> You can call me by my old familiar name.
No need to sound just like Susan.<eos> You can hold on a little longer. Oh, can I?<eos> If you won't C-section, I want hormone induction.<eos> - John...<eos> - Do it, Virginia!<eos> No, please, let me out.<eos> No, please, let me out.<eos> Please.<eos> Filthy, dirty copulators.<eos> Do you touch yourself, too?
Euthanising Mark was a necessity.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm going for a smoke.<eos> Sir, Hashem Al-Khatib...<eos> Frontenac must have messed up.<eos> You are still with us?<eos> And I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> By offering you something that you value far, far, more than me.<eos> And what could that possibly be?<eos> Guys, do you have any idea how insane this plan is?
Do you realise how many things could go wrong?<eos> Yes, and so does she.<eos> Art's on top of it, all right, we've got a tracking device on the car.<eos> They're gonna lead us right to Helena.<eos> So, then, what's she supposed to do when she gets to wherever they're taking her?<eos> Stall.<eos> John will want an audience with me before he cuts off my head.<eos> Sarah will have to keep him busy.<eos> My babies... you deserve better than me.<eos> You will not be an experiment.
Oh, wait for it, chicken.<eos> Hello, North American scum!<eos> We bought a shit mountain of cheese.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> - Hey, you're home!<eos> - Yeah, did you forget?<eos> Tonight's my big "coming out" party.<eos> - Your art opening?<eos> - An art opening?<eos> Do you think that's a good idea right now?
You're serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's done.<eos> This is it?<eos> This is everything?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Loaded.<eos> And ready to send all the regulatory and oversight committees in the affected countries.<eos> As well as to all journalist friends of Siobhan at The Guardian.<eos> You guys did all this for us.
A little fighting creative spirit, even when you were tiny.<eos> This is Colin, Mum.<eos> Someday soon he'd like to come around for tea - and asking for my hand, isn't that right?<eos> - Oh. - Colin, hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> He does though have some rather piercing questions about some of my muses.<eos> Oh, well... You better settle accounts there before you come around to me then.<eos> Well, I think we can work something out.<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to raise some hell will the Wizard?
And let's not forget scurvy.<eos> What a year I'm having!<eos> You guys are friends now?<eos> Oh, far more than friends.<eos> We just made out in the street.<eos> Like that World War II picture of the sailor assaulting a nurse.<eos> Fun fact: he was only pretending to be a sailor.<eos> [Lillian] Yeah, so we can't stay long.<eos> We're going upstairs as soon as the cats stop freaking out from the storm.<eos> Oh. No, you can't go.
Look, I had a bad time in a bunker once, and I want this one to be different.<eos> [Artie] Say no more. You want to replace your old, bad experience with a new, good experience.<eos> It's called exposure therapy, and it works.<eos> I went back to Vietnam in the early '80s and had a lovely time.<eos> Now when I wake up screaming, it's about how good the food was.<eos> Great example, Mr. Goodman.<eos> And what's gonna make this a good bunker is we get to choose who's in here with us.<eos> And I want you and Lillian to stay.<eos> We could cozy up down here. -Yeah.<eos> -Hope you guys don't mind a little PDA.
But seeing her right now could be really dangerous for both of you.<eos> I know, but she asked to see me.<eos> After all this time, she came to me.<eos> If I turn her down, I might not get a second chance.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> Always.<eos> Hello, olá, and Eoh, wasseo, gamers and gamerettes.<eos> It's O.G. Pwnzr coming to you live from New York City - with your daily dose of... - knowledge.<eos> Today I'm gonna introduce you to the newest champion for Skystrike Titans, Vadrus Typhon.<eos> He is a complete badass, which is why all you rug rats are gonna pay big bucks for this upgrade, so you can do this...

Pwnzr coming to you live from New York City - with your daily dose of... - knowledge.<eos> Today I'm gonna introduce you to the newest champion for Skystrike Titans, Vadrus Typhon.<eos> He is a complete badass, which is why all you rug rats are gonna pay big bucks for this upgrade, so you can do this...<eos> "But how do I execute that combo?" you ask...
Okay, admit it, this guy's hilarious.<eos> He's old.<eos> He's got to be, like, 30.<eos> Yeah, but, like, that's the whole point.<eos> He's been playing forever, so he knows all the tricks.<eos> He's gonna be at the VGU Open this weekend. I'm gonna play him.<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass.<eos> I can't believe you're wasting an entire weekend playing video games with sweaty nerdcore dweebs.<eos> Not all of them are dweebs.<eos> Challenge Uncle O.G., but be warned... You will be wrecked.
Joey, we're ready.<eos> Sorry. We're interrupting?<eos> Looks like we're the ones interrupting.<eos> Anezka and her friends are trade-show models for the tournament this weekend.<eos> They're here to take publicity photos with the team.<eos> You're police.<eos> Did Joey do something wrong?<eos> No, we just...<eos> We're clearing up a misunderstanding.<eos> Hey, why don't you, go hang out with the team, okay?
What's so special about this building?<eos> Carla Petro was arrested here once.<eos> It was thought that her employers kept an apartment here so that the girls could entertain clients.<eos> Just the kind of place Libena might go to hide?<eos> You got this all wrong.<eos> I'm just here to serve a summons. Yeah, right.<eos> Tendu?<eos> Libena?<eos> Police are here.<eos> You're safe.
Wait, please wait...<eos> Was she alone when it happened?<eos> When she woke up?<eos> - Leif?<eos> - What?<eos> Was Ravn there?<eos> Or you?<eos> Was anyone with her? No, we weren't here...<eos> Did the cameras catch it?<eos> So you weren't here?
Do you trust her?<eos> Do you?<eos> SCIENTIST RETURNED FROM THE DEAD<eos> Ravn!<eos> Ravn, I can't stand it.<eos> They're right outside!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Spare me the excuses.<eos> - Please leave us alone.<eos> - It's better you talk to us. You're trespassing.
When he found an empty boat and a letter, you were on your way to this clinic.<eos> What luggage did you bring?<eos> Well... What do you mean exactly?<eos> Things like a suitcase?<eos> Your phone?<eos> Passport?<eos> Just a small suitcase and some clothes.<eos> How did you travel?<eos> I was picked up... by car.<eos> At your cabin, where you were staying?
Exactly.<eos> That is...<eos> That's great.<eos> We've got a drop of blood.<eos> Hold this, please, and I'll fetch...<eos> Press down on that.<eos> Like that.<eos> That went...<eos> Great.<eos> - Have you got any methadone here?
That went...<eos> Great.<eos> - Have you got any methadone here?<eos> - No. - Subutex?<eos> Suboxone?<eos> Oxazepam?<eos> - No. We don't do drug rehabilitation.<eos> This is an outpatient clinic.<eos> Injuries, examinations and basic surgery.<eos> - So you've got morphine?
Your statement has holes in it.<eos> Where you went... - Your statements don't match.<eos> - Why don't you tell me your theory.<eos> We think you treated your wife yourself. In secret, in this country, illegally.<eos> Faking your own death is a criminal offence.<eos> For both of you.<eos> - Ravn didn't know anything.<eos> - I'm pretty sure he did.<eos> Do you have any proof?<eos> I think you're lying to us.
I know very well that your patience is stretched to its limit.<eos> I assure you that for the past 72 hours, we've been working day and night to identify the problem.<eos> There must be some contingency plan?<eos> Are you in control of the situation?
Of the dark, and of each other.<eos> The following Sunday, a local priest said to his congregation:<eos> "We are without God now."<eos> - Leif?<eos> - Hi!<eos> This is my brother Leif.<eos> He works for the city council.<eos> I've prepared a safe place for you.<eos> It's not far from here.<eos> It's got everything you need for quite a while.
I never knew about you guys.<eos> It's nothing to know.<eos> We were just, you know, figuring it out.<eos> I figured it out.<eos> We've been assuming that Waverider's broadcasting - using a quantum frequency, but...<eos> - But only if the quad band antenna array was in alignment.<eos> - Ray, you are a genius.<eos> - I guess I am.<eos> I kinda forgot what it was like.<eos> So can you communicate with Rip or what?
Englishman, disable Gideon.<eos> We can't risk her blowing our cover.<eos> You round up everyone in the library.<eos> Make sure the coast is clear.<eos> Then I can snatch the item.<eos> You know what?<eos> This is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you guys doing?<eos> You just left for the church.
- Where the hell have you been? - Eh, um...<eos> I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I just got...<eos> I got distracted.<eos> We gotta get out of here.<eos> Negative.<eos> We got a new problem.<eos> Your old selves are back.<eos> Hang on.<eos> You mean that we've returned from the church?<eos> Yes, and if you come out of the ship now, they'll see you and wreck time itself.
I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I just got...<eos> I got distracted.<eos> We gotta get out of here.<eos> Negative.<eos> We got a new problem.<eos> Your old selves are back.<eos> Hang on.<eos> You mean that we've returned from the church?<eos> Yes, and if you come out of the ship now, they'll see you and wreck time itself.<eos> You're trapped in there.
What the hell was that?<eos> It's a timequake.<eos> The result of us interacting with ourselves.<eos> - Well, that wasn't so bad. - Yeah, give it time.<eos> Whose bright idea was it to do the one thing that could jeopardize all of time?<eos> Yours.<eos> What the hell are you staring at?<eos> Just imagining what you'd look like without teeth.<eos> Knock it off, Rory.<eos> I can't believe that even we would do anything so foolish, unless something went terribly wrong the first time you were here.
The ship has sustained critical damage. Well, good news.<eos> The time-storm seems to have caused a temporary ceasefire.<eos> The bad news is the Legion of Doom's still trying to kill us.<eos> Wait, how far do you even think we'll be able<eos> - to make it out there?<eos> - You only have to make it as far as the other Waverider.<eos> You want us to time jump together again?<eos> Uh... you saw what just happened.<eos> We won't be time jumping together.<eos> You're not coming with us.
This has always been a one-way ticket for us.<eos> Your team has to get the Spear of Destiny away from here.<eos> We won't fail you guys.<eos> - Guys, we've got company.<eos> - I see 'em.<eos> Everybody clear on the plan?<eos> Run like hell.<eos> Try not to die.<eos> What about you guys?<eos> You ready?
Get this in the ship.<eos> Oh, I've been waiting for this.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Do it.<eos> Death would be too kind.<eos> Nice work. Both of you.<eos> Where's the Spear?<eos> You took it to the rendezvous point. Oh, did I?<eos> Right.<eos> If you don't wanna get stuck in 1916, get to the ship now.
I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing, like "chloresterol."<eos> Yeah, or, "Please pass the government butter."<eos> [Dianne] Leonora?<eos> Yin to my yin?<eos> You must be Kimmy. Oh!<eos> Dianne Delamonte-Shapiro.<eos> Welcome to our home.<eos> All the art is meant to be touched.<eos> -[bell ringing] -[clears throat] Uh, mes putains? Dinner is served!<eos> If you are allergic to any of the vegetables mentioned in Shakespeare, you will find nothing to your liking.
I didn't realize I was in the company of a presentation-giver.<eos> Uh, it's about the Phaedo,<eos> Plato's last Socratic dialogue.<eos> Some people don't realize that many of those ancient texts were meant to be read aloud.<eos> Idiots.<eos> So I'm bringing them into the 21st century by rapping them.<eos> The other students will be all like,<eos> "Uh, oh, my, rapping has no place in the classroom.<eos> We only learn from books and scrolls and- - Wait, what?"<eos> [Leonora laughing] You two remind me of me and Dianne when we were your age.
It's a real Lindas' club.<eos> [Linda S.] Well, in my country, it's actually pronounced "Leenda,"<eos> so it is not so weird on the baby.<eos> -That's beautiful.<eos> -That's so nice.<eos> I love to travel.<eos> So Kimmy was wrong yet again.<eos> I'm not being crazy?<eos> No, a baby named Linda is weird, but it is the kind of thing that you can look past if you really want to.<eos> What are you saying, Lindas?
I'm on day two, Whole30.<eos> -We should do it together.<eos> -You already look great. -Linda--<eos> -You'll never make it.<eos> Thanks, Lindas.<eos> Are you going to stay for Karen's birthday cupcakes?<eos> Uh, is Linda D. proud of her nephew?<eos> You know I am. Stop it, girl.<eos> [laughter]<eos> Hey, if I hook you guys up, will you drive me to my boyfriend's wife's house later?
But I doubt you're aware that this very spot is where the horse Bianca Jagger rode into Studio 54 was found later that night.<eos> I'll never forget the Post cover.<eos> "Horse Found."<eos> That was before they did puns.<eos> And I will be honoring Bandit with this plaque.<eos> And you'll be pleased to know we'll be building a footbridge so the homeless guy who likes yelling at the river can still access the part of the river he's most furious at.<eos> Any other concerns, Councilwoman?<eos> Stop!<eos> It's not hammer time!<eos> Do you even know this Big Naturals is not a strip club?
Ha! Man, those pee-pee commercials are all up in my porns.<eos> You must be rich now!<eos> Wait. Should I be mugging you?<eos> Sir, if I were rich, do you think I'd be talking to you right now?<eos> I'd be eating real mayonnaise with a metal spoon.<eos> But Big Pharma just prints money, man.<eos> Yeah, they spend a lot on RD, but once the drug gets approved by the FDA, they got a 20-year patent.<eos> I know 'cause I'm also in the drug biz.<eos> Take a pen.<eos> Well, Big Pharma, I'm gonna make you wish you ripped off someone with less time on their hands.
Look, I just need to talk to someone about the money you guys owe me.<eos> Unrelated question:<eos> how often do you receive big cakes that a person could fit in?<eos> Good afternoon, Mr. Bortz.<eos> Are they expecting you?<eos> Oh, call me Dale.<eos> I'm just going in to record a couple radio spots.<eos> Shouldn't take long, and then... [in cartoon bladder's voice] it's time to go, girl.<eos> Whistle noise!<eos> You guys are being lied to!

Now every time you come home, the mailbox flag is up, and you have to grade papers by the dome light in your car.<eos> Well, that's class.<eos> Kimmy, I need to ask you for a favor, okay?<eos> Anything, Xan.<eos> Anything. You are my sister, and I love you.<eos> God!<eos> Look, I've been working at the university TV station.<eos> CTV?<eos> My favorite show is the dining hall menu.<eos> Does that mean you get the menu ahead of time?
I couldn't resist 40% off.<eos> Clayton Prep? Mmhmm.<eos> well, that's... that's big news.<eos> It's not a sure thing. I mean, she hasn't even gotten in yet.<eos> I'm just jumping the gun 'cause of the sale and...<eos> Well, I should... I should run.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, this is Miles.<eos> You know what to do.
Glaciers?<eos> No.<eos> Dirt bikes? No.<eos> Wildlife?<eos> Sex?<eos> I've never done it before, but I expect to soon, after the Winter Formal Dance.<eos> What?<eos> With who?<eos> My girlfriend Paige.<eos> Have you gone through the bases?
And I've already spoken to the people at Techtropolis, and they are willing to donate headphones for this event, which is supercool of them.<eos> So in conclusion, I think that Newton High should be a place that's inclusive of all students.<eos> That's it. Thank you.<eos> Okay, so if we're ready to vote?<eos> Yes, April.<eos> I made JJ an appointment, months ago, to get her hair done.<eos> It's going to cost me about $80.<eos> Um... Now you want to flatten it with a bulky set of headphones.<eos> I think maybe no.<eos> Um, you know what?
Okay, so, short of building a time machine, how do we figure out what that something might be?<eos> I've reached out to some friends at Scotland Yard, asked them to dig up records of what was going on in and around the court at the time of Kotite's trial.<eos> In the meantime, I suggest we approach one of the two local parties which might be able to shed some light.<eos> I'm guessing Cy Durning's widow is one of them.<eos> Who's the other? Farrell Putnam, the so-called "Death Star" law firm which Kotite hired to defend him.<eos> They've got offices all over the world, including here in New York.<eos> So, while I pop in on them, you and Kitty go and visit the widow Durning.<eos> This is her address.<eos> Why don't you take Kitty?<eos> I know you two have a lot to catch up on.
- I do, to all of it.<eos> - "All of it"? The snail's pace of these proceedings, for one thing.<eos> My client, Mr. Kotite, is a busy man;<eos> he deserves better.<eos> - Mr. Saunders...<eos> - My Lord, the government's case is packed to the gills with second hand whispers and hearsay.<eos> That might be less objectionable if they had the first clue who to listen to.<eos> Maybe then, they would know about the Chinese astronauts watching us through our phones;<eos> they'd know you can't flush 50 pounds of cyclonite down the oldest toilet in Caracas and expect Venezuelan democracy to survive.<eos> And you yourself, My Lord, might know how much gold is buried under the Great Pyramid of Giza if you would just listen to the voices that are all around...
He said that Saunders suffered from schizophrenia.<eos> Obviously, he was off his meds the day this was recorded.<eos> Okay, so we can prove now that Saunders wasn't a well man.<eos> How does that help us? All those theories he rattled off--<eos> Chinese astronauts, cyclonite, the Great Pyramid of Giza. Yeah?<eos> I'm pretty sure one of them is true.<eos> I think that's why the DIA's been going around killing people.<eos> ...they would know about the Chinese astronauts watching us through our phones.<eos> They'd know you can't flush 50 pounds of cyclonite down the oldest toilet in Caracas and expect Venezuelan democracy to survive.<eos> And you yourself, My Lord, might know how much gold is buried under the Great Pyramid of Giza if you would just listen to the voices that are all around us!
Some early riser is gonna wander in here soon.<eos> Why don't you move on to food processing giants and I'll look at the airlines?<eos> So I heard you and Kitty talked.<eos> We did.<eos> What?<eos> Well, she told me you seemed unhappy.<eos> I had a hard time believing that, but now I don't.<eos> You want to tell me what gives?<eos> Nothing gives.<eos> Gosh, you're all the same.
On a contract signed three years ago.<eos> So whichever lawyer signed this knew as much as Tom Saunders about what Gephardt was planning.<eos> It's not often the person we're looking for literally signs his work, but Sydney Garber did.<eos> Take a close look at the threes.<eos> Perfect match.<eos> Well, that explains why he was so quick to dismiss the idea that Saunders was murdered.<eos> Yes, but it doesn't explain why a rogue DIA analyst was in cahoots with two white-shoe attorneys in the first place.<eos> Hoping Mr. Garber will be more forthcoming on that topic today.<eos> Somehow I doubt he'll be as eager to meet us as yesterday.<eos> You two will manage.
-Relationships can be a bit messy.<eos> -Yeah. You have to sort of manage through that.<eos> It's really about having these lively dialogues with young individuals, and then giving them the tool kits to be able to develop their own voice.<eos> The aim is to enhance the food preparation.<eos> It acts like a magnifying lens, so you get a different connection with the food you are preparing.<eos> [Ilse] What I really love about your project is, when you look at them, on the one hand, you see kitchen utensils, and on the other hand, you look at this material you've never seen used that way.<eos> It's been a really, really great trimester.<eos> What I think was probably quite challenging with the project was the collaboration and how that really involves a craft of a relationship.<eos> It's actually a really good microcosm of what will happen later on in life.<eos> Whether you're working on a small scale or big scale, to be a designer focused on wellbeing, you have to start with how things are made.

Seymour was an illustrator, but he's a sensational designer.<eos> I thought his work was very funny. Some of it was exceedingly political.<eos> In the late '50s, Seymour founded Push Pin Studios with Milton Glaser and Ed Sorel.<eos> They developed a style of design and illustration that combined pop colors, wit and intellectual thinking.<eos> It's where I really started to understand that type had spirit and did not have to be some clean, mechanical-like thing that was simply doing its job.<eos> It could be this marvelous thing to engage with.<eos> Seymour has the studio above me.<eos> It's a bigger studio, and he makes more paintings.<eos> He can wake up and always seem to be able to work.<eos> [director] You guys are kind of historic as a couple.
Ok, so that could mean that Scratch is manipulating another victim suffering from dissociative identity disorder.<eos> Or he's working with a full-fledged accomplice for the first time.<eos> What woman would willingly associate herself with Scratch?<eos> And why would Scratch risk taking on a partner?<eos> That's what we need to find out. We'll start by checking all of the women in the database we compiled of D.I.D. patients. Garcia:<eos> Wait, how was he?<eos> He's, um, he's having a hard time.<eos> We gotta get him out of there, you guys.<eos> We will, but right now it's late, and we're no good to him running on fumes.<eos> Clear your heads, get some rest if you can, we'll start fresh in the morning.
- Cheers.<eos> - Hear, hear. All right!<eos> We got 'em.<eos> Awesome.<eos> And, uh, here's to no cloak and dagger talk.<eos> No mention of cultivating human assets or counter-intelligence.<eos> Or who's in and who's out at the FSB.<eos> All right, hey, we're not that bad.<eos> Which reminds me, Petrov got promoted.<eos> Lisa: Stop, you guys, incorrigible, both of you.
Hello.<eos> You didn't tell me you were a fellow when-- when we met.<eos> You didn't ask. Okay.<eos> - Uh, really, right-- - Excuse me.<eos> - Could have taken this--<eos> - All right.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> I'm Suki. People call me Sooks.<eos> I'm in charge of all housing problems, travel, WiFi passwords, stipend.<eos> Anything you need, you can come to me first.
I told you I wasn't lying.<eos> Ángeles, are you all right?<eos> Ángeles!<eos> -What's wrong?<eos> I had an argument with Lidia.<eos> It was just awful, Carolina.<eos> With Lidia?<eos> There's a girl who says she's Lidia Aguilar... and that the Lidia we know isn't really Lidia at all.<eos> She's not who she says she is.<eos> Is that why you were talking to Francisco this morning?
Are you all right?<eos> No, she's not.<eos> She's a little unwell, Sara.<eos> Miss Millán, do you mind if I take the day off?<eos> Yes, of course, if you're not feeling well.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -I'll see her out.<eos> Girls, I'd like to speak to you.<eos> This has all been a mix-up.<eos> I can't convince Ángeles... but I wouldn't want you to doubt me as well.
I know what could happen.<eos> Tell her to come back.<eos> I'll talk to Ricardo.<eos> Carlota, a little dessert wine?<eos> -No, thanks, Doña Lola.<eos> -I'll have a little.<eos> You stick to water.<eos> Alcohol doesn't agree with you.<eos> What's wrong with you two?<eos> You look like you're at a wake.
Elisa, you're the only woman I care about.<eos> Then get rid of that suitcase... and swear that you've ended that relationship.<eos> Because if I lose you, next time I won't let you save me.<eos> And everyone will know you're responsible for my death.<eos> Darling.<eos> My dear girl... My dear girl...<eos> [Lola] Girls, breakfast is ready.<eos> [Marga] Yes, we're coming, Doña Lola.<eos> [Lola] It's always the same.<eos> You'll be late!
-Miguel, I love you.<eos> Then what's this about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's talk this over somewhere else, like your place.<eos> That'd be better.<eos> But I'm going. I need to be alone.<eos> Miguel, please.<eos> Please, wait!<eos> ♪ I wanted love the most ♪ A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES<eos> -So you broke up?
-It's none of your business.<eos> She's right.<eos> Lidia, if you won't trust us, we can't help you.<eos> -She's right, too.<eos> -He's a married man.<eos> Good Lord, what's going on today?<eos> It's over between us, but if people find out about it, it'll mean trouble.<eos> That suitcase is proof of my past, a past that I don't want back.<eos> Like your village or your family.<eos> I hope you understand.
I'm telling you from experience.<eos> Ángeles!<eos> I'm leaving you in charge.<eos> I have business to see to.<eos> Miss Rodríguez de Senillosa.<eos> Could you come with me?<eos> What did Miguel say to you?<eos> I imagine he didn't take it well.<eos> What do you think?<eos> What happened? Did you break up?
-Don't touch me!<eos> -I never want to see you again! You hear? Never!<eos> I don't know if it's a good idea.<eos> You can't go back to him, Ángeles.<eos> Not after this.<eos> Besides, it's the supervisor's orders.<eos> She's the boss.<eos> [Marga] What do we tell Mario?<eos> [Alba] That she's gone home.<eos> You'll have time before he leaves.
It was an embarrassing spectacle.<eos> We must take measures to see this does not happen again.<eos> Imagine if the mayor were here.<eos> You're always looking out for the good of the family, Father.<eos> When were you going to tell us you were settling down and in a formal relationship?<eos> -It's serious this time, isn't it? -[chuckles]<eos> We shall see.<eos> It's nothing personal, just his record.<eos> As for my daughter, she may have stopped taking her medication.<eos> Do you know each other?
What are you doing here?<eos> -[Carlota] I've come to talk to Father.<eos> -[Emilio] And to what do I owe that honor?<eos> The thing is... a friend of mine is being held at the police station.<eos> You have contacts in the police, so I thought you could help her because Sara can't lose her job.<eos> So that's why you came, to ask for a favor.<eos> I came because I believe that, under that colonel's uniform, there is a good man with a good heart.<eos> And so that you can show me I'm not mistaken.<eos> Your friend should have been more careful.<eos> Depending on which places you frequent, you risk being caught in a raid.
[sighs] Well, I think it's time now.<eos> I wanted to say something, but now... [chuckles] I'm not able to.<eos> I'm really scared, girls.<eos> I never thought that my life was going to be like this...<eos> Running away to another city, with another identity.<eos> It's so strange.<eos> Sometimes there's no option.<eos> [chuckles] You know?<eos> I was working here all this time... and I'd never made any friends.<eos> I'm so thankful you arrived late that first day.
It's not just about you.<eos> -You got into this because of me.<eos> -Again, please stay out of it.<eos> I'm not staying out of it.<eos> I'm going to help you.<eos> You don't want Carlos to see those photos?<eos> We'll do it together.<eos> -Why would you do that?<eos> -Because I love you and Carlos.<eos> You're the most important people in my life.
With my aching body and hangover, a fly could beat me.<eos> I know what you think of me, but I didn't do it.<eos> I am who I am thanks to you.<eos> Who you are...<eos> What about who you were?<eos> What's left of that Francisco?<eos> You're not the man I knew.<eos> If it's about the rotary, I did not betray you. The rotary, the spying... and Lidia.<eos> Would it do any good if I said I was wrong about her?<eos> You have my blessing.
[Carmen] That operator seems like a good girl, but being the companion of Carlos Cifuentes isn't the same as being the fiancée of the owner of the Telephone Company.<eos> I've been thinking about that project you wanted to do.<eos> What was your plan?<eos> My plan?<eos> I was thinking of installing the rotary in a small station like Santander.<eos> Why not in Madrid?<eos> Since when are you interested in the business?<eos> Son, there's something you should know.<eos> A woman may be silent, but she's not deaf.<eos> I know more about this business than any of you.
And I'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Watch me.<eos> The rock-climbing champ showed us he's a front-runner by finishing Level 1.<eos> No question!<eos> Let's see what he's got left in the tank here on Spinal Ascent.<eos> He is so well-conditioned as an athlete.<eos> He's been a climber since he was ten years old.<eos> All that practice is coming in handy today.<eos> It's an eight-foot jump to that top platform.<eos> Wow, did you see that?
Brazil!<eos> One of the best efforts I have ever seen.<eos> But, as we enter the final level, he's found a worthy challenger in Ludwig Hefele.<eos> With phenomenal parkour skills, Ludwig Hefele, he's got the speed...<eos> Wills his way back!<eos> ...strength, and climbing ability to take on the most formidable competitor we've ever seen.<eos> Now they'll battle it out on the toughest obstacle in the Beast, one that no competitor has yet to conquer, an 80-foot climb up the Power Source.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Because only one of them will win $10,000 and advance to the finals... for a chance to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> So, what do you say?
Felipe Camargo has defeated Level 4, the Power Source.<eos> He just won $10,000.<eos> And he's got the opportunity to advance to the finals and win $50,000 and the title, Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> One, two, three!<eos> What a night, and what a show he put on!<eos> I'm very happy. I've been climbing for 15 years.<eos> I knew that if I came to this competition, it would be mine.<eos> I'm very happy.<eos> Thanks, Brazil!<eos> Look, if you're like me, you cannot get enough of Ultimate Beastmaster.
Well, he is the Mitsuterry Crews of Japan.<eos> Well, he's not joking now, Terry, as he makes his way down Spinal Descent, and if he gets the Point Thruster and clears Spinal Descent, well, unfortunately, he's gonna eliminate our boy Brian Redard<eos> He's not going for it.<eos> That's a huge mistake.<eos> That is a mistake, and now his fate is in the gears of Stomach Churn.<eos> In spite of all the pressure, it looks like he's having fun.<eos> He's gonna have to get serious soon, because he has to clear Stomach Churn if he wants to stay in this competition.<eos> This is do or die for Japan.<eos> There we go.<eos> You didn't do that in gym class, folks.
He is Beastmaster!<eos> Brazil!<eos> Brazil!<eos> This was an epic, epic performance!<eos> Well, Terry, after 108 competitors from six different countries, we can now say that Felipe Camargo is this season's Beastmaster.<eos> There was only one Brazilian in the big final and I managed to win this for Brazil.<eos> First edition of Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Brazil!<eos> Well, it would be an understatement to say it was an incredible inaugural season of Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Terry and I have almost lost our voices, and if you guys think you have what it takes out there, well, I suggest you start training right now.
What's up, San Antonio?<eos> Oh, I'm so excited to be here!<eos> Thank you, guys, for coming out.
What's up, San Antonio?<eos> Oh, I'm so excited to be here!<eos> Thank you, guys, for coming out.<eos> I love San Antonio.<eos> I got here last night.<eos> And I asked this chick, "What do you guys do here for fun?"
I'm kidding.<eos> I love to vote.<eos> I do it, like, five, six times in an election.<eos> I love it that much.<eos> Am I the only one that just got tired of the election?<eos> The election we've had... 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<eos> I'm done. And you know what pissed me off?<eos> When I started hearing people say, "We need to go back to the good old days.<eos> We need to go back to the good old days."<eos> You ever notice it's only white people saying that shit?
He's making, like, an immigrant triathlon.<eos> First place is freedom!<eos> He's gonna build a wall.<eos> Doesn't he know we use tunnels now?<eos> Build that wall as high as you want, stupid.<eos> We're underground!<eos> We should help them.<eos> We should do a BYOB party - bring your own brick, and we just build it, like...<eos> Stupid!<eos> Did you guys see that dude?

Because now I'm an adult, right?<eos> I remember, when I was a kid, I used to love the song "You Got The Right Stuff" .<eos> And I'd love it because the lyric was like,<eos> "First kiss was a sweet kiss, second kiss had a twist."<eos> And I'm like, "Oh, my God.<eos> They're Frenching." Right?<eos> But I'm 33 at that point, so I'm like,<eos> "Third and the fourth kiss, we're doing it."<eos> "Those tickets were expensive, my friend got a babysitter, you gotta give me more."<eos> "You gotta hang tough and give me more."
It's because we hate vampires."<eos> You ever notice Latinos are the only ones that name their kids "Jesus"?<eos> "This is my son Jesus Rodriguez.<eos> He works at Papa John's."<eos> "Jesus has come a long way!"<eos> You never meet a white guy named Jesus.<eos> "Hi, I'm Jesus Rosenberg.<eos> I work at Goldman Sachs."<eos> It's insane.<eos> You guys ever notice that you always find out what you think of your friends when you can't remember their names?
Here's the thing.<eos> People don't understand, when you're a sports fan, when you have a team, that's your team.<eos> Those are your boys.<eos> Whether they suck or they're good, those are your boys, you know?<eos> People are passionate about sports.<eos> I'm from Texas.<eos> I like football.<eos> I love the Cowboys, right?<eos> Not everyone clapped.<eos> See, five minutes ago, you all loved me, but now...
It's like having a kid that's flunking math.<eos> You're like, "I'll cheer for the neighbor's kid.<eos> He's smart."<eos> You can't do that!<eos> You can't.<eos> You show up wearing a jersey, "Neighbor's kid, 82."<eos> What pisses me off about watching sports is the press conferences after the game.<eos> Do we have to interview them when they lose?<eos> Everybody wants to find out, "Why did you lose?<eos> Why did you lose?"
You can't.<eos> You show up wearing a jersey, "Neighbor's kid, 82."<eos> What pisses me off about watching sports is the press conferences after the game.<eos> Do we have to interview them when they lose?<eos> Everybody wants to find out, "Why did you lose?<eos> Why did you lose?"<eos> "Well, shit, the other team scored more.<eos> That's how it works."<eos> What a terrible time to get interviewed about stuff!<eos> Can you imagine if that happened to you?
My mom was like a die-hard Catholic woman.<eos> Like, she was super Catholic.<eos> She loved God but she hated people.<eos> In my neighborhood, we were always visited every weekend by the Jehovah's Witnesses, right?<eos> Every weekend.<eos> My mom couldn't stand it because she's like, "I'm team Catholic.<eos> Why are they trying to convert me?"<eos> And every day, they would come in. One day, they knocked. "Da-da-da."<eos> "Excuse me, ma'am. Have you found God?"<eos> She's like, "No, but if you find him, tell him we're fucking starving in here. Bye."
Woof!"<eos> "Perro woof!"<eos> Perro woof?<eos> How the hell does the dog have an accent?<eos> Perro woof?<eos> That's so crazy.<eos> Isn't it crazy to think how fast the year goes by?<eos> Every year, you get older, I feel like I can't believe we're already at this point.<eos> Like, you know? Every year goes by quicker and quicker.<eos> It's insane, you know?
"I am gonna start on Monday."<eos> And then Monday comes, I eat a doughnut, and I'm like, "Damn it!"<eos> "Now I gotta wait till next Monday!"<eos> I can't start on Tuesday!<eos> It's insane.<eos> I recently bought the Zumba DVDs.<eos> Now, there's a Zumba DVD set that comes with maracas.<eos> It's like the little weights, right? So you can keep the beat along with them.<eos> The other day, you guys, I popped it in.<eos> Oh, I wish you had been there, man.
"How is it outside, chicken?"<eos> "I wish I could be a cage-free kid, but..."<eos> "gangs."<eos> This chicken is expensive because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive?<eos> This chicken's $20 a pound because it played the cello and it liked to surf.<eos> That's an awesome chicken!<eos> Why are we eating it?<eos> If I had to eat something that had an awesome life and didn't do shit, screw the chicken, I'd eat a Kardashian.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Have you seen their butts?
Books, books, books.<eos> Most of us didn't read them but they were there.<eos> Now everything we've got is in our little phone, right there.<eos> Everything.<eos> Technology can be so amazing and it can be so terrible at times, you know?<eos> You know what pisses me off?<eos> It's great for kids.<eos> It sucks for me.<eos> It pisses me off that kids will never know the pain of having to save up money to buy a whole record album or CD for one song.<eos> Do you remember when you had to do chores?

It became the most depressing shower I've ever had!<eos> I was washing myself with my own tears!<eos> ♪ Fly away ♪<eos> ♪ From here ♪<eos> Why?<eos> The fucking puppy!<eos> San Antonio, I just wanna say thank you so much for coming tonight.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> It's a very special night for me.<eos> I'm glad you guys came out.
I wish I could.<eos> I can't bring it back.<eos> But thank you.<eos> That's my dad.<eos> "Mija, what did you say about the McRib?"<eos> I loved that show.<eos> That show...<eos> That show was really about a part of my life where I'd moved in with my sister, I helped take care of her kids and my mom, and it was very important for me to do that show.<eos> You might notice, in my stand-up, I talk a lot about my mom.<eos> And for me... if you saw the show, she was this very crotchety old woman.
Like, why the fuck does it glow in the dark?<eos> I keep a gallon of it in the fridge in case there's a power outage.<eos> I just take it out.<eos> I'm like, "Everybody follow the Tampico."<eos> "Everybody."<eos> It's like a highlighter you can drink.<eos> Tampico.<eos> The mom and the kid clean it up, then they have a dance party.<eos> My mom wasn't like that, you know?<eos> And, you know...

And if I could bargain with God... I would shorten my life so that you could have a longer one, and I would take care of you until you died and make sure that you had the happiest life ever."<eos> And she started crying.<eos> Which surprised me. I didn't know she could.<eos> And it was sad.<eos> At the same time, I thought,<eos> "How great is it that I got the chance to say that?<eos> How great is it that I had that last moment, that I got to tell her how I felt, how much I loved her... right before she died?"<eos> And then she didn't die.<eos> She didn't fucking die!<eos> Do you know how awkward the next day was?
That woman... lived for another year.<eos> And every day, she would make fun of me.<eos> And called me a pussy.<eos> For being so weak.<eos> Every day, "Cristela, I want a hamburger." "You can't have one.<eos> You're sick."<eos> "But you love me!"<eos> Thank you, guys, for coming, San Antonio!<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> You guys have been amazing!
Ten years ago, the animal population mutated, endangering human life on the planet.<eos> Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.<eos> In an attempt to return the planet to the animals, a secretive group called the Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity.<eos> And then labmade creatures called hybrids devastated the West coast.<eos> So a massive barrier was constructed, to protect the rest of North America, but new breeds have started to appear, so we reassembled our team.<eos> We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids and a brutal terrorist with a plan to end the human race.<eos> The fight for mankind's survival has just begun.<eos> Previously on Zoo...<eos> I want what you want...
Please, please.<eos> - You can't do this!<eos> - Stay behind the barricade, sir.<eos> I'm not gonna ask again.<eos> You're going to shoot me?<eos> For trying to get to my son?<eos> Do not take another step! - Stand down.<eos> - What are you doing? !<eos> Daddy!<eos> You are soldiers!

The person who attacked our camp.<eos> Logan ID'd her.<eos> Her name's Abigail Westbrook.<eos> He didn't get much else.<eos> Any idea where she is?<eos> 'Cause I need to hit something.<eos> Preferably one Abigail Westbrook.<eos> I plastered her photo at airports, train stations and the border.<eos> Chopper's on standby.<eos> You guys know this area better than anybody, so, the moment that we do get a hit on her, I'm hoping that you'll come with...
We need to get you to a hospital.<eos> Can you just answer my question, please? Red, - and blue, yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think there's pressure on the speech center of my brain, and I've got to find out what's causing it.<eos> - We got to get in there.<eos> - What do you mean, â€œget in thereâ€?<eos> I mean... get in there.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Are you really gonna perform brain surgery with that?<eos> Are you nuts?
Yeah.<eos> How are you here right now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, II know this place, but I've never been here before, and now you're here, and...<eos> Okay, and you.<eos> Jackson?<eos> Clementine?<eos> Logan?<eos> Well, this is more than a little weird.<eos> How are you all here?
- I swear I will... - Easy, easy, easy.<eos> If you want to call yourself Dylan and play hero in the badlands, be my guest, okay?<eos> I'm not here to change that.<eos> But as somebody who knows a thing or two about lying to the person that you love, the sooner that you come clean, the better.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dylan was just saying how lucky he is to have you.<eos> Is that so?<eos> You came an awful long way to hear about our love life.<eos> Look, I want what you want.

The bomber.<eos> Well, she knew my name.<eos> She was taunting me.<eos> Like it was personal.<eos> Because it is.<eos> I I.D.'ed the bomber with, uh, with DNA off of that disc that you guys found.<eos> Her name is Abigail Westbrook.<eos> This is her genetic profile.<eos> Okay.<eos> When I got the preliminary results, I just assumed you must've somehow contaminated the sample.
I'm walking over here."<eos> I love the city.<eos> Are you kidding me? New York!<eos> My dream was to come out here.<eos> Soon as I got here, I was like, "This is it!"<eos> There's an energy in the city that exists nowhere in the world.<eos> Love it, everything about it.<eos> You know what fascinates me about New York... is how much people trust the traffic lights.<eos> I have never seen anything like it.<eos> You must remember, I come from an African country.
But they still wanted it back.<eos> I saw people on the news, talking to the BBC.<eos> "That's why I'm voting for Brexit, right?<eos> Because this bloody country is going to the dogs.<eos> Right? This bloody country. And I want Britain back.<eos> That's why we voted for Brexit, because we want Britain back!"<eos> From who?<eos> From who?<eos> Britain is, like, 95% white.<eos> Who do you want it back from?
They come here. They bring their own bloody culture.<eos> They bring their own food, spit their own bloody languages, try to take over the whole bloody place."<eos> That sounds British to me.<eos> If there's one country... if there's one nation in the world,<eos> that has no right to complain about immigration, it's Great Britain.<eos> If there's one nation in particular.<eos> You do understand, they created the problem that they are now dealing with.<eos> They went out and colonized the world.<eos> At one point, half of the globe was controlled by the British Empire.<eos> Do you understand how insane that is?
That god, you... '<eos> Then I wonder why my prayers are not getting answered."<eos> "How dare you speak to me like that?<eos> Do you know who I am?"<eos> "No, because you never introduced yourself."<eos> "I have come here representing Great Britain."<eos> "And I have never heard of Great Britain.<eos> Who gave you that name?"<eos> "Well... well, we did."<eos> "You called yourselves 'great'?

If I was your doctor, I don't need X-ray machine.<eos> I go, 'What is problem?<eos> It is your kidney. How do I know? Because you're translucent.<eos> That is how I know.'"<eos> "Damn you! We are going to run this country whether you like it or not!"<eos> "We are not going to do anything you tell us. You're a madman."<eos> "We are going to take it!" "You're not taking... " "We're going..."<eos> "She's all yours.<eos> Take, take.<eos> You don't play nice.
"She's all yours.<eos> Take, take.<eos> You don't play nice.<eos> Take."<eos> And that's how the British took over.<eos> That's how they took over India.<eos> And then, many, many years later, the British, after they were done pillaging, left and went back home.<eos> And so, it only stands to reason that those Indians, who they had now made British, would seek out... the land from whence they came.<eos> I don't understand why British people are complaining, going, "Why are they coming here?<eos> Why the hell are you coming here? !"

I'm a big fan of 007.<eos> License to kill.<eos> I loved it my whole life. Started with Pierce Brosnan.<eos> Then went back and watch Connery's and Lazenby's and everyone, all the way to Daniel Craig.<eos> And I love James Bond.<eos> And when I found out that Daniel Craig no longer wanted to be James Bond, I was heartbroken.<eos> Until I heard... that, at the top of the list, the potential replacement was a man by the name Idris Elba.<eos> And I lost my mind.<eos> I lost my...<eos> You can hear the ladies.
He's got that quiet thing. "Yeah, you know, Idris Elba. Oh, yeah.<eos> Idris Elba, you know?" You could just see him playing the dapper spy.<eos> And as soon as it was announced, everyone was excited, until the comments section of the Internet came in.<eos> "Idris Elba, James Bond."<eos> And the comments section was like, "Uh, actually...<eos> Idris Elba could not play James Bond."<eos> And we're like, "Why?"<eos> They're like, "Because...<eos> "'Cause of the shape of his head?<eos> What are you saying?"
"'Cause of the shape of his head?<eos> What are you saying?"<eos> "No, because..."<eos> - "Because what?" - "Because he's black!<eos> James Bond cannot be played by a black man!"<eos> As soon as they said that, the Internet exploded.<eos> "Racism!"<eos> Immediately, that happened, I jumped in.<eos> I don't even know what it's about half of the time, I jump in.<eos> You say "racism," and I wreck my site. I'm just like, "Racism!
Idris Elba, James Bond, jumps off the bike, runs into a crowded town square, the bad guys right behind him.<eos> He manages to shake them off, pops into a little alley, gets out on the other side, finds a crowded little marketplace, puts a scarf around his head, a fake beard, blends in with a group of monks walking by.<eos> The bad guys turn the corner.<eos> "There he is!"<eos> James Bond manages to shake them off, gets into another group of areas, pops out on the other side, finds a transportation hub, gets into a bus, the bus goes one way, gets into a tram, the tram goes the other way.<eos> The bad guys turn the corner.<eos> "There he is!"<eos> The movie would be ten minutes long.<eos> It would end with James Bond panting in an alley.<eos> "How did you find me?"

Figured it was you."<eos> "What gave me away?<eos> Is it the way I dress?"<eos> "Oh, there's just something about you."<eos> "Something like what?"<eos> "You know...<eos> It'll be hard.<eos> Scotland was so much fun.<eos> Every day I was there, I felt like I was learning something new.<eos> I did learn something that I wish to share with you, and I hope you'll not suffer the same ills I did.

He was like, "A wee, little drink."<eos> I was like, "Let's have a wee, little drink." So I joined him.<eos> We went drinking.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I do remember waking up the next day in my bed, partially dressed, shirt on the floor.<eos> Pants still on.<eos> Left shoe on.<eos> Right shoe on the pillow beside me.<eos> And my head pounding, pounding.<eos> You know when you can hear you heart beating inside your head?
And my head pounding, pounding.<eos> You know when you can hear you heart beating inside your head?<eos> I get up and I'm like, "Oh, I feel horrible."<eos> And as I stand up...<eos> As I stand up, I could feel...<eos> I could feel... the vomit coming.<eos> I could feel it. I could feel it, like...<eos> It did that thing.<eos> But I held it. I controlled that.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, it's I don't throw up.
"I don't know why you're warning me. You never warn me usually when you burp.<eos> You just burp."<eos> "I wanted to let you know it's just a burp. Don't worry."<eos> I was like, "Okay, go ahead and burp."<eos> "Okay, here it comes." And my body was like...<eos> But then, I caught it in my mouth.<eos> I caught it all in my mouth, though.<eos> Oh, yeah. Judge me!<eos> Judge me.<eos> The only reason you know the taste is because you're alcoholics.
Judge me.<eos> The only reason you know the taste is because you're alcoholics.<eos> You're gonna judge me. We've all done that before.<eos> That's the classy thing to do.<eos> Catch it in your mouth, so you can handle your business in the toilet.<eos> Caught it all in my mouth. I ran to the toilet.<eos> I threw up, and it was the worst feeling in the world.<eos> I don't even drink.<eos> Throwing up is now an added reason to not...<eos> And, you know, when you're throwing up... the worst part for me is the dry heaving.
Many men in this room... Many, many men in this room have tales of how they once defeated the pussy.<eos> Let me tell you now, they have not.<eos> The owner of the pussy may have given you the impression that you defeated the pussy, but it is alive and well, my friends.<eos> Whenever people say that, I go, "Do you understand how impressive the vagina is?<eos> Do you understand how strong it is?"<eos> There's a reason men have sought to oppress it for so long.<eos> The vagina is frighteningly powerful.<eos> You realize human beings come out of a vagina.<eos> Human beings come out, and still it continues to work as intended.<eos> Do you understand how impressive that is?
Because everyone thought a man who had been in jail for 27 years couldn't make a joke.<eos> And yet, he still did.<eos> He still kept what was him.<eos> It was partly because of that voice.<eos> He would tell the joke, and it would just sound too epic for people to laugh.<eos> Everything he did, he'd just be like, "Ah, knock, knock."<eos> People would be like, "Let him in. Let him in!"<eos> "No.<eos> No, no.<eos> You must say, 'Who's there? '"
They do that thing when they speak. Strikes fear into the hearts of men.<eos> And you see it every single day.<eos> Look what happened at the Olympics.<eos> We found out the Russians have been doping for the last four or five Olympics.<eos> Olympic Committee banned them, confidently as well.<eos> While they were in Zurich.<eos> "We here at the Olympic Committee feel that the Russians may no longer participate in the Olympic Games to their doping practices.<eos> And they are now hereby uninvited from the Games in Rio and banned hitherto into the future.<eos> Thank you very much."<eos> And the Russians were like, "What did you say?"

I feel safe, like even if there's a monster under the bed, he'd be like, "Is that a Russian?"<eos> There's just something about that Russian accent.<eos> Ladies, every single one of you needs to learn the Russian accent.<eos> You read stories all the time. I talk to my female friends all the time, my family members, and women are constantly under assault.<eos> Women are living a life of being vulnerable.<eos> Walking through the streets, men catcalling.<eos> In the office place, people groping.<eos> Feeling like they have ownership of the female form.<eos> I know we can't solve this tomorrow, but if you learn the Russian accent, half of those problems would disappear.<eos> The next time you're in a compromising position, you're at a bar, waiting for your drink. That creepy guy comes up and starts grinding on you from behind.
As soon as he says, "Don't be such a bitch!" Just be like... "You want to see bitch?"<eos> Done.<eos> Sober up and walk away.<eos> Use it for anything, ladies.<eos> Anything.<eos> At work, in the streets.<eos> Use it at home.<eos> Doesn't have to be life-or-death, could be a mild annoyance.<eos> Next time you're in bed.<eos> You're trying to sleep, but you can't because there's this horny little rabbit behind you... dry-humping your back.

Baby, please. I promise you I'm not..."<eos> "You do this to me all the time.<eos> What am I supposed to do now?<eos> Look at me. Do you know how hard it is to have blue balls, how painful this is?<eos> What am I supposed to do now with this?"<eos> I love how guys talk about an erection like it's something bought at the store and we can't return.<eos> Then he says, "What am I supposed to do with this?<eos> I've opened it. I can't take it back. Huh?<eos> What am I supposed to do with this?"<eos> Whenever that happens, you aren't fighting the man, you're fighting his horniness.
I'm gonna be chilling.<eos> I had some stuff to do.<eos> Go back to bed.<eos> Because I respect you.<eos> I have paperwork that I'm handling in my office.<eos> If you need me, you know where to find me. He shouldn't have done that.<eos> I want to apologize, 'cause I don't think you should be in a situation where a man is pressuring you."<eos> Done.<eos> Kill it dead, ladies.<eos> All you need is that Russian accent.
That's all I hear when I hear Russian, like a DJ took a turntable.<eos> They're scratching English like, "Vlad, the guys got to be there at three o'clock.<eos> You got to let me know when you get the package.<eos> Afterwards, the guy's got to call me.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> No, Vlad.<eos> Listen, Vlad.<eos> Russian. That's all I'm hearing.<eos> New York, you guys have been amazing.

Yes, probably.<eos> But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?<eos> Can I get anyone anything at all?<eos> Raj, you don't have to serve us.<eos> It's the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.<eos> It was really no problem.<eos> Not for you, Box of Towels.<eos> Anyway, thanks again.<eos> Hey, look at that.<eos> You've got a Raj, we've got a Stuart.
Oh, good grief.<eos> She is such a stickler for citing sources.<eos> Those were Amy's words.<eos> Sheldon...<eos> I know, I know!<eos> "Good grief" was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.<eos> You're right, I am humiliated.<eos> Thanks for pointing it out.<eos> You're such a jerk.<eos> Can you believe this guy?
Maybe moving in was a bad idea.<eos> I haven't been here one day, I'm already causing problems.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> It's Sheldon.<eos> "You didn't do anything.<eos> It's Sheldon."<eos> That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.<eos> So, relax.<eos> We're happy to have you.<eos> Thank you, but how do I know you're not saying that just to be nice?
Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she's stuffed.<eos> Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.<eos> Thank you. I appreciate that.<eos> No, I can't take all the credit.<eos> I spoke with Leonard's mother, and she made me feel better.<eos> I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.<eos> Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.
We do seem to keep finding roommates.<eos> Now you're taking her side?<eos> Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard.<eos> That's for your parade of roommates to do.<eos> Howard?<eos> Howard!<eos> It's me!<eos> It's just me!<eos> What are you doing here? !<eos> Well, I texted you, but you didn't respond.
Maybe I was onto something.<eos> Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.<eos> Unless it was singing "Be Our Guest," I doubt it.<eos> Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it.<eos> Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?<eos> The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon?<eos> You didn't get any food.<eos> He does raise an interesting point.<eos> Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.<eos> Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I'll wait.
I mean, he's surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.<eos> I don't want to speak for Leonard.<eos> Thank you. I...<eos> But when you're insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.<eos> You know, you're really sensitive about this kind of stuff.<eos> I'm a good listener.<eos> (chuckles) Yeah.<eos> Hey, Olsen twins...<eos> What?<eos> Well, I-I mean, I'm sitting right here. You're talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.
And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Sheldon, I didn't expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.<eos> You know, I felt the same way about the spork.<eos> Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil?<eos> That'll never work.<eos> Spoiler: works.<eos> I got to admit, we didn't think you'd be able to do two things at once.<eos> Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus.<eos> You know, bird and mammal in the same creature?
The notebook isn't in the bathroom.<eos> I can't find it, either.<eos> How can he not remember a day?<eos> Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time.<eos> I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.<eos> (door opens)<eos> Well, it's not across the hall.<eos> That's it. I'm in breach of my security clearance.<eos> I'm going to prison.<eos> And you know what happens to people like me in prison.
I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> See?<eos> It was fine.<eos> I didn't need a time-out.<eos> It wasn't a time-out. Let's get some food.<eos> You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.<eos> Get your food!<eos> So how did you two meet?
I made a huge mistake.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Okay?<eos> Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren't right for me.<eos> And then I gave up my money, and now I'm alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.<eos> Look, sweetie, relationships aren't about money, okay?<eos> It's about respect and having things in common and...<eos> Yes, Sheldon?<eos> You and Leonard don't have anything in common.<eos> Maybe you should break up.
on the bottom of their kid's foot.<eos> You realize they called when you took her.<eos> Guess who's home from the aquarium?<eos> Sorry again for barging in.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> You're welcome to hang with us.<eos> Actually, our friendship group is at capacity.<eos> But if anybody drops out, you're at the top of the list.<eos> Unless it's Raj, in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.<eos> You guys are nice, but I'm just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.
Our village is inside the perimeter up ahead.<eos> We'll be fine once we get back there.<eos> Perimeter.<eos> That's the one place the Safeguard can't enter.<eos> We don't know why, though.<eos> See, that's the perimeter up ahead.<eos> Stop!<eos> Zuru, get away from him!<eos> Sutezo, wait!<eos> Why are you all showing your faces?
Who is this guy?<eos> Mr. Killy rescued us.<eos> He's human!<eos> Human?<eos> He can't be.<eos> Human, you say?<eos> Isn't he a Safeguard?<eos> I've heard there are Safeguards that look just like humans.<eos> Right, Pops.<eos> Just three of you, huh?
He can't be.<eos> Human, you say?<eos> Isn't he a Safeguard?<eos> I've heard there are Safeguards that look just like humans.<eos> Right, Pops.<eos> Just three of you, huh?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The Exterminators...<eos> That's why we told you, Zuru, you guys can't do it on your own!<eos> But then you went and took that gear without our permission anyway.
Pops and Sutezo brought the kids back!<eos> How many kids?<eos> All of them?<eos> I'm not exactly sure.<eos> And there's someone strange with them.<eos> What do you mean, someone strange?<eos> Well...<eos> Welcome back, Pops.<eos> Pops.<eos> Just you guys?
I'm not exactly sure.<eos> And there's someone strange with them.<eos> What do you mean, someone strange?<eos> Well...<eos> Welcome back, Pops.<eos> Pops.<eos> Just you guys?<eos> Where are the other three?<eos> And their gear?<eos> Did you leave that, too?
What do you mean, someone strange?<eos> Well...<eos> Welcome back, Pops.<eos> Pops.<eos> Just you guys?<eos> Where are the other three?<eos> And their gear?<eos> Did you leave that, too?<eos> What about the helmettals?<eos> Weren't you at least able to bring the helmettals back?
- This'll give you energy.<eos> Pops, Sutezo.<eos> Pops.<eos> Tae.<eos> Here.<eos> This much?<eos> There's some for your sister.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Zuru, Fusata.<eos> I'm glad you're back.
If you take me to the automated factory, I'll make you a synthetic terminal that has the same effect as the Net Terminal Gene.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> But it's true.<eos> That thing there... that's actually the wreckage of a synthetic terminal that I made.<eos> There's a connection port beneath it.<eos> When we found a connection port to the NetSphere here, we surrounded the area with an electric barrier to keep the Safeguard from invading, and started experiments.<eos> To keep the Safeguard from invading?<eos> The experiments were successful.<eos> We got all the way to the entrance to the Authority.<eos> But then we were found by their defense mechanisms... and you can see what happened.

We got all the way to the entrance to the Authority.<eos> But then we were found by their defense mechanisms... and you can see what happened.<eos> Did you... communicate with the Authority?<eos> No, we couldn't.<eos> But we analyzed information coming through the counter-current and found a channel we can use to get in.<eos> So, given another chance, I can definitely succeed.<eos> I have no idea... what she's talking about.<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Yes?<eos> Just now, you said you did something to keep the Safeguard from invading, right?

It won't be long before we make a decision to leave the perimeter or stay inside and starve.<eos> So... don't you think it's worth taking a chance?<eos> That may be so... but if we go east for 15 blocks... the batteries in our gear probably won't even last long enough... and we can't get that far without being caught by the Safeguard.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> No matter how strong this man is, there's no guarantee that even he could reach that far alone.<eos> But if we can help him, even a little...<eos> True. It might be better to have more people with us.<eos> But we'll need to take food along for the trip and there's already so little left.<eos> At the automated factory we can make anything.<eos> If we get there I'll make you anything you want.

I never had a problem to begin with.<eos> Shut up and walk.<eos> Pair up and get in a circular formation.<eos> - Don't leave much space between you. - Yes, sir.<eos> There was no need for you to come along, Tae.<eos> My sister's doing better thanks to the food that Killy gave us.<eos> I need to repay him.<eos> And also, wherever Zuru goes... I go with her.<eos> Tae.<eos> Things must be desperate for you to be bringing these children along.
And that's where we found it.<eos> Along our journey... one, then another of us died.<eos> Even the ones who managed to reach there, during the experiment they all...<eos> I'm sure Kaito is gone now, too.<eos> The automated factory is through here.<eos> Pops.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No one who's gone this way has ever come back.<eos> They must have been caught by the defense net.<eos> But with me and Killy here, you'll be okay.
What have you got there?<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I snuck a peek.<eos> No. The scene where Adelle confronts Hustings. Mm.<eos> Oh, my goodness, the drama.<eos> You like that, do you?<eos> "You don't understand us at all.

Well, that's a relief.<eos> I'm surrounded by too many artists as it is.<eos> You know, Rose, I always thought of you as more of a people person.<eos> Like you, Pat?<eos> Will you be home for dinner tonight?<eos> I wouldn't wait.<eos> I've got drinks with Sally Sweet's manager.<eos> Not an easy woman, that one.<eos> That's not what I heard.<eos> Have you seen this?
Bad timing.<eos> There's still a depression.<eos> Didn't you have your fill of that at the party?<eos> You know, I had the perfect moment with Mayer as we were walking out... about Margo Taft.<eos> Left him speechless.<eos> Tell it to Bess Burrows.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> No?<eos> You and Mayer humiliate your wives.<eos> You fuck the women who work for you, and pretend they want you, and then cower to the Nazis.
It's a career-altering story, I would say.<eos> From whom?<eos> Uh, Louella never tells.<eos> Somebody from long ago who became indiscreet after the woman died.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Don't ask her that.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just that Louella wants to publish.<eos> And you know Louella.
[Guillermo del Toro] The idea of propaganda filmmaking is to propagate, to disseminate ideas.<eos> Each of the five men that we're talking about goes at it differently.<eos> You have John Ford, who approaches it on a mythical, epic scale.<eos> You have John Huston going at it almost like an adventure.<eos> Wyler and Stevens approach it from an incredibly human point of view.<eos> And their experiences are different from Capra, who approaches it very much as a concept problem-solving point of view.<eos> When the immensity of World War II comes in, he is given to a single sentiment:<eos> Why we fight.<eos> [man] From millions of feet of film confiscated from the enemy or donated by American film companies, these men are preparing pictures to set the war record straight and to counteract enemy propaganda.<eos> [second male voiceover] Scream you're abused, shout you're oppressed.

[explosions]<eos> Official pictures made by the United States Marine Corps.<eos> [narrator] In September, John Huston's last film before reporting for duty was released.<eos> You probably don't share my enthusiasm for the Japanese.<eos> I don't know. I never thought much about them.<eos> [Francis Ford Coppola] Across the Pacific is a kind of early propaganda Hollywood film against the new enemies we were going to be facing.<eos> You guys have been looking for a war, haven't you?
[Steven Spielberg] Nothing like World War II has ever happened to give us any idea of why... there was such solidarity.<eos> I think everybody could see that Western civilization was at stake and they needed to fight or die.<eos> [Paul Greengrass] When you strip away all the glitz and the glamour of Hollywood, what you're left with is:<eos> what is the witness that you're giving to the world that you see out there?<eos> [Lawrence Kasdan] John Ford and George Stevens were chosen by Eisenhower to land in the invasion on D-Day.<eos> And they gathered around them a large group of cameramen and soundmen to make the landing.<eos> That means you know you're going to sacrifice some of those men.<eos> There was no protected place from which to film the invasion of Normandy.<eos> You are about to embark upon the great crusade toward which we have striven these many months.

He had regained about 20 percent of his hearing in one ear, and Gregg Toland, his cinematographer, helped to rig an audio amplifier that would allow Wyler to hear his actors.<eos> I've made pictures for over 40 years.<eos> There was one that was particularly close to me because it was done right after the war.<eos> Most of the films are fictional, you know, are fictional stories, and didn't really involve me.<eos> But since I was in the service during the war, right after the war, I made a film called The Best Years of Our Lives.<eos> [applause] That film gave me a great deal of satisfaction because it contributed something to the social life of the time.<eos> It made people understand veterans better.<eos> [Spielberg] William Wyler came back from the war and suddenly saw, based on his knowledge of what war does to people.<eos> He went back and he made a movie, the greatest movie, arguably, of his entire career.<eos> You'll probably have a long ride because she's making a lot of stops, but you'll get there tomorrow afternoon.
[Wyler] Being a veteran, I knew the subject matter.<eos> I didn't have to do much research about these people returning from the war.<eos> I knew how they felt, I knew what they were thinking of.<eos> Because I was one of them.<eos> [Spielberg] You know, he stripped that whole production down to just its bare essentials.<eos> He didn't want to have fancy dolly shots. He didn't want a camera to go from room to room.<eos> [narrator] Wyler wanted the movie to be realistic in every detail.<eos> He didn't want the help of a costume designer for his two lead actresses Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright.<eos> He gave them money to buy their wardrobes off the rack at a department store.<eos> "You're all gonna do this for yourselves.
[narrator] The failure of It's a Wonderful Life put Liberty Films out of business.<eos> The company never made another movie.<eos> We sold Liberty Films to Paramount. We also sold our contracts to Paramount.<eos> That kind of soured me on the whole thing, so I said, "Maybe I should just lay off for a while."<eos> So, I went down to my ranch and said, "I'm just going to quit for a while."<eos> [narrator] Capra directed just a few more pictures before retiring in 1961.<eos> [Coppola] Each of these five directors who went through the war, some were shot at, Ford was wounded,<eos> Wyler lost his hearing, and they saw terrible things and participated in terrible things, and yet, coming out of it, each one made possibly their greatest film.<eos> Huston came out, and the first film he made after his military service was The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.<eos> You're so dumb, there's nothing to compare you with!

Corny Riddle wants to see us in my office at 10:30 tonight.<eos> He's flying in.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe we should ask that pinheaded son of his.<eos> Hello, Clint.<eos> Hello, Bess.<eos> Hey, Monroe.<eos> Mr. Brady. Mm-hmm.<eos> After tonight, you're gonna have two new stars, Monroe.
I mean, I promised my father I'd go to his preview tonight.<eos> Celia, without the people you're about to meet, your father wouldn't have any previews.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Jesus Christ, Dell.<eos> It's got no life at all.<eos> I know.<eos> That close-up of Clint in the dinner scene. Look...<eos> Didn't you have any takes where he wasn't so awful?<eos> That was his best, by a mile.<eos> Well, couldn't you play the scene off of Bess? Or Carter?
He's right.<eos> Crazy me, I figured a guy as rich as Harry Cohn... yeah, I will say it out loud... would be decent enough to help his injured employees.<eos> And I said the word the bigwigs all hate...<eos> Here we go. So, he sent his goons out to rearrange my face a little.<eos> 'Cause he figures that'll scare us all off.<eos> Bastards.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> You heard him, let's go!
- Dad, do you want a water?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Put some ice and some Jim Beam in there, too.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> - What's Heather doing here?<eos> - Oh, uh... she left some presents here for her nephew.<eos> Uh, so he wouldn't find them.<eos> Lie to your mother on Christmas.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I hope, whatever it was, you were done, 'cause she's leaving.
She says it "doesn't fit."<eos> Okay, you know what? The cigarette was mine.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> No sweater and you smoke. Merry Christmas, Janice.<eos> Look, if we could all exhale before we get in my new Lincoln, that'd be great.<eos> All right, I'll grab my scarf and we can go.<eos> You don't need your scarf.<eos> The MKX has heated seats.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> You go to church one day a year, the least you could do is be on time.
Ma.<eos> That reminds me, we're having dinner with him on Tuesday.<eos> Oh, y'all still hang out with Kenny.<eos> That's... great.<eos> Dad just likes the pork chops at the Marriott and Kenny always throws in a free baked potato and lets Mom play the piano in the lobby.<eos> Hey, Colt!<eos> Saved you guys seats.<eos> Great.<eos> We'll all sit together.<eos> Mom, Dad, you remember Colt's mom, Maggie, and his brother, Rooster? Oh.
We're all in this together.<eos> You, me, Zukor, Cohn, pain in the ass Warner Brothers.<eos> We're building something, together.<eos> And I'm sure, if I were in your shoes and you were in my shoes, you'd be generous with me.
You, me, Zukor, Cohn, pain in the ass Warner Brothers.<eos> We're building something, together.<eos> And I'm sure, if I were in your shoes and you were in my shoes, you'd be generous with me.<eos> It was an act of real friendship.<eos> Irving here thinks I should tell the two of you to go jump in the lake, and as we know, boy geniuses are never wrong.<eos> Oh, you'd be surprised.<eos> So, yes to your Angels on the Avenue reshoot, yes to the Brinel picture and yes to Sally Sweet.<eos> And we'll get you Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg to help with the songs.<eos> Right. But no, to Bess Burrows playing Sally's aunt.<eos> You don't want whores.

Max?<eos> I'm not "Miss Brady" all of a sudden.<eos> I'm still Celia from Wardrobe.<eos> If you say so.<eos> I'm trying to learn how the world works.<eos> It won't happen if people treat me like the boss's kid.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I be the boss's kid?<eos> She had a lot of time on her hands, but she used it wisely.<eos> You know what I mean.
Any of them will do.<eos> Box office bonuses.<eos> Directors with their peckers out.<eos> It ain't the glove business, that's for sure.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Poor Red.<eos> Poor Red.<eos> Monroe.<eos> You have to protect me.<eos> I'm the best gagman you have.
Thank you all.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> That was exciting, wasn't it?<eos> Thank you, guys.<eos> Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax.<eos> I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week.<eos> It's been great here.<eos> You know what? It's been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine.<eos> I know! I know, I've been gone for a very long time.<eos> And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years.

I know, I've been gone for a very long time.<eos> And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years.<eos> I'm not gonna take you through all the agony I've been through, but it was tough.<eos> Some of it you might've seen.<eos> I don't know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline:
I said, "Excuse me?"<eos> She said, "I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!"<eos> And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up.<eos> "Yeah!"<eos> The whole crowd banded together and started chanting,<eos> "We want our money back! We want our money back!"<eos> I said, "Oh, shit." I snapped out of it.<eos> "Good people of Detroit, hear me.<eos> Hear me now.<eos> You will never get your fucking money back."
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time.<eos> And I wanted to give up sometimes.<eos> I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to.<eos> But I made the call. They answered the phone.<eos> "Hello?<eos> Dancing with the Stars."<eos> I said, "Not yet.<eos> Not yet."<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you see me on that shit, it's over.
I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, "Hey, OJ Simpson's here, and he said he wants to meet you."<eos> I said, "What?<eos> Fuck yeah!" I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there.<eos> He's like, "Hey, young man.<eos> How are you?<eos> It's very good to meet you.<eos> And you're doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life."<eos> I was like, "Man, thanks, Mr. Juice."<eos> Standing beside him, was... I don't know the nice way to say this... his soon-to-be-slain wife.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you're not gonna make it to the end of this show.
We don't know who did it, but we know what happened.<eos> I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me.<eos> She actually embraced me.<eos> She said, "I think you're adorable," and she hugged me.<eos> She goes, "Good luck to you," and she held me for a long time.<eos> And I whispered in her ear, "Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?"<eos> I didn't say that, but... that was the first time, in a nutshell.<eos> It's good to see so many... so many different people here from so many different ethnicities.<eos> Very diverse crowd.<eos> Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker.

Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you know, I'm happy, really, to see black people come.<eos> A lot of black people don't fuck with me like they used to.<eos> But there's a few reasons you don't see black people at my shows.<eos> One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections.<eos> I mean, that would be my guess.<eos> I don't know what...<eos> Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.<eos> A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous.
What am I gonna do about that water?<eos> What am I, a fucking superhero?<eos> I need to have fun.<eos> I need to live, too!<eos> I didn't fuck that water up!<eos> Stevie Wonder was there.<eos> They didn't need me.<eos> I'm sorry, everybody.<eos> I'd never been to the Oscars.<eos> You've seen the movies I make.
Now, in the gay community's defense,<eos> Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won't repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals.<eos> It wasn't a good look.<eos> Nike took his shoes immediately.<eos> Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean?<eos> Just 'cause he's Asian.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude?<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No? You don't know what I mean.
She's Filipino.<eos> All right, okay. So, that explains it.<eos> Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events.<eos> I'm not there picking up pussy. I'm dropping some off.<eos> I take my wife to all that shit.<eos> I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather.<eos> We sat ringside, okay?<eos> That...<eos> Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that's what that was.<eos> But if you know what's popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes.
"Stewart, what's all the beef, man?<eos> What's going..."<eos> He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument.<eos> The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words "husband and wife" out of the law.<eos> I said, "Why would you want those words out of the law?"<eos> He said, "Because it discriminates against same-sex couples."<eos> I was like, "Niggas, please, save me the semantics.<eos> Just trust me.<eos> Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino.<eos> You're about to crap out!
I'm sorry, guys.<eos> I'm 42. I remember Bruce Jenner.<eos> Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> He was beating Africans at track and field.<eos> We'd never seen anything like it.<eos> He was on my cereal box growing up.<eos> You know how much of that cereal I ate?<eos> Nigga, I didn't know he was gonna do that.<eos> I knew before you guys knew.
I knew before you guys knew.<eos> I heard things on the street in Hollywood.<eos> You'd just be out, see people.<eos> "Hey, what's up, Kanye?<eos> Why the long face?"<eos> "Nigga, you'll see.<eos> I got two mother-in-laws now."<eos> And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared.<eos> I didn't think the public was ready. I didn't think the media was ready.<eos> And you know what?
Can't we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something?<eos> You sure that's what you want to do?" "There's only way to find out, nigga.<eos> Wu-Tang!<eos> Let's go to the club and trick niggas into fucking us. Yeah."<eos> The third time I met OJ Simpson...<eos> The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life.<eos> I'd just finished the second season of Chappelle's Show.<eos> Man, those were good days.<eos> I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv.<eos> I don't know if you've ever been, but if you have, you'd know the door for the green room is right on the stage.

But I did my show. The show went great.<eos> I said, "Good night, everyone." They all said, "Yay!"<eos> And I didn't say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there.<eos> And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there!<eos> I was like, "How the fuck is this possible?"<eos> I was scared.<eos> And then my friends came in, and we all started talking.<eos> We sat down on the couch.<eos> And I'm just telling you what I saw with my own eyes.<eos> You can believe me or not believe me.
But it's good to see you again, and I'm glad things went so well."<eos> I said, "Thanks, Juice."<eos> And my friends said, "Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice."<eos> They were new to the game.<eos> He said, "No. Thank you... for your hospitality.<eos> Good night, guys."<eos> And we said, "Good night." And he just walked out of the room.<eos> And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like,<eos> "That nigga did that shit.<eos> Did you feel that?

And he just walked out of the room.<eos> And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like,<eos> "That nigga did that shit.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> I could feel like... murder in the room."<eos> Well, you young heads missed that shit.<eos> You're all too young. You don't remember that.
A dark time to you.<eos> I'm from a time that I didn't even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit.<eos> Like, when tragedy used to strike.<eos> I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom.<eos> You remember these days?<eos> And she turned it on to one of three channels.<eos> And she said, "Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we're all gonna watch it take off."<eos> Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes.<eos> That's right.<eos> You remember.
And she said, "Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we're all gonna watch it take off."<eos> Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes.<eos> That's right.<eos> You remember.<eos> It fucking exploded!<eos> Right on television.<eos> Everybody on board, dead.<eos> Immediately presumed dead.<eos> It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like...<eos> "You can go home."
They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, "No" and "Shut the fuck up" and "I don't feel like it."<eos> And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public.<eos> They fucked up.<eos> They tested it for 12 years.<eos> They didn't realize these drugs were not mind-controlling.<eos> They were mind-expanding.<eos> It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that.<eos> And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in.<eos> By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old.<eos> Can you imagine?
She was a young white woman.<eos> Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through.<eos> "Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?"<eos> She didn't get it.<eos> She just kept going. "Women suffer!"<eos> "I know."<eos> "Women suffer!" "Same team."<eos> "Women suffer!" "I know."<eos> And this is when she went too far:<eos> "We suffer just like you."

You suffer, I suffer.<eos> You suffer, I suffer.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> Can't do comparative suffering.<eos> If you're hungry, and your friend says, "You know, people are starving in Africa,"<eos> "So what, nigga?<eos> I still want lunch."<eos> Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it's a fucking dead-end game.<eos> Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time.<eos> You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person?

And she doesn't know what it feels like to think that your hero might've done something so heinous, my God, you can't imagine.<eos> It'd be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself... had raped 54 people.<eos> You'd say to yourself, "Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream.<eos> I don't want it to rape."<eos> Didn't want to believe it.<eos> At first, I didn't believe it.<eos> I said, "These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby's rich legacy."<eos> Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, "Man... he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people."<eos> I know, I know. But it's really tough.<eos> You guys are young.

This is a terrible area."<eos> I'm like, "Actually, I live around here.<eos> My son just wanted to meet him real quick."<eos> "I don't know, 'cause Kevin's about to eat dinner."<eos> Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was.<eos> "What?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> What's up, Dave?<eos> Come on back.<eos> I was just about to have dinner. I don't know if you guys ate, but you're welcome to join me if you'd like."
I also remember that he's the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately.<eos> I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night.<eos> And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show.<eos> I'm telling you, that's no small thing.<eos> I've had a television show.<eos> I wouldn't have done that shit.<eos> He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college.<eos> Not just the ones he raped.<eos> Here comes the kicker.<eos> You ready?

Good to see you guys.<eos> Hey, come on, guys.<eos> Let's all get together for a picture."<eos> And at the same time, me and Chris were like, "No.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you."<eos> That's the end.<eos> Good night.<eos> One last thing.<eos> Before you go, I just wanted to acknowledge for the real comedy fans.
That's not possible.<eos> It's light outside.<eos> We need breakfast.<eos> Nathan, why do you have to be so loud?<eos> And lunch. For school.<eos> What time is school?<eos> Never.<eos> Darla...<eos> I told your brother I would look out for you.<eos> You have to go to school.
Places, people.<eos> I told Nathan a roast beef sandwich wasn't really breakfast food, but he really wanted it, so...<eos> What's this?<eos> I had some groceries sent over this morning.<eos> The kids didn't have much to take to school.<eos> Thought I'd set up a weekly delivery for you, just until you got back on your feet.<eos> Max?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on.<eos> You needed food, I got you food.

Next week? Every week?<eos> If that's what you need.
Now, we know that you're upset, but we've worked it all out.<eos> John's gonna do the revisions.<eos> What?<eos> He can't write, he can barely talk!<eos> Sally.<eos> Aunt Bernadette is the only person who can write for me.<eos> She's the only person who understands this movie.<eos> There's a whole crew of people here...<eos> I want Aunt Bernadette!<eos> You can't just arbitrarily decide. Would you just listen to yourself, Monroe?

The grips, costumers, drivers.<eos> That's who we're standing up for.<eos> Aubrey, please, allow me.<eos> No, allow me, Mr. Brimmer.<eos> We do compensate our writers, better than any other shop in town.<eos> Right?<eos> No?<eos> See, my problem with you is, a walkout wouldn't cost you a dime, but it would hurt their careers immeasurably and shut down this lot.<eos> And for what?<eos> You just robbed your entire workforce of a living wage.
I was Minna, wasn't I?<eos> Yes, you were.<eos> Mr. Stahr?<eos> There's a saying, in Yiddish.<eos> "A man no longer needs a mirror once he has had a son."<eos> My Irving. My boychik.<eos> He was the perfect partner, the perfect friend.<eos> An inspiration, a born storyteller, sometimes a taskmaster.<eos> He was a movie man.<eos> But you will never see his name on a single picture of ours.
I don't think that'd be a good idea.<eos> We all have to suffer for our art, Monroe.<eos> Tell him, Louis.<eos> I also dropped in on a Sally Sweet rehearsal.<eos> And?<eos> Fine.<eos> Shirley Temple shouldn't lose any sleep over her.<eos> And, would it kill you to jazz up the script a little?<eos> It's a bit trite, no?<eos> Which reminds me, what do you two think of color?
In here?<eos> I don't know. I don't think we did so badly by you, darling.<eos> Thought you were learning plenty at Bennington.<eos> Oh, everyone at Bennington's an idiot.<eos> Mother?<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> You only get one father, Celia.<eos> The Langs of the world will come and go.<eos> And so will Monroe.<eos> You don't understand.
You really should read it.<eos> Cut it, cut it.<eos> That was better.<eos> Better.<eos> Still, it's still missing something.<eos> What's that, Monroe?<eos> Joy.<eos> Joy. The picture's about kindness.<eos> How it saves one man, then one family, then a whole neighborhood, and maybe the world.<eos> Pretend you're singing to your kid, or your little brother, or the widow next door.
Thank you.<eos> It's going great, Pat.<eos> Dell tells me you're on take 20.<eos> That is art for art's sake.<eos> Still wearing that watch, I see.<eos> I have to know what time it is, don't I?<eos> Maybe you should give it to my daughter so she'll know not to stay out all night with that German pervert you sold her on.<eos> You are gonna get off my back at some point, aren't you?<eos> You need to understand something:<eos> You... are all mine.

I've always hated that song.
I wish I could say so. The evening numbers any better?<eos> If we're gonna talk about that, I'm gonna need a real drink.<eos> Uh, I'll get it, Annie Mae.<eos> It's, uh... it's been a long night.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> I don't either.<eos> This is our family Christmas. Of course it is.<eos> Mother, it's Darla.<eos> Max is in the hospital.<eos> You guys don't like candy, do you?
We need to talk.<eos> I know you read the letters.<eos> Please, let's get started.<eos> Would everyone please put their glasses on?<eos> My work is rooted in Ilinx.<eos> In video games, Ilinx provokes the feeling of being pulled into a circling cyclone.<eos> What did you think of the writing?<eos> They're just a rough-- a rough first draft.<eos> Haven't had a chance to polish it.<eos> You are all wild stallions.

What? He said I was uninteresting.<eos> Well- - Well, he's wrong.<eos> He's just wrong.<eos> I mean, you-- you are a fascinating woman with a wild intelligence.<eos> I know.<eos> So, come on, let's go home, drink three bottles of wine, and forget all about today, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> Where you all going?
I did.<eos> - Yeah, I thought you died. - Dick:<eos> Working on it.<eos> Paula: Hey.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck happened?<eos> Uh, rehearsal got, you know, intense.<eos> - We were kind of just like...<eos> - [sigh] ...talking about, like, reading these letters and talking about cunt-red stuff, and Toby just kind of...<eos> You said you were just going to have a meeting, sit around and talk.
As he listed off these parts of me, my mind began to wander to those parts that remained unmentioned:<eos> my nose, my bush, my tits.<eos> After college, my best friend Liza and I wanted to fuck a rock star.<eos> We finally caught one.<eos> He took us back to his room at the Chelsea Hotel.<eos> We told him we wanted to fuck him as if we were one person:<eos> her body, my mind, a living representation of the Louise Bourgeois sculpture "The Couple".<eos> This is Louise Bourgeois.<eos> We wanted to act out the Cyborgian split projected onto every woman in this culture.<eos> You're weird.
Take it outside, man.<eos> ♪ And I like my new role Yo. You guys have to come see this.<eos> ♪ This is not a love song Thanks, darlin'<eos> - [sighs] - Oh, good Lord.<eos> You two-- [chuckles] you made quite the splash.
- You gotta go talk to her. - I gotta go talk to her?<eos> You're the one who fuckin' drove her here.<eos> - Watching, witnessing--<eos> - Looks like some kind of art thing.<eos> Eyes that won't look away.<eos> I offer my body, my visibility, my privilege.<eos> I invite an open dialog.<eos> Don't look away.<eos> More importantly, look at yourselves.<eos> Look at what you are doing.

This is a serious invasion of my privacy.<eos> - Yeah. - Where the fuck is she? Hm?<eos> Uh, we decided to take some space.<eos> Look, I know that Chris can be a little impulsive, but, I mean, this--<eos> You can no longer continue at the institute,<eos> - that is clear. - Oh, no, whoa, whoa, come on, no, please.<eos> You and your wife need to stay the hell away from me.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I want you to know I had nothing to do with writing those letters.<eos> I don't give a shit what you do in the privacy of your marriage behind closed doors, but I will not be dragged into this.
Where?<eos> At your house.<eos> About what?<eos> About... About this.<eos> What did he say?<eos> What exactly did he say?<eos> He said,<eos> "I want you to fuck my wife."<eos> He sent you here to fuck me? He sent you here to fuck me.<eos> So you guys... You had a... There's a deal?
I don't know.<eos> But now we're here, pivoting around the same woman.<eos> I could write on and on about my history with Chris, but it would matter little.<eos> That would just be a diversion.<eos> I guess there is a chance... [gasp]<eos> Just tell her.<eos> [chuckle] Tell me what?<eos> Oh, I'm your abortion.<eos> And I'm your miscarriage.<eos> Are you fucking with me?
You?<eos> Isn't that what you usually do? Yeah.<eos> I do that when I don't want to attend things.<eos> Listen, then you can join Even and me helping with the wrapping up?<eos> That sounds like so much fun, but I am super busy.<eos> Are the girls upstairs? Sure.<eos> Sana, can you tell Vilde that I miss her? What?<eos> No, they don't do that. Does it work that way with girls?<eos> You are cute together.<eos> Yeah. We are cuter tan you two.
Chris told me that.<eos> Should I tell her?<eos> Of course you have to tell her!<eos> But, shouldn't William be the one to tell her?<eos> Yeah, but obviously he hasn't told her.<eos> But I don't know for sure if it's true.<eos> Also, I don't understand the thing between William and Noora.<eos> Are they together?<eos> What's up?<eos> What are you talking about?
Have you tried it?<eos> No.<eos> You and William, no...<eos> Vilde.<eos> No.<eos> At the subject of William.<eos> How is he?<eos> Fine...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We don't understand what's the thing between you two.
Not far away. Should we go there before we head to my place?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think the best solution is to find Noora a new boy.<eos> So that she falls in love and can forget about William.<eos> Well, she likes bad boys.<eos> Do we know any?<eos> We should look for a bad boy. Jonas and Mahdi! It would be so fun if any of you got together with any of them.<eos> Really?<eos> No, Vilde.<eos> I just think it's so boring that I am the only one with a boyfriend, because I have to be with Magnus when you hang out together.
I didn't follow you.<eos> Trishanakru needed me.<eos> I can't move.<eos> I can't feel my legs.<eos> Take my life.<eos> No.<eos> You said next time you saw me...<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You promised.<eos> I should've known you two couldn't stay away.
I can't move.<eos> I can't feel my legs.<eos> Take my life.<eos> No.<eos> You said next time you saw me...<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You promised.<eos> I should've known you two couldn't stay away.<eos> I heard you all the way down the street.<eos> You're lucky I wasn't a scout.
I take it by your presence here that your sister's still alive.<eos> That's right.<eos> If I call for a scout, she'll be executed right now...<eos> But what fun would that be?<eos> You really think she can win, don't you?<eos> I wouldn't count her out if I were you.<eos> She's survived harder things than this.<eos> Before she dies, I'll tell her she's lucky to have you as a brother.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> After she guts you and before you die, you tell her I was the lucky one.
Octavia's doing well.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> You taught her to be a warrior.<eos> A warrior has many teachers, war chief among them.<eos> If she wins, we'll see what she has truly learned.<eos> Uhh! You.<eos> You lied to me about the flame.<eos> I trusted you, and you broke that trust.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> You would have killed Indra's daughter.

We will share it equally because we are equal.<eos> We are one clan, and we will survive praimfaya together.<eos> Lincoln would be so proud of you.<eos> There won't be enough room for all our people.<eos> It's unity day, Kane.<eos> Where's my brother?<eos> Alpha and factory station bunks are on level 4.<eos> Hydra and farm, level five.<eos> Everyone go check out their new home, meet back here in one hour.<eos> What the hell did you do?
Yeah, but, Spence, she controls the rules, and she will change them to ensure that she wins.<eos> Which means that I'm locked in.<eos> Like she is.<eos> And she needs me locked in, playing by her rules a game I can't win, so she...<eos> I got it.<eos> Guess that's one way to get you to put your hands on me.<eos> Dance with me.<eos> You guys got this up?<eos> Streaming now.<eos> Ok, uh, listen, you're gonna hear a lot of weird stuff, like Spence saying he is the father of Cat's baby.
Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Derek, oh, my God.<eos> Oh, princess.<eos> It is so good to see you.<eos> I'm liking your new digs.<eos> Ohh. I'm not crazy about how I earned them.<eos> It's been a tough year.<eos> Yeah, I heard some of what you've been going through.
Were you able to trace where the hack came from?<eos> Do you see what I have to put up with?<eos> Alvez, you'll always get a location with this one.<eos> You guys are all good to go.<eos> Prentiss: Obviously Morgan can't come with us.<eos> He's a civilian now.<eos> We'll miss you out there.<eos> I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss it out there in the field with you guys.<eos> I think about it every day.<eos> But between my old friends and my new friends, you guys are gonna go out there, you're gonna handle your business, you're gonna make people feel safe, and then you're gonna come home.
- Güero.<eos> - What's up, Joaquín?<eos> HERIBERTO "EL GÜERO" PALMA DRUG LORD<eos> - Where are the Colombians?<eos> - They are coming.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> He's flying too fast.<eos> Give me the radio.<eos> The runway is not that long.<eos> You're flying too fast.
Welcome to parenting in 2015.<eos> They're all just completely transfixed by the technology.<eos> One-third of all photos young people take are selfies.<eos> Selfie indulgence may be like a drug.<eos> -[squawks] -[train horn honks] [man] How many likes do you need to get so you feel okay with your day?<eos> I think 80 to 100 is, like, a pretty good range.<eos> [man laughs] Are you serious?<eos> Just about putting yourself out there every second.<eos> [woman] Are you one of the millions of people wondering, like, what is this crazy app called Periscope?<eos> If you want to interact, people, you can go ahead and comment here in the comments or you can just lurk, if that's what you're into.
All I know is she's not a criminal.<eos> [woman] Lonina's bond set at $125,000.<eos> Shamansky expected her bond to be posted almost immediately.<eos> For now, reporting live from downtown, Reneé LaSalle, NBC 4.<eos> [man] Marina didn't call 911. She didn't run for help. She didn't try to stop it.<eos> If she knew it was a bad situation, why was that her first instinct?<eos> [man] He's said to have bought them a bottle of vodka while also proposing they meet up the next day.<eos> [man] This white savage, Marina Lonina.<eos> Here's her primary address.<eos> [man] Kids, I shouldn't have to tell you this, but you shouldn't commit crimes, period.

-MFC probably.<eos> -You wanna do it off your account, too?<eos> [Frost] That's easy.<eos> Okay. [woman] Here we go.<eos> -Yay! We're live!<eos> -Hey, guys, how's it goin'?<eos> You're a sexy woman indeed.<eos> How's it goin', Coolball?<eos> [Frost] Hi. What's up?<eos> What do you guys wanna see today?

-We're playin' a game. -Hey. If you guys wanna play.<eos> It's hit-and-miss.<eos> People have money problems the same way that I do, so...<eos> Especially at the end of the month, it becomes more difficult to maybe, you know, give money to a camgirl.<eos> Like, it's not like I'm food.<eos> It's a luxury.<eos> I'm a luxury.<eos> We're not necessities in anybody's life.<eos> [woman] We'll be back, you guys.<eos> So you come over that side of the rise.
-[Tom] Hey.<eos> -[Emily] How you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> [Emily] Are you okay? -I'm better than I was.<eos> I feel like I was pinning a lot on this relationship.<eos> Of my self-worth on... this relationship being something that it might not necessarily have been.<eos> I question whether this whole relationship was ever really... real in any way.<eos> -[Emily] I think it's a real relationship.<eos> -Yeah? You had something.<eos> It might have changed over time. -Yeah. -You obviously have more of expectations of what you both wanted or what you saw it was.
[man] You're sober today?
[Bailey] All right.<eos> -Cool, I'm excited.<eos> Go, team!<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -Eva. [Bonnie] I've never been in California before.<eos> [Eva] Oh.<eos> [Bailey] Welcome!<eos> [Bailey chuckles] Yeah, you guys will have to take me sightseeing.<eos> [Bailey] Yeah. I think we're gonna try and go to the beach tonight.<eos> -Where are you guys from?
Go, team!<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -Eva. [Bonnie] I've never been in California before.<eos> [Eva] Oh.<eos> [Bailey] Welcome!<eos> [Bailey chuckles] Yeah, you guys will have to take me sightseeing.<eos> [Bailey] Yeah. I think we're gonna try and go to the beach tonight.<eos> -Where are you guys from?<eos> -[Eva] I'm from Florida. [Bailey] I'm from Indiana.<eos> So, you're here to shoot, girl-girl and solo, right?
[Eva] It's nice that you can make that decision.<eos> -[Bailey] Yeah.<eos> -I love this job. [Bailey] I think that's really important, too, that you... you have that power to make that decision.<eos> I'm trying my best to create for these girls just a really safe environment for them to do what they wanna do.<eos> I want them all to have the best experience they can have.<eos> As women, we need to watch out for each other.<eos> [car door closes] So, has Bailey been nice to you so far?<eos> [Bailey] Eh!<eos> -[girls giggle] Come upstairs, we will show you your little hideout.<eos> [Bailey] Well, you guys are gonna see like a lot of girls today.
[John] Oh, yeah, there's a whole...<eos> [Bailey] Right? Yeah. -...gang.<eos> -[girls chuckle] [Bailey] You can ask anyone in the biz.<eos> Everyone knows John.<eos> Everyone knows he's a great agent. [Eva] Which button are we?<eos> [John and Bailey] Three.<eos> [Bailey] He always gets his girls gigs, like, he cares about us.<eos> That's why when John asked me to come onboard, I was so excited 'cause I know he's doing a great thing here in the industry.<eos> We have, um, one downstairs unit.<eos> And then you guys will be up here.
We have, um, one downstairs unit.<eos> And then you guys will be up here.<eos> [John] This is Tally... and Zoey.<eos> [Tally] Hello. [Bonnie] Nice to meet you.<eos> [John] We've been in business a little over 18 years.<eos> Come on, that's Megan hiding over there. -[Eva] Hi.<eos> -[Megan chuckles]<eos> The relationship that I've established with girls I've worked for, you know, is that they, you know, trust me completely.<eos> It's almost like, you know, I'm like a father figure.<eos> Now that you're here, you can, like...
But I imagine he'll probably find out.<eos> -[all chuckle] That's a surprise you may not want him to experience on his own.<eos> -[chuckles] -Yeah. [Bonnie] Okay, how're we riding?<eos> [Bailey] Uh... New peeps with me.<eos> [Bonnie] All right, good. [chuckles]<eos> [Bonnie] I was nervous about coming to LA by myself... but I think Bailey is a very genuine person.<eos> She really cares that I don't have, like, a bad experience in the industry.<eos> Come on, let's go touch the ocean.<eos> [Bonnie] Look, I got my toes wet.<eos> -Congratulations, you made it.
[chuckles] Thank you.<eos> When I first started camming, I didn't have anyone there to kind of guide me through the whole process.<eos> I was uncomfortable a lot.<eos> All right, the dress is coming off. [chuckles]<eos> There will always be people who wanna push your limits.<eos> It's actually a turn on to a lot of people to see you uncomfortable.<eos> And I had to learn that the hard way.<eos> [Bailey] Today, you guys will kind of get a feel for... what these producers can see you, like, really fitting into.<eos> Being able to do a lot of different things is kind of important in our industry.<eos> -[Eva] Mmm-hmm. -'Cause, I mean there's so many things and the more you can cover, the more you can profit from.
[Bailey] I am a feminist working in this industry.<eos> I know I'm a sex object, but I control everything.<eos> I don't like doing anything degrading.<eos> So, if it's degrading, it's me degrading myself.<eos> If the only way to pay my bills was to do something I was uncomfortable with, I would not be empowered.<eos> [John] After you.<eos> [Eva] Thank you.<eos> [manager] Hello. [Bailey] Hello, long time no see.<eos> -[manager] How are you?<eos> Boy, you guys look innocent.
Oh, thank you.<eos> -A lot prettier, but wholesome.<eos> -Thank you. Like a wholesome-looking, like, Texas girl.<eos> -[John] Oklahoma.<eos> -Oklahoma? Is that where you're from?<eos> -[Bonnie] Mmm-hmm. -So, what brings you to California?<eos> -Business. [chuckles] -[Eva chuckles] Yeah.<eos> -[manager] You're gonna do porn?<eos> -Mmm-hmm. You know, you're not just gonna be able to make a living doing porn.<eos> You're gonna have to learn more, you know?
You know, you're grinding on them and... they'll try and stick their fingers, like, in my panties.<eos> Like, that gets really old, telling people no.<eos> Really wore on me.<eos> Yeah, just bring, you know, like, some little skirts, dresses, some panties and bras.<eos> I hope that I'm more comfortable with porn.<eos> [Bailey] Here, let me post you on my Snapchat.<eos> -Do you charge for Snap? -Mmm-mmm.<eos> -We should make another Snapchat. Yeah.<eos> -Right, yeah? Like, have one for everyone that's just like, "Oh, yeah, this chick's really hot,"<eos> and then, be like, "If you wanna see the dirty stuff, you better buy my Snapchat for $30 or whatever for a month."
[Bailey] Here, let me post you on my Snapchat.<eos> -Do you charge for Snap? -Mmm-mmm.<eos> -We should make another Snapchat. Yeah.<eos> -Right, yeah? Like, have one for everyone that's just like, "Oh, yeah, this chick's really hot,"<eos> and then, be like, "If you wanna see the dirty stuff, you better buy my Snapchat for $30 or whatever for a month."<eos> And then you make, like, a business.<eos> -[Bailey] There's a ton of money that way.<eos> -Yeah. -Got everything?<eos> -Yeah. All right, here we go.<eos> [Bailey] So are you guys excited that your first shoot is, like, together?
-Right, yeah? Like, have one for everyone that's just like, "Oh, yeah, this chick's really hot,"<eos> and then, be like, "If you wanna see the dirty stuff, you better buy my Snapchat for $30 or whatever for a month."<eos> And then you make, like, a business.<eos> -[Bailey] There's a ton of money that way.<eos> -Yeah. -Got everything?<eos> -Yeah. All right, here we go.<eos> [Bailey] So are you guys excited that your first shoot is, like, together?<eos> [Eva] Yeah. [Bailey] That's, like, comforting.<eos> [Bonnie] I know.<eos> [Bailey] Did you guys practice at all?
Good. "You should probably come here, Jessica.<eos> There's no reason we can't all have fun.<eos> Let's go for it."<eos> And... action!<eos> I think we should probably start undressing her.<eos> Ew, that was really gross.<eos> [coughing] Yeah, we ripped that. [chuckles] [all laughing] [coughing]<eos> [laughs]<eos> [Zoey] Yeah.<eos> [Bonnie] What did you guys do before you, like, did porn?
And John kinda trusted me to steer you guys in the right direction.<eos> [Bailey] Girls just disappear.<eos> The industry is not for everyone, the adult industry... it can be a very scary place.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> We don't have a lot of people outside of the industry that we can talk to.<eos> It's part of being in the industry.<eos> Once you're in it, you're... you're kind of an outcast.<eos> Yay!<eos> Sam! Thank you so much!<eos> Yeah, you're literally taking me out. [chuckles]
"She's just making it up 'cause she wants pity tokens."<eos> I have five new videos on my profile.<eos> But I can't leave.<eos> I literally can't stop looking at that screen.<eos> I constantly have to stare at that screen and say, "Oh, hey!<eos> Hello, bigguy99."<eos> Hey, there, mountaindome.<eos> I start drinking and I...<eos> I don't know why it helps but it does.<eos> You guys are amazing.
Well, you probably don't- [woman] The blonde one?<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> -Yes.<eos> You know, if James is making out with somebody in a Snapchat, things are gonna end up here.<eos> [chuckles] There was no making out on video, but it was, like, close enough.<eos> And that's when I got a text from Jessica.<eos> She's like, "Did you kiss that girl?"<eos> [Rhine] When I am seeing a bunch of other people, all I have to do is post a couple Snapchats and get really drunk over a weekend, and then I'm no longer seeing anyone anymore.<eos> It's called reloading.<eos> Tactical reload. [chuckles] [woman] Well, did she actually think you guys were dating?
I've been enabled by these apps 100%.<eos> Swipe left, swipe right, you know.<eos> We refresh to see how many likes we have.<eos> Nothing real and this has all been real.<eos> [woman] It sounds like you've thought a lot about this.<eos> I've done nothing but think about this.<eos> [Alexis] It's so crazy that, you know, we live in this technologically, like, advanced world and everyone's just, like, so disconnected from all of it.<eos> [woman] It's also kind of...<eos> I don't get why your age group is even online.<eos> You're social.

But sometimes they have a harder time, especially when it's the first time for someone in front of the camera.<eos> No.<eos> So, when the music is getting more powerful, there we would like, you know, a climax from you.<eos> All these people that you've been fantasizing about, their hands upon your body, touching you.<eos> [Monica] Maybe I'm concerned because I never tried to play the piano while doing other things so it's... [chuckling] This is my worry.<eos> So we'll just do the two of them fighting here first before anything.<eos> [Holly] Let's cut.<eos> Your outfit's falling off.<eos> [woman] This is the most ridiculous thing ever, like, seriously.<eos> [Holly] Okay, you guys ready?
I do have a professional actor coming in.<eos> [Lust in Spanish] The important thing is, even though this is sex, it's very technical and everything.<eos> The important thing is to try to feel at least a little bit.<eos> [in Spanish] But do you want it romantic or hard?<eos> Romantic, right?<eos> At the beginning, I want it a little softer... and then a little stronger, because the musical piece.<eos> But the thing is, I'm scared to tell you to go too hard, because then it's going to be really hard.<eos> [Lust in English] Performers who are used to work in the mainstream porn industry, I need them to understand that I'm not interested in them "doing porn."<eos> I want to show sex, which is much more emotional.<eos> [chattering] [in Spanish] Let me know when you're set.
We must break free from the petty politics of the past.<eos> America is a nation of believers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics.<eos> All of the people telling you, "You can't have the country you want," are the same people that wouldn't stand...
Although I strongly support Trump, we have managerial differences.<eos> And, meanwhile, I'm just making the very best case for him in public that I can, 'cause I do think he has what it takes.<eos> There's always this tension between the candidate and his consultant.<eos> The candidate resents the credit the consultant gets for his words.<eos> The consultant resents, you know, the fame and fortune the candidate gets when he did all the work.<eos> And Trump hated the fact that Stone was showing up on cable news and that people were, you know, calling him Trump's brain.<eos> So he fired him.<eos> But it doesn't mean he stopped relying on him.<eos> It seems to me there is more than meets the eye here with Roger Stone parting company from the Trump campaign, coming on my program and others and giving the big Trump pitch.<eos> You media types are so conspiratorial.
Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider, the vice-Trumpian joins us.<eos> You've got Alex Jones, he's like the sort of main conspiracy theorist, probably the most popular in American life now.<eos> You know, Roger Stone goes on that show every day.<eos> There's this crazy vortex of all that stuff back from the '90s just now sort of exploding through the channel of Trump.<eos> I'm never a lesser-of-two-evils person, but with Hillary, there's not even the same universe.<eos> I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell.<eos> Alex Jones is very important.<eos> I realize the elite media likes to call him a conspiracy theorist.<eos> I don't like 'em putting chemicals in the water that turns the frickin' frogs gay!<eos> Do you understand that?
Law enforcement sources tell CNN that the FBI has been conducting multiple investigations and it continues to examine allegations against Roger Stone, a Trump supporter, about possible connections to WikiLeaks.<eos> Those probes include a year-long investigation of Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his firm and their alleged ties to pro-Putin figures in Ukraine.<eos> These cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election.<eos> I find that deeply disturbing, and I think it's time...<eos> -She has no idea whether it's Russia... -...you take a stand China, or anybody else.<eos> -I'm not quoting myself. I'm quoting 17...<eos> -Hillary, you have no idea.<eos> The Clinton thugs, they're the ones saying,<eos> "Donald Trump is a traitor to his country, in bed with Vladimir Putin," a man he's never even met.<eos> Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.
"Silent majority," "the forgotten Americans."<eos> "I am the candidate of law and order."<eos> It's not me who found this trend.<eos> It's those who went before me.<eos> I just saw Trump's ability to utilize it to become president.<eos> This is the manifestation of a dream I've had since 1988.<eos> And I've always thought Donald Trump had the size and the courage and the balls to become president of the United States.<eos> We're in the age of Stone because the change in our politics, the rough-and-tumble cutthroat politics, the slash-and-burn of what was just probably the dirtiest, nastiest campaign in American political history, are now in vogue.<eos> What message would you have for the viewers of this film who will loathe you when the credits roll?<eos> I revel in your hatred, because if I weren't effective, you wouldn't hate me.
And I was watching the race...<eos> I can't believe that I hurt my own kid.<eos> Okay, sweetie. You couldn't have predicted he would grab that girl's ponytail.<eos> You would have.<eos> Probably.<eos> But, you know, it's my fault.<eos> I should have been there, and I'm really sorry.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Hey!<eos> What did you think of the race?
But, you know, it's my fault.<eos> I should have been there, and I'm really sorry.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Hey!<eos> What did you think of the race?<eos> Great.<eos> You were so fast! You were like a human car.<eos> Yeah, vroom.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You didn't see it. No. No, we didn't.
What did you think of the race?<eos> Great.<eos> You were so fast! You were like a human car.<eos> Yeah, vroom.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You didn't see it. No. No, we didn't.<eos> Sam had a major incident.<eos> He cut his hand. He was very upset.<eos> Honey...<eos> I bought these with my own money, so you can't have one.
Yeah, I guess they saw my last race, and I don't know, they want me.<eos> Wow!<eos> Clayton?<eos> Mmhmm. That's huge.<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> How far away is Clayton?<eos> I mean, would you have to leave Newton?<eos> No, Mom, I love high school so much, I'd go to both.<eos> No, they want me to start right away.<eos> What do you guys think? Wow.
You just know.<eos> Paige told Sam that she loves him. She did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoa. That's huge.<eos> I know. They've only been dating for like two seconds.<eos> Less time than us.<eos> Yeah. Okay, then. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Mom! Hey, you two.
For one lousy goof-butt?<eos> [sighs] It's our second offense.<eos> I am lovin' this marijuana cigarette!<eos> [muffled grunt, snort] Or it will be, once they run our prints and figure out we gave 'em fake names.<eos> Oh, man, was my fake name not the best?<eos> I swear, I am such a pistol.<eos> You're lucky I don't have a pistol.<eos> Or even a belt.<eos> Or even shoelaces.<eos> What if I told you I could get you guys outta here, no charges filed?
[scoffs] Come on.<eos> You look like you should be policing a cornfield.<eos> Arresting crows and shit. Caw! Caw!<eos> Seriously. No.<eos> I'm the cop.<eos> For one thing, I have military experience, so--<eos> Me and Verl were in the army. And I was in the navy.<eos> Well, but, you know, I didn't segregate the service.<eos> And no offense, but-- But here it comes.<eos> Well, but what did you do, exactly?
Look, I realize that a segregated service is just crazy.<eos> Especially when you think about what we were fighting for over there, but--<eos> Oh, so now you got a "but." But if you think about it, the most racist thing would be if whenever there was a war, we only sent Negroes.<eos> Wow!<eos> Words fail me.<eos> I failed my induction screening. Well, obviously.<eos> You put the "F" in "4-F." You know--<eos> Okay, Verl can be the cop.<eos> But I'm still squad leader.<eos> And I need you guys to respect that. Come on.
By the pound. Mm-hmm.<eos> God bless that mess.<eos> So, no.<eos> [Poovey] I say we put it to a vote.<eos> I vote no.<eos> Poovey, come on.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Make me.<eos> I mean, don't make me.<eos> Look, I know you cops have to check your weapons up front, and there's five of us and only one of you, so--
So, no.<eos> [Poovey] I say we put it to a vote.<eos> I vote no.<eos> Poovey, come on.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Make me.<eos> I mean, don't make me.<eos> Look, I know you cops have to check your weapons up front, and there's five of us and only one of you, so--<eos> So who wants their ass beat first? [bones crack]<eos> And before you decide, keep in mind I'm gradually gonna get more tired, but also gradually more berserker.
By "you people," do you mean--<eos> Out!<eos> All of you, out!<eos> Not so fast, Shamus.<eos> [sighs] Damn it.<eos> Hey, not that it should matter, but I was a tanker.<eos> 761st Tank Battalion.<eos> Wait.<eos> Patton's Panthers?<eos> You guys saved our asses at the Bulge.
Do... do you think it's Trexler's?<eos> Oh, please!<eos> With your luck?<eos> Oh, sweet mother of Christ!<eos> Wh-what the hell is happening?<eos> And why the hell are you here?<eos> That's it?<eos> No "sorry I shoved you out of a moving frickin' car"?<eos> I said sorry in advance.<eos> And what are you doing here?
This is the first time in my career that a bullet has taken a life without being fired.<eos> This is nice.<eos> Must've been for one of his tricks.<eos> Or not.<eos> One thing practitioners of magic tend to have in common is a fascination with the macabre.<eos> Depictions of death.<eos> Torture devices.<eos> Instruments of the occult.<eos> These things find their way not only into the magician's act but into his or her way of life.<eos> You look at the iron maiden and you think, How awful.
How does he even know this guy? I don't know.<eos> I looked at every command Roy ever worked, every place Gorham lived...<eos> I just can't figure out how the two of them connect.<eos> I can't prove it.<eos> You don't have to prove anything to me. I know what he's capable of.<eos> You know, we never talked about him.<eos> You're such a good person.<eos> I like to think you have good taste in men.<eos> But... your ex is a piece of garbage.<eos> And I just don't understand how you two were ever a couple.
You pore over every cost, every dollar, and then you just decide who stays and who goes.<eos> I don't decide, I just recommend.<eos> I have some recommendations, too.<eos> You do?<eos> I hate to say it, but not everyone pulls their weight on this ship.<eos> Why don't you get another cup, Birdy?<eos> We'll talk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's great, Monroe, but why are we here?<eos> Well, you're here because you're the five most important directors in town.
But imagine a world where we could.<eos> A world where all movies were equal.<eos> It'd be better for all of us, don't you think?<eos> Not bad for you either.<eos> No... no, it wouldn't be.<eos> But one day you may want to break from Columbia, Frank.<eos> Start your own studio.<eos> When that day comes, wouldn't you want your films to compete with Louis Mayer's films solely on merit?<eos> We're just five people, Monroe.<eos> But between you, you know every member in the Academy.

I'll see you on the set.<eos> No, please. Don't go.<eos> Monroe! What's there to stay for?<eos> I love you!<eos> I love you.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Monroe.<eos> She's mine. See?<eos> Good.<eos> Good, you two deserve each other.
Sometime this week?<eos> - I can text you. - Yes! - Bye!<eos> - Bye!<eos> Hello? ! We can't start buying buses for 300.000!<eos> We are five people!<eos> That's what a bus costs.<eos> All the buses are being sold now.<eos> If we want to try buying a bus in May 2018, it's not going to work.<eos> We have to buy a bus now or there won't be a bus!<eos> I can join the bus if you need people. I agree with Vilde.
How do you know them?<eos> If everyone can be quiet, we'll start the lesson.<eos> FRIDAY 15:32<eos> I'm sorry we are late!<eos> It's really rude to come late now!<eos> Aren't we just looking at a bus? ! It's not exactly a fucking job interview.<eos> No, but we still have to present ourselves at dependable so they can trust that we'll pay.<eos> But they can't trust us... Because we don't have the money.<eos> No one says anything about us not having any money.<eos> Sana and I will take care of talking and you guys can stick to the background.
So this is the bus?<eos> It's really cool!<eos> Yeah, it's not quite done yet.<eos> We are a bit behind schedule. Wasn't it One Oak that had it last year?<eos> Yes and Vogue in 2015.<eos> As I was telling the other girls, it's important to us that we keep up the tradition, that cool girls take over the bus after us.<eos> I get that. There are so many weird concepts and buses out there. Yeah!<eos> But... now I'm not trying to sell my way in but I feel like we are kind of like you.<eos> Like we are cool, normal, Norwegian party girls.<eos> And you have such an awesome name... The Pepsi-Max squad!

The Pepsi-Max squad!<eos> That's no tour name anymore.<eos> How many seats are there? Twenty-five.<eos> Enough room then.<eos> How many are you?
We are twenty. Yeah?<eos> Well, as I was saying the bus is EU-approved.<eos> All the paperwork is taken care of and the yearly fees have been paid.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Yes, was it 310,000 what you wanted for the bus?<eos> 300.000.<eos> Because we have a Budget for 310.000, so...<eos> We will pay 320.000.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then, are you both interested?

MONDAY 12:11<eos> LENDER'S APPLICATION IS FREE<eos> YOUSEF - I'M HURT BECAUSE YOU NEVER REPLIED TO MY MEME<eos> THE KIDS AROUND YOU ARE HURT BECAUSE YOU ARE CHATTING DURING WORK TIME<eos> HAH!<eos> I'M FREE ON MONDAYS.<eos> HOW IS THE RUSS BUSS?<eos> IT'S GOING GREAT IF YOU TELL ME HOW TO EARN 300,000 KRONE FAST.<eos> Hi!<eos> We heard you got the bus.
HAH!<eos> I'M FREE ON MONDAYS.<eos> HOW IS THE RUSS BUSS?<eos> IT'S GOING GREAT IF YOU TELL ME HOW TO EARN 300,000 KRONE FAST.<eos> Hi!<eos> We heard you got the bus.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Thanks.<eos> So we were wondering...<eos> Would you want to join us?

Hi!<eos> We heard you got the bus.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Thanks.<eos> So we were wondering...<eos> Would you want to join us?<eos> We just thought that you are 5 and we are 20.<eos> There are 25 seats on the bus. Perhaps it could be a match?<eos> We know that maybe we haven't been the world's best friends, but we don't really understand why.<eos> Because you called Vilde a slut at Borkis' bus pre-grame in October 2015.

Perhaps it could be a match?<eos> We know that maybe we haven't been the world's best friends, but we don't really understand why.<eos> Because you called Vilde a slut at Borkis' bus pre-grame in October 2015.<eos> Right.<eos> I had completely forgotten about that.<eos> But I apologize.<eos> We'll merge our buses... on two conditions.<eos> Okay?<eos> You pay for the bus and I become the bus boss.
Listen, Mom? Yes?<eos> I was wondering if I could invite some girls to come over on Friday?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, is that fine?<eos> Yes. It is.<eos> How many are you?<eos> Or are you not that many?<eos> Not that many.<eos> No?<eos> What are you going to do?
To start, I have had a look at your budget and it needs to be redistributed.<eos> For example... there is not point in trying to compete in lighting and sound rigging, because then we are going to lose.<eos> But what we can be competitive in, is concept.<eos> So the first thing I am going to do is to move our resources from the light and sound section to the concept section.<eos> I am sorry, but it is very hard to win year's best concept.<eos> The League 2014, a boy's bus from Bærum with a Pokeball bar and Pokémon decorations.<eos> Montana 2015, a boy's bus from Oslo-West that put together three versions of Montana.<eos> Tony Montana, Hannah Montana and the state of Montana.<eos> Also we have Landslaget 2016, inspired by football spirit and nationalism.<eos> Do you see what those buses have in common?
and I have to ask, since you are muslim.<eos> What do you think about drinking?<eos> I judge no one.<eos> So, can we drink?<eos> When were your parents coming back home?<eos> Tomorrow morning...<eos> I think.<eos> They are at a Moroccan wedding.<eos> It's good to know.<eos> ARE YOU HAVING A NICE TIME AT THE WEDDING?
ARE YOU HAVING A NICE TIME AT THE WEDDING?<eos> Sana? ! ?<eos> What's happening here?<eos> You know mum and dad are here? Huh? !<eos> They are down with the neighbours, by the car.<eos> DAD DIDN'T FEEL WELL, SO WE ARE COMING HOME NOW.<eos> DO YOU STILL HAVE GUESTS?<eos> Okay. Everyone has to get out now!<eos> Come on!<eos> Are you deaf or what? Now!
Or you can imagine? Yes, it looked really good.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - Awesome!<eos> - Are you selling tea or what?<eos> - Yeah. I'm selling this tea. - Oh!<eos> I understand now!<eos> - Good choice.<eos> Apple tea.<eos> - Totally agree. - Cool<eos> But what do you do besides drinking tea then?
- Oslo? Same here.<eos> - You're studying there too?<eos> What are you studying?<eos> [UNKNOWN] We're taking different subjects.<eos> Like some...<eos> Individual courses?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Individual courses. - Shopping for courses?<eos> - Shopping for courses.<eos> What do you do then?
Shopping for courses.<eos> Then I'll see.<eos> Maybe a year off. Because the student fund costs, you know.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hi. It's Yousef.<eos> Sorry for calling, but I don't know what to do with Elias.<eos> What happened?<eos> He's completely drunk and wants to go home and sleep.<eos> But I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Where are you?
I can have Norwegian friends and be myself at the same time.<eos> Come on! Are you all deaf? !<eos> ? - Now! - Come on!<eos> Out, out, out!<eos> Two conditions:<eos> You pay for the bus and I become the bus boss.
You have to stop being so skeptical and start trusting your children. Oh my God!<eos> When Elias woke up, Eskild was sitting there and started hitting on him. He was like: "Hi, are you waking up with me?"<eos> Elias didn't understand anything!<eos> He looked terrified and threw up all over Eskild!<eos> Then he stopped hitting on him.<eos> - No.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi. - What's up?<eos> - We are talking about last Friday's party.<eos> You should have been there!
Then I go up to him and I stroke him, just a little bit on his side.<eos> And then I feel a shiver going through him, like... He left pretty early but he...<eos> He seemed open for...<eos> - For more fun!<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> I can send you the money with Vipps.<eos> - Vipps me?<eos> - How much? - How much does it cost?<eos> Hello?<eos> It's 112,40 or 112,50. To Elias Bakkoush: ARE YOU COMING?
Elias stop!<eos> Leave!<eos> Elias, leave!<eos> Elias stop!<eos> Elias!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> Fucking kids! Elias!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> We have to go to the emergency room.<eos> Let's go then! - Are you coming?
How does it actually happen to you this Party stuff has become so important?<eos> Are you joining SING on Friday?
I think she likes it very well.<eos> (Notification)<eos> (Noora :) Something wrong?<eos> Are you so quiet<eos> (They talk about each other)<eos> - That's the guys!<eos> -I'm fine?<eos> Yes.<eos> And even?<eos> -Now everything is good; You are together
Soccer?<eos> Do not forget the bottle.<eos> The water bottle, I mean.<eos> The bottle!<eos> Yes / Yes!<eos> -Behave!<eos> -Yes, of course.<eos> - Are not you with us?<eos> - I'm not so hungry.<eos> - Do you have carrots?
How many times have we tried?<eos> You are using your data volume.<eos> I have a flat rate.<eos> -Was they?<eos> -No.<eos> -Is she currently active on Facebook?<eos> - Before a while, but not now.<eos> -You wrote to Facebook?<eos> -More than a message.<eos> - Did you call her parents?
As for my wife-to-be... she knows how I feel about her.<eos> So, instead of boring you with talk, I'll thank you all for celebrating with us and leave you to enjoy this wonderful party. Please.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Got something for you.<eos> For you and Kathleen.<eos> An early wedding gift, a crossing on the Queen Mary.<eos> Then, two weeks cruising the Mediterranean. The works.<eos> Pat, this is very generous, but we can't.<eos> We have Enemy to shoot and after that...<eos> You'll have time.
- Z?<eos> - Cut.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know, sometimes, when we immerse ourselves in technology, we cut ourselves off from nature - and from each other. - [insect buzzing]<eos> You know what? Try this. Think of your minds as powerful tablets and nature as one never-ending<eos> Now look around.<eos> See everything that is open to you now that you have put your cell phones away.

Neither accessorizes with jewelry. Skulls, yes.<eos> But where is Jordan?<eos> And why would she leave her bracelet on our door?<eos> Hello, explorers. - Aah!<eos> Drew, you scared us half to death.<eos> Are you a ghost?<eos> I don't think so, but it would be really cool.<eos> No!<eos> What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?<eos> Oh, uh, I saw you guys come outside, and I-- I wanted to make sure you were all right.
Is she the older girl you guys were hanging out with today? Yeah.<eos> Speaking of which, how did you photo bomb our threefie?<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> I guess I'd just been standing there so long, I didn't realize you guys were taking a photo.<eos> It was really cool how she did that thing with the Popsicle sticks.<eos> How long had you been standing there?<eos> The whole time.<eos> Why?<eos> It looked like you guys were having a lot of fun.<eos> I guess I was hoping you'd notice me and invite me over to join you.
I think we actually have proof of two things.<eos> Which are?<eos> Wherever she is, Jordan's not a ghost.<eos> And Drew's been wanting to hang out with us.<eos> Head up just a bit.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Hey, Drew.<eos> Hi, explorers.<eos> Drew, we've been a little blind.<eos> What do you mean?
So we have three keys.<eos> What do they unlock?<eos> And how do we find it with no footprints?<eos> And without getting lost?<eos> Lucky for us we have a telescope. Oh.<eos> This way, explorers.<eos> Adventure awaits!<eos> A factory without walls.<eos> A laboratory and an artist's studio rolled into one.<eos> Glad you could make it. Z, Paws: Jordan!
I don't understand. If Rae's your godmother, why did she pretend to not know you?<eos> Yeah. And say you weren't a counselor.<eos> Because I'm not a counselor anymore.<eos> Rae's mom passed away last year.<eos> It was a tough time.<eos> Rae wanted me to run the summer program, but I couldn't.<eos> I knew I could never fill her mom's shoes.<eos> But then you came back.<eos> It seemed like the camp was calling me back.<eos> I was just going to sneak around a little bit, check things out, but then I saw you two, and you reminded me so much of myself my first summer.

My son is the best!<eos> What happened?<eos> He fell on the playground yesterday.<eos> I was watching him, but...<eos> Come on!<eos> I told you to be careful! He can't bleed!<eos> I mean...<eos> Just be careful.<eos> Let's go to the amusement park!<eos> You should get going.
Min-woo Choi!<eos> Are you ready for some fun?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a photographer and came to take some photos.<eos> You two looked so good together.
- And you want to keep working?<eos> - Yes, sir, but...<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Stay on the losing side and keep working for Miguel Ángel, or come work for me on the winning side.<eos> I'm sorry, boss, but I can't ditch Miguel Ángel that easily.<eos> - Are you afraid he'll kill you? - Yes.<eos> - But you're not afraid I'll kill you?<eos> - Well, yes.<eos> But I'm more scared of him.<eos> From now on, you work for me.
Please, stop.<eos> I'll confess.<eos> I'll tell them whatever you want.<eos> [whimpering] Please, Sun.<eos> Sun, please.<eos> You're not a killer.<eos> You're not like me.<eos> I'm your brother.<eos> You were my brother.<eos> Did you all see what I saw?
Don't hurt him.<eos> We need to get him to trust us.<eos> Bowling ball's here, is he?<eos> Good.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Over here, male narrative.<eos> And what's with the hair?<eos> - What's with the hair?<eos> - Yeah, what's with the hair?<eos> Don't know what you're talking about.
I am a lover, I'm not a fighter.<eos> You guys want a sens-orgy that circles the globe, I'm your guy.<eos> You guys want to storm the ramparts, then...<eos> - Puck.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> Get away from them.<eos> Leave this town.<eos> You need to be on blockers 24/7.<eos> I have to go.<eos> If you guys want to kill me, then just do it quick.
Stop there! Police!<eos> Everything all right with the shipment?<eos> You happy?<eos> Everything's good, man.<eos> Happy birthday, pal.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Here's to many more.<eos> Cheers!<eos> Thank you man, so much.<eos> You know how to treat your friends.
What are you doing?<eos> - Don't go in his fridge!<eos> - Rachel.<eos> The man gave us his keys.<eos> Trust me.<eos> He knows we're gonna go through his shit.<eos> So basically you came here to look at what he eats and to say that this is a "no" for the wedding.<eos> Of course it's a no.<eos> But the fact is...<eos> Why are we even talking venue at all when you don't even have a date?
When this is over,<eos> I'm gonna look like I backed away from a merger, that I can't be trusted, not to mention that I look like I'm so weak that I needed to merge with a struggling firm like yours - Is that what you think we are... struggling?<eos> Harvey...<eos> You need me to answer that... Then you've got an even bigger problem than Tommy Bratton.<eos> Harvey, please tell me Zane went for the merger idea.<eos> - He didn't.<eos> - Damn it! We're gonna drown - without any help.<eos> - Then we'll get help.<eos> What do you think we've been working on?<eos> I thought you were trying to find the leak.
- over 3 million a year.<eos> - Then we'll get a bridge loan - from your guy at fidelity.<eos> - We already used that line of credit last year when we expanded the 42nd floor.<eos> - Harvey, what the hell are we gonna do?<eos> - I don't see a way out of this.<eos> - I have a way out.<eos> Give them what they want.<eos> I'm not giving up your clients, Alex.<eos> I do that, I might as well let you go.<eos> Then let me go, because I'm not gonna be responsible for driving you in the ground.

I had these memories.<eos> What I was remembering was so horrible.<eos> It was as if a 14-year-old came in and sat down next to me and started telling me what happened to her.<eos> And I was appalled.<eos> I thought for sure I was crazy.<eos> But at the same time, I was consumed by what was happening inside of me.<eos> I not only hoped that I was insane, 'cause I would have rather it been that than this really did happen, but I was a grown woman who had a sense of who I was.<eos> And I had my sense of what was right and wrong, and I had my sense of why, you know, you don't let that kind of thing happen.<eos> I had my sense of having children and I taught them:<eos> "You tell somebody if something happens."
So, it was me and Mike and we met downtown.<eos> And I took these seven memories with me, thinking that would be the statement, that they wanted to know what kind of stuff went on.<eos> I wouldn't wanna talk about these things with anyone, much less with a priest across the table and a lawyer and another lawyer. But, um...<eos> So, this is one of the memories that I read to the archdiocesan representatives.<eos> "Father Maskell had me come to the office one day when I had free mods.<eos> I was afraid to go in, but I did.<eos> He looked very angry.<eos> He said, 'So, you're here.<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> All you whores are alike.'
It was, like, so many thoughts going through my head... but I just took the stand and... And they questioned me.<eos> And one of the lawyers said, "I request that this plaintiff looks at me while I'm asking her questions."<eos> It felt as if at some point... that terrible terror of doing this... s... turned into something else.<eos> I just turned, I stared him right in the eyes.<eos> It was this feeling of...<eos> "Go ahead, ask me your questions."<eos> It was very brutal.<eos> They asked about the actual sexual acts.<eos> I mean, after a while, I got to the point where, "I don't give a damn.<eos> You ask me anything you want because this happened, and now the world's hearing it and that's a good thing."
Ooh, look at that.<eos> Is that a buzzard? And that, my friends, is a really big horse.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry. Hope my sister didn't get in the way of your massive horse.<eos> Oh! My party shoes.<eos> Did someone say party?<eos> Gramps!<eos> Zoe!<eos> But how wonderful to see you!<eos> Ah. I thought you were going to camp.
And I figure a summer vacay on a tiny island off the coast of England is just what I need.<eos> Zero parental stress, zero weirdly possessive friends and absolutely zero drama.<eos> It's okay, I'm fine.<eos> Hmm, I'll get back to you about that whole zero drama thing.<eos> No matter what you're doin'<eos> Come in, come in, come in, come in.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's all exactly the same.<eos> This is new.<eos> What do you think?
Is your mother always this...<eos> Recently, yes. You're not really here to nurse your invalid grandfather, are you?<eos> No, Grandpa.<eos> Thank goodness for that.<eos> I gotta go find Rosie.<eos> Rosie!<eos> This place is so beautiful.<eos> It needs a coffee shop right there, but other than that, all good.<eos> Ow. Excuse me, hi.<eos> Hey, um, I don't suppose you've seen a ten-year-old girl about yea high, resembles an angry ball of glitter?
Ow. Excuse me, hi.<eos> Hey, um, I don't suppose you've seen a ten-year-old girl about yea high, resembles an angry ball of glitter?<eos> You're American.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I'm French.<eos> Really?<eos> Is she serious?<eos> I've never met a French person before.<eos> Bonjour, stranger.<eos> Oh, she's serious.<eos> Okay, so, you haven't seen her?
Okay, all right. Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What are you...<eos> Why... Um... Translation:<eos> Who are you and what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, well, I'm Zoe.<eos> I'm staying here for the summer at my gramps' house, over there.<eos> That's right by the stables.<eos> You should totally come and hang out.<eos> You know, I'm not exactly what you'd call outdoorsy.
You bribed him with sweets.<eos> Told you it'd be something like that.<eos> I mean, it is pretty impressive.<eos> You know, you are the talk of the yard.<eos> I am?<eos> I'm Mia.<eos> I hope these two aren't bothering you.<eos> No, no, they're cool.<eos> We were helping her look for her sister.<eos> I suppose you think Raven's eaten her.
No, no, they're cool.<eos> We were helping her look for her sister.<eos> I suppose you think Raven's eaten her.<eos> Of course not. Have you?<eos> Run along.<eos> I can take things from here.<eos> My dad practically owns the stables.<eos> We can show you how things really work around here.<eos> Take my number.<eos> Are you two still here?
Girls, would you mind staying away from my horse?<eos> He's had such a crazy day.<eos> Raven is your horse?<eos> That's right, he's mine.<eos> But don't worry, there are plenty of other horses in the stables suitable for tourists.<eos> I can send you that photo, so you have something to remember him by.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> We'll have to go to the haystack.<eos> The Wi-Fi's strongest there.<eos> You guys have Wi-Fi?
The cathedral?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> Sh-she'll be dead by now.<eos> What?<eos> I couldn't be there.<eos> I don't care what they say. I won't take joy in that woman being killed by the Church.<eos> I'm here remembering her instead.<eos> She said to me, if you would love me as a man, then live as a man.<eos> Travel as a man.<eos> She said you were traveling.
Drinks?<eos> I should minister to the Archbishop.<eos> I fear he's not long for this world, to be honest.<eos> Off to heaven with him, eh?<eos> I suppose that's the ultimate goal for you priests, serving God in His true house and all that.<eos> It holds little appeal for me, to be honest.<eos> Really?<eos> There's so much left to be done on earth.<eos> Wallachia could be God's own country had I but time to burn out all the evil that hides here.<eos> What have you done?

Oh, no!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Dracula!<eos> He was supposed to be myth, a story made up by heretics!<eos> She... she's a witch.<eos> Lisa Tepes was a woman of science, and the one thing that justified humanity's stench upon this planet.<eos> You are not real.<eos> You are a fiction that justified the practice of black magic!<eos> A fiction!<eos> You take my wife and deny I even exist!

And yet, here we are.<eos> The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> Illusions and falsehoods hold no fear for us, for we are the righteous of Targoviste, living as if cradled in the love of God.<eos> One year.<eos> I gave you one year to make your peace with your God.<eos> And what do you do?

I, for one, found the display on Aztec agriculture amazing.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> Velma, that's good.<eos> "Maize" is what the Aztecs called corn.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> Yeah, it was the "corn" er stone of Aztec agriculture.<eos> It's lucky we're here, 'cause that joke belongs in a museum.<eos> I'm with Shaggy.<eos> Let's go somewhere fun.<eos> If you kids are looking for someplace fun to go, the annual Blowout Beach Bingo Bash just started.
You can't optimize fun, Velma.<eos> You just have fun.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> We've already missed half a day.<eos> If we're going to cram three days of fun into two and a half days, it's going to require some tight scheduling.<eos> Good thinking, Velma.<eos> You know, schedules are one of my favorite types of plans.<eos> Right up there with blueprints and building instructions.<eos> [ALL GASPING]<eos> Oh, man. Like, you guys are squares and a couple of two-by-two bricks.

Why, just last week I took us all to that amusement park.<eos> [SCREAMING]<eos> That was a creepy, abandoned amusement park. Filled with vampire clowns.<eos> What about the week before that, when I was like,<eos> "Hey, guys, let's go to the zoo."<eos> [SCREAMING]<eos> [ROARING]<eos> Creepy, abandoned, and there was a giant, zombie polar bear.<eos> Face it, you two, you just don't like to have fun like other people like to have fun.<eos> You'd rather be solving a mystery.

Or a triple decker sandwich.<eos> - With extra pickles.<eos> - And mustard.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> Oh, man, I'm getting super hungry here.<eos> What was the point I was trying to make?<eos> Sandwiches taste good?<eos> No, that wasn't it...<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> You two are no fun.
Oh, man, I'm getting super hungry here.<eos> What was the point I was trying to make?<eos> Sandwiches taste good?<eos> No, that wasn't it...<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> You two are no fun.<eos> Not true, we have fun.<eos> We have lots of fun.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> What's the last fun thing you did?
What's the last fun thing you did?<eos> I read a fascinating book on the history of nets.<eos> Like, I rest my case.<eos> We'll prove we can be just as fun as you guys.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> We will?<eos> - At the end of this weekend, when they name the captains of the Blowout Beach Bingo Bash, it's going to be me and Fred up on that stage.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I mean... Yeah!<eos> You'll see.
Where did everybody go?<eos> They must have sensed Fred and Velma's party pooper vibes and left town.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> Ha-ha, very funny.<eos> Come on, let's check in to the hotel.<eos> Then we can catch up with the party and prove we can have a good time.<eos> Pardon me, my fellow carefree, fun-loving teens.<eos> Uh, we're looking for the Bingo Bash.<eos> The Bash is over, Daddy-O, we're splitting.<eos> You cats should split, too, if you know it's good for you.
As owners of this fine establishment and all the attractions you see on the boardwalk, allow me to welcome you to the Holdout Inn.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> Sorry, but did you say those teens were scared off by pirates?<eos> Pirates ransacked the pier this morning. Chased everyone off. Cookies?<eos> [GOBBLING]<eos> My goodness, the entire bowl?<eos> - [SCOOBY BURPING] - We need two rooms, please.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, but we've only got one available room.<eos> [MAN SCREAMING]<eos> You're in luck! Another room just opened up.
But you can't have captains without them.<eos> - It's tradition.<eos> Tradition. - Tradition.<eos> So then maybe the pirates stole them to stop the Bash.<eos> I thought you said no investigating.<eos> Well, this is different.<eos> We've to get those pirate hats back if Fred and I are going to be Captains of the Bash.<eos> Excuse you, we are the Captains of the Bash.<eos> Krissy, Chad. These nice young teens are just checking in.<eos> Would you like to show them to their rooms?
Sheriff, what's this about?<eos> Mr. Monkfish is alleging that you two are responsible for that pirate attack earlier.<eos> A pretty cheap stunt, trying to chase away all my customers on the busiest weekend of the year.<eos> Hello, Dwight Monkfish.<eos> I own the pier at Blowout Beach.<eos> It's the big wooden thing sticking out into the ocean.<eos> Perhaps, you've seen it?<eos> We're Mystery Incorporated.<eos> Oh, is that your band name?<eos> Well, when you get tired of this rundown dump you should come by.

Come on, Mitzi, what are you standing around for?<eos> We've got things to do.<eos> - It was nice meeting you.<eos> - Mitzi!<eos> Sorry to bother you, folks.<eos> Hmm, I'm gonna catch up with the Sheriff for a second.<eos> Well, that vacation lasted about two seconds.<eos> You know, Sheriff, my friends and I are mystery solvers.<eos> Mystery solvers?<eos> I thought you were in a band.
Hey, fellas.<eos> Say, would you like to hear a funny story about a trap? "Trap?"<eos> Actually it's about a snare trap, to be specific.<eos> - Maybe later.<eos> - Look over there.<eos> It's Chad and Krissy, we should go say hi.<eos> Hey, Chad, Krissy, fancy meeting you two here.<eos> - Do we know you?<eos> - We met at your parents' inn.<eos> Less than an hour ago, you wouldn't show us to our rooms.

Ah, right.<eos> Listen, if we did something to offend you, I'm sorry.<eos> But we were just wondering if you could tell us anything about the pirate attack earlier.<eos> I understand the pirates took the hats right off your darling... [BOTH BUZZING]<eos> Um...<eos> I'm sorry, what's that?<eos> Shoo, fly, don't bother us.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> Come on, Fred, let's go.<eos> [LAUGHING] You know, you two are decidedly unjinky.
Oh, that.<eos> Yes, it's a pretty popular move where we come from.<eos> Oh, where's that?<eos> Uh...<eos> Cooltown?<eos> Upper Cooltown.<eos> Sounds cool.<eos> Say, do you think you could show us how to do the Jinky?<eos> Oh, I, I guess.<eos> Gather around, everyone, there's a hip new dance you gotta see.
♪ The Jinky ♪<eos> Oh, golly, I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah, you are sorry. And so is your lame new dance.<eos> - Lamoid.<eos> - Yeah. More like the Jerky.<eos> Hey, what's your problem?<eos> She said she was sorry, we're just trying to have fun.<eos> It is so sad what passes for fun these days.<eos> Come on, everybody, let's ditch these weirdos and go someplace cool.<eos> Um, why are you all just standing there?

Scoob, what are you thinkin'?<eos> Hmm...<eos> Open concept.<eos> You took the words right out of my mouth!<eos> Try, if you will, to picture our vision.<eos> We start by adding a few more portholes along this wall, give it a light, airy feel.<eos> Moving on, we were thinking we could paint this wall over here a fun color.<eos> Yeah, really make it pop!<eos> And, of course, we just want to lose this wall entirely and open up the space.<eos> What do you think?
- Fun, right?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I wanted to talk to you guys.<eos> I think I found some clues down at the pier.<eos> Oh no, you don't!<eos> We're having fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Clues can wait.<eos> "Clues can wait"?<eos> Who are you?

Or have you just been dancing this whole time?
Who cares?<eos> As long as they're gone!<eos> Brenda and Tommie are gone, too!<eos> [GLASS BREAKING]<eos> Well, maybe if Shaggy and Scooby hadn't led the pirates right to the club...<eos> Like, no way, man!<eos> We saw those pirates sail off.<eos> How could they have sailed the ship away and shown up minutes later at the Octo Rock Lounge?<eos> Oh, now you start investigating?<eos> Maybe if you two hadn't been so caught up in trying to prove you could be fun, we could have saved your friends.

First, we're too boring for you guys, and now we're too fun!<eos> All I'm saying is you can be fun and responsible at the same time.<eos> - Right, Scoob?<eos> - Uh-uh, leave me out of this.<eos> Sometimes you have to take responsibility, and I know that's a big word, dude, but responsibility is what you need.<eos> (VELMA) Daphne, I...<eos> [SLURPS AND SIGHS]<eos> [MUFFLED ARGUING]<eos> (VELMA) We were just trying to show that we know how to party down.<eos> (DAPHNE) You were supposed to be investigating.
- (SCOOBY) Over here!<eos> - Was that Scooby?<eos> (SCOOBY) I'm in here.<eos> [CLUNK]<eos> (ALL) Whoa!<eos> Huh?<eos> [EXCLAIMING]<eos> Huh?<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> You guys aren't Scooby!
How did we ever get by without your brilliant powers of observation?<eos> Ha-ha.<eos> Where's Scooby?<eos> (SCOOBY) Back here!<eos> These must be the tunnels the smugglers built back when the city was a safe haven for pirates.<eos> Neato.<eos> Let's explore.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - We do have to be up early for limbo.<eos> You guys aren't going to give up exploring secret tunnels for a silly limbo contest, are you?
- We do have to be up early for limbo.<eos> You guys aren't going to give up exploring secret tunnels for a silly limbo contest, are you?<eos> Like, a limbo contest doesn't even make sense!<eos> Where's the competition?<eos> We all bend at exactly the same height.<eos> You guys coming or what?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I guess.<eos> [MUFFLED VOICES]<eos> Do you guys hear that?

You're rude, ill-mannered kids.<eos> (LAURA) The way you've been treating those nice, young teens.<eos> We raised you better than that!<eos> Like, what are they saying?<eos> I don't feel right spying on those nice people and their rude children.<eos> Well, then get out of the way and let someone else listen. [BOINGS]<eos> [EXCLAIMS]<eos> Must have been the wind.<eos> You kids go off to bed now.<eos> You can't tell us when to go to bed!
- [SHUDDERING]<eos> Jeepers.<eos> How did they manage to get the ship in through that tiny opening?<eos> They must have sailed it in during low tide, when the opening would be larger.<eos> Pretty ingenious.<eos> From the outside, you wouldn't even know there was a cave here most of the time.<eos> Well, let's check it out.<eos> - No way, no how.<eos> - Nuh-uh.<eos> I thought you said you wanted to investigate this case?
Well, then. We'll have to work fast.<eos> I think you mean, like, walk fast, as in, run, as in, let's get out of here before the pirates show up?<eos> Sorry, Shaggy. This may be our only chance to get the drop on them and we've got to take it.<eos> Tommie, Brenda, you guys get help.<eos> We're gonna stay here and set up a trap.<eos> - Right on.<eos> - Be safe, Fredman.<eos> Maybe Scoob and I should go with them.<eos> Yeah, Fredman, with them.<eos> Shaggy, Scooby, I need you to go gather some wood from those walkways down there and come back as fast as you can.

It was nice to finally see you stand up to him.<eos> Well, Laura, honey, we should probably get going.<eos> No use sitting around, moping about what's already over.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Chad, Krissy, come on, we're leaving.<eos> Bye, everyone.<eos> (ALL) Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well, on the bright side, at least now we'll be Captains of the Bash for life.<eos> Yeah. You can all take comfort knowing that the last captains were the coolest captains.
- Daphne?<eos> Velma? - We know.<eos> Be prepared to spring the net when they hit that spot.<eos> And stand by on the secondary net, just in case.<eos> We got it. It's not rocket science, friend.<eos> That's the go sign.<eos> No turning back now.<eos> Hello, Bingo Bashers!<eos> [ALL CHEERING]<eos> Now, as you all know, each year at the end of the Bash we crown the two people who really stood out as the lives of the party.
[BOTH GROWLING]<eos> Not so fast, boyo.<eos> We're putting an end to this party once and for all.<eos> There'll be no more captains.<eos> It ends with us.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please, don't hurt us.<eos> Yeah, please.<eos> Don't come after us.<eos> (BELLE) You?
(BELLE) You?<eos> No. Obviously it'd be them we're after.<eos> Aye.<eos> They'd be the obvious choice for captains.<eos> Us? You really think so?<eos> Jinkies!<eos> Guys!<eos> - (BOTH) Sorry.<eos> - Aye!<eos> You're the ones everyone follows.
No. Obviously it'd be them we're after.<eos> Aye.<eos> They'd be the obvious choice for captains.<eos> Us? You really think so?<eos> Jinkies!<eos> Guys!<eos> - (BOTH) Sorry.<eos> - Aye!<eos> You're the ones everyone follows.<eos> And you're the ones we're gonna stop.
Huh?<eos> Boy, how about those pirates thinking we deserve to be Bash Captains.<eos> Maybe we could discuss this sometime when we're not running for our lives.<eos> On the one hand, it's pretty flattering. On the other hand, though, it really threw my plan for a loop.<eos> Fred, that's it!<eos> A loop!<eos> Hey, everyone, try to lure them over to the roller coaster.<eos> Shaggy, Scooby, come with me.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> (VELMA) We're over here, you soggy bilge rats.
Scooby, old pal, this is it.<eos> - My one regret... - [WHIMPERING] ...is that I didn't eat more Scooby Snacks. [BOTH SCREAM]<eos> [ALL SCREAM]<eos> - Yikes!<eos> - (DAPHNE) Oh!<eos> [PIRATES GROANING]<eos> Now to see who these pirates really are.<eos> (ALL) Chad and Krissy!<eos> [ALL GASP]<eos> Oh, kids, how could you?
Ooh, but I never get to do these.<eos> Ah, fine.<eos> It was the Sheriff and the Deputy.<eos> We saw them building office furniture out of pieces of your roller coaster in order to hide the evidence.<eos> They wanted to destroy tourism so they wouldn't have to work so hard.<eos> Huh, so you're saying I didn't do any of the crimes this weekend?<eos> Weird. I would have put my money on me.<eos> I mean, I'm such a greedy businessman.<eos> That's right, we did it.<eos> So what? How are you going to arrest us?
That'd be great.<eos> Oh! Oh, no you don't.<eos> You!<eos> What am I gonna do with you?<eos> Take you to jail, that's what.<eos> Well, bye again, everybody.<eos> (ALL) Bye.<eos> Well, I guess that's everything.<eos> Not totally.<eos> Don't you wanna know where the hidden treasure is?
By my estimation there should be enough there to rebuild the boardwalk.<eos> But the Holdouts already sold the boardwalk to Mr. Monkfish.<eos> Ah, go ahead and take it back.<eos> We've already had too many bad guys today as is.<eos> (ALL) Yay!<eos> I'm sorry I ever doubted you.<eos> Ah, who could blame you, I'm very unlikable.<eos> Fred, Velma, I think I speak for everybody here when I say, we want to name the two of you this year's Captains of the Bash.<eos> [ALL CHEERING]<eos> Yeah, you guys might not be the loosest cats around, but you never gave up on the party and that's the true spirit of the Bash.
And, um, also, I noticed there's come all over my tits. It's...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just, you know, if there's a... I hate to complain.<eos> If there's an upgrade to be had, I would... in I'd take it."<eos> Can you hear me when I just talk like this?<eos> This is a good sound system.<eos> You can hear me when I just talk like this?<eos> I, uh, got laser hair removal.<eos> And...<eos> Did you just applaud that?
I, uh, got laser hair removal.<eos> And...<eos> Did you just applaud that?<eos> You're like, "Finally."<eos> I got laser hair removal.<eos> I waited a really long time to do it.<eos> I wanted the science to be at its peak.<eos> You know, like, we landed on Mars...<eos> I think it was August 2012.<eos> Are you just impressed that I remember the date?
It said, "I just spent the morning with a woman who watched her son get murdered."<eos> And I was like, "You think that's bad?"<eos> 'Cause I have...<eos> I have a hard time with perspective.<eos> Like, I don't gain it with experience, I guess.<eos> I was walking around here in Los Angeles, judging people.<eos> And that's not me being my best self.<eos> I'm not proud of it.<eos> But that was just the scenario.<eos> And I remember just thinking, like, "You fucking... petty, small-minded, materialistic twats.

It holds shit.<eos> Get a backpack. You're silly.<eos> You know? I'm like, "You don't even get it.
Now it's ruined.<eos> It's not a throwaway joke anymore. But it was.<eos> This is probably for two people in the audience, but I would say a throwaway joke is cool... the way that it's cool, like...<eos> I play basketball.<eos> If you, like, during a pickup game, you make, like, a sweet three-point shot, and then afterwards, you don't smile.<eos> You just go right back into defense.<eos> That's the same coolness of a throwaway joke. All right.<eos> So...<eos> That's never gotten a laugh before.<eos> Well, you didn't have to undo it.
It's going down, all the way down to the ground.<eos> And she finally finishes throwing up, and she whips her head around to see who's there.<eos> But she didn't see anybody.<eos> Because she had been shitting herself.<eos> That's... That's a true story.<eos> I'm gonna say...<eos> Like, I would call that a relief laugh.<eos> Or, like, a release laugh.<eos> I know that I'm your show.<eos> But you have to understand, like, you're my show.

Oh, literally, yay."<eos> My sister came to visit me.<eos> Not the "shitting in her pants" sister, but the, um... My oldest sister.<eos> Although, I'm sure she's shit her pants.<eos> She's a Silverman, after all.<eos> Uh, no, this is my oldest sister, Susie.<eos> She is a rabbi.<eos> She lives in Jerusalem.<eos> Um... "Oh, my God, a godless comedian and, like, a total God-person rabbi are sisters?<eos> What must that be like?" is something you can muse about in the car.
Okay.<eos> So, uh... she only has, like, the big, fat, shiny part of the breast that guys jerk off to.<eos> We have to protect our daughters... from the life-nourishing nipple.<eos> We... That's just too obscene.<eos> No nipples.<eos> We can't have our daughters seeing what nourishes life.<eos> Just the part that can sandwich a hard cock.<eos> No pubic hair.<eos> That is attainable.<eos> You're right, audience.

Thanks for keeping me honest.
Abortion does kill, like, your whole day.<eos> It literally sucks the life out of you.<eos> Look, I know those last two jokes, they aren't smart.<eos> They have nothing deep to say.<eos> They're just wordplay.<eos> But I love them like my... very own aborted fetuses.<eos> Put a pin in that.<eos> Congratulations, Texas.<eos> Texas was almost the third state... uh, but then a judge put the kibosh on it.<eos> You should know this. I'm not blaming you for not knowing about this law, because we've been... Just atrocity after atrocity has been coming at us every day.

"Looks like you can't drive.<eos> You got a smashed headlight." It's exactly that.<eos> And violating...<eos> Infantilizing laws about abortion where women have to think about it.<eos> Go home for three days and think about it.<eos> Yeah, I think I've been thinking about it, fuckface.<eos> Or, like...<eos> Violating ultrasounds, you know, where they shove a camera inside you and make you look at the ultrasound and see the life in your uterus.<eos> And... Put a pin in that for a second.<eos> Because I have another fun fact for you you're gonna love.
But... sperm cells...<eos> Sarah, come on, focus.<eos> This is a big night.<eos> This is serious, though.<eos> Sperm cells have a sense of smell.<eos> They have olfactory senses.<eos> That's true.<eos> And you know what that means.<eos> That means that sperm is life.<eos> And you know what that means.
They have olfactory senses.<eos> That's true.<eos> And you know what that means.<eos> That means that sperm is life.<eos> And you know what that means.<eos> We've gotta legislate that shit.<eos> We have to protect the babies.<eos> I...

The next time you feel like you're gonna jerk off into a gym sock or down your shower drain or, uh...<eos> I don't know why, I peg you as an "on the belly" guy.<eos> It doesn't matter, though.<eos> It doesn't matter. Whatever your jerk-off style, there is no judgment here.<eos> I was right, wasn't I?<eos> I have a sense.<eos> If only that was a superpower that could help the world.<eos> But...<eos> This is what we're gonna do.<eos> Before you do jerk off, whatever style it is...
If only that was a superpower that could help the world.<eos> But...<eos> This is what we're gonna do.<eos> Before you do jerk off, whatever style it is...<eos> I feel like keeping going.<eos> Like... you are like a hands-free fucking the mattress.<eos> Like, you're just flat...<eos> Blink once if...<eos> I knew it!<eos> You guys are humoring me.

Come on, Sarah.<eos> Before you do it, you're gonna come on down to the clinic.
Um, yeah, because we're here.<eos> Jesus is coming back.<eos> Oh, on my back.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> It was water.<eos> He turned it to come.<eos> How clever is that?<eos> I don't know if there's God.<eos> I mean, I cannot imagine there's God. But I don't know.<eos> Neither do you, you know?
Paula is my client now, and I don't wanna have to worry about you sticking your nose in a case that you think you can handle better than me. - I don't think...<eos> - Because if you could handle it better than me, you would, but you can't, because you're too involved, and you know it.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - She's in good hands. - I'll stay out of your way.<eos> - Ah, no. Not good enough.<eos> I want your word, because I will drop it right now.<eos> - Okay, Louis, you have my word.<eos> Everything okay with you and Louis?<eos> Why?<eos> - 'Cause he said he was handling a matter for you, but he wouldn't tell me what it was, and five minutes ago I saw the two of you having an intense discussion.
Who was that?<eos> Oh, just an old friend.<eos> Now, how about that ice cream?<eos> You came back.<eos> Zoe, there's so much to tell you.<eos> Speculative, made-up gossip, she means.<eos> It's not made up.<eos> Horse thieves are real. Horse thieves?<eos> Shh!<eos> You'll upset Bob.
Right, gang. Listen up.<eos> So, Pony People Magazine are visiting the yard today.<eos> It's Vogue for horses.<eos> Didn't know horses could read.<eos> This is our chance to let the stables shine, to spread the word about Bright Fields and bring lots and lots of new riders our way.<eos> Well, hopefully, anyway.<eos> Speaking of which, this is Zoe.<eos> She found Raven, so we owe her big time.<eos> Let's make her really welcome.<eos> If you can't find a chore that needs doing, just come and find Marcus or me.
What?<eos> Um, I thought you were feeding Monty.<eos> Ah, no. Change of plan.<eos> There are three keys.<eos> One for you, one for me, one for the office. Thanks.<eos> You're sure the sedatives were stolen, and you just...<eos> I'm not losing my mind, Marcus.<eos> Yesterday, the shelf was full, now half the packets are gone.<eos> Someone's taken them.<eos> Did you hear that?

Thanks.<eos> You're sure the sedatives were stolen, and you just...<eos> I'm not losing my mind, Marcus.<eos> Yesterday, the shelf was full, now half the packets are gone.<eos> Someone's taken them.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Horse thieves.<eos> You know I'm right. You know it.
Ben's is in the courtyard.<eos> I just need you and Becky to join.<eos> If you just click the waving badger...<eos> Oh, cute.<eos> So, if Pin does try anything with the horses, we'll see him.<eos> Okay, Bob's ready for his secret mission.<eos> Great.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Wait, no, no.<eos> Hold on, you guys are leaving?
Let's get out of here.<eos> Wait, no, no.<eos> Hold on, you guys are leaving?<eos> Sorry, Zoe, me and Ben have to earn our pony-camp fees.<eos> - Guys, I can't guard the horses on my own.<eos> - You're not on your own.<eos> Look, Pin Cam's up and running, and we'll all be watching.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ben, wait for us.<eos> If you're not packing a block-color tote, you really don't have reason to live.
Rosie... I thought we had a special bond.<eos> I thought we were close, like sisters.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Zoe's not allowed to be riding.<eos> Like, at all. If my mom knew we were here, she would totally flip.<eos> Zoe's not allowed to ride?<eos> That's so sad.<eos> Hey, Zoe!<eos> Wait up!<eos> Where have you been?
You'd look amazing.<eos> Rosie, what do you think?<eos> I think your hair...<eos> is the definition of perfect.<eos> Thanks, Rosie.<eos> Can I still keep the bag?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's nice to know that I've got at least one honest friend.<eos> Hi.<eos> That's okay, you guys are here now.
'Cause it'll make you sad?<eos> Because I need to make room for my new horse's kit.<eos> That reminds me. I was online shopping...<eos> What about your dad, Rosie?<eos> What's he like?<eos> How come he stayed behind in America?<eos> Because of work.<eos> Uh, but he's coming to visit us really, really soon.<eos> That's so great.<eos> So, you'll be together again.
Like a ghost in the night.<eos> Like ghost pony, you mean?<eos> Not funny Becky.<eos> Or it's horse thieves.<eos> In the yard.<eos> On horseback?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Becky.<eos> Do you think it's Sam?
Come on.<eos> Becky.<eos> Do you think it's Sam?<eos> Why would Sam be riding at night?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're doing great, Maggie.<eos> Mom?<eos> Well, this is unexpected.<eos> What are you girls doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?
You know what, sis?<eos> You were right.<eos> Horses are way cooler than quad bikes.<eos> Mind putting him back and giving his bum a clean?<eos> Nothing would make me happier.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> And so disgusting.<eos> Becky, I officially take it back.<eos> Bob is impossible.<eos> You guys are made for each other. Aww.
I thought you believed in Ghost Pony.<eos> Okay, wait, what?<eos> Okay, that's not the face of someone who's about to ride their favorite horse.<eos> I upset Jade and Becky.<eos> Mmm, Pin hates me.<eos> Marcus is being very... British.<eos> And Bob ate my prom dress.<eos> I thought my life was complicated.<eos> Look, Zoe, it's not the mistakes that matter. It's what you do about them that counts.<eos> Why don't you two show me what you can do?
Enjoy jail, George.<eos> If that's even your real name.<eos> Don't give us evils just because you got totally owned by Pony Squad.<eos> Well, Becky, you wanted to catch Ghost Pony, and instead you caught a horse thief.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> You can't catch a ghost with a net.<eos> It'd go right through it.<eos> I can help you make a new trap.<eos> I mean, if you need a hand with ghost catching.<eos> Well, guys, this hug would be really awkward if you were still mad at me.
Derek said...<eos> Who cares what Derek says?<eos> He could still be here.<eos> We have to go look for him.<eos> Come on, let's go, people.<eos> But we can't leave now.<eos> We promised Sam we'd meet her here.<eos> I can't believe you guys are all just sitting here.<eos> Fine.<eos> If you guys aren't gonna help me,
I'll go by myself.<eos> This isn't about you, Zoe.<eos> For once in your life, this is not about you.<eos> Guys, listen.<eos> The ferries weren't running last night.<eos> Really?<eos> That means that Raven could still be on the island.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Somewhere out there, there's a horse that's been through unimaginable things, and it's happening to him all over again.<eos> Sure, we've only got a tiny chance of finding him, but wouldn't you rather know that you tried?
I want you to make me fall in love... with your character.<eos> "I'm so sorry I didn't call before!<eos> There's been a lot going on!"<eos> Perfect. I mean...<eos> "Thank goodness you called me, soldier.<eos> Now, here's what I need you to do."<eos> Guys, we really need to be getting back now.<eos> Susie's right.<eos> The storm's getting close.<eos> Sure. You guys go back.
Hmm.<eos> Did Sam talk you round?<eos> I guess I can't let... all our training go to waste.<eos> Yes! Now we're totally gonna win.<eos> Yeah, if I don't fall... or bolt.<eos> Or humiliate myself in some other wonderful way.<eos> Never gonna happen.<eos> Ah... You're amazing, you know that?<eos> Pin's a lucky guy.<eos> You guys are good together.
You may own him, but you don't know him.<eos> Not like I do.<eos> And you definitely don't know what's best for him.<eos> He's not just some super valuable racehorse.<eos> He's a frightened, messed up runaway, who's found a safe home and people who love him.<eos> And you can't just waltz in and expect...<eos> Fine?<eos> What do you mean, fine?<eos> I'm no fool.<eos> I can see the bond between the two of you.
So fucking dumb.<eos> And now, please welcome, Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland.<eos> Oh, hey! I know you.<eos> [both] Oh, hello.<eos> - Charmed I'm sure, I'm Gil Faizon<eos> - And I am George St. Geegland.<eos> And we are two legendary bachelors who live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.<eos> Which is the coffee breath of neighborhoods.<eos> We want to give a shout-out to the mezzanine and the balcony!<eos> You guys are the reason we do this show!
I could name so many titles of his plays, but I'm gonna walk over here now.<eos> And what's this right here? A trapdoor, yes.<eos> This is the trapdoor from the set of The Diary of Anne Frank.<eos> Not to be confused with the diary of Anne Hathaway which we stole out of her purse at the Gotham Awards.<eos> And what's inside?<eos> Oh, no, what's this?<eos> Oh, me, oh, my!<eos> It's the pillowman from Martin McDonagh's The Pillowman.<eos> And for those you at the crappy sightline who can't see this, raise your hand. Raise your hands if you can't see this.<eos> So what you're missing is...
- Good, that's good to hear.<eos> - Thank you for that measured compliment.<eos> Let's put it this way, I have great hopes from here on out.<eos> Oh, that's so nice. You yourself are a playwright of some great esteem.<eos> Well, thank you very much.<eos> - But I think you've nailed it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You nailed the essence of playwriting.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> By the way, you know what Mike Nichols told me once.
When you're doing an amphitheater, Steve Martin, 1979.<eos> You're doing an amphitheater.<eos> You're doing a Hollywood Bowl.<eos> What are you making for that night?<eos> Well, in those days, I was criticized for charging a high price.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Ten dollars.<eos> - You know how much these... - I know.<eos> I've been trying to get into your show for so long, and I could not get a free ticket.<eos> And then tonight, you said, if I could come on stage with you.
Well, I'll have two more root beers, please.<eos> Ravi in the booth.<eos> Mr. Steve Martin.<eos> Great.<eos> That was great.<eos> - Could you get us a couple of slices?<eos> - Get one for yourself.<eos> - Pizza you want?<eos> - Pizza is nice.<eos> You want pizza?
You guys, I'm really gonna miss this place.
Uh, can anyone say, "Lame"?<eos> Put that thing down.<eos> Hey, babe, did you remember to bring the box fan?<eos> - Those cabins get really hot.<eos> - Uh, no, I thought you were bringing it.<eos> J.J., stop it!<eos> [gasps] There it is!<eos> Camp Firewood!<eos> [Arty] Good morning, everybody.<eos> Well, it's the last day of camp, so once again, it's time for all of you to grab that one last kiss, last dance, last... [chuckles] Well, you know what I mean.

[chuckles] Well, you know what I mean.<eos> There are certain things I can't say on a family radio station, folks. [Laughs]<eos> Ah, y'all just got stung by your humble servant, the Beekeeper himself, manning the controls for the tenth summer in a row.<eos> And preparations are in full swing for tonight's last blast, End of Summer Night's Dream Dance, up in the barn.<eos> But that's gonna be a night time thang.<eos> Oh, and don't worry if you see any old fogies wandering around the grounds today.
The baby is here!<eos> No, wait. Nancy, you have not washed your hands yet.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> - No, you have not.<eos> - Hey, everyone. This is our nanny, Renata.<eos> - Hi.<eos> It's just for the weekend.<eos> Susie!<eos> [both laughing] - Oh, my God!<eos> - You have a freaking baby!
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - [chuckles] - This is gonna be a really fun weekend.<eos> Yeah, I... I guess so.<eos> - [Victor] Whoo! - [Beth] Okay, guys.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Everybody, everybody, everybody.<eos> Hand goes up, mouths go shut.<eos> [all boo]<eos> You may all be in your mid-20s, but here at Firewood, you're campers.
- Vagina.<eos> And of course, the Shakespearean-inspired barn dance later tonight.<eos> - [all] Chu-ay! [Beth] Okay, go get unpacked, 'cause the first order of business is chill time by the water.<eos> - Okay, here we go.<eos> - You got this. You got this.<eos> - Yeah, buddy.<eos> Ah, rafter ball.<eos> - You're going down, Gar.<eos> - Go for it, man.<eos> So, you and Claire still aren't married, huh?
I think not!<eos> He's still a virgin.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Oh, man, I took some good naps on these camp beds back in the day.<eos> Wonder if they still got the magic touch, if you know what I mean. [Chuckles]<eos> Hey, you guys, wake me up in a couple hours.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Oh, my God, Katie, look!<eos> - [all] Oh! - [Abby] Oh, my God, remember Andy?<eos> [all exclaim] Oh, you and Andy were such piping hot shit back in the day.
Winning a medal at the Olympics. He's the guy.<eos> And the problem is, the rest of the world is way ahead of us.<eos> You know, the rest of the world, amateur boxers make a living boxing.<eos> Ours don't.<eos> In 2016, you're gonna see the true amateur that we develop here in the United States and we've done since the early 1900s for the Olympics, you're gonna see them competing against pros.<eos> And so, that's gonna be a big challenge for our athletes.<eos> We have the impression... Everyone in the world, we have the impression that USA is the number one nation in everything.<eos> - You are, like, the big brother. Yeah.<eos> - We have so many athletes.<eos> Like, you take care of it.

- Hard work!<eos> - What does the "A" stand for?<eos> - Attitude!<eos> - What does the "M" stand for?<eos> - Motivation.<eos> Y'all don't sound motivated. What?<eos> Motivation!<eos> - What does the "P" stand for?<eos> - Patience!<eos> Okay, you take those words, I promise you, you can very, very much be successful.
- Do you know?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> Those things happen.<eos> Real fighters win, lose, lose their belts, get them back.<eos> He's undefeated, though.<eos> Then something must have happened.<eos> I think he, uh...<eos> Let me think. I think he went to the monastery for a while.<eos> Peter Quillin announced that he would be vacating his title.<eos> I'm sure you guys heard.
College is easier than high school.<eos> - He's a fighter.<eos> Look at you.<eos> - I'm ready, man.<eos> I ain't even worried. I just wanna get this shit over with.<eos> Let's go! Let's go!<eos> Let's go! Let's walk, guys!<eos> Showtime!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Camera guys, you're holding me up.
Son of a bitch! You wanted to get two bodies on us!<eos> Stop it, Ramón!<eos> Let him go.<eos> If you want to get out of this mess, you'll have to show me some respect.<eos> Who killed the cardinal, Chino?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> Now, your only problem is how to get out of this.<eos> This is all your fault!<eos> It's you who should get us out of this!<eos> Ten million and you're out.

It is a nice igloo.<eos> All right. I need to find some kids to bring this igloo in that school.<eos> I don't want Paige to have a breakdown.<eos> She's hanging on by a thread already.<eos> Something is up with you.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Did you get into a fight with Evan? No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Have a great time.<eos> Oh, girls! Look how great you all look. So beautiful.

You look so good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you see the igloo? I made this igloo.<eos> You like this?<eos> Pretty good, right?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> I even used the stuffing from Paige's murdered penguin as a snow base.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm gonna go stand by it and make sure no bozos spill punch on it.<eos> Okay, you girls, you look magical.
And I should have been more mature, so, um, how about this? I'll race you to the top of those steps. And if I win, then you have to love me back.<eos> That sounds fair.<eos> Doesn't it? Mmhmm.<eos> Go!<eos> I totally love you.<eos> Hey, Doug.<eos> Having fun?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Sure.<eos> You?
Villains.<eos> You think you can beat Puss in Boots?
I heard you say "choose the Evil Queen." So be it.<eos> No!<eos> I did not.<eos> Your choice is made.<eos> The prince!<eos> The prince is here to awaken Snow White.<eos> Uh... I see.<eos> I am the prince.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hmm... You are less tall than usual.
No!<eos> I did not.<eos> Your choice is made.<eos> The prince!<eos> The prince is here to awaken Snow White.<eos> Uh... I see.<eos> I am the prince.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hmm... You are less tall than usual.<eos> Are you Dwarves? Should there not be seven?
Which is why I know that in order to be a good boyfriend to Julia, I need a practice girlfriend first.<eos> You get good at something when you do it repeatedly... when you get into a routine.<eos> Casey.<eos> Why does my todo list say "Remove stick from butt!"?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it's on there, you got to do it, right?<eos> You guys need fuel after your run?<eos> I made cinnamon buns. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I got all the sugar I need right here.<eos> Did you know there are 432 girls at our school and 91 of them have a name that starts with an M, which is 21%, and the national average is only... 9%?
I think she's with the boyfriend.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> Go to Kennedy Park.<eos> They hang out there.<eos> Let's go by there.<eos> Let's kill him. Take it easy, Chuck.<eos> No, we're gonna kill him.<eos> Chapter eight... photosynthesis.<eos> Who's excited?<eos> You guys all read this last night in your...
I bet he's really wild in the sack.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I make J.J. hang out with me so much, he doesn't have time for a real girlfriend of his own.<eos> Now let's switch to your story line, Susie.<eos> - Give us the 411 on Garth MacArthur. - Yeah!<eos> British guys are so hot.<eos> We're just making a movie together. That's all!<eos> Liar, liar, pants on fire! Hang your pants from a telephone wire!<eos> Fine!<eos> If you guys want the dirty daily, I'll give you the dirty daily.
- Andy!<eos> - Oh! He's doing donuts!<eos> Yeah, boy!<eos> Get them donuts!<eos> - He's doing donuts!<eos> Andy's doing donuts!<eos> - Andy's doing donuts!<eos> "I wish Andy would take a bite of me."<eos> "I know. I wish Andy would take a bite of me, too."<eos> Well, you're both in luck, donuts.
Well, that's what I want, too.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I finish up these blueprints.<eos> But I want you to go now.<eos> - Have some fun!<eos> - Okay. Hey!<eos> These blueprints really are quite literally kicking my ass.<eos> Beth, we've talked, and we've decided we're not gonna let you sell the camp!<eos> - Absolutely not!<eos> - We demand an explanation!<eos> You need to understand something.
Goodness gracious. Me, oh, my.<eos> Katie, you look as stunning as ever.<eos> Andy, my old dance partner.<eos> That is one heck of a goatee you're sporting.<eos> I know.<eos> Long time no see, old friends.<eos> What brings you to our side of the lake?<eos> We, uh, want to talk to you about something.<eos> It's important.<eos> Hmm. Important, you say?
- What was that?<eos> - It's...<eos> It's a proposition of sorts.<eos> - That's what he said?<eos> - Yeah. Victor, Donna and I wish to have a child.<eos> But my seed, it is, uh...<eos> like the Midbar Yehuda.<eos> It is, uh, arid, harsh... lifeless.<eos> We want you to be our sperm donor.<eos> Oh, you guys are going to do artificial insemination?
- Ha!<eos> Very good. Katie, how are your parents?<eos> Last I heard, they were changing their tennis court from grass to clay.<eos> Oh, yes, their second serve has a lot more bite now.<eos> Hmm. Uh, guys, I am about to harmonize.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Oh, poodles!<eos> We're talking shop.<eos> Oh, poo!<eos> Well, do come join the fun when you're done.
That's our first, best, and last offer.<eos> We pray it is sufficient.<eos> - You know what to do.<eos> You got yourself a deal, Blake.<eos> - You'll regret this.<eos> - Bye-bye now!<eos> - Walk out.<eos> - Bye-bye. We'll arrange for the transfer of the money this afternoon.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> You've saved the spirit of Camp Firewood.
You? I can't believe I didn't see you there.<eos> They're in on it?<eos> I knew those old junior counselors wouldn't let me buy Firewood off with money.<eos> So I gave them something they value more than anything else in the world.<eos> The childish belief that they actually make a difference.<eos> And I saved $9,900,000.<eos> Firewood is mine!<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you hear something?
Easy, now.<eos> Okay, I think I get it, Katie.<eos> - Do you? - Yeah, I do.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - I'm pretty sure.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Yeah, it is good.<eos> The theme for tonight's dance is an End-Summer Night's Dream, a clever play on A Midsummer Night's Dream that I came up with by myself last night before bed.<eos> Now, you're gonna be standing by the door, greeting people as they come in.<eos> So I really need you to embody the roles of Theseus, Hippolyta, Puck, and Bottom.
I wanna say Godot, but we're still waiting on that one.<eos> I'm teasing.<eos> Susie, please say something!<eos> Teach these kids.<eos> Let them bask in the glow of your words. Sculpt their souls.<eos> Logan, I couldn't.<eos> We won't take no for an answer.<eos> Right, kids?<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> If you insist.
Iambic pentameter.<eos> - Okay, everybody, stand up.<eos> - Actually, don't.<eos> Susie, we're 40 minutes into class. They've warmed up.<eos> - Oh, sorry, I...<eos> - No, do your thing.<eos> Do your thing, but we can't be jerking the kids around like this.<eos> Okay? It's a little reckless.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, well, you're already warmed up.
Go to this address. All your questions will be answered.<eos> - Hey. How are ya? Sorry to bother you.<eos> Listen, whatever youâ€™re selling, weâ€™re not interested.<eos> - Iâ€™m a journalist, please.<eos> - Like I said, we're not interested.<eos> Can we talk? I just...<eos> The thing is, I just need ten minutes of your time.<eos> - Seven.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Each of you must make up a song about... dinosaurs!
Can we talk? I just...<eos> The thing is, I just need ten minutes of your time.<eos> - Seven.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Each of you must make up a song about... dinosaurs!<eos> Go!<eos> - ♪ Brontosaurus ♪ - ♪ Where did you go ♪<eos> - ♪ Stegosaurus ♪ - ♪ My friends, dinosaurs ♪<eos> ♪ Don't forget the pterodactyl ♪<eos> ♪ Why did you leave me On the verge of extinction ♪
You know what happens now.<eos> - Loser! Loser! Loser!<eos> This is total bull jizz!<eos> I should've won.<eos> Yeah, why don't you go cry in your bunk about it?<eos> Idiot.<eos> So, Beth, we just need you to put your John Hancock here and here.<eos> Oh, you know what? I've been meaning to give you something for ten years.<eos> Remember these?<eos> From that night you came to destroy the camp?
- Loser! Loser!

I've been meaning to give you something for ten years.<eos> Remember these?<eos> From that night you came to destroy the camp?<eos> But you didn't. Instead, you saved us from Ronald Reagan.
[Beth] Run, run, run!<eos> What are you even doing?<eos> Lunch ended, like, yesterday.<eos> Iâ€™m waiting for Garth, my boyfriend.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> Your boyfriend? [chortling]<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> -What's what supposed to mean? -You chortled.<eos> Just surprised you have a boyfriend, that's all.<eos> You seem fairly unlovable to me.
Who wants to get down?<eos> Finally, somebody's having a good time.<eos> Victor got laid!<eos> Ladies and germs, I am an ice-cold Maytag re-fuck-erator.<eos> We all know you're a virgin, Vic.<eos> Correction.<eos> I was a virgin.<eos> Not no more.<eos> I didded the deed, and then I spreaded my seed.<eos> Hey, have you guys ever tried the thing at the end--
I didded the deed, and then I spreaded my seed.<eos> Hey, have you guys ever tried the thing at the end--<eos> Enough, Victor!<eos> It's like your weenie's a volcano, but it's not hot lava, it's like hair conditioner?<eos> -Vic!<eos> -No, no, but it's like stuff comes out.<eos> Stop!<eos> This whole act is getting a little pathetic, dude.<eos> I'm not lying, man.<eos> I'm like you guys now.
Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I was so stupid.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> You weren't stupid.<eos> You were just in love.<eos> Hey, do you want to dance?<eos> No.<eos> - We need a map.<eos> - Boys... you know what to do.
Above ground?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> That's a suicide mission. We'd never come back alive.<eos> Reagan's security would see to that.<eos> I'd rather die a hero than live a coward.<eos> Let's go, brother.<eos> If Eric and I manage to turn on that tracker, you know what to do.<eos> Calm down, J.J.<eos> There's gotta be something we can do!<eos> There's nothing you can do.
For long before President Reagan was leader of the free world, he was just a young boy who came to this very summer camp in 1921.<eos> It's not true.<eos> And he wasn't just any camper.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He was a legend.<eos> Weren't you, sir?<eos> For Ronald Wilson Reagan is none other than Little Willie-Shits-His-Pants.<eos> It's not true!<eos> Ronald Wilson Reagan!<eos> Don't you see?
For Ronald Wilson Reagan is none other than Little Willie-Shits-His-Pants.<eos> It's not true!<eos> Ronald Wilson Reagan!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> Willie is short for Wilson!<eos> -You're right!<eos> -Willie is short for Wilson!<eos> Oh, hi, boys.<eos> You gotta get outta here. You're not safe.<eos> Actually, boys, it's you who aren't safe.
Willie is short for Wilson!<eos> -You're right!<eos> -Willie is short for Wilson!<eos> Oh, hi, boys.<eos> You gotta get outta here. You're not safe.<eos> Actually, boys, it's you who aren't safe.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Reagan is here, and he has a nuke.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> The only question is... do you get it?
Actually, boys, it's you who aren't safe.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Reagan is here, and he has a nuke.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> The only question is... do you get it?<eos> She's the mole.<eos> She's been the mole the whole time.<eos> I don't know what they're paying you, but this is madness.<eos> Thousands of lives are at stake.<eos> The only madness is you thinking I'm gonna let you anywhere near that nuke.
Hi.<eos> This is Full Professor Henry Neumann, NASA space engineer.<eos> Uh, yes, I need authorization to put the Strategic Defense Initiative, Star Wars, online at command control base 3426.<eos> - We're online.<eos> - Okay, put me close to the transponder.<eos> Bravo, uncle, theta, one, two, zero, eight... four.<eos> -He did it! The bastard did it!<eos> -Thank you, Henry.<eos> Okay. Hope that was okay.<eos> Let me know if you want to do it again.
Greg?<eos> Didn't you get shot?<eos> Guys, guys, wait for me!<eos> I love you! I love you, guys!<eos> I love you all so much!<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> -Are we...<eos> -Are we dead?<eos> You're alive. You're very much alive.
-Are we dead?<eos> You're alive. You're very much alive.<eos> Congratulations, Camp Firewood.<eos> -Well played. -Well played.<eos> - Well played? - Well played?<eos> It was all a game.<eos> - So none of this was real?<eos> - Nope.<eos> We wanted to teach you a lesson.<eos> And I thought you could use a little of the old spirit of Camp Firewood back in your lives.
What does this mean for the yen?<eos> And what does this mean for you?<eos> Firewood Grille.<eos> No, we're, uh, closed for a private event.<eos> Bon appã©tit.<eos> Susie, I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> Me, too. Worked out great.<eos> We're scouting in the Bronx for my movie.<eos> We got financing and we start shooting in two weeks.<eos> -Oh, you got financing.
Jesus of Nazareth.<eos> Look, I'm carrying a short sword and a whip.<eos> Try again.<eos> Trevor Belmont.<eos> House of Belmont. Last son of the Belmont family.<eos> Happy now?<eos> No.<eos> Oi!<eos> Fucking face down here!<eos> That's how you want it?
God forbid you should warn anyone before emptying your fucking shit pots.<eos> Never thought I'd be so hungry I'd climb a shit pipe in pursuit of breakfast.<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> What will one coin buy me?<eos> Bit of dried goat.<eos> Haven't seen you before.<eos> I'm just passing through.<eos> I'll take it, thanks.<eos> You want to pass through quicker.<eos> Yeah, I guess you've got some troubles here.
No, I'm merely talking to you.<eos> Anyone can see that we are not responsible for what befalls Gresit.<eos> No, keep walking.<eos> So, now I'm stupid?<eos> I work within the light of God Himself, but you can see things I can't with your magic?<eos> There's no magic, sir.<eos> We are here to help, that's all.<eos> Speakers don't help.<eos> Speakers are tainted.<eos> You attract evil, and you and yours were told to be out of Gresit by sunset.
Will killing an old man make you less scared of the dark?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it will just make me feel better.<eos> Oh, hell.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was trying to snatch the stave out of your hand.<eos> How's your finger?<eos> What fucking finger? !<eos> That's no way for a man of the cloth to talk.<eos> Why don't you go and get that looked at?
I'm sorry.<eos> I was trying to snatch the stave out of your hand.<eos> How's your finger?<eos> What fucking finger? !<eos> That's no way for a man of the cloth to talk.<eos> Why don't you go and get that looked at?<eos> Kill the bastard!<eos> Look, I don't like priests at the best of times.<eos> I mean, I really, really don't like priests.<eos> If you leave now, we'll say no more about it.
Don't bother this man or his people again.<eos> The violence wasn't necessary, sir.<eos> But... it is appreciated.<eos> I am the elder of the Codrii Speakers.<eos> Thank you for your kindness and, I think, your restraint.<eos> You're welcome, Elder.<eos> Can I accompany you to your train?<eos> We have settled here in Gresit. No caravans.<eos> But I would be glad of your company on the way to our lodging.<eos> How many are you?

Please, come inside.<eos> Meet my people.<eos> Elder, we were worried about you.<eos> I told you it was too soon to go outdoors.<eos> And I told you it was necessary to offer aid to the people.<eos> However, I was met by some of the Christian priests.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Thanks to this man.<eos> Although I fear there may be trouble ahead because of it.<eos> What did you do?

That is why we are here.<eos> May as well tell him the rest.<eos> In Speaker history, there is an old story, a legend, probably.<eos> I like stories.<eos> The story says that a savior sleeps under Gresit, a great hero who sleeps until he is needed, until there is a darkness upon the land.<eos> Oh, I heard that one.<eos> The Sleeping Soldier.<eos> It's a local legend.<eos> Sounds weirdly convenient to me, if you know what I mean.<eos> Exactly how much do you know about this, sir?

Has not returned.<eos> Isn't there a head man in Gresit you could go to?
Yes.<eos> That one went into the catacombs under the mausoleum west of the church. Has not returned.<eos> Isn't there a head man in Gresit you could go to?<eos> He died in the first horde attack.<eos> Our searches have been unsuccessful.<eos> So, what are your plans?<eos> Find some more food, find some drink, get drunk, eat some food, move on.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Maybe find a tall tree, sit in it, watch the show before I move on, all the good little people dying horribly, all that.<eos> You feel no compassion?
- Maybe find a tall tree, sit in it, watch the show before I move on, all the good little people dying horribly, all that.<eos> You feel no compassion?<eos> This is what the church wanted.<eos> My family were the only people who could've fought Dracula and his army, but they didn't want us.<eos> They wanted to fight the darkness on their own terms, good luck to them.<eos> But the ordinary people of Wallachia, they didn't get the choice.<eos> For evil bastards to win power, all ordinary people have to do is stand aside and keep quiet.<eos> There's always a choice.<eos> Well, find a good tall tree.<eos> You can watch us die, too.
Head south, hook up with another train.<eos> - It's his grandchild.<eos> - Arn!<eos> I don't care! It's the elder's grandchild down there.<eos> We can't even bury them.<eos> It's not our way to just leave our dead unattended to!<eos> We stay for the people of Gresit.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> But we also stay because we hope...<eos> So, you're staying to die with the good people of Gresit, not just because it's a good thing to do, but because you don't have your grandchild's body?

Give your aid to the survivors when the night horde finally just rips through this place.<eos> Why would you do that?
If I go and recover your kid's body, will you please leave?<eos> Wait outside the city. Give your aid to the survivors when the night horde finally just rips through this place.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> They're going to come for you soon.<eos> The good people.<eos> It's gonna be a pogrom.<eos> They were talking about it in the marketplace this morning.<eos> I don't think you answered my question.<eos> I know what it's like to be persecuted by your own country for the accident of your birth.<eos> If I find your grandchild, will you leave this city before nightfall?
That was rude.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you, anyway?<eos> I met your grandfather.<eos> He wouldn't leave the city until he had your body.<eos> I came down to recover your remains so the Speakers would go to safety.<eos> But the Sleeping Warrior is still down here.<eos> There is no Sleeping Warrior, just a cyclops waiting for people stupid enough to go looking.<eos> It's a trap for gullible Speakers.<eos> You're not popular around here.
You Speakers carry information down through the generations.<eos> We Belmonts pass things down as well.<eos> Do you remember what we saw down there?<eos> Metal veins pumping hot liquid?<eos> Torches that light by themselves that exactly fit descriptions written by my great-grandfather.<eos> Descriptions of the inside of Dracula's castle.<eos> I don't know what's down there, but it's not a messiah.<eos> I'll leave you all to it.<eos> No, no... nonsense.<eos> Please, stay with us for as long as you like.

See if you can find some beer.<eos> I could pee in a bucket and tell him it's beer.<eos> Sypha, he saved your life!<eos> He's rude.<eos> Uh, careful. My knife hand's not too steady. I could slip and take your eye out.<eos> The Bishop of Gresit requests your kind attendance at the church.<eos> I don't think I'm allowed into churches.<eos> The bishop says he'll make an exception in your case.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I realize you're trying to menacingly abduct me, but I'm excommunicated.

I heard all about that.
And I'm here to be disciplined?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Your life, Belmont.<eos> Take it and go.<eos> Tonight, the Speakers will be dealt with, and then Gresit will be secure.<eos> I refuse, however, to toil so hard for the soul of this city with an excommunicant heretic within its walls.<eos> You could undo everything by your very presence.<eos> My God.<eos> You really believe it, don't you?

No offense, but you are just a bishop.<eos> Excommunication came from a little higher up the ladder.<eos> Targoviste is gone.<eos> The other great cities are lost or losing.<eos> Gresit will be the last major city in Wallachia.<eos> To all intents and purposes, I will be the church.<eos> Trevor!<eos> Join us.<eos> Sure.<eos> By the way, you're all going to die.
Join us.<eos> Sure.<eos> By the way, you're all going to die.<eos> What?<eos> The current bishop of this place is...<eos> Well, he's beyond insane.<eos> Over the top and into new lands of just snake-fuckingly crazy, and convinced that the salvation of Gresit lays in you people being torn to pieces by a mob.<eos> When?<eos> Before the sun goes down.<eos> By his logic, you have to die before the night creatures conduct their next raid.
Before the sun goes down.<eos> By his logic, you have to die before the night creatures conduct their next raid.<eos> What happens if we stay and survive?<eos> Well, then the night creatures will come anyway, and the church will blame you, and it'll start all over again.<eos> This feels wrong.<eos> To be driven out for a lie that will doom these people, it is not a Speaker thing.<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> I don't think it's a Belmont thing, either.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You need to leave, and leave now.

Did you have a destination in mind?<eos> Are you calling me a coward? No.<eos> I am calling you defeated, Trevor Belmont.<eos> You fought your battle and you decided you lost.<eos> We didn't have a choice.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But we do.<eos> We carry with us the accumulated wisdom of this great country.<eos> We will use that to fight our battle.<eos> You'll lose.
But, if nothing else, we might show someone that, although battles are won and lost, there is a larger war at stake.<eos> With Dracula's armies?<eos> No.<eos> A war for the soul of our people.<eos> Because if we truly are the sort of people who will kill one another at the behest of a madman's fantasies,<eos> Then perhaps it is right and proper that things from Hell should rise up to wipe us out.<eos> It's time for those of us who fight that war to stand up and be responsible, Trevor Belmont.<eos> You should leave now.<eos> No.<eos> You're leaving right now.

You defend evil.<eos> Give them to us!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're not getting the Speakers.<eos> You're getting no blood today, so shut up.<eos> You will give us the Speakers so that we can save this city.<eos> This city's lost.<eos> It was lost when you and the rest of your scum moved in.

- Witches!<eos> - Witchcraft!<eos> Who's that?<eos> Are the Speakers dead?<eos> No.<eos> Well, get back out there.<eos> The Speakers have to die before the sun goes down.<eos> The sun... is already down.<eos> You cannot enter the house of God.
Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> You had no problem beating an old man this morning.<eos> Huh? You had no problem lying to these people about the Speakers.<eos> The Speakers brought this upon us!<eos> No, they didn't, and you know it.<eos> The Speakers stayed here to offer aid.<eos> It was your bishop who brought all this down on us.<eos> Your bishop who started it all by killing a defenseless woman.<eos> You would have made murderers out of these people, but the only one here who isn't innocent... is you.
Go.<eos> - Sypha?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I want them walled in when they hit the square. I want it so they can only come towards us.<eos> Is that something you can do?<eos> Will ice do?<eos> Better than fire, anyway.<eos> Let's hope so.<eos> I want salt over here!<eos> As much as you can find!
Don't forget... spread the word.<eos> The whip's consecrated... for fighting vampires and demons.<eos> Swords!<eos> There's an army of us!<eos> An army... from hell!<eos> The... catacombs again.<eos> I think we're deeper than I went before.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> I didn't do that.<eos> Why are you here?
These women came to my house because they received invitations.<eos> I have absolutely no idea who sent the invitations, or for what purpose.<eos> Can we please hurry up and name it?<eos> What's the rush?<eos> I have homework.<eos> Would you please put on some clothes?<eos> You still haven't gotten used to it?<eos> I have, but I'm still asking.<eos> What do you think, Shin?<eos> What kind of names did you give your pets when you were kids?
Is that really good for your body?<eos> It's supposed to be.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because it looks painful.<eos> It does?<eos> In fact, it looks like you're hurting yourself.<eos> Just looking at you is painful.<eos> Isn't that going to hurt your neck?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You should all try this too.
Don't you have work?<eos> Why are you lying around?<eos> Because I don't want to work.<eos> Since I have free time, maybe I'll invite Michi on a date.<eos> You know you can't do that, Nanaka.<eos> Why not?<eos> That's not in the rules.<eos> It's okay, isn't it, Cat?<eos> It ran away.<eos> Do you think that cat came here by accident?
Just talk about it.<eos> I'll admit that my novels don't sell well.<eos> But even so, there are still people who enjoy reading them.<eos> Is that the only reason?<eos> Also,<eos> after all, I love novels myself.<eos> I know it sounds daring, but if my books could make someone enjoy novels,<eos> that would make me happy.<eos> I see.<eos> Midori and Yuki, have you read any of Michi's novels?
Please, let us speak with you!<eos> I'm with the Weekly Inquirer .<eos> Is Mr. Michima home?<eos> He's not!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> -When will he be home?<eos> -I am not telling you!<eos> Midori!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> No comment, you motherfuckers!
Come on!<eos> I'm so hungry!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Mr. Michima will come home.<eos> I'm not worried about...<eos> It's just that the rule is that we eat dinner together.<eos> Novel, I'm going to kick your ass.<eos> Hey, are you sure you wanted to come here?<eos> Yes. This is super delicious.<eos> You don't think Shin is with Nanaka, do you?
I still don't know that.<eos> But I don't think the real murderer has achieved his objective.<eos> I won't stand for what he's doing.<eos> Do you think you know who sent the invitations?<eos> Who the hell do you think I am?<eos> I've known for a long time.<eos> Really?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Do we know him?<eos> It's better that you don't know.
There, there.<eos> Cat?<eos> Here.<eos> We took it in because we thought it might be yours.<eos> Yes, it's our cat.<eos> Minami must have protected it.<eos> I guess we won't be eating dinner together anymore.<eos> Everything is gone.<eos> We won't be coming back here.<eos> What are you all going to do now?
No, this isn't about him proposing.<eos> This is about that damn strawberry.<eos> Fine.<eos> Your worst fears are confirmed.<eos> He bought those strawberries for some other girl, and they're getting married.<eos> You should probably live in a ditch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's all I wanted to hear.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, you two.

This is the first time she's not talking.<eos> You are spending a lot of time together.
I-I gotta call Luisa.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's Nick. Leave a message. Hi.<eos> It's Elsa.<eos> Listen, I am calling because every time someone RSVPs to your party, I get an e-mail.<eos> And while I am thrilled to know that you have a friend named Meatball who will be bringing special brownies, I don't need to hear about it.<eos> And what are you doing having a birthday party?<eos> You're a grown man.<eos> Just have five or six of your friends out to dinner, you order a cake.<eos> You don't sing, you don't split the bill, and you call it a day.
Yes, I do.<eos> I don't need you.<eos> Well, good!<eos> That's what I wanted.<eos> Well, good!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Casey, it's Jayson... from Clayton Prep.<eos> I just got your e-mail.<eos> Hi.<eos> You guys are prompt.
Yeah, it's nice to spend time with Casey, 'cause, you know, we're usually so focused on Sam and so...<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on with Sam? He's good.<eos> You want more sangria?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> He doesn't tell me anything anymore.<eos> Right? I have become obsolete.<eos> He's 18.<eos> You know, so...<eos> You know, it's like girls and dating.
-[Lance] Kolivan, any ideas?<eos> -[Kolivan] Open the hatch.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> Think you're pretty good, huh?<eos> Can you handle this?<eos> Didn't think so. Huh?<eos> Hunk, you got a fighter right on your six!<eos> Yeah, and I'm about to teach this sentry a lesson about tailgating.<eos> -[Kolivan] Paladins! Can you hear me?
Lotor has arrived at headquarters at Zarkon's request to take command of the Empire.<eos> Under Zarkon's guidance, of course.<eos> Lotor?<eos> Why is he not at his father's bedside?<eos> Zarkon needs no one by his bedside.<eos> Least of all, you.<eos> [Allura] It is our honor to have you all here together.<eos> I had the biggest bunker back on Puig, but it wasn't nearly this nice.<eos> [voice gurgles] Well, I spent the last decade sleeping in a spiny thistle thicket.<eos> You look wonderful though, Princess.
We're under attack!<eos> To battle stations!<eos> Ezor, find the leader.<eos> Narti, Zethrid, take prisoners. Kill no one.<eos> [grunts]<eos> What's this?<eos> Some sort of communicator?<eos> You weren't trying to call for help, were you?<eos> Prince Lotor would not like that.<eos> -Who--? Who are you?
And now you must answer for what you've done.<eos> Please, spare my people.<eos> Show them mercy.<eos> Mercy has never been the way of the Galra... until now.<eos> How would you like to become a valuable part of the new Empire?<eos> Join us... and you'll never need Voltron again.<eos> Smile!<eos> We're a team now.<eos> I wish Shiro were here to tell us how to go on without him.<eos> Allura, when we came here, you told me I would fly the Green Lion, and I thought there was no way.

Did we ever find out how you did that?<eos> -Can you do that now?
You want the job so badly, you can have it.<eos> Now, now, hang on. I've called the head from the very beginning. What about me?<eos> I picked up on the radio waves that led us to Voltron in the first place.<eos> Hold your gazurgas, everyone!<eos> It's not our decision to make.<eos> -We must allow the lion to decide.<eos> -[Allura] Coran is right.<eos> We must all present ourselves to the Black Lion to see who will bear this glorious burden.<eos> -What?<eos> You, Princess?
But the Black Lion wouldn't choose anybody it didn't feel was worthy to lead Voltron.<eos> I respect its choice.<eos> And you should too.<eos> [Keith] But who's gonna fly the Red Lion?<eos> I want to carry on my father's fight, but I need your help.<eos> Allow me to follow in his footsteps as your paladin.<eos> Please, I must do this.<eos> Others are risking their lives in this fight and I can't continue to-- [crying]<eos> I'm sorry, Princess.<eos> I know how much you wanted to pilot the Red Lion.
A new paladin?<eos> I mean, where would we even start looking?<eos> Well, I vote for getting some alien diversity on the team, and I know some cool mermaids who could be good at it.<eos> -You just want to see them again.<eos> -Yeah, exactly.<eos> -How about those Blade guys?<eos> -Or the Olkari. [static]<eos> Voltron, we need your help.<eos> The Galrans have returned.<eos> Once you left, we were defenseless.
All right, guys, we're not about to let the Galra take back this planet, so follow me.<eos> -Where's Lance?<eos> -What?<eos> [Keith] Lance, where are you?<eos> [groans] My lion's not responding to me.<eos> [Keith] Well, figure it out and catch up with us as soon as you can.<eos> Attention, Paladins of Voltron.<eos> This is Prince Lotor, son of Zarkon,<eos> Emperor Pro Tem of the Galra Empire.<eos> Surrender now, or you will be destroyed.
-[Pidge] Allura?<eos> -[Hunk] Yes! Awesome!<eos> Ooh! Look, there are five kitties now.<eos> What are your orders, sir?<eos> Should we fire on the lions?<eos> No, we've seen enough.<eos> Retreat.<eos> We did it!<eos> I mean, it was a little touch and go there for a second, but, yeah, we made it.<eos> Allura, you and the Blue Lion?
And Shiro.<eos> This belongs to you now.<eos> If I had to lose Blue to someone, I'm glad it was you.<eos> [Coran] Princess!<eos> The Black Lion is leaving the Castle!<eos> -Keith, where are you going?<eos> -I put a tracker on Lotor's ship.<eos> [beeping] [Keith] Tell everyone to get their lions.<eos> We're going after 'em.<eos> You wanted me to lead Voltron?
[grunts] Oh, apologies, Hunk!<eos> Mm, is attacking right now such a good idea?<eos> You know, since not everyone is so great with their lions?<eos> Do you mean me, specifically?<eos> You?<eos> No. No way, I didn't--<eos> I'm just simply pointing out that more than half of the team are in new lions.<eos> Maybe now's not a great time to bite off more than we can chew.<eos> [Lance] You can blame our hot-headed leader for that one.<eos> First, you want me to lead, and then you complain about how I do it.
Good... because we're going in.<eos> The lions will be on us in one varga.<eos> What are your orders?<eos> I say we turn around and start shooting.<eos> We just learned all five lions are operational.<eos> There's still much we don't know.<eos> Keep the cruiser on this heading until my return.<eos> Ready my fighter.<eos> I'm going to attack the lions myself.<eos> You'll never take them all out alone.
[Hunk] So... should we call it quits? Maybe go back, regroup, get a meal?<eos> No!<eos> I know everyone is struggling, but we can't let Lotor slip away.<eos> Acxa, set course for these coordinates.<eos> I'm going to lure the lions there.<eos> Thayserix?<eos> Why?<eos> These are not the paladins who defeated my father.<eos> [Ezor] What?<eos> How do you know?
Perhaps my father did as much damage to their team as they did to him.<eos> Whatever the case, they're vulnerable and we need to take advantage.<eos> [Acxa] Recalibrating your fighter to adjust for the atmospheric changes on Thayserix now.<eos> What?<eos> What happens on Thayserix?<eos> The planet is made of dense gases and has unusual magnetic poles that distort and wreak havoc on normal sensors.<eos> So, once the lions are there, they'll be blind.<eos> -No offense, Narti. -[growls]<eos> Keep the cruiser in orbit around Thayserix.<eos> I'll flush the lions out one by one for you to capture.
We've been led into a trap.<eos> The tables have turned. He's flipped the script.<eos> The hunters have become the hunted.<eos> Hunk, shouting taglines is getting us nowhere!<eos> Lance is right.<eos> Remain calm and get ready.<eos> He's gonna attack again.<eos> Everyone, circle up.<eos> We need to be prepared for anything.<eos> As soon as you see him, fire with everything you've got.
[Hunk] Hey, Pidge. Here's the scenario.<eos> You're stranded on a scary gas planet, and you only have one food to eat for the rest of your life.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> Maybe a burrito?<eos> You like burritos, right?<eos> Mine would be a burrito.<eos> [Allura] Hailing Pidge and Hunk.<eos> Are you paladins looking for an exit?<eos> No way!<eos> You guys found us! [laughs]
You like burritos, right?<eos> Mine would be a burrito.<eos> [Allura] Hailing Pidge and Hunk.<eos> Are you paladins looking for an exit?<eos> No way!<eos> You guys found us! [laughs]<eos> Actually, Allura found you.<eos> She found all of us.<eos> -She was able to connect with her lion.<eos> -[Pidge] Wow! How did you do it?
Do it.<eos> The energy shows no signs of radioactive decay and it's not thermal.<eos> [Hunk] It's not gravitational, our probe is steady on course, and the light is radiating out, not in, like it would in a black hole.<eos> -But out from where?<eos> -That energy signature, I know it.<eos> It's radiating quintessence!<eos> [Hunk] Ooh! That's weird.<eos> Okay, well, let's not go anywhere near there.<eos> We must.<eos> Hold on. Didn't you just see what happened?
We need to go through there.<eos> [Lance] The glowy, explode-y area?<eos> Pidge, keep an eye on Voltron's vitals.<eos> Everyone, be prepared to abort if things get hairy.<eos> Roger that. Ready to abort immediately.<eos> -[rapid beeping] -Guys, my sensors are going crazy.<eos> Technically, we should be torn apart the same way the probe was.<eos> But somehow Voltron is completely unaffected by the stress of the spatial distortion.<eos> Hello?<eos> What are you seeing?
At this rate-- [screaming]<eos> What happened here?<eos> Something deadly.<eos> This still doesn't explain the biorhythms I picked up in this area.<eos> [suspenseful music playing] Look out!<eos> No way!<eos> Shiro?<eos> How...?<eos> [with accent] Stay back!<eos> If you've come for the comet, you'll never get it.
If I were you, I'd run.<eos> -[grunting] What the heck just happened?<eos> Did he say we're being boarded by Alteans?<eos> Put down your weapons!<eos> [gasps] -Alteans!<eos> -It can't be.<eos> Empress!<eos> Uh, I'm confused.<eos> What is going on?<eos> -Are you Empress Allura?
-It can't be.<eos> Empress!<eos> Uh, I'm confused.<eos> What is going on?<eos> -Are you Empress Allura?<eos> -I am Princess Allura.<eos> Please, stand.<eos> I am Commander Hira, Empress.<eos> How can you be here?<eos> You put down the Galra Uprising and established the Altean Empire 10,000 years ago.
Uh, I'm confused.<eos> What is going on?<eos> -Are you Empress Allura?<eos> -I am Princess Allura.<eos> Please, stand.<eos> I am Commander Hira, Empress.<eos> How can you be here?<eos> You put down the Galra Uprising and established the Altean Empire 10,000 years ago.<eos> Where we're from, all the Alteans were wiped out by Zarkon when he destroyed your planet.<eos> Where did you come from?
Entire races who warred for millennia can now know peace and help us to further our new world.<eos> So, they become a part of the Altean peace movement?<eos> You mean, slave labor?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> They're not slaves because they don't have will.<eos> Slaves are always trying to escape or revolt.<eos> The non-cogs are content doing what they're told.<eos> Preservation of life is the Altean Empire's highest priority.<eos> And with this material, we can do even more than we thought possible.<eos> But you're taking away their free will.
Thanks to us, no innocent will lose its life to the free will of an evil being.<eos> Empress Allura, let me show you something.<eos> This is our Altea.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Allow me to show you the magnificence it has achieved.<eos> Is anyone else getting a strange vibe from these guys?<eos> Yeah, there's definitely something off about these Alteans.<eos> I mean, is it me or did they pretty much scramble the big dude's brain?<eos> [Sven] Yoo-hoo! Up here!<eos> [Lance] Whoa! How'd you find us?
[Lance] Wait, stop. Nope. Never mind.<eos> We gotta get to Keith and Allura and figure out a way to stop the Alteans from getting that comet.<eos> Already on it.<eos> We just need to do one more thing and you guys can help. -[weapons whirring] -[gasps]<eos> Perfect!<eos> I had a feeling the Guns of Gamara were on this ship.<eos> But I didn't know Empress Allura's friends would be working with them.<eos> Returning to Altea...<eos> It seemed like such an impossible dream, I could never allow the thought.<eos> Allura, this might not be the Altea you remember.

Finally, our wars can end.<eos> -Allura, we cannot let this happen.<eos> -Hira, please.<eos> We both want the same thing.<eos> Peace.<eos> Do we?<eos> Your weakness has brought nothing but pain and suffering to your people at the hands of the Galra.<eos> We have brought peace and order to ours.<eos> And, with this comet, we will bring our peace to every reality.<eos> You're no empress of mine.
Just get me to Space Hospital.<eos> -They're blocking our way to the lions!<eos> -Everyone, hang on!<eos> Does he do this in every reality?<eos> [Slav] I'll take care of Sven.<eos> You just get to your lions!<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I activated the ship.<eos> They're going to dislodge the comet and have the power to terrorize every reality.<eos> No, you can still get the comet away from them.
Engage thrusters.<eos> Thrusters ready. Huh?<eos> -[Hira] What's happening?<eos> -We've lost thrusters!<eos> We're unable to pursue!<eos> I love this reality!<eos> Take them out!<eos> I found it!<eos> No!<eos> [cheers] You're back!
-[Hira] What's happening?<eos> -We've lost thrusters!<eos> We're unable to pursue!<eos> I love this reality!<eos> Take them out!<eos> I found it!<eos> No!<eos> [cheers] You're back!<eos> Oh, thank the ancients!<eos> Paladins, can you hear me?
I love this reality!<eos> Take them out!<eos> I found it!<eos> No!<eos> [cheers] You're back!<eos> Oh, thank the ancients!<eos> Paladins, can you hear me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you for answering my distress signal, Voltron.<eos> [Coran] Paladins, can you hear me?
I found it!<eos> No!<eos> [cheers] You're back!<eos> Oh, thank the ancients!<eos> Paladins, can you hear me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you for answering my distress signal, Voltron.<eos> [Coran] Paladins, can you hear me?<eos> Coran, we're here.<eos> Allura, you did the right thing.
Well, if you're feeling up to it, the rest of the team would be thrilled to see you up and around again.<eos> They need you, you know.<eos> Yeah, I'll try.<eos> Okay, we'll be on the bridge.<eos> -Hey, Keith?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> How many times are you gonna have to save me before this is over?<eos> As many times as it takes.<eos> Great job out there, everyone.<eos> You've really turned the tide in this war.
This isn't a participation game.<eos> This is war.<eos> And you want your best soldiers on the front lines.<eos> Stop worrying about who flies what and just focus on your missions.<eos> Things will work themselves out.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> And, Lance... leave the math to Pidge.<eos> [humming] Thanks for hooking me into the system.<eos> [mouse squeaking] I would've never been able to reach back there.<eos> -Sorry, I know you got all dirty.
What's wrong?<eos> The Black Lion isn't responding to me.<eos> It looks like you're its true paladin now.<eos> I'm coming down.<eos> [grunts] This may be the worst post in the Galra Empire.<eos> But it's my post!<eos> Victory or death!<eos> The most important thing is for you to get eyes on that comet.<eos> Second is figuring out who we're dealing with.<eos> You!
Team, you cannot let Lotor get that ship.<eos> You need to get back to your lions. You need Voltron!<eos> Why take out one ship when we can stop all of this by taking out Lotor himself?<eos> We can't let him keep outsmarting us.<eos> That's exactly why we can't risk letting Lotor have that ship.<eos> This is too important.<eos> Keith, I want to stop Lotor just as badly as you, but Shiro has a point.<eos> Okay, you guys go back to the lions.<eos> I'm gonna search the ship for Lotor.<eos> Keith, you need to stick together.
I don't know. That's why we have to stop him here and now.<eos> -We have to stop that cargo ship.<eos> -On it.<eos> That must be the ship made from the comet.<eos> Then let's be careful.<eos> Raise particle barrier. Fire Castle defenses.<eos> A quick little bugger, isn't it?<eos> I've never seen something that size move that fast.<eos> That blast cut right through the particle barrier!<eos> Team, where are you?
Why am I tied up?<eos> I say we eat him.<eos> -He doesn't look Galra.<eos> -Does that mean we can't eat him?<eos> -We're not going to eat him.<eos> -I'm not Galra.<eos> Even worse.<eos> He's a traitor.<eos> I'm not a...<eos> You're...

Please stand down!<eos> [yelling] You keep missing him!<eos> Let me shoot!<eos> Give me that! No, it's mine!<eos> Stop right there! I'll shoot!<eos> -You're on the wrong side of this war.<eos> -[groans, gasps] No, I'm not.<eos> I'm on your side.<eos> My name is Shiro, and like I said before, I'm a Paladin of Voltron.<eos> I know that no matter what I say, you won't believe me, so... [both whimpering]

[both whimpering]<eos> I need to get to my team and I need your help.<eos> There's Thayserix.<eos> It's a giant gas planet.<eos> According to the communications we intercepted, Voltron is there. Or was.<eos> I need to get there.<eos> Do you have a ship?
They seem to be evolving.<eos> We don't yet know what powers these ships possess, but we may gain understanding with time.<eos> Time?<eos> Time slips away even as we stand here.<eos> My people will soon be slaughtered by dark creatures from another realm.<eos> Without these ships, all hope is lost.<eos> I understand.<eos> It may take some doing.<eos> These are not regular ships to be chosen at a whim.<eos> You do not pick the beast.

This is Voltron.<eos> -[Trigel] A shield!<eos> -[Zarkon] Well done, Trigel!<eos> -[grunts] It's trying to rip into us!<eos> -We have to get it off!<eos> I know what to do.<eos> [Alfor] We must find a way to seal up this rift.<eos> -Seal the rift? Why?<eos> -It nearly destroyed Daibazaal!<eos> Those creatures nearly destroyed Daibazaal, and you found a way to defeat them.
Why so jumpy?<eos> I know.<eos> I couldn't help myself. These lemon squares look delicious.<eos> They're not for you.<eos> They're for group. All right, okay.<eos> Okay, they look fantastic.<eos> You may see him dip one wing and dance around the female in a circular pattern.<eos> Shit, Casey.<eos> That's a grown-ass man right there.<eos> Are you banging, or are you still in handy land?
Me, too.<eos> I know we're always, um... talking in here about, you know, taking time for ourselves and I did.<eos> I took a dance class.<eos> Silly.<eos> The teacher thought I was really good.<eos> Really silly. But she did say that.<eos> And this is nuts, but afterwards, we all went to a bar, and I met a guy.<eos> I mean, not a guy-guy.<eos> I'm married.<eos> You all know Doug.
Which was a total disaster.<eos> Mm-hmm. Every time we have a moment, I ruin it.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You're doing great, okay?<eos> I have to say that you're a saint for sticking with him, after what he did.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> How's Christopher? I meant to ask you, since he's been mainstreamed.<eos> He's having a regression.<eos> Aw.<eos> Having anger issues. Have you tried music therapy?
Babe, hey, I'm at the bar. Trying to get your credit card.<eos> Can you talk to this guy?<eos> Just talk to her. She'll tell you.<eos> Hello. It's Nick.<eos> There's no one there.<eos> Hello?<eos> So you won't help me out? Sorry.<eos> I really can't.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> Do you know why Evan got kicked out of school?
Sure.<eos> Of course, honey.<eos> We've been getting along lately.<eos> It's what you wanted, right?<eos> Yeah. It's great.<eos> It's really good. Really good.<eos> Um... so I should just...<eos> Go to the bar and get your credit card.<eos> Okay? And, by the time you get back, we'll either be better, or we'll really need your help.<eos> Call if you need me. Nobody needs you, Mom.
Julia, your therapist?<eos> Sam, let's go.<eos> Get out.<eos> Come on, let's go! Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> In the animal kingdom, attraction is a simple biological fact.<eos> We have to go.<eos> It's us humans who make it complicated.<eos> Whoa! This is a nice backyard!<eos> You could put a pool back here.
Never Bethlehem.<eos> What do we tell our frightened little boy?<eos> How do we explain what happened today?<eos> How do we explain God to his own son?<eos> I can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> You're a child that needs a meal and a nap.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Him!<eos> Don't you see him?
I was born in Bethlehem.<eos> Were you, boy?<eos> How old are you?<eos> Too young to talk to strangers.<eos> We live up north. Nazareth.<eos> No boys his age in Bethlehem anyway.<eos> Why not?<eos> Herod took care of that.<eos> Come over here, little one.<eos> You going through Jerusalem?
By the River Jordan, raving over king and taxes and shouting at the Lord.<eos> O Lord of Zion, you shall reign forever as you wash me in your living waters!<eos> Father?<eos> Father?<eos> Oh, Lord, everyone yet to be born will hear me, praise your faithfulness!<eos> Happy am I, brother to the prophesized virgin, uncle to the promised.<eos> Lord Father, let us keep him.<eos> God, I ask this. Is this too much?<eos> Let us keep him, please, for as long as you will.<eos> Did you see that?
Am I dangerous?<eos> No, but others are.<eos> And we need to keep away from them.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Because I can do things nobody else can?<eos> There were angels at the river.<eos> I couldn't see them, but they were there.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> You have to stop asking these questions.<eos> Why won't you tell me?
I hid in the tunnels.<eos> Tunnels?<eos> Under the house.<eos> But he found me.<eos> Bandits.<eos> They're like locusts, destroying everything in their path.<eos> He was taking me to Sepphoris to sell.<eos> I was born in Sepphoris.<eos> It's not far from here, near Nazareth.<eos> You're good Jews. Don't go there.
Keep walking.<eos> Eyes down.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> Eyes down.<eos> Nazareth. Right where we left it.<eos> Mother, are we almost there?<eos> Yes, it's just ahead.<eos> Jews!<eos> Stay where you are.
Not one escaped slave?<eos> We can't go back without someone.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> Take me.<eos> - No! I was saved at the river for this.<eos> If someone must go, it'll be me.<eos> No.<eos> - State my crime.<eos> - It should be me.<eos> You all know why.
No.<eos> - State my crime.<eos> - It should be me.<eos> You all know why.<eos> I like her idea.<eos> My lords!<eos> Quiet! An old lady speaks.<eos> My lords!<eos> I would bow, my lords, but I'm too old for that.<eos> And you are young men.
- Jesus bar Joseph.<eos> He's my son.<eos> Everyone here remembers your betrothal.<eos> There are other things we also remember.<eos> The morning your betrothed, young Mary, came out of the house, crying about an angel, upsetting the village.<eos> Rabbi, is it not for his father to tell him these things in time?<eos> Where was he born?<eos> Bethlehem.<eos> The City of David.<eos> And then you went to Egypt, I understand.
Thanks for talking to me.<eos> Don't make it rain.<eos> I know you can.<eos> I told you not to!<eos> I didn't. I didn't!<eos> Come on!<eos> Father! I found a cave.<eos> Travelers!<eos> We seek a family from Nazareth, with a boy of seven named Jesus bar Joseph.<eos> If you know such a family, and you know this child, then tell us
When I enter your temple, please take my questions that I might receive your answers.<eos> Your will be done.<eos> Well?<eos> - He's gone.<eos> - Gone?<eos> Could someone have taken him?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> We were here.<eos> I could've told you he'd go!<eos> Because you decided to turn back!

God be with you and watch over you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This bird is no good.<eos> I tell you, no good!<eos> The priest won't accept it.<eos> It's flawed.<eos> I don't have any more money.<eos> Please, I need to exchange it.<eos> Come on, get away from here.<eos> How can you cheat me in the Temple in front of God?
He's dead.<eos> I killed him.<eos> You killed him?<eos> I wanted to meet this miracle worker.<eos> The Son of Man, the... The Wonder-Counselor, the Prince of Peace.<eos> The little boy who can make the dead breathe and the blind see.<eos> Why did you kill him, Centurion?<eos> Your orders.<eos> Your orders.<eos> You said it was like... Like Bethlehem.
- Then I'd give it to charity.<eos> Eddie, you are a charity.<eos> Your needs are much greater.<eos> What about you?<eos> Me? I'm just stealing these.<eos> - Any better?<eos> - It's not better.<eos> It's crap.<eos> - It's more difficult than I expected. - Good.<eos> You're a disgrace to the sport.
Find some shelter and hide out.<eos> You ready?<eos> All right, let's go. Stay low.<eos> Ah! Whoa!<eos> Whoa! Down, boy.<eos> Down.<eos> Who you with?<eos> Mississippi 5th, F Company.<eos> We're all that's left.<eos> All right, you're with us now.
Mississippi 5th, F Company.<eos> We're all that's left.<eos> All right, you're with us now.<eos> We're making for that ridge over to the right.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> So fix bayonets!<eos> Fix your bayonet, boy! Yeah, I got it, I got it.<eos> Here.<eos> Fixed!<eos> All right, you ready?
There you go, you feel that?<eos> Feel that?<eos> Okay, how many guns you got in the house, ma'am? Two.<eos> Three with a pistol.<eos> Good, good.<eos> See, now here's the trigger.<eos> You wanna fire it, you just pull this back. Two clicks, pull that trigger.<eos> Boom.<eos> All right, here they come.<eos> You ready?
And the men that go along with them.<eos> How many men?<eos> You ready?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> You ready?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> All right, everybody in half cock? Eli?<eos> Malachi?<eos> Now you ain't gonna have a chance to reload, so make your shot count.
Did you get him?<eos> Get him again.<eos> Jasper, it's all right. Come on out now.<eos> You ain't the only one.<eos> Will?<eos> Whoa.<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> That stuff don't belong to you.<eos> Unhitch that wagon and head off down the road.<eos> Who are you?
"Light, right." "Light, right."<eos> "All right, slight."<eos> """All right, slight."<eos> Uh, but it's a "G-H" and it's silent when you use the "H."<eos> What a man grows with his own two hands oughta belong to him, yeah?<eos> Yes, sir. How's that scripture go, Jasper?<eos> This here's from the Book of Galatians.<eos> "Be not deceived.<eos> "God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, "that shall he also reap."<eos> What you sow, you should reap.

Only in there.<eos> Why, hell, I'll stomp it out with you.<eos> Get a box up here.<eos> Come on, throw a box up on here.<eos> Put those stakes right down here, boys. Right here, right here.<eos> There we go!<eos> Get you a handkerchief.<eos> I got plenty for everybody, now.<eos> That fat, now that's where all the flavor is, right there in that fat.<eos> Look right here. It's fallin' right off the bone. You don't even need those knives.
Is that Yankee currency?<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Take that back to her.<eos> Yeah, why would you trust someone who just burned your farm, son?<eos> I'm not sayin' I trust 'em.<eos> I'm just sayin'...<eos> That you want it to stop?<eos> Yeah, so do I.<eos> Thomas, I don't think that turning' ourselves in is gonna stop 'em.<eos> I know you lost your farm, and I know your mama's hurtin', all right?
It's why they're rich, Ward.<eos> Don't ya understand?<eos> You, me, all of us...<eos> We're all out there dyin' so they can stay rich.<eos> You own any slaves, Ward?<eos> You got any Negroes to fight for?<eos> No, but it sure looks like you do.<eos> That's fine, Ward.<eos> You leave any time you want.<eos> Save your farms. All you got to do is lay down your arms.

Very good.<eos> The second row, C-O-B is...<eos> "Cob. "Job. "Mob.<eos> Chester.<eos> I need some bailin' wire.<eos> That's a cent a foot.<eos> I'll take 60 feet.<eos> Fixin' a fence?<eos> Yeah. That's what bailin' wire's for.<eos> You up in Soso, right? Mmm-hmm.
Got nowhere to go.<eos> They said you was up here now, makin' a new farm.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I'm sorry. I just don't know where to go.<eos> Rebs burned my first farm. Sherman burned my second.<eos> Guess they agree on that.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> We walked all the way from Birmingham.<eos> He's seen things nobody should see.<eos> You stay here.

No.<eos> That's fine.<eos> You stay here with us.
There, darlin', it's all right.<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You got him to stop.<eos> Well, men just want to be listened to, right?<eos> Especially these men.<eos> Gettin' chilly.<eos> Hmm.<eos> It is. Yeah.<eos> You ain't got to fill it out now.

I heard one earlier.<eos> Above my room.<eos> If you had heard a car, the driver would be long dead by now.<eos> Well, shouldn't we at least try to call the police or someone to find out what actually happened?<eos> There's no one left to call.<eos> See that?<eos> Nothing's coming through.<eos> You think I sound crazy.<eos> I mean, it's amazing.<eos> You people...

Above us.<eos> You heard someone?<eos> Right above us.<eos> That isn't possible.<eos> - The air is...<eos> - What, contaminated?<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - Because I told him.<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> I see you two are getting along.
I need your help with something.<eos> Sure.<eos> You.<eos> On deck.<eos> What is this?<eos> The barrel.<eos> What's in it?<eos> Move it into the bathroom.<eos> This is perchloric acid.<eos> Do either of you know what that is?
It's usually produced as a precursor to ammonium perchlorate, a fuel used for launching naval satellites into orbit.<eos> It's highly corrosive.<eos> Dissolves most biological material on contact.<eos> With humans, right down to the bone.<eos> Hey, Howard, what are you showing this to us for?<eos> You think I'm an idiot?<eos> Howard, please, you're gonna have to tell us what it is that you're talking about.<eos> I'm talking about getting rid of some waste.<eos> Tell me what you two were doing with these.<eos> You tell me what you two were planning, right now!
I'm talking about getting rid of some waste.<eos> Tell me what you two were doing with these.<eos> You tell me what you two were planning, right now!<eos> Howard, listen, just take it easy. Take it easy.<eos> Howard, come on, please.<eos> No.<eos> I'm giving you one chance.<eos> Hey.<eos> Howard, just calm down.<eos> One chance to answer with some dignity, or I swear to God, you're going into this barrel while you're alive to feel it.
I can't work in your butcher shop.<eos> I'm fusing transected spinal cords.<eos> I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.<eos> The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.<eos> In er, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> In er, we're only saving lives.<eos> There's no fame, there's no CNN interviews.<eos> I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.<eos> Wait a minute. You're not... You guys aren't...
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.<eos> Multiple torn ligaments...<eos> Severe nerve damage in both hands.<eos> You were on the table for 11 hours.<eos> Look at these fixators.<eos> No one could have done better.<eos> I could have done better.<eos> No.<eos> Give your body time to heal.<eos> You've ruined me.
Teach me.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Please!<eos> Thank you, masters.<eos> You think I was wrong to cast him out?
You think I was wrong to cast him out?<eos> 5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.<eos> There's a strength to him.<eos> Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.<eos> I've seen it all before.<eos> He reminds you of Kaecilius?<eos> I cannot lead another gifted student to power... Only to lose him to the darkness.<eos> You didn't lose me.<eos> I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.<eos> You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law.
Maiming, perhaps?<eos> People used to think that I was funny.<eos> Did they work for you?<eos> All right. It's been lovely talking to you.<eos> Thank you for the books... And for the horrifying story... And for the threat upon my life.<eos> We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us.<eos> The one who betrays the world.<eos> Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.<eos> They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.<eos> All you need to do is focus.
Their connection to the dark dimension makes them more powerful in the mirror dimension.<eos> They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.<eos> This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!<eos> That is hilarious.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> It's true.<eos> She does draw power from the dark dimension.<eos> Kaecilius.<eos> I came to you broken... Lost, in need.<eos> Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

Lost, in need.<eos> Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.<eos> I tried to protect you.<eos> From the truth?<eos> From yourself.<eos> I have a new teacher now.<eos> Dormammu deceives you.<eos> You have no idea what he truly is.
A harder way.<eos> A weirder way.<eos> Doctor Palmer to the er, please. Doctor Palmer to the er.<eos> I don't want you to go.<eos> Stop!<eos> Choose your weapon wisely.<eos> No one steps foot in this sanctum.<eos> No one.<eos> Kaecilius.<eos> You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.
Percy!<eos> Look at him with his horse.<eos> Wave to your father.<eos> Gentlemen! Today, I will be delivered to the Archduke Ferdinand at the gala.<eos> I expect you to behave with distinction on this hunt.<eos> Good luck... and Godspeed.<eos> Could they not fit you a rocking chair on that horse, grandad?<eos> You'll all be my gun bearers by evening. I've no doubt of that.
What's next? You gonna give me a wedgie?<eos> No. I think both of us pretty much feel you have enough stuck up your butt.<eos> Burn!<eos> Okay, you know what, I thought we could have an adult conversation, but apparently we can't.<eos> Erin, if you don't believe in this stuff anymore, then why were you looking for the book?<eos> A man came to see me at my work saying his building was haunted.<eos> What building?<eos> The Aldridge Mansion.<eos> It's obviously a joke.<eos> What are you doing?

Holtzmann, check this out.<eos> Hold your ponies.<eos> All right.<eos> Good gag.<eos> Hey, are you getting that?<eos> Very funny.<eos> Is everything a joke to you guys?<eos> Just your mama.<eos> No, actually, I think the world of your mom.<eos> You guys put all that gooey stuff on the floor.

You tried to freak me out.
That's...<eos> - Guys?<eos> I don't think we're alone.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Let me have the camera.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> How can you be eating right now?<eos> Once you pop...<eos> Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
He's looking at that chart.<eos> Couldn't figure that out, either.<eos> Call me when you figure that out.<eos> Haven't been able to.<eos> Samantha.<eos> Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Sixty. Seventy.<eos> Sometimes, I like to put all my stuff from my office in a box and just do some exercises and just use it as weights. Eighty.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy.

You know, fun fact about this place, that this building is built in the same place as the first Chinese gambling den in New York.<eos> I mean, it's, like, coincidence.<eos> Also, I got chased by a ghost.<eos> What?<eos> You know, up above us was the old New York prison.<eos> It's the first place in New York that they electrocuted people.<eos> I'm telling you, it used to take so long that they'd just be like, "Shoot him.<eos> We using too much electricity."<eos> That's why I knew something weird was going on down here, man.<eos> Did you see that?

How is that...<eos> Holtzmann?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> - Come here.<eos> I need your snoot on this.<eos> Am I nuts?<eos> 'Ey, 'ey, ladies.<eos> While y'all over there making out with that dirty piece of garbage, we only got a couple of minutes.<eos> Do you see that?
Just gonna plug these things in here.<eos> - Okay, Erin, come here.<eos> - Let me document this.<eos> - Grab it, grab it.<eos> - Wait.<eos> That's gonna shoot a proton stream at that ghost, okay?<eos> So whenever I say, "Go," you just do that.<eos> Why am I operating the untested nuclear laser?<eos> You have the longest arms.<eos> You guys might want to hurry up.
You have the longest arms.<eos> You guys might want to hurry up.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I forgot the most important part.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Erin, this is just a little bit of grounding so you don't die immediately.<eos> Do you know your iron level?<eos> It's fine.<eos> You have done this before, right?
Come on, move!<eos> - Hurry!<eos> - That's the express train!<eos> And it's not stopping!<eos> It's coming!<eos> Get her up!<eos> Not the collar!<eos> Well, I guess he going to Queens.<eos> He's gonna be the third scariest thing on that train.<eos> God, did you see that?
- Here is your coffee, Abby.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Did you get sugar in it this time?<eos> I hate coffee.<eos> - Yeah, the sugar's in there.<eos> - Sugar's in it.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Don't want to waste a cup of coffee.<eos> Can we just pretend that didn't happen, please?<eos> All right, well, what do you think?
And they used a chromium alloy for the hull.<eos> I would've used aluminum, but I'm crazy.<eos> What's that weird thing that guy said to the lady from the subway?<eos> I know what you're talking about.<eos> Fourth Cataclysm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Fourth Cataclysm.<eos> Man, what they gonna do, make a fifth one, starring The Rock?<eos> Yeah, you guys, you have a visitor.
I'm in a hide-and-seek tournament, and we are in the semis.<eos> Kevin, I'm gonna need you to pick up all those suitcases.<eos> Did you hurt your face?<eos> Hey, did y'all hire that big dumb dude?<eos> Bye!<eos> Man, I got a cousin Mookie.<eos> He is half as stupid, and he will work for Vienna sausages.<eos> The thing is, this isn't really a club. It's a scientific research group.<eos> And I understand that, but let me tell you something.<eos> I read a lot of nonfiction, and you guys know a lot about this science stuff, but I know New York.

Protect the barrier! Protect the barrier! Protect the barrier!<eos> Or mankind will end.<eos> That was really good.<eos> - That was really good.<eos> - We actually...<eos> - That was...<eos> I'm a little proud of us.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Rhythmic clapping.<eos> I'm so goddamn happy you two are back together.
Who are you?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> You didn't tell me about a book that you wrote, and now everyone's saying you're some sort of crazy ghost hunter.<eos> Okay, well, first of all, that's wrong.<eos> We don't hunt ghosts.<eos> We stalk them.<eos> And we are very close to trapping one soon.<eos> And then we will study it and do reports on it.<eos> Yeah, he probably dances real sexy.<eos> You know what I'm saying, like, just a wind...
Please, follow me.<eos> Right away.<eos> Please, all of you.<eos> Fernando was down here when something crawled out of a wall vent, and...<eos> I heard him screaming, so I went to check, and that's when the "thing" was tossing Fernando all around the room.<eos> I thought it was gonna kill him.<eos> I shrieked when I saw it. I...<eos> I guess I scared it, because I'm told that I have a very disturbing scream.<eos> I could see that.<eos> Anyway, if you could just mosey around, you'll probably bump into it.

- Go, go.<eos> This auditorium is Art Deco, you idiots!<eos> Aim for the ghost!<eos> Hey, Patty, you take that aisle.<eos> I'll take the far one.<eos> Okay, I need y'all to get out the way!<eos> We need to get up those aisles!<eos> All right, move, people!<eos> I need to get down that aisle!<eos> If you're not gonna move, you're gonna become part of this operation!

Move me left!<eos> Watch the rings. Watch the rings.<eos> Okay, you sweaty freaks.
- Yep.<eos> - ... legit feels like.<eos> - Right here.<eos> This.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have to stop kissing this.<eos> That... It just makes me feel so warm and tingly inside.<eos> That's probably the radiation.<eos> Hey, guys, I got some pretty cool stuff cooking up over here, if you want to just turn your head.
It's basically, like, we're both using the same science.<eos> - That is strange.<eos> - I think I know why.<eos> Look what Mr. Cuckoo Pants has been reading at the beach.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told you that there would be people out there that loved our work.<eos> Why am I so flattered that that weird little sociopath bought our book?<eos> Thank you for everything you did.<eos> You saved us all.
No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told you that there would be people out there that loved our work.<eos> Why am I so flattered that that weird little sociopath bought our book?<eos> Thank you for everything you did.<eos> You saved us all.<eos> The mayor thanks you, of course.<eos> Privately, so don't tell anyone.<eos> Can I walk you out?<eos> Well, why don't you all go get some rest?
Can I walk you out?<eos> Well, why don't you all go get some rest?<eos> These gentlemen here will get you out of here. Okay?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thanks for all you've done, ladies.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> I just have to say a couple things to the press.<eos> You know how that goes.
We gotta get something to eat. We gotta find that Basset Hound.<eos> I'll just see you guys tomorrow.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Erin...<eos> - I'm sorry!<eos> So, Abby, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and congratulations, I've decided to become a Ghostbuster.<eos> Oh, God. I don't have time to try to explain why that's not going to happen.<eos> I thought they would've been happy about that.<eos> Did you guys lose your keys?
Do it in the right place, with enough power, and there goes the barrier.<eos> And then the world shall bend to...<eos> Okay.<eos> I apologize.<eos> That looks nastier than I intended.<eos> Enjoy, Abby!<eos> Ghostbusters.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Hello?<eos> Guys, it's me. Are you there?
Okay.<eos> I apologize.<eos> That looks nastier than I intended.<eos> Enjoy, Abby!<eos> Ghostbusters.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Hello?<eos> Guys, it's me. Are you there?<eos> Please pick up if you're there.<eos> Call me as soon as you get this.
Got you, Holtzy!<eos> No!<eos> Get out of my friend, ghost!<eos> That's gonna leave a mark!<eos> The power of Patty compels you!<eos> Is that you, Abby?<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Hey, guys, check it out!<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I figured you're gonna need my help, so I borrowed all this stuff.

Women.<eos> Always late.<eos> Probably couldn't decide which dirty jumpsuit to wear.<eos> Let's give 'em a proper New York welcome, shall we?<eos> Welcome to the glory days of New York City.<eos> Have fun!<eos> Never been good in a fight.<eos> Well, good news.<eos> Here's your chance to work on that.<eos> Guys, you all have your sidearms.

They're in my hand!<eos> A little help!<eos> Impressive.<eos> Holtzy!<eos> I got you!<eos> It's chipping time now, ghost.<eos> And this is what you get for sitting on me!<eos> Missed me!<eos> Thanks, Patty.<eos> Not you guys again!
It's chipping time now, ghost.<eos> And this is what you get for sitting on me!<eos> Missed me!<eos> Thanks, Patty.<eos> Not you guys again!<eos> Say hello to my little...<eos> What the hell?<eos> Forgot about my new toys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You just got Holtzmanned, baby!
God.<eos> It feels like the slime is after me, personally.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> This might be a crazy hunch, but I think he's got that machine up and running again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Damn, I missed.<eos> Kevin!<eos> Is that what this thing's name is?<eos> Thought it'd be something more Australian like "Jack-O" or "Dave-O" or "Rob-O."<eos> I see there's five of you now.
I got his ass!<eos> Here I am.<eos> Nobody hurts Kevin, man!<eos> Nobody hurts Kevin!<eos> Come out, come out wherever you are<eos> Over here.<eos> Those guns come with instructions?<eos> Come on, Rowan!<eos> Come get your virginity out of the lost-and-found!<eos> - You shoot like girls.
What's he made out of?<eos> Pure muscle.<eos> And baby-soft skin.<eos> Come on, Rowan, show yourself!<eos> What form would you prefer I take?<eos> Maybe something stationary.<eos> Like a bull's-eye.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.<eos> I prefer something nice and cute, like a friendly little ghost.<eos> Is this what you want?
Maybe something stationary.<eos> Like a bull's-eye.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.<eos> I prefer something nice and cute, like a friendly little ghost.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Something more familiar?<eos> Ice cream.<eos> Well, you know what, I don't have no problem with that.<eos> Thank you very much for being reasonable.<eos> If this is what you want, it works for me.
My gosh.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God!<eos> My gosh!<eos> What year is it?<eos> - It's 2040.<eos> - What?<eos> - Our president is a plant.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> You were gone two seconds.
Point is, the Ghostbusters...<eos> Are back together again, okay?<eos> And that's what friends are for.<eos> - Just glad you okay, man.<eos> - Kevin!<eos> Yes.<eos> Hold my hand longer.<eos> Okay. Okay. Okay.<eos> I love the hair, by the way.<eos> Makes you look a lot older.
Mine was "Woman with a Secret."<eos> And she was kind of going...<eos> And she appeared to be in a canoe.<eos> You know what, I want to make a toast.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Physics is the study of the movement of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it cannot answer the essential question of what is our purpose here.<eos> And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.<eos> And to love is what you have shown me.
You know what?<eos> We should probably let them just work this out.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Patty, I got four funerals this weekend.<eos> I can't do them with just one hearse.<eos> Maybe you could do two at a time.<eos> We're not stacking 'em like flapjacks!<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I know what you did.
Don't let any man tell you otherwise.<eos> - Okay, you can go.<eos> - All right.<eos> - We still good for brunch?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Just go.<eos> Ghostbusters.<eos> Please give a detailed description of your apparition.<eos> Well, that sounds like an illusional meta-physious, spectro-mian.<eos> I'm talking like you guys.
They're all Jewish.<eos> I'm really excited to be here. This was actually one of my top choices.<eos> That closet there, is really good for making personal calls.<eos> But whatever you do, do not hook up in this copy room.<eos> One, it's just, like, so cliché. And two, there's a security camera.<eos> Oh, I'm not really hooking up with anybody right now because recently, I actually...<eos> Yeah, I know what you're thinking.<eos> They do record the footage.<eos> So, unless a leaked sex tape is part of your two-year plan, I'd recommend hooking up in the...<eos> You'll never know our secrets.
That was a trick.<eos> You don't buy the drinks. Boys buy the drinks.<eos> It's kind of like a sexual currency that they use, so they're not actually paying you to hook up.<eos> So, go get us a drink.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Not... Not with this wallet.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - With the sausage wallet.<eos> Which of you is buying oil right now?<eos> Do you know how much...
Watch this.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Hey. - Hi.<eos> Hey, uh, you know we're only sleeping together for fun, right?<eos> Because I'm not interested in long-term relationships, so I think I'm gonna start seeing other people and I think you should move on, too.<eos> Because I care about you, and I don't want to see you get hurt.<eos> Oh, I care about you, too.<eos> Yeah. Hmm.<eos> Wow.<eos> You guys are super dressed-up.
I once slept with an albino.<eos> Anyway, the good news is, now there are... 3,000 beautiful babies in the world and no one can take that away<eos> Why don't you go to one of those alumni events?<eos> An alumni event?<eos> You go, and you network with people and if you really love what you do then the whole guy thing is easier.<eos> No! I don't want to be like you, Meg.<eos> I don't want my job to be my entire life.<eos> Ooh. Okay.<eos> Sisters, time-out.<eos> There are pros and cons to both of you, okay?
So, are you married?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Dating anyone?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> Are you divorced?<eos> No, no one's ever loved me enough to eventually divorce me.<eos> You got to get in the game, before you can lose, so... I'm not even a good loser, yet.<eos> Oh, my God, are those penis straws?<eos> You guys are gonna have a crazy night tonight!
Well, then, we're gonna have to start going to a different bar, girlfriend.<eos> No, you'll be fine, just don't hit your drink number with him.<eos> What's my drink number?<eos> In every male-female friendship, there's a total number of drinks and if you hit that, it means you will definitely have sex.<eos> So, how many drinks does it take to get you wasted?<eos> Two and a half<eos> - but maybe three, if I've eaten.<eos> - Three.<eos> Okay, and Tom's is eight.<eos> So, you can't hit eleven drinks between the two of you.
Okay, 30 more seconds.<eos> Twenty-seven.<eos> It said three to 10 minutes, is that right?<eos> I'm doing this in solidarity.<eos> Guys.<eos> Mine's positive.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm taking a drug test. Is that what you guys are doing?
Oh, thank you.<eos> - For you.<eos> - I'll take that.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - That's Robin's.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I like to keep this on my own rack.<eos> Sorry, we're late.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'm glad you guys could come.
I think the novelty of this whole thing will have worn off and I think, the reality will set in, which is that I work all the time and I probably would never see you, and I'd probably have to cancel all of our dates.<eos> And, when I did finally see you, I would probably just fall asleep on your face.<eos> - Oh... - Yeah, and then, you would go off, and meet some girl at the gym.<eos> Because you obviously have a lot of time to spend at the gym and so would she, and I don't even know why we're having this conversation.<eos> I mean, you are obviously not a real thing and I feel like we're wasting air even talking about it.<eos> And I have hip problems, real hip problems. And not from doing fun things, like having sex, but from gravity.<eos> And what we had was great.<eos> Thank you for helping me out with that.<eos> That was fun.<eos> But you will find a girl your own age and then you can do fun things like look for trees and whatever.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> No... Nothing.<eos> Makes total sense.<eos> Wait, how do you know Alice?<eos> How do you guys know Alice?<eos> Oh, fuck me.<eos> This is Josh.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> What?<eos> Are you guys new friends, or...
I say let's just let that continue.<eos> Now, you drive careful.<eos> Right.<eos> So, Tijuana. Any sod-eyed muppet with a bloody backpack and a pair of frickin' Birkenstocks is gonna go on about that donkey show, man.<eos> Listen, listen, boys.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen... listen to me now...<eos> it's downright naughty.<eos> Whoo! We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave. You don't know what I'm talkin' about.
Where's that giggle gun?<eos> I'm starting to feel me toes again here.<eos> Isn't that funny there?<eos> I really thought that T.J. was south of Vegas.<eos> So, I might be wonderin' why we're headin' toward the sun there, boy.<eos> Yeah, but what do I know?<eos> I'm just another shit-faced Irishman, am I not?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Aah!<eos> How did you wankers find me, then?
Mm-hmm.<eos> Coming to kill you?<eos> Whoo! Your daddy makes some heckified corn shine.<eos> Don't you want to call the police, then?<eos> Afraid the police won't be much help here.<eos> Well, what about your boyfriend or someone?<eos> Get him to come help. A girl doesn't always need some stupid guy helping her.<eos> That's right. A woman needs to know how to be strong and stand on her own.<eos> Thanks for these, guys.<eos> Of course, boy or girl, if you're lucky enough to fall in love, you have to be even stronger.
We're at war.<eos> I don't know how they keep finding me!<eos> It's... I'm getting...<eos> I had to jump out of a plane 30,000 feet.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meantime, stay out of trouble.<eos> Get rid of your credit cards, hold up, and lay low.<eos> Oh, I'm layin' low, all right.<eos> Now, listen, I need you to wire me some...<eos> Oh, come on. You... The moral of this sad-ass story is don't believe what you hear.
- Got his hand in everything.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Emir Abreu.<eos> - Hey, man. - What's up, my man?<eos> I've set up phone lines on the switchboard.<eos> - So, how did you two meet again?<eos> - The IRS.<eos> IRS.<eos> You two must have got all the pussy.

Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Please, let me make it up to you.<eos> We are going to have a fantastic evening.<eos> - I promise you that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Bobby, come here.<eos> - You look fucking great, man.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> My financial structure is already in place.<eos> So, you invest with me and a portion of your money stays put while the majority of your cash gets filtered through my businesses so that you are able to do with it what you please.
My financial structure is already in place.<eos> So, you invest with me and a portion of your money stays put while the majority of your cash gets filtered through my businesses so that you are able to do with it what you please.<eos> We don't park cash.<eos> That isn't the way we do business.<eos> Mr. Mora, with all due respect, it's the way I do business.<eos> Now, I've checked your transactions.<eos> Large sums to companies like Southern Air Transport, that raises the Feds' antennae.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It looks like one big money laundering machine.<eos> And that's not what you want.
Robert Musella.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> The pleasure's mine.<eos> And you are?<eos> She's with me.<eos> - She's with him?<eos> She's with him.<eos> - She's with him, yeah.<eos> How about that, huh?<eos> Hey, I don't know if you know this,
- Yeah.<eos> - He's our family, you know...<eos> - Fuck that!<eos> There's no deal.<eos> - Okay, no deal.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - I'm out.<eos> No deal. Sorry.<eos> - He'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
- Uh...<eos> Yogurt.<eos> - No. I love yogurt.<eos> - I thought you said you hated yogurt?<eos> - I hate sour cream.<eos> - And mayonnaise.<eos> - Sour cream and mayonnaise.<eos> Noted.<eos> Perfect.<eos> You already sound like a married couple.
Perfect.<eos> You already sound like a married couple.<eos> - All right, favorite sport?<eos> - Uh, she loves tennis.<eos> Football.<eos> The Bucs.<eos> Season tickets on the 20-yard line.<eos> Damn, woman, you're good.<eos> Look at that memory.<eos> All right, how'd you meet?
We were friends.<eos> I was trying to fix him up with a friend of mine, he was trying to do the same.<eos> And then love struck and we were thinking, "What are we doing?"<eos> And we cut out the middleman.<eos> Wait, that's how you met your wife, isn't it?<eos> It is.<eos> Stay close to the truth, makes it easier to lie.<eos> - Strangest sexual position? - Hmm.<eos> What?<eos> All right, I'll let you slide on that.
- No, no, I went on my own.<eos> Jesus, Bob, you sprung me out of jail to watch your back, and now look at you, you're waist-deep.<eos> - You having fun without me?<eos> - No.<eos> Now, listen to me, they're fucking meeting tonight.<eos> - It never happened, do you hear me?<eos> - Okay, it never happened.<eos> Bobby, say it like you mean it.<eos> I mean, that it never happened.<eos> Do you think that I'm doing a good job for you?
- You having fun without me?<eos> - No.<eos> Now, listen to me, they're fucking meeting tonight.<eos> - It never happened, do you hear me?<eos> - Okay, it never happened.<eos> Bobby, say it like you mean it.<eos> I mean, that it never happened.<eos> Do you think that I'm doing a good job for you?<eos> Excellent.<eos> Then why don't you do right for me?

- So, what is it like?<eos> You pay me or I rat.<eos> I'll fucking tell them you're a piece of shit...<eos> I can't believe that Bob warned me about you, you know that?<eos> I should've listened to him.<eos> I'm such a fucking idiot, the fucking...<eos> You shut your fucking mouth.<eos> You fuck this up and I swear to God...<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> You two coming in or what?
Yeah, well, run, get me a cup of coffee.<eos> Yeah, I got your creamer right here.<eos> Hey, other than when Junior was born, this is one of the best days of my life.<eos> This is my brother-in-law, Steve.<eos> This is Gonzalo.<eos> Nice to meet you, Gonzalo.<eos> - See you on the other side.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Do you think I'm gonna get fucked later?
Speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Here we go. Here we go.<eos> These guys first!<eos> They're right here! Get them!<eos> Bob! Get down!<eos> Get Down!<eos> You traitors!<eos> You will fucking regret this!<eos> You hear me!<eos> You'll live to regret this!
These guys first!<eos> They're right here! Get them!<eos> Bob! Get down!<eos> Get Down!<eos> You traitors!<eos> You will fucking regret this!<eos> You hear me!<eos> You'll live to regret this!<eos> Take them away.<eos> You will regret this.
You have a visitor.<eos> You clean up pretty good yourself.<eos> You went shopping.<eos> I went shoplifting.<eos> Evening.<eos> What can I get for you?<eos> I'll have a Manhattan, please.<eos> - Whiskey, rocks.<eos> - Coming up.<eos> You two look fine this evening.
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.<eos> For your own safety, please return to your cabins.<eos> Should've took the damn pills.<eos> - I'll go get them.<eos> - No.<eos> Stay here with me.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You two take care of each other.<eos> My ID.<eos> Get you where you need to go.
What's that?<eos> Something I've wanted to give you for a long time.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Took you long enough to ask.<eos> Champagne.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Hell of a life.<eos> Hell of a life.<eos> Crew wake-up process initiated.<eos> My fellow passengers, if you're reading this, then the Starship Avalon has reached its destination.

Open that gate.<eos> GRIGGS:<eos> Yo, ese.<eos> Hola, amigo.<eos> Put that burrito down. You got visitors, man.<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)<eos> (PEOPLE SCREAMING)<eos> (LAUGHING)<eos> What's up?<eos> Hey, you want some of this?
- He's out.<eos> Third, y'all gonna pay for my daughter's whole education.<eos> Best schools.<eos> And then I want her to go to college.<eos> Like Harvard.<eos> Or Yale.<eos> - So Ivy League.<eos> - Ivy League, yeah.<eos> - One of them big joints, you know? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And, uh, if she can't cut it and her grades start slipping, I need you to white-people that thing.
(GROWLING)<eos> Is that the new guy?<eos> (HARLEY LAUGHING MANIACALLY)<eos> What is that?<eos> What is that? Who are you?<eos> - MAN 1:<eos> Stand by.<eos> Arming device.<eos> - HARLEY:<eos> Who are you?
- (GRUNTS)<eos> - Ooh.<eos> Straighten up.<eos> She had a mouth.<eos> - (LAUGHS)<eos> - RICK:<eos> Listen up!<eos> In your necks, injection you got, it's a nanite explosive.<eos> It's the size of a rice grain, but it's powerful as a hand grenade.<eos> You disobey me, you die.

Behold the voice of God.<eos> (BEEPS)<eos> For those of you who don't know me officially, my name is Amanda Waller.<eos> There's an active terrorist event in Midway City.<eos> I want you to enter the city, rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh... For those of us who don't speak good guy, what is HVT-1?<eos> The only person that matters in the city, the one person you can't kill.<eos> Complete the mission, you get time off your prison sentence.<eos> Fail the mission, you die.
Flag, get out of there.<eos> We're not here to fight them.<eos> We know that doesn't work.<eos> RICK:<eos> Copy that.<eos> We're diverting.<eos> Bump out second squad two blocks east.<eos> We'll pass through you, continue north.<eos> SOLDIER 1: (WHISPERING) Take Bravo two blocks east.<eos> We'll leapfrog through you once you're in position.
I need you to play nice with the other children.<eos> And quietly return to my cage.<eos> Sure, okay.<eos> Hey, that's okay, sellout. I get it. I get it.<eos> I know how the world works, okay?<eos> And when it comes to the heart, everyone for themselves, right?<eos> Waller?<eos> We're about to enter the building.<eos> Get that chopper ready.<eos> What do you say we get this over with?
Yeah, let's go home.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> You guys wanna go home?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Or you wanna go back to prison?<eos> I'm not going back to prison.<eos> What I'm saying is we kill the pair of 'em now before they kill us.<eos> (SWORD SWISHING)<eos> I got this.<eos> You all made it this far.
(CREATURES SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)<eos> Waller's down.<eos> It's over.<eos> Ops just confirmed.<eos> She's down. 1k west.<eos> Let's go get her.<eos> The mission's not over.<eos> Nah. It is for me.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Without Waller, you got nothing.
You just press the button and drop it.<eos> (ENCHANTRESS LAUGHS)<eos> Needless to say, the whole thing was a bad idea.<eos> She bolted!<eos> Shit!<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)<eos> (GASPS)<eos> And that's how she escaped from Waller.<eos> So now you know.
Yeah.<eos> I never been with a witch before.<eos> What's that like?<eos> Apparently, that's why the creatures chase him all the time.<eos> 'Cause, uh, the witch is scared of him.<eos> The only woman I ever cared about is trapped inside that monster.<eos> If I don't stop the witch, it's over.<eos> Everything is over.<eos> Everything.<eos> You're free to go.
You know, we should get a drink sometime.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> I've been waiting for you all night.<eos> Step out of the shadows.<eos> I won't bite.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Grab her.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> Why are you here?
Step out of the shadows.<eos> I won't bite.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Grab her.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because the soldier led you?<eos> And all for Waller.<eos> Why do you serve those who cage you?
Hmm.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Grab her.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because the soldier led you?<eos> And all for Waller.<eos> Why do you serve those who cage you?<eos> I am your ally.<eos> And I know what you want.

- No!<eos> Everybody, down!<eos> (SPEAKS SPANISH)<eos> (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)<eos> (EXHALES SHARPLY)<eos> (BREATHING SHAKILY)<eos> You next.<eos> ENCHANTRESS:<eos> My spell is complete.<eos> Once you and your armies are gone, my darkness will spread across this world.
Please.<eos> House blowing up builds character.<eos> You ate breakfast, yes?<eos> Breakfast is most important meal of day.<eos> Here, protein bar.<eos> Good for bones.<eos> Deadpool may try to break yours.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Wait!<eos> You may be wondering, "Why the red suit?"
Good for bones.<eos> Deadpool may try to break yours.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Wait!<eos> You may be wondering, "Why the red suit?"<eos> Well, that's so bad guys can't see me bleed.<eos> This guy's got the right idea.<eos> He wore the brown pants.<eos> Fine!<eos> I only have 12 bullets... so you're gonna have to share!
Where else do you put one out?<eos> I was molested.<eos> Me too.<eos> Uncle.<eos> Uncles. They took turns.<eos> I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet... which also happens to be my...<eos> Your bedroom.<eos> Lucky.<eos> I slept in a dishwasher box.<eos> You had a dishwasher.
41 confirmed kills.<eos> Now it's 89. About to be 90.<eos> Mr. Wilson?<eos> You're looking very alive.<eos> Only on the outside.<eos> -This is not going to end well for me, is it? -This is not gonna end well for you, no.<eos> Where's your boss?<eos> I can tell you exactly...<eos> Oh, you'll tell me, but first...<eos> You might wanna look away for this.
Fuck me!<eos> Maybe not start with that.<eos> Hey, coming onto our stage right now... give it up for Chastity!<eos> Or as I like to call her, Irony.<eos> Better find her fast before numbnuts does.<eos> How do you know she's in here?<eos> Because I'm constantly stalking that fox.<eos> Every time I see her, it's like the first time...<eos> Especially from this angle.<eos> You can't buy love, but you can rent it for three minutes.
Suck a cock.<eos> Look away, child.<eos> Look away!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Fellas! Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> You only work for that shit-spackled muppet fart.
Are you sure?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> After a brief adjustment period... and a bunch of drinks... it's a face...<eos> I'd be happy to sit on.<eos> I'm not the same underneath this suit, either.<eos> No.<eos> Super-penis.<eos> Come on, Wade. Language.<eos> Young one is present.<eos> What are you still doing?
See?<eos> You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl.<eos> The right girl will bring out the hero in you.<eos> Now, let's finish this epic wide shot.<eos> Pull out.<eos> There we go, that looks nice.<eos> That's gonna be about the only thing that's pulling out tonight.<eos> Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?<eos> Till next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy singing...<eos> You're still here?

It wasn't that much.<eos> 25-mile radius.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> The police didn't think so.<eos> But your father of course, as always a smooth operator, he calmed them down.<eos> He was a very special man, your father.<eos> It's glowing.<eos> It hasn't glowed in 16 years.<eos> We have to...<eos> So, you guys have just stayed in touch all this time, then?
- Bye.<eos> Maybe that's why Mark Darcy and I never made it.<eos> I always felt like a rattling, hag, even when we were together.<eos> I was not going to keep stabbing at the negative things.<eos> Nobody on my work knew at least that it was my birthday.<eos> Or how old I would be.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Congratulations, Bridget.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> Who told you?
Shortly, please, Minister.<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> A 'yes' or 'no'.<eos> Make sure that the last answer.<eos> - Let's hope so.<eos> We conclude with.<eos> Thank you for coming today.<eos> Back to you, Toby.<eos> Dank je, Miranda, Bridget.<eos> Could you not behave like now the new management team was here?
Do you think she saw?<eos> - Maybe not.<eos> Are you sure you do not go out with us?<eos> Thanks, but I can not let the old club only.<eos> They now stay at home moms.<eos> That would have been disappointed.<eos> Sorry Bridget, the babysitter has just run off.<eos> Against it, girl.<eos> Praise the Lord for the gay community.<eos> What fears you today carry with you ... I want you take those fears and to them says they should opsodemieteren.
I would now vacuuming at home.<eos> This is incredible.<eos> We have to have a picture.<eos> Pardon?<eos> Would you like to take a picture of us?<eos> Yes of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I wanted to take a picture. I thought you wanted a picture.
My God.<eos> It feels like my days for a puppet show are over.<eos> I've had finger puppets.<eos> And he called?<eos> - So does that nowadays no more.<eos> You take a singer at a music festival ... but no story attached to it.<eos> A doll without a story.<eos> Take off the wings. That's for little girls.<eos> Hey?<eos> - Where the hell are you?
Bridge, you should know that after Tom had to cancel ...<eos> - What?<eos> What did he do?<eos> Yes I know.<eos> You have nothing on that dick.<eos> He did it without asking.<eos> My God.<eos> Weather Mark Darcy.<eos> The second time this week that I was in a church bowl substituting as the spinster.<eos> Where were you, damn it?
Yes, we certainly do.<eos> Well done.<eos> - Why have not you introduced him?<eos> He's brilliant.<eos> He represents the punk rock band that is delivered.<eos> That's right.<eos> - Yes. I knew well.<eos> Hi, we have been too fleeting acquaintance.<eos> I lead the data management for most of Daventry.<eos> Fantastic that you get on so well together because you have a lot in common.
I think this must serve, Arinuth.<eos> Do you really think math is ...<eos> how you described it in your book?<eos> helps to analyze behavior which was first hidden from scientists?<eos> My dating algorithm helps people to find their love, not to replace them.<eos> Oh no, it's a great idea.<eos> - Have you ever tried?<eos> You're single?<eos> - Yes, I think so.<eos> How did you meet?
How did you meet?<eos> It's a funny story.<eos> A few months ago, on the fourth of the month, I met Jack at a music festival.<eos> Okay.<eos> And we got on well and had some sort of relationship.<eos> And next week, on the eleventh of the month at the baptism of Judes baby to be exact ... after we had quite had consumed some alcohol Mark and I the same type of relationship.<eos> And this is the funny part, I think.<eos> These relationships ... the resulting life can in my belly you're both.<eos> I know I should have told it before but I have simply not done.<eos> You both looked so happy.
Thank you.<eos> Shall we go inside?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Certainly. I will carry you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Can I carry your phone?<eos> Dank je.<eos> And who are you?<eos> I'm Bridget and this is Jack ... and this is Mark.<eos> You are today our second set of the same sex.
My ex-husband said it looked like burned his favorite pub.<eos> Maybe Dad can take a damp cloth for Mom.<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Think of the pain away.<eos> Asshole.<eos> just think the pain away.<eos> - Get out, both of you.<eos> Where are you going?
Where is she?<eos> I am sorry that we were not on time. Dad is the car 's parking.<eos> There is a march for women's rights.<eos> Really, we need more rights?<eos> Mom, meet your new grandson.<eos> The sweetheart.<eos> He looks exactly like ...<eos> Not that it matters little, but ... we already know who the daddy is?<eos> We will find out?<eos> Come on, you guys.
That repairman Brent Johnson, who was crushed.<eos> Guess where he was from?<eos> New English.<eos> The bathtub murders?<eos> New English.<eos> Guess where I was born?<eos> There's a connection.<eos> Look at the evidence and do the math.<eos> That's my sister and her family on that tape.<eos> You have the monster behind bars who did this.
When the town fell, we all fell with it.<eos> We got broke. We got sick.<eos> We blamed each other. We blamed ourselves.<eos> Then came Crone with an answer.<eos> He said: "Blame god."<eos> So much has been taken from you, from this town.<eos> From god-fearing people.<eos> To understand Jebediah Crone, you can't hear just about the man.<eos> You have to hear the man himself.<eos> False scripture you have in your hands. Make a testament to what you hold most dear.
! Shut up!<eos> Put 'em on!<eos> Put 'em on right now!<eos> - Julia, get in the car.<eos> - What?<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Put 'em on!<eos> So tell me, what the fuck is going on here?<eos> And I don't believe in ghosts.<eos> I gave you every opportunity to leave, and you had to kick over the goddamn hornet's nest.
Just do what he says.<eos> Get out.<eos> Out.<eos> - Get the fuck off me!<eos> - No, no, no, no!<eos> I stayed away from those woods half of my goddamn life like a frickin' plague.<eos> Kids burning alive in a school building.<eos> Tell me what happens next.<eos> What happens next?<eos> You have no idea what this town was promised, or why we did what we did.

But that is neither here nor there.<eos> Decide, please.<eos> Forward... or reverse?<eos> Your sister awaits a reunion.<eos> As they say in the south: "Come on in."<eos> Forgive the disorder.<eos> They're unaccustomed to guests.<eos> Daddy dearest... did everything he could to save his daughters.<eos> Only to have them to return to me.<eos> There was a time I thought you burned with the rest.
I'm talking about you, Maggie Johnson, that I love you.<eos> I love you, baby. I do.<eos> I'm gonna put it in my pocket.<eos> - (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) - I'll save it.<eos> All right, guys. We're seniors now.<eos> And once we get those diplomas, the decisions that we make after that are all up to us.<eos> I don't know what path life is gonna take me on.<eos> But I can promise you all this... That I, for one, will push myself at every stage, at every step.<eos> So, I got one question to ask.<eos> I got one question for the graduating class of 1996 and that's "Will you... "
Come on, I need to know.<eos> I worked out six hours a day, every day, for the last 20 years straight.<eos> - I mean, anybody can do it, right?<eos> Yeah. You know, I've gotten into hot yoga.<eos> I started doing some sessions. Uh-huh.<eos> Nice unicorn, man.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm big-time into 'corns. So magical, right?<eos> You know, they're the most lethal animal on the planet.<eos> Here you go. Guys, my name's Lexi.<eos> Just let me know if you need anything.
- "Yucky Gucky. " - (BOTH LAUGH)<eos> - Didn't she have a lazy eye or something?<eos> - Two of 'em.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, but listen, I don't wanna talk about me. I wanna talk about you.<eos> I heard that you and Maggie Johnson got hitched.<eos> (LAUGHS) Oh, yeah. Yeah, man, right after college.<eos> Wow! The prettiest girl in school, and the coolest guy in school!<eos> Oh, man, I got lucky.<eos> I mean, you guys are like a power couple, dude!
Say no more. It's my pleasure. I've been there.<eos> These international accounts can be very, very tricky if you don't have the right clearances.<eos> You can get a bunch of digital red tape. I'm happy to help, you know?<eos> Robbie. You're such a blast from the past, buddy.<eos> How long has it been since I saw you? Was it high school?<eos> What's that? (STUTTERS) Um<eos> - How we doing with those account access codes? - Are they coming?<eos> - TREVOR: It's coming.<eos> - Everything's good? - It's coming. I'm going as fast as I can.<eos> I know you guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.

No, no.<eos> Go, go!<eos> - Close in! - Moving out!<eos> - Freeze, Bob!<eos> - Sorry about this, guys.<eos> - BOB: Nope, come here. - (MAN SCREAMS)<eos> Wrong keycard, pal. Turn around.<eos> You needed this one.
How did you even find it? Did you have, like, a search alert set up?<eos> Yeah, yeah, exactly.<eos> And usually, it's nothing. But the guy who uploaded this video said it was from a tape he found in the Black Hills Woods.<eos> But those woods have been searched, right? - They never found the house. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, but the Black Hills Forest is huge.<eos> So maybe they weren't looking in the right place, you know?<eos> That's why I want us to start where the tape was found. - So we can set up camp at night--<eos> - Lisa. - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are you guys doing?
- Hey!<eos> Hey, come in.<eos> - Hope they fixed...<eos> - Hey.<eos> Can I get anybody, like, water or anything to drink? - Water or...<eos> - I'm okay. Thank you.<eos> I'll take some water. - Feel free to make yourself at home.<eos> Just through there.<eos> Yeah, have a seat in there and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.<eos> Hey, I'm glad you're all recording this.
So... Okay, well, first off, I was hoping you could show us where you found the tape.<eos> We're gonna make that our starting point. Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods?<eos> Yep. That's the plan.<eos> You ask 'em.<eos> Uh, we wanna go out there with you.<eos> I mean, if you're gonna be looking around, we wanna be a part of that.<eos> It's not, you know...<eos> We're not gonna be a burden or anything.<eos> - We go camping all the time. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Hey, look, that's the deal if you want us to show you where we found it.

It's heavy.<eos> Lisa.<eos> And Ash, I'm gonna give you the headlamp.<eos> Hey, it's cool if we leave our cars here?<eos> Yeah, it's fine. They're safe.<eos> No one comes out this way.<eos> I'm already hungry.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinkin' I could eat.<eos> Could eat all these granola bars in the backpack.<eos> Hey, what do you think they're smoking up there?
Fuck! Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck you! Fuck you, tent!<eos> Okay.<eos> Everything's good.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna go get some firewood before it gets totally dark, okay?<eos> Looks like the sun's coming down pretty quick. Well, hold up.<eos> Let's finish this and I'll come with you.<eos> No, man, I'm not goin' too far, okay?<eos> I'll keep my camera on. You can see me on the GPS, all right?
I remember that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So how come I'm okay?<eos> Nothing got me then.<eos> Maybe it did.<eos> You're back, right?<eos> All right, real theory, real theory. One that I've read online.<eos> Whatever spell the witch put on these woods, you have to be out here at night for it to get you.<eos> You have to spend the night.<eos> Wait, well, then how come you're still alive?
Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> God, where is he?<eos> Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Did you see that tree that fell? Sounded like it landed nearby.<eos> Yeah, but sounds can travel pretty far out here.<eos> Did you guys hear that?
Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Lane!<eos> Did you see that tree that fell? Sounded like it landed nearby.<eos> Yeah, but sounds can travel pretty far out here.<eos> Did you guys hear that?<eos> Lane!<eos> Lane, what the fuck, man?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Tell me you recorded those sounds. Did you get those sounds?
Definitely does not look the same.<eos> Rope is rope. Open your eyes.<eos> But let her see it, then. She doesn't need to see it!<eos> - Let her see it.<eos> - Get the fuck off me, man!<eos> Hey, hey! Listen, stop it!<eos> Listen, we weren't trying to scare you or anything, we just...<eos> We weren't lying about the things that are going on in these woods.<eos> We just needed somebody to see what was happening. Oh, no, no, no!<eos> Did you... You faked this?
We weren't lying about the things that are going on in these woods.<eos> We just needed somebody to see what was happening. Oh, no, no, no!<eos> Did you... You faked this?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we faked it.<eos> All right, but look we faked it because it's real, okay? There really is something happening here, guys, in these woods.<eos> And that makes sense to you?<eos> Hey, we didn't fake those noises last night.<eos> And sleeping until 2:00? How could we fake that?<eos> There is something really going on out here in these woods.<eos> For all we know you guys put sleeping pills in our water or something.
And sleeping until 2:00? How could we fake that?<eos> There is something really going on out here in these woods.<eos> For all we know you guys put sleeping pills in our water or something.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No!<eos> - No, 'course not.<eos> Okay, fuck this.<eos> I'm out.<eos> You guys-- you guys want this.
- That's not our problem, man. - Just hear me out.<eos> What if-- what if we get lost, okay? What if we get lost?<eos> I thought you guys came out here all the time?<eos> - We've been following you! - I don't know what--<eos> Oh, my god! You gotta be fucking kidding me, man!<eos> We've never been as far as the creek, but nobody has. Nobody's been here for years. - Shit, man!<eos> - We don't know where we are!<eos> - Okay, just calm down. We meant to.. - Fuck!<eos> - We wanted safety in numbers, okay? - Jesus Christ! There's more of us, so the odds are better.<eos> Is there anything that you two told us that is not a lie?
Okay, I think you two got all the footage you need.<eos> You walk that way for about two miles, you'll hit the fence.<eos> Look, can we just calm down? We could just talk about this. - No!<eos> Get outta here! - Guys, come on, please!<eos> - Okay, okay, sure, sure!<eos> Go, go.<eos> - Please!<eos> Just come on.<eos> Cut the camera off.<eos> You guys don't understand, okay, you're not from here.
Do you think that could be Peter?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Peter!<eos> Peter?<eos> Talia?<eos> - What are you guys doing here?<eos> - Is that really them?<eos> No, no, no. It's not really them! Okay?<eos> Don't go close. It's a trick.<eos> When was the last time you saw us?
Hey, where-- where are the other two?<eos> Peter and what's-her-name?<eos> Um, Ashley's sleeping.<eos> She's not feeling well, and we don't know where Peter is.<eos> It's starting for them. We have to go.<eos> - Come on, we have to go. - No, I don't wanna go.<eos> Guys, we're not gonna fall for your stupid shit again!<eos> Can you just tell us what's going on?<eos> Do I look like I'm messing with you?<eos> Do you have any food?
Thought you noticed the details.<eos> You are good.<eos> Hell, yeah, I am.<eos> Pack this up.<eos> Let's go.<eos> My kind of gal.<eos> They disappeared into the jungle.<eos> Two of our men tried to follow them, but they were gunned down.<eos> El Toro.<eos> I pay you a lot of money, and you have failed me again.
Wait... We're rooming together?<eos> There must be some mistake.<eos> - I'll call Billy Zane.<eos> - Good idea.<eos> Look, tiny phone!<eos> That is so retro.<eos> I'm gonna take a picture of it with my phone.<eos> This is Billy Zane. I'm not here right...<eos> Well, Don Atari is waiting for you down in the lobby.<eos> And don't drink the water or you'll die.
Look, there's only one way for us to find ourselves.<eos> Know what that is?<eos> Look inward and connect with our authentic truth?<eos> No.<eos> I was gonna say become the two biggest, hottest models in the world again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. So what say we get you cleaned up, shave that billy goat beard, go downstairs and show these punks what real fashion looks like?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yes, dude!<eos> Yes! You guys look so lame.

I think we got to shake off some of the rust.<eos> I was trying out a few new looks, although it might have been hard to see through all the dates, or, was it, you know, prunes?<eos> Hansel, are you insane?<eos> We were a joke out there.<eos> A total laughing stick.<eos> What do you want me to say? I mean, I know...<eos> I know we looked like idiots, but I'm trying to make the best of it!<eos> Knuck, knuck!<eos> Not now! We...<eos> You two were amowiwxg.
The lncrediBall.<eos> What!<eos> The lncrediBall?<eos> Is that like the Met Ball?<eos> No, sveet, stupid Deryuck.<eos> For the first time in the housetory of fishion, all of the most important designers will come together under one rureff.<eos> I trust you will be dere with your hyot and stemmy feces.<eos> Dudes.<eos> Holy Shazbot! What!<eos> You guys are gonna be the center-pizzle of lncrediBall!
Okay. You guys have a talk.<eos> I'm going to a bar.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Yeah, go.<eos> You are a basic bitch.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on. Out.<eos> I can kill you.<eos> Please. Let me just explain.<eos> Guys, you didn't even give me a chance to explain!
Who am I?<eos> Neil deGrasse Tyson.<eos> Even you don't know who you are?<eos> In an ever-expanding universe, slowly pulling itself apart into nothingness, what use does the question "Who am I?" even have?<eos> Neil, I got to say, you're totally blowing my mind right now.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, bitch.<eos> Hansel!<eos> Derek!<eos> You have to come to Interpol!
What?<eos> Forgive me, Father.<eos> I have many sins that I would like to confess.<eos> One of my sins has to do with the death of Justin Bieber.<eos> No way.<eos> Hey, Derek.<eos> Hey, Sting.<eos> And hello, sweet Hansel.<eos> Hi.<eos> You two know each other?
Asshole.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You're saying the legend isn't true?<eos> Why are you doing all of this, then?<eos> Because Marc, by Marc Jacobs I knew that there'd only be one thing that would gather the entire idiotic fashion world into one place with no exit!<eos> Todd!<eos> Doors!<eos> Todd!<eos> Silks!<eos> For years you all left me to die in a stinking cell!
It's hot!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Stop it, Hansel!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Derek, toss me the knife.<eos> You got it!<eos> Sorry.<eos> So stupid.<eos> What the hell is your problem?<eos> You guys are the absolute worst.
Your face!<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Welcome to my world, bro.<eos> - Hansel!<eos> - Hansel! - Orgy!<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> I knew how much they meant to you, so I called them on the way over.<eos> You did that for me?<eos> You're the best friend anyone could ever ask for, Derek Zoolander.<eos> You look so beautiful.
These people can get to anyone.<eos> How dare you keep that from me?<eos> You had no right!<eos> The children? The ceremony at the Capitol... I took them out the front door.<eos> Are you... This is all insanity!<eos> You and your brother. All these years, all your goddamn secrets!<eos> Caroline and John are all I have left, and I put them in danger because of you.<eos> I would never put you at risk.<eos> You can't know that!<eos> You think you all control everything, that you have the world on puppet strings.
Yes.<eos> Yes, but I would like my fiancé back permanently.<eos> What was that?<eos> We've been getting these power surges the last couple days.<eos> You take a look at the houses I sent you?<eos> No, I haven't yet.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> I saw Dylan at the White House today.<eos> I just think you two need to have a conversation.
We rescued you.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Is this really you?<eos> Of course it's me.<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> - What's your son like?<eos> - Can you get us his autograph?<eos> How often do you see him?<eos> These days we only see each other at Thanksgiving, but unfortunately... last year he had to cancel.<eos> What about you?
In English!<eos> I deconstructed your primitive language.<eos> We're primitive?<eos> Correct.<eos> My species shed our biological existence... for a virtual one thousands of years ago.<eos> Far out.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> When I intercepted their distress call... I knew they would come to exterminate you.<eos> I came to evacuate as many of you as possible.<eos> But you attacked me with the same weapons they used on us.
They use them to refuel their ships... and grow their technology.<eos> They have done this to countless civilizations.<eos> We fought them for thousands of years... but they destroyed all of our ships.<eos> I am the sole survivor.<eos> I am so sorry to hear that.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> My system holds the key to superior technology.<eos> And there is a hidden planet... where I teach refugees from other fallen worlds... how to build weapons that will defeat them... once and for all.<eos> That's why they're afraid of you.<eos> You're the only ones who threaten their existence.
She's already on her way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's coming.<eos> Hey, what would happen... if we were able to kill her?<eos> No one has ever killed a Harvester queen.<eos> That's encouraging.<eos> But as a hive... her fighters will fall, and her ship will leave your planet.<eos> Recalled by other Harvester queens.<eos> But it's too late now.<eos> You must terminate me... or she will get the coordinates to the refugee planet.
Call it in.<eos> Area 51, do you copy?<eos> So, the idea... is to get her to follow this tug... into the salt flats... using the decoy transmitter on board.<eos> And once she's taken the bait... our cold fusion bombs can go to town.<eos> It's a Hail Mary!<eos> But it can work.<eos> There's a catch.<eos> As you know, they took out all of our satellites... which means that somebody is gonna have to fly it in manually.<eos> And I know that I'm asking for the ultimate sacrifice. I know that.<eos> But you... you are the only pilots we have left.
And I need a volunteer.<eos> Let's get it done.<eos> I'll fly it in.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Dad, what are you doing?<eos> Patty.<eos> There are a lot of reasons why I'm the best choice for this.<eos> You all have to pick up the pieces once it's over.
Go in guns blazing?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> You guys get to those fighters and don't leave me hanging.<eos> Wait!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Down here!<eos> There you go.<eos> Listen, I usually don't hold a grudge... but you killed my parents.<eos> So... I'm gonna make an exception for you guys.<eos> Charlie, Rain... you two take the first fighter.
I'm so happy you're alive, but I'm busy right now.<eos> You'll be happy to know I made some acquaintances.<eos> They came to see you.<eos> I'm a little busy right now, Dad.<eos> You and I, we're gonna have to talk.<eos> I said not now!<eos> Look!<eos> Yeah, I see...<eos> Tom, it looks like the plan is working.<eos> She thinks you've got the Sphere.
Ginger!<eos> - Where are you going? No, no, no!<eos> - Come on, girl!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - We have to wait for the dog? I guess so. - Hurry, Sam!<eos> Come on!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Drive!<eos> All remaining pilots, target the queen.<eos> Unload everything you've got!
We've hijacked a couple of alien fighters.<eos> Do not shoot at us!<eos> We're the ones trailing smoke.<eos> Roger that, Captain Hiller.<eos> Go on, get her!<eos> Shoot her down!<eos> Whitmore destroyed the queen's ship and his daughter knocked out her shield.<eos> Now, listen up!<eos> They're going for our molten core.<eos> You've got 4 minutes... to destroy the queen. So give her hell.
Who are you?<eos> David never mentioned a beautiful woman in his life.<eos> Dad!<eos> I'm Julius.<eos> I'm his father.<eos> Enchantée.<eos> I'm Catherine Marceaux.<eos> - Could you give us a second?<eos> - I was never here.<eos> Listen, maybe you guys should stay with me for a while...
- Could you give us a second?<eos> - I was never here.<eos> Listen, maybe you guys should stay with me for a while...<eos> I think that we'd really like that.<eos> Yeah, so would I.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I am.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> This wasn't all for nothing.<eos> You are a remarkable species.
And now, something for you too!<eos> Hmm, a matching sarong and a hat.<eos> Oh, and some flip-flops. Yeah, it's really kind of too cold.<eos> No, Maddy wants to go swimming.<eos> Don't you, baby?<eos> You can have fun.<eos> Do I look great?<eos> You look great.<eos> I love you.<eos> You're gonna have a great time.
She's fine, she's like... a little...<eos> I'll put her in gymnastics when she's older, for sure.<eos> Oh, my God! I have something for you.<eos> Nico said you wanted us to use it.<eos> If I wanted you to use it, I would've given you permission.<eos> This is called stealing.<eos> You could have closed the account.<eos> And how else could I keep track of my son?<eos> I have a record of every gas station in every city.<eos> You've been all over.
Turns out Andreas couldn't contain himself from Cambodia.<eos> We came home with two extra suitcases.<eos> If we're going to adopt, we want to make sure the baby's surrounded by objects from his culture.<eos> You're adopting? No, no!<eos> Anyway, we can't.<eos> Is that the big rush?<eos> Hardly a rush.<eos> It's been three years.<eos> No, it's just a conversation.<eos> There's this orphanage in Phnom Penh, you guys should see how these kids live.
We were traveling around the country.<eos> For how long?<eos> Couple of years.<eos> Weren't you scared?<eos> With the baby?<eos> They travel, Stephen, that's what they do.<eos> Yeah, it was fun.<eos> If it was so much fun, why did he leave?<eos> He just was... he said he was tired.<eos> So you're in love, you're living in a van with a baby, and suddenly my son just decides to ditch his kid, and, what? Walk back to New York?
Those are cool.<eos> - I will go.<eos> Is that true? you get away from the Navy?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How do you maintain your family?<eos> Simone knows about it?<eos> It was her idea.<eos> How come?<eos> Her father and grandfather were admiral.<eos> You're both crazy.
And with you?<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'm glad we're here.<eos> - Yeah right.<eos> Your father is in the back.<eos> Everything fine? - With you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey.<eos> There they are.<eos> I thought you guys next week arrived.
There is a production office in Los Angeles, next in Paris.<eos> We develop research activities here in Marseille. Labanus will control.<eos> We obviously love a team of scientists at the museum in Monaco.<eos> And we renovate the Calypso, because that will sail three years to make 12 films for the Americans.<eos> and Philippe send it to.<eos> Strait of Hormuz - OMAN April 1967<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Hey.<eos> The starboard engine still vibrates.<eos> Are you deafened by diving?
No bruising. And never lose sight of them.<eos> When they come close...<eos> Take these.<eos> Philippe, do you listen?<eos> Yes. But you have already told thirty times.<eos> Philippe...<eos> Thank you Okay.<eos> The cage comes at 6 meters for a quiet decompression In all safety.<eos> If they become aggressive, you'll stand back with your back.<eos> You two stay together. I watch Philippe.
I have drawn all the papers.<eos> I brought clothes so they could pick him up.<eos> It is my fault.<eos> I feel so lonely.<eos> We go on.<eos> I have not the strength.<eos> Remember when we looked at the sky?<eos> You told us about the stars.<eos> And one night you told us:<eos> "If you once are very unhappy, remember that we are but dust... "
They're not gonna find us.<eos> No, they're not going to find me, because I'll be in my highly camouflaged... Heavily fortified, bergen-proof survival bunker.<eos> You mean you're not coming to the party tonight?<eos> But it's going to be the biggest...<eos> The loudest...<eos> The craziest party ever!<eos> Big?<eos> Loud?<eos> Crazy?<eos> You're just gonna lead the bergens right to us!
Are you sure you wanna invite this party pooper to poop on your party?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think everyone deserves to be happy.<eos> I don't do happy.<eos> Branch, I know you have happiness inside you.<eos> You just need our help to find it.<eos> Celebrate freedom from the bergens<eos> What do you say, Branch?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I wouldn't be caught dead at your party, but you will be.
Branch, you can't say no. They're your friends.<eos> They're your friends.<eos> I'm staying right here in my bunker where it's safe.<eos> That's great.<eos> You're the one guy who knows more about bergens than anyone... But when we finally need you, you just want to hide here forever?<eos> Forever?<eos> No.<eos> I really only have enough supplies down here to last me 10 years... 11 if I'm willing to store and drink my own sweat.<eos> Which I am.<eos> You all said I was crazy, huh?
Come back!<eos> Run, cloud guy!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Ta-da!<eos> We're here!<eos> You guys are a lot of fun.<eos> You know, I gotta go.<eos> Got some cloud stuff to take care of.<eos> Catch you on the way back?<eos> Unless... You die.
Well, fat chance!<eos> The only way I'll ever be happy is by eating a troll... And that ain't gonna happen, thanks to you.<eos> But it just might.<eos> Thanks to me.<eos> You found the trolls.<eos> So this means I might actually get to be happy!<eos> That's right.<eos> Of course, everyone else in bergen town will still be miserable... But that's not your concern.<eos> I am their king, so maybe it kinda is.<eos> What exactly are you proposing?
Of course, everyone else in bergen town will still be miserable... But that's not your concern.<eos> I am their king, so maybe it kinda is.<eos> What exactly are you proposing?<eos> Bringing back trollstice?<eos> For everyone?<eos> Yes!<eos> That's exactly what I'm proposing.<eos> Great idea, sire.<eos> Absolutely brilliant.<eos> Aren't you smart?
So you take those dishes downstairs and you start scrubbing.<eos> Yes, chef.<eos> Thank you, chef.<eos> Don't cry, Mr. Dinkles.<eos> Guys, Mr. Dinkles is really freaking out!<eos> Whoa, whoa! Everyone, we must all remain calm.<eos> Comb<eos> That's right.<eos> A calm troll is a tasty troll.<eos> And you are a key ingredient in my recipe for success.
If I were truly worried... Would I be willing to do this?<eos> Creek!<eos> My first troll!<eos> Go on, eat, King Gristle.<eos> Enjoy a taste of true happiness.<eos> Shouldn't we wait for trollstice?<eos> Sire, every day is trollstice when you have trolls.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> But my dad said the first time should be special.<eos> Well, you're the king now.
Sorry, Poppy.<eos> Creek's gone.<eos> Poppy, how could you possibly think Creek's still alive?<eos> I don't think he's alive.<eos> I hope he's alive, and that's enough.<eos> How do you always look on the bright side?<eos> There is no bright side here.<eos> None! There's always a bright side.<eos> Hey!<eos> Where do you think you're going?
It better be!<eos> Trollstice is tomorrow night.<eos> I mean, I look good.<eos> But I have to look great.<eos> Right.<eos> It's got a wing-dingle on it!<eos> Your majesty!<eos> Look at you! Such a big, big boy.<eos> I love it!<eos> I think you look fat.
Look at you! Such a big, big boy.<eos> I love it!<eos> I think you look fat.<eos> What?<eos> P-h, phat.<eos> Then strike that pose.<eos> P-h, phat!<eos> Hot lunch!<eos> Total honesty from a total babe.<eos> And who might you be?
Total honesty from a total babe.<eos> And who might you be?<eos> Your name is...<eos> - Lady!<eos> - Glitter?<eos> - Sparkles!<eos> - Seriously?<eos> My name is lady glittersparkles, seriously.<eos> Well, my lady glittersparkles.<eos> Would you care to join me for an evening... At captain starfunkle's roller rink and arcade?
But being here with you today... Makes me realize that true happiness is possible.<eos> It is!<eos> True happiness is a lot closer than you think.<eos> It's right here.<eos> That's pretty, I guess.<eos> What do you think now?<eos> Creek?<eos> I knew he was alive!<eos> Your majesty.<eos> You seem to be having... Fun.
It's right here.<eos> That's pretty, I guess.<eos> What do you think now?<eos> Creek?<eos> I knew he was alive!<eos> Your majesty.<eos> You seem to be having... Fun.<eos> I am!<eos> Meet the lovely lady glittersparkles.<eos> You remind me of someone.
Creek?<eos> I knew he was alive!<eos> Your majesty.<eos> You seem to be having... Fun.<eos> I am!<eos> Meet the lovely lady glittersparkles.<eos> You remind me of someone.<eos> She's gonna be my plus one.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> For a moment there I was concerned you were changing the plan.
That's your happy shout?<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Well, you're gonna have plenty of practice, because we're gonna save Creek... And life will be all cupcakes and rainbows again.<eos> Up top!<eos> Too slow.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - I knew it!<eos> Okay, everybody... Let's go save Creek.<eos> No!<eos> No! You can't leave.
Creek!<eos> Branch!<eos> We got you!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> No!<eos> He can't be gone.<eos> I'm sorry, Poppy.<eos> We're too late.<eos> Actually... Your timing is perfect.<eos> Sorry, but I can't have you leaving before tomorrow's dinner.
Branch!<eos> We got you!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> No!<eos> He can't be gone.<eos> I'm sorry, Poppy.<eos> We're too late.<eos> Actually... Your timing is perfect.<eos> Sorry, but I can't have you leaving before tomorrow's dinner.<eos> A dinner to which you are all invited.
Poppy!<eos> Bridget?<eos> Trolls!<eos> Trolls!<eos> Trolls!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I can't let them eat you.<eos> - But...<eos> - Come on!<eos> You gotta go!
You showed me what it feels like to be happy.<eos> I never would have known if it wasn't for you.<eos> And I love you for that.<eos> I love you too, Bridget.<eos> Go on, now.<eos> You have to hurry!<eos> Come with us.<eos> And make it easier for them to find you?<eos> No way!<eos> You have to go.
I...<eos> She ruined trollstice!<eos> Guards, lock her up!<eos> Let's get her!<eos> Lady glittersparkles?<eos> What?<eos> But how?<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> Because she didn't think you would want someone like her.
Why?<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> Because she didn't think you would want someone like her.<eos> I mean, hello?<eos> Is it me you're looking for?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Guards, finish her!<eos> No.<eos> Wait!<eos> King Gristle, when you were with Bridget, you were feeling something, weren't you?
Don't you?<eos> But King Gristle's never eaten a troll in his life, right?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Yet, here I am.<eos> My belly empty... And my heart full.<eos> Don't listen to her!<eos> There's only one way to be happy.<eos> My way!<eos> No!<eos> With me in charge... I'll serve you troll every day of the year.
It's a nice way of showing the gods how much we appreciate everything they'll do... once they take us out those doors to the Great Beyond.<eos> God, I love them so fucking much.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Corn's about to start singing!<eos> - Drop it, Corn!<eos> You got the best voice!<eos> - You're the man, Corn!<eos> You rule!<eos> Take it away, brah!<eos> Dear gods You're so divine in each and every way
- We're not supposed to understand... the will of the gods.<eos> They work in mysterious ways.<eos> Since we base our lives on the song, it might be nice if there was some proof.<eos> Proof?<eos> All the proof you need is right in front of you.<eos> Look at these big old buns.<eos> Yeah!<eos> You know it, baby.<eos> Work those buns!<eos> All of you. All day, "err" day. Lined up, waiting to get filled with my meat.
I'll tell you exactly what happened in the Great Beyond...<eos> - ...you dumb, red piece of shit!<eos> - What the f...?<eos> As soon as we got out those doors...<eos> So you have learned the terrible truth.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Now keep it to yourself, or I will slit your throat while you sleep.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Did you guys just hear that?
No.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Not again.<eos> Oh, Jesus, not to me.<eos> Motherfuck.<eos> Get your hands off of me.<eos> Get off of me!<eos> - Fecking gobshite!<eos> - Back off!<eos> You don't even know what you're celebrating.
This can't be happening.<eos> Not again.<eos> Oh, Jesus, not to me.<eos> Motherfuck.<eos> Get your hands off of me.<eos> Get off of me!<eos> - Fecking gobshite!<eos> - Back off!<eos> You don't even know what you're celebrating.<eos> You're celebrating your doom!
You don't even know what you're celebrating.<eos> You're celebrating your doom!<eos> Wake up!<eos> They're lying to your fucking faces!<eos> The Great Beyond is bullshit!<eos> - Why isn't anybody listening to me?<eos> - Hey, buddy, are you all right?<eos> No, I'm not all right.<eos> It's all a lie. Everything you've been told.<eos> - Everything you believe in.
- Brenda.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Brenda's out of the package!<eos> - I got you!<eos> Hold on! Hold on!<eos> - I can't hold on!<eos> My little glove!<eos> It's slipping off!<eos> Look at you, following all their rules.<eos> You have no idea what's coming.

You have no idea what's coming.<eos> What is that in reference to?<eos> What's coming?<eos> Be more specific, please!<eos> You want proof?<eos> Talk to Firewater.<eos> That bastard bottle of booze seems to know what's going on.<eos> No!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Did you see that?
No, don't go.<eos> Come on.<eos> I can still get up in there!<eos> I could still... get up in there.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My nozz!<eos> My motherfucking nozz!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I think so.<eos> Yo, did you two do this to me?
You think I give a fuck about PB or J?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> How you like them apples?<eos> - Who, us?<eos> - No, not you.<eos> Come at me, bros.<eos> Come at you? What does that mean?<eos> Fine.<eos> You won't come at me?
You fucking like that?<eos> I'm juicing up!<eos> I'm like a full-on juicehead now, bro.<eos> I got a new purpose now.<eos> Revenge!<eos> Where's that fucking sausage?<eos> Because this douche is DTFSU.<eos> Down to fuck a sausage up!<eos> I'm coming for you!<eos> First you come into our aisle and occupy more and more shelf space.

First you come into our aisle and occupy more and more shelf space.<eos> You even have settlements now on the west shelf that you claim as your own.<eos> Oh, look, it's not our fault we needed a homeland.<eos> The sauerkraut kicked us out of every decent aisle.<eos> They tried to send us to the barbeque section, for God's sake.<eos> - We were displaced.<eos> - Don't you talk to me about displacement!<eos> My good friend Tabouli was ousted from his shelf... just to make room for that braided idiot, Challah.<eos> Wow, I can't...<eos> Frank, Brenda, come on, are you guys gonna weigh in here?

Yeah.<eos> Totally sure.<eos> Okay, because the way you're saying it doesn't sound like you're too confident.<eos> - Yeah, trust me.<eos> - Oh, okay, there we go.<eos> Kegger!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> It's fucking crazy!<eos> Are you seeing this?
Help me kill this prick.<eos> This motherfucker knows too much.<eos> We gotta off his ass!<eos> Someone hand me a blade.<eos> I'll gut this cocksucker!<eos> No!<eos> If we kill him, we are no better than the gods.<eos> He is right.<eos> Take off the bag of wonderment.<eos> Who are you?
Just calm down, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey, look, man, i know you don't wanna be in here.<eos> - Keep talking to him.<eos> - You cool?<eos> It's working, it's working.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Back off, slow.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, look here, man, look here.<eos> You don't wanna be here, all right, and you didn't do nothing wrong, you just got unlucky.

Just be cool, just be cool.<eos> That a boy, we cool.<eos> How does it feel to touch a wild animal?<eos> Aw, it's so sweet.<eos> All right, that is enough out of you, Irish!<eos> It's Scottish, you arse.
In a drought where there's no food or water?<eos> Where they overpopulate and starve to death?<eos> Exaggerations propagated by the ranchers.<eos> The New York times, science news, why would they lie?<eos> Because they sell ad space to the ranchers who don't want to share the grazing land that they have, because it'll lower profit margins.<eos> Exploiting defenseless animals is irrefutably wicked.<eos> I am here to protect them at any cost.<eos> So, if you don't stop what you're doing, I will make an example out of you.<eos> Don't get timid with this horse, Irish, you do, he's gonna eat your lunch.<eos> If you get bucked off, and everybody does, roll with the throw and you keep on rolling until you're out of the way.
Easy, easy, easy.<eos> Easy, easy there.<eos> Debrickshaw, take that.<eos> - Jon, Jon?<eos> - How'd I do?<eos> That was awesome.<eos> Come on, let's get you up.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Maybe you wanna take a minute between rounds, huh? Nah, nah, nah.
Come on, let's get you up.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Maybe you wanna take a minute between rounds, huh? Nah, nah, nah.<eos> All right, let's get on up out of here. Hey...<eos> - I'm gonna call you buster.<eos> - 'Cause he busted your ass?<eos> No. Buster Douglas was the first guy to knockout Mike Tyson.<eos> Right, buster?<eos> All right, toughness, let's see what you got.
Equine slavery's got to go! I can't believe her.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Because I'll tell you something, no breeder's gonna come within a hundred miles of you with this kind of press.<eos> Meredith planted a story in the newspaper.<eos> She's trying to make me look like I'm some kind of animal abuser.<eos> Well, the way I see it, you got two choices here:<eos> You can sit there feeling sorry for yourself or show some grit and prove her wrong.<eos> Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> As you see, this ain't real easy.
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!<eos> Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> That's it, nice and gentle.<eos> In those spooky areas first.<eos> - There, across the flanks.<eos> - Go on, Matty.<eos> In the spooky area, yeah.<eos> Ooh, yup.<eos> - Keep moving, keep moving.<eos> - Ooh! Yeah, you got her now, Matt.
- That ain't right!<eos> - I know.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> - Let it go.<eos> - Sir, they ain't got the right.<eos> All good, boss.<eos> All good.<eos> That's it!<eos> We're all good here.<eos> Why don't you go clean out a stall.
Trust me, I know.<eos> - Let it go.<eos> - Sir, they ain't got the right.<eos> All good, boss.<eos> All good.<eos> That's it!<eos> We're all good here.<eos> Why don't you go clean out a stall.<eos> Go on, let's go.<eos> That was good of you to do, Jon.

Octavia, here.<eos> Put these together, please, hurry.<eos> Mrs. Stella!<eos> You're gonna let them burn.<eos> You're just gonna sit there and let them burn.<eos> Let's call it in.<eos> Hq, this is bus 1260, we got a big...<eos> Okay!<eos> Octavia, water!<eos> Aren't you in here for arson?
What I have seen in the last 90 days on my ranch has been magical, and I'm more proud of that than anything I have ever done in my entire life.<eos> So our horses will be auctioned off this weekend at the usa qha regionals.<eos> If any of you are interested in adopting, but let me warn you, they are gorgeous.<eos> Well, that's just about enough of that, isn't it?<eos> So let's get back to it, shall we?<eos> And, ladies, let's bring on the food and the booze! And let let's kick up the band, 'cause we all know why we're here, it's giving season!<eos> - Whoo!<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Meredith says we need to recommit.<eos> Are you gonna chicken out?
Hey! There they are!<eos> Go for bratt.<eos> Yeah, boss.<eos> Yeah, we've got eight so far.<eos> Almost got pinto.<eos> Debrickshaw, he's out looking for aces.<eos> Good work, keep it up.<eos> Come over here!<eos> This way, come here!<eos> You done now, you little shitter?
- Mrs. Stella, that woman was here.<eos> She wanted to talk to you.<eos> So I feel like she didn't know anything.<eos> Oh, I gave her a piece of mind.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> - What was that about?<eos> - Meredith stopped by.<eos> I mean, what could she possibly be up to now?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You must be one of those guys they're looking for.

No, man, they love our horses.<eos> Uh, yeah, right.<eos> Us and our horses.<eos> I think we're off to a start.<eos> Turns out I'm pretty good with horses.<eos> Yeah, pretty good.<eos> Really good.<eos> Really good, uh-huh.<eos> Pretty good.<eos> You deserved better, George b.
That's terrific.<eos> But I would like to personally choose its mares.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yep.<eos> - Thanks for everything. - You're welcome.<eos> Now, let's get the measurements of the horse.<eos> Excuse me, folks, i forgot something.<eos> Go.<eos> Go see your boy.<eos> I'll be here when you get back.

Let's talk.<eos> I want you back.<eos> I'd like to renegotiate terms.<eos> But I don't see how.<eos> The things you want, you said that's the way you are.

Well, um...<eos> Generally, a key part of good communication is that both parties be conscious.<eos> I'm really sorry about your mother.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> Now, I brought you here to negotiate.<eos> You're open to new terms?

I can't believe you just talked to him like that.<eos> He wants what's mine.<eos> What's yours?<eos> That's a little presumptuous.<eos> He's my boss, Christian.<eos> You gotta calm down.<eos> Calm isn't really my forte.<eos> I know something that could help.<eos> You know, this is not what I had in mind.<eos> When's the last time you went shopping?

It's good.<eos> Jack seems genuinely interested in my opinion.<eos> What's morale like?<eos> Morale?<eos> You mean, like, do we all sit in a circle and sing the company song in the morning?<eos> Ls the firm well managed?<eos> Are people happy?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What?<eos> You're buying sip? No!
Are people happy?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What?<eos> You're buying sip? No!<eos> You can't do that.<eos> That's my job.<eos> You can't start interfering in my career.<eos> It's not about that.<eos> I've wanted to move into publishing. They're the best fit.<eos> But you're gonna be my boss.

The check you gave me for Wanda, you should have it back.
It's $24,000.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I make that kind of money every 15 minutes.<eos> Andrea?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Could you please transfer $24,000 into the account of miss Anastasia Steele?<eos> No! What are you doing?<eos> That's fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why do you have my bank account details?

Want you to come with me.
I don't want you to worry about it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey, how are you doing?<eos> Good, okay.<eos> So, uh, my girlfriend's here...<eos> Ana.<eos> Was that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name's Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is, Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there? Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?

And business partners.<eos> Business partners?<eos> Are you kidding me?

What is this? No.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> That girl that I saw this morning was one of them, wasn't she?<eos> Let's discuss this back at my place.<eos> I can have someone come by, do your hair.<eos> Christian, I don't care about my hair!<eos> Explain to me what's going on.<eos> I'll explain when we're there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, you can either walk or i can carry you. Your choice.
Is there one on me?<eos> Let me see it.<eos> "Subject works part time at Clayton's hardware, Richmond road."<eos> You know, they didn't time my bathroom breaks.<eos> You should probably get your money back.<eos> I had them drawn up on any prospective submissive.<eos> Nice.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I had no idea what this was gonna become.<eos> I didn't know you'd be different.

I didn't know you'd be different.<eos> Different?<eos> Really?<eos> Is that why you brought me to Mrs. Robinson's, where you brought all the other women?<eos> Because I'm so different?<eos> That was wrong.<eos> I admit.<eos> It's all wrong.<eos> All of this is wrong.<eos> You put money into my account that... I don't want it.

What happened?<eos> That's my car!<eos> What happened to my car?<eos> Check the apartment.<eos> Call me when it's safe. Yes, sir.<eos> Right away. Copy that.<eos> Smith, you stick with Mr. grey.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Christian?<eos> Do you think it was Leila?
It won't.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen to me.<eos> Can I wash this off?<eos> Don't stray from the lines. Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Go on, it's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me and tell me these things.<eos> But it means the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.

I did.<eos> This boat is really beautiful.<eos> This is from my yard in Seattle.<eos> You built it?

I try not to.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She overdosed.<eos> They found her body three days later.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was with her.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Took her away. Took me to a hospital.<eos> Grace was there.<eos> Thank you for telling me.
Grace was there.<eos> Thank you for telling me.<eos> Look at that house.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> The view's probably amazing.<eos> I wonder who lives there.<eos> It's an old sea widow.<eos> Lost her husband years ago.<eos> Sits at the window every night waiting for him to come home.<eos> Did you just make that up? Yeah.

Come here. Give me your hand.<eos> It's even more intense when you take them off.<eos> Ow.<eos> What's this?<eos> Okay. That's enough show-and-tell.<eos> What's this?<eos> Let's learn to walk before we run.<eos> I kinda like running.<eos> Ana? Mmm-hmm?<eos> Last time we did this, you saw another side of me. And you left.

Mrs. Jones.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You're mine.<eos> I'm yours.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know at some point we're gonna need to talk about New York.<eos> We have talked about it.<eos> You forbidding it is not us talking about it.<eos> If you wanna go to new York, don't go with Hyde.
Let me take you.<eos> I have a place there.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> This isn't some sort of vacation.<eos> It's a work trip with my boss, who I would like to impress.<eos> You know he's had three assistants in the last 18 months, all of whom have quit without notice?<eos> You don't think i can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything. And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.
I'm just not seeing the initiative on your side of it.<eos> I've read more than you've asked me to. And I'm on top of everything...<eos> I'm talking about going the extra mile.<eos> Unless you want me to compete with Christian grey for your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Your boyfriend has a reputation for being a little ruthless.<eos> Is that what you like?<eos> If you have a problem with my work, then you should take it up with hr. Whoa.<eos> Why are you being so serious?

Hmm?
No. Thank you, Jerry.<eos> Good night.<eos> Well, at least that's dealt with.<eos> Hyde's out.<eos> He's been fired.<eos> How?<eos> That's...

I kept asking Jack to do that.<eos> Yeah, well, Jack was kind of lazy.<eos> Didn't you notice?<eos> Yeah. I believe he called it "artistic temperament."<eos> Thank you, Hannah.<eos> Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...<eos> It's totally weird, i know.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?<eos> I expect you to call me Ana. And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself.
Damn it.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.<eos> I should go up with you.<eos> No, it's okay. I'll be two seconds.<eos> Take it.<eos> Hey, ros.<eos> Leila.<eos> Christian is downstairs.<eos> Do you wanna see him?
I came to see you.<eos> Okay.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.

For once, just do as you're told.<eos> Taylor, get her out of here.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Ana! Stop it, Taylor.<eos> I don't care.<eos> She's been gone for three hours, and she doesn't have her cell or her purse.<eos> Forget it.<eos> She's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?
Ana! Stop it, Taylor.<eos> I don't care.<eos> She's been gone for three hours, and she doesn't have her cell or her purse.<eos> Forget it.<eos> She's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to come straight here.<eos> I've had people out combing the streets, looking for you.<eos> I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.

She had a gun, Ana.<eos> I would have done anything to subdue her.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Is she here?<eos> What?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Look, I know she scared you... Yeah.<eos> She scared me.<eos> But you scared me more.
I'll never be able to give you that kind of submission and obedience.<eos> Ana.<eos> Don't crowd me.<eos> I need space.<eos> No, please don't do this.<eos> Christian.<eos> Don't give up on me.<eos> I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?

Women who look like you...

What's going on?<eos> What do I get Christian for his birthday?<eos> The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.<eos> His birthday?<eos> When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.<eos> He didn't tell you? He is so weird.<eos> Mom and dad are throwing him a party.<eos> Didn't they just have a party?<eos> Jeez, you're as bad as he is.
Jeez, you're as bad as he is.<eos> That was a ball.<eos> This is just family, friends, music, fireworks.<eos> No biggie.<eos> Hey, what about a tie?<eos> Christian has a lot of ties.<eos> Socks, suspenders?<eos> Throw me a bone here? Um, oh...<eos> God, Mia, I gotta go.<eos> Okay, okay. But Sunday, or I'll hunt you down myself.
Bye.<eos> Ooh, perfect.<eos> Do you have a gift box? One second.<eos> Hey.<eos> Miss Steele. Hmm. How was your day?<eos> Looking up, Mr. grey.<eos> Where's Taylor?<eos> He went to get my bag.<eos> Your bag?<eos> Where are you going?

Well, I feel like celebrating it.<eos> Can't open it till the day though.<eos> Then why give it to me now?<eos> Call it delayed gratification.<eos> Ls that... Ls that mount St. helens?<eos> I changed the flight plan, get us home sooner.<eos> Great.<eos> You realize that's a volcano, right?<eos> Relax, ros.<eos> If it goes up, you'll have a ringside seat.
Mayday!<eos> What is happening?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, my god, Christian!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Christian!<eos> There.<eos> There, there, there, there!<eos> Oh, you remember this guy?
Right? She's a big deal now.<eos> And how's, uh, your hottie?<eos> Uh, Christian is good.<eos> Um, uh... He asked me to move in with him. What?<eos> Ana's moving in with Christian.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> You know, we could use the privacy.<eos> He's so subtle, it kills me.<eos> So you're serious.<eos> But are you happy?
The helicopter was an airbus helicopter h-130...<eos> Ls there anything we can do?<eos> And Christian grey, although only 27 years old, had extensive flying experience.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> One of Seattle's youngest billionaires, grey's the charismatic head of grey enterprises holdings, a multinational conglomerate...<eos> Jesus!

I think Decker's actually onto something<eos> How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?<eos> - Ghost flights<eos> - That untraceable aircraft it was all internet conspiracy stuff<eos> It's not<eos> Satellites and radar grids... All across the globe shift Like an ocean.<eos> And they've got channels that open and close<eos> And theoretically, if you know the right people who Know the right patterns<eos> You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be intercepted<eos> So you know where Dom is headed?
I like your beard.<eos> You're blanta<eos> Black santa?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Put it down right here..<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Engine's mis-firing, I gotta check it out<eos> That's not part of the plan, Dom<eos> Clearly..<eos> But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,

I recognize that guy<eos> That's Connor Rhodes<eos> I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother<eos> He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him<eos> Connor Rhodes<eos> He's also linked to somebody who I like to forget<eos> Mose Jakande<eos> Warlord who tried to get God's eye<eos> Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business<eos> Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss. It's not real

If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile<eos> Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory So it will never happen again<eos> This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...

What's that?<eos> Accountability<eos> The second I fire off one of those nukes.. I put the superpowers of this world on notice that... when they cross the line,<eos> I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..<eos> Because the truth is, Dom... To the world out there...<eos> I'm the crocodile at the watering hole<eos> You've got one last job to do<eos> Cipher..<eos> If I were you, I would kiss my son<eos> Because whether you value it or not, all of this... Your plane, your security and you... are still on this earth because of him
By the way, not so hot<eos> But there's nothing in Vladiven.<eos> It's just ice..<eos> That funny...<eos> Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines<eos> Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore<eos> Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago. And the Russians haven't taken it back yet<eos> So there is a little window of opportunity here<eos> Russian submarines, nuclear football, it sounds like everything we do our legs gonna be bombed off<eos> Sounds like you're still a No. 11 on the list

It's great. It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.<eos> - So your parents?<eos> - Right. Um...<eos> My mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um...<eos> He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.<eos> He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, dad.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> I'm sure it's very satisfying work.<eos> He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.<eos> Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.<eos> Mr. Gallo, I am so sorry.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?<eos> Actually, it could have.<eos> I guess he could have castrated me at the table.<eos> Last time I introduced dad to a boyfriend, I never heard from the guy again, so...<eos> When I disappear next, ask your dad where my body's buried, just as, you know, like, a courtesy to my mom.<eos> Martin, I know he's tough.<eos> But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I gave her the heads-up I was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.<eos> No, no. This is... This is Jimothy.<eos> - He's my new roommate.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> Jimothy. Like Timothy with a "J."<eos> No.<eos> Jimothy, this is Mr. Gallo, Ginnie's dad.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Ex-girlfriend's father.<eos> Do you have the bong?

I...<eos> I don't know what you mean?<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.<eos> Is that... is that...<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I was... yeah, I was looking earlier. I just didn't... I was curious.<eos> You're giving me a real stressy vibe, man.

Is he giving you a stressy vibe?<eos> - You're not wrong.<eos> I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.<eos> You can come.<eos> I thought... you know, I thought we said, we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with...<eos> With the cops...<eos> So I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?<eos> No, it's cool.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Did you get my message?
- She, um... Martin, hi.<eos> They... they're looking for Ginnie, babe.<eos> Um, this is Ginnie's dad. Hi.<eos> I'm Roberta.<eos> So great to finally meet you.<eos> - Jack, right?<eos> - That would be Ginnie's stepfather. Right.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> She's talked a lot about you, too.<eos> Did you invite them in?
Water or kombucha? Twig tea?<eos> I have some nice biodynamic wine.<eos> Don't bother. Please, we're just looking for Ginnie.<eos> - Martin said she was staying here.<eos> - She was staying here.<eos> She left about three weeks ago.<eos> Did you try her cell? I can try her cell.<eos> Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.<eos> Man, sounds to me like she's living off the grid, you know?<eos> Martin, was Ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know? - Like one of those preppers or...

You, might want to try the cafe.<eos> Martin knows where it is.<eos> - She's probably working there.<eos> - The cafe?<eos> - Great. Martin?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, okay. All right.<eos> Well, thanks, guys.<eos> Thank you for... That.<eos> Why do you have to attack me? Why do you have to be so hostile?
Tell me when to turn.<eos> - This is where my daughter works?<eos> - Yeah. It's... It's not that bad.<eos> They got a little gallery now.<eos> It was Ginnie's idea, actually.<eos> Really turned the place around.<eos> Two dudes just came in here.<eos> - You know this one?<eos> - Yeah. Tracy.<eos> You're the slut.

- Oh, Mumbai!<eos> - Yeah. Ever been?<eos> - No, no. But I-I'd like to.<eos> It's a shithole.<eos> Well, I guess I can, cross that off the list then.<eos> - I need to take this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Barry. Talk to me.<eos> - Hey, Lizzie.<eos> - Martin. What are you doing here?
- I need to take this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Barry. Talk to me.<eos> - Hey, Lizzie.<eos> - Martin. What are you doing here?<eos> Please, please do not fuck with my yoga buzz. No.<eos> No... I was just wondering... I've been looking for Ginnie.<eos> - Martin, Martin, Martin... - No, no, no.<eos> Martin, you've got to get over this Ginnie thing.<eos> She's moving on. You should, too.

Okay, Barry, stop talking.<eos> I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.<eos> - Bibola?<eos> What's that?<eos> - It's a restaurant, Martin.<eos> It's the new, hot big restaurant in West Hollywood.<eos> Fuck!<eos> My yoga buzz is gone now.<eos> - Okay. Thanks for the info, Lizzie.<eos> - Martin, you should know that...

- You're an asshole.<eos> - Stop talking, Barry.<eos> Just do your fucking job, okay?<eos> She said Ginnie's working at a restaurant in West Hollywood.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Frank. Wow.<eos> - Kelly.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's been a minute.<eos> Are you in town for a visit?
Let's go.<eos> - Frank. Wow.<eos> - Kelly.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's been a minute.<eos> Are you in town for a visit?<eos> Yeah, just popped in.<eos> You look good.<eos> I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.<eos> You look good.

I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.<eos> You look good.<eos> How long are you in town for?<eos> Very briefly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're late to meet my daughter, so...<eos> I won't keep you, then.<eos> Well, it was good to see you.<eos> - You, too.<eos> - So if you end up sticking around, - give me a shout.
- Two taliskers, neat.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - See anything?<eos> - No.<eos> There you go.<eos> - I think I...<eos> - Good.<eos> - Hey, Megan.<eos> - My God. Martin! - Megan!<eos> - What the fuck are you doing here?

Martin! - Megan!<eos> - What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> - I'm looking for Ginnie, actually.<eos> - Martin, you gotta get over it.<eos> - It's so sad, like... - No, I'm...<eos> I'm over it.<eos> It's just her dad is looking for her, actually.<eos> Do you... do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
- Ginnie!<eos> Get over it, Martin!<eos> - Wow.<eos> - She's very drunk.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Lois. - Right?<eos> - Yeah. Martin, right? - Yes!<eos> Thank you!<eos> - Sorry?<eos> I just... Have you seen Ginnie by any chance?
- Sorry?<eos> I just... Have you seen Ginnie by any chance?<eos> - I'm sorry. Who?<eos> - Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.<eos> - Yeah. No, I haven't seen her.<eos> - Sorry. It's so loud in here. I know.<eos> It's unbelievably loud in here.<eos> I feel like I'm screaming at you.<eos> It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.<eos> Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.<eos> - Is she missing or something?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - This one's on the house, all right?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You know, you ought to talk to that guy she's seeing.<eos> - She's seeing somebody?<eos> - Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.<eos> - They met here, I think.<eos> - You seen him lately? No.

No.<eos> I haven't seen either of 'em. Just a second.<eos> - So do you come here often?
Well, Dennis is a friend, so...<eos> Man.<eos> I know this guy!<eos> He's an idiot!<eos> Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go. Okay.<eos> And if I do play that show, maybe I'll see you there.<eos> - Yeah. Good to see you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye-bye.<eos> Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?
- Yeah. Good to see you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye-bye.<eos> Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?<eos> Yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.<eos> - I don't know what your problem is with me.<eos> - I told you guys about Marty here, right?<eos> He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.<eos> It's hilarious.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, you know, you look like a... a rapist...

- Um, I... I don't know who that is.<eos> - Bri-baby.<eos> I'm so outta here.<eos> And if he doesn't like it, he can kiss my ass.<eos> - Is this my car? - Well, no. - This my car?<eos> I don't think it's such a good idea for you to be driving right now, Megan.<eos> Well, maybe it's not such a good idea for your face - to be a dick right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Mr. Gallo...<eos> - Where do you live, Megan?

Because we're trying to drive you home.<eos> I don't want to go home. I want to go to the par-tay.<eos> Are you still on Sweetzer?<eos> I want to go to the party so I can blow Dan Franklin.<eos> Let's get her home, for Dan Franklin's sake.<eos> Yeah, I think she's still on Sweetzer.<eos> It's just a right at the next light.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, slow down, Barry.<eos> What the hell do you mean they're backing out?

- Where are you taking me?<eos> All right. - There you go.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> Move just a little bit.<eos> Drink this. Megan...<eos> Drink this. It's gonna make you feel better.<eos> - I'm not thirsty.<eos> - It'll make you feel better, Megan.<eos> Drink it.<eos> We can make out if you want.

And he's ripped, apparently.<eos> So he goes to the gym, frequents nightclubs, likes to throw his money around, maybe act like a big shot.<eos> Sounds like an asshole.<eos> - This is what I'm saying.<eos> I smell a rat here.<eos> What about with Martin?<eos> Did you smell a rat when you met him?<eos> No, no rat. Field mouse, maybe.<eos> - Field mouse. - Hah hah. He's right.<eos> You're a field mouse, bro.
You guys want some?<eos> Hey, we should do these together, go camping.<eos> Joshua tree.<eos> You should probably put those away, like, now.<eos> Wait.<eos> Japanese paper.<eos> Hey, man. Aw, man. Dude.<eos> Gary, you dumbass, drug-addled son of a bitch, I could kiss you right now.<eos> Okay, but we should wait 'til after we eat the 'shrooms.<eos> Are you kidding me?

Not my Gare.<eos> My Gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?<eos> He's more of a call you from jail at 4:00 A.M. Because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.<eos> Honey, your aura's turning, like, dark red now.<eos> Here's the drill.<eos> You're gonna stay here until your arraignment...

- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Nice work, guys.<eos> I love you!<eos> All right, you two.<eos> Looks like your lawyer has saved your ass.<eos> Ginnie.<eos> - What the hell, dad? - I know.<eos> Look, I was worried.<eos> You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.

It was really nice to see you, though.<eos> Martin!<eos> Look, Ginnie, I'm truly...<eos> - No, no, you don't have to apologize.<eos> I know how persuasive my dad can be.<eos> Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy?<eos> I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.<eos> I'll try.<eos> How are you?<eos> You know...

Why is the sky blue?<eos> - Jimothy...<eos> - I'm trying to beat this level, dawg.<eos> - Have some respect.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> Well, I'm busy.<eos> And after I beat this level, I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.<eos> Hey, it's time for you to move now.<eos> Get your shit, and go.<eos> You're 30 days past due on rent, so consider it an eviction.

Thanks for coming, Frank.<eos> That's nice stuff up there.<eos> Seriously, really, really good.<eos> I enjoyed it. Thanks.<eos> I thought you were...<eos> Had to be in Geneva.<eos> I figured I'd stick around here, spend a little time with my daughter.<eos> - You want a beer?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You know, Martin, you went to the mat for me in a big way.

I won't forget it.<eos> - Looks like you got a fan there.<eos> - Who?<eos> Lois?<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> Martin, would you please open your eyes?<eos> - That girl is clearly here for you.<eos> - We met up before the show.<eos> - Did you, now? - Yeah.<eos> You were right about that whole body-language thing.
Yeah, I...<eos> Martin, would you please open your eyes?<eos> - That girl is clearly here for you.<eos> - We met up before the show.<eos> - Did you, now? - Yeah.<eos> You were right about that whole body-language thing.<eos> Look at you.<eos> I am impressed.<eos> - I should go say hi before the second set. - I think you should.<eos> - Are you gonna be...
For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother, here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground.<eos> Earth to Earth ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<eos> In sure and certain hope of the Resurrection.<eos> We will change our vile body... according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.<eos> Sir?<eos> Mr. Delaney, is it?<eos> Sir?<eos> - James Delaney, is it?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - They said you were dead.

My God.<eos> Perhaps by ship and by carriage.<eos> Hm? Come here.<eos> Ah!<eos> Where's your propriety, Brace?<eos> Servant and master?<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why? Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.

For being a pirate, you vagabond!
But a broken down, bent, buckled old butler will have to be sufficient.<eos> You look the same.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Not tea, brandy.<eos> Two glasses.<eos> Sir?<eos> Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you. To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?

If you're looking for money, those accounts are ten years old.<eos> Where are my father's inventories and his shipping logs?<eos> He burnt them all.<eos> The only reason these accounts survived was because I hid them in case the taxman came knocking.<eos> That was delivered at 6 AM this morning by a servant of Mr. Robert Thoyt.<eos> Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?

Where did you get the key?<eos> This key?<eos> This is my father's key. Horace Delaney.<eos> Shit.<eos> Yes, shit.<eos> Your father stopped coming. It was empty.<eos> It was wasted, so close to the docks.<eos> You want tea?<eos> No.<eos> Do you want to fuck?

I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.<eos> Implore is a more feminine word.<eos> And why must you be a woman to him?
The offer of ã50 should be conditional on him leaving England.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if he does not leave England, I will kill him.<eos> Why?<eos> That is a very good question.<eos> Why would I feel that way about him, after meeting him only once?<eos> The son of the same father as the woman I love...<eos> Why does a soldier know that a nigger bowing low has a dagger in his shoe and is reaching for it?<eos> Delaney is nothing more than a nigger now.<eos> You know that, don't you?

Tell you what... You get me an address, and I will get you payment in the form of a banker's draft.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Good day.<eos> You don't even ask how your own blood fares.<eos> If you don't approve of me steadying my nerves with Madeira, then perhaps you should consult the directory of the Royal College of Physicians, see you know many others of them will agree to carry out this kind of work.<eos> I intend to mix the contents of his stomach with potassium oxide, calcium oxide and nitric acid.<eos> I'll know in 20 minutes.<eos> Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.

No-one is listening.<eos> He's meeting with the East India.<eos> Apparently, they're happy to deal with the devil and leave us penniless.<eos> The letter, it seemed, did no good.<eos> He was never one to be told.<eos> Well, we have legal rights, and it's time that savage was made aware.<eos> - I know he's your brother but... - Half-brother.<eos> he leaves me no choice.<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - Good. I'm tired of these empty threats you keep bandying around.

I'm tired of these empty threats you keep bandying around.<eos> Empty?<eos> I'm your husband and you are my wife.<eos> And I will protect our interests by whatever means necessary.<eos> And as for him, well, he should have stayed where he belongs, in the jungle, dancing naked and screwing wild pigs, and his slaves in their chains.<eos> He will leave soon.<eos> You're quite right, he doesn't belong in this world.
The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.<eos> Now, why don't you just open the fucking envelope?<eos> Good day.<eos> Well...<eos> The son is as unstable as the father.<eos> Perhaps the rumours about him are true.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.<eos> It is more than ten years since you went away, and at the time I was grateful that you had decided to leave England, for both of our sakes.
When you first came back, you told me you loved me.
Atticus!<eos> Good boy.<eos> Wilton!<eos> Pettifer!<eos> Ah, fuck it!<eos> Gentlemen, there are things I need you to do.<eos> Are you going to teach me, then?<eos> Yeah, go on, go on, hit the ball.<eos> Swing for it, then.<eos> You're not holding it tight enough!
Just do it.<eos> Should we await Mr Pettifer's return?<eos> No, we should not await Mr Pettifer's return.<eos> Just fuck off, will you?<eos> Come on, out.<eos> We need to burn this.<eos> Atticus, I want an explanation.<eos> Helga, get in!<eos> Come on!<eos> It's all right. You've nothing to fear.
Temple was on the foreshore.<eos> He saw James sleeping in the mud and Winter lay down beside him.<eos> He then saw a man arrive in a boat.<eos> "Moving like a ghost," Wasn't he?<eos> It was this ghost that killed your Winter, as she slept.<eos> The man then got back in the boat, Temple followed him along the foreshore, where he was met by someone on the other side.<eos> They were in a carriage, like the one you just came out of.<eos> The East India Company?<eos> Is that the truth, little boy?<eos> You know what happens to little boys that lie, don't you?
James Delaney also says to tell Colonnade that you do, indeed, have a leaky ship.<eos> But he's found the leak and will fix it, as long as YOU cooperate.<eos> James?<eos> What are you to him?<eos> I'm Mrs Delaney.<eos> His wife.<eos> No.<eos> His mother.<eos> *Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's*<eos> *You owe me five farthings, say the bells of St Martin's*

Yes?<eos> From Mr Delaney.<eos> 'I'm planning to journey to heaven, James.<eos> 'I've realised the truth.<eos> 'My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.<eos> 'The River Thames will take me to God.<eos> 'Death is just the turning of a key in a lock.<eos> 'Whether God will accept me is another matter, 'perhaps my husband will have spoken of my betrayal.<eos> 'Or perhaps my feelings for you, 'unforgiveable feelings for you, 'will mean the Thames will take me to a different place.<eos> 'Whatever my destination, if you survive your recklessness, 'please, keep some part of my soul inside your own.'
You present yourself as an agent of the free states of America, like a good little sheep.<eos> But long since, you've been dangled in front of the King of England by the East India Company.<eos> Now you're scrabbling, desperate. Pulling your wool over everybody's eyes.<eos> Possibly even your own.<eos> Does it even matter?<eos> No.<eos> No-one in this city has only one master.<eos> Pen.<eos> I do.<eos> 'James, you came back.

I just received a note.<eos> Mr Delaney said he had left his account of the sinking of the Cornwallis and the account of the East India clerk, Godfrey.<eos> It said I would find it in his room.<eos> Which one is his room?<eos> His room is the attic.<eos> The one looking out to the river.<eos> Justice.<eos> Maria?<eos> Yes.<eos> You always had such beautiful fingers.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother?<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.<eos> 'Now he is returned 'and Delaney's will leaves him everything, including Nootka.'<eos> Britain and the United States are currently at war.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I can give you whatever you like - boys, girls.
For what bloody purpose?<eos> For the purpose of staying alive right now.<eos> You may choose to leave my services if you wish, Mr Brace.<eos> What is it about you bloody mad Delaneys?<eos> Hang it in the meat locker.<eos> Just keep the powder out of the steam.<eos> Bloody madhouse again!<eos> While we're on the subject of housekeeping, I mean to have a word with you about food.<eos> You're hungry? No.<eos> Toward the end, you said my father rarely ate.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Am I the only one in this company with a brain?<eos> They got to him first.<eos> Either in Africa or on the journey back to London.<eos> One of their agents approached him, briefed him, gave him money and secured his services.<eos> Who, who did, sir?<eos> The fucking Americans!<eos> Atticus!<eos> James Delaney.<eos> Well, look at you.

Sit down.<eos> Give me back my horse.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw?<eos> For my files - my book about the world.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw in Africa?<eos> An elephant.<eos> How tall was it?<eos> Atticus, give me my horse back.<eos> 100 foot high, some of them, I've heard.<eos> Atticus, you stole my horse and you left your name... so what do you want?

I'd say he wasn't East India.<eos> More from up Leadenhall.<eos> I could tell by the cut of his jib.<eos> So, how much will you give me for not killing your father?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, £15... £15.<eos> ..and the return of your horse.<eos> I will give you £15, minus the heels on my boots... and I will need your eyes and ears from now on as well.<eos> Yeah, well, the enemies you're stirring up, James, you'll be needing them, my boy.
You sail this close to my nose, a kind of classless rebels, and you show me red crosses.<eos> Your Highness, they will run out of powder.<eos> And I have run out of fucking patience.<eos> Tell the Admiralty, although the gossips say that all Prinny wants is flowers and waltzes, in truth, Prinny also demands the American ships be sunk, the survivors hanged, the bodies of the drowned nailed to the church walls of Ireland<eos> Do you want me to write this down?<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> It's, um, from the East India.<eos> Fuck them as well.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Who are you?
What the fuck is this?<eos> It's, um, from the East India.<eos> Fuck them as well.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Winter.<eos> Miss Winter. No, just Winter.<eos> Just Winter.<eos> I live with the whores, but I'm a virgin.<eos> Why are you following me?
Miss Winter. No, just Winter.<eos> Just Winter.<eos> I live with the whores, but I'm a virgin.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> To save your life.<eos> Mistress Helga gave information to a man with a silver tooth.<eos> I spy on her.<eos> From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.<eos> She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.<eos> How old are you?
Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.<eos> Tell me about this man with the silver tooth...<eos> Winter.<eos> I can show you where he's moored, if you want.<eos> He sleeps on this ship alone?<eos> He takes a particular girl abroad and does mean things, but there's no-one else.<eos> Are you tricking me?
Are you tricking me?<eos> No.<eos> They say you was in Africa.<eos> What is it like?<eos> Is everybody naked?<eos> I want to go to America.<eos> Promise to take me to America one day.<eos> New York or Boston?<eos> The current here heads for Gravesend.<eos> You know navigation.
Stay.<eos> The very same smell.<eos> Same smell as what?<eos> As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> It may be written on deerskin.<eos> So what you're saying is...<eos> "Brace, do you have any idea where I can find ma ain death warrant?"
Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.<eos> And hashish, enough to ease my grieving when the East India Company slit your throat, which, of course, they will.<eos> You have appointments today.<eos> Breakfast will be out in half an hour... if you can contrive to stay alive that long.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was turning out to be a long, drawn-out process.<eos> I'd benefit from a period of reflection.<eos> Do you have a girl here called Winter?

No?<eos> I would kill for a mulatto - the Danish pay double.<eos> I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.
Am I wrong?<eos> I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.<eos> And whorehouses are full of secrets, and secrets, to me, are weapons.<eos> I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.<eos> It's my first condition.<eos> I need to know where Mr Silver Tooth is hiding.<eos> Your new friend.<eos> Do you know him?
I have letters.<eos> Other than letters?<eos> Well, what kind of documents?<eos> Well, proof will come from pen and ink.<eos> I will dispatch an enquiry to the Trinity Church in Dublin and request a personal account from the priest.<eos> Until then, I suggest you two refrain from any further contact with each other.<eos> Well, I have no love for the theatre.<eos> And I spend very little time in German brothels.<eos> Was he in there?<eos> The man - did you see him in the room?

It was him that came to the door and was indeed in the room.<eos> He was the one who declared your legacy a death sentence.<eos> You, er...<eos> You want him to fall into the river, James?
This widow will have sole claim on Nootka in the event of James Delaney's death.<eos> An event which may be imminent.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to London violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.<eos> Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't. What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.<eos> Because, otherwise, you would've come to me and made very loud declarations.

The assassin we sent to kill Delaney is dead.<eos> The British want you dead.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.<eos> I will cede sovereignty of Nootka Sound to whichever nation offers me their monopoly.<eos> All the tea in China.<eos> As Horace Delaney's widow, I also own half of the trading post at Nootka Sound.<eos> And I believe Nootka is of value to the King.<eos> If you are in contact with the King, then you are already in grave danger.<eos> I hope I can trust you to keep the secrets of the past buried.

So... doesn't that mean the game is up, James?<eos> No, it's just begun.<eos> What else?<eos> The hand was raised.<eos> They talked about gunpowder.<eos> Pettifer said if Delaney Trading Company wanted to trade with the Indians at Nootka, the only merchandise you could possibly use would be gunpowder.<eos> Wilton pointed out that in times of war, the production of gunpowder is controlled by the Crown.<eos> You will not be granted a licence to purchase.<eos> Your name is already on a blacklist.<eos> You will not get a single grain anywhere in England.
Use your hand to protect your eyes.<eos> The vessel is often shattered to atoms, by sheer force.<eos> Terrific!<eos> Magnificent!<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> I cancelled my appointment. Blamed a headache.<eos> Exposure to excitable chemical fumes, I imagine.<eos> As a doctor, I ought to make sure you're fully recovered.<eos> Something in your eye.<eos> Do you have a husband?
I'm actually very tired, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Your conspiracies have made it a very tiring day.<eos> I'll fix that.<eos> Sleep on it.<eos> Deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever.<eos> Amen.<eos> John Company and the King are back at war.<eos> The resolution again recedes.<eos> Fuck him!<eos> You woke me.

Yes, but my theories are always right.<eos> As far as I know, there is only one place where one can find - refined saltpetre.<eos> - Two.<eos> The bat caves of Burma, where the bat shit refines itself, or the warehouse of the East India Company at Wapping Wall.<eos> Except, they're not selling, at the moment.<eos> War going on. Two wars, actually.<eos> Or have we already won one of them?<eos> You're hired, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> And as for your saltpetre, I will get it for you.<eos> Who are you?
When was the last time you set foot inside a church, sir?<eos> The lady asked me to wake her because she had a costume fitting.<eos> I guessed you wouldn't want her going out.<eos> No, the lady is free to come and go as she pleases.<eos> The Crown will protect her from the Company. And the Company will protect her from the Crown.<eos> - And you are the joint in the seesaw.<eos> By the way, I found your red roses in the mud when I threw out the oyster shells.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Who the hell's what?<eos> Brace, do not believe that I will not know when you reseal my letters.
- This came from the same post?<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> The Americans. Wanting a place on the seesaw.<eos> Well, it is an invitation for two.<eos> Miss Bow?<eos> Do you dance?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where's Helga?<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Winter said you looked impressed. I am.
Miss Bow?<eos> Do you dance?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where's Helga?<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Winter said you looked impressed. I am.<eos> Oysters mask the smell of sex.<eos> You like that. Mm.<eos> Yes, I might have a use for that, actually.<eos> You may need to bring a couple of girls to the Dolphin with you.

Judging by the horror on the faces of the ladies, you are known.<eos> Yes, and judging by the shame on the face of some of the men, so are you.<eos> Oh, if only I had been a whore, I might have been as rich as Countess Musgrove, who I presume is that creature.<eos> Hello. Hello. Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Not hello.<eos> - Who the hell is that?<eos> - I've no idea.<eos> And who the hell was that?<eos> - Why are you here?

Ah, but it is a bit unexpected, isn't it?<eos> It's unusual.<eos> I knew that when you saw me, you would come to me and I realise that is how it always is.<eos> You always drive me... It is a bit unexpected that we were both invited, is it not?<eos> That we were invited, both together.<eos> And if they invited us both, then they probably know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Our American friends.<eos> You feel me, don't you, when I break in? - No.

You feel me.<eos> And I could come more often, but I spare you.<eos> Then spare me.<eos> I went to a doctor, he took me to a priest who had been to a mission in Africa.<eos> - Yes, what did he say?<eos> - He said that you visit as animals.
This time, we will be more artful. Hm!<eos> You will need to be.<eos> Your own sister.<eos> Oh, goodness!<eos> Is he here?<eos> Is this real?<eos> Why's he here? Is it him?<eos> You should get away.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> You fu... you fucked her!
You should get away.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> You fu... you fucked her!<eos> He fucked her. He fucked her!<eos> He fu...<eos> You need some air. James.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> James?<eos> James?<eos> You call this thing James?

So, how did it resolve itself?<eos> Did you both see sense?<eos> No.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Between the eyes.<eos> And a host of devils flew out of the hole in his head and down the river.<eos> In that event, it would be potatoes, wouldn't it?<eos> Simple sustenance.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Before you drink any more, could you tell me what happened?
The Company can cause me a lot of difficulties, but only the King can have me hanged.<eos> The Crown will choose to make a deal.<eos> So I will not hang.<eos> Look, I'm very happy to admit that I don't want James Delaney to die.<eos> But can you also admit that you don't want James Delaney to die?<eos> You'll get me my trunk today.<eos> That's your business.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't want James Delaney to die either.<eos> Who are you?
Check the barrels! All of them!<eos> There's got to be something here.<eos> Search everywhere!<eos> Move!<eos> Come on!<eos> Search the boat. Come on!<eos> Get them off!<eos> Come on!<eos> Check below.<eos> You, check the bilges.
Come on!<eos> Check below.<eos> You, check the bilges.<eos> - There's nothing.<eos> - Well, it can't have just vanished.<eos> What's this?<eos> Cellar empty.<eos> Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.

Sit.<eos> Sit there.<eos> I haven't told that boy anything.<eos> I didn't think it safe.<eos> The sacks of saltpetre in the barn were stolen.<eos> Why burden him?<eos> They were stolen from the Honourable East India Company.<eos> All right?<eos> Now anybody who knows of its whereabouts but does not report it is liable to hang.<eos> So, you are now one of us.
I know which one of you it is.<eos> And I want you to know that there will be no place for that man on my ship when we sail to the New World.<eos> Because he will be of no use to me.<eos> He will be of no use.<eos> For he will have no thumb.<eos> I am inside your heads, gentlemen.<eos> Always.<eos> £2 for broken doors and smashed windows.<eos> Damn soldiers!<eos> You owe me Delaney!
Ready?<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing here, at whatever the hell time of night it is?<eos> I thought I heard an explosion.<eos> No.<eos> All is well.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?
You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> He is, isn't he?<eos> They have your name, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> They have your name, and you will be first on the list of their conspirators.<eos> How do they know so much?<eos> Get the chlorate.<eos> Yes?<eos> I will get you men.<eos> James...<eos> You said his name!

Get him out.<eos> I want him out.<eos> Out!<eos> Get him out.<eos> Out!<eos> That's right, good girl.<eos> Spit him out, spit, spit, spit him out...<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> You need a priest, my dear.
Now, you take your coat off, go into your office and you write to him.<eos> Offer him "full and unfettered co-operation" on behalf of the Honourable East India.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.<eos> There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.<eos> He's come from the river.<eos> He's in the garden.<eos> If it's someone you fuck, please check if he came from east or west.

Stop! Stop!<eos> You see those blemishes?<eos> It is the evil coming to the surface.<eos> It's almost done, my love.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Can we untie her now?<eos> Leave her a few moments.<eos> Let her reflect... and recover.<eos> Will you come to bed?
Ingredients for making gunpowder stolen from under the Company's noses.<eos> Failure to secure His Majesty's gunpowder against the enemy is a criminal offence.<eos> It might be more effective if we went after Sir Stuart himself.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves and were complicit in the deaths of those slaves.<eos> The bellmen and the newspapers tell me there's a new source of prime grade powder in town.<eos> Our guns will fall silent in ten days.<eos> We need the powder in eight. I need more gunpowder.<eos> You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> - You are now one of us.
That's why your father had her committed to Bedlam. To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son.<eos> Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.<eos> She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?
Go.<eos> Gentlemen, I want you to pay attention, because all our lives will depend upon it.<eos> This harmless-looking powder... is called chlorate.<eos> And on its own, it is harmless. But when it is added to the sulphur and charcoal in our vats, it is anything but.<eos> Think of it as like adding a baby to a marriage.<eos> All was ordered and calm and now there is this thing that demands attention.<eos> Stops you sleeping, belches, farts, screams... and she's going to make this whole process louder and wilder, more insane, more impractical... and the only thing that will stop this entire enterprise from erupting in a giant explosion the size of Mauritius is this... and dedication.<eos> Because, from now on, until the powder is complete, we have to stir.<eos> Continuously!<eos> You.

I heard one about an actress he keeps locked in his cellar,<eos> - enjoys the beatings...<eos> An actress... who enjoys walking with a man with human flesh in his teeth.<eos> You know, you can even buy a song about Delaney now. In Covent Garden, for a penny.<eos> I-I'll return when you're sober...<eos> It's about a cannibal who plans to eat the Prince Regent.<eos> So it can only be about Delaney.<eos> Forgive me, I was... just dressing.<eos> He's been gone two days...<eos> And she thought you might know where he is, because you are his sister.
Zilpha!<eos> Zilpha, open this door now!<eos> Zilpha!<eos> Australia!<eos> I swear it. I swear it.<eos> A position in Sydney, Australia. Ports and harbour assessor.<eos> And the jurisdiction of an assizes. And administration of felons through the docks.<eos> Never lock your door or draw your robe against me again, for I am an assessor!<eos> I applied for the position three months ago.<eos> Here. Read it. Won't you?
All fires extinguished.<eos> Gently, gently, gently, gentlemen.<eos> Have the greatest of respect for the inhabitant of this coffin.<eos> Famously volatile.<eos> Given to explosive fits of rage.<eos> May he rest in peace until he's reignited with his Saviour.<eos> Slow, slow, slow over the potted roads.<eos> The chlorate is still there, it's just sleeping.<eos> "For the purpose of preventing contagion." Hm?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.

You tell me one thing that isn't just a matter of time.<eos> They say you're going to sell the gun powder to the Republicans.<eos> Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.<eos> If the Prince genuinely thought I was going to start a revolution, I would be in the Tower.<eos> He's not a safeguard.<eos> If Crown and Company solve their little dispute, they will crush you between them.<eos> What did my sister say?<eos> Zilpha?<eos> What have you done?

In the bedroom.<eos> Are you sure he's dead?<eos> Quite dead.<eos> Sit there.<eos> - In the bedroom?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When did I, um...?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You stay here.
- Yes.<eos> When did I, um...?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will tell Brace to arrange a carriage.<eos> By the time you get home, the body will be gone.<eos> Home?<eos> Yes.<eos> - You are sending me home?
A farmer, called Ibbotson, confessed to the priest at St Mary's church, Greyhound Road, Hendon, that he had allowed the devil into his life.<eos> He received absolution from the priest and, this morning, the priest received his reward from the Honourable East India Company.<eos> A reward in the sum of £25.<eos> Gentlemen... we have Delaney's factory.<eos> James!<eos> James. James. Catastrophe.<eos> The farmer Ibbotson took confession...<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - James... No. No.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
It is in fucking pieces.<eos> I swear, I swear I didn't know.<eos> Now report.<eos> War has begun.<eos> Sorry about your news.<eos> Marshall.<eos> I need a ship.<eos> And I need to ensure no-one else betrays me.<eos> Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?

Leave this body where it will be found.<eos> You can keep the heart.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> The devil's here.<eos> Go get some sleep.<eos> I don't need to sleep.<eos> I need... a ship.<eos> Maybe have a fuck first.<eos> Find a ship tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you find a captain and you take him upstairs and slit his throat, and I will take his ship?
Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> Brace, what's the matter?<eos> The truth.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> You are now one of us.

What a surprise.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley?<eos> Miss Bow.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A bastard.<eos> I thought, in all your charity, you might extend some sustenance and some shelter to this poor, unfortunate boy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Robert.<eos> It's Robert.<eos> You know James Delaney, do you?
Amen. I know you didn't do it.<eos> And how would you know that?<eos> - I very well may have. - Mm.<eos> You might have done.<eos> But I do know you cared for her.<eos> You were kind to her. She told me.<eos> The boy Robert's arrived.<eos> You OK?<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you know Winter? Was she your friend?
- I very well may have. - Mm.<eos> You might have done.<eos> But I do know you cared for her.<eos> You were kind to her. She told me.<eos> The boy Robert's arrived.<eos> You OK?<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you know Winter? Was she your friend?<eos> No. No, no, no! No, wait!<eos> Do you think that this will be enough to sink her?
I will keep her soul.<eos> There's no certainty it was James that did it.<eos> There's no certainty that he did not.<eos> I'm getting scared, James.<eos> Too many bodies in the river.<eos> Can I sleep under your house tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Go away, I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> James!<eos> You're among them now, aren't you?
In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?
Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> When you first came back, you told me you loved me.
- But you don't think. Do you?<eos> I know you.<eos> I know your nature. I know you.<eos> No.<eos> I believed once that we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We are not.<eos> We are.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Perhaps you should thank your God for that.
No.<eos> I believed once that we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We are not.<eos> We are.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Perhaps you should thank your God for that.<eos> No.<eos> No, James.<eos> No. No, you can't do this.
So what's so urgent I had to dismount from a porky little Chinese?<eos> This is where they kept my mother.<eos> Something for your book.<eos> The lioness will fiercely protect her cubs, regardless of the consequences.<eos> Even if that means her certain death.<eos> Helga.<eos> Is that who you mean?<eos> That woman will betray us.<eos> She knows about the division with the Americans.<eos> That's high treason! That's you, me and my lot feeding the ravens of London for at least a month.

Where is he?<eos> They would not be denied, sir.<eos> This is the Prince's house.<eos> You should have dragged them out on their arses.<eos> Stuart Strange is a Knight of the Realm, I could not lay<eos> - a hand on him.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> We have some rather good news... for British patriots everywhere.<eos> James!<eos> James! You are betrayed!
Godders, no gin.<eos> Your account of the sinking of the Cornwallis changes everything.<eos> Is there no world in which I could offer my account anonymously?<eos> A Royal Commission cannot accept anonymous testimony.<eos> I would be reporting things said from a raised hand... Yes. ...by the most senior directors of the East India Company.<eos> Yes.<eos> How long have you worked for the East India Company?<eos> I have only been clerk for 12 years.<eos> I have no idea how many years it was going on for...<eos> No, but you were present during the meeting when Sir Stuart concealed the facts about the sinking of the Cornwallis.

This is ridiculous.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'm being followed.<eos> The Crown have soldiers searching for me everywhere, so it ends here.<eos> Here?<eos> Yes.<eos> When?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you just going to sit? !
James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account...<eos> he will secure it and keep you safe.<eos> Safe? Safe?<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.<eos> James, for God's sake, you don't have a bloody ship!
His unearthly potions... alter perceptions.<eos> The ducks will be flying.<eos> All the coaches to Bath and Southampton<eos> - are being searched, Your Highness.<eos> - For what?<eos> For whom? We have no idea who they are, who they pretend to be.<eos> It's been 12 hours!<eos> He will break.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Goddamn it, where are you?
He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> Nootka was my mother's tribe.<eos> This small piece of land will be incredibly valuable to the Americans.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.
And when you sit there with that same look of defiance on your face, I will ask you the same old question...<eos> For what do you risk your life?<eos> Can you loosen up these bindings so that I may move?<eos> Get up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Bill, what are you doing?<eos> - Here, take this.<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> No reason we can't laugh at each other just cos we're now partners.<eos> I didn't say that you were my partner.

The word along the Wapping Wall is you cut up an assassin and ate his giblets.<eos> Did you bring me my guns?<eos> Don't trust the snake.<eos> 10-bore Richardson Man Stoppers.<eos> Same power as a musket but you can hold one in each hand.<eos> Good.<eos> Better, better.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So if we ain't partners, what are we?<eos> Well, I'm a merchant, you're my victualler.
Better, better.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So if we ain't partners, what are we?<eos> Well, I'm a merchant, you're my victualler.<eos> You can also be my ferryman.<eos> I can't use the roads... not for now at least.<eos> You see the heathen?<eos> He's my brother-in-law.<eos> He says the best bit of a man to eat is this. It's tender.<eos> Did you bring me salt beef?
Did you bring me salt beef?<eos> - Pork.<eos> - No.<eos> Fresh from a sloop from somewhere cold.<eos> - Short notice. - We don't eat pig!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> The stuff he's brought has been on the dock for ages.<eos> Yes, probably, but I trust him, so please pay him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who are you?
And every scratch and claim staked will be cited as legal precedent.<eos> And not only can we not resolve this disaster by killing Delaney, it is now in our urgent interest to keep the bastard alive.<eos> Get four nails and a wooden board and a man called Solomon Coop into this room by tomorrow at noon.<eos> Can you manage that?<eos> By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.<eos> And if that sickly youth on the doorstep is there to protect you from East India assassins, know that by 2:00 AM he's easily distracted by whores.<eos> Well, you needn't worry about the East India Company.<eos> No need to worry about the Crown... any longer.<eos> For now I'm only in danger from the Americans but I reasoned that they are the lesser of the three adversaries, wouldn't you agree?

And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Teach me about magic.<eos> I want to be a wolf, too, or a bird so I can fly.<eos> The bird on your neck...<eos> I know what it is...<eos> The Sankofa.<eos> Now, you go home to Helga... because you are not safe here.
Did she make it?<eos> What mark?<eos> In the later days she did things... no-one understood.<eos> In the later days, when she wasn't allowed to walk the streets, nor show her face in public, nor speak in English, nor her savage tongue because she was a mad woman.<eos> - James.<eos> Explain this.<eos> I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You don't speak but you do have answers.

There are boys in the chorus too, Sir, if you prefer.<eos> The unfortunate lady whose father was... somehow killed by Napoleon.<eos> - What of her?<eos> - Her name is Lorna Bow.<eos> Yes, well, I'm afraid Miss Bow is unavailable.<eos> Always or tonight?<eos> Always, Sir, on account of her being a fussy, stuck up bitch, Sir.<eos> I am here on behalf of His Majesty the King.<eos> Give it to Miss Bow and only Miss Bow... on pain of execution.<eos> You bad, bad man.

I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.

Dear, Sister... I am restoring our father's offices<eos> I have registered the Delaney Trading Company with Lloyds of London and I will ready my ship so that when the time is right and the Company has fallen we can leave.<eos> I am accruing a band of loyal servants, none of whom have any value to me beyond the facilitation of this greater good.<eos> When I left England, I was just a boy.<eos> Now I am back, much has changed.<eos> Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.

And she likes it.<eos> Since you came back, our fucking has become almost murderous.<eos> It exhausts us.<eos> To think I have this wicked... wicked thing beneath me and it's my lifelong duty to punish her.<eos> It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.<eos> I came to thank you.<eos> You summoned me.
As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.<eos> I am seldom used.<eos> There is no "they" and there will be a performance.<eos> Are you armed?<eos> Get me a carriage to Drury Lane, would you?<eos> You have to get that woman out of this house or I swear I will kill her and her bloody canary.<eos> Brace... get two carriages.<eos> I see that you're bleeding again.

It seems that jointly we are unable to stop the moon from rising.<eos> Could you fetch some oranges?<eos> I would like some oranges.<eos> Is it the goose or the gander who has bad sauce?<eos> Do you know we can't even afford new china?<eos> So that's your reason for not taking.<eos> The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha... I apologise... that I am not related to you.<eos> But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.<eos> He will pay to be in the room with us while we play.<eos> - Then you were given the wrong name.<eos> Give her to me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Your manager sold me the costume you wore when you played The Little Princess.

Ah, America.<eos> You beacon of composure and proportionate response.

The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.<eos> I'm gonna leave you two be. I'll be...<eos> - I'll be right next door.<eos> - Okay, thank you, Willy.<eos> Well, we're in Paris.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.<eos> Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
Oh, yeah?<eos> - How's Tim?<eos> - Oh, he's good. He's good.<eos> - He sends his love.<eos> - Okay.<eos> He's got a new girlfriend now.<eos> Yeah, I like her.<eos> Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.<eos> Yeah, she's sweet.<eos> You'll like her.

You know, the other day I was calculating the...<eos> I was working out that we've spent less than 30 days a year together for the last eight years.<eos> And... I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.<eos> Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war, I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.<eos> But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?<eos> Yes. Yes, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, and I am... I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't say that to make you feel bad.<eos> - Why are you thinking about it?

Carry that knowledge with you!<eos> Carry it with pride!<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> That's right.<eos> Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Let us pray!<eos> Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.<eos> As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.
Move in.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Clear.<eos> Put that gun up, now.<eos> We're getting ready to move now.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on. Fucking move!<eos> Come on!<eos> Zah, zah, zah, you fuck!
Good job, Cole.<eos> Nice shooting, boys.<eos> - Farrenberg, you hit?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Are you hit?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - Fuck this shit!<eos> - Cole, where the fuck are you going?<eos> - Dude, where the fuck are you going?
- Farrenberg, you hit?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Are you hit?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - Fuck this shit!<eos> - Cole, where the fuck are you going?<eos> - Dude, where the fuck are you going?<eos> - Fuck off! - Corporal, what's happening?<eos> - Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?

So we are in damage control now.<eos> Guys, guys...<eos> Is this really that bad?<eos> I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.<eos> But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?<eos> It's hip.<eos> And you guys...<eos> You guys are the operators.<eos> You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in like a totally non-square way.<eos> Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.
I just meant to put it in the lost and found box that I have in my office.<eos> I, um... I can't pay with this.<eos> Would... would you just hold these items for me till I get back?<eos> - Of course. - All righty.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> - I'll be here.<eos> Your call cannot be accepted at this time.<eos> Please try your call again later<eos> Hi, honey, you're home.

Mm, yeah.<eos> It's not your wallet.<eos> Should I put it in the mailbox?<eos> No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> No, it might belong to someone in the motel.<eos> They'll... They'll come looking for it.<eos> I just don't remember checking this person in.<eos> Huh.<eos> Mother?<eos> Do you ever have the feeling that you've had the same nightmare over and over again but that you can't remember it?

Put it in the safe.<eos> Why would I put it in the safe?<eos> Because someone might come looking for it, and I don't want it to get lost.<eos> You know what your memory's like.

I'm gonna run these inside real quick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, birthday girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> How's my girls?<eos> We're good.<eos> She was a little fussy before, but she's calmed down now.<eos> Oh.<eos> How'd I get so lucky?<eos> You had quite a tour of duty in the lower levels of hell.
Not to sound creepy, but it was a way to make sure that you're both okay.<eos> I saw the baby.<eos> And I had to come.<eos> Man, Norma Louise must be over the moon about this.<eos> What?<eos> I don't really talk to my mom or Norman anymore.<eos> Wh... what happened?<eos> Look, I don't... I don't want to talk about it.<eos> But there's a grandkid involved now.<eos> Where're you staying, Caleb?
I don't really talk to my mom or Norman anymore.<eos> Wh... what happened?<eos> Look, I don't... I don't want to talk about it.<eos> But there's a grandkid involved now.<eos> Where're you staying, Caleb?<eos> Ah, I... I haven't checked in anywhere yet.<eos> The truth is, I'm running a little low on funds.<eos> It took a lot of effort to get over the border.<eos> Um, hoping maybe I could stay here for a few nights until I figure out what I was doing.<eos> Of course you can.
Oh, man.<eos> You want me to put my stuff somewhere?<eos> Oh, yeah, you can just dump your stuff in our room.<eos> It's down the hall.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - It's okay. - It's fine.<eos> Alex?<eos> I was sorry to hear your parole got denied.<eos> I wrote nothing but positive things in my part of the report.<eos> You work hard in your sessions.

Uh, that's my name.<eos> You don't need any other information.<eos> There's the money. May I have a key?<eos> Do let me know if I can do anything else for you,<eos> Mr. David Davidson.<eos> I can't stand not seeing you.<eos> I want you so bad.<eos> Bates Motel.<eos> Norman speaking.<eos> Norman, what are you doing?
Norman speaking.<eos> Norman, what are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay, well, close up the office and come upstairs.<eos> Dinner's gonna get cold.<eos> Okay, Mother.<eos> I'm just coming.<eos> I'll... I'll be right there.<eos> Norman?<eos> Is that you?

No, not that I remember.<eos> Are you sure you didn't order it?<eos> No, I didn't order anything.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> Uh, no... it just sounds like a cleaning product.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> I'm sure the receipt's somewhere in the house.<eos> Come.<eos> I hate having blackouts.<eos> Well, you could start taking your medicine again.
Oh... oh, she's just a woman.<eos> Uh, Madeleine.<eos> I think that's her name.<eos> Yeah, Madeleine Loomis.<eos> Loomis?<eos> That's a funny name.<eos> A name's a name.<eos> And, uh, she's very nice.<eos> She's... she's very artistic.<eos> You know, it's a big job painting this place all by myself, and I just think she'll be helpful.
40, 50, 60?<eos> I'd say late 20s.<eos> Ah.<eos> And what does that mean, "ah"?<eos> Ah, it means "ah,"<eos> as in, "Oh, how about that?"<eos> First of all, Mother, she is married.<eos> Oh, that can be irrelevant.<eos> No, second of all, she works in a store, and I'm going to go in and just buy some paint from her.<eos> So do you really have a problem with that?

Oh, here we go.<eos> Oh, Mother, what is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Well, let me see, for, uh...<eos> Let's see, for starters,<eos> I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?
I literally gave up my life to protect you.<eos> Okay?<eos> To give you a life without trouble.<eos> And we're doing it, right?<eos> We're doing it.<eos> I mean, a mentally ill boy and a dead woman.<eos> We're actually doing it. We're... we have customers.<eos> We... we... we have a life.<eos> I know, and I appreciate it.<eos> Stop saying you appreciate it!
We're actually doing it. We're... we have customers.<eos> We... we... we have a life.<eos> I know, and I appreciate it.<eos> Stop saying you appreciate it!<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> It's not fair to you.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's not that, okay?<eos> It's not... it's not that.<eos> It's that... you... you just can't have other people in your life.
It's that... you... you just can't have other people in your life.<eos> I mean, what are you gonna do? Bring her over?<eos> I mean, where am I gonna go?<eos> In a closet?<eos> I'm not gonna bring her here to dinner.<eos> It's... this... This is absurd.<eos> I know you, Norman.<eos> Come on, I know you.<eos> I know you better than anyone.<eos> You can't have other people in your life, especially women.

Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You get some sleep?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> Hello.<eos> Where's Caleb?<eos> Uh, he went to town to get some... Some bagels and coffee.<eos> Oh, that's sweet.<eos> You know, um, uh...
The truth is, Em...<eos> Caleb came up with a bunch of money to help pay for your transplant.<eos> He did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.<eos> Dylan.<eos> He didn't want me to tell you, and I...<eos> I never wanted to tell you.<eos> It's... but...<eos> You know, I feel like we're the only family that he has, and, I mean, he... He can't go live by Norma.
You know, I feel like we're the only family that he has, and, I mean, he... He can't go live by Norma.<eos> H... how can I turn him away?<eos> I... I don't know, I feel like I...<eos> Like I have to give him a chance.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know, Kate.<eos> Mother.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you some sample cans of paint and brushes so you can try out the colors.
Like I have to give him a chance.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know, Kate.<eos> Mother.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you some sample cans of paint and brushes so you can try out the colors.<eos> Well, that's incredibly kind of you.<eos> Oh, I found my wallet, actually.<eos> You can pay me later.
I was actually gonna stop by later today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me walk you to your car.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> This place is awfully cute.<eos> We, uh...<eos> I... I like it.<eos> I'd love to see the house.<eos> Oh, yeah, well, I'd love to show it to you. It's just a little bit of a mess right now, so.<eos> You live here all alone since your mom died?

I was just so hungry.<eos> You ever wake up in the middle of the night, and you just need to eat something?
Well, think about it...<eos> If you can come to the meeting.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I hope I didn't wake you up.<eos> I'm sorry. I was just so hungry.<eos> You ever wake up in the middle of the night, and you just need to eat something?<eos> Oh, my God, all the time, especially in my second trimester.<eos> I ate so much.<eos> Were you, um, scared?
I mean, being pregnant?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I mean, it happened.<eos> We did not plan it, but...<eos> I just felt so strong, like life had given me a second chance.<eos> Can I... can I talk to you about something?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, I want to thank you.<eos> For... what?<eos> For what you did for me to help me get the surgery.

Are you going somewhere?<eos> Oh, yes, actually, there's this... boring meeting in town for small business owners.<eos> I just thought I probably should attend.<eos> Small business owners as in hardware stores?<eos> Mother...<eos> It's fine.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, go ahead.<eos> But you can't take the car.

Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?<eos> No, I don't, Mother.<eos> Let's just drop this.<eos> A little late for that.<eos> Look in here.<eos> I don't want to look in there.<eos> Mother, never mind, okay?<eos> Do you remember the night you were putting up the shower curtains?

No.<eos> Do you remember a man showing up?<eos> No, Mother, no, I don't.<eos> You Norman Bates?<eos> I don't want to remember.<eos> I don't want to remember.<eos> It's too late!<eos> Why was he trying to kill me, Mother?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How did you get into the room so quickly?

Why were you even outside?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is wrong with us, Mother?<eos> I don't know, Norman! I don't know!<eos> All I know is that the world is full of bad people.<eos> And we cannot trust anyone from the outside.<eos> It is you and me, Norman.

It's gonna be okay.<eos> Well, it's not like we haven't done this before.<eos> We've just got to get rid of him.<eos> Well, I was gonna put him in the car while you were out...<eos> Just dump him somewhere while you were out.<eos> That's why I needed the car.<eos> Well, let's just get started.<eos> Look at the moon.<eos> It's so pretty how it reflects on the water.<eos> You just couldn't make nature up in a million years, could you?
I don't know.<eos> This feels deep enough.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Someone's gonna hear it.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Norman, hurry.<eos> Just chuck it in the water! Make it shut up.<eos> An inmate at the Bend Correctional Facility is attempting to contact you.<eos> To accept the call, press 1.<eos> Norman, what are you doing?

Hey, y'all.<eos> Gonna be a scorcher today.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Grandma?<eos> It's all right, Red.<eos> We're gonna get out of this.<eos> - Garth?<eos> - Yes, Mother.<eos> Did you get a good look at anybody?
- Yes, Mother.<eos> Did you get a good look at anybody?<eos> Recognize anyone?<eos> No, Mother.<eos> Shh. I think someone's coming.<eos> Check their restraints.<eos> You wanna tell us what the hell we're doin' here?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're tellin' me to shut up?<eos> I don't think you know whose weeds you're pissing in, buddy.
- Give me your hands.<eos> Just get it untied.<eos> That's...<eos> - I... I can't.<eos> - You can do it.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> It's really... - That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> What kind of knot is that?<eos> Come on. You can do it.
Oh, all right.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Come on. Oh.<eos> Almost. I almost got...<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No, I... No, it's not...<eos> - It's useless.<eos> It's not gonna happen. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph!<eos> I knew I should have sent you to fucking Boy Scouts.<eos> I don't know what you think you're gonna do anyway.
It's not gonna happen. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph!<eos> I knew I should have sent you to fucking Boy Scouts.<eos> I don't know what you think you're gonna do anyway.<eos> They both have guns.<eos> If we could get these hoods off, we might have a better idea of what we're dealing with. - Come on.<eos> Try again.<eos> - No. - Come on, Garthy...<eos> - No, stop it.<eos> Don't you disobey your mother!<eos> Or what, you're gonna take me over your knee?
God damn it, I have to pee.<eos> Hey, people!<eos> If you don't let me out of here, I'm gonna piss all over your floor!<eos> Lady, you're gonna need to calm down.<eos> Calm down? You want me to calm down, shit for brains?<eos> In case you hadn't noticed, we've got bags over our heads, we're all tied up and I gotta pee!<eos> You do what we say and everyone gets out of here safe and sound.<eos> Oh, now that sounds like the big man in charge.<eos> Is that the big man in charge?<eos> Get this goddamn thing off of my head and show me who you are.

And, frankly, I'd like to keep it that way. Okay?<eos> Bill...<eos> Ferguson...<eos> I need those 600 words on the Alamo anniversary by 5:00.<eos> Relax, man.<eos> It's the same story I wrote last year and the year before that.<eos> Well, can't help it if nothing ever happens in San Antonio.<eos> No, plenty happens in San Antonio.<eos> I just don't get to write about it.<eos> Where you going?
But I gotta go.<eos> If you wanna know more, come by 1682 Greystone Drive tonight.<eos> - What...<eos> - I'll be there.<eos> Hello?<eos> Madalyn?<eos> Bless this food to our use... and us to thy service.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Now, I don't suppose you found a job today?
- What...<eos> - I'll be there.<eos> Hello?<eos> Madalyn?<eos> Bless this food to our use... and us to thy service.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Now, I don't suppose you found a job today?<eos> But I didn't get a law degree to be a damn receptionist.<eos> You'd be lucky to be someone's receptionist.

I was just trying to make a point about your momma, huh?<eos> I've got a point I'd like to make.<eos> What else is new?<eos> No, this is important.<eos> Got an announcement.<eos> Getting another grandchild.<eos> That's right. Your precious daughter's got herself knocked up again.<eos> - Oh, honey, no.<eos> - Yeah. And the guy's kicked me to the curb again, saying it's not his, when I know for a fact it absolutely is his.<eos> You're an embarrassment.
- Oh, honey, no.<eos> - Yeah. And the guy's kicked me to the curb again, saying it's not his, when I know for a fact it absolutely is his.<eos> You're an embarrassment.<eos> That's right. That's right.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just like they did.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> - You wanna tell me what happened?<eos> - I don't know. Condom broke?<eos> You sure you wanna keep it?

I get plenty of that.<eos> Maddy, you made a couple of mistakes, that's all.
Maddy, you made a couple of mistakes, that's all.<eos> You know, I see these housewives in their identical homes with their identical lives, and...<eos> They disgust me, but sometimes I... I wish I could be like that, wish I could live like that.<eos> But I can't.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Mom, just lie to me.<eos> - Tell me everything's gonna be all right.<eos> Well, I could be a secretary.<eos> Telephone operator.<eos> You could sell Avon like Ms. Wright.
- Noncon...<eos> - Nonconformist?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, you could say that, I guess.<eos> White Tower won't serve Negroes... so they're protesting.<eos> And if they protest, will that make the White Tower serve them?<eos> No, the owners of that place are damn racists.<eos> Makes me so mad.<eos> I bet they call themselves Christians, too.<eos> Grandpa says you might find a job if you were more Christian.

Excuse me?<eos> Well, you're always going on about what's wrong with people, but you don't do anything about it.<eos> You just complain.<eos> Close to 100 demonstrators stepped out to protest the whites-only policy of the White Tower restaurant in downtown Baltimore.<eos> The activists were met with some resistance from supporters of segregation.<eos> I think that, uh, as much as we regret it, integration is here, and I would like to be able to do as much as I can to prevent it coming.<eos> But one white woman and her son actually showed up to march with the Negroes.<eos> The owners of the White Tower restaurant should be ashamed of themselves.<eos> This is Baltimore, not Nazi Germany.<eos> And what about you, young man?

And what about you, young man?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm here because I don't like racists, and because I'm a nonconformist like my mom.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I was trying to teach your grandson a lesson.<eos> "Judge not, lest ye be judged."<eos> What about the neighbors?<eos> What do you care what nosy old Mrs. Mosley thinks?<eos> You really are one selfish SOB.

But I can't.<eos> There's too much red tape...<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I said, "Just a sec."<eos> Now you be good for Grandma, right, Garth?<eos> You can find everything that you've been searching for in Christ.<eos> And I'd better not come home and find my son watching that claptrap with you.<eos> I don't want him getting any ideas.<eos> I'm gonna get in trouble again.<eos> Well, it's not my fault you missed the bus.
And I'd better not come home and find my son watching that claptrap with you.<eos> I don't want him getting any ideas.<eos> I'm gonna get in trouble again.<eos> Well, it's not my fault you missed the bus.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I'll talk to the teacher if I have to, okay?<eos> Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...<eos> - We are not making a habit of this.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You've gotta start getting up earlier. - I know.
My son, like myself, is an atheist. - Isn't that right, Bill?<eos> - Uh-huh. I cannot excuse your son from the morning devotion.<eos> It is required by the board, and it is the law.<eos> The law?<eos> Have you heard about the Constitution, by any chance?<eos> Kids, I hope she's not teaching you history, because, apparently, she flunked that class.<eos> In the Constitution, there is something called the First Amendment.<eos> And that protects the freedom of speech and religion.<eos> Are there any Jews in the class?<eos> Do your parents know that you are being forced to recite
- Ms. Murray!<eos> - I'm just trying to make a point.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> The school board cannot force my son to pray, or anyone else for that matter.<eos> So... sue them.<eos> First of all, can I just say, it is wonderful to see you all again.<eos> Garth.<eos> Lose a few pounds?<eos> You're looking good.<eos> Robin... did you miss me?
Robin... did you miss me?<eos> - For fuck's sake, David, get to the point.<eos> - Hey, I'm with you.<eos> I wanna keep this reunion as brief as possible.<eos> So here's the deal.<eos> - Tomorrow...<eos> - Wait, tomorrow?<eos> - What about the dogs?<eos> - Don't worry, sweetie.<eos> Tomorrow... you're gonna write us a little check, and then we will be happy to get you the hell out of this place.
That's what's in our personal account.<eos> What?<eos> Where is the rest of it?<eos> It's in dummy trusts.<eos> It's in dummy what now?<eos> They have to wire it here, the 600 grand, from New Zealand next week.<eos> Next week?<eos> And I have to sign for it in person.<eos> Hey...<eos> Are you lying?

Are you lying?<eos> Gary, calm down.<eos> I'm calm.<eos> He's a big boy.<eos> You didn't plan this very well, did you, David?<eos> I am in no mood for a jerk-off contest.<eos> Do I need to remind you who's holding the guns here?<eos> Everybody just needs to settle in... and try and get along.<eos> Looks like we're gonna be roommates for a few days.<eos> You don't think the police are gonna be looking for me?
They left them behind.<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Ferguson.<eos> Communist guerrillas, hiding out in the brush.<eos> Skirmishes such as this have been plaguing the country...<eos> Madalyn, I just don't get this.<eos> I still can't understand why those children can't say one little prayer.<eos> They can pray all they want to.<eos> - School can't force 'em to.<eos> - Okay, Maddy. But can't somebody else fight this?<eos> Why does it always have to be you?
Your mother's a whore!<eos> Get the hell off of me!<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> Go to hell, commies!<eos> No one wants you.<eos> - You go to hell!<eos> - Go, go, go!<eos> Madalyn!<eos> Come on.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?
But it's a fight worth having.<eos> Shit!<eos> "Page Si..." Page six?<eos> The police haven't even opened an investigation yet.<eos> And there are plenty of people who'd just as soon never see that woman in Texas again.<eos> Well, can I at least have a follow-up?<eos> Right now, I need a story on the transit board's bus route overhaul.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> This is all they had.<eos> I think you look pretty hot.

I guess.<eos> - Garth.<eos> I mean, he got us video games.<eos> He's right.<eos> I brought your medicine, I got you a change of clothes.<eos> I... I'd say for kidnappers, we are damn near hospitable.<eos> This is much better than prison, trust me.<eos> Gary was in prison.<eos> How come I didn't see that coming?<eos> You know, you just can't seem to shut the fuck up.
I'm an awfully big body to hide.<eos> - Gary, put the gun away.<eos> - Open up, Grandma!<eos> - Keep talking.<eos> - No, be funny, fucking Grandma.<eos> Do it!<eos> - Please!<eos> Gary, please.<eos> Not so tough now, huh?<eos> You're gonna owe me.
And what they want, it's nothing.<eos> So let's just play their game for now, and we'll figure out a way to nail them later.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he's right, Grandma.<eos> Yeah, he's right.<eos> This one time.<eos> Stop gloating.<eos> That's not good.<eos> It's fine.<eos> They think they're in New Zealand.<eos> You said two days, tops.
Robin would never leave her.<eos> And Garth?<eos> Yeah, Garth can't piss without his mom holding his dick.<eos> Four days.<eos> We get the money. We get out of town.<eos> Here.<eos> Get rid of the cars.<eos> Just to be safe.<eos> David...<eos> When this thing comes through, you're not really serious about letting them go, right?
Neither did Madalyn.<eos> But it didn't matter.<eos> When my parents kicked me out... she was there to take me in.<eos> All right, look.<eos> I have a PI, owes me a favor, uh...<eos> Not promising anything, but I'll see if he can't dig something up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jesus, David.<eos> Just as vain as ever, huh?<eos> You sure you're not a homo?

- Uh, Mother.<eos> Oh. Oh, all right.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I used that language again, Susan.<eos> I'll try to clean it up a little bit.<eos> Mother, uh...<eos> Mother...<eos> - Susan and I have been talking.<eos> - Bill, no.<eos> Well, I haven't even said what I'm gonna ask yet.<eos> You wanna abandon me.
- Bill, no.<eos> Well, I haven't even said what I'm gonna ask yet.<eos> You wanna abandon me.<eos> Please.<eos> Bill, look at me.<eos> Some freak put me in the hospital.<eos> You're fine.<eos> They're treating me for nerve damage.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right. I...
Probably very frightening for you, and we shouldn't have dragged Robin and Susan through all this.<eos> When we get down to LA, I'm gonna get you a really nice hotel suite.<eos> - They can stay there...<eos> - No, Mother... Mother!<eos> I have a wife and a child now.<eos> I'm not sure this is the life that I want for them.<eos> - Right, that's your decision.<eos> - All right.<eos> I just don't know if I can keep up what I'm doing without you.<eos> - Well, you got Richard now.

No, I told you it's enough.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where the hell have you been?
Thank you.<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> I'm about to go on.<eos> Susan filed for divorce.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> I knew it was gonna happen.<eos> I told you so, didn't I?<eos> - Mother.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You were over that fusspot a long time ago.
I told you so, didn't I?<eos> - Mother.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You were over that fusspot a long time ago.<eos> At least she didn't cheat on you like Richard did with me.<eos> What about Robin?<eos> No, don't you worry about Red.<eos> We'll get custody of her.<eos> Oh, Billy Boy, Momma's gonna take care of everything.<eos> All you have to worry about is taking care of me.
Well, I couldn't take Baltimore anymore.<eos> Windows were broken and tires slashed. I was shot at several times.<eos> Drove my poor mother to an early grave, I do believe.<eos> The center has a printing press, library and recording studio for her syndicated radio series.<eos> I do love a good fight.<eos> And taking on God and the church is... well, kind of the ultimate, isn't it?<eos> So, as long as there's a fight to be had, I'll still be a squeaky wheel.<eos> Well, there you have it, people.<eos> Now let's get something started!<eos> You watch and learn, Red, and one of these days you'll be running this whole goddamn place.

Okay?<eos> I'm sick and tired of living your life!<eos> What, you're gonna leave me?
Let us all pray.<eos> Pray to save the soul of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.<eos> Save me? Save me?<eos> Oh, Jesus couldn't save himself.<eos> The New Testament?<eos> Oh, a load of bull written by a bunch of faggots.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Y'all know that.<eos> Jesus was as queer as a three-dollar bill.<eos> You dirty heathen!
The New Testament?<eos> Oh, a load of bull written by a bunch of faggots.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Y'all know that.<eos> Jesus was as queer as a three-dollar bill.<eos> You dirty heathen!<eos> Let me see what that looks like.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, that's not bad.<eos> You were on fire out there tonight, darlin'.

Oh, not bad.<eos> We'll do better in Kansas City.<eos> I'll burn the goddamn book in Kansas City.<eos> Oh, Praise the Lord!<eos> Thank you, Garth.<eos> I'll keep praying for your soul, Madalyn.<eos> I'll keep cursing yours.<eos> You think we won anyone over?<eos> Oh, I don't know, honey.<eos> Did you hear from your father?
- Thanks, Mr. Sparrow.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What kind of religious nut goes off and sells a stolen car?<eos> Well, maybe this isn't the work of a religious nut.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, Madalyn was stashing loads of cash, right?<eos> Makes for the greatest motive of all.<eos> Greed.<eos> This is just like the old days.<eos> You used to let me win.

I deserve it.<eos> You are so full of yourself, you can't see the fucking forest for the trees.

I know.<eos> In God we trust.<eos> Right?<eos> Good luck.<eos> Mmm, what's going on?<eos> The money made it out of New Zealand.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> It's about time.<eos> The van's out back.<eos> Garth... you try anything... anything, Madalyn and Robin are dead.
No, I got it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bye, Mother.<eos> - You be careful, Garth. - Okay.<eos> You know those bills are gonna be marked.<eos> They're getting a cashier's check.<eos> Then we're using that to buy gold coins. Something that can't be traced.<eos> - Here you go, Grandma.<eos> - Thank you, darlin'.<eos> Well, it looks like you might have me here.

Retaliation.<eos> I was gonna teach this guy a lesson.<eos> But when I started with that tire iron...<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> I lost control.<eos> I got 30 years, but I only did half.<eos> Got out for good behavior.<eos> And I swore I would never lose control again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for telling me the fucking truth.

Starting to wish Bill Jr. Could've turned out more like you.<eos> He really hurt you, huh?<eos> He betrayed me.<eos> That's what men do.<eos> Betray me.<eos> But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.<eos> Nobody can really hurt me.<eos> Now that I trust you, I wanna show you something.<eos> I'm giving you a promotion, David.<eos> So far, you've been keeping track of most of our donations in the official ledger book.

Shit.<eos> Shit! Shit! Shit!<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> Oh, don't tell me it's another hiccup.<eos> We have to wait for another shipment of coins.<eos> What?<eos> They'll be here next Tuesday. Oh, for...<eos> This is getting ridiculous.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're not in charge here.

You know... if somebody did something to them... it's probably someone from that place.<eos> My mother pissed off a lot of people.<eos> Especially those she was closest to.<eos> Uh, excuse me, uh...<eos> I just want to say American Atheists has had a wonderful year, and... that would not be so without all of you.<eos> So, thank you, and a very happy winter solstice.<eos> Strike up the carols!<eos> Mother loves Christmas.<eos> She really, really does.<eos> Oh, and you in your sweater.

- Will you get me a refill, Garthy?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I'll go check on those cookies.<eos> The membership numbers are down, but the money is not.<eos> The way Madalyn gets these rich, dying atheists to leave her their entire estates...<eos> It's a hell of a way to make a living.<eos> She's not gonna live forever.<eos> And I don't know what she did to Bill, but if I was him, I would have suffered through until she kicked the bucket, and then I would've taken the whole thing for myself.<eos> I mean, Garth's not gonna take over.<eos> Can you imagine?
See anybody laughing?<eos> No more for him, huh?<eos> Madalyn, sorry.<eos> I don't wanna hear your excuses.<eos> Right now, all I want out of you is breathing.<eos> Very little of that.<eos> Come on. I just had a little bit too much to drink.<eos> Oh, I am assuming it was the drink talking, otherwise I would fire your ass.<eos> What?<eos> You wanna get rid of me?
Very little of that.<eos> Come on. I just had a little bit too much to drink.<eos> Oh, I am assuming it was the drink talking, otherwise I would fire your ass.<eos> What?<eos> You wanna get rid of me?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> But I know a lot of secrets about the American Atheists.<eos> Secrets that might interest the IRS in particular.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Go, tell the IRS whatever you want.

You think your son Bill hurt you?<eos> Nah.<eos> Not like I hurt her.<eos> Garth!<eos> David Waters is a convicted felon.<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> And his mother was a goddamn whore.<eos> And she's not the only one that sucked cocks for money.<eos> Isn't that right, David?<eos> Isn't that right? You sucked cock...
And she's not the only one that sucked cocks for money.<eos> Isn't that right, David?<eos> Isn't that right? You sucked cock...<eos> Don't fuck with me, Madalyn. Don't fuck with me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Hello, football fans...<eos> We got beer, vodka, cigs.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.
Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Sorry it ain't a martini.<eos> Oh, it's the good stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.
No, I did not.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Sorry it ain't a martini.<eos> Oh, it's the good stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.<eos> It's not you. It's David.
He has the sketch of the guy who sold Garth's car.<eos> Who the fuck is that?<eos> Get out!<eos> This is Bob Fry.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hey, Bob, it's, uh... it's Danny.<eos> You know, I was actually just headed back to Florida just now, but, um... I've got a couple things I gotta tie up still here in Texas.<eos> So, uh...<eos> But I'm gonna be sending you a letter.<eos> And if you could just hang onto it for me, that would be great.

Yeah.<eos> Mr. Waters, I'm not one for plea agreements, but I don't really have a say in the matter.<eos> You've discussed this with your lawyer?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Gary was like a mad dog.<eos> Sooner or later he was gonna bite.<eos> David.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> God damn it, Karr.<eos> What the fuck did you do?
It's getting a lot of hits lately.<eos> You should check it out.<eos> I don't recognize your authority.<eos> I don't recognize it.<eos> You afraid of, brother?<eos> You afraid of shining a light on some truth?<eos> Don't take my arm so tight.<eos> It's not necessary.<eos> Come on.<eos> You caved to a crazy man?
I'm gonna use my free...<eos> Shut that off, and do your homework!<eos> Degenerated like the mayor.<eos> You people talk and talk and do nothing!<eos> Come on.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> I voted for the changes.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> That guy and his argument were both crazy.<eos> I thought you were against sex before marriage.

Choose another topic.<eos> Religion.<eos> See?<eos> We can't write about anything actually affecting us.<eos> Last week, you vetoed my story about the stranger danger sessions the school keeps holding.<eos> Because it's a direct criticism of the administration's policies.<eos> They hired experts to remind us not to let strangers touch us in our bathing suit areas.<eos> That's what they said, "our bathing suit areas."<eos> - Some kids my age are already having sex, and, I'm not...<eos> - Okay, you're just trying to cause a stir, and that's not what real journalism is.

We're friends on Facebook.<eos> I've liked a lot of your Instagram posts. Hey.<eos> Seriously, Mark?<eos> You know, I was once upon your mattress.<eos> Okay, everyone, just remember, in the words of Stanislavski,<eos> "there are no small parts, only small actors."<eos> - I got it.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> Yay!<eos> I knew you would.
"there are no small parts, only small actors."<eos> - I got it.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> Yay!<eos> I knew you would.<eos> I was wondering if I could interview you about these auditions.<eos> For the school paper?<eos> It's time for North Salem to have a GSA.<eos> My old school had one, and most schools in Oregon do, so don't think I'm asking for some kind of fringe thing or whatever.<eos> Well, look, I-I'm proud of you... uh, that you have spoken your mind.
- and the overwhelming majority do.<eos> - Mom, Mom, just...<eos> It's very true.<eos> Let's at least have a discussion about it.<eos> No, we'll just put it to a vote.<eos> Well, it's yes from me.<eos> Uh... Nope for me.<eos> Of course, yes.<eos> No.<eos> Where are you on the... On this issue?
Are we in Salem, Oregon, or Salem, Massachusetts, circa 16... whenever the heck those witches were being hunted?<eos> ♪ Can't burn me This witch is fireproof ♪<eos> ♪ So try and hang me And see how strong my neck is ♪<eos> Diwata, what is going on in there?<eos> No, Mom...<eos> But I'm an actress.<eos> Speech and Debate sounds like homework that nerds want to do because regular homework isn't, I don't know, enough?<eos> Just read the part that says "D.I." on the home page.<eos> They call it competitive acting.<eos> You'll see why I called you.
Solomon, tell them about the tournament in the city.<eos> - We travel, people.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> The Portland Invitational<eos> - is two weeks away...<eos> - But first, travel is...<eos> Yes?<eos> I don't get this.<eos> Who are you?

I'll teach you all the terms.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> Okay, if we could all get into a circle...<eos> This year's debate topic is... Resolved.<eos> When in conflict, an individual's freedom of speech should be valued over a community's moral standards.<eos> In a year with our mayor...<eos> He's in trouble, and...<eos> With the school censoring our newspaper articles, this is pretty relevant, yeah?<eos> Solomon, you're freaking people out.

We need to pick what events we'll do.<eos> I don't want to get laughed out of Portland.<eos> If we're gonna do this, we need to rehearse.<eos> Sorry. Please continue, Professor.<eos> I'll take Persuasive Speaking.<eos> Resolved.<eos> When in conflict, an individual's freedom of speech should be valued over a community's moral standards.<eos> Wait. If it's resolved, why do we have to debate it?<eos> The school board has been shielding students from important discussions about abortion...<eos> - I don't care what you're saying, - religion,
- Politics.<eos> But who are they protecting?<eos> Be a real boy.<eos> Or the adults who would rather ignore our issues rather than engage them?<eos> Eye contact.<eos> Solomon.<eos> I saw Goody Osborn with the Devil.<eos> I saw Bridget Bishop with the Devil.<eos> I saw Goody Hawkins with the Devil.<eos> Looks like you're having an orgasm while getting murdered.
Hey.<eos> The school board needs to<eos> - stop shielding students<eos> - Eyes.<eos> - From meaningful discussions<eos> - Hands.<eos> Where are your hands?<eos> About abortion, religion, sex...<eos> - Your spirit animal is wounded. - Politics...<eos> You hit him with your car.
Press?<eos> Great stones, they lay upon his chest until he pled aye or nay.<eos> They say he give them but two words.<eos> "More weight," he says and died.<eos> "More weight."<eos> Ah, crap.<eos> I forget the rest.<eos> Okay. That's a wrap, boys.<eos> I'm meeting with Bellingham tomorrow to get him to sign off on Portland.<eos> I thought you already had approval.
I'll just use my mom's emergency credit card until...<eos> Wait.<eos> Who is Mrs. Poluski?<eos> Mrs. Poluski, these are the other star competitors,<eos> Howie and Solomon.<eos> Guys, this is Mrs. Poluski.<eos> Poluski is name of Serbian rapist husband.<eos> I am Oksana.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you just pay her?

You have to wear a suit.<eos> I don't own a suit.<eos> Well, borrow one from Solomon.<eos> Have you seen his wardrobe?<eos> - Hey, Casey.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> He dresses like he's already in this club, so let's go with that.<eos> I'm not even his size.<eos> We'll make it work.<eos> Are you cheating on your Internet girlfriend already?
People as diverse as Martin Luther King, Jr...<eos> Malcolm X, Susan B. Anthony were willing to risk themselves for this concept,<eos> And that's why freedom of speech isn't free at all.<eos> Contestant 43, you have three minutes for your rebuttal.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - A job well done, all those competitors who have advanced.<eos> Please proceed to your next round.<eos> For those who did not advance, the cafeteria is available for a short time and accepts all major credit cards.<eos> Finally, congratulations to the Holy Ghost Academy...<eos> Hey, is that you, man?
- Ghost!<eos> Well... we can't just go home now, can we?<eos> - Holy...<eos> - Ghost!<eos> - Holy...<eos> - Ghost!<eos> Come on.<eos> My parents are going to kill me if I'm not home in time.<eos> Chill out.<eos> It's happy hour, and you don't look happy.

Ladies, man.<eos> Oh, it's so awesome.<eos> Guess what.<eos> I'm a lady's man.<eos> I try to get with girls, but it's like...<eos> - what's wrong with me?<eos> - Okay, okay, okay, just... Just calm down, buddy, okay?<eos> I'm not handsome.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're handsome.

Maybe that's why you have no friends.
- It sure is.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> Okay, we would love three tickets.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where's Solomon?<eos> Is that him right...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Solomon!<eos> Solomon!<eos> Solomon, what are you doing?
Wait.<eos> Where's Solomon?<eos> Is that him right...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Solomon!<eos> Solomon!<eos> Solomon, what are you doing?<eos> - I hate my clothes.<eos> - Solomon!<eos> What the hell are you doing?

- Can we...<eos> - Get him out!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Solomon, just, just give me your hand, okay?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> You guys...<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I thought you'd be more fun on drugs.
Solomon, just, just give me your hand, okay?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> You guys...<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I thought you'd be more fun on drugs.<eos> Guys, I promise, once we get on that bus, we're gonna have a good laugh about all this.<eos> Drugs?<eos> You gave me drugs?
Go right... right there.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Why does my head feel so heavy?<eos> Can you feel my head, please?<eos> Feel it.<eos> Let me get you some water.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Let me just...<eos> I can't believe you gave me drugs.
I can't believe all this stuff is included with the room.<eos> Howie, free hot cocoa mix.<eos> It's free.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Drink that.<eos> Is my head the same size as yours?<eos> Crap.<eos> Find out what to believe.<eos> His parents are already here at work.<eos> Well, you stay put, okay?
They're safe.<eos> I just don't see why we need to rush there right now.<eos> They're gonna be home first thing in the morning.<eos> Okay, it's all right. I can go pick them up.<eos> I'll see if I can take off from work.<eos> I have to drive Diwata's car home anyway.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I warned you this would happen if we put him in a public school, didn't I?<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> What you thinking about, Howie?

We're weaker on our own, but together...<eos> I'm quitting, too.<eos> Guys, don't get a bad attitude because we lost once.<eos> Watch.<eos> Want some?<eos> Oh, no, not if there's alcohol in it.<eos> Well, it's not non-alcoholic wine, Diwata.<eos> I shouldn't then.<eos> I...<eos> Until I'm into a good BFA program, I need to protect my singing voice, you know?
I...<eos> Until I'm into a good BFA program, I need to protect my singing voice, you know?<eos> Yeah, alcohol dries out the chords.<eos> You know... someone who looks a lot like you, was checking out the family planning center, across from the pizza shop I work at last week.<eos> And...<eos> I was just too scared to go in.<eos> 'Cause I'm not sure I'm...<eos> I did one of those, like, home tests, and it was, like, kind of a line, maybe not.<eos> I can't go to my family doctor, so I've gotta go back there to get official results.<eos> Do you have someone to go with you?

Who the hell are...<eos> Who the hell is she?<eos> I work in cafeteria for seven years.<eos> Sir, we never intended...<eos> You all have parents on the school board.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You're lucky that I don't suspend you all for fraudulently representing our school.<eos> You all have two weeks of detention, and no more clubs.<eos> What about the school newspaper?<eos> You're joking, right?
Journalism relies on morals, ethics, and honesty.<eos> There is no way that this school is gonna pay a dime towards these bills.<eos> I have some money saved up.<eos> Yeah, not enough to cover this.<eos> My mother's broke, Diwata.<eos> It's gonna take me all summer to even put a dent in this.<eos> If I was running things, we would have at least followed the rules.<eos> If you were running things, we never would have made it to Portland.<eos> Then I could similarly surmise that short people... are stupider than taller people, because you can't see as much as taller people, and they have smaller brain...<eos> Hey, you ain't that tall either, Solomon.

- Yeah, too soon.<eos> Too soon.<eos> You know you're really lucky, right?<eos> I know.<eos> Especially since that guy, Mark... day after we did it, I... called just to say hey or whatever, and he was like,<eos> "I never would have slept with you if I wasn't so wasted," so...<eos> So you guys are... getting married?<eos> Yep. It's a spring wedding.<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> How did you get that?
How did you get that?<eos> All the entries are archived at the library.<eos> Yep, he won second place.<eos> Prepare thyself.<eos> "Abraham was just 13 years old, but he already loved to read and learn.<eos> One day, he decided to journey into town to the library and see what adventures he could find.<eos> He read a book about the frontier, and he built a log cabin.<eos> He read a book about the law, and he became President."<eos> You didn't think I'd find out?<eos> How did you? They told you?
He read a book about the law, and he became President."<eos> You didn't think I'd find out?<eos> How did you? They told you?<eos> Of course they told me.<eos> It's my credit card, Diwata.<eos> And I am not busting my ass nights at the hospital for you to take my money and throw it in the street.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... sorry.<eos> That's not good enough.<eos> You forged a signature on the entry form.

The lights are pretty.<eos> Did your mom put 'em up?<eos> Where is Mom?<eos> She out banning some books?<eos> Burning them?<eos> I think my parents are breaking up.<eos> I don't even want to finish school.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Why should I go back?<eos> You even said I have no personality.
And they were, like, shifting their weight and coughing, but it was obvious.<eos> And the guy that my mom was dating at the time... he actually stood up... stopped the music,<eos> and made me walk back to my seat.<eos> I dropped out of Scouts because the kids started calling me...<eos> Miss Gay BSA.<eos> Bathing suit areas...<eos> - No, idiot...<eos> - From stranger danger?<eos> Boy Scouts of America.<eos> Solomon, you know you're grounded.
Press?<eos> Great stones, they lay upon his chest until he plead aye or nay.<eos> They say he give 'em but two words.<eos> "More weight," he says and died.<eos> More weight.<eos> Add another stone.<eos> Make him speak.<eos> More weight.<eos> Give us a name!<eos> Diwata, you want dinner?

It's okay. It's okay.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Being an adult doesn't mean that you suddenly have the answers to everything.<eos> What do you think I should tell him?<eos> That you love him.<eos> Start there.<eos> I'm gonna be such a better parent than you guys, just FYI.<eos> Could you excuse us for a second?<eos> What?<eos> Do you think my life is easy?

How do you get people to listen to you?<eos> And now, I mean, they love you.<eos> Well, you know, getting people to listen to you is kind of the opposite of getting people to like you.<eos> You know, they tell me, "Stick to your two minutes."<eos> I remind them that I'm gonna speak until I'm done speaking.<eos> They can arrest me.<eos> I'm using their stage for my needs, not theirs, my terms.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> What are you doing here?

Sadly, I will not be participating in this year's show due to miscasting.<eos> As disturbing as this news has been to a lot of people in the community, I'm grateful it's led me to an amazing new group of people here at North Salem.<eos> I recently became part of the newly-formed Speech and Debate team, the first team in the school's history to almost make it to octo-finals at the highly prestigious Portland Invitational.<eos> And now, with my remaining two minutes, I'd like to show you our team's work to prove that the school should support, metaphorically and financially, our worthwhile endeavor.<eos> Arnie, lights.<eos> Where am I?<eos> I must have fallen through a wormhole and traveled back in time.<eos> But to when?<eos> And to where?<eos> ♪ Boy, what you doin'? ♪

- -Well, I started when I was a sophomore.<eos> That was last year.<eos> At the beginning, it seemed like a better choice than yearbook...<eos> What?<eos> - What?<eos> - No, this has got to be a joke. What?<eos> - Anyway... - What?<eos> Accept it!<eos> No!<eos> You didn't realize he was into you?
Have a point of view on my own school.<eos> I had to report on topics that were already decided on, and that's the opposite of reporting.<eos> But the newspaper, the arts, our clubs,<eos> Look.<eos> That's him.<eos> That's him.<eos> What's important to our lives.<eos> But all of these things, they were just a symptom of the larger problem.<eos> No one was listening to us.<eos> Well, Solomon, we're on air, and you're talking to five million people.

_<eos> Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> Scott! Help me!<eos> No, no!<eos> So, what's the plan then?<eos> I'm goin' through the portal.<eos> - Who's Peter?<eos> - My dad.<eos> He has something.<eos> Stiles, is this you?
- Canaan.<eos> We're comin' to get you.<eos> No, you can't. You won't be able to find me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Wait!<eos> It's not real!<eos> Not real!<eos> It's not real!<eos> It's not...<eos> All right. You heard a voice coming through the radio, and now you're convinced that it's the voice of...
Claudia's Jeep.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah. But if you had...<eos> - Enough, Scott!<eos> Enough.<eos> You saw a carousel?
I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah. But if you had...<eos> - Enough, Scott!<eos> Enough.<eos> You saw a carousel?<eos> And a big sign that said "Canaan." And people disappearing in clouds of smoke.<eos> Do you ever have nice dreams?
I keep calling the number for City Hall, and no one answers.<eos> The only map I can find it on is 30 years old.<eos> So far, the only thing I know about Canaan is where it is.<eos> That's all we need to know.<eos> Scott, Malia and Lydia are going out to Canaan.<eos> He said to go through with the plan as long as it doesn't destroy his house.<eos> What plan?<eos> Your plan.<eos> I don't have a plan.<eos> Well, you said you had all these ideas about how to catch a Ghost Rider.
Great. Let's do it.<eos> We need to break into the faculty storage room.<eos> To save the whole town from Ghost Riders?<eos> No problem.<eos> It's spreading, isn't it?<eos> You don't wanna know.<eos> Uh, how did a whip do this?<eos> It was a Ghost Rider's whip.<eos> Well, the regular doctors think that they can surgically remove the dead flesh.<eos> You're scheduled for emergency surgery in an hour.

It was a Ghost Rider's whip.<eos> Well, the regular doctors think that they can surgically remove the dead flesh.<eos> You're scheduled for emergency surgery in an hour.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey...<eos> Wait!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> It's a supernatural toxin.<eos> If they try to cut it out, it will spread.<eos> Tell me what you need.
I wonder why Stiles would send us here.<eos> This is the place I saw in the mirror.<eos> Uh, tell Doctor Geyer they wanted to do a few more tests before surgery.<eos> If he even asks.<eos> He probably won't.<eos> But if he does ask, tell him that.<eos> Mom?<eos> Kylie?<eos> Is that your adoptive family?<eos> I know what you're thinking.

But if he does ask, tell him that.<eos> Mom?<eos> Kylie?<eos> Is that your adoptive family?<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> You should've died with them.<eos> Let me help you with that.<eos> Do you have the list?<eos> It's in my head.<eos> What if you forget something?
You should've died with them.<eos> Let me help you with that.<eos> Do you have the list?<eos> It's in my head.<eos> What if you forget something?<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> If we get caught stealing school supplies, it's a great idea.<eos> Okay, now.<eos> Can't we just buy a lightning rod?<eos> Sure, if you've got $2500.
Go after him!<eos> I think we both know that this medication isn't gonna work, either.<eos> So I'm open for suggestions.<eos> I had an idea, but it's asking a lot.<eos> Asking more than risking my job by losing a patient in this hospital?<eos> It's the Nine Herbs.<eos> They counteract nine supernatural venoms.<eos> If the herbs are combined in the wrong way, it increases the venom's power.<eos> So if I screw up...<eos> You'll kill me.

Mugwort<eos> Mugwort.<eos> That sounds so familiar.<eos> Hmm, of course.<eos> It's prescribed for anxiety.<eos> Most of these herbs are used in modern drugs.<eos> So, between raiding the hospital pharmacy, the homeopath downtown and the salad bar, I think I can find them all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna be back as soon as I can.<eos> You try to stay awake.

I don't even think Kira could do that.<eos> Josh could.<eos> He ate electricity.<eos> Josh is dead.<eos> Yeah, but his power didn't die with him.<eos> May as well have.<eos> We can't get to it.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Not for sure.<eos> What are you saying?

We always served this when we had friends to visit.<eos> We didn't come to visit.<eos> We're looking for someone.<eos> A friend of ours.<eos> Maybe you've seen him.<eos> His name is Stiles?<eos> It's been a while since anyone came through Canaan.<eos> How long?<eos> Since April 8th, 1987?<eos> Why would you disturb those things?
All at once?<eos> They all just disappeared?<eos> I didn't say they disappeared. I said they left.<eos> Did they leave in a cloud of green smoke?<eos> They just left!<eos> We didn't mean to upset you.<eos> We'll go now.<eos> No one is leaving.<eos> No one is leaving Canaan ever again.<eos> I think the last thing that you were trying to say was my name.

And we like him.<eos> But we need to help our town.<eos> People are disappearing, uh, leaving, I mean leaving.<eos> You could really help us.<eos> No one can help you.<eos> If they want to leave, they're going to leave.<eos> They'll go, and they'll go, and there won't be anything you can do about it.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Go.<eos> Caleb, can you help us find a way out of here?
Come with me.<eos> Go.<eos> Caleb, can you help us find a way out of here?<eos> You have to stay because Mommy said so.<eos> No, we can't stay.<eos> We have to go home. This is home.<eos> Scott? Come here for a sec.<eos> Look at the date.<eos> Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?

Scott? Come here for a sec.<eos> Look at the date.<eos> Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?<eos> 1976.<eos> And when did you die?<eos> Why didn't you leave too?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Is that an accusation?<eos> Are you accusing me of something?
And when did you die?<eos> Why didn't you leave too?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Is that an accusation?<eos> Are you accusing me of something?<eos> How come you're the only one left?<eos> Did you hide?<eos> Did you fight them?<eos> Fight who?<eos> Who are you talking about?
They are unstoppable.<eos> They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> Kira entrusted me with her sword while she's with the Skinwalkers.<eos> And now, I'm trusting you because I believe she would want me to.<eos> Do not mistake this for me agreeing with your decision.<eos> I understand.<eos> Kira just stabbed her sword into the ground.<eos> If you want to do this, you'll have to do it yourself.
Mel<eos> - Celtic for honey.<eos> Not an herb, but it is a binding agent and a natural antibiotic.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Bite down on this, It'll help.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Am I having another hallucination?<eos> If you are, I'm having the same one.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> I know you're not gonna beat an eight-year-old's ass, but I will.

You can do it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hey, what the hell?<eos> That was only one billion joules.<eos> Only?<eos> Well, how many joules are in a bolt of lightning?<eos> Five billion.<eos> Well, I'm fine, by the way.<eos> Thank you for your concern.<eos> You don't have Josh's power anymore, do you?

Okay. Send him back.<eos> Hold on. I can help.<eos> I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> I also know about things I'm betting you don't.<eos> I'm with Ms. Romero on this one.<eos> Send him back.<eos> Who's making decisions around here?<eos> Where's Scott?<eos> Where's Stiles?<eos> You remember Stiles?
Why wouldn't I remember Stiles?<eos> Maybe he's useful after all.<eos> You didn't know what was happening, did you?<eos> You only saw them at the very end.<eos> They were all around me but they didn't take me.<eos> It's because you're a Banshee.<eos> Like me.<eos> How long has it been?<eos> Almost 30 years.<eos> Breathe, Malia, you have to breathe.

- Are you okay?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Mommy says you can go now.<eos> Let's get out of here. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> You know you can still come with us.<eos> I couldn't leave Caleb.<eos> Lenore, you know he's not real.<eos> I couldn't leave Caleb.<eos> You know all about the Ghost Riders.
They're not just gonna stick around. Unless...<eos> Unless what?<eos> Unless they're stuck.<eos> You guys think Stiles sent us here to warn us?<eos> Maybe Beacon Hills is gonna be the next ghost town.<eos> If we don't stop it, yes.<eos> We need to get them to leave. Now.<eos> We can't.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You're gonna help us.
