Okay.<eos> I'll play your little game.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wait.<eos> We're at an ATV store.<eos> Yeah, that's where you go to buy an ATV.<eos> Hold it. Just...<eos> So just one more time...<eos> We're actually here to get an ATV?<eos> Babe, I gotta say, for somebody who does their banking online, you're a little slow on the uptake.
Right?<eos> It's fun.<eos> Stop fooling around.<eos> Come here.<eos> Check this one out.<eos> I want you to see it. Look at the storage box on this one!<eos> Fine, let's just get one and go home.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I don't wanna cry for reasons I can't explain.<eos> I promise you're gonna feel better in a second.

No.<eos> That's where a chunk of your malasada breaks off and just sinks right to the bottom of your cup of coffee.<eos> And then you don't see that nasty, soggy thing again until you're down to the last sip.<eos> And let me tell you something.<eos> Soggy malasada... Nobody's friend.<eos> Nobody's friend. Copy.<eos> Got it.<eos> Got it.<eos> All right.<eos> I got to tell you the truth, man.
'Cause nobody can be that lucky.<eos> Again.<eos> Again?<eos> Yeah, 'cause I need more whipped cream flung up my nose.<eos> This time I'm going first, okay?<eos> Mouth.<eos> There you go.<eos> This time I'm getting you for sure.<eos> All right.<eos> You're not gonna get away with it.
What? Get out.<eos> You keep a journal?<eos> Yes, since I was eight years old.<eos> You're like John Doe in Se7en meets Doogie Howser.<eos> What do you write about?<eos> Anything.<eos> Everything.<eos> My thoughts. Insights into the human condition. Wow.<eos> Really?<eos> D-Do you mind if I... If it'll keep you quiet, please.
You know, Max, you can always set your account up for direct deposit, and that way you won't have the hassle of coming in the bank every week.<eos> Your time-saving assessment is quite correct.<eos> I've had this thought myself, but eventually decided against it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why's that?<eos> FBI crime data shows a spike in Internet banking fraud, most notably in direct deposit scams, which is turning out to be quite troublesome.<eos> Here I thought the reason you came in every week was to see me.<eos> It is.<eos> I mean, y-yes, you... are the reason why I come in.<eos> I was just looking, for a... the right moment to ask you... for your... for your phone number.
All right. I understand.<eos> Book him, Danno.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that.<eos> Five more minutes!<eos> Jerry.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> I got to say, reading some of your diaries, I see Max Bergman in a whole new light.<eos> But there's something I've been dying to ask you.
Let's go!<eos> Stop!<eos> Let him live.<eos> Retreat! Retreat!<eos> Leave.<eos> All right.<eos> I admit.<eos> I was a fool not to kill her.<eos> You were a fool to think that she would always wait for you.<eos> You were a fool to think that she loved you.
My name is Vik, King Harald.<eos> I am happy to meet you.<eos> Believe me, I knew nothing of this...<eos> Arrangement you had with my wife.<eos> Mmm. But I'm glad that you have forgiven her.<eos> - Hmm? No!<eos> Vik!<eos> Vik.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!
Believe me, I knew nothing of this...<eos> Arrangement you had with my wife.<eos> Mmm. But I'm glad that you have forgiven her.<eos> - Hmm? No!<eos> Vik!<eos> Vik.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.<eos> That's what they call you.
Vik.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.<eos> That's what they call you.<eos> But you are neither Earl nor King.<eos> How could you could collect such an army?<eos> Who paid for your army,<eos> Egil the bastard?<eos> Why should I tell you?

It's not what you do, it's who you are.<eos> This poison is like love.<eos> How so?<eos> It has a mystery ingredient.<eos> I do not yet know where it comes from but I will not stop looking until I find out.<eos> You see, it's not what I do, it's who I am.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To a house of ill-repute.<eos> Many of these women are very sick.<eos> Will I find you here when I return?
Well, I'm friends with this Indian guy I think you might know.<eos> Come on, you're not gonna do that shit, are you, Lisa?<eos> You don't go up to white people and go, "Hey, you're white, right?<eos> I know this white person. You might know 'em?"<eos> Well, he said he went to college with you.<eos> All right, I do know him.<eos> - Hmm. - My bad.<eos> That's the only time in history that hasn't been racist.<eos> Uh, Dev, um, one more thing.<eos> When we sign off, make sure you go,
I don't know.<eos> There's so much stuff here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You should put that on a shirt.<eos> New York City: There's so much stuff here.<eos> Well, no, I mean it.<eos> I mean, I've been walking all day through the city just staring at the building like this.<eos> - I love it.<eos> - Ah. Well, that is adorable.<eos> I gotta tell you something, though.

Well, that is adorable.<eos> I gotta tell you something, though.<eos> I am very hungry.<eos> Is there any way we can see the entire museum in, like, three minutes and then go get food?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> If you're good, I'll give you a cookie. - Yay!
Yeah, it's kind of like saying that all these women across history have been discriminated against just because they have vaginas.<eos> Whoa. Did this lady have a piano vagina?<eos> I'm never going to a museum with you again.<eos> Oh, how was the... The date the other night?<eos> It was fun.<eos> I had a lovely evening with this woman named Priya.<eos> Priya. - Oh. - Where did you meet her?<eos> I met her on, uh, one of those dating apps.<eos> What are dating app?<eos> It's like these apps on your phone where you see people's faces, and when you see a face you like, you hit a button, and if they hit a button on your face, then you have a match.
You better be there, you son of a bitch.<eos> I got him the job.<eos> This is so good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. Favorite taco in New York.<eos> Mm, Los Tacos Number 1, the al pastor.<eos> Fuckin' kidding me, bro? Me too.<eos> I love that place. Holy shit.<eos> Hey, pastor pals over here.<eos> You know where I gotta take you?
The city is always changing.<eos> It's true.<eos> I really like this stew.<eos> How is the cupcake show going?<eos> Eh, it's all right.<eos> I got some crazy news this week.<eos> They want me to do the show for seven seasons.<eos> I'm not sure I can do the show for that long.<eos> It's a good job, man.<eos> You don't work that much.
It sucks.<eos> Basketball scholarship would've come in real handy right now.<eos> But I'm just glad you in college and you ain't pregnant and on drugs.<eos> You don't got to worry about me getting pregnant.<eos> Why?<eos> You got that UID thing?<eos> Okay, first of all, it's not a UID.<eos> Okay? It's not a thing.<eos> - It's the IUD.<eos> But you ain't got to worry about me and pregnancy.
You're gonna have to come out to her every other week.<eos> True.<eos> She do be forgetting stuff.<eos> So how'd it go?<eos> Well, it wasn't my all-time favorite conversation with my mom, but it was all right.<eos> She cried, though.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I figured she would.<eos> She's a crier.<eos> She tell you she loves you and supports you no matter what and all that stuff?
Yeah, um... it's nice to mix it up so she's not always wearing sweatpants and a hat that says "Ratch."<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I remember when she was in the eighth grade. She wore a John Starks Knicks jersey to school the whole year.<eos> Then she spilled gravy all over it, and she still wore it for another month.<eos> I had to sneak up in her room and take it to give it to the Goodwill.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> I might just have to spill some gravy on that "Ratch" hat.<eos> I know that's right.<eos> What y'all in here laughing about?<eos> Don't you worry about it.
Autumn in New York.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Uno, due, tre.<eos> - How's it?<eos> Va bene. Let me see.<eos> Okay, let me...<eos> All right, you got to clean me up.<eos> Okay.<eos> You look cute.<eos> I'm gonna leave you like this with the little leaves around you. - Mm-hmm?
Mm, but it's pretty bad outside.<eos> Oof, yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Let's just stay in.<eos> Sure.<eos> Can I have the blanket?<eos> It's a bit cold.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank y-o-o-ou.<eos> once you put this blanket on, you will leave New York City and enter...
I had a playlist cooking the whole time.<eos> - Text me later, okay?<eos> - All right, bye.<eos> Uh, all right, well, um, I guess I'll see you later.<eos> I'm probably gonna hang out with Arnold, then maybe go to this yoga thing.<eos> Sure.<eos> Good night.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you were leaving.
You can't be lukewarm.<eos> What's "lukewarm"?<eos> It means not hot, not cold.<eos> It's in the middle.<eos> I don't want to be lukewarm.<eos> No.<eos> See? I just want to do this with you.<eos> I want to laugh with you. I want to define random English words.<eos> I-I just want to be with you.<eos> You make me so happy, and I think I make you pretty happy, too.
I'm sorry.<eos> [Dev] [sighs] How are you feeling?<eos> I feel shit.<eos> I feel horrible. I feel I'm doing something terrible behind his back.<eos> He's a nice person.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> You know how bad it is just to spend time with you, enjoy the moment, and then go back home, lie in bed with your actual fiancé?<eos> You know, sometimes--<eos> I mean, I know it-- it's gonna sound real weird, but-- sometimes, I wish he was cheating on me.<eos> It would be so much easier to just break up. Maybe he is cheating on you, he's just really good at hiding it.

Hey, y'all, I'm Raven, we're live, and this is Raven Live!<eos> We have a great show for you today.<eos> My favorite chef is gettin' live.<eos> That's right, Chef Jeff is in the building!<eos> And, we have...<eos> Why are you sitting here looking all depressed and sad?<eos> This is Raven Live!<eos> You need to be perked up, ready to sell this shit.<eos> Sorry, I'll try to get perked up.<eos> Damn. It's a good thing Raven ain't see you.
Because it's not simple like that, and--<eos> -It is. It is. -No, it's not.<eos> You had your fun with me, and now you're like,<eos> "Oh, well, Dev, we're just friends, so, see ya."<eos> Don't do this to me. Don't.<eos> Please, try to understand. Try to understand.<eos> Try to listen.<eos> What do I not understand?<eos> Explain it to me.<eos> Do you want me to explain to you that it's not easy to pack your life and just throw it away?
Your relationship probably wasn't gonna be this magical fantasy that's in your head.<eos> It was probably gonna be a shitshow.<eos> [sighs] I just thought we'd figure it out.<eos> ♪ ♪ [sighs] You know,<eos> I don't even know if it's about her.<eos> I just-- I miss that feeling.<eos> When we were together, doing all that stuff... [sighs] I felt really connected to somebody.<eos> And it felt good.<eos> ♪ ♪ Now I just feel fucking alone.<eos> You know what you really need is a distraction, something to get your mind off this.
It doesn't look like it got beat up too bad. But it's unresponsive.<eos> Shit.<eos> Its interface is missing.<eos> Well, that's how we found it.<eos> Let's pray the core is salvageable at least.<eos> I know this is a terrible time to ask, but what happens if this doesn't work?<eos> They'll probably nuke us from orbit.<eos> Can you hear them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do exactly as they instruct you.
I can't speak for their situation.<eos> So that's the official story.<eos> And now, the real reason?<eos> A recovery operation for the gauntlet.<eos> Either we'll find it through border inspections during the evacuation or the Intelligence Directorate will lead an exhaustive search once the bloc is emptied.<eos> That seems tedious.<eos> What happens to the Green Zone?<eos> The whole Los Angeles bloc is being cleared out for the effort.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - You didn't see the tail you picked up?
Why?<eos> Because our Hosts have decided that Los Angeles is no longer in their future plans.<eos> Total Rendition is coming.<eos> What the hell is "Total Rendition"?<eos> Our glorious Hosts come into the bloc, round up every human they can find, and take them to the Factory.<eos> Just like that.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are they doing this?<eos> To put it bluntly... because of him.<eos> And they didn't give you an out?
Help! He needs help.<eos> He's choking! Choking!<eos> Needs water, please. He's not worth anything to anybody dead.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Perfect.<eos> What's this water gonna do?<eos> Well, marble mixed with baking soda gives you sodium carbonate.<eos> Sodium carbonate mixed with leftover calcium hydroxide gives you lye, and lye mixed with aluminum gives you sodium and sodium mixed with water gives you a little something I like to call a coulomb explosion.<eos> Remind me to never let you into the Annex kitchen.
So far, your algorithm has turned up jack.<eos> Josh, you wouldn't know a recursive algorithm if it bit you on your asymptote.<eos> Uh, actually, if we go back to second-year astrophysics... Who taught the class?<eos> Pretty sure it was me.<eos> Let's go back to first year. Um, who got the highest mark<eos> - in advanced physics? - Excuse me. I'm gonna see if I can solve the, uh...<eos> the two-body problem. Two-body problem is high school math, dude.<eos> I need to get...<eos> Hi.<eos> I see you remembered your shoes.
So who are you?<eos> Me, I'm... I'm just a nobody.<eos> That's a lot of tuxedo for a nobody.<eos> All right, you got me.<eos> I'm Darius's new head of security.<eos> More dangerous with weapons or just your bare hands?<eos> You don't want to test it, trust me.<eos> I'm Amanda.<eos> Liam.<eos> What brings you here, Amanda?
I'm Amanda.<eos> Liam.<eos> What brings you here, Amanda?<eos> Oh, I just snagged an invite from a friend.<eos> I like to be where the action is.<eos> Never know who you'll meet.<eos> Sorry, uh... my, uh...- - my ride's leaving.<eos> I gotta go. Oh, I didn't catch your last name, Liam.<eos> That's 'cause I didn't give it to you.<eos> Hey, if you ever want to chat or hang out, give a ring.
Is there a problem here?<eos> - Yes, there is.<eos> - Is this man bothering you?<eos> No, no... we're fine.<eos> This man is indeed bothering me.<eos> - That so.<eos> - We're fine.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> Well, it certainly took you long enough to fetch her!<eos> Oh, sorry to... cause you worry, Marilla.
I'll be out, uh... by the potato barns today.<eos> I might send Jerry to the smithy with the bay for shoes.<eos> I'll pack him a lunch.<eos> Alright.<eos> Alright, then.<eos> It was so awful, Belle.<eos> When I saw the orphanage again, you can't imagine my dread.<eos> And now I'm back, but I'm not so sure...<eos> You're back?<eos> How dare you sneak around listening to my private conversation?
It's hard to believe she was sorrowful when she doesn't seem to like me at all.<eos> At least you're home.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> And I don't mean to seem ungrateful. And it did fill my heart with joy to be back at Green Gables.<eos> But I feel they could send me away at any moment.<eos> But now that it's all settled, why would they?<eos> I just don't want to get too attached.<eos> Not if it's all going to disappear.<eos> Catch.<eos> "If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends."
I wonder... will you forgive me?<eos> I am very sorry, Anne.<eos> When the brooch went missing, I was quick to judge.<eos> But what's worse is that I pushed you to fib.<eos> What else were you to do?<eos> Makes me shudder to think of it.<eos> And of course, I know now that you were telling the truth.<eos> You are a truthful girl, Anne, even now, and that is an admirable quality.<eos> This was my fault.<eos> And all that you went through because of it.
This horrible, hideous, horrible red hair.<eos> It's the bane of my existence. Anne Shirley-Cuthbert,<eos> I suggest you find a worthier overriding concern. And my freckles.<eos> I hate my freckles.<eos> And I can't help but think that the other children would like me better if I was pretty.<eos> Fiddlesticks.<eos> You're a vain one and no mistake.<eos> If a rose wasn't beautiful, nobody would want to stop and smell it.<eos> And besides, how can I be vain if I'm ugly? Enough of this foolishness.<eos> You'll do just fine at school if you'd stop your yammering and fortify yourself.
I feel real sorry for you, Anne.<eos> You're ridiculous.<eos> Hey, look, it's a talking dog!<eos> Can you fetch, too?<eos> Billy, leave her be.<eos> Sit. Stay.<eos> Roll over.<eos> Don't mind my brother. He's ridiculous!<eos> Ruff.<eos> Never let the boys know when they've upset you.
They're pretty hard to miss.<eos> Were they big?<eos> They're mountains.<eos> Is your dad feeling better?<eos> Uh, we're both glad to be back home.<eos> Why were you walking with that orphan girl?<eos> Why not?<eos> She's a loon.<eos> Says you.<eos> Hope you didn't get any asylum cooties.
I... I see.<eos> We understand clearly now that Anne needs all of your attention.<eos> You've got your hands full.<eos> All of my attention?<eos> Also, we urge you to consider home schooling.<eos> That would be best for all concerned. And we are concerned.<eos> Good day to you.<eos> What do you suppose happened with Anne... they don't want her back in school?<eos> We'll know soon enough.<eos> They don't want you back.
I know the whole story.<eos> And the Andrews are fit to be tied.<eos> I hope I didn't meddle too much, but I thought we ought to know, and Rachel's reliable in the knowing department.<eos> Dear Lord, that child will put me in the grave.<eos> I cannot bear to think of her spewing such filth.<eos> It worries me to no end.<eos> What a disgrace.<eos> Just wait until all of Avonlea hears about this, if they haven't already.<eos> I feel worried for Anne... is what.<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, I don't understand you at all.
I bet she does very well at school.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Hey...<eos> Carrots!<eos> I'm not talking to you!<eos> You just did.<eos> Shirley!<eos> Get up here! Now!<eos> What a vicious display!<eos> Is this what they taught you in that orphanage?
You are Ragnar's sons.<eos> It was mistake not to kill us.<eos> I want to go here.<eos> To this sea.<eos> But I have to sail along your coastline to get there.<eos> Only if you allow me to come with you.<eos> Where is Ragnar?<eos> King Ecbert handed him over to King Aelle.<eos> We will have to avenge him.<eos> We have something to tell you.
Don't fight me, then.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just as long as you know that one day, I will kill you, Lagertha.<eos> Your fate is fixed.<eos> Where are we, do you suppose?<eos> Ispania.<eos> About here.<eos> If we're lucky.<eos> Or if the gods will it.<eos> Or have you forgotten about the gods, Rollo?
I need something to fill me up.<eos> I was so sick I thought I was going to die.<eos> But I had time to think about everything.<eos> About what I want from this life.<eos> And I want a baby.<eos> - No, Helga.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I need something more from this life.<eos> But not a child.<eos> - Don't you remember?
What are you thinking about?<eos> I was just wondering if Bjorn Ironside is cursed, like his father.<eos> If we flounder, then the gods are surely displeased.<eos> Then what shall we do?<eos> We should not trust in his star, but in our own.<eos> One day, we must overcome the Lothbroks, for how else can I become the King of all Norway?<eos> And sometimes I think, why wait?<eos> The gods will give us a sign.<eos> They love us.<eos> Will they try to kill you again?
He has other things on his mind.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I didn't know if you would forgive me.<eos> - For tricking you.<eos> And then...<eos> - You're a slave.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> And I have greater betrayals to deal with.<eos> I have to work.<eos> And I have to see you.
So you feel sorry for yourself?<eos> Poor little Sigurd.<eos> You're wrong, Ivar.<eos> I don't feel sorry for myself.<eos> Yeah. Right. No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I have very good reason not to feel so angry with Lagertha.<eos> Then what kind of a son are you?<eos> What does it matter what your mother did to you?
And,<eos> "Can the occupation of power distract the mind of the ruler?"<eos> Yes, well, I can see that you're bored already.<eos> No, Grandfather.<eos> Good boy.<eos> To the future.<eos> To the future.<eos> Drink up, drink up!<eos> Here's the thing, Alfred.<eos> Because God chooses you as King, you need to be a teacher to your people.
But I understood you had first claim to her.<eos> Queen lagertha.<eos> Princess ellisif from Denmark.<eos> Princess ellisif.<eos> I'm surprised to see you.<eos> Why?<eos> Hasn't the whole world come to kattegat?<eos> Can it be you have forgotten?<eos> Of course I haven't forgotten.<eos> You saw me, but you did not bother to come and say hello.
You have new responsibilities now.<eos> No.<eos> We are coming with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, we are a family now.<eos> Whatever happens, we must be together.<eos> But the girl still isn't eating properly.<eos> She doesn't seem settled or happy.<eos> It is you that is not happy, floki.<eos> Something happened to you in algeciras and you have not been the same.

But sometimes...<eos> Sometimes.<eos> We have to consider things beyond our feelings.<eos> And think what is best for our people!<eos> I know what our people want, Bjorn.<eos> And they want what I want.<eos> We have to consider our position of strength.<eos> And use that to our ultimate advantage!<eos> You always like to complicate things, Bjorn.<eos> You think it makes you look clever.
As for me...<eos> I want to go with Bjorn.<eos> I want to see the Mediterranean.<eos> Then it seems, the only thing<eos> that really kept the sons of Ragnar together was the death of their father.<eos> Poor Bjorn!<eos> It is you who doesn't want to keep the army together.<eos> It is you who wants to go away to sunny places.<eos> Everyone else can follow me.<eos> I do not want to follow you, Ivar.
You make me laugh.<eos> Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Enough!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!<eos> What's the matter, Ivar?<eos> You can't take it?<eos> Ivar, do not listen to him.<eos> No, I guess it must be hard for you now that your mommy's dead.<eos> Knowing she's the only one who ever really loved you.
No.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> _<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Thank you, Bishop Heahmund.<eos> My husband has gone to a better place.<eos> I know that.<eos> The Lord will find ways to console you.
I'm awesome.<eos> But everything I do pisses her off.<eos> Want my advice?<eos> Quit turning into a chimp and stealing monkey kisses.<eos> People think that's adorable.<eos> Nope, no one thinks that.<eos> Time out.<eos> Gotta make a call.<eos> Terra.<eos> Would you like to join me?
He's with a bunch of super heroes.<eos> Aldo: You think Superman or someone could take that thing off him.<eos> You're supposed to calm down.<eos> We can't have every call end this way, Aldo.<eos> Jaime won't wanna talk to us. Jaime's mom:<eos> Why is the cake coming out?<eos> It's not time!<eos> Ah, your aunt, Consuela, esta loca.<eos> Go, mom, we can talk later.<eos> I love you, Jaime.
My plan is nine centuries in the making.<eos> In every age, there are always those who oppose me.<eos> But as you can see,<eos> I am always victorious.<eos> Is that the reporter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Our friend won't be asking impertinent questions anymore.<eos> His heresy does not compare to the Titan's threat.<eos> We barely escaped them.<eos> But you did, because he warned you.
But you did, because he warned you.<eos> Our guardian angel.<eos> Oh, stop your fretting, mayhem.<eos> He'll keep the Titans at bay.<eos> I've foreseen it.<eos> Plus, I pay the bastard enough.<eos> Beast Boy:<eos> Could you slow down, Jaime?<eos> Go back to the tower then.<eos> Nobody asked you to come.
Kori, you know I'd never undermine you, right?<eos> They went to you.<eos> You were...<eos> Are a great leader.<eos> So, they instinctively look to you, now that you're back.<eos> After all, I'm not even from your world.<eos> Hey.<eos> Stop.<eos> You were chosen by the team to lead them.<eos> And have I told you how glad I am that you've chosen to move in with me?
- He's working on something.<eos> Have I mentioned he approves of us?<eos> So do I.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Problem?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Nice visit.<eos> I know I'm not easy to get close to.<eos> We have that in common, I think.<eos> But I could teach you some meditation techniques.
Hold up, Starfire's got something to say.<eos> With what we discovered tonight, we all need to be extra vigilant and not take any chances.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's Kevin Smith.<eos> I didn't say don't do what you have planned.<eos> But keep your eyes and comm lines open at all times.<eos> I have a feeling whatever blood is planning tonight is just a prelude.<eos> Sorry your party was interrupted.<eos> That's the way it goes.<eos> Don't let all that talk back there shake you up.
Mixing truth with lies.<eos> You're so freaking annoying.<eos> You don't know anything about him.<eos> He saved me.<eos> Let me guess, he kept you isolated.<eos> Dependent. Told you everyone was your enemy.<eos> Trained you, ruthlessly.<eos> And promised you exactly what you wanted.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> I've always hated you.

The day of blood.<eos> Crowd:<eos> Hail Brother Blood.<eos> Hail... Place gives me the creeps.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Ugh...<eos> Huh? Guys, Raven's not moving.<eos> Something's keeping me from using my powers to morph.<eos> Yeah, the machine's doing that.<eos> But, I'm the one who put you here.
Oh, it's a shame you have to go, sweet cheeks.<eos> We would have been fantastic lovers.<eos> You know, since we're both newly single.<eos> Let it begin!<eos> You think yourself a holy man, blood?<eos> You're filth.<eos> Take heart, sinner. You are about to become part of the greater good.<eos> We're gonna show you the greater good.<eos> By kicking your ass.<eos> No god is going to save you, Deathstroke.
All hail Brother Blood.<eos> Hail, hail.<eos> Yes...<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> Hey, papa, here's your pipe.<eos> Argh.<eos> Save some for me.<eos> Don't you know, I am the chosen?<eos> Don't you know, I am divine...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.
Come on.<eos> Argh!<eos> So long, kid.<eos> Terra...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, Terra...<eos> - No...<eos> - We have to go.<eos> The place is gonna collapse. Terra!<eos> So, let me ask you this, man, how do you become a Titan exactly?
Mark my words. Soon enough, she'll go back of her own accord.<eos> God willing.<eos> I think this length is fetching, Griselda.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, this will do nicely for dancing.<eos> Perhaps you could fashion a small loop at the hem so I can lift the train?<eos> I do so appreciate all your careful attentions, Griselda.<eos> I think it's ever so important to give credit where credit is due.<eos> How awful it would be to be in service of those who neglect you or treat you unkindly.<eos> I can imagine that it would make you feel quite small and hopeless... and occasionally despairing and lacking in confidence.
Ruby!<eos> - That was great!<eos> - Ruby, are you alright?<eos> Ruby...<eos> Girls are so useless.<eos> Guess you should've stayed home in the kitchen, eh? !<eos> What is wrong with you? !<eos> Go home and bake cookies!<eos> They already did.<eos> This is Ruby's property, or did you forget?
Much obliged.<eos> Ready?<eos> One... two... [both]:<eos> She's a real bright little thing. She talks a mile a minute.<eos> Always something interesting to say.<eos> So you barely have to say a word.<eos> But you make yourself known.<eos> You once left a little something on my desk at school.<eos> Did I?<eos> You don't remember?
I'm sure it's a very dignified affair.<eos> Jerry, hurry and hitch up the buggy, or I shall be late for the ball!<eos> [laughter] Jerry, fetch me some rose water before I have a fainting spell!<eos> [laughter] [singing out of tune]: ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪ - ♪ Wake unto me. ♪ - ♪ Dream... ♪<eos> ♪ Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee ♪<eos> ♪ Sounds of the rude world heard in the day ♪<eos> ♪ Lulled by the moonlight have all passed away ♪ [laughter]<eos> Mother!<eos> As you can see, this is a disgraceful scene.<eos> My word, Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble.
Matthew, are you all right?<eos> Oh... Oh, good. You're back.<eos> Um, how was Charlottetown?<eos> Why are you sleeping in the middle of the day?<eos> Uh-huh. It's all right, Marilla.<eos> I expect Anne will sleep the day away as well.<eos> What's happened?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Is she ill? [mumbling] No need to fret.<eos> How about I tell you over a cup of coffee?
I wouldn't have had any idea myself.<eos> I never saw a case of croup.<eos> You know what was extra wonderful about it all?<eos> I got to spend time with my darling Diana.<eos> It's been an agony not speaking at school, an utter agony.<eos> It's been a long month indeed.<eos> I was so sorrowful to leave her this morning, knowing it'll all go back to how it's been.<eos> Take a few more bites.<eos> Why?<eos> Because when I tell you who just visited here, your reaction will lift you clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite.
[clanging]<eos> Gilbert!<eos> Gilbert!<eos> Anne!<eos> Anne!<eos> [squealing] Diana!<eos> Oh, aren't you almost nearly perfectly happy?<eos> Our separation has been an excruciating torment, but I'm so relieved it's finally over.<eos> Mother could hardly keep us apart since you saved Minnie May.<eos> Even Aunt Josephine said she'd be glad to see you again, and she doesn't like anyone.
No, no, she's come to stay with us for at least a month.<eos> I don't quite know how we'll stand it.<eos> She's so very particular.<eos> But she's suffered a loss - she's grieving - so she's disinclined to be home alone in Charlottetown<eos> - since her companion passed away. - Her companion?<eos> Her best friend forever and ever.<eos> Aunt Josephine never married.<eos> Neither of them did.<eos> They lived with each other their whole lives.<eos> I'd live with you forever if I could, but I know you'll leave me the day you get married to some wealthy and handsome gentleman.

It's because I have to.<eos> Mr. Phillips makes me go.<eos> I've explained this to Ruby.<eos> Do I need to explain it to you as well?
Oh, no, thank you.<eos> [woman laughing] You laugh, but I think it's a fine chapeau.<eos> Cosmopolitan.<eos> All the city folks are wearing them.<eos> Why don't you like it?<eos> Other than the fact that it's too big for your head?<eos> Room to grow. I'm sure it'll fit better when you acquire some more brains.<eos> Oh, show me mercy, Mar.<eos> Mercy, please.<eos> Perhaps this might persuade you to offer me a morsel of kindness.
I'd like to be very, very good at something astonishing.<eos> I don't seem to fit in.<eos> All the girls I know are preoccupied with becoming a wife.<eos> And what do you think about that?<eos> Well, I've always wanted to be a bride, but I don't really expect to be a wife.<eos> Interesting.<eos> - So you see the conundrum.<eos> I have the following thoughts to offer.<eos> First: you can get married anytime in your life if you choose to do so.<eos> That's true. And two: if you choose a career, you can buy a white dress yourself, have it made to order, and wear it whenever you want.
Hold my hand.<eos> I'm so nervous!<eos> We're sorry to intrude, but we wanted you to have that.<eos> - We're sorry for your loss.<eos> - It's a shepherd's pie.<eos> We made it together especially for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We hope you like shepherd's pie.<eos> Everyone likes shepherd's pie.<eos> We hope it's a comfort to you, Gilbert.
So, uh... bit of a cold snap, eh?<eos> True enough.<eos> Uh, the other day at the, uh...<eos> I-I noticed you had to leave a couple fields go fallow.<eos> - I haven't decided yet.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> I'll let you know if I'm going to sell.<eos> Oh. No, no, no.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I only wanted you to know that me and my hand Jerry, we'd be real happy to help out.
♪ Gloria... ♪<eos> Are you sure you're alright?<eos> Maybe you should slow down.<eos> I have to get on home.<eos> Oh, Diana, it can't be true!<eos> It isn't.<eos> That Josie Pye is just as mean as they make them.<eos> She hadn't any right to tell tales about you.<eos> My first family. My first home!<eos> They're not going to send you back.
There's no one to compete with.<eos> You want to spell out a few words for old times' sake?<eos> How about... "truce"?<eos> - T-R-U-C-E. - [both chuckling]<eos> Moody would've gotten that wrong. He would've!<eos> [laughing]<eos> - Get away from her!<eos> - Stop, Jerry!<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> Jerry, what happened to you? !
- This is a business arrangement.<eos> I'm offering you a job at fair wages that happens to be at Green Gables.<eos> Do you accept?<eos> Oui, I...<eos> I do.<eos> Merci<eos> Good lad.<eos> I'll be outside for a bit, tending to the livestock.<eos> I hope you've let go of that fool notion of last night.<eos> We've been together all these years, thick or thin, so don't think I'll put up with you slipping away now.
Hello?<eos> Matthew...<eos> Jeannie.<eos> Matthew!<eos> Jeannie! Help me get him to bed.<eos> And I couldn't have found your Anna more delightful if I tried.<eos> I didn't know she sold it.<eos> It made her so very happy to help.<eos> I don't want her suffering... because of me.<eos> Do you think she'd ever recover from losing you this way?
God, give me the strength to get through this day.<eos> Please remove my defaults in character.<eos> Help me be honest in--<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Gonna get an early start?<eos> - Yeah, I gotta get down to San Diego.<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> I wanted to take you out to breakfast to thank you for last night.
Hey, uh, I appreciate you coming to pick me up like this.<eos> Yeah, no sweat, dude.<eos> I'm kinda working from home.<eos> Where'd you park?<eos> At Spike's place, man.<eos> I couldn't afford to lose my spot.<eos> So when I said I needed a ride...<eos> I thought you wanted help on the tandem.<eos> I heard you were rocking that.<eos> If you're staying with "chickie" and London's not, I don't mean to be a perv, but are you guys still doing the deed?
No customers to bother us.<eos> It's like old times, man.<eos> Only thing missing is George.<eos> - There he is. - Oh, shit.<eos> I gotta ask him about Spike real quick, and all the electricals in the Minnie Winnie.<eos> He knows.<eos> I knew it.<eos> - What am I gonna do?<eos> I can't just hide for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, technically, you only need to hide for the rest of his life.
And I know that it was hurtful, those things that I said, and I'm sorry.<eos> You been going to meetings?<eos> I have, yeah.<eos> You looking for a sponsor?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Dennis.<eos> Dennis?<eos> Well, I woulda asked you, but--<eos> But you can't manipulate me like you can Dennis.<eos> He's too light in the pants to stand up to you.
Dennis ain't here. He can't hear you.<eos> Since when are you lookin' out for Dennis?<eos> I'm not lookin' out for Dennis.<eos> I'm lookin' for Dennis.<eos> - Does he know what this is about or...?<eos> - He better not.<eos> Hang on, George.<eos> I know what it's about.<eos> Rosa and Dennis are dating and...<eos> I know that you don't like the fact that Dennis is lying to you--
So if locals found out that he was here to kill a great white, they'd probably want to do the same thing to him.<eos> Boom. So anybody specific?<eos> This lady.<eos> Her name's Lily O'Neill.<eos> She's very big in the conservation world.<eos> They call her...<eos> the Shark Whisperer.<eos> No, I've heard of her.<eos> She free-dives with sharks to show people that they're not as dangerous as everyone thinks.<eos> But what makes you think that she's involved?
I'd like to come back sometime.<eos> You're welcome anytime, brah.<eos> Thanks for agreeing to a sit-down.<eos> Mahalo.<eos> Not easy marching around in a circle all day, is it?<eos> I admit, my dogs are barking a little, but we'll be back here tomorrow, bright and early.<eos> I know you will, but I've been thinking.<eos> Showdowns like this, nobody wins.<eos> The thing is, I can't give you everything you're asking for.<eos> However, what if I was to make you part of my management team, effective immediately?
But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.<eos> I have gotten much better at that.<eos> Have you?<eos> How am I feeling right now?<eos> What the...<eos> Excited? Itchy?<eos> Give me the first letter.<eos> You and I are in a relationship.<eos> I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.<eos> How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then, I find out that she watched two episodes without me.<eos> It's like I was excited for a present and got socks.<eos> I don't understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.<eos> I don't understand what's wrong with socks.<eos> To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.<eos> What happened with the tree?<eos> You do make a cute elf.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.<eos> Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.
Oh, I just talked to her.<eos> I've been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.<eos> You poor things, you must be exhausted.<eos> It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.<eos> How can she hate me?<eos> I make her food in my chest!<eos> It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.<eos> She doesn't hate you, stop saying that.<eos> Now you hate me too!<eos> Shh, I don't hate you.
I was hoping you might have room for one more.<eos> We're... submerging, Captain.<eos> I didn't give that order.<eos> But I did.<eos> You okay, Dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So...<eos> Hook, he... killed my father?<eos> Okay, that's a little tough to process.<eos> I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.
It might have worked.<eos> It took us to an empty field in the middle of the Magic Forest.<eos> Enchanted Forest.<eos> I don't care what you call it.<eos> Agrabah isn't here!<eos> I guess what they say about wishes is true.<eos> There's always a catch, always a price to pay.<eos> Jasmine.<eos> I think it's time we go home.<eos> In case you haven't been paying attention, I have no home!
No...<eos> That... will never happen.<eos> Well, that is entirely your choice.<eos> Either you marry me by sundown, or Agrabah will be destroyed.<eos> This is why I live in the desert.<eos> Too much water makes me nervous.<eos> Just a little further. Then I'll wish you free... and dump this lamp so deep, it doesn't hurt anyone ever again.<eos> I think this is far enough.<eos> If the water gets rough, we're too far away from shore.<eos> And, in case you've forgotten, we can't swim.
You heard the captain.<eos> Come on!<eos> Wonderful.<eos> You both have made a bloody mess of this.<eos> Have you got any idea how rare a Kraken is?<eos> ! I need its blood to get back to Emma. She's in danger.<eos> And now... now I've got no way of getting back home!<eos> Unless, of course...<eos> Unless you lend me one of your wishes.<eos> A wish won't get you back to Emma.
Hell, he scares me, too.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We can't find Jafar any more than we can find Agrabah.<eos> Actually... that's not quite true, love.<eos> Jafar... he's a man with revenge in his heart, yes?<eos> Well, on this ship... we have something to find such a man.<eos> What about getting back to Storybrooke?<eos> This is my way back.<eos> I've heard that Jafar is quite handy at traveling between realms.<eos> And you think he's just gonna do you a favor?
Yes, terrible is good.<eos> We can do this.<eos> You can do this.<eos> But I don't know if I can.<eos> It's time, Princess!<eos> I need an answer.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, why don't...<eos> Your friend is back in the sea where she belongs.<eos> And since you won't marry me, I have no choice but to destroy Agrabah.
It took me to Agrabah after all.<eos> And it is just as you left it, al-albeit rather smaller than is ideal for trade agreements.<eos> Now, did your father never tell you your duties to your people?<eos> Because you have failed spectacularly to carry it out, and thus deserve nothing... not the paltry love of an ex-Savior, nor the teeny-tiny prison of your people.<eos> Now, give me the ring.<eos> No.<eos> I deserve many things, and I will not let you keep any of them from me!<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> Now, I'm going to take that ring, if you don't mind.
Oh, now that the city's out of here, can I keep this?<eos> You did it.<eos> You are a hero.<eos> I'm free. I'm free!<eos> Now let me show you my world.<eos> You're a long way from your island.<eos> Are you as stranded here as I am? No.<eos> We're close to the Agraban Gulf.<eos> Once I hit the water, I'll be home faster than you think.<eos> And I'm sure you'll find someone here who can help you get back to Storybrooke, too.
Emma, are you there?<eos> I didn't mean to leave.<eos> I was on my way back to you, and...<eos> I would never leave you.<eos> Killian?<eos> Emma, he wanted me out of the way.<eos> And I love you.<eos> I don't know if you can hear me, but...<eos> I'm trying to get home to you... and I won't ever stop until I do.<eos> I love you, too.
Not while I hold onto the tears of the Savior.<eos> This is some powerful stuff.<eos> You should be more careful where you leave it.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You're not Aesop, are you?<eos> You're not even a bartender.<eos> No.<eos> What now, Gideon?<eos> You try to kill me again?<eos> It didn't turn out very well for you last time.
- Good morning.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Okay, here's the thing.<eos> I am so happy you found love, and I'm glad Adam feels comfortable enough to spend the night here.<eos> But you got to know, I can hear every thing you do all freakin' night long.<eos> Everything?<eos> Yes, you ass-slapping fool, everything.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Just keep in mind that our apartment has thin walls and your daughter's insurance doesn't cover therapy.<eos> Did you try the noise-canceling headphones I got you?
Oh, wait.<eos> Hey, hen party in the kitchen!<eos> Old school!<eos> Look, it's the Ghost of Christmas Past.<eos> Hey, um, Christy, can I...<eos> Can I tell you something that I've been thinking about all night?<eos> You should go home and I should go to bed?<eos> I could make you so pretty.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Didn't Adam tell you?
! Yes.<eos> I was in reserve in case the plan went awry.<eos> And now I can finally get into the cockpit and execute our plan:<eos> crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol of American materialism,<eos> Las Vegas.<eos> You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas, but I never thought I'd lose my life there.<eos> - Did you just think of that?<eos> - Yeah, just now.<eos> You know, you are seriously funny, man.<eos> I know I crap on you a lot, but sometimes, when I'm driving, I think about stuff you say and I laugh.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> I wanted to bring over something to welcome Gronk to the neighborhood.<eos> So I scraped all the cool ranch off of 15 bags of Doritos.<eos> You're bringing him a bowl of powder?<eos> Yeah, I thought he could eat it by the fistful or rub it on his balls.<eos> Peter, I don't know what you're so excited about.<eos> Rob Gronkowski is probably the worst neighbor we could ask for.<eos> You know he's gonna be partying day and night.<eos> It's not like it's that tasty piece of ass, Julian Edelman.<eos> Now there's a Patriot you can get excited about.
This here is the same stuff that turned Barry Bonds' head into a prize-winning squash.<eos> Okay. Well, how much are we supposed to give them?<eos> Hmm. It says this is enough for a horse, so,<eos> I don't know, how many bees is a horse?<eos> Well, you can't fit a horse in this box, so I'd just use the whole thing.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Barry Bonds says that's too much steroids.<eos> Time for bed, Barry.<eos> God, they're still going?<eos> Peter, this is exactly what I told you would happen!
The rebel ship has entered an underground passage.<eos> Let us pass, or I destroy the egg.<eos> Saw, you don't want to do this.<eos> I know you believe you're doing the right thing, but...<eos> Our enemy shows no mercy. Neither can we.<eos> If you harm that egg, you're helping the Empire wipe out the last of his kind.<eos> The last of his family.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> I know you care, because you know what it's like to lose family.
All right, all right.<eos> You wanted to speak with me?<eos> I've got something to show you.
Well, maybe I won't go easy on you this time.<eos> And that's your head. Hey!<eos> Not fair!<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> Special delivery.<eos> Is this a game for you?<eos> No game, just outsmarting my opponent.<eos> Care to take a shot?<eos> History lesson. The Jedi won the war with Mandalore.<eos> These tricks will amount to something, maybe save you from time to time, but they won't keep you alive in the long run.
Look, Sabine is a capable warrior.<eos> In some ways, more so than Ezra, but she can't... or won't find balance within herself.<eos> Until she does, wielding an actual lightsaber is far too dangerous for her.<eos> By letting her pretend with that stick, you're only encouraging her not to commit to this.<eos> You're not listening to me. If I let her use the darksaber, she will get hurt.<eos> She's already hurt.<eos> Her family hurt her more than any sword could.<eos> You don't see it because she doesn't want you to.<eos> But you can?<eos> Because I know what it's like when people you love don't believe in you, when they let you walk away.
If that's true, that makes you expendable.<eos> So what's it gonna be, Lucy?<eos> Are you gonna help me or not?<eos> There's nothing on this recorder.<eos> That's 'cause I erased the recording.<eos> And why would you do that?<eos> Because if Rittenhouse heard it, they'd know we killed their founder.<eos> You did what?<eos> Well, technically Flynn did, but we helped a little.<eos> Rufus, do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
Just won blue ribbon at the fair.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, Professor, as you well know, Edison was a paranoid son of a bitch.<eos> Didn't trust anyone near his prototypes... except Henry Ford, who was...?<eos> Edison's employee.<eos> His chief engineer at the time.<eos> This afternoon, Edison and Ford are going to meet with their financier, J.P. Morgan.<eos> They'll be in a heavily guarded room... very difficult to get into, even for me, even in 1893.<eos> But still, before they show up, I'm gonna plant a bomb there.<eos> I'm not going to help you.
Apparently, they're keen on me staying here.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> No, I'm at Dyad.<eos> Cos, what about you?<eos> What about your cure? Rachel administered it to me herself.<eos> My trial's underway. Are you serious?<eos> If it proves efficacious on me, then I'm to expand treatment to all the LEDA sisters.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I think those were my exact words too.<eos> How... How are you...
Okay, before your CAT scan, are you familiar with an amniocentesis?<eos> Needle.<eos> Is that medically necessary?<eos> I'll explain everything to your wife, Mr Hendrix.<eos> Our staff would like to talk to you about her accident.<eos> Standard stuff, just a few questions.<eos> Sir, this way, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll be all right? Alison?<eos> Felix, make sure they get a good look at you.
It had the worst bleaching it's ever had.<eos> It's just that we didn't manage to capture it.<eos> We put a lot of effort getting those cameras down, and we thought we'd... we'd done everything right...<eos> More so because we knew the clock was against us.<eos> We didn't know how long the bleaching event was gonna last.<eos> [Hoegh-Guldberg] I've been looking at the latest sea temperature values for the Australian region.<eos> Definitely warmer than it's been for quite a while.<eos> That coastal area is probably gonna continue to warm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you're into bleaching... [chuckles]
-Absolutely.<eos> We've got no choice.<eos> You've got no choice, I'm afraid.<eos> -You've gotta keep at it.<eos> You've got to.<eos> -Yep, yep.<eos> Otherwise, you're not gonna like yourself when you're an old man.<eos> You're gonna like yourself much more... if you can say, "Well, I sure tried to turn that around.<eos> And maybe I did influence people here and there and..."<eos> Don't let a- - Don't let anything stop you.
Us losing the Great Barrier Reef has got to wake up the world.<eos> [Hoegh-Guldberg] We have a really interesting situation.<eos> Over the next 30 years, we're going to be facing shifting ocean temperatures and conditions.<eos> And that's just a matter of fact, because we've got point-five...<eos> [Vevers] I usually get to these things and... and you start kind of almost shaking.<eos> [Rago] I definitely have a little bit of nervousness going.<eos> How much talking is too much talking?<eos> Is getting personal a bad thing?<eos> Like, "This one was one of the more difficult sites for me to go back to."<eos> [Vevers] Really good to show that it actually affected you.
I'm gonna be rolling your hands like that.<eos> Let me do all of the work.<eos> It makes it easier for everybody.<eos> What were you all doing today?<eos> We were worrying all day.<eos> But today, I was paying for everything, bills, etc.<eos> Nika, we will get through this.<eos> Oh, you have new glasses!<eos> Not that new.<eos> I have some sad news to tell you.
It didn't perform as it did during testing.<eos> It was really kind of down to me, and I kind of failed at the last second.<eos> ThebestthingaboutMars and why everybody wants to go to Mars is because we have rovers there.<eos> We have machines, examples, everything from it that says, "Hey come, come to Mars, come to Mars."<eos> Can this be one of our layers?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You can use that as one of your layers!<eos> OK, we're naming it Neil Applestrong.<eos> Applenaut training, so that's where we have an astronaut that's a green apple and we make a space suit for it.<eos> Areallygoodway to look at a space suit is it has to keep you alive with oxygen and pressure.
Come on in my office.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I apologize, Sergeant.<eos> I was with the Chief of Patrol.<eos> There was a mistake on my transfer order.<eos> They thought I was moving to another district, so...<eos> Okay, just so you know, you're on short paper up here.<eos> That means grunt work, tech stuff, writing warrants, just till you prove yourself.
Okay, let's call Duke, have him take CSU down there to process, then we'll have to question everybody there;<eos> I'm thinking our killer probably worked with our Vic here.<eos> Yeah, you might want to pump your brakes there, chief.<eos> You're talking about car salesmen here.<eos> So what?<eos> They are masters of psychological warfare.<eos> Coupled with the fact that they're all born liars.<eos> You never bought a car before?<eos> They'll lie to you just to make conversation.<eos> You can question them till you're blue in the face, they're never gonna give you a straight answer.
Come on.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Hold on, Bob.<eos> You still think I'm a car salesman?<eos> Bob.<eos> Time to pack it up there, Roy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> Chin, something about this doesn't add up.<eos> Doesn't it seem odd to you that Mitch would be this desperate to get one car back?
Yeah, Kumbaya.<eos> Actually... I did want to say thank you.<eos> What you did for me yesterday, coming all the way down to Mexico, that was above and beyond.<eos> And I think it was a violation of your parole as well.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't have to say anything.<eos> Actually, you know what, I do.<eos> Listen, man... when you and Kono first got together, I was hard on you.<eos> I'll always do what I can to protect my family, you know.<eos> But time and again I've watched you put her first.<eos> And when you came down to Mexico and put yourself on the line for me... it meant a lot.
Thanks, Max.<eos> What brings you around in the neighborhood?<eos> I'm... here about the rental.<eos> Yes... well, I was just gauging the temperature of the local leasing market.<eos> Sabrina and I are thinking about upgrading to a bigger space.<eos> You know, Max, I hear your dollar goes a long way in Africa.<eos> Come on, Max, I mean, it wasn't-wasn't too hard to piece together.<eos> And it wasn't just you hiring a new M.E. or-or listing your apartment;<eos> The minute you got back, I had a feeling we'd be having this conversation, because you changed when you went away, Max.<eos> It was clear that that experience really affected you.
- Let her go.<eos> She's a fine woman, highly talented.<eos> You may quote me, my dear.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'll come visit ya, Bill.<eos> - Go.<eos> Shit!<eos> - I need hardly remind you that I never miss.<eos> Your gun, please, and mine.<eos> - You think you're gonna get away with this, Bill?
I didn't know where i was gonna live from one day to another.<eos> - Why am I not surprised?<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> - How much?<eos> - How much what?<eos> - I know you, Bill,<eos> $200 and you forget you ever knew me.<eos> - Now, hold on.<eos> I gain nothin' by telling your Mr. poe anything.<eos> I'm pleased to see you so happy.
- Do I need to remind you of our arrangement?<eos> - Ben, put a goddamn cork in that bottle and sit it on its side facing me.<eos> I see a lot of you sons of bitches violating' the no-guns ordinance.<eos> So I'm gonna explain it to you real simple by uncorking that bottle there.<eos> Anyone else beside me do that?<eos> If not, kindly head to the bar. Give your guns to Ben for safekeeping.<eos> - I'd like to give it a try, Mr. marshal.<eos> - Put another cork in the bottle, Ben.<eos> - Spin it.<eos> - What do they call you, son?
Boy's runnin' all of my customers out of town.<eos> - Now, listen to me, you son of a bitch.<eos> Ain't no one stopping' them boys from drinkin' the swill you call whiskey.<eos> - Now, you listen to me.<eos> If it weren't for my businesses, you wouldn't have no goddamn town.<eos> You'd just blow away in the dust.<eos> Ain't right messin' with a man's livelihood.<eos> And I'd hate to see your young marshal meet with some unhealthy accident while he's performing his duties.<eos> - I stand by my decision.<eos> Now get your ass off my property. Before I put a bullet in you.
- Let's, uh, make this drink for long nights of no rest.<eos> - Little Arkansas, I'm callin' you out.<eos> I'll be in the street waiting'.<eos> - Well, sorry about that rude interruption.<eos> Save the last dance for me.<eos> - Drop your guns or I'm gonna arrest you.<eos> - You want my guns?<eos> Okay.<eos> Take 'em.<eos> - What you lack in sense, you certainly make up for in gumption.
- You have been misinformed, sir.<eos> I never shoot a man in the back.<eos> How 'bout a compromise?<eos> What do you say to a drink?<eos> - I say all right.<eos> You know, there's a rumor going around about you, says that you were a yankee spy during the war.<eos> - It was a stupid war.<eos> - Well, you know the only way you're gonna get these guns off me, marshal, is if ya kill me.<eos> - I'm considering' it.<eos> If I let you loose, pretty soon every bowlegged son of a bitch is gonna be wearin' his guns, too.
- Do what?<eos> You want me to be a lawman?<eos> - Pay is a $100 a month, a lot more than a drover makes.<eos> What do ya say, little Arkansas?<eos> - Well, I say poe offered me $500 for just one day of work.<eos> - There's two ways you're leavin' this office wearing' those guns of yours, feet first,<eos> or wearing' that badge.<eos> - Can I ask you somethin', marshal? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Why do you call me Arkansas?<eos> - 'Cause if you were John Wesley hardin, we'd have to hang you.
- I usually take a different route on these patrols, keep the bushwhackers guessing'.<eos> - Why the shotgun?<eos> Seems to me a rifle would be a little more accurate.<eos> - Well, this here's what i call preventative medicine.<eos> Sawed-off filled with blue whistles is a mighty fine deterrent.<eos> - Well, I've never had to shoot twice at the same man.<eos> - There's somethin' you gotta learn about gunfightin'.<eos> - Oh, yeah, what's that?<eos> - No matter how fast you are, there's always someone faster.<eos> The more you use your gun, the sooner you're gonna run into that man.
And for the lady of the house, fresh-cut flowers, all the way from Kansas City.<eos> - Joey, give it back, it's dangerous.<eos> - Ah, mom. - Now!<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Tend to your chores.<eos> - Do as your mother says, boy.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Your flowers are also unwelcome and a mistake.<eos> - You're the one makin' a mistake, Mattie.<eos> You can't marry that man.
You lyin' to me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Can I help you, son?<eos> - I think my demons have finally caught up with me.<eos> - Every man has demons, son.<eos> A man's demons though quiet are never quite silent.<eos> She was my light, the thing that kept the demons in the dark.<eos> - I'm, I'm sorry.<eos> - Only god can forgive you now, you son of a bitch.
We needed this.<eos> We did.<eos> It's just hard for me to relax sometimes.<eos> I get so worried about the kids and...<eos> I know. But everything's good.<eos> The kids are great. Everything's fine.<eos> The kids are great?<eos> Oh, come on. Here we go.<eos> No, I just want to hear why you think the kids are so great.<eos> Why are you getting upset?
I mean, who cares? Sam wants to date. That's good.<eos> That's a good thing. He's 18.<eos> It'd be weird if he didn't want to date.<eos> Because, Doug, it's not just dating.<eos> First it's dating, and then he's graduating, and then he's moving out into the world.<eos> We can't protect him, and that's terrifying.<eos> That's what we want for him.<eos> There's a lot we want that aren't possible for him.<eos> I'm the one that's been with him for these last 18 years.<eos> You've never been close to him. You don't even try.
I'm really good at fixing computers, and biology is my favorite subject in school.<eos> I love penguins, but I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> I've never had sex before, and I have a pet turtle named Edison, who's named after Thomas Edison, but he's not as smart.<eos> You're hilarious.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You never had sex?<eos> No.<eos> Want to?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I just came to see if you changed your mind about going out with me.
You're a good guy.<eos> You're sensitive, and you're funny, and the woman who ends up with you will be lucky.<eos> You want to marry your best friend.<eos> Edison?<eos> No.<eos> Not your turtle, Sam.<eos> You said my best friend. He's my best friend.<eos> I just...<eos> I meant you want to be with someone who appreciates you for what you are.<eos> You know, who loves all the little odd things about you... who gets you.
Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so I wanted you to come home to something nice.<eos> Oh, that is so thoughtful.<eos> Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was the best rosé you'd ever had?<eos> Yeah, I remember us driving up there, going to the winery and... that's it.<eos> And this wine is why.<eos> Oh. Hey, what smells so good?<eos> I made your favorite: pizza bagels!<eos> Pink wine and pizza bagels?<eos> It's like eighth grade all over again.<eos> I am so lucky to have you.
This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about it.<eos> No, No, no, no. Let's talk about it.<eos> I'm the one who's made all the effort in this relationship since day one.<eos> Please tell me what more I could do. Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe I'll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.<eos> Fine, go ahead.<eos> Amy is free.<eos> She had a harp lesson on Saturday, but it got canceled...<eos> Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.
Thank you.<eos> You're sad, so I made you tea.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And it's just the way you like it.<eos> Earl Grey? Yes.<eos> Honey?<eos> Yes. Unsweetened almond-- Good Lord!<eos> I made you tea.<eos> Sorry, thank you.<eos> Well, what can we do to cheer you up?
Would you like to play a driving game I invented?<eos> Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?<eos> Never mind.<eos> You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you.<eos> Are you sure you should be going there?<eos> I don't want to wait two days for us to work this out.<eos> Very well.<eos> You got married spur of the moment.<eos> I don't see why your divorce should be any different.<eos> I would pull this car over and kick you out, but... if Penny dumps me, you're all I got.
Other unacceptable responses include: "It's nothing,"<eos> "Don't worry about it," and "I said it's nothing, don't worry about it."<eos> I think this all looks good.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Oh, well. Great, then.<eos> Here.<eos> You sign here, date here.<eos> And, Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you're accepting Leonard in "as is" condition.<eos> I remember signing our first Relationship Agreement. Mm.<eos> You seem to be forgetting the "no nostalgia" clause.
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,<eos> Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews on his sister Hortense's side with Quackmore Duck twice removed!<eos> And you are?<eos> Oh, right. Webby van der Quack.<eos> My granny's the housekeeper.<eos> Wait! Are we...<eos> friends now?<eos> If we say yes, will you let us live?<eos> Good one, new best friend!<eos> So, friend, what do you do for fun around here?
There are four of us and three of them.<eos> If we... wait, never mind.<eos> They teamed up.<eos> Ah, good, that means only one target.<eos> No, get back!<eos> You're old!<eos> Oi, beastie!<eos> What's it gonna take to shuffle you off to the afterlife?<eos> The head of Scrooge McDuck!<eos> Would you settle for his hat?
♪ Dew!<eos> And now you know ♪<eos> Nailed it!<eos> Sure, if you want to do it the easy way.<eos> Why wouldn't you want to do it the easy way?<eos> You've got to work smarter, lad, not harder.<eos> Ugh, "lad."<eos> I don't call you "old man" or "Scotty McTophat."<eos> Respect your elder.<eos> When you adventure with Scrooge McDuck...
Whoa! Oh, hej, Beakley!<eos> Take 'em down!<eos> Ojda.<eos> We gotta stop the water!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!<eos> Not the time, Donald.<eos> Crazy old man!<eos> All you care about is your next adventure.
Granny, I can explain.<eos> Dear, you are safer in a sunken city with Scrooge McDuck than you are locked in a vault in Fort Knox.<eos> No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.<eos> - Now, Donald, don't...<eos> - Stop.<eos> I admit I'm a little overprotective.<eos> A little? !<eos> No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.<eos> - Uncle Donald?<eos> - It might be okay if the boys saw you every once in a while.
Eliot, please understand. I had a life before you came. I had no idea if you even would come.<eos> Fillory is my home, and I care about it.<eos> - So you became a terrorist?<eos> - We're not violent.<eos> I'd call your ex-boyfriend trying to strangle me<eos> - a little bit violent!<eos> We were close, yes, but hurting people was never the plan.<eos> - I have no idea who you are.<eos> - I'm your wife.<eos> - Because your father made you. - I could've walked out of here
We were close, yes, but hurting people was never the plan.<eos> - I have no idea who you are.<eos> - I'm your wife.<eos> - Because your father made you. - I could've walked out of here<eos> - a long time ago.<eos> - Then why didn't you?<eos> If you hate us so much... if you hate me so much... - why didn't you?<eos> - Because I don't.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You think I stayed, because you're just so deeply attracted to me?
- My husband said,<eos> "Don't bother me, because I'm too crazy right now."<eos> Come on.<eos> We gonna finish this or what?<eos> What... what are...<eos> What is that? Don't be scared.<eos> I don't know what you want from me, okay?<eos> 'Kay.<eos> I want you to start by understanding something, and I... I...<eos> I don't expect you to like the idea of this, but you're going to have that baby.
Reno, baby!<eos> Cheaper strippers, cheaper shots, two Bubba Gumps.<eos> Not gonna happen, kemosabe.<eos> Okay, well, Bakersfield, baby?<eos> Santa Fe?<eos> Cincinnati?<eos> -What's going on, bro?<eos> -It's Valentine's Day.<eos> Man, what is it with you and Valentine's Day?<eos> Why do you care so much about this stupid holiday?
Impossible, Rogue Nation,<eos> -The Sum of all Fears.<eos> -Those are just movies!<eos> This is real life.<eos> So, do it!<eos> You're right!<eos> Santa!<eos> [men and women screaming] [gasps] [grunting] Curse that damn song.<eos> Don't you dare die on me, Santa.<eos> Hey, Michael, you mustn't worry about me.
♪ I know exactly how it feels ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause, baby ♪<eos> ♪ Ba... ♪ [holding note]<eos> He's doing it!<eos> [rumbling, wind whistling] [man] It's so close.<eos> Did we make it?<eos> Michael, you did all you could.<eos> We just ran out of fertile women.<eos> [whispers] I'm sorry, Michael.<eos> [woman] I think you're forgetting someone.
What do you want?<eos> Sorry to commandeer your vessel, Captain, but I'm afraid for what I have planned, you can't be in Storybrooke.<eos> Emma, are you there?<eos> Gideon... he sent me away.<eos> I would never leave you.<eos> What the hell do I have to do?<eos> Kill the Black Fairy.<eos> Did she harm you?<eos> She toughened me up.<eos> What did she do to you?
Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.<eos> Look what the tide brought in.<eos> Captain Hook.<eos> Evening, Blackbeard.<eos> By the sand on your britches, I'd say someone's been passed out on the beach again.<eos> It's part of a long journey home.<eos> A journey that's now interrupting my game.<eos> Judging by your dwindling chips, I'd say I've done you a favor.
Then I have no choice.<eos> With just a bit of magic, I can turn you vermin into... well... vermin.<eos> I didn't take it!<eos> It wasn't me!<eos> Please!<eos> Innocent or not, you're about to be something far more important... an example.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> It was me. It was me.<eos> Well, then, little bug, it's time you learned your lesson, then.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
Those trances... they'll become more frequent, more intense.<eos> He might even end up in a cell right next to me.<eos> Well, what can I do to help?<eos> You can start by giving me what I want.<eos> - We got to get behind this thing so we can smash it back to Hell.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> Do you know how dangerous it is to even hint at what you want to do to Mother?<eos> If my transgression protects the ones I care about, then it's all worth it.<eos> Protects them from what?<eos> Haven't you ever wondered why the Black Fairy is collecting all this dust?
What do you suggest we do?<eos> There's someone in another realm who can help us... a brave hero called The Savior.<eos> We just need to reach her, Gideon.<eos> How?<eos> I've heard rumors of a crystal ball... a magical orb that would allow us to communicate across the realms.<eos> If you'll help me.<eos> Over here.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> I already told you.
Mother.<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I led you here... just as I led your friend to my key.<eos> This whole thing... it was a test, wasn't it?<eos> From the moment you arrived, you were supposed to be different, Gideon.<eos> You were a gift... my loyal son.<eos> Gift?<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!<eos> I'm the one who took you in, gave you a home, taught you, fed you, shared with you everything that I had!
Gift?<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!<eos> I'm the one who took you in, gave you a home, taught you, fed you, shared with you everything that I had!<eos> And this is how you repay me?<eos> I am so disappointed in you, Gideon.<eos> No.<eos> You can't intimidate me anymore.<eos> I should have stood up to you years ago.<eos> Oh, Gideon. How many times do I have to tell you?
I am so disappointed in you, Gideon.<eos> No.<eos> You can't intimidate me anymore.<eos> I should have stood up to you years ago.<eos> Oh, Gideon. How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> You are not a hero.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And I know you've been hoarding the Black Fairy Dust.<eos> And I know you're planning to do something terrible with it.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you.
Yes, I am.<eos> And I know you've been hoarding the Black Fairy Dust.<eos> And I know you're planning to do something terrible with it.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you.<eos> These people have suffered long enough.<eos> Have they?<eos> No, no, no, no, no! Stop!<eos> As far as I can see, this one's just begun to suffer.<eos> No!<eos> How dare you use that on me!
You're a hero, Ms. Swan.<eos> Gideon is my son.<eos> You can't keep cleaning up his messes, Gold.<eos> He needs to take responsibility for his actions.<eos> Are you threatening my child?<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> He's tried to kill me twice.<eos> I'm not gonna give him a third chance.<eos> All right, Savior.<eos> If you cross my son, I will do what I must to stop you.
Yeah, but doing him would be worth it to me.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Brother!<eos> Look around you.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> Look at these kids.<eos> Showing these people what's right, being an example, that's who you are.<eos> That's how you've lived.<eos> Right until this moment.<eos> That's exactly what they've seen you as, an example.
Have you had any anxiety about coming back to work?<eos> No, because I'm ready.<eos> And there's really only one way to find out for sure.<eos> That's not really how we do things here.<eos> We?<eos> What do you mean by "we"?<eos> Now it's your decision to make?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> What do I need to do to prove it to you?
It was not easy getting these countries to agree on anything, so it is nice to know that one of my kids listens to me.<eos> Actually, I was listening to Russell Jackson.<eos> Okay, yesterday, he made me Soledad Penagos's White House liaison.<eos> - That is so exciting! - Hey!<eos> So I've been up all night, and I'm learning everything I can about the peace deal and the... trade agreements.<eos> Is that work?<eos> Because if it is, you said you would give me a ride.<eos> - You cannot bail! Because I don't have a car today.<eos> - I can, I can.<eos> - I can if you hurry and we go right now.
- He said it was urgent.<eos> - ...right now?<eos> - Hey. - How's it going?<eos> So this is finally happening.<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> Ian.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Like I'm about to jump into the deep end of the crazy pool.<eos> You go ahead and joke all you want.<eos> Just make sure you got it locked down when you meet these guys tomorrow.
Good morning.<eos> How'd it go with Abby?<eos> Uh... about like you'd expect.<eos> She felt terrible that she hadn't told me about her and Scott.<eos> It's true?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> She said it started with him being a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Nothing physical's happened yet.<eos> But, uh she said that, uh, she wants to see where it goes.<eos> With a guy that would stab you in the back like that?
Everything that we built was just set on fire.<eos> Can we trust Alcala to respond appropriately?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - Which means that we need leverage.<eos> I might know a way inside.<eos> The suit just arrived. Yeah, I heard.<eos> You boys get your story buttoned up?<eos> Actually, I was thinking on telling them what really happened.<eos> And why would you go and do something like that?<eos> You ever stop and wonder how we got here?
You know, a man can only play dumb so many times before everyone starts to believe it.<eos> You just oversaw a security failure of biblical proportions.<eos> Do you want to go down with the ship, or do you want to start helping me?<eos> A file was illegally downloaded to Nolan Burgess' home computer.<eos> We believe the file passed to the Resistance via Nolan's girlfriend.<eos> Katie Bowman's sister?<eos> Yes.<eos> What was in this file?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Your problem is you don't even see the compromises that you've made.<eos> You work with people within the Occupation.<eos> You've got hostiles trying to flank you.<eos> Get ready to pull out.<eos> Sources.<eos> Yes, and you are corrupted by your contact with them.<eos> - Only an amateur would say that.<eos> - I'm proud to be an amateur.<eos> A million professionals were wiped out the day of the Arrival, and you still think those tactics are going to work?<eos> You can't even get a handful of people to follow you.
Alan, always a pleasure.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Forgive me if I cut straight to the point.<eos> I just learned about a certain file that apparently disappeared from this very house.<eos> This situation has raised certain unpleasant questions with Homeland, of course.<eos> They're ready to launch a full investigation.<eos> Unless I play ball.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I save your ass, and this is how you repay me... with some clumsy blackmail attempt?<eos> At least I didn't promise you a level-three job in the Authority and a house in the Green Zone.
The moment you place a bet, you're exposed.<eos> - Were you able to follow her?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Our little bumblebee tracked her all the way home.<eos> - A theater?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Not a bad place for a hideout.<eos> Lots of entrances and exits.<eos> Good job.<eos> I got to tell you, there's a lot of people coming in and out of here.
Sorry, sir. I...<eos> We didn't realize you were here.<eos> Last-minute trip.<eos> Just here for a few days, and I was hoping somebody might have some time - to join me for breakfast. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, sorry, Jax.<eos> Just Hayes this time.<eos> I'll say it again... that's not breakfast.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Time of consumption does not define breakfast versus non-breakfast foods.<eos> That's where you're wrong.
Whoever made that call was either responsible for the attack or knows who is.<eos> I already checked with NYPD.<eos> Call didn't go to 911 dispatch.<eos> Well, if it didn't go through 911, then it had to go to the DHS tip line.<eos> You mean that "If you see something, say something" number on billboards?<eos> We're never gonna get our hands on that recording.<eos> I may have a way.<eos> I can't help you, Max.<eos> Seriously, Reese?<eos> After my dad helped you get assigned to the 127th after we graduated from the academy?
Why couldn't you just be honest with me?<eos> Why is there always an agenda with you?<eos> That's not just me, Bug.<eos> That's everyone.<eos> - That's Wallace.<eos> - Okay, Dad.<eos> You have no idea about our relationship.<eos> I love him.<eos> I know you do.<eos> And he loves you, too.

The best way to defend this country is to eradicate all Muslims before they eradicate us.<eos> But innocent or guilty, Rodney Landon needs to stay in prison.<eos> A rumor started that Landon was getting out for snitching on other inmates.<eos> A skinhead attacked him.<eos> Landon stabbed the guy with a shiv.<eos> He isn't getting out of prison anytime soon.<eos> Bad guy stays off the street.<eos> Sounds like a win to me.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Part of what he loves about you is that you're my daughter.
Well, I don't care if you review Gerald's case.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why did you lie to me?<eos> You've been distant since your dad left town.<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - Hayes.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> My father said something... about us.<eos> The alpha-dog thing?<eos> You said you didn't care about that.
The jury really doesn't like you right now, Gerald.<eos> Did you see their faces?<eos> Put me on the stand.<eos> I'll explain.<eos> I do that, and the prosecutor paints you as a sick, adultering deviant.<eos> He'll make you list every man you slept with, have a field day.<eos> Why does any of this matter?<eos> I loved Claire.<eos> She saw me, and she loved me anyway.<eos> I love you, too.
Now, come on, Bob.<eos> You don't have to be a coward every waking day of your life.<eos> You can grow a pair of low-hanging fruit.<eos> That one never gets dusted.<eos> - Just saved your life.<eos> - The hell did you do?<eos> Calm down. Look at their hands.<eos> They were gonna shoot you in the back.<eos> They made a deal with the governor.<eos> A full pardon for killing you.
You want to come on in here so I can tell you what for.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Dude, we're in a posse with the Lone Ranger.<eos> Yeah, well, don't get too excited.<eos> They're not gonna be happy with us when this is all over.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> We're not gonna let 'em arrest Jesse James.<eos> I'm gonna shoot him myself.<eos> What?<eos> Well, one, you gave Bass your word, and, two, does the casualness with which we talk about murder ever bother you?
Bloody wonderful!<eos> But then something happened.<eos> Rittenhouse happened.<eos> They enlisted you.<eos> Threatened the people you loved if you refused to help them.<eos> Uh, Emma?<eos> - You trailed off. - Oh, sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just... tired.<eos> It took its toll on you, the things Rittenhouse told you, the things they must have made you do.
I ran too.<eos> After they killed my family.<eos> But then one day I realized that I couldn't run anymore, that I had to fight.<eos> No, it doesn't matter.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No. You don't, actually.<eos> I know things that Anthony doesn't know, that nobody knows.<eos> The things that they have planned for that machine.<eos> But that's why I'm here, why I came so far to find you.
- Morning glory.<eos> - Stay strong.<eos> You my sunflower?<eos> I'm whatever you want me to be, darling.<eos> What?<eos> - You are transcendent.<eos> - I give you this.<eos> You're cuter than the usual poopie heads that try to break in.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I would never cause you any trouble.
Cyndi, no, get away from her.<eos> Cyndi!<eos> - We love you! - Cyndi, open up!<eos> That is your future, Cindy.<eos> I don't understand, they're supposed to love me.<eos> That's not you.<eos> None of it is.<eos> Look, I watched you on that show.<eos> You are a really sweet, kind, and caring person.<eos> Kinda weird but that's what made you cool.
Monster, Egyptian god of chaos.<eos> Really bad dude trying to release pure evil into the world.<eos> I kinda miss Pierre.<eos> His chili mac and cheese dogs were so yummy.<eos> Yeah, at least he let you stay in the mansion a few more weeks while he goes to save the restaurant he's been neglecting.<eos> I wanna thank you, Ezekiel.<eos> You made me appreciate that it's okay to be just me.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> You said that we were alike, so how did you finally fix the hole in your heart?<eos> The one that made you want to keep stealing?

You realize your narcissism isn't the reason why that love potion didn't work on you, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, Flynn and I have pretty healthy egos too.<eos> Love potion worked on us. It didn't on you.<eos> Why is that?<eos> 'Cause you already had feelings for her?<eos> Cindy?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Ever since you saw that girl on that TV show, you had a thing for her.<eos> That's why the potion didn't work on you.
I've been summoned to the British embassy.<eos> Another debriefing about Willoughby?<eos> MI6 special-op director's in town on a fact-finding mission.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You good?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Hey, um... any more on Kai Chen?<eos> Gibbs told you not to get involved.
Intel suggests Chen might be on a yacht in the Aegean, off the coast of Greece.<eos> They have a boat under surveillance.<eos> It's hopeful.<eos> If Gibbs finds out you're working on this and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.<eos> I'm willing to take that chance.<eos> Hey, Quinn.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mission accomplished.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> How'd you get rid of the crack?
I-I completely forgot.<eos> I-I remember you were elected, but-but the-the where somehow eluded me.<eos> You're looking well, Donald.<eos> You'll be happy to know that Jimmy filled your position with the Sherlocks seamlessly.<eos> I had little doubt. The Sherlocks?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Wait, you know this guy?<eos> Even longer story.<eos> Don't sweat jurisdiction, Gibbs.<eos> I was the one who called you in.
I think it's better if we don't show him our cards.<eos> I'm with Walt.<eos> I think we do this one covertly.<eos> Look at that.<eos> The two of you just agreed on something.<eos> Hey, Quinn.<eos> What are you doing down here? I'm sifting through every unsolved burglary in the tri-state area and trying to find a pattern.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> You came down here so you could hang out with all these old solved cases and hopefully get some good juju.<eos> What brings you down here?
No. We should all get credit.<eos> And can we wrap this up?<eos> I have a meeting in L.A. tomorrow.<eos> I'd rather not cancel on Johnny.<eos> Depp. He starred in my first film.<eos> Yes.<eos> The only one that saw critical and financial success.<eos> But what was that, ten years ago?<eos> Look, you write great concepts, okay?<eos> I mean, that's why Earl recruited you in the first place. But... your films fail to connect with audiences.

Ooh, I was hoping you did that.<eos> Ooh, make that two boo-boos.<eos> All right, let's see what we got.<eos> .22-caliber semiauto.<eos> My Lincoln penny collection.<eos> Rosebud?<eos> I'd never been shot before.<eos> I was afraid to go to the E.R.<eos> I hear that's where you guys always look.<eos> What made you want this? What do you mean?
- Open door three.<eos> No more surprises.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And a major break in two high-profile cases today as a spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, known as NCIS, reports the recovery of...<eos> So, has Hollywood called yet for the movie rights?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I'm not selling mine unless Denzel Washington plays me.<eos> How's that for raising my profile?<eos> Forget your profile.<eos> I'm done pushing you.
I have to say, Nick, for someone who's lied for a living, you sure have a lot of opinions about lying.<eos> Lying undercover is nothing like real life. Okay?<eos> For one thing, actual lives are at stake.<eos> Well, sometimes in real life, too.<eos> Oh, like, uh... like with your family, Alex?<eos> Like all that necessary evil stuff?<eos> Hmm? What are you not telling us?<eos> Just keep it moving, sister, nothing to see here.<eos> What is it Mark Twain said?<eos> "If you always tell the truth, you never have to remember anything"?
She's actually the reason I came to see you, Gunny.<eos> She in some sort of trouble?<eos> Laura's dying, Jethro.<eos> We... we need your help.<eos> My dad tracked you down?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> But he wouldn't fill me in.<eos> He said that you wanted to talk to me yourself.<eos> It's been a long time, Gibbs.<eos> It's probably not how you remember me, is it? Well, you probably forget

Well, you probably forget<eos> I was the one who drove you to the hospital after you crashed your bike into that tree in front of my house.
Oh, yeah, that was it.<eos> Sounds like sour grapes.<eos> Nicole knows I was the best thing that ever happened to her.<eos> She also mentioned that you were the one that gave Petty Officer Collins a black eye.<eos> Hey, what's the matter?<eos> Can't stand a lot of competition?<eos> Oh, I don't think there's really any competition there.<eos> Collins was smarter... more successful, better liked by the crew.<eos> You think I give a damn?<eos> I think it drove you crazy.
If the weather wants to kill me, it'll have to take a number.<eos> At least take that.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Okay, I...<eos> I vote we just bite the bullet, apologize and move on.<eos> Sound like a plan?<eos> Okay, I'll go first.<eos> When you receive a terminal diagnosis, things suddenly become very clear.<eos> You realize that time... is your most precious commodity, and because of that, I tend to speak more matter-of-factly.<eos> I mean, if... if what I said offended you, I...
It's my surface warfare pin.<eos> Some serious blood, sweat and tears went into earning it.<eos> Mm.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> Me? Wouldn't you rather your dad?<eos> No.<eos> He's a marine.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I want you to have it for the same reason<eos> Sofia gave you that photo. It wasn't about giving you something to remember her by.
Sofia gave you that photo. It wasn't about giving you something to remember her by.<eos> It was her way of saying she'll remember you, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I do have a stipulation.<eos> No matter how little time the doctors say you have you keep fighting every day... for the next day.<eos> And the next, and the next.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a little stipulation of my own.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> When you look at that pin, I don't want it to remind you of some girl who died.
What?<eos> Sad little orphan, bumbling around.<eos> I'm not sad.<eos> You sure as hell didn't call anyone to tell them you're bunking here tonight.<eos> Did you?<eos> You're feeling sorry for me for being alone?<eos> I'm right where I want to be, kid.<eos> This is my sweet spot.<eos> Thought you wanted to eat in peace.<eos> I do. Fact, I'll buy you one, if it'll keep you quiet.
He's not here.<eos> Right.<eos> Damn.<eos> You've got good instincts, Reeves.<eos> Need to use them.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You were with this guy for two days, and you don't know where he is.<eos> What, and you do?<eos> He told me he didn't care about seeing the memorial.<eos> He also told you to open your ears, that's not what he said.
Well, I have more.<eos> The, uh, the ransom page itself, it doesn't have any typos.<eos> The Russian hackers' demands tend to be full of misspellings or improper syntax, but this is grammatically perfect.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Well, my counterpart, Clint Asher, who works for your government, operates out of Langley.<eos> If he can't help you, no one can.<eos> And this is where it all happens.<eos> Well, it's certainly very orange.<eos> Yeah. And there she is.<eos> Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
What do I know?<eos> That he's dead?<eos> Dad's dead?<eos> You know, three years ago?<eos> You remember?<eos> Remember?<eos> You-you know that. You live here alone?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Of course I know.<eos> Why are you even telling me that? Well, you didn't, you didn't remember.
That he's dead?<eos> Dad's dead?<eos> You know, three years ago?<eos> You remember?<eos> Remember?<eos> You-you know that. You live here alone?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Of course I know.<eos> Why are you even telling me that? Well, you didn't, you didn't remember.<eos> You don't remember a lot.
Tell me.<eos> Tell you what?<eos> What you're hiding.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Where to start?<eos> The truth.<eos> What if I'm not sure I know it anymore?<eos> We find it.<eos> I can't help unless you help yourself.
All right.<eos> How about this one?<eos> Is that different from the last one?<eos> Yeah, this one is onyx, last one was midnight.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> It's nice.<eos> That's it?<eos> Nice?<eos> Honey, it's your tux.<eos> I'll love whatever you choose, but you need to make a decision.
Do you have any idea why McGee would invite me to his home for dinner tonight?<eos> Why?<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, it... it's not the invitation, it's the wording of the e-mail.<eos> He marked it "personal" and...<eos> I was asked not to tell anybody.<eos> Yet you're telling me. Well, you're not anybody.<eos> And... and it's just odd.<eos> Short notice, the secrecy.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, they invited me.
You mean, like, like, right now?<eos> Like, right here?<eos> Right here in Tony's creepy old apartment, Nick.<eos> Just replace bad karma with good.<eos> Abby, you're still my best person.<eos> Unfortunately, we had a bit of a problem getting Delilah's sister on a flight out to London, so...<eos> What do you say, Gibbs?<eos> Be my man of honor?<eos> Be my honor.<eos> Well, in that case, may I be the one to give you away?
Let me guess.<eos> "Fun"?<eos> You like this place so much, you just had to tell the world.<eos> I get it.<eos> This is Sergeant Dawson calling in vandalism on Pine Trail.<eos> Suspect fleeing north on foot.<eos> Copy that, Sergeant.<eos> Told you, Jasper. This place is fun.<eos> Give it up, kid, before you get hurt!
You did say you were hungry.<eos> - Wait, I know you.<eos> - I...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Yes, yes, yes,<eos> You are a government man.<eos> Please, keep your voice down, huh?<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> If the rich government man donates to the knife show. Knife show?<eos> You've got a long way before you turn pro.
This is no ordinary case.<eos> It involves one of our own.<eos> I need everyone at the top of their game.<eos> I'm always at the top of my game.<eos> I like your attitude, Torres.<eos> But you're sitting this one out.<eos> Quinn, can I count on you for drinks and balloons?<eos> On it. Hey.<eos> What's, uh, going on?<eos> Nothing that concerns you.
Oh, and you lived here rent free with a guy for years.<eos> A guy?<eos> Do you mean my baby?<eos> He's still a guy.<eos> (Chuckles) She's got you there, honey.<eos> Mandy, they had to help Kristin.<eos> She completely screwed up her life.<eos> Wait.<eos> I-I-I'm doing great now.<eos> Yeah, 'cause Dad handed you a cushy job.
We're both cleared to be here.<eos> We promise it won't interfere with your instruction.<eos> We're investigating the nearby death of a man last night.<eos> His remains were found in the aftermath of an explosion in an abandoned building.<eos> I'm happy to help.<eos> So, what does this have to do with me?<eos> The body is one of your former recruits.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Alex, she lied to you, kicked your ass, and left you for dead, and that's just today.<eos> Not to mention what she did to you at The Farm.
Unh, unh, unh. Don't move.<eos> It's done.<eos> I had a feeling it was you.<eos> All this time...<eos> I knew you were AIC.<eos> I was not. And I'm still not.<eos> I'm a CIA operative defending this country.<eos> After all the violence today, the infighting in our own government, the fact that our very own First Lady was plotting against her country...<eos> But there's a chance here to use what they wanted for a greater good, to burn down the corruption that is eating away at this country and give us the fresh start we need.<eos> I won't let you.
Good.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know what else to ask you anyway.<eos> This whole thing, it's been so, um...<eos> You could have escaped.<eos> When those trucks blew, you were close to the perimeter.<eos> You didn't have stay.<eos> To save a bunch of people who didn't believe you, who didn't see what you had seen coming?<eos> Why?<eos> No one can see what's coming.<eos> Yeah, but all that time after you left The Farm, when you wouldn't let go, you just kept pushing, researching, even after I told you it was crazy over and over again.
I'll call you when I call you.<eos> And I'll answer when you do.<eos> Okay, I've got to go.<eos> Yeah, I have a meeting at Langley.<eos> I have an interview.<eos> I will always love you.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> You know my feelings about Claire Haas.<eos> It's Madam President.<eos> And I told you, she's not who you think she is.
Previously on "Shooter"...<eos> What can I do for you, Captain?<eos> Ten days ago, a CIA agent was shot by a sniper.<eos> We believe this is the work of T. Solotov.<eos> I know that you don't like to talk about this stuff, but what happened to Donnie, I know that it still hurts you.
Yes, you are.<eos> Your job is great for our sex life, but not so great for my job.<eos> Tell the senator you had an interdepartmental meeting.<eos> Is that what we're calling this?<eos> It sounds better than a nooner.<eos> Gun takes a little getting used to.<eos> Not that it isn't sexy, just slightly emasculating.<eos> You're the man, I'm just a secretary with a badge.<eos> You are a Senior Special Agent with the FBI, and that is a hell of a lot more than a secretary.<eos> At least they moved you to D.C. They can't keep you behind a desk forever.

They can't keep you behind a desk forever.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The FBI invented the desk so that agents would have something to sit behind.<eos> And I didn't ask for this transfer.<eos> Nobody would knowingly want to work for The Office of Personnel Management.<eos> Well, the road to the top is not always straight.<eos> And if they didn't transfer you, you wouldn't have met me.
What happens to him now?<eos> He gets sent home under a flag.<eos> - Alone?<eos> That doesn't seem right.<eos> I hate leaving him here.<eos> Look, I'll fly home as soon as I can, okay?<eos> You fly home with Kevin, just see if Dobbs can go with you.<eos> I think that'd be a good idea.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
- That's the shock.<eos> I'm gonna get you someplace safe.<eos> Okay.<eos> - All right, come on.<eos> - I'm gonna get you out of here.<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.<eos> Gonna tighten it.<eos> - You need a doctor. - Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> _<eos> I'll find someone who can help you.
- Memphis?<eos> - Yeah. She somehow got us a military transport, so we're headed there right now and Yusuf is with us.<eos> Do you have any idea when you're coming home?<eos> Dobbs and I are gonna go check on Rodriguez at the hospital.<eos> Hopefully we're on a plane tomorrow.<eos> What about Kevin?<eos> Not leaving without him.<eos> Well, hurry home, okay?<eos> We need you. I promise I will, baby.<eos> Love you. Love you too.
That's my resignation.<eos> It's signed and dated 90 days from now.<eos> If we haven't found the mole by then, you won't even have to ask me to leave.<eos> Is this Natalie Grant?<eos> I met Natalie at the Promenade.<eos> Some dive bar.<eos> Natalie! Wait!<eos> Natalie!<eos> Natalie, who do you work for?<eos> Where did you meet them?
I mean, you've had a whole year to upgrade.<eos> I'm not looking for, like, a barista with a bow tie offering me lattes, but maybe you could get coffee better than what it is they serve in the vending machine of my carwash.<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Oh, that depends.<eos> You gonna go get my captain? Deeks, I already told you, he's not available.<eos> Yeah, I remember when you said that earlier.<eos> You know, as a cop, you know what I use more than any of my training?<eos> Intuition.<eos> And you, you know, being the diligent, finely-dressed- in-that-pant-suit cop that you are probably use the same thing, so what's yours telling you right now?
I'll tell you what. You let me out of here, and I'll do my job.<eos> And yours.<eos> Any chance of showing me some mercy and getting rid of these?<eos> I don't think I'm going anywhere fast in my current condition.<eos> Yeah, I can absolutely help you out.<eos> As long as you help us out.<eos> We know you were working with Natalie.<eos> We know Natalie was working with Carl Brown.<eos> We also know that you're taking orders from someone.<eos> What makes you so sure?
We know Natalie was working with Carl Brown.<eos> We also know that you're taking orders from someone.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> 'Cause that someone told you to pin the attack on Granger.<eos> She presumably took a beating for the cause.<eos> She may not be easy to break.<eos> And we don't have much time.<eos> We also found evidence of drugs at the scene.<eos> So we know that's how you got Granger unconscious, so that you could take a beating and frame it on him.<eos> Unless you have a different explanation, I'm thinking it's time to face up to the facts that whoever you're working for no longer needs your services.
That is the Galra way.<eos> Morvok! [grunts]<eos> [Allura] There's no point in debating this further.<eos> Zarkon is clearly tracking us through me.<eos> [Lance] Aww, space baloney.<eos> [Pidge] That's not possible.<eos> Why would that be so hard to believe?<eos> Zarkon's forces showed up on Arus only after I awoke.<eos> She's got a point.<eos> I would absolutely travel across the galaxy to find you.
I might ask you the same thing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just walking.<eos> Late at night.<eos> Near the pods.<eos> In full Paladin armor, with a bag of your belongings?<eos> I have to know if Zarkon is tracking me.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> Don't try to stop me.<eos> I'm not going to stop you.
You're not stranded anymore.<eos> We will save your people.<eos> I believe you, for I have heard many legends of the valor of Voltron.<eos> Five brave Paladins dedicated to this...<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I count only four of you.<eos> Are you not Voltron?<eos> Uh... almost?<eos> Where is the fifth Paladin?<eos> He's not here, but we can still help you.
Well, while you're working on that... the rest of us need to find some new teludav lenses... otherwise we won't be able to travel via wormhole.<eos> -Is that something we have to mail order?<eos> -Does anyone even make those anymore?<eos> [Allura] I don't know.<eos> Only a few Alteans could use the teludav 10,000 ago.<eos> They may not exist anymore.<eos> I think I may know where we can get some.<eos> Coran!<eos> You're not suggesting going to one of those filthy swap moons!<eos> The last time you went, those space pirates took you for everything you had.
It's not stolen.<eos> Then tell me where you got it.<eos> Hey! Come back with that!<eos> Trouble at the Slice Capades?<eos> It's one of those pirates!<eos> I knew they looked edgy.<eos> Varkon's comin' for ya!<eos> [Shiro] So this was Zarkon's home planet.<eos> Show me more.<eos> [Shiro] King Alford built you from that comet.
Is that a lot?<eos> Well, compared to what we have, which is none, yes. It's a lot.<eos> We're gonna find some money.<eos> Come on!<eos> Don't sell that!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I never sell anything.<eos> Do I, Kaltenecker?<eos> Ah, one of the Unilu.<eos> Like, can I help you?
Ah, one of the Unilu.<eos> Like, can I help you?<eos> Yes. Can you tell me where the "other" market is?<eos> The what?<eos> Well, some might call it the "black market."<eos> I don't think I know that.<eos> Maybe check there.<eos> I don't think this would be "on" the map.<eos> It might be more "off-book."<eos> Maybe this will help you remember?
Two may enter.<eos> Come unarmed.<eos> Why would they insist we come unarmed?<eos> Shiro, this doesn't feel right.<eos> We've come too far to turn back now.<eos> They just sent us a route to the base, but we'll have to move quickly.<eos> Because of the solar flares, it's only open for another varga.<eos> Then, it will be closed for two quintants.<eos> -They're gonna close it for two years?<eos> So, any thoughts on who's gonna join you on this little mission?
Wait!<eos> Huh... [man] Keith... [gasps] Dad?<eos> You're home, son.<eos> -What's going on outside?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> We'll be fine as long as we stay in here.<eos> Don't you want to catch up?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> [sighs] Son, so many years have passed.<eos> - I have so much to tell you.
You're messing with his mind.<eos> You're going to kill him!<eos> Knowledge or death, Shiro.<eos> I'm calling this off.<eos> You gotta tell me, Dad.<eos> I have to know.<eos> Where did the knife come from?<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Your mother is almost here.<eos> She'll tell you everything.
You've awoken the blade!<eos> The only way this is possible is if Galra blood runs through your veins.<eos> [Coran] Five... four... three... two... one!<eos> [Shiro] Princess, we're coming back, and we're bringing someone you should meet.<eos> -They're all right!<eos> -Yes, they did it!<eos> Princess Allura, it's good to see that the rumors are true.<eos> You're still alive after all these years.<eos> So is Zarkon.<eos> Can we consider you our ally in the fight against him?
Really?<eos> I dozed for ten minutes, and you guys figured out how to defeat the forces of evil?<eos> You've been asleep for three hours.<eos> I think we've got something here.<eos> It's dangerous and there are a lot of moving parts, but if we can coordinate everything just right, then--<eos> Zarkon's reign will be at an end, and the savagery that's poisoned our universe can finally be cleansed.<eos> -You've done it, Shiro.<eos> -We did it together.<eos> As long as we all stick to the plan, it should work.<eos> It will work. Perhaps, then, you'll learn that not all Galra are as bad as Zarkon.
I don't know.<eos> Did the Blade of Marmora, like, teach you the secret handshake, or something?<eos> No.<eos> No one said anything.<eos> The Blade of Marmora...<eos> They're real tight-lipped, aren't they?<eos> I get that your society is secret, but is everything a secret?<eos> Okay, look, it's bad enough that Allura hates me now.<eos> Can you just lay off?<eos> Allura doesn't hate you. You just need to give her time to accept the fact that you're Galra, the race that destroyed her entire planet and all of her people.

That's your way inside!<eos> If I can't see ya, I can't kill ya!<eos> This isn't good.<eos> This isn't good!<eos> We're attached to its back, in its blind spot.<eos> Good.<eos> We're going in.<eos> Wait, what do we do when we're inside the beast?<eos> A quick recap of what to do when you're inside the beast.<eos> One, avoid things that want to kill you.
One, avoid things that want to kill you.<eos> Two, get to the third stomach and find the scaultrite gland.<eos> Three, activate the weblum's defense mechanisms and collect the excess material from the gland.<eos> That's the scaultrite!<eos> -Seems simple enough.<eos> -Seems under-explained.<eos> -Come on.<eos> [Hunk] Got it, got it.<eos> Why are you tampering with evidence?<eos> Commander Thace, I was ordered to assist you in your investigation into the possible traitors on board.
What?<eos> Should we go after him?<eos> No.<eos> Whatever the Galra are planning won't matter after we defeat Zarkon.<eos> Copy that.<eos> By the way, Hunk, you really came through in the clutch back there.<eos> Without you, the mission would have been a failure.<eos> Aw, thanks, Galra Keith.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I think turning Galra has made you a better human.
Shiro, hold tight.<eos> Lance, you're gonna need to get a scan of his face.<eos> -Copy that.<eos> [growling] I'll be back soon.<eos> [inhales deeply, sighs] Face on the way, Pidge.<eos> Creating 3D render.<eos> Sending to you.<eos> Are you Slav?<eos> Are you here to torture me?<eos> No, I'm here to save you.
Wait, what? I have no idea where I'm going.<eos> -Slav, do you know how to get back?<eos> -Yup. What am I talking about?<eos> Of course, you do. You're a genius.<eos> -Come on.<eos> We've got to hurry.<eos> -No, thanks.<eos> What? We're finally going to stop Zarkon.<eos> We have the Olkari and the Blade of Marmora on our side. But, without you, we can't do it.<eos> Mm. I can have you on the Blue Lion and gone in no time, but we must hurry!
It took forever to build this teludav.<eos> And let's not forget it's a pivotal piece that we need for our plan to defeat Zarkon.<eos> I've made some improvements to your design.<eos> This will increase our chances of survival in this reality 205 percent.<eos> - Is this guy a little--?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No doubt.<eos> - Not a fan.<eos> [Coran] Stop hitting the teludav!<eos> [Coran] Princess, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.
What?<eos> As it turns out, he has some sexual needs that are causing her to reevaluate some... long-held beliefs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Heard enough. Yeah.<eos> I suggested some breathing exercises that might relax her.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Oh, I also told her she needed a safe word.<eos> Good night, Mom.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Marjorie doesn't call you about sex.
Just so you know, I'm working Saturday night, so it would have to be Friday.<eos> And I love karaoke and taco bars.<eos> Oh, and don't let Marjorie make her German chocolate cake.<eos> The Berlin Wall went down easier.<eos> - Jill's pregnant.<eos> - What?<eos> Two months... that's what we've been whispering about.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Everyone knows except me?<eos> - She told us not to tell you.
Anyway, it's my birthday and if anybody's hungry, there's 25 pounds of German chocolate brick on the table.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't clap, I don't want to wake him.<eos> Hey. Should you be out of bed?<eos> No, but...<eos> I wanted to try being sad in another room.<eos> What you doing? Just having a late night snack.<eos> I wasn't even hungry, but I saw you had the rib eye and the indoor grill.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Some folks from the meeting sent it to congratulate you.
That's bad?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Maybe the reason that I was so upset is... there's a little part of me that's afraid she was right.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I grew up bouncing from one foster home to another.<eos> I thought anyone who didn't smack me around was mother of the year.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The only thing I know for sure is that if you had a baby, you would love it like crazy.<eos> And that's all that matters.<eos> When did you become the strong, supportive one?
Hi.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll go see if Bonnie's out of the pool.<eos> She's not.<eos> You might want to bring her a robe.<eos> I hope you understand when I said the things I said, it was because you were in a dark place, and I was worried you were trying to get pregnant for the wrong reasons.<eos> But I never should've said you weren't cut out to be a mother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had no right to tell you how to live your life.
I feel like I'm being underutilized in the back.<eos> I should be out here on the sales floor.<eos> I don't tell a lot of people this, but my passion, from when I was born, has always been electronics.<eos> - Yes, you know... your TVs... computers, and... vacuum things and... and, uh...<eos> those strips, you know, with, like, a lot of plugs you can do... like a... Lot of options on those things.<eos> Those things are sick.<eos> Please don't make me go back there.<eos> It's very hot.<eos> Should've never gone out there.<eos> Told you.
Yeah, you know what this is?<eos> I'll tell you. Ageism.<eos> - Ageism? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Jerry is our top salesman, and he's 74.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> He's the token gray.<eos> People are only buying things from him 'cause they think he's gonna die.<eos> If you could just send this back on the belt, I need to get back out front.<eos> It's boiling in here, and I am beginning to shvitz.<eos> So I said, "Hey, "I'm not gonna bill you for getting the kitty out of the tree, but someone's gonna pay for these pants. " Wow.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> Nice gal, but, uh, you know, the smile was a deal-breaker.<eos> Didn't love the shade of her choppers.<eos> What?<eos> Her teeth are white.<eos> Mm. More of an eggshell.<eos> I need like a new golf ball white.<eos> Okay, so, let me get this straight.<eos> We set you up with this incredible girl who's into you, and you don't like her because her teeth are not golf ball white?
Just give me the box.<eos> Throw it!<eos> Ah, sir, I got your AX 200 right here.<eos> Just take it!<eos> You gotta take it.<eos> Oh, that's a belly burner!<eos> Take it, sir! Sir, take it!<eos> Sir, no!<eos> No!<eos> Can I interest you in our extended warranty?
Over 68 million Americans leave the safety of our borders every year.<eos> If danger strikes, the FBI's International Response Team is called into action.<eos> Come on. Let's get out of here.<eos> What makes you think I'm that kind of girl?
No, no, no.<eos> Know what?<eos> I wanna go to this party for five minutes and I don't wanna look at you.<eos> They're my friends, not yours."<eos> Then you walk in, "Hey, I brought muffins," and you're like...<eos> You wanna stay all night.<eos> "Aren't we having fun?"<eos> He's in the corner and your friends are like:<eos> "Isn't she great?" And he's like, "She's fucking great."<eos> And you get back in the car and you forget about the fight from before and you're like, "Weren't those muffins great?
Doesn't it come on the same day every month? "" No, it's a hormonal thing, it's irregular.<eos> I can't control it." "Oh, I can't control my body.<eos> Oh, it's hormones made me do it.<eos> Come on, you can control it."<eos> "Jen, I can't." "They have tampons in the bathroom?"<eos> "No, they're out and I...<eos> So, we gotta go."<eos> "You have a tampon in your purse, Jonathan?"<eos> "No, I forgot."<eos> "Jonathan, how many times have I told you be a fucking man and keep a tampon in your purse in case... you get your period early.
Peace be upon him.<eos> That's what you say when the prophet's name is mentioned.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Mayfield.<eos> You are officially not a Muslim.<eos> That didn't take long.<eos> Much shorter than it took to prove that Reverend Finch didn't understand the first thing about the Book of Revelation.<eos> You watch what you say now.<eos> The reverend was a brilliant man.<eos> He really wasn't.<eos> In just two hours, he was questioning everything he'd told you.
- The end's the best part.<eos> Do you have any idea what they're talking about?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> - My God, you're so annoying. - No!<eos> Mom, is it Caribbean Day at work?<eos> It's 38 degrees outside.<eos> Yes, well, it's 84 degrees in Singapore, so... Right.<eos> The Singapore Interchange.<eos> What, you're leaving today?<eos> Yeah, I told you that. No.
If they know they're not alone, they may feel freer to speak.<eos> Plenty of religious, socially conservative countries still manage to turn a blind eye towards the sexual indiscretions of powerful men.<eos> Sexual assault isn't an indiscretion, Russell.<eos> It's a crime.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Of course.<eos> I think it's worth a try.<eos> You don't know how glad I am to see you.<eos> Well, it's nice to see you, too.<eos> Wiseass, the camera stopped working when they dunked you.
Most cars made after 2009, regardless of make or model, are vulnerable to hacking.<eos> Is there any footage of the crashes?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Middle school security camera caught the moments of impact.<eos> Brace yourselves.<eos> It ain't pretty.<eos> No swerving, no braking, and an unsub turning cars into murder weapons.<eos> That's terrifying.<eos> It could be a whole new frontier for serial killers.<eos> Well, Garcia, since your area of expertise is relevant on this one, I want you to join us in the field.
But we'll keep fighting.<eos> I don't even have a lawyer.<eos> About that...<eos> I have a friend, Fiona Duncan.<eos> I've known her forever.<eos> Her father was in the foreign service, and we met in Italy when my mother was chargé d'affaires at the embassy there.<eos> After college she was a Rhodes scholar.<eos> You'd like her.<eos> Anyway, now she's one of the best defense attorneys in D.C.<eos> I would like it if you would let me reach out to her about representing you.
2 to 5 years.<eos> That's a lot of time.<eos> I understand. But it's all about perspective.<eos> It's a lot more than nothing, but a lot less than 25 to life, which is what you'd be facing if convicted.<eos> You think I should take it?<eos> I think, given what's at stake, you owe it to yourself to carefully consider it.<eos> I don't think I can lie and say that I did this.<eos> Is that foolish? No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I don't want to see you plead guilty to a crime you didn't commit.
You have to do the research, find the pressure points, get your leverage... which is what you'll be doing for the next few hours.<eos> But doubt not, your patience will be rewarded.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Ooh, hot.<eos> I didn't know you were into this sort of thing.<eos> Let's be honest, I'm not surprised.<eos> I want my phone back, Harry.<eos> But you've already got one.<eos> I've seen you 'gram all those inspirational quotes with it.<eos> You're not leaving.
Speak to them quickly.<eos> Things are moving fast.<eos> What are you doing in my room?<eos> I'm here to talk.<eos> About?<eos> A group at The Farm secretly selecting recruits for covert training.<eos> I didn't think you'd drop the mask that easy.<eos> You have the phone.<eos> Come on.<eos> This is how they contact you?
You really think I'd be part of a secret organization to train recruits at The Farm?<eos> After all this time, that's who I am?<eos> That's how I operate?<eos> I have dedicated my life to this agency.<eos> I've dedicated my life to this country.<eos> And I'm supposed to believe that?<eos> I don't play games, Alex.<eos> I train spies.<eos> I train patriots to serve their country.<eos> And I don't what you've gotten yourself into, but if you don't start telling me everything right now, I swear to God I will have you arrested for espionage and make sure you don't see the light of day for a decade.
I haven't been back to Krownest since before my time at the Imperial Academy, Ezra.<eos> And I didn't exactly leave on good terms.<eos> Well, maybe things have changed.<eos> They might be happy to see you.<eos> (CHUCKLES) You don't know my family.<eos> FENN: I do.<eos> Your mother is the leader of Clan Wren, Sabine.<eos> She may be with the Empire now, but I believe her true loyalty lies with Mandalore.<eos> Even if that were true, she thinks I'm a traitor.<eos> If you can convince your mother to help the rebels, all of Mandalore might follow you and the Darksaber.
You believe the Darksaber will protect you?<eos> It won't.<eos> It's only a symbol.<eos> Yeah, a symbol that's united all Mandalorians in the past.<eos> Look, if we stand together now...<eos> Stand together?<eos> Sabine, it's everything I can do to keep the other Clans from destroying us because of what you did.<eos> I didn't know the Empire would use the weapon I designed against our people.<eos> But you don't believe me, do you?<eos> Even if I did, it wouldn't change all the other ruling houses from seeing you as a traitor.
I am not a traitor.<eos> I want to save Mandalore too, but it needs a strong leader.<eos> You have to trust me, just like I'm trusting you.<eos> Mother, you're being summoned by Sundari.<eos> How's it going?<eos> You know Mom. She hasn't changed.<eos> No, but it's nothing a little sparring practice won't work out.<eos> You game?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's been a long time since I put you in your place.
Remember, only blast the guys...<eos> In white, I got it.<eos> Sabine!<eos> You will be taken back to Mandalore to finish what you started, the last living member of the Wren Clan.<eos> Sabine!<eos> By Mandalorian custom and law, no one can interfere.<eos> Are your customs more important than the life of your daughter?<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> You have some skill.<eos> But not enough to save you.
Not anymore.<eos> Mother.<eos> No one threatens our family.<eos> Gar Saxon was guilty of treason against the throne, collaboration with our enemy, and the execution of my fellow Protectors.<eos> But when the rest of Mandalore finds out about his death, there will be chaos.<eos> Perhaps Mandalore needs chaos if it's to become strong once again, and so that we may find a leader worthy of our people.<eos> (GRUNTING) Sure, now you show up when all the fighting is over.<eos> (GRUNTING) The Empire will come for you once they find out what's happened here.<eos> The Rebellion can help.<eos> The same Rebellion that sent you for my help?
I am so...<eos> Do not say you're proud of me.<eos> Me?<eos> Never.<eos> But I am going to miss you.<eos> We all will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> You did well today.<eos> All of Clan Wren saw who you've become.
- Commander, I found two more.<eos> - Droids?<eos> We were aboard the shuttle when it was stolen.<eos> Well, stay here and wait for processing.<eos> Oh, we can do that.<eos> We can do that just fine.<eos> Leave us.<eos> I'll interrogate him myself.<eos> Don't you realize how dangerous it is for you to be here?<eos> - If anyone recognizes you...
We became world-famous compared to how small we are, actually.<eos> At the time Bjarke came around, people didn't expect anything really to happen.<eos> And I think you could argue that he really made everybody wake up.<eos> What he was proposing had such a scale and such revolutionary qualities that the Danes got scared.<eos> Bjarke Ingels is having his moment.<eos> At just 40 years old, he has established himself as one of the world's most inventive and sought-after architects.<eos> His designs can be provocative.<eos> He's transforming the shape of New York as we know it.<eos> There's no doubt that in architecture there's this catch-22.<eos> Nobody will entrust you to build a building until you've already built a building.
And so I clicked it and... There was the pictures of my daughter.<eos> I called and asked to purchase the services myself.<eos> We got her back, but she was addicted to drugs.<eos> She had been very abused.<eos> She ran away two more times.<eos> I said, "Why are you running away?"<eos> And she said, "Well, mom, I have to go and get these pills."<eos> And I'm like, "What pills?"<eos> And that's when I learned about the other things that, you know, that she had shot her...<eos> Next thing you know, boom.

Ms. Schmidt-<eos> - FBI. We need your help.<eos> Oh, Christmas. I am so sorry.<eos> Are you okay, Agent Yermuther?<eos> I think she broke my back.<eos> [whispering] I broke Yermuther's back.<eos> -[Yermuther groans] -[Dunleavy] Easy. -[Dunleavy] Easy, easy.<eos> -[Yermuther] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. [upbeat music]<eos> I need you, Lillian.<eos> Lillian! Oh, well, I see you finally found the trash-picked baby monitor I hid in here to listen to you and Kimmy.
[Kimmy] Gretchen?<eos> [Yermuther] Yesterday we received some intelligence about the church Ms. Chalker is running out of a compound in rural Pennsylvania.<eos> Rural Pennsylvania?<eos> Can we stop by whatever a Century 21 is in Pennsylvania?<eos> That would be a Boscov's, ma'am.<eos> [Yermuther] I can't get into specifics, but we have reason to believe that Chalker is dangerous.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Maybe someone she knows can help talk her out.<eos> Cyndee Pokorny and Donna Maria Nuñez already tried, but they were just terrible.<eos> Gretchen, don't do anything you're gonna regret!
I'll do what I can.<eos> To be honest, this may be a little bit my fault.<eos> [Dunleavy] Ms. Chalker mentioned that.<eos> She also mentioned that you stole her boyfriend.<eos> I didn't steal him.<eos> He was made of cans, and I had the magnet.<eos> [Jacqueline laughs] Oh, you caught me mid-laugh.<eos> Jacqueline. I want to steal your youth.<eos> Oh... Breathe into my mouth.<eos> -Ohh! [Duke] I can see Russ finally got around to buying you a wedding band.
I mean, even our wives are in it for the money, and we're handsome.<eos> [chuckles] If he wasn't my son, perhaps I'd be dating him.<eos> [chuckles] The other day my wife spent a million dollars on a painting.<eos> Why? We have photography now.<eos> [Orson] Well, at least your wife is still hot.<eos> I know. Mom's a dog now.<eos> [Orson sighs] I'm so sorry, Dad.<eos> -[Orson] Yeah, well...<eos> -[exhales deeply] We'll see you later at the Maras'.<eos> Oh, oh, as you approach the house, rattle a can of change or something just in case Mara Mara's in the bushes.
I just want the recipe.<eos> Why?<eos> Because... tradition.<eos> And proper penmanship is a lost art, like drunk driving.<eos> I just want it, okay?<eos> I want it because Russ has it.<eos> How could Meemaw give it to him instead of me?<eos> How could anyone give anything to him instead of me?<eos> He's a loser, Jacqueline.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry, but has he ever beaten you at sex?
I don't even know what that's like.<eos> I'm sure your wife is with you for more than just your money.<eos> I mean, you've got... boats.<eos> And you know a lot about watches.<eos> [Gretchen] It's like I'm talking, but she's not listening.<eos> Gretchen, we have to talk.<eos> This must be Kimmy.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> That cats are just baby dogs?<eos> That this didn't work out because you're a woman, because the world won't let you do it like a man.
[Gretchen] It's like I'm talking, but she's not listening.<eos> Gretchen, we have to talk.<eos> This must be Kimmy.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> That cats are just baby dogs?<eos> That this didn't work out because you're a woman, because the world won't let you do it like a man.<eos> See, it's not your fault that boys don't learn how to cook or that people are obsessed with how women look.<eos> I mean, have you seen what they did to Strawberry Shortcake?<eos> More like Slutberry Slutskank.<eos> And it's not your fault the FBI won't come in here because they saw you crying.
Well, Ryan and Boyd are off to Canada to see the Hockey Hall of Fame.<eos> Wow.<eos> Pfft.<eos> In France, they think the Louvre is a museum.<eos> The vegan's gone, and I want some meat.<eos> Why isn't there any bacon?<eos> Dad's not eating.<eos> He's draining his swamp.<eos> Colonoscopy tomorrow.<eos> Oh, good thing you love having your picture taken. Yeah, you know what?
Wait a minute.<eos> There's Ed.<eos> I got to show him this.<eos> Oh, he's gonna be really happy for you.<eos> No, he's wanted this forever.<eos> It's gonna kill him.<eos> I love that you two like to make each other miserable.<eos> It's called friendship, Kyle.<eos> Hey, Ed, I got some big news.<eos> Want to read you something here.
- You got invited?<eos> - Yeah, that was the news.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But you know what's gonna happen?<eos> You're gonna get in because you're a great great man.<eos> Oh!<eos> Direct hit.<eos> I'm very happy for you Mike.<eos> Yes I am.<eos> There's nothing better than seeing a friend receive an honor that you voided your entire adult life.
Hey, is, uh, Mr. Alzate okay?<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> I felt really bad for him, so I called the museum, and they're gonna change the award to include all of Outdoor Man so he'll feel part of it.<eos> Does that mean I'm included, too?<eos> I'm a part of Outdoor Man.<eos> Oh, yeah, Kyle, and a very valuable part.<eos> Pick that up, will you?<eos> Hey, Mikey, I just got a call from the Explorers Museum.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Turns out you were wrong.
Yet I recall a different story...<eos> You giving me 10 bucks to stuff pillows in your bed so Mom thought you were home. Aah.<eos> Ahh, memories!<eos> Funny, fuzzy, conflicting memories.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I knew about that.<eos> I just... I trusted you to make good decisions.<eos> Why?<eos> I... You're only a teenager once.<eos> When did you get so cool?
Oh, yeah.<eos> It was so much fun.<eos> We'd prank-call the neighbors, watch R-rated movies.<eos> Remember sneaking out to 7-Eleven to buy junk food?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> But this is also fun.<eos> We could do that.<eos> Let's...<eos> Let's sneak out now and get our Cool Ranch Doritos on.<eos> Yeah, but, like, you're here and you're okay with it, so now it would just be an errand.
In fact, to this day, he only serves salad with two big spoons. Oh, boy.<eos> Here comes Santa Claus.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, w-who's been drinking my prep?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.<eos> Great.<eos> Now I won't have enough of this stuff to get the job...<eos> Excuse me. These guys are gonna be so mad. I locked the door.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to sit in silence until they return.
Nobody's too old for a colonoscopy.<eos> I'm forgetting things, Mike, and it scares me.<eos> Everybody forgets things!<eos> It's very important that I pick up something on the way home from work... haven't a clue.<eos> No.<eos> Those are little things.<eos> I'm in the rainforest, where my best friend finds an ancient artifact.<eos> I mean, that's the kind of thing a man should remember.<eos> You should've remembered Maria in the cantina.<eos> That's what you should've remembered.
That's what you should've remembered.<eos> I have a favor to ask, Michael.<eos> Going with "Michael" again.<eos> This is gonna be a big one.<eos> I'd still like to submit that spearhead under my name.<eos> Ed, Ed.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's too late in the game for me to go out and find something on my own.<eos> This is my last shot at the Explorers Museum.<eos> I think you're forgetting you're already in the Explorers Museum.
I never said I was feeble.<eos> Well, taking credit for somebody else's accomplishments... pretty feeble.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Having your name on that spearhead...<eos> No.<eos> ...is really that important to you?<eos> Come on.<eos> This is about you.<eos> You're forgetting things.<eos> That doesn't make you senile.
So it looks like all this took place inside of Qalea's Steel Ring.<eos> Steel Ring?<eos> It's a heavily fortified 4-square-mile area much like Baghdad's Green Zone.<eos> Jack, uh, I know Delgado.<eos> You know him?<eos> I-I mean, knew him.<eos> We used to work together for an NGO in Myanmar.<eos> When was this?<eos> Three years ago when I took my leave of absence.<eos> What do you remember about him?
This is insane.<eos> You being here, dropping into my life, just like you did before.<eos> To "save" me.<eos> No, I think we saved each other.<eos> Did we?<eos> You know, I still remember exactly where we were when you told me we were together for all the wrong reasons.<eos> But the crazy thing is, if you don't leave me, then I don't go home.<eos> I don't get married, and...<eos> I don't get my baby girl, Julia, in my life.<eos> Yeah, and I don't get to be here with you right now to help you.
You are expendable!<eos> Because you're soldiers, Jack, just like I am.<eos> And soldiers sacrifice themselves so others won't have to.<eos> You think I like lying down with dogs like Noori?<eos> You're damn right it's a necessary evil.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because we're at war, my friends.<eos> Make no mistake, just because we're telling people to keep streaming and shopping, we're in a dog fight for everything we hold to be true.<eos> And without men like me, without men willing to do what is necessary, we will lose!<eos> Spare me the self-righteousness, and don't you dare compare yourself to the men and women in uniform.
You want something?<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, I get it. This is supposed to be one of your Yoda tricks.<eos> Wait, so what? You'll just sit there staring at me like a gargoyle, hoping I'll get so freaked out that I'll say something useful?<eos> Or suddenly I'll have the urge to, to spill my guts and reveal the most important...<eos> Oh, for God's sake, shut up, Carl.<eos> God.<eos> You know, I don't need you to talk.<eos> I don't want you to talk.<eos> I just want you to sit back there.
Talk to me. Talk to me.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> I'm just a girl from Seattle, okay?<eos> Nobody cares about me.<eos> Then I came here and saw wondrous things.<eos> It's not wondrous, Mud.<eos> It's all a lie.<eos> He's not who he says he is.<eos> I'm not letting you out.
But now he's gone.<eos> We believe in the founder's promises.<eos> A longer life.<eos> We came for the fountain. And only found death.<eos> What happened... Baby has no father.<eos> Where do I go from here?<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Vaguely.<eos> Well, you were only four when Susan separated you.
True or false?<eos> Have you shown any symptoms? No.<eos> Did Susan tell you?<eos> I'm close to a cure.<eos> She never even tried to fix you, did she?<eos> Krystal, you took off.<eos> I told you to leave this to us.<eos> This is my operation now.<eos> Listen, hold on a second.<eos> You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
I need five minutes with this.<eos> - Open or closed?<eos> - Closed.<eos> Am I good with that statement?<eos> I marked it up.<eos> It's on my desk.<eos> Throwing the election back to the states, it gives us less certainty.<eos> I don't think we can get it done by Monday.<eos> We've been working at it for weeks, Francis.<eos> Claire, don't let the office make you careful.
I suggest you release whatever you have slowly.<eos> One at a time.<eos> Let's make this build.<eos> Once it gets out, I'll make sure the Republicans don't come to my candidate's defense.<eos> I was in a really bad place.<eos> I couldn't do anything.<eos> I couldn't leave my apartment.<eos> Why?<eos> It's mysterious, isn't it, when these things happen?<eos> Or maybe it never happened to you.
I should.<eos> Aidan. Shh!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> A door opened, I walked out.<eos> That doesn't sound right.<eos> I got a visa and a flight tonight.<eos> I just...<eos> I just wanted to see you one last time.<eos> Wait. Who's getting you out?
- Nah, I don't think so.<eos> - This does not make sense.<eos> Well, you always liked to drive a nice car.<eos> Aidan, come with me.<eos> I'll fix this.<eos> You come with me.<eos> I've a way for you to get out.<eos> Well, all right, then.<eos> Now, don't you tell anybody you saw me until the morning.<eos> Why would I tell anyone I saw you at all?
Thank you.<eos> The FBI confirms that they arrested Kalabi and that he's awaiting trial, but that's all.<eos> That's right, that's all.<eos> But there are agents in the FBI who were not happy with the way this went down.<eos> And not one of them will let us use their name on the record.<eos> We can't confirm the story.<eos> Tom, we can't run a story this big without a source.<eos> I know. I know. - This paper has never done that.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Who knows who sent you this?
- what I'm telling you? - There is nothing wrong with me. But you need to go home.<eos> You reached out to me.<eos> You brought me in.<eos> I... Enough.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - He's out.<eos> I'll come back later.<eos> Whatever it is, I can give it to him.<eos> You can trust me to hand it over, Doug.<eos> - You weren't directed to follow Tom Yates.
The timing gave it away.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What did you think was going on here?<eos> I'm not fucking you because I like you. I'm fucking you because I hate you.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out of my car.<eos> Get the fuck out of my car.<eos> Get out!<eos> What did Macallan give you?
Were you watching me, too?<eos> Who was he to you?<eos> Want a drink?<eos> I don't drink.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I was with him.<eos> When I was young and shouldn't have been with him.<eos> What gets you off, Doug?<eos> Anything?<eos> If Macallan gave you something, we should hand it over.
Danny...<eos> I'm counting on his vote.<eos> - Well, you can count it out.<eos> No... And half of the Democrats as well.<eos> Forget about censure, the House hasn't even voted yet on articles of impeachment.<eos> You're not the only one working the Senate.<eos> - Someone wants Francis out.<eos> - And I'm asking you who.<eos> You've been around a long time.<eos> Nobody tells you how to vote.

But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?<eos> I was the last person to see Aidan.<eos> He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.<eos> - Does it feel good to be back, LeAnn?<eos> - It does. Thank you.<eos> Well, I know Claire is delighted to have you back in her office.
- Publishers, the press?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> I will handle him.<eos> I just wanted you to be aware.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - I said I'll take care of it.<eos> No, I'll take care of it.<eos> You stay a million miles away from this.<eos> How could you be so stupid... to fall in love?
It's contagious.<eos> One of 'em gets an idea, and it spreads through the body like a flu.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> There's 100 of 'em. All we need is half.<eos> Can I just lay down?<eos> - I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> - Just for a few minutes.<eos> I'm just so fucking tired, and I need to think.<eos> Why do you need to think?<eos> The longer you hang on to whatever he gave you, the more danger you're in.
Enough so I can really get lost for a while.<eos> Buy some time till I figure out what I'm gonna do next.<eos> We can figure something out.<eos> I bet.<eos> You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...<eos> - I've never told anyone but you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know everything.<eos> But isn't that what you wanted?<eos> I miss touching you.
I believe Doug Stamper killed Zoe Barnes.<eos> I believe he was unstable and killed her to benefit Francis Underwood.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop it, please? Uh, off the record.<eos> Can you give us a second?<eos> I'll call you back in.<eos> Seth, this has nothing to do with pay for play, or Kalabi, or anything else the president is accused of.<eos> - Where are you getting this?<eos> - This is what I know about Doug.<eos> The chair will not let you testify in front of the committee with this.
Rochelle.<eos> Such a lovely name.<eos> Tell me how much you don't want that to end up in the press.<eos> And then shut this committee down.<eos> No deals.<eos> Mr. President!<eos> Mr. President!<eos> How could you?<eos> - How could you not warn me?<eos> - To protect you.
Claire, if you don't do it, you're gonna risk being married to a felon.<eos> And if I do, where does that leave me?<eos> Look, is this really the conversation you want to be having?<eos> You've trapped me, Francis.<eos> No, I do not accept that I've done something to you.<eos> I have provided you with an opportunity.<eos> Now, you have said before, that this is your endgame.<eos> And now, your goal is within spitting distance and all you see is betrayal?<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> Stop talking about what I've done to you.
I never thought that Frank Underwood would not be president.<eos> Not really.<eos> You could just run away.<eos> What does that get me?<eos> You're good at taking care of yourself.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Look, I want you to know that I care for you, but I don't know how much I can be there.<eos> I think I'm gonna just sit here for a while.<eos> Yeah, you should.<eos> Uh, the vice president would like you to leave the White House before she's sworn in.
We can't have anyone think you're still involved in policy.<eos> Look, if you're having second thoughts, you should tell me now.<eos> - No. I'm in full agreement. - 'Cause this is no time to hesitate.<eos> I am not hesitating.<eos> I just believe if we don't play this correctly, as far as the public, my term will be nothing but survival for both of us.<eos> All right.<eos> I want you to know I'm here if you need... any advice on policy or... anything else you might need.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> No one will ever love you as much as I do.
I'll announce it during the speech, after the troops.<eos> A full and unconditional pardon... for Francis Underwood and any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> It was never in doubt. I just needed to think about how.<eos> So how long does this arrangement last?<eos> For the time being.<eos> How did we get here, Francis?<eos> Oh, let it go.<eos> It's done.<eos> Oh, and one word of advice. Whomever Usher offers up to you as vice president, that's the person that you're really gonna have to watch.
We're getting to the best part: shopping!<eos> [Jacqueline] ♪ You got the moves ♪<eos> ♪ You got the body ♪<eos> ♪ You got the goods ♪<eos> ♪ He's got the money ♪<eos> ♪ Nothing's gonna stop you-- ♪<eos> [Deirdre] Jacqueline?<eos> I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> -[Deirdre gasps] -Deirdre!<eos> I haven't seen you since since Reg was named Transportation Secretary.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go pick up my son's anti-spazz suppositories.<eos> Mom, why?<eos> Because we're above it all now.<eos> Listen to Mommy.<eos> [Clara] This morning's reading is from Saint James.<eos> "Humble yourself, and God will give you grace.<eos> Brothers and sisters, do not slander or judge one another, for who are you to judge your neighbor?"<eos> Whoomp, here this is!<eos> Testimony!<eos> That usually comes later, Sister Kimmy, but as the Spirit moves you.
And I never miss an opportunity to hang with Mr. B.<eos> Plus, he told me to get in the damn truck.<eos> Kyle wanted to learn something about plumbing, so I brought him along.<eos> You want to help us get set up here?<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> All right.<eos> Now that guy can carry a load, huh?<eos> It's quite the box.<eos> They should call you "Tool Man."<eos> Yeah, so, uh, hope you don't mind other guys coming to your house to fix stuff that you can't fix.
And they make me clean the castle while they go to the ball.<eos> Hey.<eos> I had a really great time tonight.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I love being with you, and, in fact...<eos> I love you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I really love you.
Come on.<eos> And, uh... I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> All right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> How many Americans does it take to screw in a light bulb?<eos> Just one, I think.<eos> Hey, what's Ryan doing here?<eos> Aw, doggone it.<eos> Did I forget to tell you that he wants to learn about plumbing, too?
Aw, doggone it.<eos> Did I forget to tell you that he wants to learn about plumbing, too?<eos> Listen, I hope you don't mind sharing all of this.<eos> Laying it on pretty thick, aren't you there, Mike?<eos> I kind of have to.<eos> We're dealing with Kyle.<eos> What's he laying on?<eos> Hmm?<eos> He's using us, Kyle.<eos> The other day, he was using you to make me jealous, and now, he's using me to make you jealous.
That's exactly what I'm doing, Kyle.<eos> You know what?<eos> He's not gonna go for it, Mike.<eos> Hey, if Mr. B. thinks I'm gonna fall for it, I am not gonna let him down.<eos> All right.<eos> Who wants to learn a little bit about tools?<eos> Oh, I do. A lot more than Ryan.<eos> If I know what he's doing, how come it's still working?<eos> Because America is 17th in education.<eos> Hey, here's the 20 bucks I owe you.

A lot more than Ryan.<eos> If I know what he's doing, how come it's still working?<eos> Because America is 17th in education.<eos> Hey, here's the 20 bucks I owe you.<eos> If Mom says she's missing 20 bucks, she's lying.<eos> Oh.<eos> Thanks, Eve.<eos> I love you.<eos> Uh, Evie, I think your sister just said "I love you."
Relax.<eos> You didn't blow it.<eos> You did walk right up to the edge, but it's...<eos> Can I take it back?<eos> Wait.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you mean it or didn't you?<eos> I have no idea how to answer that.<eos> Love is hard, right?<eos> I mean, I'm not saying I love you.
Hello, freckle.<eos> I love you!<eos> Ugh.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Now I guess you love that freckle more than me?<eos> Maybe.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> Mm, I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'll just kiss you.<eos> Oh, not if I kiss you first.

You didn't behave like this before.<eos> Yeah, 'cause we were dating, and we knew that you'd disapprove.<eos> But now we're married, so sorry my husband loves me.<eos> And I do love her.<eos> I-I just want to make her happy.<eos> Oh, you do make me happy, Turtle.<eos> So, so happy.<eos> Turtle kiss! Okay!<eos> Okay, guys, guys, guys, stop it!<eos> I'll flip you on your back! You'll never get up!
Oh, you do make me happy, Turtle.<eos> So, so happy.<eos> Turtle kiss! Okay!<eos> Okay, guys, guys, guys, stop it!<eos> I'll flip you on your back! You'll never get up!<eos> Look, I just want you to remember that there are other people...<eos> Right... in this house who don't want to watch all this.<eos> What?<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> You guys are both such... What's the word for someone who tells you to not do something even though they do it all the time?
Well, spring's just right around the corner, and hopefully, I'll be dead by then.<eos> Here's a funny coincidence.<eos> Uh, I've been looking for a musician to perform here at night.<eos> Huh.<eos> Where?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right over there.<eos> Uh, over there.<eos> Uh, anyway we've been talking about it at all the staff meetings.<eos> So if I were to ask the staff, they would back you up on that?
Any more questions?<eos> Yeah, when should I expect you home?<eos> Around 1:00, 2:00?<eos> I just wanted to say: yesterday, what happened, I've never done that before.<eos> Really?<eos> You were pretty good at it.<eos> I meant in the stable.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> It was my first time in a stable, too, unless you count a shopping mall nativity scene.<eos> I'm sorry... I've got to kiss you.
FALCON: How's it going, Inferno?<eos> I thought I was getting better at controlling it.<eos> Stop and think before you act.<eos> Instincts will catch up.<eos> It's good to see you guys.<eos> The royal family's been great and all, but they're so focused on the new Inhumans, they've left me to explore Attilan on my own.<eos> Did you know they have secret laboratories?<eos> Oh. And they have catacombs.<eos> You, new Inhuman with the power of fire.<eos> What do they call you back home?
We thought...<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> HULK: Job's not done yet.<eos> I got this.<eos> (GROANING) Look who I found trying to blend in with the civilians.<eos> (GRUNTS) The destruction of Attilan was a beautiful sight.<eos> You call yourself a king.<eos> But you have betrayed our legacy.<eos> (GRUNTS) The Inhuman race used to be proud.<eos> You will forever regret the day you allied with the humans.
The backup has arrived.<eos> Black Bolt and Medusa are helping us?<eos> You'll need to catch me up on who's on whose side.<eos> After we find and free the others.<eos> Already did.<eos> Natasha got us out before she got you.<eos> 'Cause she likes us better.<eos> Thought you might want this back.<eos> Hulk, I could hug you.<eos> Except I know how hugs make you angry.
(GROWLS) Seeing Cap hurt makes me mad, and being mad makes me smash!<eos> (BOTH GRUNT) Keep 'em away from Cap.<eos> (GRUNTS) I may not have Mjolnir, but I still have two hammers!<eos> The left and the right! (YELLS)<eos> Falcon!<eos> Steve!<eos> Use my shield and give Black Bolt some cover.<eos> You got it.<eos> Steve!<eos> We thought you were a goner.
Jury selection is the key to trial.<eos> - It's our forte.<eos> - Yes, it is, which is why I have a new strategy.<eos> If we only get one strike, we have to avoid the nuclear juror.<eos> - Nuclear.<eos> - He or she is the one with the quality our research reveals is the most toxic to our defense:<eos> A strict constructionist.<eos> No Thomas Jeffersons.<eos> No one who believes in the literal interpretation of rules.<eos> They'll never forgive you for leaking the memo.
I know.<eos> I told her to.<eos> You went behind my back?<eos> She had to tell the jury she didn't get those Rangers killed.<eos> They would have charged her, Bull, on another count of espionage.<eos> It was a tactical decision.<eos> Maybe she gets charged, maybe she beats all the charges.<eos> - She agreed.<eos> - Always going for the big win?<eos> I told you to trust me.

- Until what?<eos> - Until we're raided by the FBI.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> - The FBI's coming here?<eos> - As soon as they get a warrant.<eos> The Feds are not gonna get a peek at our clients' business.<eos> Be ready to hit the kill switch.<eos> Colonel Jackson.<eos> Hey. You seem like a good guy, is what I don't get, being all you can be.<eos> I bet your soldiers look up to you.
His heart, lungs, bones literally melted by some intense, concentrated heat.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Nielsen was stationed in the Philippines for six months, got back two days ago.<eos> This is a rough homecoming.<eos> Mm, very rough, and judging by the bruising on his face and defensive wounds on his hands, our lieutenant was in the fight of his life.<eos> Presumably with the person who burned in his chest?<eos> Hey, uh, Tammy and Lasalle got Nielsen's last-known whereabouts.<eos> Orleans Marina.<eos> They're headed there now.<eos> Have 'em pick you up on their way.
Oh, God.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait... Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Ring the bell!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I did it.<eos> I did it, now put the pad back, please.<eos> I did it.<eos> You would have broken your ankle if you hadn't.<eos> Fear only gets you so far, Lund.
Bodies are starting to stack up.<eos> Hey, we got into this to make some money, provide for our families.<eos> I'm not about to go to prison for it.<eos> Are you?<eos> Put a bullet in him, toss him over.<eos> The downwellings out here will take his body right to the ocean floor.<eos> Nobody will ever see it again.<eos> Just be another rig accident.<eos> Guy panicked during a safety drill, fell overboard.<eos> What makes you think they'll buy that?
When you shut down rig 5, your competitors benefited, but guess whose earnings went up the most?<eos> You paid your own men to put holes in your own pipeline, choke out the oil, raise the prices of gas.<eos> And got an innocent sailor killed in the process.<eos> I don't have to listen to a word of this.<eos> I'm calling my lawyers.<eos> Oh, no, you're not.<eos> Someone in your office is controlling the pressure systems of the rig.<eos> And we're finding out who.<eos> You don't have a shred of evidence.<eos> We got three roughnecks on that rig that are ready to bury you.
maybe I never will.<eos> Well, then fight for it, Palmer.<eos> That's what you do, you fight for your family.<eos> And sometimes you fight like hell just to have one.<eos> You want me to fight?<eos> I feel like I just went ten rounds with Joe Louis.<eos> Do you want to be a dad, Palmer? !<eos> Because, right now, this is being a dad.<eos> Maybe I'm not ready.<eos> You wouldn't feel the way you feel right now if you weren't ready.
Well, I was just about to tell Agent Gibbs about some nasty old chemical burns I found on Sergeant Hill, our most recent victim.<eos> I actually was able to work backward from the contracture of the scarring to establish a likely pH and molarity level of the chemicals involved.<eos> Clever.<eos> Sergeant Hill likely got these scars in a makeshift lab while trying to create this poison.<eos> Making him our prime suspect.<eos> That's very clever.<eos> Dr. Mallard's praise that day convinced me to finally finish med school, and take the M.E. test.<eos> Really?<eos> What happened?<eos> What do you care, Ryan?
That's my dad's wallet.<eos> There's something in there you're gonna want.<eos> My senior thesis project.<eos> Plenty of miles on that photo.<eos> He showed it off a lot.<eos> He was proud of you. Yeah.<eos> And what was it that Dr. Mallard said earlier today?<eos> He said...<eos> "When you're going through hell, you keep going."<eos> You know I never would have taken you with me, right?
Sorry, amigo, not interested.<eos> (SNEEZES) This is what happens when you lick your spilled latte off the steering wheel.<eos> She did that. She's gross.<eos> - Lois, are you okay?<eos> - Ugh. Yeah. It's just my allergies.<eos> (SNIFFS) I can't figure out what it is.<eos> Maybe it's Brian.<eos> He practically sleeps on top of you.<eos> You could be allergic to him.<eos> Hey, here's an idea, Chris... why don't you mind your own business?
The wheelchair doesn't define me!<eos> CLEVELAND: And I'm Grover Cleveland.<eos> It's funny, 'cause my name's Cleveland.<eos> PETER: Aw, damn it, Cleveland.<eos> Now we got to kill them all.<eos> (COCKS GUN) This guy gets it first.<eos> Didn't you hear the alarm?<eos> Peter, wake up. We're gonna be late for church.<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> You've got to stop coming home so late if you can't get up in the morning, and... (SPEAKING, NO SOUND)
I guess you are.<eos> (SIGHS) Look, Stewie, I-I... I probably got a little carried away.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't the best roommate.<eos> Hey, Brian.<eos> You know, maybe I wasn't such a great guy, either.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> You know, even if we were bad roommates, we'll always be good friends.<eos> I hope you and your ferret are happy in here together.<eos> Well, now that you're moving out, I'll probably just drown it in the tub.
You're confused. You've been in a coma.<eos> The Evil Queen's guards... They stabbed me. I-I passed out, and then...<eos> The curse must have brought us here, whatever this place is.<eos> I'm gonna go get a doctor.<eos> All right.<eos> Whatever she did to you,<eos> I know Snow White is in there somewhere. - Trust me.<eos> - You are delusional and speaking gibberish.<eos> Why would I trust you?<eos> Because you love me and I love you.
Those aren't just any petals, Regina.<eos> Pretty boy is right.<eos> Those are Pixie petals. Exactly.<eos> And Pixie Dust might just be strong enough to wake us up.<eos> Well, I know about magic, and Pixie flowers only grow for one reason... in reaction to the presence of great evil.<eos> So, if these flowers just started sprouting up all over Storybrooke...<eos> I think the Author had the right idea skipping town.<eos> Whoever you're meant to face in this Final Battle... They're already here.<eos> Hello, Rumple.<eos> I believe the greeting you're looking for is, "Hello, Mother."
But worry not.<eos> I won't force you to do anything.<eos> When you join me, it will be because you want to.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Because I will never join you.<eos> Oh, when the darkness comes, you'll change your mind.<eos> And then, Rumplestiltskin, we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.<eos> _<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without the scales.
Is that why you're here?<eos> Because I will never join you.<eos> Oh, when the darkness comes, you'll change your mind.<eos> And then, Rumplestiltskin, we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.<eos> _<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without the scales.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, cut the act.<eos> There is no way you would let yourself fall under the power of Regina's curse when she's still awake.
Emma?<eos> What a lovely name.<eos> Perhaps I can help you.<eos> You are awake.<eos> Just needed a proper wake-up call, one that I knew one day would come.<eos> Right. So where is she?<eos> Where's my daughter?<eos> I know that Emma is destined to break the curse, but I don't know where she is and how she's meant to get back to us.<eos> Think harder.<eos> Tell me, dearie... What was it that woke you from your miserable little life in the first place?
You and Mom have been separated by the curse for weeks, and you still found a way to work together.<eos> Well, even though I can't be with her, I know that she's fighting for me just as hard as I am for her.<eos> Emma, I know Hook is out there doing the same for you.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> Look, is this about what happened at Skull Rock?<eos> If this were about Skull Rock, I would have left you to be gutted by those Lost Boys.<eos> Look, untie me.<eos> There's someone out there whose life depends on it.<eos> Afraid I can't let you go, not until you agree to do something for me.
Where is she?<eos> Where's Snow White?<eos> The winds were blowing from the North.<eos> The petals had to have come from around here.<eos> Look... Down there.<eos> Zelena said these flowers only grow in the presence of evil.<eos> So if there's a whole field of them...<eos> And here I was hoping to make an entrance.<eos> Stay away from my daughter.<eos> Emma, I've been waiting a very long time to meet you.
I'm afraid this is the only way you'll get this to the Savior.<eos> What kind of weapon is this?<eos> A wand.<eos> Well, part of one.<eos> The most powerful ever made.<eos> It's what banished the Black Fairy to the realm she was trapped in.<eos> Well, how did you get your hands on it?<eos> You're not the only one with a past you'd rather forget.<eos> I used to be a Fairy.<eos> What made you give up your wings?
Emma will find us.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> You don't have a child who's out there by herself.<eos> You have no idea what's out there for me.<eos> You can't stop us.<eos> You don't have magic in this world.<eos> Here, you're just a man.<eos> I don't need magic to stop you.<eos> You see, this potion... is the only way forward.<eos> I swore I would never leave you alone again, and now the Final Battle is coming.
Where is he?<eos> No. No.<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> This magic can reunite anyone who shares true love.<eos> It can open a door to Hook.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because we once used Pixie Dust to find you when you were a little girl.
We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> This magic can reunite anyone who shares true love.<eos> It can open a door to Hook.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because we once used Pixie Dust to find you when you were a little girl.<eos> What?<eos> If we had gone through with it, Emma, you would have grown up with us.<eos> We would have been a family.<eos> You wouldn't have become the Savior.
We've got to go!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where's Tiger Lily?<eos> She got away!<eos> You all right?<eos> - How did you...<eos> - We got your message.<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I should have told you what I did to your grandfather all those years ago, and I should never, never have even considered running away.<eos> I didn't exactly make it easy for you to tell me the truth.
that you face an uncertain future, but there's one thing that I want you to be certain of... that I will always, always be by your side.<eos> So...<eos> Emma Swan... what do you say?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> I feel like it's time I finally faced your father.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> What happened?<eos> They went into a sleeping curse so I could save you.
Well, it wouldn't have worked if you hadn't inspired all these people.<eos> You gave up your family for them.<eos> And got a bigger one in return.<eos> That's how I know that we'll defeat the Black Fairy, Emma.<eos> No matter what she does, you will not face her alone.<eos> There's never enough time, is there?<eos> Whether it's fast or slow or even if it doesn't move at all, but especially when the end is near.<eos> You gave my dagger back... Why?<eos> As I told you, you're going to choose to be part of this family.<eos> Does it have to do with the fact that Gideon didn't choose you?
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know what you're really meant to be, Lucy.<eos> Just ask them why they really chose you for this mission.
And how do you handle a responsibility like that?<eos> Took me a long, long time to come to grips with it.<eos> My father... your grandfather... Ethan Cahill, he's still alive.<eos> You'll meet him soon.<eos> He ran away when he was told.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You'll come around like we all did, because it's who you are, Lucy.<eos> It's your legacy.<eos> You know, not a day goes by that I don't think of you.<eos> Would you please stop pretending that you actually care about me?
It's your legacy.<eos> You know, not a day goes by that I don't think of you.<eos> Would you please stop pretending that you actually care about me?<eos> My entire life, not one phone call, and all of a sudden you're Dad of the Year?<eos> I get it.<eos> Your life is... is crazy and getting crazier.<eos> You're engaged to some doctor you don't know.<eos> You don't even have your sister to talk to, and now I come along.<eos> I am so... so sorry about Amy.<eos> You do not get to say her name.

You stole a time machine, Wyatt.<eos> We can't exactly throw you in county jail.<eos> Hey.<eos> You think you could, uh, slip me a snorkel before the waterboarding starts?<eos> I am seriously pissed at you, but I put in a call to Sam Dwyer.<eos> He's a JAG defense lawyer, a good one.<eos> I don't want a defense.<eos> I deserve this.<eos> Good luck.<eos> He said something to upset you, didn't he?
Uh, that's my answer.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Were we not free to go before you said that?<eos> We'll call you when there are more developments.<eos> Did nothing change?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, I... just had to borrow a book or ten.<eos> I see.<eos> What's got you reading about Charles Lindbergh?
Got 'em.<eos> I'll start scanning for anything suspicious now.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'm gonna check out Louis' room.<eos> Watch my back. Will do.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> It is not mine.<eos> Great.<eos> Even better.<eos> Haven't seen you in a little while.
Looks like a picture of a coin.<eos> It's a 1933 double eagle gold coin.<eos> The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made it illegal for citizens to possess gold currency, but I think Louis Miller's hiding one.<eos> Wait, hold on. A decorated vet's been kidnapped, and you're talking to me about pocket change? I thought maybe the guy threatened the president.<eos> I don't work threat assessment or protection detail.<eos> I do financial crimes.<eos> This is hardly pocket change.<eos> In 2002, a double eagle was legally auctioned for seven and a half million dollars.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what makes you think Louis Miller has one of these seven and a half million dollar coins?
Thank you for your...<eos> Thank you for your service.<eos> We're gonna play bingo at 2:00.<eos> Ginger!<eos> Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.<eos> Pacey, nobody is gonna hurt you.<eos> Look, they don't know anything yet, okay?<eos> I swear, okay? You can destroy it.<eos> And they won't have anything, okay, and I'll stop, I promise.<eos> Listen, suka, I saw who you met with.
No, no.<eos> I will take care of it.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> While I'm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.<eos> All right, you know what you need?<eos> A night away from all of this.<eos> You know, where you can just kind of relax and...<eos> I'm just gonna... turn this off.<eos> Much better.<eos> Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break.
What feelings?<eos> Pressure!<eos> I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401.<eos> Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.<eos> You think that stuff is fun?<eos> Being a parent is terrifying.<eos> I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.<eos> I get that, okay?<eos> It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.<eos> Come on. You've got so much to feel good about.
Our bathroom is strictly for grooming, shame eating, and pep talks before trying to put on jeans.<eos> Unlike you, I have some self-respect, which means I need to get my own copy of that key. How?<eos> [gasps]<eos> A heist.<eos> Stealing, Titus? Really?<eos> No, gas station man is stealing from me.<eos> I have been pooping-- or whatever, maintain the mystery-- there for years.<eos> But to right this wrong, I'm gonna need your help. No way.<eos> In philosophy, we've been learning about good and evil, and I think stealing is evil.<eos> Need I remind you, you owe me one.
Okay, what's the--<eos> [Titus] ♪ Courageous and brave ♪<eos> ♪ Brave ♪<eos> [Jacqueline] Okay. What's the single most important thing to everyone in this room?<eos> Doing my best.<eos> No.<eos> Money.<eos> And I've got the keys to the treasure chest.<eos> [Titus] Go ahead, Kimmy, do it.<eos> Come any closer, you'll never poop again.
Enter "then bar," then an equal sign, then the words "binary arbitrary reason."<eos> Totally what I was gonna say.<eos> 1955 South Hartford, Havertown. What are we gonna do when we get there?<eos> It's all about pattern recognition.<eos> Just...<eos> Just keep your eyes open.<eos> Hey. Did you talk to Richard Game?<eos> No, but I think I was wrong.<eos> - About what?<eos> Game confessed to killing you. - He's dead.
Put this on.<eos> Now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We're right here with you. We're not going anywhere.<eos> There's a man I know who works as a docent in a small museum in the Northwest.<eos> He recently remarried.<eos> Rotary Tuesdays. Euchre Fridays.<eos> A modest but happy life.<eos> Gavin and I played Euchre. Before you killed him.<eos> Gavin was a brilliant accountant. And an even better man... who worshiped you.
Who hired you?<eos> I got an anonymous package... detailing... files a-about every aspect of your operations, and... And your payment?<eos> I received a credit stick.<eos> It's in my apartment.<eos> It's in the... the lining of a red silk dress.<eos> Now, my husband...<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's married.<eos> He remembers you as you were.<eos> To show him what you've become would be devastating.
You ever trip over one of those things in the dark?<eos> They're lethal.<eos> Reddington.<eos> Elizabeth, where are you?<eos> Asa hightower, the apothecary, we have him in custody, and we found his lab.<eos> Have you identified the toxin?<eos> The lab's working on it. Not yet, but they will.<eos> Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison.<eos> One of my men is bringing it to you now.<eos> If the apothecary doesn't tell you what you need to know, the bottle will.
Forty-seven interminable days of near-constant rain.<eos> I couldn't be sure any of my messages had been dispatched.<eos> And then, on the 48th day, they swung the cell door wide and handed me a package.<eos> Half a dozen tins of chilled beluga caviar and a note.<eos> "Love, Marvin."<eos> When I think of it, guards on two continents, the bribes alone, must have cost you a fortune.<eos> I still can't fathom how you managed to pull it off from inside a federal prison. But you had my undying gratitude.<eos> So when the opportunity arose, I facilitated your freedom.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Why would I betray you?
Like gin or...<eos> Scotch. Yes.<eos> Did you drink scotch?<eos> I did.<eos> But there were only two people who had access to the bottle, and I'm one of 'em.<eos> Who was the other?<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> Raymond, are you okay?<eos> Reddington, talk to me.<eos> Who poisoned you?
Cassie said she was having a really good day.<eos> Where did you, uh, tell her I was?<eos> Uh, the beach.<eos> Well, she asked if that's where you were.<eos> It seemed to make her happy, so...<eos> Good.<eos> Ok.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm ok.<eos> I, uh, I'm really happy to see you.
Ok.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm ok.<eos> I, uh, I'm really happy to see you.<eos> I just... I kind of wish you hadn't come. It's not a good idea.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're stuck with me.<eos> Garcia has us on shifts, and she of course took first dibs, but, uh, they needed her in the office for a case, So I was the lucky one. A case?<eos> JJ, you should not be here.<eos> The last time I saw you, I promised you would not be alone.
I can do other...<eos> Martin Luther.<eos> I'd love to get a piece of that, huh? It's ok.<eos> Hey, quiet in there!<eos> Hmm?<eos> It's not my first time in a prison.<eos> I can handle it. Sorry.<eos> I don't want them looking at you. I know.<eos> I don't either.<eos> But if that's the price I have to pay to see you, I'm ok with that.
Rumors have circulated that he assassinated my accountant to secure the deal.<eos> What do you need from us?<eos> Some help to determine who murdered my man, Zack Smoll.<eos> If I can't staunch the bleeding Smoll's death has precipitated, all of our work could come to a grinding and permanent halt.<eos> I'm under attack, Elizabeth, and I need to find out by whom.<eos> Roughly 14 hours ago, Zack Smoll was found dead in the Gentle Bliss Massage Parlor.<eos> M.E.'s preliminary report describes symptoms consistent with acute meningitis.<eos> How does Reddington know Smoll didn't contract meningitis naturally?<eos> He didn't say, but if he's coming to us with this, it means he's desperate.<eos> You may feel you're paid enough to serve the public's interests and Reddington's.
All right? I know of at least six jobs the guy's done.<eos> Or so you believe.<eos> Edgar Legate is nothing more than a name I employ to take credit for various killings for which I or my associates are responsible.<eos> One of my competitors, Baldur Magnusson, is actively seeking a reliable independent contractor to kill me, someone I won't see coming.<eos> I think Legate would fit the bill nicely.<eos> - And you want me to become Legate?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'm not gonna play dress-up assassin so you can kill someone I've never met.<eos> I don't need you to become Legate to kill Magnusson.<eos> I need you to become Legate so Magnusson will hire you to kill me.
Suspect's in custody.<eos> There's no sign of Malik.<eos> Aram, check that local PD has shut down the roads - 10 miles in every direction.<eos> - On it. And that Hazmat team we sent earlier,<eos> - they should be there any minute.<eos> - No, Hazmat's already transported her. - What are you talking about?<eos> - The Hazmat team.<eos> The Hazmat team is already en route.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We have gone through quite a lot of trouble to find you, young lady.
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Okay. Come on now.<eos> All right, uh, satellite's coming around now.<eos> Okay, they're heading southeast on Holly Knoll Drive.<eos> They're about 200 yards past mile marker 46.<eos> Okay, weird.<eos> There's another vehicle trying to push them off the road.<eos> Uh, okay, now both vehicles are off the roadway.<eos> They're about 1/4 mile before marker 45.<eos> I thought I lost you.
I feel your breath against my skin.<eos> And I kiss you.<eos> The two of us...<eos> Forever.<eos> Give her a minute.<eos> I can describe every tile in the room they kept me in.<eos> For 13 years, I was just a medical curiosity.<eos> But then, there was Malik.<eos> He was the only one who really saw me, not the subject, but... me, Natalie.<eos> What made you leave?
May I have a moment with Keith, please?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Have all the moments you like.<eos> Is there something I can help you with?<eos> I just wanted to say... the Galra, they've done terrible things.<eos> Destroyed entire civilizations.<eos> They took my family.<eos> But, in time, I've grown to consider you and the paladins my family.<eos> So, when I learned you were Galra, I... I didn't know what to think.<eos> I wanted to hate you.
If it goes down, we're just going to be uncloaked in open space.<eos> [Shiro] Do all you can.<eos> We just need to hold out a little longer.<eos> That solves one problem, but now we're trapped in here.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> There's an exit through the main power conduit.<eos> It leads to the second deck.<eos> Go, now.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm not gonna leave you.
It feels like a death in the family.<eos> Sugar or Splenda?<eos> I'll just bring both.<eos> Look, this sort of thing happens.<eos> I had 11 years, I was on a cruise to Mexico, I ordered a virgin piña colada, I took a big gulp and realized it was as much a virgin as I was.<eos> So what did you do?<eos> I called the waitress an unfortunate name...<eos> A series of names, really... but I didn't take another sip.<eos> And that was it?<eos> You didn't beat yourself up?
Marjorie has the most awesome hands.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Let me see!<eos> You all right?<eos> Been better.<eos> Sure different than it used to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did like you teaching me how to skip.<eos> I liked it, too.<eos> I'm sorry I blamed you for what happened.
Who the hell is June?<eos> So how are the girls?<eos> Good.<eos> We went to three meetings in the last 24 hours.<eos> We cried about it at the first meeting, laughed about it at the second, and by the third, we were back to bitching about men.<eos> That wasn't a joke.<eos> Again, I am so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
You're welcome.<eos> It's a great restaurant.<eos> Try not to burn it down.<eos> I will.<eos> I hope your daughter enjoys the short ribs.<eos> Oh, these are never gonna make it home.<eos> I'm gonna eat them at the first red light.<eos> Can we do this again? Sure.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Although, I gotta tell you, my friends are... giving me a hard time about us hanging out.
Oh, my God, how am I gonna tell Adam?<eos> - You're not.<eos> - What?<eos> Do you like Joe?<eos> Are you gonna go out with him again?<eos> No, I am in love with Adam.<eos> Then don't blow it up over one mistake that you're never gonna make again.<eos> - But I feel so guilty.<eos> - And you should.<eos> But you don't get to hurt Adam just to make yourself feel better.
Oh, that is so beautiful.<eos> I'll never own anything that nice.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> Here.<eos> What?<eos> You're giving it to her?<eos> It's just a glass knock-off.<eos> I keep the real one in a safe deposit box.<eos> Why didn't you tell me? !<eos> Well, if you knew it was fake, you wouldn't feel special.
That's a big word for a mouth-breather like you.<eos> 'Cause, let's face it, compared to Dr. Reid and the reputation of the rest of your team, you're slow, aren't you?<eos> I studied you.<eos> When I was with the fugitive taskforce, you were exhibit A in the class on indicators of guilt, something you examine after a suspect flees.<eos> I didn't flee.<eos> I turned myself in.<eos> Because your C.I. for the Russian mob was going to expose some other deep cover agents on the case.<eos> So you killed her, and then later you turned yourself in a whole year after you had killed her.<eos> I mean, it's... You had gotten away with it.<eos> What made you grow a heart?
You remember that case we worked together in Auvergne?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that was a tough case.<eos> Well, I thought when we took that one to trial, we were going to lose, but you told me to let the system work, and you were right.<eos> So that's what we have to do now...<eos> Let the system work.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That guy was guilty.<eos> Right now we don't want the system to work.<eos> I was hoping you wouldn't remember that.
! - Stop!<eos> What do you mean, "don't worry about it"?<eos> Look at this! Look!<eos> - What?<eos> - Rachel bloody vivisecting her!<eos> Look at that!<eos> - Oh, my God. - Ohhh...<eos> Kira.<eos> Look at me.<eos> What did she do to you?
OK, first of all, the bear is real.<eos> Liar.<eos> - And no, I am not!<eos> And second...<eos> You were out there this morning;<eos> you helped the girls.<eos> Charlotte told me.<eos> We're on the Island of Dr. Moreau here;<eos> whatever weird shit is happening, it's coming from the big house.<eos> I know that disturbs you, Mud, so talk to me, tell me the truth.
- 30 minutes til lights out, OK?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> When we get in here and you see Alex Ripley, I need you to dig deep and stay calm. OK?<eos> You know who he is?<eos> She, actually.<eos> And you know her too.<eos> Hello, Virginia.<eos> Coady.<eos> She's out of it.<eos> Can you tell us what they've got you on?
How things must have changed while she kept me in here drooling on myself.<eos> Who?<eos> Get me out. Then we'll talk.<eos> You don't get to decide.<eos> - Talk!<eos> You're gonna talk now! - Sarah, stay with me.<eos> - Everything alright?<eos> - Thank you. Just clumsy.<eos> You want to get out of here, you need to earn it.<eos> Now, who put you in here?
You're a survivor.<eos> We do this as a family.<eos> Well, Susan.<eos> Shall we share a glass of this excellent port?<eos> If we do, we can have the kind of conversation both you and I love:<eos> a conversation filled with deep and far reaching consequence.<eos> Now, if we don't...<eos> The conversation is very short. Yes.<eos> And it's a pity.<eos> Worse than death really, to be left out of the future after you've put so much into it.
Then we'll find a cure.<eos> Okay? There's nothing...<eos> Nothing that's mine.<eos> Hey, you have me.<eos> You.<eos> Yeah. You... You were paid to lie to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Come here.<eos> I can promise you one thing, here.<eos> I will always work to protect you.
Better leave while you can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry to cut your reunion short.<eos> See her out, if you wish.<eos> What in the actual hell?<eos> Why would you tell him that I was in his basement?<eos> He wanted information.<eos> I had to give him something so that he'd let me go to Geneva before it's too late.<eos> What's in Geneva?<eos> What's so important that you would throw me under the bus?
For the record, I was not the scientist conducting the trials.<eos> But I did synthesise the gene.<eos> You synthesised it?<eos> And put it in the LEDA genome.<eos> To see if accelerated healing would manifest in you.<eos> Which it didn't.<eos> It manifested in Kira, the unexpected second generation.<eos> - There's an emergency.<eos> - It's in the village now, Sir.<eos> God's sake, Percival, what did I tell you?
Susan has shown me she doesn't have the backbone, but you... You have proven yourself.<eos> Will you join me at my side to lead Neolution forward?<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> I consider you my daughter.<eos> Hello, Rachel.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> She never believed in me.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Well... Virginia has been waiting to meet you.
Silver spoon so far up his arse, he could afford the ego it took to do this shit.<eos> I never knew his real name.<eos> But you knew he was a fraud.<eos> Fraud?<eos> We're all frauds.<eos> Get on to the board.<eos> Rachel, you knew his secret.<eos> What about your board?<eos> How are they going to react to this?<eos> Do you think they would listen to you, a nuisance clone?
Helena!<eos> You devil!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> The mother who left you knew you had the devil inside. Well, now everyone will know.
They walk the Earth, while the original is at home with God.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> I protect her from science-devils.<eos> Well, welcome back.<eos> We're going to start a Pitocin drip, Helena.<eos> It'll induce labour.<eos> But the babies aren't ready yet.<eos> They'll be fine.<eos> Twins are usually premature.<eos> He makes you do this. Like he made you kill Gracie.
I'm with Kira and she said Helena is in trouble.<eos> I can feel her.<eos> Her babies are coming.<eos> Well, I see only two options for you.<eos> Either, we hand you over to John, or we hand you over to the authorities.<eos> Third option, I pull the trigger for the second time today.<eos> I don't know, please, all I know is the person with the biggest target on her back, is her.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Yes.<eos> If he wants you so bad, I say we give you up.
- Got it?<eos> - No, here we go.<eos> Hold it up.<eos> Got it, got it, got it, got it.<eos> God damn you!<eos> Secrets?<eos> I know yours, Rachel.<eos> I know how you cup your hands just so, so you can hide digging at your fingernails, the thing you can't stop.<eos> I know how you constantly write letters to your biological mother - who you've never met. - Stop it.<eos> I know how you touch yourself in the shower,
I need water.<eos> Here.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You are shit mother.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Beg.<eos> Here, hurry.<eos> The key's there, on the tray.<eos> They will come back.<eos> Come on, I'm gonna get you out of here.
We're gonna take the day off from crazy.<eos> Thank you for letting me stay.<eos> I don't have a family any more.<eos> I didn't know where else to go.<eos> What?<eos> When did Mark die?<eos> Two weeks ago.<eos> How did you find me again?<eos> Well, you told me about Sister Irina, how she...<eos> That you and the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the new world after they cut out her tongue.

Rachel.<eos> Rachel was rather impressed with our transgressive little alliance, weren't you?<eos> It made me sick to work with the man who killed MK.<eos> Sarah doesn't know you two are here, does she?<eos> No, it's just the four of us.<eos> Our interests are very firmly aligned as you now have a nice, big, fat target on your back, too.<eos> So... Neolution goes down for good, or we all do.<eos> This is a summary of the evidence we've amassed so far, but we need you to help us prove it.<eos> I'd like to talk to you. Alone.<eos> You'd be dead if I hadn't called him in to save you.
Your mom is at the florist, hon.<eos> She's thinking about your brother.<eos> Are you?<eos> S said last week that she's got some other source, so I'm trying to figure out...<eos> Do you have any idea how hard your brother's been working for tonight?<eos> Yeah, my brother's got a problem with me, he'll tell me.<eos> Well, why don't I tell you my problem?<eos> The entire time that we were gone, he was painting you, different versions of you.<eos> But you don't seem to care.<eos> And Delphine, I don't know if it helps chill you out, all she did was whatever Siobhan told her to, all right?
Hmm. I need my good luck charm.<eos> Please don't shoot.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm not gonna shoot you.<eos> The gun is just to make sure you stay quiet while Charlotte strangles you.<eos> We need the dress.<eos> Bypass surgery?<eos> Did you get a second opinion?<eos> Well, when is he scheduled to go under?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna try to get there as soon as I can.<eos> You too, mom.
But he was fearless.<eos> A lion.<eos> He demanded to commandeer our convoy in order to transport refugees to Ekata.<eos> He was unarmed.<eos> I had a security detail of a dozen international battle-hardened mercenaries.<eos> What did you do?<eos> In the face of that kind of... Will... I re-organized my cargo and complied with his demands.<eos> What progress have you made with Isabella Stone?<eos> None. She won't cooperate.<eos> If someone hired her to come after you, she won't say who.
Don't say it.<eos> Okay? That's number one.<eos> Number two, I am, supposed to be romantic this weekend with her.<eos> You're-you're aware of that, right? So what's the problem?<eos> The problem is that you are here, and I do not need you judging me.<eos> I don't need your judgy eyes, your judgy face, your judgy everything.<eos> I don't need that while I'm trying to be romantic, you understand?<eos> First of all, I'm very aware of your issues, of your intimacy issues, and-and the last thing I would want to do is make you feel uncomfortable.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> If at any stage my presence makes you feel uncomfortable, makes you feel like you can't quite get to the romantic, intimate place you need to get to, you say the word, I'm out.
Vanessa Lancey.<eos> She was caught in an HPD john sting a few months back.<eos> Well, looks like she wasn't out of action for too long.<eos> Yeah, HPD went by the, last known address, but she doesn't live there anymore.<eos> Fortunately, we had another lead.<eos> Cordelia Martin posted her bail.<eos> Cordelia owns a high-end escort service here on the island.<eos> You know this through personal experience? But of course.<eos> See, when I was with SWAT, we knocked down her door on more than one occasion.<eos> Well, then she'll be thrilled to see you again.
Yeah.<eos> All right, well, look, we'll settle this.<eos> My glasses... They got a little scratch on the inside right lens.<eos> Give me those, and, we'll see what's what?<eos> Help!<eos> Help! Somebody help me!<eos> This man is touching me inappropriately!<eos> Help!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> You nuts? I got to ask you a question.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, so I got a credit card charge on a vacation rental service.<eos> Make the call.<eos> We need an address, and we need it fast.<eos> You say that you love me, Neil.<eos> And if you do, you need to let me go.<eos> You don't really want that.<eos> You're just saying it because you're scared, but, hey, remember what it was like when we met?<eos> It can be like that again.<eos> I need to tell you something.
Sorry I got all goofy and blew off the rest of the afternoon.<eos> I know you put a lot into making this weekend nice.<eos> I'm sorry I got goofy over a pair of sunglasses.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know what I signed up for.<eos> Besides, we still have tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fourth and goal.<eos> Champagne? Yes. Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm impressed you were able to talk your way out of that. No.
I ate my own fingernails.<eos> I ate $10,000 worth of my paychecks.<eos> I ate Hot Beef... a magazine I brought for those lonely nights at sea.<eos> And Miss Dionne only grew more and more belligerent.<eos> "Hey, everybody! I'm Titus!"<eos> ♪ Nobody likes Titus ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause he is a daaamn nerd! ♪<eos> Go ahead, boy.<eos> Eat me.<eos> Start with my feet so my face can watch you choke.
I get why you didn't want to talk about that cruise stuff.<eos> 'Cause jeez, if you'd really eaten that old lady--<eos> We'd be on the lam together. Not to Canada.<eos> Mexico.<eos> I need siesta culture. No.<eos> I don't think I could be friends with you anymore.<eos> Like Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney after they fought over that girl.<eos> -You don't mean that.<eos> -I mean... I let you get away with a lot, mister.<eos> I don't say anything when you pretend to be pregnant to get a seat on the bus.

The musical was Mahogany.<eos> I was hired as a swing member of the cast.<eos> For those of you who don't know the lingo, that means I sang with the chorus, and it was my responsibility to move the scenery in the dark, which I did not do.<eos> Miss Dionne took me under her wing.<eos> Do you pray, Titus?<eos> At least once a day when I choke on something.<eos> You should praise Jesus, because you are blessed with a voice.<eos> Titus, you make Patti LaBelle sound like Barry White.<eos> -Oh. [mouths words] -And I should know. Because I've done EpiPens on both of them.<eos> I would sit at her feet, taking in her wisdom, like how when you forget the lyrics, you just say... ♪ Mm, a-well-a-well-a-well ♪
But you got to keep 'em wet.<eos> A wet baby corn is a singer's best friend.<eos> See?<eos> [Titus] I would run and get them for her from the ship's salad bar before every performance.<eos> But then one day, Miss Dionne took ill.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Not now.<eos> Miss Warwick made the mistake of going down the tube slide at the pool today.<eos> I love a slide.<eos> You never want to go near the water on these boats, Titus, especially the hot tubs and pools.
The Ocean Skank didn't sink.<eos> -We did stuff.<eos> So there was no fire, was there?<eos> Was everything you told us a lie?<eos> No!<eos> I was the lead in Mahogany.<eos> But then... Dionne Warwick got better.<eos> Oh, Miss Dionne. You're up.<eos> Yes, baby Ti-ti.<eos> Oh, and God bless you for understudying me.
You are the most selfish person I have ever met.<eos> And I was imprisoned for 15 years by a lunatic!<eos> -What?<eos> -Later.<eos> Fudge this. Fudge this whole thing raw!<eos> You know what, Titus?<eos> I meant it when I said I only wanted good people in my bunker.<eos> You mean "funker."<eos> I don't anymore.<eos> And even with all the extra chances I've given you, I'm not sure you're a good person.
-Finally getting my man cave back.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> You never used this room.<eos> Because it was haunted by the ghost of that water bug you killed.<eos> That was just a different water bug who got trapped in a Kleenex.<eos> Throw these away, though, right?<eos> -Those are prescription!<eos> -[Artie] Smart.<eos> Frames is where they get you.<eos> Don't you remember how things used to be before Kimmy?
♪ 'Cause we're stronger than this storm ♪<eos> You can totally stay here.<eos> We'll just tell them you're our Emotional Support Human.<eos> Does that mean I can go into restaurants with you?<eos> [Kimmy] What?<eos> Oh, great, it's you!<eos> I used too big a rock!<eos> And also, it took me a while to find the right window.<eos> But I need you, Kimmy.<eos> Yeah, to rub your feet and wash your cereal bowls and go refill your MetroCard when you "literally can't right now."
How was the gun range?<eos> Brutal.<eos> Isn't that what makes it fun?<eos> I was just a little off today.<eos> A little off?<eos> You'd have been better with a moving target.<eos> A target that moves in front of your bullets.<eos> Very funny, Dad.<eos> Mom, can I borrow a couple of bucks?<eos> I thought you were doing pretty well playing outside the mall.
Good.<eos> We'll talk, you listen.<eos> Sit.<eos> Okay.<eos> On average, college graduates earn 85% more than high-school graduates.<eos> Mm.<eos> Well, money isn't everything, Dad.<eos> Yeah, but money buys everything.<eos> Okay, I really don't have time for this right now.<eos> No, listen, listen... t-the deadlines are approaching on the acceptances you got last year.
Yeah, of course.<eos> She was just as happy to nominate me for the Air Force Academy.<eos> So, even a Democrat could see how good you are.<eos> You really got into the Air Force Academy?<eos> I really did.<eos> I am... I'm so proud of you.<eos> That is great news!<eos> There's that approval I crave.<eos> Well, your first mission will be to see if you can survive telling your mom.<eos> When you didn't get into West Point, your mom and I figured you were done with the military.
So, Ohio State?<eos> It just seems to me that a lot of the people who join the military and protect us are the ones that this country hasn't done all that much for.<eos> Well, this country has done a lot for me and for my family.<eos> I would consider it an honor to be able to give something back.<eos> There are other ways to give back, safer ones.<eos> You're worried if I do this, it's gonna hurt me.<eos> But it's really gonna hurt me if I don't.<eos> Come here.<eos> Ohh.<eos> Why did you have to turn out so great?
But it's really gonna hurt me if I don't.<eos> Come here.<eos> Ohh.<eos> Why did you have to turn out so great?<eos> I had two amazing role models.<eos> You have to call me every day.<eos> Aren't you gonna get sick of hearing from me?<eos> Well, that's why I have caller I.D.<eos> Hey, baby. Hey.<eos> Got some news that might make you feel better about Eve.
But an old friend of mine called me up and asked me for a favor.<eos> Said he was trying to get a refugee family onto the island.<eos> A mother and her two keikis.<eos> And being the, you know, humanitarian that I am, I agreed to help.<eos> Only, I was played.<eos> There was no family in that container.<eos> All right, so what next?<eos> What happened?<eos> We rubbed each other with Tiger Balm.<eos> What do you think? I got my skinny ass out of there.
What do you got?<eos> I got a lot of countermeasures here.<eos> I got a lot of fail-safes, I got a lot of decoy wires.<eos> I'm thinking Abati's the only person who could defuse this bomb, all right?<eos> Now, I could try to disarm it, but if I make a mistake, I'm not just gonna kill you and me, I'm gonna kill half the population on this island.<eos> - Okay, what's the good news?<eos> - Didn't say I had any good news.<eos> We got to contact the bomb squad.<eos> By carrier pigeon?<eos> I'm just curious, 'cause I just told you that my cell phone doesn't work and that thing clearly doesn't work...
It's gonna say, "Here lies Danny Williams.<eos> "We think.<eos> We're not really sure because we could not find all of him."<eos> Danny, I'm keeping it under eight miles an hour, here. All right?<eos> It's not a school zone.<eos> I'm not worried about getting a ticket.<eos> Dude, if I go any slower, inertia is not gonna be on our side, and these bumps are gonna get a whole lot worse, and you know what that means, okay?<eos> If I don't maintain this speed, we're not gonna make it to the clearing in time.<eos> How we doing on bars?<eos> Do you not think that if I had bars I would inform you of that, huh? No.

I-I couldn't imagine what you'd want to talk about.<eos> Oh, actually, you know what?<eos> Just explain something to me, all right?<eos> You've never mentioned retirement ever, ever, ever since I've known you.<eos> Now it's lists and it's plans and restaurants, you know.<eos> Where's it coming from?<eos> I told you.<eos> I'm coming up on 20 years. So what?<eos> So what?<eos> So what? - Doesn't mean you have to retire. - Okay, okay.
Hold, hold. How long do we have before we are microwaved while doing that? Not long.<eos> It's gonna be fast.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Grab the phone.<eos> Grab the phone.<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> Car batteries are made of lead, right?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Wh-What are you doing?<eos> Look, the lead in the car battery can protect me from the uranium, like the bib you get in the dentist's office before he does an X-ray, you understand?
It's implied.<eos> Why would you mess with greatness?<eos> No meatballs for you?<eos> No, I'm a vegan.<eos> Vegan?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> No, I'm not kidding. You know, I'm trying to lead a healthy lifestyle.<eos> 'Cause my, uh, body's a temple.<eos> Uh-huh. Charlie, what do I say that you're supposed to say when I give you something you don't like?

And she would die within minutes.<eos> You can't clear the debris with live power lines, but you can't cut the power because her HEPA filter, it'll stop working.<eos> And I'd have no oxygen.<eos> Going off what the chief said outside, the fire department's at a loss, and the NASA engineers who built the bubble, they're too far away to get here before the house burns down.<eos> Happy, is there anything you can do to help me?<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> You need to get the guys over here now.<eos> Walt, Paige, Toby, David Pearce.<eos> His daughter Ada's inside.<eos> I don't know if your colleague told you, but Ada has...
Walt, you're up.<eos> Insulation hunk with roofing tile on it.<eos> Careful.<eos> Careful!<eos> Please.<eos> Paige?<eos> David, can I talk to you outside for a second?<eos> I know you're terrified, but they know what they're doing.<eos> No, I'm sure they do.<eos> You just have no idea what it's like to have a child that you worry about every second of every day.
Okay, we're set.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Sly, we cured the hives with hives, now it's your turn-o to start an inferno.<eos> Affirmative!<eos> Nearly done in here.<eos> Final results are in.<eos> Want me to check 'em, kid?<eos> We both know the results.<eos> What we're doing now is much more important than some dumb election.<eos> West Altadenia doesn't deserve you, kid.

Let's test that hypothesis.<eos> What's that?<eos> I call it the Bicker Clicker.<eos> Patent pending.<eos> How does it work?<eos> Every time you say or do something that should cause you two to bicker, he hits the clicker.<eos> It keeps count.<eos> We get back together, review the numbers, see where we are.<eos> We're gonna be at zero, because everything she does delights me.<eos> Let me ask you something, how do you feel about Happy dragging you here to see me?
Share it.<eos> Thanks for nothing, quack!<eos> We're worse off than before we came here.<eos> Wow, 32 clicks!<eos> That's a new record!<eos> Not 32. It hit 99 and then turned over.<eos> It's 131 clicks.<eos> Really great work, Cecil.<eos> All you proven is that the woman I'm gonna marry drives me crazy.<eos> Tobias, you already knew she was driving you crazy.
Excellent choice.<eos> - No more using the blue bowl.<eos> - Good!<eos> 'Cause I destroyed it.<eos> Couldn't have it in the kitchen contaminating the other bowls.<eos> Plus, I got some of the blue liquid they put combs in.<eos> Its active ingredient is alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride.<eos> Thought we could do some experiments.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Paige, how's the new do affecting you?
I help the good guys every now and then.<eos> Now I'm in here, so is he.<eos> Small world.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Incoming.<eos> Frazier told me we were the guards for his private stash.<eos> I heard.<eos> He trust me 'cause he know I won't touch the stuff.<eos> Why'd he pick you?
You don't buy it.<eos> Let me try and find a way out of here, And if I can't...<eos> Then I'll believe in fate again.<eos> Run.<eos> A second discovered attack.<eos> You might be unpredictable, after all.<eos> How do you know malcolm?<eos> Who?<eos> Malcolm.<eos> He says he knows you.

Predator!<eos> Pedophile!<eos> What kind of operation are you running here, lady?<eos> You've just got Peeping Toms milling about, making smut films?<eos> - No. - I've got half a mind to report you.
We're siphoning gas out of the GT to put in the Lambo to move the Lambo, so we can take the Speedster into town.<eos> Why not just take the Lambo?<eos> Because... 'cause then we wouldn't be driving the Speedster.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He doesn't get it.<eos> What's with the hoses?<eos> I just got done explaining it to you.<eos> We're siphoning.<eos> Did your mom not teach you anything?
No. No.<eos> They don't now.<eos> But they might think that soon. You know?<eos> So maybe it's a good time to just start thinking about it.<eos> - Yeah. - For you, anything.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'll let you get back to it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> Oh, you got to lift it.
Well, wolves don't quit.<eos> - Well, I do.<eos> - Chip...<eos> Someone's here to see you.<eos> Hello, my Chip.<eos> It was the crazies.<eos> The immigration people held me for whole day.<eos> I tell them, "I has my visa, misters," but they don't do listening.<eos> Those scumbags.<eos> They didn't touch you, did they?

And why didn't you just call Chip?<eos> I didn't has American telephone.<eos> You know what?<eos> Tomorrow you get yourself a new phone.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> So you're telling me there was no phone for you to borrow?
What?<eos> Why? She totally emasculated me last night at dinner.<eos> I can't be with somebody who thinks I'm a sheep.<eos> That necklace has been in my family for generations.<eos> - Damn it, Chip,<eos> - My mother had...<eos> Everyone, calm down!<eos> Relax, okay?<eos> I'll explain what happened.<eos> What happened is that you got played just exactly like I told you you were going to.
Shut up, both of you!<eos> - Give me this!<eos> - Oh. You ruined my life!<eos> God, did you know she was such an ugly crier?<eos> I'm not crying!<eos> Okay.<eos> The fish look sick.<eos> Can you believe this crap?<eos> What's not to believe?<eos> All of it... propaganda being pushed by Big Tooth, trying to convince you you're less of a human if you don't "Smile Like a Star."
These so-called professionals use fear to convince us that we need them, when in reality you could probably do it yourself.<eos> Hell, a monkey could do it.<eos> People don't do their own dental work because it's a specialized skill.<eos> I mean, I could unclog my toilets, but I prefer to have a plumber do it.<eos> Do not get me started on plumbers.<eos> Good job, little man.<eos> See you in six months, all right?<eos> I only have one cavity!<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Who told you that, the tooth jockey?
Oh, bollocks. Right.<eos> Engage our cloak and plot a course.<eos> - Heading, Captain?<eos> - The nearest open window.<eos> Any luck?<eos> You asked me that five minutes ago.<eos> You know, it's not easy trying to get a 21st century radio to communicate with a 22nd century time ship.<eos> Thawne never told you what he did with Rip?<eos> No, we weren't close like that.<eos> How you holding up?
We didn't do anything yet.<eos> - Rip?<eos> - Yes, Dr. Palmer,<eos> I've honed in on your location.<eos> Well haul ass over here and come pick us up.<eos> There may be one small problem with that.<eos> Look, it's the teeny, weenie Englishman.<eos> Mr. Rory, will you please stop?<eos> Ah, relax.<eos> Why would Thawne use the Spear of Destiny to shrink you?
I believe in you.<eos> You're stronger than you know.<eos> There's no place like home. Well, the cork broke off, but I think I managed to salvage it.<eos> Here.<eos> To doing movie night more often.<eos> This never happened.<eos> This is the Spear doing this.<eos> This isn't real.<eos> No, it's not, but it can be.<eos> You can remake reality however you see fit.
I know.<eos> The Gambit, Lian Yu, League of Assassins, you dying.<eos> I could take it all back.<eos> But you won't.<eos> Everything... that has happened to me...<eos> All the suffering that I endured, it's all led to this moment, hasn't it?<eos> The Spear doesn't need someone pure of heart.<eos> It needs someone strong enough to do the right thing.<eos> Sara, it needs you.<eos> Even if doing the right thing... means not having you back?

All right, Malcolm is back in 2016, where he belongs.<eos> - In prison?<eos> - No.<eos> His crappy apartment.<eos> And what are your plans for the two of us?<eos> We're dead in 2017, remember?<eos> I'm not taking you back to 2017.<eos> Should've done this in France, Mick.<eos> Could've saved us both a lot of time.<eos> I didn't bring you here to kill you, Leonard.

Just setting things right.<eos> You mean setting me on the path to killing your sister.<eos> I've already made that choice.<eos> I'm okay with it.<eos> And so is Laurel.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> Hey, Gideon said we're going back to 1942.<eos> The mission's over.

Come on.
Did a couple favors for me.<eos> I did one for him.<eos> Did he happen to mention Rittenhouse?<eos> Yeah, something about a summit in D.C. in 1954.<eos> All of them all together, whatever that means.<eos> Jimmy, tell me you didn't come here just to ask me about this guy Flynn.<eos> I'm here to bring you in, Al.<eos> You're serious?<eos> It's one thing raising hell as kids in Brooklyn, but you're out of control.<eos> I'm sorry, Al. I love you. But someone has to stop you before you hurt more folks.
Flynn says they can't follow him if I do.<eos> - Can't let you do that.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> You'd pull a gun on me?<eos> Your own brother?<eos> Lower your weapon, Al. What are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna... you gonna shoot me?<eos> - But you want to take me to prison, is that right?<eos> Dad must be turning over in his damn grave right now.<eos> Dad wasn't around to see what you became.

I can't see anything now!<eos> This is terrible!<eos> Well, tha-that's why the whole family came to support you.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Oh, wow, that's so kind.<eos> Who's here?<eos> Oh, uh, well, as you know, I'm here.<eos> - Who else?<eos> - Uh, Stewie and Brian.<eos> Hey, hope you feel better soon.
Aw, I don't care.<eos> Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt, your vision will be impaired for a few weeks while you recover.<eos> I recommend you and your wife have someone around to help you during this time.<eos> Well, I'd love to help you, Daddy, but Stewie's just been so fussy lately.<eos> He's constantly crying for no reason.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm fine. Ow!<eos> Bitch!<eos> She does this a lot!<eos> You know, maybe Brian could help you.
Oh, God, this is embarrassing.<eos> I'm so sorry. It's been, like, 500 years.<eos> Aw, this is your big moment and I'm ruining it.<eos> Peter, what the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm learning violin.<eos> It's kind of like my new hobby.<eos> Well, if we're talking about new hobbies...<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a Mason jar filled with layered sand.<eos> You can put it in your bathroom or anywhere you want to feel peaceful.
Thanks, guys.<eos> Hey, guys, guys, put him back up.<eos> I just thought of something.<eos> This is gonna be a blast.<eos> Mr. Pewterschmidt, your service dog has arrived.<eos> - Hey, Carter.<eos> - Brian!<eos> Y-You have a butler?<eos> Then why am I here?<eos> - Why can't he help you?
9:00, Chris.<eos> Look, it's not even about the stuff.<eos> Carter and I became friends.<eos> Wait a minute! Of course!<eos> Whatever you're going to say next, I bet it's wrong.<eos> I offended Carter by offering to work for him.<eos> I mean, once it became a friendship, he didn't want me working for him. He wanted a pal.<eos> Brian, you're not kidding anyone.<eos> We all know you don't care about Carter.<eos> You only care about his money.
Um... you've got a friend in me?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I-I thought you were rehearsing with the guys.<eos> Ah, the bastards kicked me out 'cause I'm not good enough.<eos> Oh, and they also taught me that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer, so maybe you should, uh, you know, do the test.<eos> I had cancer, Peter.<eos> Remember?<eos> I was in the hospital? You weren't there for it.<eos> Well, maybe you have it again.<eos> Peter, I'm not falling for your trick, but if you're upset about the guys kicking you out of the group, you can't really blame them.
I was in the hospital? You weren't there for it.<eos> Well, maybe you have it again.<eos> Peter, I'm not falling for your trick, but if you're upset about the guys kicking you out of the group, you can't really blame them.<eos> The violin takes discipline and dedication.<eos> You never even practiced.<eos> They probably thought you were just wasting their time.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I guess... guess I could've been a little more serious about it.<eos> Well, it's not too late.<eos> Maybe you could find a teacher who could help you learn, and if you work at it and get a little better, they'll see you care about them.
But you're not, so I don't want any part of this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it. I get it.<eos> Nah, you-you wouldn't want to help me.<eos> What was I thinking? He...<eos> he's your grandfather.<eos> Even though he did say that thing about you.<eos> What?<eos> What did he say about me? Oh, I...<eos> I'm sorry. I thought I told you.
When I indulge, things tend to get a little, uh... unpredictable.<eos> Maybe I'm in the mood for unpredictable.<eos> That's revenge talking.<eos> You underestimate yourself.<eos> That's a sin I've never been accused of.<eos> Sing me the song again... about the umbrellas.<eos> Yeah. Let's skip coffee and get right to the show tunes.<eos> Aw, please?<eos> Can you hum me a few bars?<eos> You don't remember?
Laura.<eos> We're on in 60 seconds.<eos> Yes, we are. Okay.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hello? Hi, Barry.<eos> Well, I promised Serena that Auntie Mara would walk her down, okay? And here she is.<eos> All right, beautiful.<eos> Ready to go?<eos> Hi, Auntie Mara.<eos> I've got to work late, but I will come in and kiss you.
And mine didn't move at all.<eos> Watch out. Non-stationary bike.<eos> [Titus gasps]<eos> I feel like Whitney Houston in The Bodyguard.<eos> And you're the white guy, Kyle Copner.<eos> I actually haven't seen that movie.<eos> You've not seen the film that inspired my un-started original screenplay<eos> The Bodyguard 2:<eos> Maybe we can watch it together sometime.<eos> Listen, um, I'd invite you in, but there's something I got to tell you.
Look, I just want my Russ back, not-- "a ball of holes"?<eos> I know. It's a lot to take in.<eos> We'll talk again tomorrow, unless my Tinder date tonight is a better murderer than the one last night.<eos> [chuckles] [sighs] [woman speaking indistinctly over PA] [soft classical music playing]<eos> I mean... Refrigerateur, how lovely to peep you.<eos> Kimmy.<eos> Hey.<eos> [Leonora] Kimmy! Kimmy, there you are!<eos> Oh, welcome to our little salon.<eos> Oh! My wife is dying to meet you.
I'm supposed to be at Reuben's before this sweats off and he finds out I can't afford a watch.<eos> [Kimmy] Titus, are you serious?<eos> One minute you're talking about being an adult, and now you're gonna flip out because a baby has a totally normal name?<eos> [Perry] I don't know.<eos> It's a little weird for a baby.<eos> The only Linda I know is my aunt's friend.<eos> She works in human resources.<eos> [Titus] Thank you.<eos> Perry's the only one who's ever supported me.<eos> Are you sure you're not just freaking out about the baby and looking for a dumb excuse to bail?
Did you do it too?<eos> Everybody does it.<eos> You think it's an accident "google" is just "go ogle" without the space?<eos> Sure, it's kind of a moral gray area, but--<eos> No, some things are pretty black-and-white.<eos> Uh, newspapers. A penguin before it goes in a blender. Rainbows if you're a dog.<eos> And snooping on people's secrets.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you knew that stuff was out there.<eos> I feel terrible about what happened to you.
What are you?<eos> Irish?<eos> Man, they've got some heads.<eos> So lookit, what if you didn't have to put in all that effort, okay?<eos> Worrying, hiding, taking a bus to New Jersey to get advice from a unlicensed psychiatrist with a loaded gun in her tights.<eos> To quote Elsa, "Let it go!"<eos> Elsa is my boyfriend's wife.<eos> I grabbed her hair at a high school basketball game.<eos> So, what, I'm just supposed to pretend I don't care?<eos> No, you're supposed to not care.
No, you're supposed to not care.<eos> Look, what would you be doing right now if you weren't in Bumbledick, New Jersey, trying to get in my pants?<eos> Well, I guess I'd be heading to class to see my... friend give a rap lecture on Greek philosophy.<eos> Yes, go do that.<eos> Thanks, Andrea.<eos> God, there's so many bugs in here.<eos> Titus.<eos> Um, come in.<eos> What happened last night?<eos> -I went to pick up Linda... -Mm. When we turned around, you disappeared like the table at that magic show I took you to.
So, where do we look?<eos> I'm not waiting around for some piece of wand.<eos> The only reason I didn't blast that noir-colored nit out of existence is because of Robin.<eos> So, if one of you'd be kind enough to watch her for a minute, I'll do what I intended and go and take care of this.<eos> Well, hold on.<eos> You can't just go down there alone and confront her.<eos> Why not?<eos> What, you think I can't defeat her?<eos> I'm more powerful than you. Really?<eos> Is that why I had to rip out my own heart to save you from the evil queen?
It's said to be hidden in the woods, and there's a horrible monster that guards it.<eos> I need your help to get it.<eos> So, you get a heart.<eos> What do I get out of this little arrangement?<eos> Whatever happened to you using your magic for good?<eos> Well, it's as you said.<eos> I've changed. And using magic to be wicked is a lot more fun.<eos> That may be, but I don't think being wicked is the reason you're not helping me.<eos> You act powerful, but I think you're really afraid.<eos> How dare you talk to me like that.

Yes.<eos> I just don't have much to lose anymore.<eos> Hope you enjoy having dinner by yourself.
So, unless you want the rest of these mines to come crashing down on top of us, don't try to stop me.<eos> Zelena...<eos> We must be near the monster's den.<eos> Well, then let's get on with it.<eos> There's a village full of munchkins I still need to terrorize tonight.<eos> You know, it's just the two of us, zelena.<eos> You don't have to pretend anymore.<eos> Pretend what?<eos> That you'd rather be doing something else.<eos> All right, stanum, tell me... Why am I out here helping you?
That you'd rather be doing something else.<eos> All right, stanum, tell me... Why am I out here helping you?<eos> Because you have nothing better to do. And you'd rather be out in the woods with an old friend than sitting alone in that emerald castle of yours.<eos> That couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> I've got lots of important work to do back at my chambers.<eos> Such as?<eos> Creating one of the most powerful spells ever to exist, one that will allow me to travel back in time.<eos> And where exactly do you plan on going with this time-travel spell?<eos> Back to the beginning, to when my mother gave me up, to show her I'm more powerful than my sister, that I'm the one she should have kept.<eos> Seems like you're going to an awful lot of trouble to be with someone who didn't want you to begin with. Careful.
But worry not. You won't be around to regret your mistake much longer.<eos> No one will.<eos> These are my woods, so I think it's time you learned who's really king of this forest.<eos> Me.<eos> Zelena.<eos> And here I thought lions were supposed to be brave.<eos> Coward.<eos> You saved me.<eos> You're lucky I did.<eos> What's happening to you?
Because there's no magic in that heart.<eos> It's just a worthless piece of glass.<eos> For it to work, it needs someone else's magic...<eos> My magic.<eos> You knew about this.<eos> Zelena, I swear I had no idea.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Who put you up to this? Was it Dorothy?<eos> I never should have let that gingham-clad goody-two-shoes go back to her wretched little farm.<eos> I don't know anyone named Dorothy, and I promise you, I-i would never trick you like that.
I never should have let that gingham-clad goody-two-shoes go back to her wretched little farm.<eos> I don't know anyone named Dorothy, and I promise you, I-i would never trick you like that.<eos> You want to know how to find what it is you're searching for? This is it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's what I was trying to tell you before the lion attack.<eos> You don't need a time-travel spell so you won't be alone.<eos> You just need some friends.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> like you?<eos> Do you actually think I would give up my magic to save you?

She can get the dwarfs to start mining this stuff. It could come in handy.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> She was the first person I called to locate that wand fragment.<eos> I left a dozen messages, but I haven't heard back.<eos> Gold.<eos> Gold's got her in the back of his shop.<eos> I-I'm not not proud of what I did, but I did what I thought was best for myself.<eos> We both did.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We're here to help you. You're welcome.
Carl, I'm in the only safe place left here now.<eos> Got Sabatino!<eos> He's still alive. I got his cell phone.<eos> I need you to get everything you can off it.<eos> See if you can locate Ferris's phone.<eos> The man holding Kensi is a CIA officer.<eos> Ferris is his real name.<eos> We thought you were Taliban.<eos> - It was a mistake.<eos> - That should have never happened if you hadn't have been meddling in things that don't concern you!
- Yeah, well, you're creeping me out. - Aw. This really is personal to you, isn't it?<eos> I mean, look.<eos> Payback for what I did to your leg, I get that, trust me.<eos> And on that note...<eos> You wanted... you wanted me to choose you over Deeks, didn't you?<eos> I figured if I could hurt you in more ways than one, why not?<eos> Or maybe spending all those months in Afghanistan with nothing but a horse between your legs kind of got old?<eos> Sweetheart, you were a job.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe I made you feel like losing your leg didn't matter.
Hopefully that bought us some time, forced him to change his plans.<eos> Let's hope.<eos> Yep. You know the drill, Special K.<eos> There you go.<eos> Nighty-night.<eos> Deeks!<eos> Hold up! Kensi's inside, and she's in trouble.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Yeah, alone.<eos> You don't know what's on the other side of that door. And you don't have a partner with you for backup.
Yes, it could.<eos> In person, that's powerful.<eos> I've seen it happen before.<eos> My son is still a child.<eos> I cannot let that man anywhere near him.<eos> Hi!<eos> Oh, hi!<eos> Thanks for this morning.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I haven't see you on the bus before.
What are you talking about?<eos> What did the ed say?<eos> She said you didn't form close friendships.<eos> What would she know, she barely knows who I am.<eos> Oh, I don't know, she asked your Form teacher, then.<eos> He thinks there's something wrong with everyone.<eos> Of course, I've got friends!<eos> You didn't believe it, did you?<eos> Well, I don't know what to believe<eos> Is there something worrying you?
Can you get that?<eos> Right.<eos> You're missing the party!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've come to get some plates.<eos> Well, let me help you.<eos> You're very polite!<eos> Now, come on. Come and join in.<eos> What?<eos> Have you made a decision yet?
Was it ever disclosed that the Smiley Face sticker was found on the steering wheel?<eos> Of all the cases for you to obsess over...<eos> - 16 people died! - I'm still on the case.<eos> You're retired.<eos> You did so good!<eos> Can you smile for the camera?<eos> Look right at Grandma.<eos> It's certainly a big day, one month old.<eos> You know, if you were a dog, you'd be like five years old. Is that right?<eos> I think you got the math a little backwards, sweetie. Yeah.
Okay.<eos> Who's out there?<eos> Who's there?<eos> I'm not in the fucking mood.<eos> I will blow your head off, so help me, God.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Fred, for fuck's sake.<eos> Freeze! You!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Don't you fucking move!
In three weeks, as you know,<eos> The Edmund Mills Arts Center is having its groundbreaking gala.<eos> Thousands of people figure to be there.<eos> I'm told even the Governor.<eos> Depending on who's running the store,<eos> I'm gonna need either or both of you manning our booth there.<eos> This is a business opportunity for us.<eos> I cannot have you flippant.<eos> I cannot have you impersonable.<eos> I cannot have you "a little off."
- Come on, push!<eos> I know you can do it!<eos> Push!<eos> You got to believe in it!<eos> Push! Push!<eos> Come on, Barbara!<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> One more pound today. Two pounds!<eos> You push yourself!<eos> If you want it, you're gonna have to go get it.
You try harder, Barbara.<eos> That's what it's about.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> That's it. That's all you have to do.<eos> What'cha doing?<eos> Jumping Jacks.<eos> What does it look like I'm doing? Come on, Barbara.<eos> Come on, Barbara.<eos> You got to push.<eos> You got to push if you want it.
Jumping Jacks.<eos> What does it look like I'm doing? Come on, Barbara.<eos> Come on, Barbara.<eos> You got to push.<eos> You got to push if you want it.<eos> Push yourself.<eos> I know you can do it.<eos> Push. Let's go, Barbara.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Don't you dare stop!

Those are my agents up there.<eos> They have this situation under control.<eos> Tell your men.<eos> This is bad.<eos> The yeti myth is part of their identity.<eos> Any move he makes will be seen as aggression.<eos> Mae, you're about to have company.<eos> Ian, there are men coming and they wanna hurt you.<eos> Please, this is what Charlotte would've wanted.<eos> He can't understand you.
- I'm sorry. - And then when you do call, you're dressed like freakin' Jackie O, you got someone's blood on you, and even then, it's like,<eos> "Patch this guy up and get the hell out of here."<eos> It is not safe for you to be here right now, and I just... you have to go.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop saying you're sorry.<eos> I... I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.<eos> - Explain it to me!<eos> - I can't! I...<eos> I can't.<eos> What happened to you, Lucy?
I... I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.<eos> - Explain it to me!<eos> - I can't! I...<eos> I can't.<eos> What happened to you, Lucy?<eos> It's like someone stole my fiancée and replaced her with... whatever this is.<eos> - Lucy, this isn't you.<eos> - See, that is the thing, Noah.<eos> This is me.<eos> That person that you knew, that person that you fell in love with, that wasn't me. That was someone else, and I wish that I could explain how or why, but I can't.
- See, that is the thing, Noah.<eos> This is me.<eos> That person that you knew, that person that you fell in love with, that wasn't me. That was someone else, and I wish that I could explain how or why, but I can't.<eos> But I will never be that person.<eos> It's 'cause of that guy?<eos> Wyatt?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Noah, you are incredible, and you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy, but... it's just... it's not me.
Oh, well, let me just check Wikipedia for sending an additional organism through a wormhole.<eos> Got something on the security camera.<eos> I thought you said you weren't followed.<eos> Those aren't government vehicles.<eos> It's Rittenhouse.<eos> Get in the Lifeboat.<eos> I'll hold them off. Rufus, I'm sorry.<eos> We got to go.<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> - You can't.
- It's red.<eos> - I was rubbing it.<eos> It's, like, super, like, spaghetti-sauce red.<eos> What if this is because we put four people in the Lifeboat?<eos> Or it's a bloodshot eye.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your Wyatt's fine.<eos> And I take it Rufus has recovered too.<eos> I just wanted you to know when I destroy Rittenhouse tonight... and I will... that also includes your grandfather,<eos> Ethan Cahill, which means... honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen to you, but whatever it is, it's probably not good.
What do you want from me? My blessing?<eos> I don't want anything from you.<eos> You don't want anything from me?<eos> I think deep down there's some part... some human part of you that wants me to stop you.<eos> God, I swear, this game that we keep playing... nobody wins, nobody loses, people keep dying.<eos> What's the body count so far?<eos> And for what?<eos> Okay, now's the time where you tell me what a monster I am?<eos> I don't think you're a monster anymore.<eos> I used to. But now I just think that you're sad, and you're lonely.
Rufus deserves better.<eos> Rufus is a lot faster at that, by the way.<eos> That's him.<eos> Okay, Grandpa, where are you going?<eos> Is it just me or is Rittenhouse way more gay than I thought it would be?<eos> I don't think this is the Rittenhouse summit.<eos> I think this might be a gay bar.<eos> Well then what is your grandpa... ohh.<eos> Wyatt, do you copy?<eos> Wyatt! Would you sit down? You're gonna bust your stitches.
I know that you don't want to kill a room full of people upstairs.<eos> I don't want to kill them. I have to kill them to put my wife and child back on this earth.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - You don't know that and both of you would do the same.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right. We would.<eos> We are all so caught up in our grief, in our past, in our pain, and we can't let go, so we just continue to hurt more people.<eos> I prayed to God... for answers.<eos> And he led me here to this.<eos> What if he led you to me?
You give me the Rittenhouse names, I'll give you every phone call they've made, every email they've ever sent, every willy pic they've ever sexted.<eos> Would that help?<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - Uh, we both know whatever happened to me isn't anything they can fix here.<eos> Okay, take it easy there, tough guy.<eos> We're just gonna sit and watch season two of "The A-Team" in its entirety, got it?<eos> Hey, Rufus, back in '54, um... I couldn't open my eyes, but I heard everything you said.<eos> What did I say?<eos> I've been waiting 60 years to tell you.<eos> I love you too.
Ah, the Lifeboat will be charged and ready to go in three hours, my friends.<eos> Will you tell Rufus I'll be back in an hour?<eos> There's just one thing I have to do first.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Oh, Lucy!<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> - It's been days.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> - I know.<eos> - I have to tell you something.
Yes. I have a sister.<eos> You have another daughter, and her name is Amy, and she is smart, and she is funny, and she has a degree in sociology, and a black belt in karate, which is super weird,<eos> and she has no idea what she wants to do with her life, but oh, my God, does she know how to live it, and she is my best friend.<eos> Lucy, this person doesn't exist.<eos> Yes, this person does exist.<eos> If you could remember the way that we were as a family... if you woke up one day and I was suddenly gone, you would have to do the same thing.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - I have to get her back. I have to get her back.<eos> And the problem is that... in the timeline that Amy existed, you were sick... you were very... you were very sick.<eos> And I am gonna do everything that I can to save you, but time travel is super unpredictable, and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to, so I just want to tell you that I... I love you.
With air temps hovering right around freezing...<eos> Okay, nerd, let's get something straight.<eos> I need your help, but I am not your friend.<eos> I will not be making you over for a dance, and if you take your glasses off, I will not be all, "Wait. Kyle?"<eos> [laughs] I'm cool, okay?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -[sighs] I need a standard five-year boom box tune-up.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what that is.<eos> Is it a Zune?<eos> This is why everybody hates you, Kyle.
It's time to go, girl.<eos> [woman] Is an overactive bladder the boss of you?<eos> Talk to your doctor about Urethrex.<eos> No one tells me what to do.<eos> What the foop is this soup?<eos> [cartoon bladder] What the foop is this soup?<eos> Thanks, Scott.<eos> Councilwoman Kaushtupper.<eos> I hope Titus is feeling better.<eos> What's it to you?
Sean Penn isn't real.<eos> They just made him up to scare kids.<eos> Drench Thunderman is Reverending the entire city.<eos> I've got to warn people that he's just a liar with amazing teeth.<eos> Turn on the news.<eos> That's where all the old-people commercials are.<eos> My likeness and my mouthness were stolen by a drug company.<eos> They turned me into a bladder.<eos> Brother, you're always thinking that people are ripping you off.<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure that guy who loves Patti LaBelle's pies isn't copying you.
[sighs] Rule one: make them remember you.<eos> Foop. It's time to go, girl.<eos> They used every part of the Titus, including my ability to make up catchphrases at will.<eos> "Get small, muchachos."<eos> [Kimmy] Titus, wait.<eos> There's more videos of you on there.<eos> What?<eos> How? This is Big Pharma we're talking about, man.<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> They've had a P.I. following you around for months, taping you so I could learn your voice.
I'm a villain, Kimmy.<eos> Maybe that's why I love capes so much.<eos> [mysterious musical flourish] All these years, I blamed a cruel and jealous world for my lack of success, but it's my fault.<eos> Because like that little bladder, I only care about number one.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's not true. I've ruined every opportunity I've ever been given.<eos> But you got that part in Mahogany.<eos> By accident.<eos> And they loved you.<eos> You were the star of the show.
Until the ratings come in.<eos> [sighs] [upbeat music]<eos> [Russ] Why do people keep baring their teeth at me?<eos> Oh, no, Russ, they're just smiling.<eos> People smile when they see something beautiful.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> Especially once we get you some new clothes.<eos> Yeah, the doctor said I could shop at regular clothing stores now.<eos> You know I don't care what you look like, right?<eos> I'm just happy to have you back.
So they can't even walk.<eos> God, I want you.<eos> Everybody leave!<eos> Thanks, Sam.<eos> Ooh, hey, hot stuff.<eos> Lillian.<eos> Listen... there's something I've been wanting to ask you.<eos> Would you like to take a trip with me? A trip?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> What do you wanna do?
-It's called Profiles--<eos> -Really?<eos> Is she married to that?<eos> It's not fair.<eos> First Jacqueline gets a hottie with a body-- trademark me, 1994-- and now you're gonna be on TV, and TV's in yet another golden age.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> Mr. Donnie Wahlberg gave up music superstardom for exactly this kind of opportunity.<eos> But Xan wants me to talk about the bunker.<eos> It's bad enough that everyone can just look me up on the Internet, but I don't want people to see me as some symbol.<eos> Don't worry. Everyone just thinks of you as Titus' busted hag.
-[Cyndee squeals] [both laugh]<eos> How does this look?<eos> After the Post story, I really feel like people are gonna expect a vest.<eos> What's going on here, Russ?<eos> Do you not like it?<eos> I was gonna wear it to the launch party for Skinnygirl baby formula this weekend.<eos> Look, I know, for you, this is a whole new world.<eos> -I feel like Jasmine.<eos> -Not Aladdin?<eos> But I feel like all this attention is making you forget what we're trying to do here.
Of course. No, the toilet rat.<eos> It's going extinct.<eos> Who cares?<eos> I hope it does!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, that weird, unloved little creature, that's who I used to be, and I don't want to be reminded of it.<eos> 'Cause I'm a pretty tiger now.<eos> Every minute of my life has been a struggle, against animal poachers and slum lords and my own family.<eos> I know.<eos> Your brothers nearly punch-buggied you to death.
[sighs] Russ, this is still inside you.<eos> I know. Because my brothers...<eos> No, I mean, that kid in the attic is a big part of who you are, and I don't want to lose him.<eos> I do.<eos> I was in the attic because I was hiding from my family.<eos> I know. They tormented you.<eos> So you've always stood up for the less fortunate, the unloved, the little guy, and that's why your family is on their way up here right now.<eos> What? No!<eos> No, no!<eos> I'm sorry, but if you're gonna remember what it's like to be the underdog, I'm gonna have to pile some dogs on you.
-There he is!<eos> No, don't hit me!<eos> [all laugh] What's happening?<eos> What? Can't a father hug his son?<eos> Ooh, I am so proud of you, going from dud to stud like this!<eos> We couldn't believe it when we saw your picture in Hot Beef.<eos> [Drew] It's a magazine that Flash and I use to get pumped for workouts.<eos> Oh, boy, this is a lot to take in. Said the tailor.<eos> Got a sec, Teach?<eos> I've asked you not to call me that.
Oh, no.<eos> Hotsy-totsy Liberace. I've killed another one.<eos> [stately trumpet music]<eos> Good evening. I'm Xanthippe Voorhees. And welcome to the first-ever episode of Profiles.<eos> My guest tonight is a symbol of courage and hope.<eos> So all you Xan-Heads out there, please give a warm welcome to Kimmy Schmidt.<eos> Thank you, Xan.<eos> I can't believe that high school girl I once caught trying to bury her wet sheets in the garden has a TV show.<eos> No! Why?<eos> Just tell us what happened to you.
How's she doing?<eos> I don't know, to be honest.<eos> Left her a bunch of messages, but she kind of went into isolation after everything that happened.<eos> Well, now that we have Gray in custody, hopefully it brings her some sense of closure.<eos> Yeah. How's the psych eval going?<eos> Should be done soon.<eos> How we doing on the blood?<eos> It'll be 24 hours until we have a full DNA analysis.<eos> But I spoke to the lab, and, they're gonna get us prelim results as soon as they can.<eos> Does it strike you as odd?
The House is the holdup.<eos> We have a few things we need to figure out. Where are the votes? Who are the swings?<eos> We also need to figure out who's framing Raina.<eos> If they work for the Collaborators and we expose their hand in this, maybe we could reverse this wave of fear fueling the vote.<eos> Good.<eos> Take point on that.<eos> The rest of you, huddle up.<eos> This is now our war room.<eos> Golden Boy's back in his element.<eos> After watching you kick down doors and shoot guns, now you get to see what I can do.
It's not a sure thing. I mean, she hasn't even gotten in yet.<eos> I'm just jumping the gun 'cause of the sale and...<eos> Well, I should... I should run.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, this is Miles. You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I'm calling to say in case you were thinking of calling me, don't.<eos> I am much happier since you left suddenly, with no warning.
She wants to have sex.<eos> I told you, dude!<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> The proposition of sex makes the dance seem much more worthwhile.<eos> So what are we waiting for, Cinderella?<eos> Let's get you ready for the ball.<eos> And by "ball," I mean ballsdeep.<eos> Knockknock. I solved your problem. I called JJ's mom.<eos> I specifically asked you not to call anyone.<eos> What are you doing? Why are you lying down?
So what are we waiting for, Cinderella?<eos> Let's get you ready for the ball.<eos> And by "ball," I mean ballsdeep.<eos> Knockknock. I solved your problem. I called JJ's mom.<eos> I specifically asked you not to call anyone.<eos> What are you doing? Why are you lying down?<eos> Turns out, someone made a mountain out of a molehill.<eos> Seriously, you're weirding me out.<eos> The girls are not angry at you.<eos> They're just sad that you're leaving.
I really need to get to youth group.<eos> Yeah, I don't think so, Sharice.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I've known you since the third grade. I've handwashed your retainer.<eos> I keep mintflavored Oreos at the house for you.<eos> Now I want to know what's going on, and I want to know now.<eos> Okay, I know.<eos> I messed up, and I'm so sorry.<eos> Casey's my best friend, and...<eos> When I heard you were leaving I just got upset. I can't believe you didn't tell me.
boots, I'm an eight.<eos> MSN Search, AltaVista, and...<eos> Ask Jeeves.<eos> You?<eos> Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.<eos> Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?<eos> Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Bert, I insist that you join us.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Bert, I insist that you join us.<eos> You really wouldn't mind?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Amy? Fine with me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll go grab a chair.<eos> Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.<eos> Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.<eos> So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?
I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.<eos> This isn't fair.<eos> You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.<eos> That's different!<eos> She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!<eos> That lady has a name.<eos> I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her?<eos> Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.<eos> When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.<eos> How'd you get by?
Screw that.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I've been dodging the score all day.<eos> I'm just trying to find my lucky shirt.<eos> Why do you need the lucky shirt if the game's already over?<eos> Hey, check me out.<eos> Do i look like a trashy whore or what?<eos> what'd you do to my shirt?<eos> I made it sexy.<eos> Sabrina, how would you feel if i just ran around Stealing your clothes?
Ugh! It's for the maloney's white trash party, okay?<eos> It's the biggest party of the year.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Well, in that case.<eos> It's gonna be awesome.<eos> The youngest one, danny, Is in my grade, so i get to go this year.<eos> I heard their sister's bringing a bunch of her friends From st.<eos> Margaret's.<eos> Oh, yeah. The place is gonna be running wild With repressed catholic school girls.<eos> Don't pretend that doesn't terrify you.
Wh-what is this?<eos> What the hell?<eos> no!<eos> No!<eos> We're trapped! Hey! You let us out!<eos> Sorry, we got to run.<eos> We have a party to get to. Oh!<eos> You better hope i never get out of this room!<eos> Oh, i almost forgot.<eos> Ben has something he wants to tell you.
We're trapped! Hey! You let us out!<eos> Sorry, we got to run.<eos> We have a party to get to. Oh!<eos> You better hope i never get out of this room!<eos> Oh, i almost forgot.<eos> Ben has something he wants to tell you.<eos> Go ahead, ben.<eos> Say the thing.<eos> Sox lost, three to zero!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!
Just tell me what's wrong.<eos> Okay, I, uh... I spoke to Rachel this morning.<eos> Who's Rachel?<eos> His ex-wife. And?<eos> You know, come to think of it, I don't... we don't need to discuss this now in front of, uh...<eos> What, you mean me?<eos> Yeah, you.<eos> Listen to me, muscles.<eos> I gave my name to three different women, only to have it thrown back in my face.<eos> So if anybody can give you good advice in the world of ex-wives, it's me.
Great work.<eos> Uh, let me know when you get something else.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> What's up?<eos> Can you, um, can you come in here for a second, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Um, despite, uh, the little voice in my head that is constantly telling me to never listen to you, I ignored it, and I went and I called Stan.
Well, y-you have to get her back.<eos> We're gonna do everything in our power.<eos> You don't, um, understand.<eos> I was the one who told them about Natasha.<eos> All right, listen, to me,<eos> Celine, I'm sure you didn't have an option.<eos> You don't blame yourself now, okay? Right.<eos> I'm not the only one to blame here.<eos> So now we know what I am worth to you.<eos> Celine, I am so sorry for what I put you through, and for this thing with Natasha, I...
Ah, I'm getting too slow for this, Steve.<eos> In my prime, I would've seen all the angles.<eos> You were the one who did see all the angles, all right?<eos> If it wasn't for you, we'd still be trying to figure this thing out.<eos> Now listen, relax, come with me,<eos> I'm gonna I buy you a couple of beers, you can tell me some stories about my old man.<eos> What do you say?<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> I got a poker game to got to tonight.<eos> There's an empty seat if you want in.
And what will it do?<eos> Destroy my magic.<eos> Maybe postponing the wedding is the best thing, until we know that the Black Fairy can't interrupt.<eos> Tiger Lily said it had been used to banish the Black Fairy once.<eos> If we can find the other half, perhaps we can do it again.<eos> That wand was never the reason I wanted that insipid fairy asleep.<eos> Then what was it?<eos> She knows my darkest secret.<eos> Hello, Rumple.<eos> When you join me, we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.
Did that make you feel better?<eos> No.<eos> Look, this is about defeating your mother, isn't it?<eos> Rumple, stop it.<eos> You're letting her get under your skin.<eos> She has Gideon's heart.<eos> I've already lost one son, Belle.<eos> I can't lose another.<eos> And you won't... not as long as his mother's drawing breath.<eos> He's so lucky to have you.
Now back away, all of you.<eos> Fairies have such delicate necks.<eos> You should listen to her, Father.<eos> She always makes good on her promises.<eos> And what about the promise of a mother to a son?<eos> Careful of your emotions, Rumple.<eos> They run strongly in our family...<eos> As Blue is about to find out.<eos> I'm sorry I had to do this, Father. Goodbye.<eos> I'm afraid your magic is no longer any use to you.
In this place, even the Black Fairy cannot control him.<eos> The dream realm, huh?<eos> Thought there'd be, like, flying pigs or talking doughnuts or something.<eos> Well, if you're not impressed, I can leave you here while I find Gideon.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Isn't this his dream?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> - Dreams a-are a maze.<eos> - Then why am I here?<eos> You are here to stop you from doing anything back there.
Well, Saviors have the luxury of always doing the right thing.<eos> I do not.<eos> Where is he out here?<eos> What is this place?<eos> I was born here...<eos> Not that it was ever much of a home, after my mother left.<eos> This isn't Gideon's dream, is it?<eos> It's yours.<eos> It would seem so.<eos> If you don't mind, I've, uh... I've spent enough time here already.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where it is.<eos> She has it well-hidden.<eos> - Then we're lost.<eos> - No.<eos> There is something here of use.<eos> The one thing she's afraid of...<eos> You learning her darkest secret.<eos> And what is that?<eos> The reason she gave you up.
I should have buried you in that dwarf mine.<eos> Yes, but you didn't.<eos> And now, thanks to my sister, your plan is over.<eos> That witch made a fatal mistake...<eos> One you're going to have to pay for right now.<eos> Miss me?<eos> You know, this whole driving thing's quite easy when you're actually trying to hit something.<eos> So, what now?<eos> I'm just supposed to stare at this blanket and hope my memories appear?<eos> Your mother doesn't want you to know why she gave you up, so that's exactly what we need to find out.
Yes, it's true.<eos> All these years...<eos> All these years I've known there was a good man behind the beast.<eos> Now you know it, too.<eos> I don't know what I know... but I know I must do this.<eos> Let me help you. I can... No.<eos> I've put you in enough danger.<eos> I think it's best that I face my mother alone.<eos> I see you've mended that dreadful thing.<eos> This wand was meant to destroy you... as was I.
Let me help you. I can... No.<eos> I've put you in enough danger.<eos> I think it's best that I face my mother alone.<eos> I see you've mended that dreadful thing.<eos> This wand was meant to destroy you... as was I.<eos> You found out.<eos> In some ways, I always knew.<eos> Just needed to remember.<eos> I was meant to be the Savior, Mother.<eos> You were just afraid that I would kill you, and that's why you left me.
Why did you want me to believe you hated me?<eos> I was banished to that empty, wretched place, Rumple.<eos> It was easier to let you hate me, at least until we found a way for us to be together.<eos> You didn't have to be banished.<eos> You chose your power over mine.<eos> I was trying to protect you.<eos> As someone who has made the very same decision, I know a lie when I hear it.<eos> You sentenced me to a life of cowardice.<eos> I altered your fate so that we could be a family together.<eos> Everything I did was for you, to protect you.
Well, some were more successful than others, admittedly, but... you and I have been through quite a lot together, haven't we?<eos> Which is why I'm asking for your assistance now...<eos> And this might be the most important mission yet...<eos> Operation Best Man.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm honored.<eos> Well, it is an honor, but with it comes great responsibility.<eos> For the next 24 hours, you and you alone will be the keeper of this most valuable treasure... The wedding rings.<eos> And guard them with your life.<eos> If you lose them, your mother will most certainly kill you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'll get 'em to quiet down.<eos> And I'm sure the other neighbors can hear, too.<eos> We can!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> If you were younger, I'd call Child Services.<eos> No, please don't go!<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, but you make me crazy.
What if I can't discipline them?<eos> It's not like with my housekeeper, where I can just threaten her with deportation, right?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You know, you really shouldn't text during the meeting.<eos> Yeah, you really shouldn't have Ben Franklin's haircut, but here we are.<eos> That's who it is.<eos> He's not officially divorced.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> He never said a word.<eos> Since when do you care if a guy's divorced?
Thanks, baby.<eos> You always bring me back down to Earth.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Oh, God, that's why I woke up with my thumb in her mouth.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Over easy, just the way you like 'em.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You were really something last night.<eos> Aw, I just do those things to show how much I love you.
So...<eos> What you got going today?<eos> Actually, I'm gonna see my ex-wife<eos> - for lunch. - Liar!<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Uh, um, she's coming over with my dog, and we got some stuff to talk about.<eos> Well, why didn't you tell me last night?<eos> 'Cause you were doing those things, and I'm not stupid.<eos> Okay, just so we're clear.<eos> Your ex-wife, who you're not really divorced from, is coming over to chat, and there's a dog.
I'm sorry. What?<eos> Hang on.<eos> It's Adam.<eos> "Come outside.<eos> Bring a bowl of water."<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What does "English muffins" mean?<eos> And why did you have my thumb in your mouth?<eos> I thought it was about time you two met.<eos> Samson, this is the crazy woman I was telling you about.
USA! USA!<eos> All the international hosts are ready.<eos> The question is, is Gundam Kim ready?<eos> Let's see if his days as a backup dancer in a boy band will give him the flexibility he'll need to maneuver through this obstacle course.<eos> And he dances across the jaws of the Beast for his first ten points.<eos> - He's doing it!<eos> - It shows how much he's...<eos> So, look at him!<eos> There's all the showmanship in the world!<eos> Let me tell you something, I like this guy!
I got to be quick.<eos> Ever since Wayne disappeared, they've got us on even tighter lockdown.<eos> Does the Council of Elders suspect foul play?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> They got conspiracy theories on why certain squirrels show up when they do.<eos> Since Wayne's disappearance is an actual mystery, they're going nuts; I swear they're watching me.<eos> Can you hang on for another 72 hours?<eos> HQ shutting it down?<eos> Got to release Wayne's body.<eos> So we need you to focus on collecting significant Intel now.
I believe we just made a deal to convince an actress to go to a despot's birthday party in Central Asia so that we can combat human trafficking.<eos> And we thought this was just gonna be the boring budget day.<eos> - Mm. - Tomorrow we slay.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> That was late for a budget day.<eos> Yeah, well, it turned into a kind of different day..<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Mm. Hi, baby.<eos> How are you feeling?
I-I might have missed that one, but I'm definitely a fan.<eos> Yeah, as it turns out, so is President Kenatbek Nogoyev of Kyrgyzstan.<eos> Oh, how nice.<eos> We understand that he invited Ashley to his birthday celebration in Bishkek.<eos> Well, Ashley gets a lot of invitations.<eos> Of course.<eos> We're looking to improve diplomatic relations in the region and thought as a cultural exchange, we might be able to lift the travel advisory for the sake of a meeting.<eos> Uh, Mom, that's the guy...<eos> He invited me awhile ago, but I just can't associate myself with the human rights situation there.<eos> It is good to know that you're interested in human rights, Ashley, because we would like to offer you the opportunity to serve your country on an important mission.
And, whatever you do, watch your backs.<eos> These people are not playing around.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up? I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know who else to call.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Someone's trying to kill me.<eos> N-N-Not just me. All of us.<eos> Home sweet home.<eos> Dayana, if you don't mind, I would love to have my old roomie back.
I didn't know that.<eos> I didn't think you cared.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I mean I don't. I-I mean...<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Whatever I want?<eos> Hey!<eos> You cannot seriously ignore me.<eos> I mean, we're both adults.<eos> I'm not ignoring you. I'm simply disinterested in communicating.
Professional?<eos> Did you just say that?<eos> 'Cause I'm pretty sure that your definition of that and mine do not line up very well. Okay.<eos> All I'm asking is a little courtesy.<eos> A smile, a handshake when I say hello.<eos> I've gotten far on the Hill because of my honesty, directness, my humility.<eos> I can smile and shake hands with people I dislike and disagree with on a fundamental level.<eos> But they never mistake that smile for approval, which, if we're being honest, direct, and true to character, is what you're really seeking from me.<eos> I told my mother I would take this job on one condition... That you were not a part of it.<eos> But since she needed your help during the G20 crisis, she's afraid to let you out of her sight now.
You need to delete this now.<eos> You can delete it yourself.<eos> We don't care about your clients.<eos> We just want to make you one of ours.<eos> I have to talk to the partners, but if you get us a proposal, a follow-up is not out of the question.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Now, why don't we go and enjoy the party?<eos> Okay, so, why don't I head over there with you while my colleague whips up that proposal?<eos> Just don't like to let a potential client go.<eos> You don't mind, Alex, do you?
Funny, I've played that game with you before.<eos> Whatever you show me, it'll definitely not be yours.<eos> Stop me if short-selling stocks based on terrorist activities rings any bells?<eos> I can neither confirm nor deny...<eos> Get up.<eos> We will accomplish so much more together.<eos> Okay, hot.<eos> But is now really the time?<eos> I do have a hotel.<eos> Why do you keep talking?
We got to do that.<eos> I'm gonna bring him back. Just a little drunk.<eos> That's odd.<eos> I'm cross-referencing GIP's clients' trades with other terror attacks, and nothing is lining up at all.<eos> I need to get out now.<eos> With the proceeds we reaped from the RNX crash, you can more than cover my withdrawal.<eos> This only works if the other investors don't get spooked, Em.<eos> Pulling out now...<eos> Looks like one smart investor capitalizing on a freak windfall.<eos> How did you ever think to bet against RNX anyway?
Mayday.<eos> Mayday.<eos> We need immediate help getting out of the GIP.<eos> Harry?<eos> I'm close to the exit.<eos> I'll head over.<eos> But we'll be done for before you even hit the pavement.<eos> Just a last-minute check to finish up the proposal for you.<eos> Were you eavesdropping on us?<eos> There you are, been looking all over for you.
You can't succeed with traitors in your midst. And that's all I see.<eos> I'd rather go back to jail than spend one more day here.<eos> If anyone should be leaving, it should be him, no?<eos> He's right.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> No, you shouldn't.<eos> Clay hates me.<eos> Nothing's gonna change that.<eos> He doesn't hate you. He blames you.
Thank you.<eos> I figured you'd know where to go.<eos> Earl Grey. Whole milk.<eos> - Sweet, you remembered.<eos> - I did.<eos> I'd say it's on you, but your credit cards are maxed out. I checked.<eos> I also checked some other things.<eos> You're no longer in Her Majesty's service.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> What, you think they'd tell you?
They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> I was kicked out by the CIA and the FBI.<eos> The great Alex Parrish has never been unmoored.<eos> You're a national hero.<eos> You'll always be wanted somewhere.
Sure.<eos> Let me just get my coat.<eos> Hello?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Mr. Haas.<eos> Catch up, okay?<eos> My fiancée says I'm too tough on you.<eos> Maxine Griffin.<eos> Founder of The Roster, a networking and visibility platform for professional women committed to helping each other rise.<eos> My father tell you that, too?
I do not make mistakes in my job.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I will be professional.<eos> I will, too.<eos> Maxine wants to know if you want to come over for dinner next week.<eos> That's a little weird.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Freedom of speech?<eos> I totally agree.<eos> So... if you don't mind, I will just tell her you're busy.
We confirmed it at the highest level.<eos> Everyone in our class, except Leigh, is still very much alive.<eos> You talked to Keyes. That's what you did.<eos> Why would you trust someone on the inside?<eos> He's in on it.<eos> Leon, um... have you talked to someone?<eos> Like a shrink?<eos> I'm not crazy, Alex.<eos> No one is saying that you are, okay?<eos> Just maybe what happened to us stayed with you.
Then we're done.<eos> Dembe, please. Please...<eos> Move.<eos> Okay, uh... what is this?<eos> Raymond's.<eos> He has lockers like this all around the globe.<eos> You want me to hack it so you can steal from Mr. Reddington.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I did not bring you here to steal from Raymond.
We could be mature and talk about the fact that we're both into the same guy.<eos> Or, you know, we could just stew in silence about it.<eos> So Dembe finally went off the deep end, huh?<eos> I can't say I'm surprised, what with the whole package.<eos> You know, strong, silent type, all stoic with the eyes and the phony African accent.<eos> I, for one, never bought it.<eos> Good riddance, you ask me.<eos> Besides, I didn't want to say anything before, but a big black fellow waiting on you hand and foot, very Edgar Rice Burroughs.<eos> I'm in no mood, Glen.<eos> Did you access the footage I asked for?
Who put you up to it?<eos> It wasn't my idea.<eos> Was it the Sanctum Corporation?<eos> - What is Sanctum?<eos> - How did you find him?<eos> Over there.<eos> The folder.<eos> It's a full dossier on Fickman.<eos> His movements, past addresses.<eos> Who hired you to kill him?
- You say this Nemec, she's the one who was attacking Reddington?<eos> Dembe seemed to think so.<eos> But she's been missing for 25 years.<eos> Yeah, I cannot explain it, but had you seen Dembe's face when he saw her name...<eos> It was like he'd seen a ghost.<eos> Cooper's sending a team to pick up Dr. Gallup.<eos> He says Aram is safe.<eos> Aram insists Dembe is innocent.<eos> I need to be the judge of that.<eos> He's not the one hurting you.
I only resort to it in times of extreme necessity.<eos> So believe me when I say, this is both extreme and necessary.<eos> Call her.<eos> She said you'd do this.<eos> She said I'd do what exactly?<eos> Underestimate her.<eos> Baz!<eos> It's me.<eos> Your friends, uhm... the black fella and the man in the hat, Reddington-- they're here.<eos> You said they'd kill me to get you, if this is the last time you hear my voice, know that I didn't give you up.
We did. Yeah, and we're not leaving until we get what we came for.<eos> What'd you come for?<eos> Don't you wanna know how we found you?<eos> Why don't you just tell me what you want?<eos> - You stole our money.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> You can't just take people's money.<eos> You didn't just steal our money.<eos> You took... our dignity.<eos> No one can take that from you unless you give it to them.
This is my girlfriend, Jules.<eos> Jules, meet my sister, Saffron.<eos> She's 30 today.<eos> - So I hear.<eos> - Wow.<eos> It's so lovely to meet you finally.<eos> Nice to meet you too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Wow, so many people that love you in one room.
- Sister of mine?<eos> How did you know about Pottsville?<eos> Well, it turns out I'm a pretty resourceful guy.<eos> Mm, maybe.<eos> Guess I just didn't expect you to go that far to find me.<eos> Maybe you underestimated me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - You seem different, Ezra.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I still see you in there.
Mm, maybe.<eos> Guess I just didn't expect you to go that far to find me.<eos> Maybe you underestimated me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - You seem different, Ezra.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I still see you in there.<eos> You see... Ava?<eos> I see Maddie.<eos> I see you too.
You have the post-party blues?<eos> Mm, no.<eos> Just, you know, a year older.<eos> I don't think I'm any wiser.<eos> Mm, I think you're a lot wiser than you know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Really, thank you for the party, the fireworks, everything.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> And I'm not even done yet.<eos> I mean, you didn't think I was gonna really let your birthday pass without giving you an actual gift, did you?
Right, right, right.<eos> I understand that, Rashad.<eos> That's why I called you.<eos> Well, he hit me up a couple weeks ago.<eos> Wanted me to take care of a situation for him.<eos> You know, turns out, these dudes were trying to shake him for some money.<eos> Wanted me to step in, intervene,<eos> - you know, do my thing.<eos> - Okay, wait, wait.<eos> When did I ask you for information
I mean, I knew her her whole life.<eos> She was... just one of those people, made the world a better place.<eos> I mean, she just... she had a glow.<eos> A chief at CFD, he told me arsonists like to return to the scene of the crime, but I had a real strong hunch you would anyway.<eos> Because I know this crime was personal.<eos> You wanted to hurt someone 'cause someone hurt you.<eos> Tell me if I'm wrong.<eos> [grunts] Tell me if I'm wrong!<eos> So who was it? Hmm?<eos> Who pissed you off, huh?
- You too.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Nicole, hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey.<eos> I was...<eos> - It's Adam, remember?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I last saw you at your husband's birthday.
And He does not love you.<eos> I have done His bidding.<eos> My life's work is in His name.<eos> Your life's work makes Him puke.<eos> I am the Bishop of Gresit!<eos> Your God knows that we wouldn't be here without you.<eos> isn't it?<eos> She was a witch!<eos> Lies? In your house of God?<eos> No wonder He has abandoned you.
did they not? For generations.<eos> Say what you mean.<eos> The Belmonts killed vampires.<eos> Until the good people decided they didn't want us around.<eos> And now Dracula is carrying out an execution order on the human race.<eos> Belmont?<eos> no.<eos> But now... it's time to stop it.<eos> Do you think you can?<eos> What I think... is I'm going to have to kill you.
There. what kind of messiah creates mechanical death traps to buy himself an uninterrupted nap in a stone coffin?<eos> My defenses were not for you.<eos> You could have told your defenses that.<eos> nothing more.<eos> They were not intended to protect me from you.<eos> I asked you a question...<eos> Do you care?<eos> I care about doing my family's work.<eos> I care about saving human lives.<eos> Am I going to have to kill you?
and you sleep in a coffin.<eos> Please.<eos> This isn't a bar fight.<eos> Have some class.<eos> Belmont?<eos> Yeah.<eos> please don't let the vampire's guts ruin my good tunic.<eos> What?<eos> I can still rip your throat out.<eos> but it won't stop me staking you.
I am Adrian Tepes.<eos> Known to the Wallachians as Alucard... son of Vlad Dracula Tepes. to heal the wounds dealt by my father when I attempted to stop him unleashing his demon armies.<eos> You are the sleeping soldier.<eos> I'm aware of the stories.<eos> I'm also aware that the Speakers consider the story to be information from the future.<eos> Do you know the whole story?<eos> Yes.<eos> The sleeping soldier will be met by a hunter and a scholar.<eos> No one told me that.<eos> Why do you think my grandfather tried everything to make you stay?
Swipe "yes" on all the lady faces.<eos> Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe.<eos> Let's, uh, let's get a little light in here, huh, buddy?<eos> The yellow face!<eos> It burns my Tinder!<eos> Oh, my God, he's lost it.<eos> That app's turned Quagmire into some kind of sex ghoul.<eos> The way he's crouching, there's a teste peeking out.<eos> Hey, listen, Quagmire, you're our friend, all right?<eos> We hate to see you like this.
and it's stuck to my knee.<eos> Let's, uh, let's just go.<eos> All right, we got to just throw that phone away and end this once and for all.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> Quagmire's in bad shape.<eos> He looks worse than I did after that day at the beach.<eos> I spanked somebody else's kid.<eos> Sorry I was late.<eos> You're still wearing that back brace?<eos> That can't be good for you.
You don't need your phone.<eos> Don't listen to him. I'm all you need.<eos> Are you really gonna listen to a phone over me?<eos> God, I don't know why I do this anymore.<eos> Don't give up, Miniature Quagmire.<eos> This is exactly why you got into the over-the-shoulder advice business.<eos> Ignore him, Miniature Quagmire.<eos> Give up on your attempt to convince real Quagmire to not use Tinder, and to instead have sex with this woman who's right in front of him.<eos> Wait, what's going on?<eos> I'm just saying, you used to have skills that no one else had, that took you years to hone.
Please, you must listen to me.<eos> Chop, where are you?<eos> Chopper?<eos> I'll find him.<eos> Chopper?<eos> What are you doing in the hyperspace logs?<eos> Updating your database?<eos> You're not making any sense, Chop.<eos> You had files wiped on Killun?<eos> No, if you remember, I always wipe your data after every jump, as a security precaution.
They said you would be the one to help us destroy the Sith. Hmm.<eos> It's the first I've heard of it.<eos> The Rebellion needs you.<eos> We need you to defeat the Empire.<eos> What you need, you already have.<eos> Unfortunately, you seem to be letting it all go.<eos> But if I had what I needed, why would the holocrons send me to you?<eos> They didn't.<eos> Maul did.<eos> Maul used your desire to do good to deceive you, and in doing so he has altered the course of many things.

I will mend this old wound.<eos> Ride north.<eos> That is your way out.<eos> Your way home.<eos> See you soon, apprentice.<eos> Look what has become of you.<eos> A rat in the desert.<eos> Look what I have risen above.<eos> I've come to kill you, but perhaps it's worse to leave you here, festering in your squalor.<eos> If you define yourself by your power to take life, a desire to dominate, to possess, then you have nothing.
Wait, miss?<eos> What happened?<eos> Masha was abducted.<eos> What?<eos> A man was seen carrying her off the campus. A blonde man.<eos> The American?<eos> I started pulling away.<eos> We couldn't continue the way we were.<eos> He didn't take it well.<eos> What, he stole masha to hurt you?
Walk away.<eos> You know how much I love her.<eos> I do.<eos> You'll walk away, then?<eos> Yes.<eos> I love you, Kate.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hope you don't mind.
So, what's next for you?<eos> You gonna find some more Russians to live with?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't think about it right now.<eos> Masha and her family were my whole world for so long.<eos> Well, there are other worlds out there.<eos> My future's in amarillo.<eos> A lot of people sing about amarillo, you know.<eos> George strait, Neil sedaka, rob zombie.<eos> Is that what's leading you there?
No, I kept my word to you.<eos> When you hired me, you told me to choose Elizabeth over you.<eos> And so I tried to help her disappear to a safe place with her newborn daughter. And for that, you put me down like a mad dog.<eos> For the last two decades of my life, you had me convinced I was helping keep Elizabeth safe. But in reality, I was helping you become a monster.<eos> It's time for us to meet and talk.<eos> No, Raymond.<eos> I'm going to do what I should have done years ago.<eos> It took a bullet to my head, but I remember what my father taught me.<eos> Our stories are written in flesh.<eos> And I'm going to use that lesson to render you powerless.
Oh, yeah.<eos> - Like, a whole thing. - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, yeah, we were in love.<eos> Everything, yeah.<eos> For a while.<eos> All right, I'll see you at home.<eos> Yeah, it was crazy.<eos> - See you, guys. - Wow.<eos> You went from kind of "meh" to sort of cool to totally the coolest ever.<eos> I don't want to freak you out, but... that really means a lot to me.
Excuse...<eos> Okay how does...<eos> Okay, just...<eos> - Cheater! - Oh.<eos> Okay, well, that is from a salad I had earlier, and it must've just fallen into my pocket.<eos> Cece.<eos> I can't believe you did this.<eos> It's just...<eos> Okay.<eos> This is gonna be our last mess-around... before I leave, and I just don't want Furguson to leave you, too.
What is an "ut"?<eos> ! Furguson is miserable.<eos> So you're saying that this is a different emotion than we've seen for the past three years?<eos> A father knows.<eos> He misses Gil.<eos> It'd be wrong for me to take away a piece of his heart.<eos> I mean, I already took away his testicles.<eos> Anyway, let me just... _<eos> Proud of you.<eos> You won't need the key I gave you.
Then get it for yourself.<eos> This is a key to my apartment.<eos> You know I've been here all morning. You've been listening yourself.<eos> I haven't touch a thing since you left, so go.<eos> Rummage through the place, see for yourself who I am.<eos> No, I don't need to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I like you, too, okay?<eos> And I understand why you wouldn't trust me or anyone.<eos> I just want to show you why you can so we can move on to the real part.
He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.<eos> I thought your dad paid your cards.<eos> I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.<eos> What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?<eos> That's a penguin I sponsor.<eos> They're losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.<eos> What is Pink Cheeks?<eos> It's intimate waxing.<eos> Quit looking at that!<eos> Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
Just let me have the money for this, and I won't ask for anything else.<eos> You put me in charge of your finances.<eos> If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.<eos> See?<eos> Miserable.<eos> Okay, you're right, I got myself into this, but I've never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.<eos> Your father may have spoiled you, but I won't.<eos> If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.<eos> Yeah, you're a grown man who's highly educated.<eos> You could charge people money to punch you.
Hang-hang on.<eos> So I have to bring Penny, you can't afford it, Howard's gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.<eos> I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.<eos> Mm... how's my favorite girl? Okay.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Making lasagna.<eos> Oh, she's sexy, she can cook.<eos> I'm such a lucky guy. (chuckles)<eos> You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?<eos> I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.
Because you don't want her to go to Comic-Con!<eos> This is an interesting way to stay out of it.<eos> Wait, you don't want me to go?<eos> Well, I just don't think you're gonna have a good time. SHELDON:<eos> Yeah, well, get this:<eos> neither does Penny, that's why she doesn't want to go.<eos> You set 'em up, I knock 'em down, good job.<eos> Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn't?<eos> I just thought it would make you happy.<eos> O-O-O-Okay, hold on, so if you don't want to go and I don't need to bring you, is everything good?
The Alexandria district court is the rocket docket.<eos> I know. But there are delays because of the arresting officers' limited availability.<eos> Because they have to travel from Mexico to Virginia?<eos> And because they have domestic testimony obligations.<eos> This... this is the price we're paying for getting the case moved back to the States.<eos> I'm working directly with the warden on getting extra visiting privileges.<eos> I don't know if I can...<eos> Spencer, listen to me.<eos> There is a strategic silver lining here.<eos> These extra 6 weeks give the BAU time to track down the woman that you remembered.
Not at the same time.<eos> You put in first.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you hangin', man.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm not the boy in the bubble anymore.<eos> Is that good news?<eos> It means the half-life of the radiation used to poison you is very short.
All right.<eos> I'll see you guys later.<eos> Yeah, see you later.<eos> Zach Bower?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're with the FBI.<eos> It's about your dad.<eos> Look, whatever it is, I'm not interested.<eos> I'm late for class.<eos> Stephen Walker sent us to come get you.
Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Uh, hey, amigo... do you still have that emergency fifth of Cuervo behind the booking slips?<eos> Aloha, and welcome aboard.<eos> We're looking at sunny skies all the way to Honolulu.<eos> So sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.<eos> Hi, it's Laura.<eos> I'm not around, so leave a message, and I'll call you back.<eos> Hey, I just called your office.<eos> They said you didn't come in, and they can't reach you.
and being buried in work, I needed some time with her...<eos> and I... and I thought...<eos> That you would take our daughter to Hawaii for two weeks without telling me?<eos> I didn't want you to talk me out of it.<eos> If you had told me you wanted to take Serena out of school for two weeks for a vacation, what would I say?<eos> You can see her now. Thank you very much.<eos> Laura, what would I say?<eos> I'd say no.<eos> That you would think that you need to sneak away, where does that come from?<eos> Do I have to put you on the no-fly list?
- I'll be back late.<eos> - Okay. Please check on Serena and make sure she's okay.<eos> Yeah, of course I will.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> It's a crazy time.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> You're not okay now.<eos> I love you.<eos> Whatever's going on, you can tell me anything.<eos> I love you too.
Yeah.<eos> A lot of days late and a lot of dollars short.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> - Did Mom's car get in an accident?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did... Did Ruby get hurt? - Nothing...<eos> Nothing like that. Everybody's fine.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Why didn't you come before?<eos> Oh, man, you know, sometimes it's like you're asleep and something wakes you up, you know?
We don't seem to have any - contact details for his dad.<eos> - His dad's dead.<eos> Even if Peter does get out, you never have to tell Sam.<eos> They do take everything into account his psychiatric evaluation, - his behaviour in prison.<eos> - My son is still a child.<eos> I cannot let that man anywhere near him.<eos> Is there something worrying you?
You're starting to sound a lot like her.<eos> And you're starting to sound like someone else's son.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sarah?<eos> It's Chrissy.<eos> You look like her.<eos> - Do you think so?<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> Last time I saw you, you just learned to talk.
- She's fine.<eos> Look, she doesn't know anything about what happened.<eos> I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> I don't know what you're - talking about. - Just...<eos> Leave her mother out of it, OK?<eos> Oscar, can you get Dad from the garage?<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Hey, Sam, didn't see you there.
I wondered if I could speak to Oscar?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I just wanted to find out what happened.<eos> Haven't you asked Sam?<eos> - My wife told you the rest,<eos> - so what more is there to discuss?<eos> Just five minutes.<eos> I thought he was going to give me another diving lesson.<eos> I should have taken the hint.<eos> So he pushed you in the shower in your uniform.
What for?<eos> Murder.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Who did he murder?<eos> My mum's boyfriend.<eos> She always made out that she loved my dad, but...<eos> Turns out she ran off with another guy.<eos> That's who Dad killed.<eos> That's screwed up.<eos> It still doesn't give her the right to tell you he's dead.
- She knew you were on her side.<eos> She was a bloody good nurse.<eos> I don't even think she did anything wrong.<eos> I'm really sorry about Cathy.<eos> Oh, it's Sam.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> Are you sure you're all right?<eos> - Do you want me to drive you home?<eos> - No, I'm all right.<eos> Mum, where the hell have you been?
It's Christmas tomorrow.<eos> Not much of a Christmas.<eos> Hey, don't be like that!<eos> I mean...<eos> Still haven't wrapped your present.<eos> Everything's going to be OK.<eos> You'll see.<eos> That looks nice.<eos> - Leg or breast?<eos> - I told you not to bother.
Of what?<eos> The whole last 20 years bit?<eos> What are you saying about my mum?<eos> Oh, your mother was an angel.<eos> Butter wouldn't melt.<eos> But really, she was a conniving, domineering bitch.<eos> She had you under her thumb, didn't she?<eos> She always knew you were weak.<eos> When she died, I thought, 'It's a blessing. '<eos> Perhaps you'd finally step up for once, he a man.
I wouldn't say it if I didn't.<eos> Good to know it's not just me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're both freaks.<eos> Christmas present.<eos> OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's nothing, really, chuck it if you hate it.<eos> It's not that.<eos> I haven't got anything for you.
Mum's agreed.<eos> Going to go and meet him on my own.<eos> Is that OK with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This way, then.<eos> Is that him?<eos> Yes.<eos> And he's...<eos> He's not like I remember him.<eos> Cos it's not him that you remember.
And he's...<eos> He's not like I remember him.<eos> Cos it's not him that you remember.<eos> I told you that.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> - We could go home right now.<eos> - No, Mum.<eos> It's my dad.<eos> OK, but Sam, the conversation might not go the way you want.<eos> If you feel upset at any point, or uncomfortable...
Hello, Sam.<eos> Do I look that bad?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> She told me you were dead.<eos> I can understand why she would have done that.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not her fault.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> What do you remember?
So there's nothing special about you then?<eos> You're just like any other teenage boy.<eos> Very ordinary.<eos> Yes?<eos> What?<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Like what, Sam?<eos> Down on me.<eos> You're looking down on me.<eos> You expect people to look up to you.
Is this the standard speech to delinquents?<eos> - I'm just talking to you, Sam.<eos> - Yeah, because you fancy my mum.<eos> Because I don't want my daughter mixing with a thief.<eos> That chain you gave Chrissy, you stole it, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't steal it.<eos> - And your mum told me about the watch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I can't have Chrissy getting involved with this sort of stuff, so, for everybody's sake, cut it out.<eos> Do you hear me?
Would you?<eos> You've only just met him.<eos> He's just got out of prison, you'd leave your mum?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you'll really like him, when you meet him.<eos> - Me?<eos> Meet him? - Yeah.<eos> Come with me now.<eos> OK, maybe one day.<eos> But if you live with him, if you move, are me and you still...?
I think he killed Kathy.<eos> Chrissy's with him!<eos> - They can't have gone far.<eos> - Let's go to your house first!<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> - Hi, Gran.<eos> - I don't want him in my house.<eos> I don't know how you stand her.<eos> Who do you think you're smirking at?
Peter got out today.<eos> But Sam doesn't know that.<eos> Are you sure he doesn't?<eos> Where's he living?<eos> Could he have taken her there? I<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Oh, come on, Jenny, are you protecting him? - Huh?<eos> Both of them. - Protecting him?<eos> Why, why?<eos> I'm the one that told you what he did!
It was your fault, Chrissy.<eos> You did it, you can't pretend you didn't.<eos> - I didn't... didn't.<eos> - Chrissy, you're a killer.<eos> You killed Margaret.<eos> It's all right, because we spoke about it, didn't we?<eos> How much you hated her.<eos> I understand you and you understand me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't have to feel bad about it.
What are you saying? You...<eos> - You killed...<eos> - Cathy.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> It was so simple.<eos> Come back with me.<eos> You're sick.<eos> You're sick.<eos> You're fucking sick!<eos> You were at her funeral, didn't you feel...
Put your back into it.<eos> Yeah, that's the way.<eos> You just need to be quick, and move the boat, all right?<eos> Come on.<eos> Get down below deck, out of sight.<eos> Sam?<eos> Hello, Jenny.<eos> It's Peter.<eos> Honey, don't hurt them.<eos> Don't you hurt her! So far, they're fine.
Yeah, that's the way.<eos> You just need to be quick, and move the boat, all right?<eos> Come on.<eos> Get down below deck, out of sight.<eos> Sam?<eos> Hello, Jenny.<eos> It's Peter.<eos> Honey, don't hurt them.<eos> Don't you hurt her! So far, they're fine.<eos> It'll all go well, if you do as I say.
I said come on board.<eos> Sam, are you all right?<eos> Where's Chrissy?<eos> - What are you doing here? - It's just us.<eos> - What?<eos> - She ran away, Mum.<eos> We're not supposed to be here. This is<eos> - supposed to be just us, Dad.<eos> - Why are you saying that?<eos> - He doesn't want you, Sam.
You'll be beautiful again.<eos> I'll make sure.<eos> Sam, no!<eos> No!<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> Look at me. Look at me!<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> I had to, Mum.<eos> I had to to save you.
Ángeles may be a saint, but I can't let this go.<eos> -[Victoria] What about Francisco?<eos> -Francisco did all he could.<eos> I convinced one operator, but, Victoria, if the cops show up...<eos> Honey, if they do, you'd better not be there.<eos> -I can't leave now.<eos> -Why's that?<eos> If I do, they'll fire all the girls who have helped me.<eos> Alba sacrificing herself for her friends?<eos> I thought I taught you not to be sentimental and that after what happened to Gimena, you'd learned your lesson.
Why didn't you tell me before?<eos> Because Alba isn't the person she was.<eos> She's changed a lot.<eos> You're not thinking of leaving my sister, are you?<eos> You have to be honest with yourself, Francisco.<eos> We're friends.<eos> That won't change, no matter what you decide.<eos> But Elisa's my sister, and she doesn't deserve to be hurt.<eos> Thanks, Carlos.<eos> She'd eventually get over it, but my father wouldn't rest until he'd destroyed you.
Excuse me, could you leave me alone with Miss Aguilar?<eos> It will just be a moment.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What's all this about?<eos> You know very well that I don't have papers.<eos> I know it, you know it, but they don't.<eos> I know all about you, Don Francisco, your past with him... and this reunion at the station.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I have more.<eos> Maybe you don't care about your life.
-You won't.<eos> -What's taking so long?<eos> -How should I know?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't like the police being here.<eos> [clears throat] Excuse me.<eos> Shall I prepare the dismissal letter?<eos> Whose dismissal?<eos> Um, this girl's built up several work infractions, and considering the criteria for dismissal, I thought--<eos> Carolina, you're not paid to think.
No, but... what's it all about?<eos> Spying for the Cifuentes family.<eos> [Alba] Pretending is a form of lying.<eos> It's the same as not telling the truth about how you really feel.<eos> It's like covering up the truth.<eos> Sometimes, not saying anything is the best kind of lie.<eos> [Francisco] Miss Aguilar.<eos> Mr. Gómez.<eos> Can we discuss what happened in my office with that policeman?<eos> [softly] I've got nothing to say to you, Francisco.
It's not solved yet.<eos> Is there something else?<eos> Beltrán is back.<eos> Right.<eos> So?<eos> [sighs] I don't believe it.<eos> You've fallen again?<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> What?<eos> I warned you to stay away from him, but you let yourself be led-- [shouting] What do you want-- [softly] What do you want me to say?
Now you've got a job, independence, a boyfriend who's about to be rich.<eos> Everything you could want.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Honestly, I didn't think it'd be like this, you know?<eos> I don't want decisions to be made for me, but... maybe it's simpler that way.<eos> Nobody read us the fine print in the contract.<eos> Freedom.<eos> Look, Carlota, when you decide to become independent...<eos> Thanks, Roque.<eos> ...no one warns you being free is a burden.
I gained her trust and told her everything.<eos> She's the one helping me with the tapping for the government delegate.<eos> If you fire her, she might talk about the supposed coup, and then...<eos> I know what could happen.<eos> Tell her to come back.<eos> I'll talk to Ricardo.<eos> Carlota, a little dessert wine?<eos> -No, thanks, Doña Lola. -I'll have a little.<eos> You stick to water.<eos> Alcohol doesn't agree with you.
-I lied to him.<eos> I told him that I...<eos> Look, this is the report from customer support...<eos> [Ángeles] Lidia. Lidia.<eos> Um... it isn't easy for me to say this to you...<eos> You don't have to.<eos> No, I do. I do.<eos> Please.<eos> You were right.<eos> [sighs] I was furious about Mario, and... I didn't even give you the benefit of the doubt.
I made a mistake.<eos> We were mad at each other.<eos> She threw herself at me.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> [Alba] Lies take many forms, and they're everywhere.<eos> I want to be the husband I promised you I'd be.<eos> I want to be the father our children deserve.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> I made it up to find out if you and Carolina were still together, and now I see... she went to you with the story.
[Alba] But why do we do it?<eos> Why do we lie, knowing that the truth could come to light?<eos> Maybe the fear of facing the truth paralyzes us.<eos> Anyway, Ángeles continuing to work is cause for celebration.<eos> Of course. And the more women work, the less we men have to do.<eos> -I'm getting a drink.<eos> He's charming.<eos> Witty, intelligent, fun.<eos> Not many like him left.<eos> So... you needn't worry about me.
Do you want them to see us?<eos> -Get in.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> -No.<eos> I'm not leaving until we talk.<eos> You want to talk?<eos> Let's talk.<eos> I don't want you to do anything for me.<eos> I don't want you to leave anything behind for me.<eos> I don't want you throwing your life away, because I don't love you.
I was so innocent.<eos> -Are you having fun? -[chuckles]<eos> I've never been in such an elegant place. nor in such good company.<eos> [whispering] I must be the envy of all these girls.<eos> Personally, I'd prefer not to have to share your company with all these people.<eos> Would you excuse me? I have to use the powder room.<eos> [Alba] It wasn't long before I learned that reality was much different.<eos> And just what are you doing?<eos> You should find someone else to do this work, Victoria. I can't do it.<eos> You'll never take control of your own life if you're still waiting for Prince Charming to rescue you.

Why let your emotions get the best of you?<eos> [young Alba] What if he tries kissing me again?<eos> That's easy.<eos> You dissuade him... with one of these.<eos> Just sneak one in his drink, and he'll stop bothering you. Mm?

[crowd] Happy New Year!<eos> [Alba] What matters is that no one finds out that... what really rules you is your head and not your heart.
-[Carlos] Where's the girl?<eos> -There was no one here when I arrived. [sighs]<eos> What are you doing here? It's your sister.<eos> She tried to kill herself. What?<eos> How is she?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> [Francisco] I don't know.<eos> It's my fault, Carlos.<eos> [Carlos] How can that be?<eos> [Francisco] There are things I didn't tell you about Alba.
There was no better way to do it.<eos> No, I just didn't want his life to be in danger.<eos> I didn't want to hurt him.<eos> Darling, you can't have everything. I already told you--<eos> Victoria, if you're going to say you warned me, please...<eos> I won't say another word. You're an adult.<eos> I gave you advice.<eos> If you take it, perfect.<eos> If you don't, well... you're the one who'll suffer the consequences.<eos> I guess now you'll have to keep pretending that you're attracted to that man until you get the blueprints.
Because I guess you're willing to make sacrifices for Francisco to keep people from finding out about your mistake, that kiss. Hmm?<eos> I am.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> He's taking a long time.<eos> I'm glad to see that, after all, you're not totally indifferent to what happens in this family. [Carmen] Ricardo, please...<eos> All that matters is that Elisa recovers and that word of this doesn't get out.<eos> Fortunately for us, you show up to worry once the worst is already over. It's a relief.<eos> -I said I was sorry, Father.<eos> -What good is being sorry?<eos> Have you asked yourself what we'd be doing now if Francisco hadn't been here? -[Francisco] It isn't Carlos' fault.
Do you know... Do you know how hard this is for me?<eos> You don't, do you? You have no idea.<eos> [softly] I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you. I just wanted to get on with my life.<eos> Do you have to choose my best friend, my brother-in-law?<eos> I don't believe it! I don't!<eos> I was about to destroy my life and my wife's life for nothing!<eos> Alba... tell me it wasn't for nothing.<eos> I didn't ask you to give up anything for me.<eos> I suppose you'll remember this.
A few days ago, the Telephone Company made the first transatlantic call.<eos> Today, we're here for something perhaps less remarkable, but no less important.<eos> Thanks to everyone's hard work, we now have reached 150,000 subscribers!<eos> And that is due in part to your effort and your dedication.<eos> That is why management is throwing you this little party, as is the custom when we reach subscriber milestones.<eos> Enjoy the evening, and I hope we'll soon reach 200,000. Cheers!<eos> [crowd applauding]<eos> A nice speech and an even nicer gesture for the workers.<eos> Some workers deserve everything.<eos> I was dying to see you after last night. [chuckles] You fell asleep.

[chuckles] You fell asleep.<eos> I thought I had bored you.<eos> No, you could never do that.<eos> I think it was the wine, the champagne.<eos> It was rude of me, and I'd like to make it up to you and finish what had started so well. And what was that?
You're lying to me, Carolina.<eos> Am I?<eos> Ask the others and see what they have to say.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> Mario... let's go. You can go.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> You're not coming home with me?<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Didn't you say you were leaving? So leave.
A project I tried to show my father. He wouldn't listen, as usual.<eos> I won't bore you with technical details... but this machine will vastly improve our efficiency... and increase company profits.<eos> -It must be worth a fortune. -Yes... and no.<eos> How's that?<eos> We have to build a prototype to show that it works.<eos> Without the finished prototype, these papers are worthless.<eos> As soon as I build it... it will be truly revolutionary.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> We're going to my mother's house for a few days... until I can come to terms with what you've done.<eos> Maybe I can forgive you in time, but I cannot stand being here for now.
Maybe I can forgive you in time, but I cannot stand being here for now.<eos> -What are you doing, Mario? -You're not going anywhere.<eos> No!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Mario, no!<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> We are leaving, Mario. [groans]<eos> Take it easy!<eos> -Why are you doing this? What is this?<eos> Are these things that your friends say to you?
You've behaved like a real gentleman... -but if you think walking me home-- -Why did you change your mind?<eos> I'd never been rejected so much.<eos> And suddenly, one night, you let me buy you a drink. Why?<eos> -What do you want from me, Miss Aguilar? -Me?<eos> You realize I could ask you the exact same question, Mr. Cifuentes.<eos> Lidia, you're a mystery to everyone, except me.<eos> I see through that act.<eos> The fact you're always on the defensive is just a front to protect yourself.<eos> If I had to guess why, I'd say someone broke your heart.<eos> But whoever hurt you so much didn't know what he had. And you do?
It's late.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> -What are you doing there?<eos> -I could stay like this all night.<eos> That's because you're the boss and you don't have to get up early.
But knowing Carolina, she won't stop.<eos> If you want to resolve this, you'll have to get rid of that suitcase.<eos> Even if it hurts.<eos> I've located the blueprints for the prototype.<eos> So what's wrong?<eos> I thought that would make you happy.<eos> [Alba] I can't steal them until it's built and it works.<eos> As of now, they're worthless.<eos> I guess you'll have to be patient and spend more time with the rich kid.<eos> Is that what worries you?
See you tonight.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, Pablín... that's your girlfriend, huh?<eos> -Yes.<eos> I didn't know she was coming.<eos> -Don't run away.<eos> -That's quite the guilty expression.<eos> -I haven't done anything.<eos> I didn't say you did, but you do look as guilty as sin.<eos> Be careful what you get yourself into.
I think you and my father have different ideas about family.<eos> Besides, after yesterday... I don't think it's the right time to push his limits.<eos> He's still annoyed about the party?<eos> I think it's the most respect he's shown me in the past 15 years.<eos> Maybe it's as simple as that... standing up to him.<eos> Try it out.<eos> It's time.<eos> Just out of curiosity... how could we get the copper without anyone finding out?<eos> Carlota doesn't know about this.<eos> I won't tell her, if that's what worries you.

I'll steal the rotary blueprints before the company can build it.<eos> Good.<eos> And... what's next?<eos> Gain their trust.<eos> I'll help them get the copper.<eos> Some copper's been stolen in Talavera, and we have to fix the line urgently.<eos> -We can't wait for the usual paperwork--<eos> -Come here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I have to tell you something.
In person, I get embarrassed.<eos> Would I understand if you refused to talk to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course, it would hurt, but I'd understand.<eos> Entirely.<eos> -It's the letter I sent you.<eos> -Yes.<eos> When I tell my grandma, she'll call me a nitwit.<eos> I always knew it was you.<eos> I didn't say anything because I respected your decision and... well... I wanted to give you time to find out for yourself... that you don't need to hide behind anyone else.
What are you doing?<eos> Talking to you.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> You and I don't have much more to say.<eos> You wrote me a note.<eos> There was a letter in the suitcase.<eos> You know I did.<eos> What did it say?<eos> [chuckles] You humiliated me and now you want to make a fool of me.<eos> You want me to tell you I love you so you can reject me?
I'm not going to let you insult me.<eos> Carolina has the letter.<eos> She's going to give it to your wife.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Not to insult you.<eos> What?<eos> [sighs] I didn't read it.<eos> She came into my room when I was out and took it.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> With what happened to Ángeles, I had no time to tell you.
-Why did she have this letter? -Who?<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> -[maid] Madam.<eos> -What?<eos> Miss Lidia Aguilar is here.<eos> And you have the gall to bring her here?<eos> -Never touch me again!<eos> -What's going on here?<eos> Let him tell you!
[Alba] Because, despite what they say, the past was not always better.<eos> But if you forgive the damage it has done to you, the past will become the present, and it will trap you again and won't let you escape.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> [Alba] You have to live in the present and trust in the future.<eos> It's not easy, but who said life was?<eos> How did you manage to get her to believe you?<eos> The main thing is you did, and it's best for all of us.<eos> For all of us or for you, Alba?<eos> I made a mistake when I asked you to stay, but this is over.
What I wanted to say is that, that night, sitting there on the couch...<eos> I know, it isn't like me. I'm a mama's boy.<eos> I love Ubalda's stews.<eos> But since we met, nothing's the same.<eos> Now, I think about the rotary. I think about my father, and I even think about this place.<eos> Lidia... all I know for certain is that you've changed me through and through, and I'm a better person now.<eos> You still think you ruin everything? [drink pouring]<eos> -Can I ask you something? -I can't guarantee an answer.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Who hurt you so much to make you this distrustful?
[woman] Don't waste your time.<eos> Be thankful for what we have and that we get bread and water.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> We were in the Lyceum and there was a raid.<eos> The lecture was legal. They had no right.<eos> They have all the rights we don't have.<eos> Women are second-class beings.<eos> A few months ago, they arrested some students who took off their hats in the Puerta del Sol.<eos> They're still locked up here, two cells over.<eos> If you don't have anyone who can get you out... nothing can save you.
I understand very well what's going on here.<eos> I won't say anything, but don't ask me to keep working as normal.<eos> We're committing a crime, and now I'm an accomplice. -It won't always be like this.<eos> -Well, that's reassuring.<eos> Automation is the future.<eos> You said it.<eos> It will come about.<eos> You'll have what you wanted and we'll stop doing this.<eos> Your father is starting to trust you.<eos> In the end, he'll let you build the prototype.
I hope this setback doesn't affect today's work. Is that understood?<eos> Good day. Miss Aguilar, to my office.<eos> Why did you say you were doing this for me? What does that matter?<eos> I'm selfish, a fake.<eos> You made that very clear.<eos> And that's why you slept with Carlos?<eos> At least now it's clear what you're up to.<eos> You came for money, and you're staying for it.<eos> But now you're not taking it from a safe.<eos> Why bother when you can live off the Cifuenteses?
-No, it's not about that. -You're going to ask for something else?<eos> The supervisor who was in charge of the phone tapping for His Majesty has been arrested.<eos> There was a raid on the Lyceum, -so if you could make a call-- -[laughing]<eos> You ask, you ask... and what will you give us in return?<eos> Your phone tapping is worthless.<eos> We don't even know anything about the coup that's being planned.<eos> If we haven't given you information, it's because we don't have it. -If we did--<eos> -His Majesty is fed up.<eos> He wants answers and, without them, there are no more favors.<eos> Does that mean you don't mind if I reveal your little indiscretion?
And there's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do.<eos> [officer] Who's Sara Millán?<eos> Your boyfriend has come to see you.<eos> How are you, darling?<eos> I've had better days.<eos> You're the last person I would have expected.<eos> Carlota is worried about you, and I'm worried about Carlota.<eos> -Did she ask you to visit me? -No, and she didn't force me to do it.<eos> Sara, it doesn't matter what's happened between us.<eos> What's happened to you isn't fair.

Maybe you know someone or know something that can help you.<eos> Sara... really think about it. Is there anything that could help you? I'm just an operator.<eos> What could I know?<eos> Operator, connect me to 486.<eos> Indalecio, come to my house tonight when you leave the office.<eos> Yes, it's urgent, and yes, it's important.<eos> I want to change my will.<eos> Don Ricardo, you have a visitor, sir. You may go, Ubalda.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> -How dare you come to my house?
Are you going to get sentimental?<eos> Because my day has been-- [bell ringing]<eos> -Thank you. [chuckles] [whispers] Marga.<eos> -What are you doing here? -Nothing.<eos> [chuckles] Well, actually, I was... remembering our kiss. This was our place.<eos> It was, yes.<eos> Past tense.<eos> What did you hear?<eos> Everything. Everything.<eos> If you're talking about Ángeles' plan, I think it's madness. Leaving her husband, moving.
I should have left Marisol long ago and told the truth, but I couldn't do it, because I'm a coward and...<eos> And a rambler. I don't know...<eos> [Emilio] I'll call the police station.<eos> Before you do that, I want to ask for two things.<eos> I don't want the reasons for Sara's release to be known, and I'd like to be able to say goodbye tonight. Very well.<eos> Operator, get me the police station on Calle Luna, please. Yes, I'll hold.<eos> From the loyal wings of the Eagle Squadron for our colonel, Don Emilio, the Falcon<eos> -Good evening. -Hello.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> That's because you've never come here.
Of course, handsome.<eos> I've got all the girls you could want, if you can pay for them.<eos> Well, I've been looking for ages for someone called Alba Romero.<eos> I was told she's been seen in this house.<eos> I've never heard that name.<eos> I'm sorry, young man.<eos> Thank you for Ángeles' papers. I'll pay you back soon.<eos> There's no hurry, love.<eos> Don't worry about that now.<eos> Just be happy that you could save Ángeles.
Where were you? With Papa.<eos> [Alba] Family is always there for you if they really love you. [Francisco] Lidia!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> There's nothing left to say. Go away.<eos> Lidia, forgive me. I was an idiot.<eos> I'm sorry for all I said.<eos> Victoria told me everything...<eos> The photos, Beltrán, the plan to steal the rotary. [sighs]<eos> You were doing it for me, to protect me.<eos> I knew I'd never lost you.

[sighs]<eos> You were doing it for me, to protect me.<eos> I knew I'd never lost you.<eos> It's true, at first, I did it to save you, but... now things have changed.
Don't you know what couples do at the movies?<eos> Everything but watch the film.<eos> Pablo and I have had our share of kisses, and when I'm with him, I feel warm inside... [chuckles]<eos> It'd be so much easier if someone gave me some advice... like if a friend could tell me about her experiences. Marga, we're very different.<eos> I don't think my advice would do you much good.<eos> Carlota always gave me advice about everything.<eos> -I didn't always listen, but... -I'm not Carlota.<eos> God, how I miss her!<eos> Hold on.<eos> I told you I never wanted to see you again.
In another time, I would've told you to take advantage of the situation.<eos> With a ring on your finger, you won't need to steal anything.<eos> Not everyone does things out of self-interest.<eos> I was only thinking of what's best for you.<eos> My mistake was thinking I didn't deserve a better life than this.<eos> But now I have friends and people who love me. -Who knows?<eos> Maybe this is a second chance.<eos> -Mm.<eos> You're walking on a spiderweb, princess.<eos> Be careful you don't get caught in it.
-Miguel just wanted to see me.<eos> I know.<eos> If it were up to me, there'd be no problem.<eos> I'll tell you when things settle down, hmm?<eos> We knew this could happen. Why are you here?<eos> I told you to respect my decision.<eos> What deal was your father talking about?<eos> He got me out of jail in exchange for you coming home, right?<eos> -You didn't have to do that. -I couldn't let you stay locked up.<eos> Don't you understand?
You know that honesty is not my forte.<eos> But when you have been honest, things have gone well for you.<eos> I forgave you when you were honest with me.<eos> Say it to his face. Be brave.<eos> [scoffs] Look at me.<eos> I wanted to do everything behind Mario's back, and... [sighs] what was the result?<eos> Tell him everything, Lidia.<eos> It will make the photos meaningless and save your relationship with Carlos.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> [Asunción] What did you forget, son?
[Carmen] Thank you for your punctuality, Indalecio, and for seeing the notary into the office. -[Indalecio] It's easy to get lost here.<eos> -[Elisa] I'll tell my husband.<eos> -Honey.<eos> -Yes?<eos> The notary and Indalecio are here.<eos> Forgive the delay.<eos> [exhales heavily] [notary] Sit down, please.<eos> We're starting straightaway.<eos> You're very nervous.<eos> Do you think our father left you with nothing?
Look, I need you to do a cost-profit analysis for the installation of the Rotary 7 in Madrid.<eos> All the information is in the folder.<eos> And I don't need to tell you that this is strictly confidential. Yes, don't worry.<eos> Get the engineers in section five to stop what they're doing and help Miguel Pascual with the project he was on.<eos> It's been destroyed, but I want it restored at once. Thanks.<eos> They'll hear us.<eos> -Last time--<eos> It's not what you think, Marga.<eos> -I don't want them to hear us. -What's going on?<eos> Marga, what I... [coughs] What I have to tell you is highly confidential.
Yeah, she hates it when she drops that.<eos> He's actually a little boy, but thank you very much.<eos> Did she just think I was a girl?<eos> Why would she think that?<eos> I don't know, maybe she saw you try to throw that feather in the yard yesterday.<eos> Hey, don't watch me when I'm doing stuff.<eos> What are you doing, kid?<eos> Those aren't free!<eos> Oopsie-poopsie!<eos> Aw, God bless you.

It has nothing to do with that, Brian.<eos> I just thought it'd be good to take up a sport.<eos> You know, like boys do.<eos> You don't have to play football to prove you're a boy.<eos> Barney Frank.<eos> Is yet another one.<eos> Chris, please.<eos> Actually, you know what? Ricky Martin.<eos> There's a bunch of these.<eos> Anyway, they're not gonna let you play football, Stewie.
Chris, please.<eos> Actually, you know what? Ricky Martin.<eos> There's a bunch of these.<eos> Anyway, they're not gonna let you play football, Stewie.<eos> You're too little.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna be bad news for the other team.<eos> And nobody likes bad news.<eos> Except for Larry, the Self-Loathing Idiot.<eos> Larry, I'm afraid you only have three months to live.
Well, maybe I accidentally reveal that you're not the hero everyone thinks you are and that you've been letting your neighbor do all kinds of cop stuff.<eos> You wouldn't do that, would you?<eos> You bet I would.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> Peter asked me to do this.<eos> He, he said it's something from before.<eos> I, I don't know, I...<eos> I hope it's funny.<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> But why did you want me to bring this?
Peter asked me to do this.<eos> He, he said it's something from before.<eos> I, I don't know, I...<eos> I hope it's funny.<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> But why did you want me to bring this?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> You're getting all the credit for my police work, so I want stuff from you.<eos> I want a minute in your house with this shopping cart, like Supermarket Sweep. Here, time me.<eos> Peter, you expect me to let you ransack my house?
Accidentally, I fell in love with him.<eos> And then he split up with me...<eos> I know, with me... simply because I'm not Jewish.<eos> What?<eos> I genuinely did not know that religions still behaved that way.<eos> What?<eos> I'm a blond-haired, blue-eyed, white, middle-class woman in 2016.<eos> I am entitled to everything.<eos> It is not okay for his people to treat me the way my people quite enjoy treating everyone else.<eos> He said, "My parents don't approve of you, Katherine."
She'd written it on stationary, beautiful calligraphy.<eos> It's a dead art, kids.<eos> Get involved.<eos> And she wrote, "Dear Katherine, we saw your show, and we were very worried to hear that you're single."<eos> I was, like, "What?<eos> You say my show?<eos> Like, my whole...<eos> The bit about Cosby and the Jews and the whole Filipino thing.<eos> That was all fine with you.<eos> What made you want to write a letter is that I don't have a boyfriend?"
It's a nightmare.<eos> It's like a Disney film, but with shitting.<eos> That's my life.<eos> This is my life.<eos> All I wanted was my bed, and one of the dogs had shat on my pillow... which is never an accident.<eos> And it nearly broke me.<eos> I was, like, whimpering. Like...<eos> And Violet came into the room. She saw what happened and said,<eos> "Oh, don't worry, Mummy.<eos> That's just their way of saying they hate you."
That's your fault.<eos> I thought she was just mocking you, and I laughed.<eos> But it is permanent.<eos> You have to introduce the news that you have a child at a very precarious time when you're dating.<eos> Not too soon, certainly not too late.<eos> You've got to do it about the same time you would announce that you have a prosthetic leg.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I think there are two kinds of people:<eos> People who are, like, "No!"<eos> And people who are, like, "I will be that hero to help you."
Savage.<eos> Oh, Thor!<eos> Slippery one, aren't you?<eos> Wait, Savage, you don't want to do this.<eos> For once in my life, I know exactly what I want to do.<eos> Thanks for getting him off Berk, muttonheads.<eos> Hold me, Amos.<eos> [Fishlegs] Since Viggo's island is north, the bounty hunters should be heading in this direction.<eos> We'll find him, boy.<eos> Don't you worry.
And absorbent.<eos> See what I did there?<eos> Yes. Let's sit down and negotiate a deal for the surrender of one Ruffnut and one Tuffnut Thorston.<eos> We'll have our people Terror Mail your people.<eos> [laughs] That'll hold you.<eos> Savage, think about what you're doing.<eos> I'm the only one standing between Viggo and his rule.<eos> Once you hand me over--<eos> I've been disrespected my whole life, but now, I'll be a Viking of legend.<eos> Viggo will never respect you.
Someone who loves weddings, someone like a maid of honor. Okay, I get the incredibly unsubtle hint. But we're not having a wedding party.<eos> We're keeping it simple. No maid of honor? No best man?<eos> The best man tradition is based on the morally questionable tradition of 16th century Goths picking the man "best" at stealing the bride from the neighboring village the night before the wedding.<eos> That's a good point, Sly!<eos> Plus, I got three amigos.<eos> Couldn't bear breaking the heart of two of them.<eos> I can see where having to select one of us could disrupt the team dynamic.<eos> Plus, I can't have Cabe or Sly upset at being shunned.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What makes you think it'd be you?
I suggest you don't insult your guests.<eos> Public speaking has a formula, Toby.<eos> You have to combine the concise verbiage of Kennedy speechwriter Arthur Schlesinger with the witty wordplay of tunesmith W.A. Yankovic.<eos> Who's Rickles?<eos> You morons are arguing over a best man position that won't be filled.<eos> No wedding party, remember?<eos> I don't care that there's no best man.<eos> I just want to know that if there had been, it wouldn't have been Sly or Cabe.<eos> And I was just saying you were making progress.<eos> While the rest of the team finishes in the control room, I'd like to present you with this,
Okay, all set here.<eos> You two head down, I will help Toby pack up.<eos> 'Cause that is what a good man would do.<eos> Some would say, "best man."<eos> Just start packing the manuals.<eos> We'll need to track the gears' heat coefficients once the turbine is turned on.<eos> I will call out the readings, you can jot them down?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's funny how you trust me to monitor multimillion-dollar equipment, but not with choosing a wedding dress.<eos> Why do you care that I don't want a maid of honor?
Or something like that. I don't know.<eos> I'm a genius. I am new to this feeling stuff.<eos> Like it or not, you have a funny way of growing on people, old man.<eos> Sly got close to you during the campaign, and now that it's over, he's scared.<eos> It's the same way I felt when you moved out of my apartment.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You're like a raccoon digging through someone's garbage.<eos> You wonder how the hell it got into your life, but once it's gone, you kind of miss it.<eos> Oh. Your Department of Energy friend has got you doing paperwork, too?
We're about to find out on Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Welcome to Ultimate Beastmaster!<eos> I'm Terry Crews.<eos> And I'm Charissa Thompson.<eos> And we are fired up because we are about to watch 12 more competitors summon up all the courage they can muster as they enter the jaws of the Beast.<eos> And they are gonna get up close and personal with some of the most terrifying obstacles they've ever seen, all with the hope of being the one competitor that makes it to the end.<eos> Here's our two American competitors, ready to take on those obstacles.<eos> First, starting in the east and ready to represent the women, is CrossFit queen Lindsay Andrew from Charlotte, North Carolina.<eos> Her unique training regimen gives her impressive agility that should set her up for success.<eos> CrossFit prepares you for the unknown and unknowable.
I'm not gonna give up.<eos> He zoomed through the first two obstacles and went for the Point Thruster in style.<eos> He's got the Point Thruster!<eos> But he had an awkward dismount off the spinning gear.<eos> Oh, he's off!<eos> No, no, no! No!<eos> He landed right on the edge and right over it.<eos> That's where the centrifugal force is!<eos> Okay, Terry has this thing called centrifugal force, which I know is an actual thing, but every time I ask him for the definition, he skirts by that.<eos> That's because I'm too smart. I'm too smart to tell you.
Now, Taeyoon Kim just took first place, and that run eliminated Japan's Kaita Omura.<eos> South Korea's Woosung Yu is now on the bubble.<eos> And here's the guy looking to knock him out, Brazil's Bruno Nogueira.<eos> All right, back here at the Beast, and all Bruno's gotta do is clear Spinal Descent in order to eliminate South Korea's Woosung Yu.<eos> And he does it!<eos> Woosung Yu is out!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> You've gotta get to that center.<eos> The more you hang on that outside... the more you risk getting thrown off.<eos> I think Bruno just heard you, Terry, because he seems to be following your advice.
Now, remember, though, these points are cumulative, so it's important for him to get across this Mag Wall.<eos> Let's see if this time he's got it.<eos> Oh, man. Those handles are falling in the blood.<eos> No!<eos> And he falls into the blood!<eos> Oh, it's all right.<eos> He knows he's moving on to Level 2 of the finals.<eos> The German is out! We have to pack our bags.<eos> Yes, our presenter job here is over.<eos> Whoo! I love you!

The Black Fairy.<eos> Gold didn't banish her.<eos> And now she's casting a curse that's going to separate me from everyone, so that I have to fight the Final Battle alone.<eos> Not on our wedding day, she won't. Let's go.<eos> Killian, this is one I need to win on my own.<eos> Isn't that what she wants?<eos> If you come with me, it just gives her a chance to hurt one more person I love.<eos> And I can't let her do that.<eos> You've obviously made up your mind, so why did you come here then?<eos> To tell you not to worry.

Are you okay?<eos> What was that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> If I'm gonna do this, I need to do this now.<eos> I don't have a lot of time before her curse hits.<eos> I can't find anything to stop the Black Fairy's curse.<eos> Think about it.<eos> You were the first person to cast her original dark curse.<eos> You know her magic better than anyone.<eos> There has to be something you learned back then that you can use against her this time.
I wonder what our sorry excuse of a teacher would say if he could see us now?<eos> [Gold] How about, "Thank you"?<eos> Now, this was made to freeze the curse.<eos> I wonder how well it's gonna work on people.<eos> So, have you finally come to your senses and decided to surrender?<eos> Hardly.<eos> Why wait for the curse to hit?<eos> Let's start the Final Battle now.<eos> Funny, I was thinking the same thing.<eos> I was planning to wait for my curse to separate you from your family, but they ended up doing my work for me.
Do you know what I hear?<eos> A little girl who's all alone in this world.<eos> A girl who's weak, without hope.<eos> I used to go to sleep to the sounds of misery like that every night in the mines.<eos> I'll show you misery.<eos> [whoosh, thud] [giggles]<eos> What did you do?<eos> I didn't do anything, just made you face the truth.<eos> You can't do this alone.<eos> [sighs] What did she do to you?
But she'll kill you.<eos> You brought me here to bring back the happy endings.<eos> Maybe this is the way I was supposed to do it.<eos> This isn't how the book's supposed to end.<eos> Because if I fight and I lose, then I know you won't have anyone.<eos> At least this way, I know you'll have the rest of our family.<eos> In here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Looking for me? Snow White.<eos> I haven't had a chance to congratulate you on that little bundle brewing inside.

"I'm buying this bag because I've got the money to buy this bag.<eos> And not only that.<eos> This bag is for me, and I want you to gift-wrap it."<eos> "That bag is for me, but I wanna surprise myself: 'What did I get me?<eos> '<eos> I want you to surprise...<eos> Gift-wrap it. Gift-wrap it."<eos> And I stood there. I'm like, "More ribbon."<eos> I pay, she gives me the card, blah, blah, blah.<eos> I'm like, "I'm doing this to teach you a lesson.
It takes a lot out of me, but I wanna say it, because, again, I'm trying to let people know what kind of mom my mom was, what kind of person she was.<eos> When I was 21...<eos> I moved to Los Angeles by myself.<eos> I didn't know anybody.<eos> And I lived in my car for a very long time.<eos> And my family didn't know that because I was the baby, and I didn't want them to worry.<eos> And at 21, my oldest brother calls me and tells me... that our mom is sick and I have to go home.<eos> Now, I'm 21 and... it's a hard thing to hear.<eos> So I go home to visit my mom, and when I get there, my brother tells me, "You know, we didn't wanna scare you.<eos> We brought you here so that you could say bye to her."
A good mother.<eos> That got me through.<eos> But now, Isaac is gone.<eos> I don't know how to look at you anymore.<eos> You're gonna have to try.<eos> Abe.<eos> Abe.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Of course, I am not without blame.<eos> If I had not left to help Jackson that summer, you would not have turned to Jonah.
It'll engage.<eos> That's not good.<eos> The current just exposed it.<eos> That's a bio-drive.<eos> It's a what?<eos> It's Shepherd technology.<eos> I put the guy who created it behind bars. Okay.<eos> Well, let's just get it out.<eos> Any tech that they created is dangerous.<eos> We need to know exactly what it does before we get it out of you.
Don't you think we've had enough reckless actions in this household to last ten lifetimes?<eos> - Abe...<eos> - Dariela...<eos> Stand down, stand down.<eos> Target acquired.<eos> Clear.<eos> Sorry for the intrusion, Mr. and Mrs. Kenyatta.<eos> I'm Leanne Ducovny.<eos> We should talk.<eos> Hey, there's something I need to tell you.
Taylor.<eos> Was getting worried.<eos> Who's this? This is my man, Switch.<eos> I wouldn't have made it off the streets without him.<eos> I-I trust him with my life.<eos> You may have to if you can't explain what happened.<eos> Things got out of hand, man. Cops was everywhere.<eos> Look, it had to be a setup.<eos> Agreed.<eos> What I'm wondering is how you got away.
Access, man.<eos> It's no mystery King has the winning hand.<eos> I just want to be a part of it.<eos> Look... I know you guys took a hit this morning with that deal.<eos> I can help.<eos> How are you gonna help King?<eos> Because...<eos> I come bearing gifts.<eos> He's alive!<eos> Switch not let you in on his little plan?
Quicker! Go!<eos> I got it, I got it.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Fill it up.<eos> You don't know what you're getting yourself into, bro.<eos> Get another bag, get another bag.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You don't know what you're getting yourself into, bro.<eos> Just fill the money up, man. Fill the bag up with money, man.<eos> You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
It's too dangerous.<eos> There may be another way.<eos> You must feel like Rip Van Winkle, waking up in a different world.<eos> Humanity sterilized.<eos> The West Coast fallen.<eos> Packs of monsters roaming the streets.<eos> But the IADG, they think that you can help.<eos> They think you know how to stop the hybrids.<eos> Do you remember anything about how you ended up in that tank?<eos> Who put you there or why?
But the IADG, they think that you can help.<eos> They think you know how to stop the hybrids.<eos> Do you remember anything about how you ended up in that tank?<eos> Who put you there or why?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Just might take some time.<eos> 79, 60.<eos> 79, 60?<eos> Seeing your face again, the only thing that I can remember is 79, 60.<eos> You don't remember.
Seeing your face again, the only thing that I can remember is 79, 60.<eos> You don't remember.<eos> The parking ticket I got the day you were born.<eos> $79.60.<eos> Money well spent.<eos> Almost missed your birth.<eos> And I missed half your childhood.<eos> And the past ten years.<eos> I swear, I am... I'm not missing another second, ever.<eos> It's good that you're remembering.
And I missed half your childhood.<eos> And the past ten years.<eos> I swear, I am... I'm not missing another second, ever.<eos> It's good that you're remembering.<eos> They need you to remember something, too.<eos> What do they want to know?<eos> They're looking for answers about some kind of program.<eos> Blue Diaspora.<eos> I don't know what it means, but whatever it is, it's really important.<eos> It's the reason they came for you.
But we need your help.<eos> We need you to remember.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I've tried.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Well, it looks like your gamma frequencies are still lagging behind.<eos> I got some meds that should be able to help with that.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Whatever he gives you, don't take it.
Like a Faraday cage.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> If this works.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> Isaac, come on.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, go, go, go.<eos> You're working with the Shepherds now?<eos> Teaming up with them was the only chance I had at getting you back.
If this works.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> Isaac, come on.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, go, go, go.<eos> You're working with the Shepherds now?<eos> Teaming up with them was the only chance I had at getting you back.<eos> I did what I had to.<eos> Why would they bring you along?
- You've seen her?<eos> - Just for a second.<eos> We tracked her and found her truck, but it was a dead end.<eos> She left this behind.<eos> Have you found anything else with this symbol on it?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna need to see where you found this.<eos> - If we leave right now... - There is no "we," Detective, okay?<eos> So if you don't mind, I have people back at camp that need my help.
- Abe!<eos> Abe!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy, are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm okay, Isaac.<eos> Keep your leg elevated.<eos> All right?<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> Someone's calling for you.
- the exact same.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> You and this Abigail Westbrook share multiple genetic markers.<eos> That's why I thought it was contaminated, but it wasn't.<eos> Jackson, Abigail Westbrook is your sister.<eos> You sure you know what you're doing?<eos> The bullet passed clean through.<eos> So I'll have to watch it for infection, but you're gonna be fine.<eos> Well, if you're looking for a second opinion, I can take a look.<eos> How you feeling?
So... how did you end up with the plane?<eos> Well, we saved the world on this thing,<eos> I thought I should keep it in the family.<eos> What happened?<eos> Last thing I remember is, uh, teeth and claws, ripping into me.<eos> Whoever saved my life, they...<eos> They didn't do it out of the kindness of their hearts.<eos> You were in Siberia.<eos> At the edge of the world.<eos> Whoever put you in that tank, they didn't want anybody to find you.
Is there any chance that Nurse Anna got a plate from the car they left in?<eos> Unfortunately not.<eos> Good timing.<eos> Hospital sent over the security footage.<eos> I was about to run facial rec on the uncle.<eos> Won't be surprised if he's in the system.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> The way she's sitting.<eos> I think she's afraid of him.<eos> I see Sara worked her magic spell on you, too?
You're a very busy man, clearly, so we'll get right to the point.<eos> We know it was your stash house that was hit in Kapolei this morning; We know this because you're the guy that's been paying the electricity bills on the place.<eos> By the way, Makoa, sober living house doubling as a stash house?<eos> Well done, my man.<eos> It's the perfect cover.<eos> Will you be making this point of yours anytime soon?<eos> We don't care that you stashed your inventory at Clear Path.<eos> At least, not for today.<eos> But what we do care about is catching whoever gunned down three innocent people in pursuit of that inventory.<eos> So, who ripped you off, Makoa?
Move.<eos> Hey, we're... we're the police.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey, it's all right. It's all right.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here, okay?<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm gonna take your gag off, okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> We came here to get you.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> If that's okay with you.<eos> I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.<eos> But... I need your help right now.<eos> And so does Moani.<eos> You know her, right?<eos> How do you feel about getting outside this room for a few minutes?
It's run by a group called Ho'ola Na Pua.<eos> So, is it possible to come back from something like this?<eos> Yes... but it won't be easy.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to check on her.<eos> I-It's okay.<eos> Would you like to come in?<eos> Hi, Moani.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, if it's all right with you, I was wondering if I could visit you next week.
- Previously on Stitchers...<eos> - I don't love you!
- What about?<eos> - Stuff.<eos> Stuff? Uh-huh.<eos> - Minute?<eos> - Barely.<eos> - Question.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Ivy.<eos> - No.<eos> Look, I know that you're feeling a connection with her and that she helped you find out about your father.
If you want, we can leave you there for a little while, come back later.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Memory hotspot comin' up.<eos> All right, you're on the move, Sally.<eos> I'm... on a street somewhere. It's...<eos> It's in New York, I think.<eos> It's... it's foggy.<eos> Sabine!<eos> Weather foggy or brain foggy?<eos> I told you, please don't worry about me.
But even something like this is worth a bucket of money to someone.<eos> I...<eos> It's just squares.<eos> Kirsten?<eos> What are you...<eos> Do you remember any of the unlock codes?<eos> Yeah. 1-2-3-5.<eos> Okay.<eos> Try the next one.<eos> Are you sure you're remembering these correctly?
I need a decontamination unit over to Broden's right now.<eos> I think I've been poisoned.<eos> Exploding coconut water.<eos> Apparently, Broden's cuckoo for coconut water.<eos> Now, the container that Fisher found himself on the nasty end of was injected with a bacterium called clostidridium botulinim, which is the toxin used to create, boop, botox, which ingested, can cause paralysis, asphyxiation, and sometimes death.<eos> L'chaim!<eos> To Fisher. And his ability to keep his mouth... shut.<eos> A skill I wish someone else was better at.<eos> Hm? What?<eos> Is this because I told you and Kirsten about the oxytocin thing?
Sorry for any trouble.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - Wanna see how we make our companions?<eos> I started all of this as a hobby.<eos> But Jules here... she is the real visionary.<eos> Turning my mad pastime into a business.<eos> Perfect team, huh?<eos> Takes hard work and open communication.<eos> A little jealous devotion helps too.<eos> Not when it gets you a night in jail.
Is this what it is to care about someone?<eos> That you're worried about them all the time?<eos> Because, Cameron, that just doesn't sound right to me.<eos> I have a history of watching people I care about get into bad situations or worse.<eos> Well... - Then maybe we shouldn't be together.<eos> - This isn't was this is about. If I'm causing you more pain than happiness, then I don't want anything to do with this.<eos> You are not the only one who gets to worry about how the other person is doing.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll work on not being such a helicopter boyfriend.<eos> That's the last time you go rogue.
Good, you were paying attention.<eos> But we gotta get past this.<eos> Whether you like it or not, Ivy is important to me.<eos> So, I'm sorry supporting her before didn't work out.<eos> It bit me in the ass.<eos> But that's not my fault.<eos> Or yours.<eos> Can't we please just move on?<eos> Look, I'm seeing Ivy today after work.<eos> Why don't you join us?
You heard me, sweetheart, I don't trust you.<eos> And that's fine, because I don't really trust a lot of people, but if you hurt Linus in any way...<eos> What makes you think I would hurt Linus?<eos> Oh, I don't know, let me think.<eos> Genetics?<eos> I'm warning you, Camille may act tough, but...<eos> Hold up.<eos> Did you just say, "I'm warning you"?<eos> Do you have any idea what I do for a living?<eos> I know nine different ways to kill you and make it look like natural causes.
Amanda, go.<eos> Hope you're hungry.<eos> We saved you some plates.<eos> I usually do this on dead people.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How do I compare?<eos> Umm... sexier than some.<eos> Thanks for saving my life.<eos> Man, when Chloe came at us with that knife, I dunno, something snapped inside me.<eos> I was just so afraid of losing you.
Previously on "Somewhere Between"...<eos> The killer called your show.<eos> He said he had Serena<eos> Then the next day in Black Pine Cove, they...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For one to live, one must die.<eos> Mommy's coming, angel.<eos> I came back to eight days before.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> Sometimes it's like you're asleep and something wakes you up.
We can curl up and see what the Mad Hatter's up to.<eos> You're staying home from work to read with me?<eos> Until I have to go out later on to work on my story.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> Hey, Ruby!<eos> - Move over.<eos> - Uncle Nico.<eos> Why'd you come to my school?<eos> I missed ya.<eos> What's got you down, sweetheart?
I came to tell you I'm sorry about your teacher.<eos> Someone can be a good person and a bad person all at the same time.<eos> They have to know that everybody in the world is waiting, so why don't they just put it up already?<eos> It's very, very, very, very frustrating.<eos> How's she gonna feel when her daddy's gone, too?<eos> You have to help him.<eos> Mom, I think it's gonna go better this time.<eos> Which time?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> III... I didn't want to tell you this, because I was afraid you'd get angry, but...
No, not you today, God.<eos> Other god.<eos> Right.<eos> He told me you would know who I was talking to.<eos> No, other god, please.<eos> That god on the...<eos> No, no.<eos> That god, you... '<eos> Then I wonder why my prayers are not getting answered."<eos> "How dare you speak to me like that?

'<eos> Then I wonder why my prayers are not getting answered."<eos> "How dare you speak to me like that?<eos> Do you know who I am?"<eos> "No, because you never introduced yourself."
That god on the...<eos> No, no.<eos> That god, you... '<eos> Then I wonder why my prayers are not getting answered."<eos> "How dare you speak to me like that?<eos> Do you know who I am?"<eos> "No, because you never introduced yourself."<eos> "I have come here representing Great Britain."<eos> "And I have never heard of Great Britain.<eos> Who gave you that name?"
"Well... well, we did."<eos> "You called yourselves 'great'?<eos> Isn't that a little presumptuous?<eos> Shouldn't you wait for other people to tell you how great you are?<eos> Shouldn't you just go around the world and just do good things, good things? Then people go, 'Oh, my God, Britain, look how great you are! '"<eos> "Well, I beg to differ.<eos> I believe we could do it because we knew instinctively, we are Great Britain!"<eos> "Well, in that case, welcome to Great India."<eos> "No, it doesn't work like that!<eos> How dare you speak to me like this!"
I believe we could do it because we knew instinctively, we are Great Britain!"<eos> "Well, in that case, welcome to Great India."<eos> "No, it doesn't work like that!<eos> How dare you speak to me like this!"<eos> "You're the one who dares to speak to me, okay?<eos> I was here, minding my own business in my land.<eos> You came over here, riding on your skinny cow, telling me that things are going to change.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> All I know is you are clearly crazy.<eos> You're not feeling too right.
"Wow, I never thought of it like that."<eos> "Slow down.<eos> Slow down."<eos> "Okay. I guess I do speak fast sometimes.<eos> - Like, I could..." - "Slower than that."<eos> "I could slow it down.<eos> I could slow it way down.<eos> Is this good?"<eos> "That's better.<eos> Now, you need to make sure... you add some bass to your voice."
Hey, you want to dance?"<eos> "No, I'm fine, thank you.<eos> I'm just getting a drink.<eos> I don't..."<eos> "Come on, dance with me, girl." "I'm fine.<eos> I don't wanna dance.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm waiting for my friends. I'm good."<eos> "Come on. ♪ I know you want me ♪<eos> ♪ You know I want you ♪ Come on!
Problem solved.<eos> Even the penis will be like, "You know what, you're right.<eos> I told him, but he wouldn't listen to me.<eos> I don't know how we got to this point.<eos> Because what happened was he called me.<eos> 'Come out, there's a party.' I came out.<eos> I was like, 'You're sleeping?<eos> ' He's like, 'I'll wake her up.'<eos> I was like, 'Don't wake her up.' You know me.<eos> I don't wake you.
I don't know how we got to this point.<eos> Because what happened was he called me.<eos> 'Come out, there's a party.' I came out.<eos> I was like, 'You're sleeping?<eos> ' He's like, 'I'll wake her up.'<eos> I was like, 'Don't wake her up.' You know me.<eos> I don't wake you.<eos> I'm here five times a night.<eos> I've never woken you.<eos> I don't know why he woke you up.
I've never woken you.<eos> I don't know why he woke you up.<eos> I'm gonna be chilling.<eos> I had some stuff to do.<eos> Go back to bed.<eos> Because I respect you.<eos> I have paperwork that I'm handling in my office.<eos> If you need me, you know where to find me.<eos> He shouldn't have done that.<eos> I want to apologize, 'cause I don't think you should be in a situation where a man is pressuring you."
Because a language is something someone else speaks.<eos> An accent is me interpreting how they're using mine.<eos> It's a completely different thing.<eos> I was walking through the streets.<eos> There was a man on the phone, Russian guy, speaking to someone in English.<eos> Sounded like he was setting up a drug deal.<eos> Then he switched into Russian. The strangest thing happened in my brain.<eos> And he was like, "Vlad. The guys got to be there at three o'clock.<eos> Tell me when you get the package.<eos> Afterwards, I got to let you know...
Modern cities are miracles Of design and engineering, They come with consequences.<eos> Energy consumption, Overcrowding, These problems plague The modern metropolis.<eos> Ancient designers built Shelters that complemented. Nature, not Battled against it. And now we are looking To the past to solve.<eos> From About ad 600 to ad 1300, The ancestral pueblo People lived here.<eos> It would have taken a lot Of social organization to. Build a village like this one.<eos> Over 150 different rooms, Probably that many People coming together.<eos> People were living in what Amounts to apartment buildings.<eos> All together, stacked one On top of one another.<eos> We're in a shelter that's A societal shelter.<eos> You would be buffered Against risks, So if your farm plot Didn't pan out for a year, You had neighbors who Could help you out.
Wasn't she on the run?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> I was able to pull satellite surveillance from the area surrounding the crime scene, and managed to track that suspicious trawler to a spot five miles south of Polihua Beach on Lanai.<eos> This place is supposed to be abandoned.<eos> Only, it shows activity.<eos> If Michelle Shioma is involved, she's back in business and running her drug operation right under our noses.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> All right, guys, I'm gonna put it down at, uh... four klicks from the location we saw on the satellite image.<eos> We'll hike the rest of the way.<eos> You know, no one can understand you when you say stupid things like "klicks."
You there?<eos> Roger that, Commander. Special Consultant Ortega, aka your eye in the sky is on the line.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Jungle canopy's pretty thick. You may lose us at some point.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> - Keep an eye on that trawler.<eos> If it moves, I want to know about it, all right?<eos> You got it.<eos> See that?<eos> What I tell you?
Now, if we had big luggage, we'd still be at the airport right now, waiting on it.<eos> And... not carrying any heavy bags means I don't have to go broke tipping people.<eos> So that's another helpful travel hint from your old man.<eos> Dad, can we get some room service?<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Room serv... What you want to order room service for?<eos> Room service is for tourists.<eos> Look.<eos> In a few minutes, we're gonna go down to Georgie's, have us some deep dish, then we gonna go over to Ferrara's, have a little cannoli...<eos> Look, Dad. Mom made me promise not to let you go crazy with the eats.
Let me tell you something, I made you.<eos> I'll make another one look just like you.<eos> Won't nobody even know you was missing.<eos> So, remember, what happens in Chicago stays in Chicago.<eos> So you want me to lie to Mom?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, if she doesn't ask you then there's no need to, uh, volunteer information.<eos> Okay, if she does ask me?<eos> Well, I mean, we gonna be here for a couple of days.<eos> You-you-- maybe you forgot.
Oh, yeah, that's your mother talking.<eos> I don't know, though.<eos> Maybe it's some good cop deductive reasoning.<eos> Perhaps you have the gene. Yeah.<eos> Well, take that gene and that tool and stick it back on your tool belt, 'cause you won't be needing it where you're going, which is the operating room.<eos> Dad, I'm gonna be a chef.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that'll pass.<eos> So, um what happened last night with those cops?<eos> Son, why are you such a young person and worry about every little thing like an old person?
I don't know, though.<eos> Maybe it's some good cop deductive reasoning.<eos> Perhaps you have the gene.

Your Uncle Clay sent some people to kill us, too, you remember that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Son, I've make plenty of mistakes.<eos> And I'm not ashamed of 'em, I don't deny 'em. Made a lot of mistakes.<eos> I'm just like anybody else.<eos> However... putting Clay Maxwell where he is now was not one of 'em.<eos> Okay?<eos> Son, let me explain something to you.<eos> The time is coming in your life where you're gonna have to make a lot of important decisions.<eos> Decisions that are gonna make you unpopular sometimes, decisions that are gonna make people not like you.
Yeah.<eos> Son, I've make plenty of mistakes.<eos> And I'm not ashamed of 'em, I don't deny 'em. Made a lot of mistakes.<eos> I'm just like anybody else.<eos> However... putting Clay Maxwell where he is now was not one of 'em.<eos> Okay?<eos> Son, let me explain something to you.<eos> The time is coming in your life where you're gonna have to make a lot of important decisions.<eos> Decisions that are gonna make you unpopular sometimes, decisions that are gonna make people not like you.<eos> Decisions that are not gonna make you feel good.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> ♪ The colors change... ♪ Okay, I'll admit. This...<eos> This isn't the type of job I ever thought I'd have. But I actually really like it.<eos> You know?<eos> I'm working outside.<eos> Pay's decent.<eos> And at the end of the day, I get to come home to my beautiful "Smokeshow" of a wife.<eos> Excuse me, what now?<eos> "Smokeshow."<eos> That's what the guys on the crew call you.
We'll be seeing you around, Commander.<eos> Yeah, you will.<eos> Okay, based on what I found out, the property was originally developed in the early '90s.<eos> Now, in order to secure permits, the original builder had to conduct an exhaustive geological survey, which had to be signed off by the Department of Historic Preservation.<eos> They confirmed that the property had never been the site of a heiau or burial ground.<eos> Well, hold on. If... If the survey was conducted in the early '90s...<eos> Which isn't a big deal if it belonged to an animal.<eos> But it's a major deal if it was human.<eos> Exactly.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I looked into the previous owners, and none of them come across as the murdering type.
Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, let's call the DPP, have them suspend the building permit.<eos> I want everyone cleared out of here and let's tape off the scene.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> You're shutting us down?<eos> Yeah, you're lucky that's all I'm doing.<eos> I could charge you with obstruction of justice.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Adam, why didn't you tell me?<eos> I don't know, I... I guess I just didn't want to let you down.
Endorphins are flowing, I feel great.<eos> Want to give it a go?<eos> No, I've decided to cut back on my bean bag training.<eos> Telling you, dynamic movement incorporating strength conditioning and cardio, all in one?<eos> Cut your workout time in half.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Flexibility and mobility, that's the strength and cardio of 2017.<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> What do you mean where did I hear that?<eos> What makes you think I didn't come up with that original thought?
Is it a woman or a man?<eos> Well, it depends on the woman.<eos> Depends on the man.<eos> Agreed.<eos> If it's G, less than 500 a day.<eos> If it's Deeks, over a million. Okay.<eos> Actually, there was a book in 2006 called The Female Brain, written by a woman, that stated that a man speaks 7,000 words in a day, where a woman speaks over 20,000.<eos> That's almost three times as many.<eos> And we care about this because...? You don't.<eos> You absolutely don't. Because it is a stupid, sexist stereotype that needs to be debunked.
Yeah, okay.<eos> We're good.<eos> Go.<eos> All clear.<eos> He's got one guy for protection.<eos> With some serious firepower.<eos> It looks like Rebecca's portfolio.<eos> They say art's a good investment.<eos> Hey.<eos> Zanya told me she saw you in the storeroom.
Eric, send me Langston's address.<eos> Me and G'll go check it out.<eos> Maybe he'll talk to another Navy man.<eos> Or a merry man.<eos> You do bear a striking resemblance to Little John.<eos> Oh, thank you, Friar Tuck.<eos> Excuse me, Maid Marian.<eos> May I? Yes, of course.<eos> I wouldn't take it personally.<eos> I mean, I always fancied you more of an, I don't know, Alan-a-Dale, the wandering minstrel.
It wasn't money, Mr. Hanna.<eos> It was gold.<eos> $1 million worth when we came home in 1978.<eos> Today, those gold bars are worth a cool $40 million.<eos> Minus the one I sold to Yaniv.<eos> Mm, and I'm assuming he has it all now.<eos> Once we were stateside, I was in charge of it.<eos> Kept it here in this electronic safe.<eos> Okay, so... how did Yaniv know where it was?<eos> His goons didn't beat it out of you, right?
You want me to come with you? No, I don't want to wrap you up in this again.<eos> I think I'm just gonna do it alone.<eos> You're never alone, Deeks.<eos> But also, please make sure you come back this time, because I would hate to have to break you out of jail and live the rest of our lives on the lam.<eos> Is it crazy if I say that sounds pretty awesome right now?<eos> Just you and I, open road.<eos> Eating street tacos.<eos> Lots of ice cream, robbing banks.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too.
Great work in there.<eos> Very believable. There's not a chance in hell you two are going back in there.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> You said we could take a crack at him.<eos> Said take a crack at him, not crack his head open.<eos> Clearly your way wasn't working.<eos> Yeah, just wasted an hour blabbing away.<eos> Our way doesn't violate his civil rights.<eos> When did the Navy turn into a bunch of flower children?<eos> I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear you say that.
This is a live feed from their phones.<eos> That's Asher.<eos> Send us the address, we're on the move.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just kept thinking about my son. My husband.<eos> I came so close to losing everything.<eos> I've actually had the... "lying in your own pool of blood" moment, so I get it.<eos> I also nearly caused you to lose Kensi.<eos> No, no, you didn't, that psycho Ferris did.<eos> I mean, obviously, it'd have been nice if you would've come around sooner, but that stubbornness is what makes you a good cop, so....
But I need to know if I can trust you when the time comes.<eos> And before you answer, you should probably keep in mind your confession to killing Boyle.<eos> And there it is.<eos> While I don't agree with what you did, I do think you did it for the right reasons.<eos> I'm willing to close the investigation.<eos> If you help me.<eos> I mean, I don't have much of a choice, then, do I?<eos> Depends on how much you like being on the wrong side of I.A.<eos> You know, you could've led with that, right?<eos> And miss watching you sweat it out?
I'm sorry.<eos> We'd like to ask you a couple questions, but if you need some time...<eos> Nah, go ahead.<eos> You guys were SEAL teammates, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Seven years.<eos> He works just a few blocks from here.<eos> Has anyone notified his wife?<eos> It's in process.<eos> Why don't you take a minute.
I'll go you one better.<eos> They knew Tom was your teammate, he was a close friend.<eos> That specifically, it would draw you out.<eos> Since the mole, my family's been in a secure location.<eos> Now, on the day Michelle comes out of hiding to speak to Zhrov, this happens?<eos> It would guarantee you wouldn't be home.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hopefully nothing.<eos> It's been less than an hour and I already miss you.<eos> I may be a little paranoid, but I think when you spoke to Zhrov, you may have been compromised.
This is about me.<eos> It's the mole?<eos> Did we miss somebody?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But this all starts with Zhrov.<eos> He's the one that exposed Michelle.<eos> Oh, so now you only talk to us when they have guards in the room?<eos> What's up with that?<eos> What do you need?<eos> Who paid you to contact NCIS?
He's the one that exposed Michelle.<eos> Oh, so now you only talk to us when they have guards in the room?<eos> What's up with that?<eos> What do you need?<eos> Who paid you to contact NCIS?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Did everything I tell you check out?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> My wife was kidnapped.<eos> Who told you to ask for her?
Nobody.<eos> Did everything I tell you check out?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> My wife was kidnapped.<eos> Who told you to ask for her?<eos> I ask for her 'cause I knew her.<eos> I spent months with her when she was undercover.<eos> She questioned me when I was arrested.<eos> We're gonna ask you this one more time.<eos> Who paid you to bring CIA Agent Michelle Hanna to this prison?
I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Maybe you didn't know where this was headed when you signed up.<eos> You give us a name now, it's gonna make a huge difference how this plays out for you.<eos> If something happens to my wife, you're gonna be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life!<eos> Get me out.<eos> You feel that?<eos> That's your larynx getting crushed.<eos> I crack it, it's 50-50 they get a trach tube in you in time.

He's been working with a bunch of Middle Eastern and North African criminal organizations.<eos> Only reason why feds haven't shut him down is because he's providing them with a wealth of information on the financial structure of those groups.<eos> He just doesn't know it.<eos> Well, Tahir's obviously getting help.<eos> Somebody's got to be bankrolling him.<eos> Yeah, it could be Aimon Shah.<eos> And even if he isn't helping Tahir, he probably knows who is.<eos> This is all because of his sister?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, what I think is, this guy Tahir truly hates you.
I cannot wait for this day to be over.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You find anything?<eos> Uh, no eyewitnesses.<eos> Shooter took all their brass, wiped everything down.<eos> Trying to get surveillance footage from the building to Eric, maybe we'll get lucky.<eos> Think they're watching us?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How you feeling?

Okay, well, if I move in, you can't use mine.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Hey, Howard, uh, how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why are you asking all these questions?<eos> Well, to be honest, Leonard's on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom.<eos> Great!<eos> Go live there.<eos> But you made the garage sound so fun.<eos> I just didn't want you to feel bad about it.
That is the word on the street, dear.<eos> Maybe moving in was a bad idea.<eos> I haven't been here one day, I'm already causing problems.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> It's Sheldon.<eos> "You didn't do anything.<eos> It's Sheldon."<eos> That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.<eos> So, relax.<eos> We're happy to have you.
Me, either.<eos> I'm in a bedroom and you're on a couch.<eos> I'm actually winning.<eos> You know, we're both down on our luck.<eos> Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> There is no reason to leave here.<eos> This is great. Everyone's nice. It's comfortable.<eos> If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.<eos> Wouldn't you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
Better than I feel in their steam shower?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Penny would be the entree.<eos> Then Leonard's basically a cheese course.<eos> And because I love you, you're dessert.<eos> I want to say "aw," but I'm gonna say "ew."<eos> No, you see, I'm doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.<eos> Good for you.<eos> This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.<eos> Don't you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
Well, that would make me feel better.<eos> All right, let's start right now.<eos> Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.<eos> That's a ridiculous rule.<eos> Is it?<eos> Okay, how is that?<eos> I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.<eos> Well, this is a moisturizing mask.<eos> Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.<eos> Hey, I hope you don't mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.
You know, I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn't say anything 'cause you're so sensitive.<eos> Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I'm sensitive!<eos> Hey, I wonder what kind of success we'd have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.<eos> That is a daring and insightful solution.<eos> We're finally making progress.<eos> I wish we could do it without fighting.<eos> What if the fighting is the reason we're making progress?<eos> I suppose it's conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.<eos> Well, if that's the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.<eos> How dare you speak that way about my Grammy-- hey, wait a second.
That's great, good for you.<eos> Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she's gonna be fine.<eos> Ah, of course she is.<eos> And that day care is great.<eos> It is.<eos> I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.<eos> Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers.<eos> Sure, she won't know where i went or if I'm ever coming back.<eos> That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home (voice breaking):<eos> Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don't know what to do right now.
Can you not tell Howard?<eos> Well, don't you think it'd be healthier if you told him what's going on with you?<eos> Don't you think it'd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?<eos> Your secret is safe with me.<eos> Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?<eos> Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.<eos> You know, there was a time i would say "what's a soup sack?"<eos> But... I'm glad we're past that.<eos> (Sneezes)<eos> You know, there was a time i would say "god bless you,"
Sheldon, are you okay?<eos> What's going on?<eos> How'd I get here?<eos> I don't know, we came home from work and we found you.<eos> Home from work?<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's 9:00.<eos> 9:00?<eos> ! W-what happened to 8:00 and 7:00 and all the other o'clocks?<eos> Wait, you don't remember?
I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.<eos> Well, it's not across the hall.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm in breach of my security clearance.<eos> I'm going to prison.<eos> And you know what happens to people like me in prison.<eos> I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor.<eos> You're not going to prison.<eos> But, boy, it is funny to think about.<eos> You really can't remember anything?
That's just where we have dinner.<eos> Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.<eos> So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start.<eos> H-Howard.<eos> Flashback sounds.<eos> Could have played that on my harp.<eos> Just roll the clip.<eos> So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.<eos> I honestly don't remember.<eos> Sure you do.
I'm going back to work after only four months, so I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.<eos> Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.<eos> It's not just the sloth.<eos> Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months.<eos> The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night.<eos> And what do I do?<eos> I choose my career over my child!<eos> Told you we should have gone to Legoland.<eos> Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don't.<eos> I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.
Is that it?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> The end.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I haven't had much success meeting people online.<eos> I didn't either, until I revamped my profile.<eos> What'd you do, delete your photo?<eos> Go.<eos> Fine.<eos> And don't you slam that door.
How's she doing?<eos> She's great. Look.<eos> I see a wall... floor... some Asian baby...<eos> There she is.<eos> See? Nothing to worry about.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna try and get some work done.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you, too. Bye.
Unless it's Raj, in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.<eos> You guys are nice, but I'm just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.<eos> I feel bad for Bert.<eos> So he's using his money to attract a mate.<eos> Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy?<eos> Or Leonard using his power of groveling to get Penny?<eos> It's totally different.<eos> Bert's money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.<eos> All that and he's shorter than me.<eos> Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?
Okay, challenge them again.<eos> Doing it right now.<eos> Oh, they can't.<eos> There's an important Little League game tomorrow.<eos> No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.<eos> What happened to me?<eos> I used to excel at these things.<eos> Kids are always better at video games.<eos> Well, I don't like it.<eos> Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.
I'm pretty sure that's a myth, let me check.<eos> Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass over your head.<eos> To denial.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna get another.<eos> You want food?<eos> Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day.<eos> Do not touch that phone.<eos> Penny?<eos> Oh, Zack. Hey.<eos> What are the odds of running into you here?
Are you calling me a quitter?<eos> Well, if you honestly...<eos> This conversation is over.<eos> His mother warned me.<eos> Everybody warned me.<eos> Actually, he warned me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi. You want to talk?<eos> That doesn't seem to be where I shine.<eos> How about I just give you one of these?
This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.<eos> So?<eos> So I'm running out of time.<eos> That's ridiculous, you're a brilliant man.<eos> The best years of your life are still ahead of you.<eos> Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.<eos> Well, if you're really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.<eos> Hey! I thought you were sweet on me.<eos> Okay, fine, let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.<eos> Let's say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you've accomplished but for who you are as a man.
All right, very funny.<eos> Don't listen to her, she's been in a box for, like, 25 years.<eos> Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.<eos> That's enough, put her away.<eos> Oh, big daddy, I don't think so.<eos> You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me.<eos> We all family now.<eos> All right, you're freaking me out.<eos> Don't be that way.<eos> If you don't mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois.
Name?<eos> Quinoa.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Sorry, sir, we're full.<eos> Come on in, gummy bears!<eos> Oh, you are looking fine tonight.<eos> Mm!<eos> Thanks again for coming and supporting me, chris.<eos> No problem.<eos> And I'm gonna take some pictures. Of the other athletes, if you don't mind.
Well, we need five for a team. And there's five of you here, So congratulations.<eos> Wow!<eos> This is awesome!<eos> I can't believe I'm a quahog thug!<eos> When do we start skating?<eos> Here, look at the schedule.<eos> This is just a list of sexaholic anonymous meetings.<eos> Flip it over.<eos> It says, "remember to attend your meetings."<eos> I'm gonna stop handing you stuff.
It's time for a healthy, veggie dinner!<eos> Come on, I spent the whole day. Making the house smell like farts.<eos> Where the hell is everybody?<eos> All right, I got a bowl of cereal. That's mm's and dr. Pepper?<eos> Over here.<eos> Chris, put that down.<eos> You kids get in the house. And eat the healthy dinner I prepared,<eos> And peter, you, too.<eos> Shut down that truck and get inside.<eos> Lois, I already told you.
What are you talking about?<eos> I knew this would happen.<eos> You're too fat to get out.<eos> I see it.<eos> I see the bing car.<eos> Oh, my god, bing!<eos> Bing!<eos> Over here!<eos> Bing!<eos> They can't see you, peter.
No, look, I-i'm just saying, you were right.<eos> I'm a big tub of lard, And you have every reason to be ashamed of me.<eos> Ashamed of you?<eos> I-is that really what you think?<eos> Well, yeah, you kept saying how overweight I am.<eos> Peter, don't you get it?<eos> I only wanted you to eat healthy because I love you, And I'm concerned about your health.<eos> I want you around for as long as I'm around.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I love you, too, lois.
I'll take two churros too.<eos> Shut up, all right?<eos> I do the ordering, okay?<eos> This is the only thing I'm good at.<eos> Don't take this away from me like you take away everything else.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Guys, let's not fight, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what the hell I'm talking about.<eos> You think humans are stupid.<eos> Well, just 'cause you have green skin and multiple brains doesn't make you better than me, okay?
- Do it again.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's enough!<eos> [sobbing]<eos> Sir, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm having trouble understanding you.<eos> Did you say you wanted three burritos?<eos> - No, we want two churros.<eos> - Oh, I'll [bleep] kill you.
- Boop!<eos> Boop!<eos> Boop!<eos> They think it might be shingles and...<eos> - Clear!<eos> - Huh?<eos> Nurse, get me another scalpel!<eos> I'm not losing another child.<eos> Oh, we don't have a scalpel.<eos> Okay, so I'll see you soon, sir.
- [hard rock music] - [grunting]<eos> Yeah! Whoo!<eos> Whoa, I've never seen it this busy in here.<eos> - This is crazy.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So it looks like you have $137 in late fees.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, that's not an issue.<eos> Are you new here?<eos> You just delete those.<eos> Look, I can show you.
- Oh, hell yeah.<eos> I'd eat some nachos right now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Everyone's me.<eos> What's up, ya animals?<eos> - all:<eos> Hey!<eos> - Sammy!<eos> - Have a drink on the house.<eos> - Let me tell you something.
But, I mean, th-those are my stories...<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Ah, Zerk!<eos> Oh, hey, Zerk.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, let me feel those muscles.<eos> You've been working out, huh?<eos> Look at you!<eos> - Aw, man, I...<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> Didn't... didn't see you there, boss.
Something he'd been told to forget.<eos> But he's away from it now.<eos> He's been conditioned, Jim.<eos> The effects are long-lasting.<eos> I could synthesize a theragen derivative to help him overcome it but I'll need to know more about this device.<eos> Aye.<eos> It's almost as if Tiberius is trying to protect the old man.<eos> Jim, are you listening to yourself?<eos> "Old man." "My patient." "Our guest." What happened to "captain" or "Jim"?<eos> How would you feel, Bones?
"All the way!"<eos> You don't realize how rich your life is until all the comfort, structure, family, friends are ripped away.<eos> It's like being thrown into prison.<eos> You know you'll never see your shipmates again.<eos> Never find someone to love.<eos> Someone to have your back.<eos> Find a way home.<eos> Years go by and you finally realize...<eos> Are you even a captain when you have no crew?<eos> Are you a leader if no one is following?
- Zuru.<eos> Zuru!<eos> We're still in the watchtower's view!<eos> Why?<eos> The watchtower didn't react even when she took her helmettals off?<eos> Hey! Tae!<eos> Are there... any humans here with the Net Terminal Gene?<eos> Net Termi...?<eos> What?<eos> You saved us... so I wish we could do something to help you in return... but we don't know what it is you're talking about.
[bomb whistles, getting closer]<eos> He really told the story of solidarity and strength.<eos> Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, and the power of that marriage and that family, that they were unshakeable.<eos> It just was something that we want to live up to ourselves. [little boy giggles]<eos> And I think he knew that he could make a contribution.<eos> I think Wyler knew that he was strong enough in his self-confidence to know that he could tell a story about the real war and have a tremendous impact with that story stateside.<eos> There was a scene with a German pilot who was shot down over England, and he was caught by Mrs. Miniver somehow.<eos> And I said, "This man has got to be one of Mr. Göring's little monsters."<eos> And I got a call to go see Mr. Louis B. Mayer.<eos> He said, "We're glad to have you here with us, and we're glad you're making this picture, but you must remember one thing:
And it was the last work I did for the Army before going out of uniform.<eos> Each of these directors, they all went through a lot and came back with scars.<eos> You can't work on these projects and be immersed in moments of horror and the despair and not feel that.<eos> The idea of battle fatigue, or neurosis related to battle, was not considered at all valid.<eos> I followed one group through the hospital.<eos> I followed them from their induction, from the first time they filed in and sat down in the receiving room and it was explained to them what the cameras were doing there, and that the cameras would continue to follow them through their treatment.<eos> There's no need to be alarmed at the presence of these cameras, as they're making a photographic record of your progress at this hospital from the date of admission to the date of discharge.<eos> They were so deep in their own despair and shock that the presence of the camera made absolutely no difference to them.<eos> Do you feel conscious?<eos> That is, are you aware of the fact that you're not the same boy that you were went you went over?
Do you feel changed?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm not doing this deliberately.<eos> Please believe me.<eos> I do believe you.<eos> Now, a display of emotion is sometimes very helpful.<eos> - I hope so, sir.<eos> - Sure, it gets it off your chest.<eos> And it's in that film that I really get a sense of Huston's bigness of soul.<eos> Do you remember the explosion now?
- Yes, sir.<eos> Becausetheywere physically not hurt, but they were emotionally hurt.<eos> You're not going to work right away.<eos> You ought to rest a while, take a vacation.<eos> I have to make money.<eos> Last year, it was "kill Japs" and this year, it's "make money."<eos> In effect, when they come home, they're still fighting the internal war, and that internal war is something that haunts them, it haunts their dreams, it haunts their waking hours, it haunts the choices they make,<eos> it haunts how they react to conflict in the real world of postwar America.<eos> Can't you get those things out of your system? Oh, sure.<eos> Maybe that's what's holding you back.
Ah. Where's my mom?<eos> There's something I couldn't tell you over the phone.<eos> I pray that you remember me as the man that I aspired to be.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Ah.<eos> Do you understand there's no way we can distribute this amount?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you understand that if we don't get that first payment, a fleet of El Santo's hit men are gonna be on the next flight to Dallas.<eos> El Santo gave us no choice.<eos> I don't remember asking you a damn thing.
His palate is without question.<eos> And I'm sure he'll find our product unlike anything you can find available anywhere.<eos> For Epifanio, you're a number on his ledger.<eos> To me, you're family.<eos> And I will protect you and yours like I protect my own.<eos> _<eos> Well, looks like we're in charge of some high-level shit here.<eos> You get promoted?<eos> You should.<eos> I mean, you did do everything Camila asked you to.
What's mine?<eos> Guero.<eos> That's why you asked James to kill him in Bolivia?<eos> He's a snitch, Teresa.<eos> It doesn't matter how many times he bats his blue eyes at you.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> I've given you my loyalty.<eos> You don't have to kill him.<eos> I don't have to consult you or anybody else on these matters.<eos> You know, Guero, he still sees you as a morra on his arm.
This is Kelly Anne Van Auken.<eos> We met at the benefit party a while back. Yeah, hi.<eos> How are you? Oh, ha.<eos> Well, I'm just living the dream.<eos> Listen, um, I'm having a few girls over tomorrow night for a little wine tasting party. Could you join us?<eos> I know this is kinda random.<eos> No, thank you for inviting me.<eos> Well, I'll text you the address just in case you can make it.<eos> And I hope this wasn't too weird. Not at all.<eos> I'll see you then.
Entonces vamos a hacer un trato.<eos> About those funds you requested, I think I may have a work-around.<eos> Teo was a risk to both of us.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You left me.<eos> Look, Epifanio, he was... he was on his way to kill me.<eos> They had to do something, okay?<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> The DEA.<eos> Camila finds out about the DEA, she'll kill you.
Let's go right now.<eos> Screw Epifanio.<eos> Screw Epifanio.<eos> You know how to fly. Let's go.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> I can't do this forever.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's leave Culiacan.<eos> I'll fly you anywhere you want to go, anywhere in the world.
I'll fly you anywhere you want to go, anywhere in the world.<eos> And maybe one day, we can get ourselves a little house on the beach.<eos> Just drink cold sangria, make love all day in the sand.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> As long as I'm with you.<eos> No.<eos> I gots to go.<eos> Stay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
Te quiero mucho.<eos> Camila, thank you so much for coming in the office.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> A wat...<eos> What's happening with the DEA?<eos> Not much.<eos> Just a couple of government hacks sniffing around.<eos> Well, I pay your firm a hefty amount to ensure that my financial matters are above board.<eos> They are.<eos> Mateo handled the purchase of your trawler company flawlessly and attorney-client privilege protects you and your present dealings.
Just take deep breaths.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> I'm gonna splint your leg.<eos> I don't want the poison to spread.<eos> All right.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> It's military.<eos> I had combat first-aid training.<eos> We need to get you to the car.
Drop it!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> Hands behind your head!<eos> Where's the girl who was with you?<eos> What girl?<eos> Hey. Wake up, asshole.<eos> David Lee Autrey?<eos> My ass.<eos> You're just some pinche puto.<eos> Is that what they call you down in Mexico?
And eventually, I was back on top.<eos> The difference was there's no way in hell I'm ever gonna let anyone take that away from me again.<eos> To powerful friends.<eos> You got some real bad luck here.<eos> We usually don't see bark scorpions around here.<eos> That antihistamine should be kicking in.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> Thank you. Where's my friend?<eos> "Friend" gives you fake passports?
I used to work for a cartel.<eos> They forced me to be a mule.<eos> When I tried to escape, they killed my entire family.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> You got my attention.<eos> Go on.<eos> There's a tunnel at the border.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> We were doing surveillance.<eos> I can take you there right now.
You can tell the Border Patrol all about the tunnel.<eos> You know the cartels control everyone, even the Border Patrol.<eos> There's another way.<eos> This whole country's getting soft.<eos> You can barely touch a girl without some feminazi whining about harassment.<eos> Now I got Carl giving me crap about manhandling some bitch.<eos> Yeah, what bitch would that be?<eos> Your piece of ass.<eos> She got mouthy, and I was just about to shut her up.<eos> You think that makes you a tough guy, putting your hands on women?
Now.<eos> What's going on, Carl?<eos> Cut him loose right now.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Back off, back off.<eos> Just cool it.<eos> Move it!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I thought I told you to go.<eos> I'm not leaving you.
So, ugh! Unpart your hair. Definitely get rid of that sweater.<eos> This is gonna work.<eos> Oh I'm totally gonna help.<eos> Then let's get started.<eos> It's time to take them down once and for all.<eos> Thank you, Senator Warren.<eos> You will be a welcome addition to our luncheon next month.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well, if it isn't the man I love and two people I don't. Aw.<eos> You've almost gotten funny since the last time I saw you.
- Yes, exactly. - Yep.<eos> That's pretty much right.<eos> Could have told her myself.<eos> Well, she would have said no.<eos> - She hasn't said yes. - Uh, Earth to Clay...<eos> Seriously, both of you.<eos> Yes, we want you to throw an engagement party for us to use as a backdrop for a matter of national security.<eos> And I'm supposed to just blindly accept this?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.<eos> Right now, outside those doors, there's a vast conspiracy threatening everything you care about, and we're the only ones fighting it.
Yeah, you're Prime Roster material.<eos> How about it?<eos> When you're done saving the world, you can mentor the next generation of Supergirls.<eos> I would love that.<eos> Uh, Clay needs your help.<eos> He's outside on the phone with the Portuguese ambassador trying to explain why he can't bring both his mistresses.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I've seen you do it before. You did it with my mother.<eos> You're positioning yourself as her friend so she won't worry when you're alone with Clay.<eos> I am not positioning myself as anything, Caleb, except for a person who hopes to never see you again.
It's not the alcohol. I...<eos> Let's just be married, enjoy being married.<eos> I mean, we can have a wedding for everyone else, but let's elope for us.<eos> We can't do that. I mean, I'll...<eos> I'll talk to my mom... No.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I want to be married to you.<eos> And I could do without the wedding and the weird, I don't know, "my dad gives me away wearing a white dress conveying a virginhood I clearly don't have."<eos> But you don't want to elope because it's romantic.<eos> You just want to put a wall between you and whatever's pulling you away from me.
Can we go to the company?<eos> We got to do better<eos> - than 127 bucks.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> It's just $27.<eos> You must have misread the notice we sent home.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Numbers.<eos> They will get you every time.
It's my own money!<eos> But you are a kidnapper now.<eos> And the president of the United States is not gonna reverse his position of non-negotiation just to preserve my life.<eos> I'm not that important.<eos> Then they leave me no choice.<eos> You might get out of this, but you'll never be free again.<eos> For the rest of your life you'll be looking over your shoulder.<eos> And eventually, they will find you.<eos> If you really want out of this, you've got one chance.<eos> If those M16s weren't yours, then someone set you up.
Elizabeth, we had nothing to do with it.<eos> I hate being wrong.<eos> Now, I don't know if this'll be good news or not, but Defense Intelligence shared their files on movement<eos> - in and out of Somalia in the past...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I just have to do this again.<eos> - ...two months.<eos> We are so glad that you're back.<eos> It's extremely mutual, ma'am.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry to call you in already.
- Go, us.<eos> He organized this whole side deal selling stolen weaponry to cover his debts.<eos> And, when the CIA started closing in on him, that's when he ordered the hit on Joseph Garcia.<eos> In the State Department.<eos> That's insane.<eos> Sorry, what was the story with Barry Milken, then?<eos> So, he was helping Brennan cover up the theft from the Texas arms depot.<eos> And as soon as Brennan thought that Milken was gonna cut a deal with the FBI, he ordered to have him shot by a sniper.<eos> There he is.<eos> Oh, I can't believe we had to call you in today.
She's a criminal. I'm a cop.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> The way I hear it, you've had it out for Jamie ever since she dumped you.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about, okay?<eos> You were gone for a long time.<eos> Well, I'm back now.<eos> And I'm not gonna let you punish Jamie for breaking your little heart.<eos> So, you're gonna slap a special consultant badge right here on my chest and you're gonna take me in there with you, or your captain's gonna hear about how you stormed Reiden Tower and then disposed of key evidence via mail drone.
See, we had a deal in place.<eos> With Reiden?<eos> Whatever they told you, it isn't true.<eos> I didn't steal anything from them.<eos> I want to believe you,<eos> Clementine, I do, but I have a vast experience in matters such as these, and people don't make deals over valueless merchandise.<eos> See, Leanne? She's dead.<eos> And for the moment, our deal is dead along with her.<eos> But, between you and me, I think that we can come up with a better one.<eos> I just need to know what makes you so special.
You're making a mistake!<eos> Three, two, one. I'm pregnant!<eos> Shock me and you'll kill the first baby conceived in the last ten years.<eos> Let's call The Gentlemen.<eos> Who... who are The Gentlemen?<eos> Who are The Gentlemen?<eos> Is my friend coming?<eos> Uh, long story, but no.<eos> He's definitely not gonna make it.<eos> It's gonna take more than friends to get you out of this one, Jamie.
I know you're an adult and everything, but... if I don't hear from you soon, I'm gonna start picturing you tied up in the back of a van someplace, so give me a call, please.<eos> Okay?<eos> You look well.<eos> Small talk, really?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Well, the last time I apologized, I got slapped in the face, so I wasn't sure how a second apology would go over.<eos> Not well.<eos> You explained yourself in Portland.<eos> And to be honest, I get it.<eos> I get why you lied and hid from the truth.
I'm in high school, and you're still putting the dog in charge?<eos> Believe me, Meg, you want me in charge.<eos> Stewie can be a bit of a handful.<eos> He's right, you know.<eos> I'm a total Taurus, stubborn as they come.<eos> All right, fine, Meg.<eos> While we're away, you can be in charge.<eos> Come on, Lois, time to get to Fenway.<eos> Wow, dad, you look awesome.<eos> But I thought you were gonna dress like a baseball player.
Just to keep everything running smoothly.<eos> Sure, got to have boundaries.<eos> And I may assign a chore or two, that's great, Meg.<eos> Because it's actually more fun sounds like you got it all worked out.<eos> When everyone pitches in.<eos> Hey, by the way...<eos> Ah! I'm gonna flush your retainer down the toilet.<eos> Look at this, Lois, the Fenway park locker room.<eos> All right, Peter, I'm gonna go.<eos> You want to hand me some cash in front of the other men so you feel powerful?
Look, your spot's already paid for.<eos> And besides, if you leave, the teams will be lopsided.<eos> So, as your coach, I insist you stay and play with us.<eos> Right, fellas?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> What do you think, Peter?<eos> What do I think about sharing fantasy baseball camp with my wife?<eos> Yeah, come on, let her play.<eos> Wow, 1980s all-star Wade Boggs!<eos> Hey, would you mind standing next to a star of today?
Oh, my god, I can't believe I'm here.<eos> Lois, see that wall there?<eos> They call that "the green monster."<eos> And over there's where I threw a d-cell battery at Jose Canseco.<eos> All right, let's play ball.<eos> Wow, you must be excited, Peter.<eos> Yep, guess I can cross this one off my bucket list.<eos> All that's left now is living the pueblo lifestyle.<eos> Peter, what the hell did you do to the house?<eos> I know, it seems pretty lame until you realize I'm 58.
Peter, what the hell did you do to the house?<eos> I know, it seems pretty lame until you realize I'm 58.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go lick the foot of a fleshy, pale woman for real sex 34.<eos> Rupert, what do you think of this fan fiction I wrote?<eos> "Diego pressed Dora against the wall,<eos> "her bosom heaving,<eos> "her hot Latina breath on his face.<eos> For once, Diego was going to do the exploring."<eos> Whew, just reading it...<eos> Okay, Stewie, time for you to get dressed.
Or, how about this?<eos> I press my butt against the wall and dook on it?<eos> Stewie!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> You're messing with my schedule, so I'm giving you wall poo.<eos> Stop that right now.<eos> You just earned a time-out.<eos> A what?<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Don't you walk away!
Don't do that!<eos> You're messing with my schedule, so I'm giving you wall poo.<eos> Stop that right now.<eos> You just earned a time-out.<eos> A what?<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Don't you walk away!<eos> Hey, don't bruise me, I'm going dancing later.<eos> You listen to me, you little monster, I take abuse from everybody around here, but I am not gonna take it from you.<eos> Now sit here until I say you can get up.
Coming up after the break, we'll have highlights of the playoff game between...<eos> Streaking.<eos> Unrelated.<eos> Yep, her leg is fractured.<eos> We should get her to the hospital.<eos> My only medical training is to say "walk it off."<eos> Can you walk it off?<eos> No! Oh, well, that's not good.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go fake-use the phone in the dugout.<eos> Peter, what the hell got into you?
But I'm not a champ, I'm a fat loser.<eos> No wonder nobody ever picked me.<eos> I picked you, Peter.<eos> And to me and our kids, you will always be a winner.<eos> Thanks, Lois.<eos> And you know what?<eos> If that's true, I don't need to play in some stupid fantasy baseball game.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> You're gonna play in that game, and you're gonna get that hit.<eos> And when you do, we're all gonna be there to cheer you on.
You remember, right? Her father, that case, April 2007?<eos> Ok. Maybe you think you saw her...<eos> Her father's Jack Vaughn, former hit man for the Irish mob.<eos> He and Lindsey were in Witness Protection.<eos> Lindsey and her friend Katie were abducted,<eos> Katie was killed, and Jack murdered the unsub in front of me.<eos> Kill him.<eos> When does it stop?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Do you honestly not remember any of this?
Hey. Malcolm.<eos> Good to see you, brother.<eos> Thought I was gonna die in there.<eos> I'm glad you're ok.<eos> I'm all good.<eos> They got the green jell-o today. So much better than the yellow.<eos> What's the difference? It's a...<eos> Texture thing.<eos> You're a fed?<eos> That's gonna get you killed.
Yes, your honor.<eos> And that's gonna take time.<eos> Which is something he doesn't have.<eos> Unh! Help!<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're gonna need to grow eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Hey, hey, sit down.<eos> They're gonna beat you again.<eos> Might even kill you.<eos> You'll never see it coming.
And that's gonna take time.<eos> Which is something he doesn't have.<eos> Unh! Help!<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're gonna need to grow eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Hey, hey, sit down.<eos> They're gonna beat you again.<eos> Might even kill you.<eos> You'll never see it coming.<eos> You'll never see it coming.
Then you know we're 8,000 strong.<eos> Not just inside these walls, but all over.<eos> The Bureau's 80,000 strong, and you betrayed us, but it always comes back.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> After you leave, I'll have all my stuff back in a couple hours.<eos> That would be impressive, seeing you do that from FCI Milan.<eos> What... you transferring me?<eos> To Michigan?<eos> You won't get to see your son every week, and rumor has it that some of the Bratva family's holed up in there.<eos> You know, the Russian family that you double-crossed to begin with, and my understanding is that they are... excited to see you.
Who?<eos> You know who.<eos> Where's my mom?<eos> Henry... You know exactly where Emma is.<eos> She's in the same place that she's been for the last two years.<eos> Emma? You have a visitor.<eos> Your son.<eos> Mom.<eos> Henry.<eos> Thank god you remember me.
I'm not going down that road again.<eos> I've worked way too hard for you to undo my progress.<eos> Progress?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Those people... Snow white, prince charming, captain hook... None of them are real.<eos> My parents are not fairy-tale characters.<eos> No one in storybrooke is.<eos> There's no curse.<eos> This is just a regular town.<eos> Mom... What happened to you?
Maybe I can be your mother.<eos> Okay.<eos> How long have you been a patient here?<eos> You know how long I've been here.<eos> Maybe it'll help if you relive it.<eos> Ever since you tried to prove that fairy tales were real by eating a poisoned apple turnover.<eos> You ended up in the hospital for weeks.<eos> You barely made it through.<eos> No, that's not how it happened.<eos> Don't you remember?
Sorry about him.<eos> You have to stop doing that, or your mother's not gonna let you keep visiting me.<eos> Regina.<eos> She's here?<eos> Who's Regina?<eos> Henry.<eos> There's my boy.<eos> Madame mayor, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know he was coming today.<eos> How many times have I told you?
So, yes, I'm gonna climb this beanstalk, and I am gonna find that bean...<eos> Because I'm not gonna lose everything I have just because some bitter fairy cast another bloody curse!<eos> our story began on the beanstalk, and I'll be damned if it ends there, too.<eos> All right.<eos> You're scared of losing Emma.<eos> I get that.<eos> Just. Take a deep breath.<eos> All right, calm down.<eos> Let's go get that bean together.<eos> I've got to show you something.
All right.<eos> You're scared of losing Emma.<eos> I get that.<eos> Just. Take a deep breath.<eos> All right, calm down.<eos> Let's go get that bean together.<eos> I've got to show you something.<eos> Okay, well, unless we're waiting for a helicopter, I think we went the wrong way.<eos> We're here because this is the last place you saw your family.<eos> The last place you remembered who you really are...
That's not the way the world works.<eos> It does, and it did for you.<eos> You married captain hook right here.<eos> Captain hook?<eos> Who officiated... tinker bell?<eos> No.<eos> Jiminy cricket.<eos> It was amazing!<eos> The aisle was right here...<eos> Where your parents gave you away.
And you love him, too, right?"<eos> You're like, "Wait.<eos> Do I know this guy?"<eos> And they're like, "Oh, yeah, there's this guy Jesus, who everybody loves 'cause he loves everybody.<eos> And a long time ago, he died, and it's not totally your fault.<eos> So... don't be scared or sad 'cause he's in heaven now with his dad, who is also God.<eos> There's this other thing called The Holy Spirit that no one really understands.<eos> All three of these things are a cluster... that are staring at you all the time."<eos> If you have any questions, just pop into that strange broom closet in the corner with Father Steven, who no one's done a background check on.<eos> Don't forget to mention if you've been masturbating, 'cause he's fascinated by that.
So, I'm talking about all this on stage in this Christian college gymnasium, and... it's not connecting, you know?<eos> And it was really sort of awkward backstage after the show between me and this guy who booked me.<eos> He was just like, "Why?<eos> Why would you talk about Jesus for ten minutes on stage?"<eos> And I didn't have the best answer, but I feel like it's good enough to share with you guys.<eos> I said, "Jesus died... so I could tell those jokes."<eos> In fairness to the Christian college organizer, I'm a pretty safe bet as far as comedians go,<eos> I don't curse gratuitously on stage, which has a lot to do with my mom.<eos> No, really. When I moved to New York, she was upset, and I'd go, "Why?"<eos> She said, "I don't want you to become one of those dirty comedians."
Previously, on "Stitchers"...<eos> His father is James Miller, the man behind the $3 billion Ponzi scheme that wiped out how many people's life savings?<eos> He died.<eos> The funeral was yesterday.<eos> Kirsten, meet my brother.<eos> You can take the girl out of the trailer, - but you can't take the trash...<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Amanda, go!<eos> - Thanks for saving my life.<eos> - I was just so afraid of losing you.
Unless I'm coming off too strong.<eos> I can do that sometimes.<eos> It turns some people off.<eos> Linus.<eos> Not again.<eos> Principal Bruckner says you've been showing off to the other boys?<eos> Bragging that you know Pi to 175 digits.<eos> One-hundred and eighty-five, Papa.<eos> Maybe I need to act stupid, then they would like me.<eos> Linus... there's something I have to tell you.
He doesn't want to talk to me.<eos> And if anyone hears that Miller's been talking to the NSA, they'll think he's a snitch.<eos> Which can really shorten your prison time.<eos> The only person that can safely talk to Cameron's father right now is his lawyer.<eos> Well, Counselor.<eos> He said my lawyer was here to see me.<eos> You're not the only one who can pull off a scam.<eos> Okay, look... just so you know, there are a lot of things I want to say to you right now.<eos> But for now, I'll just say this.<eos> I work for the government, and I am here to help you.
- You remember.<eos> Okay, I get that you're angry.<eos> You have no idea how I feel. Why would you?<eos> You haven't picked up a phone in fourteen years.<eos> Cameron, it's complicated.<eos> - I need you to leave now.<eos> - No.<eos> Not until you help me make it less complicated.<eos> I know all about Parsons.<eos> Why'd he attack you? Who's Bruce?
You haven't picked up a phone in fourteen years.<eos> Cameron, it's complicated.<eos> - I need you to leave now.<eos> - No.<eos> Not until you help me make it less complicated.<eos> I know all about Parsons.<eos> Why'd he attack you? Who's Bruce?<eos> Bruce?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Can you think of anyone who might've paid Parsons to kill you?
Yeah, okay, Officer.<eos> And next time you cross the line, I will arrest you, no matter how young you are.<eos> It's pretty stupid of you, letting yourself get arrested to protect your sister.<eos> Brave... stupid.<eos> Look out for her.<eos> You really screwed up this time!<eos> - You could have been arrested!<eos> - Why?<eos> It's your pot.<eos> You're so lucky I covered for you.
All right, heads or tails?<eos> Uh... let's go heads.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, heads it is.<eos> You go, I pay.<eos> That was fast.<eos> You saw James Miller today.<eos> What did he tell Who?<eos> I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> - What did he tell you?
Pregnant?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this isn't the best time, but...<eos> I had to tell you.
As an adult, all you get is underwear and your family.<eos> Mmm, I've done your laundry.<eos> Underwear's a good gift for you.<eos> Did something' happen?<eos> Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Oh, by the way, I stopped by the gas station.<eos> Got some stocking' stuffers for Darlene's kids.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> And if you got my gift there, you can use the gas you bought to get the fuck out of here.
- Since my parents got here.<eos> - What? I thought they were meetin' us at midnight Mass.<eos> I know, but my dad wanted to stop by and take a look at the furnace.<eos> - I just fixed your furnace.<eos> - Yeah, that's why he wanted to stop by.<eos> This is the last thing I need right now.<eos> Listen, don't be nervous.<eos> All right?<eos> Yeah, they don't like you.<eos> And, yeah, them talkin' about how much they don't like you is the reason why I'm on cigarette number four.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I just... I, uh...<eos> - wasn't expecting' to see 'em so soon.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And now I've got to come up with small talk here, and on the car ride to church and...<eos> If we just met 'em there, I could just give them the handshake, and the nod, and the "Peace be with you," be done.<eos> Colt, you're overreacting, all right?<eos> They're just my parents.<eos> I know what'll make you feel better. Here.
It was everywhere, every news show, every website, and that's when I learned the word you don't want people to use when a nude photo of you goes viral.<eos> "Brave."<eos> You take your clothes off in front of someone for the first time, and they're just like, "Damn!<eos> You look mad brave right now.<eos> Shorty looks empowered!" Like, no!<eos> As if I'm standing there, like, "I am brave!"<eos> No, just fuck me.<eos> I am blacking out tonight.<eos> I am blacking out tonight. Anybody?<eos> Who loves you?
I'm just like, "Sick party, right, Coop?" Like, I'm not--<eos> I'm trying to help him get out of the conversation with me.<eos> I'm like, "Okay."<eos> Because all these gorgeous girls are around, just foaming at the mouth, just like, "Oh, let me at that dick hole."<eos> And...<eos> And I tried to get him out of it.<eos> I'm like, "All right.<eos> Have a good night."<eos> And he's like, "Wait, Amy.<eos> It's really good to see you.
And he's like, "Wait, Amy.<eos> It's really good to see you.<eos> Let's hang out."<eos> I'm like, "Okay... my new boyfriend."<eos> Fully went there.<eos> And then...<eos> Then we talk a little more, and then 20 minutes go by, and I'm like,<eos> "Okay, I'm gonna grab my seat." And he grabs my wrist.<eos> He goes, "Wait.<eos> It's, like, really good to see you.
Okay.<eos> Now, I've never worked with Nimah before, just read her file, like you.<eos> She's strong-willed, determined, righteous, weighed down by her sins, - and doesn't know how to let go of her p... - No need to continue.<eos> Amin's not a real member of this team, just a glorified mascot.<eos> You didn't ask about Shelby Wyatt.<eos> An orphan. She's worked hard to craft her own identity and now cares way too much about how the world perceives her.<eos> Think I'm pretty well-versed on her weak points.<eos> Here's to long days, short nights, and wondering if you're saying the wrong thing every time your new boss talks to you.<eos> Really?<eos> Ignoring me for some townie who's not even making eyes at you?
Cheers.<eos> You don't have to leave. You could stay here, join us. Well, you're not authorized to offer that, Alex.<eos> And I don't see anyone else knocking on my door.<eos> Well, you really haven't given them a reason to, Harry. You said it yourself... You're not a team player.<eos> Well, now you finally get it. - And on that note... - All right.<eos> - No, no, please don't get teary on my...<eos> - Hear me out, okay?<eos> This morning, Clay forced us to face our weaknesses, and I think it's only fair that someone tell you yours.<eos> You joke your way around everything because you're afraid to make a connection...<eos> Maybe because the closest connection you ever made died right in front of you. And I get that.
You don't need me to stay one step ahead of his investigation, 'cause I'll tell you right now what he's gonna find.<eos> The truth.<eos> What must be known eventually should be known immediately.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Raymond.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Peracchio's been arrested.<eos> - What? How?<eos> Trussed like a Tom Turkey and dumped in front of the 9th precinct.<eos> A detailed financial statement tying him to you pinned to his chest.
They'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Special agent Donald Ressler.<eos> Good to see you too, Julian.<eos> Get that hand out of the way.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> By the way, you're welcome.<eos> For what?<eos> Inviting me to the morgue?<eos> "For what"?<eos> For yanking you away from whatever the bureau has got you working on to do some real work.
I can't do that, Elizabeth.<eos> Then you can't come up.<eos> I haven't laid eyes on Agnes since the night I helped you escape.<eos> So big.<eos> Whatever are you feeding her?<eos> You risked your life for our family and he shot you for it.<eos> He shot you.<eos> I can never make that right, but I can protect you.<eos> I can keep you safe.<eos> But that would mean that I have to take you into custody.
I can never make that right, but I can protect you.<eos> I can keep you safe.<eos> But that would mean that I have to take you into custody.<eos> You are safe, you are loved, you are wise.<eos> Where did you hear those words?<eos> I know those words.<eos> You know them because I said them to you many times a day when you were a baby.<eos> That can't be true.<eos> Regular affirmations build a child's self-confidence, you're proof of that.<eos> It's no surprise you don't remember with all you've been through.
That can't be true.<eos> Regular affirmations build a child's self-confidence, you're proof of that.<eos> It's no surprise you don't remember with all you've been through.<eos> You and I were very close once.<eos> You knew me as Katya.<eos> I was your nanny.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Your mother hired me to care for you.<eos> I promised her that I would defend you with my life.<eos> The reason I'm telling you this now is so that you'll listen to me when I beg you, walk away.
Diane Fowler's living room.<eos> It was catalogued, crated and stored in evidence.<eos> Seems the bureau spares no expense for their leadership.<eos> We're gonna reconstruct the whole scene.<eos> And we're gonna dissect it until we find what we need.<eos> This is extreme, even for you.<eos> I'm just getting warmed up.<eos> Are you working on anything related to Reddington?<eos> Is anybody?<eos> Were you ever given a satisfactory answer as to why the task force was disbanded by the bureau?
Like hell.<eos> Stay put.<eos> I'm contacting homeland security, then we'll come up with an action plan.<eos> Together.<eos> Excellent work, agent Keen.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> How'd you change the fingerprint?<eos> The fingerprint?<eos> Don't play dumb.<eos> The one Gale and Ressler found that connects you to the death of Diane Fowler.
Give me a reason.<eos> A real one.<eos> I love you.<eos> That's all I got.<eos> - Looks like I am the welcome committee.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, I thought there'd be a big banner or some home-cooked lasagna, at least.<eos> I mean, isn't that what you people do?<eos> What, you mean FBI agents or clandestine task forces?<eos> You know, no one welcomed me here, but Alex said it was mandatory that you feel at home.
I really thought it would take them longer to frame someone.<eos> You know how easy that is.<eos> Who gets a call when I die?<eos> We don't have many connections, people in our lives to grieve over us, and we made that choice.<eos> Doesn't feel like a choice.<eos> Well, it's because you've made it time and again. It's who you are.<eos> You're the woman who shot your father to save your mother.<eos> You're the woman who chased a terrorist to stop a nuclear bomb.<eos> You're the woman who raced into a crisis instead of away from it.<eos> You're not the person to hide from anything, and you never will be.
- Is this your place?<eos> - Share it with some friends.<eos> Let me take your coat.<eos> Wait, where's the party?<eos> We're the party.<eos> We got drinks.<eos> We got music.<eos> We got whatever you may need.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
You need to get your team out there and figure out what to do next.<eos> What team?<eos> I-I mean...<eos> I've got two members, Ryan Booth and Shelby Wyatt, who are too radioactive to leave The Farm because they've been named in the press as potential lieutenants of yours.<eos> Raina Amin is still pretending to be her sister, who, I remind you, is being held at an undisclosed location they won't even tell you about.<eos> And Alex Parrish and Owen Hall have disappeared.<eos> Who knows what they're up to?<eos> I f-feel like all I've been saying for the last day is "no comment,"<eos> because for the first time in my life, I don't know what's happening.<eos> That's because you're trying too hard to save me.
When I started working with the team, it was hard for me, too.<eos> But the more I've done with them, the more I understand this is for the good of the country.<eos> I made the right choice. And I promise... so did you.<eos> Your ex-fianc.<eos> He hasn't stopped calling since I left The Farm.<eos> I'll deal with it later.<eos> No, now is better.<eos> I don't want you distracted in there.<eos> You've got to stop calling me.<eos> Where the hell did you go?
You've got to stop calling me.<eos> Where the hell did you go?<eos> ! And what the hell are you doing?<eos> ! I left, Ryan.<eos> Yeah, I got that, Alex.<eos> Look, if you're in trouble...<eos> I'm not. I'm in control for the first time since we started this whole thing with Clay.<eos> I'm not interested in sitting in the bunker and debating endlessly about what we should do and then fail when we do it.<eos> I want to win. So you decided to join the winners?<eos> Have you conveniently forgotten that they hate you and everybody that looks like you?
Maulik Patel, Paula Reyes, Mike Lowery, Donald...<eos> Wait, wait, wait. What? What happened?<eos> Mike Lowery is the special agent leading the investigation against President Haas and the task force for the FBI.<eos> The air vent from the waste room goes right under his office.<eos> They want to make it look like Claire killed her enemy, and I'm their Trojan horse.<eos> If that's their plan, you have to let it happen.<eos> How about looking the other way for a six-year Bureau vet?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You want to fight or you want to save people?<eos> I hate it when you say that.
It says Prince died and all I got was this lousy hat.<eos> It's not really you.<eos> What about now?<eos> Take the hat off, Jill.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Now that this thing is starting to get real, I'm totally freaking out.<eos> I don't even know what she should call me.<eos> I mean, I'm not her mom, "Jill" sounds too familiar, and "Mama Jill" sounds like I run a whorehouse.<eos> You were a foster kid.<eos> What'd you call the people who took you in?
The woman. There was a woman.<eos> Yes. She got off at the last stop.<eos> You must be Raymond.<eos> She said you might come.<eos> Said to give you this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, Raymond.<eos> You can't keep up this wild goose chase, Kate.<eos> I'm gonna find you.<eos> I'll save you the trouble.
Nikolaus. How are you, my friend?<eos> Very well, Mr. reddington.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you don't mind, we need to wand you and your man.<eos> A change in protocol, I see.<eos> Orders of Mr. Von hauser.<eos> Werner.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to hear me out.<eos> I promised to meet with you.<eos> I never said I would listen to you.
It's not your fault.<eos> You're the victim here.<eos> He's the victim.<eos> I'm... Yes.<eos> And you're a murderer.<eos> And one day we're gonna prove it.<eos> Every part of this little drama, Kate, is playing out as grand tragedy.<eos> Family feuds always do.<eos> Werner's dead. Raymond.<eos> You may have bitten the hand that feeds you this time, dearie.
He's loyal, and honest, and he believes that no one, no one, is above the law.<eos> And I believe that one day you'll be the one being dragged off in handcuffs and he'll be walking into his lake house to watch the sunset.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Never gonna happen.<eos> I want every detail. What you did.<eos> How you did it.<eos> What memories you implanted in agent ressler's consciousness and what you took away.<eos> You're going to give me everything we need to exonerate him.<eos> I could do that, I suppose. If properly motivated.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
Two! Not 25.<eos> Two!<eos> Kaplan is using krilov.<eos> What was the secret you needed krilov to take away? Nothing.<eos> She's using him to pull at threads.<eos> To continue to unravel my life.<eos> He's sidelined ressler.<eos> He's trying to do the same to you.<eos> You did it once. Yes.<eos> When you were a child. To protect you from the memory of killing your father.
We don't have much time.<eos> Get to Emma.<eos> It's important.<eos> Make her believe again.<eos> So it's true.<eos> You're really leaving storybrooke.<eos> It's what's best for both of us, kid.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> This is what she wants.<eos> The black fairy cast the curse so all this would get you to leave.
No, no!<eos> Please, no! Please, no!<eos> Please, no!<eos> No.<eos> You found me.<eos> Did you ever doubt I would?<eos> Truthfully, the beanstalk that fell on me gave me pause.<eos> Snow, we're gonna be fine.<eos> Darkness never wins.<eos> It just fools you into thinking it does.
Let's go.<eos> Mr. gold?<eos> And where do you think you're going to, young man?<eos> That room is off limits to customers.<eos> I'm not a customer.<eos> I'm your grandson.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yep.<eos> You must've hit your head pretty badly.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I got work to do, so... Please.
I don't want to leave!<eos> Please!<eos> Belle.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I can explain if you give me a chance.<eos> Leave me alone, okay?<eos> I'm safe here.<eos> Belle, I know this is difficult to understand...<eos> But... You're not like this.<eos> The black fairy did this to you. Changed you.
I couldn't let that happen.<eos> But once the final battle is won, the curse on belle and Gideon will be lifted, and I will have unchecked powers.<eos> Not even the laws of magic will apply.<eos> I can make them love you without you having to give up being the dark one.<eos> Don't you realize?<eos> You can finally have it all.<eos> No...<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't trust you.<eos> All you care about's yourself.
Well, go on.<eos> Spend 100 years seeing it, then 100 years wrecking it.<eos> No.<eos> It won't... Be... Real.<eos> Gideon, stop.<eos> Do not kill Emma swan.<eos> Did you really think it was gonna be that easy?<eos> This is the black fairy's spell we're talking about here!<eos> You may want to do the right thing, but as we all know, we can't always get what we want.<eos> No one's going to save you.
I will give hope... no matter what the cost.<eos> No!<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I was hoping you'd save us both.<eos> I failed you, belle.<eos> I failed our family.<eos> I made the right choice.<eos> It just didn't work out.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
No!<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I was hoping you'd save us both.<eos> I failed you, belle.<eos> I failed our family.<eos> I made the right choice.<eos> It just didn't work out.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, too!
I love you, too.<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Is that...<eos> It's Gideon.<eos> A fresh start.<eos> A happy ending.<eos> No.<eos> A happy beginning.<eos> Henry!<eos> I think this belongs to you.
Oh, so you're telling me that she was smarter than you?<eos> - Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> Yeah, I don't believe that.<eos> - Oh, believe it. - Mm.<eos> Frankie was a double major in mechanical engineering and biology.<eos> She was an expert in DNA.<eos> She made me look like...<eos> Well... she made me look like you... no offense.<eos> None taken.<eos> You wish you could look like me.
The results were incredible.<eos> No matter how degraded a sample, we were able to sequence it with a 94% accuracy.<eos> So Boston PD upped the ante.<eos> They sent us a cold case.<eos> Sample...<eos> Ah. A35-B42-1707.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cops knew this blood was the killer's, but all current methods of DNA testing had failed to sequence it.<eos> But your method could.<eos> So this is all happening because your research put you on the trail of a killer.
Let's go.<eos> What? Why?<eos> The centrifuge hasn't started spinning.<eos> We still need to separate the serum...<eos> Hey, we're about to have our serum separated.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Only six.<eos> - But they got guns, man. Let's bounce.<eos> - Guns?<eos> Yeah, those things that'll kill you.
I need to just get them in the car and leave town.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> These guys are not gonna stop until they find you.<eos> And besides, if you leave now, you won't be able to finish your work.<eos> Oh, my work?<eos> Yeah, who cares about my work?<eos> I do.<eos> Frankie, everything we used to talk about you're actually doing now.<eos> I can't just let you walk away from it.<eos> Mac, this isn't about you.
I do.<eos> Frankie, everything we used to talk about you're actually doing now.<eos> I can't just let you walk away from it.<eos> Mac, this isn't about you.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> It's not about me.<eos> It's about you and what you're doing for the world.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Yesterday, I thought that you were dead, and if you walk away now, if you just run... you kind of are.
They're in the trash can, okay?<eos> ! I threw them away.<eos> Why would you throw the instructions away?<eos> I didn't think I needed 'em to put together a child's bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Instructions for what?<eos> So, you know the best part about that, Danny, is that only a child would throw away the instructions.<eos> Give me that screw gun.<eos> Give-give it to me.<eos> You cannot be trusted with the big boys' toys.
And if I say no to her, I'm the bad guy.<eos> Get to see her for two seconds, and then she takes off.<eos> You know what? Don't cancel it.<eos> Don't cancel it, but next time, when it's your weekend,<eos> I'm gonna... I'm gonna sign her up for space camp.<eos> Guys, everybody, this is still... every time, it makes me laugh.<eos> It gets funnier every time?<eos> Good.<eos> Great.<eos> You know they're only messing with you 'cause they can tell it gets to you, right?

All right.<eos> Hey, we got to get him out of here, all right?<eos> Aheahe Makino.<eos> It's a burner phone.<eos> Just a few incoming numbers from today.<eos> Let me see it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Jerry, it's Danny.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> I just sent you a photograph and a bunch of phone numbers.
Her name's Lara Kendall.<eos> She's an alleged contract killer.<eos> Been the suspect of a couple hits on the mainland.<eos> I also ran the numbers on her burner, and one of them matched to this guy.<eos> Dario Mendez.<eos> According to HPD, he's the current head of the Ochoa cartel.<eos> There's an outfit we haven't heard from in a while.<eos> You dealt with them before?<eos> They used to be pretty big in the coke trade.<eos> We took out their leadership before you moved here.
He must have had second thoughts and hung up the phone.<eos> By the time I got there, he was gone. The one time in my life I didn't hang up on my ex-wife.<eos> I could have prevented this.<eos> Me.<eos> My fault.<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No? Maybe the guy didn't get second thoughts.<eos> Maybe that's when they grabbed him.<eos> You don't know, and you can't blame yourself for that, Danny.
How's... how's that going? What, retirement?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> Why? You thinking about hanging it up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I will tell you, it will be Hawaii's loss, but, you know, I mean, you've certainly earned it. But can I give you some advice?<eos> No, please.<eos> Have an exit plan.<eos> Um, find something you love, do that.<eos> And there's one other thing... And you're gonna laugh... But whatever you do, do not open a restaurant.
Commander, just one more question.<eos> Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar?<eos> None, and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But we can hope.<eos> I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.<eos> - Zee, what are you doing?<eos> - Making shells.<eos> They're evacuating our level. We have to go.<eos> - I'm not going with you.
Okay.<eos> Look, you can fly Royalty Express for a year, or you can leave the airline.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> Let me have a look here.<eos> Welcome to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.<eos> Remain seated until the aircraft has come to a complete stop and the captain has turned off the "fasten seat belt" sign.<eos> We know you have a choice when you travel.<eos> We thank you for choosing Royalty Express.<eos> I don't know if I mentioned it.<eos> I'm glad I'm working with you.
Now that Virginia confronts the armed might of the United States we Virginians have determined that not one spot of her sacred soil be polluted by the foot of an invader.<eos> Now, in the memory of that great Virginian, George Washington who was first in the hearts of his countrymen and calling also upon the memory of his own gallant father, General Light-Horse Harry Lee this convention now calls upon Robert Edward Lee to take command of the armed forces of the Citizen Army of Virginia.<eos> Mr. President, gentlemen of the convention I'm profoundly impressed by the solemnity of the occasion for which I must say I was not prepared.<eos> I accept the position assigned me by your partiality.<eos> I would have much preferred had your choice fallen on an abler man.<eos> But trusting to Almighty God, an approving conscience and the aid of my fellow citizens I devote myself to the service of my native state in whose behalf alone will I ever again draw my sword.<eos> We must not fear the final result of this war, but many a loved one will fall and many a heart throb with anguish before we can breathe the exhilarating atmosphere of freedom and feel the sweet assurance of safety and peace once more.<eos> There's nothing in this life more dear to me than my children except perhaps the memory of your wonderful father.<eos> When you go to Richmond, and wherever this war takes you you must not fear for us.<eos> We will be with you wherever you go.

-We need help!<eos> Got a sick guy inside!<eos> -This area is under temporary quarantine.<eos> -Stay where you are.<eos> -What quarantine?<eos> .<eos> -We got a sick guy down here!<eos> -We need your help here!<eos> -We got a real sick guy here!<eos> -T ake him with you now!
I fold. - What did you have?<eos> - Hey! That's not how we play.<eos> - Your deal. - Hey, man, good game.<eos> Well, well, well... Looks like boys' night in, huh?<eos> Kinda sad.<eos> I'm gonna change all that.<eos> Time for a field trip.<eos> We got the van outside.<eos> We're all going for drinks at the Blue Ridge.<eos> All right, your objective - reach the parking lot with an asset who intends to have sex with you.
This one's orange!<eos> -Dona Graça, Ebony sent you this.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -Oh, look. My man.<eos> Want some?<eos> -No, thank you.<eos> See, Franci?<eos> That's the sort of man I want.<eos> -You think Deusdete will like me?<eos> -That's up to the two of you.
U.S. Marshal.<eos> That's Carter.<eos> I never gave rings to a guy before.<eos> The rings are secure, sir.<eos> And we can all breathe a little easier.<eos> - Well done, Angels.<eos> - Thanks, Charlie.<eos> HALO is safe, thanks to you.<eos> It's been a pleasure.<eos> I hope to work with you ladies again.
He must be stopped before he infects all of Germany.<eos> My lord, you gave Luther the promise of a safe conduct.<eos> Luther's not a man but a demon, clothed in his religious habit, the better to deceive us.<eos> Martin Luther's your subject.<eos> What do you say?<eos> He is too daring for me, my lord.<eos> Although not, it seems, for the people.<eos> If anything should happen to him on the way back... so be it.<eos> God bless your journey home, Brother Martin!<eos> Truth will out, Brother Martin! God be with you!
My lords... silence will not save us.<eos> If we challenge Charles, will there be war... the awful shedding of yet more blood?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> I've mislaid all my former certainties.<eos> But think.<eos> The Emperor invites us to present our creeds, to present what we believe in.<eos> Satan invites us to preach in hell.<eos> Is that a trap?<eos> Or our greatest opportunity so far?<eos> And remember, since I may not come with you to Augsburg, you'll face Charles' wroth alone.
Who's with Frank?<eos> Yes, I'd like to report a robbery in progress at Mardi Gras Costumes.<eos> 6510 Charter Street.<eos> Maybe some of you are afraid or intimidated.<eos> Maybe some of you are just out for yourselves.<eos> Frank is right about me.<eos> I'm the worst offender here.<eos> I made up my mind about this case before I stepped through that door.<eos> But this trial's not about me.<eos> And it's not about you.
Maybe I can help you gents.<eos> I been here since Harmonville was Fort Harmon and we still had soldiers to chase off Indians.<eos> I know everybody in town and for miles beyond.<eos> Big man needing a haircut, about 30.<eos> That's his rig right there.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Know who you're talking about.<eos> Very friendly young fella. Looks like he's been living out of saddlebags most of his life.<eos> Got his horse in the corral.<eos> Ride with you, does he?
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon underneath a magic moon.<eos> I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.<eos> I think I'll be an Indian brave.<eos> Now everybody try.<eos> One, two, three!<eos> We can fly!<eos> We can fly!<eos> We can fly!<eos> This won't do.<eos> What's the matter with you?
I worry about it.<eos> I worry about there to be so much drink that we won't be able to her to take.<eos> You are right, friend.<eos> I don't know you, but I will attempt to discover where all are.<eos> Somebody more he comes?<eos> No, I and Cynthia will play music the whole night, non doll?<eos> Ok, I go with you.<eos> I will be diabetic with so much sweetness here.<eos> - And your, boy?<eos> - I won't stay, I go with you.
A little late in delivery?<eos> Ah, well now, the customs confiscated it.<eos> Now, see here, you owe me one hundred pounds or one book.<eos> Well, I suppose I could write it again.<eos> Was it good?<eos> Well, you know...<eos> Don't ever believe English modesty is charming.<eos> It's irritating, it's what it is.<eos> It was exceptionally good.<eos> What is it with you people?
Never went.<eos> Markum dummied up on the guys he was working with DA was afraid he wouldn't be able to convict.<eos> So he cut a deal.<eos> Two years inside, couple more suspended.<eos> So Jimmy Markum never knew that Ray Harris ratted him out?<eos> Ray Harris disappeared about two months after Markum rotated back into the free world.<eos> What's that tell you?<eos> - Hey, coz, how you doing? - I'm good.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a sec?<eos> - I'll catch up with you in a minute.
We're fine. Thank you.<eos> I was kind of hoping that someday soon, we could have a little talk.<eos> I'd really like to tell you why I think I'll make a good husband, whenever you get a chance.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Come on.<eos> See, I was saying that soon we could talk.<eos> This right now is sort of the preliminary talk before the future longer talk, which would be like a quiet, a private dinner talk.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> Good talking to you.
- What stinks?<eos> - That'd be me, sir.<eos> - Wife made the stew last night.<eos> - Shut up, Lloyd. - You're not married yet.<eos> - Will be.<eos> I hope you'll all enjoy your new classroom. This is not it.<eos> It's a special wing in back of the school we've built for you. Why don't you go back and take a look at it now?<eos> Quickly, now. Just head back there. That's it, now.<eos> Principal Collins, what about the crippled boy?<eos> - Yes, take him with you.
Emily!<eos> Emily just cooperate!<eos> - We're being disappeared aren't we?<eos> - Don't worry. It's a mistake.<eos> Gentlemen, this woman is a U.S. Trade representative she's got... nothing to do with this.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Thanks for trying.<eos> Okay, okay. L- l - I'll get it.<eos> Just take the tape out, see?<eos> What is that with you, people?
soundproofing this room.<eos> Get on it.<eos> Can I be the band stylist instead?<eos> Of course you can, Fancy Pants.<eos> OK.<eos> Carrot Top, Roadrunner, Turkey Sub, we're gonna have a lot of equipment.<eos> We're talking amps, electric guitars, maybe even lasers and smoke machines.<eos> Now, your job is to master the transportation and operation of this technology.<eos> Without a first-rate roadie crew, we'll never have a psychedelic show, and I can't live with that, OK?<eos> I'm counting on you.
Now I can say what I want to lt's just this much lf we had to account for whatever we had collected over the last 40 years... we would come to the conclusion that in the struggle of life...<eos> "we never could be together, despite wanting to"<eos> We didn't even get to know when you had grown up and gone your ways<eos> The joy that was in living together... came to us in small moments<eos> And we always kept looking forward to these small moments... when we would meet and get together<eos> But now I have retired<eos> And I have all the time in the world<eos> "And now, I want to make good what I have lost in the last 40 years"<eos> "By giving you our love, by having your love..."<eos> by staying with you
Sign that thing here.<eos> Happy anniversary<eos> Happy anniversary, happy anniversary<eos> Happy anniversary<eos> Happy, happy, happy, happy<eos> Hey, sign this!<eos> Okay, Jim.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> - No.<eos> It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
I want you to know up front that O'Reilly only represents actors who are truly committed to their craft.<eos> That's me, Mr. O'Reilly.<eos> I am fully committed.<eos> Committed enough to pay my $200 up-front service fee? .<eos> Which, of course, is used to defray the costs of registration fees entitlement paperwork and what have you.<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> . -I'm showing him how committed I am.<eos> You're showing him how stupid you are. Here.<eos> We'll give you $100 because you're only representing one of us.<eos> Look, I'm gonna level with you.
You cannot comment. You have not seen her.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> - You afraid to try? - I'm afraid of nothing.<eos> There.<eos> You shed no tears.<eos> By your actions, you have left me without love or hope... and Sparta without its future king, and you show no grief.<eos> It should have been you who died.<eos> Is there any among you who will take this cursed woman?<eos> Is there any among you... who wishes their home devastated, his country brought to ruin, his heart broken beyond repair?<eos> I leave her to you.
Isn't it, Chris? - Yeah.<eos> - So, what is it that you guys do?<eos> - We talk to people about our church.<eos> Oh really?<eos> Chris likes to talk to people.<eos> - Sometimes it helps people to find meaning in their lives.<eos> - Julie was complaining her life is void of meaning.<eos> - Void?<eos> I said 'void'?<eos> - Well, maybe we can come talk to you.
I've seen wars but never experienced them.<eos> I'm leaving for Edo.<eos> There are some 1,300 soldiers.<eos> My guess is there's a total of over 3,000 men including carriers.<eos> Sure, it's a courteous sick bed visit, bringing such a huge army with him.<eos> Going at this rate, they'll reach Edo in 7 days, perhaps 8.<eos> Let's get on with demon extermination.<eos> Jubei.<eos> I feel nostalgic just to hear your name.<eos> I kept missing you and couldn't have a match with you while I was alive.
Then, me too!<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> The era of wars is calling me.<eos> I'm coming to Edo.<eos> Shiro Tokisada Amakusa has arrived.<eos> I was waiting for you, Jubei.<eos> Well done, you made it here.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> It is you, father, as I suspected.<eos> I've always wanted to have a good duel with you without interference.
I have told you this while I am still with you.<eos> The helper, the holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name... will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told you.<eos> Peace is what I leave with you.<eos> It is my own peace that I give you.<eos> I do not give it as the world does.<eos> Do not be worried and upset. Do not be afraid.<eos> You heard me say to you, "I am leaving, but I will come back to you."<eos> If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father... for he is greater than I.<eos> I have told you this now before it all happens... so that when it does happen, you will believe.<eos> I cannot talk with you much longer... because the ruler of this world is coming.
I am the vine, and you are the branches.<eos> Those who remain in me, and I in them, will bear much fruit... for you can do nothing without me.<eos> Those who do not remain in me are thrown out like a branch and dry up.<eos> Such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire... where they are burned.<eos> If you remain in me and my words remain in you... then you will ask for anything you wish, and you shall have it.<eos> My Father's glory is shown by your bearing much fruit... and in this way, you become my disciples.<eos> I Iove you, just as the Father loves me.<eos> Remain in my love.<eos> If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love... just as I have obeyed my Father's commands, and remain in his love.<eos> I have told you this so that my joy may be in you... and that your joy may be complete.
/ Not one. How long it will take you to kill one of us?<eos> / As long as it will take me to kill all of you.<eos> What if we put down our fifles and walk away peacefully.<eos> No, it's been a long day.<eos> We can't go home empty handed.<eos> We have to kill 15 of the enemy everyday and you are our first for today.<eos> Enough nonsense.<eos> Drop your weapon<eos> Drop your rifles!<eos> I'm with you. Finally, the voice of reason.
- Oh, okay.<eos> What happened?<eos> She was trying to stop your father from taking your camera.<eos> 1 00 rand.<eos> I've got 25 rands only.<eos> - I'll take it. - Sharp, sharp.<eos> Don't!<eos> - You start.<eos> Mom, dad,<eos> I love you both, but I can't live with you.
What have I missed?<eos> I was just thanking Ms. Reed for the attempted rescue.<eos> I appreciate your efforts a great deal.<eos> Did you escape?<eos> No, Mr. Bomani let me go.<eos> He let you go?<eos> He just let you walk right out the door?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did you offer him?<eos> Well, I gave him information that I eventually was going to share with you.
excellent.<eos> did you bring the samples i requested?<eos> blood, hair, epithelial cells.<eos> enough for you to work with?<eos> oh, yes.<eos> yes, i can work with this.<eos> the slipfighters are beginning to report in.<eos> they've been searching system by system, but there's no sign of theresolution of hectorso far.<eos> even if they do find it, we still don't know what's wrong with rommie.<eos> you know, what is it with you ais going crazy?
There he is.<eos> I grow weary of your cowardice, Angelus.<eos> If you will not stand with me, then suffer the agony of my wrath.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Go.<eos> - No!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> - No!<eos> - All of you!<eos> I can't do this with you here.
I'm a lawyer. I know my rights.<eos> You can't sequester a domestic animal without due cause.<eos> Well, it's coming off one way or the other, so ...<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> Hello, Sexy. Okay. Happy now?<eos> Thrilled.<eos> Let's start at the top.<eos> What's your human name, sir? Bud.<eos> Bud Simmons.<eos> But I'm no criminal, and I don't have to talk to you people.
You don't have to open up that wide.<eos> See, I'm implying I have a tiny, tiny penis.<eos> That's what that joke would be. Ergo, the comedy.<eos> I'm talking about penises.<eos> You just want to eat out of that toilet bowl.<eos> Shut up.<eos> (cheering) Shut up.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> Are you that stupid?<eos> I am making fun of you.
And actually, the ghost was the best of the bunch.<eos> See, now, that's what I'd call critical sisterly information.<eos> How am I supposed to be petty and judgmental without all the info?<eos> Sweetie, what do you expect?<eos> You didn't know her back then.<eos> It doesn't mean you're any less a part of us, though.<eos> - You know that, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> It would've been cool, though.<eos> Hang out with you, see what you guys were like.
I told you this place was a wreck.<eos> Piper, I need you to help me find Paige.<eos> I'm not talking to her till she cleans up her room.<eos> But it's about Glen's fiancée.<eos> I think she's done something to them.<eos> Something terrible.<eos> - I need you to help me find her.<eos> - Busy.<eos> Piper, you need to snap out of it, okay.<eos> This isn't about you guys anymore, it's about an innocent.
I think you have some issues, competitive issues.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Spencer Ricks?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You said you wanted to talk?<eos> No, I got the message that you wanted to.<eos> Actually, I sent the message.<eos> I didn't think you guys would come if you knew I wanted to meet you.
Insurance adjusters gone wild.<eos> - We're out of here.<eos> - Hang on, honey.<eos> You sure you don't wanna go?<eos> Oh, no, thanks anyway, Stemple.<eos> I'm just gonna walk back to the hotel.<eos> I was thinking of checking out this bookstore.<eos> Bookstore?<eos> It's people like you that give the insurance industry a bad name.<eos> Hang on, I'll walk out with you.
...gone wild.<eos> Took the words right out from my mouth.<eos> We're out of here.<eos> Hang on, honey.<eos> - Are you sure you don't wanna go?<eos> - Thanks anyway, Stemple.<eos> There's actually a bookstore I want to check out.<eos> Bookstore?<eos> It's people like you that give the insurance industry a bad name.<eos> Hold on. I'll walk out with you.
I will support you in every way I can.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you can start by just staying out of this.<eos> - Nurse:<eos> How did you get this?<eos> - JJ: Soccer.<eos> - Does he always wear his pads?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Dr. Granger, would it be possible to run a blood test to see if he's infected with something, but isn't showing any symptoms?<eos> Can I talk to you outside?
Walt: If he says he saw it, it happened.<eos> I'm Walt Bannerman, Penobscot County Sheriff.<eos> He's worked with us on a number of cases.<eos> I have never known him to be wrong.<eos> Really? You think if we went up there, we might be able to find the crash site?<eos> I'm not the hiker I used to be, but I might be able to help you narrow down the search.<eos> It's a lot of ground to cover, so... why don't I come along?<eos> Sorry, JJ, that's gonna kind of kill our camping trip.<eos> But why don't you stay with Mom until we come back?<eos> No way, we're going with you, Dad.
Go on.<eos> - Is our mom really sick?<eos> - Well, she has pneumonia.<eos> It's a serious disease, but we' re doing everything that we can.<eos> - We should call Doug-<eos> - No. Mom would freak.<eos> Call who?<eos> Doug.<eos> He's our brother.<eos> - Does he live with you?
No.<eos> But I'm very well-adjusted.<eos> - You about ready to go?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks, everybody.<eos> It's been fun.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've completely monopolized the intercourse.<eos> Yeah, I think it's about time for me to go too.<eos> - I'll walk out with you guys.
- The High Command was quite specific.<eos> You're to return to Vulcan.<eos> I believe that should be my decision.<eos> This is not a matter of choice.<eos> Defying the High Command would mean... immediate dismissal. You know that.<eos> Soval agreed to let us take her back to Vulcan, if it's all right with you.<eos> It's not that far out of your way.<eos> How's that last refit team doing?<eos> Scheduled to be done by 0600.<eos> I could tell you there are a lot of people counting on you.
Frank and Marie are gonna be here soon.<eos> - Hi. - Oh...<eos> Oh. Mom and Dad!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi. honey.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just-- I wasn't expecting you.
Always hardballing me, never paying on time.<eos> She's messing with how we get our money.<eos> Now, I can't do nothing about it, because she's all over my parole.<eos> She got me by the sack.<eos> I need some payback.<eos> Do you have any tape on her?<eos> Video?<eos> Audio?<eos> Miles and miles.<eos> -Did you bring it with you?
Look, you gotta loosen up, okay?<eos> Just loosen up a bit.<eos> Loosen the jaw, okay?<eos> They gotta see that you're part of his crew, okay?<eos> That you guys have history, all right?<eos> So, um, I laid down some bait for Rudy and Randi that I don't think they're gonna be able to resist.<eos> Fifteen pounds of heroin at the Rampart evidence locker.<eos> Street value: $8 million.<eos> I guarantee you they know about it.<eos> And I guarantee you they're gonna wanna do business with you guys again.
- She's almost fifteen minutes late.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, perhaps we should start without her. You can convene the meeting.<eos> If everyone will take their seats, we can call this meeting to order.<eos> - All right, since Paris isn't here... - Paris is here.<eos> Couldn't wait to jump in there and take over, could you?<eos> Tell it to the Timex salesman. My gavel, please?<eos> I call this meeting to order. I already did that.<eos> Sorry I'm late, but I had some very important business to attend to.<eos> Business which I must now, unfortunately, share with all of you.
I want this bastard to confess.<eos> How are we going to do that?<eos> Wear this when we jump.<eos> Jump?<eos> Hey, captain.<eos> Aren't you a little old to re-up?<eos> I hear there's a war on.<eos> Agent Dinozzo. Can't tell if you're enlisting or just listing.<eos> Haha, that's a good one.<eos> We're going with you, boys.
I always had someone else interview the mother.<eos> This was your first? Yeah.<eos> Why did you assume I had no idea how bad it was gonna be?<eos> I didn't think you would.<eos> That is so presumptuous!<eos> Kate?<eos> What?<eos> Breathe.<eos> The Commander's on a call with LANTFLEET, sir.<eos> He'll catch up with you as soon as he can.
Wait.<eos> Make me proud.<eos> Good God.<eos> I decided to take Jamie out on a date.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You know, Tasty Coma Wife?<eos> - No way.<eos> - Nice job, Hooch.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Give me a little time, and I'll rig it so that the husband can come with you.
Your mama know you're hanging out in a bad neighborhood?<eos> - Got me a note says it's a'ight.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Long John.<eos> - The pirate gangster, huh?<eos> Okay, let's empty your pockets.<eos> Hands up.<eos> We're lookin' for one of your customers.<eos> Don't got no customers.<eos> And I talk to you, I ain't got 'em no more.
Thanks for letting me join the band.<eos> - Might have been a mistake.<eos> - Oh, yeah? Who let the guy with the mustache in?<eos> - The ladies love the 'stache.<eos> - Listen, guys. Trust isn't something that happens overnight.<eos> And trust me, where we're going, we're gonna need it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry. We...<eos> We have a drive-by, gang-related, one fatality.<eos> That's you.
- What's the problem?<eos> - There's a terrorist in there.<eos> - Terrorist? - Tell them about the smells.<eos> - Chemicals, like he's makin' dirty bombs or something.<eos> My babies sleep on the other side of that wall.<eos> Look. I'm trying to raise two boys by myself.<eos> - Now I gotta deal with these people?<eos> - Okay. Fine.<eos> We'll check it out.<eos> I should come with you. No, ma'am.
Well, Lex, looks like you lose.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Hey, Lex.<eos> - Clark, I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> - No, it's not. Lex, what is it?<eos> According to my father, I'm no longer a Luthor.<eos> He's left me with nothing, not even a place to live.<eos> So I was wondering if I could stay with you for a while?
- It is my destiny to rule over Ardena!<eos> You don't understand the seriousness of your condition.<eos> - You don't realise who you are talking to.<eos> - I don't give a damn.<eos> You don't belong in that man's body, and I intend to take it back.<eos> Arethereotherconsciouspeople?<eos> No. The others still sleep.<eos> - Why have you come back?<eos> - You did something to one of our people.<eos> - Is he here with you? - He is not.
Can't somebody say something nice about him?<eos> They won't even let us see him.<eos> We've identified him.<eos> Where's the harm in looking again?<eos> They've moved him out to some place near Heathrow.<eos> "Overcrowding."<eos> I said, "Well, send him home.<eos> We're not overcrowded!"<eos> I'll get a colleague to run a piece.<eos> He'll talk it through with you.
- How long did it last?<eos> - Couple days.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - In my defense, she was psycho.<eos> Why are you giving relationship help?<eos> I'm the one who didn't get a"Dear John" e-mail from his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.<eos> - Will!<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> She's coming right now.<eos> - I got a message to meet you guys.
- Wes, what the hell is going on?<eos> - She's been taken.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - How many?<eos> - 188, 24 stat!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Zoey's been taken.<eos> We had her in the bathroom.<eos> She's gone.<eos> - She's messing with you.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - Zoey's been taken.<eos> We had her in the bathroom.<eos> She's gone.<eos> - She's messing with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Local news over there.<eos> - Doesn't matter!<eos> We move them away.<eos> She's messing with you.
Except now his lawyer wants to keep that out, too.<eos> Based on what?<eos> Spaulding's claiming he asked for a lawyer during the drive in...<eos> - and that we just flat-out refused him.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - It is crazy, right?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Washington wants an internal review of the Anwar Samir case.<eos> The OPR investigator is gonna talk to each of you separately...
We just, uh ...<eos> we just want to get a sense of the girls' lives.<eos> Sure you don't want a real drink?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Thanks. Not on the job<eos> Not ever.<eos> Right.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I can't get a read on this guy.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't speak with you at the house. I just, uh, I wanted to get back here to help out
"The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you<eos> '"he will never leave you nor forsake you. '"<eos> Moses knew.<eos> God is always with you.<eos> No matter what you do.<eos> How long have you guys been coming here?<eos> Eleven months.<eos> - And everyone gets along?<eos> - Yeah. Everyone's cool.<eos> No one comes here after school... throwing attitude at you or at Father Stevens?
Well, these guys are no different from us.<eos> No matter what the internal politics... when somebody from the outside comes in... they tend to close up ranks.<eos> So we have to be very careful and very sensitive... about how we push for answers.<eos> We've checked with the city attorney's office.<eos> There's no open investigations into this department.<eos> I'm not suggesting any improprieties within the firehouse... but I guarantee you, somebody there knows more than they're saying.<eos> I've sent Danny to speak to the fire inspector... so he can get a better sense of what went down there.<eos> Sam, I want you to dig deeper into Scott's finances.<eos> And, you two.<eos> I need to have a private word with you both.
Pants-- snow pants!<eos> You can't win.<eos> No matter what you do. they're still gonna grab your booze and go to a concert.<eos> No concerts!<eos> Shirts can come off at concerts. too.<eos> I gotta start a band.<eos> Guys. it's okay.<eos> You can wake up now.<eos> Sit up. guys.<eos> I want to talk to you.
I want to talk to you.<eos> Michael. come over here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Listen. guys...<eos> I said something before that was pretty harsh.<eos> But. uh. I said it. and I'm sticking by it.<eos> Okay. you understand that?<eos> I'm not backing down.<eos> So if you think Daddy's a party clown-- "Look at the bubbles coming out of his heinie"-- you can just forget about it.<eos> But... I might have a deal for you guys.
- What?<eos> Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer?<eos> Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi.<eos> It's overkill, Master.<eos> Investigation is implied in our mandate.<eos> We will do exactly as the council has instructed.<eos> And you will learn your place, young one.<eos> Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me... I will retire.<eos> I know I'll feel better having you here.
Amen.<eos> Very nice, Edward.<eos> All right!<eos> I have a story you don't know about Edward.<eos> Gather close.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Sumner.<eos> Sorry to bother you on the weekend.<eos> I'm Detective Dean.<eos> -This is Detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.<eos> We were hoping to talk to you for a few minutes.
You needed to file a grievance.<eos> - You filed the wrong paperwork.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> You're going to have to resubmit.<eos> It could take 30 days. - I don't have 30 days.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm getting sick of the run-around.<eos> I need my son's name on that list.<eos> Your account is in excess of $30,000.<eos> The hospital has bent over backwards to help you out.
-So be cool, okay? -Okay.<eos> What's this?<eos> If that slips out again, tuck it in for me.<eos> And the night before.<eos> You're not answering your pager.<eos> -Really?<eos> I never got the message.<eos> -Really?<eos> You said you'd take us to Niketown.<eos> Well, here, I'll go down with you.
Their lives may be at stake.<eos> Inspector, I understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to Wiluna.<eos> The children are headed into that country.<eos> I want the word spread.<eos> Let's see what that does.<eos> You wouldn't get me out there.<eos> She's pretty clever, that girl.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> Good thing you kids ran into me.<eos> A lot of people worried for you.
- The surgeon.<eos> The Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation. On a Jew?<eos> They let a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew?<eos> He got a pass, that's all I know.<eos> Anyway, so... he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation.<eos> He'd just made the first incision when the SS burst in... shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja and everybody else who was there.<eos> Isn't that a laugh?<eos> The patient didn't feel a thing, he was anesthetized.<eos> I said nothing bad.<eos> What's the matter with you all?
Get in!<eos> Mum, there was something in there!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Mum!<eos> Ahhhhhhh!<eos> Mum?<eos> Mum?<eos> Mum?<eos> I've kept this for years, because someday it will be up to you.
I don't think so.<eos> It's getting worse.<eos> We'll find a cartwright in the next town. What do we pay him with?<eos> We've not even got enough to bury Brendan.<eos> Then we'll perform.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> North to Durham, to perform for our lord's cousin.<eos> That's all we are, a Christmas gift from one noble family to another.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Can I come with you?
It's a shark!<eos> It's a shark, and it ain't friendly!<eos> It looks like a dolphin. Tricky fish!<eos> Tricky fish!<eos> Octopus, come and help me?<eos> The octopus is worse than the shark!<eos> I hate this planet!<eos> Little monster!<eos> Agent Pleakley here.<eos> I have lost patience with you both.
- What do you mean?<eos> Well, you know, you're one of them, right?<eos> Both you guys are?<eos> - One of who?<eos> - Look, Greg, tell your people that I can be trusted.<eos> Well, I'm very happy to hear that, because you know what would happen if that trust was ever betrayed.<eos> - Is this some kind of threat?<eos> - You think I'm threatening you?<eos> Look, Greg, I'm telling you what I told your boss.<eos> I'll deal with you guys, but don't think you can lean on me.
Howell, when do we start practising real hockey?<eos> Real hockey?<eos> This is real hockey.<eos> No.<eos> This is you rehearsing your show.<eos> We're supposed to play half exhibition games and half real games.<eos> - When do I work with my guys?<eos> - Soon.<eos> - Pull my finger, Jeff. - (farts)<eos> Gentlemen - excuse me - may I talk to you for a second?
We can all agree that he was on his way to the Hall of Fame without that one shot.<eos> Hey, isn't that you?<eos> (PA) Ladies and gentlemen, Better America and Claremont Media take great pleasure in presenting to you the Omaha lce Breakers!<eos> What do you think?<eos> I haven't seen this many wings since we sponsored Thanksgiving.<eos> Wait.<eos> There's something wrong with the American flag.<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, it doesn't have any wings on it.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
-Unless I die.<eos> -There's no chance of that now.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Does that matter?<eos> -I'm making you immortal.<eos> -No!<eos> You're forcing your will on me because you think you know better.<eos> Your father would be proud.<eos> Judith wants to see you.
I'm seldom wrong as a judge of character.<eos> Have your friendly constable on hand to make the appropriate arrests.<eos> Your terrible ordeal is as good as over.<eos> I'll get there before you.<eos> We have to move quickly.<eos> They were packing to leave.<eos> What kind of horrible people must these kidnappers be?<eos> There is evil in the world, Mr. Foster.<eos> There aren't fences high enough to keep it out.<eos> Bring your men directly to my house. I'm going with you.
My dear, sweet Winnie.<eos> What I wouldn't do to keep you.<eos> I wish you were ours... for Jesse. For all of us.<eos> You have to hurry and get away from here.<eos> Winnie... Winnie, come with me.<eos> There's nothing for you here.<eos> We can be together forever.<eos> If she comes with us, they'll hunt us down.<eos> They'll never stop looking. Tuck is right.<eos> If I go with you it'll be too dangerous for all of you.
Sorry.<eos> Women, eh?<eos> Alex and I didn't have a great night.<eos> What happened yesterday?<eos> Nothing really.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Nothing what?<eos> I don't think this is the right moment.<eos> Since it was just between Alex and me.<eos> This agrument had nothing to do with you.
I'm in.<eos> Greer?<eos> What do you say?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, Ferriman!<eos> So this is the way it works. 1 0% instead of your 20% finder's fee.<eos> I can't let you take advantage of me like that.<eos> That's the way it is.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> Fine. But I go with you.

But I go with you.<eos> Not on my boat, you don't.<eos> Think I'd tell you where a fortune might be without insurance?<eos> There are five other boats that would jump at this.<eos> I come with you.
This is an apartment I'm borrowing... till this creep goes down in flames.<eos> I keep copies of the evidence so I can work on it at night.<eos> Make sure you can read the name on that building.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, I got enough.<eos> Just remember, I scratch your back, you scratch mine.<eos> If my story draws the Fairy in an attack on Graham... and you nail the scumbag, I get an exclusive.<eos> Fuck you, Lounds.<eos> When we see the story, we'll consider what to do... about your sealed indictment.<eos> All right, it was a pleasure doing business with you, chumps.
But there was no offer.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> She wants us to come out and this is the first step.<eos> Making us doubt each other.<eos> And it worked, because I don't understand anything.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> They offered Julián a solution and he kept it quiet.<eos> Julián, please, say it isn't true.<eos> You spoke to them and didn't tell us anything?<eos> It didn't concern you.
I told you yesterday.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> Is this yours?<eos> But my father did say this: It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.<eos> He wouldn't tell me who opened it.<eos> Only that they were expelled.<eos> The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.<eos> So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.<eos> As for me I hope it's Granger.<eos> What's the matter with you two?
Ready, hike!<eos> I've got the ball.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Who's gonna stop me?<eos> Come on!<eos> This is a lot of fun!<eos> Oh, so sorry!<eos> Come here!<eos> Stop!<eos> Slow down when I'm talking to you!
All right, there. okay.<eos> Go ahead. open the box.<eos> - I can't!<eos> - Yes, you can!<eos> - open the box.<eos> - open it!<eos> It's so beautiful!<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> Mom!<eos> That's why people don't go out with you.
- My hair!<eos> - Careful! That's my overpriced Italian belt.<eos> Just get it off!<eos> Howard.<eos> Join us. We were just brainstorming.<eos> - Yes. I was thinking it might be a good idea to do a photo op at the build site where George would be in the...<eos> George in the foreground, pointing up to the sky like this.<eos> - Yes. Then I thought I could take my belt off, as if to say, let's get to work!<eos> Right. Right-o.<eos> On behalf of Wade Corporation, I'd like to thank the Community Board for giving us the opportunity to work with you on this project.
It's for their own protection.<eos> If they leave, Saddam's men could kidnap them and use them as human shields... at potential bombing sites.<eos> -Ready?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> In here.<eos> -How you doing?<eos> -Who the hell are you?<eos> How you doing?<eos> CNN.<eos> We're going to talk to you.
-Heard that before.<eos> It's important the American public realizes you're being held hostage here.<eos> What do you think I'II do?<eos> Put you on camera... and ask you if you'd Iike to see Saddam being violated by a camel?<eos> Who let you guys in here?<eos> Hi. We're from CNN.<eos> -We were gonna do some interviews.<eos> -Like hell you are!<eos> Leave us alone and get out.<eos> None of us want anything to do with you.
I've mastered the art.<eos> I am ready. I just went in , and I looked at the stage.<eos> It's like it's a woman .<eos> I just want to mount it. I just wanna get on that stage and destroy.<eos> Mr. Orny Adams, everybody.<eos> Let me just give a little advice to the industry.<eos> Stretch before I go up on stage.<eos> 'Cause when you come running after me, I don't want you to pull a muscle or something .<eos> Last year, I thought I had lupus.<eos> Has that happened to you yet?
Orny...<eos> This is so exciting .<eos> I'm happy to be here.<eos> Last year I thought I had psoriasis.<eos> Has that happened to you yet?<eos> I was on a bus and there was an ad --<eos> Chances are that somebody on the bus had psoriasis.<eos> I look around , and I'm the only one on the bus.<eos> "Looks like I better get to the hospital -- l have psoriasis."<eos> I got to be honest with you . l-l feel off.
My thoughts exactly.<eos> Guess you know Jack just about as well as I do, huh?<eos> I'm sending someone to your house to pick up some clean clothes.<eos> What's gonna happen when we get released from here?<eos> Why can't we just go home?<eos> Until we know exactly what happened, we'll take every precaution to keep you safe.<eos> When do we get to see my dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A lot of things have to happen first.<eos> Some people will wanna talk to you.
They even bragged about it.<eos> Well, only six of the 12 left behind their epithelials when their skin made contact with the vic's clothing.<eos> I've got no physical evidence to tie the others to the crime.<eos> The mob mentality... relieves individuals from having to distinguish between right and wrong.<eos> Anonymity shields them from prosecution though.<eos> Yeah, six of them, to be exact.<eos> Unfortunately, physical evidence is limited by human action.<eos> Well, nothing's absolute, Gil... even forensics.<eos> Yeah, well... this is as far as we can take it.<eos> It's up to you guys.
I like his movies.<eos> Some of them are good.<eos> D.A. Just got the call.<eos> Tom's manager hired Marjorie Wescott to defend him.<eos> "Sound Bite" Wescott?<eos> Guilty, rich client, high-profile case... it's right up her alley.<eos> Publicity for her new cable show.<eos> Forget about who's involved.<eos> We do this like we do any other case.<eos> I'm going to get this blood evidence to DNA. I'll catch up with you guys later. All right.
We gotta get to Ludlow before The Source does.<eos> So, Cole, fix Phoebe.<eos> I don't care how but just do it.<eos> She needs to write a spell.<eos> - Which spell?<eos> - A power-of-three spell, in case Leo and I have no choice but to lure Ludlow back here.<eos> Biscuits are ready.<eos> We'll need some proof for Ludlow that we actually have Tyler.<eos> - We're gonna take his jacket.<eos> - Why can't I come with you?
Avatars of what?<eos> Force and power.<eos> And we don't have to limit ourselves to choosing between good and evil.<eos> We can drive them both.<eos> What's that got to do with me?<eos> We are only a few.<eos> But we are preparing to wield a power, the likes of which this world has never seen.<eos> And we want you to be a part of it.<eos> Let me make myself clear.<eos> I want nothing to do with you.
- Do you think a demon...?<eos> I mean, I can still cast spells and I still have the power of three thing.<eos> Whatever the problem is, it seems more natural than supernatural.<eos> Phoebe, why didn't you come to me?<eos> I'm your whitelighter.<eos> Well, because you've been very busy.<eos> - I've been busy? - Okay.<eos> Well, I've been busy.<eos> My work schedule's been really hectic.<eos> But I'm coming to you guys now.
I know, I know.<eos> I can't.<eos> Sorry, but I've already booked you.<eos> - Can't what?<eos> - I'm swamped.<eos> Swamped?<eos> But, Phoebe, we have to find this demon and stop him.<eos> - Price of success, kiddo.<eos> - Phoebe, hello?<eos> I will meet you at home and we'll get right on it.
Keep it.<eos> You know, maybe we should go see Phoebe.<eos> She didn't look so well.<eos> Paige, we'll go over there after we destroy this book.<eos> I think you're being hasty.<eos> The Grimoire could bring us great powers.<eos> Listen, we already have powers.<eos> We don't need evil ones too.<eos> - Phoebe?<eos> - I have to talk to you guys.
The jackpot?<eos> Thirty million dollars.<eos> And that's when the vultures descended.<eos> But unfortunately, Barney didn't want to share with his loving family, did he?<eos> Mmm-mmm. So he did the only thing he could to protect his winnings.<eos> He put the ticket in a bag, and he swallowed it.<eos> The next morning, he would take a bus to the lottery office in Braintree,<eos> deposit his hidden booty in the loo, and cash out.<eos> Unfortunately, his ticker gave out and the poor guy died en route.<eos> All right, we'll cut you in.
I think you gonna give me a little one-on-one time with the missus.<eos> Oh, I think you might want to reconsider that last part.<eos> See, I married me a powerful ugly creature.<eos> How can you say that? How can you shame me in front of new people?<eos> If I couId make you prettier, I would.<eos> You are not the man I met a year ago.<eos> Now, think real hard.<eos> You been bird-dogging this township a while now.<eos> They wouldn't mind a corpse of you.<eos> Now, you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell... ... butifyourhandtouchesmetal ... ... Iswearby my prettyfloralbonnet, I will end you.

We do have sit-down meals-- next one being at about 1 800.<eos> I think Shepherd Book has offered to help me prepare something. You're a shepherd?<eos> I thought the outfit gave it away.<eos> It's not a problem... 'cause it's not.<eos> No.<eos> As I said... you're welcome to visit the dining area anytime.<eos> Apart from that, I have to ask you to stay in the passenger dorm while we're in the air.<eos> The bridge, engine room, cargo bay-- they're all off-limits without an escort. Some of my personal effects are in the cargo bay.<eos> I figure you all got luggage you're gonna need.<eos> Soon as we're done here, we'll be happy to fetch 'em with you.
- Is this your first?<eos> - It is.<eos> Well, little Jamie here is our third.<eos> So if you have any questions, just holler.<eos> - That's so sweet.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Let me give you guys some privacy.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
- The scary pigeon's back?<eos> It's huge.<eos> I can't believe you live in that building.<eos> My grandmother lives in that building!<eos> Ida Greene? No sense of personal space.. kind of smells like chicken, looks like a potato.<eos> - "Spuds" is your grandmother?<eos> - That's my bubbe!<eos> So we're on our way to a couple of parties.<eos> Maybe we could get your numbers and call if we find something fun?<eos> Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really looking for anything to happen.. with you guys.
I'm fine, but someone make sure it's gone when I get out?<eos> I'm on it!<eos> I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.<eos> -lt could happen to anyone.<eos> -Not to you.<eos> You know this stuff.<eos> I don't know any of it and I'm the father.<eos> I wish I could be more involved, you know?<eos> Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?
So?<eos> It took her two weeks to replace the check.<eos> So?<eos> When Sally attended the next DAR meeting, she was served the last cup of tea.<eos> So?<eos> Before this unfortunate incident, Sally Wallington always received the first cup of tea.<eos> When she was suddenly demoted, your mother moved up to the prime tea spot, and she's held that spot ever since.<eos> Now, she's very proud of that spot, and now she's afraid that this little incident may jeopardize it.<eos> Dad, I explained this to Mom and I'll explain it to you.<eos> I'm not sixteen, I don't live with you anymore, I've been making my own decisions, romantic and otherwise, for a long time now and you can play all the golf you want but the subject better
Now, if I was there, he wouldn't be in this situation.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> These are violent men.<eos> And violent men only understand one thing.<eos> Only another violent man could make that assumption.<eos> Are you a violent man, kurdy?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> When I have to be.<eos> Look, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry. Let me take care of this and I'll catch up with you...
We found this.<eos> Whoever took her must have dropped it when they lifted her out of there.<eos> Joint.<eos> Where would you get weed around here?<eos> All sorts of people growing' it.<eos> What about hemp papers?<eos> Wait, of course.<eos> A girl named chapelle, she deals out of a vagrant camp west of gramercy, she was through here trying to trade pre-rolled for some garden tools.<eos> Hmm, you think you could give us directions?<eos> I'll come with you.
Because it was discovered by John Langden Down.<eos> Well, he's done a lot of damage.<eos> The first exercise is to cope with everyday situations like shopping.<eos> Dave, you can't see, speak or hear.<eos> Go and buy a cream cake.<eos> You want me to bump into things and make a dick of myself?<eos> Partly.<eos> Go with the flow.<eos> Stop blocking the improv.<eos> - You're not taking me in?
Good.<eos> That's good. Okay, take your time.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll pay extra. Whatever it takes.<eos> Don't you worry, partner.<eos> They're a team of experts.<eos> I'm going downstairs to look for the stiff.<eos> Good luck, ladies.<eos> Good luck, ladies.<eos> And God be with you.
The guy... The guy who shot Teal.<eos> Archie Modine.<eos> They were in the same fraternity.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> They knew each other.<eos> This was a lot more enjoyable when I was on that side of the table.<eos> Oh, you're on the right side of the table, Modine.<eos> Look, Captain, I'm not lawyering up here, am I?<eos> I'm talking to you.
- You guys are unbelievable.<eos> - Thank you, baby.<eos> - Not the good kind.<eos> - I know.<eos> You claim you want more responsibility, but you're being outsmarted by a doctor with scrubs made of hemp.<eos> You're afraid to stand up to a volunteer who's answering the phones.<eos> And did you ever place that femoral swan?<eos> It's on my to-do list.<eos> I know you were hoping Officer Berson's vitals would go up or down and this decision would be made for you, but nothing's changed.<eos> So it's on you.
I got fresh meat.<eos> This here's Terry.<eos> Comes to us from Robbery.<eos> Robbery?<eos> You mean like the fag squad, man?<eos> We ran out of fresh asses, so I figured I'd try you prom queens on for size.<eos> Hey, if you' re looking for fresh asses, I'd cross Shane off your list.<eos> Oh, stop it, mister.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Looks like it's gonna be a blast with you guys.
Any bushes you can beat?<eos> Looks like we've been invited to the party, ladies.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, I hear it's your birthday.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Hang on a second.<eos> - I need to ask Shane a few questions.<eos> - Me?<eos> - I need 10 minutes.<eos> I'll send him to catch up with you.
You seeing this?<eos> - Goddamn Oprah Winfrey hour.<eos> - Paging Dr. Phil.<eos> No wonder Gilroy called us up.<eos> A gang war's about to explode and he's playing grief counselor to the soldiers.<eos> You gotta let me handle this, Train, me entiendes?<eos> He's right.<eos> We'll handle it.<eos> I'm working this case with Carlos.<eos> Who would wanna start a war with you?
- Hi.<eos> - Hey, Clark. Is your mom around?<eos> - I wanted to order more of her pies.<eos> - She's in class, I can help you.<eos> I thought you'd be helping Chloe proof the latest edition.<eos> - She had enough help.<eos> - Are you two still fighting?<eos> Who said we were fighting?<eos> Kind of caught it yesterday at the career fair.<eos> What's going on with you two?
Your Honor, the defense requests a conference in chambers.<eos> We'll stand in recess for 15 minutes while the court confers with counsel in chambers.<eos> - Bailiff, will you escort the jury out.<eos> - Did Julie say anything to you about this?<eos> What we saw in that courtroom is a transparent attempt by Richard Cross to subvert the intent of the marital privilege.<eos> Hey, she's his wife.<eos> Where are my pants?<eos> Some mouthwash and shit in the back.<eos> We'll go get breakfast.<eos> Oh, aspetta, I'll go with you.
Gibson and Finney are checking the food supply. It doesn't look good.<eos> Based on our time spent in hyperspace, we're at least 1200 light years from Earth.<eos> How does that help us?<eos> It doesn't.<eos> Colonel.<eos> It's the Asgard.<eos> Thor, buddy!<eos> Nice timing.<eos> It has been some time, O'Neill.<eos> I owe you all a debt of gratitude for rescuing me from my Goa'uld captors.
Maybe you can recommend some related reading.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll type up a list.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, Major... I'm as physically fit as anybody on this base, and I've committed to memory almost all of Dr Jackson's work.<eos> Everything?<eos> According to the tests, I am able to learn much quicker than the average human.<eos> All very interesting, but...<eos> I wanna join you, explore other planets, discover new worlds, new cultures, help rid the galaxy of the Goa'uld.
- Are you saying it absolutely won't work?<eos> What I'm saying, sir, is that we have no idea how much EM would be required to knock this out.<eos> So let's all just go home.<eos> - How long will it take to set up?<eos> - Four hours, tops.<eos> That's how long you have to come up with a better idea.<eos> I have tried to connect to this world twice.<eos> It is the only one which I cannot contact.<eos> Then we must hope that is the location of the weapon.<eos> I'm coming with you.
All right, I'll talk to them.<eos> - We weren't expecting you this evening.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> This isn't a very good time to be taking risks.<eos> Some members of the government are beginning to question your loyalty.<eos> - They've been watching you.<eos> - I wasn't followed.<eos> Is this about the delegation from Earth? Yes.<eos> They want to meet with you.
Coombs, talk to me. OK.<eos> Hang another left, and then two rights.<eos> And then there'll be a door, and beyond that is daylight.<eos> Felger?<eos> - Coombs?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> This coding is very confusing.<eos> Just wait a second.<eos> What?<eos> I can't believe that I'm here... with you.. like this.
I'm on with the Russians.<eos> - Good morning, I'm Sam Seaborn.<eos> - Nickolai lvanovich.<eos> - George Kowzlowski.<eos> - Thanks for coming by.<eos> This should be quick.<eos> Let me say that President Bartlet looks forward to meeting President Chigorin and having a productive meeting.<eos> Mr. Seaborn, we understood that the protocol arrangements had been finalized by the advance teams in Helsinki.<eos> That's right, but there are points I'd like to revisit.<eos> My thinking being I could relay my concerns to you at the embassy.
- Why?<eos> - We were asked to.<eos> Mrs. Bartlet likes shrimp.<eos> That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.<eos> - Put whatever you want on the menu.<eos> - Very well.<eos> And I'd like to request that the press pool be allowed to photograph the Arctic Peoples' exhibit.<eos> Also very well.<eos> And that, my good friends, is that.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you.
Is that obstruction?<eos> No.<eos> That was frustration.<eos> Think he's being truthful about Anwar?<eos> I think he believes what he's saying.<eos> Whether it's the truth or not is another story.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> You're with the FBI, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> I need to talk to you.
- No.<eos> Samantha and I are headed over to the group home to speak to William's sister.<eos> - See if she knows anything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Growing up here, I don't even know how these kids have a chance.<eos> What's that, your liberal conscience talking?<eos> That's my heart talking.<eos> Where's yours?<eos> Been broken too many times.<eos> I'm sorry, she's in no condition to talk to you now.
Here's a guy whose name comes up in connection... with racketeering, prostitution, drugs, even murder... yet all he's got are nickel and dime convictions.<eos> Always gets off with just a slap on the wrist.<eos> You know as well as I do mob cases are hard to build.<eos> What I'm saying is... I don't think anyone's even trying.<eos> I think this guy Regali's greasing somebody.<eos> As in bribery?<eos> What else could it be?<eos> What? What is it?<eos> Agents.<eos> I was just coming to see you.
Put your gun away, Ray.<eos> You don't wanna do this.<eos> - Put the gun away!<eos> - No, I don't think so.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> All right, everybody, get over in that corner.<eos> You stay away from the windows.<eos> Sit down on the floor where I can see you.<eos> Come on!<eos> I'll shoot the new boy first, then I'll start in on the rest of you.
Get him out of here!<eos> Let's up and go!<eos> Doc, we've gotta move now, Doc. Come on, let's go!<eos> Doc, now, let's go!<eos> Move! Let's go!<eos> Fall back!<eos> We couldn't get to him, Captain.<eos> We tried. Babe tried.<eos> We couldn't get to him.<eos> Let me sit in here with you guys.
You almost became the ditch party.<eos> -Where your cousins from?<eos> -Hillside Trece!<eos> -Remember that!<eos> -Tell your cousins to get your back.<eos> Grab your bag and go home now.<eos> -No!<eos> I need a statement--<eos> -Don't need no statement.<eos> -They'll fuck you up.
is that understood?<eos> Bloody farmers!<eos> Why are you worried?<eos> Our game is improving day by day.<eos> Goli, you throw the ball with a lot of passion.<eos> Why do you just stand there after hitting the ball, Arjan?<eos> You should run.<eos> When I saw you all playing together today I realized the wrong I'd done.<eos> I regret it very much.<eos> Can I play with you?
-What are you saying, Ismail?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Truly sorry, I swear.<eos> Okay, Lakha, you're in.<eos> But remember:<eos> It's a huge responsibility.<eos> For the whites, it's a game.<eos> But for us it's our life.<eos> Yes, Bhuvan.<eos> I am with you.
Without your heart, you cannot win.<eos> -But her eyes--<eos> -Concentrate.<eos> Tansy cakes!<eos> Count Adhemar sends word.<eos> He said he will win this tournament for you.<eos> He's won many.<eos> He wins them for himself and his own honor.<eos> It's nothing to say he wins them for me.<eos> He wishes to speak to you again.
-I won't compete in it.<eos> -It's your best.<eos> No.<eos> It's tournament champion or nothing at all.<eos> Ten florins.<eos> That should do.<eos> Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.<eos> Do you feel lucky?<eos> -Have you enough clothes?<eos> -Be gone. I'm done with you.
Hurry up. Keep moving !<eos> Get inside.<eos> That was weird.<eos> Mike?<eos> -Sorry, buddy.<eos> I hope that hurt, lizard boy.<eos> Great job, buddy.<eos> We lost him.<eos> Boo!<eos> Nice working with you.
Let's watch my favorite part again.<eos> I'll kidnap 1 .000 children before I let this company die.<eos> Take your hands off.<eos> You can't arrest me. I hope you're happy, Sullivan.<eos> You destroyed this company.<eos> Monsters, Incorporated is dead !<eos> Where will everyone get their scream?<eos> The energy crisis will only get worse because of you !<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Number one wants to talk to you.
I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, mate, do you want the gig, then?<eos> Look in the lens, guys.<eos> Go.<eos> Get in there more.<eos> Give me attitude.<eos> Two double-platinum records.<eos> You're playing the Forum.<eos> You got 20 girls who want to be with you.
This city is Stalingrad.<eos> Stalingrad!<eos> This city bears the name of the boss.<eos> It's more than a city, it's a symbol.<eos> If the Germans capture this city, the entire country will collapse.<eos> I want our boys to raise their heads.<eos> I want them to act like they have balls.<eos> I want them to stop shitting their pants.<eos> That's your job<eos> As political officers, I'm counting on you.
I did go back. I went back to tell those guys to leave you alone.<eos> Yeah, but I saw him at school with you.<eos> You're paranoid. You're hallucinating.<eos> And I saw you with Raven that day at school and...<eos> That 's it, okay?<eos> We've got to get you out of here.<eos> We'll hop in the car, drive you to your folks. We'll drive all night.<eos> No.<eos> Come on! We'll make a little road trip out of it. It will be fun.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
The suspect appears to be holding a young boy hostage.<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Put the bomb down!<eos> What?<eos> That's not a bomb. That's a cat.<eos> Ah, see, just like at home.<eos> The policeman is your friend.<eos> They're here to help us.<eos> That's not a cat. That's a skunk.<eos> - You can take it from here, guys.
Stay calm. Get back, get back!<eos> Don't move.<eos> What the f...? Give me those.<eos> Back!<eos> Back, back.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Get in!<eos> OK. Is that my...? Is that my jacket?<eos> Put it in the car!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
There will be more.<eos> It's only a question of time.<eos> So don't make any plans.<eos> After the war, I'll leave it with you.<eos> You're very sweet.<eos> The Allies have landed in Italy.<eos> We can all go home then.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You really want this war to be over?<eos> What is wrong with you Italians?
Dude.<eos> Hi, coach.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Retrial.<eos> Got a judge that's a sports fan.<eos> -Congrats.<eos> -What will you do now?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Need a place to crash, figure out my next move.<eos> I knew I could count on you.
- I think he's about to say something.<eos> Bring me a bone.<eos> And a large order of ﬂies.<eos> Supersized.<eos> You will be bring me ham, luncheon meats, cold cuts.<eos> - Lucky, out.<eos> - Maya, can I talk to Charisse alone a second?<eos> OK. Come on, boy.<eos> Charisse, look, I'm sorry about tonight.<eos> I'm thinking about cutting back a bit and spending more time around here with you.
30 seconds.<eos> Could a pinch knock out the power of an entire city?<eos> - Like, for instance...<eos> Yeah, I think it might.<eos> There's only one pinch big enough to do it.<eos> Where?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yen, Basher, come on.<eos> Where you going?<eos> - I'm coming with you.
Hey Bobby, I'm Heather's girl.. boyfreind...<eos> Hey Bobby, I'm Donny, this is Heather.<eos> I'm her boyfriend.<eos> Thats good? - Yeah.<eos> I think we'd go out to west town, and mess around and dug out my five point-o or some shit.<eos> I'll give these two a ride back.<eos> Wait a second. You're not comin?<eos> - No, I'm fuckin worked.<eos> What about her?<eos> I'm coming with you.
What's its name?<eos> - Heaven's Mouth.<eos> Heaven's Mouth, sure.<eos> - It's wonderful!<eos> - A paradise!<eos> Practically heaven made sea.<eos> A bite of heaven, on earth. A paradise on earth, with roots...<eos> - You could come with us Yeah, come with us!<eos> Me?<eos> - Would you take me with you?
He escaped, sir.<eos> Who is D'Artagnan?<eos> Whose throat do I have to cut now?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Perhaps a little boy?<eos> I know.<eos> A little boy and a nun.<eos> Prepare DuChamps castle for hell.<eos> I have business in Paris.<eos> I'll be with you soon.
That's his only daughter.<eos> She loves him.<eos> She used to fish with him!<eos> She bought him a necklace.<eos> She loves him! You son of a bitch!<eos> - Get the hell out!<eos> - She loves him!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Have some respect for your job!<eos> What's wrong with you people?
We'll each say our own.<eos> Get in.<eos> To make it by sundown, we must go now.<eos> Make it where?<eos> There is a family that wants to hear the Gospel.<eos> We have an errand from the Lord.<eos> Get in.<eos> Stay the night there.<eos> We will have wind by the morning.<eos> Take this with you.
Perhaps not by the Visigoths.<eos> A Roman general has better things to do than mutilate corpses.<eos> You've grown soft.<eos> The Huns I knew would avenge such an insult.<eos> I came to offer an alliance.<eos> I'll march against the Visigoths alone.<eos> Flavius!<eos> We, uh, divide the spoils equally?<eos> Of course.<eos> We'll join you.
"I hereby charge you with making all preparations...<eos> "...in regard to organizational and financial matters...<eos> "...for bringing about a complete solution of the Jewish question...<eos> "...in the German sphere of influence in Europe."<eos> Now, for that, I read the cleansing of the entire continent of Europe.<eos> You see, the word "cleansing"...<eos> An accurate word, I think.<eos> If I may go on in the second paragraph:<eos> "Wherever other governmental agencies are involved...<eos> "...these are to cooperate with you..." I hope. So on, so on.
It's nothing.<eos> - Are you feeling better, Sire?<eos> - I'm well, thank you.<eos> We must talk.<eos> Come in.<eos> You dare to come here, and instead of reproaching you I'm trembling with joy.<eos> I bring a message from the Queen.<eos> She's waiting for you.<eos> She wants to make you jealous.<eos> I am already jealous, but of her, because she has more time with you than I.
The King loves me, and I love the King.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Kneel down before the Queen of Castile!<eos> - Kneel!<eos> - The King hates you and loves me!<eos> I'll only kneel before him.<eos> I'm dreaming.<eos> What is this slut saying?<eos> I believe she is defying me.<eos> The King enjoys me, not you.
You know the sad reason why we are gathered here.<eos> The Queen is demented, and is thus unfit to govern.<eos> We can extend her life only by keeping her in close confinement.<eos> Are you ready, my lords, to announce publicly that Queen Joan is mad,<eos> to recognize me as the only legitimate sovereign of Castile, and, should my enemies foment disturbance in the kingdom,<eos> We shall all do what Your Highness wishes for the good of Castile.<eos> All of us.<eos> Is that not so, my lords?<eos> - Aye!<eos> Are you going to allow them to toy with you?
I know everybody.<eos> Well, almost everybody.<eos> -We ain't open yet.<eos> -I'm not hungry.<eos> I saw you through the window.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened in my office.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Friends?<eos> His dad don't want him talking to strangers.<eos> He's talking to you, isn't he?
I couldn't do that.<eos> Take his trousers off.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Who is it?<eos> - Oh, I'm ever so sorry, sir.<eos> - Sorry for what?<eos> I'm supposed to get the fire lit without waking you.<eos> Why does everyone treat me as if I were one of these stupid snobs?<eos> I spent half the week downstairs with all of you.
Iris, you've got bicycle oil on your ankle.<eos> I don't care, John.<eos> Those of you, our guests on whose magnificent generosity we depend we really are most frightfully grateful will need no introduction to one of our most distinguished graduates and an honorary fellow, Dame Iris Murdoch.<eos> She's a noted philosopher, as well as author of some twenty-six novels.<eos> And we are honoured to have her with us today.<eos> As well as the distinguished Warton Professor of Literature who has the great good fortune of being married to her.<eos> I need say no more about her.<eos> For good wine needs no bush.<eos> But she will not mind comparison with say, a really fine vintage claret.<eos> Dame Iris will speak to you about the importance of education.
I'll be expecting your call.<eos> Idiot!<eos> - Get back in. - What for?<eos> We must leave.<eos> - What? - They 're leaving.<eos> - You come back?<eos> - My boss say we must leave.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll try to come back.<eos> Thank God we can count on you!
If you want, I take you with me.<eos> - What?<eos> - We can go with him.<eos> Really?<eos> Thank him nicely and tell him he can fuck off!<eos> - Tchiki, go!<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Go and bring back help.<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> I'll come with you.
Didn't even bother to remove the plates from the vehicle.<eos> That's pretty sloppy.<eos> Now, the local cops have his apartment staked out.<eos> He knows that we made him, since he abandoned his vehicle.<eos> So chances are that he returns there are pretty slim.<eos> All we can do is sit and wait.<eos> I hate to mention this under the circumstances, sir, but I do have that doctor's appointment.<eos> Absolutely, Simmons.<eos> You've done enough for one day.<eos> I mean, if that's all right with you guys.
But I never did wonder.<eos> Never give it much thought.<eos> You just live from day to day.<eos> Keep your fingers crossed, and that was it.<eos> I have the honor to present the supreme commander, Gen, Eisenhower,<eos> It is a great personal honor for me to be here today, To take part in a ceremony that is unique in American history,<eos> Never before has a full division, ,been cited by the War Department, ,in the name of the president for gallantry in action,<eos> This day marks the beginning of a new tradition, ,in the American Army,<eos> With that tradition will always be associated the name, , of the 101st Airborne Division and of Bastogne,<eos> Good luck and God be with each of you,
She's an expert in local medicines and speaks the Indian dialect.<eos> Taking a woman on an expedition is a bad idea.<eos> Men can rub along and rough it together.<eos> Women have different needs.<eos> She's lived here all her life.<eos> She'll be less of a liability than Mr Malone.<eos> - I agree with Lord Roxton.<eos> - So do I. We're entering into the unknown.<eos> It's no place for women.<eos> My niece tells me she has offered to go with you on your expedition.
Look at all this stuff.<eos> This is ludicrous! How far can we go without bearers?<eos> As far as we have to.<eos> Quiet.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> Uncle?<eos> You people have been making good time.<eos> I've been tracking you for days.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I wanted to join you, but perhaps it's too late.
I guess now would be a bad time to give him some bad news.<eos> Bad news?<eos> See for yourself.<eos> That is bad.<eos> So, care to tell us the name of your girlfriend back there?<eos> If you must know, he goes by the name of "Reaper".<eos> Bounty hunters, so unimaginative.<eos> So there's a price on your head.<eos> Oh, good. Maybe I'll get my money back after all.<eos> If I were you, I'd spend less time trying to plot MY downfall and more time trying to guess what I'm going to do with the two of you.
The guy always shows up!<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> Homicide.<eos> Look, I was just doing my job.<eos> Hey, treating another human being like garbage is not a job.<eos> It's a choice.<eos> Paperwork.<eos> Later.<eos> Dennis?<eos> I need to talk to you.
They had a warrant.<eos> I didn't wanna bother you at work.<eos> This qualifies as a harassment suit.<eos> Too late.<eos> - Grains of golden sand.<eos> - What?<eos> Edgar Allan Poe.<eos> Another man who was familiar with murder.<eos> Played in any sandboxes lately, Mr Nelson?<eos> As my husband's attorney, I'm advising him not to speak with you.
Bring together my prince and me Let him fall on bended knee<eos> I summon him to my side<eos> That he may take me to be His destined bride.<eos> My love.<eos> I am forever yours.<eos> As will be your kingdom, once I conceive an heir.<eos> All right, calm down.<eos> At least I knocked.<eos> - Hey, Paige.<eos> - I'm not here to talk to either of you.
- Yeah?<eos> - Thank you, dear, for asking.<eos> Is her hip any better?<eos> Jake and Carol Grisanti for Mr. Cowan?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll let him know you're here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Say that again.<eos> I got distracted.<eos> He'll be with you in a few minutes.
That's it.<eos> Hey, Bug, hand me that marker.<eos> Want to share with the class?<eos> Munson put the gun to his temple, fired. Bullet came out the other side, creating the spatter on the opposite wall.<eos> Spatter on this wall is from the blowback, blood from the entry wound.<eos> But for some reason, there should be blood here, here and here.<eos> But there isn't.<eos> Someone was standing here.<eos> Forgot something inside. We, uh...<eos> We'll catch up with you later.
Okay, thanks for the tip.<eos> That guy, his name wasn't Munson. It was Sergei.<eos> He was one of them.<eos> One of who?<eos> One of them.<eos> Tax cheat, my ass.<eos> Hi, Jordan.<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> Not really.<eos> Look, I know about Sergei, but I don't know what he has to do with you.
Look, I love you, dude.<eos> I'm not even gonna talk about this.<eos> This little "thing" is over.<eos> I know you have a girlfriend. And I know about the other professors.<eos> How do you think that makes me feel?<eos> You used me!<eos> You don't love me and you never did!<eos> Professor Winston.<eos> Professor Frederickson.<eos> I'll be right with you.
-I Iike this place.<eos> And technically, I'm not breaking any rules, so....<eos> well, Ross, this is Joey.<eos> Joey, Ross. -Hi.<eos> -Hi.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> I used to have a friend named Joey.<eos> I don't anymore.<eos> Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.<eos> Sure, I would love to wait with you guys!
Mona is totally freaked out!<eos> I'll fix that too.<eos> What's her e-mail?<eos> I'll fix this.<eos> I swear I'll talk to her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> You call that a fight?<eos> "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?
'Early morning nature walk: 7:30, regional history talk: 8:15... '<eos> We're in luck.<eos> Breakfast just ended.<eos> The arts-and-crafts workshop begins in 13 minutes.<eos> - A window.<eos> - Must be when they shower.<eos> Grab your bag!<eos> Go.<eos> Hello, strangers.<eos> We've all been so worried about you two.
- You're horrible.<eos> Honey, we don't even know if she's on the market.<eos> I'm not on the market.<eos> I'm definitely off the market.<eos> - She has a boyfriend.<eos> - Isn't that cute?<eos> Mom, I saved you a scone.<eos> You love me, right?<eos> Sorry, everybody, I'm gonna have to drag her away now.<eos> - It was so nice talking to you.
You said you were drinking margaritas at the bar.<eos> You ever leave your drink unattended?<eos> Joe and I got up to dance, and I went to the restroom once.<eos> But both times, I left my glass on the table with everybody else's.<eos> How'd you feel when you left?<eos> Fine, I guess.<eos> You go straight to the frat house?<eos> Had a beer there?<eos> They kept pouring more into my glass. But, that's when I started to feel dizzy, so I stopped.<eos> Did anybody else join you at the frat, once you got to Joe's room?
Get a move, get a move.<eos> Our powers don't work on these!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You're welcome to try!<eos> Okay, what now?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Um, they're just uh, you know...they're uh, they're taking a break!<eos> Break? !<eos> You know there's not that much air down here.<eos> Okay, um, we're... we're just gonna have to get back to you.
- He killed you? MICHAEL:<eos> Yeah.<eos> We don't remember a lot.<eos> In our other life, Kivar was our enemy.<eos> He was trying to take over my throne.<eos> Isabel fell in love with him and helped him overtake us.<eos> There was a bloodbath.<eos> We were all killed, including Isabel.<eos> Our genetic material was mixed with human DNA, then we were sent here.<eos> Nothing's ever simple with you is it?
- Wanna put down those shears first?<eos> I don't wanna lose you, Jesse.<eos> Isabel, you broke up with me.<eos> I know.<eos> Maybe we should go out to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> Dinner?<eos> I think we both need to lay our cards on the table.<eos> MICHAEL:<eos> Come in, it's open.<eos> I need to talk to you guys.
- I got the tryout with Kansas State.<eos> - That's incredible!<eos> Hey, congrats.<eos> I haven't said yes yet.<eos> They want me there on Saturday, your big night.<eos> It's Nell's big night.<eos> I was just telling Clark it wasn't important.<eos> Yeah, Scout's honor.<eos> I want you to go.<eos> Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later.
Neither of you ever got a passing grade on any geometry test and then the midterm.<eos> Sister Agnes shared these with me.<eos> Both of you got 96 percent correct.<eos> Remarkable.<eos> I'd like to call your parents and share the news.<eos> Oh, you really don't have to.<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> If you cooperate now, it'll be easier later.<eos> All we did was study hard.<eos> I don't have to waste my time with you.
- Carter.<eos> - Attempting engine start.<eos> Carter?<eos> That's got it, sir.<eos> We're good to go. I'll repair the remaining systems on the way.<eos> Once you get to the Revanna gate, dial the Alpha site.<eos> They're expecting you.<eos> I think I speak for about six billion people when I say "good luck".<eos> You too.<eos> - I'm gonna wanna talk to you guys.
Let's go.<eos> Hey, what the hell was that jacket business, man?<eos> Uh, you're making me look bad.<eos> Look, Kelso, you are my good, good friend... but I will stop at nothing to win Jackie... and if you're in my way, I will destroy you.<eos> This is nice, you coming home for lunch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good afternoon, sunshine.<eos> So, what have you got planned for today?<eos> Same as every day.<eos> Lie on the couch, do my nails, avoid talking to you.
For the son of this slave woman will not be heir with my son, Isaac."<eos> And so it began.<eos> The Jews, the sons of Isaac.<eos> The Arabs, the sons of Ishmael.<eos> But what most people find important to remember is that in the end the two sons came together to bury their father.<eos> I think most people also find it important to remember that the whole thing took place about 73 million years ago.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, we're clear.<eos> Well, that's that, then.<eos> It was good talking with you guys.
She doesn't even have one personality, let alone six or seven.<eos> Give me my frickin' paper, you hairy little thief!<eos> You think you're gonna get away with this, but you're not.<eos> I'm onto you!<eos> You're history!<eos> It's over!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Guys?<eos> What is wrong with you?
- I just told the chef to surprise me.<eos> Think that was a mistake in a place that's located next to a pet hospital?<eos> Grace, hi.<eos> You gonna-<eos> - Grace?<eos> Hang on.<eos> What- - What are you doing?<eos> You gonna join us?<eos> No.<eos> I thought about it, and I cannot, in good conscience, have dinner with you two.
Duck season/rabbit season?<eos> Oh, look out, look out.<eos> Raymond?<eos> - Raymond?<eos> - What?<eos> So you're fine with them painting your house?<eos> It's Saturday.<eos> All right!<eos> Sorry, kids.<eos> Guess Daddy isn't going to be able to spend any more quality time with you.
I don't know the details yet, but I got a report from an insider.<eos> The freaks are attacking there.<eos> I guess the greedy fish took the bait.<eos> That place is a castle with a bloody, deep-seated grudge.<eos> Go and sacrifice the freaks' blood to Henry the Sixth.<eos> What is the situation on the security here?<eos> Secret Service will be arriving here soon.<eos> Our enemy is a single division of former SAS troops.<eos> We should use all our forces, Commanding Officer Fargason!<eos> May the grace of God and Her Majesty, the Queen, be with you.
Nine, eleven, twenty...<eos> Chuckie!<eos> You're not supposed to look at your feet when you're dancing.<eos> But I gots to, susie.<eos> They just keep getting all tanglied up.<eos> Faster, Phillip!<eos> We gots to get to the peoples on top.<eos> - I gots dibs on the feets.<eos> - Phil, lil...<eos> The bobfather wants to see you now.
-Saying "shit" forty times... isn't going to help you with your relationship with your son.<eos> Shit!<eos> This student, alone... has become the symbol for the forces of freedom... facing the forces of tyranny.<eos> Television stations from all over the world covered this event... but is this image, this single photography... which has become synonymous with the drama of that historic moment.<eos> Yeager Pollack was the man who captured that magic moment for us.<eos> Wait for it. Wait for it!<eos> And here tonight, to introduce him... his friend and colleague, Pulitzer Prize winner himself, 1 989...<eos> Newsweek's Harrison Lloyd.<eos> There are very few things that we can be absolutely certain of... and never call into question... no matter how many lives we live.<eos> And it is my pleasure, my supreme pleasure... my honor, and... to share one of those certainties with you tonight:
Doesn't that give you some inkling about what's going to happen here?<eos> I'm going anyway.<eos> You can't get in to Vukocar, man.<eos> Nobody gets in nobody gets out!<eos> All you can do in Vukovar is die.<eos> What the fuck do you know?<eos> Jumping out of an airplane.<eos> What you're fucking looking at me for?<eos> I'm trying to help you, guys!<eos> -What is this with you?
- Bummer.<eos> Hard.<eos> How about possible?<eos> It's possible.<eos> The realm of possibility exists where?<eos> In each of you.<eos> Here.<eos> So you can do it.<eos> You can surprise us.<eos> It's up to you.
In each of you.<eos> Here.<eos> So you can do it.<eos> You can surprise us.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Or you can just sit back and let it atrophy.<eos> Atrophy.<eos> If there is a word you hear that you don't understand, there's a dictionary.<eos> Look it up.<eos> And there are these dictionaries which you will carry at all times because in this class, we're going to Learn to Love words and their meanings.
It's important.<eos> - What did your cousin tell you ?<eos> - That I shouldn't come to Cinisi because tonight something was going to happen.<eos> - To whom ? - This is all he told me: that I should stay at home.<eos> - What should we do ?<eos> - Go get Salvo and check the alleyways by the airport.<eos> We'll go at Peppino's.<eos> - Vito, what's the matter ?<eos> - Is Peppino here ?<eos> - Isn't he with you guys ?
I got it!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You can't do anything right.<eos> Why do you have to mess everything up?<eos> - I got three words:<eos> Anger management.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Dude, we really need to find your car.<eos> Sorry about yanking you off the street like that.<eos> - We really need to talk to you.
Daddy hit her.<eos> Why did he hit her?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Is it because of us?<eos> Put it out of your mind.<eos> What's that?<eos> Because daddy died the insurance sends money.<eos> Naoki?<eos> It's Aunt Yoshiko, How are you?<eos> I've been so worried about you two.
Enough already...<eos> You're up early tomorrow.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I fixed your old bike.<eos> It's got a few good years left.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Remember me?<eos> I ran away from home.<eos> Can I stay here with you?
I should go to Hollywood.<eos> - I should do this for a living.<eos> - We must go back.<eos> Take whatever he gives you and consider yourself paid.<eos> No, you have to give me your part.<eos> You owe me 200.<eos> - I'll give you a hundred now...<eos> - Two hundred.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> I'd like to have a word with you.
I pulled out the plug and disconnected it.<eos> No, that's not the reason.<eos> I've been getting these nuisance calls.<eos> Makes you sick, doesn't it.<eos> It's OK.<eos> My cell phone still works.<eos> Mr Nogami?<eos> Oh, he's fine.<eos> Damn this fever!<eos> You guys aren't trying to take me with you, are you?
Leave me alone.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Commander!<eos> (Intercom beeps) 'The alien's escaped from security.'<eos> He's in assembly area D.<eos> Security, assembly area D.<eos> Alan.<eos> Use the kill ray.<eos> Please, I must... talk to you.
The last grave on the left.<eos> He's....<eos> The father's dead?<eos> Six months ago, a family came to Father Fredricks.<eos> Their daughter was possessed with a demon.<eos> A very powerful demon.<eos> Father Fredricks saved the young woman.<eos> But he couldn't save himself.<eos> It was an Ethros demon?<eos> If the child you are trying to save really is possessed with an Ethros, my prayers are with you.
Sweep east to west, same path as the sun travels.<eos> Like anything else in magic, it's how you do it.<eos> With knowledge and reverence.<eos> Wow, do I feel silly.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Must've been just a spark.<eos> - No.<eos> You felt the power.<eos> All right, Sally will go with you to Ruth's house.
With knowledge and reverence.<eos> Wow, do I feel silly.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Must've been just a spark.<eos> - No.<eos> You felt the power.<eos> All right, Sally will go with you to Ruth's house.<eos> She'll give you the last few things you'll need.<eos> I wish I could go with you.
You won't find two more understanding people in this particular instance.<eos> It just sounds so crazy, and you're gonna think that I'm...<eos> Very brave for facing whatever it is.<eos> You remember that spell that we showed you in class?<eos> Well, it worked.<eos> Not like it helped us meet guys, it helped us make guys out of animals.<eos> And you did this from the spell in that book?<eos> Yeah, and we even played back the tape that we were recording in class so we could hear your corrections to the spell.<eos> But before we had a chance to chant the new version, I mean, there they were.<eos> All right, so what is it that you think these men want with you?
That is a question best answered by Dr. Seigler.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Yes, I can confirm that an establishment by the name of P3 has been quarantined.<eos> But only as a precautionary measure.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello? Remember us?<eos> I'm sorry, we can't hear you.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> We wanna get the hell out of here, that's what we want.<eos> Dr. Williamson will be right in to discuss the situation with you.
A massive manhunt has been launched to find the escapee, a man by the name of Bane Jessup who was awaiting trial for racketeering, money laundering and embezzlement.<eos> So much for keeping things quiet.<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> - Welcome to our world.<eos> - You want some aspirin?<eos> What I want is Prue safe, Bane put in jail, and nobody hurt by any...<eos> - Do you know what that is yet?<eos> - We're still looking.<eos> We do know that Bane definitely kidnapped Prue.<eos> - Has he made contact with you?
- Yes?<eos> - We need to talk to you.<eos> - Are you with the police?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> - But we are here to help.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Does the name Elias Lundy mean anything to you?<eos> Martha, the funeral home called, and they wanted to know if...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here because we really need to talk to you.
-l'm the solution.<eos> I'm the solution to the problem, okay?<eos> This is outrageous, it really is.<eos> What kind of people invite you to go to a concert... and then they don't call you?<eos> It's 4:30 p.m. Maybe we should call them.<eos> Do you know how awkward that is?<eos> They know they invited us to the concert.<eos> They're obviously deliberately not calling.<eos> How could I call them up and go, "We're waiting for your call."<eos> And then they'll say, "Well, we don't want to go with you."
Not everyone's a moron I go out--<eos> You know what she should be reading?<eos> Emily fucking Post!<eos> That's what she should be reading!<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> Saturday night, do me a favor.<eos> I love you, all right?<eos> We have enough good stuff in the bank to get over this.<eos> But Saturday night at dinner, could we maybe try to have an apology for this?<eos> Firstly, there's no way I can have dinner with you on Saturday night.
Impressive.<eos> I just might be able to rig this up from parts from my wharehouses.<eos> The canon uses ID flux energy, so we'll have to build it inside a portal facility.<eos> This place is as good as any.<eos> Oh we can't wait around here entire infrastructure's about to collapse.<eos> Karl, get a crew working on the canon we'll check back with you later.<eos> President Thompson.<eos> You wished an audience?<eos> Zo'or, since your arrival... humanity has willingly assisted you... but we have become some what... dependant on your support.<eos> I'm asking you not to abandon us... but to allow us to fight with you against the Jaridians.
- Low, I would have thought.<eos> Huh. Is that too low to make somebody sick? Yes.<eos> But, Pilot thinks that the cliff chamber your describing may be acting as an amplifier, which would increase the exposure.<eos> I imagine that would be why they all die at 22 cycles.<eos> I believe it would.<eos> Maybe Das figured that out.<eos> You know. Maybe he knew if the Clans moved out of the caves, they'd stop dying so young.<eos> They wouldn't have a reason to... take the stone.<eos> Thanks, guys... we'll all be back up real soon.<eos> Goddess be with you, John.
Thank you, babe.<eos> It just better not be about a guy who talks a lot.<eos> Hey.<eos> Nothing.<eos> What are you guys up to?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Actually, We were just about to go see a foreign film.<eos> Cool.<eos> You know, just because.<eos> Can i come with you guys?
Waiting to get candy.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> The candy is coming!<eos> I need another 15 minutes for it to cool.<eos> All right, everybody, just be quiet.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Be quiet! Pipe down!<eos> What is the matter with you people?
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.<eos> Give her some money.<eos> This isn't really worth the free massage.<eos> -That's right.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> -No.<eos> Eldad is much more cooperative, and he can dance.<eos> You dance for Rachel.<eos> Don't dance for me. Please!<eos> What is the matter with you?
- Do you want some pancakes?<eos> - Finally.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I say we go with "Careless Whisper."<eos> Chandler?<eos> Did she see us yet?<eos> Did she see us?<eos> Janice, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment but I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight.<eos> I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you.
What did I tell you about talking while working?<eos> Do it?<eos> That guy's been waiting 10 minutes.<eos> He's complained about you three times.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> The One With Unagi<eos> What are you up to?<eos> We went to a self-defense class today.<eos> Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.<eos> Takes it out of you?
But the caffeine really sped things up.<eos> That stuff's wonderful!<eos> When Umbriel brought home this carpetbagger, I was against it.<eos> But damn if old legs here ain't grown on me!<eos> Shucks, Colonel!<eos> It's very nice here, but we should go.<eos> I miss me wife and oxygen.<eos> We all miss our loved ones and gases.<eos> Come on, Fry.<eos> Wait, I'm not going with you.
I found a good job.<eos> As a maid.<eos> With all your brains and talent.<eos> I worked my way up.<eos> I run the place now.<eos> I built a life on my own with no help from anyone.<eos> Yes, and think of where you would've been if you'd accepted a little help.<eos> And where Rory would have been?<eos> But no, you were always too proud to accept anything from anyone.<eos> I wasn't too proud to come here to you two... begging for money for my kid's school, was I?
J-Rod, those two goons killed Dirty Willy and kidnapped my Mona.<eos> I say we waste 'em and snag Falzone.<eos> No. We meet Falzone out there on his own turf.<eos> But you don't know how to play.<eos> It's all geometry and physics.<eos> How hard could that be?<eos> Sydney always taught me, the most difficult Pretends have an inner secret.<eos> Once you reveal that secret, it comes naturally.<eos> In 56 minutes, I found the secret to a perfect golf game.<eos> I'll share it with you sometime.
There is no hunter out there, okay?<eos> This is insane.<eos> Can't you people smell a setup, or am I the only one thinking straight here?<eos> Why don't we put it to a vote?<eos> Do we meet Topolsky again or not?<eos> I say we meet, hear what she has to say.<eos> I say we stay away.<eos> - I have to agree with Isabel.<eos> - You know my vote.<eos> But if anything happens to any of you, I...
- It just happened.<eos> - So what's the plan?<eos> That's what we're here for. - To discuss it.<eos> - Well, the first thing is obvious.<eos> We get that videotape and we destroy it.<eos> After that, it's her word against ours.<eos> "Her word against ours"?<eos> Michael, she's our mother.<eos> She's not your mother.<eos> She's not related to you in any way.
I killed you.<eos> Yeah, you killed me, so?<eos> Where was i gonna go, detroit?<eos> Oh no, oh god, no!<eos> A place of everlasting agony and pain!<eos> Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept christ!<eos> Children in this town have not been attending sunday school after mass.<eos> And adults have not been coming to confession.<eos> If this does not change, i promise you, You will all be going to the black pit of satan's world!<eos> That is all, peace be with you.
There'll be plenty of food and water.<eos> Right, folks. Train's leavin'.<eos> Let's move!<eos> Garan?<eos> Don't forget the prayer chain that your father gave you.<eos> Garan?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Have you seen Garan?<eos> Daniel, Teal'c.<eos> Did Garan come back with you?
His symbiote is helping him.<eos> It was close, Colonel.<eos> If you hadn't left when you did... - Hot.<eos> - Yes. I know.<eos> We're trying to keep your temperature down.<eos> The muon radiation affected your hypothalamus.<eos> Essentially your internal thermostat went haywire.<eos> Your respiration, heartbeat and temperature have been fluctuating.<eos> No kiddin'.<eos> As for Dr Jackson, Colonel, he never returned with you.
Because we found another skull.<eos> Identical to the one you found in Belize.<eos> Show me.<eos> It's in a high-security facility.<eos> But if you'd tell us about your experiences...<eos> - Then take me there.<eos> - We can't do that. It's classified.<eos> You have to.<eos> If you don't, then I won't tell you anything.<eos> It is up to you.
I promised he would be safe.<eos> - You are not welcome here.<eos> - In the name of the God Apophis, we have come for a young boy.<eos> - You will leave now. - We will not.<eos> Stand aside.<eos> No!<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> - Do it!<eos> - Drop your weapons. - You heard him!<eos> - I was talking to you, Jack.
If I'm correct, we're looking at the first building blocks of an alien ecosystem.<eos> It's a terraformer?<eos> It's changing the environment to support an entirely different kind of life.<eos> An organic system based on sulphur instead of carbon.<eos> If it's allowed to continue, the whole planet will be remade?<eos> All I know is that the atmosphere on the other side of that energy curtain... ..will not support life as we know it.<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - They do not wish to leave, O'Neill.<eos> - Teal'c says you don't wanna go.<eos> - If we go with you to Earth... ..and you cannot find another world on which we could live, we will die there.
So does the Supreme Court.<eos> We can't do this every time Bartlet wants to make the world better.<eos> The party leadership's gonna choose a Republican and a Democrat.<eos> That's the way it's been, the way it's gonna be, and the way it is.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - The president makes FEC appointments.<eos> - The Senate confirms them.<eos> I'm speaking for the majority leader.<eos> Embarrass us, and we'll give the same back to you.
- May I ask why not, sir?<eos> Because I'd rather not be in therapy for the rest of my life.<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> I won't say that word.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Lydell?<eos> I'm C.J. Cregg, and you've already met Mandy.<eos> Yes, how do you do?<eos> Sit. Thank you for coming such a long way so soon after this unspeakable tragedy.<eos> Glad to be here.<eos> That's why we've asked to talk to you.
Okay. just gimme two minutes.<eos> Ooh!<eos> What "Ooh?" I love gay bars.<eos> I always go to gay bars.<eos> There's not a gay bar in town I haven't been to with you guys.<eos> Okay. just figured out what why I'm alone and dateless on a Saturday night.<eos> You have a boyfriend.<eos> Call Josh.<eos> No. he'll just want to see some chick flick and then talk about it.<eos> I wanna-- I wanna go with you guys.
I was just handed the preliminary forensics report.<eos> Her body was not one of those found in the graves.<eos> Mulder, I know you wanted to find her out there.<eos> He's got hours of video of her.<eos> I'm talking about your sister.<eos> - I know that's who you're looking for. - Yeah.<eos> You don't know how badly I wanted her to be in one of those graves.<eos> As hard as it is to admit, I wanted to find her here riding her bike like all these other kids.<eos> I guess I just want it to be over.<eos> Agent Mulder, Scully, there's a Mr Harold Piller here to see you.
- Not to mention the storm.<eos> God has given us a lot to put our shoulder against.<eos> Yeah, he's been such a help.<eos> Really.<eos> I'll bring her back safe and sound.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Is there something I can do to help?<eos> Do you have any money?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Take me with you.
Do you have any money?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Take me with you.<eos> Please.<eos> - You'll be with us.<eos> We feel your love.<eos> - No, I mean it seriously.<eos> - I speak better Spanish than both of you.<eos> - Sister Angela speaks it perfectly.<eos> Just take me with you.
Yeah, that's right. We're a team!<eos> Well, she's going off to the federal pen to break rocks for the next five years.<eos> Okay, well, don't forget to write.<eos> Bullwinkle!<eos> I guess we could always appear at your trial as animated character witnesses!<eos> No!<eos> Rocky, Bullwinkle, it's your duty to get to New York by 8:00 p.m. tomorrow.<eos> Karen, we can't leave you now.<eos> Hey, I'm an FBI agent, remember?<eos> I'll straighten this out and catch up with you later.
You got it all wrong, holy man.<eos> I absolutely believe in God.<eos> And I absolutely hate the fucker.<eos> He is with us, nonetheless.<eos> 2 of your boys are already dead.<eos> How much faith do you have left, Father?<eos> I only see one way.<eos> That way.<eos> It's the only way off this rock.<eos> Just keep the girl between you.
I am Washakie, of the great Shoshone Nation.<eos> I wish to share with you the story of Nick Wilson, or Yagaichi, as he is best remembered among the Shoshone people.
Now you're gonna transfer to another boat.<eos> Excuse me. Either of you tell me where I can find the exec?<eos> Yeah, that's me, Mac.<eos> Move your truck.<eos> Unload here shortly. You'll unload it now.<eos> Here's the manifest.<eos> -Get those crates below decks.<eos> -Who the hell are you?<eos> Marine Major Coonan, Office of Naval Intelligence.<eos> I'm goin' to sea with you boys.
Now that's the job. It's not a science.<eos> You have to be able to make hard decisions, based on imperfect information.<eos> Asking men to carry out orders that may result in their deaths.<eos> And if you're wrong, you suffer the consequences.<eos> If you're not prepared to make those decisions without pause, without reflection then you've got no business being a submarine captain.<eos> Tell Mr. Hirsch I'd like a word with him, would you?<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> -More soup, Captain?<eos> -Thank you.<eos> I wish I was going with you, gentlemen.
Kruschev can send in more missiles next month<eos> The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316 An invasion?<eos> Yes, sir<eos> We can be sure we get all the missiles and we remove Castro so this can never happen again<eos> Is this the Joint Chief's recommendation? Yes, sir<eos> Our best option as Bob pointed out this morning would be to commence the strikes before the missiles become operational<eos> The invasion happens eight days later<eos> Dean What do you think?<eos> Gentlemen for the last fifteen years I have fought here at this table alongside your predecessors in a struggle against the Soviet<eos> I do not wish to seem melodramatic but I do wish to impress upon you a lesson I learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice
-All right.<eos> You reckon they're friendly?<eos> Shoot, I hope so.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We're just passing through.<eos> We're looking for work.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> We might have some work for you.<eos> He said maybe.<eos> Can we come with you?
That is why, I like them.<eos> Because they are not like you.<eos> They like me for who I am, and not WHO I am.<eos> I mean...<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> How dare you to talk to me like that, Wilma?<eos> No one has ever talked to me like that before!<eos> Well, Mother, may be it's a bad time, somebody did.<eos> Let's go, Fred.<eos> We were right behind you, Wilma.
The patient has been plagued by temporal lobe seizures.<eos> It is the patient's request, Doctor.<eos> I am aware of that, but I don't think... he's in any condition to make requests.<eos> I'm trying to appeal to your logical self, Father.<eos> I'm concerned about harm to my patient.<eos> Father Jeremy...<eos> Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's... and our associate, Maya Larkin.<eos> Associate?<eos> Secular assistants can be permitted... if they are regarded as qualified.<eos> I'm going in with you.
And their bodies are hard and tight... and smooth... the way skin is supposed to be.<eos> And saying so... doesn't make me a pervert.<eos> Men can't say shit anymore.<eos> We're all browbeaten by youth-obsessed old bitches fresh from chemical peels. Still want us to open their doors, pay their way.<eos> Yes, Victor, I love young women.<eos> At least I'm honest enough to say so.<eos> One-hundred fucking percent guilty.<eos> Owens.<eos> We found them, sir.<eos> - She come back with you?
It's just he's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine<eos> And she's watching him with those eyes<eos> And she's loving him with her body and of course I just know it<eos> How you guys doing?<eos> I'm Don.<eos> - Don. Rhyme with flan. - Hi, Don.<eos> - You have any question?<eos> - Yes. Indeed, Don, we do.<eos> - Is this a good machine?<eos> - Yes, if you're a cheap bastard!
I'd like to talk about something more personal.<eos> I'd like to talk about us, the status of you and me.<eos> A wise man once told me that no rabbi can save anyone, he can only offer himself as a guide to other fearful people.<eos> We live in a really complex world.<eos> A world where boundaries and definitions are blurring into each other in ways that challenge us, not just as Jews, but as human beings.<eos> For a while now, you've let me be your guide.<eos> You've shared your lives with me, you've explored your faith with me in ways that, I know, sometimes have seemed strange and even scary.<eos> But you put your trust in me.<eos> And, over the past few months, I have been violating that trust.<eos> I've been violating it by not sharing my life with you.

Will you soil them too?<eos> When you've broken Every other taboo<eos> LIBERTINE: I'll fill every slippery hollow<eos> If you're obliging Then you'll swallow<eos> Manners!<eos> Take him to the infirmary!<eos> - Has he hurt you?<eos> - No, his breath made my eyes run.<eos> Madeleine.<eos> Do you mean to take us all down with you?
Fifty lashes?<eos> A night on the rack?<eos> - I won't sully my hands with him.<eos> - Nor should you.<eos> The first rule of politics:<eos> The man who orders the execution never drops the blade!<eos> You're lucky it's me punishing you.<eos> If it were up to the doctor, you'd be flayed.<eos> The doctor is a man after my own heart.<eos> What am I to do with you?
She means well.<eos> From Troy, Michigan would you please welcome to Cleveland Stillwater!<eos> When you play a great show like tonight...<eos> I need everyone's attention, please.<eos> Girls, I need five minutes with the band alone.<eos> Right. Well, it seems the rumours are true.<eos> The record company's sent a big-time manager here to try and talk you into replacing me.<eos> It's Dennis Hope.<eos> You've all heard of him.<eos> He has all the big bands, and he wants five minutes with you.
You've got to get back to theship.<eos> - Phil? - I repeat, you've got to get back to the ship.<eos> We're in a ship.<eos> This is a ship.<eos> And the countdown's already started.<eos> - He's right. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, let's- - let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Jim?<eos> Come on.<eos> - I'm not coming with you.
Luxurious accommodation. Fine cuisine.<eos> Sultry weather.<eos> Frostbite's off my dick.<eos> I reckon we should wait until they chuck in a ski lift.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Imagine coming to the Himalayas and actually climbing.<eos> Especially when you have to complete your autobiography.<eos> And rustle up those all-important endorsements.<eos> You wankers!<eos> What's bloody wrong with you?
No problem.<eos> Just rip someone's head off on this one.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> All right.<eos> So besides me, who really wants the ball?<eos> Yeah, you want it, Brian.<eos> Let's hook up.<eos> DC Left, Wide Motion, 88 War.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> It's been an honor to share the field of battle with you.
- Don't play games with me, Caleb !<eos> What's the worst thing you've ever done ? The worst ?<eos> - What are you talking about ?<eos> - I know what you did.<eos> What are you talking about ?<eos> Know where I found this ? Hmm ?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I lost this, and I wondered where it went.<eos> Gentlemen. Congratulations.<eos> McNamara, Mandrake, the chairman would like to see you.
- He's stupid.<eos> - What did we do?<eos> - Why does he need tape?<eos> - Tell us what we did.<eos> - You're fucked.<eos> Gonna have a party.<eos> - What kind of party?<eos> - A prison party.<eos> We just got out.<eos> I know what to do with you.
"Fo-satchy." F-O... satchy.<eos> Damn.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Will you be quiet, Tarzan?<eos> I don't do this shit every day.<eos> I'm tellin' you, man.<eos> You can do a lot for this community...<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm sick of bullshitting with you two.
She's my mother! I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Ferris: I don't know what got into me. I'm worthless!<eos> I'm just a worthless human being!<eos> Oh, you're not worthless, honey.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm worthless. No, you're not. You're so sweet.<eos> I love you... Raul:<eos> This isn't Jenny frickin' Jones!<eos> What's the matter with you? Jefe.
-Main power unit offline.<eos> She's holding now but could fall apart at any moment.<eos> Auxiliary power unit failure.<eos> Power level still dropping.<eos> Primary systems will shut down in six minutes.<eos> Change of plans, boys.<eos> We're launching now.<eos> Suit up.<eos> I'll secure the ship.<eos> I'll try to get more systems online and then I'll join you.
Who was it?<eos> That was Chantilas.<eos> Santen's gone too.<eos> What happened?<eos> Pettengil says he threw himself off a cliff.<eos> Anyway, that's the news.<eos> We won't make it much longer.<eos> I hope you got an idea, because we're fresh out.<eos> Let me work on it.<eos> I'll get back to you.
- I don't know it.<eos> Apparently it only affects women.<eos> From the few studies they've done, women who are most susceptible...<eos> Are what?<eos> Say it, Dad.<eos> Women who are loved too much.<eos> Loved too much?<eos> Mom has this disease because we love her too much?<eos> I think you've gone crazy, Daddy.<eos> It's not about you.
This is good.<eos> - You know who I saw on my way in?<eos> - Who?<eos> Cooper Nielson.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Did he seem as cocky in person as he is on TV?<eos> You know, it just kinda freaks me out that we're gonna be seeing people like him around all the time now.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> I'm Maureen.<eos> I guess I'm living with you.
That's all anybody can ask for.<eos> No, it ain't, Coach.<eos> With all due respect, you demanded more of us. You demanded perfection.<eos> Now, I ain't saying that I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not.<eos> And I ain't gonna never be.<eos> None of us are.<eos> But we have won every single game we have played till now.<eos> So this team is perfect.<eos> We stepped out on that field that way tonight. And, if it's all the same to you, Coach Boone, - that's how we want to leave it.<eos> I hope you boys have learned as much from me this year as I've learned from you.
What did you argue about?<eos> Nothing of consequence.<eos> I think he needs a friend like you.<eos> Is that you're way of saying you'd like him at your name day?<eos> A drink for Monsieur?<eos> Tatyana, Monsieur Triquet's waiting.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please. Silence, please.<eos> Silence!<eos> Thank you.<eos> En celebration of her name day, I would like to share with you a short ode I have composed
Let me help these people get across!<eos> Let me get her over!<eos> Let me get her over!<eos> Wait! Just let them get over first!<eos> Wait!<eos> I need to reach this valve in my chest.<eos> Look what's happening!<eos> Just let them get over!<eos> - Help these people get across! - You cannot support them!<eos> Let me get them across, and I'll go right with you!
I don't have a choice, Buzz.<eos> This is my only chance.<eos> To do what, Woody?<eos> Watch kids from behind glass and never be loved again?<eos> Some life.<eos> - ls everybody okay?<eos> - Sheriff Woody!<eos> - I knew you'd make it!<eos> - Now, remember; deputies, the real treasures are your friends and family.<eos> Before I go, kids, I want to share somethin' special with you,
Our friendship will never die<eos> You're gonna see it's our destiny What am I doing?<eos> - Buzz! Wait! Wait!<eos> - Woody, where are you going?<eos> You're right, Prospector.<eos> I can't stop Andy from growing up. But I wouldn't miss it for the world.<eos> - No!<eos> - Buzz!<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes? I'm coming with you!
Alice, look at you. God, you're absolutely stunning!<eos> I don't say that to all the women.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - He does?<eos> That osteopath you sent me to, the guy that worked on my arm?<eos> - You ought to see my serve now.<eos> - He's the top man in New York.<eos> I could have told you that, looking at his bill.<eos> Go inside, have a drink, enjoy the party.<eos> I'll see you in a little bit.
My heroes.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're a vision.<eos> That's a right fine dress you got on.<eos> I wanted to thank you for all you've done for me before I went back to Texas.<eos> Texas?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Come to Washington with me.<eos> Or better yet, come back to Washington with me.<eos> I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you.
Time!<eos> Major Knox, we're leaving now.<eos> You're going to be in charge until I return.<eos> Here's the key to the arsenal.<eos> Martha and Cleaves will be back in a few days.<eos> Too much bourbon in his bourbon.<eos> Will he be all right?<eos> Yeah, he'll be fine.<eos> Mr. Colqhoun... uh...getting dressed?<eos> I'm coming with you.

I did it.<eos> Me!<eos> You know?<eos> It's weird for...<eos> To get credit for lookin' like somebody.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - That's a gift!<eos> I don't know how much of a gift it is.<eos> I am his brother.<eos> That's what's so great about working with you guys.
Esautomátix removes his mask.<eos> Not this way, be careful.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Go, remove his mask, by Tutatis.<eos> It is an order.<eos> As u like.<eos> Its Julio, Julio, Julio Caesar!<eos> We have captured Julio Caesar. I have captured Julio Caesar.<eos> The situation is more serious give what you think.<eos> Obélix, Astérix, Abraracúrcix, and you, Julio Caesar, I wanna speak to you.
- Those are my plates.<eos> - No shit?<eos> That's from a security camera in your office garage... - ...the night Fuller was killed.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> That makes one of us.<eos> Fuller wanted to shut down the project, and you sliced him up.<eos> It's time I call my attorney.<eos> You say you left at 10.<eos> I was working late with Whitney.<eos> Anybody with you?
I need a name.<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> Medical ethics.<eos> I'm going to finish my work here.<eos> I can't tell you what to do...<eos> But you better go back to my office.<eos> The key's under the mat.<eos> In her file, you might find a notation with a man's name on it.<eos> It might be worth your while.<eos> It's up to you.
I can see her if I want to.<eos> The English control half of France.<eos> What have I got to lose?<eos> The other half.<eos> You mustn't see her, Your Majesty.<eos> She may be an instrument of the Devil.<eos> Well, I think you should.<eos> Here's an amusing situation.<eos> I'd love to know why my mother-in-law thinks one thing and my two most loyal and trusted advisers think precisely the opposite.<eos> Because I care about you.
-"That's him," they said.<eos> "The one in the corner with the big nose."<eos> Back off!<eos> My gentle dauphin.<eos> Oh, my gentle dauphin.<eos> I have a message from the King of Heaven for you.<eos> You only.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Your Majesty, I plead--<eos> My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
I need Stella now.<eos> The family's steaming like a cow pie in July.<eos> Said she doesn't look nothin' like the picture they gave you.<eos> I just thought she might not want to meet her maker... looking like a cheap whore.<eos> Well, this cheap whore is that family's loving mother.<eos> The Clemens said to make him look... like he just came in from snowmobiling.<eos> Pink cheeks and...<eos> Red nose and ears.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Sorry I couldn't talk to you before in the cafeteria.
"Please load weapon."<eos> - We are honored to meet you.<eos> - A most extraordinary performance.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Gonzo of Earth, who is this most entertaining friend of yours?<eos> That's Ed.<eos> The cape!<eos> The cape for Ed.<eos> Ed, because of your comic instincts we have chosen you as ambassadorto our planet.<eos> You mean you want me to go with you?
Looked like he had something on his mind.<eos> -Just a white boy trying to be a nigga.<eos> -Didn't even say, "What's up?" to me.<eos> Fuck all that.<eos> How's your game going?<eos> -Come see me play sometime.<eos> -Guaranteed.<eos> "Young people are always more given to admiring what is wild...<eos> "...than what is reasonable." That is a quote from Delacroix.<eos> I want to examine today, with you, the question of identity.
It's never that simple.<eos> That's why after the laughter there's always tears.<eos> You'd be surprised how many white kids do know what time it is.<eos> The same way we was taught when we came here on the slave ships, we teaching now.<eos> So who are the slaves today?<eos> We still the slaves.<eos> -The average working man is a slave.<eos> -We all sharecropping.<eos> But the thing is, this music is so influential and so real there is not a wall built that can hold it down.<eos> Me and Charlie wanna come hang out with you.
Your father certainly enjoyed them.<eos> Is that why you like him?<eos> The king, I mean.<eos> Because he reminds you of Father?<eos> I think that cigar has clouded your brain, young man.<eos> Go on.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> You drag me out at night and turn down five pounds a bushel? !<eos> - French offer seven!<eos> - What is the matter with you people? !
There is a traitor marching on palace.<eos> Deception's only purpose is to hide children in monastery in village of Nong Khai.<eos> Please, mem.<eos> My king believes you are wise.<eos> You are only one who can persuade him to stay with children until army returns to Bangkok and palace is secure.<eos> Please, mem.<eos> I have just been informed of the nature of your expedition, Your Majesty.<eos> And I would like to ask a few questions about the dangers involved as I've heard, at times, wild elephants cannot be reasoned with.<eos> I am surprised Kralahome took time to arouse such curiosity rather than make sure mem not miss her boat.<eos> We have already missed our boat so that I might speak with you now.

- Roberta! - Guadalupe, is that you? Oh.<eos> Oh, I'm good, I'm good.<eos> That's not Lucy. Oh!<eos> Oh, guys, this is so great.<eos> - And DeSean?<eos> You're a monster.<eos> You're huge! - How you doing?<eos> You grew a little.<eos> You guys, you grew a little bit. Okay, these are four of my... not my best students, but my first students.<eos> They've agreed to come and play in the concert with you guys.
Interested?<eos> If it allows me to pursue a life of religious and spiritual fulfilment, of course.<eos> I appreciate a good fighter, mr.<eos> Sarcasm from some shit-fuck cop killer, however, is something i simply will not tolerate.<eos> I'm prepared to make you an offer.<eos> Listening?<eos> I asked you a question. Are we listening?<eos> Yeah, i'm listening.<eos> Good.<eos> Pray, gentlemen, a word with you.
You should have taken time off after Tracy died.<eos> - That has nothing to do with it, Captain.<eos> - Oh. Are you sure?<eos> Absolutely sure.<eos> When was the last time you had a physical?<eos> Physical.<eos> Is that the blood pressure, when they do the...<eos> I want you both checked out.<eos> You understand me?<eos> I obviously can't count on you anymore.
-"Screw," Andrew.<eos> -Really?<eos> How much?<eos> That is roughly one's monthly salary.<eos> That's more than I make in a year.<eos> Not bad for, what did you call him last time we were here?<eos> Household appliance.<eos> -Household appliance?<eos> -Household appliance, yes.<eos> May the peace of the Lord be with you always.
[ Music in the background ] ...Last night a DJ saved my life... - Check out the booty.<eos> - They want you, honey.<eos> They want you, sugar. Come on.<eos> - Listen, now. Go, girl.<eos> [ Jip Narrating ] Koop dreams of being the world's top club spinner, but he reckons it doesn't matter how well you can beat mix.<eos> You ain't a DJ until you can scratch.<eos> [ Jip Narrating ] But he can't scratch to save his life.<eos> He just digs the fantasy, man.<eos> Go on, my son!<eos> So is your brother still going out with you lot tonight, yeah?
I don't wanna see him right now.<eos> Wait for me outside.<eos> Ill handle it.<eos> Outside, okay?<eos> So, you wanna steal my stuff.<eos> And your friend wants to steal my girl.<eos> Okay, no problem.<eos> Everybody makes mistakes.<eos> But, you see, you guys are fucking with me on my turf... and you trashed my club.<eos> So now I gotta figure out how to deal with you.
Are you hoping to come back to the force?<eos> You got lucky this time.<eos> Maradona will visit Hong Kong from Argentina next week.<eos> They want you to be his bodyguards.<eos> If you do a good job, we might let you back on the police department.<eos> What the singer, Madonna?<eos> But I thought she lived in the US.<eos> She means Maradona, the football player.<eos> I don't think so, but thanks anyway.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. What's the matter with you?
It doesn't stand against negotiations.<eos> It wasn't intended for that.<eos> I promise.<eos> -What do you warrantee?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> I give you my word that it will be organized with total transparency.<eos> We will be watching.<eos> We won't swallow anything.<eos> I hope so. I won't let you swallow anything.<eos> I just wish to have the chance to work with you.
We're fine.<eos> - You'll be a busy slayer, baby-sitting them.<eos> - I doubt they'll have any more trouble.<eos> I doubt your doubt.<eos> Everyone knows that witches killed those kids, and Amy is a witch.<eos> Michael is whatever the boy of witch is, plus being the poster child for yuck.<eos> If you're gonna hang with them, expect badness.<eos> That's what you get when you hang with freaks and losers.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> That was a pointed comment about me hanging with you guys.
I don't have any coffee.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You don't drink?<eos> Beverages, I mean.<eos> No, I do.<eos> It's just the caffeine. It makes me jittery.<eos> - I understand Buffy spent the night. - I'm sorry about that.<eos> - We came back after patrolling...<eos> - I'm not interested in the details.<eos> I'm here because I'm worried about you two, in general.
-I am going to count. 1, 2, 3!<eos> Yeah! -Super!<eos> Bob, do you want to hear else?<eos> -Merengue<eos> Polk?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Playboys and I will see.<eos> This is too funky to your style, the l 'da?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I can play with you?
So, from now on it'll be one way only:<eos> from me to the cell leaders directly.<eos> And untraceable.<eos> I'll be in the center.<eos> You all know me already, so there's no new security risk for me.<eos> I've already had someone devise a new trapdoor cypher to actualize our globals.<eos> It has a rolling authenticator code.<eos> You can receive, but can't send.<eos> What he's not saying is if you're kept the FBI there's no way you can give them your code.<eos> Or anyone else's, no matter how hard they hit on you.
Hurry!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Just in time!<eos> No!<eos> I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms.<eos> We're close.<eos> I can smell those orange guys.<eos> - Stop right there!<eos> Slurms McKenzie!<eos> - Take me with you.
We can regroup there and continue our search for the nanos.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Suggest we persuade you to come with us or we bludgeon you unconscious.<eos> Him come with us?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> ! That so dumb, I should have said it!<eos> Mr. Rimmer saw the confidential files.<eos> He knows all the security codes.<eos> Without him, our chances of escape are as remote as meeting an interesting hairdresser called Kylie.<eos> If I come with you, what have you got to offer?
Okay, so one trip to the eraser room, and you're, like, above working?<eos> Go get your uniform on, Madonna.<eos> The masses are demanding alien-themed greasy food... and, by God, it is our job to serve it to them.<eos> Look, Maria, this is really important.<eos> I promise I will tell you everything later.<eos> You're the best, but right now I've gotta go.<eos> Okay, I want some answers, all right?<eos> 'Cause first of all... there are rumors going around that last week you were shot here in the cafe.<eos> And then at the Crash Festival, you were seemingly run over by a car, but then you weren't.<eos> And every time I walk up to you two, you go silent... or you make up some ridiculous story about Czechoslovakia... which is a country that has not existed for 10 years.
I'm going to use the bathroom, and then I really will go.<eos> -Daddy?<eos> -No, Simon!<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was peeing, and I didn't want him to see me.<eos> I was afraid he'd see me and then he'd be drawing pictures for a child psychologist and nobody's happy.<eos> -I'II get a Band-Aid.<eos> -He's hurt. He might need a stitch.<eos> -I'II go with you to the emergency room. -No!
And I feel like I've been singing for years<eos> Yeah! Take that, Mr. Chandler!<eos> Yes!<eos> All right, guys, we've got four hours to figure out a way out of here in time to slide.<eos> None of you is going anywhere.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm stuck.<eos> I can't move my feet.<eos> I see my little friend, Mac, has been in touch with you.
Is there an upside to this?<eos> Not really.<eos> You made it Quinn.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Whoa! We thought we lost you guys!<eos> It's good to see you guys, too.<eos> But what's the big deal?<eos> Really.<eos> It's not like we weren't just with you.
Didn't even realise it was happening.<eos> I vaguely remember having some water in my ear, that's it.<eos> - Dr. Fraiser injected me with something.<eos> - She was trying to sedate you.<eos> She didn't give enough to Teal'c. He sprung you and off you went.<eos> He's fine, by the way.<eos> Beat the crap out of a couple of SFs, but he's fine.<eos> We're telling you the truth, Sam.<eos> You should have followed procedure.<eos> I fully intend to return with you just to make sure everything's all right.
That was just about the worst writing I've ever heard.<eos> I know.<eos> gilded in gold.<eos> The White House has one of the largest collections.<eos> Why the protestors?<eos> many designed by the noted silversmith Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot.<eos> The collection's in the Gold Room with the glass chandelier made in England in 1785.<eos> What does it have to do with protestors?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's interesting information I thought I'd share with you.
- Will: Where?<eos> - Grace: Don't look.<eos> ...primavera. marinara. alfredo.<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh. that's your rice.<eos> It's in a leaf.<eos> - Can we go somewhere else?<eos> - Uhh... sure.<eos> I guess.<eos> We'll go with you.
Only I think it just confused him even more.<eos> What brings you guys here?<eos> Well. we were having lunch around the corner and we thought we'd stop by.<eos> Yeah. a little bit of bad news.<eos> We're not gonna be able to make it to dinner tonight.<eos> Oh. you're kidding. How come?<eos> Well. it's just-- I have a--<eos> - We have to--<eos> - Say it.<eos> When we play with you guys. I don't have fun.
You're just gonna have to try a little harder next year.<eos> Gimme a hug.<eos> I missed you.<eos> - Still Daddy's baby, huh?<eos> - Honey?<eos> Do they know that you left?<eos> No, I escaped.<eos> Of course they know I left.<eos> I'm better.<eos> Time to spend some time with you.
Pumbaa!<eos> Come here.<eos> Good morning, mon capitaine!<eos> I want you to keep a close watch on Kiara.<eos> You know she's bound to run off.<eos> Don't worry, Simba, we're on her like stink on a warthog.<eos> Hey!<eos> It's a hard truth, Pumbaa.<eos> Live with it.<eos> Guys, I'm counting on you.
And to make our official welcome complete... Mr. Soil?<eos> - Yes, Your Highness?<eos> - He's our resident thespian.<eos> Last year he played the lead in Picnic.<eos> The children... and myself...<eos> have quickly put together... a little presentation in honor of our guests.<eos> Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?<eos> Oh, aren't they adorable!<eos> Ooh, they're cute!<eos> The South Tunnel Elementary School second grade class... would like to present you with this, a mural we have drawn... of you bugs helping us fight the grasshoppers away.
- Echo 2, ready.<eos> Fire!<eos> I think we got him.<eos> We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.<eos> Echo 4, where is target?<eos> Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir.<eos> I don't think I can shake him.<eos> I think I lost him.<eos> We've... We've lost Echo 4, sir.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
Fire!<eos> Get that door!<eos> The lock!<eos> Trapped!<eos> Charge them!<eos> Spare their lives if you can.<eos> Cowards!<eos> Twenty men run from four!<eos> No one has the stomach to fight the Captain.<eos> I am not angry with you.
Don't! Don't! Don't do this!<eos> Your mother's not in there, Ian!<eos> Your mom is not in there, son.<eos> There's not another man I'd go through hell with.<eos> Elevator to hell.<eos> Going up.<eos> Come on.<eos> So long.<eos> Wish us luck.<eos> I'm going with you.
Congratulations.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Mitsubishi.<eos> Mr. Harrison here you go.<eos> Ryan ! Ryan !<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice talking with you.
The King of Spain.<eos> Leave us.<eos> How would he guarantee it?<eos> He would marry you.<eos> Only to make an alliance.<eos> He would not expect to...<eos> He would live in Spain.<eos> Why do you do this, Robert?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And though you will not see me, I am the only one who would care for you.
Good to see you, man.<eos> It's been a Iong time.<eos> I've got to get back in shape.<eos> It's been a Iong summer.<eos> - I believe these belong to you?<eos> - Keep them.<eos> You never know when you might need them.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Just a fan.<eos> I was hoping I couId train with you guys.
We were waiting in line for half the night.<eos> The bouncer finally gives us the nod.<eos> We go over there and debut our brand-new ids.<eos> - The dude goes... - Bye-bye.<eos> No one says bye-bye to the Brandt Man.<eos> Fellas. What can I say?<eos> My subcontractor has been slacking off.<eos> I want to make this up to you.<eos> I have a foolproof method that will guarantee you ace your History final.<eos> But if you'd rather see your grades crash and burn. It's up to you.
You haven't seen enough yet.<eos> Hey, you!<eos> You think he'll fly?<eos> We'll see.<eos> I am going to chase him.<eos> Is that allowed?<eos> I don't want to go back to that huge house by myself.<eos> It gets really lonely.<eos> Time is up.<eos> Hey, what's happen to you?
Of course.<eos> We can do a lot for you, captain.<eos> We can earn our keep, work for you, help you.<eos> All we need is a place to stay, a place to call home... until we one day can find a place to make our home.<eos> The queens thank you for your help in this, Delenn.<eos> It's not a problem, Lesharr.<eos> The Gaim were a great help in our fight against the Shadows... and continue to be strong allies under the Alliance.<eos> If we can offer further help to your colonies, let us know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The queens be with you.
I thought the brainwashed drones went on a cruise.<eos> Okay, Larry.<eos> I'm sure that ifwe understood whatyou were talking about, we would agree with you.<eos> But for now, just talk aboutyour feelings.<eos> Okay.<eos> Abby, all I want is for us to be in love... and still have our freedom.<eos> After 28 years, you still wantyour freedom?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, buddy. You got it.<eos> Hey. Can I crash with you guys tonight?
You and Leonard.<eos> Me and... Leonard?<eos> [ Laughs ] They showed the bench a lot, Greg.<eos> You should have thought about that beforeyou cheated on us.<eos> I couldn't help myself.<eos> It was the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan high-fived me!<eos> Actually, I missed his hand, and he hit me in the head.<eos> B-But still- Let's go, Edward.<eos> Let's take Leonard his dinner.<eos> We'll go with you.
A 30, keep them coming.<eos> It's looking very good, very good.<eos> - Oh, sweet Jesus!<eos> - There's gotta be another test.<eos> - My angel, sweetheart.<eos> - What's he doing here? - He was with her during the bombing.<eos> - I bet he was.<eos> - We were getting a checkup.<eos> - You killed my daughter. Proud of yourself?<eos> If she'd stayed with you, she would've killed herself.
- I knew it.<eos> Someone's gonna have to tell Anspaugh, and I am voting for you, Peter.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Dr. Weaver, glad you could join us.<eos> I was explaining our plan to pursue industrial contracts.<eos> Can I speak to you for a minute?<eos> Sure. Sure.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The ER doesn't stop for lunch.<eos> Go take a seat, and we'll join you as soon as we can.
Ma, you should be happy for him. He feels good.<eos> He feels independent.<eos> Come on, guys. - Oh!<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> - Hi, Grandma.<eos> Hey, guys, hey.<eos> Hey, Deb, guess what. Look who forgave me.<eos> Oh good.<eos> 'Cause there was such a hole in our lives.<eos> The only good thing about Robby leaving me is I get to spend more time with all of you.
What can I do for you?<eos> - Everyone sort of dresses alike?<eos> We feel uniforms and lab coats just serve to stigmatize the patients.<eos> If we dress as doctors, they act like patients.<eos> We work hard to eliminate the visual cues in the ward.<eos> You can tell us apart by the keys we wear on our belts.<eos> I'm Frank Black. Peter Watts.<eos> We're working with the Sheriff's Department.<eos> They called.<eos> He's very anxious to speak with you.
"The Hanged Man." A new awakening.<eos> You're a strong, independent woman... with great success in your future, but I do not see marriage.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I don't see it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't see marriage.<eos> Well, how can you just say that like that?<eos> I mean, what about my feelings?<eos> Honey, I'm a psychic. I'm not a shrink.<eos> So, who is the fabulous mother in the hat... and when do I get to go to church with you two?
We're all going downtown to this club, Chaos.<eos> Great.<eos> Don't tell her I'm nice.<eos> Miranda was gonna hate Skipper.<eos> She'd think he was mocking her with his sweet nature and decide he was an asshole.<eos> The way she had decided all men were assholes.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey, Carrie, it's Charlotte.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> - I can't meet you guys for dinner tomorrow because I have an amazing date.
I can't.<eos> Keiko's waiting on me for dinner.<eos> Book a holosuite for next Thursday.<eos> They're going to Bajor.<eos> - Hi, Julian. - Hi.<eos> You going to Vic's?<eos> - Mind if I join you?
This is a special moment.<eos> I won't ruin it by arguing with you.<eos> You believe the Prophets are the gods of Bajor, I believe the Pah-wraiths are.<eos> Let's just leave it at that.<eos> I'd like to, but we can't both be right.<eos> The Pah-wraiths!<eos> They've sent us a sign!<eos> My children, good news.<eos> Something wondrous has happened.<eos> This infant, born of the love between Benyan and Mika, was transformed in her womb into a living symbol of the covenant I've made with you.
I did meet with the Evaluation Board several times.<eos> And?<eos> They gave me some books to read, some counselling. But once a host and symbiont are joined, there's not much they can do.<eos> My parents, my friends, my crewmates... it's like they don't know me anymore, which is understandable since I hardly even know myself.<eos> That's why I took a leave of absence to come here.<eos> If anyone can help me through this, it's you.<eos> I'll do all I can.<eos> But the truth is, we're leaving for Tyree.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll come with you.
The very least Worf could do is show us some appreciation.<eos> - Is it so hard to say thank you?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Nice try but I want to hear it from him.<eos> - Don't do this, Quark.<eos> - Do what?<eos> All I'm asking for is two little words.<eos> - Be quiet.<eos> - That's two words all right. Just not the two I was hoping for.<eos> Why should I feel any gratitude toward you?
You can blink now, Colonel.<eos> You've won.<eos> - The Senator will remove the weapons.<eos> - What changed her mind?<eos> I told her that if she didn't remove them, I would.<eos> - And what changed your mind?<eos> - You did.<eos> Remind me never to play poker with you.<eos> Show yourselves.<eos> I've come to speak with you.
You should have seen my brother.<eos> He was brilliant.<eos> In a half hour we'll have Moogie back and we can all go home.<eos> Home...to the torrential rains of Ferenginar.<eos> You know what I miss most?<eos> The rotting vegetation.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - And the dampness.<eos> Oh, to stand once more in those rivers of muck.<eos> I only wish I could be there with you.
We can't have a prisoner exchange without a prisoner.<eos> If they find out he's dead, they'll kill us.<eos> Will you stop saying that?<eos> Maybe, if we surrender, they won't hurt us.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> Let's sneak back to my ship and escape.<eos> It's a big station.<eos> If we hide, maybe they won't find us.<eos> No one's hiding and no one's escaping, and no one's surrendering.<eos> What's wrong with you?
No - I have to go... but I will be able to see you the whole time through that camera right there, see?<eos> Alright, I'll stay for a little while.<eos> She seems to have bonded with Captain Carter.<eos> I can't blame her for being terrified, believe me it was not pretty over there.<eos> What happened?<eos> We counted 1, 432 dead.<eos> I believe we may be indirectly responsible.<eos> How?<eos> It's possible someone from Earth brought a normally harmless bacteria to that planet... it learned some new traits from a local organism... and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain I've ever encountered.<eos> Are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
Anyway, they sealed their Stargate,... and I don't know how to communicate with them to get it open.<eos> - Do you know where this planet is?<eos> - Yes, I have the co- ordinates right here.<eos> Then we must go back to the mountaintop.<eos> Really?<eos> Uh... I can't... I can't...<eos> I can't get you out of here.<eos> That's not a problem.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, but I have to go with you.
I am sorry.<eos> We understand, Sam, that you have no ill intentions, that you only wish to extract the Ke.<eos> But your methods are wasteful and violent.<eos> They not only upset our people,...<eos> but our spirits.<eos> Why can you not be content with the Ke that the spirits send down the river?<eos> Our people may need more than the river can provide.<eos> But we don't wish to shorten your supply.<eos> We do have other mining methods that are less destructive.<eos> Perhaps Tonane could return with you through the Circle of Standing Water and see these methods.
We had operatives who died on board those vessels!<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - We were only defending our planet.<eos> We didn't know they had travelled to the Tauri.<eos> This information explains a lot.<eos> At least now we know how and why our operatives died.<eos> For that, we are truly grateful.<eos> So maybe we can be of service.<eos> Perhaps you're correct.<eos> I'll try to convince the Council of Tok'ra to meet with you.
proud to call you friend.<eos> Martouf, all tunnels but this one and the escape tunnel have vanished.<eos> All the other Tok'ra have gone to the new home world.<eos> We must go.<eos> - What about my father?<eos> - When and if he awakens Selmak knows where we'll be.<eos> He can follow.<eos> - But the Goa'uld will capture him.<eos> - If he's captured, he will die before he will reveal our whereabouts.<eos> - Then take him with you.
I told Ally I'd take her to the new piece of animated crap.<eos> Oh, it's not crap, Dad.<eos> It's good.<eos> I mean, it's no "Little Mermaid," but, uh£­£­<eos> Amy wanted to go.<eos> £­ Hi, Grandpa!<eos> £­ Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Go get your raincoat.<eos> £­ Really raining, huh?<eos> Hey, maybe I'll go with you?
It's different on the news.<eos> All I'm saying is, I'm ready.<eos> You know, for things you don't think I'm ready for.<eos> Maybe I'm not ready.<eos> I'm 12 years old, Dad.<eos> In the caveman days, I'd be having children of my own.<eos> That's what we call progress, young lady.<eos> You're missing the best part of the game.<eos> God.<eos> Well, we're so looking forward to seeing you.
Jim isn't making this decision as a president, he's making it as a husband and a father.<eos> History will judge you by what you do right now, Kathryn.<eos> For God's sake, sign it.<eos> No.<eos> You are released.<eos> I can now confirm that General Radek is in the process of being released.<eos> It is confirmed.<eos> They are releasing the general.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Now we return to our homeland... where Radek will decide how best to use you... now that we know you are willing to negotiate.
- Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey! Open that door!<eos> Welcome, Americans, to our independence party!<eos> I love you, Americans!<eos> What great taste you have.<eos> Every man on the planet... must take every opportunity to show his gratitude.<eos> Because you share your culture and resolutions with the whole world, spreading it to all other nations, influencing all other cultures... and touching the hearts of millions.<eos> Now I wish to share something...<eos> with you.
It's gone.<eos> Lauren!<eos> Graham!<eos> - We're over here.<eos> - We're here.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> Roughy ran away.<eos> It wasn't just Graham's fault.<eos> It was my idea, too.<eos> I'm so mad at you.
But - Yeah, I'm glad you...<eos> I'm feeling neglected out there!<eos> It's time we went to dinner.<eos> Tracy, could you give me a minute, please?<eos> -Sorry, I came at a bad time.<eos> -I'll go get my purse.<eos> I'll let myself out.<eos> I know the perfect place.<eos> If you recommend it, it'll be great.<eos> I'll catch up with you.
- Samuel, wait.<eos> - Levinia, please. We know what we did was very wrong.<eos> We betrayed your trust and we hurt you.<eos> I'd like to say I wish this never happened but I would be lying.<eos> Coming here was the best thing that's ever happened to us.<eos> Where we live, real friends are very hard to find.<eos> Samuel, you told me to look inside my heart to find forgiveness.<eos> That's what we want you to do now.<eos> For what it's worth, thank you.<eos> I know I wasn't very good at scrubbing floors, but I really loved spending time with you.
Why?<eos> I just...<eos> I just can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> He's not allowed, is he?<eos> Come on, love.<eos> Dave!<eos> Oi, you deaf twat!<eos> What do you want now?<eos> I told you, I'm finished with you.
- Me too.<eos> What are you gonna do about it, huh?<eos> Now, Gordon!<eos> Now!<eos> Listen!<eos> Listen to me, children!<eos> I want you all to stop what you are doing. - Huh?<eos> - Who said that? - This is the voice of G...<eos> God.<eos> Yes, God is talking to you... and I want you all to leave this house.
No, none of you.<eos> Don't die.<eos> In passing, a few words about our nation's minorities.<eos> The people of the whole country are pleased that the minority nationalities... and the Han people are united.<eos> But, we must combat Han chauvinism.<eos> Don't get the idea that it is the Han nationality that... has been primarily helping the minority nationality.<eos> The minority have given the Han people great help.<eos> Their every participation in the community of the Chi--<eos> Dalai Lama, excuse me.<eos> Chairman Mao Tse-tung has sent for you.
I'll be his eyes.<eos> As you like, San.<eos> But there is a life for you with that boy.<eos> I hate humans!<eos> From Ashitaka... for me?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> You two go with San.<eos> I will stay with the Deer God.<eos> Let's go.<eos> The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Kenyawa Tambe just charged some tickets to a ski resort.<eos> Yeah, so what?<eos> Kenyawa Tambe is one of Luanne's aliases.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me this before?<eos> - I just found out. - Oh really?<eos> - Yeah. You know, we're supposed to be working as a team here.<eos> - You're going around behind my back.<eos> - If the pressure's too much for you... - You'll take over!<eos> You'll take over! - Sirs!<eos> I shall go with you.
We're unable to take yourcall.<eos> - Leave a message.<eos> - Say goodbye ... and thank you.<eos> It's Simon.<eos> I'm in town.<eos> You've never been out later than ten o'clock.<eos> Pick up the phone.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm going to try you in the morning.<eos> I need to see you.
-Do they like music?<eos> -Might do.<eos> -Who is this lady?<eos> -Did you all play together here?<eos> -Is she Mrs. Castle?<eos> -Yes, that's right.<eos> It's a very good picture of the both of you.<eos> It must have been very difficult to take.<eos> She's very pretty.<eos> Has she come with you?
Look at this, all these melons, no good.<eos> Spoiled.<eos> Hog food now.<eos> Jewel, darlin', you got to throw these out.<eos> You got some .45 shells?<eos> Clean out.<eos> Be going to Gainesville first thing in the morning.<eos> I'll pick some up. You still be around then?<eos> Might be.<eos> What's wrong with you two today?
A very lucky hand.<eos> All life is a game of luck.<eos> A real man makes his own luck, Archie.<eos> Right, Dawson?<eos> And you find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I do.<eos> I mean, I've got everything I need right here with me.<eos> I got air in my lungs and a few blank sheets of paper.<eos> I love waking up in the morning not knowing what's gonna happen... or who I'm gonna meet... where I'm gonna wind up.<eos> Just the other night I was sleeping under a bridge, and now... here I am on the grandest ship in the world... having champagne with you fine people.
What are you doing?<eos> No more killing.<eos> - I think...<eos> - You don't think!<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Why don't we take them with us?<eos> We might need them.<eos> That's thinking.<eos> - You drive.<eos> - Don't make us go with you.
You already know what it feels like, but now you'll mean it. Don't!<eos> - Don't!<eos> - Where were you?<eos> Where the hell were you? !<eos> Where were you? !<eos> - In the storeroom by the door. - You're saying there's a door?<eos> Here!<eos> Just take them!<eos> Take the keys, Duncan.<eos> We're gonna wait for him to get here because he wants to talk to you...
No, that's crazy talk.<eos> She read this article in The New York Times about people like you... -who'd rather be at work than at home.<eos> -I wouldn't rather be at work.<eos> believe me, I wish I wasn't here right now.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, this is a Iot more fun than cleaning up and raising kids... and paying the bills.<eos> Boy, I wish I had someplace to hide out.<eos> I'm not hiding out. I'm earning a living.<eos> Which was your idea, I believe.<eos> Come on, don't you think I'd rather be with you guys?
You don't understand.<eos> He's amazing.<eos> You never know what'll happen.<eos> You go out for beer and end up on a boat to Nova Scotia.<eos> -Really? -It's beautiful country up there.<eos> Hey. Okay.<eos> I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snakebite kit.<eos> It won't be exactly like last time.<eos> I'll see you guys.<eos> I have an audition, but I'll meet you.
I said now!<eos> You're telling me Suba's vanished into thin air?<eos> I'm telling you our sources have come up empty so far, but we're working on it.<eos> What about satcom traffic?<eos> - We're working on it.<eos> - I'm getting tired of that phrase!<eos> You're starting to test my patience.<eos> - Do you understand what I mean-?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Can I have a word with you?
George, I just got off a 23-hour plane ride.<eos> I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll ask you again when you're rested.<eos> I'm sure she'll come around.<eos> Yeah, I hope so, for your sake.<eos> I said I was sorry.<eos> You can stuff your sorries in a sack.<eos> Would you please stop saying that?<eos> - What's up with you two?
They're embarrassing me.<eos> They're embarrassing America.<eos> They turned the Navy into a floating joke.<eos> They ruined all our best names like Bruce and Lance and Julian.<eos> Those were the toughest names we had.<eos> Now they're just...<eos> - Queer?<eos> - Yeah, and that's another thing.<eos> I resent you people using that word.<eos> That's our word for making fun of you.
Oh, you're referring to me.<eos> Yes, I'm framing you.<eos> And I'm doing a really excellent job too.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This is all because I got to be Krusty's sidekick instead of you, isn't it?<eos> Off the record, yes.<eos> But officially, I did it for the money.<eos> Speaking of which, hand it over.<eos> Ta.<eos> I forgot to mention, I'm planning to blow up the dam with you inside.
Then we just got to wait 40 minutes till Rickman's timer hits zero.<eos> Can you believe it, Rembrandt?<eos> 40 minutes till you're home.<eos> Hey, guys, I'm going back to the compound for Alisandra.<eos> You can't go back to the compound.<eos> That's the first place Rickman will look for us.<eos> Rembrandt, we all know how much you care about her, but you'll be putting us in too much danger.<eos> Look, I didn't say "us."<eos> I got 40 minutes, right?<eos> I'll catch up to you.
I'll catch up to you.<eos> Remmy, if you miss the slide, you're never gonna get home.<eos> Maybe so, but it's somethin' I have to do.<eos> Fine, then we'll go with you.<eos> I'm going to have to pull rank on you, Q-Ball.<eos> Can't let one person jeopardize a whole mission.<eos> Right, Captain?<eos> He's right.<eos> All right.<eos> So where can I meet you?
I belong with my own kind.<eos> But it was good to feel like a human being, if only for a little while.<eos> Use the back door, quickly.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Have you forgotten who I am?<eos> It is I who created you!<eos> Now, all of you, get out of here before I take away the very life I gave you!<eos> Yes!<eos> There's your villain!<eos> He doesn't care for you!
I never saw him at the Institute, locked away for being too smart.<eos> He's passed himself off as normal.<eos> He's Mr Normal Starfleet man.<eos> Mr Productive Member of Society.<eos> Maybe we can learn to be just like him.<eos> Wear little uniforms.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> No, sir! Thank you, sir!<eos> - l don't like it here.<eos> - lt's going to be all right. Dr Bashir is going to work with you, that's all.
I can feel my pagh slipping away.<eos> Nerys!<eos> We found them.<eos> It's a Cardassian heavy weapons unit.<eos> Third assault group.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> How far?<eos> Just outside of Tempasa.<eos> I'll go with you.
No - I have to go... but I will be able to see you the whole time through that camera right there, see?<eos> Alright, I'll stay for a little while.<eos> She seems to have bonded with Captain Carter.<eos> I can't blame her for being terrified, believe me it was not pretty over there.<eos> What happened?<eos> We counted 1, 432 dead.<eos> I believe we may be indirectly responsible.<eos> How?<eos> It's possible someone from Earth brought a normally harmless bacteria to that planet... it learned some new traits from a local organism... and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain I've ever encountered.<eos> Are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
Oh, Jack, what did I do?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> Just got a little mouthy.<eos> Nothin' serious.<eos> Dr. Warner, I want to know the minute that godforsaken thing can be taken out.<eos> - Is that clear?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> This conversation is over.<eos> As you were, people.<eos> In light of the day's events, Colonel Kennedy has made recommendations to my superiors that I want to share with you. Colonel Kennedy?
There were no dying words.<eos> Penny Timmons' Iarynx was severed.<eos> She couldn't cry for help even if there was help to cry for.<eos> - And no one followed up on this lead?<eos> - No.<eos> But... I'II have someone get you the number and you can follow up on it.<eos> I'd appreciate that.<eos> People? People?<eos> Listen up now.<eos> I've brought some folks who wanna talk with you.
One, two, three.<eos> Like soft gentle winds that will blow through your hair Like fire that warms you when no one else cares Like flowers that bloom from the Earth in the spring<eos> Watch it!<eos> Like flora and fauna that brighten your day Like water we drink, and the sea where we play Like dragonflies riding the air on their wings<eos> So give thanks and give praise to the gods for their bounty<eos> And thanks to Athena from city and county<eos> But most of all honor the goddess, Demeter With flowers and songs and with crops that will feed her<eos> To her we will lift up our cups as we say<eos> A woman's a natural thing Ok, take five.<eos> I'll work with you slowly in small groups.
Set sharpened spikes along the walls.<eos> -We'll hang 'em from the battlements.<eos> -What the Hades do you think you're doing?<eos> -Taking command!<eos> Someone has to.<eos> Isn't it great, commander?<eos> Xena's fighting with us.<eos> We'll teach those barbarians a lesson, now.<eos> Yeah, let's not make a big deal about it.<eos> I wanna talk to you two. Inside.
You see, graboids hunt by sound.<eos> I'll probably just go hook that to the back of the truck.<eos> Mr. Hoover, come here please.<eos> I have the monitor working.<eos> Okay.<eos> We've set up radio seismographs all over the place, so the monitor will show you where the graboids are.<eos> Cool.<eos> You know, this is none of my business, I guess.<eos> But you guys are going out there alone?<eos> You don't want to take with you, like, the whole army of Mexico?
He needs a cup of joe to let it flow!<eos> Leaky, reach on up in there and get it!<eos> But make sure you take off your watch.<eos> No, I was the last one out, right?<eos> And Bob, the last words he said to me were...<eos> "lf l go, man, you take the torch. "You save the planet." Right? And I´m like, "Wild!"<eos> -Excuse me.<eos> -Monique!<eos> I see Mom let you off your leash.<eos> Bud and Doyle refuse to speak to anyone but you.
And i can learn more.<eos> I can do the egg trick.<eos> Anything you want me to do.<eos> Quiet down, albert.<eos> You rest now, ok?<eos> I take off your shoes, ok?<eos> Now rest. Rest.<eos> And later, we will take you for hot cakes, ok?<eos> But we have to call your godmother.<eos> I want to stay with you.
is this the Colliery Band rehearsal?<eos> No, love, t'band's on Tuesdays.<eos> Tonight's origami class.<eos> Take no notice, flower.<eos> Can I help?<eos> I'm staying at the pub.<eos> I play the flugel.<eos> well, sort of dabble.<eos> Mrs Foggan said...<eos> well, she said you might let me play with you.
You know, this is LA.<eos> We should be learning Mexican.<eos> That would be Spanish, genius.<eos> She's here.<eos> - She who?<eos> - Someone to be the fourth.<eos> She's the one.<eos> You feeling okay?<eos> That's her.<eos> Do you guys mind if I sit with you?
When the two of you come together, Rayburn and the Giants that's like a magical conjunction, like the alignment of the planets.<eos> You're gonna bring us all the way.<eos> Who said it first? You did, Gil!<eos> You did!<eos> - Attaway, Bobby!<eos> - We hope so.<eos> - Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.<eos> - Christ, look.<eos> I just got to the ballpark. I'm really sorry, but I gotta go.<eos> - Really enjoyed talking to you.
- And his side lost? - Everything.<eos> Land and family.<eos> The very young ones and the very old ones.<eos> He buried his family and left his country forever.<eos> Now he hunts all over the world but he always returns here.<eos> He says Africa is the last good place.<eos> John?<eos> Will you exchange weapons with me?<eos> Mine's much more powerful.<eos> I won't be with you tomorrow.
What do you use 'em for?<eos> I use them to calm my mind and to purify my thoughts.<eos> Yeah, I use Jack Daniel's.<eos> We're tryin' to go to the same place.<eos> We're just using a different technique.<eos> Except I don't wear the bottle around my neck.<eos> That's because you'd lose your job if you did.<eos> Roden to 4 King 63.<eos> Just got a call from an informant who claims to have info on The Family Man.<eos> Says he'll only give it to you.
Claudia to quit being so much of the whore that she is.<eos> Roy told us how every time he wanted to quit, you wouldn't let him... how you quoted the Scriptures to give him strength.<eos> Yeah, son, he's told us everything.<eos> And we're mighty proud of you.<eos> What about the bank and the foreclosure?<eos> That's all been taken care of by Brother Roy and Sister Claudia.<eos> They put $500,000 in the bank.<eos> Our troubles are over!<eos> You guys!<eos> I'm going to have to watch you two.
We will never, never surrender!<eos> We will win!<eos> Democracy will survive!<eos> We will never, ever surrender!<eos> We will win!<eos> The eagle will be triumphant!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why?<eos> lsn't the universe big enough for both of us?<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Tell her you don't want her to catch it.<eos> - I have a sore throat and a fever.<eos> - Do you want me to handle it?<eos> Thanks, though.<eos> - I'm just trying to help out.<eos> - Is he safe with that?<eos> - We take the blade out.<eos> We shave him while he's sleeping.<eos> It's cute.<eos> All right, I'm counting on you.
- I love drawings.<eos> - I don't have a... - Oh, uh...<eos> Oh. OK.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Something like...<eos> Isn't that the little lost boy from this morning?<eos> With, uh...<eos> You know...<eos> You know... I can't do this now.<eos> And I can't go with you to Stamford now either.
And I can't go with you to Stamford now either.<eos> Yes, Mr. Leland, that is the little lost boy from this morning.<eos> Only he's not lost.<eos> He's my son.<eos> I have a child and he has a soccer game in 20 minutes.<eos> If he's late, he won't get the trophy.<eos> And since I'm in here with you, he'll probably be late.<eos> But what gets to me the most is, instead of crying about it he's out there with a big old smile blowing fish faces at us.<eos> Gentlemen, if you're smart, you will want me as much for my dedication and ability as for the fact that I am going to ditch you right now and run like hell across town so that my kid knows that what matters to me most is him.<eos> And, Mr. Leland, your real grounds for firing me should be if I were to stay here with you.
- Pink for flower?<eos> - Right.<eos> Why, then is my pump well flowered!<eos> O sure wit!<eos> Now art thou sociable.<eos> Now art thou Romeo!<eos> Now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature!<eos> Here's goodly gear!<eos> God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.<eos> I desire some confidence with you.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off.<eos> I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.<eos> Hello?<eos> What if this mixture do not work at all?<eos> Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?<eos> - What, are you busy?<eos> Need you my help?<eos> - No, madam.<eos> We have culled such necessaries as are behoveful for our estate tomorrow.<eos> So please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you.
It's a rule.<eos> Okay. lt is in the rule book.<eos> Una momento!<eos> We must confer.<eos> All right, troops. lt is for us to choose a battlefield that affords us-- l got it.<eos> Yes, Private Porkster?<eos> How about we challenge them to a spelling bee?<eos> Say we could have a bowling tournament.<eos> Suffering succotash!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Looney enough?<eos> Do you know what time it is?<eos> Seven-fift- - Seven-fift-- Quarter past seven.<eos> You have a baseball game in 5 minutes!<eos> Okay.<eos> Take this.<eos> is it safe?<eos> Yeah, put it in my bag.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I enjoyed playing with you.
I mean really bad.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Emergency.<eos> - Let me take you home.<eos> - Max, we're in the middle of a story.<eos> I can't just leave.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> I'll see you both back at the Planet in an hour.
What's with the water? It never got hot.<eos> Yeah, the water heater's busted.<eos> Now you tell me. So there's no hot water at all?<eos> Repair guy's coming this afternoon, so someone should be here.<eos> Hey, Jule, what was the name of that bookstore you said sells used textbooks?<eos> Bower Books, Market and 10th.<eos> Why?<eos> Cooper and I missed out on a few at the campus store.<eos> Gotta scavenge.<eos> Well, I'm kind of looking for some stuff too, so maybe I can come with you?
Staggering, isn't it?<eos> What do you say the first thing tomorrow we make them drive us to the closest bus station and we head home?<eos> What do I say?<eos> [WITH LOW VOICES] Yes!<eos> So how'd it go last night?<eos> Fine.<eos> Stay out real late?<eos> Yep.<eos> Claudia, could we just--?<eos> What? I mean, you don't-- You don't think I'm actually gonna have a conversation with you about Byron, do you?
No! Don't stop a-rockin'!"<eos> Dad, please.<eos> You're embarrassing us.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm teaching you about rock music.<eos> Now, Grand Funk Railroad paved the way forJefferson Airplane... which cleared the way forJefferson Starship.<eos> The stage was now set for The Alan Parsons Project... which I believe was some sort of hovercraft.<eos> Dad, no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands!<eos> You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!<eos> I'm just trying to party with you guys.
Is he dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> If this were the last level, I'd shoot you.<eos> But it's not, and I play by the rules.<eos> Please.<eos> We've got no fight with you.<eos> I'm gonna lower my gun, all right?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Wait.<eos> Please, let us come with you.
Now what?<eos> You are the Sisko.<eos> This is the one that was injured.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> And you gave me back my life, just as the texts foretold.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> To... prove to this nonbeliever that you sent me to put Bajor back on the right path.<eos> Please, tell him you chose me to be the Emissary.<eos> Tell that him that I fulfilled the ancient prophecies that I was the first to find the Celestial Temple.<eos> I was the first to meet with you.
I've heard lots of stories about the Dominion and the Founders and justice seems to be the last thing on their minds.<eos> Nevertheless, they're my people and I intend to accept their judgment.<eos> Report.<eos> Everything's status quo.<eos> If you want more details than that you'll have to ask our navigator.<eos> How much longer?<eos> You'll be informed when we reach our destination.<eos> We will be within transporter range of my world in less than an hour.<eos> After we have achieved orbit Odo and I will transport to the surface.<eos> Dr. Bashir and I will be joining you.
Oh, once we get to Risa, you won't even see us.<eos> There's no harm in sharing a runabout.<eos> I suppose not. Oh!<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> I'm going to go pack. Commander...<eos> Do not hug me.<eos> I promise we'll keep out of your hair.<eos> Good.<eos> Because we have much to discuss.<eos> I really wish I was going with you.
What happened to you two?<eos> We, um...<eos> Well, um, if you must know...<eos> No!<eos> No, uh...<eos> I don't need that image either.<eos> In fact, I'm going to stop asking that question altogether.<eos> People can come in, I will treat them and that's all.<eos> Please... have a seat.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
So I named my dog Queequeg.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I just realized something.<eos> - That's a bizarre name for a dog?<eos> - No.<eos> How much you're like Ahab.<eos> You're so consumed by your personal vengeance against life, whether it be its cruelties or its mysteries, that everything takes on a warped significance to fit your megalomaniacal cosmology.<eos> Are you coming on to me?<eos> It's just, the truth or a white whale - what difference does it make?<eos> Both obsessions are impossible to capture, and trying to do so will only leave you dead, along with everyone else you bring with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where...<eos> Dr Lloyd!<eos> I think this patient is finished.<eos> What else do you call it?<eos> When you're in your body and out of it at the same time,... ..unable to control your actions,... ..to stop yourself from doing what I did to that poor man?<eos> - What else do you call it?<eos> - Spirit possession or demon possession?<eos> While these mental states have been well documented,... ..they've been much maligned and haven't held up in court well as a criminal defence.<eos> I have advised my client against speaking to you.
Two of us, yeah. Well, right, but mostly Xena.<eos> Her.<eos> And we are truly grateful.<eos> But still, she may not stay here.<eos> The king and the raider, Cortese, are one and the same.<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> The king is at war with Cortese.<eos> Now we hear that the army is searching for you as well as the raiders.<eos> You'll get this village destroyed. We'll stay and we'll help you fight.<eos> Whatever it takes, we're with you.
Well...<eos> So long, Meg.<eos> So long, Joxer.<eos> Ditch the broads and double back. I'll leave the kitchen door open for you.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, Xena, Gabrielle, wait up!<eos> I... Listen!<eos> I got some things to... attend to.<eos> Fine.<eos> So, I won't be able to join you.
Instead of sweetening his brews, he kept adding more acid.<eos> - Nein! You won't find a more iconoclastic film in the Kennedy years... than his film One, Two, Three,<eos> It was an itsy-bitsy teenie-weenie ? a savage political farce that dared ridicule all ideologies at the height of the Cold War.<eos> If it isn't my old friends Hart, Schaffner and Karl Marx.<eos> - I see you bring blonde lady with you.<eos> - Ring-a-ding-ding! James Cagney plays a Coca-Cola executive who has enrolled his secretary... to hoodwink the Soviet commissars in East Berlin.<eos> To what do we owe this unexpected pleasure?<eos> - You're a trade commission.<eos> I thought we might trade.<eos> - Coca-Cola? No. But I hear you boys would like Fraulein Ingeborg to go to work for you.
Next caller, you're on the air.<eos> What about Lucy Shepherd?<eos> Is anyone concerned about this little girl?<eos> Can we now, finally, have a serious debate about family values?<eos> political polling analyst, Ed earl. With the president's job approval taking an eight-point dip... from his personal best of 63 percent three weeks ago... should the White House be concerned that the girlfriend factor... has left Shepherd vulnerable to the character questions... he was able to avoid three years ago?<eos> If they're not concerned, they oughta be.<eos> columnist Cynthia SkyIer, how will this new wrinkle... affect his ability to put together a win on his crime bill?<eos> When we come back... we're gonna meet a junior high school classmate of Sydney Wade's... who has some intimate details to share.<eos> I agree with you 110 percent, Mrs. Harper.<eos> That's why I'm up here in the winter talkin' about it with you folks.
Mum, that was loud.<eos> Here, hold my hand.<eos> I can't believe you did this four times.<eos> The worst part's over.<eos> It is?<eos> Listen, this doesn't stop for me until he lands on that aircraft carrier.<eos> Well, you just look so calm about it.<eos> If the flight surgeon had to okay me for this mission, I'd be grounded.<eos> - Mrs. Haise!<eos> - Can we speak to you?
- I don't want anything from you.<eos> You're not a man.<eos> And you're not my father.<eos> You're my son and you have always known my mind.<eos> - You deceived me.<eos> - You let yourself be deceived.<eos> In your heart, you always knew what had to happen here.<eos> At last, you know what it means to hate.<eos> Now you're ready to be a king.<eos> My hate... will die with you.
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.<eos> Show mercy, O thou great King, and win the respect of your own people.<eos> Even now you are incapable of mercy.<eos> And you...<eos> To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.<eos> Before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.<eos> You see?<eos> Death comes to us all.<eos> But before it comes to you, know this:<eos> Your blood dies with you.
Up in the sky<eos> Bye-bye!<eos> Hold it.<eos> Fatso, you smell something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, besides him.<eos> Hello?<eos> No need to be afraid.<eos> Yeah, right, don't be afraid.<eos> I'd like to make contact with you, but just one little thing, please.
He's reformed.<eos> He's a poet. Blah, blah, blah.<eos> Attention all ye folks, ye advocates of killers and child molesters.<eos> Ye cannot walk upon the high ground.<eos> Ye do not have the moral authority to walk there.<eos> Ye traverse with scum and scum is where--<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Forgive me for intruding but I haven't been able to get you and your wife out of my mind.<eos> I've been trying to call you, but there's been no answer.<eos> Can I please speak with you?
What's up?<eos> Me and my dad doing a little work.<eos> - Dwight.<eos> - How you doing, Glenn?<eos> - Very good.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Jesse's got some girlfriends, huh?<eos> - Several hundred.<eos> - What brings you by?<eos> - If it's okay, I'd like to talk with you.
You'll soon come across them.<eos> You take the pubs on the right, we take those on the left.<eos> At the end of the evening we'll meet back at the nick and compare notes.<eos> You'llsee enough to stuffthem, and what you don't see, you can guess.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> - What are you having?<eos> - Half a stout.<eos> - I don't like drinking, John.<eos> - Neither do I, but make an effort.<eos> CHARLIE: What's the matter with you two?
- Are you listening to me?<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> - Get your hands off me.<eos> - Or what? - I'm here, you're there ...<eos> - Make a move. man.<eos> You want to try me?<eos> Wallets, rings and watches.<eos> - Give up your shit.<eos> - Are you deaf?<eos> - I'm talking to you.
Come on, come on.<eos> Gather 'round.<eos> What are you people trying to do to me?<eos> We're not even in Washington yet, and we already have a a fatality!<eos> - Principal Moss?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Is there something I can help you with, Officer?<eos> I'm gonna need a number and an address<eos> - where I can get in contact with you.
- No idea.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hey. How are you?<eos> This is Bobbie.<eos> - This is Rebecca and Sam.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I was getting worried about you guys. What happened to this car?
Strike on the tinder, ho!<eos> Give me a taper!<eos> Call up all my people!<eos> This accident is not unlike my dream.<eos> Belief of it oppresses me already.<eos> Light, I say!<eos> Light!<eos> Get weapons, ho!<eos> Farewell, for I must leave you.<eos> The goodness of the night upon you, friends.
This accident is not unlike my dream.<eos> Belief of it oppresses me already.<eos> Light, I say!<eos> Light!<eos> Get weapons, ho!<eos> Farewell, for I must leave you.<eos> The goodness of the night upon you, friends.<eos> I pray you, sir, are you fast married?<eos> Sir, you've been hotly called for.<eos> Have with you.
O banish me, my lord, but kill me not!<eos> Down, strumpet!<eos> Let me live tonight.<eos> If you strive...<eos> But half an hour!<eos> - Being done, there is no pause.<eos> - But while I say one prayer!<eos> What?<eos> Not yet quite dead?<eos> Good my lord, I would speak a word with you.
Money!<eos> Come, now, Captain Benwick.<eos> Come, now. you will rally again.<eos> you must.<eos> you have no conception of what I have lost.<eos> yes, I have.<eos> - Good morning, Anne.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> We were just returning for breakfast.<eos> We shall join you.
No doubt the murderer's knife was dull and blunt Till it was sharpened on your stone-hard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs!<eos> Ma'am, I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours by me were harmed.<eos> Tell me, what state, what dignity, what honour Can you bestow on any child of mine?<eos> Even all I have yes, and myself and all Will I withal endow a child of yours.<eos> Be brief, lest that the process of your kindness Lasts longer telling than your kindness' date.<eos> Know, then, that with my soul I love your daughter And do intend to make her Queen of England.<eos> What? You?<eos> What think you of it?<eos> How can you woo her?<eos> Now, that would I learn of you.
My God, what a crew you Highlanders are.<eos> With your airs and honors, come begging £1,000 as if you were doing the lender a favor.<eos> Sheep shaggers, the lot of you.<eos> My mother could come no nearer than three candidates for my paternity.<eos> The Earl of Rutland. Now, there's a name for a whore master.<eos> A secretary to the Spanish Ambassador, whose name she hazarded as Ferdinando.<eos> And some young buck she never saw who raised her skirts at a masked ball.<eos> He ravished her?<eos> I would put it no higher than surprised.<eos> Archie, take me with you.

Take me away with you.
Take the boys and go to Morag's. She'll make a place.<eos> And let Montrose's troopers foul my house?<eos> No harm will come to you.<eos> Montrose's quarrel is with me.<eos> And you revel in it.<eos> The great man against all.<eos> And likely you'll slip down in the night when the mood takes you.<eos> Or will you just find yourself a sheep to comfort you?<eos> Aye, well, if I do, it will be one that doesn't bleat so bitter.<eos> No trouble between them and you.
Now I take it very serious.<eos> If it rains or there's lightning or thunder or if it snows, I have to jack off. Uh...<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Today's guest, Mrs. Maretto, is a representative of our local television station, WWEN.<eos> On-air correspondent.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Well, actually, I'm an on-air correspondent.<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> Anyway, Mrs. Maretto has asked to have a few words with you, and I know that while I'm gone you will give her your best attention.
Hurry up!<eos> "Begone, everyone who is proud, and bring him low...<eos> "...and tread down the wicked where they stand!"<eos> - This is the last of it.<eos> - All right, get going.<eos> "Bind their faces in the world below.<eos> "Then will I also acknowledge to you...<eos> "...that your own right hand can give you victory!"<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
Beauty is not the only virtue, Maria.<eos> She's just inherited a fortune of 10,000 pounds, I understand.<eos> Now that is a definite virtue!<eos> It is very hard, very hard. And I feel sorry for Lizzy, because she's done little to deserve it.<eos> For Wickham to pursue Miss King all the way to Barnet, just for her 10,000 pounds!<eos> I wish someone would die and leave me 10,000 pounds.<eos> Then all the officers would love me!<eos> I'm sure they would, Kitty dear, I'm sure they would.<eos> Did you think her pretty, mamma?<eos> No indeed, she has nothing to any of you.
And his double's gone through nearly a dozen times.<eos> Do you have something better to do?<eos> This wormhole must be carefully studied.<eos> All its permutations must be calculated.<eos> Fine, you work out the numbers.<eos> Quinn and I are going to take a spin around the universe.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Coming?<eos> Fine.<eos> Then, in the interests of science, I suppose I must go along with you for this joyride.
Ya probably wouldn't have had time for her, anyway.<eos> I've got a sporting proposition for you, Hercules.<eos> -You set this up, didn't you?<eos> -They only released me when I promised.<eos> Now, just listen, will ya?<eos> No, no, it's my turn, all right?<eos> Now ladies, no matter what you think..., ...I'm not opposed to pretty women.<eos> And I'm not opposed to having children, but if I'm going to become a father again..., ...the mother will be someone that I love.<eos> And I don't love any of you.<eos> I mean, I like to look at you..., ...and I might even like to talk to you if I didn't feel like I was always the fox and you were the hounds but... that's as far as my interest goes.
Oh, they forgot to take that thing with them.<eos> It seems to like you, Brother.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Hello, Quark.<eos> Odo, what are you doing here?<eos> Placing you under arrest for attempting to smuggle kemacite.<eos> Did you really expect me to believe that you were traveling all the way to Earth just to be nice to your nephew?<eos> You hid on board the ship.<eos> That's right.<eos> And now I'm stuck here with you.
Why?<eos> Well, this isn't the type of thing the FBI normally gets called in on.<eos> I got a feeling we're not being told the entire story.<eos> I've got the same feeling, Mulder.<eos> You think you can find out what's going on?<eos> I can try.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To see if I can get in the way.<eos> Hey, you girls go with Mom.<eos> I'll see you in a minute.
OK, Mrs McAlpin.<eos> First I thought I lost him.<eos> As if that wasn't hard enough to deal with!<eos> - Now they're saying he's killed Harry.<eos> - He said it himself.<eos> He signed the confession. I don't care.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Jack and Harry were friends.<eos> Mrs McAlpin, you said Private Dunham came here last night.<eos> What did he want? He was on his way to see you.
- Everything.<eos> My wife.<eos> My children.<eos> - And how did he do that?<eos> - How did...<eos> He burned them alive.<eos> Now he makes me suffer.<eos> Because he won't let me die.<eos> Agents Mulder and Scully?<eos> IVlay I have a word with you?
You have heard it said, "Do not commit adultery."<eos> Why don't you join us?<eos> But I tell you that any man who even looks at a woman with lust-<eos> You're welcome, brother.<eos> Has already committed adultery.<eos> Why do you follow him?<eos> He is leading us to something greater.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> This is a dangerous man.<eos> High Priest, Nicodemus is here to see you.
The people today- they called you king.<eos> They think you are a messiah.<eos> But you seem to ignore them.<eos> Aren't you going to be our king?<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> You are the Son of God.<eos> You can't have known this by what you know of me, Peter.<eos> It has been revealed to you by God.<eos> You are Peter, and on this rock... I will build my church.<eos> Tomorrow I will meet you on the other shore.
You know the way to where I'm going.<eos> We don't know where you're going.<eos> How can we know the way?<eos> I am the way, the truth... and the life.<eos> Take it.<eos> Eat.<eos> This- This is my body.<eos> This is my blood.<eos> Remember me... by doing this.<eos> I'm going to the Father. But I will always be with you.
No man is measured by the love he gives to others but by how much he is loved.<eos> Brother Cadfael, what a joy to see you!<eos> Welcome home again.<eos> So it seems if this reception is for me!<eos> Brother Cadfael!<eos> You dare to return on such a day as this, after all you have done?<eos> Father Prior, he's here.<eos> PRIOR: Father you are most heartily welcome home<eos> There's no-one here but rejoices to see you back among us.<eos> Indeed, Robert, I'm happy to be back with you, but I must inform all here that I am no longer your Abbot, only your brother.
Jessica, it's not their fault.<eos> I missed them and I sent for them.<eos> Here, you talk to Tum Tum.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> No.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> The tournament is going on right now in Koga.<eos> I want you to take this dagger and present it to the winner of the competition.<eos> -What about you?<eos> -I'll meet you in Koga.
"Nice to meet you."<eos> "Nice to meet you."<eos> Ow!<eos> Rocky loves Miyo!<eos> Rocky loves Miyo!<eos> Rocky loves Miyo!<eos> Grand Master say he will start your training today too.<eos> We're ready for him.<eos> You were a great help, Miyo.<eos> I wish I could go with you.
Koga!<eos> -Boys!<eos> -Grandpa!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> We're okay, Grandpa.<eos> What about you?<eos> Are they hurting you?<eos> Grandpa, get us out of here. Please?<eos> I'll try my best.<eos> Who's in there with you?
That's all right. Yes!<eos> Detective Fox, Miami Metro.<eos> Concerning that plane accident you're investigating.<eos> The other US Marshal on the plane has acquired some information.<eos> - The other Marshal? - That's correct.<eos> The young lady on the plane, she gave him a partial ID of one of the hijackers.<eos> A scar under his right eye.<eos> - I'm impressed. - Thank you.<eos> Not with you, with the other Marshal.<eos> Hang on, I wanna come with you.
They're gonna want more!<eos> - I mean, what woman wouldn't?<eos> - Yeah, they'll be back.<eos> And think how much better it'll be.<eos> Our clothes will be mended.<eos> - We'll eat better!<eos> - It'll be back to the way it should be!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Right.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Honey... it's probably...<eos> - We have an answering machine.<eos> Honey, it's probably Russell.<eos> He'll leave a message. He'll leave a nice, long message.<eos> Don't, don't, don't.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Sally Eastman.<eos> Russell!<eos> No, we were just talking.<eos> We were talking about what a lovely time we had at dinner with you.
What's so great about the water hole?<eos> I'll show you when we get there.<eos> Mom, can I go with Simba?<eos> What do you think, Sarabi?<eos> Well...<eos> -Please? -Please?<eos> It's all right with me.<eos> -Yeah!<eos> -All right!<eos> As long as Zazu goes with you.
Let's see what we got here.<eos> I got 1 7 here.<eos> $1 7?<eos> You owe me $8 for a month.<eos> -We'll settle that later.<eos> -You always cheat me.<eos> I can't believe you!<eos> Close enough.<eos> You came out better than you think.<eos> Nice working with you.
Nicole!<eos> Nicole, wait!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Gotcha! (Sniggers)<eos> Ow! Ow! Come on!<eos> Hello, Mother.<eos> Hello, dear.<eos> Can I come to the mall with you guys?
May they rest in peace.<eos> - So you're leaving us?<eos> - At daybreak.<eos> - How far do you think you'II get?<eos> - I'II figure something out.<eos> I don't have all the answers, but here there's help.<eos> You can have purpose.<eos> You can even have friends.<eos> Most people would call that a life.<eos> - I don't want a life with you.
Thanks.<eos> Have you seen Lassard?<eos> I have had it with you losers.<eos> I will capture Konali because I use my head.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> - Think we can lose him?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is possible you help me?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why don't you guys run along and I'll catch up with you later.
I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> We were both wrong.<eos> I know why my father left, Haoa.<eos> I understand.<eos> Then you're ready for this.<eos> Your wedding gift.<eos> Come with us.<eos> No.<eos> If I'd been braver, I would have gone with your father.<eos> Now I'm too old to go with you.
Your brothers, Guise...<eos> Your mother dislikes me.<eos> Yours hated me.<eos> Yours killed mine.<eos> There was no proof.<eos> - Scared of what?<eos> Who hates you, loves me.<eos> Then why make you marry me?<eos> For peace!<eos> I don't have to sleep with you!
What are you afraid of?<eos> You think he'll go to the authorities?<eos> You'll never hear from him again.<eos> He's probably right.<eos> We're not taking any chances.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - Think about this.<eos> - I have. No, you haven't.<eos> Well, look at all of you. Listen once. I'm going to say it once.<eos> I ain't going out with you no more.
It never belonged to us.<eos> It belonged to the town.<eos> What are you telling me?<eos> That you are going to be the first guy in history to get pinched... for putting money back into a vault?<eos> If I get pinched, I get pinched.<eos> That's the way that one went.<eos> I'm not gonna sit here and argue with you about it.<eos> - He's telling us what to do with our share of the money.<eos> - Put my share back.<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
Me either.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> No, no, wait.<eos> There it goes again.<eos> It's a very distinct thumping sound.<eos> Kind of like a boom, boom, boom.<eos> Don't you hear it?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We've been hearing that all night.<eos> Hey, can I share something with you?
No my Lord<eos> Pour me wine.<eos> These are your quarters, my Lady de Massard, for yourself and your maidservant.<eos> Right next door to your guardians, as I'm sure you would undoubtedly wish.<eos> As our saviour once said, "When I was a stranger, you made me welcome in your home."<eos> We hope that you'll be comfortable here, despite the... humble surroundings.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, we'll rest before vespers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God be with you.
- l've been watching you.<eos> - Should I be flattered?<eos> Martus Mazur, a refugee from the El-Aurian system.<eos> Everyone has to be from somewhere.<eos> Where are you from, Odo?<eos> - Don't pull that routine on me.<eos> - What routine?<eos> I know all about you El-Aurians.<eos> You're listeners.<eos> People like to talk to you.
- l've been looking over this collar.<eos> I thought if I replicated it I might be able to turn a tidy profit.<eos> I was surprised that there's nothing in here.<eos> It's just a complicated locking device.<eos> You could have used your telekinetic abilities at any time.<eos> - So, why didn't you? - You seem to know the answer.<eos> The Jem'Hadar wanted us to escape, didn't they?<eos> That was the plan: for us to bring you back here so you could spy on the Federation. Well done.<eos> - You're one of the founders?<eos> - You think they would bother with you?
Maybe you should take some time off. I've already lost too much time.<eos> - There it is. - Helicopter 1-6-7-2-8, Cascade tower.<eos> This was Firewalker's satellite relay.<eos> We installed field instruments all around this area.<eos> - Seismographs, tiltmeters...<eos> - We'll look around out here after we've checked inside.<eos> These instruments are worth millions of project dollars, and I'm accountable to the U.S.G.S. For every one of'em.<eos> Shouldn't we find the rest of the descent team first?<eos> I'll just take a quick damage survey.<eos> I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.
- He's burning up.<eos> - What is it?<eos> I can't tell whether it's an infection or a toxic reaction.<eos> - We've got to get him to a hospital.<eos> - I'll get a stretcher.<eos> - What about Trepkos?<eos> We can't just leave him. - Give me the short wave.<eos> This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker team.<eos> Come in, Search and Rescue. - You got him?<eos> You guys go ahead. I'll get O'Neil and meet you at the landing site.
- Mulder, this is intriguing, but there's a whole library of medical literature dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures.<eos> Now, Western medicine treats the human body in biochemical terms, right?<eos> But the body can also be treated as an electromagnetic system.<eos> So you think if Samuel can repair this energy field in order to heal, he can also destroy it in order to kill?<eos> Why not?<eos> OK. Say that Samuel's touch can kill.<eos> Why would he want to?<eos> Well, you heard him - he muddied the river of his own faith.<eos> That means he's...<eos> If you're available, the reverend would like to see you.
Officer Alfred Pamela, guard.<eos> Tracking.<eos> Live transmission diagnostic check, Warden William Smithers.<eos> Injuries: severe eye trauma, ruptured spleen punctured lung broken rib, internal bleeding.<eos> Condition critical.<eos> Vital signs failing.<eos> Imminent death.<eos> Subject deceased.<eos> 187, Warden William Smithers born February 14th, 1967 died August 4th, 2032.<eos> -What's the matter with all of you?
It will cost at least $ 100,000 to expand that psychotic malcontent's pen.<eos> God, I hate that whale.<eos> You got any leftover scraps I could take off your hands?<eos> Might have.<eos> I got a friend named Willy.<eos> Why would he want scraps?<eos> - He's a whale.<eos> - A whale?<eos> Hey, Jess!<eos> I'll meet you up there.
It is true.<eos> Paul, are you happy?<eos> And you, Cecile?<eos> Have not heard much their boyfriends.<eos> When we set the wedding date dao?<eos> But his aunt, hopefully end the strike.<eos> Enough to strike, let's talk about love.<eos> You are here.<eos> Apparently revealed to you.<eos> However I am willing to talk with you.
Promise one thing:<eos> Pa won't ever know.<eos> I promise.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Shopping.<eos> - I'll come, too.<eos> Stay and watch over Pa.<eos> If I stay here I'll go mad.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Cops. Forget about it.<eos> They squeeze the nickel till the buffalo shits.<eos> Cosa Nostra babies.<eos> Other babies, they're born, they cry, they go: "Wa-wa."<eos> Our kids, they cry. They go:<eos> "Wha?"<eos> My friend, Angie. Angie's father was on his deathbed.<eos> He calls his sons to him and says:<eos> "Put $100 in my coffin each year...<eos> "... in case, you know, you can take it with you."
I'm relaxed!<eos> It's too tight!<eos> It's too tight.<eos> I'm not struggling, all right?<eos> It's too tight.<eos> It's too tight.<eos> I can't...<eos> You two, come here.<eos> Come here a second.<eos> I want to talk to you!
- Alas, poor hurt fowl!<eos> But that my lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me!<eos> The prince's fool? Ha!<eos> I am not so reputed.<eos> It is the base, the bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out.<eos> Well, I'll be revenged as I may.<eos> Signior, where's the count?<eos> I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.<eos> I told him, and I think I told him true, that your grace had got the good will of this young lady.<eos> The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.
Yea, my lord, I thank it.<eos> Poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care.<eos> My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.<eos> And so she doth, cousin.<eos> Good Lord, for alliance!<eos> Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt.<eos> I may sit in a corner and cry, "Heigh-ho for a husband!"<eos> Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.<eos> I would rather have one of your father's getting.<eos> Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?<eos> The poison of that lies in you to temper.<eos> Gallants... I am not as I have been.<eos> So say I. Methinks you are sadder.<eos> I hope he be in love.<eos> Signior, walk with me.<eos> I have studied eight or nine wise words which these hobby-horses must not hear.<eos> For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!<eos> - My lord and brother, God save you. - Good evening, brother.<eos> - I would speak with you.
Half the payment now... half tomorrow, half on delivery.<eos> The price is not negotiable.<eos> The merchandise is satisfactory, yes?<eos> Good.<eos> Then we can do business.<eos> Use the Vista card.<eos> You get frequent flyer miles.<eos> The shipment will be prepared and boxed Friday evening... and ready for shipping Saturday morning.<eos> I need a signature and daytime phone number.<eos> It's a pleasure doing business with you.
I'm trying to find out. That's my craft.<eos> Were you seeing her, Jack?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, we got women dying all over the place around you, don't we, Jack?<eos> - Hey, fuck you, McCracken. - Hey, fuck you, Jack!<eos> Back off, McCracken, will you?<eos> - Take it easy, Jack.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - You tell him to take it easy.<eos> What's the matter with you guys? You know me.
Huh?<eos> Like Marios.<eos> Ingeniously.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look out!<eos> Elevator ingenious, Mario!<eos> Ingenious!<eos> I think you ought to know that Iggy and Spike have been preaching your overthrow at the Boom Boom Bar.<eos> Really?<eos> I am very disappointed in you, cousins.
All of you are brothers.<eos> The same blood runs through your veins... the blood of the greatest race on the face of this earth.<eos> Berger.<eos> I just wanted to say that... I guess I still have something to learn about boxing.<eos> You showed me that strength of spirit... can be just as powerful as technical skills.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> Look what we have done in just six short years.<eos> Every day you must carry it with you... the knowledge of who you are.<eos> You will carry it with you.
We liked your music.<eos> We only wanted to hear one good German song.<eos> There are no more German songs, only Nazi songs.<eos> Let's just go, Arvid.<eos> Wait a second!<eos> You want to hear a song for the Fatherland?<eos> Play it yourself.<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it!<eos> What's the matter with all of you?
- You're kidding. - Real milk.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> This looks great!<eos> - Yeah, thanks a million.<eos> You tryin' to depress everybody? You're gonna ruin their appetites.<eos> Mike, right?<eos> You wanna come to my party tomorrow? I'm gonna be 18 years old.<eos> You can come too, if you want to. I don't know you, but you can come.<eos> How nice to see so many of you here on this great day. This day marks the beginning of a new era for Endora... for the Burger Barn family and, I hope, for all of you.<eos> We at Burger Barn are committed... to a very special relationship with you, one that will last and last. In a time when so many things are falling apart...
Why were you chasing that man?<eos> Why did that man die in front of you?<eos> I request that you let me call Hong Kong.<eos> Master Hung, thank you for cooperating with us.<eos> That's what I should do.<eos> Why did you chase that person?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What's your relationship with that person?<eos> Tell me now!<eos> Was he working with both of you?
My computer crashed. I lost 40 pages.<eos> My son said he made a mistake. He shouldn't have been in a hospital.<eos> Mom.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You tell her parents you think I killed her. You embarrass me with her mother.<eos> I stayed in the hospital to calm down Jenny.<eos> Your girlfriend always try to commit you when things werert going too well?<eos> Or were you there because she drank and hit on other men?<eos> Your therapist tells us maybe you werert enough.<eos> Dr. Meade talked to you?
I've done a complete blood history.<eos> And you've got him on antibiotics?<eos> including cyclines and sulfas.<eos> And you got no response from white cell count or T-cells?<eos> That's right. Well, it doesn't make my life any easier.<eos> Watch out. Watch out.<eos> Get a urine sample.<eos> Marine veterinary medicine is about as sophisticated as voodoo.<eos> (Lansdowne) Nathan, why don't you all get a bite to eat in the kitchen.<eos> I'll find you later.
Well, what are you doing later?<eos> Elaine and I are having dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You can't believe this woman.<eos> She's one of these low-talkers.<eos> You can't hear a word.<eos> You're always going, "Excuse me?<eos> What was that?"<eos> - Maybe I'll meet you.
He's cool, he's sexy, he's 34 years old.<eos> Let's hear it for Kyle Darren!<eos> And here's country singing sensation Lurleen Lumpkin... fresh from her latest stay at the Betty Ford Clinic!<eos> What ya been up to, Lurleen?<eos> - I spent last night in a ditch.<eos> How about that, folks?<eos> Now I'd like to turn things over to our grand marshal... Mr. Leonard Nimoy.<eos> I'd say this vessel could do at least warp five.<eos> And let me say...<eos> 'May the force be with you.'
An order your Assembly barely listens to.<eos> So you come here for a more receptive audience.<eos> is that what your friend Vedek Bareil told you?<eos> He's as misguided as you are.<eos> No, that's not fair.<eos> You are not simply misguided, as I once thought.<eos> Now I see you want nothing less than to destroy us.<eos> - Destroy you?<eos> - You live without a soul, Commander.<eos> You and your Federation exist in a universe of darkness and you would drag us in there with you.
I only know they were members of something called the Dominion.<eos> - Did I wake you?<eos> - That's all right.<eos> Please come in.<eos> - Computer, lights on full.<eos> - l can come back.<eos> You've been so kind to me.<eos> How could I possibly refuse your company?<eos> Go back to bed.<eos> I'll join you again after I'm through.
HEY, I'M SORRY, MAN.<eos> GO.<eos> YOU'RE RIGHT.<eos> YOU CAN CAPTURE IT MUCH BETTER THAN ME.<eos> WE CAN SHARE...<eos> SO GO GET IT, IKE.<eos> GET IT GOOD.<eos> THANKS, DALTON.<eos> CHANGE OF PLANS, MEN.<eos> I'M COMING WITH YOU.
I hope you didn't let anyone in here.<eos> Why don't you clean up a bit?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> After the attack on foreigners by racist football fans, 60 foreigners fled.<eos> When did the whole gang arrive?<eos> Evi came over around six with the canapés.<eos> And then most of the others, later, at eight.<eos> And she called beforehand?<eos> And?<eos> She said she had tried to reach you.
I'd written a poem about autumn.<eos> A thousand leaves mingle<eos> In the misty breeze<eos> Plump brown chestnuts<eos> Pummel the ground, Yet I remain unharmed.<eos> Th cold spews scorn At summer's dying twitch,<eos> Which with a last lazy stroke warms my limbs aching from another assault<eos> Without trumpets or banners, See it, here it comes.<eos> The splendid autumn.<eos> Valerie's not with you?
That's it!<eos> Finally, a lead!<eos> Where?<eos> They're mocking me!<eos> Shit!<eos> How was your trip, sir?<eos> Useful, Minh, as always.<eos> China is a great reservoir.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm talking to you.
Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.<eos> Upstairs, downstairs in his nightgown.<eos> Crawling through the window. At the end of Miss Emma's street.<eos> Her god has gone and left his home.<eos> So what the hell you're doing grabbing that phone?<eos> -Sorry. -Anything?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We'd have a better chance if we tapped into the main junction box.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Sanderson.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
That's the way it used to work.<eos> I did everything I could to make this country work.<eos> I went to war.<eos> I became a cop.<eos> And yes, I did terrible things and I called it justice.<eos> Things that if you knew, if you really knew me, you'd be gone.<eos> Man is a sick animal, and this is a sick man.<eos> And he needs to be put down.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Sam, I'm not gonna fight you.
So you need to go to the dentist.<eos> Yeah, and both my passports are expired.<eos> What's your bad news?<eos> - I got laid off.<eos> - What?<eos> The restaurant's closing for six weeks for renovations.<eos> And they're not paying you during the down time?<eos> They're only carrying the employees they can't afford to lose.<eos> Oh, well, then you're out.<eos> I'd like to argue with you, but yeah.
Furry bastard wouldn't give me the time of day.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Adam and I are watching...<eos> What are we watching?<eos> "Every Which Way But Loose"<eos> Oh, yeah, with the monkey.<eos> It's an orangutan.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Right.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute in private?
There is nothing wrong with my tennis coach.<eos> You just got lucky.<eos> You're right.<eos> Three sets in a row.<eos> I think we're done for today.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So as of now, I'm off the clock?<eos> You are off the clock.<eos> So I can speak to you as a friend.
This is my kind of fight-- a beat down!<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> I'm Goliath!<eos> I built this while working for you, Mr. Stark, and you thanked me by firing me.<eos> Just 'cause I have trouble with my temper?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wonder where I got that idea.<eos> And for the record, I fired you for babbling about my secrets.<eos> I see you haven't changed.<eos> Hate to do this to you, but I have to scatter your atoms.
And you, huh,<eos> I should've known from day one you'd screw this up.<eos> Arthur Davidson, head of sales and marketing.<eos> - You ungrateful...<eos> Hey! You stay out of this!<eos> This is a Davidson matter.<eos> Quiet down there!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stop it, or I'll knock your heads together.<eos> That goes for you, too, Bill Harley.
See how it feels.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mose found a "T"?<eos> Ah, look at that.<eos> Thing of beauty.<eos> Five days.<eos> All right.<eos> I had a bad day.<eos> That's no excuse.<eos> Should never have yelled at you like that, okay?
You're making me nervous.<eos> What is taking her so long?<eos> Mr. Moran?<eos> Yes?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I, uh, have a couple of questions for you now. Of course, yes.<eos> Ask away.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I'll be right with you.
Obsessed with Lucas.<eos> I don't know what to do with my life.<eos> That's understandable. The main thing is not to be alone.<eos> You need your friends around you. And you can rely on your family.<eos> That's what the injured are told, that families can help heal wounds.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Anyway, my family is falling apart because I'm no longer what it expects.<eos> The great enthusiast, full of plans.<eos> My family can't bear to see me become weak.<eos> I'm not at all worried about you.
Can you read?<eos> - Shall we help you?<eos> Suck-up!<eos> Hello.<eos> Sélim Oujdi.<eos> Voted.<eos> Since when did you vote?<eos> Since I dated the mayor's daughter.<eos> Say that again.<eos> She's over you, Éric.
Cosini?<eos> Oh, the guy you introduced me to who's got you by the balls.<eos> Have you fucked him?<eos> What are you insinuating?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just asked if you'd fucked him.<eos> Yes.<eos> I bet it didn't stop there.<eos> No.<eos> We organized a threesome, with you in the middle.
He gave me his word.<eos> That's like a contract with God.<eos> He's rounding up his team.<eos> He plans to take over your business.<eos> There's no banker and no fall guy, so you've got no restaurant.<eos> You know how it is with us.<eos> As long as nobody dies, we can talk.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> There's no time for talking.<eos> I came to see you because I like you.

One, two, three?<eos> How many married men was it, Zadie?<eos> I wouldn't have picked the Prospect 3 case because Wallace prosecuted it.<eos> He's the sitting D.A. He set up the unit.<eos> Hayes didn't care, and two innocent men got out of jail.<eos> You're not confirming the rumor, are you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Hayes Morrison doesn't deserve to run the CIU.<eos> Wallace doesn't agree with you.
I'm not.<eos> Hayes Morrison doesn't deserve to run the CIU.<eos> Wallace doesn't agree with you.<eos> I might not, either.<eos> You are a really good guy, Sam.<eos> That's it?<eos> We're done?<eos> And I'm a really good reporter.<eos> Eventually, I'll break this story.<eos> I just hope I don't smash CIU or you in the process.
Yeah. I agree.<eos> All right.<eos> Have a good time, boss.<eos> Not your boss, 'cause you're not on the team.<eos> Hi!<eos> You've reached Linda.<eos> I'm out and about, so leave a message.<eos> Hi, uh, uh, Linda, this is Walter... O'Brien...<eos> Uh, you came by my place of work the, uh, other day to talk about a date, so I'm just, calling you... up to arrange the... the date.<eos> So I look forward to discussing that with, you.
If you found an alternative cause of death, why didn't you disclose it?<eos> Could this have cleared Penny?<eos> Tess. My contract with the defense forbade me from revealing any findings, and the defense had no obligation to reveal any information that would not benefit their clients.<eos> My findings did not.<eos> What did you find? Owen died as a result of an insulin injection.<eos> This wasn't an accident.<eos> DAYS REMAINING<eos> Owen's death was not from soy sauce.<eos> He was injected with a fatal dose of insulin.<eos> Uh, I think our brother wants you.
The person I told this morning wasn't exactly supportive, so...<eos> And how was your breakfast this morning?<eos> It went really well.<eos> I can tell that's 100% not true.<eos> Okay, are you two, like, legit fighting?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just...<eos> Audrey has some unflattering opinions about my dad, that's all.<eos> No, they're memories, not opinions.<eos> And, sometimes, maybe people are going through big things that have absolutely nothing to do with you, Emma.
I'm dying to have you over.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Really, it's like there's makeup on top of blue ink.<eos> It's called a suntan, guys, I mean... (laughs) You never seen a suntan before?<eos> TODD: So, uh, Gail and I had sex twice, right before I came over.<eos> She had me trying out some new maneuves, and we did that thing where, uh, you hold the woman upside down around the waist, uh...<eos> God, I know there's a name for it... uh, it was...<eos> Todd, I don't...<eos> I don't want to talk about that.<eos> Well, I-I just want to be completely honest with you, hon, because, uh, Gail said that that's the only way that this is gonna work.
No, the fourth one.<eos> Mike!<eos> I didn't even hit you with the sand, man!<eos> Mike, you can't get me back for something I didn't do!<eos> Come on, man!<eos> (sobbing) I didn't do anything!<eos> Mike!<eos> TANDY: Mike, you in here?<eos> - Hey, Tandy. - (shrieks)<eos> I'm worried about you, you're not looking good.
Right?<eos> We got to share things, hot water and hats.<eos> Hell, the other day he took one of my beers, you didn't see me complaining.<eos> Those were my beers.<eos> Exactly, we get it.<eos> I'm sorry he's so annoying.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> I was talking to the dog.<eos> Look, don't let this hat thing with your brother ruin opening day, all right?<eos> He's just messing with you.
He's just messing with you.<eos> Yeah, I wish that's what he was doing.<eos> But that would require him actually thinking about another human being.<eos> Hey, Rooster, I found your hat!<eos> You did?<eos> No!<eos> I'm too busy bonding with Dad!<eos> Mom just told me you're actually adopted!<eos> Come on.<eos> Your brother really cares about you.
Hey.<eos> I'm Dion's partner.<eos> [Tommy] And a huge fan.<eos> I, uh, I brought something for you.<eos> That's a 2009 Bâta- [together] Bâtard-Montrachet.<eos> Yeah, I got... 20 cases of this stuff in the cellar.<eos> Great. It'll have some friends.<eos> What's this about, guys?<eos> Pretty busy.<eos> Yeah, well, w-- w-- we-- we wanted to talk to you, uh, 'cause me and Tommy are opening up a restaurant in the Bronx.
No one else gets hurt. You understand?<eos> [panting]<eos> I want you to see something.<eos> Nice view, huh?<eos> I know the developer.<eos> Lease is mine if I want it.<eos> Prime real estate, minutes from Manhattan, to lure a distinguished clientele.<eos> Wh- - What?<eos> You owe me 600 grand. Plus market value of the coke you robbed Patrick to pay... Patrick.<eos> A restaurant in this location with you at the helm, we could gross 50 Gs a night.
Your mom and I are gonna take care of you. No.<eos> Marisa.<eos> Now is not the time for your stubborn bullshit.<eos> I am a grown woman. A grown pregnant woman who needs to sleep in her own bed.<eos> Now, you are welcome to stay here if you want to until I get a security system, but under one condition.<eos> Promise me that you will back off Patrick Woichik.<eos> All right.<eos> You got my word.<eos> Chef?<eos> He wants to talk to you.
No, he's not-- he's not back h-- [sighs] Wait, I think I know where he is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, there's the man!<eos> Dion, who you got back there?<eos> - Yeah, tell her to come on out.<eos> - Nice. Yeah, real good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> A little less talking, and a little more work, please.<eos> Hey, Chef, there's someone here to see you.
- Yeah, tell her to come on out.<eos> - Nice. Yeah, real good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> A little less talking, and a little more work, please.<eos> Hey, Chef, there's someone here to see you.<eos> [Tommy] Can't just leave school, Teej.<eos> Having a bad day?<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> [Giordano] Alls you gotta do - is get him to meet you there, okay?
He's really been missing you.<eos> I wanted to remind him that you're always here, watching over us.<eos> Hey, you uh, mind waiting over on the bench for me?<eos> Just need a moment with your mom, alone.<eos> So... just so you know...<eos> I know.<eos> I'm not sure how long Dion was gonna keep it from me.<eos> Probably forever.<eos> And you... [scoffs] You sure as hell wouldn't have to tell me, right?<eos> You cheat, you die... you take the betrayal to the grave with you.
[Dion] Wow. He's a keeper, huh?<eos> Wow, that's your son, man.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> T... that's your boy.<eos> What is it, all right?<eos> You're about to get busier.<eos> - It's on.<eos> - What is?<eos> [Giordano] You know what is.<eos> Call the Tooth Fairy, tell him to meet you under the Willis Avenue Bridge. 11:00 p.m.
Okay, enough!<eos> I'll decide what to do about my son.<eos> You know, Andre's in a lot of trouble with the police... for something he didn't do.<eos> I just want you to know, I'm really disappointed.<eos> And I'm gonna have to-- gonna have to do something.<eos> I told you.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I've let it go.<eos> I swear.<eos> I understand, but this isn't about you.
Weapons on the ground now.<eos> Now!<eos> This one.<eos> Get him in the truck.<eos> Why not both of us?<eos> Get a two-for-one?<eos> One is plenty. Easy.<eos> Sudden movements are contagious.<eos> You jump, I jump... that's how people get shot.<eos> Don't worry, I got you, G.
Nate's a master of the psyche, so he's gonna go deeper.<eos> Which means if this thing goes bad, it's gonna be disastrous.<eos> Living the lie.<eos> The longer it goes, the worse it gets.<eos> Yeah. How do you know when to drop it?<eos> Well, unfortunately, that's the problem, is you don't.<eos> I just keep thinking that Nate doesn't have all of the pieces and so he's just jammed until he does.<eos> At least that's what I'm hoping.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to you, Nate?
It's a lot of decay.<eos> Whoever he is, he's been dead a long time.<eos> How long?<eos> 100 years, maybe more. Mm-hmm.<eos> I won't know until further analysis, and Sebastian can do a DNA cross-check, see if we can identify him.<eos> Yeah, it might help us figure out why the assailant wanted him so badly. Hopefully find him. Yeah, and when we find him,<eos> I got a little score to settle with him.<eos> You okay?<eos> Why's everyone keep asking me that?<eos> 'Cause everyone cares about you, caveman. How you sure you didn't crack a rib or something?
Malasadas, garlic shrimp, local grown coffee, shave ice.<eos> Ooh, shave ice.<eos> Sounds delicious. How you gonna ship that?<eos> Well, it's still in RD.<eos> Which is what I'd be using your capital for.<eos> Let me explain something to you, big fella.<eos> I have not one, but two kids that have to be put through college.<eos> All of my capital is going right into that bottomless pit.<eos> Bruddah, if you had a chance to get in on the ground floor of Google, you would of taken it, right?<eos> Yes, and what does that have to do with you?
Murphy Station?<eos> Why?<eos> Black Dog Station.<eos> New mission. Wow.<eos> Russell has got to stop with the code names.<eos> What's the objective?<eos> Intel has located some surviving members of Hizb al-Shahid in Libya and Algeria.<eos> Seems that's where they decamped after the drone attacks.<eos> They want us to finish the job.<eos> Well, look, Jose, as much as I enjoyed almost dying with you...
They're... they're putting together another anti-terror work group.<eos> But you wanted to.<eos> And now you feel like you can't.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> We actually have jobs that make a difference in the world and we're giving them up?<eos> For what?<eos> For county fairs and billionaire dinners?<eos> That's just the campaign.<eos> The job is still kind of important.<eos> Do you remember what Conrad said when he first talked to you about secretary of state?
If elected to a second term,<eos> I vow to prepare the United States for a changing world.<eos> Changing rapidly due to a warming climate and shifting global allegiances.<eos> I will do this against all opposition, including inside my own party.<eos> Because as President Lyndon Johnson said when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, risking his party's political future to do the right thing,<eos> "What the hell's the presidency for?"<eos> Looks like he forgives you.<eos> What the hell has he done?<eos> I think this is premature.<eos> Let us sit down with you.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I've been sober a little more than three years.<eos> Now I'm not addicted to anything except yoga.<eos> But that's okay 'cause what kind of trouble could I get into lying on the floor, all sweaty, pushing my body to its limits?<eos> I'm also stretching my mind.<eos> I've gone back to school.<eos> I'm pursuing a law degree, which was scary at first 'cause I'm usually the oldest one in my class.<eos> But that doesn't stop all those hot young college guys from, you know... copying off my homework.<eos> I love fighting with you.
Well, I'll do what I can.<eos> Meanwhile, we can't have folks thinking that we're afraid, too.<eos> We need to protect our people.<eos> No, we need to protect our image.<eos> Next to Mardi Gras and Halloween,<eos> Fall Fest is the biggest week of the year for us.<eos> I mean, we can't have folks hiding inside their houses.<eos> Got to get out.<eos> We need them outside.<eos> I'm counting on you, Dwayne.
I'm not disappointed in her.<eos> I'm disappointed in myself.<eos> I should've paid more attention.<eos> I should've seen this coming.<eos> So what, now you want to take on her problems, too?<eos> No, it's not that. It's just that maybe I could've done something.<eos> Maybe I could've talked her out of it.<eos> If I'd, if I'd...<eos> Dwayne.<eos> What she did and why she did it had nothing to do with you.
Stick is dead!<eos> After that, the hackers cut the comms.<eos> Best tech minds in the government couldn't crack it.<eos> Uh, we're the best tech minds in the government.<eos> You being smart with me?<eos> Actually, we're smart with everybody.<eos> The world's superpower can't control its aviation, I'm getting sass from this guy and a giant baby in his underwear?<eos> They don't mean any disrespect.<eos> It's just them being themselves.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
How so?<eos> Hey. Did you, uh, mess with my marriage records?<eos> Absolutely I did.<eos> You want Toby to find out who you're really married to?<eos> Just focus on the matter at hand.<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Guys, we could use all hands on deck. Right.<eos> And we are right here with you, Walter.
Absolutely I did.<eos> You want Toby to find out who you're really married to?<eos> Just focus on the matter at hand.<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Guys, we could use all hands on deck. Right.<eos> And we are right here with you, Walter.<eos> I just need everyone fixed on-on the case.<eos> And like I said, we are right here with you. Okay?
I am not gonna abandon you guys.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Hey, found more on El Skunko.<eos> Latest arrests: four in the last two months, all for gambling.<eos> All out of one building in a slum in the Nadezhda area of Sofia.<eos> I'll send the address.<eos> So, what are we supposed to do when we get there?<eos> Just politely ask to meet the Skunk?<eos> That's like walking into Little Italy and asking to see Don Corleone.<eos> You got to make him want to talk to you.
He plays today.<eos> I want back my lev.<eos> I think you might need to find another math genius to help you win back your lev. Okay?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kid, these Bootleggers have taken out a fighter jet, controlled four Navy destroyers, and now they have a sub with nukes on it.<eos> We're talking the balance of the free world here, Sly.<eos> So, pretend to scratch your ear and take your comm out.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> It can't be found on you.
All right.<eos> Papa Carpinni's.<eos> You better not have messed with my garlic bread.<eos> Hey. Glad you guys are home again.<eos> Good to be home.<eos> Minute to talk?<eos> Sure.<eos> So, uh, earlier today,<eos> Tim wanted to knock your head off.<eos> And I stood up for you, not because you're right, but because I care for you, and I know how bad it hurts to lose a woman you have feelings for.
That was one hell of a robbery yesterday.<eos> But you left evidence at the motorcycle shop and at the scene.<eos> So I'd like to introduce my partner to you, who doesn't trust anybody and is a master at karate.<eos> Once again, that is Japanese.<eos> Either way, he'll break you.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> No.<eos> - I have no more questions.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Man, can I speak to you outside?
And you pronounced it wrong.<eos> It's actually Badass Cop.<eos> The, uh, the T-shirts were delivered to the billing address, here.<eos> And they all very clearly read...<eos> "Asscop".<eos> She said no refunds.<eos> And it was expedited.<eos> The charges for the T-shirts and a new cake for Diane will be deducted from your next paycheck.<eos> You may go.<eos> Lee, I'm going to be honest with you.
You know, for years now, no matter what I've done, I'm always the forgotten one at this department.<eos> You know, and it sucks, man.<eos> I mean, when I first got this job, I mean, I made goals for myself.<eos> Attainable goals.<eos> You know, graduate top of the class at the academy, make detective.<eos> Have a statue erected of me at Parker Center.<eos> Those are attainable goals?<eos> I haven't figured out all the details, all right?<eos> But look, I'm not finished.<eos> I learned something important from you.
How many times are we gonna listen to this message from Future Barry?<eos> Until it make sense.<eos> So, forever is basically what you're saying.<eos> You haven't spoken to anyone else about this? - No.<eos> We agreed that we wouldn't.<eos> And yet, I find myself asking.<eos> Martin?<eos> Sara. W-what can I do for you?<eos> You never call me Sara.<eos> Everything with you is Ms. Lance.
I've been terrified that I have nothing to offer the team.<eos> But you have to get over your fears if we're gonna survive this.<eos> We've only seen these things downwind from here.<eos> We can pick them off in this valley until they're all gone.<eos> I got my best men on the ridge to the West.<eos> But reports are, they are running out of ammunition.<eos> What?<eos> Helps me think.<eos> Well, without ammo, we can't take all these zombies out, even with perfect shots.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Make changes we can control.<eos> What you're talking about can't be done.<eos> It's... it's like playing God, and it goes against everything we're trying to do.<eos> I thought we were trying to help people.<eos> We're helping by fixing aberrations, not creating them.<eos> You're not thinking fourth dimensionally.<eos> Did you really just use Doc Brown on me?<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Sarah, come on, you can't be Switzerland on this one.<eos> In my heart, I agree with you... but that's not what Rip entrusted us to do.
The only reason I could ever see her not being<eos> Oh, my God, you and Rex Tyler were together.<eos> - No.<eos> - They were together, weren't they?<eos> - This makes total sense.<eos> - We weren't together.<eos> Like I said before, fraternization among teammates is unprofessional.<eos> Rex and I were going to leave the JSA after the war, try and start a new life with each other.<eos> And then he was cut down.<eos> That's why I left the team, and that's why I wouldn't talk to you about them.
And then, hopefully, through the act of living we discover who we truly are and learn to grow from that.<eos> Amaya got us invites to the State Dinner.<eos> Are you feeling up to it?<eos> Yes, I'm feeling much better.<eos> You feeling up to it?<eos> I think what he means is:<eos> are you gonna create a diplomatic crisis and risk unknown damage to history by killing Damien Darhk?<eos> I know what he means, Ray.<eos> Earlier, you accused me of not ever caring for anyone, but you know that's not true.<eos> I care very much about you.
But when the chips were down and all hope seemed lost, we could always count on Henry to lift our spirits.<eos> That's the kind of man your grandfather was.<eos> Then take me back there now.<eos> I will get your item back for you.<eos> The Legends have left 1987.<eos> The item is beyond your reach.<eos> That blonde woman, she's a time traveler like you.<eos> She knows what happens to me in the future.<eos> - I'm sure she does.<eos> - Then take me with you.
But don't let it control you either.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Believe me, i know a thing or two about controlling wild beasts.<eos> - Oh, there you are.<eos> So I've been thinking about your memory flashes.<eos> "Manopause" moments, or whatever it is you want to call 'em.<eos> I got a theory.<eos> What if when you interacted with your younger self in 1987, you- inadvertently changed my past so--so that my memories from my new life are supplanting the memories from my old life, thus creating temporal dissonance.<eos> - Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.<eos> - Oh, it's a brilliant theory, which I happen to share with you, but it doesn't explain- who the mystery lady is.
Pass.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I'm with him, mostly 'cause I just don't want to lose my geek cred, but time travel!<eos> I could take Amaya and Mick.<eos> Do it.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> And, uh, the new president called, which would be cool under different circumstances, but she wants to meet with us.<eos> Let's bring Ray and Sara as backup.<eos> What about me?<eos> I can do backup.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
It's just that, when I last left 2016, that young woman did not exist.<eos> Wait, you're saying Lily belongs to another timeline?<eos> That, when Barry created Flashpoint, she...<eos> Unfortunately, this is all my fault.<eos> You see, a month ago, I interacted with my younger self back in 1987 and unwittingly motivated him...<eos> Me...<eos> To sire a child.<eos> So it's because of my carelessness that this Time Aberration exists.<eos> She is not an Aberration.<eos> She is brilliant and funny and a lot like you, just a little less uptight.
Still waiting on that signal.<eos> Do it!<eos> Done.<eos> - It's working.<eos> - What about the superhero bomb?<eos> I can't!<eos> I can't do it!<eos> You must, Jefferson.<eos> I have a daughter.<eos> Her name is Lily, and she's counting on you.
- I'll suit up.<eos> - I know how to get Sara away from fake Stein.<eos> What about that speedster gun?<eos> Yeah, I'm already on it.<eos> Martin, you've been acting pretty different ever since Darhk tortured you.<eos> Did they offer you a deal like they did me?<eos> Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?<eos> My daughter?<eos> Sara, uh, Jackson and I were just on the bridge, and...<eos> He wanted to talk to you about ship stuff.
Nice job with, uh, Thief.<eos> - Uh, give me a lift to CCU?<eos> - Sure.<eos> So you're still taking engineering classes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, cool.<eos> All right, well, good...<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Are you trying to make me as mad at you as I am at him?
Yeah, I did.<eos> He also tell you it didn't go so well?<eos> It's only been a few months since Dante was killed by that drunk driver.<eos> I'm sure he just needs a little bit more time.<eos> Wait, why is he so mad at me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm staying out of that.<eos> Cait, he'll... he'll barely look at me unless other people are in the room.<eos> Maybe it's just easier when the rest of us are around.<eos> Do you think maybe you could convince him to come with you to my house for dinner tonight?
Maybe it's just easier when the rest of us are around.<eos> Do you think maybe you could convince him to come with you to my house for dinner tonight?<eos> - Why?<eos> - So I can try to fix things between us, maybe between Joe and Iris, too.<eos> Just all of us together again in one room and try to work this out once and for all.<eos> Think you can do that?<eos> Okay. But how are you gonna get Joe and Iris there?<eos> Joe?<eos> Hey, Joe.<eos> Um, so I talked to Iris and she just has a few things that she wants to say to you.
You see, what does matter is that I know your little secret.<eos> You changed the timeline.<eos> Because if I recall correctly, the only Speedsters in my other life were me and that smartass Kid Flash, until you showed up and stole everything from me!<eos> I didn't steal anything from you, Clariss. I...<eos> I was just trying to put things back to the way they're supposed to be.<eos> This is how my life is supposed to be!<eos> For years, I felt like something was missing.<eos> And now I know why.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to do this to you.
At least, that's what The Flash called him last night when he took him into Iron Heights. - I thought you might want to see it.<eos> You know, to do with your other case.<eos> Actually it turns out there was no connection.<eos> You know, I have to ask you. Hm?<eos> - How did you know his name? - What?<eos> Yesterday, you came in and you asked for Edward Clariss' report, but I didn't tell you who that husk belonged to, so that means you stole a sample when you showed up to my crime scene.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> You've really got this good guy routine thing down, haven't you?<eos> And everyone just buys it.<eos> There is something not right about you, Allen.
This is about that other timeline, isn't it?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I think you should keep an eye out.<eos> - Where's dinner?<eos> - It's almost ready, John.<eos> I work hard every day to provide for this family, and this is what greets me?<eos> An empty table?<eos> Just five more minutes.<eos> I'm hungry now!<eos> And you speak when you're spoken to, girl.
No, no, no, stop.<eos> - You're a liar!<eos> - Julian! - You're a meta-human.<eos> - Stop, no, stop!<eos> You put your foster father in the hospital, didn't you?<eos> - No, no!<eos> - Didn't you?<eos> Didn't you?<eos> Oh, I wanted to do more than hurt him.<eos> Now I'm gonna do the same to you.
Firm but reassuring.<eos> Cuts to the point.<eos> I don't think I know that one.<eos> Yeah, I didn't use it on you.<eos> Wally's different than you, Barry.<eos> You're like a second... daughter.<eos> You over-share your feelings.<eos> Him, I got to be a little more nuanced.<eos> Ah!<eos> Cool. I'm messing with you.
Right.<eos> You're not Barry.<eos> Let me talk to her this time.<eos> She's still here.<eos> I can feel Frankie trying to stay in control.<eos> You said I could beat her.<eos> What I said was I'd return to you the power you had to inflict your pain upon others.<eos> But I need Frankie gone to do that.<eos> Do you remember why you came to me?<eos> I came to you because you showed me a way to stop him from hurting me.
Hey, so, where... where did you go yesterday?<eos> I didn't want to interrupt your training.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, well, looks like there won't be much of that anymore, now that my dad is getting everyone to talk me out of using my powers.<eos> Wait, that...that's not why you're here, right?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is all me.<eos> You all right?<eos> You know, when this whole thing happened to me, you were... you were actually the first person I wanted to call.<eos> Yeah, I was sort of hoping it happened to you too.
But you can.<eos> They did it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay. It's gonna be okay.<eos> So no one else got hurt?<eos> Luckily, no.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> What about John?<eos> The DA's prosecuting him for what he did to you.
Yeah, but the only problem is, Scudder's not gonna find him.<eos> Snart's gone.<eos> What do you mean, he's gone?<eos> He's gone.<eos> I thought I...<eos> Oliver told me that Snart left with some friends of ours on a... trip.<eos> I don't even want to know.<eos> One of Snart's old crew is at Iron Heights. I'll go see if I can talk to her.<eos> Okay, I'll see if I can locate any others at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> Actually... I'm sorry, I just... I need to talk to you about something really quick.
- Yeah, that's it.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now... we go get a Big Belly burger.<eos> - That's insane.<eos> What a rush.<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, it took me a while to get used to it.<eos> I can't believe you're not sick at all.<eos> I must have an iron stomach.<eos> Okay, so you're telling me that Barry has never taken you on a run?
It's me. It's my problem.<eos> I've just been feeling nervous about this new dynamic between the three of us.<eos> I-I don't know. I have everything that I have ever wanted right now.<eos> And I've never had that in my life.<eos> In a lot of ways, it's scarier than having nothing, because... it's easier to fail than succeed.<eos> And I really want to succeed.<eos> What could you possibly be laughing about right now?<eos> I am so sorry, Barry.<eos> You are really sweet.<eos> But it is weird talking to you through a mirror and a speaker, and I really want to kiss you right now.
I was...<eos> I... Yes, okay.<eos> Look, hey, man, so I know that... you and I, we got off on the wrong foot. We never managed to find the right one, and I'll take that.<eos> That's probably my fault, but I just...<eos> I don't want things to be like that anymore, you know?<eos> I... I'd... like it if things changed.<eos> It's funny, 'cause I remember you saying something similar to that right before you stole the case from underneath me.<eos> Do you have idea what it's like to work side by side with someone with such little regard for the rules?<eos> You may very well be contaminating my work.<eos> That's exactly why I want to learn from you.
Yeah, well, there's a lot of scared people with this monster running around the city.<eos> Oh, we'll get him.<eos> We always do. Oh, yeah? Is that a quote I can use for my article?<eos> No.<eos> All right. It was worth a try.<eos> Dad, you know Wally and I are all right, right?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> We just don't want you to not do things because of us.<eos> You know, we just want you to... find someone.<eos> I'm not having this conversation with you.
Well, this should come as a welcome surprise.<eos> You've been reassigned to meta-human crime scene investigation full-time.<eos> Full-time?<eos> We're pouring all the resources we can into figuring out this husk problem, especially considering the last one turned out to be that evil speedster, The Rival.<eos> Any questions, concerns, you guys direct them to Judge Hankerson, yeah?<eos> All right. Thank you.<eos> Joe.<eos> - Cecile. - Hi.<eos> I didn't know you were gonna be over here.<eos> Any excuse I have to run into you, I take it.
Any excuse I have to run into you, I take it.<eos> You know, I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night.<eos> So am I.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, good, then I, uh, - I'll see you then.<eos> Yo. Is that what I think it was?<eos> You asked her to movie night with us?<eos> That's awesome. When did you do that? How'd you do it?<eos> As much as I'd like to gossip with you like a teenager right now, there's something else we need to talk about.
Listen, you were right.<eos> I do treat Barry differently than I treat you. But not because I think Barry's better than you.<eos> Then why?<eos> Wally, you're a lot like I was as a kid.<eos> You're fearless and you take risks and that makes you a handful just like I was.<eos> And now you're getting powers.<eos> That alone would make me nervous because I know what I would have done if I got powers.<eos> But you're not getting your speed the same way Barry got his.<eos> You're getting your speed the way Magenta and The Rival got theirs.<eos> So it's not that I don't trust you, Wally, it's just I don't trust what's going on with you right now. And that scares the living hell out of me.
I told her all of you were coming with me.<eos> Am I gonna be the only one that shows up?<eos> Uh, I would love to see a movie.<eos> - What movie is this?<eos> - "The Shining."<eos> "The Shining," oh, I love that movie.<eos> That movie freaks you out.<eos> You have never made it past the part with the Grady twins.<eos> That's... that's... that was... I was younger.<eos> Why don't I go with you?
Uh, I would love to see a movie.<eos> - What movie is this?<eos> - "The Shining."<eos> "The Shining," oh, I love that movie.<eos> That movie freaks you out.<eos> You have never made it past the part with the Grady twins.<eos> That's... that's... that was... I was younger.<eos> Why don't I go with you?<eos> You sure you don't want stay...<eos> No, I want to be with you.
Not so tough without your friends and your fancy robe.<eos> I want to know about Alchemy.<eos> What he does, how he does it...<eos> His powers are beyond human understanding.<eos> - Try me.<eos> - Oh, you will be tried.<eos> All of you.<eos> When my master rises, the human race will be judged.<eos> From where I'm sitting, you will not fare very well.<eos> You think I'm playing with you?
I came to let you go.<eos> For a smart guy, that was an awfully dumb move.<eos> Like I said, you're free to go.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> You have to kill me.<eos> - What is he doing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> You want to fight, Flash?<eos> No. I'm not gonna fight you.
I point-blank refuse to work with someone whose sense of right or wrong is as flippant as the weather, someone who thinks friendship is more important than justice.<eos> You are unfit to be CSI.<eos> Barry Allen has no place in law enforcement.<eos> Now, do we have an agreement, or would you like the detective to meet that girl?<eos> All right.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> - Hey, Albert.<eos> - Hey. So, what can you tell me about our... our meta friend?<eos> I don't really remember anything.<eos> To be honest with you, it's all a bit of a blur, so...
I agree, Jefferson.<eos> Something's coming.<eos> Release the President!<eos> We knew you would come.<eos> Did you guys hear that?<eos> 'Cause I heard it in my head.<eos> Yeah, we heard it.<eos> Well, if nobody else is freaked out by it, far be it for me to panic.<eos> You don't need to harm him to get whatever it is you want from us.<eos> Release him and nothing will happen to you.
How about we play cards?<eos> Deceased male, late 20s.<eos> 6'2", 214 pounds.<eos> Found in a body of unknown chemicals.<eos> Based on the lack of epidermis erosion, the chemicals were non-acidic.<eos> Autopsy was commenced at 18:25 with a y-incision.<eos> Why can't I feel anything?<eos> Good night.<eos> I'm headed home.<eos> Oh, uh, give me a sec. I'll join you.

I'll join you.<eos> Not home, I mean.<eos> Bow! I'm a happily married man.<eos> Happy.<eos> I meant join you out.
He was so good that he wore an outfit with the words "Fair Play" written across it.<eos> Like, I'm so good, I don't even need to cheat to beat you.<eos> He's kind of my idol.<eos> Did you have a little crush on him, too?<eos> Hey, that's besides the point.<eos> Something on your mind, boss?<eos> You have a good natural form.<eos> Because it's not natural.<eos> I've been working on it for years.<eos> Rene, if I've been too hard on you it's because I want to make sure that you're taking this as seriously as I am.
- Wait, and then what?<eos> John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?<eos> Better than being punished for something he didn't do.<eos> Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.<eos> This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.<eos> U don't have what now?<eos> Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child. Ok.<eos> So wait a minute.<eos> Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?<eos> Can I speak with you for a minute?
Right.<eos> The ever-expanding club house.<eos> And who are you?<eos> I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.<eos> And also his sister.<eos> Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too? Heh.<eos> Ollie did this?<eos> Object lesson, long story.<eos> It's fine. Don't ask.<eos> What happened to you?
They moved him into gen pop.<eos> You go in there, neither of you are getting out.<eos> Talk to me. When's he coming back to his cell?<eos> Outside our window.<eos> If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.<eos> Abort.<eos> We're blown.<eos> Tell me where I can find Kovar.<eos> You think you scare me more than him?<eos> No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.<eos> Church is gonna take them out.<eos> Montes, quit screwing around.<eos> Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."<eos> We have a code yellow situation.<eos> Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.<eos> I'm not rolling on Church.<eos> You think you scare me more than him?<eos> No...<eos> But he's not here with you.
Are you ok?<eos> I thought Church would put up more of a fight.<eos> Probably realized he didn't have to.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I was hurting so bad, it... it got so I couldn't even see straight.<eos> Barely even remember telling him.<eos> Telling him what?<eos> Who you are.<eos> He knows you're Oliver Queen.<eos> Should have been out there with you tonight, Oliver.
God!<eos> Ohh! Christopher Chance.<eos> John referred to you as the Human Target.<eos> Well, that works better as a job description than it does as a nickname.<eos> Right. This is so weird.<eos> You have failed this city.<eos> How's Thea?<eos> Uh, she's a little shaken.<eos> You know, I didn't get a chance to tell her what was gonna go down until right before.<eos> She is gonna be so pissed at you.
You guys all right?<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> You survived.<eos> I guess I'll just have to kill you again, Oliver.<eos> You mind if I call you Oliver?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Unh! Get up!<eos> You're done, Church!<eos> You got much worse coming... heh... And you don't even know it.<eos> He calls himself Prometheus, and he's gonna end you.
It's funny.<eos> That's what I came here to say to you.<eos> We're usually on the same page.<eos> About a lot of things.<eos> All right. Uh, heh.<eos> Yes. I will see... I'll see you...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't need to thank me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I care about you...
We don't.<eos> In order to cover that much ground, we have to split up and each take one potential target.<eos> We run surveillance.<eos> Whoever spots Prometheus first, call it in, and we all converge.<eos> Cool.<eos> Is everything ok?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> For a long time, I blamed you for my parents dying, that you were responsible for leaving them to suffocate in one of Damien Darhk's testing chambers.<eos> I know.<eos> It took a lot for me to come work with you.
You are gonna get me out of here.<eos> You're late.<eos> You didn't even know I was coming.<eos> I dropped a resignation letter on your desk.<eos> You didn't think I'd expect you to show up and try and talk me out of it, and you can't, by the way.<eos> And what makes you think that I even want to, huh?<eos> You lied to us, Quentin, repeatedly.<eos> So what are you doing here then? Look.<eos> You...<eos> You are like family to us, ok, and I'm--I'm worried about you.
We're on the same side.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> This city is out of control, and you haven't been able to save it.<eos> Take one more step, and one of you isn't going home tonight.<eos> If you're not with me, you're against me.<eos> Then I'm against you.<eos> Then you're a dead man.<eos> I think we scared him off.<eos> He'll be back.<eos> Kind of reminds me of you, don't you think?
I... I know. I said I was sorry.<eos> In a text.<eos> Sara, can you give us a few minutes, please?<eos> You're lucky I'm not a trained assassin or anything.<eos> I...<eos> You, um... you look beautiful.<eos> I called you over 20 times last night.<eos> I can't explain last night.<eos> I just...<eos> Today... today, I want to marry you.
I just...<eos> Today... today, I want to marry you.<eos> Well, that's good because there are guests here.<eos> No, not with guests, not in a few hours.<eos> Now.<eos> Laurel, I need to... I need to get out of here.<eos> - I... we can elope.<eos> - Oliver.<eos> I'm being serious. I don't know what's going on with me right now.<eos> I just know that I want to be with you as quickly as humanly possible.
Me?<eos> Come on. You're the mayor.<eos> They'd be so happy, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves.<eos> Because what the Dominators showed us, it was a little like losing them all over again. They didn't take anything away from me.<eos> They gave me something.<eos> Reminded me how lucky I am to be a part of this family and to have you as my brother.<eos> That's very sweet.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> Hmm. I know, I know. I already broke the first rule of being a good date by not arriving with you, but I had a crushing deadline.
The dress that you're wearing makes up for it.<eos> Ahem. So, uh, you're his-- his date?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, just--uh, just for this party, which by the way, is a definite improvement over the previous mayor's holiday bash.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> Thanks. It's really great to know that this administration can do, like, one thing right.<eos> Be nice, Thea.<eos> No. I'm gonna go get a drink now.<eos> Talk to you later.
So he knows you're Mr. Terrific.<eos> Yeah, which means he probably knows--<eos> He knows that I'm the Green Arrow.<eos> If you remember anything else that could help us, give me a call.<eos> My cell's on there, too.<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> I can't believe that this is happening.<eos> Can't you? You think I haven't figured out that the tall guy in the black mask rolling with the Green Arrow was Curtis?<eos> Promise me you didn't tell Paul.<eos> No, but right now, I'm more worried about you.
Thanks, Rory.<eos> Hey, baby!<eos> Uh, what's going on?<eos> Were you able to find me that ice cream?<eos> Who's Rory?<eos> Oh. Oh Rory.<eos> He's a friend of mine from my Palmer Tech days.<eos> Saw what happened on the news and was just checking in on me.<eos> You're the world's worst liar, Curtis.<eos> That's one of the reasons I married you.
If you learn anything, contact me.<eos> Do not engage this enemy under any circumstances.<eos> Thought you weren't suiting up anymore.<eos> Yeah? Well, it's Felicity's boyfriend.<eos> Figured all hands.<eos> Plus John told me about Claybourne and 4 years ago.<eos> Speedy, are you about to tell me after everything that's happened and everything that's happening this isn't my fault?<eos> Do you remember when Tommy and I went to the U.S. Open and you tried to land a helicopter on the grounds because Tommy wanted to impress Maria Sharapova and then made dad blow that huge acquisitions deal?<eos> Because he had to bail me out, yeah.<eos> Pretty sure that was the most disappointed he's ever been in you.
Yeah, but we all know she has terrible taste in men.<eos> Deeks, just because your dad was an awful human being and forced you to shoot him doesn't mean that everybody your mom...<eos> Oh, no. You're not... here for target practice for her boyfriend, are you?<eos> What? !<eos> No.<eos> No... I'm just... I was just blowing off some steam.<eos> Come here.<eos> I think this is a good thing.<eos> I really do.<eos> And if it turns out not to be, then, uh, I'll be right there with you and we'll take this jerk down together.
Keep quiet!<eos> It's okay, just comply with them.<eos> Over here. Sit down.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> We lost our WiFi signal.<eos> Maybe they turned it off.<eos> We need a phone.<eos> I'm gonna try to get to the instructor's lounge.<eos> I'm not staying here alone.<eos> I'm coming with you.
What are you talking about?<eos> You asked her to cook the night of the bombing.<eos> You never wanted her around.<eos> Blake, you encouraged her to go into the Navy.<eos> It was the best thing that ever happened to her.<eos> Straightened her life out. Gave her strength.<eos> The courage to help me get away from you.<eos> What happened?<eos> How'd you find out?<eos> I overheard her talking to you about the condo.
MSST's are ready to roll. The 87's gonna be en route to block the Heritage Star upriver.<eos> Air Station's on scene in ten.<eos> We need to go with MSST and board the Heritage Star.<eos> Agent Russo already cleared it. We got room on the small boats for two. I'm gonna coordinate from the cutter.<eos> Russo already cleared it?<eos> It means he wants us on the Heritage Star.<eos> You think it's a trap?<eos> Either way, we got to do it.<eos> We got a crew of ten on that tug.<eos> All right, I'm with you, King.
Yeah, and you almost died a few weeks ago.<eos> But we lived.<eos> I go now.<eos> Did I offend you somehow?<eos> No. But you need to stop worrying about me.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means don't treat me different from everyone else. It especially means don't try to stop me from taking dangerous jobs.<eos> Don't get soft on me.<eos> I'm not soft.<eos> I care about you, you idiot.
♪ Cymbal-cymbal-cymbal-cymbal cymbal-cymbal ♪ What just happened?<eos> Somebody cut the power.<eos> Time's up.<eos> Looks like Figgis found you.<eos> Okay, door's secure.<eos> That's the last of the candles.<eos> Is that multi-wick?<eos> Am I smelling basil and tangerine?<eos> It's called "Summer's Kiss."<eos> What the hell is going on with you?
"I read the books, don't get too fond of this character."<eos> It's not always because they die.<eos> In one case, it's because they've become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time.<eos> Yeah, but I won't say who it is.<eos> It's Bran.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Leonard's being a jerk, so we're gonna watch over here.<eos> Do you guys want to watch with us?<eos> As long as I don't have to watch with him.<eos> Fine. I don't want to watch with you, either.
Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.<eos> They argue all the time.<eos> They aren't that close.<eos> Who's always comforting him when he's upset?<eos> Penny, but--<eos> Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?<eos> I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.<eos> Okay, and did you know she has him add things to the Roommate Agreement, so she can get her way, and not fight with you about it?
What-what did she...<eos> what did she mean? Two things that won't help are self-hatred and booze.<eos> Tonight will be full of both.<eos> But don't make either a habit.<eos> Toby...<eos> I, um, don't want to talk to anyone right now.<eos> Hey, um, if you still want to go, we should probably hit the road.<eos> It's gonna be a long drive.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Of course. Um, I'll just meet you out by the car.
Got license four years ago to take aerial photograph of dome, track stability.<eos> You programmed Geiger software, so you come with me, no?<eos> No.<eos> I barely survived the commercial jet flight here.<eos> I'm-I'm not getting in a flying jalopy with an inexperienced pilot.<eos> I assure you you're in good hands.<eos> Thank you, lady I barely know. But nyet.<eos> Sly, you need to run the Geiger software.<eos> You programmed it.<eos> I'll go with you.
I can handle it from here.<eos> Go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Uh, got my work cut out for me.<eos> Paige, we're less than a minute away.<eos> How are you on oxygen?<eos> Um, half a tank.<eos> It's not lasting as long as we thought.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I tried the tough love on you, and it didn't work, so let's try and keep your mind off things while we move some rocks. Deal?
Painfully gross.<eos> I would be chugging it with you, but... since Ralphy and I didn't go to Chernobyl...<eos> You better save me a slice or this goes on your head.<eos> Ask her.<eos> Hmm?<eos> There's... there's risk involved, you know?<eos> If it doesn't work... Sh-She's important to me, so I can't.<eos> There's risk involved.<eos> You dove off a building with the woman.<eos> She literally took the plunge with you.
Can we do it again?<eos> - We better.<eos> - Good.<eos> - _<eos> - This is awesome.<eos> Makes getting stuff from the kitchen so much easier.<eos> That's what I say every day.<eos> "This wheelchair sure is convenient."<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I getting too comfortable with you?
It's just HPD. Doesn't mean a thing, Renee.<eos> Barnes can get to anybody.<eos> Nobody talks but me.<eos> How you doin', Officer?<eos> Captain Grover, are you okay?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Why? What's the problem?<eos> Five-O has an alert out for you.<eos> If you don't mind, will you please step out of the vehicle?<eos> Go. I'll meet you at the extraction point.
What's my point?<eos> My point is this is getting old.<eos> You're very much alive.<eos> You're very much alive, which means I have your back.<eos> I've always had your back.<eos> So what are you talking about?<eos> Now return this to Universal Exports before you break it.<eos> It's indestructible, you idiot.<eos> Oh, perfect timing.<eos> I was just about to come to see you.
In my defense, I was sober when I said that.<eos> Okay, look, Null Legend, or Patrick, whatever your name is...<eos> It's Patrick.<eos> Patrick.<eos> ...the customer you're protecting, the guy in this picture, he kidnapped a girl.<eos> Dude, your sister was kidnapped?<eos> No that was just a clever ruse.<eos> I'm actually with Five-O.<eos> And all I got to do is say the word, and the cavalry will storm this place, seize every computer in here, and arrest your entire crew.<eos> How many customers are gonna want to do business with you then?
I know she was in touch with Gabriel when he was in Mexico.<eos> Okay, so what's she like?<eos> Sara?<eos> She's a sweet kid.<eos> The fact is, she's Gabriel's blood.<eos> Having a hard time wrapping my head around that.<eos> Yeah, well, she's Malia's blood, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, I should go.<eos> Okay, I-I'll talk to you later.
Hold your position.<eos> Make sure no one gets out of the building.<eos> What about the girl?<eos> Get rid of her.<eos> Still no word from Abby.<eos> We gotta go back.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much about her, Chin.<eos> I'm sure she's fine.<eos> Hey, what'd I tell you about talking?<eos> I'll go back with you, Chin.
Natalie Ochoa, works in HPD Communications.<eos> Her name cross-referenced with Solomon Tuasopo.<eos> He's the guard from Halawa.<eos> He's on Shioma's payroll. That's right.<eos> Ochoa's personnel file revealed<eos> Tuasopo's her brother-in-law.<eos> I.A. looked into her but didn't find anything.<eos> It's got to be her.<eos> I'm on my way to see her now.<eos> I'll meet you there.
The point is, the lion wouldn't be registered, so there would be no way to search for it.<eos> There is, however, a way to search for dead mountain lions.<eos> Taxidermists.<eos> There are only three in the city that deal with large mammals.<eos> Marcus is checking them out right now.<eos> So do you think this is what your father was doing in the brownstone the other night?<eos> Planting cameras to spy on us?<eos> I checked.<eos> There were none.<eos> I was wrong to lay into you so harshly, when you told me about Kurtz.
_<eos> You better have a damn good excuse for what you been doing!<eos> I'm tryin' to get my stroke on!<eos> Gerald, I don't have time for whatever this is.<eos> Do you got something for me or not, man?<eos> All right, look, I might.<eos> Hey, remember that strip club that we used to sneak into when we were 16?<eos> - Peppermint Panda?<eos> - No, the Neon Fox.<eos> I never even heard of that, so I know I never been there with you.
Bangla-damn.<eos> Man gets around.<eos> Yeah, and he brings the same twisted M.O. everywhere he goes.<eos> He runs women in and out through local prostitution rings, rakes in profits, and then just magically skips town right before it gets hot.<eos> Guy's into fancy cars, ugly clothes and...<eos> Let me guess. Korean spas.<eos> Yeah. How'd you know that?<eos> Just got the name to the one he frequents.<eos> Let's get moving.<eos> I'm right behind you.
- Come on, let's see if we can find Zho.<eos> - Carter...<eos> Oh, look!<eos> It's Lee. And he's not dead.<eos> - Just incredibly rude.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> So you think our trafficker is here?<eos> We're about to find out.<eos> Hey. You want to tell me where the hell you been?<eos> Huh? What's going on with you?
You can take your vows early.<eos> Sarah, I think we should...<eos> I don't want to leave school... at least not right now.<eos> Sarah.<eos> You will leave school when you are 16, regardless.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> Look, I just hope... that, uh, with all this stuff... all this stuff that's been going on lately, all the stuff that I did...<eos> I just hope you're not making these decisions because of... because of that, because of me.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't have anything to do with you.
Hawk...<eos> And an IS girl.<eos> He says he doesn't want to leave school.<eos> It's exactly what had happened with Tessa.<eos> You remember?<eos> She was almost 16, ready to take her vows.<eos> What if he leaves us?<eos> I mean, what if he... he chooses to be Ignorant?<eos> The Garden without Hawk...<eos> Let me pray with you...
Somewhere new.<eos> - D.C., maybe.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It does.<eos> It should.<eos> Was it because we...<eos> because of the other day?<eos> Did I make you feel like you had to do something you didn't want to?<eos> It has nothing to do with you or us or the other day.
You sure you weren't followed?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Thanks for not giving me up to Cal.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about the 40 grand you stole?<eos> I didn't think it was relevant. Really?<eos> 'Cause you told me they were following you because they killed your husband 'cause you wanted to leave.<eos> Seems pretty fucking relevant.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought it would hurt my case with you.
How was your day? It was good.<eos> I need you to help me manage the situation with Hawk and Ashley.<eos> Sarah, shouldn't we let him find his own way?<eos> No.<eos> - No.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> You're leaving already?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have a good idea. What's that?<eos> I could come with you.
We are so proud of you. The Light has never shined more brightly through you, or more powerfully.<eos> You've always been the guide in our family, and to see you up there guiding the whole Movement, it was... it was just...<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, everyone.<eos> Is the Sarah parade over?<eos> 'Cause this baby is knocking on the door.<eos> Come on. Let's get you off your feet.<eos> Okay, thank you, everyone... really.<eos> Hey, you two. All right, I'm gonna go put these in some water.<eos> Thank you. Sarah, Sarah... I'd love to have a little private chat with you later, woman to woman.
Why are you wearing a tie?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Hawk.<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> Please, help me.<eos> Hey, Ashley.<eos> I'm a friend of Hawk's family.<eos> Yeah, I remember you from, like, the church or whatever you call it.
- You saw Doc dying.<eos> What about The Ladder?<eos> Do you see The Ladder?<eos> No.<eos> Do you think that I... am going crazy?<eos> I mean, is this a psychotic break?<eos> I think you're having visions, Eddie.<eos> You have to find out what they mean.<eos> How am I supposed to find out what they mean?<eos> The Light is trying to communicate with you.
Happy holidays.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> - Hey. - Can I come in?<eos> Well, I'm just...<eos> I'm just working on something. It's kind of private.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I came to say yes.<eos> Yes?<eos> I want to stand beside you on Friday.<eos> I want to take The Movement to the next generation... with you.
Detectives.<eos> I burned those copies of our surveillance tapes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, Rollins.<eos> Every floor for the last 48 hours.<eos> Thanks, Rollins.<eos> Really appreciate it.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - Castle?<eos> What's with you?
Got something?<eos> No.<eos> This whole thing's just...<eos> Did I ever tell you how Camille told me she was pregnant with Justin?<eos> I...<eos> I wanted to wait, you know, when I'm a detective...<eos> Anyway, I come home one night, big dinner.<eos> "I know you're not ready for a baby," she says.<eos> "But I hope you're ready for two."<eos> - She messed with you. - No.
- Get back.<eos> - Please.<eos> Don't leave us.<eos> I know your mother would wish the same as me.<eos> That you and Noctis live happily.<eos> All those years captive because I failed you.<eos> Not again.<eos> Locked doors will seal your fate no longer.<eos> King Regis...<eos> Our hope goes with you now, Nyx Ulric.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> EMTs woke her up.<eos> She's just saying random words.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You guys okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> They're gonna take her to Med. I'm gonna go.<eos> I wanna be there when she wakes up.<eos> I'll ride with you.
Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?<eos> Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.<eos> Waking up wondering which of those fans stole our wallets.<eos> Stuart, what're you doing here?<eos> Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life!<eos> Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You were happy to do this when I hired you.<eos> Why are you upset with me now?<eos> I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
- Maybe, but it's a woman of 70 years.<eos> A crime of passion at age 70?<eos> Saved, you think like in the Middle Ages.<eos> Do you mean that when you are 70 years old you will not want me?<eos> But what does it have to do with us?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Then, you still want me at 70.<eos> - Sure, but what does it have to do?<eos> - I understand that you say that of that history. "By God, Livia, please!"<eos> Idiot, I'm teasing you!
some very important things.<eos> - But what happens to you now, Catarè?<eos> - As I already heard that you had not found... the son of a bitch who killed the lady whore, with respect, - I decided to give her a hand.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I hear you.<eos> Remember I told you about the Johnny West movie?<eos> I bought the DVD for you, Dottore. "Look, is not it a good title?<eos> "Murder on the sidewalk." "Why do you offer it to me?"<eos> If I, I have taken an eye, I have understood the murder, you, who is dottore and curator, will immediately catch everything from A to Z... even who is the murderer of the whore Castellino!<eos> Thanks, Catarè, I know I can always count on you.
- Good morning, Catarella.<eos> - Good morning, Dottore.<eos> Mimì.<eos> Are you aware of the dead?<eos> Yes, Fazio told me.<eos> - Good.<eos> Fazio, come a moment.<eos> What's New?<eos> When you were away, we received a call from Mrs. Gambardella... the journalist.<eos> She wanted to talk to you... in person personally, paraphrasing Catarella.
I said case closed, ice cream.<eos> Oh, my job requirements varied.<eos> Whatever Emmett needed and...<eos> I notice you refer to Mr. Perry by his first name.<eos> Is that a company-wide policy?<eos> No, no, it isn't, but I...<eos> So just a privilege reserved for very special people, then?<eos> Okay.<eos> Objection, sidebar, recess.<eos> Can-can I talk to you over here, please?
Can you identify the ex-humans?<eos> That's a great question.<eos> The odontologist will work the chompers and I'll work the bones, and we'll get back to you.<eos> What's the best number to reach you when that happens?<eos> - Oh, well, that's actually...<eos> - Um, well... Detective Lee.<eos> I can't believe the googly eyes she was making at you.<eos> - Googly eyes?<eos> - "Detective Lee, you're so funny." I've known her for years.<eos> Five seconds with you, and she's all googly-eyed.
Don't get any ideas, friend.<eos> She's spoken for.<eos> But it's not just about looking good.<eos> - CrossFit is a way of life.<eos> Is that a fact? Yeah.<eos> Cardio boxing for endurance and...<eos> - tai chi for precision and focus.<eos> - Oh, fantastic.<eos> Um, you know what, I should visit the ladies' room.<eos> So how 'bout I just meet you back at the seats?
Wait, so-so you're bringing me something this big and attributing the intel to "word on the street"?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes. But the intel is accurate.<eos> What, and you expect me to act on this with nothing solid?<eos> It's solid, I'm telling you.<eos> - Captain, that intel... - Shh!<eos> Shut up, Lee!<eos> - ...it was obtained through a...<eos> - You're speaking gibberish.<eos> Carter, what the hell is wrong with you?
And I tell you what, anytime you want to go and visit, I'll tag along.<eos> Lee, would they not love me in China?<eos> Do you want my honest response, or an insincere compliment?<eos> I'll go insincere compliment.<eos> They would love you in China.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I knew it, man.<eos> I'm handsome, charming... modest.<eos> I'm short, they love short people in China.<eos> I don't know what happened to you, you tall as hell.
Have a good day.<eos> Well?<eos> The man is an idiot.<eos> He's not, not at all.<eos> - You can't buy him.<eos> - Oh, but I can.<eos> - And he's as queer as they come.<eos> You'd try it on with him?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Why don't I come with you?
I prefer Adrien's.<eos> Who likes Adrien's?<eos> Okay, we'll use Adrien's.<eos> What's next?<eos> I have the first polls.<eos> We're in the lead, with 33%.<eos> 15% for the Socialists. 25% for the French Party.<eos> Taro has 11%!<eos> There's no need to attack Taro just yet.<eos> Be gentle, like he was with you.
The invoices scandal will sink the UPM.<eos> And Robert Taro will make his big comeback.<eos> - We need to take him out.<eos> - That's my plan.<eos> Unless you have a better idea, do as I said.<eos> Mess up his life.<eos> His friends, his family... everybody.<eos> Throw him off balance.<eos> How are you?<eos> Julia is coming to have lunch with you.
I got you. Wait. You're going along with this?<eos> He's got a good idea.<eos> That guy has a good idea?<eos> We're going to find out.<eos> - Come on. Hey!<eos> - Somebody help me!<eos> - Help!<eos> - Come on!<eos> I can't catch his attention. Somebody give me a hand.<eos> What is wrong with you? Why would you do that?
- No!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Molly?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You heard him.<eos> Someone should go talk to her.<eos> I'll go.<eos> II should do it. It should be me.<eos> I'll make sure she's okay.<eos> Do you want me to go with you?
I just need a little peek.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to.<eos> If you're gonna leave, then leave.<eos> I'm not gonna watch you.<eos> Know this, luv. I will never stop fighting.<eos> I will brave the oceans and sail past the sirens to find my way back to you.<eos> Now why haven't I seen her before?<eos> I took Bonnie home.<eos> I would have gone with you.
We disrupted General Davies' event in Vancouver and...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Can you just back that up for a second?<eos> You knew Chloe?<eos> She and Eleanor were the only ones who knew that I was behind your team.<eos> I've been secretly working against Davies, trying to find an alternative to the Noah Objective.<eos> Well, then, let us go find that alternative, okay?<eos> Because that's what Chloe wanted.<eos> Please. I need you to come with me to my orchard.<eos> You know, we're not gonna go anywhere with you.
He's on his way. Should be here any minute.<eos> And this Gibbs, you, uh, you trust him?<eos> Like no one else.<eos> Though, he did shoot me in the ass once.<eos> Flesh wounds, they heal easily enough.<eos> You sound like him.<eos> I'd offer you tea, but he doesn't carry the stuff.<eos> Choices are... water, beer, or bourbon.<eos> Whatever you're having.<eos> There's something I've been meaning to tell you since we got back from England.
What the hell?<eos> Nice try, partner, but I know you better than you think.<eos> - I need to talk to Emma.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'm not listening.<eos> I'm not letting you hurt her.<eos> She saw your rage firsthand last night.<eos> Do you have any idea how upset she was?<eos> Emma?<eos> Can I talk to you for five minutes?
- Excited about tomorrow?<eos> Oh, so that's why you're playing coffee servant?<eos> Yeah, I'm ecstatic about tomorrow, actually.<eos> Who doesn't love a Friday?<eos> They announce the Lady of the Lake Pageant finalists, and I have no doubt whatsoever that you... are going to be one of them.<eos> - Lucky me.<eos> - Your, uh, chances of winning decrease dramatically if Jake Fitzgerald is your escort.<eos> - Then, I should be a sure bet.<eos> - You two have a fight?<eos> You can't fight with someone who's not speaking to you.
He'll pick you up at 6:30.<eos> - So, 7:00?<eos> Your place?<eos> - Uh, let's say 7:30.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you sure you still want to do something?<eos> You're dealing with a lot.<eos> We can chill, celebrate tomorrow.<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> I want to chill and celebrate with you tonight.
Just you and me.<eos> Is it because Audrey turned you down?<eos> It's because I like you.<eos> You like your gay best friend too, right?<eos> I just don't see it adding up to happiness, for any of us.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I, um...<eos> I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for freaking out on you last night.
We're good, thanks.<eos> Sofia's doing really well.<eos> You know, she loves her dance class, and why would we take her out of school in the middle of the year?<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no. We wouldn't move her until after school's over for the year.<eos> Well, yeah, no. "We" wouldn't move her anywhere.<eos> Uh, "we" is you and Penny.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You don't get to just decide to...<eos> I haven't decided anything.<eos> I'm trying to talk to you.
- This is not the time...<eos> Oh, don't you dare get righteous with me.<eos> That was your house and your gun and your kid that knew about it, not mine.<eos> I sent my child over to your house to play, and your kid might have made him a murderer.<eos> - Hi. I called the sitter.<eos> The kids are okay.<eos> What's wrong? What happened? Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just wanted to make sure they're okay, and they are.<eos> What's wrong with you? Oh. Okay, you guys haven't heard.
- They're in love. That's sweet.<eos> - It's sad.<eos> They have love right in front of them.<eos> That doorman is just gonna keep opening that door, letting love out and letting it back in again and then letting it walk right by him.<eos> - 15 blade.<eos> You know, that is said.<eos> And when Dr. Warren accuses me of trying to sabotage his surgical career, would you say that's a fair assessment?<eos> No. You haven't tried to sabotage anything.<eos> Irrigation.<eos> Of course she's gonna agree with you.
- Air embolus.<eos> Must have sucked air into the septal wound.<eos> Riggs, he's gonna need a needle aspiration through the ventricle before he throws an air embolus and strokes out.<eos> Already on it.<eos> No air on the T.E.E. You got it all.<eos> Oh, uh, I was about to make a point about your questions, Chief.<eos> You see, these two...<eos> No offense...<eos> But they're gonna say whatever you want, 'cause Pierce works for you, and Riggs works for Pierce.<eos> So you can ask them all you want and you can compare me to a child all you want, but the fact is you are never gonna know what they really think, because, unlike me... they're beholden to you.
- She's beautiful.<eos> - She looks just like you did.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to say goodbye to her now.<eos> Goodbye for now.<eos> Goodbye, little girl.<eos> No matter what the judge decides, I know that you're a good mom, too.<eos> And I just want you to know this doesn't change that.<eos> The things that you let them say about me...<eos> I would never have done that to you.
Aw, please don't talk about her.<eos> It looks like Rhys has a peritonsillar abscess.<eos> I do need to drain it.<eos> Oh, no, no, you're not sticking that thing down my throat.<eos> Hey, hey, Rhys, buddy, it's okay.<eos> I'm here.<eos> All right?<eos> It's like I told you, I want you to think of me as a father.<eos> Why?<eos> All my mom ever talks about is when she's gonna break up with you.
- Five.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Five?<eos> Sure.<eos> Unless the first few terrorize us.<eos> Then we can have four.<eos> Are we really talking about this?<eos> Marriage and kids? No. I mean, maybe one day, but no.<eos> It was pretty fun watching Maggie's face in the O.R., though.<eos> You know, it is fun being fake married to you.

Mm. Mm-hmm.

Mm. Mm-hmm.<eos> I have...<eos> I have to prep for a surgery.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Uh, Knox asked me to cover for him on that facial implant tomorrow.<eos> - Cool with you?
Nah, man, I am pissed as hell, but she's the love of my life, so...<eos> I mean, you get it.<eos> You got April.<eos> April and I are divorced.<eos> Well, like I said... waiting game.<eos> Stay strong.<eos> You'll get there.<eos> You're out of your damn mind.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Oh, hey, Bailey, I need to talk to you about Warren.
But, you know, I'd probably just embarrass you, acting a fool, you know, screaming your name in the front row.<eos> - I'm excited to see that.<eos> - No, you think you are.<eos> You have not seen me act like a fool.<eos> - I'd throw my bra on the stage.<eos> - Please do that.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Listen...<eos> I, um...<eos> I am in this... kind of deep with you, so just... don't say these things if you don't mean them, okay?
I'm starving, too.<eos> No, I'm ready to get married.<eos> I have proposed to you twice, and you still haven't given me an answer.<eos> I bought you a ring.<eos> You told me not to get rid of it, so it's just sitting in a drawer, collecting dust.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, I'm ready to be married, and I need to know when you will be ready.<eos> It doesn't have to be today or tomorrow, but I need to know it's gonna happen.<eos> I need to know that you're up for this, 'cause I am.<eos> Look, I'm not scared of being committed to you.

I thought I knew what I was doing.<eos> You and I... we're good, right?<eos> I mean, this is real between us.<eos> We know what we're doing.<eos> I think we do.<eos> Why aren't we doing it?<eos> Why aren't we building our life?<eos> I don't want to waste our time on conversations or some hypothetical lives someday.<eos> I...<eos> I want a real life... and I want it with you.
But the thing is, I'm not ashamed at all.<eos> The only person who would have really been hurt is him.<eos> It would have hurt him.<eos> And not just publicly.<eos> Abby.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> No one knows.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> Your father told me.<eos> And, Liv, I don't think he's done with you.
Then what are you saying?<eos> 'Cause it sounds like you're accusing me of something.<eos> Are you accusing me of something?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - Spit it out, woman!<eos> If you have a problem with the way I'm raising my children...<eos> I just wish you wouldn't go in there.<eos> She's my daughter, Lanie!<eos> Am I not supposed to say goodnight to my daughter?<eos> Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
It's almost 10:00, son.<eos> Right.<eos> You should have some of that toast.<eos> You know, we should take a walk today.<eos> Adams Morgan.<eos> You love Adams Morgan.<eos> I got us some new puzzles.<eos> Redwood Forest.<eos> Mount Rushmore.<eos> I'd love to do one with you.
I can't...<eos> I can't go... back to the White House.<eos> I can't... go back to where I, um...<eos> To where I killed him.<eos> Hey. It's gonna be okay.<eos> Forget about the party.<eos> Jake?<eos> Are you in there?<eos> You go ahead.<eos> I'll try and meet you there, okay?
Choice is yours.<eos> Jake.<eos> Liv.<eos> You here to wish me luck?<eos> Before I go ahead and jilt a perfectly lovely woman in possibly the most public and humiliating way ever conceived?<eos> - I could really use...<eos> - I can't do this.<eos> What?<eos> You can't do what?<eos> Be with you.
What did he say?<eos> This isn't him.<eos> This is me.<eos> Well, we can fix this.<eos> Jake, no.<eos> This can't be fixed.<eos> - What happened? !<eos> - What always happens.<eos> I think I want something,<eos> I think I want to be with you, be normal, and...
I think I want to be with you, be normal, and...<eos> You love me.<eos> Jake, listen...<eos> You love me.<eos> I can't be with you!<eos> It's not even just that I can't.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> So you should just be with her.<eos> Marry Vanessa.<eos> What happened to you?
It's okay.<eos> No.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> I may be horrible because I'm abandoning you, because I always abandon you.<eos> But I'm not scared.<eos> Not the least bit.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> And pathetic.<eos> I could tell you five minutes from now that I want to be with you, that I want to save you.
Do you honestly not know by now?<eos> I'm in love with Fitz.<eos> I don't love you, Jake.<eos> I love him.<eos> When I'm with you, all I think about is him.<eos> Fitz is who I choose.<eos> He's who I will always choose.<eos> You are just a lesser version of him.<eos> A sad reminder of the man I truly deserve.<eos> If I couldn't make it work with him, why the hell would you think I could make it work with you?
If anyone should take their anger into the voting booth, it's them.<eos> Governor.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> You just missed Susan.<eos> I can call her if you like.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I'm not here to talk to her.<eos> Can I level with you?
Hopefully, nobody sees it.<eos> I am trying to help you.<eos> By taking precious time at my convention to talk about yourself?<eos> This is you helping me?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes!<eos> The best thing that I can do for you right now is to talk about me.<eos> I know how that sounds, but if I talk about you, that becomes the story.<eos> Am I being honest about you, unfair?
How privileged and entitled do you have to be to think of the most powerful office in the world as a prison?<eos> Unlike you, Fitz, I want this.<eos> Unlike you...<eos> I earned it.<eos> And unlike you...<eos> I will not squander it.<eos> This stage is mine.<eos> - Liv.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> This was the only way to meet you without alerting my father.
Like this...<eos> Talking to you, listening to you.<eos> Do you think I listened to you enough?<eos> When?<eos> When you were talking?<eos> Fitz, what's going on?<eos> Mellie says the entire way I've handled this speech has been controlling, manipulative, and narcissistic.<eos> I don't want to get in between you and Mellie.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I'm sorry if I was that way with you, too.
I'm sitting here practicing my speech, and all I can think is "Why?"<eos> Why run for Vice President when frankly, I'd rather flip patties at Gettysburger.<eos> You'd be the second most powerful person on the planet.<eos> And completely miserable.<eos> I-If I still feared your father, yeah.<eos> Your name is on the poster.<eos> We announced you.<eos> Check out this house that's for sale.<eos> I drive by it every day on my way to the office.<eos> It is the most normal, unremarkable house I've ever seen in my life, and I desperately want to live in it with you.
Rope? - _<eos> NOAH: Oh. You're saying the call is coming from inside the house.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> What if they think one of us is the killer?<eos> They didn't lock the killer out.<eos> They locked him in.<eos> Him or her.<eos> Could be either.<eos> But I guess I should leave the crazy paranoid talk to the experts.<eos> Kieran, can I talk to you for a second?
- Caruso!<eos> I trust Anita and the baby are well?<eos> Right this way, Mayor Maddox.<eos> That's the mayor?<eos> I'm here... if you want to talk about anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Daddy. - (WHISPERING)<eos> It might not be Jake's phone.<eos> I just need to give this to the sheriff and let him do his job.<eos> All we know is someone planted it on you.
I don't want to make you choose between being a mother and a medical examiner.<eos> So, yeah, I'm having you removed from the scene.<eos> - Audrey!<eos> - Dude, you scared the crap out of me!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You okay?<eos> I was out there and you were in here<eos> - and it just... it felt weird.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> We're always together in times of intense peril, and, I don't know, I-I was worried about you.
That's it.<eos> It's not weird.<eos> It'd be weird if we didn't.<eos> You, Stavo!<eos> What are you drawing?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Come on, you're staring at us all the time.<eos> I'd love to see what we inspire in you.<eos> - Hey! Give that back!<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
I just need to talk to her.<eos> - Could you tell her I stopped by?<eos> - Sure.<eos> She's going through a hard time right now.<eos> - Just be patient with her.<eos> - I will.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Telling him about the phone without talking to you... it was wrong.
It's just not a good time right now.<eos> But I owe you an apology, Emma.<eos> During the lockdown, I was worried things might trigger your PTSD.<eos> I only locked you in that classroom for your own protection, I swear.<eos> But it caused a panic attack and I'm so sorry.<eos> I really hope you can forgive me.<eos> Yeah, I accept your apology, but...<eos> But what?<eos> A lot of people are trying to help me right now, and it seems to be turning out for the worst.<eos> We're just worried about you, Emma.
My treat.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know a really cool place.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Come on.<eos> I will pick you up, 5:30?<eos> For the record, you're a really bad salesman.<eos> I cannot talk about this right now, okay?<eos> I really need you to give me some space, or I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> We're just worried about you, Emma.
- Okay. Um...<eos> So, you know how my mom is difficult.<eos> And by "difficult," I mean, a total mess.<eos> I'm the only adult between the two of us.<eos> Sometimes, when I'm, like, feeling sick of it all, I...<eos> I make up other lives... which sometimes involves sneaking into other people's houses.<eos> That is called home invasion.<eos> Technically, yes, but, uh... I prefer to call it "Goldilocks-ing."<eos> Goldilocks-ing.<eos> There is no way I am not making fun of you for that.
This is a mistake.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> You're Nick, ain't you?<eos> Your bitch-ass daddy, he say he could take our cash, clean it up, make it safe.<eos> Next thing you know, the money gone.<eos> Ain't that some shit?<eos> So, here's what's up...<eos> You tell me where your old man at... or you turn into gator food.<eos> It'll makes no difference to me. I know I'mma get that shit eventually.<eos> When I'm done with you... I'm goin' right on down the line.
How do you figure that?<eos> Whose gambling got us evicted from the old place?<eos> And whose quick thinking got us this apartment?<eos> Quick thinking?<eos> You lied to the building owners that you were a skilled handyman.<eos> Yes, and one of my skills is lying.<eos> And while you were waiting tables or going to class, who babysat for you free of charge?<eos> Oh, Grandma, thank you.<eos> Oh, I see, you're just gonna spin everything.<eos> I am a self-made woman. My success has nothing to do with you.
I did, too.<eos> But talking with her really helped me after Iran.<eos> I know, and I'm grateful for it, but this is an entirely different situation.<eos> Is it?<eos> Because you are up half the night walking the floors.<eos> You-you say the same moment with Dmitri plays over and over in your head.<eos> - That sounds a lot like<eos> - Okay, what happened<eos> - what I went through.<eos> - in Iran happened to you.
I know you've flown overhead, 20,000 feet.<eos> Being on the ground is a whole other game.<eos> I'll tell you my number-one rule, how I made it home from every mission I've been on.<eos> No acts of passion.<eos> Ever.<eos> You find yourself wanting to save somebody, take a big risk that wasn't part of the plan, don't do it.<eos> We're way more useful alive than a star on the wall.<eos> I don't think we lost Mimi because of passion.<eos> Hey, man, I...<eos> I'm sorry I rode you hard on Mimi.
You're parading him around right in front of her.<eos> You're stealing my husband away, are you?<eos> That's quite an interesting book you've got over there.<eos> Most men think it's just smut.<eos> Who says there's nothing valuable in a little smut?<eos> Sometimes losing control has its own kind of power.<eos> We've all become so scared to take any risks anymore.<eos> We've become slaves to our own boring lives.<eos> I've never seen anything like this before.<eos> He's playing you.
Why not?<eos> Because I'm drunk.<eos> And you're kind of drunk.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Am I going to regret this tomorrow?<eos> Not a word until you're spoken to.
Because I'm not in the mood.<eos> Stop being so shy.<eos> You weren't shy the other night.<eos> No, Rafe.<eos> Weren't you the one that said aggression was a lost art form?<eos> This is not what I meant by that.<eos> Hey, let her go.<eos> Who the fuck are you, the hall monitor?<eos> This party's got a hall monitor?<eos> I'll stand here all night, but I'm not leaving her alone with you.
Do it.<eos> My boss sent me home.<eos> But your first task was successful.<eos> I'm totally humiliated.<eos> The point is to push you beyond your comfort zone.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> What is this?<eos> A present.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
But I will have to punish you.<eos> What's the punishment?<eos> You want me to what?<eos> Spank me five times.<eos> Why?<eos> It's this whole new age psychological practice where adults benefit from childhood punishment as a way of changing their behaviors.<eos> You should really read about it.<eos> I don't need to read about it. I'll do whatever you want. Just give me your ass, and tell me what happened with Scarlet.<eos> Start talking.<eos> Okay. So she cares about you a lot.
Not a minute late.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I'm not leaving until we fuck.<eos> You can't show up at my house like this.<eos> You never had a problem with it before.<eos> Well, yeah, I'm drawing the line now.<eos> Well, that's no fun.<eos> Where'd you park the car?<eos> In the garage.<eos> What's wrong with you?
But I want to see your face.<eos> This is your punishment, remember?<eos> Well, when do I get a reward?<eos> When you start doing exactly as I say.<eos> Not a word out of your mouth no matter how good any of this feels, understand?<eos> Okay, let it out.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> That might have been... have been my most favorite punishment yet.<eos> Well, I went a little easy on you given you haven't done this before.
Keep that intensity.<eos> I'm going back to dick.<eos> Pussy's too fucking complicated.<eos> Jules, I'm working.<eos> I don't care about your fucking ad campaign.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> When I'm done.<eos> No, now.<eos> If you'll excuse me for just a moment.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Thank you.<eos> "Pain is beautiful and so are you."<eos> Hey, give me that.<eos> You know, no self-respecting guy would ever say that to a chick.<eos> Yeah, well, no self-respecting guy would ever call a woman a chick.<eos> What?<eos> I just think it's a little too early in the game to be sending each other gifts.<eos> It's not a game.<eos> Oh, sweetie, it's a game.<eos> He's playing you.
To do my errands.<eos> To do the dirty work.<eos> But you're not worth the hassle anymore.<eos> So leave me the keys and get the fuck out of here.<eos> Think you should slow down a little bit?<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Pour me another one.<eos> I'm cutting you off.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> I could drink you under the table any day of the week.
Previously on "Submission..."<eos> So you don't strike me as a girl that likes to read smut.<eos> You're Nolan Keats?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's my pen name.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> So is this the new book you have coming out in the fall?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's playing you.
Hey, Elliott, it's Dillon.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to call really quickly and thank you for last night.<eos> I know now that I'm definitely not cut out to be a submissive.<eos> But Ashley, on the other hand, she most certainly is.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't think that after this morning she'll be submitting to you anymore because I told her everything.<eos> I guess in a weird way keeping the little Nolan Keats thing a secret felt almost like an act of submission, and as you know quite well, I'm really bad at submission.<eos> I make a far better dominant.<eos> So I showed her the video and explained to her who Nolan Keats really is.<eos> Not because it was the right thing to do, but because it was the ultimate act of domination.<eos> Not just over her, but over you.
"the Hunt".<eos> The new Alpha allows his Pack to hunt the old.<eos> As a gift.<eos> You think I'm going to let you force me to Change, as a gift?<eos> Tomorrow at noon my Pack will hunt you.<eos> If you refuse, we will kill Nick.<eos> They'll kill me anyway.<eos> Enjoy the cold comfort of your cage.<eos> _<eos> I'm going to argue with you about this, darlin'.
You stood by and watched, I think.<eos> Taking your father's seat before his body hit the floor.<eos> You have always been a little mudak, Konstantin.<eos> Like a puppy, showing his white, soft belly, pissing on the rug when he is scared.<eos> I will kill Jeremy Danvers.<eos> What?<eos> I have an anger that needs calming.<eos> He is the one who is in the cage, so I will take him.<eos> That was not the plan.<eos> I can be angry with him, or I can be angry with you.
"felt like... you just touched me."<eos> "l'm the dewdrops of your dawn."<eos> "l am your destiny."<eos> "l'm the dewdrops of your dawn."<eos> "l am your destiny."<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Your life line's smaller than mine.<eos> These fate lines cannot predict anyone's destiny... lt's nonsense.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> If anything happens to you... then what about me?
Just think about it, okay?<eos> Hannah!<eos> Well... aren't we just one big happy family?<eos> You killed me.<eos> You punched me in the ear.<eos> I meant... I meant to hit you in the face.<eos> Huh, like this?<eos> Hannah's coming with me.<eos> Giving us your blessing?<eos> - She won't go with you.
- She will.<eos> I know Hannah.<eos> Then you also know that she hates you.<eos> Stop!<eos> I need a few hours to download the data and pack up the ARQ.<eos> You can't go with him, Hannah.<eos> His mind's gone sour.<eos> We'll hook up with a migrant caravan, head to the Arctic Parallel.<eos> I can hack weather drones so we avoid flash...<eos> I can't go with you.
To make sure you were okay.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Hannah, just come with me.<eos> Ren, there is a war on.<eos> You come with me.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> To the Bloc?<eos> Come on.<eos> You say you wanna solve the world's energy crisis, - but you just wanna run away.<eos> - Yes, with you.
- I don't know, Joe.<eos> You don't know if you're hungry?<eos> I don't even know what to think anymore.<eos> I try to decipher your sayings, but then the phone rings and you boot me to another zip code.<eos> And we still haven't figured out how to make any money and I go home every day and I'm spinning and I don't even know if you like me.<eos> I feel crazy.<eos> You're not going crazy, Ryan. You're hungry.<eos> Look, I've had a tough week.<eos> Will you join me for dinner?<eos> Okay. Okay, I'll come to dinner with you.
I didn't know Donna was gonna try an end run around me.<eos> About your marriage.<eos> - Look, Cam, I know you don't think of me as a father.<eos> You made that clear. That's okay. You're gonna feel the way you wanna feel.<eos> But it won't stop me thinkin' of you as a daughter.<eos> So, tell me what to do.<eos> First off, don't make this thing with Donna any bigger than it is.<eos> You two have a difference of opinion, that's all.<eos> The only reason I'm here in the first place is because of you.<eos> I love you and I owe you.
The market likes Mutiny, but in a year or two, or however long it takes to implement the changes you have in mind, who knows?<eos> We can't count on tomorrow's landscape looking like today's.<eos> Mutiny isn't sustainable as it exists now.<eos> Our whole user base is tied to the Commodore 64.<eos> We need to diversify to other platforms in order to grow.<eos> And isn't that what Wall Street likes?<eos> Growth?<eos> The kind of investment that I'm talking about in time and money will pay off and smart investors will see that.<eos> Your ideas are good, Cameron, and some of them are even great.<eos> And I want to explore them with you, all of them. - Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Daddy!<eos> Oh, look at that!<eos> Who's this?<eos> Oh, this is Manny, the new nanny.<eos> You told me to get some help, so I did.<eos> Charles, nice to meet you.<eos> I was just getting to know Kiki. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - She's so cute. - She is so cute.<eos> - Too cute.<eos> Julie, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
The big guy tends to take over sometimes.<eos> And to be honest, it was nice to just let someone else drive for awhile. Ugh!<eos> Got a good whiff of that guy's breath and figured out why they call him the Abomination.<eos> You missed a good fight.<eos> We did some work while you were gone.<eos> It's half the weight.<eos> And twice as strong.<eos> And Hawkeye, I increased the output power of your arrows by drawing on their own kinetic energy.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Yeah, we're not used to you leaving things, you know, the opposite of broken.
Don't.<eos> There'll be another way.<eos> In time.<eos> The Black Root are coming.<eos> Your John got lucky, but the next sortie will get through, and we'll have lost our chance.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You don't give a shit about the Quad!<eos> No, but Aneela will.<eos> She's leading the vanguard.<eos> She'll already be on her way here, to you, unless I can give her a good reason not to come.
What the hell's going on in here?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it doesn't smell like nothing.<eos> Mike farted.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I-I farted.<eos> That's funny.<eos> 'Cause your farts smell like freshly cooked bacon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Todd, we're adults here, and I'm gonna be honest with you about this.
Thinking about going out and burning down the Santa Monica Pier.<eos> You want to come with?<eos> Yeah, what, was your bacon brother busy?<eos> Come on, T. You're my original bacon brother.<eos> I'm talking OBB.<eos> And you want to hazard a guess as to who's down with OBB?<eos> Every last Tandy.<eos> Oh, come on. Tandy, ever since Mike showed up, you don't have time for me anymore.<eos> Oh, don't you dare.<eos> Uh, every time I try to hang out with you, you're always either with Gail or Melissa.
Okay, yeah.<eos> Look, l-look.<eos> These guys think that there's, uh, you know, just a-a small possibility that you might just have, like, a-a teeny-tiny touch of the virus.<eos> - Just-just a smidgen, really.<eos> - Okay. Okay, okay.<eos> I mean, we're not worried.<eos> I mean, not one bit.<eos> Yeah, you guys reek of confidence.<eos> So I assume that thing's for me, huh?<eos> Hey, look, we're doing this 'cause we care about you.
No.<eos> I fr...<eos> I was not gonna give myself this haircut.<eos> I-I didn't want you to get the victory, though, so I just said that I loved it, but... it was all an act, man.<eos> A freakin' act.<eos> You're real good at acting.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, if you don't like it, why don't we do something about it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome. Now I got to be honest with you.
- Oh, my god. Pull the car over!<eos> - You go through Valencia... - Do it yourself!<eos> - They froze all my BFO accounts.<eos> - I'm not kidding.<eos> But you can move it, and nobody would ever see a trace of it.<eos> Pull the car over right now! Just pull the car over!<eos> Fine!<eos> Wait!<eos> My entire life, I have tried to atone for all your bullshit, and make something decent of myself.<eos> Why do you insist on dragging me down with you?
Are you being for real right now?<eos> Do you... do you still have the welcome packet? - Did he...<eos> - He didn't give me no packet.<eos> You think I'm messing with you?<eos> No, sir, it's just...<eos> I don't know what else to tell you.<eos> You can tell me...<eos> Where my goddamn money's at.<eos> Hi, Nick.<eos> Um, there's an agent Rask here to see you.
I'm just getting started, buddy.<eos> Now come on. Let's move.<eos> Okay, Chopper. Jump.<eos> (SPEAKING IN DROID LANGUAGE) No rocket.<eos> It's too loud.<eos> Now jump!<eos> (SCREAMS) Chop, get this door open.<eos> (CHOPPER COMPLAINING IN DROID LANGUAGE) You're welcome.<eos> 6609. This is it.<eos> Sabine, you're up.
Congratulations, Ezra.<eos> Kanan will be proud of you.<eos> Yeah? Well, he has a funny way of showing it, considering he's never around.<eos> MALE VOICE: I see you.<eos> MALE VOICE: I see you.<eos> Cometome .<eos> Kanan, I was hoping to see you at the briefing.<eos> KANAN: I hear Ezra's doing well.<eos> He has been stepping up, but, uh...<eos> You know, he blames himself for what happened to you and Ahsoka.
Hey, Vanessa, I called...<eos> I'm late for a flight.<eos> I wrote, I tried everything.<eos> I miss you.<eos> What do you want me to say to that?<eos> Let's have dinner tonight. Let me explain.<eos> I'm flying to Bulgaria in three hours.<eos> For a job? But I thought you quit.<eos> I didn't quit working, JC.<eos> I just quit working with you.
That wasn't me.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> You may be ready to die, but I am not ready to let that happen.<eos> And you know what a stubborn son of a bitch I can be.<eos> Boss, can I speak to you please?<eos> God, don't call me that.<eos> Look, I know the plan is to drop me off when we get back to the States, but...<eos> - You want to stay.<eos> - Yes, and Shaw said that I should talk to you about sticking around.
Who are you?<eos> How do you know him?<eos> So you do know him?<eos> What happened to him?<eos> He disappeared.<eos> Can you find him?<eos> Unknown number<eos> Where are you?<eos> I can't get a hold of you.<eos> There's one thing I need to talk to you
Daddy and mommy love you, and a brother takes care of you.<eos> Kids at school said I'm an accident.<eos> They envy you!<eos> I've heard you got married<eos> Has a daughter too!<eos> After Mom passed away, I couldn't get a hold of anyone.<eos> I'm so lonely.<eos> My place will be demolished soon.<eos> I'm begging you, come meet me.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
How could he dare?<eos> He is the disgrace of our family.<eos> Your parents passed away early because of what your worthless brother did.<eos> Hello, I'm the landlord of Zhang Jiahui.<eos> I still have no words from Zhang Jiahui.<eos> It's no good that he's dragging his feet.<eos> But you have to come over and pack his stuff.<eos> You have a brother?<eos> Why didn't you mention it to me?<eos> Honey, I'm talking to you!
Hey, who are you talking to?<eos> - Do you really not know him?<eos> - Go, my husband is gonna yell at me.<eos> Grandma, I want to ask...<eos> Do you know the man in number 48?<eos> Speak up!<eos> - Do you know the man in number 48?<eos> Daddy is not home now!<eos> He told me not to open door for strangers.<eos> Wait. Your mom doesn't live with you?
You won't hear from me either.<eos> So it's a promise then?<eos> Don't just say 'love you', dad.<eos> Mean it!<eos> Okay...<eos> Bye.<eos> What were you saying?<eos> Something with the Gun.. what was it?<eos> At times I feel you fancy a dangerous death...<eos> May be it's not a death wish... I could just be enraged enough to kill you.
You couldn't recognize her?<eos> Remember my friend at the movie theatre I used to work?<eos> Where've you been? What's up with you?<eos> I work here in the day. At night I'm a security guard in a mall.<eos> All the kids want to work at the mall.<eos> Showed them the "Shopping mall sweatshop" film, by Vasanthbalan to scare them from working in the malIs...<eos> I even said that one day... the man who smashes heads will come visit.<eos> Remember how you smashed that dog's head?<eos> What was that you said,"Raman, keep your Raghav away!"<eos> Listen... I came to you for something else.
- Especially, the police force.<eos> - Put them back on.<eos> Why aren't you sleeping enough?<eos> Come over here.<eos> Over here.<eos> Come closer.<eos> Don't move.<eos> How will you ever get sleep?<eos> Go sit outside.<eos> I'll deal with you later.
You want to turn a man on?<eos> Heh, you call Oleg.<eos> I hope it doesn't make you too jealous, but I was just sexting with Randy.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Caroline, get the hose.<eos> Okay, now remember, we're targeting models, gays, and upwardly mobile millennials with discretionary income.<eos> Basically anyone better than us.<eos> Were you talking to me that whole time?<eos> And yes, I was talking to you that whole time.
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic.<eos> Caitlin!<eos> If you leave, I'm gonna have to leave, too.<eos> So you're telling me that... that every time I'm blacking out...<eos> You've become Alchemy.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Alchemy is a monster, he's been terrorizing people for years.<eos> Look, it's not you.<eos> Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe, but you have to start accepting what's happening to you.
So touching. So raw.<eos> I know where I'm going when I die.<eos> You can't send me there.<eos> I'll fight every one of you. Hmm.<eos> So Bonnie can't live without Enzo. And clearly, Stefan can't live without Damon.<eos> But nobody's bothered to ask me what I want.<eos> You're the only one that's truly committed around here, Damon.<eos> You're an asset.<eos> Enzo's nothing but a burden.<eos> So... I guess my only real problem is with you, Bonnie.
He's a known associate of drug kingpin victor perez.<eos> He's a scary dude.<eos> Smart though, to partner up with a high-powered defense attorney.<eos> Which would explain why he's eluded the fbi for years.<eos> I have a friend in the bureau.<eos> I'll call him, I'll see what I can find out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mm-hmm. Oh, look, she comes with an adorable little chocolate cake.<eos> Your child's favorite.<eos> I will deal with you later.
But about that-- we've never met until now, don't know each other.<eos> I fear it's too much for the detective to handle.<eos> Well, it looks like she can handle quite a bit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> well, it seems that wound was re-aggravated in all the hubbub.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> You want to tell me what the hell you were doing?<eos> Well, leading the mouse to the cheese, of course.<eos> I mean, I was gonna be the cat, but then you showed up, so I suppose that makes you the dog.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
Huh. Most of them only last a few months.<eos> Frankly, most people can't stomach something so dark or upsetting.<eos> Right.<eos> God, that has got to smart.<eos> Can I see that again?<eos> Lucifer?<eos> Oh, Detective.<eos> You're here.<eos> Did you know that this room collects all the best parts of the Internet?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
You know, if I ever go back to Hell, I am getting me one of these.<eos> Selfish bastards get to see everything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.<eos> I know where the overlap is.<eos> Amenadiel, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up!<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I see what's going on with you.
Shall we get you untied?<eos> Burning the midnight oil?<eos> Ha, ha, what can I say?<eos> Being everybody's bitch really sucks.<eos> Yeah, well, it won't last forever.<eos> So I've had some time to think, and, um... I realize that<eos> I've been really harsh lately.<eos> It's okay...<eos> No, let me finish, please.<eos> I've been really hard on you for a while now.
Babe, I don't know anything about that!<eos> - Infidelity or homicide?<eos> - Just... Either.<eos> Okay, look, I had a little fling with Daria, but I didn't kill her.<eos> We got into a fight last night when she wanted to come over, because I was with...<eos> So you're saying your wife is your alibi?<eos> Actually, no. I was with another waitress, and Daria found out about that.<eos> And that's what we were fighting about.<eos> Okay, well, I'll need the name and number of the other waitress.<eos> Yes, and I'd like to talk to you about your herb garden, Davis, because I was thinking about taking up rooftop botany.
But the only way to know for sure is to get you into the next shindig.<eos> Which hand stamp guy told me...<eos> Right before he passed out... Is happening as we speak.<eos> Me?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Men only. And I got you a date.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Yes. - Mm-mm.<eos> No way.<eos> - Yes. It's good to have Lucifer there with you as back up.
Don't waste food!<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - You're ruining my life!<eos> Not through there, the dog's in there!<eos> It was a random car crash.<eos> - Are you certain?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But you didn't see anything strange or out of the ordinary?<eos> Like I told you at the hospital and several times before that, no.<eos> What's going on with you?
Well, how did your current husband feel about you visiting your ex?<eos> Oh, that's easy.<eos> Kimo and Wesley hated each other.<eos> Long-standing feud.<eos> God only knows what Kimo would've done if he knew I went to see him.<eos> Where was Kimo this morning?<eos> At ActionCon in Reno.<eos> Signing autographs.<eos> Where's my money, partner?<eos> I will end you!
And, yes, I understand that pants need to be worn every day, now.<eos> Rough day?<eos> Since returning to my employment, I have found the number of daily tasks to be almost insurmountable.<eos> But hey... at least you're not here to take me back to Hell.<eos> You are here to take me back to Hell?<eos> No, Mom, I'm not.<eos> I'm just...<eos> Listen, I was just wondering if your being here is just postponing the inevitable.<eos> I mean, at some point... other siblings will come down here looking for you.<eos> And I'll convince them to let me stay, just like I did you and Lucifer.
Yeah, the tip said that we'd find Kimo here.<eos> I guess we have to just sit tight.<eos> Where did that sandwich come from?<eos> The patrol guys give them to us when we're on stakeouts.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> What the hell?<eos> What part of "Opposite day" don't you understand?<eos> It was a random car accident.<eos> Well, let's agree... that you're wrong.<eos> What is with you?
Right, let me just make myself comfy because I cannot wait to hear how you sent Urinal packing.<eos> And please do not skimp on any of the gory details.<eos> This would never have happened if you'd listened to me earlier.<eos> How is this possible, brother?<eos> I no longer have my powers.<eos> Well, what happened to them?<eos> Oh, I don't know, Luci, pick a sin.<eos> Is it because I released a damned soul from Hell?<eos> Slept with a demon?<eos> Is it because I'm working with you?
But right now I haven't got time to hold your hand, because I need to clear up your mess!<eos> - My mess?<eos> - ‭Uriel's still out there.<eos> And the clock is up-- which means the detective is in grave danger.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What?<eos> You wear the orange vest, you can do whatever you want? !<eos> Stop it!<eos> Why are you barking now?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Dad showed me an open door.<eos> Does that mean I was meant to take you back to hell or was he insinuating that hell was getting drafty?<eos> Nobody bloody knows, because the selfish bastard won't just tell us!<eos> And I'm sick of it.<eos> No more.<eos> No more.<eos> There's my Lightbringer.<eos> My Morningstar.<eos> Uriel was so small when he was a child.<eos> All he ever wanted was to play with you and the older kids.
Unfortunate name, but best stroopwafel in Hollywood.<eos> The napkin is definitely from today.<eos> The syrup is still wet to the touch.<eos> And undoubtedly tasty.<eos> So if the shooter bought this stroop...<eos> whatever you call it...<eos> With his credit card, we can track his identity.<eos> So we need to get to the food truck and talk to the owner.<eos> I will put out a BOLO.<eos> What is it with you and bolos?
I'm a doctor.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> He handles many of our hospital's malpractice suits.<eos> He's married to the other victim?<eos> - Yes, but the connection we've been looking for isn't between them, it's between you, the spouses.<eos> So, you think the shooter's upset because of one of these malpractice suits?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe he's taking it out on their loved ones.<eos> Can you give us a list of all the cases that Edgar litigated for you?<eos> When are you gonna tell me what's going on with you?

Or should I say, Happy Halloween.<eos> Are these the files?<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> Well, if you ask permission, people can say no, but flash a badge to the right sap and voilà.<eos> This is mine.<eos> All right, chill out, Daniel.<eos> What's a little badge borrowing between friends?<eos> I mean, at least I didn't have to use this.<eos> You stole my gun and my badge?<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?
Oh, please, don't give me that crap.<eos> You never do what you have to do,<eos> Lucifer.<eos> You only ever do what you want to.<eos> That is not true.<eos> There's a lot of things that I didn't want to do.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because if I only ever did what I wanted to do, then right now, I'd do this.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
But she's the love of my life. Perfect.<eos> Let's make it a threesome. That is not me!<eos> Relax, you'll get your turn.<eos> What's your problem, huh?<eos> You gotta sign up, pal.<eos> Good scene, man. You crushed it.<eos> You too, pal.<eos> Detective Douche!<eos> How dare you subject me to this pathetic caricature?<eos> You have the nerve to stand there and accuse me of making fun of you, after everything you've done in the last couple days. Hell, ever since we first met.
Is he down there?<eos> I mean, 'cause he was... you know.... one... he was one bad mama jama.<eos> I think I've broken my therapist.<eos> And now she's somewhere to the left of totally useless and to the right of babbling lunatic.<eos> Oh, so she's you in a skirt.<eos> Very funny.<eos> This is serious, Detective.<eos> I'm actually a bit worried for her.<eos> Hmm, I'm sure she'll be fine, but if you need anyone to talk to, I'm here.<eos> This is actually something I can't discuss with you.
Oh, so you admit that you led a human to it?<eos> Well, not a human.<eos> More like ten.<eos> - Ten?<eos> - Maybe 12. Uh...<eos> - But...<eos> - 15? Only my craftiest clients.<eos> I mean, I had to make sure that someone would actually follow through and dig the damn thing up.<eos> Why in the world would you tell people?<eos> What is wrong with you?
It's not... it's not that-that great.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> They're here.<eos> Yeah, we should probably warn Lucifer.<eos> Well?<eos> There's no blade.<eos> Right, use the back way out.<eos> Ah, Detective, you know, after reflection, I think you're right.<eos> Parking space thievery is no motive for murder.<eos> What is going on with you?
Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.<eos> He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Huh. Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.<eos> Prints just came back.<eos> Eric Cooper.<eos> How did you...?<eos> Never mind. I'll meet you at the Cooper building.
I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I was, um...<eos> I was pretty surprised when you called me.<eos> Even more surprised you actually invited me out.<eos> You know, as soon as I walked into that interrogation room, I felt a spark between us.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm surprised you're still single.<eos> Lucky me.<eos> Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, I've been a little bit gun-shy about the whole dating thing.
I admit I enjoy working with her, but adore, that's a bit much.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You've sacrificed more for her than you ever have for anyone else.<eos> Have you forgotten?<eos> You killed your brother, my son, to protect her.<eos> Do you think there's anything even remotely similar that she would do for you?<eos> I suppose...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, if all goes according to plan in that courtroom, you will know.<eos> Know that she doesn't deserve you, because she doesn't care about you like you care about her.
I met the mother again.<eos> And I found out what the result of that miracle was.<eos> Or, rather, who.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - Detective.<eos> - Sorry, I thought...<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> Are you on your way out?<eos> I am, yes.<eos> - Oh... - To see you, actually.
- Mr. Dubois, what you don't understand is those kids carry a pain that people like you can't even begin to imagine.<eos> See, you ain't never had to overcome nothing, have you?<eos> Now, what do you think happens to one of those kids if they get into some nonsense?<eos> You know, kids get into nonsense, but unlike you, they don't have family connections to get them off a DUI scot-free.<eos> So who is going to give them a second chance, huh?<eos> You?<eos> With your clean-shaven, slick-talking ass, acting all holier-than-thou, could've killed somebody but didn't, got a slap on the wrist for drunk driving ass?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> You a joke!<eos> Well, damn. Only other person I ever seen her go off on like that is you.
Yes.<eos> Yes, yes. - Yes. - Uh...<eos> Hell... yes.<eos> What did... What did I just say yes to?<eos> I don't care, but...<eos> Uh, well, Kitty, why don't you tell him. Okay.<eos> So this beautiful lady, your mom, had an idea...<eos> I'm here rehearsing.<eos> Getting ready to go on a South American tour, and I want you with me, because we found a song that's perfect for us.<eos> I just want to sing with you, and I think it would be amazing.
I like to call it mutually assured destruction.<eos> You finally came.<eos> No, no, no... stop, stop, stop! No, stop!<eos> Look, we good.<eos> Yeah. Everything's okay.<eos> Sorry I didn't come see you sooner.<eos> Aww. At least you're here.<eos> Yeah, I hate seeing you like this.<eos> Such a waste of your talent and everything.<eos> It is what it is. But... What's up with you, though?
Empire XStream is your baby.<eos> No, what makes me happy is you two no longer have any excuse for this lack of accountability.<eos> I told y'all there was money on the table to be made with this Gram and Hakeem beef.<eos> Tiana is writing her clapback song right now.<eos> Iflf I can get her to sing the song.<eos> - If?<eos> - After the mess you made by using her vocals on Hakeem's diss track? You need to stop dipping and dapping on my side of the business.<eos> Okay, well, get me that song, so I can promote it on my side of the business. Or this "game on" of yours is gonna be "game over."<eos> All right. Whatever.<eos> The hell is wrong with you right now?
You're the one. You put too much on me, Dad.<eos> I put everything on you.<eos> And I swear before God, I'm not gonna let no Lucifer Lyons, or whatever the hell his name is, get in the way.<eos> Barry's a good boy, Loretha.<eos> The kind that's gonna lift you up and not drag you down.<eos> Hey, Lucious.<eos> What are you doing slithering around here?<eos> Ear hustling?<eos> I work here, remember?<eos> I'm just worried about you, you know.
I work here, remember?<eos> I'm just worried about you, you know.<eos> Yeah. I want what's best for you.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> Well, then why are you giving Angelo such a hard way to go, huh?<eos> 'Cause he don't know you like I do.<eos> He don't know where you come from. He don't know what your drive is.<eos> Well, what he is is a good man, Lucious. A man who will lift his woman up, instead of drag her through every kind of hell.<eos> Look, it's true. I don't know him.<eos> All I know is he's got a string of socialites that he dates. And I wonder why he's dating you.
They sleep.<eos> But you can't afford to do that.<eos> You see, as a patriarch of the family, you're responsible for teaching your young ones how to survive in this cold world.<eos> Jamal don't understand that.<eos> He thinks it's all Kumbaya and love, but he's wrong.<eos> It's kill or be killed.<eos> Eat or be eaten.<eos> Look, I know you're trying to get me up under you like how you got Andre up under you.<eos> I want you to crush Gram because it means money for Empire, and Empire XStream needs that kind of fanfare and activity.<eos> But I want you to destroy him, 'cause you're a Lyon, and I want the world to know that you're not someone to be trifled with.
Wack-ass performance was your idea in the first place!<eos> I shouldn't have never listened to you.<eos> You just used me to do a performance 'cause you can't get out there and do it yourself!<eos> Fake-ass wannabe MC!<eos> I will kill you right...<eos> Shut your big ass up, Frankenstein!<eos> Come on! Keep rolling! Keep filming!<eos> No, stop!<eos> Turn it off!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you? !
I'll see you in three months, Hollo...<eos> Ms. Lyon.<eos> Give the kids my love, Sharlene.<eos> So you went to a lot of trouble for me, huh?<eos> I saw your boys tonight on Empire XStream, and, uh...<eos> I realized something about you and your family. Yeah, I'm sure the whole world did.<eos> Well, I realized that... fighting is your family's way of life.<eos> But somehow, y'all got the idea that I'm...<eos> I'm not a fighter. Look, I am not trying to fight with you right now.<eos> Baby girl, I'm not talking about fighting with you...

You ready to be about that WITSEC life?<eos> WITSEC?<eos> You must be smoking.<eos> You ain't gonna be walking around in the sunshine after giving me a body.<eos> What body?<eos> The one you and Lucious hid in a slab of concrete back in Camden.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> Look, I ain't the one to be playing with, Shine.<eos> I'm squeezing the Lyon family on all sides.<eos> Got Cookie's P.O. to tighten the leash on her, and I can turn that same heat on you anytime I want.
- Man, whatever.<eos> - She's a Lyon.<eos> She knows when somebody's singing off-key.<eos> I got something she'll love.<eos> How's that, Daddy's baby?<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Are you coming in here to thank me for helping your ass with Shine?<eos> 'Cause you know you still owe me for that, right?<eos> Oh, relax.<eos> As soon as Shine gets back from Vegas, he's gonna sit down with you, for you to be the head of his AR.
I hear she's dope.<eos> Freda's the one, Shine.<eos> She's all yours.<eos> You know, her father was locked up with Lucious and Frank Gathers.<eos> He got killed up there.<eos> The whole concept of the album, it's about my family, the secrets.<eos> I'm-a set us all free.<eos> Jamal, wake up.<eos> I think Jamal O.D.'d.<eos> Tiana, why is it like pulling teeth every time I talk to you?

Nessa!<eos> - I'm s...<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh, my... - What did you do?<eos> It was an accident, Tiana.<eos> - I'm sorry, I'll get you another one.<eos> - How?<eos> ! This is couture. There isn't another!<eos> Well, just tell me what I need to do.<eos> What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Helene Von Wyeth will destroy me for this!<eos> That bitch didn't even want me in her stupid whitewashed show to begin with.<eos> The only reason she teamed up with Empire is because she got dragged out for doing some wack-ass Out of Africa collection with no black people in it.<eos> Then homegirl tries to shove me in this damn dress meant for some anorexic white chick.<eos> That skinny, racist bitch can't handle my realness!<eos> And now she's gonna say I burned that raggedy-ass rag on purpose.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Yeah...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Sodom and Gomorrah!<eos> Stop it right now!<eos> Y'all humping' on the table like yard dogs!<eos> That's where I eat!<eos> I was just about to have a snack.<eos> Don't you go nowhere.<eos> Mama?<eos> I want to talk to you about this doctor place you been at.
If you planning on doing some of them trash ass, airing out the family laundry or something, you'd be better off taking a handful of them damn pills all at once and take a permanent dirt nap and I'll see you in the next lifetime.<eos> I'm off my meds.<eos> Good.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - All right. All right, from the top.<eos> So, Rockaway Beach, day after tomorrow?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Ooh, Alonzo, I owe you, baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got to go, but I owe you big time, okay?
I'm on my way.<eos> I'll get my coat.<eos> Wait.<eos> Uh Okay.<eos> Why don't I take this one solo, okay?<eos> We just -- we don't know what we're walking into here.<eos> We never know.<eos> We're Hunters.<eos> Right. Um...<eos> Okay, I-I can't do my job if I'm worried about you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he was a Hunter.<eos> He, uh, he rolled into town a few months back, tried to convince me he was FBI Agent Fox Mulder.<eos> He was chasing a pack of ghouls, and I helped.<eos> He'd pass through every once in a while after that, and we'd grab co-- coffee or...something.<eos> Oh, he was a good man.<eos> The -- the wake's tonight, and, um, they're gonna salt and burn the body tomorrow.<eos> I can't believe I just said that like it's something normal.<eos> Well, we're gonna come with you.
Do you ever shut up?<eos> Man.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Hey, you can't leave me here!<eos> Father...<eos> Yes, I have her.<eos> I'm here now.<eos> It's all locked.<eos> That is not fair.<eos> You know, I try with you, I really do.
Land of gridlock, Botox, overtaxing, underachieving, smell of sweaty desperation.<eos> I mean, you can't breathe.<eos> The beaches are toxic.<eos> You got dudes in skinny jeans wearing sunglasses inside.<eos> [ Sighs ] Oh. Image-obsessed narcissists.<eos> I do like the yoga pants, though. [ Chuckles ]<eos> When was the last time we were in L.A.?<eos> About 10 years ago, doing a vengeful spirit?<eos> Man, that seems like forever ago.<eos> [ Hits arm ] Tryin' to talk to you here.
Okay, you know what?<eos> We're not actually here for a meeting.<eos> Vince's show tonight...<eos> where is it?<eos> Who are you guys?<eos> Look, you must've noticed, Vince is different.<eos> I... don't know!<eos> You're messing with hellfire, Russell.<eos> You will find out where that show is.<eos> You will tell me or I will end you.
Thrilled.<eos> Be more thrilled if we had new music to sell.<eos> What?<eos> [ Inhales deeply ] Well, Vince was a no-show at the studio.<eos> Again.<eos> The muse... guess she took a powder.<eos> Relax, Russell.<eos> Tonight's show?<eos> It's gonna kill.<eos> I took a chance on you, Vince.
So wh-why are you pushing me away?<eos> I love you, Jessie, but you have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> How can you even say that?<eos> I have stood by you through all of this.<eos> You seriously don't think I understand what you're going through?<eos> If you understood, then you would stop.<eos> 'Cause that's what I need.<eos> To not worry about what he might do to you.<eos> If you don't get that, - then you don't understand me at all.<eos> - Right. Because I never, ever have to worry about you.

You wanna tell us why you're blocking our path, mister?<eos> Just on my way to a funeral, friend.<eos> My-my brother got killed and I got awful drunk when I heard about it last night and I got in a poker game and I lost my horse and my gun.<eos> I lost my coat.<eos> I'm sorry to hear your trouble.<eos> But you ain't answered my question now, did you?<eos> Well, I'm hoping maybe I can catch a ride with you fellas.<eos> I'm sorry, can't do that.<eos> Company policy, no-no passengers.<eos> I'm not gonna argue with you about that.
Alive.<eos> Alive?<eos> He ain't killed nobody yet, has he?<eos> Not as far as we know.<eos> Good.<eos> Word has it he used to run with a few local men<eos> I'd like to see hanged.<eos> I'm hoping he might be amenable to helping me ferret them out and take them down.<eos> You don't think taking up with an outlaw might be bad for business?<eos> I'm talking to you, aren't I?
Doctor Forrester?<eos> I've come for the bandages for...<eos> Laura Lee?<eos> It's a miracle, Bonnie!<eos> It's hallelujah!<eos> Look who just showed up.<eos> You know, my shoulder still hurts when it rains from your gunshot.<eos> You can't arrest me.<eos> Judge said it was accidental.<eos> I'm not sore with you, never was.
Talk me through it.<eos> He was the 14th client that day, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And... what did he want from you? What did he do to you?<eos> He wanted me to be very young.<eos> To pretend to be a child.<eos> He wanted to be rough.<eos> But... is that wrong, if he didn't think you could feel?<eos> It wasn't his fault you were conscious - he didn't know.<eos> Isn't it better he exercises his fantasies with you, and in a brothel, rather than take them out on someone who can actually feel?
Well, who does, which you?<eos> You're both.<eos> You're all sides of you, and I'll take the bloody lot.<eos> There's no future in a lie, K.<eos> There's no future for us anyway.<eos> We'll never have a child.<eos> We'll never grow old together.<eos> I want to forget what I am.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Not if I'm with you.
- I'll... I'll take some water.<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Water.<eos> Stay hydrated.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So we've been talking, all of us, over the last 24 hours.<eos> We're ready to make this a reality.<eos> But the deal needs to be with just you.
Just... please.<eos> - No. Please, just stop talking.<eos> Just leave me alone for a second.<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> What am I supposed to say when you start acting like I'm a violent person?<eos> What are you supposed to say?<eos> You are supposed to say, "I'm sorry," and then shut the fuck up!<eos> You are not supposed to make this all about you.<eos> I mean, you know what really sucks?<eos> When... When I first fell in love with you, when I really knew for the first time that I wanted to be with you, I mean, there were all those other guys there, okay?
I really don't care.<eos> It's cool, sis.<eos> - Do I stink?<eos> - What?<eos> Do I stink?<eos> Give me that.<eos> God, I can't stop sweating.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Izzy?<eos> Someone to see you.
You let your old man work you like that?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, hey, try again.<eos> Try again.<eos> Back me down.<eos> A'ight.<eos> Try to stop me, a'ight?<eos> Just try to stop me.<eos> Why you let that bitch play you like that?
There's a lot going on.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Bailing on them at this point, all due respect,<eos> - is pretty rude.<eos> - I'm not bailing on them.<eos> I'm sending you.<eos> Wait, wait, what? !<eos> Look, you wrote the speech.<eos> It's all you.<eos> And, besides, the kids will relate to you more.
I think about actually doing it, I...<eos> I kind of feel like... throwing up or-or passing out, and-and that's not how I really want to feel.<eos> No, that's not ideal.<eos> So why can't we wait?<eos> Of course we can.<eos> It's just when I think of being separated from you for that long without some kind of plan...<eos> I don't want to risk it.<eos> So... let's make a plan.<eos> I will finish out my semester here and then I'll jo...<eos> I'll join you in Oxford for the summer.
- Muffle starboard and proceed.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Listen up, gentlemen.<eos> Looks like we're gonna have to start sweeping with just the information we got.<eos> Stay as clear as you can from the third mine in each series.<eos> I need you to cut the chains to the bottom in a narrow avenue ahead of the ship, then you are going to gently move each group out of the way, one by one.<eos> Are you all ready?<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> All right, mine-group seven, that's you, Kudelski.
Oh, man.<eos> - I know you. - No, you don't know me.<eos> - Mmm... oh, no.<eos> - What?<eos> My breath. Oh, I love it.<eos> What is that?<eos> Curry?<eos> - Are you kidding me? - Like a very deep curry?<eos> That is not... that's, like, some freaky shit.<eos> Ooh, I like that. - What are you...
I can't afford it.<eos> Come on, you really think I'm here for money?<eos> We do, yes.<eos> I'm looking for Alfred. Also, could you pick up Lottie from Kaya's?<eos> I'm getting a job and Van's on a date.<eos> You got a job?<eos> Hey, good for her.<eos> Yes, I got a job. And thanks, Mom.<eos> I'm your son, Earn.<eos> I used to live in there with you, remember?
Whatever.<eos> I've been inconsiderate.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you doing tomorrow?<eos> I want to take you to dinner. - No, it's too late.<eos> - It's too late?<eos> Yeah, you messed up.<eos> Can I buy you dinner and watch you eat it from across the room?<eos> You know, I can get one of those corny niggas to eat it with you.
Wait for us if you get there first.<eos> Are you sure he's there?<eos> Listen, Tony.<eos> You wanted him, we got him.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> It's the 21st century, Edgar.<eos> There are places that will digitize old files for you.<eos> Could've saved us the trouble.<eos> Live and learn.<eos> Pleasure working with you back in the day.
I'm gonna dunk on a bitch!<eos> I don't like this nigger. I don't know, he's kind of funny. I mean, he's hot right now.<eos> You should work with him. I mean, speaking as your manager, you know.<eos> Just 'cause you dressed like a 6th grader don't make you my manager, man.<eos> Hey, we're starting soon so you should get dressed.<eos> - Cool. - Locker room is this way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, where you gonna be at?<eos> I'm probably gonna try and find some corner to hang out in, you know.<eos> After the game, I'll just find you.
You're a rapper.<eos> That's your job.<eos> ♪ Whatever I did doesn't matter ♪<eos> ♪ You know that I'll always be better ♪<eos> ♪ Sometimes I'm crazy and you know it ♪<eos> Hey, man, how the game go?<eos> Pff, terrible. You wanna see that?<eos> No, man.<eos> Hell, it doesn't matter, man.<eos> ♪ Whatever I do, girl, just forget about it ♪ - What is wrong with you? - Nothing.
The money's for something else.<eos> Save me the trouble of following you and just tell me.<eos> I'm financing a secret hideout.<eos> Sorry, kid, you're gonna have to do better than that.<eos> You're welcome to stay while I'm at work.<eos> -There's nothing in the fridge--<eos> -I'll be out before you're home.<eos> I'd like to come back tonight, if that's all right.<eos> It'll be late, though.<eos> I could come with you. No.
They want us out, and dead.<eos> The Tagalog are tough, they're very violent, and they have great allies:<eos> the heat, malaria, typhoons and beasts.<eos> You're very young, very green, and inept<eos> If you want to survive, you'll have to learn fast.<eos> Whoever doesn't, God have mercy on him.<eos> We'll survive.<eos> This little Virgin is lucky.<eos> Lucky for everyone, or just you?<eos> If you want to trust in the Virgin, it's up to you, but the men butchered here had crucifixes too.
If it goes wrong, it's all over, there'll be no one in any state to defend the church, but if it succeeds...<eos> We'll go in two groups so they think there are more of us and the surprise is greater.<eos> I'll attack on the right flank, Sergeant Jimeno, the left.<eos> I'll give you time to take your positions.<eos> We can't risk any signals.<eos> Wait for me to open fire.<eos> How long do we wait here?<eos> - Until the lieutenant opens fire.<eos> - What's he waiting for?<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Can't reach the phone.<eos> No... almost...<eos> - Need some help?<eos> - You aren't helping me at all.<eos> You're not helping me at all.<eos> - Fait la force!<eos> Touie, can we just...<eos> Step off.<eos> Hey, Touie, let me just to talk to you for a second.<eos> Touie... Let me just talk to you, son.
Well, Mis...<eos> Mister, uh, Pa...<eos> - Mr. Paper Boi... - Mister, yeah.<eos> What would you consider yourself?<eos> A rapper?<eos> A straight rapper?<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> Well, I did some research on your lyrics, and they're actually very pro sexual-spectrum.<eos> - Oh? - Pro-what?<eos> "If I eff with you, you my N-word, you my N-word for life."
Hurry up!<eos> Move!<eos> Go!<eos> Leave us!<eos> Get the hell out!<eos> Out now!<eos> Hurry!<eos> It'll be safer for you to stay here.<eos> No, I don't want to stay.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Oh, I'm definitely using this on these bozos up here.<eos> This is... this is a bad idea.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Sorry to see you go, Sean.<eos> Hey, if the job don't want me, then I don't want the job.<eos> Do yourself a favor.<eos> Just leave that at the doorstep when you walk out of here.<eos> You served this city proudly.<eos> Just carry that with you.
- Get off me... get off me!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Justin's at Chicago Med.<eos> I found him in the trunk of his car with a bullet in his head.<eos> - I'm so sorry...<eos> - So I need to know.<eos> Was my son with anyone when you saw him?<eos> Yeah, a girl, but not Olive.<eos> She waited for him outside.<eos> Justin came to you.
Justin came to you.<eos> What did he want?<eos> To borrow some money.<eos> Said the girl was in a jam.<eos> And then this guy showed up, and all three of them got into an argument.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What guy?<eos> I heard her call him Ginger.<eos> I told Justin if there's trouble, he should go to you.
Dead husband, a hungry kid... the girl has bills.<eos> She's a paralegal.<eos> She's not starving.<eos> Look, just call robbery-homicide.<eos> Get the details on these home invasions.<eos> Look, if she was involved in the robberies, it seems like Justin probably knew about them... you know, whatever that means, but it's unlikely that Melissa ran a robbery crew by herself.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Just that he might've had a different role in all this.<eos> Hank, come on.<eos> You want me to be honest with you, Hank?
I would've known.<eos> Well, you didn't even know he was here last month.<eos> You had to find that out second-hand.<eos> Hank.<eos> Why didn't he come to me, Al?<eos> Hey. Hey, come on.<eos> Listen.<eos> All that matters is finding who did this.<eos> And however you want to play this, Hank...<eos> Hey, I'm with you on this, till the end.
Not yet.<eos> Erin?<eos> Erin?<eos> Got a package for you in the trunk.<eos> I'm Justin's dad.<eos> Just hear me out for two seconds, okay?<eos> Two seconds.<eos> I did not kill Justin.<eos> But I know who did, and I want that son of a bitch as bad as you.<eos> From where Melissa Wilds tried to fight you off.
- Where's what?<eos> - Where's the mask?<eos> - You really think I carve people up and hang them up like pieces of meat?<eos> If you think I'm a killer, prove it.<eos> Emma, we need to talk.<eos> Emma?<eos> Emma, hang on!<eos> - Emma, wait!<eos> - Emma, come back here!<eos> We're all really worried about you, Emma!
It's unreal.<eos> All that stuff about Piper, everything that she said...<eos> - Yes. - Right to our faces, every day.<eos> Hey, you guys.<eos> Enjoyed your freak show at the carnival last night.<eos> Give it a rest, Hayley.<eos> People are idiots.<eos> Yeah, you'd think I'd be used to it.<eos> Hey! There he is.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you, huh?
My house, after school.<eos> I'll prove to you it's not Zoe.<eos> Once we play this tape, we can't unplay it.<eos> And you know that there's something horrible on there.<eos> Most likely, but we need to hear it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I have to play it.<eos> A lot of people are trying to help me right now, and it seems to be turning out for the worst.<eos> We're just worried about you, Emma.
- That was at the Grindhouse.<eos> I had no idea that she was recording that.<eos> Add to the Emma file.<eos> Emma's clearly threatening me.<eos> I'm currently a target for her paranoia and aggression.<eos> After witnessing her attack on Hayley Meyers and the vandalism of my office, it's evident that Emma has seriously violent tendencies.<eos> - But I need her.<eos> - She needs me?<eos> So, I'll find a way to break through.<eos> - She's obviously obsessed with you.
Something about instructors and kids in the attic.<eos> Well, Ms. Lang and Piper both grew up there.<eos> What?<eos> That is one piece of the Piper puzzle I could never find.<eos> - How did you...?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> But it ends with, we're going there now.<eos> I have to see where they grew up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll meet you there.

Did you know about this party?<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look, someone set it up to make it look like we planned this.<eos> You and me.<eos> - Okay, then it was probably the killer.<eos> - I know!<eos> That's what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> He led me here.<eos> - Did Noah come with you?
You're in a rocket.<eos> It's at its apogee.<eos> You're in that moment where everything is perfectly still... right before you're about to fall.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> I feel... dizzy.<eos> Weightless.<eos> There's a window... and you can see the Earth below.<eos> It's a blue, swirling marble.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> And I'm there with you.
That's not true.<eos> The killer is after me and Audrey.<eos> He did what he did to get to us.<eos> That's not your fault.<eos> You didn't choose any of this.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But, if we want it to stop... it's on us.<eos> It's on me.<eos> It's not.<eos> It's not on you.
- Hi.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Pretty good.<eos> I think I did all right today.<eos> How are things over there?<eos> Great. Everything's great.<eos> - No, a braid.<eos> - Is that Joanie?<eos> Can I talk to her?<eos> Hey, Mom wants to talk to you.
I needed a cup of coffee and a computer, so...<eos> I blended in right here.<eos> It's like I'm invisible.<eos> Joe probably hates me now. Oh, no.<eos> No, and even if he is pissed, he'll get over it.<eos> Joe can be... surprisingly forgiving.<eos> Maybe it's because he's screwed up his own life so many times.<eos> Hey, if you don't want me to tell him where you are, I won't.<eos> But he really just wants to walk you through your options.<eos> He's worried about you. And look,
- Really?<eos> Ryan?<eos> Why'd you lie to me?<eos> Why'd you cut me out?<eos> I didn't do either of those things. - I planned to bring you in.<eos> - Bring me in?<eos> I created the whole thing.<eos> I put the code out there, really made it free when you didn't have the guts to do it yourself.<eos> And I've been out there ever since, defending your name, telling the real story.<eos> I've been worried about you.
A hacker that violates the CFAA can't touch a computer for at least five years...<eos> Five years?<eos> That's insane!<eos> And that's an impossible choice!<eos> It's better than 10 years in prison.<eos> That's the maximum.<eos> I know it sounds like a long time, but you're young, and it's like you told me, destruction leads to transformation.<eos> You've got plenty of time to reinvent yourself.<eos> Yeah, that's what I want to do.<eos> Start again with you, like when you first hired me.
Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause we can change our flight.<eos> Tom, I'm fine.<eos> Okay? I'm ready to leave this place.<eos> You know...<eos> God, maybe... there will be some things that they won't have - in Japan.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, maybe I should go to the store and just... make sure that we have everything we need.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Good idea. You want me to go with you?
You made it sound like World War III from your message.<eos> Yeah, Dad won't let me go to the party, which is bullshit because you explicitly told me I could go.<eos> I'm sure he has good reasons, Bug.<eos> There is no good reason why I should be stuck here making pasta from scratch with freaking Chef Boyardee and some random lady.<eos> Is it that Michelle woman?<eos> Bingo-rama.<eos> Look, when you're at Dad's house, his word goes. You know the rules.<eos> - Can you just talk to him?<eos> - No, I don't have time...<eos> Dad! Mom wants to talk to you.
Is it bad this morning?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'm just a little stiff.<eos> Nothing a hot shower won't fix.<eos> This is ridiculous. I'm making you switch bedrooms with me.<eos> Climbing these stairs is totally dumbass. Yeah.<eos> I'm sure that would work out great for you.<eos> Nice fancy bed, big closet...<eos> Oh, it's really the bathroom I'm after.<eos> Working with you was... the most fun I ever had in my life.
Joe, I... I just wanted to apologize again for yesterday.<eos> The way I behaved...<eos> I was way, way, way out of line.<eos> I was out of line, too.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I'll see you. - Okay.<eos> Hey, they're ready downstairs.<eos> Donna...<eos> I can't work with you.
I was way, way, way out of line.<eos> I was out of line, too.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I'll see you. - Okay.<eos> Hey, they're ready downstairs.<eos> Donna...<eos> I can't work with you.<eos> What?<eos> I can't work with you.
That's why I need your help to stop him.<eos> You got plenty of smart guys around you.<eos> You gotta understand.<eos> We get hundreds of threats a day against the President.<eos> I don't have the resources to scout a shot taken 500 yards outside of our tier-three perimeter.<eos> Yeah, I got a handful of guys, but no one like you.<eos> Daddy, we gotta finish the porch before Mommy gets home.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there, honey.<eos> As you can see, I'm kind of busy.<eos> What happened to you, Gunny?
Said we could do it ourselves, any one of us.<eos> What about Brad and Travis?<eos> What about them?<eos> They want their cut, too.<eos> You really wanna have that conversation now?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually.<eos> Use your fucking head, Ronnie, will you?<eos> Hey, I am using my fucking head.<eos> - What's the matter with you
Mr. Gupte?<eos> Kishan Nagar Police Station, SP Sharma.<eos> Kanta, Satya speaking.<eos> - Satya, are you drunk?<eos> - No.<eos> I am bringing with me, what you have been looking for all over Jaipur.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Closer to Sanganer.<eos> I will be there in half an hour.<eos> - Are they both with you?
- No.<eos> She works at the market.<eos> Sweetheart?<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - No.<eos> Nobody's seen the bitch.<eos> I'm pissed off, brother.<eos> Let's go for some ice cream.<eos> Something cold.<eos> I'd like to talk to you about what happened tonight.
Relax, relax, relax!<eos> Detaining the prisoners.<eos> Your CI hooked us a pretty big fish.<eos> Yeah, he's a winner.<eos> We captured about 45 of them.<eos> Wonder if he'll give us Escobar.<eos> - Don't know, we'll see what Carrillo gets.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Carrillo told me that he talked to you.
- Like the good old days, Pablo.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> What's up, Maritza?<eos> What happened?<eos> The police are looking for me.<eos> They want to put a bullet in my head.<eos> I'm sorry, Maritza.<eos> I thought something good would come from all this.<eos> Something good?<eos> Let me come work with you.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?<eos> - And where is Velasco?<eos> - Boss, I have no idea.<eos> Find him for me.<eos> Right away, boss.<eos> - I can't believe you're cooking.<eos> - But you know I always helped my mother.<eos> I helped while you ate.<eos> You know, I'm very happy that Pablo brought me here.<eos> But I'm worried about you.
Look, I don't care what you do with the commies and the paramilitaries.<eos> But as soon as your ongoing operations involve narcos... you're in my backyard.<eos> Where were you?<eos> - I went to church.<eos> - I told you it wasn't safe.<eos> And I told you that it would be fine.<eos> And look, everything's fine.<eos> How could you put the children's lives at risk?<eos> No one here is in danger.<eos> I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
Mmm. Stress is dangerous.<eos> How's the weed working out?<eos> I haven't been smoking a lot.<eos> The first man who smoked marijuana was a Chinese emperor.<eos> He burned the plant because he was attracted to its smell.<eos> But when he inhaled the smoke, he saw a blue jay.<eos> And the bird told him to conquer his neighboring empires.<eos> And that's what he did.<eos> All right.<eos> With you until death, Don Pablo.
These are the codes for the radio.<eos> I'll put them here.<eos> And here is some cash.<eos> This is for you.<eos> - No, Pablo.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> - It's for your help.<eos> I'm doing this for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm worried about you, Pablo.
The laughs.<eos> I think the ambassador wants to see you.<eos> I guess word about this Miami Herald thing is spreading like a prairie fire.<eos> And bring your passport.<eos> I think you're going home, but... you didn't hear that from me.<eos> Tata?<eos> Tata, can you hear me?<eos> Pablo?<eos> It's me, my love.<eos> Finally, I can speak to you, my love.
You can survive prison.<eos> We both know that won't happen.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> - Listen to me, Pablo.<eos> - They're talking.<eos> -You will always be Pablo Escobar.<eos> -Boss.<eos> You will always be that man that's admired and followed.<eos> My man.<eos> My love, there's a lot of journalists who want to speak with you.
Or freemen... really free?<eos> Think about it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ciro, I've thought about it.<eos> There's a procession tonight in his mom's town.<eos> He always goes, it's important to him.<eos> That's the right time.<eos> The right time?<eos> You know for what.<eos> He wants you there to tell you he accepts your conditions, but he really wants to take you out...
- And Prince?<eos> - He's here and thinks like me.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> Because we've decided to be freemen.<eos> I'll come for you, and explain it over coffee.<eos> You can have your dealing spot back.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Let me come up.<eos> Why?<eos> I have to talk to you.
The bitter wailing<eos> Of the sorrowful mother<eos> She wanders among the squads<eos> Looking for her beloved...<eos> Did you ever think, Ciro...<eos> The snake is always with the Holy Virgin<eos> and never with Jesus.<eos> She's the only one who knows what to do.<eos> With one foot, she holds it firm to the ground, without needing to crush it.<eos> I wanted to do that with you. But I'm not the Holy Virgin.

Ms. Tessmacher!<eos> She cries more than Halle Berry at award shows.<eos> Well, if you hate her so much, why don't you fire her?<eos> Normally, you'd ax an assistant the second they brought you a latte one degree off.<eos> Oh, Ker-rah.<eos> I don't even know what normal is anymore.<eos> Ms. Grant, what's wrong?<eos> What could be wrong?<eos> I have followed every one of my passions, I've achieved everything I've ever wanted to achieve, and I'm at the very top of my game.<eos> The question is, Ker-rah, what the hell is wrong with you?
- No, come on.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - No.<eos> Babe. - No, one second.<eos> - Let me just...<eos> - Don't.<eos> - Just wait for me.<eos> - Nick.<eos> - Not here.<eos> I'll meet you in the car. I'll meet you in the car.
- What, Del?<eos> Someone's here for you.<eos> - So, what'd he say?<eos> - Uh, well, he-he... he needs it back.<eos> - How much?<eos> - All of it, except for Ronald's 300.<eos> Look, it was...<eos> - Do you wanna get some food or something?<eos> - Food? It was what?<eos> Okay, okay, okay, obviously, I wasn't 100% transparent with you...
What's going on, baby?<eos> - Oh, bruh.<eos> Hey, man, good to see you.<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> It's been, what, 10, 15 years at least, right?<eos> - You still looking good, bruh.<eos> - No, man, 10, 15 years on the knees and ankles ain't that good.<eos> - Damn, it's good to see you, bruh.<eos> - Good to see you too, dawg.<eos> Hey, can I holla at you for a minute, dawg?
- He did. - Yeah.<eos> Actually, yeah.<eos> Oh man, that man is a piece of work.<eos> You know, I don't think I ever had a conversation with him that we didn't come around to the bottom line.<eos> Me, I just got involved with something I care about, - and I got lucky.<eos> - Yeah, so you love dogs, huh?<eos> - No, I love money.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> Hey, nice round.<eos> Great playing with you, kid.
We launch in 33 days.<eos> Oh, I didn't even tell you this.<eos> We have a meeting with Alex Bell on Tuesday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's thinking about investing, gonna come check out our digs.<eos> It's crazy weird, right?<eos> Have Alex Bell at your conference table?<eos> Come on, Izzy.<eos> You need to jump on this train.<eos> That's, um... That's... that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
God always liked you best.<eos> No, God loves everyone equally.<eos> That's wonderful news.<eos> Enough of your tomfoolery, Todd.<eos> Let's sing.<eos> BOTH: ♪ Michael, row your boat ashore ♪<eos> ♪ Hallelujah ♪<eos> ♪ Michael, row your boat ashore ♪<eos> ♪ Hallelu... ♪<eos> Say, Sockie, who was that lady I saw you with last night?
You.<eos> This show was your fault.<eos> Well, you'd better know this, mister.<eos> This town has my back.<eos> And... hey.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> How did 15,000 people leave so fast?<eos> Um... hey! Want to see me do a cartwheel?<eos> Always had trouble with those.<eos> Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Oh!<eos> Shit! Damn!<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> We got to dip now.<eos> Hey, man, you should really practice better business habits.<eos> - Shit out the door.<eos> - Really man? Oh, my God.<eos> You all right?<eos> That boy's gonna be a star.<eos> He talked to you like, don't... "I don't take checks."
Where?<eos> At the Marquis', near the museum.<eos> You're a smart girl,<eos> I knew you'd have the right info.<eos> Got on the perfume I bought you?<eos> Yes, sure.<eos> Not true, come here.<eos> You stink.<eos> Know why?<eos> You use "Eau de Bitch", like you.
Go on a diet.<eos> Come here, Patrizia.<eos> Uncle!<eos> - The witch suspects everyone.<eos> -Get a grip on your nerves.<eos> In here.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> - What's my part?<eos> -The messenger.<eos> - He talks just to you.
- Hello?<eos> - Baby, I'm sorry you and Mary have to be dragged through this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You'll prove you didn't do it, and then you'll come home.<eos> We can't talk long. It's not safe.<eos> I just wanted to hear your voice.<eos> Of course it has to be lasagna night.<eos> My favorite. Then why don't you stop by?<eos> I'll be serving it up, just like always.<eos> I could always count on you to keep your routine.
He's still stuck on Timmons.<eos> I'm starting to believe him.<eos> I mean, have you ever met a cop who happily worked overtime for no pay?<eos> Timmons isn't the story.<eos> Stay on Swagger.<eos> He trusts you.<eos> What did you tell her, Kyle?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I didn't say nothing.<eos> Why did she want to talk to you?
We're not moving.<eos> Your man must move or he will die.<eos> You've been compromised.<eos> Abort the mission now, over.<eos> Bob Lee, I know you hear me, goddamn it.<eos> Abort, over.<eos> Bob Lee...<eos> There are 12 marines in that convoy.<eos> Disregard the radio and get ready for a gunfight.<eos> I'll join you when I can.
Just do me a favor. Don't discuss this conversation with anyone.<eos> Early this morning, the FBI confirmed that DNA found inside a burned-out sniper hide does indeed belong to former marine turned failed assassin Bob Lee Swagger.<eos> Yeah, we've been hearing Swagger was mentally disturbed, but blowing yourself up...<eos> Mary, let's turn this of Certainly con...<eos> Honey, listen to me.<eos> Don't you pay any attention to what those people on TV say about your dad.<eos> A lot of it is just lies.<eos> I know.<eos> Daddy's not really dead.<eos> Hey, Mary, why don't you go to our room and I'll meet you there in a second, okay?
It would be if several witnesses didn't see Swagger in the middle of the melee.<eos> Any proof?<eos> All right, look, I know you're talking to him.<eos> You need to tell him to be more careful.<eos> Isaac.<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> You really think we should be seen together?<eos> It's important.<eos> Why can't we talk here?<eos> Look, I owe you.
Okay.<eos> Is he unconscious?<eos> Looks like he's getting there.<eos> Damn, that thing is ugly.<eos> Imagine if it made it downtown.<eos> Would have turned South Beach into the South Pole.<eos> Yeah, I've had enough cold for a while.<eos> So, Logan and I are gonna take the other SUV.<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> Wish I could put Logan in there with you.
Just hold on a second, Allison.<eos> Okay, now what?<eos> I don't know, they don't have an on/off switch.<eos> We are gonna lose this lizard unless we...<eos> What the?<eos> Is that Mitch?<eos> Put him on the phone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You put him on the phone now.<eos> Someone wants to talk to you.
Finally, it got so bad that a few of her neighbors decided to take her to a safe zone in Massingir...<eos> They thought the doctors there might be able to help.<eos> Well, they sure as hell didn't help, did they?<eos> I know how hard this must be, but we are one animal away from the cure.<eos> - We need to stay focused.<eos> - She's out there, I have to find her.<eos> No, Jackson, it is too dangerous!<eos> She's my mother.<eos> And what if you do find her? What then, rafiki?<eos> Then I will go with you.
Reece!<eos> Another man down on the way to the cure.<eos> We have the final piece to the puzzle.<eos> Now let's go finish this.<eos> Did you prep that sloth sample?<eos> Right here.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nice to see you doing good work in the lab again, Dad.<eos> It's a relief to be able to do my work in the open, finally.<eos> With you.
No, let me finish.<eos> I never got a chance to say this to your mother, and she deserved to hear it, so let me at least say it to you.<eos> I thought that I knew best.<eos> I always thought that I knew best.<eos> Truth be told, lying here in this chair, dying, fluids draining from my body, amidst an animal apocalypse that I may be partially responsible for, I... I still think that I know best.<eos> But that's my arrogance.<eos> The same arrogance that assured me that I could save all of us, that you and your mom would finally understand and come back to me.<eos> But instead, I almost lost both of you.<eos> Jackson, I thank God I finally had the chance to make it right.<eos> If not with your mother, than at least with you.
I'm just saying. Stop worrying about disappointing Mom.<eos> Make your own future.<eos> You sure you can trust that book?<eos> Hold up!<eos> I need to see some ID.<eos> Rufus.<eos> Hey, Anthony.<eos> Is it or is it not<eos> Taco Tuesday, and your turn to pick up said tacos?<eos> Um, ask Jiya to go with you.
I'm not gonna hit you!<eos> What do you-- you think I'm some kind of animal?<eos> !<eos> I'm just gonna go nuts?<eos> !<eos> Listen,<eos> Ryan gosling may not do this crap, and neither will I.<eos> I quit...<eos> I quit.<eos> Great working with you, man.

- How long, chase?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're so brave.<eos> You know that?<eos> Just don't leave from your hiding place.<eos> Don't leave from under your bed no matter what, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will come for you.
Hey, Raim.<eos> Raim?<eos> WQ2YV.<eos> WQ2YV, come in!<eos> Dad, are you there?<eos> I'm a cop?<eos> If I'm a cop, what does that make you, huh?<eos> - Are you really that dumb?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Okay, okay, look, if I was a cop, if I was, you think it's gonna end like this with you just shooting me right here?
Please leave your message after the tone.<eos> Mom?<eos> Why is your voicemail all messed up?<eos> You have to call me right now.<eos> I'm coming over.<eos> Detective Sullivan.<eos> Did he say what it's about?<eos> No, fine, I...<eos> Just give me 20 minutes.<eos> All right, I'll talk to you later.
Detective Sullivan.<eos> Did he say what it's about?<eos> No, fine, I...<eos> Just give me 20 minutes.<eos> All right, I'll talk to you later.<eos> Okay, look, uh... there's no easy way to say this.<eos> We've ID'd the remains from the marsh.<eos> Susie Cairone.<eos> The nurse missing from '96, we talked about this.<eos> No, I needed to talk to you in person about this.
How could it happen on such a beautiful day?<eos> - You think we'll see tomorrow?<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> Maybe it won't even happen.<eos> And you know what? If it does, we'll hide.<eos> A lot of people survived.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> Not even for a mondo board with spitfires.<eos> You know, my mom, she says my dad wasn't there for her when she needed him most.<eos> I won't do that to you.
- You're still crying?<eos> Of course I'm still crying.<eos> April, come on, okay?<eos> I'm gonna bring her by every single day at the hospital.<eos> We already talked about it.<eos> As soon as you get home, we'll fly your mom back out, get her to stay out here for a couple months.<eos> My mom already came for as long as she could, okay?<eos> I can't ask her to come back out. She's -<eos> - She's got work.<eos> Well, get a baby nurse who can stay and live with you, then.
She relapsed. Great.<eos> So it's just us, then.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Who's Mrs... Peterkin?<eos> There is no Mrs. Peterkin. -You just --<eos> -Maggie is going to ask you out.<eos> On a date.<eos> Maggie wants me?<eos> She wants to date you.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're, uh...<eos> I, uh, didn't know you'd be here.<eos> How are you?<eos> I don't know how to answer that.<eos> I'm leaving, so you can go in.<eos> Jo...<eos> I don't want to go in there.<eos> I want to be home with you.
It's okay, it's okay.<eos> It's all right. Kara, your pelvis is fractured, and there may be some bleeding.<eos> We need to do a C.T. scan to check for bleeding and other injures, all right?<eos> C.T.?<eos> Is that safe for him? It's a minimal risk for the baby, but we need to know how badly you're bleeding, okay?<eos> Yeah, um, just... just page me when she's in C.T.<eos> The clinic is supplied for crap.<eos> You didn't pick up my calls or answer my texts.<eos> Arizona...<eos> I was worried about you.
I wanted to walk out the damn door and never look back.<eos> So now you're gonna complain?<eos> That's the point.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm gonna do my time, work in the clinic, and help people.<eos> I want to come back, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes, and I'm not quitting.<eos> And that's the guy you... trained and raised and whatever, so...<eos> Okay?<eos> I missed you today.<eos> But I'm still really, really mad at you.
- You had that.<eos> I know that about you.<eos> Nobody knows that about you, but you told me, trusted me with the information. You let me know you. I know that about you.<eos> I know we are about to go treat a dural carotid cavernous fistula.<eos> Owen could've had it, too. I have no idea.<eos> Unlikely for a number of reasons.<eos> But I know it about you, just like I know that you do not like dogs.<eos> You don't ever go to church. You do like mushrooms.<eos> And I knew all of those things before today.<eos> I should've married you.
Like, you did your destiny or whatever, and now that you did it, maybe you're gonna go.<eos> And it's bad, Ken.<eos> Well, you do, uh, whatever you want, you know, because I kidnapped you and... and it... it must have been really bad for you.<eos> You know, I didn't think about your feelings and all that, and...<eos> I don't want you to go, I...<eos> I think.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Security will meet you on the ground in Belize.
- You look good. - No more guns!<eos> - We'll go with you.<eos> - Okay, enough.<eos> Enough!<eos> I'm done. I check out.<eos> I check out of this!<eos> Hey, listen, wait, hold on a moment.<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you... mad at me?<eos> Am I "mad at you"?
I don't know anything. Ever.<eos> It's really quite relaxing.<eos> But this is what I do, this is how I work.<eos> I follow fate around.<eos> It's how we found you.<eos> I can't promise anything, but just... give it a chance?<eos> Well, what do you want to do?<eos> I would start by opening that envelope.<eos> "You."<eos> This doesn't look anything like you.
Yeah, we're actually gonna do this.<eos> You're goddamn right.<eos> He was acting awfully funny.<eos> Something's wrong, something's very wrong.<eos> We're gonna go there right now.<eos> But is it the right thing to do?<eos> For Lydia.<eos> If she's even still alive.<eos> What kinda thing is that to say?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Take that!<eos> I got him!<eos> Amanda, thank God.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Amanda...<eos> No.<eos> You brought me here to keep me safe?<eos> Here?<eos> Into this.<eos> With you.
_ Oh, my God.<eos> "Petty, vindictive tyrant?<eos> I hereby resign from this hellhole." - No... - She made me clean out your desk.<eos> Your stuff is in my hatchback.<eos> No, but I didn't write this!<eos> I wrote it for you.<eos> You did what?<eos> You needed a nudge.<eos> Life's too short to waste in a place like that, Evie.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Chat for a sec?<eos> I'm in the middle of a game here, Ronnie.<eos> I see that, bruh.<eos> I been letting you slide too long, dawg, without paying your taxes.<eos> Where our money at?<eos> You puttin' up these fancy-ass buildings up in the hood, that niggas can't even afford, without paying taxes.<eos> - That shit goes through me, dog.<eos> - Step off, Ronnie.<eos> Okay.<eos> I tried coming at you with some legit shit.
Where do we start?<eos> - Get me a beer.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Hey! How you doing, baby girl?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - What y'all watching?<eos> - Cartoons.<eos> - Can I watch with you? - Yeah!
Come on.<eos> I need a doctor.<eos> - Phil.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> - I'm not gonna say anything.<eos> - I know.<eos> Daewon did this.<eos> I'll tell them it was Daewon and that he got away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll go with you.

- Mm, he's ruined.<eos> He's not acting like himself at all.<eos> Sad part is, we all know exactly what he's going through.<eos> Oh, someone's good at room service.<eos> You have some options for lunch.<eos> They've been running that press conference all morning.<eos> - Should I turn it off?<eos> - No.<eos> We have survived this kind of rampage before and we will survive it again, by keeping our loved ones close, home, where they belong, with their families, safe and sound.<eos> He was talking to you, wasn't he?
- It's quiet.<eos> - Same here.<eos> It's been a while, though.<eos> Maybe he's not coming.<eos> No, no.<eos> That is exactly what he wants us to think.<eos> He wants us to let our guard down.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> Me either.<eos> I'm right there with you, no matter what.
No!<eos> Emma!<eos> Emma, you're not gonna win this!<eos> I've got Audrey!<eos> You can make her death easy or hard!<eos> You know, she's probably already gone!<eos> You already lost, Emma.<eos> Don't give him what he wants!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Don't think I won't end you right now!
I need a bath and a bed. Good night.<eos> Oh, hey, oh, no!<eos> You can't go, because we're having fun!<eos> - Fun with Baird. - Non-stop fun.<eos> - Non-stop fun.<eos> - A couple beers. - What?<eos> - What's anything?<eos> - I...<eos> - What?<eos> We're just really worried about you.
♪ Oh, Daddy says "please," Mommy says "no" ♪<eos> ♪ Daddy says "come on," Mommy says "whoa" ♪<eos> ♪ Daddy goes... (grunts), Mommy goes "ow" ♪<eos> ♪ Daddy says "I'm done," Mommy goes "wow" ♪<eos> ♪ Daddy rolls over and falls asleep ♪<eos> ♪ Mommy drinks wine in the dark. ♪<eos> My God, did you hear 'em, Stewie?<eos> We're a hit.<eos> We got to go out and celebrate.<eos> Oh, he can't go out with you tonight.
Could-could we just cut Brian's mic?<eos> His humming sounds like my table's ready at Chili's.<eos> Stewie, what the hell is your problem?<eos> I'll tell you what my problem is:<eos> I'm doing all the work and you're just riding my coattails.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm just as big a part of this group as you are.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You're writing about all your authentic baby experiences?<eos> You asked me to do this with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> You know I'm trying to put that behind me.<eos> Clearly, the Count didn't get the memo.<eos> Maybe that's the problem.<eos> You hired him.<eos> You fire him.<eos> Well, that's exactly what I'm going to do.<eos> The invitation says to meet him at the dirigible in an hour.<eos> Well, we're coming with you.
Is that what you really want?<eos> I may never be able to make you human.<eos> I don't want to wear a dead woman's face any more.<eos> I don't want this body. I can't eat, can't dream, can't bear a child, can't die.<eos> You want to die?<eos> When the time comes.<eos> Or I'll never know how human I really am.<eos> Not when I'm still inside a machine.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Why do you think your family are worried about you?
Riley just joined our, um, I.T. Department a week ago.<eos> Cutie.<eos> You do any acting?<eos> I'd love to put you in my movie.<eos> Baller, you better get to work.<eos> Those fries won't cook themselves.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> This is gonna be fun.<eos> All right, I'll catch you all think tank geeks later.<eos> And you, Jack.
We don't take what isn't ours.<eos> I'm trying to help you, God dammit.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You're not one of those anti-vaxxers, are you?<eos> Catch him!<eos> He's got my medicine!<eos> After him!<eos> Everybody after him!<eos> I don't blame you, son.<eos> But Murphy cares about you.
Maybe we should all talk this over with Shepherd.<eos> Move.<eos> I'm afraid we can't do that.<eos> Roman! Stop it!<eos> Roman!<eos> I won't lose her again.<eos> Your sister can take care of herself.<eos> Go clean yourself up.<eos> That is not what I'm saying.<eos> I don't have time to argue with you right now, okay?
The road ahead's clear. I'll be following just behind.<eos> We'll take it as far as we can. Go.<eos> I'll catch up.<eos> You're not following him?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. I'm just looking you over.<eos> Well, he looks like his picture.<eos> So how do you feel about older men?<eos> I asked myself that this morning. -Agent MacLaren came to see me. -What?<eos> He's a lot like you.
And then she'll order an MRI, because it's likely to get worse.<eos> -Why didn't you just say that?<eos> -Because... There... there's just so much more to this.<eos> Then give me a hint.<eos> Give me something.<eos> I mean, technically, I... I'm still your social worker.<eos> -I can make you go to the hospital. -Okay, what's the date today?<eos> The 13th?<eos> There will be a small commuter plane crash in Oregon around noon, with, uh, four casualties.<eos> If that doesn't happen, I will go to the hospital with you, okay?

I mean, nobody can predict that.<eos> Well, then you'll get what you want, and I will go to the doctor with you.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's see what you got in the tank!<eos> Man, you're flying!<eos> You'll be back on the team in no time.<eos> Trevor? Can I talk to you?<eos> Ms. Day? How can I help you?<eos> Actually, I would like to help you.<eos> I've been looking over your transcripts and there are some things we need to talk about. What is it?<eos> Well, it's kind of a bigger conversation that I'd like to have with you and your parents.
I'm afraid this is part of the deal for saving your life.<eos> Not to mention, I told you a whole lot of things no one can ever know.<eos> Okay, but so what happens next?<eos> You knock me out and you drag me back out through the woods?<eos> You've been favoring your side like it hurts.<eos> Stitches.<eos> I had some surgery the other day.<eos> Organ donor.<eos> Well, ow!<eos> Why don't I just walk back out with you?
By any reasonable definition, she will be Marcy.<eos> Just not... this one.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> Would it have made a difference?<eos> No.<eos> Was it ever a threat to the mission?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Privacy might not exist where we come from, but it does in the 21st, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> And really, what kind of an asshole would I be if I started yelling at you now?
- Sorry.<eos> Thirty seconds.<eos> Spew it out.<eos> Snapper Carr, he's refusing to acknowledge my hiring.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> And what would you like me to do about it?<eos> Tell him to listen to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I hearing things?<eos> You want me to instruct your new boss to be nice to you because you don't know how to stand up for yourself?
What about us taking care of each other?<eos> My whole childhood was spent making sure that nobody found out.<eos> I gave up a medical career to join the DEO for you.<eos> And my... my whole life has been about protecting you.<eos> I thought you said it was a great adventure.<eos> Yes.<eos> But it's cost me a lot.<eos> It cost me my father.<eos> - Alex, we're going to find him. - Yeah?<eos> Well, how are we going to do that with you in Metropolis?
Don't say anything remotely suggestive.<eos> It could get very painful over here.<eos> Look who showed up to work.<eos> Thought you were driving to Olympia?<eos> I was delayed. Where were you this morning?<eos> Oh, Kathryn, uh, she needed me to pick up an antique chair for a client because it wouldn't fit in her car.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> You know, the funny thing about court dates is, when you miss one, you don't get another one next week.<eos> You get it next month or next year.<eos> That was this morning. It's cool, I covered for you again, but you're the lead on this one, Mac.
Philip. No. No, no!<eos> Philip! Carly! Make sure he stays awake!<eos> Philip, you stay awake, okay?<eos> My name is Marcy Warton.<eos> I work at a library.<eos> Hello?<eos> Marcy! Yes. Oh, thank God.<eos> No. No, I get it. Yeah.<eos> Mum's the word.<eos> Yeah, no, of course, you're... you're busy. Okay. Well, when you do, I'll be here.
Mm, I like your hair.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's this?<eos> What do you think?<eos> She's waving us down.<eos> She must need our help.<eos> What's in it for us?<eos> I hope that's a joke, Matt.<eos> Hold on. I'm coming with you.
You get your hopes up, I knock them down.<eos> That's called teamwork.<eos> That's a kick.<eos> That's an actual kick.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I felt a kick.<eos> There's a baby in there.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.<eos> Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant.<eos> I just... never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.
I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.<eos> How old was it?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> I don't remember much after I drank it.<eos> Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?<eos> Yes.<eos> Drink is fun and good friends- - Applebee's.<eos> She's learning English from TV.<eos> TV, good.<eos> Now back to you.
We've never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.<eos> So, I'm like a lab rat before your real friends come over?<eos> You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry.<eos> Help me out here.<eos> This is not where I shine.<eos> Stuart, you know you're one of our favorite people.<eos> Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false.<eos> I'm glad we did this test run.<eos> These brunches are wild!<eos> But how did you get her to go out with you?
Disappointing. The prototype merely phase-shifted The Seeker away.<eos> I'll have to increase its power. After I get rid of you.<eos> BLACK WIDOW: Hulk, can you smash?<eos> (STRUGGLING) Can't smash the net, but I can smash the wall.<eos> Huh. You're only delaying the inevitable.<eos> Ultron's got some new toys.<eos> And lucky us, we get to break 'em.<eos> Bad dog.<eos> Lockjaw!<eos> Ultron, when I'm done with you, you're gonna need a mechanic.
- You do, and it's to Salvation. We're all going there.<eos> Last I checked, you're on a contract with Oceanic.<eos> We give you fuel and supplies for your services.<eos> Yeah, but it's limited to deep-sea recovery and salvage.<eos> Well, it would be a salvage of sorts.<eos> Salvation has agreed to supply us with some iridium casings for our electrical contacts, so I need to check the stability of the iridium.<eos> So we all gotta go?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need to powwow with D'Amato.<eos> They want to talk to you and your passenger.
- All systems go on your command.<eos> Has Vestron been separated from the HAARP facility?<eos> Is everything with the rocket shielded?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We're running a line in for ignition to trigger the HAARP.<eos> I told you to isolate that facility.<eos> I know, and I was the first one to agree with that plan, but after inspecting the HAARP transmitter, it's too risky to have someone over there setting it off.<eos> It has to be done this way.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I'll leave it to you.
Not my friend.<eos> His associates, the ones we arrested, identified you as the ringleader of their outfit.<eos> Trust me, I am no leader.<eos> I can barely keep a guy.<eos> Look, Darlene.<eos> I don't really care what happened in D.C.<eos> In fact, I thought it was kind of funny.<eos> I've never seen Congress move as fast as they did on that day.<eos> But there are serious holes in your story.<eos> And I want to work with you to figure out why.
Let me do it alone.<eos> I know her.<eos> I am her.<eos> And if we're doing this, we're doing this now.<eos> We have 6,332 agents working on just this case alone.<eos> It's the hardest case I've ever worked on and probably the hardest one I ever will.<eos> Swear to God, the only reason why I think I've gotten this far...<eos> Is because I have no life.<eos> It's the only thing I've been able to think about.<eos> Now I'm sitting here with you...
No commander ever wants to go on the battlefield for a fair fight.<eos> Why would you ever want a fair fight?<eos> You want an unfair fight with all of the advantages on your side.<eos> Instead, he devises a plan forcing the Celtic warriors into a narrow defile where he can take them out one by one.<eos> For Boudica to stand any chance of survival, she must get her troops through the defile as quickly as possible so that they can then spread out and use their tactics, that have worked so well.<eos> But speed is of the essence if she has any hope of winning this battle.<eos> - Your men are ready? Ready.<eos> What would Father say?<eos> He would say to you what he says to me.<eos> I am with you, my love.
Sweetie?<eos> Come on, let's go another way.<eos> Eddie.<eos> Don't!<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Your daddy kiss it for you?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> What, Eddie?<eos> You want something?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
So thoughtful.<eos> -Yeah, go ahead.<eos> Try it on.<eos> -[sighs] Okay. Let's see.<eos> Oh, wow. Perfect.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -So listen, there's a funeral coming up tomorrow at the church, and I was kind of wondering if you might wanna go with me.<eos> You know, like a date.<eos> Oh, Keith, I just couldn't.<eos> Well, you know, Miranda is giving the eulogy tomorrow, and I just, I... I don't know, if she ever knew I was on a date with you, it'd be like that whole thing I went through when I was pregnant with Emily, and...
-What are you doing here?<eos> I just came by to let you know that I decided to green light this whole "skipping ahead to phase five magic" idea.<eos> So... [clears throat] we're good to go.<eos> You can just come home with me, and I'll teach you some magic.<eos> Please.<eos> No, Uncle Jim, we're fine.<eos> All right, that's great.<eos> Patrick!<eos> Come...<eos> Can I talk to you over here?
This time, more brown.<eos> -What do you want?<eos> -Uh, I'm looking for Miranda.<eos> But I think she's out with that little, no-good, wannabe magician, Patrick.<eos> Well, she's not here.<eos> Ah, this.<eos> This attitude.<eos> This is what your mom was talking about last night when we were in bed together.<eos> I don't even want to know what that means.<eos> Emily, she's worried about you.
Actually, I'm putting together my portfolio to try to get into art school.<eos> Okay?<eos> -I can't screw this up.<eos> Well, now that I'm looking at your pictures, I don't really want you to paint my float.<eos> No offense. [chuckles]<eos> You're just not very good, so...<eos> See you later, alligator.<eos> Okay. Just... this is a really horrible door.<eos> [Emily] Just leave it.<eos> Well, are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
Yes.<eos> Um, have you seen my purse?<eos> What?<eos> Why are you changing the subject?<eos> [gasps] There it is.<eos> You're gonna be there, right?<eos> [echoing] You bet.<eos> [echoing] Why are you walking so weird today?<eos> [normal] Do you have foot warts again?<eos> Mom, I swear, if you walk around barefoot and I catch it, I'm gonna be so ticked off at you!
I don't think things are gonna work out between us.<eos> Why?<eos> What... what changed?<eos> I'm with Owen now.<eos> What?<eos> Listen... I like you, Patrick.<eos> But I have to be smart about my love life.<eos> No offense, but I can't date a nobody.<eos> It wouldn't be good for my career.<eos> Besides, when I agreed to go out with you I had no idea that Owen was even interested in me.
♪ I love you so much ♪<eos> ♪ You help me through hard times ♪<eos> ♪ You're there for good times ♪<eos> ♪ You make me want to rhyme ♪<eos> ♪ Because we have such a good time ♪<eos> -[whispers] Hey.<eos> -Oh! You scared the toots outta me.<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I'm just checking in.<eos> Uh, have any managers approached you yet?
You and Donnie are welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll go get him.<eos> Skinwalker Donnie.<eos> Really? Everyone is dealing with this in a different way, Matt.<eos> Some not as good as others.<eos> My phone's working again.<eos> It's just like in 1859.<eos> The signals ride electromagnetic currents in the atmosphere.<eos> What is wrong with you?
How are you, Andy?<eos> You look in a hurry. Are you in a hurry?<eos> Always.<eos> That's why you never get anywhere.<eos> Things take time.<eos> Patience, practice.<eos> I hear you're working with Bill Boerg.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> Andy, I've worried about you every minute since you've scuttled off into the dark three years ago.
Nothing is in psychiatry.<eos> You have to use your judgment.<eos> They'll think it was me.<eos> I signed the release-- They will say it was my fault.<eos> Dr. Crowley, this man is dangerous, and he's out there tonight.<eos> We need your help to find him.<eos> No one is interested in whether it's your fault... just yet.<eos> [chuckles] No, no.<eos> Oh, no, I'm not on duty, and I'm not sober.<eos> I will speak to you when I can properly represent myself.
Alec, if you're gonna argue that he didn't jump, you're gonna have to give me more than "it's a long way out of town."<eos> But how do I prove it didn't happen that way when all there is is a body under a bridge?<eos> I feel cheated.<eos> You'll meet someone.<eos> How come somebody who is supposed to be educated comes up with such a bland comment as that?<eos> -"You'll meet someone."<eos> -What am I supposed to do?<eos> You're facing a woman's biggest existential crisis and I'm trapped out here in the middle of nowhere with you, and you say that.<eos> "I feel cheated."<eos> [sighs] I want to be sympathetic, but that's not enough for you, is it? So, you know what? I'll be honest.
-That thing she said about her brother... It isn't true.<eos> My mother is a chronic liar.<eos> She lies when there's just no need to. She... [scoffs]<eos> She lies when she's so easily found out.<eos> When I got to about 12, I realized that about 50 percent of everything she said just wasn't true.<eos> -What a minefield. -Yeah.<eos> Thank you for coming, Nina.<eos> -[Alec] You okay?<eos> -[Nina] Yeah.<eos> [Nina sighs] I'm sorry, for snapping at you.
I am gonna get him.<eos> -[liquid splatters]<eos> I was hoping I'd find you here.<eos> I just wanted to know you were okay.<eos> I have been listening, you know, to what you've been saying.<eos> I wanna believe in all this Quaker Disney cuddle-each-other stuff.<eos> -Bobby, don't, please.<eos> -You know what, Lucy, it is right to be angry about the way things are.<eos> It is right to want justice.<eos> You're upset, I don't wanna debate this with you, okay?
That's what you might call a little too eager to please.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> A note telling Marquita we'll come back tomorrow.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Hey, she wanted to help us in there.<eos> Why did you have to go -and stamp all over her like that?<eos> -She didn't identify him, end of story.<eos> All that stuff about "18 percent of blokes like to look at my pert little arse". I mean, come on.<eos> All she wanted was to point her perfectly beckoning 36Ds at you.<eos> -So, what's the matter with you?
Are you okay, Marquita?<eos> I want to call a lawyer.<eos> Hi, Lucy.<eos> Sorry I didn't call you back yesterday.<eos> [Lucy] That's okay.<eos> There's something I need to tell you, but it can wait now, until you're back.<eos> [Bobby] What is it?<eos> Please, when you get back we'll talk face-to-face.<eos> [stammers] I just wanted you to know that, um, I haven't vanished.<eos> I wanted to be straight with you so...
Yeah, I do.<eos> Uh, maybe next Saturday?<eos> Super.<eos> So are you telling people?<eos> -I mean, about the baby?<eos> -Well, I told my sisters.<eos> They thought I was some kind of barren freak-o workaholic.<eos> Never gonna conceive so, yay, I'm a woman.<eos> They can't flaunt their milk breasts at me anymore.<eos> Look, I never set out to mess you around, Alec.

It's Bobby.<eos> He looks crazy.<eos> -He's heading after Crowley.<eos> -[Nina] Stop him. You have to stop him.<eos> Don't let Crowley see him or it's over.<eos> I'm coming now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't, okay? Don't do this.<eos> Stop it, stop it.<eos> What's the matter with you?
-Come on, Walti!<eos> -Come on, Linda!<eos> -You can't do this in public.<eos> -We've always been together.<eos> -Like Hanni Nanni. -So what?<eos> There will be someone new.<eos> Nina.<eos> Look, I have picked myself a woman who is older than I am. And this woman happens to be pregnant to another man.<eos> It's not exactly boy meets girl, but I really need you to hear this, Nina.<eos> I want to try with you.
Faster!<eos> Marge, it's nothing.<eos> She's just my new best friend.<eos> What the...<eos> Why... Why are you mad at those eggs?<eos> ! They didn't do anything!<eos> Homer Simpson!<eos> After all I've put up with for all these years, if I'm not your best friend, what is this marriage about? !<eos> Okay, okay, you're my best friend.<eos> She's just somebody I call when I'm mad at you.

They didn't do anything!<eos> Homer Simpson!<eos> After all I've put up with for all these years, if I'm not your best friend, what is this marriage about? !<eos> Okay, okay, you're my best friend.<eos> She's just somebody I call when I'm mad at you.<eos> I mean, I'm never mad at you.

I have no interest in...<eos> riding your bike.<eos> But I want you to know that your bike loves you as truly as a bike can.<eos> And, Marge, I love you as much as that bike.<eos> - You are the bike.<eos> - Wha...? !<eos> I'm-I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Apparently, you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I'm not wrong for getting mad at you either.
A booze guy, a don't-know-my-kids'- birthdays guy, a steal-the-blow-dryer- from-the-motel guy, but I am not a strip club guy.<eos> You do want to hang with me, don't you, buddy?<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can't pretend to be this guy's friend for one more second.<eos> I scored three goals today!<eos> I'm a jock.<eos> A jock!<eos> I didn't spit on my hand for the post-game handshake.<eos> Hey, pal, I don't like Kirk either, but look how much fun the kids' heads are having.<eos> Of course I want to hang with you, buddy.
Why doesn't anyone ever think of the lawyer?<eos> Aw, if I do a slip 'n' fall on the courthouse steps, would that help?<eos> It might.<eos> See you Thursday.<eos> And I'll see you Thursday night.<eos> Oh. And I'll see you early Friday morning.<eos> Oh, these slippery stairs.<eos> Homie!<eos> Marge, no!<eos> Marge, I know Smithers was good at talking to you.

Previously on "Falling Water"... I wanna see my baby.<eos> There is no baby, dear.<eos> Bill Boerg really wants to meet with you.
You know why the Service blackballed me?<eos> I heard rumors.<eos> Too many to mention... something about being addicted to just about every substance in the known world.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's because I scare them.<eos> Because I know how this whole game plays out.<eos> Because I was there, I know the history, and because I know the history, I know the future, because I have been behind the curtain.<eos> I have worked on the show.<eos> Ah-hah! There it is, you see?<eos> First, they ignore you, then they mock you.
I like it black.<eos> There's a ridiculous amount of money out there, four or five times what wholesale brings in, if we keep retail.<eos> It'll just take a little longer.<eos> Maybe another week.<eos> I can't shut down and wait a week.<eos> If you can't sell it, tell me.<eos> I can sell it, I just hate the idea of throwing a half-million dollars into the gutter, when, if you give me the time...<eos> You're not in the business.<eos> Please, just get me the fucking money.<eos> You don't want Wing pissed at you.

Wing's friend.<eos> Good to finally see you again.<eos> My husband has nothing but good things to say.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?
What happens to the game here?<eos> It goes with Bennie.<eos> I've got no cash to pay the couriers.<eos> They're running out of dope.<eos> We can help.<eos> We can supply you.<eos> I told you, I've got no cash.<eos> We'll front you.<eos> Take the money as it comes in.<eos> We'll cut you in.

Sounds like you're about to live happily ever after.<eos> I know.<eos> Sounds like it.<eos> Why can't you just be happy for yourself?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just the little things, really.<eos> Like Rand always orders dinner for me, he wants to change jobs.<eos> Now.<eos> It's confusing.<eos> It sounds like he cares about you.
A couple days ago.<eos> How'd she take it?<eos> She was hurt.<eos> Why do I have to go live with someone else?<eos> No, sweetie.<eos> They're not just someone else, they're family.<eos> You belong with them.<eos> But so are you, right?<eos> You're family.<eos> I want to live with you, Uncle Chin.
I may not get back on a board ever again, but I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I just got to do this part on my own.<eos> That's just it.<eos> You don't have to do this on your own.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And if you're truly my friend, you'll understand that.<eos> Okay.<eos> But make me one promise.<eos> - (phone rings) - Duke, what's up?<eos> Steve, we got someone on the line asking to be patched through to you.
You have no idea what's going on with your patient.<eos> Tell them it's called "Neige."<eos> Snow.<eos> You're a magician.<eos> The client will be very happy.<eos> And we don't have to return the retainer.<eos> All that worry for nothing.<eos> I have to get back to the city.<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> I'll pack and come with you.
Places need names.<eos> Our dreams together, the whole megillah, it needed a name.<eos> Topeka?<eos> A good place to dig for roots.<eos> I know you think you're in control of things, but you're not.<eos> You're a chess piece, a pawn, a knight if you're lucky.<eos> What does that make you?<eos> I'm the buffalo wings at halftime.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> I've been sent to talk to you.
Oh, I can do this all day.<eos> Wasn't quite through with that.<eos> Jasmine Garcia.<eos> Model marine, excellent service record.<eos> School life, civilian life, all exemplary.<eos> No red flags.<eos> Nothing to explain any of this.<eos> PTSD?<eos> She was in some pretty rough places.<eos> We both know how that can mess you up, no matter how tough or well put together you are.
Citizenship can be revoked if you join a subversive group.<eos> You broke your oath of allegiance.<eos> That's only true in the first five years of naturalization.<eos> He doesn't know that.<eos> How's your paw?<eos> Fine.<eos> And three, you cooperate.<eos> You get to stay here in the U.S.<eos> Course if you don't cooperate, we put you in general population... Mm. ...after we tell everyone you've been human-trafficking<eos> Even the gangs that hate each other will unite to get a crack at you.
Which is why when we get back to the office, you're reconciling everyone's billings for the last six weeks.<eos> Oh, Donna, that is the worst form of torture<eos> I can go through.<eos> No, Louis, the worst form of torture is what you'll do if you don't have something to occupy your mind.<eos> Oh, my God, you're right.<eos> I don't care what the cost or that I'm entirely naked underneath this mud.<eos> I'm getting us another hour.<eos> Louis, you are not moving another centimeter until Renaldo comes back in here and puts that privacy curtain back up.<eos> Oh, look who's here.<eos> I'm not supposed to get out till this afternoon, but leave it to you to--
Now Mike's been playing chicken with them, and if he doesn't drop it, they're not gonna let him out.<eos> Let me get this straight. You want me to perjure myself so you can put this monster on the street because your sidekick wants to fight The Man?<eos> Don't play that shit with me. You've been crossing lines for years, and you didn't lose a minute's sleep over it.<eos> You're damn right I didn't, because I was doing it to put guys like Gallo away, not let them wander around at night hoping some fat guy with a Polaroid is gonna keep him from murdering somebody else.<eos> And what if that person he was gonna be murdering was me?<eos> Because Mike is to me what I used to be to you.<eos> Then convince him to do the right thing like you tried to do once with me.<eos> Because, Harvey, you know what you're doing with Gallo is wrong.<eos> Hey. You're not gonna believe this, but I got Rachel on the phone for you. - What?<eos> - Yeah. She had my number from the other night, and she wants to talk to you.
Then convince him to do the right thing like you tried to do once with me.<eos> Because, Harvey, you know what you're doing with Gallo is wrong.<eos> Hey. You're not gonna believe this, but I got Rachel on the phone for you. - What?<eos> - Yeah. She had my number from the other night, and she wants to talk to you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And Mike, if you're staying in here for me, don't do it.<eos> Hey. God, I can't wait to see you.<eos> I can't wait to see you either.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I, um--I just wanted to talk to you about my death row client.
Hey, where you been all day?<eos> Been doing what I said I was gonna do.<eos> I'm getting you out.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Do I look like I'm kidding?<eos> So take that phone of yours, call Jill, and tell her you're coming home-- tonight.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You really did that for me?<eos> I did.<eos> What about you?
I'm not trying to go back.<eos> You're not going back, because even though you'll be acting as a lawyer, your title's gonna be "consultant."<eos> Look, Harvey, I appreciate the gesture, but... everyone left that firm because of me.<eos> I'm not gonna do that to you again.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - No, listen to me.<eos> You've done enough, you don't have to do this for me.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.<eos> I'm doing it for me.<eos> I miss working with you.
She said she couldn't handle it anymore.<eos> And what about your children?<eos> Do you still see them?<eos> I haven't seen my son in over ten years.<eos> And I hadn't seen Maya until you found her and told her I was innocent and you were going to prove it.<eos> That's her right there.<eos> Leonard, is there something that you would like to say to her?<eos> I lost 12 years for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> But I won't regret any of it if it ends up being the thing that got me clean and reunited with you.<eos> Because if I died with you believing your father did this...
And how do you feel about the speech he gave to the jury?<eos> He talked about getting a second chance with his family.<eos> What about my family?<eos> Our lives were ruined that night.<eos> My little girl never even got a first chance.<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Forrest... Did you actually see Leonard Bailey kill your daughter?<eos> Of course I didn't, but that doesn't mean...<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Donna, can I talk to you for a second?
You're still in this, and you were great up there.<eos> Wait a minute, her father.<eos> What about him?<eos> He called Maria a junkie witness.<eos> How would he even know that she was a drug user?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The same way I would know.<eos> Leonard and his public defender said so on the stand.<eos> No, but he used those exact words when he came at me trying to get me to drop this whole thing.<eos> - He came at you? - It's fine, I handled it.
- Louis, I'm sorry...<eos> I tried to sleep on it, and all I could do was picture a life without you and your beautiful unborn baby and it just made me crazy to think<eos> But Tara, you need to know that I am not gonna say yes today and change my mind tomorrow.<eos> And I don't know how to give you that reassurance without asking you something first.<eos> Oh, my God, Louis.<eos> Tara Messer. Will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis.<eos> Jessica.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you before you left for Chicago.
And I don't know how to give you that reassurance without asking you something first.<eos> Oh, my God, Louis.<eos> Tara Messer. Will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis.<eos> Jessica.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you before you left for Chicago.<eos> I'm glad, but I wouldn't have left without saying good-bye.<eos> I didn't just come here to say good-bye.<eos> I came to see what you think about me coming with you.
I wanted to talk to you before you left for Chicago.<eos> I'm glad, but I wouldn't have left without saying good-bye.<eos> I didn't just come here to say good-bye.<eos> I came to see what you think about me coming with you.<eos> I'm leaving the firm.<eos> Jessica, if you're walking away from everything for me...<eos> No, I'm not doing this just for you.<eos> I'm doing this for me.<eos> I don't want to be a corporate lawyer anymore.<eos> So, if you don't want me to come to Chicago with you,
As I told you before, my mom is very sick.<eos> I'm gonna help her move into assisted living.<eos> Well, I'm here for you.<eos> And your Wi-Fi is way better than my neighbor's, so I'm in.<eos> It's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.<eos> Walk and feed him twice a day. Give him his kidney medicine.<eos> Yup, got it... feed his kidneys.<eos> Eleanor?<eos> Yeah? This is gonna be a very stressful week for me.<eos> I need to know that I can count on you.
It's ok. It's ok.<eos> Mama's here.<eos> He still has a fever.<eos> Well, we can give him some more medicine in a couple hours.<eos> That cough, though.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> The first time he barked like that, I thought we were headed to the E.R.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> About what?<eos> Snapping at you.
Silver Surfer.<eos> You mean Norrin Radd.<eos> The Herald of Galactus.<eos> Yeah, my son really likes him, too.<eos> You want to ask me about my sister, don't you?<eos> Is that ok?<eos> Do you remember anything unusual about this morning?<eos> Even stuff you think isn't important might be helpful.<eos> Your mom said you were sick today, so you didn't go to school, but do you ever remember seeing anything weird on your way to school on any other day?<eos> Did anyone ever try to talk to you?
No, no, no.<eos> I'm... I'm glad that you did.<eos> It's a very tricky, complicated relationship that we have to have between us.<eos> Delicate.<eos> I didn't know what to think of you at first.<eos> You were a little scary.<eos> And now?<eos> Not so much.<eos> Don't try to make up to me.<eos> I'm still mad at you.
Come on, Tony.<eos> WHIPLASH: You are not leaving just yet.<eos> Whiplash?<eos> Oh, finally. Something fun to do.<eos> Save your strength. This punk's never been much of a threat.<eos> I'm a threat now.<eos> That hurts!<eos> Everyone to safety!<eos> How does it feel to be number two, Stark?<eos> It must tear you apart.
You read storybooks?<eos> (GULPS) I told you not to talk to me.<eos> Kang!<eos> (ALL GROANING) I got it!<eos> Into the portal.<eos> Now!<eos> Don't let them get away.<eos> Hit the portal.<eos> Get back here and fight me, Kang.<eos> I'm gonna finish you for good this time.
They didn't figure on the tech's owner coming to visit.<eos> He called himself Kang the Conqueror.<eos> If this Kang comes back, we'll know. Won't we?<eos> Of course we will.<eos> I'll fix my scanner and make a few adjustments, okay?<eos> That's not the only thing that needs a few adjustments.<eos> Yeah. Stark is slipping.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> Oh, hey, I thought you left.<eos> We're worried about you.
Where am I?<eos> You're in the back of my car.<eos> You were drugged.<eos> By Gallo.<eos> By me.<eos> What?<eos> Cahill got the warden and the prison doctor to put something in your food.<eos> They're the only ones who know what's going on.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> We needed to change your mind about taking this deal, and we couldn't do it as long as you're in there.
Yeah.<eos> So he's not going anywhere, and neither am I unless it's in a goddamn body bag!<eos> Mike, I'm gonna find another way.<eos> I'd appreciate that, Harvey, but what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime?<eos> Hey, you didn't even want me to try and get him out in the first place.<eos> And I sure as hell didn't ask you to put him in here in the first place.<eos> And all the advice you gave me to stay in a group did was get the only friend I have in here nearly put in the hospital.<eos> Look, there's only one other thing I can think of, but you'll have to play it just right or we're gonna make things worse.<eos> Well, you might as well say it, because from where I'm standing, they are gonna get worse whether you tell me or not.<eos> Louis, can I talk to you for a second? What, no brah? No scrotum?
- What are you talking about?<eos> When Kevin finds out I told his father-in-law to drop dead, he's never gonna trust Mike.<eos> If you're saying what I think you're saying, you're not taking this man as your client.<eos> Yes, I am, because if I don't, we might as well not even be doing this.<eos> - Then let's not do it.<eos> - Look where we are, Sean.<eos> We're in a car, sneaking Mike into prison.<eos> You pulled every string you have to make this happen.<eos> You're gonna pull out now?<eos> I am, 'cause I'm not gonna put myself in position to collude with you.
What?<eos> Hey, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> You know what doesn't make any sense?<eos> One minute Gallo is your enemy, and the next minute, he's handing you his cell phone like he's your best friend.<eos> I'm trying to help him get out of here, which is good for both of us.<eos> Is that what you were doing last night outside of prison?<eos> You were helping him get out?<eos> Is that what was going on?<eos> Kevin, come on.<eos> I was worried about you, cellmate.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> - You sure?<eos> 'Cause that was some dream you were having.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just going back to sleep.<eos> Harvey, good, there you are.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Sutter just called.<eos> Let me guess, the indictments came down?<eos> He wants you in his office an hour ago.
Okay, I have removed every possible trace of the Kellmans' existence and replaced it with yours.<eos> Now all I have to do is fill the refrigerator with prune juice, and then I've got to set up the...<eos> - Okay, get out.<eos> - What?<eos> What do you mean get out?<eos> I haven't set up the...<eos> She's pulling up.<eos> She's here, and I don't want her to see us together and get the wrong idea.<eos> - And exactly what idea is that?<eos> - Okay, don't you understand? No woman could compete with you, if she thought there was even a chance of you and I being together.
- What? Why?<eos> Because I am a professional secretary, Louis.<eos> I'm not here to help you play hide the Litt with some strumpet.<eos> - She so doesn't get me.<eos> - You know what, Louis?<eos> She has a point. - What are you talking about?<eos> A lot of manpower has been devoted to your pursuit of this virtual stranger. And by manpower, I mean my precious time.<eos> So I think it's time that you took care of this yourself.<eos> Goddamn it. Don't you think if I could have I would have?<eos> What I think is, if you can't figure out how to have a simple date with a woman who's already agreed to go out with you, then maybe you don't deserve to go out with her in the first place.
Hey, Mike.<eos> How's it going?<eos> What are you doing here, Gallo?<eos> You know, when I was on the outside, I wasn't the biggest, I wasn't the strongest, I wasn't even the smartest.<eos> But they let me run things.<eos> No. I have a feeling you're about to tell me.<eos> I had a knack for knowing when something didn't smell right.<eos> Something doesn't smell right with you.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You're gonna tell me Harvey didn't stop by this morning to see you.
Was it with your old buddy, Henry Reese, who just happens to play rec-league basketball with five SEC lawyers?<eos> I haven't seen Henry in six months, and I'm getting a little sick and tired of this interrogation.<eos> Well, I'm getting sick and tired of assholes like you not taking this thing seriously. What?<eos> I didn't say I wasn't taking it seriously.<eos> Yeah, I don't give a shit what you said.<eos> I give a shit that you start listening to what I'm goddamn telling you because when the SEC gets you on the stand, they're going to go through your life with a fine tooth comb, and if you got something to hide,<eos> they're gonna find it.<eos> - Good.<eos> Get the hell out of my sight and send the next asshole in.<eos> Louis, can I talk to you for a minute?
Well, I don't like to be presumptuous.<eos> I mean, you can have another man--I mean-- you can have another Louis in your life.<eos> Speaking of other men, Louis.<eos> I'm glad you called back.<eos> I had an amazing time the other night, but I wasn't sure you were okay with what I told you about me having a--<eos> Oh, please, Tara, it's 2016.<eos> If a man can't be okay with his woman seeing other men, then what was Susan B. Anthony even fighting for?<eos> Well in that case, Louis Litt, how'd you like to go out tonight? Tonight?<eos> Um, I'd love to.<eos> Then tell me where to be, and I'll meet you there at 7:00 p.m. sharp.
But right now, I'd rather you spend your time finding something to get Leonard Bailey out.<eos> I will.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Jeff, it's me.<eos> How would you like to have dinner with me tonight?<eos> I would love to, Jessica.<eos> Just name the place.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just haven't been in this place since I was here with you.
It's wonderful.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I have a quick piece of business, but I'll return.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> Do you know who they're laughing at?<eos> They're laughing at you.<eos> Do you really think he would choose you over her?<eos> But he... but he danced with me.<eos> He was making fun of you, dear.
Look.<eos> Lady Tremaine: Clorinda, where are you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Clorinda.<eos> She's run off with the footman!<eos> I-I don't know where she's gone, but... but maybe it won't matter.<eos> The Prince is looking for me.<eos> He liked me.<eos> You know, maybe if I married well, Clorinda could do whatever she wanted.<eos> The Prince isn't gonna marry you.
Putting love before life.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Move in with me.<eos> What?<eos> Move in with me.<eos> I know everything in life is uncertain, but sometimes you have to walk out the door and hope there's not a bus.<eos> I mean...<eos> I have a closet full of red jackets.<eos> I feel like I could make some space for some black leather.<eos> Well, when you put it like that, then I would love to move in with you.
Promise I won't forget.<eos> And, Sammy.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're the man.<eos> I do what I can.<eos> All right, guys, I'm headed out.<eos> I will radio back if I find anything, and, hey... behave yourselves.<eos> Go. Okay.<eos> Hey, I'll see you later.<eos> What's going on with you, little buddy?
Oasis to Sammy. Oasis to Sammy.<eos> Sammy, do you copy?<eos> Samuel, answer the radio.<eos> Michael, he could just be away from his radio, okay?<eos> What now?<eos> This is lasting too long to be an ice shift.<eos> Eddie.<eos> Eddie.<eos> I'm gonna go see if Sammy's okay.<eos> Eddie, I'm gonna come with you. All right, cool.
This is Oasis Station.<eos> We are in need of assistance.<eos> Sammy, this is Oasis.<eos> Do you read?<eos> With the short-range radio, our signal just doesn't reach that far.<eos> And we're too far away to reach town now, right?<eos> We had to try something.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd swear those things were working together.<eos> I think they are.<eos> Orcas work together to trap seals by separating them from the main sheet of ice, like that shark did to you.
It was too late.<eos> He went into DIC.<eos> - All right, thanks, Maggie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can have Dr. Halstead brief you.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Hey, Markey, can I lecture you for a minute, man?
Now I'm starting to feel like your partner here thinks that I had something to do with this.<eos> Did you?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, can I, talk to you real quick?<eos> Hey, you're...<eos> You're gonna look after him, right?<eos> You leaving anything out, Freddy?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm just saying.<eos> I mean, we can count on you, right?
I didn't do it.<eos> - Get him in, interview one.<eos> - I'll talk to Al.<eos> If it's not Al, I want my lawyer here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> OK, who is doing the interview?<eos> Me and Hank.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Do you have a problem?<eos> Not with you.
Thanks for your help.<eos> It's a team effort.<eos> Tariq never should have slipped through protective custody.<eos> That one's gonna haunt me.<eos> Looks like you need a new lead investigator.<eos> You know of a good one?<eos> Me.<eos> I was hoping for some good news.<eos> Welcome aboard, Antonio.<eos> Looking forward to working with you.
I've heard a lot of good things about you.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's just keep this short and sweet, even if we all have to fake it.<eos> Sweetheart, I've been meaning to call you Beca...<eos> Jay, would you mind?<eos> Could we just have one minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I don't know maybe... I could stay here.<eos> It looks interesting to me.<eos> What would you do here though?<eos> It's just a thought, i don't...<eos> -I mean, I've no plan.<eos> -I know, I like...<eos> Don't you want...<eos> Why you grilling me right now?<eos> I'm not trying to grill you, I just...<eos> I guess I'm a little worried about you?
You doing something about it?<eos> Yeah. Mainly pills. A lot of fucking pills.<eos> Doctor says I gotta get it replaced.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that, bro.<eos> Yeah, I know, man, but it's all good.<eos> Hey, listen, I didn't come over for a medical consultation, Rick. I came over to tell you that, um...<eos> I left ASM and I'm branching out on my own.<eos> Oh, congratulations, man.<eos> I'm with you all the way, baby.
No, I'm not blaming everyone else, I'm blaming you.<eos> If we would've done this shit my way from the beginning...<eos> Your way?<eos> You realize the fucking hole that you dug for us in the beginning of... answer your phone.<eos> I can't even move my hands right now.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Is this Travis Mack?<eos> - Yes, it is. This is Ozzie Newsome, Baltimore Ravens GM.<eos> Terrell Suggs had some very nice things to say about you.<eos> We're taking you at six, son.
Why, yours.<eos> So, you're dragging James into your vigilante quest.<eos> Is he your sidekick now?<eos> Quake and the Amazing Bomb Boy?<eos> How about you go wait in the van?<eos> We're supposed to be helping him.<eos> I am helping him.<eos> You've chosen to walk your brooding path.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't drag him down with you.
- I didn't ask.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Trying to distance yourself from everyone else so they don't drown in your wake?<eos> I invented that move.<eos> It doesn't work... for one simple reason.<eos> Phil Coulson.<eos> He found me in that cubicle and dragged me out.<eos> He didn't give up on me... and he won't give up on you.<eos> - I never wanted that. - Mnh-mnh, no.<eos> You don't get to choose who cares about you.
Help!<eos> Please, sir!<eos> Please help me!<eos> Next thing I know, he... pulled me to safety.<eos> Who was this guy?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Never saw him.<eos> Just some good Samaritan.<eos> He stopped, saved us, and moved on.<eos> I remember he went over to you.
Joe got what he deserved.<eos> My nephew's in a wheelchair because of those thugs he hired.<eos> Oh, don't act like you're innocent in all of this.<eos> It's that damn book.<eos> I tried to warn you about it.<eos> You wouldn't listen.<eos> Joe...<eos> I told you to stay out.<eos> You need help.<eos> Hey, look, we're worried about you.
I didn't know that was what he was up against.<eos> Who won't go?<eos> It's... It's gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Where did it go?<eos> He's gonna go straight for Uncle Eli.<eos> And he'd be doing the right thing.<eos> Mack, what are you doing?<eos> Sir, you got to stop. Director's orders... We're about to take off any minute.<eos> Hey, what's gotten into you?
Do we have it?<eos> Wait, guys, do we have it? !<eos> - We're good.<eos> - Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> _<eos> Becca.<eos> I just can't believe you didn't mention Ray Merchant to the FBI, that's all.<eos> I didn't think it was relevant.<eos> Elizabeth, someone is stalking our family.<eos> How could a former student who is obsessed with you not be relevant?
The FBI and Diplomatic Security.<eos> Do you ever think about that?<eos> No.<eos> Because, if I did, I'd have to quit.<eos> Look, I know that this Ray Merchant theory is compelling...<eos> Don't talk to me like I'm crazy.<eos> Then stop acting like it.<eos> The kids were terrified last night.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Yes, and you getting obsessed about it isn't helpful.
The country manor in the Cotswolds is basically just a farm with glowering portraits.<eos> The chateau in Provence is a little bit more fun, but I think my sister will have us over for visits so she can just lord it over me.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> I really have to go.<eos> - Jareth, stop.<eos> Is your father right?<eos> Is this a huge mistake?<eos> It's too late now.<eos> The Brexit vote is in, and there's no turning back.<eos> - So I'll talk to you later. Mwah! - Wh...
What the hell?<eos> Are these toy guns?<eos> "Kato-cha, LOL." Is this mine?<eos> You two first-timers had better get dressed now.<eos> Don't tell me what to do, Baldy!<eos> Morons like him always die first.<eos> What's that, punk?<eos> You're just a stupid gamer.<eos> You have an attitude, school kid.<eos> I'm talking to you, punk!
It's fun...<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Come on. Come on, can we go?<eos> We've been here long enough.<eos> No...<eos> Kate.<eos> Come on, Kate...<eos> Come on.<eos> How are you losing weight and I'm not?<eos> Can I be honest with you?
You don't need to worry.<eos> I won't harm Belle.<eos> You see, there's one final twist.<eos> I am not the monster you need to worry about.<eos> Mary?<eos> Henry!<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> Where's Hyde?<eos> Wh-What's going on?<eos> I sent him last night to talk to you.
We would share the byline.<eos> That's tempting, but ah... I got this.<eos> You know, I really am just trying to help.<eos> Mm-hm. Yup.<eos> Hey, Simon!<eos> Look, no offence.<eos> You're um... you're the dude around here.<eos> You've had tons of exclusives and I'm just out of entertainment.<eos> If you really want to help me, give me your contacts.<eos> The thing is, Daisy, I... don't think the Imam would talk to you.

Hold it.<eos> Hey Sharon...<eos> I-I know it's late but ah...<eos> Right, right, you're right.<eos> I just, I just wanted to talk to Noah for a minute...<eos> I know.<eos> It's-it's just for a minute.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yes, I know it's past his bedtime...<eos> Sharon, you know what, I'm not gonna argue with you.
What do you think?<eos> All right.<eos> I hope I can remember how to do this tomorrow.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Why do I have to go live with someone else?<eos> Oh, sweetie, they're not just someone else, they're family.<eos> You belong with them.<eos> So are you, right?<eos> You're family.<eos> I want to live with you, Uncle Chin.
One of the victims was your wife, wasn't it?<eos> Joanna Wallace.<eos> Revenge.<eos> This thing is all about revenge?<eos> You're gonna, you're gonna walk in there where certain death and potentially give up the Greystone, just so you can settle the score with El Hamadi?<eos> Sorry, Harry.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> We have a kill or capture order on El Hamadi.<eos> He's a high-value target to our government, too.<eos> Which is why we're coming with you.
Here, want some water?<eos> Come on.<eos> No?<eos> All right. Let's go home.<eos> Let's go!<eos> The blue or the gray?<eos> Yeah, going with the blue.<eos> Yeah, she's gotta have her veggies.<eos> A little...<eos> All right, Jaynie's coming by to walk you later, all right?
It says I shouldn't trust you.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Someone I grew up with.<eos> Did he say why you shouldn't trust me?<eos> No.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> Would I have told you if I did?<eos> What does he want?<eos> He wants me to meet with him.<eos> Well, I'll go with you.
Do you believe him?<eos> Would I have told you if I did?<eos> What does he want?<eos> He wants me to meet with him.<eos> Well, I'll go with you.<eos> And then together we can find out what he knows.<eos> He'll say more if I go alone.<eos> I want to be there.<eos> Tess...<eos> I care about you.
- Hi!<eos> Yeah. Such a tragedy.<eos> True love gone.<eos> What a shame.<eos> I'm just grateful that my sister survived.<eos> Imagine if the car had swerved the other way, it would have been Kat killed, not Julia.<eos> And Julia would have been the one with the busted knee.<eos> Um, 15 minutes till curtain.<eos> Let's maybe have our guests clear out.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
-Mississauga. Yeah.<eos> First of all, you can't let out a.. A 'hood "yeah!" It's..<eos> It's Mississauga, you fucking dummies.<eos> All right?<eos> It's not like..<eos> It's not even like, "Oh, shit!"<eos> It's like, "Yeah, Mississauga." It's..<eos> Mississauga, and he's a doctor.<eos> How gangster do you think his life was?<eos> I gotta be honest with you, Sandeep, it's nothing personal, but I would never go to you as a doctor.
It wasn't till I was 12, I was like, "Dad.." He was going to work, I go, "Dad, what exactly do you do?" He goes:<eos> "I check to see if the chickens are good or not."<eos> And then he left.<eos> And I still didn't know what that meant.<eos> I literally picture my dad standing around, going, "Good chicken.<eos> Good chicken.<eos> Stop the line.<eos> Bad chicken."<eos> I don't know what he did to the bad chicken.<eos> "I wanna talk to you for a minute. Come here.
Here in the props department, some sweaty guy is working on the Petercopter.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know, a lot of people don't realize SEAL Team Six actually completed their mission in this puppy.<eos> Oh, cool, Family Guy!<eos> Over here!<eos> I'm down here!<eos> Knock-knock?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hi, Stewie.<eos> Hey, I was just showing the viewers around Family Guy, and we thought we'd drop in and talk to you about the show.
Okay, one thought.<eos> What if we change "lox" to "boys"<eos> and "bagels" to "problems"?<eos> Oh, that's perfect.<eos> Like when you changed "pickle it good" to "shake it off."<eos> All right, we got our homework.<eos> Hi, Taylor.<eos> Chris?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
♪ I've met the guy that I've been dreaming of ♪<eos> ♪ Me Taylor... ♪<eos> Wow, they hate it.<eos> This stinks!<eos> We like you when you're miserable!<eos> You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a door-open dook in the bathroom!<eos> Why were they being so mean to you?<eos> Well, I guess they're just used to me being sad and hurt by men.<eos> But I don't care if they like it, Chris.<eos> I'm happy with you.

You got to get your a-game on, brother.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> You... we lost radio contact.<eos> Get them back online.<eos> You know exactly what it means.<eos> I'm not thinking about her.<eos> Ah, no, I beg to differ, my man.<eos> For the last two weeks, nikki's been in your head.<eos> Ever since she escaped fbi custody, you've been off.<eos> And I got to be honest with you, if I'm gonna do my job, I need my partner back.
Sir, with all due respect, I felt there were other people far more qualified than I was.<eos> Rosemary Jones, for example, has three years experience on Senator Ford's staff...<eos> Carter had a pretty good résumé, too, and look how that turned out.<eos> Aaron's motivations were political, but mine were simple.<eos> I was just looking for the right person for the job.<eos> Today's crisis was racially motivated.<eos> Tomorrow's could be gun control, a women's issue.<eos> I just wanted to have someone on the podium that I respected.<eos> Come on, Seth.<eos> Don't make me beg. Can I count on you?
Some sort of biological defense mechanism.<eos> So, yeah, that's new and terrifying.<eos> Any ideas where we can find him?<eos> Ah, as it so happens, exactly one Brevakk registered in National City for the President's Alien Amnesty Act.<eos> I got an address.<eos> Shall I get a strike team to gear up?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Sawyer?<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?
Tonight, that changes.<eos> Our gladiators will fight for the privilege of being the last Green Martian.<eos> Tonight, they fight to the death.<eos> I don't fight to the death.<eos> Tonight you do.<eos> Fight!<eos> Why won't you show yourself?<eos> My true form is mine to reveal.<eos> You will not take that from me.<eos> And I will not fight you.
Right, Mike.<eos> Welcome to Catco.<eos> - You're... You're the big boss?<eos> - That I am.<eos> I kind of expected someone a little more intimidating.<eos> I had Miss Teschmacher put some reports on your desk that should be put in order and filed.<eos> So, if you have any questions, my doors are always open. Oh, thanks.<eos> And hey, sorry I ran out of bribery coffees.<eos> That's okay, I'm actually about to go get one myself.<eos> So... - Can I go with you?
- Well, Mike of the interns, find yourself a nice suit, and I'll see you there.<eos> Bye.<eos> We are going to a party!<eos> Yes!<eos> Okay, because the photon cannon is powered by electromagnetism, it left a radiation signature on Supergirl's suit after the blast, so we might be able to put a tracking algorithm...<eos> Hello?<eos> Earth to Agent Danvers.<eos> - Sorry, I'm listening.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> What's... What's going on with you?
- Kara, you just missed Supergirl.<eos> - Did I?<eos> Golly.<eos> James, you're not here to fight crime, are you?<eos> No, I'm just here as an upstanding member of the community.<eos> Yes, because we agreed that that would be suicide.<eos> What's your name, beautiful?<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Um, are you gonna yell at me again?<eos> I'm not gonna yell at you...
Golly.<eos> James, you're not here to fight crime, are you?<eos> No, I'm just here as an upstanding member of the community.<eos> Yes, because we agreed that that would be suicide.<eos> What's your name, beautiful?<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Um, are you gonna yell at me again?<eos> I'm not gonna yell at you...<eos> What's wrong with your mouth?<eos> I'm not gonna yell at you again.
What's wrong with your mouth?<eos> I'm not gonna yell at you again.<eos> - Where's the suit from?<eos> - Oh, you like it?<eos> - Yeah, it's nice.<eos> - Yeah, Eve gave me her little...<eos> Her plastic rectangle to buy things.<eos> You used her credit card?<eos> You're gonna yell at me again.<eos> I'm not gonna yell at you.
I got you something.<eos> It's a guide to National City.<eos> Thank you, Kara.<eos> - What's a "Strip club"?<eos> - You know, let's just take that page out.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> You okay?<eos> I've seen some crazy stuff since I joined the Science Force, but that was... That was...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was worried about you.
Odds and ends.<eos> At least, let me train you.<eos> You have all these powers and you're not learning how to control them.<eos> - I can control things.<eos> - That's dangerous.<eos> You have to know how to...<eos> This was not the prime example of that.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll make a trade with you.<eos> You drink this drink, and I will train with you.
You need a break?<eos> Okay, I accept your surrender.<eos> This is serious.<eos> You have to learn how to defend yourself.<eos> How often are you planning on attacking me?<eos> I'm training you. So that, one day, if you are so inclined, you can make a difference.<eos> - And what if that's not me?<eos> - Sure it is.<eos> Kara, hey...<eos> Can I talk to you?
The second he touched me, he got more powerful.<eos> The more he absorbs, the more dangerous he is.<eos> Kara, you all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Agent Schott, start looking into the other victims Dr. Jones' might be targeting.<eos> Supergirl, go home and rest.<eos> You'll need your strength for the next fight.<eos> - I want to help.<eos> - James, we got this.<eos> I should come with you.
Okay.<eos> I said, I was fine.<eos> You didn't need to check on me.<eos> I'm not checking on you.<eos> You've been weird ever since I told you.<eos> I don't mean to be.<eos> Kara, I know when you're sad.<eos> Or when you're disappointed.<eos> I don't know what I would do if you were disappointed in me.<eos> I would never be disappointed in you, but you said you didn't want to talk about it anymore.
Fighting rampaging creatures isn't on my resume.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> Kara told me.<eos> Uh, beating people up for money is though, right?<eos> Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you go believe in ‭somebody else, Alex?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't believe in you, Mon-El.<eos> I suspect you're a coward, and that you would run at the first sign of danger.<eos> My sister, she's the one who believes in you.<eos> That's why she's so upset with you all the time.
How are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good. Good, yeah.<eos> Everybody, this is Maggie.<eos> Maggie, this is, um, everybody.<eos> James, Winn and Kara.<eos> The sister!<eos> I've heard so much about you from Alex.<eos> And I've heard all about you.<eos> Um, can I borrow you a minute?
Everybody, this is Maggie.<eos> Maggie, this is, um, everybody.<eos> James, Winn and Kara.<eos> The sister!<eos> I've heard so much about you from Alex.<eos> And I've heard all about you.<eos> Um, can I borrow you a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, so, you haven't returned any of my calls.<eos> I've been worried about you.
You're targeting the wrong guy.<eos> Okay, I'm listening.<eos> That's it. If you want me to drop my prime murder suspect, you gotta give me more than that.<eos> I can't. It's classified.<eos> Come on, Alex.<eos> We're friends. No, Maggie, we're not friends.<eos> Okay, I'm lost.<eos> What happened?<eos> We hung out, we got close, then you called me out for liking you, and then I had the guts to admit, "Yes, it's true."<eos> And you told me that my feelings were real and that I deserved to be happy, and so I thought you meant I deserved to be happy with you.
I still wanna know who's under that mask though.<eos> I'm sure he'll reveal himself soon enough.<eos> Yes. Thank you.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> You didn't find our adjoining cells cozy?<eos> You were really brave, Mon-El.<eos> I told you I was scared.<eos> Well, you could still be scared while being brave.<eos> Maybe there's a hero in you after all.<eos> Well, any, any courage I do have, I learned it from you.
Are you all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> So, what is it?<eos> I've got the mainframe breaking down the virus on a molecular level.<eos> No, I mean, I know you've been trying to tell me something.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> How?<eos> Keeping a secret disagrees with you, sweetie.
They tried to save lives.<eos> I'm sure Lex and Lillian Luthor thought their intentions were good, too.<eos> Is this their legacy?<eos> Death and destruction across the universe?<eos> Your parents' legacy is not death and destruction, Kara Zor-El.<eos> It's you.<eos> J'onn!<eos> J'onn!<eos> What's...<eos> What is happening to you?
You understand what a "youthful indiscretion" is,<eos> - don't you? - I do.<eos> This was not.<eos> What was it then?<eos> Were you paid for your silence, Ms. Boyle?<eos> What if I told you there were more?<eos> Women?<eos> Ask me anything you want.<eos> You know me.<eos> You know, hunches. Right up to the point where I find my ass right here with you in Jersey.
I just know that you can't stay here.<eos> - We'll tell Raimy that I...<eos> - You gotta listen to me.<eos> I need you to see the bigger picture here.<eos> I think I am.<eos> Your life is in immediate danger right now.<eos> This Nightingale, he is gonna come,<eos> - and he is gonna take you.<eos> - You need to stop saying that.<eos> Frankie, what the hell happened to you?
Oh, good, you're here.<eos> What a day.<eos> Thanks for watching him.<eos> Yeah, thanks for asking.<eos> You know, I could've called Regina and turned him over.<eos> Yes, you could have, but you didn't.<eos> You know what, Sis?<eos> I know exactly what you need.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come with you?
A great battle is coming.<eos> But Agrabah is at peace.<eos> Agrabah is dying.<eos> I know you can't see it right now, but Jafar has torn our kingdom apart, so I found a Savior who will defeat him.<eos> Defeat the Royal Vizier?<eos> That sounds like treason.<eos> Don't listen to him, Father.<eos> Jafar is controlling you.<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> So, I can do what I want to you.
You didn't want us to find you.<eos> Well, I never intended to reveal myself.<eos> But after hearing you and the boy, I couldn't keep these to myself.<eos> But Jasmine... She's looking for you.<eos> You... You need to go to her.<eos> She was the first person to believe I could be more than just a selfish street rat.<eos> I can't see the look in her eyes when she realizes that's exactly what I am. I was...<eos> I am a street rat, too.<eos> I made plenty of mistakes.<eos> But I found people who kept me strong and cared about me as much as Jasmine clearly cares about you.
Just hear me out.<eos> Aladdin didn't trust the people he loved.<eos> That's why he failed.<eos> But I believe in us to find a third way.<eos> It's kind of what we do.<eos> But if we don't and my magic does come with a price,<eos> The Savior is what I am, but I am also part of a family.<eos> - Well, I choose to believe in us, too.<eos> - We all do. We can protect you, and we can protect this town.<eos> If that's what you want, I'm with you, Swan.
We said 0400, Patti.<eos> It still gives us, like, 15 seconds.<eos> - Drive!<eos> - You heard the man!<eos> _<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> We having a party?<eos> A really weird, awkward one?<eos> No.<eos> We're all here because we love you and we're worried about you.
Refuse service!<eos> Refuse service!<eos> Whoa! I don't think so, dude.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop it, seriously.<eos> Stop!<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> I like your style, my man, but we're just talking here.<eos> I will never talk to you, KGB pig!
And you've just bought yourself 100 years.<eos> Didn't know how to handle the turn of the century, huh?<eos> Viktor.<eos> We did it.<eos> We did it!<eos> Viktor... we need to get you a doctor.<eos> We need to get him a doctor right now.<eos> No... there is no time.<eos> Just listen, my old friend.<eos> I wasn't angry at you for leaving Russia.
Viktor?<eos> Yeah, I'm really sorry about Viktor, man.<eos> He was a good dude.<eos> I liked him.<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> About Nikki...<eos> I told you I stopped looking for her and I lied.<eos> - You know that. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.<eos> But I did that 'cause I didn't want you worrying about it.<eos> Worrying about you is my job, man.
Or maybe you listen to me and find him.<eos> Oh, sure, yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna go make a call.<eos> Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom.<eos> Everybody wants a memorial for her. They want to mourn her.<eos> Of course they do.<eos> And I am the freak who is saying no because... because we're going to get her back.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to your mother, okay?<eos> In fact, I'm, uh... I'm seeing her tomorrow.<eos> She still talking to you after all that crazy last night?
Answer me!<eos> No.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> - Get... out!<eos> You are gonna tell me how you picked her. How you took her.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you anything until you get me a lawyer.<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> Do you really think I'm gonna let you lawyer up?<eos> Do you have any idea of what I'm about to do to you?
I hang out here.<eos> I've never seen you here before.<eos> - It's my favorite bar.<eos> - Okay, I think you should leave.<eos> Whoa, buddy, just take a beat.<eos> - Raim, who is this guy?<eos> - It's okay, Gordo.<eos> I love this place, the puffy fries, the secret, off-the-menu flight they claim not to have the first two times you ask.<eos> You stay late on Sundays, people kill the Coltrane and play Loverboy, and where else can you get that, right?<eos> You know, my friend has had a rough couple of days, and can I be up front with you here?
Look, mate, be careful when you get up there, OK?<eos> She's right on the edge.<eos> Come on, mate, hurry up.<eos> Love?<eos> I... I wish I knew what to say.<eos> I... I want to help.<eos> Love?<eos> Sometimes things just creep up on you, don't they, like a fog?<eos> And you want to talk to someone, but the words just won't come out, will they?<eos> Look, I'm sure there are people who care about you, you know, people who love you.
Sic semper tyrannis!<eos> The South shall be free!<eos> Who was that on the phone?<eos> I have to go.<eos> Now?<eos> Where?<eos> Something came up at work.<eos> No, no, you can't just...<eos> Lucy.<eos> What the hell's gotten into you?
Thank you.<eos> Where the hell is Rufus with the supplies?<eos> You need a real doctor.<eos> To do what?<eos> Leech me?<eos> Get this off me.<eos> Ah, ah. This would take 15 minutes to patch back home. Here, I'm gonna die of sepsis.<eos> - You get it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Rufus, you're up.
Ha ha. The way you ran out yesterday, and now this.<eos> And I'm not supposed to worry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just been a little... hectic.<eos> I see.<eos> So did you help out your friend Amy?<eos> I'm still working on it.<eos> Well, please go freshen up and find your engagement ring.<eos> Mom.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
What are you doing here?<eos> It's okay.<eos> We're the Librarians... oh.<eos> How do I know you're not infected?<eos> Infected?<eos> How do I know you're not one of them?<eos> Because... we're the Librarians.<eos> From government census?<eos> To inventory the assembly records?<eos> Why does that always work for you?
The hallways are swarming with those monsters.<eos> What if you're more monster than man?<eos> What are you... absolutely not!<eos> Yeah, think about it, okay?<eos> I've been bitten.<eos> I'm turning into one of them.<eos> If I can get amongst those beasties and distract them somehow, then you lot can go and shut the power down.<eos> Ezekiel, you haven't even started changing yet, all right?<eos> You don't have the eyes. You don't have the fangs.<eos> They'll tear you to shreds.
You knew what was gonna happen.<eos> Anyway, now we're committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone's upset with me.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad at me, too.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.<eos> Why would that make me feel better?<eos> Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better?<eos> At least mine was educational.<eos> Okay. Never mind.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.
One bong or two?<eos> Max, this is a business trip.<eos> We're not going to Comic-Con with Woody Harrelson.<eos> Wait, is that on the table?<eos> Anyway, this is your trip for the dessert bar.<eos> So again, one bong or two?<eos> I am never gonna live down the "partner" thing, am I?<eos> Like when I threw away those bath salts to save your life.<eos> I wasn't gonna eat your face.<eos> I am not having this argument with you again.
Who's gonna be jealous of me now?<eos> Guys that can't grow facial hair?<eos> Look, you were great at school and last night you were great at having fun at school.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> I have last night, but I'll never get to have both.<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> You're the smart one.<eos> You deserve your moment of triumph, but you also deserve not to be Buzzkill Channing for the rest of your life.<eos> You really weren't mad about the interview?<eos> A little, but I'm always a little mad at you.
You'd think I'd be embarrassed because I came all this way here for you, but... I don't regret it.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> Can I get some mustard for this cake?<eos> Earl, if I didn't come, I'd always have wondered what could have been.<eos> I am glad you came.<eos> Showed me my heart can take a lot.<eos> Whoever had this one before me must have been a jogger.<eos> It was great seeing you, Earl.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go get my Goofy on.<eos> Uh, Pilar, can I catch a ride with you to the airport?
You look stressed.<eos> - I just have a lot on my mind.<eos> - Yeah. Well, I've already charmed half of Langley with a career's worth of cocktail-party chatter, and I'm still green as a solar farm.<eos> You better keep up, or you'll look bad.<eos> I'll try and remember that.<eos> Hey, Owen.<eos> Um... This hard for you, too?<eos> You know... Your prize recruits under the microscope.<eos> If we fail, you fail.<eos> You should worry less about me and more about you.
Productive.<eos> Did you find what you were looking for at Langley?<eos> Or I guess we don't talk about things like that.<eos> What do you think I was looking for?<eos> The same thing I was...<eos> The truth about why you were benched.<eos> You think you got burned on purpose.<eos> You want names.<eos> You talked to Matthew.<eos> He cares about you.
- Who dares defy me?<eos> I do.<eos> Appears we have a stowaway.<eos> Who are you, and how did you get aboard my ship?<eos> I am... no one.<eos> Just a man who's come to ask you one simple question.<eos> Aye, well... better make it a good one 'cause it's gonna be your last.<eos> Is getting revenge against the Dark One worth all the time you've spent chasing it?<eos> I'll let you know after I've skinned myself a crocodile, but first...<eos> I'll just have to settle for you. Man:
To what do we owe the honor?<eos> So, it's true.<eos> You really are harboring the Evil Queen out here.<eos> She's my sister, and she cares about me.<eos> I'm willing to bet you're not here to see how I'm getting on.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have a message.<eos> Your little masquerade as the Cricket therapist didn't work because airing Emma's dirty laundry only made us stronger.<eos> Well, then why are you out here delivering this message all by your lonesome?<eos> We're right behind you.
Henry, listen to me.<eos> No!<eos> You don't get to make decisions for me, and you certainly don't get to make decisions for my mom.<eos> - Henry, stop!<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> This isn't about the bloody shears right now!<eos> Henry: What the hell is that?<eos> Run.<eos> Turn around, mate.<eos> Captain wants to see you.
Say what?<eos> Max, I don't want a relationship.<eos> I just wanna break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar.<eos> You know, sexually.<eos> Don't drag Kit Kats into this.<eos> Who got Kit Kat?<eos> I hope Tyler knows "I'm making you dinner"<eos> is code for "I'm DTML."<eos> Down to make love.<eos> And I'm down to my last conversation with you for saying "making love." But I'm happy for you, girl.
I'm not getting it. Or anything else tonight.<eos> - Gimme that phone.<eos> - Max, no!<eos> I wanna remember what it's like to be touched on the boob.<eos> And not by a guy at LensCrafters who didn't even work there.<eos> Hello, Randy.<eos> It's the person that, uh, chose her business over seeing where things...<eos> what was that, Tyler?<eos> This is exactly how my parents got divorced.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
How you know Warren?<eos> Charter service.<eos> Shuttling the 1%.<eos> I'm a mechanic, too.<eos> Can't fly without us.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Won't be long.<eos> * The BLACKLIST * Season 04 Episode 04 "Gaia" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> Hello, Masha.<eos> I know it's late, but I wanted to speak to you alone.
But I did spend a glorious month submitting to the healing hands of an utterly divine lighthouse keeper on Bramble Cay... a low-lying island that's rapidly being submerged by rise in the sea levels due to climate change.<eos> Climate change?<eos> Our next blacklister is devoted to protecting the Earth from the greatest threat to its existence as we know it... us.<eos> He's a stealth eco-terrorist known only as Gaia...<eos> Earth Mother in Greek mythology.<eos> Okay, so, the connection between this Earth Mother and Agnes is what?<eos> What is not relevant.<eos> Only where.<eos> We must find this man... unless you have a better lead on Kirk.<eos> Has he reached out to you?
No use rescuing your daughter if Daddy winds up dead.<eos> Your guys are sure about this?<eos> They traced the server.<eos> This island, that house.<eos> Your baby's inside.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> ♪ Rock-a-bye baby ♪ ♪ On the treetop ♪<eos> ♪ When the wind blows ♪ ♪ The cradle will rock ♪<eos> ♪ When the bough breaks ♪ ♪ The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come baby ♪<eos> I'm disappointed in you. But wait.
What you didn't tell me was that you were gonna do something about it.<eos> Instead, you went behind my back and did exactly what I told you not to do.<eos> And with Reddington's help, no doubt. - It wasn't Reddington.<eos> - Then who?<eos> - A guy I used to work with.<eos> - When was this?<eos> When you were a skinhead?<eos> One of Berlin's thugs?<eos> 'Cause I'm guessing it wasn't an elementary-school teacher.<eos> I'm not gonna fight with you about this, Liz!
There's a study coming up with Paul Stanfield at the Anderson clinic in Houston...<eos> Spencer.<eos> I understand you want to help. But don't lose sight of the bigger picture.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You have a finite amount of time left with your mother.<eos> I know it's a hard thing to say, but I speak from experience.<eos> Don't squander the time you have left by being overly focused on fixes.<eos> But I want her to get better.<eos> Then get on that phone. Buy your ticket to Las Vegas.<eos> Being with you, seeing you, hearing your voice, that's the best medicine you could give your mother.
You okay?<eos> Jessie.<eos> Jessie, you okay?<eos> Jessie.<eos> Somebody help!<eos> Jessie!<eos> Jessie! Call 911!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Whoa. What's wrong with you?
She worked for Zhang Kiu.<eos> Triad boss.<eos> U.S. tried to extradite him for years.<eos> Doesn't matter anymore.<eos> Zhang Kiu was killed by a rival organization a year ago.<eos> But his assassin may be of some value.<eos> Might be able to tell us who now runs the Triad's operations.<eos> Find her.<eos> And when you do, I want first crack.<eos> I'll just tell you later.
Oh, definitely. And you realize I'm sitting on a first aid kit to see over the steering wheel, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, no. I mean, like, you were supposed to take a right.<eos> It veers off, and we were...<eos> I'll have you know that I am an excellent driver. we were getting out...<eos> Okay?<eos> So from here on out, I'm going to be that excellent driver.<eos> It's fine. 'Cause my regular job doesn't give me enough adrenaline.<eos> I got to double down with you driving. Okay.
You know, 'cause... you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.<eos> Wait, what do you mean "she's her"?<eos> Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.<eos> What?<eos> You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?<eos> I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.<eos> Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular because he's dating you.
Hey, Janet, you got time for a sketch?<eos> You have the witness here?<eos> More or less.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's almost identical.<eos> You think this will work?<eos> Hey, Eva.<eos> Hi. Are you looking for my dad?<eos> He should be here soon.<eos> No, actually I was kinda hoping I could talk to you for a second, is that okay?
He's not coming back.<eos> He's not, right?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Anyway, I'm grateful to be sober.<eos> And, sorry Soledad wrote that really mean comment about the baby's melon head.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, who else would like to share?<eos> Mom?<eos> Yes, Christy?<eos> I thought maybe you'd like to share what's going on with you.
She said it.<eos> Mom, Adam's not an alcoholic or a drug addict, he's just a normal guy.<eos> And smoking a little pot before sex is what normal people do. No.<eos> He gets high before sex because I'm not enough.<eos> Could be you're too much.<eos> I had that problem with my ex.<eos> That's why he left me for a homely woman with a lopsided bosom.<eos> You don't think you getting loaded and trying to run his mother over played a role?<eos> Well, there's no way to know now.<eos> You know, Bonnie, it's also possible that Adam's pot smoking has nothing to do with you.
For the record, almost everyone was Team Adam.<eos> So, you agree, it's not me?<eos> Oh, it's totally not you.<eos> You're blameless, you've done nothing wrong.<eos> So, how are you gonna apologize? For what?<eos> I was just getting a little buzz on.<eos> Well, yeah, but in her tortured, forever damaged mind, that was you saying she's not attractive.<eos> - But that's nuts.<eos> - No one's arguing that.<eos> Look, I'm not real comfortable talking to you about this, but... since it's on the table, I have no problem having sex with your mother without getting high.
I know I don't have to.<eos> I just want show my smoking hot girlfriend that I don't need mind-altering chemicals to bang her sweet ass into next Wednesday.<eos> Oh, swoon.<eos> Damn right, swoon.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It usually works.<eos> Well, it's certainly not working now.<eos> All right, that tone is not helping.<eos> Yeah, well, I tried being nice to it.<eos> I hope you know that this has nothing to do with you.
Oh, hey.<eos> Oh, my God, Paul, you're on time.<eos> Another box checked.<eos> Wow, you look great...<eos> Mm, mm! Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't go out tonight.<eos> I'll text you why from the car.<eos> Short version, mono.<eos> Not me, my daughter, I'm clean.<eos> Big sloppy rain check coming at you.
Man, I miss NyQuil.<eos> - Poor baby.<eos> - Poor baby my ass.<eos> I'm telling you, we're driving a getaway car.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She's very sick.<eos> Oh, I believe she's sick.<eos> I just think there's something else going on here.<eos> Like what?<eos> Think about it... all of a sudden she wants to move back in with you?
- The truth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We were out of beer.<eos> _<eos> He's 12-years-old,<eos> Marjorie, and he's getting high, and I can't help worrying he's gonna need his college fund for bail and then he's gonna find out I never started his college fund.<eos> I know but...<eos> Yeah but...<eos> But I'm...<eos> Well, if you're just gonna be calm and reasonable, I can't talk to you!
Well put.<eos> Hey, while we're here,<eos> I've been having a recurring dream where I'm at a... a big fancy banquet, and there are a lot of important people there, but I can't for the life of me find a place to pee.<eos> What do you think that means?<eos> Mom! Roscoe.<eos> Oh, sorry, I thought we were done with him.<eos> Roscoe, wait here.<eos> I'm gonna talk to your dad before you go in.<eos> You mean yell at him?<eos> Would you rather I yell at you?
Zach, it's your new room.<eos> - Check it out, bud.<eos> - So cool.<eos> - Let's see here.<eos> - What is this?<eos> Oh my god.<eos> She had a heart defect.<eos> - Who you talking about?<eos> - The little girl who must've lived here.<eos> - Hey, is everything okay with you, bud?
- Come on.<eos> - What is that, why is this happening?<eos> - They're everywhere, they surrounded the house.<eos> - What are you doing, man?<eos> - What do you think I'm doing?<eos> I'm gonna break into the fucking house.<eos> - The pets will not come in.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - They obey us, now we play.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- No, please, woodrow, don't go out there.<eos> - No, I gotta do something.<eos> - If you go out there, you're gonna die.<eos> - If she stays in here, she's gonna die.<eos> Your fucking brother, your fucking brother has to make them leave.<eos> - No, no, no, no, please, please, please don't hurt him.<eos> - Make 'em leave, you son of a bitch.<eos> - Get off him.<eos> - She told us your secret.<eos> - Michelle, what the fuck is wrong with you?
- Michelle, shut the fuck up.<eos> - Dirty Jesse.<eos> Do you still want me?<eos> You can have me, I'm all yours.<eos> We will chop your cock off, Jessie.<eos> - Stay away from me.<eos> - You have no guts, you cunt.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - You broke my heart.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hurry.<eos> - You made the seals.<eos> - They told me they would heal me<eos> - you knew what to do all along, didn't you?<eos> - I had to watch our mom burn and I couldn't do anything.<eos> - I'm so sorry, Zach.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - I just wanted to be normal, i didn't want any of this.<eos> - And these signs, they'll make the nightmare end?<eos> And what happens to you when they're gone?
We're gonna get inside you and rip your fucking soul.<eos> You whore.<eos> We are the bornless ones, we are...<eos> - I'm so sorry, Jesse.<eos> - Now I lay me down to sleep,<eos> I pray the lord my soul to keep, and if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take.<eos> You remember that one, don't you?<eos> - Mom?<eos> - We were so alone after you left us, just me and my baby boy.<eos> - I wish I was there with you.
I'm getting our coats.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> No!<eos> Bill too crinkly!<eos> Try again!<eos> Bill too crinkly!<eos> You dollar funny!<eos> This must be so difficult for you. It is.<eos> There's a lot of choices here.<eos> But I ain't talking to you.
Ah, crap. This thing was a rental.<eos> Here's your tux back, bye!<eos> Well, I'm just glad all this nonsense with Tricia Takanawa is over.<eos> Hey, what ever happened with Grandma?<eos> Yeah, that's what everybody was thinking about, Meg.<eos> Trust me, she'll come back if we need her.<eos> Hey, Stewie, seriously, thanks for everything you did to help me get my license back.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> But now you owe me.<eos> That means one day, I'm gonna come to you and ask for a favor.
Casey?<eos> Help me, Kat, they're torturing me.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Get the hell away from there!<eos> Casey!<eos> Casey!<eos> What an excellent day for an exorcism.<eos> What is your name, demon?<eos> What do you want?<eos> You... with us.
You... with us.<eos> An excommunicated priest would make quite the jewel in our crown.<eos> Then why torture Casey?<eos> You can have her.<eos> Though I didn't think that girls were your flavor.<eos> You're a coward... hiding behind a young woman.<eos> You're not fit to say grace, let alone perform an exorcism.<eos> I always knew you'd be a failure, boy.<eos> Very clever.<eos> He's very disappointed in you, your dad.
Catherine, Lynn.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> I'm sorry to barge in like this, but it couldn't wait. Okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> It's about your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She's in trouble.<eos> Okay, look, I know I have a lot to explain with my leaving the CIA, all of it.<eos> And-and that is a conversation that I want to have with you.
It wasn't until years later, when I learned about her relationship with Wo Fat.<eos> Everything that went down... it started to make sense.<eos> I started to get it, put the pieces together.<eos> I mean, the things my mother has done, the way she betrayed Yao... the operation that killed his wife... she can't... get past the guilt.<eos> The guilt of all that just haunts her.<eos> And no matter how much time goes by, no matter how much her life changes, she can't shake the burden.<eos> Well, I guess we should've knocked.<eos> I should've known I couldn't trust Danny Williams to keep his big mouth shut.<eos> That's your partner, man.<eos> He was worried about you.
Lucy, what's so important about this new job that these Mason Industries people need you to be there at midnight?<eos> Mom, I told you. I signed an NDA.<eos> - I can't talk about it.<eos> - So I won't tell anyone.<eos> Come on. Just between you and me.<eos> It doesn't work that way, okay?<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Lucy. I'm asking because I'm worried.<eos> You moved back in with me, you're ignoring your fiancé, and you are bailing on your teaching.<eos> I get how strange this all looks, and I do wish that I could talk to you about it.
No, I know.<eos> I can't leave good me like this, not again.<eos> No.<eos> No, Wyatt.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> Jessica, everyone I care about is gone.<eos> Let me do one good thing.<eos> Let me buy you the time to get out.<eos> What about us?<eos> We're counting on you.
That means he didn't want the authorities to find out who stabbed him.<eos> And if this attack is somehow connected to the crash that killed him, then...<eos> Like I said, it's not an accident.<eos> Everybody's hiding something about this case.<eos> Apparently, even Jared.<eos> That seems to be going around.<eos> Loretta...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I wasn't hiding anything from you.<eos> I assumed that Sebastian came to you before he came to me.
It was her cut.<eos> She decided to tell... Jared the truth this weekend and... somehow they found out.<eos> Which is why they killed Jared.<eos> And they... and they threatened to kill her and, um... and me, too, if... if she tried anything else.<eos> That's why I was afraid to tell you the truth.<eos> They're vicious.<eos> Well, if he's telling the truth, we need to find Dana and protect her.<eos> That's where we're headed.<eos> Christopher, where the hell have you been?<eos> I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.
Welcome to Frankfurt.<eos> You remember what I told you the last time we met.<eos> Hey, um... That stuff you taught me on the train?<eos> Mm-hmm. Got any more tips you'd like to share?<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> She's had a little taste of Jack's infinite wisdom and now she's hooked.<eos> Is that it? Hmm?<eos> Well, you'll be happy to know that Thornton and I have talked about getting you some more field training.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Once we're done with you, you'll make Jason Bourne look like Matt Damon.
Look, I don't want to talk to you about this on the phone.
It's not our job to protect them.<eos> So, everyone you've killed has been an enemy to the cause.<eos> If a few innocents have to die to save this country from tyranny, I'd say that's a price worth paying.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Lead the way.<eos> He'll want to see your face first.<eos> Jeffrey!<eos> He has a panic room?<eos> He was a paranoid guy long before we got to him.<eos> Jeffrey, we just want to talk to you.
He's been coordinating with the NYPD on the eyewitness reports.<eos> Are you worried she's been taken, or are you worried she's been turned?<eos> Let me know what Reade says.<eos> We're on the premises now.<eos> Body.<eos> No.<eos> If we want to coax Jeffrey out of that panic room, killing these guys won't help.<eos> I've got food and water to last a month and more security on their way.<eos> We're not here to hurt you.<eos> We're worried about you.
It's good to be home.<eos> You never had a chance to say goodbye to Oscar.<eos> I thought... you might want to say a few words.<eos> This... still doesn't feel real.<eos> Feels like yesterday... that we found each other again.<eos> After so much time apart, I've... finally felt whole.<eos> And now... well, now I'm alone again.<eos> You were my protector, my rock.<eos> But I couldn't protect you.<eos> I failed you, and I'm... I will never forgive myself.
The museum changes exhibits next week.<eos> It's a good time to steal something before it moves on to the next city.<eos> And the security roster during daytime events is a lot lighter.<eos> Well, the party'll give the thieves plenty of ways to blend in.<eos> Then we do the same.<eos> We go into this event undercover.<eos> If the heist crew shows up, we're there to stop them.<eos> I'll recover what I can from the mod, see if I can get a clearer picture of what they're after.<eos> Good.<eos> Reade. Can I talk to you for a second?

Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> The guy clocked me in the face.<eos> I was defending myself.<eos> Forget it... is there something else going on with you that I should know about?
Where's Reade?<eos> - You're suspending me?<eos> - No.<eos> I just want you to talk to Borden before you go back in the field.<eos> The guy a couple days ago had a gun. - He was resisting arrest.<eos> - You broke his face, Reade.<eos> And Naz is telling me that you roughed up some old guy at the museum.<eos> Who's this order coming from, you or her?<eos> It's not a suspension.<eos> I'm just worried about you.
Well, childhood trauma can affect the way the brain stores memories.<eos> Young victims of abuse often cope by disassociating from the event.<eos> Which means that the memories of the abuse are forgotten and often only recalled much later in life.<eos> But I don't recall them.<eos> But you do recall the gaps.<eos> Now, I can't help but think that the fear and frustration of not knowing is precisely what's causing these sudden, uncontrollable bouts of anger.<eos> I...<eos> I just want answers.<eos> And hopefully, I can help you get them.<eos> But I need you to know there is always a chance that you will never know for certain what did or didn't happen to you.
Ever since our days back in the sandbox.<eos> So, you're telling me that state senator Quinn Donahue is head of the Irish mob?<eos> Just wait till he's governor.<eos> Allie...<eos> Allie! He's lying.<eos> Why don't you let me talk to him alone?<eos> No.<eos> This whole alpha male pissing contest isn't helping, Kurt.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> He's not gonna open up with you there.
Put the case down, step away.<eos> Hands in the air.<eos> Oh, Patrick?<eos> Hang on, Allie.<eos> We have to keep going.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> We're fine.<eos> I know.<eos> The baby's fine, Kurt.<eos> If something happened to you...
Shut up, Monty.<eos> Okay, he's been obnoxious enough.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Whoa, whoa, who are you guys?<eos> You can't go into archives.<eos> I'm the new head of Standards and Practices at this network- - I will go anywhere I damn well please.<eos> Hampton didn't tell you about me?
I have it memorized.<eos> Hey, um, I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> These guys seep into ever corner of my personal life like black mold.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> I grew up with four sisters.<eos> Every girl I ever dated was subjected to an inquisition.<eos> So you're saying Scorpion is acting like a teenage girl?<eos> No.<eos> I think they care about you.
Hey, where you going?<eos> Let someone off the hook.<eos> Doesn't get much better than this.<eos> Picked a great place to stay, Gregorio.<eos> Quarter'll win you over if you're not careful.<eos> Spare me the folksy charm.<eos> I don't belong here, Pride.<eos> You know that as well as I do.<eos> Last night proves that.<eos> Last night had nothing to do with you.
That's where the beacon hit.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, you know where we are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where you found me during the curse, when I wandered out of the hospital.<eos> Where you saved me.<eos> What are the chances?<eos> Think it's a sign? I think...<eos> I don't know what to believe anymore.<eos> Except that it's good to be on an adventure with you again.
They have cold beer at the stadium.<eos> They don't have my couch.<eos> Besides, that downtown traffic is a nightmare.<eos> The Staples Center is downtown. We go to Clippers games all the time.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> I'm sorry, big guy.<eos> I'm... I'm just not up for the crowd.<eos> Now, I'm gonna have to side with Sam-Dawg on this one.<eos> We got a case, guys.<eos> You know, Sam, I'd be happy to roll with you.
Deeks.<eos> So, is this gonna be a regular thing?<eos> Only until my ATF paperwork is cleared.<eos> Or Hetty runs out of work for me. Mm.<eos> You look like a woman on a mission. Are you on a mission?<eos> Eric found an address for Carla Stone.<eos> Callen and Sam are heading to her school.<eos> I'm checking out her residence. All right.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I'll go with you.
- Yeah, Mr. Deeks?<eos> Here you go. Got your order.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> You, too. So, I figured that you must be sick and tired of hospital food, so I got you some... ♪ Bulgogi. ♪<eos> Yeah, I'm not hungry.<eos> What? What are you talking about?<eos> Since when do you turn down fire meat?<eos> What's gonna happen to me?<eos> Well, I can tell you exactly what's gonna happen to you.
I could use a dose of payback.<eos> Then let's gear up and get it.<eos> Only get one shot at this, guys.<eos> Let's get it done.<eos> Anybody got anything?<eos> Nothing here.<eos> I think I made out with Hazel Valentino in a place like this.<eos> - Just breaking hearts.<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> No way you got a girl to touch you.
I was there.<eos> He gave it to me.<eos> It was never his to give.<eos> Howard Stark stole from Wakanda to build that shield.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Hmm. There is a new unknown party that has been stealing the precious Vibranium.<eos> In response, I ordered all of our mines locked down.<eos> The resulting shortage has made the mystery thieves desperate.<eos> Desperate enough to send Crossbones after you.<eos> With you out of the way, the country would drop into chaos, and the Vibranium would be theirs.
Hmm.<eos> Did my father know about you?<eos> I never got that impression.<eos> What are you writing, babe?<eos> A list of reasons I'm mad at my mother.<eos> I got 22 so far.<eos> And don't think I'm ignoring the fact that you lied to me, too.<eos> When I showed up at your door two months ago, you acted like you didn't remember abandoning me.<eos> I was respecting your mother's wishes.<eos> Which is why I'm second maddest at you.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> I rented a car to drive to Albany because my sister Elise went into labor last night and she knew I had it and asked me to take her here.<eos> And I said yes, because she's the star of my play and I need her to like me.<eos> She wanted an "authentic cabin experience."<eos> You know where I have always dreamed about taking my soon-to-be-born niece someday?<eos> Epcot.<eos> It's my favorite place in the world and there's nothing more inauthentic than their perfectly clean, crime-free versions of international cities.<eos> I love inauthentic!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Keeps their heads from getting big.<eos> Yeah, so what's this about Iceland?<eos> 6:00 A.M. this morning, corpse in bag was a body in the dumpster.<eos> He was kind enough to carry an ID, but when I ran it, Interpol hit came back.<eos> He's supposed to be serving ten years in an Icelandic prison.<eos> Lost the beard since then. - Fake ID?<eos> - Nope. And no twin brother either.<eos> That's screwed up.<eos> Well, you being the man with the international connections,<eos> I'm counting on you to unscrew it.
Who is he?<eos> Tell me something.<eos> How did you get your mother to join us in the woods?<eos> That was you.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about?<eos> Lies are pointless and a waste of time.<eos> You look like whale vomit.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Song's looking for his girl.<eos> I thought she was out with you.

Look, I need the truth, Elvis.<eos> Did Commander Warbeck come to you for help on the Certel breach or because you were involved?<eos> You think I'd do something like that?<eos> You have before, Elvis.<eos> Okay, good point, good point, I have, but...<eos> I am too smart to get caught twice.<eos> Carousel?<eos> Really?<eos> You got to come in.<eos> So the FBI could scapegoat me, like they're scapegoating you and your team.
Carousel?<eos> Really?<eos> You got to come in.<eos> So the FBI could scapegoat me, like they're scapegoating you and your team.<eos> Wait a minute, Elvis.<eos> Did you hack the FBI?<eos> Hey, turnabout's fair play, man.<eos> And by the way, you're in their crosshairs, too, brother.<eos> FBI thinks that you're a killer.<eos> They will not hesitate in taking you out.
Exactly.<eos> If you feel emasculated because you don't go to work and you're staying home and doing the dishes, like, you can't take it out on your wife and then blame her for not wanting to fuck you or something.<eos> -Excuse my French.<eos> -But you're saying that the women said that they are less likely to want to fuck the guy if they're making more money.<eos> -Than the man.<eos> -Oh! Bam!<eos> Okay.<eos> No. I disagree.<eos> It's gotta be about more than that.<eos> If I don't want to fuck you, I don't care how many dishes you do or don't do, or how much laundry you do or don't do. There's something else missing.
Guys, I got a ton of work today.<eos> You are both a fuckin' bad influence.<eos> You guys, I feel like... uh, like, content. [chuckles]<eos> I wouldn't change a fuckin' thing right now.<eos> -[Noelle] I know.<eos> -Right?<eos> [exclaims] Dance with me. Dance with me.<eos> [exclaims] There it is.<eos> There it is. Get that shit, Russ.<eos> Hey, Matt, can I talk to you for a second?
I wouldn't change a fuckin' thing right now.<eos> -[Noelle] I know.<eos> -Right?<eos> [exclaims] Dance with me. Dance with me.<eos> [exclaims] There it is.<eos> There it is. Get that shit, Russ.<eos> Hey, Matt, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure, Andy.<eos> What's up?<eos> Hey! Uh, could I just talk to you in my office for a second about the report you just sent in?
-[Gabi laughs] -[scoffs] All these years go by and you think someone's going to change... and they keep doing the same shit.<eos> Baby, why would you think he's going to change?<eos> He's the most immature person we know.<eos> But he's very funny... I don't know, he makes me laugh.<eos> Yeah, I've noticed.<eos> -[chuckles] -[sighs] What?<eos> It bothers you that he makes me laugh?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Give me that.<eos> -What's wrong with you?
You make me very happy.<eos> I have nothing against him, he's very funny.<eos> He's a great friend.<eos> But that's it.<eos> -I love you. -Mmm.<eos> I love you.<eos> -Shall we sleep?<eos> -Sí. Okay.<eos> Hey, wait, wait. Wait for me.<eos> [Bernie breathes heavily] [indistinct chatter] -[Martin chuckling] What's wrong with you?
I have nothing against him, he's very funny.<eos> He's a great friend.<eos> But that's it.<eos> -I love you. -Mmm.<eos> I love you.<eos> -Shall we sleep?<eos> -Sí. Okay.<eos> Hey, wait, wait. Wait for me.<eos> [Bernie breathes heavily] [indistinct chatter] -[Martin chuckling] What's wrong with you?<eos> -[Molly] What's wrong with you?
Yo, Molly just got here.<eos> -Yeah, I invited her to celebrate and to have a great time together.<eos> -[Bernie sighs] You know, I think I'm going to leave.<eos> -What do you mean you're going to leave?<eos> -Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving.<eos> [Gabi] Bernardo, we came together.<eos> You can't go alone.<eos> [Bernie] You can stay if you want.<eos> [Gabi] What do you mean I can stay if I want?<eos> What's wrong with you?
[Martin] Salud!<eos> [Molly] Cheers!<eos> Vamos. [chuckles] [dance music playing]<eos> [Martin] Gabi!<eos> [in Spanish] Wait for me!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -I wanted to leave.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> -You aren't tired.<eos> [kisses] What is wrong with you?
Okay.<eos> I mean, I can do another one if, you know... No.<eos> No, I think... Let's... let's keep it safe.<eos> -I love it.<eos> I love it. -Okay.<eos> -Cool.<eos> -Excellent.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> And your agent told you, right?
Yeah. -Really, really nice to meet you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> -Great job. Um, I... I can only stomach about 20 minutes of this.<eos> I'm thinking let's go across the street to Lincoln Station.<eos> [Cheryl] Yeah, great.<eos> [Kyle] Grab a drink across the street.<eos> [Sophie] So, yeah, uh, thanks for your message.<eos> Yeah, the... the show was great.<eos> It was really, really good, um, so... um, yeah, we're all heading out now, so, um, I probably won't catch you tonight, but, um... maybe we can talk tomorrow. Um...
I mean, everybody's like, it's the cliché that, you know, the...<eos> It's the girl that wants to, like, you know, have kids or whatever, and... and he was there, he was at that point.<eos> -Mmm-hmm. -And I just...<eos> -You weren't ready to do it? -[sighs] I feel like--<eos> Was it that you weren't ready to do it or you weren't ready to do it with him?<eos> If I was 32 like you, I would just be happy.<eos> I wouldn't be worried about a thing.<eos> Not a thing. Not a thing.<eos> Like, if you... If you were...<eos> If I was talking to you and you were the me I was... what, 20-something years ago... [chuckles] I would... I would just say to you...
[Sophie laughs] -I'll see you on Thursday.<eos> Yeah. -All right.<eos> -[Sophie] You want a cup of tea? -[vocalizing]<eos> -[Annabelle] Uh, sure.<eos> -Are you good for tea, Kyle? -[Kyle] Yeah, I'm good, thanks.<eos> -Okay.<eos> [Kyle] My mind is my own.<eos> [Sophie] All right, I'm gonna put my wig on.<eos> [woman chuckles] [Sophie] I should probably finish my ice cream over here.<eos> -It's nice talking to you, Madeline.
[chuckles] In the grocery store now, I have to pull them out.<eos> -I can't, like...<eos> -[chuckles softly] -Hello.<eos> -What's going on, Bella?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Look at this.<eos> -What? -You're all gray.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You don't dye it or anything?<eos> -What's wrong with you?
That's good.<eos> That's a good baby.<eos> -[Annie] One, two...<eos> -Look at that.<eos> -...three, four...<eos> Yes!<eos> Nice job!<eos> Hey, Angela. How's it going?<eos> -Hey, good, Annie.<eos> How about you?
Who is it? -[man] Well-- -When is it happening?<eos> That's the rub.<eos> I don't know.<eos> The, uh, the guy who brought it, though, I think he said he worked at Dark Matter, which is some coffee place.<eos> -I'll get on it.<eos> -[man] All right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> [indistinct chatter] -Hey, how's it going?<eos> -It's going all right.<eos> How you doing, man?
I took a test today.<eos> [Jeff whispers] Hey.<eos> Jeff!<eos> It's cold as fuck out there.<eos> -How you doing, man?<eos> -I'm, uh, I'm okay.<eos> -Jason from New City.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I know. -Been talking with your brother.<eos> -Yeah. -Been trying to get a hold of you.
You're doing pretty well, eh?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was in Myanmar with Mr. Qian about setting up a casino over there, so I thought I'd stop by!<eos> Mr. Qian is here too?<eos> Yeah, he's upstairs.<eos> Full house!<eos> What the hell...<eos> Mr. Qian!<eos> Hold on, Xiaoqi.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
Naw Khar is inside the cave behind the campsite.<eos> I'm about to go in.<eos> Respond if you copy.<eos> Naw Khar, where is he?<eos> Go see if there's another exit!<eos> P'Som, Naw Khar's right here!<eos> P'Som, can you spare me? !<eos> Don't let Naw Khar get taken by the Chinese!<eos> Bingo, it's your turn to strike.<eos> I'm counting on you.
I should have.<eos> Well, at least until...<eos> Rhonda gets fixed.<eos> Will you forgive me?<eos> There is nothing to forgive.<eos> I mean, especially after you came out with a very smart question that saved the day, and without kicking down a single door.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> But I'm still not sure that I'm... cut out for this, uh... office life.<eos> You know I'm here for you, right?
Wait!<eos> He said he wanted the same thing...<eos> Death to America. And you took the credit so they could stay under the radar.<eos> What's his name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What is his name? ! - He didn't say.<eos> You're telling me you signed on to this, and you don't know the person who set you up?<eos> You're gonna lose this family.<eos> You're gonna lose your mom.<eos> All for someone who's playing you like a damn fool!
She knew you were having an affair with her mother?<eos> Yeah. And she blackmailed me for almost a year.<eos> Threatened to tell her dad all the time.<eos> Amanda acts all innocent, but she's always working some angle.<eos> I was supposed to be home by 11:00.<eos> That's my curfew.<eos> But there was a party and I stayed all night.<eos> My mom, she was really mad at me.<eos> She texted me...<eos> Sweetie, she wouldn't have stayed mad at you.
Austin, please, please don't. - Go on, get him.<eos> - What a loser.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let's do it again.<eos> Get him, Austin!<eos> I know they left you out here all night, and you weren't found until the next morning, and that nothing happened to the people who did that to you.<eos> You don't care.<eos> Nobody cares.<eos> I do care, and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to you.
Get him, Austin!<eos> I know they left you out here all night, and you weren't found until the next morning, and that nothing happened to the people who did that to you.<eos> You don't care.<eos> Nobody cares.<eos> I do care, and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to you.<eos> But nothing ever changes. Mr. Bakken is a joke.<eos> Everything he does just screws everything up.<eos> You're right.<eos> Bakken failed you.
We have two targets-- Elizabeth Keen and Agnes Keen-- traveling separate paths to an unknown location.<eos> Constantin Rostov, also know as Alexander Kirk, fled with Elizabeth in a private seaplane that departed from Playa Larga... mm, less than an hour ago, due west.<eos> - What about Agnes?<eos> - I have a lead on Agnes.<eos> She was abducted by one of<eos> Kirk's private contractors, a high-priced tracker known only as Mato.<eos> He missed the flight off the island.<eos> Then he's trapped in Cuba.<eos> There's no way he'll make it past the PNR after the international incident you just caused there.<eos> Ordinarily I would agree with you, Agent Navabi, but Mato isn't your garden-variety mercenary.
Liz.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mark Savino's office, please.<eos> Savino.<eos> Mark, hi.<eos> This is Diane up in Gerald Walker's office.<eos> Listen, Gerry just got a surprise visit from Tom and Elizabeth Keen, and, well, they're very interested to know where we are with the whole case.<eos> I'm kind of in the weeds here.<eos> Look, it can't wait.<eos> They're very upset, and she asked to speak with you directly.
Got her!<eos> The car.<eos> I need an ambulance, 310 North View Drive.<eos> During World War II, the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants smuggled Jewish children out of France to Switzerland.<eos> This was one of their staging areas.<eos> Now it's mine.<eos> Are you planning an extraction or a land war in Asia?<eos> My plan is to make contact with you as soon as Alexander Kirk is in my possession.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm going with you.
The demand is $20 million.<eos> We have 22 minutes before he starts shooting again.<eos> And the inventions, the ones he kills for, where are they?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> I'm the National Security Advisor, Harold.<eos> It's my job to know about anything that impacts national security, and it's my understanding they do.<eos> How did he know?<eos> How did Kirk know? I don't know.<eos> It wasn't me, okay?<eos> I-I was with you the whole time.
Sorry to interrupt playtime, but Hera wants you in the war room for a briefing.<eos> Both of you.<eos> We've lost communications with the Mandalorian base on Concord Dawn.<eos> Rebel leaders are concerned your Protectors are setting a trap for us.<eos> Impossible.<eos> My men are loyal to my word.<eos> Your safe passage through our system is secure.<eos> If you've lost communication, something's happened.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> I should go with you.
What's a Kalikori?<eos> A totem passed down the line of a Twi'lek family.<eos> It honors all who have come before.<eos> Each parent adds to the artwork to include themselves in the legacy.<eos> Hmm. Family history as living art.<eos> Hera would have inherited our family's Kalikori.<eos> And I still will.<eos> That heirloom was important to my mother.<eos> And I'm not ready to give it up yet.<eos> Gobi, Numa and I are coming with you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Mr. Granger, please remain completely still.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Okay, would you rather lose your sex organs or have your lips cut off?<eos> Your 11-year-old daughter plays this game?<eos> Yeah, but she has questions like would you rather have the power of invisibility or flight?<eos> All right, this is dumb.<eos> You're just stumped.<eos> Flight.<eos> You got to say why. So I could fly to work and not have to be in the car playing this stupid game with you.
None have a current investigation of ISIS agents attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexican border.<eos> None?<eos> Nada.<eos> I want to have another conversation with Carter.<eos> We don't know where he is.<eos> You don't, but I do.<eos> When he got squirrelly this morning, I put a tracker on him.<eos> Very nice, Mr. Hanna.<eos> By all means, bring him in.<eos> I'll go with you.
You see those sharks?<eos> Just babies-- couldn't even take a finger.<eos> You should've seen the size of the ones I scared off.<eos> Thanks, guys. Mm-hmm.<eos> We got 'em.<eos> It's over.<eos> Uh, what about Townsend?<eos> Turned over to the FBI.<eos> I spoke to NSA.<eos> They want to debrief you, get you back on the job.
Listen.<eos> You're not going to be in a wheelchair.<eos> You understand?<eos> And if you were, it wouldn't matter to me 'cause I want to spend the rest of my...<eos> Stop.<eos> I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I love you.<eos> It matters to me.<eos> I am not doing this to you.
Maybe this will jog your memory.<eos> Whoa! Is that a grenade?<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> How did you even get this in here?<eos> Wait, no, no, it's fake, see?<eos> - Jelly beans.<eos> - Okay. I don't care, you don't bring a grenade, real or fake, into an interrogation.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I need to build a water-delivery system into the cryogun itself.<eos> Okay, so, here's what I've got.<eos> I'm gonna introduce water right at the tip directly into the stream.<eos> Okay, this is cryogun instant freeze.<eos> That way I should be able to form a very thick layer of ice around my target...<eos> In three, two, one.<eos> ...freezing him in his tracks.<eos> That's one frozen Ribeye.<eos> My superpower is complete.<eos> I'm a little worried about you.
I agree.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Who else is with you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I was wondering where you were.<eos> This is almost done.<eos> Did you ask them to bring me here?<eos> Did you personally request to have me pulled off my station and sent to work here with you?
He's listed, right? I'll bring him in.<eos> Ok, process that and break it down.<eos> Aye aye.<eos> Just why would Gabriel send a stranger to meet me and pretend it's him?<eos> It makes no sense. Maybe he's scared, or maybe it's another one of his scams, but...<eos> Tara, let's talk.<eos> Um, what is this?<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> If someone's messing with you, they're messing with all of us.
Gabriel's been kidnapped, by someone my team has been hunting.<eos> What, someone dangerous?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is my son dead?<eos> Honestly, Dad, I don't know.<eos> I tried.<eos> I really, really, tried.<eos> But the two of you were just, you were just so different.<eos> You...<eos> I never had to worry about you.
Can't you even ask me how I've been?<eos> How have you been?<eos> Oh! Great!<eos> Sooo good.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Because in the hours that I've been locked up in here I've had the time to think about my rights.<eos> Specifically that you have to either charge me or let me go.<eos> But I say to myself, hell, let me give her the benefit of the doubt.<eos> Give her a chance to come up in here and say,<eos> Gabriel, my baby brother, I'm so sorry that I went psycho on you.
Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm positive.<eos> You are and always will be a stupid jerk.<eos> That's what I said to that kid, Martin Gumbel, that little jackass who made fun of me in Germany.<eos> He responded by drawing a swastika on my locker.<eos> So you told on him and then his friends beat you up.<eos> You always looked out for me, even as a little kid.<eos> I never told you how much that meant to me.<eos> Gabriel, you're my baby brother.<eos> I am sorry I went psycho on you.
And many other kings we know regard it with envy.<eos> We want to stay and protect our mother.<eos> You are right to think of family.<eos> So...<eos> Father wants to go to England.<eos> Why do you not want to go with him?<eos> Ubbe?<eos> You know why.<eos> Now shut up.<eos> Is it the same for you, Sigurd?
Don't be afraid.<eos> You must be King Ragnar.<eos> It is a very great privilege to meet you, King Ragnar.<eos> I am sure it does not amuse you to hear that my wet nurse told me many tales of your journeys west, and of your bravery, your resourcefulness and your fame.<eos> I think my wet nurse was a little in love with you.<eos> When can I meet her?<eos> What is your name?<eos> Astrid.<eos> But don't worry about me.<eos> Well, I'm not worried about you.
We're gonna find a way out.<eos> There is no way out.<eos> We don't have magic here.<eos> We have no way to communicate with home.<eos> Oh! This was the perfect prison for her.<eos> Which means it's the perfect prison for us.<eos> No. No.<eos> It's different for us, for... for you.<eos> You have something she doesn't. And what's that?<eos> People who care about you.
Well, then it's a good thing I know just the person to get it from him.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You want us to steal a wand from the Dark One?<eos> No.<eos> I want him to steal a wand.<eos> He is supposed to be the best thief in town.<eos> Best thief in any town, just to be clear.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You need to help me find Agrabah, our home.<eos> This is a suicide mission which has nothing to do with you.
So what's the upshot?<eos> Well, it's just like a retainer situation.<eos> Susan is sort of on call for a very small fee.<eos> It's kind of a great deal, especially if it keeps me from stepping on any more landmines.<eos> I'm so thankful to her.<eos> Me too.<eos> And she took care of it all so fast.<eos> Thank God.<eos> It really was fast.<eos> I'm really sorry I was... I gave you a really hard time about this whole thing.
I can explain that.<eos> Have you ever heard the expression<eos> "arsonist firefighter"? What?<eos> It refers to a firefighter who starts fires just so he can put them out, be the big hero.<eos> You tipped off Dearing so you could get your hooks back into me, end up in the state senate.<eos> That's absurd. Susan, I'm a decent, reasonable guy.<eos> But I have my limit.<eos> And putting Louie in jeopardy?<eos> That was ten miles past it.<eos> Matt... I need you to get out of my life and stay out, or I will dismantle you.
"Rodeo Lube 'N' Tune."<eos> "Lube 'N' Tune." Yep, look at that.<eos> The things is, people will look at me in that and know I am on a Grand Tour.<eos> You, they'll think, "What are these two old farts doing?"<eos> - Seriously-- - You have made no effort.<eos> You haven't got into the mood for this.<eos> Art, music, culture.<eos> - Refinement.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Is this something to do with you?
Best of all, though,<eos> James and I had managed to lose Hammond.<eos> He's really offending you, isn't he, with his Dodge?<eos> Honestly, I wouldn't say this lightly, but I have developed a genuine, deep, deep, heartfelt hatred for that thing.<eos> I can tell.<eos> You're going to go like Inspector Dreyfus in the Pink Panther films soon.<eos> You're not wrong.<eos> I've developed a twitch.<eos> When he comes near me and I'm waiting for that stupid noise it makes, my eye starts quivering.<eos> It's like somebody constantly being sick on you while you're trying to read a nice book.
When you arrive at a small speed hump in the Porsche, you raise its nose electrically and all is well.<eos> But when you arrive at the same hump in the BMW... you will need a team of men to fold away the spoiler and adjust the ride height.<eos> This takes several hours.<eos> There are some other issues as well.<eos> To give owners the sense they're driving a racing car, all of the storage bins have been removed.<eos> There's no cubbyhole here, no door pockets.<eos> That means there's nowhere to put anything.<eos> And I think that, on a day-to-day basis, that would drive you a bit mad.<eos> Then there's the ride, which is extremely bumpy, and the drone from the tyres, which is horrendous.<eos> After ten minutes on a motorway, you will have a headache, and you won't have any headache pills with you, because there was nowhere to put them.
But now all he has is you, your half sister, and your nephew.<eos> You have told Alex?<eos> I will.<eos> I want to.<eos> I just... I don't want to...<eos> But you're thinking twice, especially after this morning.<eos> Like father, like son, maybe.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Keeping family secrets to protect your loved ones.<eos> That's pretty much what your dad did to you and everyone else in his life.
All right, he's on his way now.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, let me know what you find. All right, Eric.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, uh, Deeks is gonna meet us at some solar roof company where the two phony sheriffs worked.<eos> A solar company?<eos> That sounds bogus.<eos> You think?<eos> Here.<eos> I promised Mrs. Ramirez I would share these with you.
Hurry up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Daddy, is it time to start the movie?<eos> Yep.<eos> You guys watch it without me.<eos> Uh, Daddy's got to run a quick errand.<eos> Oh, but you, uh, you love Police Academy III.<eos> I know.<eos> That Steve Guttenberg gets me every time.<eos> Why don't I come with you and keep you company?
You can't just kill the feelings like they're some creature that you're afraid of.<eos> That pain is a part of you.<eos> I can see it now.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Sorry, pickle mouth.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Is jemma okay?<eos> What?<eos> She's fine.<eos> She said she had a really nice day with you. Which I didn't believe for a second, because you didn't come back, so I pressed.
All White Helmets are targeted.<eos> We're all targets.<eos> We were training on the ropes when they sent us the news.<eos> Read the opening chapter of the Qu'ran for their souls.<eos> May God accept them.<eos> Everyone knows the truth about Syria, but no one's been able to stop the killing and fighting... or stop the bloodshed and the massacres that are being committed.<eos> Early reports suggest 15 people have been killed so far.<eos> Is the area populated?<eos> A wedding hall was completely destroyed and five or six buildings.<eos> Abu Omar wants to talk to you to check on his brother and son.
That's your favorite.<eos> No. No, if we both like it, I'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, "Aw, no strawberry."<eos> What about the girl behind the counter? Hmm?<eos> Well, she spends her whole day scooping.<eos> One arm's probably bigger than the other.<eos> Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?<eos> You are truly wise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'd say wise beyond your years, but you're getting up there. All right.<eos> What is really going on with you?
I know.<eos> It's also why I never open a door without knocking three times.<eos> I mean, the first one's traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.<eos> Well, what happened with your dad?<eos> We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.<eos> You poor thing.<eos> Since Amy and I have been living together, we've been bickering like my parents used to.<eos> And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?<eos> Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road. Down the road?<eos> Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!
You should probably wait outside.<eos> You should be fine, just don't make any eye contact.<eos> Can I get a Miller Lite?<eos> What do you mean, "lite"?<eos> Uh, just a Miller then.<eos> Listen, man, I need to talk to Gregory.<eos> I never heard of him.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know he's here.<eos> I'm with you, brother.
Why did Flynn show up at that house?<eos> Why does Flynn do anything he does?<eos> I don't know.<eos> On your final report, are you sure you were being forthcoming?<eos> There was a quiver in your voice.<eos> You heard my final report?<eos> Who do you think was on the other end of that phone?<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, is there a Benjamin Cahill here?<eos> Dad, some lady's here for you.
The great King Ragnar, back from the dead.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I can let you in on a secret.<eos> I'm going to raid England again.<eos> And I'm looking for warriors, like you and like you, to join me.<eos> Why do you want to raid England again?<eos> I've heard your son Bjorn has other plans.<eos> Yes, he does, but I have my own plans.<eos> To exact revenge on the destruction of the settlement.<eos> Yeah. My brother and his family went with you.
We never did find out what happened to them.<eos> But it seems you knew all along<eos> and didn't tell us.<eos> And now you want us to go and revenge, not for my brother and his wife and their children, because you didn't care for them...<eos> No...<eos> For your own guilt.<eos> And do you know what, Ragnar Lothbrok?<eos> Do you know what?<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> And if I had the mind to raid... I would raid with your son, and not with you!
And he will know where you are.<eos> He would find out anyway.<eos> I wish you were coming with me.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You said yourself, this is your destiny, not mine.<eos> Your mistakes are yours...<eos> And so are your successes.<eos> So, are you going to England?<eos> That is the plan.<eos> And who will sail with you?
As a king's son, you can have as many women as you like...<eos> Yeah!<eos> But you need one to breed with.<eos> So then you don't believe in love?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> So you loved Ragnar when you married him?<eos> And he loved you?<eos> Of course I loved him!<eos> Some say that you bewitched him.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I'm coming!<eos> Be strong.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I will.<eos> Don't come back unless you have seen or done something extraordinary.<eos> Otherwise, you will not be in the stories and what will I be able to tell our children about their famous father, Bjorn Ironside?<eos> Tell them that...<eos> I love them.<eos> May you wet your blade with blood.<eos> May the gods be with you, brother.
Here you go.<eos> - You give me that.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't care.<eos> What if we care, Father?<eos> Go on.<eos> Friend.<eos> - Have you changed your mind?<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> For that I will sail with you.
We do this then we do the product, yes?<eos> Oh, my fucking goodness!<eos> We haven't done the product yet.<eos> We can't. We can't start over.<eos> That's what that light is.<eos> That's fucking live, bitch.<eos> Yes!"<eos> "We can't...<eos> Can we start over?" "No." "I got nothing."<eos> "Oh, my God, I'm not yelling at you!
Oh, my fucking goodness!<eos> We haven't done the product yet.<eos> We can't. We can't start over.<eos> That's what that light is.<eos> That's fucking live, bitch.<eos> Yes!"<eos> "We can't...<eos> Can we start over?" "No." "I got nothing."<eos> "Oh, my God, I'm not yelling at you!<eos> I'm not yelling at you.
I reserved a table next to his, for you and your wives.<eos> I just can't believe that the French grabbed our agent the same way Conrad is trying to build bridges with the Perrin government.<eos> Should make for a pretty awkward state dinner.<eos> Your counterterrorism thing conflicting with my foreign policy thing...<eos> What couple doesn't have to deal with that?<eos> Right?<eos> I think they'll have it worked out by then.<eos> I guess we'll see if spy code really does transcend politics.<eos> Let's just say I have availed myself of it more than once.<eos> Not that I can discuss any of that with you.
Thank you.<eos> It's going well, ma'am.<eos> Can you believe this guy?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Foreign Minister Dubois.<eos> Every time he sees me coming, he heads in the other direction.<eos> It's a classic negotiating tactic. The more I chase after him, the more control he has over the discussion.<eos> Secretary Albright actually taught me that one.<eos> I believe it was, Wendy Rogers who taught me another classic negotiating tactic.<eos> If a guy won't talk to you, send in a close companion to bridge the gap.
He hates celebrating his birthday.<eos> That's why it's so fun.<eos> - (YAWNS) Sorry.<eos> Every minute here is a minute of genius not expressed.<eos> Okay, forget surprise.<eos> Friday, just tell Cap to report for cake duty.<eos> FRIDAY: Captain America has left the building.<eos> Let's go get him.<eos> HEINRICH ZEMO: Forgive me, Captain.<eos> (GRUNTS) But after crossing decades, I don't wish to waste another second on you.
Can't you convince him to change his mind?<eos> Dwayne, please.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sorry we had to run out.<eos> Yeah, not so sure I am.<eos> Mom seemed kind of pissed.<eos> She asked you to come by and talk me out of it, right?<eos> She just wants me to talk to you, Danny.
Need a hand?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sorry we had to run out.<eos> Yeah, not so sure I am.<eos> Mom seemed kind of pissed.<eos> She asked you to come by and talk me out of it, right?<eos> She just wants me to talk to you, Danny.<eos> Yeah, we both know that's not how she put it.<eos> She cares about you.
You and I, we, uh...<eos> We got a problem.<eos> Way I see it, whoever shot you is gonna shoot somebody else and dump them where they dumped you and see you're not there.<eos> And he's gonna come a-lookin'.<eos> Or... somebody reports you missing.<eos> And the cops come a-lookin'.<eos> Or...<eos> I just let you go, and you talk about what happened here, and... whoever you talk to comes a-lookin'.<eos> And I don't like visitors.<eos> So, what I'm trying to figure out is, what exactly am I gonna do with you?
And you're safe now, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> Robbie?<eos> - I just want...<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Hurts...<eos> - Robbie?<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Can you squeeze my hands?<eos> Okay, I'm right here with you, and I'm gonna help you.
Does the target live or die?<eos> Hey, I think I found something to create a cover story.<eos> It's from the Williamsburg Gazette.<eos> Three years ago, there was an apparent suicide at Camp Peary.<eos> They don't say if it was an employee, recruit, or a soldier.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We can use it.<eos> Caleb again.<eos> Good timing.<eos> I just got clearance to talk to you.
Can we please focus on how I'm gonna get to L.A.?<eos> I have low self-esteem and a well-viewed sex tape.<eos> I should be there already!<eos> Max, I'm gonna try to put this delicately.<eos> You're acting like a cray-cray psycho stalker.<eos> I am not a stalker. I'm the one that gets stalked.<eos> That reminds me, I should probably tell Gary I'm going out of town.<eos> Oh, he knows. He left a bon voyage dookie on our welcome mat this morning.<eos> But the card was sweet.<eos> Well, then as your best friend, I am going with you to make sure you're okay.
At least in this version of going down you don't have to spoon afterwards.<eos> - Oh, my God! - Ah!<eos> Caroline, amazing news.<eos> You found parachutes?<eos> Or that part of the wing that tore away?<eos> Ha, oh, no, we're goners.<eos> But Silver Linings Playbook, that finger belonged to Randy's mom!<eos> She's visiting him on set.<eos> Ah, and she's not even that cute.<eos> I am gonna be so mad at you in heaven.
You won't just push me away again.<eos> You'll lose me forever.<eos> Is that a price that you're willing to pay?<eos> All right, hold still.<eos> Thank you.<eos> After a scrap like that, I don't think I could magic a glass of warm milk, let alone heal myself.<eos> I'm lucky you happened by.<eos> Yeah, about that...<eos> Listen, let me... let me go first.<eos> I should have been the one to reach out and find you, to apologize.
This entire area's been cut off from the rest of the city by the terrorists.<eos> But you're one of New York's finest.<eos> I bet you can help me figure out a way to communicate with the FBI.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's an emergency NYPD bunker underneath this block.<eos> I think I know where it is. I just have to remember.<eos> But we're sitting ducks the second we step out of here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Alex, I don't know if you're still downtown or if you got out, but call me or text me as soon as you get this.<eos> I'm worried about you.
You feel bad about being nice to him lately.<eos> Nope.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Well, I mean... it's not fine.<eos> He cheated on your little sister, but...<eos> I don't feel guilty about anything! Oh, well, that's a first.<eos> Well, something wrong.<eos> What is it, then?<eos> New wife isn't working out?<eos> I'm done talking to you.
What is it, then?<eos> New wife isn't working out?<eos> I'm done talking to you.<eos> You're not gonna choke anybody again, are you?<eos> Will you shut up? ! Shut up for God's sakes.<eos> Hunt!<eos> Suction's full.<eos> Change it, please.<eos> Obviously.<eos> She's what's wrong with you!
I can't.<eos> Steelers.<eos> Sundaynightfootball.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Saturday night football.<eos> With who?<eos> Oh, no one.<eos> Just me.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll watch with you.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, let's do that.<eos> Come on, over here.<eos> William, let's do it.<eos> I'm not much of an actor.<eos> Oh, doesn't matter.<eos> I just need to get the lines down, so...<eos> All right, Tess, we'll start with you.
No question.<eos> My father, he loved football more than anything.<eos> Most of the time, he-he pretty much didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> But... if he was watching football, he let me sit and watch the game with him.<eos> As long as I'd sit on the floor and I didn't talk too much.<eos> I always imagined that when I had kids that I'd watch the games with them, too.<eos> Except i-I'd let them talk...<eos> As loud as they wanted.<eos> I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> God, there's nothing wrong with you, bec.
I mean, we've got a ton to figure out, of course, but I'm super pumped.<eos> Wait... that was real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stage acting, it's my new jam. Oh...<eos> Do you think you could get that really cute, uh, that theater casting director, the one who liked me. What's... Cara.<eos> Cara, yes.<eos> I love Cara... yeah.<eos> Oh, and when you get her on the phone, tell her I'm only interested in doing heavy drama.<eos> We're not moving all the way to New York City so I can do some lame off-Broadway comedy.<eos> You want me to go with you?
Yeah, if Dmitri's cover's blown, it could cause a lot of problems, not just for him.<eos> You know, don't-don't take this the wrong way, but I just, I can't really believe that with all the people that the FBI and the DIA have at their disposal, the only one who can handle this job is you.<eos> - Is there a right way to take that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I need you... here, now.<eos> Our daughter is about to write her life-defining essay on eye shadow.<eos> You can't, you can't just leave me alone with college and the State Department.<eos> State Department?<eos> How could I...<eos> You know what, by the way, I am really mad at you.
Interesting choice of greeting.<eos> It's the top trending hashtag, and soon to be keyed into the side of my car.<eos> I figured I'm make it work for me.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go.<eos> What's she worried about now?<eos> Everything.<eos> Always.<eos> How was your interview with the FBI?<eos> Fine, in and out in a half an hour.<eos> I'm actually here to talk to you about something else.
And then she asked me where I was from, and I had to start giving her Alexander Mironov's made-up history.<eos> You know, I ju...<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> That's what the last six months has been like for me.<eos> You know, what's the point?<eos> Listen, just because you have a cover story doesn't diminish who you are.<eos> The world gets more dangerous, and all I can do is watch it on TV.<eos> The bombing... the woman who pressed charges said you were watching coverage of it.<eos> Is that what set you off?<eos> Look, if I came to you and I said that, that you had to stop helping the world, how would you react?
I suggested you get a beer, not join fight club.<eos> I knew it.<eos> She sent you.<eos> I was just concerned.<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Thanks for getting me punched in the face.<eos> Could everybody just move long?<eos> This is my desk.<eos> Right.<eos> Matt, may I speak with you a minute?
That every American decries the tragedy.<eos> But somehow, when an Islamic extremist commits an atrocity, every Muslim is implicated.<eos> All my years of public service, every ounce of decency I've ever shown is erased by other people's fear and revenge.<eos> I mean, do you want to know what my donation to the mosque was earmarked for?<eos> A playground for children of the members.<eos> And do you know what they unveiled last month?<eos> A playground.<eos> It's true.<eos> The FBI sent over their report.<eos> That's... why I wanted to have a word with you.
Uh... you wouldn't happen to drive a silver Mustang, would you?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It's new.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Yeah, Sam.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's great.<eos> It's really great.<eos> Callen, Hetty wanted us up in Ops.<eos> And she wanted to speak to you, Sam.
I hope Sam sticks him with a needle in his neck.<eos> Okay.<eos> Granger and I'll check the bike shop.<eos> Looks like it's you and me.<eos> How you doing, Carl?<eos> I don't know why you came out here, Sam.<eos> I didn't talk with those goons at the dog park, and I'm not saying anything now.<eos> I just asked you how you're doing.<eos> Good.<eos> It's good to know life in here suits you.
It was more.<eos> She cared for you.<eos> You cared for her.<eos> Mmm. I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, I'm probably wrong. I...<eos> I get on these tangents.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Anyway, I, uh... checked out your visitors logs and your call logs.<eos> Nothing.<eos> So, if I was right and you threw away your life for this woman who loved you so deeply, then for sure she would have tried to make contact with you.
I'm trying it out.<eos> "Don't be a clod, vote for Dodd."<eos> That sucks.<eos> It should be:<eos> "Sly's your guy."<eos> Now lose the cape.<eos> I'm your campaign manager now.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I care about you, kid.
Jenn?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Are we at war?<eos> Mom, we're off the East Coast of the United States.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Well, then what are you doing?<eos> Reporting for duty.<eos> In the middle of the night?<eos> Ships don't sleep.<eos> In that case, I'll come with you.
- Spotless record, multiple commendations, model officer.<eos> Yeah, at first glance.<eos> You have evidence otherwise?<eos> - I got nothing, but nobody goes to the trash room for high tea.<eos> She could've been involved in something illegal.<eos> Everyone has a dark side.<eos> Hey, Ellie?<eos> I wanted to ask you something.<eos> Please, do not practice on me. What?<eos> No, I'm not gonna practice on you.
Seaman, where the hell is your brother? Ma'am?<eos> You sponsored two Tigers-- mother and brother.<eos> Where is Stewart?<eos> He called just before we left port to say he had car trouble.<eos> I gave him hell, but...<eos> Ma'am, he never boarded the ship.<eos> Someone signed in.<eos> Which means we have another problem. Yeah.<eos> An imposter.<eos> - Yeah, well, I hope you're flexible, because you can kiss your ass good-bye when I get done with you.
Maybe we can fix Cabe's trajectory by using physics.<eos> Cabe, spread out your arms, palms out for a second, let wind resistance slow you down.<eos> Hope that was enough!<eos> Hey, Walter.<eos> It's Sylvester.<eos> Sly, what the hell?<eos> ! I'm sorry you're stressed out, but you got to do me a favor and look to your right.<eos> You see that little dot coming in hot?<eos> That is Cabe.<eos> When he collides with you, you need to grab him and hold tight.
'Cause I'm fracking hungry.<eos> Nutter butter, anyone? Sure.<eos> How long is this gonna take?<eos> Who cares?<eos> We got all night.<eos> Watch out for snakes.<eos> It's right here.<eos> I'm dead serious.<eos> There's no way.<eos> The probability of that happening to you more than once is astounding.
Something wrong?<eos> Well, something's going on with her.<eos> Her grades starting dropping a couple of months ago.<eos> That reminds me.<eos> - After your...<eos> - After my dad left.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And she's from a single-parent home, too.<eos> Lately, this very inquisitive young lady has become very, very quiet.<eos> Talking to you today, that's the most I've heard her speak in weeks.
She missed you tonight.<eos> We both did.<eos> I thought you'd be home earlier.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't call.<eos> Kirk collapsed in the Post Office.<eos> Oh, well, that's good.<eos> His only hope is for a blood relative to donate stem cells.<eos> Are you thinking about it?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you about it.
Here's the thing.<eos> Depriving myself, uh... makes me absolutely nuts.<eos> So, I think I'm gonna need to loosen the reins a little bit.<eos> What does that mean, loosen the reins?<eos> That means...<eos> I'm done dieting, Kate.<eos> But I still support you 100%.<eos> Um... how?<eos> Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight for me.
We will eat sensibly, hmm?<eos> We will talk as always.<eos> We will laugh as always, all right?<eos> We'll still be us, I promise.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, congrats.<eos> Heard you got your own room.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up with you?
In any other family,<eos> I would have been the star! Yeah, you know what, bro?<eos> You're no star.<eos> That is a star.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> You don't push my body.<eos> Don't touch me, okay?<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I would have been the star! Yeah, you know what, bro?<eos> You're no star.<eos> That is a star.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> You don't push my body.<eos> Don't touch me, okay?<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Well, would you look at that.<eos> So it does.<eos> I'll be darned.<eos> They can't cancel our play on Christmas Eve. Who does that?<eos> What did you think would happen?<eos> Our lead actress vanished a month ago, off the face of the planet, rode away from your cabin, so thank you very much.<eos> "Thank you very much"?<eos> What did I do? You got involved with her.<eos> You slept with the Tony-nominated star of my play and ruined everything.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too. It didn't ruin anything.
And now, because of you, I have to go to Hanukkah dinner at my parents' house and tell them and my perfect sister that the play isn't happening-- years of hearing that I'd never be a playwright, and then finally I was, but now I'm not.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Really, I'm sorry.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Come to dinner with me.<eos> Oh, thanks, yeah, but I have this Christmas Eve tradition thing I do at my brother's.<eos> No, I'm not really asking you. You owe me.<eos> Why do you want me to come to your family dinner?<eos> 'Cause I told Mom I'm dating the Manny. That seems weird.<eos> Well, I'd just made the huge mistake of sleeping with you.
What are you doing out here, man?<eos> Just taking a break, man, smoking. Oh.<eos> Didn't know you smoked.<eos> Yeah, I just, I just, I just picked it up.<eos> Where are your cigarettes?<eos> Yeah, I forgot them.<eos> Everything okay, man? Everything's good.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about the boat, but I'm not really a fan of heights.
Which is what you're gonna get if you don't get out here right now, how about that?<eos> All right, hold on, watch this.<eos> Eric, hit them with the picture frame.<eos> You know you're destroying evidence, right?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm right here, relax.<eos> Come on, I got to show you something.<eos> You spooked me, man.<eos> Look how cool it is.<eos> Great job, kiddo, it looks just like you.
"That's okay, Father."<eos> I don't see Father Tomas here.<eos> He'll be a tough nut - to crack, Your Eminence.<eos> - Yeah. We have our ways.<eos> You came.<eos> Yes.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Keys in the bowl, cell phone, your watch.<eos> No time here.<eos> I-I cannot sleep with you.
So what if normal people, what if citizens want to protect themselves and their families from the bad guys?<eos> Shouldn't they have a right to do that?<eos> How about if we just don't let the bad guys have any guns?<eos> Then the good guys won't need any guns, and nobody needs any guns, how about that?<eos> And you know what else?<eos> While we're at it, we can eliminate discrimination, war, hatred, violence, all that kind of stuff.<eos> We'll all live happily ever after, and we can, uh, you know, ride our unicorns to work every day.<eos> And you'd probably commandeer my unicorn, and drive it to work every day.<eos> If you had a gun, you could stop me.<eos> You sure you don't want me to come with you?
Maybe I'll send a press release.<eos> Agent Francis, what do we know?<eos> Well, I know you haven't returned my last three phone calls. you know, um...<eos> You've been meaning to call but you forgot.<eos> You know what, no.<eos> You're a really sweet guy, and we did have something a while back, but it's just...<eos> No buts.<eos> Hint taken.<eos> No hard feelings, okay?<eos> You'll be hard to stay mad at.
The Savior!<eos> Perhaps I can help you, after all!<eos> For a price.<eos> A deal?<eos> You're not even real.<eos> Well, no one knows more about Saviors than I.<eos> All I need in return is one teeny, tiny, little thing... my freedom.<eos> No.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> The world is better off with you behind bars.
Majid Nassar is at an undisclosed location both for his protection and for the safety of those guarding him.<eos> Seth. Any update on Brad Weston?<eos> Yes.<eos> The president had a very productive meeting with the Russian ambassador, and we're hopeful that the situation will be resolved soon, okay?<eos> Thanks, everybody.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lisa, hey.<eos> Well, if it isn't Seth Wright.<eos> You have that comment for me, or you just miss me already?<eos> Can I talk to you privately? Yeah.
What's up?<eos> Luke never got off the bus.<eos> I came to the school.<eos> He's not here either.<eos> All right, well, did you look everywhere for him?<eos> Check the baseball field?<eos> Or did you call the police?<eos> No, I called you.<eos> Okay, Yvette, hang up the phone and call the police.<eos> I'm gonna meet you at the school.
Thanks for everything.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What's up?<eos> Just wanted to say good night. Okay.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I don't know. It...<eos> A lot's happened in this last six weeks.<eos> I feel like I haven't seen you or talked to you.
You're right. Okay.<eos> Contact the FBI, CDC, and DHS.<eos> Get them to form a joint task force. Mobilize them immediately.<eos> I want updates as soon as they come in.<eos> Seth, I want you to tell the press that the inspections are precautionary due to the state of alert in the country.<eos> We've got 17 hours, everybody.<eos> 17 hours.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Seth, can I borrow you for a second?
Not exactly how I pictured it.<eos> Sir, in the history of the Republic, federal elections have never been canceled, not by weather, war, or threat of an attack.<eos> Unfortunately, we're living in a time of firsts.<eos> Could I have a moment, please?<eos> Sir.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Hey.<eos> Um... the results came in.<eos> Leo's waiting.<eos> He wants to talk to you alone.
Both of them.<eos> NSA analyst turns traitor.<eos> Deputy FBI director commits murder.<eos> It doesn't add up.<eos> What does your gut say about Thompson?<eos> Well, despite the advice of my National Security Team, the protocols of the Office of the Presidency, and my own common sense...<eos> I don't think this guy's crazy.<eos> He's smart.<eos> And he knows once he leaves the protection of the embassy, he's going to prison for a long time.<eos> So whatever the reason for wanting to sit down with you is, it must be pretty important for him to trade in his life for it.
- Have a good night.<eos> - Get home safe.<eos> Will be his wife, Beth, and their two daughters.<eos> Can you believe everything that's happened?<eos> It's been a roller coaster, for sure.<eos> You know, I have to admit, when I first got here, I thought that you were gonna do everything you could to get me out of the White House, not be the reason I'm still here.<eos> Well, I have to admit, when you first got here, I didn't think you could handle it.<eos> Yeah, you called me a minor leaguer.<eos> Yeah, well, I was wrong.<eos> If anything, I'm learning from you.
Maybe I wanted to believe it so much that I was experiencing the placebo effect, too.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please, no.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, no.<eos> My son needs me.<eos> Please, I don't want him to grow up like his father!<eos> Remember what your father did to you?
No, Mom.<eos> Pat and Grace live in Las Vegas.<eos> You're in Houston, at the Anderson clinic.<eos> You moved there last month, remember?<eos> What did your father make you do?<eos> Atone.<eos> He would take me out to the cornfield... _<eos> Leave me there.<eos> Wouldn't come back until the next day.<eos> I'm sorry that he did that to you.
- Come on, give me a break.<eos> All day long, all you've been talking about is problem solving and efficiency.<eos> I was just trying to be efficient.<eos> This is the last time I do you a favor.<eos> Go ahead and fail your Homeland exam.<eos> What Homeland exam?<eos> Guys!<eos> Focus on the plan.<eos> Toby told me to help you with a non-existent test?<eos> Ralph asked me to pal around with you in Ireland.
You mean the cemetery we're about to go into?<eos> This cemetery?<eos> How long do we have?<eos> 15 minutes, unless the wind picks up, which it may.<eos> Do you guys have any good news?<eos> Yeah, if you die, you'll be conveniently located.<eos> Get everyone the hell out of there!<eos> Pardon me, Father?<eos> Sylvester Dodd, hi.<eos> We'll drive to you now to evacuate the infirm, but we have to get the rest of the town to run south.
During Navy SEAL training, they taught us a technique to hold our breath.<eos> Intentionally hyperventilate, then take a breath of pure oxygen.<eos> So you flush out the CO2 in your body and then you preload it with unconverted oxygen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> End result being you can hold your breath for minutes longer.<eos> After the initial breath, you won't need Uncle Tobin's oxygen tank.<eos> Guys, I hate to rain on your parade, but a few additional minutes isn't gonna be enough time for you to deliver 100 pounds of Epsom salts to the center of the cloud and get back.<eos> It's a one-way trip, Timbo.<eos> Not if we split the burden.<eos> I'm going with you.
In one of the boxes Cabe was storing here.<eos> He looks like an extra in Dragnet.<eos> I was thinking, a rushed wedding-- that might not be the best move for us.<eos> You sending me a signal?<eos> I said my divorce was finalized and you said "meh".<eos> And then you postponed the wedding by upping the guest list 4,000%.<eos> Now, what gives?<eos> You don't want to marry me anymore?<eos> Happy, Happy.<eos> I still want to marry you, more than ever.
I just...<eos> I want everyone to know it.<eos> So you want to show me off like a piece of meat?<eos> Exactly. There's dozens of people in Brooklyn that need some comeuppance.<eos> It's just really not my style.<eos> I know.<eos> We're back.<eos> Exhausted.<eos> Toby, I bought you a new Irish tweed hat, but I'm too tired to unpack it.<eos> Tim, can I talk to you for a second?
Previously on Scorpion...<eos> I am running for the 16th district Alderman of West Altadenia in the local upcoming election.<eos> I'm your campaign manager, now. What?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I care about you, kid.
But just remember, we have a plan.<eos> It's a solid plan.<eos> Okay. Walter, we need you.<eos> Three blocks away, there's a dive shop.<eos> We might be able to cobble together something for you to wear in the tar.<eos> "Cobble together"?<eos> That doesn't sound like a very solid plan to me.<eos> Believe me, we've been to space and back with less preparation.<eos> Michael, stay with me.<eos> I'm right here with you, Beth.
That's... way out of town.<eos> I think it's about time I have a talk with Cabe about making my position here permanent.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Conning Paige may have been an efficient way to impress her, but it's not the honest way.<eos> Well, for the record, this makes me want you to end up with her even more.<eos> You're a really good man, Walter, and I wish you luck, 'cause... that guy's planting roots.<eos> Guys, we're here!<eos> We need to get going if we're gonna beat Christmas Eve traffic and make good time to the cabin.<eos> The car's pretty full, but there's room for one more.<eos> I'll ride with you!
That little desk, that's you trying to undermine me.<eos> You know, I-I really thought that we were supposed to be friends now.<eos> I should be angrier, but your attempts are... pretty pathetic.<eos> Pathetic?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You covered my face in a photo.<eos> You don't think Paige is gonna see that?<eos> Look, you might be a genius, Walter, but when it comes to her, you've got a lot to learn.<eos> Just being honest with you.<eos> Let me be honest with you.
All right, they're all secure.<eos> It's safe to bring up Ralph.<eos> All right, you listen up. You're all officially on the naughty list.<eos> You move, you're gonna get worse than coal up your stockings.<eos> Cabe!<eos> The cellar's empty... They're gone.<eos> Mom!<eos> Mom!<eos> Sam's taking Ralph!<eos> I'm coming with you!
Paige told us you're leaving.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a great opportunity and Paige and I both know it's where I should be.<eos> You know, Tim, um, we geniuses are a tricky breed.<eos> Hard people to get along with.<eos> We can be a little moody.<eos> Neurotic.<eos> Condescending, but you were a team player. You put yourself in danger and, you saved my life when Mark Collins kidnapped me.<eos> And you were still a jerk to him.<eos> I was still a jerk to you, but bottom line, we're...
I'm fine, thank you.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I've never done anything like this before. Maybe it was your hair.<eos> You see, I had a fiancee once and she was a redhead.<eos> So maybe that's what did it.<eos> Maybe if you'd been blonde I wouldn't have laid a finger on you.<eos> No.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> I suppose you'll be reporting me to the police?<eos> I'll go with you now if you want, tell them what I've done?
AZMORIGAN:<eos> Stop! Wait for me, huh?<eos> Ugh. You have got to be kidding.<eos> Azmorigan, this is dangerous work, my frail friend.<eos> Perhaps you, with your lovely singing voice, should stay here.<eos> (LAUGHING) You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> Me stuck here while you claim the best treasure.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, forget it!<eos> This job is half mine, and I've got the manifest.<eos> I go with you, or we don't go at all.
Look, Bozer, I'm gonna get you through this.<eos> You just need to stay calm.<eos> This feels so un-American.<eos> What up, Boze?<eos> Why do you have a gun? !<eos> Why does he have a gun?<eos> !<eos> Please tell me you got a gun, too!<eos> Uh, I never use 'em.<eos> Jack, I'm gonna hang with you until this is over.
But this guy is... is different.<eos> He's really good.<eos> Beyond badass.<eos> Maybe better than me.<eos> So, I'm just gonna have to leave you behind on this one, okay?<eos> Well, yeah. If he's that good, I need to be with you,<eos> - not stuck in a...<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm not argue with you about this, all right?
That'd kill me.<eos> Don't do that to me.<eos> You know, sometimes the best way to watch your back is to have your back somewhere else entirely.<eos> You understand?<eos> That's his car up there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That means he could be close.<eos> Keep an eye out now, be careful.<eos> Hey, man, you talking to me yet?<eos> I've always talked to you, Mac.
I got something.<eos> Reese, don't!<eos> Did I do this?<eos> Mom... Dad...<eos> Did I do this? !<eos> So, which one's your sister?<eos> I'm looking.<eos> Since when do insurance agents get to have this much fun?<eos> I wouldn't worry about it, buddy.<eos> If she's anything like you, I'm sure she's having a miserable time.
And it's in the Hills.<eos> Well, that one would've been perfect, until someone rented it three days ago.<eos> Damn.<eos> Yeah, well, it's L.A. 2016, you know.<eos> Things move fast.<eos> Even online, everything I find in my price range is already rented.<eos> I mean, I guess you could always bunk here.<eos> You know, Mac and I can turn the attic into a third bedroom.<eos> Nice try.<eos> But I'm not moving in with you.
- I am not a priest.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Okay, what about doctor/patient confidentiality?<eos> That doesn't apply.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Does that apply?<eos> H-How does that apply?<eos> I'll tell you what applies.<eos> Maybe you don't let somebody confess to you in the first place because once you know, you can't un-know.
I'm married.<eos> What?<eos> I'm married.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Since before I met you.<eos> And I should have told you. But I'm married to a guy who almost beat me to death.<eos> And I can't divorce him because I ran away from him.<eos> And I'm not...<eos> Jo Wilson isn't my real name.<eos> That's why I couldn't marry you.
That's why I couldn't marry you.<eos> That's how this whole thing started, and...<eos> I should have told you.<eos> You're married.<eos> Yes.<eos> And you didn't tell me.<eos> I was scared. I...<eos> Scared of what?<eos> Did you think I'd get mad?<eos> You thought I'd get mad at you for trying to get yourself out...
Not our business, right?<eos> Not our business.<eos> If you want to grab a beer...<eos> Actually... I want to go home and see my wife.<eos> I get it.<eos> Another time? Rain check.<eos> Right on.<eos> Hey, let me know how it goes, huh? Yeah.<eos> They don't get to make this decision.<eos> There is nothing wrong with this program, - and it is totally disrespectful to you.
Hey, let me know how it goes, huh? Yeah.<eos> They don't get to make this decision.<eos> There is nothing wrong with this program, - and it is totally disrespectful to you.<eos> - Maggie...<eos> And if they want a fight, they can have it.<eos> I am not scared.<eos> Maggie!<eos> Look, I appreciate it. But, um...<eos> I'm not sure this is a fight I can win.<eos> I'll fight with you.
You okay?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> I know. I know.<eos> Church and state.<eos> No.<eos> To hell with church and state.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> It's not how to do this job.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
All right, I'm turning around.<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> Just stop singing.<eos> All right, got it.<eos> You know, um, Tim, until we come to a group decision, I don't know if it's right for you to be in here.<eos> I'm just getting some specs for Delilah and I in case we're lucky enough to get the place.<eos> We've got to get this group meeting on the books.<eos> You know, Mr. DiNozzo, I was gonna tell you, I don't think anyone is gonna willingly give this place up.<eos> Think you're gonna have to make a decision.<eos> Which reminds me, there's something I wanted to tell you about. Oh.
You'll convince her.<eos> You know.<eos> Mothers and sons belong together.<eos> Now, eat your sandwich.<eos> I need you to promise me.<eos> You'll find the boy.<eos> I promise. You've been so patient.<eos> And I've missed you so much.<eos> You look suspiciously well.<eos> I ordered you a negroni.
Correct if I'm wrong, but wasn't that supposed to go kaboom?<eos> Yes!<eos> I need bullets.<eos> Last one, stud.<eos> Make it count.<eos> They're looking for new way up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not good.<eos> You need to find cover, Jack.<eos> No, I'll race you.
Be sure to leave me a postcard from whatever hole we dump you in.<eos> Mac!<eos> You had me scared for a minute.<eos> You still mad at me?<eos> Oh, no, I'm still hella mad.<eos> I'm just glad you're alive.<eos> Look, of all the mistakes I've made... and I've made a lot of them, the one I regret the most is lying to you.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> And I never meant for any of...<eos> Just to clarify, being mad at you is like being mad at a puppy for chewing your favorite kicks.
Everybody fall back in so I can turn out this fearsome group of crime fighters.<eos> We have a dark, late model SUV that was spotted leaving the scene of the last job.<eos> Let's keep our eyes open, and, as always, be safe out there.<eos> He doesn't listen;<eos> I don't know what's wrong with him.<eos> Sullivan, hey, hey.<eos> Congratulations, kiddo.<eos> It's your first tour.<eos> It's a big deal.<eos> Look, I told you I was gonna ride out with you on your first day, but I'm buried in the task force.
Nicky was dealing heroin all over the hood.<eos> Now, I didn't know him, but maybe Stan did.<eos> So, I'll do some digging around.<eos> And hey, do not underestimate Stan Moreno.<eos> He's a snake.<eos> Don't worry, I'll be careful.<eos> Come on, I taught you better than that.<eos> If you're gonna go bacon cheeseburger, then you gotta go all-in with the fries and the shake.<eos> Gonna tell me how to eat now too?<eos> You think I'm being hard on you?
- No, no, no, you see 'cause...<eos> - I made a mistake.<eos> - Frank, it just... please.<eos> it's not... it's not about last night, it's...<eos> I love you.<eos> I will always...<eos> I will always love you.<eos> But it's over between us.<eos> The past two years have... they've changed you in ways that frighten me.<eos> And I'm worried about you, but I'm more concerned about that darkness touching Raimy and I can't let that happen.
- Really, Doctor?<eos> - Have you...<eos> Are you seeing a therapist?<eos> I...<eos> I got no job, I can't keep a woman around, and my daughter is leaving.<eos> So what I am is sad.<eos> And how'd this become about me?<eos> I asked you to talk Sarah out of throwing<eos> - the rest of her life away.<eos> - She's concerned about you, and so am I. I...
Look at Dad.<eos> - My God, you seriously think I'm Dad?<eos> - Yeah, lo...<eos> I mean, that's...<eos> I don't know, but it-it's nothing to be embarrassed about if you need to talk to somebody.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> What are you thinking, telling Uncle Worrywart that I'm depressed?<eos> What were you thinking, trying to get him to talk me out of the Army? And you are depressed.<eos> - What is it with you people?<eos> - What is it with you?
China's agreed to vote yes on reinstating the sanctions.<eos> So the chicken tariff worked!<eos> Turns out the solution to China's game of chicken was... chicken.<eos> Ma'am, the French Foreign Minister has requested a meeting.<eos> Isn't she in New York for the U.N. Security Council vote?<eos> No, she's on her way here.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Jackson.<eos> I told you I wanted to see Henry McCord.<eos> That's the wrong McCord.<eos> She has a meeting scheduled with you today.
Yeah, well,<eos> I installed the damn thing incorrectly, ended up falling and wrenching my back.<eos> It was a disaster.<eos> Man.<eos> Well... at least you can tell yourself you did everything you could.<eos> Marriage... it's tough.<eos> Not for old Hank McCord.<eos> So,<eos> Russell Jackson asked you to come butter me up?<eos> Well, to make a case for Dalton, but I was up front with you about that, man.
So,<eos> Russell Jackson asked you to come butter me up?<eos> Well, to make a case for Dalton, but I was up front with you about that, man.<eos> - Mostly, I came just to catch up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 'Cause we're such good buddies.<eos> Jeff, is there something on your mind?<eos> Corpus Christi.<eos> What about it?<eos> The night before my final solo flight, you forced me to hit the bars with you.
Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me.<eos> And I can't eat, I can't sleep. And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.<eos> You heard him, guys, don't ask.<eos> Why would she keep something from me, you know?<eos> I shared my body with that woman.<eos> And my Netflix password.<eos> They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.<eos> Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just... she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She's enjoying living with you and she didn't want it to end early.
St. Aquinas.<eos> God... spoke through you, Henry.<eos> Father... does this mean anything to you?<eos> - Uh, the number 162?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, ever since I woke up from the accident, I've had this, uh... - low-frequency sound in my head.<eos> It's like being in a restaurant, and... everyone is yammering away in the background.<eos> Except sometimes, sometimes it feels like there's a pattern.<eos> Like, all at once, all those people start saying the exact same thing at the exact same time.<eos> Are they talking to you right now?
As a guy that works...<eos> No?<eos> As a craftsman?<eos> "That's some sturdy shit.<eos> Man, who built this?<eos> I'm gonna be up here a while.<eos> Three days at least."<eos> No, never?<eos> Okay. Moving on.<eos> I'm just fucking with you, Paul. I gotta ask.
All of a sudden, a bunch of rich white girls from Seattle was like, "Brooklyn's mines now," and then they just owned it.<eos> Just took it.<eos> Just took the scariest part of my childhood.<eos> I don't know how the fuck they did it.<eos> I think white girls killed Biggie.<eos> I think that was phase one.<eos> I think they shot Biggie and took Brooklyn away.<eos> White women just take whatever the fuck they want, man. I've seen it.<eos> You know what a white girl could do?<eos> A white girl could walk up to you drunk, she'll be drunk, just walk right up to you at a bar and just take your hat off your head... -...put it on her head and then just walk the fuck off with your property.
Shot your own pa with a poaching rifle.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Why do you think the Church took you in?<eos> Because of your potential?<eos> Or because they saw a scared, troubled child, and knew that all it would take was one little push to make you kill and kill again?<eos> It didn't take much convincing.<eos> That's your legacy.<eos> A lonely trail that ends in a dreary room without a single soul to mourn your passing.<eos> Why die for them, Marcus?<eos> For a Church who never gave one single damn about you?
These are my people.<eos> We made it.<eos> Once we get inside, we will be separated.<eos> If you are smart, you will not be hurt.<eos> When I can, I will find you.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> I think you brought me here for a reason.<eos> No matter what they do to me, you have to act like a cripple,<eos> and then they won't feel threatened by you.<eos> And what are they going to do to you?
BERT:<eos> Come in. All right, let's do this...<eos> Bert? We need to talk.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Rock, rock, water fountain.<eos> I am not proud of this.<eos> But I have been envious of your recent success.<eos> Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me.<eos> Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.<eos> I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.
I mean, is it too much to ask for some lyrics? Huh?<eos> It takes three dudes to deliver a pizza?<eos> Looking for Jaden.<eos> And some aspirin, but Jaden first.<eos> Who are you guys?<eos> We're in the market for some new hardware.<eos> Jaden knows me.<eos> It's cool.<eos> We got a Geek Squad problem, and they're busy.<eos> So we came to you, Cheech.
I was forced to watch it and be completely paralyzed.<eos> That is a guilt that eats away at you.<eos> You want to know why I have a gun?<eos> So I never feel paralyzed again.<eos> So I can step in and do something.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> That... that's all you have to say? "Okay"?<eos> Look, if... if this is just sex, I get it.<eos> That... that's fun, you're fun, but I can have fun with anyone, and so can you.<eos> So, I'm opening up to you, and you can either step up and show me who you are, or you can find someone else to have fun with.
Athelstan...<eos> Was a man of god.<eos> And now he is dead.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Floki killed him.<eos> So your gods killed him.<eos> No, floki killed him out of jealousy.<eos> Because I loved athelstan more than him.<eos> I was jealous, too.<eos> When he chose to go back with you.
Yeah, you know, something that loves me and needs me and isn't allowed to leave.<eos> Way to go, Marjorie.<eos> ... which is when I said, "Way to go, Marjorie."<eos> I was just trying to give Jill perspective.<eos> And it was a good idea.<eos> That went horribly, horribly wrong.<eos> So you guys all went to a soup kitchen without me?<eos> Yeah, and it was full of good-looking single guys.<eos> Don't get me wrong. I love her, but Jill is the last person in the world who should be having a baby.<eos> Normally, I'd agree with you, but, I know a lot of women with no maternal instincts who turned out to be great mothers.
Yes, you require some help with some Pashto translations.<eos> Yes, "some" being hundreds of hours of interrogations.<eos> Hope you didn't have any evening plans.<eos> This is top priority.<eos> Work comes first.<eos> That's the right answer.<eos> Dinner's on me.<eos> Oh, uh, look, it's, uh, MI6 Officer Clayton Reeves.<eos> Boy, am I happy to see you.<eos> What's with you?
I was once in a similar situation as you.<eos> And when I thought all hope was lost, it was Agent Bishop and NCIS who stood by me.<eos> I am alive because of them.<eos> Trust only works when it goes both ways.<eos> When I met Dawar Mahdavi, I didn't know who he really was or the terrible things he had done.<eos> We had only spoken to each other in passing at our mosque.<eos> My life ended because of a man I hardly knew.<eos> I told the truth, and no one would believe me.<eos> No one except for Derrick.<eos> We can't change what happened to you, Amir, but we are gonna finish what Commander Reza started.
And the U.S. has an excuse to invade Cuba.<eos> Yeah. But Oswald was shot to death by Ruby, and those bastards had to cut their losses.<eos> Chin, what is it?<eos> I think that guy's been following us.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Who was that guy?<eos> I don't know, but he was outside the hotel earlier, too.<eos> Well, whoever he is, he left this.<eos> "4:30.<eos> Come alone." Please take me with you.
The Bilderberg Group.<eos> Paul McCartney's decoy.<eos> Apollo 11. Although, we did have some major disagreements on that one.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Susie thought we actually did go to the moon?<eos> No, she just didn't think that Kubrick was involved in faking it.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, Jerry, I'll make you a deal.<eos> Next time you feel like sharing, coffee's on me.<eos> All right?<eos> Now listen, I can't promise I'll-I'll agree with you... ever, but I, I won't think you're crazy.
This is for the Senate!<eos> Bring him to the palace... alive.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Let him through!<eos> Commodus. Thank the Gods, you're alright.<eos> They came for you too?
Dustin says no, he is not the killer.<eos> I say we keep that creep in there awhile just on principle.<eos> Hey, honey, did your aunt ever take you to the music academy at night?<eos> Did your aunt ever take you to the academy after dark?<eos> Any idea why?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kid's been through a lot.<eos> Might be worth getting him a counselor.<eos> Maybe. But he's warming up to you, Pride.
You know, Raj, honey, you're being too hard on yourself.<eos> When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women.<eos> I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.<eos> Oh, great, now I can say things like "I can't believe you're breaking up with me."<eos> "Why are you breaking up with me?"<eos> "Yes, I'll still help you move."<eos> Anyone else want to try?<eos> Uh, yeah, I got something.<eos> Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner.<eos> Did your doggie break up with you too?
They came like everybody else, where they're like,<eos> "Hey, where you goin' tomorrow?" "America."<eos> What part?" "Maybe you've heard of it.<eos> It's called none of your fuckin' business.<eos> 'What part?<eos> ' Mind your business." And...<eos> The Italians, they brought the volume.<eos> Because the Irish and Jews were still, in the house:<eos> "Get in here.<eos> I'm gonna fuckin' talk to you."
he knows you don't belong here.<eos> your life still has purpose. Just have faith.<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm lost.<eos> do you know where my room is?<eos> this is it.<eos> I remember now.<eos> sleep well.<eos> be careful with fire next time so you don't burn yourself.<eos> I'm coming with you.
But we are getting Harold's old financial records from archives.<eos> We got lucky.<eos> Bank never got around to destroying them.<eos> Hopefully, there'll be deposits around the time Tom Simon was shot.<eos> We're thinking we find those, we find who paid him.<eos> Look for deposits from Nina Chen.<eos> She was an accountant that worked with Earl.<eos> They were close, maybe a little too close.<eos> In the meantime, let's track down Nina, see what she has to say.<eos> All right, I'll meet you in your office in a minute.
Interesting look you chose.<eos> I can get past the symmetry and muscles though.<eos> So is this your girlfriend?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> - I'm his sister.<eos> - That's my sister.<eos> Yeah, I've been bugging him for years to let me come, and finally he gave in.<eos> - Look, Finklestine...<eos> - Stein. Yeah? I need to talk to you about my goggles.
We will do everything in our power to get this girl back, okay?<eos> It's gonna take at least an hour to arrange a flight.<eos> Let's use that time to call the DEA.<eos> They got people on the ground there who know what's going on.<eos> Okay?<eos> Let's be smart about this. Let's do it right.<eos> For Sara.<eos> You understand?<eos> - All right, all right, let's go.<eos> - Okay? I'll meet you at the office, all right?
Williams.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am in Mexico.<eos> More specifically, I am in Juarez.<eos> I'm standing in the middle of a morgue.<eos> I need to ask you a very important question.<eos> Hypothetically speaking, if I needed to identify a body that's been burned badly, how would I go about doing that?<eos> Six years of medical school, four years of residency, a yearlong fellowship, get board certified...<eos> All right, that's funny, Max.<eos> I obviously cannot do any of those things right now with you on the phone.
Where is it?<eos> - Eve?<eos> - Flynn.<eos> What is this?<eos> This is an intervention.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means that we think you're in crisis and that you need immediate care to restore equilibrium to the biopsychosocial functioning.<eos> It means you've been a winging sook.<eos> And it's startin' to piss us off.<eos> Actually, no, it means we care about you and we're concerned.
Logic clearly dictates the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.<eos> Okay, who said that, Plato?<eos> No, Spock in "Star Trek II:<eos> The Wrath of Khan," but I think it's still true.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.<eos> You are not walking away again.<eos> Oh, really? Well, bring it.<eos> I'd like to see you... ah! Ah!<eos> The pain clear your head?<eos> Are you ready to tell me what's going on with you?
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.<eos> And, in the meantime, let's keep that price tag between us.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I understand.<eos> I thought you said you were right behind me.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> Didn't want to risk losing the Eye of Ra.<eos> I didn't want to risk losing you.<eos> Librarians are a dime a dozen these days, but a Guardian, they're a little harder to come by.<eos> What happened to you down there?
Isn't it to energize the national economy?<eos> He's a hard-working young man.<eos> What?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Last night you went to a club to pick up girls, didn't you?<eos> Then you went out drinking at a street stall.<eos> I just drank a bit.<eos> I went straight home afterward.<eos> It's true!<eos> You are dead today.
Radiation is leaking out from there!<eos> If we stay here, we're all going to die!<eos> Jae Hyeok?<eos> What about Jae Hyeok?<eos> Yeon Ju, what about Jae Hyeok?<eos> How is Jae Hyeok?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Oppa is fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> Then why didn't he come here with you?
You can't walk far.<eos> Why did you get off the bus?<eos> What should we do?<eos> There's too much traffic to move.<eos> Everyone is abandoning their cars and running away.<eos> I understand.<eos> Just get away.<eos> Even if you're tired, don't rest and keep going.<eos> Get as far away as possible.<eos> Oppa, you're okay, aren't you?
The sewage workers pump out the groundwater.<eos> If nobody's Manning the pumps, whole system floods.<eos> All of this will be underwater.<eos> You'll be forced into the terminal or back out in the streets.<eos> And if Boston is still burning or if what he's saying is true...<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> We're not gonna be down here that long.<eos> - Do you want to stay here or do you want to go?<eos> - It's gonna blow over. - These things always do.<eos> - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Can I come with you?
The end of the road.<eos> No other options.<eos> Ray, what's that around your neck?<eos> - This, my friend, this is gonna...<eos> - Ray. This is gonna blow my mind.<eos> You better step away, my friend.<eos> - Okay. Hold on.<eos> - Step away, Clay!<eos> Stay here. I'll be back.<eos> No, no, no, no. I'm going with you.
Respectfully, Commander, my name is Khadgar.<eos> My deepest apologies, Khadgar.<eos> You see, I thought we bonded when I didn't put you in a prison cell for breaking into royal barracks.<eos> Now take the watch.<eos> Well.<eos> At least you're not reading.<eos> He wishes to lie with me.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You will be injured<eos> - I don't want to lie with you.
We are but fuel for the fel now.<eos> There is still hope, Blackhand.<eos> Our children.<eos> Do not make me take more innocent lives, young chieftain.<eos> If I submit will you let my people be?<eos> What will I call our son?<eos> Go'el<eos> You.<eos> Where's the older man?<eos> He told me to watch you.
[phone ringing] Dan's Diner.<eos> Dan speaking.<eos> - French toast is up, Bev! - [bell dings]<eos> Denver omelet. Easy on the cheese.<eos> Easy on the cheese-y, coming right up-y!<eos> Dudley!<eos> Sylvester!<eos> Clovis!<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Pee-wee, we need to talk to you about band rehearsal.
When you had Jen, did you enjoy it?<eos> D'you like fucking her?<eos> I'm fucking you now, Nate!<eos> I'm fucking you now, Nate!<eos> Look what you did.<eos> Look what you did!<eos> Now ya had Nate out of the way, didn't ya, Travis?<eos> On your way back to the gas station, you come up with a story.<eos> You and Nate were attacked, the car was totalled, you barely escaped with your life.<eos> Those "Bigfoots" really messed you up.
How to know?<eos> My son was only a boy.<eos> Not like you.<eos> Where was your price?<eos> I had no.<eos> I had no.<eos> We just stop?<eos> We will not kill you all. Or you us.<eos> But Roma will.<eos> Will eliminate you.
- Or you've got problems.<eos> - Who?<eos> Fatty and his sister?<eos> - Hey, Yuri is not a girl.<eos> - Then why is he knitting, 4 eyes?<eos> - Sewing technically.<eos> - Throw it away.<eos> - Now..<eos> How much for a shine, pele?<eos> - Your teacher did this to you? - Uh-huh.
I killed him.<eos> I killed him.<eos> - It's okay, dico.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> - I'm gonna be good now, Mae.<eos> I'm gonna study and do good in school.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Shh! Okay.<eos> "Waldemar de brito, football scout."<eos> I think it's time he'll work with you in the clinic after school.
You're doing what?<eos> Making example.<eos> Making example of what?<eos> These people are traitors.<eos> Maybe now they can grow up and learn a lesson from all this.<eos> What did you fucking say?<eos> They can learn a lesson from this.<eos> Learn something from you?<eos> You little shit? Huh?<eos> What are they gonna fucking learn from you?
Huh? Where are you going?<eos> - Away.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Away?<eos> Wait, listen to me, listen to me.<eos> Whatever you feel about me, whatever is going on, whatever you are thinking, we are here now.<eos> That is it.<eos> This is where we find ourselves.<eos> There is nothing that we can do about this.<eos> I would rather spend a lifetime in a shit hole like this with you than spend one minute in Moscow without you.
Thought what?<eos> That he wasn't fishing with his books?<eos> That he wasn't MGB?<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> He couldn't draw you in if he wasn't doing his job properly.<eos> Listen...<eos> I made you a promise.<eos> Now you don't have to stay with me.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm coming with you.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What do we do?<eos> They'll get through.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Slappy wants me.<eos> That's who he's after.<eos> Listen, if I can lure them away in a bus, they'll follow me.<eos> You'll all be safe.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
Nah, I got the... got the...<eos> Oh, you got the new Bluetooth Oakleys.<eos> Oh, that's exciting.<eos> It is exciting.<eos> But guess who had to pay for them?<eos> Me. Can you believe that?<eos> - Oh, that's so not right.<eos> - Well, it's the principle.<eos> We shouldn't have to pay to do our jobs.<eos> 80% of police authority comes from controlling eye contact like I'm doing here right here with you.
I can't believe this.<eos> This is... - My whole marriage proposal is ruined.<eos> - No, it's not, Scotty.<eos> All right, we're very sorry, sir.<eos> Just bear with us another minute.<eos> Oh, it's too tight.<eos> I mean, it's perfect.<eos> I mean, my finger's too big.<eos> The honeycomb cluster does have large knuckles.<eos> Yes, yes, I will marry you.
And I think I'm in love with you.<eos> I think I'm in love with you, too.<eos> Alice. You were filled with the divine spirit.<eos> You know what?<eos> You touched the magic.<eos> And that ain't easy, believe me.<eos> I have been on many a pulpit. And I have oft...<eos> But you soared.<eos> Couldn't have did it better myself.<eos> Alice, everyone wants to see you. It's so exciting.

And I have oft...<eos> But you soared.<eos> Couldn't have did it better myself.<eos> Alice, everyone wants to see you. It's so exciting.<eos> Congress guy Pam Henry wants to see you, but in a bad, scary way.
- Howard, what are you doing?<eos> Look, it's just kind of a gigantic deal, you know, when you go against your party and all the big bosses who got you here.<eos> So I'm just going to need to take a minute and think about this.<eos> Wait, you can't just leave.<eos> You have to introduce our bill in the new session.<eos> And you've got to be with me and stuff.<eos> Howard, come on. We're a team.<eos> Listen, I am going to be there.<eos> I swear on my life.<eos> Howard, Pam Henry wants to see you, and you better come right now!
What about my injury, Scott?<eos> What about all the people here that I'm trying to help?<eos> Well...<eos> Where is the guy who will just think bigger than just himself?<eos> That's me.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I want to be that guy, Alice, please.<eos> Give me another shot.<eos> I can be that guy.<eos> I want to give you foot massages. I want to take baths with you.
She's gone.<eos> The machine over there?<eos> Uh, my candy's stuck.<eos> It happens sometimes.<eos> Do you have a key or something we can open it up with?<eos> The machine doesn't belong to the hospital.<eos> It's a vending company.<eos> Davis, it's mom and dad.<eos> We tried your cell phone but we...<eos> We can't get a hold of you, and then...
Housework...<eos> Hey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A bulldozer.<eos> You know, you can buy almost anything on ebay.<eos> I just hope it comes with a manual.<eos> Hey... shit.<eos> A manual and a warranty.<eos> She was so young.<eos> Hey, uh... Phil would like to talk to you immediately.
You're in the States?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm in Des Moines.<eos> Where the hell else would I be?<eos> Well, it's good to hear your voice.<eos> Yeah. Hey, Doug told me about this Appalachian Trail deal of yours.<eos> Are you serious about that?<eos> Yes, I'm very serious.<eos> You think maybe I could come with you?
I get enough of that crap at home.<eos> I think you broke my leg.<eos> It's called a shin kick, Spock.<eos> Now, if I ever see you even near that kid, you'll wish the gods above had never let your parents meet.<eos> You should put some ice on that or you'll have a wicked bruise.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Name's Hopkins.<eos> Gilly Hopkins.<eos> Now, don't get any ideas of me liking you or us being buddies or anything like that.<eos> People just got to understand that if anyone's going to be picking on you, it's going to be me.
They trusted their busted up planes.<eos> They liked their battle scars.<eos> We'll fly it tomorrow before going to school.<eos> Battle scar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now go to bed.<eos> Battle scar.<eos> What?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can I sit with you?
And naturally I'd be spending a lot more time with W.E.<eos> Naturally.<eos> It's just the broom, goofy.<eos> Listen, what are you going to do when somebody socks you?<eos> I'm not going to hit you, silly.<eos> Are you going to go through life letting people pick on you?<eos> I'm going to teach you how to fight.<eos> You hear about how I fought six boys at school all by myself?<eos> Well, before I get through with you, you're going to do the same thing.<eos> So, first thing, when somebody yells at you, you got to stand tall.
But you're just fooling yourself if you expect good things to come regular.<eos> Well, if life's so bad, how come you are so happy?<eos> Did I say bad?<eos> I said tough.<eos> There ain't nothing can make you happy like doing good on a tough job.<eos> Trotter, stop preaching to me.<eos> I want to come home.<eos> You have been home, baby.<eos> Your grandma is your home.<eos> No, but I want to be with you and William Ernest and Mr. Randolph.
- Go.<eos> - Getting there.<eos> - Innate there.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Where to?<eos> - What?<eos> I mean, we can either go to the girl that's the closest or we can go to the one that hasn't eaten in a week.<eos> - In a week?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I never could get top dollar from any of those girls like I did for you.
Help.<eos> Help me.<eos> - Come on. Shoot him!<eos> - Help.<eos> Shoot this motherfucker!<eos> It'll be more painful if you just leave him.<eos> Hey!<eos> Why aren't we calling the cops?<eos> I'm sure they were gonna rape me in there.<eos> What's wrong with you?
We can't leave them here. Where are you going?<eos> - We can't stop.<eos> We have to go to the next house.<eos> - Why? Why should we keep going?<eos> Because there are more girls I have to save.<eos> I have to save them.<eos> And I had to save you because I had to try!<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Are you really gonna leave us here?<eos> Eve, what happened to you?
Why are you here?<eos> This isn't your house.<eos> - Why does he know you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> He keeps saying your name all the time.<eos> Eve... I spent six months looking for you.<eos> I lost my job.<eos> I spent everything I had.<eos> I lost my home.<eos> Eve, what happened to you?
Super, super good.<eos> Woody never told me you were coming.<eos> - He never tells me anything.<eos> - Sir, if I may?<eos> - He talked to me.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Because you're not married to him.<eos> Hey, I called you five times last year.<eos> - I was worried about you.
I'll see you at the table.<eos> - Out here.<eos> Out here. - Thank you for the camaraderie.<eos> - "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."<eos> - Coming right up, sir.<eos> Don't stand up, Gilcrest.<eos> - On second thought, do stand up.<eos> - It's good to see you, general.<eos> Is it true you cut a deal with Bumpy for the blessing?<eos> Carson Welch is very impressed with you.
He loves you.<eos> You are bringing a very studly game to Brave Angel.<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> From Carson Welch's people.<eos> It's a gift to give Brave Angel.<eos> - Oh, what is it?<eos> - New codes.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Welcome to your expanded job description.<eos> Carson wants to speak to you.
Now.<eos> Nice work, Gilcrest.<eos> You're back in the bird's nest.<eos> - What are we putting up there, Carson?<eos> - We're doing things... this country was built to do before 20 layers of government...<eos> - ...slowed us down...<eos> - Okay.<eos> ...and let China kick our keisters all over the Pacific.<eos> We are taking command personally.<eos> Yes, I was angry with you about Kabul.
You loving the hat?<eos> I feel silly.<eos> Well, you wear silly well.<eos> I know what you know.<eos> What?<eos> Stop with the games.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I got personal with you.<eos> I never get personal.<eos> - I had fun with you.
Do you mind staying here?<eos> Let me talk to him alone?<eos> - You could have left me in the city.<eos> - I could've... But you would have missed the pretty green shit.<eos> Sentiment.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - John? It's Joe.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Are you gonna open the door?<eos> I'd like to talk to you.
- I use them to find my keys.<eos> - No one likes a smart-ass, son.<eos> Didn't your mother teach you that?<eos> My mom was Irish, so she encouraged my smart-assed-ness.<eos> I've never seen him before.<eos> How about you folks?<eos> You know this man?<eos> No.<eos> He does look familiar.<eos> He kind of looks like you, Dad.
I was fucking way outta line.<eos> Forget about it, Tommy.<eos> You was drunk. I know I was drunk, but that ain't an excuse.<eos> Should never have fuckin' happened.<eos> No, it should never have happened.<eos> But that's the thing. That's...<eos> I want you to listen to me.<eos> - You need to keep an eye on it.<eos> - Yeah. Because, you know, the juice, it'll sneak up and bite you on the ass and you never know when, you know what I mean? Absolutely, absolutely.<eos> And I... I worry about you, that's all.
"He has tested them like gold in a furnace."<eos> "They who trust in Him will understand the truth."<eos> In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> That's a pity that Jimmy couldn't pallbearer with us.<eos> I know, but...<eos> He was just protecting the family name.<eos> He's a...<eos> - Well, he's a good man.<eos> I remember sitting at this very table with you, some 20 years ago, working on my first campaign.
Nothing much.<eos> The usual.<eos> What is the fucking usual?<eos> I don't know the usual.<eos> What's the fucking usual?<eos> You know.<eos> Drugs are bad. Prostitution's illegal.<eos> Shit like that.<eos> And did Stevie and I figure into this conversation at all?<eos> They asked if I was involved with you.
- You keep your voice down.<eos> - Fuck you! Fuck you, keep my voice down.<eos> This is my kitchen.<eos> It's your kitchen.<eos> Don't even fucking start with that, okay?<eos> I'll be in our room.<eos> I'll be in our room with the door locked.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Stevie, what's the matter with you?
You spill the secret family recipe today, maybe you fucking spill about me tomorrow.<eos> Is that something, maybe, that's a possibility?<eos> I was just saying...<eos> You were "just sayin" '?<eos> "Just sayin" ' gets people sent to Allenwood.<eos> "Just sayin"' got me a nine-year stretch in Leavenworth and Alcatraz.<eos> You understand?<eos> So, "just sayin" could get you buried real fucking quick.<eos> Look at his fucking face!<eos> I'm fucking with you.

Where's Dike?<eos> And we who call ourselves men will stay and protect our town.<eos> Who is going to take care of the property we are leaving behind?<eos> Dad, where's Dike?<eos> They fled!<eos> Let me go, it's my duty.<eos> We will be crushed between the rebels and the army!<eos> It is so bad!<eos> We've already decided what to do with the children.<eos> They will go with you.
Keep going. - Go. Keep going.<eos> - Keep going.<eos> - Move, move.<eos> To your left side.<eos> Agu? I don't want that I call you and you just stand there.<eos> Agu?<eos> Come here, I'll give you some brown-brown.<eos> It'll cure everything for you, eh.<eos> Hey, I didn't call you to stand there.<eos> My boy, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
Sun, why are you shining on this world?<eos> I am wanting to catch you in my hands, to squeeze you until you cannot shine no more.<eos> That way, everything is always dark and nobody's ever having to see all the terrible things that are happening here.<eos> Preacher!<eos> Sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Stand up and let's go! We are going.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Stand up and let's go!<eos> What is wrong with you?
So what's up, man?<eos> You ready for Doo-To's?<eos> Is Doo-To's ready for me?<eos> You know that's Compton, right?<eos> They got body bags at the door.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your ass better bring it, 'cause if you don't, you might end up in one for real.<eos> Body bag?<eos> Man, I don't know about that shit.<eos> Ain't nobody fucking with you, Jinx.
It seems as if I could do something for you.<eos> I see. You think because I don't have some flashy office I don't know what I'm talking about?<eos> I worked with Elton John.<eos> I worked with Otis Redding.<eos> Let me see.<eos> I worked with War. I worked with Styx.<eos> Have you worked with anybody this decade?<eos> Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.<eos> A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.<eos> Bravado. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, you think anybody is gonna let you in the building... where somebody might listen to you or talk to you, you think that's gonna happen?
It's my little brother, man.<eos> It's my little baby bro.<eos> Fuckin' Compton, man.<eos> Come on, man, like...<eos> It's my fault, man.<eos> This never would've happened... Don't talk like that. If I had him out here, man.<eos> It's my fuckin' fault.<eos> It coulda happened in another way.<eos> You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.<eos> Tyree gonna always be with you.
It's my fault, man.<eos> This never would've happened... Don't talk like that. If I had him out here, man.<eos> It's my fuckin' fault.<eos> It coulda happened in another way.<eos> You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.<eos> Tyree gonna always be with you.<eos> No matter what.<eos> Yeah. That's right.<eos> Yeah, for real, man.<eos> And we always gon' be with you.
Good night?<eos> No.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Good night, Andre. Nah.<eos> See...<eos> See, I can't help thinking maybe you want me to come inside.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> So, what's different now?<eos> Huh? I got a lot to think about.<eos> You're asking me to move in with you.
I know that you're upset.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I'm asking you...<eos> I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?<eos> I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.<eos> It's fucked up. You can stop giving me advice as of now.<eos> Here's what's about to happen.<eos> I'm gonna get N.W.A. back together, and you ain't gonna have nothin' to do with it this time.<eos> How the fuck can you even say something like that?<eos> What the fuck is going on with you, man?
Tonight or this mornin', whatever the hell it is.<eos> Don, don't screw it up.<eos> - I'll try not to, bub. - Let's roll.<eos> When you are sad and lonely And have no place to go<eos> Come to see me, baby And bring along some dough<eos> And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'<eos> Honky tonkin', honey baby<eos> We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town...<eos> How much you got there, Miss Lillie?<eos> I'm under no obligation to you.
I'd like a hat like that.<eos> How long's it been since Lycrecia saw her daddy?<eos> Well, he's gonna stop by next week when she's at Mom and Dad's.<eos> Oh, my heart is oh so heavy<eos> And these tears<eos> No longer glow<eos> Come on.<eos> Eat-up time.<eos> I'm done dreaming<eos> About you, baby
But it isn't that fine.<eos> The food or the song?<eos> Well, they both need a little ketchup, honey.<eos> Screw you, Hank.<eos> - Come on, Auds.<eos> - You come on.<eos> You always do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> Well, you know...<eos> Like you said that I could sing with you on the program.
Thank you, Miss Warwick.<eos> I ain't coming in again.<eos> I'm pleased to hear that.<eos> - Don.<eos> How are ya?<eos> - Pretty good.<eos> - What, you brought me some candy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My darling valentine not with you?
I'll be in in a sec.<eos> Audrey.<eos> Hank.<eos> I'm goin' to Shreveport for the Hayride.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> Did you get the papers?<eos> Yep.<eos> You get the house money?<eos> Come on, Auds.<eos> You're always, "Come on."
Yep.<eos> You get the house money?<eos> Come on, Auds.<eos> You're always, "Come on."<eos> We're about divorced, in case you didn't know.<eos> It's too hard, this divorce thing.<eos> Well, you should've thought about that a long time ago.<eos> Yeah, I probably should have.<eos> I couldn't see that far.<eos> I couldn't see that fighting with you was better than being apart.
Audrey, why don't you bring him up to Shreveport this weekend?<eos> Well, that won't work out.<eos> Well, why not?<eos> I mean, it'd just be for the Saturday,<eos> You could leave him here and, you know, we'll bring him back.<eos> Well, we got plans Saturday.<eos> Well, how about Sunday, then?<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> We're just gonna have to find a better time, okay?<eos> So, I'm gonna talk to you later.
And that fella got his 17-year-old son,<eos> Charles Carr, to do the job.<eos> Charles was a freshman at Auburn on holiday break.<eos> Can you take care of that for me?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Be careful with that, Charles.<eos> Come here, baby.<eos> I'll call you when I get up to Charleston.<eos> How come I can't come?<eos> Go back to Shreveport, I'll meet you in a couple days.
Hey, where you going?<eos> I got homework.<eos> What? Look at that fridge pile.<eos> Idiot.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Clobbering time.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> Think you can talk to me like that, huh?<eos> You think you can talk to me like that, punk?<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?
He said he'll fix it.<eos> Where is Reed?<eos> Reed's gone.<eos> Your friend isn't coming back.<eos> Look, I know you're scared.<eos> You should be.<eos> But we can help you.<eos> You wanna find a cure?<eos> We have resources here, the best in the world.<eos> We're analyzing what happened to you.
Reed is back.<eos> We're closer than we've ever been before.<eos> Closer to what?<eos> Our old lives.<eos> Oh, you mean your life?<eos> No, son.<eos> You always said I had the potential to do something important.<eos> Who's to say this isn't it?<eos> Sometimes things just happen for a reason.<eos> Johnny, you have no idea what they are planning to do to you.
I need you to breathe, sweetheart.<eos> I need you to breathe.<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> Breathe in. And out.<eos> In.<eos> That's it.<eos> Out.<eos> In. Out.<eos> I've got you, I've got you.<eos> I've got you, sweetheart.
Something is coming together, coming together somehow.<eos> Something bad is gonna happen.<eos> And I don't know what it is.<eos> I feel like something is fighting me to be me.<eos> When I walk and when I talk.<eos> What is wrong with me, Pete?<eos> Ange, listen to me.<eos> If this was me in here, then we'd have something to worry about.<eos> If something happens to me, I need you to be there for me.<eos> Why do you think something's going to happen to you?
Anything at all?<eos> I was just tired.<eos> Angela, you've been complaining about night terrors.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> If you're hearing voices...<eos> You listen to my conversations?<eos> What did Pete tell you?<eos> Your lack of cooperation during these sessions is counterproductive to treatment.<eos> The longer we tiptoe around the real issue, the longer you're going to be here, and I know you don't want that.<eos> I just want to be honest with you.
The longer we tiptoe around the real issue, the longer you're going to be here, and I know you don't want that.<eos> I just want to be honest with you.<eos> Can you be honest with me?<eos> Can you tell me what you said to the detective before he killed himself?<eos> No?<eos> It says here when you walked into the maternity ward, going off the reading of your lips, you said that the babies were in your father's house.<eos> What does that mean, "in your father's house"?<eos> Angela, I want to be honest with you.<eos> Can you be honest with me?<eos> I can't be honest with you.
- Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Look at that.<eos> The boys are bonding already.<eos> Isn't this the best?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you remember, back when you were just getting your pilot's license... and you and I would sit there... and we'd talk about all those, like, overseas trips we would take and stuff?<eos> Yeah, of course that's when I thought I was gonna fly for one of the big guys.<eos> I know it's not the most glamorous airline, but Econo Air... it's been pretty good to us.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, right here with you and the boys, this is paradise.

Anyway, you guys look disgusting.<eos> I have some clothes I was gonna give to the church... if you guys wanna borrow some of those. - Great.<eos> Thank you, Audrey.<eos> - Yeah. - Come on inside.<eos> - All right. Boy, y'all stink.<eos> Oh, I don't like that.<eos> Man, this place makes our house look like shit.<eos> Well, Kevin, that's only because a dollar goes much further out here than it does in Chicago.<eos> Especially when you make a lot more of them, heh.<eos> Just messing with you.
- I remember that night.<eos> - I'll never forget that night.<eos> - Neither will I, baby.<eos> You're my fucking husband.<eos> Oh, betcha, I am.<eos> I'm your caveman.<eos> I'll rip you in half.<eos> I wanna have all your babies.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> I hit the fucking jackpot with you.
Good.<eos> - So your ex is calling, huh?<eos> - Yeah. What a treat for the kids.<eos> It's been a long time. - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. We're watching a really funny movie with Mommy and Brad.<eos> Brad is Mommy's new husband.<eos> Wait. He doesn't know about me?<eos> Well, I haven't talked to him in six months.<eos> We've been married eight months.<eos> Brad, Daddy wants to talk to you.
Wait. Prince Hans is actually the bad guy?<eos> Man, I didn't see that coming at all.<eos> He seemed like he really loved Anna.<eos> I hate Prince Hans. Dusty.<eos> Hey, how you feeling, Sparky?<eos> Sparky. That's hilarious.<eos> Brad, have you seen this movie?<eos> It's unbelievable, man. There's these two sisters, one of them has ice powers.<eos> Yeah, I'm familiar with Frozen.<eos> Listen, Dusty, I need to talk to you now.
Can we open presents?<eos> You sure can, little girl.<eos> I think they're from Brad.<eos> In fact, all the presents are from Brad.<eos> Let's see if any of the presents are from Dusty.<eos> Nope. Not one present from Dusty.<eos> All from Brad.<eos> Hey, kids, let's not forget who got you a dog. Remember?<eos> Hey, Tumor, quit humping Mrs. Claus!<eos> Okay, I am officially worried about you.
A lot of people are in bad shape, all burnt up.<eos> A lot of people getting really drunk.<eos> Others are going crazy looking for alcohol and drugs because they ran out.<eos> When did the bruises first appear, Rob?<eos> They shot all the migrants.<eos> That's when I ran.<eos> They just lined them up and shot 'em.<eos> Everybody's going crazy and...<eos> That's why I came here.<eos> I was so worried about you, Rob.
And he wasn't afraid to let anyone know when and where the bull had gone number two.<eos> But then a tragedy happened to Mark, and it turned his world view dark and ready to believe the whole system was a lie.<eos> Hold on. It's Cynthia.<eos> I'll be in the office in 20 minutes.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> The therapist called.<eos> You did it again.<eos> There were no cabs.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> I worry about you, Mark.
-Why?<eos> You think more people will come?<eos> I mean, if more people are coming, then we should definitely keep the church.<eos> - No.<eos> -I know you don't -think it's important, but--<eos> -No, no, no, I--<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Faro.<eos> Faro.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Not everybody does.<eos> You have to.<eos> It's the only way you'll survive.<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Well, it sure looks like a wheel.<eos> John, it's amazing.<eos> It's gonna work.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, um... I wanted to talk to you about something. Come here.
English.<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> You swore, no fighting at dinner.<eos> Jupiter, what is the money for?<eos> No, you're right.<eos> It's nothing I need.<eos> Hey, what was that about?<eos> You're not having second thoughts, are you?<eos> What if I am?<eos> Jupiter... These people, they're counting on you.
I know I haven't lived as long and rich a life as you, but I do know that there is more to it than a parade of stewardesses marching to the dulcet tones of Moonlight Sonata.<eos> Now what in the world do you know about stewardesses anyway?<eos> I wasn't born a priest.<eos> Let's do some work.<eos> I know you think it's dull, but let's start at the beginning.<eos> It goes without saying, but you've served with great distinction.<eos> If I may, when I meet Kaulder tomorrow, I should play it cool, right?<eos> No coffee until after the ritual.<eos> Don't worry about your style.<eos> He'll take the piss out of you anyway.
We'll take it.<eos> I knew you'd love it.<eos> I guess that's why you show it last.<eos> - Shall we, uh... take care of a little paperwork? - Absolutely. OK.<eos> - Signature there. - Mm-hm.<eos> And initial right there.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - That'll do it. Thanks, Elliot.<eos> It's just like your stupid molecualr math books, man.<eos> There's a-a formula. You gotta engage and then you ignore. - They come right to you.
Just one oversight, like that, one leak... and the whole thing rots.<eos> OK.<eos> Just don't be lazy, Doug.<eos> Anything worth doing's worth doing all the way.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I gotta go out of town again tonight.<eos> I'm workin' on a deal for a micro-brewery.<eos> You travel a lot.<eos> You know why I'm givin' you a hard time, Dougie?
If you... promise me it'll be OK, I'll call them.<eos> It's too risky to try handling this myself, right?<eos> Doug, what do I do?<eos> Oh, your pulse, it's racing.<eos> We just have to think straight, alright?<eos> We gotta stay calm.<eos> The most important thing, right now, is to act normal. That means I go to work, I go home, I come back later.<eos> Don't talk to anyone. Don't touch him.<eos> Don't do anything.<eos> When I get back, we'll figure this out, OK? What's wrong with you tonight, man? She cut you off, or something?
But my way is a better way, for everyone.<eos> See, that's why I love livin' out here.<eos> This is the Emerald City, and I am the fella behind the curtains... yankin' them levers. Keepin' everybody happy, and safe.<eos> But the city is creepin' into our backyard.<eos> Dougie, I've known your family a long time.<eos> So if you have anything you need to say...<eos> I'd be a good person for you to say it to.<eos> Dougie, I'm runnin' out of levers. I...<eos> Ex-excuse me, one second.<eos> - Hello? - Your mom and I need to talk to you.
Something like this. Yes.<eos> You?<eos> New York.<eos> Almost forgot.<eos> Got something for you.<eos> You know what my mission is?<eos> Same as mine was.<eos> Kill me if necessary...<eos> To get that.<eos> Absolutely hated working with you, peril.
To live this year as though it were my last.<eos> Ah, you never know...<eos> It could be, at our age...<eos> So hell, ya!<eos> Let's live.<eos> - Beware, bachelor at 3 o'clock getting a starve up.<eos> - Hmm!<eos> What's he like?<eos> Brown hair, icy blue, smithereens...<eos> Coming in with you. You always come hit on by babies.
Yes, that's right. But if you wanna make a real difference in this world it's a... It's a lot harder than it seems.<eos> What about you, Jenny?<eos> I... own a dog...<eos> OK.<eos> I should be getting back.<eos> But we're having lunch.<eos> It's too late, Ellis.<eos> I only got an hour.<eos> OK.<eos> Let me at least walk you back.
OK.<eos> Can I drive?<eos> You know you rarely see a Saab at the Daytona 500.<eos> There's a reason for that<eos> You might wanna consider an occasional tap on that square pedal by your foot.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Gaw...wowow!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Come on, smile Hester, with teeth.<eos> What you doing Saturday?<eos> - Now grab her tit.<eos> Shit!<eos> - Damn it!<eos> - Relax, Dane can handle himself.<eos> - Who are these two punks?<eos> I don't want a 50, I need an ounce.<eos> That's too much, I don't carry that.<eos> What's wrong with you?
My fight is not about marriage, it's about equality.<eos> It's about a cop getting the benefits she deserv...<eos> Not about marriage, are you kidding me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just, I'm very passionate about this.<eos> If you were married, and not this bullshit, second-class citizen domestic partner crap, but married, there wouldn't be an issue.<eos> Stacie would be entitled to your benefits.<eos> Hell, if you and I got married tomorrow, I'd be entitled to your benefits.<eos> - Is that a proposal?<eos> - Oh, honey, I will marry you.
No. But you're...<eos> You're hardly back from the last trip.<eos> Do you have to go?<eos> It's just a few months, my darling.<eos> What would you like me to bring you home from abroad?<eos> You know, your sisters... Stepsisters, have asked for parasols and lace.<eos> What will you have?<eos> Bring me the first branch your shoulder brushes on your journey.<eos> That's a curious request.<eos> Well, you'll have to take it with you on your way and think of me when you look at it.
If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver.<eos> Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.<eos> On foot?<eos> It'll be winter before we get there. Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses.<eos> Ain't no posts that far over!<eos> Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake.<eos> The Ree ain't that stupid.<eos> We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak.<eos> Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.<eos> Ain't nobody talking to you.
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.<eos> Kind of a miracle.<eos> Shut up, Fitzgerald.<eos> Is that what you did?<eos> Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Why?<eos> Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?<eos> Did he kill her?<eos> Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you.
No horses... just what we agreed.<eos> Take all the pelts you want.<eos> We need horses and rifles.<eos> I need a woman with big tits... Who can cook.<eos> We can't give you any horses.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> I don't know, something about horses.<eos> Bring us something to drink... some whisky.<eos> Tell him to stop asking about the horses.<eos> Always good doing business with you.
Do you believe her?<eos> Do you believe the things Lucie tells you about her monsters?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's the plan for today?<eos> Well, I'm gonna need your rooms cleaned before anyone goes anywhere.<eos> I'm supposed to pick up Kim in an hour.<eos> Well, I just looked in your room.<eos> You better call and tell her you're gonna be late, real late.<eos> No.<eos> - I thought Katy broke up with you.
Are you twerking?<eos> What's that?<eos> This is just getting weird now.<eos> Look out. Okay.<eos> It's a little weird now.<eos> - Yeah. - Okay, I think-<eos> - I think we're good.<eos> We're- - No?<eos> You're...<eos> Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you, Toby.
- Hey. - What the hell?<eos> - You embarrassed?<eos> - Now you know how it feels. - Whoa, who let her in?<eos> - Wes?<eos> - Whoa, Bianca, what the hell is this?<eos> Kind of looks like a penis, only smaller.<eos> Wes?<eos> Wow, boys' locker room.<eos> Nice.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
Watch this.<eos> Did you see the way that guy looked at you?<eos> - This part's the best. - Definitely not.<eos> Wait, just look at your face.<eos> Oh, don't worry, it's a working title.<eos> You know, I was thinking maybe "retail slut" or just "slut whore."<eos> You thought the first video was bad.<eos> Boy, this one's gonna destroy you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Oh, I think it's adorable that Wesley indulged you in a pity make-out.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm not surprised, because it was a piece of shit. And so are you.<eos> Have a nice night.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Wes, it's Bianca.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> It's my voice mail.<eos> Wes, it's Bianca.<eos> So it turns out that Toby's been DUFFing me the whole time.<eos> And I've just been thinking about some stuff, and I just... I'd really like to talk to you, okay?
and have the perfect evening.<eos> Come Monday morning, it's back to reality.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm happy to sit this one out.<eos> I didn't regret hitting "send," but I did regret how I left things with Jess and Casey.<eos> So all of this because of some word?<eos> It didn't feel like just some word to me.<eos> I think deep down I've always known you guys were prettier than me, and I felt like I couldn't talk to you about it because you wouldn't understand what it felt like to be your schlumpy friend.<eos> But, you know, you're wrong, because we all have our insecurities.<eos> The point is, we're a team.<eos> If anything, we're kind of chumps in comparison to you.
No, I'm not having sex.<eos> And not because I haven't wanted to.<eos> Because, I don't know if you know this... but pregnant women can get very horny.<eos> Problem is, nobody wants to have sex with me.<eos> I'd have sex with you.<eos> Where are you headed with this?<eos> Are you gonna tell me you love me and want me back again?<eos> Who's talking about love?<eos> I'm talking about sex.<eos> I'm saying that I would have sex with you right now if you really need it.
Are you serious?<eos> So did we.<eos> - Did he get you pregnant also?<eos> - Not that I know of.<eos> You better check because, apparently, he has very strong swimmers.<eos> Okay, um, I will go to the gyno today.<eos> What time did you guys have sex?<eos> Like 6 a.m. Why?<eos> Okay, so you're fine.<eos> The reason why I wanted to talk to you today...
- Not even a little. You know, we've met before.<eos> - We have?<eos> - Yeah. West Wing.<eos> - Did you do an episode?<eos> - No, I got cast in the pilot.<eos> And then replaced after the table read. - Huh.<eos> Well, you missed a pretty good run.<eos> Uh, any notes before I get started? Nope.<eos> No notes, Johnny.<eos> Whenever you're ready, Sarah will read with you.
Really?<eos> Johnny, what the hell is going on?<eos> Nothing, doc.<eos> All good.<eos> I'm having a baby.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You have a brand-new baby girl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She's amazing.<eos> She looks just like you.
Seven years, you come back here, like some random act of violence.<eos> - You point a fuckin' gun at me?<eos> - Police procedure, pal.<eos> - Fine.<eos> OK.<eos> - No family discounts.<eos> Hey, you sure you got the right guy, lawman?<eos> Really?<eos> No.<eos> When you left, I was worried sick about you.
She's out in the bush.<eos> - Michelle needed a workspace, so...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She was a photojournalist, from the east coast.<eos> She, uh... fell in love with the wildlife, became a biologist, a researcher...<eos> - Now, she's out on the trail, almost every day.<eos> - This her, here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Conservationist, huh?<eos> How'd you get her to marry you?
- I'm just tellin' ya.<eos> - And I'm hearin' ya.<eos> Sully, call me after you find the next body, 'cause you will find it.<eos> Beckett!<eos> When you're out there... and you see that, listen to me... and you see that bear, you kill it.<eos> Now go up there, find your wife and get her the hell outta there.<eos> I'll close down the trails.<eos> Go on.<eos> Hey, Beckett.<eos> I'm comin' with you.
Hey!<eos> Guys, come on!<eos> Are you done, yet?<eos> !<eos> What're you, fucking twelve?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Johnny was supposed to be back five days ago.<eos> Took poachers into the maze, never came back.<eos> Mary called me.<eos> Didn't wanna come to you.
It's OK.<eos> She'll walk.<eos> Assuming I can keep it from getting infected.<eos> So, you're a doctor, now... huh?<eos> That's funny, I... always figured you'd leave this place.<eos> I am.<eos> In two weeks.<eos> Toronto.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you know how many times I tried to contact you?
In two weeks.<eos> Toronto.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you know how many times I tried to contact you?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some answers.<eos> Stick to what you believe.<eos> It's as good a story as any.<eos> I once had my whole life planned out, with you, in my head.
That was Elsa<eos> But let me tell you, Eberle, she won't talk back any time soon<eos> Elsa?<eos> - Elsa? - Leave me alone<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't want you to see me like this<eos> What about Erich?<eos> He'll get drunk at the pub The children are asleep<eos> You<eos> It's different with you
I'm pregnant again<eos> Don't The children mustn't find out They talk a lot at home<eos> I think it's your child<eos> But I haven't always been able to fend off Erich<eos> I prayed for the Lord to take the child, regardless of whether it's yours or his<eos> You mustn't say that, Elsa<eos> Who will feed the child?<eos> Why can't they let us be how we want?<eos> You have to get a divorce<eos> Am I supposed to move in with you, now that they're taking your home?
And it's decided?<eos> It's just for a short while<eos> I love you, Georgie, but I have no choice<eos> I can take a lot, but the children are hungry<eos> I'd give you money, but I need it for Munich<eos> Elsa, wait for me.<eos> Be faithful to me<eos> I've got something planned<eos> I can't tell you what, but it's vital, and it'll be fine<eos> I want to marry you when it's all over
Fiona, you live like three floors up. I mean-<eos> If you don't control your bloody dog, I'll have it sent to Battersea Dogs' Home.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Come on Dennis, let's go and evacuate your bowels.<eos> Come on, Dennis.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Hello, Neil.<eos> - Oh hi, Catherine.<eos> It's funny, I was just dreaming about you.
-See you soon, man.<eos> -All right. See ya.<eos> Litterbugs.<eos> Come on.<eos> Biotine?<eos> How'd you get way out here?<eos> Well, Peter Morris, finders keepers.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Yeah, I think she's already found one.<eos> Come on, let's grab a bite.<eos> Come on, Cash.<eos> Do you want to hang out or bang out?<eos> Liz, hey.<eos> Sit up for a sec.<eos> I'm gonna go out for waffles, but I'll bring you a short stack.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I'll bring you waffles.<eos> Has anyone around here told you about homecoming?
You know that, right?<eos> I know.<eos> Choke me.<eos> Now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't... I just...<eos> I don't really feel like that now.<eos> Hey. I don't want you to do anything that you don't want to do.<eos> Come here. Come back.<eos> I just feel at home with you, so...
There was just silence.<eos> Lana, can I talk to you?<eos> Hey.<eos> - I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> Can I please just...<eos> Please? Talk to Roger if you need someone to talk to.<eos> Well, he's not answering my calls either.<eos> Please? I feel like I'm about to go underwater, okay?<eos> Can I just... please talk to you...
Please? Talk to Roger if you need someone to talk to.<eos> Well, he's not answering my calls either.<eos> Please? I feel like I'm about to go underwater, okay?<eos> Can I just... please talk to you...<eos> Please?<eos> You're the only person that's made me feel okay about myself in my entire adult life and I feel like I know you.<eos> From the first second I met you, I felt that.<eos> I know it feels that way,<eos> - but maybe that's not a good thing.<eos> - Why? Because you're gonna take me down with you. It's just who you are.
Excuse me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You need to walk away.<eos> He has a lawyer in the building.<eos> - He hasn't made any calls.<eos> - He has friends here, remember?<eos> Look, I just need a few more minutes.<eos> No, that won't be necessary.<eos> Mr. marzin has been a very good friend to this office.<eos> I thought I made that clear to you.
You?<eos> Well, she was, um-- she was great, actually.<eos> She was kind of a Saint.<eos> There was just one thing about her that neither one of us could fix.<eos> What was that?<eos> She wasn't you.<eos> Well, you always were a little slow.<eos> Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.<eos> How's that?<eos> Why didn't you ask me to come with you?
You got it!<eos> Well, that was...<eos> That was double scary, right?<eos> Triple and quadruple.<eos> We're going to have to amputate them.<eos> What?<eos> - Feels better, right?<eos> But it happened that after walking a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the Fox appeared.<eos> Hey! Come play with me.<eos> I cannot play with you.
Give me a little credit, will ya?<eos> Sophie?<eos> Okay.<eos> What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to?<eos> I would have called him.<eos> For sure as shit, I would have called him.<eos> Maybe my whole life would have turned out different.<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't...<eos> You're too hard on yourself, kid.
Mommy called you.<eos> And you're home early.<eos> Hope, your favorite flower is a...<eos> Rose.<eos> To smell it, you breathe through your...<eos> Keep it in, long as you can go.<eos> Then let it out in one big... --Blow.<eos> -Hi, honey.<eos> -Hey, baby.<eos> Speak to you outside for a second?
Here he comes.<eos> Speaking of old shit.<eos> Watch this.<eos> Hey, Billy, why you leaving so soon?<eos> Come on, baby, let's go.<eos> I hope you're not taking everything personal.<eos> I'm just trying to sell a fight.<eos> - Get the fuck off me, man.<eos> - Don't give him any press.<eos> What, I got to fuck your bitch to talk to you?
Lei.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> Here.<eos> - What the fuck are you doing here, man?<eos> - Where you been, Billy?<eos> We been trying to get in touch with you.<eos> Please, please, can you just talk to me for a second?<eos> - Please, let me, let me go with you.
Come on, baby.<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you fucking crazy?<eos> Mommy's got you.<eos> I've got kids.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, I need a hit, though.<eos> Yo, you got a hit?<eos> Hey! I'm fucking talking to you!
Who is he?<eos> - Miguel Escobar.<eos> - Are you working with him, too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Billy, you know if it makes money, it makes sense.<eos> - Oh, you...<eos> - It's just business, Billy.<eos> I know you miss Maureen.<eos> I miss Maureen, too, man.<eos> Shit, if she was here, she'd be disgusted with you, man.
- I will find you in contempt.<eos> Please, please, I don't want to...<eos> - I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> - My last warning.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Please, Daddy!<eos> - Billy!<eos> Come on!<eos> Billy! - Take the child out, please.<eos> Please, I want to stay with you!
Let me just give my daughter a hug!<eos> No, no, no...<eos> Daddy!<eos> Please!<eos> - He wants to see his daughter!<eos> - Please, Dad...<eos> - Daddy!<eos> - That's not necessary.<eos> No!<eos> I want to live with you!
No, Billy.<eos> You know, I-I can't really pay you right now.<eos> Well, fuck you.<eos> No, I don't want to get paid.<eos> No, I was never here for money, you know that.<eos> Never.<eos> I'm sorry, Billy.<eos> - This the place?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You, uh, you want me to come with you?
Jaywalking.<eos> You all right?<eos> How's your eye?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - How's your eye?<eos> - Now you're being smart.<eos> No, seriously, what's up with your eye?<eos> What is that?<eos> Evil blue-eyed devil just took it from me.<eos> You know, the thing with you is that, like, sometimes one eye is, like, cloudy, right?
Yeah.<eos> I got to make some money, man.<eos> I can't lose my girl.<eos> This man right here... You fell down to the ground, he just stepped right over you.<eos> He fixes fights.<eos> He's a liar.<eos> Yeah, look, I'm not talking about him.<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> I can't do this without you.<eos> I can't do this with you.
But I have to be there.<eos> Okay, you got a deal, baby.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You're stronger than that.<eos> They say Billy Hope can't make it.<eos> They say Billy Hope is over.<eos> You!<eos> You define yourself.<eos> I want you to switch and go southpaw.<eos> Have the foot move through with you.
Aw, baby, you're so brave.<eos> You guys take care of each other.<eos> I love you, Daddy.<eos> Yeah, baby.<eos> Your mother would be so proud of you.<eos> Let's just go home, okay?<eos> Just go home, okay?<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> I was so worried for you.
In the name of the freakiest thing alive, I baptize you, "Little Boy."<eos> - - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is my husband dead or alive?<eos> Wedon'tknow,ma'am. His body wasn't located at the scene.<eos> Webelievehe 'sbeentaken as a prisoner of war.<eos> Goodluck getting out.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> He's barely eaten all week.<eos> Just take him, would you?
Especially London.<eos> Okay, let's hang out.<eos> Go ahead, I'll meet you inside.<eos> No, no.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> Come.<eos> What can I get you?<eos> I'll have a chocolate sundae with--<eos> Hey, I ain't talking to you, Nip.
Give it back.<eos> Please?<eos> You fat motherless pig!<eos> Ugh!<eos> Freddy, Freddy, Freddy!<eos> This'll teach you to never mess with me.<eos> Freddy,Freddy,Freddy!<eos> Freddy,Freddy, Freddy, Freddy...<eos> Freddy, Freddy!<eos> I'm finishing you this time.
I figured it out!<eos> Hashimoto!<eos> Japan is practically straight in front of us.<eos> Now if you point to where the sun touches the sea, you'd be pointing directly at Japan.<eos> - Why the sudden interest?<eos> - I need to end the war.<eos> My dad can't come back until it's over.<eos> You mean doing this?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right, maybe it's time I'm honest with you.
We're playing you B-squad bitches today.<eos> I'll probably go yard at least twice and chicks dig the long ball.<eos> Hell, I'll probably go three times if Coach puts in that bitch, Parminder.<eos> I'm sitting right here.<eos> Hey, Petra.<eos> I hear you're going to the vamp party tonight.<eos> I've always wanted to go to a vamp party.<eos> That's because you're a total wampire, Leonard.<eos> Am not.<eos> Can I come with you?
- Well, whatever.<eos> We're on an understanding plane.<eos> - Look at that.<eos> Look at that. - It's like an ice skating rink.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I'm getting trails.<eos> Mom, is there anything else you wanted to talk about?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> We wanted to talk to you about some of the changes that happen to your body as you get older.
Why would you do that?<eos> You know, I used to worry about everything, you know?<eos> Getting straight A's, my dad.<eos> Now I just slow my roll, you know?<eos> You just threw it all away to space out?<eos> That's weak.<eos> It's funny.<eos> We haven't talked in years.<eos> Suddenly he gives a shit that I'm a zombie.<eos> What was I supposed to do, spend all of high school with you playing Minecraft and hacking the school's servers?
The world's first proper, full artificial intelligence.<eos> This is a computer system that might be smarter than a human.<eos> I could show it a piece of art... and this thing, this being, could judge that art.<eos> It could decide if it liked it.<eos> It could write music and poetry.<eos> Okay. Stop.<eos> Please, Deon.<eos> Do you realize you just came... to the CEO of a publicly traded weapons corporation... and pitched a robot that can write poems?<eos> Well, if you just let me explain...<eos> Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you.
He was just teaching him to paint!<eos> He was just teaching Chappie!<eos> - Yeah, to be a poes!<eos> - He's mine!<eos> I'll call the police on you for mistreating him!<eos> And tell them what?<eos> You stole a police robot!<eos> You're a filthy person.<eos> You're a terrible, shitty person.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Come here, Chappie!<eos> - Come here!<eos> - Leave the car.<eos> Thief!<eos> Thief!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You thief!<eos> - Get in.<eos> - But I got the car!<eos> What's the matter with you?
Wait here.<eos> I'm gonna get the bad man from the van!<eos> You godless freak! Godless!<eos> You killed Mommy!<eos> You hurt my peoples!<eos> Why? !<eos> No.<eos> You don't use guns.<eos> I'm gonna crush you, bad man!<eos> I'm gonna crush you for hurting my mommy!
Nice for some.<eos> Mine think about it all the time.<eos> Comes with working for a living.<eos> - They're street traders.<eos> - But not deserters.<eos> It's called Absent Without Leave, Lieutenant.<eos> AWOL. Same thing, isn't it?<eos> It will be if I don't get on parade at 8:00 tomorrow morning.<eos> Why?<eos> What will they do to you? A lot.
We aren't letting you out of our sight for a second, not this time.<eos> Pryce, you may be a captain, but I'm a princess.<eos> And where is your cap?<eos> I will not be seen with an officer out of uniform.<eos> Lillibet.<eos> Margaret.<eos> Bloody princess.<eos> Just my sodding luck.<eos> You said you were going to see your mum.<eos> Can we come with you?
You figured it out.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Let me guess. You're gonna try and smear me with my record, destroy my credibility?<eos> You really think that's gonna work?<eos> But it won't come to that.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told you that coffee was strong.<eos> We better get you home.<eos> Hey... she's awake.<eos> Now, before you drift back off, I think you'll be happy to know that the suicide note that I typed up for you, very touching.
Nah, 800's too easy.<eos> Let's do a mile.<eos> Payne's getting bolder.<eos> I can't protect you.<eos> The FBI thinks Bob Lee's dead.<eos> There's no threat to you, according to the official narrative.<eos> But according to your narrative?<eos> You heard about the Russian killings?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Bob Lee survived, it was great for you, but bad for everyone who set him up.

We deal in lead.<eos> Grow up.<eos> You know, I always thought I'd die in a gun fight.<eos> You were half right.<eos> In another world, I would've shot you the minute I saw you.<eos> But these guys have a van-load of bad shit, and they're planning on using it.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> So why don't you untie me and let me help?<eos> Oh, sorry, Captain.<eos> Call me crazy, but I don't trust you.
- Yeah.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Hey. - Thank you.<eos> Are you Mr. Jones?<eos> Uh, I am, yeah, sir.<eos> You loaded Wakefield's bullets in his thousand-yard bull's-eye at the Missoula Nationals, right?<eos> Yeah, that was some damn fine shooting.<eos> It sure was, man, but it was your bullets that gave him the edge.<eos> He should split his winnings with you.<eos> What can I do you for?
Just so we're clear, if you go down this path, you're putting everything that we do here at risk.<eos> Things will never be the same.<eos> Just find my mother and bring her back.<eos> Abe.<eos> You're really doing this.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Has he said anything about Robert Oz?<eos> No. And I won't.<eos> Even if Robert Oz was still alive, what use would I have for a lunatic who can't even get a job teaching high school biology?<eos> We have it on good authority that that lunatic is working for you.
Which is not good because planes and ice don't really mix well.<eos> Is it alive?<eos> Barely.<eos> If this thing dies, the cure dies with it.<eos> This is the venom of the inland taipan.<eos> Deadliest snake in the world.<eos> You are going to tell us what we want to know, or I am going to inject you with it.<eos> Once it enters your bloodstream, it will feel like every nerve in your body is firing at once.<eos> This pain will only end with antivenom... or your death.<eos> If I were you, I'd start talking, General.
Hey, Max. Oh.<eos> You forgot your fish.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I'm glad I met you.<eos> You are?<eos> Why's that?<eos> I don't know, I guess for the first time I feel like<eos> I understand why Mitch is so... irritating.<eos> Because I... married his girlfriend?<eos> And just having you as a father.
Jackson's here.<eos> Jackson!<eos> Jackson? !<eos> Jackson!<eos> Jackson.<eos> Get your hands up.<eos> Where is your friend going?<eos> Tell us who sent you!<eos> Tell us who sent you!<eos> I'd tell him if I were you.
He wants you to replace him, be an incubator.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> In theory.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> I got to run some tests.<eos> This means he's not planning on coming back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> Thanks to you, we finally know what Jackson has been up to.
Is that possible?<eos> In theory.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> I got to run some tests.<eos> This means he's not planning on coming back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> Thanks to you, we finally know what Jackson has been up to.<eos> And thanks to you, we know where to find him.
Who are you?<eos> Not important.<eos> Ah, very well, Not Important.<eos> Can you bring me my bag?<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> It's for Jackson.<eos> His brain chemistry's betraying him.<eos> He doesn't have control.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> Trust you?
And I did.<eos> The planes are doing exactly what they're meant to do.<eos> You did this?<eos> We just released the cure!<eos> What are...?<eos> That gas is gonna kill all the animals, Mansdale.<eos> And Clem.<eos> What have you done?<eos> ! It makes no sense!<eos> It'll all be clear to you, to the entire world, very soon.
Here you go.<eos> - Thank you, miss.<eos> - Thank you. Maybe he wants to kill all 97 people on board instead of just the 36?<eos> Make a bad thing worse?<eos> Whatever it is, we find him first, fast as we can.<eos> And if we do find him?<eos> Leave that to me.<eos> It might be the '30s, but Jersey's Jersey.<eos> You see Flynn?<eos> Um, everyone's staring at you.
Someone help!<eos> Sir, do you need help?<eos> Here, here. Go get that little girl!<eos> Here you go.<eos> It's time we talked.<eos> You need to understand who and what you're dealing with.<eos> I understand that you're a psychopath trying to burn everything to the ground.<eos> Well, that depends on your point of view, Lucy.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I know everything about you.
Ple... plea...<eos> Come on.<eos> Kate, come...<eos> Kate, come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> The "Hindenburg" exploded early morning May the 7th, 1937.<eos> It was bombed by the Anarchist Black Cross.<eos> There were only two casualties.<eos> Journalist Kate Drummond and the man whose body was unable to be identified.<eos> Okay, so... so to you, this is what's in the books?
Thanks.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Stop all that banging, i heard you the first time, banging on the door.<eos> Who the hell is...<eos> My name is Randall peasing.<eos> I'm your biological son.<eos> 36 years ago you left me at the front door...<eos> No, hold on, just let me say this.<eos> 36 years ago you left me at the front door of a fire station.<eos> Now, don't worry, I'm not here because I want anything from you.
No, hold on, just let me say this.<eos> 36 years ago you left me at the front door of a fire station.<eos> Now, don't worry, I'm not here because I want anything from you.<eos> I was raised by two incredible parents, I have a lights out family of my own, and...<eos> That car you see parked out in front of your house?<eos> Cost $143,000 and i bought it for cash.<eos> I bought it for cash because I felt like it, and because I can do stuff like that.<eos> Yeah, you see, I turned out pretty all right.<eos> Which might surprise a lot of folks considering the fact that 36 years ago my life started with you leaving me on a fire station doorstep with nothing more than a ratty blanket and a crap-filled diaper.<eos> I came here today so i could look you in the eye, say that to you, and then get back in my fancy-ass car and finally prove to myself, and to you, and to my family who loves me, that I didn't need a thing from you, even after I knew who you were.

SATs are down to 88.<eos> I've got it. Will you move?<eos> Polly, I'm sorry.<eos> There you go.<eos> How is he?<eos> Superficial facial lacerations.<eos> But right leg, though.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Please, go help my wife.<eos> She's asking for you, too.
Thank you.<eos> While we were in there, you had a sudden dissection in your aorta, which, um, well, I'm glad we caught it in time.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> I don't know. I... I guess, like... like I fell out of the sky in a plane I never wanted to be in.<eos> - Don't tell Danny I said that.<eos> - No.<eos> He'll feel so bad. I know him.<eos> He's eating himself alive over this.<eos> Can I see him?<eos> Yeah. I'll find him for you.
I can't face her. I can't go in.<eos> You have to.<eos> You're the only one she needs right now.<eos> She was on the plane because of me.<eos> And now she's off and she's alive.<eos> Your wife is alive.<eos> And if there's anyone who could tell her this isn't the end, that this isn't the worst thing that could've happened, it's you.<eos> Because this isn't the worst thing.<eos> She's still breathing.<eos> She needs you right now.
I don't think so.<eos> Wait, is he wearing a gorilla mask?<eos> You didn't... see anything weird this morning, did you, Mr. Brotzman?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> M-Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you aware you just gave every possible response to that question?<eos> Eyebrows.<eos> If I were you, I wouldn't leave town.
- Well, how could you--<eos> - You told us how. You left us a map.<eos> Well, I suppose you will leave us a map.<eos> Actually, you did a rather unnecessarily complicated bit with a map, to a map, to a map, in a maze that was a bit, what's the word...<eos> "killy"?<eos> And you are...<eos> You are not paying attention.<eos> You have stopped listening.<eos> Right.<eos> You know, we've put our lives at risk for you, against an army of body-swapping psychos, the least you could do is--
We forgot the time machine at the zoo, at their temple... thing.<eos> How could you be so stupid? Hey! Man!<eos> You just killed yourself!<eos> After everything you've done, you don't get to tell us how stupid we are.<eos> I'm over it! I'm over this!<eos> How do you not understand?<eos> You don't win! This is how it ended.<eos> You don't use the time machine again for anything except to go back home.<eos> "How could you know that?" 'Cause it's obvious!<eos> We just watched an older version of you die in that hotel room!
Where is Lydia Spring?<eos> Do you have the other machine?<eos> - What other machine?<eos> - That's the wrong answer.<eos> Where is Lydia!<eos> Lydia's gone.<eos> What do we need to do to get her back?<eos> We're gonna find you, Miss Black.<eos> You do not want to find me.<eos> Your boss had something that we need, and before he died, he was gonna hand it over like a good little idiot, but now it's on you!
John Dollow.<eos> He's-- was Patrick's Lawyer.<eos> You've never met him.<eos> Yes, he seems like someone I've never met.<eos> John Dollow, this is Dirk Gently.<eos> Ooh, isn't that, um... interesting.<eos> I get that a lot.<eos> Well, uh, take a moment, then come and find me.<eos> I'll be in Mr. Spring's office.<eos> I have something for you.
Or you're gonna die, and then I'm gonna kill all them.<eos> Or I'm gonna kill some of them, and then you get killed, and then I kill the rest.<eos> No matter what happens, I want you to know that that's the way it's meant to be.<eos> W-what about you, Bart,<eos> - you'll be fine no matter what?<eos> I don't get hurt.<eos> I do think I'm gonna miss you, though.<eos> Help me!<eos> I've been going through Mr. Spring's effects, and executing his final wishes according to his last will and testament.<eos> He left this for you.
Nina, don't worry about it.<eos> Just focus on finding a door.<eos> But if we can't get out, can it get in?<eos> Shouldn't we stay here?<eos> The lady makes a good point.<eos> Baird...?<eos> Whatever you are, show yourself.<eos> I surrender!<eos> - To who?<eos> - To you.
Skippy." It's Colonel Baird.<eos> Grab the blue cube. - Oh!<eos> Throw!<eos> No!<eos> Sorry, Nina.<eos> Library's closed.<eos> No, you're just a mortal.<eos> You can't cheat fate!<eos> I didn't cheat fate.<eos> I cheated you.
I'm not important enough to have my own tale.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Let me just see if I can find you.<eos> Mesdames and messieurs, I present to you your host for this evening... the Count of Monte Cristo.<eos> Welcome, dear guests.<eos> Thank you for joining me on what I'm sure will be a memorable evening.<eos> We should be the ones thanking you.<eos> After all, you're the one throwing this party.<eos> Nonsense, Baron.<eos> This evening wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for you.
If someone's out there copying Cullen, it could still lead us to him, and I want in on that.<eos> I need everyone to look for any other discrepancies between the copycat and Cullen.<eos> Tara's gonna interview the latest victim and see what he remembers.<eos> Does it itch?<eos> So bad.<eos> When I was 12, I came home from summer camp and two of my closest friends, they had moved away.<eos> It was the first time I noticed how quickly life can change.<eos> You think you're one thing and then you're something else.<eos> And now I'm this.<eos> This trauma, yes, it's a part of you. But it is not all of you.
Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful.<eos> Despite all the chaos earlier, we simply couldn't be happier.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli.<eos> Please take a maple butter scone.<eos> I made them fresh this morning.<eos> Oh, they look a bit burned.<eos> But they're not.<eos> Hmm. Oh, fork, that's good.<eos> Extra, extra!<eos> Read all about you.
I'm just trying to stop something bad from happening.<eos> What, bad for them or bad for us?<eos> Pretty soon, that's going to be the same thing.<eos> They get upset, scared, angry, and they can be dangerous, but they... they also love.<eos> They can be loved.<eos> You don't need to tell me.<eos> I can upload you.<eos> That's straightforward enough. Copy your mind onto the Qualia server.<eos> Is that what you really want?<eos> I may never be able to make you human.
Where is she?<eos> She's here, she's unharmed.<eos> Tell Leo to be here within one hour.<eos> If he does not arrive by then, I will kill her.<eos> If I see or hear any police, I will kill her.<eos> If you do anything else that I've not asked you to do, I will kill her.<eos> You needn't be afraid.<eos> If you cooperate, I won't have to harm you.<eos> If you do not cooperate, - I will kill your children first.<eos> - I don't believe you.
Not a nice one, anyway, because of what you are, because of what I am.<eos> We're unique.<eos> And that doesn't work very well here.<eos> Sometimes my body won't do what I want it to.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Of course, Karen.<eos> What are you going to do if Leo doesn't get here on time?<eos> Killing me won't get you anywhere.<eos> It will just make things worse.<eos> For us, as well as you.
Leaving aside all the physical facts which one can quote. Leaving aside rape or murder.<eos> Leaving aside the bloody catalog of oppression, which we are, in one way, too familiar with already, what this does to the subjugated is to destroy his sense of reality.<eos> This means, in the case of an American negro, born in that glittering republic, and in the moment you are born, since you don't know any better, every stick and stone and every face is white,<eos> and since you have not yet seen a mirror, you suppose that you are too.<eos> It comes as a great shock around the age of five, or six, or seven, to discover that Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, when you were rooting for Gary Cooper,<eos> that the Indians were you.<eos> It comes as a great shock to discover the country, which is your birthplace, and to which you owe your life and your identity, has not, in its whole system of reality, evolved any place for you.<eos> I know how to do it, technically.<eos> It is a matter of research and journeys.<eos> And with you or without you, I will do it anyway.
And I was not a member of the NAACP because in the North, where I grew up, the NAACP was fatally entangled with black class distinctions, or illusions of the same, which repelled a shoe-shine boy like me.<eos> I did not have to deal with the criminal state of Mississippi, hour by hour and day by day, to say nothing of night after night.<eos> I did not have to sweat cold sweat after decisions involving hundreds of thousands of lives.<eos> I was not responsible for raising money, or deciding how to use it.<eos> I was not responsible for strategy controlling prayer-meetings, marches, petitions, voting registration drives.<eos> I saw the Sheriffs, the Deputies, the Storm Troopers, more or less in passing.<eos> I was never in town to stay.<eos> This was sometimes hard on my morale, but I had to accept, as time wore on, that part of my responsibility, as a witness, was to move as largely and as freely as possible.<eos> We should all be concerned with but one goal, the eradication of crime.<eos> The Federal Bureau of Investigation is as close to you as your nearest telephone.

Now she's the director of field operations...<eos> Mr. Greene.<eos> You look lovely this evening, Miss Elcar.<eos> ...aka my boss.<eos> You should really take the tour.<eos> The art here is magnificent.<eos> Oh, I certainly will.<eos> That's the seller.<eos> And the vault?<eos> The door's behind you.
But this latest intel suggests that he was just another broker looking to make a sale.<eos> Any idea when or where? - No.<eos> - Well, if we can't find him, we need to find the buyer.<eos> Nikki downloaded everything from that night onto her hard drive.<eos> The face of every guest at that party.<eos> That's our list of potential buyers.<eos> I already have our cyber team processing her computer.<eos> Mac, I know you asked for some time, but this requires somebody who can handle a biologic.<eos> The clock's ticking.<eos> We need you.
What?<eos> The Reverend Brother went to Seattle two days ago.<eos> Some of the brethren had gone to market.<eos> They didn't come back.<eos> Seattle is not a place people should go right now.<eos> It's come to my attention that you have a weapon.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Yeah, I think I'll take a pass on that one.<eos> Give it to me or it will be taken from you, and you'll be removed from our community.
I was going over numbers for the program... and the loss incidence for weapons was being underreported.<eos> And who did you bring this to?<eos> A friend at the DOJ.<eos> And Rob.<eos> He thanked me for the catch and promised he'd deal with it.<eos> And did he?<eos> Two days ago, I checked the loss incidence again, and it had gone up.<eos> I told Rob we had to take it upstairs.<eos> He said he would shut down the program... after they handled it.<eos> And he tried to handle you instead.
No hospitals. He's wanted by the police. They both are.<eos> Well, I don't have anywhere near the proper resources.<eos> Well, obviously, the Director thinks you do, or you wouldn't be here, would you?<eos> All right.<eos> Go ahead and put him out.<eos> Can you get me light, please?<eos> Okay, warm up the laser and get him on plasma.<eos> What happened?<eos> He got shot in the gut.<eos> No. I'm talking about you. Let me see.
Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Before we brace for landing...<eos> Get back in your seats, now! Grant? Where are you going?<eos> Put your head face-down in your lap, and wrap your arms underneath your knees.<eos> If you are unable to assume this position, cross your wrists and place them on the seat back in front of you. Rest your forehead on the seat back.<eos> Children should lean forward, feet flat on the floor...<eos> - Sit here. - Place heads face-down in laps, and wrap their arms underneath their knees.<eos> Stay calm, and we're gonna be all right.<eos> I don't think I believe you anymore.
I'm... gonna get better.<eos> Are you?<eos> Mmm-hmm. Here.<eos> Try it.<eos> Is it good?<eos> It's coffee.<eos> Sorry. Just, uh...<eos> - Don't let me stop you.<eos> - MacLaren.<eos> David? Yeah, of course I remember you.
You feel fine?<eos> Other than the obvious discomfort.<eos> Good.<eos> Then it wasn't anything medical.<eos> Okay...<eos> Uh, what is that?<eos> I'm gonna take you back now. You can claim a sick day and stay home.<eos> That doesn't answer my question.<eos> See, this is gonna erase the last 24 hours from your memory.<eos> To you, it'll be like you overslept and none of this happened.
I'm like a shark in a tank, and I'm swimming around in circles and I'm moving, but I'm not getting anywhere.<eos> And yes, yes. I've created a media empire and... I'd like to think that I spread some light in humanity out there in the world.<eos> And I launched Supergirl for God sake.<eos> I've just been swimming in the same pool for too long.<eos> There are new seas out there that I have to go conquer.<eos> Hmm. I need to dive.<eos> Everything is changing so fast.<eos> I do not do well with change.<eos> Gosh, Ms. Grant.<eos> I really can't imagine being here without you.
It should beep.<eos> McGill?<eos> Did you file your report this morning?<eos> Was he on the kryptonite transport team?<eos> No.<eos> There's no reason he should have gone near it.<eos> He's the mole.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Agent McGill.<eos> I have an assignment for you.
I'll tell your father you say hello.<eos> Where's my father?<eos> You know I won't say.<eos> Well, you might as well tell me, if you're gonna kill me.<eos> I suggest you die remembering him as he was.<eos> It's better that way.<eos> Unless you'd care to join him.<eos> Cadmus welcomes any bright minds willing to help our cause.<eos> My father would never collaborate with you.<eos> Do you know what I see when I look at you?
What it could be, if they were no more.<eos> That's what I'm trying to do for the world.<eos> And you could help me.<eos> I've killed a Kryptonian before.<eos> I stabbed Astra of the House of El with a sword made of kryptonite.<eos> I've done what you want to do.<eos> What you can't do.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I want you to know what I'm capable of when I tell you that when I find my father, I'm coming for you.
Couple hours?<eos> Look, I really need to get to Yakima.<eos> I've always wanted to see Paris.<eos> Hey, little missy here says I've known her ten years.<eos> Now, does that sound right to you?<eos> I don't know. Ask the sergeant.<eos> What sergeant?<eos> The sarge.<eos> Hey, Sarge?<eos> Sarge, does this little girl seem credible to you?
- Both species have heat vision.<eos> - Thank you. - We'll take it from here.<eos> - The airport is within my jurisdiction.<eos> Your jurisdiction ends where I say it does.<eos> See you around, Danvers.<eos> Make sure you're bagging that up properly.<eos> Welcome to the DEO, Madam President.<eos> I'm surprised, now that your true identity is known to the world, you don't live openly as your Martian self.<eos> I find looking human makes people feel more comfortable.<eos> Hopefully, my Alien Amnesty Act will change that. For you and everyone else from beyond the stars that have made Earth their home.

For you and everyone else from beyond the stars that have made Earth their home.<eos> I know the DEO's mission is to hunt renegade aliens, but that mission is going to have to adapt.<eos> - You disagree, Director?<eos> - I do, Madam President.<eos> There are aliens out there, killers who wouldn't understand the concept of the very rights you're offering them.<eos> Evil creatures who could take advantage of your good will.<eos> I imagine the very same thing was once said about you, J'onn J'onzz but someone gave you the benefit of the doubt.
Look, I'm sorry, all right?<eos> I just meant that if it weren't for you guys, I'd be completely screwed.<eos> I will not accept profanity.<eos> Everything was fine here until you came.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know a great deal about demons.<eos> I just know what I've seen here the past few days. - That's it.<eos> - So you say.<eos> The reverend brother will decide your case.<eos> In the meantime, you'll go where others are safe from you.

How wonderful to see you once again.<eos> Reverend Brother!<eos> I heard a demon's voice!<eos> I was defending myself.<eos> The voice came from inside of her.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He attacked me!<eos> You certainly don't expect me to believe that. Oh.<eos> Oh, Reverend Brother.<eos> She's put some kind of spell on you.
Are you okay?<eos> No, I'm not okay. Can you get me out, please?<eos> I can't.<eos> They think you're a witch. They say you cast a demon love spell on me.<eos> I don't know how to cast demon love spells, Devyn, all right?<eos> I kind of think you did.<eos> I feel really weird.<eos> Devyn, you're 15.<eos> Everybody's weird at 15.<eos> I sinned for you today.
They think you're a witch. They say you cast a demon love spell on me.<eos> I don't know how to cast demon love spells, Devyn, all right?<eos> I kind of think you did.<eos> I feel really weird.<eos> Devyn, you're 15.<eos> Everybody's weird at 15.<eos> I sinned for you today.<eos> You've sinned? Yeah.<eos> Devyn, I think you should open the door.<eos> I was looking at you.
Everybody lies sometimes.<eos> It's nature.<eos> People lie.<eos> Not where I'm from.<eos> It's not an option.<eos> So you really think you're gonna die if I don't kiss you?<eos> Well, I don't think it's for sure.<eos> I mean, I hope you kiss me.<eos> I'll risk it if you don't.<eos> I just need to be near you.
I'll give you back doors, side doors, tracing... whatever you want.<eos> Just don't shut it down.<eos> This was always the future, Jack.<eos> The Five/Nine attacks... they just accelerated it.<eos> How long?<eos> How long have you been pressing this pedal?<eos> How long have you been plotting against me?<eos> Oh, come on, Jack.<eos> We... we've known each other for years.<eos> You know full well I... I don't give a shit about you.
I know how this works.<eos> You get close to me, play the sympathy card, relate to me... we're just two crazy, wacky Jersey girls.<eos> Take advantage that I did lose what probably was the love of my life.<eos> And you act like you care.<eos> But that's just it... an act.<eos> Which is sick and twisted.<eos> I'd rather you arrest me and throw me into jail.<eos> But let's get something straight.<eos> You will not get anything out of me.<eos> So why don't you go read your manual and find the chapter on conniving cunts that don't give a fuck about you or your feelings and then get back to me with some real tactics?
-[Jim] Oh! -Mmm! Tit's a pleasure, Mr. Hamburg.<eos> I'm Miranda, and you need to put me in your next movie.<eos> I have an extensive acting resume, including many performances in various venues, including my living room, uh, my kitchen, closet--<eos> -Backyard.<eos> -Oh, backyard.<eos> You sound like a talented young lady.<eos> Do I know talent?<eos> You bet I do!<eos> Yes! -[softly] Yes!<eos> Right, well, I'm gonna perform a monologue for you.
Now, show him sadder.<eos> Now, show him bored.<eos> And elated.<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. You are not impressed, but face acting is not everyone's cup of tea, so...<eos> I know.<eos> Can I... can I sing now?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, Miranda will sing for you.
Let me handle this.<eos> Uncle Jim, we don't have time for this.<eos> Just tell them I'm a celebrity and they'll let us go.<eos> I'll do all the talking. [breathing heavily]<eos> Okay, Uncle Jim, you just need to stay calm and don't freak out!<eos> -I am calm. How do I look?<eos> -Try and keep calm.<eos> -[Miranda] You look stressed!<eos> -He's here! He's here! He's here.<eos> Good evening to you, my good sir.
They have terrible taste.<eos> Anyways, I have a pigeon that I need to look like a dove.<eos> Do you have any white?<eos> Thank you, Emily.<eos> Good talk.<eos> My little invisible girl.<eos> ♪ Magic!<eos> Magic time! ♪<eos> ♪ I'm Miranda And it's magic time ♪<eos> ♪ We're gonna do a magic trick For you and you ♪
I have a date.<eos> I'm not doing this again.<eos> Hello, darling.<eos> Just passing by?<eos> Who's back there?<eos> I'm not the nosy type.<eos> You're not supposed to be here.<eos> - The restaurant's closed.<eos> - Who's the boy?<eos> - This isn't for you.
He thinks he's Commander pet.<eos> If anything happens to Junior, We will be the ones to die, not he.<eos> Yes.<eos> What's so scary about local guardians?<eos> Are you leaving now?<eos> Why would I stay?<eos> Here is a letter.<eos> I found it among Miss Bai's things.<eos> Sorry, It didn't have an envelope, so I opened it.<eos> The letter is for you.
The children are now with the Guardians.<eos> Hero,<eos> You've helped us before,<eos> So I know you have feelings.<eos> I didn't mean to interfere with your wanderings,<eos> But as a teacher<eos> I cannot leave my students in mortal danger.<eos> Unfortunately, I am weak and alone and unable to handle the prospect.<eos> I was desperate for a long time.<eos> I am writing this letter to you.
What?<eos> What I just gave you.<eos> What?<eos> Where is the thing I just gave you?<eos> What thing?<eos> Junior Commandant!<eos> I knew you didn't have a gift.<eos> It's a trick.<eos> I'm not tricking you!<eos> My gift was to release Yang Kenan for you.
Right. Bye.<eos> My God... what have I done?<eos> Tonight needs to be the perfect blend of celebratory, reverential, bittersweet, upbeat, fun, and effortless.<eos> This is #TahaniTime.<eos> What is all this?<eos> Oh, no, Michael, you're not supposed to see it till it's all set up.<eos> But, well, welcome to your retirement party.<eos> Look, over there, I've even set up a buffet of themed desserts, like retire-mint chocolate cake or, uh, "flan voyage."<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Oh, and here we have a piñata shaped like you, which is always fun.
Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes.<eos> It's called "pleurigloss."<eos> Could you describe it?<eos> It's the color of... When a soldier comes home from war and sees his dog for the first time.<eos> How about blue?<eos> Tahani, I'm so sorry.<eos> We need to cancel this party immediately.<eos> But why?<eos> For a being like me, retirement... is not something fun.<eos> What is "retirement" for you exactly?
I always have, and this is going to eat me up inside forever.<eos> You might be able to shrug this off, and forget about it, but I never will.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Jianyu!<eos> Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me.<eos> Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot and saying "hello" over and over again, but she did point at you.
We've spoken to Staffordshire, Merseyside, half a dozen other forces.<eos> No one's gone anywhere near our witnesses. And we can't find a Detective Galen anywhere on the National Register.<eos> Okay, let's stop calling him Galen.<eos> He wants us to do that.<eos> He wants that name in our heads, so it directs our thinking.<eos> -What do we call him?<eos> -The Ghost Detective?<eos> Yeah.<eos> [Bobby sighs] What he asked Lucy was, did she see anybody else there? And did the killer take anything from her?<eos> Bobby, this, uh, was left at reception for you.
-Hey, Damien?<eos> -[Damien] This is him.<eos> Yeah, my name is Detective Robert Day from Woodmere CID.<eos> -Do you have a current guest?<eos> -Yes, I have.<eos> -Yeah, is he a single gentleman? -I'm sorry?<eos> -Um, you know, a man on his own?<eos> -A German gentleman? Yeah.<eos> The German gentleman, yeah, that's the one.<eos> -I'm concerned for you, Miss Suresh.
-Yes, I have.<eos> -Yeah, is he a single gentleman? -I'm sorry?<eos> -Um, you know, a man on his own?<eos> -A German gentleman? Yeah.<eos> The German gentleman, yeah, that's the one.<eos> -I'm concerned for you, Miss Suresh.<eos> -[scoffs] For me?<eos> Before you get too involved with my son, there's something you should know.<eos> I'm not getting involved with Alec.<eos> Well, I saw the way he looked at you.
You have to leave me out of this.<eos> Wait. [stammers] Who is that man who attacked me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is that Angela Benton-- She knew something.<eos> What have you found out?<eos> Why won't you come forward and talk to us?<eos> No, no. I can't.<eos> I can't. You have to know that.<eos> Two people killed.<eos> And you, almost the same.
Well, I'm not sure I see what there is to love.<eos> The man Alec was after on that boat lift, he might have killed the young mother.<eos> You know, that's worth something.<eos> Why would a son risk his life doing a job that he does... just to spite his mother?<eos> Not everything on this planet is about you, Mrs. Wayfield.<eos> Not everything in Alec's life is about you.<eos> I mean, if you could just stop thinking about yourself for five minutes-- [sighs]<eos> A slap, from a police officer in public.<eos> Take that to your lawyer with a cherry on top.<eos> You know, I have not one jot of pity for you, none. But I will give you some advice for free.
He knows that I've been seeing Bobby.<eos> He said that I should find out what Bobby has been doing in Düsseldorf.<eos> I should find out and tell him.<eos> Crowley is asking you to find out about our investigation?<eos> Let's go back because--<eos> Can you explain to us, please, why Dr. Crowley believes that he can get you to give him information?<eos> He was my psychiatrist some time ago.<eos> A psychiatrist knows things, every bit of a person's life.<eos> He's saying he'll use that.<eos> Has Dr. Crowley threatened to use something he knows about you?
[sighs]<eos> [Nina] You sent this to us.<eos> My wife made these.<eos> To give to me, to show me she was lonely.<eos> But what I heard was, she was depressed.<eos> Steffan, it's what's written on these cards that we're here to talk about.<eos> I was busy at work. I didn't want to have to deal with her moods.<eos> I told her to go and see her GP.<eos> He gave her some pills. I thought that was good news.<eos> Written here, by you, about the murder of Angela Benton.
[sighs] You can't go on doing this to us.<eos> We're giving you what you asked for.<eos> You have to talk to us about Angela.<eos> I asked him why he'd given her so many pills, why he'd increased the dosage.<eos> He didn't want to know.<eos> He gave me bland answers.<eos> So I wrote to Rustin Wade, the company who made the pills.<eos> I'm a medic. I thought they'd listen to me. But they wanted to make me look like a crank.<eos> So I started to look into it all. Properly dig around.<eos> Steffan, honestly, I know what this all means to you.
-Wait, it could be she was spooked because you may have appeared a little bit intense?<eos> And then she was killed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There is that.<eos> [in German] This way, please.<eos> You have to try these, Bobby.<eos> They're French.<eos> You won't get religieuse like this in Cheshire.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> I'll have one for you.
2004?<eos> You're upset.<eos> You see, a little bit of sisterhood. 2002?<eos> It was 2001.<eos> I came before you.<eos> He let me believe that I instigated sex.<eos> I see.<eos> Were there pictures?<eos> He used me.<eos> He used you.
You let him toy with us.<eos> We got access to Buchleitner's bank account but there's nothing on there that connects him to Waingrow or to Rustin Wade.<eos> [Nina] There might be other hidden accounts, of course.<eos> [Alec] What about the bald man?<eos> Nothing on our database here in Düsseldorf.<eos> We've put the pictures up nationally.<eos> Linda, we'll, we'll catch up tomorrow.<eos> Where's Bobby?<eos> -I'd like to check-in to the hotel. -[elevator dings]<eos> Hey, I got you a Martini.
Only they say take them at certain times.<eos> Take them with meals.<eos> Yeah, I get stressed.<eos> My legs are all tensed out.<eos> Do you think maybe you get more stressed if you take more pills?<eos> -Because that's what I'm seeing, Bobby.<eos> -Don't give me a lecture, Linda.<eos> Don't talk to me like I'm somebody who comes into work drunk.<eos> I am responsible for this case.<eos> I like you, Bobby, I really do. But I want you to go home.
Chris, I know that you gave those pictures of me to some man in Germany.<eos> Turns out I'm not quite the good Quaker I like to think I am.<eos> -What do you want, Lucy?<eos> -I want to help you.<eos> All right, I'm going.<eos> Suppose you get away with it, Chris, whatever you've done, suppose you don't get caught, isn't that worse?<eos> Day after day, waking up to yourself, your secrets, your conscience.<eos> Isn't that going to be torture?<eos> I can sit here, Chris, because I know I did my best.<eos> Oh, well, hooray for you.
I took them.<eos> -Why do you hide a telephone?<eos> -I'm having a liaison, an affair.<eos> -Now she's married, so this--<eos> -Every time you lie to me, -I'm gonna make you eat some of these. -No, please.<eos> Every time you spit one out, I'm gonna make you eat two.<eos> -Now I wanna know the truth. -No!<eos> [screams]<eos> And I don't have long!<eos> I don't care what happens to you.
Hot!<eos> Hot! Don't tell my wife, okay?<eos> Oh, sorry, sir.<eos> This one is also pornography.<eos> Oh, so boring.<eos> Trim those nails, Smithers.<eos> Uh, sir, if I might suggest, the last thing your therapist said was,<eos> "You need a family."<eos> I don't need anyone.<eos> We could program a virtual family for you, sir.
Have you seen my Canadian penny?<eos> Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!<eos> Everyone out!<eos> You're all fired!<eos> Having a family is the most meaningless experience I could imagine.<eos> Try acting.<eos> Mm... Come on, kids.<eos> I'm taking my bathrobe.<eos> There's a dye pack stitched in.<eos> Joke's on you.
I don't care anymore.<eos> Tell me about your dreams.<eos> What do you dream about?<eos> Woody.<eos> Every night.<eos> We have this... mad, passionate love affair.<eos> A relationship with conversations and adventures.<eos> Then I wake up and it's all a dream.<eos> A reoccurring dream... About a pathetic, squirrelly man I don't even know.<eos> I don't believe you.
Tens are super rare.<eos> There's never been a ten in my audience, ever.<eos> I don't think tens come to things like this.<eos> I think tens are sitting at home with other tens going, "I'm so happy."<eos> And nines are as rare as tens, almost.<eos> A nine is just an imperfect ten.<eos> A nine is like a ten with a fucked-up toe.<eos> So, an eight's pretty good.<eos> Now, regrettably... there is a two in the audience.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna point you out.
You two are officially in overtime.<eos> I'm turning you around to South Austin.<eos> Voight needs all the bodies he can get to search for this girl.<eos> Commander.<eos> Commander Fogel, how can I help you?<eos> We got a beef, you and me?<eos> Something we need to talk about?<eos> No, why do you ask?<eos> You went around me to get Patrol Officer Tay reassigned to this district.<eos> Actually, I went over you.
Didn't mean to let the cat out of the bag.<eos> I'll just say best man won and all that.<eos> And you, Miss Song, I believe we're still on for tomorrow?<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> Delighted.<eos> A bientÃ´t.<eos> He is a bit miffed.<eos> We were up for the same position, but, apparently, he didn't make the cut.<eos> Always a bit bitter, our old Bill.<eos> But that's fantastic news for you.
I'm sorry, it's been over for twenty minutes.<eos> It's OK, Grinch.<eos> There's still time to get the Christmas tree.<eos> That's gonna be our excuse to mom.<eos> Christmas tree.<eos> Is that him over there?<eos> Yeah, come on, come on.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Hey, how are ya?<eos> He's taken a shine to you.
Sorry, I'm allergic to dogs.<eos> I think he might be allergic to you.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> I better get an anti histamine.<eos> We still good for dinner tomorrow night?<eos> Look, I don't want to interfere with your schedule.<eos> You kids go have fun, huh?<eos> - Right, should we say seven?<eos> - À bientôt.<eos> - Yeah, same to you, Randy.
Like the plague.<eos> Yeah, like the plague.<eos> My relationship with Rand is based on trust.<eos> I don't lie.<eos> Then just tell him that you'd rather go to the movie with us.<eos> Unless you'd rather not.<eos> Well?<eos> No, I would love to go with you.<eos> With all of you.<eos> Won't be the same without you.
What a house.<eos> Like a hotel.<eos> A couple lives here?<eos> Maybe you wanna keep your comments to yourself tonight.<eos> - What did I say?<eos> - "A couple lives here?"<eos> Jackie, these are my parents.<eos> Candice and Blair.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you.<eos> This is for you.
But, Jack, she needs to know.<eos> Then you tell her.<eos> Just wait till I'm gone.<eos> I gotta get some things in town.<eos> Man, I shouldn't have fixed the jeep.<eos> Yeah. thanks for that.<eos> It's been good seeing you, Mike.<eos> Come on, Jack.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> You need Jackie as much as she needs you.
I'm just smoothing out some of your rough edges, which you know you have.<eos> Maybe I like those rough edges.<eos> And maybe I wanna be with someone who likes them too.<eos> You know this means you won't be getting the offer from Jenkins and Herschel?<eos> I'm crushed.<eos> You gave that folder to my father and he just threw it out?<eos> He said, he didn't want you to think he was sabotaging anymore of your life.<eos> OK.<eos> I guess I deserve that.<eos> Look, I know he plays the tough guy, but underneath it, he loves you more than you could possible imagine.
You don't want to go there.<eos> That place is the lion's den. This is where she went, isn't it?<eos> She was writing a book about a cult that wears green sneakers.<eos> Is this where they're holding her? Please just get Bizzy out of here.<eos> - How do I find her?<eos> - You don't.<eos> You give up.<eos> You go on with your life.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> Good God, I feel bad for you.
Two minutes. You got two minutes.<eos> - Two minutes.<eos> - Put it away.<eos> Okay... you know who we are, right?<eos> - Five-O.<eos> - You know we're not the cops, right?<eos> We can keep you here indefinitely, nobody's gonna ask any questions.<eos> You're aware of that, right?<eos> On my children, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I believe you.
I just need to know where our loyalty is.<eos> Our loyalty is with the deal.<eos> - And to the client.<eos> - Which client?<eos> Yours or Jones's?<eos> You're as paranoid as the Belgian.<eos> Get me some information on that guy over there.<eos> This is your entire file.<eos> I hope you forgive my handwriting.<eos> I always felt badly we couldn't do more for you.
No.<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.<eos> We've gone to a lot of trouble.<eos> What hell am I doing here?<eos> You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> We all do. We see her in our dreams.<eos> She told us about you.
For most citizens of the world, they're either dreaming... Or awake.<eos> And these two things stay far apart.<eos> But for people with a little know-how, people like me, there's no gap at all.<eos> They can walk like an ant on the rim of one glass and onto the other.<eos> You, though, have the rare ability to spill your waking into your dreaming so that they overlap and mix together, like the time in the lobby of the firm.<eos> She really was gorgeous in red.<eos> Martini's yours.<eos> How do I find her?<eos> Which half of her?<eos> I was wondering when you'd surface.
We haven't laughed this hard since Gertrude took up rollerblading.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Two thousand shiny pennies for a hootenanny of a show.<eos> Blender!<eos> Blender! Blender!<eos> Come back anytime.<eos> Do you like power shakes, but are tired of pushing all those buttons?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then you need Barb's new and improved blender.<eos> It does all the button-pushing for you.
What?<eos> You heard right.<eos> Maya's right outside.<eos> I'm gonna need a moment.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know you only did this so she'll tell me to take the deal, but thank you.<eos> Leonard, she doesn't even know about the deal.<eos> Then what'd you tell her to get her to come?<eos> I told her we found new evidence that her father is an innocent man.<eos> And she should hear it from you before we go to court to prove it.
You know what that is.<eos> It's a subpoena.<eos> I signed your affidavit.<eos> You have what you need.<eos> Did you really think you wouldn't have to testify that Bailey had an alibi?<eos> What I didn't think was that you were going to paint me as incompetent.<eos> We did what you should've done 12 years ago.<eos> Represent your client.<eos> And you weren't even forming sentences when I handled this case.<eos> Well, I'm forming sentences now, so instead of being angry, you should be thanking us for not bringing an action against you on Leonard's behalf.
I lost 12 years for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> But I won't regret any of it if it ends up being the thing that got me clean and reunited with you.<eos> Because if I died with you believing your father did this...<eos> She doesn't think that.<eos> She knows that you didn't hurt those kids.<eos> I have no further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, we reserve the right to cross examine the defendant.<eos> But for now, since he's claiming he knows what it feels like to be an aggrieved father, I'd like to call Victor Forrest to the stand.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to do this, Mr. Forrest.<eos> I know how difficult it must be for you. Would you mind telling us a little bit about your daughter?
Then, in the middle of the night, while composing their next prediction, they get their throats cut.<eos> Hey, Rupert, what brings you down here?<eos> Uh, research project.<eos> Yourself?<eos> Informant got murdered the other night.<eos> Aw, bad luck.<eos> I'm gonna miss him.<eos> Now I've got a really big hole to fill.<eos> Guy's a bit of an asshole, but a good informant.<eos> I may have someone for you.
I've been put up for this promotion, I can't give any details, but it would put me in a position where I believe you, your reputation, your contacts within Chinese communities could be very valuable to me.<eos> And beneficial to yourself, of course.<eos> That sounds rather interesting. Does it?<eos> It's a little... frightening, and exciting at the same time.<eos> I imagine it is.<eos> It would require that you and I have absolutely no contact in public.<eos> I need to share some information with you and you alone, and for security's sake, it would require that you no longer have any communication with Bill.<eos> He'd ask why.<eos> Oh, I'll sort that out in the next few days.<eos> I think, if I might be as frank as I like to be, I believe Bill has taken a more intimate interest in you than you may be aware.

"Stop or I'll shoot,"<eos> and I fired once, a warning, and he stopped.<eos> I was about here... and he turned, and looked at me.<eos> And started running towards me, screaming, and I fired, and he went down.<eos> He was coming at you?<eos> I didn't know he didn't have the backpack.<eos> I did not see that.<eos> You reacted.<eos> It's understandable.<eos> He was coming for you.
Walk through the mall, pretend to window shop for a half hour, up the elevators from the underground parking, get off two floors below his, and then walk up.<eos> Sounds exhausting.<eos> Exciting, actually. Was it?<eos> How so?<eos> It just got my heart beating.<eos> Silly for an old pro like you, I guess, but new to me.<eos> No, not silly at all.<eos> It's important that you keep me in touch with how you feel as we go through all of this.<eos> I'm... a little conflicted.<eos> Mr. Sproule is asking me for one thing, and you another.
He said he thought you were becoming obsessed with me.<eos> Really?<eos> Interesting.<eos> In what way?<eos> In a way he thought inappropriate.<eos> I mean, it's all right if you are.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Well, of course I'm obsessed.<eos> In fact, you're my number-one responsibility.<eos> Take care of your assets, and your assets will take care of you.
In fact, you're my number-one responsibility.<eos> Take care of your assets, and your assets will take care of you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did I embarrass you?<eos> I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said it...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm... I'm glad that you did.<eos> It's a very tricky, complicated relationship that we have to have between us.<eos> Delicate.<eos> I didn't know what to think of you at first.
I wanted for you and I to be able to talk directly.<eos> Sure.<eos> I also know you are helping to provide a big part of the financing here, and I appreciate that.<eos> Doing what I can.<eos> Walk with me.<eos> I need to change.<eos> I also know that my husband, Wing, have a good relationship with you.<eos> I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> I just spoke to him in Hong Kong.<eos> He assured me he trusts you.
You want out of this box or not?<eos> Mr. Bailey, my name is Rachel Zane.<eos> I am a law student at Columbia, and I'm here to talk to you about your case.<eos> Student?<eos> -Yes, we work alongside the Innocence Project to determine if you have the criteria for an appeal.<eos> Do you know how long I've been sittin' on death row?<eos> 12 years. I read your file.<eos> And for the last ten of 'em, I've been writing letters and begging any lawyer to listen to my story.<eos> And they finally get around to getting back to me, and they don't even have the courtesy of sending' me a real lawyer?<eos> Mr. Bailey, trust me, I will fight for you.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> No, it has nothing to do with you.<eos> And of course I will pay you out of my own pocket for any of the work you've already done. That won't be necessary.<eos> Please, Tara, I insist.<eos> In that case, I might as well at least show you what I had in mind.<eos> As you can see, these are just rough drawings.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Here's the frosted glass wall curving in an elegant "S" that separates the space. It's beautiful.<eos> -That's not even the best part.<eos> Because I know how important the new bullpen is to you, I modeled it after the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, and I enclosed the entire space--
I'm doing the Innocence Project.<eos> What are you doing here, Harvey?<eos> You didn't give me a chance to show you all the motions I filed to keep that bastard out of your backyard.<eos> Because I told you if you were late for dinner you could go screw yourself.<eos> No, you didn't give me a chance to show you because you're afraid of William Sutter, when the person you should be afraid of is me.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> You think I don't know he bought a piece of you in the middle of the night, and now he's pressuring the board to kick you out?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> He did, but I'm a whale, and he's a shark, and I have no other choice.<eos> I got a little news for you, Nathan.
Why the hell would Harvey do that?<eos> Let's just say I helped him out of a jam.<eos> This isn't over, because whatever Harvey did, he doesn't know contracts like I do.<eos> And you don't know them like I know them, because this new lease is tighter than your mom's ass.<eos> That's it.<eos> I am suing you for slander, because my mom's ass is miles from tight.<eos> I'll take your word for it, bro, and bring it on, because you might be a Harvard-educated lawyer, but I'm a Yale-educated lawyer, and the difference between me and you is I know the real money's in trading.<eos> Now get the hell out of my bullpen.<eos> - Harvey. - William.<eos> I got something for you.
It means there's nothing else I can do.<eos> I knew you couldn't do shit for me.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> They almost never take cases without new DNA evidence, and yours had none.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> You asked me to take a chance on you, and now you march in here and tell me you're giving up?<eos> No, no, Mr. Bailey...<eos> You said you would fight for me.<eos> I did fight for you.
- Actually, I do.<eos> - How's that?<eos> My fiancé's in prison.<eos> How long?<eos> - Two years.<eos> - Two years is nothing.<eos> It doesn't feel like nothing to me.<eos> What if it was forever, Rachel?<eos> Would you give up on him like you did me?<eos> I didn't give up on you.
Well, then, why don't you go find your own house, Louis?<eos> - Gin.<eos> - Again?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> Don't play cards with a guy with a photographic memory.<eos> How many times I have to tell you I'm still gonna beat you?<eos> Deal.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your Go Fish. There's a Harvey Specter here to see you.<eos> Saved by the bell.<eos> Not you, Ross.
You are betraying your cellmate, who you came to me to protect.<eos> No, what I am doing is putting away someone who is out there doing worse things than I ever did.<eos> So I don't need your judgment.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I'm sorry, it's not my job to help you do something like this.<eos> No, it's your job to help me prepare for life after prison.<eos> Well, this is gonna make life after prison come a hell of a lot faster.<eos> Well, fine, you want to do this?<eos> You go ahead and do it, but I am not gonna be complicit.<eos> You know what? You talk a big goddamn game about trusting you, but what does that trust mean?
Until this thing goes through, not only are you gonna keep your hands off Mike, you're gonna be his personal protector in here. - Bullshit.<eos> - Not bullshit.<eos> He so much as twists an ankle in the yard,<eos> Now, aren't you forgetting a little something, champ?<eos> I don't need you to handle this thing for me.<eos> Now that I know what's what, I'll get my own attorney.<eos> Yeah, you do that, and I'll tell the courts that you just admitted to me that you tried to poison Mike.<eos> You know how much time that's gonna add to your sentence? - I didn't do shit to him!<eos> - Good for you.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna believe, a former prosecutor like me or an informant convict like you?
That's it.<eos> Donna...<eos> I need you to help me feel my wood. Oh, dear God.<eos> God damn it, Julie, call his office again, and this time tell him to find...<eos> If you're talking about my office, there's no need. I'm right here.<eos> What the hell took you so long?<eos> - I was unavailable.<eos> - Well, I just got indicted, so from now on you make yourself available.<eos> I get it.<eos> This all just got real for you, so why don't you tell me right now, how real is the rest of it?
I'm saying, Cahill claims that you can't make the returns you do. You say you can, and I want to know how you do it.<eos> We use a proprietary trading algorithm.<eos> - Developed by who? - My son-in-law.<eos> Good, then we can give it to Cahill, 'cause he just subpoenaed it.<eos> - No, we can't. - Why the hell not?<eos> Because the trades on which I make the most money have nothing to do with that program.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You're admitting to inside trading?<eos> I'm not admitting to anything, except that sometimes I trade with my gut.<eos> Well, I got news for you, William.
What you're suggesting is a mistake.<eos> You still haven't told me why.<eos> Because you only get one shot at dismissal, and now's not the time to take it. Well, I say it is.<eos> I'm not suggesting it.<eos> I'm flat out telling you to do it.<eos> I didn't get where I am by letting my clients bully me.<eos> And I didn't get where I am by allowing my employees to dictate terms, which I already did once today. I'm not gonna do it again.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means Jessica Pearson convinced me to give your firm the rest of my business this afternoon.<eos> So if you don't move to have the charges against me dismissed, I'll have her do it for you.
Now, are you with me or not?<eos> I'm with you.<eos> I take it you're here to give me the good news.<eos> - I'm afraid not.<eos> - I thought I made myself clear.<eos> If you don't make a motion to dismiss this...<eos> I did file a motion to dismiss, but it doesn't matter, because Cahill filed subpoenas to depose you and your son-in-law first, and until those depositions happen, the court won't file on the motion.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> How the hell did he know to do that when we're about to have the case thrown out?<eos> I don't know, but that's not what I came here to talk about, because we need to get you and Kevin Miller in a room to prepare you for your deposition.
I'm not saying I didn't make some mistakes or maybe even commit a few crimes, but killing those kids was not one of them.<eos> And that's the truth, but I guess it doesn't matter, because if you don't find Maria, someday they're gonna walk me down that hall and put me to death.<eos> Then I guess I better get back to finding her.<eos> But, Leonard, I'm telling you, if you're not straight with me, this isn't gonna work.<eos> Then I won't ever leave anything out again.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> This kid's no Sean Cahill.<eos> This kid made Sean Cahill look like a fool without even having a law degree.<eos> Just so you know, when you attack opposing counsel, it kind of makes you look afraid.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.
Why doesn't it say it on the card?<eos> Because a guy that good isn't in the phone book.<eos> Listen, Rachel, when you get to a certain level, everybody has their person.<eos> Harvey has Vanessa, I have Carter.<eos> And now I do too.<eos> No, you have him for this because we don't have time.<eos> After that, you get your own guy.<eos> I don't understand, why can't I use your guy too?<eos> Because then he wouldn't be my guy.<eos> What can I do for you, Red? I'm in the middle of something.
Uh, where's Kevin?<eos> I'm his cell mate and where he is isn't important right now.<eos> I got a phone call from a guard saying that my husband wanted to see me, and I want to know what's going on.<eos> No, you got a phone call from someone saying they were calling from Danbury, which is exactly where that call was made.<eos> And now it's exactly where I'm headed out of.<eos> I know you're helping your father make illegal trades.<eos> - You can go ahead and deny it, but Kevin told me everything.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - I want to help you.<eos> - Well, I don't believe you.
Which is exactly what those ten other clowns just said.<eos> And I'll tell you what I told them, it didn't magically appear on their doorstep.<eos> I don't care how they got it. And if that's your only question,<eos> I need to get back to work.<eos> You'll leave when I say you can leave. - What did you say?<eos> - I said sit the hell down.<eos> You've been a VP for five years, but you took meetings at Goldman and Morgan last summer. Which I disclosed to Mr. Sutter.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You didn't get those jobs because they didn't want you.<eos> And now you're pissed off the people under you are making twice your salary, so you went running to the SEC.
Yes, you can direct me to Jessica Pearson.<eos> Ms. Pearson's gone for the evening, but I can take down your information and she'll get back to you in the morning.<eos> You're not taking anything down.<eos> I need to speak with someone now.<eos> You can speak with me, Mr. Forrest.<eos> I assume you're here to talk about Leonard Bailey.<eos> I'm here to show you this.<eos> This is what that man did to my daughter.<eos> Mr. Forrest, I know that this must be incredibly difficult.<eos> And it may not seem that way to you, but I am seeking justice for your daughter.
But that's not gonna do us any good, because she doesn't want anything to do with me.<eos> She never came to visit you?<eos> She thinks I'm guilty.<eos> Says I brought shame on the family.<eos> Even if you did, you need her now.<eos> She has to see that.<eos> I reached out to her, Rachel, a thousand times my first years here.<eos> I wrote her that there's nothing I needed more than to know that I had her support.<eos> She didn't give it to me then, and... she's not gonna give it to me now.<eos> Well, maybe if she could see that two women like us believe in you, then she'll be able to believe in you, too.
Louis...<eos> I would love to.<eos> - William, we need to talk.<eos> - I'm here, just like you asked.<eos> They indicted your daughter. I know.<eos> She told me.<eos> And I told you, you were playing a dangerous game using her to shield you.<eos> Jill's a big girl.<eos> She can take care of herself.<eos> Take care of herself, or take care of you?
And I'm telling you, if my loser of a son-in-law didn't cave, then Jill sure as hell won't.<eos> Listen to me, goddamn it.<eos> This isn't gonna be what it was like it was with Kevin.<eos> What do you want from me, Harvey?<eos> I want you to give me authorization to cut you both a deal.<eos> You turn yourself in, you get maybe three years, and you keep her out.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Because if she turns on you, you're gonna be getting a hell of a lot more.<eos> I'm not cutting a deal.<eos> And you think if you're willing to do this to your own daughter, she won't be willing to do it to you?
Audemars Piguet.<eos> Oh.<eos> They were all gifts for my birthday last month.<eos> Seven men's watches? That's a nice gift.<eos> We were in love.<eos> How about you hit that line again, but this time with some feeling, babe?<eos> All right, I'm gonna fill in the blanks. You're a con artist, so is your boyfriend.<eos> Only he has a habit of getting caught.<eos> And you targeted Robert Platt, a rich, older man, and you killed him.<eos> You tried to kill his daughter, a Chicago police officer, 'cause she didn't trust you.
Take it away there, Jenny.<eos> Uh, yeah, uh, so... so, bangers use a certain syntax, language... mostly letters, a shorthand.<eos> Certain bangers have certain voices.<eos> Makes it easy for us to track them over multiple profiles.<eos> But there were some that popped up right after TK's shooting.<eos> We noticed a few I didn't recognize, and, uh... you're Voight?<eos> Hank Voight?<eos> Correct.<eos> I worked in the Ivory Tower for a spell.<eos> I've read a lot of files on you, I guess you'd say... a lot of allegations.
I'd like to remind you and your attorney of statute 5/5-2 of the criminal code.<eos> Anyone who encourages, solicits, or helps...<eos> Not to mention pays...<eos> Someone to commit murder is as guilty of that murder by Illinois State law as the shooter himself.<eos> Great.<eos> Do you have any knowledge of who may have killed a witness in your trial?<eos> - No.<eos> - Anyone with motive, say, your family, ever communicate to you that they knew the identity of the witness?<eos> No.<eos> Did anyone in prison ever offer to harm the witness for you for money?
He was responding to a man in the lobby with a gun.<eos> So we're searching the whole complex right now.<eos> He was only two months out of the academy, Sarge.<eos> What's his training officer say?<eos> He's on his way to Med right now, but he said he didn't hear or see the shot.<eos> Well, the original call was a man with a gun.<eos> Get me the time and location.<eos> And make sure the kid's family<eos> - is headed over to the hospital.<eos> Sarge, we need you up here, boss.
Previously on The Romeo Section...<eos> Informant got murdered the other night.<eos> Now I got a really big hole to fill.<eos> I may have someone for you.
My buddy, Rupert, says otherwise.<eos> Who?<eos> Rupert Holmby.<eos> Ah, maybe you weren't a rat, maybe you were just really cooperative.<eos> Anyway, I know you guys go back.<eos> I don't know who you're talking about, but I think it's time for you to fuck off.<eos> All right.<eos> But when you're ready to talk, when being stupid gets tired, just call up the hotline and ask for Fergie.<eos> It's all confidential.<eos> Just a little word of wisdom for you...
Three kneelings and nine knockings of the head upon the ground.<eos> They don't understand our rituals.<eos> But they will.<eos> Very soon.<eos> Then you have lost touch.<eos> You have no idea what goes on outside these palace walls.<eos> My spies do.<eos> Your advisors are not to be trusted.<eos> Who should I trust instead?<eos> You?
Do you mind if I...?<eos> No, go ahead.<eos> Anyway, we just had a glass of wine, and I talked about my childhood, he talked about his...<eos> He called me today and offered me a promotion.<eos> It's put me in a very difficult position, and it doesn't look good for him.<eos> He bribed you?<eos> Well, he tried.<eos> Did he mention anything to you?<eos> No, but he wouldn't.<eos> He doesn't talk about you.
Old Sproule is a very capable man.<eos> He was head of the Asia Pacific region for a while a decade or so ago.<eos> But perhaps he's lost a step or two.<eos> I just feel I need to let him know that I'm not interested in any type of... intimate relationship, and I'm not sure how to handle that.<eos> You should encourage him.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I gave it to Mei.<eos> You know, that bag should be coming to me directly.<eos> She specifically asked me for it.<eos> I figured she outranks you.
Th-The beans are gnawed on and digested by little animals called civets, but the bean's core is too hard to digest fully, so eventually they poop it out.<eos> Farmers gather them.<eos> Because the bitter outside is already eaten away, they don't need to be roasted too long, preserving the natural sugar... and complexity.<eos> I always thought it was a good metaphor for what I do... getting foreign leaders to eat a plate of crap and like it.<eos> But I don't like eating it myself, especially from my own president.<eos> And I've been a party loyalist for over 40 years, and I intend to die one.<eos> Dalton running as an independent is the biggest case of traitorism I've ever seen, and I simply won't be a part of it.<eos> Your job as a foreign service officer is apolitical.<eos> It's unethical for you to let politics unravel a vital deal that you brokered on behalf of the...<eos> You're damn right I did, no thanks to you!
He didn't do anything, Blake.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Of-of course not.<eos> Why can't the FBI just crack the code?<eos> I mean, isn't that what they do?<eos> Wha...<eos> - Oh, that doesn't look good.<eos> - No.<eos> Ma'am, the president urgently needs you at the White House.
Well, you murdered the one man everyone agreed on.<eos> But we will cobble together a provisional government...<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Algeria needs a leader.<eos> I will call for elections.<eos> My people should have the chance to choose me.<eos> Do I really need to remind you that at the beginning of negotiations, the insurgency demanded your head?<eos> There is no chance that they will accept you staying in power.<eos> Now, you need to get on that plane to Malta.<eos> That is the only deal that is available to you.
Just you and me and anyone else you need to alert on our team.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Ma'am,<eos> I can't guarantee that local security and surveillance won't stop us.<eos> Understood.<eos> But it's important.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Secretary McCord, you are keeping the president waiting.<eos> I-I didn't come to see President Haddad.<eos> I came for you.
I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> But you'll be on tour and I'll miss you and I'll be so sad.<eos> What do you think about saying... Fuck you! To Glen Donovan?<eos> I do it inside of my head everyday darling, I'd love to say it out loud.<eos> Tell me what you have?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Okay, but you promise not to laugh.<eos> I won't laugh.<eos> I would never laugh at you honey.
- What?<eos> - For real.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Nah, that... that salary shit just fucked things up between us.<eos> I'm happy just grinding pro bono. I just wanna be a good friend.<eos> But for 3K a week you can be an even better friend.<eos> For three grand a week, man, I'll be Gayle King and Fonzworth Bentley rolled into one.<eos> Uh, don't do drugs. Thank you.<eos> I hope your wife is feeling better and your kid gets out of jail.<eos> Thank you. Jim, well, good luck to you and the whole fam.
It won't come to that.<eos> There's an issue I'd like to discuss with Agent Coulson alone.<eos> Could you give us a minute?<eos> And, Agent May...<eos> I can tell you're the one to keep an eye on.<eos> Melinda May.<eos> - Now, there's a riddle I'd like to solve.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> Phil...<eos> I got a special assignment for you.
Where is she?<eos> Who the hell's treating her?<eos> I'm so sorry, but it's classified.<eos> Without the Director's permission, I can't...<eos> She's in upstate New York.<eos> Agent May is at one of the best CDC facilities in the country.<eos> Why keep that from me?<eos> I could be there now.<eos> And would be.<eos> I know how much you like to make unauthorized trips, but I needed you here in case of a crisis, and now there's a cris...
Are you saying it was something else?<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> I'm sure it wasn't easy growing up where you did, but you were 1 in 10 from your high school to graduate from college and the only one to go on and get a PhD.<eos> You worked hard to provide for your sister and her kids, so I think you're a decent guy.<eos> Sure, some petty theft as a kid, but no history of violence.<eos> But then one bad situation turned into a manslaughter charge.<eos> I don't expect you to open up to a suit with a badge...<eos> Suits like you is why I'm in here.<eos> But there's a chance, if you help me, that I can help you get out of here.<eos> Let me get that for you, Agent May.
But there's a chance, if you help me, that I can help you get out of here.<eos> Let me get that for you, Agent May.<eos> Apologies.<eos> That must have been annoying.<eos> Incredibly.<eos> Oh, speaking of which...<eos> You seem to be feeling better, Agent May.<eos> No doubt in part to the care Aida has given to you.<eos> Aida's my assistant.<eos> She's been tending to you since...
Well, that's usually when I enter the picture.<eos> I'm hoping you can help me understand.<eos> Look, this is, uh...<eos> I don't want to get involved.<eos> I have to move on with my life.<eos> Any detail, even if it seems small, could lead us to something.<eos> I can't talk to the only other person related to this case because you put them in a coma.<eos> You're all I've got.<eos> Just point me in a direction.<eos> There's a direction for you.
Had to get a head start.<eos> We going after that book?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Something came up.<eos> Yo, listen, I held up my end of the deal, all right?<eos> Either we go and get after it, or I take my car, and I do it myself.<eos> That's not how things work here.<eos> We need to make a detour.<eos> We could use your help if you're still interested in our arrangement.<eos> That depends on you.
Hey, stop.<eos> Fitz, we could really use that exit.<eos> If I release the door, all the doors in cellblock A open.<eos> - The s-security wings, the exterior exits...<eos> Go, go!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.<eos> - Agent Simmons, can I trust you?
Ah. Also, we're live in 15 minutes.<eos> - About back there...<eos> - Forget it.<eos> Uh, I can't do that.<eos> That thing inside you is my responsibility.<eos> - No, it's mine.<eos> - And if you can't control it?<eos> My uncle can't know what I am.<eos> So I'll keep it down.<eos> Not for you, for him.
Get them!<eos> Where are the guards? !<eos> Where are the guards? !<eos> - Robbie, what are you doing here?<eos> - We're getting you out of here. - What?<eos> Step back, please.<eos> - No, no, don't.<eos> This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> - You're in danger.<eos> Lucy Bauer is here, and she's coming for you.
Don't see why this couldn't have been a phone call.<eos> Never underestimate the power of human connection.<eos> - Or should I say "Inhuman"? - Hmm.<eos> Either way, congratulations on those poll numbers.<eos> I have you to thank.<eos> You gave me no option but to tell the truth.<eos> Speaking of the truth, I went looking for some, and guess what I found?<eos> This is S.H.I.E.L.D. working with a former Agent, now known as Quake, a walking weapon of mass destruction.<eos> This one was new to me.<eos> New to you, too, I see.
I'll go.<eos> Just give me a few hours to pack, gather my equipment, and tie up some loose ends.<eos> I guess I wasn't clear.<eos> You have to leave now.<eos> Can you at least tell me where...<eos> The Quinjet is ready, sir.<eos> We're going together.<eos> No. The Quinjet's for me.<eos> I have my own mission.<eos> Uh, but this is for you.
Absolutely, it is.<eos> Whose is it?<eos> It's not yours.<eos> You're not the director anymore.<eos> I have just as much say in this as you do.<eos> What are you so angry about?<eos> Because you used to make decisions like that all the time, and then you stepped down.<eos> I did what was best for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Everybody is trying to do their best to prevent another tragedy... like Lincoln.<eos> For you and Daisy, that meant throwing in the towel, but we built Aida to protect agents like him.
- And what happens when he's not?<eos> - Then we deal with him.<eos> But right now, the reality is this ...<eos> Eli Morrow just wiped out an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. Tac Team with a few shards of carbon that he created out of thin air.<eos> And that's just what we've seen.<eos> What else is he capable of?<eos> We need the big guns on this one, and Yo-Yo, Daisy, and Reyes are the biggest guns we have.<eos> What about the science team?<eos> And I'm talking about Aida, specifically.<eos> I mean, she did, after all, bring you and Agent Fitz back from ... well, wherever the hell you were.
Look like he could afford to?<eos> Let alone hire two goons to mug you and steal your son's computer?<eos> No.<eos> But I'll tell you what he's more than capable of.<eos> Suing the next person that shows up at his front door asking questions about his relationship with your wife.<eos> Suing... or maybe worse.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Go home, Dr. McCord.<eos> Your family needs you.
It is the United States' opinion.<eos> Therefore, we're demanding the release of Bertilde Kalanga within two hours.<eos> If you do not comply, I'm prepared to impose a travel ban on all Angolan citizens into the United States.<eos> It would be a shame if Amalia Salessu were unable to finish her sophomore year at Stanford.<eos> But, of course, if she's no longer attending school out of the country, maybe she can get to know her half-sister better.<eos> Unless, of course, your daughter Lauana doesn't know she has a half-sister.<eos> I have to wonder, Elizabeth, at President Dalton's boldness in dictating the election procedures of a small African nation when he himself seems to be making up the rules as he goes along.<eos> You have enjoyed many years of generous support and aid from us with little accountability.<eos> But accountability comes in many forms, Damiano.<eos> I regret my years of loyalty mean so little to you.
You know, the thing is-- excuse me darling.<eos> Recasting the lead on a hit sitcom, isn't exactly drifting on morphine, now is it, Kevin?<eos> So unfortunately, my boy, you're not gonna be leaving the show.<eos> If you do, I'll be forced to Nagasaki your life and career.<eos> Hey, have you ever heard of the actor, uh, Taylor Jennings?<eos> I'm not familiar with the name.<eos> I Nagasaki'd him.<eos> So take the money, kid.<eos> Ride out the next couple years, all right?<eos> Otherwise, I'll make you a bigger laughingstock than you already are.
Because you're not the same man.<eos> In fact, you're not a man at all, really.<eos> You're parts of a man... the parts, scars and all, that Jekyll wanted to hide from the world.<eos> As a matter of fact, may... maybe that's what you should call yourself... "Mr. Hyde."<eos> Dr. Lydgate.<eos> I'm sorry, but have we met?<eos> No. I'm here on behalf of a mutual friend... Dr. Jekyll.<eos> I'm Mr. Hyde.<eos> Hyde?<eos> I don't believe Henry's ever mentioned you.
Is she someone you loved?<eos> With all my heart... until Hyde destroyed that love.<eos> Mary?<eos> Mr. Hyde?<eos> Apologies. I-I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Hyde, what are you doing here?<eos> Might I talk with you for a bit?<eos> You may.<eos> I must confess, you... left me quite curious the other night.<eos> I wonder why Henry's never mentioned you.
Hyde, what are you doing here?<eos> Might I talk with you for a bit?<eos> You may.<eos> I must confess, you... left me quite curious the other night.<eos> I wonder why Henry's never mentioned you.<eos> Have you known each other long?<eos> Oh, it feels like a lifetime.<eos> But I didn't come here to go on about myself.<eos> Actually, I'm here on Jekyll's behalf.<eos> The doctor has great feelings for you.
The doctor has great feelings for you.<eos> I care very much for Henry.<eos> But I don't think I could ever... be with him in that way.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look at his work.<eos> Things like... passion and desire are little more than... contaminants to be eliminated.<eos> I need someone who wants to bathe in their passion and give in to desire.<eos> I have a feeling you understand me, don't you, Mr. Hyde?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> When you walked into the parlor the other night, I saw the way the others looked at you.
I employed him as a driver.<eos> He's a, he's a good kid.<eos> Why?<eos> Employed?<eos> As in past tense?<eos> I hired him out of a crime prevention program that one of my companies helped fund.<eos> He had a background of petty crimes and drugs, but he impressed me when he spoke about needing an opportunity.<eos> I mean, everybody needs an opportunity, right?<eos> So I gave him a shot.<eos> So he works for you or not?
Hey Bobby?<eos> Do you think I'm paying you to fraternize?<eos> - Back to work.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Daisy Channing from the Gazette.<eos> Right.<eos> Marco DeSilva.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Mr. DeSilva, Hassan worked for you.
Don't make the mistake of underestimating this person, Detective.<eos> He doesn't just have people killing for him, he has them sending him pictures, evidence of his work.<eos> That is a highly sophisticated form of manipulation.<eos> The government of Hawaii has empowered us to do whatever is necessary to, uh, to catch whoever's responsible.<eos> So I need you to tell me what it's gonna take for you to come and work for us, temporarily, of course.<eos> I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm...<eos> I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.
No, it's not good enough.<eos> We don't have that kind of time.<eos> We need to break Rabbab.<eos> We're gonna do it right now.<eos> What's this?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Mr. Rabbab, we have, unfortunately, run out of time.<eos> Which means your opportunity to engage in a civilized exchange is no longer on the table.<eos> And because I am bound to specific rules of conduct, our parley has come to an end.<eos> Unfortunately, for you, those same rules don't apply to my friend from the United States.
No! I'm standing on her right now.<eos> Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> FBI!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Go!<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Stuart Barker, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
An exorcism.<eos> We dropped you in a dying parish, and you made good.<eos> You have something... an approachability and that thick head of hair of yours.<eos> This Homeless to Houses program you started is marvelous.<eos> We should replicate it in every parish.<eos> - This-this girl, this family...<eos> - You've been noticed.<eos> You've been noticed, Tomas.<eos> His Holiness' visit is a month away, and you're on the welcoming committee.<eos> It's a big month for the diocese, it's a big month for you.
He tell you to bugger off?<eos> He told me you left Aquinas after I saw you.<eos> You do exactly as you're told, don't you?<eos> That was a week ago.<eos> Been sightseeing.<eos> The Shedd Aquarium.<eos> The big shiny bean in the park.<eos> St. Anthony's of Lawndale, Chicago.<eos> Bit rough around the edges, your parish.<eos> The Church is looking for you.
Casey?<eos> Casey, are you okay?<eos> Jesus told his apostles how to cast out unclean spirits.<eos> "Fear them not," said the man, "for there is nothing covered<eos> "that shall not be revealed, nor hidden that shall not be known."<eos> You're deceiving yourself.<eos> Where there's a secret, there's shame.<eos> Shame is a weapon this demon will use against...<eos> I'm not ashamed of Jessica.<eos> - Who is she to you?
No shame in that.<eos> Will the Rance girl be at this community picnic?<eos> I want to see her before she knows who I am.<eos> Nothing happened since, just so you know.<eos> It's just a memory of something beautiful.<eos> You never gave up something beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.
What if it was actually true? That she had a husband?<eos> She didn't.<eos> I'd know. Are you sure?<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> You only saw each other in short bursts.<eos> I'd know.<eos> There.<eos> That fear in your voice.<eos> The fear that behind our masks, none of us are who we seem.<eos> That's primal for you.
Do you really want to follow in her footsteps?<eos> I'd walk through fire for her.<eos> Well, then,<eos> I think you'd better come with me.<eos> What's inside?<eos> A small, empty room. And what happens when I go in there?<eos> You fill it.<eos> Is that where she went?<eos> If you want to find her, you need to make a leap of faith.<eos> I don't trust you.
That's an interesting proposition.<eos> I think that we'd be happy to build you some options contracts.<eos> I'm not interested in paper.<eos> I was hoping you could introduce me to your, Malaysian buyer.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Bathroom. Definitely think we could do that.<eos> Miss?<eos> Miss, are you Tess?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is for you.
I love you.<eos> Mommy, what are these?<eos> Oh, those are just headache pills, sweetie.<eos> I guess Leo gets a lot of headaches.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> So, you'll tape today to air tonight.<eos> This interview is a get. Every network wanted it, but we hope Elizabeth Vargas is a friend of the court.<eos> What if she brings up the blackout?<eos> She won't, sir. The story's been contained.<eos> This is all about the country getting to know you.
Ah, you know what he's thinking.<eos> "Now I got to go arrest some white guy."<eos> Ain't nobody in this hood beast enough to cut out nobody's eyeballs.<eos> That's that crazy white boy 101.<eos> Like, you know he got to have two first names.<eos> Jonathan Percy Wilkerson.<eos> Or Richard Aaron McCoy.<eos> Yeah, but he go by "Dickie" 'cause he got a...<eos> You said they took the eyes?<eos> I didn't say it to you.
Her name is Julia.<eos> Was Julia.<eos> You're being unfair, Kat.<eos> I didn't know I was doing it.<eos> You know what's unfair?<eos> Committing an entire life to something that was taken away in 30 seconds.<eos> My knee is garbage now, okay?<eos> Your knee?<eos> You pushed... one class, three classes...<eos> I was looking for you all day.
Your knee?<eos> You pushed... one class, three classes...<eos> I was looking for you all day.<eos> Last pew.<eos> Crackerjack work, detective.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> 41 years of sobriety, poverty, chastity.<eos> More or less.<eos> I'm allowed the indulgence.<eos> What they did to you today, it was...
You get unassailable proof. And don't you worry, 'cause that much is coming.<eos> Get your evidence, run to the bishop, and if you're lucky, he'll send someone.<eos> God put you in my head for a reason. Why? I don't know why.<eos> You know what happens if you defy the Church?<eos> You walk into that room without any skill, without any training, it's not just your career on the line, Tomas.<eos> It's your immortal soul.<eos> It'll take you.<eos> It'll destroy you.<eos> That's a ghost I don't want in my head.<eos> I'll not be responsible for you.
Priya, listen to me<eos> Let go of me<eos> You always do this, it's always other women<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you<eos> Every time you say the same thing<eos> You know how much I love you<eos> Please, listen to me<eos> I love you so much<eos> Cut!<eos> Kaira, good for you?
Sorry, I'll just...<eos> No it's okay, go ahead meet them I have to go pee anyway<eos> Table for 4 please?<eos> I'm sorry guys, we have a strict dress code<eos> No shorts and slippers please<eos> Come on, it's his birthday<eos> I'm sorry, wish I could<eos> But she's wearing shorts!<eos> It's okay for girls, I'm sorry guys<eos> Just this once, only for you
What are you doing!<eos> It's all good!<eos> Hey look, Sid!<eos> Shit!<eos> Where?<eos> That's not Sid, Jackie<eos> He looked so much like him... cute<eos> Poor thing, nice guy he was<eos> Really nice<eos> Little too nice for you right?
'Brain Doctor', my therapist<eos> Oh 'BD'... Raunak you're still going to that 'BU?<eos> I have to<eos> 'Brain Doctor'?<eos> Why are you seeing a therapist?<eos> Are you mad?<eos> Who isn't?<eos> Look at him<eos> That's a cut, nice<eos> Good for you Kaira?

This is why some people should not drink
The film industry doesn't have more gay people, it's just more accepting... there must be many gay people in your office too... but sadly they have to hide the fact<eos> So, are you?<eos> A 'lesbo?<eos> No, unfortunately not<eos> So why don't you settle down?<eos> We're just worried about you Koko<eos> If you keep hanging with these filmy men... how will you find a nice boy'?<eos> Filmy men are okay for checking out abs, but not okay to marry?<eos> L-low much junk you Keep eating<eos> I've made all this for you... eat this

What a revelation<eos> Kaira I came here to...<eos> I don't want to do this, get out<eos> What are you doing Kaira?<eos> Just get out!<eos> Koko, are you sure about this?<eos> I know with all these personal issues... working with Raghu will be tough... but this was your big break<eos> Okay Jack<eos> Sometimes we choose a tough path just because... we believe that to achieve important things... we have to choose the tough option<eos> But sometimes you need to choose the easier option... because at that time that is the best option for you
You figured it out yourself...<eos> But the dangling camera?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Just like my future, it's hanging in the air<eos> Maybe you should sit on my chair... and I should sit here from today<eos> It's so cool<eos> I wish the whole world could hear about your chair theory<eos> Why is it important for the whole world to hear this?<eos> No I just... if they understand this chair theory they will stop judging others... and what a beautiful world it will be<eos> No Kaira... when you understand yourself well... then what others think of you doesn't matter

Pink Floyd's first album, you have to get this<eos> "I agree, you're the most beautiful of all"<eos> "§ agree, you find a place in every heart" You like strawberries?<eos> "Yes you are a dream your every move is a charm..."<eos> "but, you're not one to be wooed by praise"<eos> Try some?<eos> Can we just have the music off please!<eos> I'm sorry, I just need some silence<eos> Everything okay'?<eos> I wrote this song for you

So still suffering silently?<eos> Or did you say it?<eos> I yelled it<eos> So he ran away?<eos> No, he was very sweet actually<eos> He stopped playing the song, which he had composed for me... and began asking about me<eos> I felt guilty at first but...<eos> Why are romantic relationships so irritating?<eos> With friends, it's all so easy, it just flows... you don't need to make such an effort<eos> Who are the 5 people closest to you?
Cinematographer actually<eos> One and the same thing<eos> No, it's not the same thing It's not?<eos> - No<eos> Okay<eos> What do you do?<eos> I'm a techie... does that sound boring?<eos> Fun<eos> It's fun, then cheers<eos> So, why should I be interested in you?
What do you mean by 'tough?<eos> Tough my foot!<eos> L-low could you just abandon me'?<eos> L-low could you just do that'?<eos> L-low could you just do that'?<eos> L-low could you both leave me and go'?<eos> And the only reason you took me back was because I failed the 2nd grade... yes, I failed the 2nd grade!<eos> Shame Shame!<eos> Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!<eos> Such an embarrassment for you... that you left everything and came back to India?
L-low could you just do that'?<eos> L-low could you both leave me and go'?<eos> And the only reason you took me back was because I failed the 2nd grade... yes, I failed the 2nd grade!<eos> Shame Shame!<eos> Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!<eos> Such an embarrassment for you... that you left everything and came back to India?<eos> And when I was finally happy living with my grandparents, you dragged me away from there too<eos> You separated me even from them<eos> Yes President's Award just for that!<eos> And I have a firecracking news for you!
I wish there were teachers like you in school<eos> I'm no teacher<eos> Okay not teacher but... you know what I mean<eos> We are all our own teachers in the school of life<eos> Okay, that got a bit heavy<eos> Life is like a jigsaw puzzle<eos> People like me can help you find the missing pieces... and put them back together... but, only you can complete the puzzle<eos> So now that this is over... can we meet outside of this... just as friends or something?<eos> No this is not possible Kaira<eos> And what if I tell you... that I like you...

Brown, black, Asian.<eos> That's all you picture.<eos> Reassess that.<eos> Start picturing white people.<eos> Look at Greg.<eos> He looks like a regular white guy, but has an accent.<eos> You didn't see that coming.<eos> You need to start picturing white people with your immigrants, because they look like regular white people. What's your name?<eos> Hello.<eos> No, the white guy behind you, Asian guy. The Asian guy's like,
Then Sollecito changes his version of the events.<eos> He turned his back on Amanda.<eos> He says, "So far I've told a bunch of lies, because she told me to say them.<eos> The truth is I was home that night.<eos> Amanda wasn't with me and didn't come back until 1:00 a.m."<eos> Let's put ourselves in Amanda's shoes.<eos> You go to the police station with your boyfriend.<eos> You are in a different room and don't know what he's saying.<eos> Then at a certain point they come to tell you,<eos> "Your boyfriend... he's turned on you."
Mr. President.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> We have a briefing<eos> - waiting for you in the Oval, sir. - Good.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - Wyatt, right?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Sir, I just have to warn you.<eos> This might be a bit more hectic than you're used to. I-I understand.
I'm trying to find a way to unite us at Kirkman's remarks at the rubble, but Michigan is probably just the beginning.<eos> The world is falling apart.<eos> Probably don't want to put that in the speech.<eos> Yes, I'm still here.<eos> God, it's unbelievable.<eos> I like Wynbrandt.<eos> He went to city college at night, law school, good family man.<eos> Massey's our guy.<eos> He clerked for Thomas, he went to Yale, editor of the Law Journal.<eos> It's all about what's on paper for you.
Do we know anything about the condition of the boy, the one in the Michigan?<eos> He's in surgery with internal bleeding.<eos> He knows we're calling, sir.<eos> He doesn't care. I want to talk to a couple lawyers from the Attorney General's Office.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> How old is he?<eos> - Danny Fayad, ma'am.<eos> We have a couple A.G. candidates who could be helpful.<eos> Bring them in.<eos> Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
- Okay.<eos> Tom, the boy... he's 17...<eos> Penny needs me.<eos> I got to go.<eos> I don't have to explain myself to you Hannah.<eos> I gave the President what I determined was the most relevant intel.<eos> Or you gave him what the group who did this wanted you to give him.<eos> How can he lead if he doesn't have all the facts?<eos> Then you should have given them to me.<eos> Look, it's not... that I don't belive you, or that I don't want to.
Someone tortured him to death within the last 24 hours.<eos> It was barrios.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> anyone else worried about those?<eos> I mean, they're for us, right?<eos> There.<eos> That's everything on the ledger.<eos> Go.<eos> You got what you came for.<eos> We came for the ledger and you.
No. Look, I'm just saying... good luck out there, all right?<eos> Governor Royce, this is quite the welcome committee.<eos> Emily Rhodes, Special Adviser to President Kirkman.<eos> I am here to observe the IAC's protest.<eos> Yeah, I know why you're here, and I suggest you and your staff get back on that plane and return to Washington.<eos> Um, we're here to help, sir.<eos> Yeah, well, as President Reagan said, the nine scariest words in the English language are,<eos> "I'm with the government, and I'm here to help."<eos> Mm. I got enough to worry about without you people interfering.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, sir, but that's not really a decision for you to make.
Mike, a panic button?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm going to my firm.<eos> You don't need to worry.<eos> The only thing I'll be in danger of is a few bad lawyer jokes.<eos> Mrs. Kirkman, it's my job to worry.<eos> You're too good.<eos> Hold on, ma'am.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ma'am, the president needs you.
Governor, let's go.<eos> Is this really how you want today to end?<eos> With heavily armed soldiers dragging peaceful protestors off to jail while the nation watches?<eos> You won't be the hero of that story.<eos> You think you're pretty clever, don't you?<eos> I have an offer for you.<eos> Send these people home and fly with me to D.C. for a sit-down with the president.<eos> Claim his attention as a victory. Spin it however you want.<eos> Why the hell should I go with you?<eos> Because standing in the schoolhouse doorway didn't work for George Wallace, and it isn't gonna work for you.
If you give him a chance, I think you will, too.<eos> Rest of this looks great.<eos> Just get rid of those two paragraphs, move that up.<eos> Should be fine.<eos> Did you hear the rumor?<eos> There's a rising star in the White House Communications office.<eos> That's cold, man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That poor guy is probably halfway to Dubuque by now.<eos> I was talking about you.
He had a good reason for not being in his seat when the bomb went off.<eos> I tried to tear his story apart.<eos> I talked to mall security in Oregon. I got phone records.<eos> I wanted him to be guilty of something so then I could blame him for surviving when no one else did!<eos> You know what the truth is?<eos> The truth is that Peter MacLeish is just a lucky guy.<eos> He survived, and Scott didn't, and I need to start dealing with that.<eos> That's fair.<eos> You know, you are a pain in my ass more often than you're not?<eos> But you are also passionate and persistent. And that's what makes you one of the best agents I have.
Was I... Was I doing something?<eos> "Oh, me, was I..."<eos> You think that if you appeal to my vanity and let me make your costume and name you, that I'm just going to let you out of the DEO.<eos> That hadn't even crossed my mind.<eos> Us just sneaking out for a little bit, you know, just two new friends, right, running a...<eos> Running a couple of field tests, living out our dreams, not getting in trouble.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Damn you, Mon-El of Daxam.<eos> I'm so weak.<eos> Hey, chief, I got something for you.
Your cause is pure greed, Mr. Miner.<eos> Which is fine.<eos> I don't hold it against you.<eos> But my cause is something far nobler.<eos> I'm fighting for my children.<eos> My son, my daughter.<eos> Their lives depend on the successful attainment of my goal.<eos> To end alien influence over our planet.<eos> I'm trying to save the world from an alien apocalypse.<eos> Do you really think I'm afraid of you?
You wanted to see me?<eos> Yeah, thank you for coming.<eos> I wanted to invited you to my party.<eos> Kara Danvers told me you were going on with the fundraiser.<eos> You can't.<eos> It's definitely going to be a target for this gang.<eos> Well, that's why I need you there to protect it.<eos> With Supergirl in attendance, I know my guests and I will be safe.<eos> You like to take risks, don't you?<eos> When Corben was after you and now this.
Have I ever been wrong before?<eos> Okay, this time I'm sure.<eos> I see Lena.<eos> Commence Operation Doubtfire.<eos> Lena!<eos> Kara, it's really great to see you.<eos> I'm glad you could come.<eos> Um, have you seen Supergirl?<eos> I'm sure she's on her way.<eos> Oh, I am so... Did I spill this on you?
I've noticed that the belladonna flourishes, though.<eos> What do you use it for?<eos> Extreme cases.<eos> The man I saw yesterday?<eos> Difficult, but not hopeless.<eos> How many days?<eos> It's been a week now.<eos> So...<eos> Marcus Keane.<eos> Father Bennett speaks admiringly of you.
A boy.<eos> I lost him.<eos> I don't lose.<eos> Ever?<eos> Ever.<eos> Well, then, Welcome to the Mere Mortals Club.<eos> They took my collar.<eos> Is it the collar and the wimple that supply our power?<eos> Partly, yeah.<eos> The gift doesn't reside in you or me.
Is it the collar and the wimple that supply our power?<eos> Partly, yeah.<eos> The gift doesn't reside in you or me.<eos> The gift is God's alone.<eos> These are excuses.<eos> You might do well to keep your ego out of it.<eos> What am I supposed to do, then?<eos> Use your Litany of Loreto, the Invocation of the Virgin Mary?<eos> I suppose you could call ours a more feminine approach.<eos> Didn't quite work for you, though, did it?
- You're back.<eos> - Yeah, well. It turns out I've got unfinished business in Chicago.<eos> Join my club.<eos> "Join the club," I think, is how our flag-waving friends say it.<eos> You've been practicing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I take it the demon has manifested?<eos> Mm-hmm, yes.<eos> So what are you waiting for?<eos> You.

Mr. Peeps.<eos> Bye.<eos> I pay a lot for my privacy.<eos> Who told you how to reach me?<eos> Mrs. Goff, no one.<eos> The real estate you own, it's like a revolving door... houses, buildings, bought and sold... except one.<eos> It's been in your family for 80 years.<eos> First duplex my father ever bought.<eos> He said it was our lucky charm.<eos> Family is incredibly important to you.
It's because someone has to do the right thing.<eos> You what? !<eos> Carl, it's not stealing, mate.<eos> Just... just think of it as recycling.<eos> Look, just bring it back here like I told you.<eos> Don't get many visitors, then?<eos> Well, I wasn't expecting anyone, was I?<eos> I just needed to get out of the house.<eos> I could hear Mum on the phone having a go at you as well.<eos> A cheeseburger and a large fries for you.
No.<eos> I've got plenty of company.<eos> I'm being serious.<eos> They're not real people, Dad.<eos> Of course they are.<eos> Yeah, but... you don't actually know them, they're strangers.<eos> I feel like I know them.<eos> Was it like that with that woman who jumped?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was, erm talking to my friend Aisha about you. About your job.
Of course they are.<eos> Yeah, but... you don't actually know them, they're strangers.<eos> I feel like I know them.<eos> Was it like that with that woman who jumped?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was, erm talking to my friend Aisha about you. About your job.<eos> And you know what she said?<eos> She said, "Your dad's like an angel."<eos> Angels live up in the sky like you and try and protect people, too.<eos> Well, then I have to make you a set of wings, Dad, would you like that?
He was a wrestler, for one.<eos> 300 fights, only lost once.<eos> What do you know about Lincoln?<eos> I'm his bodyguard.<eos> Why aren't you guarding him, then?<eos> He's next door, watching the play.<eos> Hey, Mr. Booth. Wife's been asking when we're gonna be seeing you on stage again.<eos> Soon.<eos> You crave affection. You do.<eos> Now, I have no fortune, but I'm spilling over with affections, which I am ready to pour over you like applesauce over roast pork.
I just had an unsuccessful evening with a girl, so nothing, really.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My sister's gone.<eos> Gone?<eos> Gone where?<eos> Gone as in erased from history.<eos> Something that Flynn did or we did to the "Hindenburg" has changed my family.<eos> My mother isn't sick anymore, and my sister was never born.<eos> Lucy, we have a dossier on you, and it doesn't say anything about a sister.
Juliet Shakes... man.<eos> Are you an actress?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Not a very good one.<eos> Just starting out.<eos> Something rarer than an actress:<eos> a modest one.<eos> General Grant was supposed to attend tonight's play, but he can't make it and I have to return his tickets.<eos> Well, I'll take the tickets to the box office for you.
Well, I'll take the tickets to the box office for you.<eos> I'd like to leave a note too with the general's apologies.<eos> Of course.<eos> Take your time.<eos> You know, my father's coming to the play tonight.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> It's... not very good.<eos> No?<eos> Should I tell him not to come?<eos> Having President Lincoln for a father, what is that like for you?
I need to make sure he's on it.<eos> You take care of Wyatt.<eos> We're gonna need you tonight.<eos> This is gonna be the worst game of Operation ever.<eos> Go on.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Miss Shakesman?<eos> Mr. Lincoln.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Following you, it seems.
Mr. Robert Todd Lincoln downstairs for Miss Shakesman.<eos> I'll be down in a minute.<eos> Now, please. You'll save Secretary of State Seward?<eos> And you'll save Vice President Johnson? Yeah, we got it.<eos> Lucy, just... think about who you save.<eos> You wouldn't treat him as some other people would when you found out that he was not the inheritor of that fortune.<eos> Not the heir of the fortune?<eos> No.<eos> You people bark up the wrong tree about the old man's property.<eos> Which he left to you.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Uh, never mind.<eos> I found something.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm-I'm intruding.<eos> - I wanted to see it, you know...<eos> You're Dr. Wade, aren't you?<eos> That's right.<eos> And your Mrs. Lund.<eos> I've heard so much about you, just...
That is the one and only statement that resembles the truth.<eos> Be, be reasonable, please.<eos> The Pope has no reason to envy a sick old priest who's devastated by very grave accusations.<eos> Your thesis doesn't hold together.<eos> Let me reveal something to you, Father Gutierrez: you don't matter.<eos> Not at all.<eos> You can stay in Queens until the day I die, but it won't change a thing.<eos> The Pope can't get to the bottom of things with me and he knows it perfectly well.<eos> Because it would mean the pure pandemonium.<eos> I pity you, Gutierrez, because you're just a bit player in a cheap piece of amateur theatricals organized by your Pope.

Because only you and I saw it, out of the whole world.<eos> I felt close to you.
Your mother is still alive too.<eos> And you'll find her.<eos> Now... at last time to die.<eos> Bring me back.<eos> Bring me back.<eos> To what do I owe the honor of your presence?<eos> I have orders to accompany you to the Vatican, where you'll be given a fair trial.<eos> We have a flight for Rome tomorrow afternoon.<eos> It'll only be a big waste of time.<eos> For me and for you.
No one.<eos> We don't just have that testimony.<eos> Really?<eos> What else do you think you have?<eos> This is Kurtwell...<eos> Hello, Lenny.<eos> Even though you let it ring and ring, I know that you were waiting for my call.<eos> Do you really want me to come to Rome to be subjected to a trial and found guilty?<eos> I'm afraid it's absolutely necessary.<eos> Then one second after I land in Rome, you are gonna see all the things I have on you on all the newspapers of the world.
Very good, Gutierrez.<eos> Very good.<eos> I beg of you, confide in me... the wisest thing you have ever learned.<eos> In the end, more than in God, it is necessary to believe in yourself, Lenny.<eos> Have you got something... a little better?<eos> That's a banal platitude.<eos> If only you knew how true a banal platitude can be, my dear colleague.<eos> After all, look at us, we are power.<eos> And power is a banal platitude.<eos> We will be dealing with you one day, Your Holiness.
When an orphan matures, he may discover a fresh youth within.<eos> And at that point, he will have something to say.<eos> You have something to say,<eos> I know it, I feel it, and you will say it.<eos> Your Holiness, you will say it... you'll say it.<eos> You will say it.<eos> You'll say it.<eos> You have a very tight family, Eminence, very affectionate.<eos> It has been a lovely Christmas Eve.<eos> May I be indiscreet, Your Holiness, and say something that concerns you personally?
And where does he live there?<eos> That's something I have to find out.<eos> - Sorry, sorry.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Excuse me, sir.<eos> - Please.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Holy Father...<eos> I got you something stupid, it has no real worth, but I saw it and I thought of you.
- Please.<eos> - Excuse me, sir.<eos> - Please.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Holy Father...<eos> I got you something stupid, it has no real worth, but I saw it and I thought of you.<eos> It says here you can see more than 100 metres.<eos> Holy Father, the manager of the restaurant and all the staff wonder if you'd be willing to give a benediction.<eos> They're all behind you waiting.
That's quite a chat history.<eos> You know the Agency covers prep now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You look stressed.<eos> - I just have a lot on my mind.<eos> - Yeah. Well, I've already charmed half of Langley with a career's worth of cocktail-party chatter, and I'm still green as a solar farm.<eos> You better keep up, or you'll look bad.<eos> I'll try and remember that.<eos> Hey, Owen.<eos> Um... This hard for you, too?
That's what this scenario is all about.<eos> It didn't start when you put these on.<eos> It's been all week.<eos> You were testing us.<eos> Last on the Murder Board for no reason.<eos> Not just you.<eos> Everyone. We've been manipulating you all week.<eos> Even people here are in on it.<eos> To see how we handle it.<eos> Good for you.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Hey, we're in luck.<eos> Police found this dog coming out of the woods near where you were.<eos> It's not Cormac.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Come on, take a close look.<eos> See if that's your dog.<eos> It's not Cormac!<eos> Ok, Todd.<eos> All right, I believe you.
Get up.<eos> I have some good news, Todd.<eos> We found Cormac.<eos> He's not lost anymore.<eos> He's safe.<eos> Safe and happy.<eos> How'd you find him?<eos> It was the food you left out.<eos> You saved his life, Todd.<eos> He's safe because of you.
Did he say "jail"?<eos> He said "jail"" Jail.<eos> Now's the time when you find a way to help us out.<eos> Fast. Right.<eos> Well, actually, um, I'm not supposed to know this, but I figured out a way to access the security cameras.<eos> See, I have a teeny-tiny problem with voyeurism.<eos> Which I blame on menopause.<eos> And my husband... Well, he's my ex.<eos> I mean, would that help or was that TMI?<eos> After you, Diane.
Besides, she's irreplaceable.<eos> I wish that were true, Beale, but it's not.<eos> For any of us.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you the doctor?<eos> No, I work with Agent Blye.<eos> I'm Julia Feldman.<eos> Kensi's mom.<eos> Owen Granger.<eos> She's spoken of you.
You're lying, Alicia.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> Your only child.<eos> You know, it's sad when our loved ones don't live up to our high standards.<eos> What do you know?<eos> What do I know?<eos> I know young Sienna isn't half the agent her mother is.<eos> That if she were, her career might've lasted a little longer.<eos> How'd you get those men to kill for you?

But... I want to know how... how you convinced them to kill for you.
Sienna, your daughter.<eos> You send her to Quantico, speak at her graduation, get her a job as a profiler, and she ends up dead at the hands of a serial killer.<eos> No!<eos> No! You think you're safe behind there!<eos> You think you're safe!<eos> You are not safe from me!<eos> I am gonna get you!<eos> You are not safe behind there!<eos> You're not safe from me!<eos> I am gonna come for you!
What's her address?<eos> Dr. Gray?<eos> Five-O.<eos> Clear.<eos> Clear.<eos> Lou, Jer, find Dr. Gray.<eos> You know what she's doing, don't you?<eos> Dr. Gray is setting you up.<eos> You take care of us, she takes care of you.<eos> I would stop talking if I were you.
He lives for his wife and kids.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I don't get any of this.<eos> From the jump, Flynn's been five steps ahead of us.<eos> I'm sick of it.<eos> Let's get ahead of him for once.<eos> The name Christy Pitt mean anything to you?<eos> - Never heard of her.<eos> - Rufus, find out who she is. Meantime, we're not gonna find Flynn.<eos> Flynn's gonna find you.
He's with me.<eos> My usual driver is sick today.<eos> Hello, Ms. Campbell.<eos> The general's expecting you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> General.<eos> Judith.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you called.<eos> - Mm. - It made my night.<eos> Well, if a call made your night, then what I have planned for you will make your whole month.
Anthony!<eos> Give me the suitcase.<eos> I can't.<eos> You can't give Flynn an atomic bomb.<eos> There is no means to an end that justifies this.<eos> I know you, Anthony.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> Judith! Are you okay?<eos> I didn't know. I wouldn't have helped him if I knew about the bomb.<eos> I believe you. Okay?
This isn't the first time Eva has vanished like this.<eos> Five years ago, it was a surprise trip to Thailand after we got married.<eos> Two years ago, she turned off her phone and holed up in a motel.<eos> Last year, when she was writing the book, there was a suicide attempt.<eos> What happened to her years ago was horrible.<eos> Her mother being taken like that.<eos> But after that, she just never really got her life together.<eos> It's always been hard for her.<eos> You know, trusting people.<eos> She trust you?
The whole point of the spikes is so you won't touch them.<eos> Me?<eos> You nearly bonked me to death.<eos> Didn't Mom and Dad teach you anything about hunting rock safety?<eos> Didn't Mom and Dad teach you anything about doing what I say?<eos> No way.<eos> I'm in charge of me.<eos> You be in charge of you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then from now on, you can be in charge of you on that side.
Have you seen Peter?<eos> Aw, he was just here!<eos> Daddy, what's this about?<eos> Did Peter screw something up at work?<eos> No, I'm here because I've got important news.<eos> Lois, everyone, I've left your mother, and Tricia Takanawa is moving in with me.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> What? !<eos> I wanted you to know. I'm in love!<eos> Well, good for you for being honest, Carter.
The truth is all I ever wanted was to some day have a family of my own.<eos> And I realized Carter could give me all of that.<eos> A family all your own?<eos> Yes.<eos> A family just like this, in fact, with a fine son just like you, Peter.<eos> A son to whom I could one day give a piece of sour plum candy.<eos> Thank you, Mama Tricia!<eos> But a lazy son who does not make me proud?<eos> Peter, that son deserves no candy.<eos> I swear, Mama Tricia, I'm gonna make you the proudest Tiger Mom of all!
Right, well, I'm sorry.<eos> They, um, shouldn't be contacting you directly.<eos> Is that all you have to say?<eos> You sold me out.<eos> You had them send some goon to threaten me and my family.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'd never do that.<eos> You're like a son to me.<eos> Now, for you to think that I would...<eos> I don't know what to think of you.
Okay.<eos> Anything?<eos> Yeah, here it is.<eos> Simon Delaney.<eos> Apparently, he's also an officer of three other LLCs connected to Garcia.<eos> Which means three more possible drug-laundering companies.<eos> Is Garcia's name on the title?<eos> I'll have to find out, but if so...<eos> We might have enough for an indictment.<eos> Mm-hmm. There's a Special Agent Pride on the phone for you.
Do you have the blueprints?<eos> Had.<eos> They were in our offices in the sub-basement of the Capitol.<eos> I gave the digital plans to the guys on site.<eos> You might want to check over there.<eos> Okay, I will. - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Next time, wait your turn like everyone else.<eos> Thank you for taking the time, Mr. President.<eos> I'll always make time for you, Kimble.
Every detail.<eos> It is not a personal issue for us, so I don't see why it should be a political one.<eos> It shouldn't be... except Jeffrey Myers has been telling everyone in his federal prison in Pennsylvania that he's the father of your son.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Mrs. Kirkman.<eos> Ma'am, does... does Leo know... that the President might not be his father?<eos> You haven't said a word.<eos> What the hell do you want me to say?<eos> That you believe me.<eos> Of course I believe you.
Entshuldigen Sie?<eos> I'd like to thank our Japanese friends as well.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is a private meeting.<eos> Now it is.<eos> Everyone.<eos> You sent eight highly trained men to kill one civilian on a train.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Katarina Wagner must really have something on you.
Turns out the two victims' travel and investment portfolios were backed by shell companies that siphon money from government accounts.<eos> Definitely not an art scholar or a restaurateur.<eos> So Elizabeth was right. They're all spies.<eos> It looks like it.<eos> And Charles Kessler's State Department job is a classic official CIA cover.<eos> Vague, boring job title, vague, boring job description.<eos> Any luck tracking him down?<eos> He hasn't used his cell phone or his credit card since the museum, and no hits on any of his vehicles, either.<eos> He's laying low.<eos> Well, probably smart when a trained killer with a grudge is after you.
- Of course not.<eos> Uh, sorry to interrupt...<eos> That's all right.<eos> What do you got?<eos> I think I figured out how to decode the black hole photo.<eos> From Mayfair's USB drive?<eos> How?<eos> Patterson's been stumped on that for months.<eos> Shadowcat.<eos> I've got a job for you, off the books.
We have more than we think.<eos> You're back.<eos> I'm Jane.<eos> Hello, Jane.<eos> I've been listening, and I understand, um, you want to be loyal to your family.<eos> I struggle with that myself.<eos> But your family tried to frame you for murder.<eos> They know you're sick, they know how long you have, and they know you won't make bail.<eos> But they're prepared for you to spend the rest of whatever life you have left in a cell, away from your wife and daughter.<eos> Loyalty is a noble value, but you can't let it blind you, and when it counted, those people weren't there for you.
Stay with me, okay?<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> We gotta get out of this stairwell.<eos> You got it. Give me the keycard. - Melly.<eos> - I can't.<eos> You tipped off Donahue?<eos> You got out.<eos> I work for him now.<eos> Why didn't you just give him the tapes?<eos> Because I... I needed you to get into the safe.
Mrs. Clarkson... No, I mean it.<eos> This is not your cross to bear.<eos> There was nothing more you could do.<eos> Just promise me this: that you will do everything you can to find who did this and bring them to justice... so they can't hurt anybody else.<eos> I promise you I'm gonna do more than that,<eos> Mrs. Clarkson.<eos> I can't give you any of the details... but we believe your boy is still alive.<eos> What?<eos> Wha...<eos> My team and I-- we're gonna do everything we can to bring him home to you, safe.
Financially did it make sense? To take the $10,000 versus continue to get...<eos> Well, I wasn't going to get...<eos> I mean, it was very clear that Lyle wasn't going to continue to publish it.<eos> So if Lyle Stuart was not going to publish the book, but he was asking if you would take a $10,000 payout and continue to be published, why did you not choose to have Lyle Stuart just not publish the book?<eos> It's a hard question.<eos> I think probably I thought that the book was just going to die its own death.<eos> The $10,000 was welcome.<eos> Um, I was living on a teacher's salary.<eos> Um...<eos> Was that an opportunity for you to...
"My country has been stolen from me and I'm a patriot.<eos> I'm a freedom fighter."<eos> He was an impressionable adolescent.<eos> He really literally was a schoolboy.<eos> He crafted an identity for himself and then acted on that identity.<eos> He had the courage of his convictions, as misguided as those may be, and by accident suddenly sets the world on fire.<eos> It's almost like that butterfly effect.<eos> Tiny event here, huge consequences somewhere else.<eos> That story fascinated me.<eos> And none of the description that you just offered you think applies to you?
Thank you.<eos> You couldn't find the lost lamb, I see.<eos> Oh, well, we found it, but it was too late.<eos> The night was just too cold.<eos> We can't build up the flock this way.<eos> The winters are too long and the flock is too small.<eos> The weather, it will turn.<eos> And Wilby's the best tracking dog I've ever known.<eos> Mother, we'll be fine.<eos> I know what the farm means to you.
Captain Jiang.<eos> Your wife left you because you beat her, right?<eos> She knows soccer?<eos> She happens to be a fan of Ronaldo.<eos> What about your wife?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> You say she's your ex.<eos> No...<eos> Because your are not divorced, she's still your wife.<eos> What do you think your wife said about you to that man?
So, now we all now.<eos> Zhida won't blow up the third bomb because there isn't a bomb in the gym.<eos> Don't you see this wasn't his point?<eos> I know.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Get that lady out of here.<eos> - Now hold on.<eos> - Stop there, OK?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The people are assuming that the situation was a plot between you and Zhida.
Been working at a little music shop, in the back room, you know, cleaning and, uh, repairing instruments.<eos> It keeps me busy.<eos> Although it keeps my hands cracked, too.<eos> A friend from N.A. got me the job.<eos> N.A.?<eos> Narcotics Anonymous.<eos> Been clean for over five years.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's really good for you.
My... my husband went out of town for work last month and it was for the first time he's ever been away from home for the night.<eos> And Randall slept in my bed with me.<eos> Not because he was scared, but because he didn't want me to be scared.<eos> He's a sweet boy.<eos> He is a very, very sweet boy.<eos> Spent the last nine years wondering if I did the right thing.<eos> But I didn't even know your last name to look you up in the phone book.<eos> Seems like it was right, though.<eos> For him.<eos> He's, um... he's been asking about you.
Anything?<eos> -Do you have a used bike section? -We do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, I just want something that's, like... worn in, like a little rough around the edges.<eos> -Yeah. -Um...<eos> I dunno. I told a friend that I ride and I don't know why I did that.<eos> -So if you could just help me out. -Well, we got those.<eos> We got those. We got some used ones.<eos> -Here, let me show you what we got. -Okay.<eos> -I like you.
I have no idea who wrote those guidelines, but I'm trying to prepare these young women for success in the real world where they aren't gonna be coddled by some namby-pamby vice principal.<eos> That-a-way, Rebecca, fight for that ball.<eos> [casting director] No fighting, Rebecca, this is a non-violent, safe space for learning.<eos> Are you gonna let me coach my team or what?<eos> I came to tell you that you missed the sensitivity training workshop last week, so you need to schedule a make-up time.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> This school is already too sensitive.<eos> The parents have voted to make the workshop mandatory.<eos> Then tell them they can talk to me directly if they have a problem.<eos> They're all afraid of you, Coach Kendall.
- Yeah, you know, no harm in it, right?<eos> Hey, I wanna invite you to a little event I'm hosting tomorrow night at Trap23.<eos> - It should be a good time.<eos> - Uh, I got some stuff going on tomorrow, but thanks. - Yeah...<eos> - Yeah, the lieutenant, he's more of a neighborhood bar kind of a guy, but, um, I'm down for whatever, so... same here.<eos> Whatever, whenever.<eos> Hey, if your plans change.<eos> We got more in common than you think, Lieutenant.<eos> Severide.<eos> Officer Crawford at CPD is on the phone for you.
I'm out...<eos> - For good.<eos> It's time for you to step up.<eos> Stella Bella.<eos> No.<eos> Matt.<eos> I appreciate your support in there.<eos> I think this measure's going to accomplish a lot.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I'm real happy for you, Dearing.
Between the bright young star, Casey, and the old sellout, Dearing.<eos> That's what you called us experienced aldermen in your campaign, right?<eos> - Well, I'm sorry if I offended you, Alderman.<eos> You can forget hanging that DCFS threat over me.<eos> I'm only here to do some good for the people of Chicago.<eos> The minute I can't do that anymore, I'll walk away.<eos> You don't care about a career in politics.<eos> That's fine.<eos> But I bet you care about your girlfriend keeping your foster kid.<eos> I'll call you later in the week.
Captain!<eos> Hurry! Hurry!<eos> Chinese?<eos> Move it!<eos> (Burmese) Who are you people?<eos> Why did you save me?<eos> Ammo!<eos> Hermes!<eos> We have enemies in pursuit!<eos> We're right behind you, Captain!
Chief.<eos> What's going on? Here.<eos> Here is five million US dollars.<eos> Naw Khar said one million is for what you did at the Mekong River.<eos> As for the rest, please make it clean and deposit it to his account at the Golden Triangle Casino.<eos> I thought the deal was 1.5 million?<eos> Naw Khar felt that Boss was against him because you are not doing a good job.<eos> San Kyi, Boss has been unhappy with Naw Khar for some time now.<eos> Just so you know, under the current circumstances, the Naw Khar era could end anytime if Boss so chooses to.<eos> As for you, my friend, I always thought you have great potential.
P'Som, can you spare me? !<eos> Don't let Naw Khar get taken by the Chinese!<eos> Bingo, it's your turn to strike.<eos> I'm counting on you.<eos> Go!<eos> GO, Bingo!<eos> Bingo!<eos> Bingo!<eos> Captain, do you copy?<eos> Captain, I'm right behind you.
Maybe never.<eos> We lost a good man bringing Nassar back alive.<eos> We better get something for it.<eos> Well, sir, let's focus on the positive.<eos> The Nassar raid is a win.<eos> Your approval numbers ticked up another two points today...<eos> - I don't care about approval numbers.<eos> - He doesn't care about approval numbers. Anne, you look lovely.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> Look, sir, you may not care about your approval numbers, but you need people's confidence to be effective.
When's the last time you heard from the mystery caller that told you about room 105?<eos> Not since that night.<eos> I'll work on stalling the vetting, but in the meantime, we still have Nassar to deal with.<eos> Military Intelligence gave it a shot.<eos> They got nothing.<eos> That's because Nassar didn't... He didn't blow up the Capitol.<eos> That's exactly why we need you to get him to admit that as soon as possible.<eos> Governor, thank you for taking the time.<eos> I asked my wife to join us because of her immigration-law expertise.<eos> Ah, yes, I saw Sunday's "20/20" piece on you.
But there are 300 Syrian refugees being denied basic human rights in our country.<eos> This isn't a political issue.<eos> It's more of a humanitarian one.<eos> All due respect, ma'am, but everything is political.<eos> So what do you want me to do?<eos> Sit down and shut up?<eos> Is that it? No, I-I didn't say that.<eos> Yes, you did, and that's okay 'cause that's your job, but here is mine.<eos> As a wife of 17 years and an immigration attorney of 22, I am gonna counsel my husband through this.<eos> And if there is a political fallout, then I trust that you can handle it.
Was he just a "civil servant" to you?<eos> The general was insubordinate.<eos> He advanced a military operation without my authorization.<eos> And Governor Royce?<eos> I know him, sir.<eos> He is a good man.<eos> He may be, but what the governor did was tantamount to sedition.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President.<eos> To be clear, the staffers at HUD were complacent, Cochrane was insubordinate, and Royce seditious.<eos> Perhaps, sir, you're just threatened by people who disagree with you.
Sir, you need to get in there and fight back.<eos> Fight back how, Aaron?<eos> You can start by reminding them that you're the President of the United States.<eos> Governor Nichols is right.<eos> I wasn't Richmond's choice for president. I wasn't anyone's choice.<eos> Richmond didn't want me in his cabinet. He didn't want me at the State of the Union.<eos> That's why I was named Designated Survivor.<eos> Tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Look, six weeks ago, I barely remembered your name.<eos> I didn't know much about you, and, frankly, what I did know didn't impress me.

- What is his name? ! - He didn't say.<eos> You're telling me you signed on to this, and you don't know the person who set you up?<eos> You're gonna lose this family.<eos> You're gonna lose your mom.<eos> All for someone who's playing you like a damn fool!<eos> Catalan!<eos> He said his name was Catalan.<eos> Catalan.<eos> Guard.<eos> If you tell anyone... he'll kill you, too.
Oh, here's something. There is a school counselor there named Eric Bakken.<eos> Not only is he the school administrator who's in charge of handling bullying complaints from the students, but when he was 15, he was charged with assault.<eos> He was arrested. He claimed he was provoked by a long-time bully, but the charges were dropped.<eos> Let's get him in here.<eos> In theory, our community has a zero tolerance policy on bullying.<eos> But not in practice. In practice, most of the bullying that goes on at Pillsbury High never makes it to my door.<eos> Why not?<eos> Coming forward requires courage and a willingness to claim the pain.<eos> That's hard. And sometimes, I'm sorry to say, can make things worse for the victim.<eos> It must be hard for you to see kids being bullied, knowing you can't do anything to stop it.
You think I like helping these bastards?<eos> You think I sleep at night?<eos> One day, you'll understand.<eos> - I'm a patriot. - You keep telling yourself that.<eos> And, by the way, you're not getting Von Braun.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> Well, for one, the man behind your back.<eos> You found your way to the British spy.<eos> - Love your movies.<eos> - Movies? You didn't think everywhere you went we wouldn't come after you?
I can't believe we pulled this off.<eos> Thanks for getting me over the hump.<eos> Yeah, well, don't get all soft on me.<eos> Flynn's still got a nuke.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> I hope you're right about this.<eos> We are.<eos> Well, I guess this is good-bye.<eos> But maybe not for you.
How did you know?<eos> Because rebels have friends always rushing to the rescue.<eos> An unexpected pleasure to meet you,<eos> Captain Hera Syndulla.<eos> (SIGHS) Wish I could say the same, Admiral.<eos> It is a pity our first encounter might well be our last.<eos> I will keep your Kalikori in a place of honor.<eos> If I knew you'd take it, I would've smashed it when I had the chance.<eos> You surprise me.<eos> Is your history worth so little to you?
Uh, who had 11?<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> There she is.<eos> Uh, excuse me? How you doin', girl?<eos> You haven't changed a bit.<eos> Now, how does that work?<eos> Do you get younger every time you add more initials to the Lewis family name?<eos> You've got PhD, FBI, BAU.<eos> This is, uh, this is embarrassing.<eos> I... you obviously know me, but I don't remember you.
What about Gabriel?<eos> Did you see Gabriel?<eos> Yeah, I saw him.<eos> He... Is... is he alive?<eos> I saw him.<eos> We were all in a warehouse.<eos> Um, the address is 22... 23 Seventh street.<eos> He made me memorize it so I could drive back, 'cause he needed me to get something for him.<eos> It was important and he needed it.<eos> Ok, Desmond, listen, I have to go, but there are people here who will take care of you.
I'm calling and finding out.<eos> Good.<eos> Call him.<eos> Wait, I'm not sure I want to know.<eos> But you just said you wanted to know.<eos> Well, now I don't know if I want to know!<eos> Hello?<eos> Call you back.<eos> No, Dr. Feynman.<eos> If I solve it for you, you'll never learn.
- Susan?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> She's been hounding me all day, but I thought you'd rather like the chance to personally explain how you abused your power at the department of child...<eos> Ms. Martin, I'm on duty.<eos> Call Susan.<eos> My man.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Helping you pack.<eos> One for you, one for your pal Brenner.
I need you to find the time to do it before you leave this house tonight... or I will.<eos> There she is.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hey.<eos> Happy Thanksgiving.<eos> Happy Thanksgiving, my love.<eos> Wel... good to see you.<eos> I'm sorry, I've been cooking.<eos> No.<eos> Don't want to get anything on you.
Yes, baby, because it's a Thanksgiving miracle!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yay!<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't get you a tow truck tonight.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because it's Thanksgiving.<eos> Everything's closed.<eos> If I were you, I'd just call someone to pick you up and deal with the car in the morning.
"I'm sorry I had to leave in such a hurry.<eos> "But it was wonderful to see you looking so well after all these years."<eos> After all these years.<eos> Randall, you have to understand...<eos> Understand what?<eos> That you knew my father?<eos> That you kept him from me my entire life?<eos> Just stop-- just stop!<eos> Please, stop.<eos> I can't-- I can't even look at you.
I have, um...<eos> I have this.<eos> This necklace, this is his and, um, it's the only thing i have left of him.<eos> And at first, you know, i didn't want to wear it, I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't even look at it, but now it's...<eos> It's all I have and i-i can't take it off now, so...<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oh, my God, this is so dumb.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> I'm...<eos> Supposed to be comforting you, not snotting all over you.
Talk to those yoga ladies?<eos> See if they saw anything?<eos> Cool. No, no, no.<eos> Actually, Metro PD talked to them already.<eos> They didn't see anything.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Still adjusting?<eos> Wear it when Gibbs is around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - After you, ma'am.
Look at us now.<eos> Sure making the most of our degrees, huh?<eos> So... how long have you been here?<eos> A couple days.<eos> Was staying at The Watergate, but had to split.<eos> Some guys broke in there looking for me.<eos> Rittenhouse, you mean?<eos> What do you know about them? Not much.<eos> I'm trying to get more info.<eos> Why are they after you?
The Doc is a woman.<eos> Destroy the doc.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I said the doc is a person.<eos> The doc needs to be destroyed.<eos> You want me to kill someone?<eos> I can't do that.<eos> No way.<eos> Give me the address.<eos> We'll do it for you.
Hey!<eos> You have an hour left.<eos> Report. Yeah.<eos> I have the Doc.<eos> Come pick her up.<eos> And that's all the time we have.<eos> Lucy called the payphone.<eos> What did she say?<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> Okay, there is this scary guy, Garcia Flynn, - and he is after you.
Ron Janeway, we have a warrant for your arrest!<eos> Clear!<eos> Where the hell is he?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Suspect hiding in his bedroom.<eos> We got him.<eos> Is that him?<eos> That's him.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you
No, they already caught him.<eos> Well, that must be a great weight off.<eos> What happened? Started out by hacking into our son's computer.<eos> That was part of a sweeping campaign to spy on a number of political targets, just in case they weren't in line with his agenda.<eos> He turned up the heat when he thought that I was influencing the president, specifically getting him to adopt foreign policy positions that ran counter to his business interests on climate change and rising sea levels, building bases overseas, which, in turn, would threaten<eos> - his no-bid contracts with the Defense Department.<eos> - Madam Secretary, this is all sounding a bit delusional<eos> - and paranoid.<eos> - Why, Julius?<eos> 'Cause it sounds like I'm talking about you?

(BEEPING) Can you find them?<eos> They could be anywhere in time, and scanning across time takes time.<eos> Let's hope Widow, Falcon and Hawkeye are doing what they can from their side.<eos> Father, we must retreat!<eos> You are the one who fought these Avengers before.<eos> Have you no plan for fighting an Asgardian?<eos> A monster?<eos> Fortunately, I have prepared quickly.<eos> (BEEPING) Thank you, Herr Stark.<eos> Unlike you, I've located the time coordinates of my target, the year 2099!
I do understand the perception, you know.<eos> These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?<eos> They do their little quick stint in theater just to feel better about themselves.<eos> That's not why I'm here, okay?<eos> I'm here for the right reasons.<eos> Let's get this over with, shall we?<eos> Did you want me to start?<eos> Yes, I thought it would be good, if, uh...<eos> You speak, then I speak, then you speak, and we all go home.<eos> Does that work for you?
It's called a pause.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It doesn't say pause on my script...<eos> Well, it doesn't say suck, either, yet here we are.<eos> You know your size?<eos> Always tended toward the slim.<eos> I don't see that changing much at this point.<eos> Try these.<eos> Afterwards, we'll swing by the pharmacy, get those medications that the doctor wrote for you.
It's what they cost.<eos> I'm paying, just take the pants.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it or not?<eos> Talk about what?<eos> Ha.<eos> About what.<eos> Uh, this morning.<eos> Or are you content to stand in silent judgment with that face?<eos> It's just my face.<eos> No, you didn't like me apologizing for you.
Or are you content to stand in silent judgment with that face?<eos> It's just my face.<eos> No, you didn't like me apologizing for you.<eos> I get it.<eos> Would you have been happier if I made a big scene?<eos> You know, got up in Tony's face, had the cops roll up and turn the hoses on us?<eos> It's the cosgroves.<eos> He runs an insurance agency, she collects owls.<eos> History would not have memorialized our stand.<eos> You ever had a hose turned on you?
And probably blisters on your feet from marching for freedom, but me, because I grew up in a white house, you think I don't live in a black man's world.<eos> Oh, you know the one.<eos> The one where that salesman there has been eyeballing us ever since we came in here.<eos> Or where that security guard has moved just a little off his mark so he can keep us in his sight.<eos> And where they'll definitely ask for an ID with my credit card when I go to pay, even though they haven't asked for anybody else's.<eos> Plus a million things every day that I have to choose to let go, just so I'm not pissed off all the time.<eos> Like I did on the street this morning.<eos> Like I have done every day of my life.<eos> Now try on the damn slim cut flat front chinos.<eos> I think they'll look nice on you.
I don't.<eos> But I wouldn't change a thing about my parents, or the way that I parent, and I will not apologize for any of it.<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> Because I don't.<eos> I should.<eos> Three weeks I've known you, and I still haven't said the words.<eos> You don't have to say any...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am so deeply sorry.<eos> I did everything wrong by you.
And welcome.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> So, um, electronics, all electronics.<eos> Phones.<eos> This is like airport security.<eos> One at a time, put your arms up for me.<eos> Okay, next.<eos> You're good, miss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just close the door behind you, sir.
We're fine.<eos> No, Lily, I'm not taking your seat.<eos> Well, then, we're not listening.<eos> Oh, come on, rest your doggies.<eos> Get over here.<eos> All right.<eos> I knew you wouldn't want to take that off.<eos> - Did I tell you?<eos> - You were right.<eos> I'm gonna have something for you, too, but today, my hand's just a little bit shaky.
- Here you go.<eos> All right.<eos> Contact dermatitis, bed 4.<eos> Hey, look who showed up.<eos> Well, I can't be the pregnant lady who ignores unsolicited medical advice.<eos> That lady's a jerk.<eos> Let's see this rash.<eos> That's all it was, right?<eos> Medical advice?<eos> Because if you got me all worried just to get a date or get in some pregnant lady's pants, that would make you the jerk.
That's your tendency.<eos> That's my tenden...<eos> What's my tendency?<eos> Leniency.<eos> You have a tendency towards leniency.<eos> - Are you joking? - Mnhmnh.<eos> You know what my nickname used to be?<eos> They called me the Na...<eos> Benjamin Warren.<eos> Dr. Bailey, I believe in you.
"That's why they call them the tough calls"?<eos> That's all you got?<eos> I just called you wise.<eos> Heads up.<eos> Look, the clinic is a joke, I know, and nobody wants to go over there.<eos> But it's not a joke when a pregnant lady has to wait over an hour for someone to come over and confirm that she has cancer.<eos> I've paged you multiple times.<eos> I'm the Chief of Surgery.<eos> Why aren't you paging a resident?<eos> I want you, the surgeon with the most expertise to give this patient the best chance.
People hated me so much, I got punched in the face.<eos> Had exactly one friend.<eos> Kepner.<eos> She likes everybody.<eos> Um, should we wait for Jeremy to get back?<eos> Uh, no, his stomach goes bonkers when he's stressed out, so he might be a while.<eos> Uh, I wanted to talk to you about scheduling the DE.<eos> Dr. Karev said there was a surgery.<eos> Why aren't we doing that surgery?<eos> Because it's very risky to you, to the baby.
Everything we've taught you thus far has been about your survival.<eos> While protecting your own life is paramount, as an operative in the field, you might one day have to end someone else's.<eos> This is the MQ-9A Reaper drone, and it is the deadliest weapon in our unmanned aerial weapons arsenal.<eos> Deadly force requires deliberation.<eos> Sometimes you make the right decision.<eos> Other times, you don't.<eos> Either way, you have to live with it and its consequences.<eos> The question is, can you?<eos> It's not always our actions, but their aftermath that haunt us.<eos> So today we're gonna find out who among you is strong enough to face themselves.
Just Mr. Burke.<eos> Would you follow me?<eos> I should be in there.<eos> Miranda, I think Alex might be inside the crisis zone.<eos> At least she was an hour ago.<eos> I've been trying to contact her, and her phone is going straight to voice-mail.<eos> The terrorists have blocked off eight city blocks, jammed phones, radios.<eos> I know, but I am pretty sure she was inside that perimeter when the attack happened.<eos> Who have you told?<eos> Just you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I never should have left that show.<eos> I've...<eos> I never should have come here, that's for sure.<eos> Being an Uncle, right, doing theater...<eos> I... I...<eos> I'm not cut out for theater.<eos> And there you go again.<eos> Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?
I already told you, I killed her.<eos> I did it alone.<eos> The evidence tells us you had an accomplice.<eos> You can't prove it was Sean.<eos> I can prove you're making a big mistake trying to protect your boyfriend.<eos> You fell hard for Sean, didn't you?<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> He's handsome, charming, wealthy.<eos> He was your ticket into a world you didn't even know existed.<eos> Too bad he didn't feel the same about you.
You fell hard for Sean, didn't you?<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> He's handsome, charming, wealthy.<eos> He was your ticket into a world you didn't even know existed.<eos> Too bad he didn't feel the same about you.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I think I do.<eos> I grew up just like Sean.<eos> I learned how to use my privilege to get what I wanted.<eos> Just like Sean was using you.
- He knew you had a terrible childhood, so he used his wealth to make you feel special, and then he manipulated you...<eos> which is all you really were, anyway.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> No?<eos> What was it like?<eos> We...<eos> We... were... in love.<eos> You were in love.<eos> Sean didn't care about you.
It wasn't like that.<eos> No?<eos> What was it like?<eos> We...<eos> We... were... in love.<eos> You were in love.<eos> Sean didn't care about you.<eos> - You were his patsy.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> He let you rot in prison because he never really cared about you.
Is that why Debra sent him to boarding school... to break up their relationship?<eos> Debra just wanted what was best for Sean.<eos> As long as he wasn't in love with a man?<eos> No.<eos> Neither of us had a problem with Sean being gay.<eos> So what was the issue?<eos> Debra didn't approve of Will.<eos> She felt that he wasn't...<eos> Because he was poor?<eos> Was that a deal-breaker for you, too?
Blake, are you ready to get your copy of Ocean's Eleven signed?<eos> Montreal's back on?<eos> The Saudis were very grateful to be put back on your schedule.<eos> Yeah, thanks, in no small part, to the extra media attention it gets them.<eos> Ma'am, are you sure this is a good idea?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Minister Hajar.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> I am glad you changed your mind.<eos> The summit wouldn't have been the same without you.
Maybe forgiveness.<eos> If it's not me, it'll be someone else.<eos> Carl Brown's not gonna see next week.<eos> Remember... distract them.<eos> Don't shoot them. Here we go.<eos> I don't always shoot people.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can anyone help me?<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm Ricky. What can I do for you?
Whoa, whoa.<eos> Bit generous calling yourself an agent.<eos> You haven't even started yet... but you got the secret part right.<eos> You mention anything about the Phoenix, Thorton'll make you disappear.<eos> Mac! Hey!<eos> You know, these teachers here, they had a running bet.<eos> Will Angus MacGyver ever come back?<eos> Only took me five years to win.<eos> It's great to see you, Mac.<eos> You too, Mr. Ericson.
If I get arrested, then Valerie's gonna be left with no one.<eos> I'm guessing they wouldn't take no for an answer.<eos> So they took Valerie instead, right?<eos> An hour ago, they texted me and they said if I make one more run for them that they would meet me at the end with Val.<eos> Exchange her for the money.<eos> Now that my car's ruined, I... I can't make the run.<eos> If I don't make the run, then my daughter's as good as dead.<eos> They're-they're gonna kill my little girl.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We're gonna drive for you.
Dr. Shaw!<eos> Or should I call you, Dr. Bloom?<eos> Either way, I'll skip the pleasantries.<eos> - We haven't much time.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> I'm here with your colleague, Dr. Rayburn, who can confirm we have a situation.<eos> As we speak, the FBI is raiding his medical clinic.<eos> Sonia, he knows everything about the research, The Coroner.<eos> I'm like the Ghost of Christmas Past... and Future, which is how I know the FBI will board your ship the moment it docks.<eos> Whoever you are, why should I believe you?
Nice.<eos> Hey, yeah, Toby, do you mind if we take a victory pic?<eos> Oh, no, no, that's not necessary.<eos> No, of course it is.<eos> No, it's no biggie.<eos> You hit your goal.<eos> It's no biggie. No.<eos> You are no biggie... anymore.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm proud of you, Toby.
The chief must be coming.<eos> The chief is a woman.<eos> Don't look so surprised.<eos> - You speak English.<eos> - Missionaries.<eos> The language stayed.<eos> Their faith did not.<eos> My name is Nonhelema.<eos> You're Nonhelema?<eos> I've heard of you before, because you are a great chieftess. And very beautiful and super intimidating.
How I envy you, Tomas.<eos> You've got a family, a parish, a woman that you love.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> A good priest.<eos> But you've got too much to lose.<eos> You can never be an exorcist.<eos> Well, I'm gonna hunt, too.<eos> Only I'll have a hundred volunteers and half the Chicago police.<eos> Bully for you.
I think so.<eos> Thanks for the billable hours, by the way.<eos> I'll be down in the small conference room.<eos> Your assistant set me up there.<eos> Stay.<eos> Hayes was just leaving.<eos> We should get a drink while you're in town, Naomi.<eos> Catch up.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> I know this is difficult for you.
- I wasn't sure.<eos> - With a black son.<eos> You know he has a target on his back.<eos> - You leave him out of this.<eos> - And you know they won't.<eos> No matter how much of a "House Negro" you raise him to be.<eos> Maxine!<eos> You done with me, too?<eos> You think I killed that cop?<eos> The evidence is stacked against you.
They hung up on you?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Their business is money laundering.<eos> They hire Ivy League attorneys to hide money for superrich corporate titans.<eos> They recruited heavily from my law school.<eos> Vince was definitely not super-rich.<eos> I'll take care of Powell.<eos> You keep digging on Vince.<eos> Getting right back on your horse.<eos> Good for you!
No.<eos> Great?<eos> Yes.<eos> She's a wild card, a force of nature... exactly what the CIU needs.<eos> This unit is devoted to making sure there really is justice for all.<eos> And that includes people with diminished capacity, like Leo?<eos> For everyone. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.<eos> Sounds like the sound bite of a man running for office in the near future.<eos> No comment.<eos> Any chance the U.S. Attorney's ongoing investigation of you might derail those plans?
- Never better. For what it's worth, thank you.<eos> You did everything humanly possible for Leo.<eos> Except get him out of prison.<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> Who cares whose fault it is?<eos> Doesn't make it suck any less.<eos> You really care about Leo, don't you?<eos> He doesn't belong in prison.<eos> Well, he won't budge off what he thinks is right.<eos> Almost reminds me of you.
NYPD is downstairs to take you in.<eos> Do whatever you want.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Leo.<eos> I am so sorry for... for everything.<eos> It's okay, Vince. You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Things got a little heated between you and Hayes earlier?
I would be honored.<eos> MacLeish? For VP?<eos> They want to start the vetting.<eos> I have a source claiming that Leo Kirkman is not the president's son.<eos> We have Majid Nassar.<eos> Effective interrogation takes time.<eos> You've got 24 hours.<eos> You signed on to this, and you don't know the person who set you up?<eos> He said his name was Catalan.<eos> If you tell anyone, he'll kill you, too.
Coach Weston, show them what we've got.<eos> You must get this all the time, but back in '92, when you broke the world record for the 400 meters, that was one of the most incredible things I'd ever seen.<eos> I appreciate that, Mr. President.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. President.<eos> Congressman MacLeish and his wife have arrived.<eos> Thank you, Wyatt.<eos> I'm sorry. I have to step away.<eos> It was a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Remember, Mr. President... Leaders are made, not born.<eos> - We're rooting for you, sir.
Have you seen him?<eos> I can assure you, Luke is fine.<eos> In fact, he's the only kid I know who likes coffee ice cream.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> Where is my son?<eos> Deep breath, Jason.<eos> Think it through.<eos> Anything happens to me, and the next photo you'll see is Luke with a bullet in his brain.<eos> I know you love your family, and it would be a tragedy if something happened to Luke... or to Yvette... sometime after you buried your son.<eos> You hurt my family, I promise you... I will kill you and whoever the hell you're working with.
It's pretty cool, isn't it?<eos> I've dreamed of this place.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm glad you like it, because if you ever sandbag the president's teenage son again, consider yourself banned for life.<eos> Whoa! Easy!<eos> I was just doing my job.<eos> But if you want the story gone, it's gone.<eos> -It wasn't even mine to begin with.<eos> -I know.<eos> Lisa Jordan killed the story, and then your editor slipped it onto you.
Kimble, thank you.<eos> Seth?<eos> Great speech by the president.<eos> You did a final polish, right?<eos> You know, we had a deal, and you broke it.<eos> Next time you try to be a Woodward, pick a better Bernstein than Jared Abbott.<eos> Look, to be fair, all I said was that I wouldn't run with the story, and I didn't.<eos> No, you just gave it to somebody else.<eos> Seth, come on. Like it or not, it is news.<eos> Maybe not to you, but to millions of Americans about to cast their votes tomorrow, the president's relationship with the truth means something.

Seth, I really do.<eos> Okay?<eos> But asking me to choose between you and the truth will produce an outcome that won't make either of us happy.
I assume I should hand these back to my editor.<eos> Not on my account.<eos> I believe our country is only as strong as our journalists.<eos> I expect you to keep us honest.<eos> Ms. Jordan.<eos> Thank you, Seth.<eos> Good night, sir.<eos> So I guess we'll still be working together.<eos> Yes, but only working.<eos> I trusted you.
Right. I looked everywhere.<eos> I've got nothing.<eos> Right, which is why you need to re-examine MacLeish's files and see if there's a connection.<eos> Chuck, I know you're taking a risk by being here, so if you needed to leave, I'd understand.<eos> Hannah, when you come asking for help, it's never easy, and sometimes not even legal.<eos> But you're smart and dedicated and usually right, so tell me what I need to do.<eos> To be honest, I'm not comfortable going after the "Miracle on the Potomac" just because you've got a bone to pick with the president.<eos> Congressman, you're new here. So let me give you a little bit of free advice.<eos> D.C. is all about relationships.<eos> And this relationship, yours and mine, is not one you want to sour.
And just named the new chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.<eos> The senator has tremendous power.<eos> His committee can lock down any debt, tax, spending bill we suggest.<eos> And what about the memo was so offensive?<eos> "Senator Hazelton is a lecherous old man" more accustomed to groping female staff "than promoting them."<eos> Again, why is this my problem?<eos> Because he wants you to fire the author immediately.<eos> Okay, who's the author?<eos> I am, sir.<eos> Senator, please understand that my words are in no way a reflection of how the president feels about you.
How much time?<eos> As much as you can give me.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Thank you for taking the time.<eos> I thought I made myself clear.<eos> Why is she still working here?<eos> Because, Senator, I'm the one who chooses which of my staffers I let go.<eos> And I try to make a point by not starting out with my best one.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Everything Ms. Rhodes said about you is true, and I have the proof to back it up.

Careful who you show file 12-80C to, sir.<eos> Mike, that man gave up his career and his freedom for what's on this hard drive.<eos> I want to know why.<eos> This laptop's air-gapped.<eos> So if there's malware on this drive, it'll only affect this computer.<eos> De-encryption software's already running. How do you know all this?<eos> Before I was assigned to your protective detail,<eos> I rotated through investigations, threat assessment, and our technical department.<eos> 2 1/2 years staring at computer code.<eos> Let's just say I like working for you more. Good.
I'm not having second thoughts on Rangell.<eos> What would make you think that?<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I-I must have been, um... I must have been thinking about something else.<eos> The motorcade leaves for the Capitol in 30 minutes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Ritter.<eos> Agent Ritter, it's John Foerstel.<eos> What can I do for you?
Now is there any... anything else that you can remember, Mary?<eos> It doesn't matter how small it is.<eos> I think he might live on our estate.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> I think I've seen him before.<eos> I think him and his dad take the same bus as me to work.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Mr Manuel?<eos> What the bloody hell do you want?<eos> As if it's not enough. For you to deprive our Peter of his liberty for nine years for crimes he dinnae do, nine years!
What's he talking about?<eos> This guy shows up every year on the day that Reed girl disappeared.<eos> Wants me to confess to something I had nothing to do with.<eos> Who are you guys?<eos> Five-O.<eos> You recognize this?<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> We, um... we found it with Maggie Reed's remains.<eos> Never thought we'd find her, did you?<eos> Travis, clearly... Maggie meant something to you.
Only took about a decade.<eos> You've been lying to me for years.<eos> I lied to you because I knew you'd never believe me.<eos> Come on. I know how this goes.<eos> Guy like me's never gonna get a fair shake from the cops.<eos> You lied because you killed her.<eos> I loved her!<eos> I had nothing do with this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey. If you had nothing to do with this, why don't you tell me how things happened with you and Maggie.
Geez, what they been giving you?<eos> Looks like you could use a nap.<eos> $4 million price on my head.<eos> I guess I should be flattered.<eos> Money well spent, Mr. MacGyver.<eos> Unfortunately, over the last 48 hours, the DEA and Federales shut down your entire operation, so, everything you have is gone.<eos> You may have my money, but you haven't taken my friends.<eos> And there's still plenty of those that owe me favors.<eos> I look forward to meeting those friends.<eos> Grandpa... this came for you.
Just relax.<eos> Everything's cool, okay?<eos> Turn off the jammer.<eos> This might be them.<eos> Jeremy's father's here.<eos> Excellent.<eos> This is Commander McGarrett.<eos> Who am I speaking to, please?<eos> My name is not important.<eos> The only thing that matters is what I need from you.
Yeah, no, you're not.<eos> You've been there once.<eos> Now you know better.<eos> How's the kid?<eos> The hyperventilating kid.<eos> Fine.<eos> I like girls.<eos> What?<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> I mean, I feel like you can't tell or something, that I like women, that I'm flirting with you. You're not getting it, and I'm really good at this. I have game, which means either you're not into women and the world is upside-down bonkers, because I know, or you're not into me and I'm totally deluding myself.

Don't you know that?<eos> This is about you.<eos> You will be destroyed.<eos> Your life, your career, everything... will be finished.<eos> Who you are will be gone.<eos> I'd hug you goodbye, but I'm not scrubbed.<eos> Well, because this isn't goodbye, Alex.<eos> You don't walk in here when I'm in the middle of a surgery.<eos> Dr. Grey?<eos> We're ready for you in the...
You got rid of the shoes he was wearing.<eos> Got rid of the ammo he used.<eos> That's a great story.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Name Carl Dixon ring a bell?<eos> No?<eos> 'Cause he's the hit man you hired to take out the only witness to the murder.<eos> Carol Dixon's dead.<eos> We're tracking a payment deposited into his account.<eos> And we're pretty sure it's gonna lead right back to you.
My mom, she told me to never take this country for granted.<eos> She said it all the time.<eos> She said,<eos> "Home is a privilege."<eos> That's how I always saw it.<eos> That's how I still see it.<eos> Victor.<eos> I got a lawyer friend.<eos> I don't know if keeping you home is a battle we can win, but I'd like to help you fight it.<eos> These guys told me a lot about you on the trip here, sir.
Guess who it was traced back to?<eos> - Hayes...<eos> - Chuck Sawyer.<eos> He was a paralegal at the Chicago D.A.'s office.<eos> Turns out he hated you.<eos> Guess Chuck wanted to get even by sinking your big break with the feds.<eos> Well, let's hope Mr. Sawyer corroborates your story when I subpoena him.<eos> I'm sure he'd be happy to, except he's dead.<eos> Passed away in February.<eos> Then I'll need to hear it from you, assuming you're willing to take the stand officially.
Just trying to be helpful.<eos> Maybe I like the mess.<eos> I wasn't born into this either.<eos> I had to find my way. Letting some charlatan dunk you in the river, that's easy.<eos> Commitment is hard.<eos> I don't wanna lie to her.<eos> So, tell her as much of the truth as you can.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> I can let you off the hook.<eos> Does she still trust you?
Fell off a roof.<eos> I think... we were very close to finding your son.<eos> I think if we can find each other again, I can get us to that courtyard.<eos> What do we tell my sister?<eos> The truth.<eos> Sabine.<eos> Your boyfriend and I need to sleep together.<eos> I can't believe you let that succubus twist you around.<eos> You know if you're not careful, you lose your soul to people like her.<eos> As opposed to you, who has nothing but kindness in his heart? So I like to have a good time.
He can bring me back.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - The key to everything.<eos> The one that's gonna teach us. We're all dreaming the same dream.<eos> How'd you build this?<eos> Your mother built it for us.<eos> The room is designed to see into Tess's dreams.<eos> When you find the boy, push the button. - There's a woman.<eos> She was taken.<eos> - The people holding her, they want to unleash. The same kind of anarchy on humanity. That your dreams have unleashed on you.
At one time, Frank was a good cop, but... he forgot who he was.<eos> Lost his way.<eos> Let me tell you what a good cop is.<eos> She's feared.<eos> She's respected.<eos> She knows when to keep her eyes open and her mouth shut.<eos> And no matter what, she doesn't turn on her people.<eos> You understand what I'm saying to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I see those qualities in you one day in.
- On what grounds?<eos> They say with all the current instability, we need presidential certainty.<eos> Not a bad point.<eos> I recommend that we immediately file a lawsuit to challenge the rule.<eos> White House Counsel thinks we have a decent chance of winning.<eos> Otherwise, Evans will win the election next week.<eos> Bess?<eos> Well, they're taking the election away from the new Congress.<eos> We have a legitimate fight.<eos> I have President Shiraz for you, sir.
Okay.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Is it about Russell?<eos> No.<eos> Iran.<eos> They just kidnapped Israel's defense minister.<eos> President Shiraz, are you out of your mind?<eos> Have you seen the destruction at Ebrahim?<eos> Kidnapping, an-an Israeli minister, it's, it's unprecedented.<eos> We know the Hezbollah faction that took Minister Weissberg was working for you.
"in sneaking up the coast<eos> "totally unexpected and unobserved.<eos> "But, as Morrison put it, 'By a curious paradox,<eos> "'the efforts of the Allied armed forces to maintain secrecy<eos> "'probably lost whatever chance there was of an unopposed landing in Morocco.'"<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Hey there.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Carol... she... she went to get coffee, and also, to call your son again.<eos> She was reading this... to you.
Three to seven men, sir.<eos> Odds of taking the hostage alive?<eos> 50 percent.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> President Shiraz.<eos> You're probably wondering why your Parsa nuclear facility isn't a smoldering ember right now.<eos> It's because the United States, at great risk, took offensive measures against Israel.<eos> Now I need something from you in return.<eos> U.S. military personnel are outside the compound in Deir El Ahmar, where your soldiers are holding. Minister Weissberg.<eos> We can go in and kill your men, and risk the life of the hostage, which would be very bad for you.
I'm surprised to see you got back so fast.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Nice to see you, Governor Evans.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> It's a family tradition, so I hightailed it back from Geneva.<eos> I'd be lying if I said I didn't shed a tear at that tableau of Dalton with Aaronson and Shiraz.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, we'll see what happens.<eos> And congratulations to you on a hard-fought race.
Not doing so well staying on message now, is he?<eos> Yeah, it's a little harder when the message is,<eos> "Turns out my message is total BS."<eos> Ma'am, the press is still asking for an official statement.<eos> "I'm shocked that a cable news show would run with a giant story that fell in its lap, just as I planned it."<eos> I'll say you're dismayed that a private conversation was overheard and taken out of context.<eos> Or that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's good the American people now know that his promises were built on quicksand.<eos> Ma'am, the foreign minister of Iran is on the line for you.
I thought that, too.<eos> But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.<eos> You know, I do have some time off this Sunday - if you'd like to...<eos> - Hey! I saw your car... Oh, sorry.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> Uh... It's okay. Uh, I should get back to work.<eos> Hi.<eos> Howard Wolowitz. Oh. Issabella Concepcion.<eos> Oh, yeah, the astronomer.<eos> Raj told us about you.
Apparently, I'm indispensable.<eos> Okay, when you gonna be back?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, I don't think you know this, but... everything started here.<eos> You gave me a message.<eos> You told me where to find Father Marcus.<eos> - I did what, now?<eos> - You told me how to get to a place called...<eos> St. Aquinas.<eos> God... spoke through you, Henry.

- I'm just doing my job. - Not a problem.<eos> So how long should it take to download?<eos> Around ten minutes.<eos> - Ten minutes? - I know.<eos> Fast?<eos> You better be right about all this.<eos> Those guys will be back any minute.<eos> I can get into a world of trouble. I am.<eos> Just trust me.<eos> Trust you?
Get off of him!<eos> Hey. Flynn!<eos> Get back now!<eos> It's medicine.<eos> It was a bee sting.<eos> Gabriel was in anaphylactic shock.<eos> It was a shot of epinephrine.<eos> He just saved your son's life.<eos> Stand back!<eos> Every memory I have of you, you were always sad.
He goes, "It doesn't sound funny to me."<eos> I would use it in real life.<eos> The IRS tries to audit you, "Bunch of fucking bullshit."<eos> Are those millennials arriving? Anyone? Millennials?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Under 35?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Look at you.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Sounded just like you.<eos> You would have liked him.<eos> - This man he's meeting with...<eos> If there is anyone in this world that you love, you will stop looking into this right now.<eos> - Are you threatening me?<eos> - I am the last person to threaten you.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to see you or anyone you love get hurt.
If there is anyone in this world that you love, you will stop looking into this right now.<eos> - Are you threatening me?<eos> - I am the last person to threaten you.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to see you or anyone you love get hurt.<eos> I didn't take this job because I'm afraid, Rufus.<eos> You let me worry about the people I love.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm trusting you.
But your wife does have a point.<eos> Why did you invite me over?<eos> I've been up most nights lately worrying.<eos> I know that Rufus talked to you about...<eos> Rittenhouse?<eos> Yeah, that's part of it.<eos> And I'm looking into it, believe me.<eos> But what's really been keeping me awake is your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> As hard as it must be for you to remember your sister, what's worse for me... is that your mother doesn't.
Beat me to death, have Washington hang me.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I understand, understand why you would betray Washington, why you would go to Rittenhouse. You must know me well. Well, I...<eos> I know you sank your entire fortune into the Patriot cause.<eos> I know that you were one of Washington's best and brightest.<eos> At Saratoga, when they shot your horse dead right from underneath you, you kept fighting.<eos> And when a musket ball shattered your leg, what did you do? You kept fighting.<eos> What of it?<eos> But when it came time... for your promotion to Major General, the promotion that you earned,<eos> And what did Washington do for you?
What you're describing sounds like tyranny disguised as democracy.<eos> Father believes there's no other choice.<eos> What do you believe, John?<eos> No one's ever asked me that before.<eos> Benedict Arnold.<eos> You honor us with your presence.<eos> Father.<eos> That's him.<eos> David, you look well.<eos> John was just telling my friends about you.
David, what is this?<eos> These men are here to kill me.<eos> - You got this all wrong.<eos> - Really?<eos> The sweat on her brow.<eos> The hand near your pocket, where I assume you have a pistol.<eos> This isn't the first time I've seen that look on a man's face, believe me.<eos> You mean me harm.<eos> But don't worry, my dear.<eos> We'll still find a good use for you.
But don't worry, my dear.<eos> We'll still find a good use for you.<eos> Get up.<eos> Boy, get up.<eos> I said get up.<eos> What an ingenious pistol.<eos> I've never seen its equal.<eos> You have to believe me, David.<eos> How could I have known they were lying to me?<eos> You know all I ever want is to be of service to you, to serve the cause.
I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Did he tell you how I admire his military genius?<eos> How when the war is over, I will give him a place near me at the table of elders?<eos> I'm honored, sir.<eos> But did he also tell you about his alcoholic father?<eos> His poor education?<eos> His vanity?<eos> - His bad temper? His...<eos> - David, please.<eos> After everything I've done for you?
His vanity?<eos> - His bad temper? His...<eos> - David, please.<eos> After everything I've done for you?<eos> You're an idiot, Benedict.<eos> So blinded by your wounded pride... that you brought these people into my house to kill me.<eos> It was just a mistake, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> You betrayed your best friend in the whole world, so why would I ever trust you?
Sure, I could go for some soup.<eos> We're not having soup, are we?<eos> Hey, Charlotte, you're looking good.<eos> Hey, Marjorie.<eos> This is Jill, she's helping us out today.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Did she get a nudge from the judge?<eos> Nope, just volunteering.<eos> Oh, God bless you, sweetie.<eos> No, God bless you for, you know, being homeless.
That's what we're trying to find out.<eos> Can you think of who might want to go after Commander Reza?<eos> How could I possibly know?<eos> I've had no contact with the outside world in years.<eos> Not with my family.<eos> Not with anyone.<eos> Derrick restored my faith that I might once again be a free man.<eos> He died for nothing.<eos> That is not true, Amir.<eos> He was fighting for you, and so are we.
You had us on obstruction?<eos> That's... that's funny.<eos> That's evidence in a federal investigation.<eos> You can't touch that.<eos> She died on your watch and you did nothing to stop it.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Why were you following Susie Freeling?<eos> Play this out, Commander.<eos> You've detained a federal agent without cause.<eos> In what universe does that end well for you?
They weren't even on the FBI's radar, were they?<eos> You told me yourself, she came to you, told you what they were up to.<eos> If it wasn't for her, you would never have had it.<eos> Did he tell you anything?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> Then he gave us his CEO.<eos> He said he was told that Susie was getting too close.<eos> She needed to be silenced before she could go public.<eos> Unfortunately, she trusted you instead of going public.
I want nothing more than to believe what Cleander is telling me. But he's lying.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Responsible for the Empire's grain supply,<eos> Cleander must now stand trial to determine who's to blame for the shortage.<eos> Cleander, my entire city is calling for your head.<eos> There have been oversights. -I've admitted that already.<eos> -That's not enough.<eos> I've done all I can to relieve you of the burdens of government.<eos> Perhaps I put too much on myself.<eos> But everything I've done, I've done for you.
The question is, what do we do?<eos> We go to war, expand our borders, strengthen our glory, show the people what it means to be Roman.<eos> And with victory, we'll prove the Gods are still behind us.<eos> Do I have your permission -to speak candidly?<eos> -Of course.<eos> Wars take time, money, people. All things we are dearly lacking.<eos> Well, I won't just sit here while my people riot.<eos> So tell me, Dio, what should I do?<eos> Grain? Land?<eos> Well, those things have worked for you before, but... we have never faced anything like this.
"Remember, it's chain-snatching season. So...<eos> So tuck your jewelry into your clothing and turn your rings around so the stones don't show."<eos> That's the mentality.<eos> It wasn't: "It's chain-snatching season, so if you see something, yell for a transit cop, the conductor."<eos> It's: "It's chain-snatching season.<eos> Somebody's about to get robbed.<eos> Make it not be you.<eos> Better them than you.<eos> Tuck your shit in so it's not you.<eos> It's gonna happen, but it might not happen to you if you tuck shit."
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.
We're just... running out of time.<eos> Couldn't find a way.<eos> I'll keep trying.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> I remember one night with my wife and son.<eos> We were out in a field counting shooting stars.<eos> It was quiet.<eos> Just us and the stars.<eos> They're not coming to see me die.<eos> We'll be there for you.
That's dangerous.<eos> Yeah, magic got us out of trouble today.<eos> But it's also what put us in it, too.<eos> Point taken.<eos> Jenkins!<eos> It's happening!<eos> Uh, it's crack...<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, well, Mr. Jones, I do believe it has just imprinted on you.
Increible! Muy bien, mi hijo!<eos> Muy bien.<eos> That's a beautiful kid you got there.<eos> Mr. Ramirez,<eos> I really mean no disrespect, I just want to get this little girl home to her family safely.<eos> You understand?<eos> The people who did take her are using a different playbook than mine.<eos> That makes them unpredictable and very, very dangerous.<eos> So when they call you... And they will... Keep your gun in your holster and your sheriff badge in your pocket, and do exactly what they say, to the letter.<eos> For you, it's family.
Go ahead.<eos> Get that up in here.<eos> What do you say?<eos> No.<eos> You ain't got to be all stank about it.<eos> All right. Well, I got, some other names that might help, twist your arm a little bit, all right?<eos> Turn your nose up at Mr. Franklin, you end up with Mr. Heckler and Mr. Koch.<eos> Those German guys can be pretty persuasive.<eos> In here.<eos> Okay. After you.
But only we are waiting for the decision of the Philippine government or the U.S. government.<eos> [Arlyn] The Sabaya that you saw in my interview was not the Sabaya that he introduced or he projected himself to be in earlier days.<eos> That was a different Sabaya.<eos> Because at that time, Sabaya didn't really know... who can he trust.<eos> I think he was left alone by the other ASG commanders to negotiate for Martin and Gracia.<eos> Martin, Gracia, I'll do my best to report truthfully about your condition here.<eos> - [Martin] Thank you very much.<eos> - You can be assured of that.<eos> [Martin] Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you also.
I can see how that would alienate the people who care about me the most, and I'm very sorry about that.<eos> Congratulations, Knight.<eos> You have the inner vision.<eos> The Eye of Ra is yours.<eos> Collect your prize.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> I didn't think you'd last.<eos> But you found your strength in candor, and so to you the Eye is passed.<eos> And may I introduce to you all the remaining cast?<eos> We who have pledged to guard the Eye now entrust the Eye to you.
In it resides hope eternal, but it has a secret, too.<eos> Would you like me to tell him?<eos> No, I believe I should tell him.<eos> I also think we can dispense with the rhyme and the literary theatrics.<eos> Don't you agree, Flynn?<eos> May I call you Flynn?<eos> Teddy Chislington, I presume.<eos> You're quite a Librarian, Flynn.<eos> Up there with Enoch the Elder.<eos> Well, that is very high praise, coming from you.
You're quite a Librarian, Flynn.<eos> Up there with Enoch the Elder.<eos> Well, that is very high praise, coming from you.<eos> And may I also say that you've done a masterful job keeping the Eye safe.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> To possess a weapon designed to be wielded last in the ultimate battle is an awesome sense of responsibility, to say the least.<eos> I knew even the Library was not secure enough to protect it.<eos> No, I needed to hide it where others feared to tread, design a test only a Librarian with a pure heart could pass.<eos> Why Lewis Carroll?<eos> His characters always seemed the most fun, but it's who they represent to you that's important.
How about you show me your I.D.?<eos> 'Cause all I'm seeing are some skin-tight shorts and a bicycle.<eos> For all I know, you could be on your way to a bachelorette party.<eos> I mean, you're very handsome.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Just show me your license and registration.<eos> Okay, look... it's my boyfriend's placard.<eos> I don't see a boyfriend.<eos> You do not because he is at home, confined to his wheelchair, just waiting for the one thing that helps him get through his lonely, handicapped day: beer.<eos> It's probably hard for you to imagine with your... perfectly-muscled legs.
And I'm sorry.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Yep, not my finest moment.<eos> Moments.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, people shoplift all the time, but no one's actually ever come back to apologize.<eos> That took a lot of courage.<eos> Well, yeah, it kind of did.<eos> But I'm trying to live my life more honestly, 'cause I don't want to drink again.<eos> Good for you.
Mom, Dad... - (Laughs nervously) - ...this is Rob.<eos> - Hey, Rob.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Mike.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> A watch.<eos> Yeah. (Chuckles) I'm really sorry I'm late.<eos> Oh, no, please, it's fine.<eos> It's so nice to meet you, Rob.<eos> These are for you.
So, I mean, what the hell?<eos> Inmate negotiator.<eos> Hi, this is Dave.<eos> Who's this?<eos> This is inmate negotiator.<eos> Hold on for a minute.<eos> Let me get George for you, all right?<eos> [negotiator] I wish you would, yeah.<eos> Okay, sir.<eos> What can we do for you, George?
- Kala, are you okay? - Um, fine.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> This is it!<eos> Okay.<eos> Right.<eos> Vitals.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Almost...<eos> Let me be clear, I don't trust you anymore.
Lothar, come.<eos> I have got something for you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A mechanical marvel.<eos> It's a boom stick.<eos> Odd.<eos> Take water.<eos> You might want to head home, big man.<eos> Someone has attacked one of your garrisons.<eos> It seems your king needs you, commander.
[all] Good morning, Pee-wee.<eos> Excuse me, where are we going?<eos> Oh, that's the surprise.<eos> To the wedding chapel where my daughter is getting married today.<eos> Oh, congratulations.<eos> Who's your lucky new son-in-law?<eos> Well, he's riding in the truck with me.<eos> I don't see him.<eos> It's you.<eos> - [door rattling] - [grunting] All the girls sure like you.
[chuckles] Where are we?<eos> The woods.<eos> In the mountains.<eos> I gotta be on my way.<eos> - How do you get out of here?<eos> - You don't!<eos> Not without a seasoned guide.<eos> Someone who knows these woods like the back of their weathered hand.<eos> Someone who's lived with nature since they decided to live alone, off the grid as a hermit, and leave the dog-eat-dog world of certified public accounting.<eos> Is it you you're talking about?
- Oh. You mean the garnish.<eos> - Garnish?<eos> Yes, garnish.<eos> A decoration or embellishment of a prepared food-plate or drink to augment the visual impact on the plate.<eos> Can you eat it?<eos> My garnish tastes like an orange.<eos> It is an orange.<eos> [Beverly] Yes, your meal will come with garnish.<eos> Welcome back, Pee-wee!<eos> I can't put my finger on it, but there's something different about you.
This route is longer ... But there make rail.<eos> We can do part the route to it.<eos> Good.<eos> John?<eos> John!<eos> John!<eos> Well!<eos> I will come with you Anyway.<eos> You can not keep up.<eos> Can not I keep up with Tarzan ... but I can definitely keep up with you.
But it's a very long waiting list.<eos> You start tomorrow.<eos> The bar doesn't give credit.<eos> Toilet is down the hall.<eos> Comrade Director, Raisa Demidova.<eos> I have been assigned here.<eos> Would you be so kind to show me to my classroom?<eos> Fine.<eos> Here is your classroom.<eos> If we need you for anything else, we will tell you.
Senator Castillo, Jane Bodine. - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> We read the report.<eos> It was depressing.<eos> So, what's the biopsy?<eos> Is it... Is it terminal?<eos> Well, if we thought that, we wouldn't have come all the way here, right?<eos> We think you could win this thing, Senator.<eos> What we'd like to do is start with some focus groups, get an idea of what people are thinking about you, get...
- That's excellent.<eos> - Thank you, Nell.<eos> How can a narrative fit a man?<eos> Just take it in a minute, will you?<eos> Exactly.<eos> "People forget what you say,<eos> "but they remember how you make them feel."<eos> Warren Beatty.<eos> And right now you make people feel like you're gonna shoot them.<eos> People don't like you.
We are trying to save people's lives, okay?<eos> But this is no longer an election.<eos> This is a crisis.<eos> And our brand, what we are selling,<eos> crisis.<eos> If this phone rings, do not answer.<eos> Everything changes tonight, and this is the tipping point.<eos> We have every single major outlet in La Paz...<eos> - Right outside the door.<eos> - All eyes on you.
And you regret that it's drawn the focus away from the issues that we should be speaking about. The struggle to save our country from the social and economic crisis.<eos> - Crisis.<eos> - Crisis.<eos> Man, can I bum one of these? Can I...<eos> Can I take...<eos> Gracias.<eos> Just... Thank you.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, my God. Is this a cigarette?<eos> So bad for you.
...more intimate with the animals. - But it's getting late.<eos> - No, but once you see the animals... Just warming up the llama for you, Senator. ...you'll be more of the collective creative process.<eos> Once we start shooting, you'll see it'll move faster, so...<eos> Walk with me.<eos> Rich, why don't you show him some of your shots?<eos> So, what I'm thinking is that we open on his face.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Is that for the headache?<eos> The Senator might...<eos> And then we do a slow dissolve to you feeding the llama, and then you say, "Llamas supply..."
- That's a huge mistake.<eos> - Well done, Senator.<eos> Is there any coffee left?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You know what, Eddie?<eos> A leader must be a father to his people.<eos> I've always believed that.<eos> Sometimes a father has to be strict with his children for their own good.<eos> The people back there, they don't understand that.<eos> Whatever happens, sir, whatever happens, I'm very proud to be working for you.
I've always believed that.<eos> Sometimes a father has to be strict with his children for their own good.<eos> The people back there, they don't understand that.<eos> Whatever happens, sir, whatever happens, I'm very proud to be working for you.<eos> I've spent my life listening to voters from different backgrounds, different countries, and I've learned that they show tremendous wisdom about the choices facing them.<eos> You give them the information, and they'll make the rational choice.<eos> I think that the people already know what they have to pay attention to.<eos> You ever hear such a load of shit?<eos> You know, when Adlai Stevenson was running for president, a woman came up to him after a rally one night and said,<eos> "Every thinking person will be voting for you."
- Oh, Zach. That's so sweet.<eos> Hey, Hannah.<eos> I'm... I'm probably gonna take out the trash on Tuesdays and Thursdays.<eos> So, you know, you feel like creeping up on someone... that works for me.<eos> All right. I'll keep that in mind, scaredy-cat.<eos> Hannah.<eos> - What are you doing out here?<eos> This is your last warning.<eos> You stay away from us, or something very bad will happen.<eos> I believe you.
I need to do this alone.<eos> I've been running from people my whole life.<eos> I was so angry at the real world that I created these terrible monsters.<eos> Hold that door down.<eos> But I'm not mad anymore.<eos> It's my fault, not this town's.<eos> - Not yours.<eos> - There's gotta be another way.<eos> Hannah, sweetheart... it's time for me to face my demons.<eos> - I believe in you.
- It's a special test where...<eos> Hey, let him go!<eos> This is why he's here.<eos> Don't mess him up. Back off!<eos> I need to see what I'm made of!<eos> Get him in the legs!<eos> Go the legs!<eos> Get up!<eos> Feint to the head, go for the body! Feint to the head!<eos> I can't watch you get hurt, buddy. You're needed in Washington.
Not really.<eos> Never.<eos> I... I apologize for the inconvenience.<eos> I was just venting.<eos> I didn't expect anybody to read them.<eos> Sorry if...<eos> Your letters made me cry, mister Mitchell.<eos> Do you have anyone to talk to?<eos> I... I'm gonna submit your claim to management.<eos> In the meantime is there something else I can do for you, mister Mitchell?
Davis, you've taken things too far.<eos> I am deeply concerned with your well-being.<eos> I'm trying to reach out to you, I'm trying to help, but you refuse!<eos> If you don't wish to participate in the architecture of your wife's legacy, then so be it.<eos> Just contact me so I can free you from this burden.<eos> One more thing.<eos> If you have any respect for the memory of my daughter, you'll erase that fucking message.<eos> This is Karen, customer service.<eos> Hello, Karen, customer service.<eos> Hello, mister Mitchell, what can I do for you today?
Twenty years ago.<eos> And... And we're still here.<eos> "Still"?<eos> Interesting choice of words.<eos> Uh, what else are you working on?<eos> Are you writing something new?<eos> Not thinking of retiring on us, are you?<eos> No, writers don't retire.<eos> We either drink ourselves to death or blow our brains out.<eos> And which will it be for you?
If she'd known you...<eos> If she "knowed" what a girl she has, she'd be here in a minute.<eos> The police said you had well over a $100 with you at the bus station.<eos> I have trouble believing that was your own money.<eos> So, I call taking someone else's money stealing.<eos> So do we, Mr. Ellis.<eos> Surely you don't think this is the first time something like this has happened to me over 20 years?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Well, then how about trusting me to handle it?<eos> It's not you I don't trust.
Oh, that's a lovely country.<eos> We come and see your country, Gilly?<eos> When folks leave, William Ernest, honey, you got to give them a chance to settle in.<eos> Sometimes it's best not to go visiting right away.<eos> Never?<eos> Miss Gilly,<eos> I wasn't quite sure when to give this to you.<eos> But I...<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> We all signed our names in it for you.
G.<eos> A.<eos> L.<eos> A.<eos> D.<eos> Am I going too fast, for you dear?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> R, I, e, I.<eos> Her school records will be sent to you directly.
Bits of their futures and of their pasts.<eos> It's all the same in the end.<eos> - Is it mystical? Or religious?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> I believe in theoretical physics and... biochemistry and that's it.<eos> Whatever it is, I happen to get the deluxe edition of what people now call intuition or gut reaction.<eos> Do you see anything now?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> About you?
I'm out.<eos> Doctor Clancy?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> You're paying for it.<eos> So, we find a tumor... that no one could've known about.<eos> We've established connections between victims that, I freely admit, I could never have seen.<eos> And instead of stepping up and leading from the front, you run out of an autopsy, which you asked for, coincidentally, without any explanation, and now you're packing your bags and you're going home.
Do what you may do, do what you may.<eos> Wisdom is early to despair.<eos> So, be beginning..."<eos> - Hello, John.<eos> - Hello, Charles.<eos> "Nothing can be done to keep at bay age and age's evils, hoar hair, ruck and wrinkle, death's winding sheets, tombs and worms and tumbling to decay."<eos> Anyway, you were right about me.<eos> - I was... What's the word?<eos> - Conflicted.<eos> I was conflicted about you. Yeah.
the kid... gets it.<eos> - What's NFB?<eos> - And you want to gift him that suffering?<eos> Destroy three lives in one, all because of some moral judgment?<eos> We can't play God.<eos> No.<eos> I have no interest in playing God.<eos> As far as His work is concerned, I'm not impressed.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look at you.
- How are you doing?<eos> - I spoke to the chief surgeon.<eos> He said the surgery was a success.<eos> - Good.<eos> - He said the bullet went clean through.<eos> I was hoping you would consider a reinstatement.<eos> As Joe said, we'd make a hell of a team.<eos> Oh no, I want a quiet life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Joe would be proud of you.
I didn't even know they could be killed.<eos> That was the first moment in my life I felt hope.<eos> After that, of course, I followed him around like a stray dog.<eos> And he taught me how to fight, how to shoot.<eos> Tried to show me how to make moonshine once, but that didn't exactly work out.<eos> Moonshine?<eos> Yeah. The still exploded, and we burned our eyebrows right off.<eos> Man, we laughed for days.<eos> Sometimes I think I'm the only person on the planet that ever saw John Connor smile.<eos> He used to tell me about you.
And then the cabin exploded.<eos> I thought the boat was sinking, you know, but it wasn't water coming up from below, it was liquid metal.<eos> T-1000.<eos> Dad told me to swim in a straight line, tracing his finger across my palm.<eos> "You can do this," he said.<eos> "You go, and you don't look back."<eos> His last words to me, and you... You knew them.<eos> How?<eos> It's an impossible memory.<eos> I... I just remembered you taking my hand, and then saying those words. And I was just looking at you, thinking,
- Take care of it, John.<eos> Weeksy, give me a call.<eos> Thanks for everything, Jimmy. We won't forget it.<eos> For me, it's an honor.<eos> The honor's ours.<eos> Thanks, pal.<eos> Hope I'm not interrupting'!<eos> Special Agent John Connolly.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> - I've heard a lot about you.
Bring me cases, that's all the help I need.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, well, I'll leave you to it, then.<eos> Hey, you know, since you're here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That won't work.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh! Why?<eos> Shit!<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> You didn't fucking boy, eh?<eos> You didn't fucking, boy.<eos> You here for die, motherfucker.<eos> Fuck him up, eh? Fuck you up.<eos> Fuck you up.<eos> Commandant, sir.<eos> This is for you, sir.
I promise to fulfill my duty to the fullest...<eos> Two-I-C, shut your mouth!<eos> Get out!<eos> Soldiers.<eos> You are demoting me.<eos> This, my battalion... that I have made with my own hands.<eos> I'm their father!<eos> Your battalion is my battalion, Commandant, as are hundreds of others across this nation.<eos> I want the ceremony of changeover tomorrow, so that Two-I-C can take the battalion back out for battle.<eos> As you know, and with thanks to you, we have the NRC on their heels with the help and support of the UN and ECOMOD.
"I hope you will reconsider my offer.<eos> "The unknown.<eos> "That is where my imagination yearns to venture.<eos> "And so the question plagues me still.<eos> "How does a man come to know the unknowable?<eos> "Sincerely, Herman Melville."<eos> We're closed.<eos> No boarders after 8:00.<eos> You came.<eos> Someone here for you, my love.
Story of the Essex is the story of two men.<eos> Captain George Pollard and his first mate,<eos> Owen Chase.<eos> You don't wanna be late.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Besides, can't have our daughter sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?<eos> What makes you so sure it's a girl?<eos> Well, it has to be.<eos> So she can remind me why I still love you when you're being stubborn.<eos> Well, if it's to be a daughter, she'll be a version of you, not me.
There's no point.<eos> Just go.<eos> God damn it, Matthew.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Well, I'll send a boat for you the minute we get back.<eos> Then we'll play cards back in Nantucket, all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - It's a deal.<eos> - Good.<eos> You want me to open that for you?
It is done.<eos> It is out.<eos> And you've never told anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Not even your wife?<eos> Do you think she could ever love me if she knew the abominations I had committed?<eos> Yes.<eos> She would.<eos> And if you had told me the story when we met, I would still wear your ring today.<eos> The strength of that boy still lives in you.
Yes, and a son or a daughter.<eos> Very well.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - We will draw again.<eos> We will do no such thing.<eos> We'll draw again.<eos> Mr. Ramsdell, you will assume command of this vessel.<eos> Cousin, will you?<eos> You're our... You're our captain.<eos> The men need you.
We are in the oil business.<eos> All of us.<eos> And as in any business, the probability of success must always be greater than the risk incurred.<eos> So, what are you suggesting, George?<eos> That you say the ship ran aground.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> - And that the men that died, drowned.<eos> - And that's another lie.<eos> Think on it.<eos> They will make you captain.
What, then?<eos> - Something else you've given me tonight.<eos> - And what's that?<eos> The courage to go where one does not want to go.<eos> Mr. Melville, what you've heard, what I've told you, will it all be of service to your book?<eos> It will be a work of fiction, Mr. Nickerson, inspired by truth.<eos> But I don't believe I'll feel the need to use all of it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Here. - Take that with you.<eos> - No. The money is for you.
Yes, please, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Williams.<eos> James Dolan from the Tribune.<eos> Really sorry I'm late.<eos> You don't like doing this much, do you?<eos> Well, it comes with the job.<eos> You know what I don't like is people pretending one thing and they got something else on their mind.<eos> You do what I do, you get where I am, you see plenty of that.<eos> People thinking they'll make a nice pie with a slice of me.<eos> Well, I'm only looking to give people some insight into you.
That's your word.<eos> You are offering your fans something.<eos> What would you say that is?<eos> Mr. Dolan, everybody has a little darkness in them.<eos> Now, they may not like it, don't want to know about it, but it's there.<eos> Now, I'm talking about things like anger, misery, sorrow, shame.<eos> And they hear it.<eos> I show it to 'em.<eos> And they don't have to take it home.<eos> You think that's what they expect from you?
This better work.<eos> Let's get the hell out of here!<eos> While the world may not know what you did to save it... The men and the women in this room do.<eos> And so does the President.<eos> That said, we'd like to continue our existing relationship.<eos> So, if we're all in agreement...<eos> We're not.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We're not remotely "all in agreement."<eos> We don't need you or anybody else to keep an eye on us.
And they're made up of layers of tranches.<eos> The highest level, AAA, is getting paid first.<eos> The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last, taking on defaults first.<eos> Now, obviously, if you're buying B's, you could make more money.<eos> But they're a little risky.<eos> Sometimes they fail.<eos> Chris?<eos> Somewhere along the line, these B's and BB's went from a little risky to dog shit.<eos> Where's the trash?<eos> It's right behind you.
How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do?<eos> Say, in the next two quarters.<eos> If your investors panic.<eos> $302 million? I...<eos> My God, Mike.<eos> No one will pull out.<eos> That would be suicide.<eos> I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.<eos> But if they trust me, and they trust me, because...<eos> No one trusts you!
What do we got?<eos> Garibaldi IV, BBB.<eos> Mark, are you sure?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit.<eos> Bullshit on what?<eos> Every fucking thing.<eos> FrontPoint!<eos> FrontPoint!<eos> Is this America's angriest hedge fund?<eos> All right, listen. I got one last question for you.
I couldn't do anything.<eos> I just put him off to the side of the road, and I left him there to die.<eos> You know how I said the people I worked with in the mine left and never came back?<eos> That's not really true.<eos> It was me and four others.<eos> They were older guys, family men, like I said.<eos> You know, the first weeks down there were... awful.<eos> Phones were down.<eos> Radio station went off one by one.<eos> Started getting... claustrophobic, thinking everybody's plotting against you.
It's funny.<eos> It took you... to make me realize that.<eos> You wish I'd never come?<eos> No.<eos> If you weren't here, we wouldn't be so close to finishing the wheel, moving forward, getting electricity.<eos> Truth is, though, you were never a threat to me, Caleb.<eos> I mean, I... I told Ann to do whatever was necessary to keep you from leaving.<eos> All right.<eos> It's funny?<eos> Oh, I don't believe you, sir.
Your earth is a very small part of a very large industry.<eos> Feel my skin.<eos> Oh, wow. In your world, people are used to fighting for resources, like oil, or minerals, or land.<eos> But when you have access to the vastness of space, you realize there's only one resource worth fighting over... even killing for... more time.<eos> Time is the single most precious commodity in the universe.<eos> Unidentified Lycantant.<eos> So, sorry, I just don't understand what you mean when you say, "claim your title."<eos> Well, it's common for people in the first estate to leave a trust for any potential recurrence.<eos> My mother wrote her future self into her will.<eos> Right now, Balem owns the title to earth, but... Once you claim it, the earth will belong to you.
Do you promise to serve our brother Kaulder in all things?<eos> To know him only as he knows himself?<eos> I promise.<eos> So you're the new guy.<eos> We've actually met before.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You see that cornerstone?<eos> I watched them lay it in when this was nothing more than a cornfield.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> I pledge my life and loyalty to you as the 37th Dolan.
The man who came to see me has an odor on his skin.<eos> A whiff of garlic that was not garlic.<eos> Arsenic.<eos> Anything else?<eos> And moldering crabapples.<eos> Thank you, Max.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Not in the habit.<eos> Not you. Him.<eos> So, all that made sense to you?
That's my price.<eos> You know what I'm here for.<eos> So many of us pretend to be something that we're not.<eos> But you, you've lived.<eos> A man who's walked through history.<eos> To have known Napoleon, Stalin,<eos> Hitler...<eos> No need to be nostalgic.<eos> We have enough evil now.<eos> They're not so different than you.
Because I wasn't going to be responsible for the dissolution of The Axe and Cross on my very first...<eos> They're bringing back the Queen.<eos> You don't know what you've done.<eos> I swore an oath to keep it secret.<eos> This lie has kept Apocalypse at bay for hundreds of years.<eos> We were afraid if the Queen's heart was destroyed you'd lose your immortality.<eos> Or die. That wasn't your choice to make!<eos> That's what the old man thought.<eos> The night he was attacked, I think he was going to destroy it.<eos> For you.
You two are supposed to be looking after me.<eos> So why am I playing mother, huh?<eos> Either you start to look like you know what you're doing...<eos> Or I'm out of here.<eos> It's open.<eos> Good evening, Mr. Deveny.<eos> With the compliments of the hotel.<eos> I apologize it wasn't brought up earlier.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
That's because I'm scared.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I'll be...<eos> I'll be close by.<eos> All turned on now?<eos> Uncle Rudi's car has arrived.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> So your Uncle Rudi thinks we should have a little chat.<eos> I know my father is here and that he works for you.
I laced all the drinks.<eos> I don't like to leave much to chance...<eos> Mr. Solo.<eos> I thought I was doing so well.<eos> Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.<eos> You were doing fantastically well.<eos> The fault doesn't lie in your performance.<eos> However, you couldn't control the loyalty of young Gaby.<eos> She gave you up like an unwanted kitten.<eos> I know my father is here and that he works for you.
A priceless lesson was gleaned from his tormentors.<eos> Man has only two masters in this world.<eos> And their names are pain and fear.<eos> The boy found he had quite a talent for eliciting these feelings in others.<eos> So on the principle of playing to your strengths, he decided to make their cultivation his life's work.<eos> Fortunately for this boy, history gave him an unprecedented opportunity.<eos> A world war.<eos> The canvas, Mr. Solo, on which he would produce his greatest work.<eos> You will go here, Mr. Solo.<eos> A whole page just for you.
Kill the Russian, if necessary.<eos> Gentlemen, can you hear me?<eos> Well, now if the Nazis are due to take delivery of this bomb at 0800, then that gives us... A luxurious 14 hours in which to seize the island, secure the warhead, and winkle out poor Professor Teller.<eos> There is also, of course, the small matter of retrieving my agent.<eos> You have British agent in this?<eos> - Well, she's not British.<eos> - "She"?<eos> Here we go.<eos> I'm starting to smell the irony.<eos> Gaby's working for you, isn't she?
The plot is... and stop me if I get this wrong, Jockelson... a stealth attack on the island from the sea.<eos> We shall go in through the front door here at the harbor.<eos> Jockelson and his men will get you in there and keep the enemy entertained.<eos> The rest is up to you.<eos> It's done.<eos> And with three minutes to spare.<eos> The computer disk with your research on it, where is it?<eos> And the backup.<eos> What about Gaby?<eos> She'll be joining you shortly.
I left them in shipping and receiving but i'm sure they'll be right up.<eos> If you don't mind, we'd like to take a photograph with you donating.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Can you give me one second, though?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's me.<eos> The "know-it-all".<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I got something for you, too.
Daisy Miller by Henry James.<eos> Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury.<eos> White Oleander, Janet Fitch.<eos> Very clever.<eos> - How did you know I work here?<eos> - I just tried at the board.<eos> Oh...<eos> You could have mention that in the elevator.<eos> If we'd met in a taller building, I'd have time to cover that.<eos> I don't know about you but... I'm ready for some donating.
I'm so sorry to hear that.<eos> You should have waited for me to contact you.<eos> -Jenny, I'm s...<eos> - There's a reason I don't give out my address.<eos> I'm sorry, honestly.<eos> This not going to work.<eos> I'm moving.<eos> You serious?<eos> Hi.<eos> For you.
I'm fine, I'm okay.<eos> Come on, Christie.<eos> Let's stop playing games right now, okay?<eos> You and Debbie were best friends, went to high school together.<eos> You must've went by Tommy's place at some point or another.<eos> Now, Tommy was moving dope for these guys.<eos> They were in and out of his apartment all the time.<eos> You expect me to believe you never saw him?<eos> I told you, I don't know anything.<eos> I don't believe you!
You shall be queen<eos> Lavender's green dilly, dilly<eos> Lavender's blue<eos> You must love me dilly, dilly<eos> For I love you<eos> But sorrow can come to any kingdom, no matter how happy.<eos> And so it came to Ella's home.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> This must have been very difficult for you.
The weeks away lengthened to months, but every day would bring his thoughts from some distant part.<eos> Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!<eos> Until late one afternoon...<eos> Farmer John?<eos> Miss Ella.<eos> It's your father, miss.<eos> He took ill on the road.<eos> He's passed on, miss.<eos> He's gone.<eos> To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.
And your mother.<eos> I was to give you this.<eos> But what about my lace?<eos> My parasol?<eos> Can't you see?<eos> None of that matters.<eos> We're ruined.<eos> How will we live?<eos> Thank you.<eos> It must have been very difficult for you.
Well, my father does when he's in a good mood.<eos> And where do you live, Mr. Kit?<eos> At the palace.<eos> My father's teaching me his trade.<eos> You're an apprentice?<eos> Of a sort.<eos> That's very fine.<eos> Do they treat you well?<eos> Better than I deserve, most likely.<eos> And you?
It's Kit!<eos> Kit!<eos> Kit! I'm Kit.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Well, we'd better get a move on,<eos> Mr. Kit.<eos> As I said.<eos> On my way.<eos> I hope to see you again, miss.<eos> And I, you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Naughty paint, naughty brush.<eos> Down, please, Samson.<eos> Haven't even got a cushion.<eos> Right, down, down.<eos> Not that...<eos> Oi! I'm on the ground.<eos> I am literally on the ground.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Actually this is a very good angle for you.
Hurry, hurry!<eos> Come back!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!<eos> Wait!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Captain, my horse.<eos> No!<eos> This may be some intrigue to lure you from the palace.<eos> Your father needs you here.
Anastasia and Drisella we will pair off with wealthy lords.<eos> And I shall manage that boy.<eos> But he's not a boy.<eos> And who are you?<eos> How would you rule a kingdom?<eos> Best to leave it to me.<eos> That way we all get what we want.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> I was not able to protect my father from you, but I will protect the prince and the kingdom, no matter what becomes of me.
I'd like to respect that.<eos> You know, my wife has a $12,000 Chihuahua.<eos> Three years running, it got "Best in Show."<eos> The last judge said that he had the best cock and balls he'd ever seen.<eos> But he ain't perfect.<eos> You know how I know that?<eos> He keeps pissing on my boots.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> I mean there's no such thing as perfect.<eos> Now, see, for you, I know this movie's enormous.
Tell me you're not parking there.<eos> My studio, Ed.<eos> Don't force me to revoke your parking privileges.<eos> Fucking asshole.<eos> Who is insane enough to park in my spot, Allen?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Tow it.<eos> Actually, I'm in a good mood. Just spit on it.<eos> Oh, that's my car, Ari.<eos> Travis McCredle's here to see you.
It's amazing.<eos> I told you.<eos> Mwah. Well, I don't need to see the damn movie.<eos> You people do what you do, but, uh, if anybody wants to see more of my money... he still has to go.<eos> Larsen, you heard what happened.<eos> What I heard is he treated my son like a horse's ass... which he is, but that's not really the point.<eos> - You said you have a son, Gold?<eos> - I do. He's 12.<eos> Well, I hope when he grows up, he's not a complete and utter fucking buffoon like mine.<eos> But just in case he is... I hope the people that respect you... at least pretend to respect him.
- What?<eos> - What's on your screen?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm a dead man!<eos> I need the doctor.<eos> Doc Feldman.<eos> It's Johnny Chase.<eos> I've been your patient since you were at the strip mall in Sherman Oaks.<eos> I need you right now, goddamn it, so get your ass out here.
- So what?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You're a coward?<eos> Yes, maybe I am a coward, because violence has never achieved anything<eos> Elser, now tell your girl here why you did this<eos> Did you do this, Georg?<eos> Elsa<eos> Take her away<eos> Where are they taking her?<eos> That's entirely up to you
What's going on...<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Collins?<eos> Do you think I could bother you for a quick picture?<eos> Just real quick.<eos> Real quick, my mom will die.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Ah.<eos> -Ah, awesome.<eos> -Beauty...<eos> -I will tweet this to you.
Well, you look slightly ridiculous.<eos> - Nah.<eos> I look sharp.<eos> -See you at 7:00.<eos> -No, you won't.<eos> Hey, Jamie, don't forget about Nicky.<eos> He's a wonderful boy.<eos> Don't say anything to anyone.<eos> Nicky Ernst!<eos> It's ready for you, sir.
Zeal's not great."<eos> - We got our patter back.<eos> How about that?<eos> We should take this on the road.<eos> You and me.<eos> The new Nichols and May.<eos> Well, May and Nichols.<eos> I would want top billing.<eos> You're good.<eos> I want to drink to you.
Could that have possibly shorted out everything?<eos> No. You're a jerk.<eos> - It's happening in the whole city. - What's happening?<eos> There's no TV or Internet in the whole city?<eos> I am afraid not, sir.<eos> Have you gotten any calls for me from Cardiff?<eos> Jack Dwyer.<eos> Are the phones working?<eos> The phones are working, sir.<eos> But we have no calls from Cardiff for you. - No calls?
All that shit's in the mind, mate.<eos> - It's all up here. - Yep.<eos> You're right, it is. Yeah.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Joe.<eos> Joe, two shots.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I think I am...<eos> I am just going to stick with a beer.<eos> No, it's not for you.
Doctor? !<eos> We need a doctor!<eos> We need a doctor!<eos> We're sorry to hear about your loss.<eos> We're gonna try to make this as, uh, simple and easy as possible.<eos> We need an eyewitness to identify the shooter.<eos> No one's talking or they don't want to be involved.<eos> - Do you remember anything?<eos> - What... what time is it?<eos> It's 6:00 a.m. We know it's been a long night for you, but we got to ask these questions.
Gonna be fine.<eos> You're gonna be fine, Mr. Hope.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Maureen... no... no... I was...<eos> Maureen...<eos> Okay, he wants his copies.<eos> I'll provide that.<eos> I promise.<eos> By day's end.<eos> - If it's okay with you.
Thank you.<eos> We're ready to begin.<eos> The matter this morning is provisional custody of Leila Rae Hope, a minor...<eos> - When can I get her out?<eos> - Don't interrupt, Mr. Hope.<eos> The child has no other family, is that right?<eos> Uh, no, Your Honor.<eos> Uh, both my client and his wife came up through the system.<eos> I see.<eos> So that's why these circumstances are a little bit more painful for you.
- clothe the naked." - Naked?<eos> How is that supposed to--<eos> "Visit the sick, bury the dead."<eos> Oh, just one more thing. In order to make this list work for you, I'm gonna add one essential item.<eos> "Befriend Hashimoto"? !<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> It's your choice, Pepper.<eos> What does that Jap have to do with anything?<eos> Everything.<eos> Your faith won't work if you have even the slightest bit of hatred in you.
- Oh, shut up.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You should go home now.<eos> Is this man bothering you?<eos> No.<eos> He's my friend.<eos> Look, I have no business here with you.<eos> All due respect, I'm going my way.<eos> With all due respect, you're not going anywhere just yet.<eos> AmI a joketo you?
InthenameoftheFather and of the Son andoftheHolySpirit.<eos> You're my only partner.<eos> Do you mind if I sit here?<eos> You know, I... never got to say goodbye to my wife.<eos> By the time I got to the hospital, she was already in a coma.<eos> She died the next morning.<eos> I think it was stupid of me to believe that a midget like me could bring my dad back with some stupid list.<eos> It was not stupid.<eos> It takes courage to believe.<eos> Your father would be more than proud of you.
Ms. Bell, may I suggest at the residency, you put your bed out on the roof under the sky.<eos> I do love the stars at night.<eos> Although I'll have to put out the mosquito netting for you.<eos> The mosquitoes are awful.<eos> Mrs. Lascelles, are we not boring you? No.<eos> Oh, no. No, no, no, no.<eos> Florence.<eos> Florence, will you please come over?<eos> Now?<eos> The new Italian ambassador has a present for you.
I see.<eos> Card trick it is.<eos> You have to come over here.<eos> As you can see, the deck is already shuffled.<eos> The red cards and the black cards are placed at random.<eos> This trick is fiendish.<eos> From this point on, I will not touch the cards.<eos> You'll do everything.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm going to cast a spell over you.
- So... everyone knows about us?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I only said:<eos> "Have you sent an answer?"<eos> And I've heard nothing.<eos> Nothing from him.<eos> I'm worried.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> From dispatch.<eos> I don't have a telegram. But I noticed that the mail woman had this letter for you.

This is true, Gertrude, darling.<eos> "Darling".<eos> You know, I made a big mistake wearing this belt here.<eos> That kind of belt is only worn by bachelors.<eos> And...?<eos> And... the local excavation workers have been trying to find me a wife.<eos> Imagine.<eos> A wife for me. How horrible!<eos> But they heard of your arrival and instant rumour spread that you're my bride, sent from England.<eos> I'm not sure the right man for you had been born yet.
How awful!<eos> - What?<eos> - I want you to have them.<eos> No...<eos> No, it's too much.<eos> Dear...<eos> Have you no said on several occasions you would never give these pistols away?<eos> Well...<eos> Now they are, given away.<eos> Ms. Bell, for you.
- Who would be with you?<eos> - Fattuh. And my men.<eos> What?<eos> I trust them.<eos> You arrived too early.<eos> - Want me to come back later?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - This stallion is for you.
- No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - This stallion is for you.<eos> - For me ? You'll need the best horse in Arabia.<eos> But you're painting it! I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Well...<eos> - Well, what?<eos> - I have to make a confession.<eos> I stole him for you!
- From the Turkish authorities.<eos> From the enemy, so to speak. How?<eos> Well, there were two things I did.<eos> I paid off an editor of a local newspaper to write about a disease spreading among the horses.<eos> Then I took on a false credentials as a vet,<eos> I went straight to the Turkish garrison, I inspected the horses and this here stallion here had to be removed immediately.<eos> And I put him straight into quarantine.<eos> So, His Excellency, the British consul<eos> - Richard Doughty-Wylie...<eos> - I've stolen a horse for you.
For four of the very best dromedaries.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Gertrude, don't leave. Not now.<eos> Richard, I have no choice.<eos> My heart is not ready.<eos> I can feel that.<eos> - Stay for just a few more weeks.<eos> - No, it's late December.<eos> Very soon, the dessert won't be possible.<eos> - I'm longing for you.

Do not say these things.<eos> - It'll all be lonely without you.
- It'll all be lonely without you.<eos> - You have a wife.<eos> It is the most unbearable loneliness to be married unhappily.<eos> This comes at me from nowhere, Richard.<eos> Besides, I could never fully be yours.<eos> You're a married man.<eos> I'll settle everything.<eos> Will you write to me?<eos> I'll write you from every post office in the desert.<eos> I'll keep a diary for you.
Sleep more profound than civilization can thrive.<eos> And then the roadless desert. Again.<eos> Before the tribal wars, this place was alive.<eos> Now there are only ghosts here.<eos> What is this?<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Is it from the consul?<eos> The consul's messenger must have been riding day and night.<eos> We shall stay here tonight.<eos> My beloved, the desert has you and my heart is with you.
More than $50 Billion a year are spent on corrections.<eos> Yet more than 4 in 10 offenders nationwide return to prison within three years of their release.<eos> Eyes for eyes.<eos> Teeth for teeth, times 100!<eos> A prison should be a real deterrent not a goddamn nursing home. I agree!<eos> But medieval torture ain't gonna be the answer.<eos> Something else will.<eos> That's why...<eos> Mr. Boss...<eos> I have a special delivery for you.
Times... 100!<eos> You lost your soul, William Boss.<eos> Oh, excuse me, sir.<eos> May I offer you a top of the line Dominican cigar, governor?<eos> I only smoke Cuban cigars, the world's best.<eos> You are... a native-born citizen of the glorious United States of America.<eos> The greatest nation on earth.<eos> And you are not ashamed to smoke communistic cigars from Cuba?<eos> I'm only a German American from Schweinfurt.<eos> But I feel... deeply ashamed for you, sir!
Thank God for female circumcision!<eos> Private rehearsal!<eos> Let's hear what our zombie governor will have to say.<eos> May I offer you a genuine Dominican Republic cigar?<eos> I only smoke Cuban cigars, best in the world. No!<eos> Just kidding.<eos> After having seen the miracle of the first human-prison centipede I'll never again touch a communistic cigar from Cuba because you... Sir William Boss you are the new American hero.<eos> You are in the Hall of Fame with George Patton<eos> Neil Armstrong and Muhammad Ali.<eos> Thanks to you.
Okay but, uh, just so I understand, beyond our daily coverage, we haven't... We haven't committed any long term investigative resources to the question of whether or not Cardinal Law knew about this.<eos> No, we haven't.<eos> And that's the kind of thing your team would do?<eos> Spotlight?<eos> Well, yeah. But we're still prospecting the Boston PD story I told you about.<eos> Could you set that aside?<eos> We could.<eos> Marty, in past spotlight's had success in large part because they pick their own projects.<eos> Would you consider picking this one?<eos> I don't know if he's writing about you, but I will let him know you called.
Married a nun. Here.<eos> This is his testimony from the Kos case.<eos> Phil, what's a treatment center?<eos> It's where they send priests when they get caught.<eos> This is all here in the box.<eos> I sent this to you guys five years ago.<eos> Uh, to the Globe?<eos> Who did you send it to?<eos> I don't wanna say who but they said they weren't interested.<eos> But we did run a couple stories on you.
I haven't heard back from you.<eos> I left you a couple of messages.<eos> I've been very busy. I... I don't have time for calls.<eos> I'm sure you don't.<eos> Listen, listen, Mitch. Let me talk to a couple of the victims.<eos> You could sit in on the interview.<eos> If you're not happy, you could kill it.<eos> I spoke to my clients. They don't want to be in the press.<eos> I'm sorry. I get that but I don't need to name names.<eos> I don't believe you, Mr.Rezendes. I'm sure you don't.
And did you follow up on that?<eos> Do you guys need anything else? Yes.<eos> Why aren't there any records?<eos> I was down at the courthouse earlier.<eos> There aren't any records of any of these settlements.<eos> We dealt directly with the Church.<eos> We would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chancery.<eos> You never filed anything in court?<eos> It's a private mediation.<eos> So, this is just you and the archdiocese's lawyers in a room?
Well, the Church is an institution, Mike, made of men.<eos> It's passing.<eos> My faith is in the eternal.<eos> I try to separate the two.<eos> Sounds tricky.<eos> It is.<eos> Especially since the Church continues to go after me.<eos> It takes a toll, Mike.<eos> They'll try to silence anyone who speaks out.<eos> I'm sure they'll come after you and your team soon enough.
Robby, after we saw Macleish, I started going back through the clips.<eos> And I had a little time last week finally.<eos> So, um, I found that.<eos> It's from '93.<eos> That it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's...that's it.<eos> Good night.<eos> Okay. Good night.<eos> Hello. So, I was probably a few years after you, right?
I'm sorry. We're closed.<eos> Come on, five minutes.<eos> Here.<eos> This is the Geoghan case?<eos> That's right.<eos> Those records are sealed.<eos> No. That's a public motion.<eos> Those records are public.<eos> Look, I work for the Globe.<eos> Good for you.
'...the opponents of drug legalisation 'were growing more powerful... '...violence perpetrated by employees...<eos> 'How do you respond to the accusation that you gave the order...?<eos> 'Here we go - innovator, a corporate genius, a spiritual leader, 'which brings us neatly back to why.'<eos> 'Why what?<eos> ' 'Why does everyone trust you?
This is how it is.<eos> I'm this close to throwing you back to whoever was trying to kill you.<eos> I know you're frightened, but you have to trust someone or I can't help you.<eos> - If I keep you somewhere safe...<eos> - You can't keep me against my will.<eos> With no positive ID, I can do what the hell I like.<eos> I'm just trying to help you here.<eos> Why do people call you Dreck?<eos> Because we clean up the shit that nobody else wants to.<eos> Are all police like you?
I had no other option but to move out here.<eos> I use only what radiation I need, I stay alive.<eos> What do mean "reject"?<eos> You receive a phone call within five feet of me, I get a headache.<eos> You make two, my brain starts to embolise.<eos> Three, it starts dribbling out my ears.<eos> I need you to do a DNA test for me.<eos> Money.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come back same time tomorrow, I have something for you.
Big deal.<eos> - Oh, yeah, big deal.<eos> But look at the date.<eos> It just needs resetting.<eos> - That's one explanation.<eos> - What's the other one?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> - The watch isn't wrong.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> No, it's correct, but not to you, not now.
Now let me think.<eos> Wasn't it your birthday this week?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> That's not the magic.<eos> This is.<eos> I-I-I'm not supposed to eat those.<eos> My mum says.<eos> It'll be our little secret.<eos> I told you, we don't want anything from you.
You have no idea what you've done.<eos> What do you know?<eos> You're just a Dreck.<eos> Just the scum who clear up after the scum!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Where is he?<eos> How did you find him?<eos> The beauty of it is he found us.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at you.
- All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's accept that there is a world where I know, with absolute certainty, the exact time of your death.<eos> Now, you want me to tell you or not?<eos> Yeah, of course I would.<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> But what if accepting my death is what causes it?<eos> So the answer is yes.<eos> I would want you to tell me.<eos> - But I wouldn't believe you.
Back in the mud so soon?<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> Absolutely savage depiction of me, I'm afraid.<eos> Got the hair all wrong, and the nose, too.<eos> I'm new to this criminal life, but I never thought the authorities would attack my vanity.<eos> They think I'm a murderer!<eos> I've been called much worse things in my time.<eos> Besides... they're not looking for you are they?<eos> They're looking for a piteous, nameless hunchback.<eos> And Igor, I would like you to look at yourself.
Wipe your hands.<eos> Animals.<eos> Parts.<eos> I am a student at the Royal College of Medicine.<eos> The curriculum is straightforward, the exams easy, the professors...<eos> Oh! The professors are men of limited ability and even more limited horizon.<eos> Why did you rescue me?<eos> You, my friend, were an unexpected gift.<eos> It's not every day I come across a man, albeit one suffering from such grotesque deformity who is so clearly talented, observant, and resourceful and in possession of the most gifted pair of hands I have ever seen.<eos> My interest in you does not stem from charity.
Sperm!<eos> Sperms!<eos> Can sperm move?<eos> They can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why can't it move independently towards the egg in, say, a bucket?<eos> Where does the mother fit in?<eos> Exactly!<eos> You're off educating yourself!<eos> By the time we need you, we're sucking the fertilized egg up into a funnel and then we shuck it up your...
No.<eos> He's very clever, and he is kind.<eos> He just finds ordinary people very ordinary.<eos> Victor, how did you... Who are you?<eos> You're the fallen angel.<eos> Plummeted from any other great heights lately?<eos> Maybe you should try this one.<eos> It's only, oh all of 30 feet.<eos> You've had worse.<eos> I'm afraid the only thing plummeting here is my opinion of you, Mr. Frankenschteen.

You have created life out of nothing!<eos> Do you realize how significant this is?<eos> Oh, I have an inkling.<eos> You are to accompany me to the college tomorrow.<eos> I've announced that I'll be making a presentation of my private work.<eos> I'm coming to the college with you?<eos> As your assistant?<eos> Igor, try not to be quite so dim.<eos> From this day forth you are to be my partner.<eos> Letter for you, Miss Lorelei.
They can survive 40 days without food.<eos> Not under those conditions, Laurence.<eos> It's 100 degrees down there.<eos> Do you know what that's like?<eos> It's a tomb!<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> I know that your heart is in the right place.<eos> And where's yours?<eos> It's not about you!
The total reckless abandon that you have absolutely no control over, Mr. Beale.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I prefer to stand when I'm getting it from behind.<eos> You watch your tone.<eos> If you're gonna come at me, you better come hard and fast and be willing to go all the way, because I never lose.<eos> Klaus, listen.<eos> You call me Mr. Meisner.<eos> My best friends and associates call me Klaus, but you, sir, are neither.<eos> You are an employee.<eos> I don't work for you.

Mom just go for a while, okay?<eos> Be a good boy yes, Rico!<eos> Rico!<eos> Hey, do not cry, little sister ... Kayuki, who is this?<eos> Is not this supposed to be me?<eos> The fat is supposed to be me, right? Hey, do not cry, I'll be fine ..<eos> 251 00:29:12,400 -- 00:29:14,400 Basic crybaby<eos> Nothing awaits us<eos> Big Brother<eos> This, you may take this
Take a walk with me.<eos> - Is this Lisa?<eos> - Yeah. - This can't be Lisa.<eos> - It is.<eos> Lisa's this big.<eos> They get taller.<eos> Come on. - Do you remember me?<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> I'm your dad's friend, Steve Wozniak.<eos> I apologize, I don't remember you.
- Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Steve.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm feeling good, Joel.<eos> How about you?<eos> I don't think I could be in your business.<eos> It changes too quickly.<eos> Well, I'd hang on, 'cause yours is about to start changing pretty quickly, too.<eos> This is the third time in 14 years I'm writing about you.
You spend hours in endless motels... Cars. Planes.<eos> But around you, his behavior is unique.<eos> He expresses himself.<eos> Emotions other than that blank, happy thing he's got going on.<eos> You're the one person he's had any kind of meaningful interaction with that didn't end in a bullet.<eos> So are you safe?<eos> Are you in danger?<eos> Well, let me put it to you this way.<eos> You're clearly an asset to him.<eos> Which makes you an asset to me.
Can you pass me another one, sweetheart?<eos> Yep.<eos> Got it, got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Tamale sale.<eos> - And car wash. - Team fundraiser.<eos> This afternoon.<eos> - Can you help me with this, babe?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My boys running for you, they need new uniforms, and better shoes.
You had your shot and ya blew it.<eos> I'm not following you.<eos> Yeah, whatever you say, stalky.<eos> It's over.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> Whoa, she went from zero to psycho in 3.4 seconds, a new world record.<eos> Hey, Steve-O.<eos> There's a crazy woman following me.<eos> I guarantee she's here to shoot the President.<eos> And if I were you, I'd break out the billy club and go full throttle on her, seriously.
And all those machines, they recalled them, they reprogrammed them, because there were glitches in the original code.<eos> You can see from the giant space bugs, the way they come swooping' in.<eos> Kind of ziggy-zaggy.<eos> Ziggy-zag?<eos> Is that the snobby term?<eos> So someone designed these space bugs after an old out-of-print version of a video game from 30 years ago that nobody would know today?<eos> Does she really get to talk twice?<eos> She's not even at the grown-ups table.<eos> I'm sorry. Is this a National Security Council meeting, or a dorm-room drug party?<eos> Our nation has just been attacked by an unknown military force. If this gets out to the press that we're pinning the blame on some old computer game, they'll not only mock you in the news, Mr. President, they'd impeach you!
- What's all this then, mate?<eos> - Hey, I got this. Hi.<eos> We're Americans.<eos> Our Navy SEALs were given permission by your government to prepare for an extraterrestrial invasion, which we believe will occur at these coordinates in approximately 60 minutes.<eos> We're shootin' a beer commercial.<eos> Right, then. Break a leg, then, yeah?<eos> What was that, man?<eos> Why'd you lie to him?<eos> I'm trying not to cause total panic, Yank.<eos> And, you... I don't want to hear another word out of you. All right?
And I've resurrected him three times since then.<eos> And each time, he's more loyal.<eos> - More grateful.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> Well, we have a client that Madeline is a perfect match for.<eos> And the girl's organs will not be wasted.<eos> Yes, it was built to withstand 500,000 milligray of radiation.<eos> It's quite bulletproof.<eos> You know, Damian, every medical advance has a cost.<eos> These choices that you're making and what you're doing, they don't make you a savior. You know that, right?

You know that, right?<eos> They make you a psychopath.
You see, sometimes I do listen to the doctor's orders.<eos> Well played.<eos> But...<eos> If you kill me, you commit suicide.<eos> Because without the full course of those pills, well, you relapse.<eos> You relapse.<eos> And we both know who takes over, don't we?<eos> You see, I'm the only one with the answers, Damian.<eos> You need me.<eos> I'm the only one standing between you and oblivion.
Thanks.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Ed Kidner.<eos> I was a friend of your father's.<eos> - May I sit?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I spent a lot of time with him.<eos> At the end, in particular.<eos> I know that you two, you weren't always close.<eos> If you could hear him talk about you, he was... proud.

He wants me to clean up my mess. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> - I think we should wait for Jimmy to get here.<eos> - Maybe you shouldn't think so much.<eos> You don't smoke in my house.<eos> The place looks nice.<eos> - I haven't been here since--<eos> - Since Mom's funeral.<eos> It was nice of you to show up.<eos> Well, I heard there was free booze.<eos> It's funny to you.
Catching up to me.<eos> I can go in.<eos> I need orange, red, green.<eos> I win.<eos> Green!<eos> Yellow.<eos> I'm getting over here.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> The cops are on their way.<eos> I'd get the hell out of here, if I were you.
It's awesome.<eos> Oh, God, I just love this fucking night!<eos> I love it!<eos> I wish we had known you guys back in our day, you know?<eos> Well, I'd say it's still your day, ma'am.<eos> Thank you, Richie.<eos> Stand up.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Come on, stand up.<eos> Oh, my God, just look at you.
Well, I'd say it's still your day, ma'am.<eos> Thank you, Richie.<eos> Stand up.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Come on, stand up.<eos> Oh, my God, just look at you.<eos> You are just perfect.<eos> Damn!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, damn, look at you.
He said,<eos> "Nothing."<eos> Yeah...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Could you point to the man?<eos> Let the record show the witness points to the defendant.<eos> Do you know the defendant?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I am the manager at the Starbucks where he worked.<eos> How long did he work for you?
I just stayed there, thinking about my children.<eos> Why do you think she would do this?<eos> Why not just take the kids and leave?<eos> She told me once that if I ever left her, she wouldn't be able to go on.<eos> And so by doing this maybe she was trying to show me how much I meant to her.<eos> Maybe she thought she could make something good out of two things that were bad.<eos> Like a double negative.<eos> The defense rests.<eos> Court adjourned.<eos> I have something for you.
Is it too cold for you in here?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Is... Is he okay?<eos> I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> Well, we don't talk as much anymore.<eos> That's two of us.<eos> I haven't seen a woman in so long.<eos> Looking at you is like seeing the ocean.<eos> I'm more of a pond, I think.<eos> Can I play you something?
For the murder of Madison Longo,<eos> Zachary Longo, and Sadie Longo, to this question, the jury has answered yes.<eos> The jury is dismissed.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's done.<eos> I'll be outside.<eos> Order.<eos> Order.<eos> Mr. Longo, you had the opportunity to spare the relatives of your victims further pain by admitting the true extent of your crime.<eos> Instead, you manipulated this court like you manipulated your family despite the overwhelming evidence against you.

Where's Kyle?<eos> Which one of you is next?<eos> He's a madman!<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> You crazy, man!<eos> You crazy!<eos> Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.<eos> Now I can get my gold sticker.<eos> Hey, Mr. Piwate.<eos> I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
Are you gonna help me?<eos> - One down, bro.<eos> - Will you take something apart too?<eos> I'm holding the light.<eos> I'd like you to take something apart.<eos> That way I'm not doing this...<eos> "Help me take it apart."<eos> The guy with no screwdriver.<eos> Okay.<eos> For you, sir.
Why don't you ask me something you wanna know?<eos> Earlier you said that there are some people who know you well.<eos> Why do I have the feeling that that is not true?<eos> Mr Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room<eos> Cancel it please, we're not finished here<eos> Yes sir.<eos> No I um...<eos> I can go<eos> - Its fine<eos> - I would like to know more about you.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe I am.<eos> You right?<eos> Was it Tom's hat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did they find anything else?<eos> No.<eos> What are you doing about it?<eos> We're doing everything we can, Mr Parker.<eos> Neil McPherson's made a complaint against you.
Bill, hey. Dan Trunkman.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just a little thrown.<eos> I saw Chuck Portnoy from Dynamic Progressive Systems... and she mentioned... that she's gonna see you, Bill, also.<eos> Urn, it was my understanding that we were done, really... that we were just going to do a walkthrough for you and shake hands.<eos> Maid service.<eos> Come in.<eos> Anyway, Bill, can you give me a holler back about this?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Good afternoon to you.
Or "Machetes."<eos> My wife has "Machos." Or "Machetes", I don't know.<eos> I just call them "Nancy's pants."<eos> Chuck just showed us... your redbook rates only make sense if we're doing buybacks.<eos> I'm not doing buyback deals until it's out the door and we refactor market.<eos> I just wanna be clear that those are the terms now.<eos> So, Jim, you're opening the deal back up?<eos> Well, it wasn't closed quite, Dan.<eos> So, I just wanted to hear you both under these new terms today.<eos> Just you and Chuck, that's all.
Yeah, we know that.<eos> It's an old trick.<eos> The guy's old who...<eos> Fire him.<eos> No.<eos> He worked extremely hard on this sheet.<eos> I stand by what he did.<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> Jeez.<eos> We think we would be a complement to you... not only on this job, but in the future.

So 40 years at the phonebook company?<eos> That is amazing, seriously.<eos> Okay, Benjamin. Now, I'm gonna ask you one of our more telling questions for all of our interns, so I want you to... this is the one to really think about, okay?<eos> And take your time.<eos> Where do you see yourself in 10 years?<eos> When I'm 80?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Wait. Did not realize you were 70.<eos> That's... that question doesn't work for you, does it?
- Hi. Hi.<eos> - Does that feel okay?<eos> - It feels great, actually.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay. You're a little bit tight, Ben.<eos> Well, I haven't sat at a desk for a while. My body's not used to it.<eos> No, I get it.<eos> Plus, they say sitting is the new smoking.<eos> Let me see what I can do.<eos> I spotted you in the lunchroom.
I'm so slammed next week.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If you want to go, I'll make it. When was it?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry. I was fixated on this tissue paper.<eos> I will be there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you for the coffee.<eos> Thanks for letting me play. - Sorry.<eos> - I'll meet you in the car.
No, please don't apologize.<eos> You have done nothing wrong.<eos> Look, I have a lot going on, and I'm a very private person.<eos> And at first, I don't know, I thought maybe this wasn't gonna work, but I was wrong.<eos> - Let me get one of those.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Jules, no explanation necessary.<eos> Please.<eos> No, actually, one is because I am usually better than this.<eos> The truth is... Something about you makes me feel calm or more centered or something, and I could use that.
Very sorry you had to see that.<eos> Humiliating.<eos> It's all good.<eos> You feeling better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I forgot you got to eat before you drink.<eos> I'm good now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm leaving in a minute.<eos> Just working on making this the worst possible day for you.
Oh, my God, you're all nuts.<eos> I'm 100%.<eos> Let's move on, kids.<eos> Big day. Lots to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ben... If I am giving you too much to do or working you too hard, please do not feel that you have to go with me to San Francisco.<eos> Jules, people my age get tired sometimes. That's all this is.<eos> You're tired?<eos> That's why you haven't looked at me once since I came over here?<eos> I'm looking at you.
I haven't called Townsend yet, but... I still feel like it's the right thing to do.<eos> Well... - I didn't sleep so well myself.<eos> - Over this?<eos> You remember the day I drove you to the warehouse? You were giving me the wrong directions and all that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, I stood in the back, and I watched you show the workers how to fold and box the clothes.<eos> I knew then that was why ATF was a success.<eos> No one else is ever gonna have that kind of commitment to your company, Jules.<eos> To me, it's pretty simple.<eos> About The Fit needs you, and if you don't mind me saying, you need it.
007?<eos> Sir?<eos> I don't know what you're playing at, but whatever it is, it has to stop.<eos> Now.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> - Not remotely.<eos> 007, I'd like you to meet Max Denbigh, head of the Joint Security Service.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
A train bombing in Hamburg and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.<eos> It's not great timing for us.<eos> It's all rather playing into C's hands.<eos> M, well, let's say he's feeling the pressure.<eos> Yeah, I've noticed.<eos> Now, this way, 007.<eos> Be careful.<eos> It's a trifle slippery.<eos> Q wasn't exactly feeling at home in Whitehall, what with the new merger, so he set up shop here, away from prying eyes, as it were.<eos> I hear he's got something rather special planned for you.
Allows us to track your movements in the field.<eos> You see those readouts?<eos> We can monitor your vital signs from anywhere on the planet.<eos> Well, that sounds marvelous.<eos> Call it a post-Mexico insurance policy.<eos> By direct order of M.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> Good.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I've just... got one last thing for you and you can be on your way.
I completely understand.<eos> Good.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I've just... got one last thing for you and you can be on your way.<eos> Magnificent, isn't she?<eos> Zero to 60 in three point two seconds.<eos> Fully bulletproof.<eos> A few little tricks up her sleeve.<eos> It's a shame, really.<eos> She was meant for you, but she's been reassigned to 009.
Yes, fine.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> - You knew my husband?<eos> - All too briefly.<eos> - What do you do?<eos> - Life insurance.<eos> A little late for that.<eos> For your husband, yes.<eos> But what about you?
He was an assassin.<eos> Trust me, he won't take it personally.<eos> You signed my death warrant.<eos> I was respected.<eos> - Loyal to a man you hated.<eos> - He trusted my silence.<eos> With him gone, I'm a dead woman.<eos> - I can trust nobody.<eos> - I know the feeling well.<eos> Well, I can tell you that I don't trust you.
- What did you do?<eos> - I disobeyed him.<eos> I followed him as far as I could.<eos> He... - changed.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> You grew a conscience.<eos> Our game is our game.<eos> But this?<eos> Women, children...<eos> Well, the thallium would suggest that he doesn't like you very much anymore.
- Did you kill him?<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> He did it himself.<eos> And you came all the way just to tell me this?<eos> That my father's dead?<eos> I came to tell you that your life is in danger and I need your help.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I made a deal with him to protect you.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Why would he trust you?
You need to take a breath and calm down.<eos> You're in shock.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Just get away!<eos> Did it cross your mind that you led them to me?<eos> I haven't got time for this.<eos> You need to tell me everything you know about L'Americain.<eos> Go to hell!<eos> I gave your father my word!<eos> And why should I trust you?
It's your inheritance.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> This can't be it.<eos> Well, here's to your father.<eos> I promised myself I would never be hurt by that man again.<eos> I cut off all contact.<eos> I didn't want anything to do with him or his sick life.<eos> And then, with his dying breath... he sends me you.
I'll mourn my father in my own time, Mr. Bond.<eos> And, now, I'm going to bed.<eos> Don't think for one moment this is where I fall into your arms, seeking solace for my dead daddy.<eos> You sit there.<eos> Keep watch.<eos> That's what you're good at.<eos> Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> Look.<eos> There are two of you.
Nothing.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - It's coordinates.<eos> Your father was scanning for a particular satellite phone.<eos> He was looking for someone.<eos> He was looking for him.<eos> And he sent me here to finish the job.<eos> - I'm coming with you.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - I like you alive.
I'm sorry.<eos> Miss Kelly...<eos> I hadn't forgotten.<eos> Spit it out, whatever it is.<eos> I'm away to America.<eos> Whose idea was that?<eos> Father Flood in New York arranged it.<eos> Rose used to play golf with him.<eos> He sponsored me. And he found me a job and got me a visa.<eos> Well, we won't be needing you back here.
I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley and I share responsibility for this.<eos> Ethan Hunt was part of a disgrace intelligence agency which is since been dissolved.<eos> And he's gone rogue, unfortunately intend on dismantling an imaginary terror network.<eos> But new intelligence suggest that he's been manipulated by one of your own former agents.<eos> Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.<eos> She disappeared 2 years ago.<eos> And if you don't mind I asking, what do I have to do with this phantom network?<eos> Sir, this is William Brandt, a former colleague of Hunt's.<eos> He came forward with first hand knowledge of the plot against you. Sir.<eos> Hunt is in possession of a virtual red box that can only be open by you.
- I'm here to see the Prime Minister.<eos> - We were told not to let anybody in.<eos> - By whom?<eos> - By you, sir.<eos> Hunley, what is this?<eos> Security!<eos> Chief Attlee. Kind of you to accepted our invitation.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> We know you created the Syndicate.<eos> But Lane went rogue and turn it against you, didn't he?
Christchurch, Barrock's Hill, Old Milton and arriving at Eastborough at 1:48.<eos> I'd like to remind you at this time to have your tickets ready for inspection.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tickets, please. Ta.<eos> Lovely. Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Tickets and passes, please.<eos> Tickets, please.<eos> Good, thank you, sir.<eos> Excuse me madam, tickets?<eos> I'll get that for you.
You've been too old since you turned 22.<eos> You're one of those people that lives their entire life in the past, in the future and never gives a thought to the present.<eos> I know because I'm one of those people too.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'll take you somewhere new.<eos> You are one of those hopeless romantics. That's what you are.<eos> Oh... I bet you fall in love with a new girl every day.<eos> No.<eos> Well, there is a girl in the bathroom over there taking a shit who will make you forget all about me.<eos> And I don't make enough money for you. That's the real problem.
Now you sound like my husband.<eos> He owns a strip club.<eos> I was in love with a stripper once.<eos> I bet you still are.<eos> I bet she has a heart of gold too.<eos> You're very pretty, Janet.<eos> Yeah, the boys still whistle sometimes.<eos> I looked it up. You still get your period when you get your tubes tied.<eos> I found your tampons under the bathroom sink.<eos> I haven't forgotten about you.
How soon can you be here?<eos> Send some uniforms over first then.<eos> His dog is growling and I left my heater in the car.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> So you're the eye.<eos> I'm the eye.<eos> You're very cute, Mr. Sampson.<eos> Am I supposed to know what that phone call was in, uh, relation to?<eos> I don't expect you to.<eos> I imagine there's dozens of reasons the homicide boys would be interested in you.
Dorothy was a friend.<eos> Yes, you mentioned that.<eos> Even still... I would feel better paying you.<eos> I'd like to interview each of you separately, to find out as much about Dorothy as I can.<eos> Would it be all right if I started with your daughter?<eos> I suppose that's all right.<eos> Look, I haven't had breakfast yet. I haven't eaten for days for that matter. So I'll just be downstairs in the restaurant when you're ready for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> I... I don't know what your night with my granddaughter meant to you, Mr. Sampson.
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.<eos> His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.<eos> She's creating tissue.<eos> If you brought him to my lab, the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.<eos> Oh, he's flat-lining.<eos> Call it. Time?<eos> No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.<eos> I'm gonna be made of plastic.<eos> Here's your beverage.<eos> You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.
Here's your beverage.<eos> You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.<eos> Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.<eos> I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> That I can't fix.<eos> This is the next thing, Tony.<eos> Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.<eos> That is exactly the plan.<eos> And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.<eos> Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.
Don't take from my pile.<eos> Hello, Deere.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> What ails you?<eos> Do me a favour.<eos> Try not to bring it to life.<eos> Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.<eos> I get it.<eos> Maria Hill called you, right?<eos> Was she ever not working for you?
Parties unknown.<eos> Do we have an ally?<eos> Ultron's got an enemy.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.<eos> I have you.
- But with it on our side...<eos> Are you?<eos> On our side?<eos> I don't think it's that simple.<eos> Well, it better get real simple real soon.<eos> I am on the side of life.<eos> Ultron isn't.<eos> He will end it all.<eos> What's he waiting for?<eos> - You.
Love, Bella.<eos> Hello.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Hello there.<eos> I am looking for a toy for my son, Henry.<eos> Perhaps you've heard of him, he's a pirate.<eos> Oh, dear, this is not quite the store I expected.<eos> No, I suppose not those kind of toys.<eos> It's not my night.<eos> What's... what's that behind you?
Don't look at me.<eos> - Hello.<eos> No, you look lovely.<eos> I can't believe you're in our room.<eos> We came here from Akron just to hear you speak. - Oh, my God.<eos> Please don't look at me.<eos> - Well, I'm certainly very flattered.<eos> - You can look at me.<eos> - Emily.<eos> Is there something we can do for you? I mean...
I guess.<eos> I don't know what the hell you're getting at.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I love you.<eos> - Right, I'm leaving. - No, no.<eos> Look.<eos> I've never talked to you like this before.<eos> It has not been appropriate.<eos> Perhaps it's not still, but I've been unable to contain myself this morning. I love you.<eos> And I want what's best for you.
I've never talked to you like this before.<eos> It has not been appropriate.<eos> Perhaps it's not still, but I've been unable to contain myself this morning. I love you.<eos> And I want what's best for you.<eos> And if you need to have an affair, I understand, but have it with me.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Have it with anyone at all, anybody, just not Lisa.<eos> No.<eos> Wait!<eos> We're all here for you.
Ben doesn't even have a car.<eos> You don't know Ben.<eos> Satanic worship is not uncommon.<eos> It's made its way into all areas of the community, and part of their rituals involve the degradation of children.<eos> Do you have any evidence?<eos> Any witnesses? Besides some 12-year-old girls...<eos> We got the note Ben left in Krissi cates' locker.<eos> We need to speak to a lawyer.<eos> You do realize that abuse usually starts at home.<eos> Mrs. day, with three little girls, if I were you, I'd want the truth out more than anyone.
Can you take these and show me exactly what happened?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Krissi?<eos> Krissi, I'm Patty day.<eos> I'm Ben's mom.<eos> I don't want her here.<eos> - I don't want her here!<eos> You promised! - Okay.<eos> Okay. We're not safe!<eos> We've heard about you.
You snooped in his room?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Patty?<eos> It's Joseph, from the fha.<eos> Joseph, I can't find the money.<eos> I've had a rough day.<eos> Yes, I heard about Ben.<eos> I wasn't going to phone you.<eos> But how should I say this.<eos> Patty, I trust you.
He claims it gets pretty dangerous there at night.<eos> It's not Union City.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, there's my ride.<eos> - Hi. - Hello.<eos> Carol Aird.<eos> Richard Semco.<eos> Glad to meet you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Therese speaks very highly of you.
I was making a joke and it didn't, uh...<eos> Ah, here she is.<eos> My Aunt Adele.<eos> My uncle commissioned Gustav Klimt to paint her.<eos> That's quite a painting.<eos> It's magnificent.<eos> She was taken off the walls of our home by the Nazis, and since then, she's been hanging in the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna.<eos> And now you'd like to be reunited.<eos> Wouldn't that be lovely?<eos> Make you a rich woman, I'm sure.
They destroyed my family, they killed my friends, and they forced me to abandon the people and the places that I loved.<eos> That was over a half a century ago.<eos> You think that's a long time?<eos> It would be a few days, that's it.<eos> We'd be in and out.<eos> Randy, you're not listening to me.<eos> I would rather die than go back there, not for all the paintings in the world.<eos> Anyway... a week ago, you weren't even interested in the case, and now you're all over me like a rash... what happened?<eos> Against my better judgment,<eos> I think I like you.
No.<eos> You had to be eradicated from history.<eos> So the paintings reached the Belvedere.<eos> In 1941.<eos> Your uncle, Maria, died...<eos> At the end of the war, 1945.<eos> So, contrary to the request in Adele's will, the paintings ended up in the Belvedere well before his death.<eos> And if I'm not mistaken, he wrote his own will before he died.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Leaving everything he owned, or at least what was left of it, to you and your sister, his only living heirs.
That's $29, sir.<eos> - Thank you, Mrs. Scheff.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fancy seeing you again, after all this time.<eos> Belvedere catalog, on sale in Barnes Noble on Wilshire.<eos> And hello to you, too.
Thank you very much, Mr. Schoenberg...<eos> I'm sure this will prove to be a riveting read.<eos> Let's adjourn for ten minutes.<eos> This is a domestic matter for Austria.<eos> Anything else would be a violation of its national sovereignty.<eos> After all, there is a forum for Mrs. Altmann to pursue her case in Austria... without resorting to American courts and American taxpayers' money.<eos> I applaud Mr. Gould's concern for the American taxpayer, but taking the defendant to court in Austria would require that Mrs. Altmann be a multimillionairess.<eos> It's not an option.<eos> As a matter of fact, we've exhausted all other options.<eos> If we hadn't, we wouldn't be standing before you today.
This is a setback, absolutely...<eos> Dr. Dreimann.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Schoenberg.<eos> An unexpected outcome, which, no doubt...<eos> - ...has delighted you.<eos> - You're a very busy man.<eos> I would urge you to consider mediation.<eos> There will be no mediation, Mr. Schoenberg.<eos> You've been exceptionally lucky today, but make no mistake, we'll take this to the Supreme Court, if we have to.<eos> Good day to you.
Good, now say it again, but with an American accent.<eos> If you say it like this, then nobody will understand you.<eos> You can talk.<eos> You sound like a silly Frankfurter.<eos> I am a man, not a sausage.<eos> Maria Altmann!<eos> Which one of you is Maria Altmann?<eos> - I am.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Telegram for you.
Okay, Lucy's jumped in.<eos> - It's okay, I can take her.<eos> - You take her.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, when?<eos> You are?<eos> You know, you sound the same.<eos> You sound the same that you did 50 years ago.<eos> Well, I just...<eos> Well, I just want to say that I love you so much, mom.
- It's okay, I can take her.<eos> - You take her.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, when?<eos> You are?<eos> You know, you sound the same.<eos> You sound the same that you did 50 years ago.<eos> Well, I just...<eos> Well, I just want to say that I love you so much, mom.<eos> You know, I just love you so much.
Agent Bendix.<eos> What an unpleasant surprise.<eos> - Amanita Caplan.<eos> - Shall I fill in my answers now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> And Australia.<eos> The problem is...<eos> I don't believe you.
It would be difficult for you to grasp the depths to which I had fallen, or the guilt that plagued me, without grasping the scale of this monster called the East India Company.
Yes.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> My mother asked me to make sure you come to supper.<eos> She had her doubts you would.<eos> Will you join us?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course I will.<eos> And so, the days stretched into weeks.<eos> When I was with you, Charlotte, the darkness seemed further away.<eos> We're all very fond of you, as I hope you know.
So, you negotiate the deal with him, and I'll split the amount with you.<eos> I assumed a man of the cloth would use a report like that to expose the evil wrought by Mr. Kemp.<eos> But you aren't a man of the cloth, are you, Will?<eos> I have found a new life.<eos> A vicar?<eos> Isn't that an absurd mask for you to wear?<eos> What if it's not a mask?<eos> So, you have told her who you are.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> And see what the lady thinks of you then.
I know of no man who is.<eos> Certainly, you deserve better than anything that I can...<eos> I'm not a good man.<eos> But I decided to be.<eos> The thought of losing you, it's more than I can bear.<eos> You embody God's mercy for me.<eos> It's a mercy that I'm beginning to appreciate, though...<eos> I don't deserve it.<eos> I guess what I'm trying to say is... please don't go to America.<eos> I don't want to be separated from you.
- Welcome.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - What goes on here?<eos> - All in good time, sir.<eos> Gentlemen... my men and I are loyal servants of the King.<eos> We fear the consequences that may come to these 13 colonies... should these rascals succeed in unifying their Continental Congress.<eos> But, gentlemen, I have a plan.<eos> When they speak with their treacherous tongues, we shall reply with loyal fists.<eos> You will have to recruit or to destroy those around you.<eos> I look at you now and I ask, are you willing?
The Highwayman, as you call him, saved our lives, in spite of what you may have heard from the watchmen who were... obviously confused about the event.<eos> There's quite a bit of that going around, actually.<eos> Jeremiah!<eos> Mr. Flack, your hammer.<eos> Did you say Jeremiah Flack?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Actually, he's right...<eos> Now, that's odd.<eos> He was just right there.<eos> Would you like me to find him for you?
These are dangerous times.<eos> And I do not want your life jeopardized.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> I wanted to thank you for intervening that night.<eos> And for warning me.<eos> We're all very grateful for your efforts to stand between the innocent people and those who wish to commit violence against them.<eos> Do you include your uncle in that statement?<eos> So you said he was the cause of what happened.<eos> I've not wanted to believe you.
Of course, I believe in forgiveness.<eos> It helps if... that man is willing... to set aside his deception.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> - Charlotte.<eos> You knew a man once... who was charged with many crimes he did not commit.<eos> And the crimes he did commit... are a heavy burden upon him still.<eos> - Will...<eos> - He had much to repay.<eos> I lied to you.
- No. - Then follow my lead.<eos> You look lovely this evening.<eos> Making it difficult for me to keep my eyes on General Washington.<eos> Why are you watching General Washington?<eos> My uncle wouldn't dare do anything to harm the General.<eos> Not in front of so many witnesses.<eos> Are you so certain?<eos> He has used bombs before.<eos> I may need to call upon you to corroborate me before the night is over.<eos> William, I need to know that I can trust you.
No more.<eos> He's here.<eos> And he's wearing the jacket.<eos> Might I bother you to spend...<eos> I must go.<eos> - He attacked the General.<eos> - What's this, then?<eos> - You're in danger, sir.<eos> - I saw it all, General.<eos> - This man came at you with that knife.
But I was at fault to put all my trust in that Parliamentary Report.<eos> - Now it's gone.<eos> - I don't understand what's happening.<eos> You told me you had evidence.<eos> Why... why did you wait?<eos> Could you have stopped the killing in Philadelphia?<eos> I waited because of you.<eos> - I did it all for you.<eos> - For me?<eos> I've been trying to become the man that is... somehow worthy of you.
And where does that electricity finally terminate?<eos> Barrels of gunpowder, strategically placed.<eos> We've discovered a practical use for electricity.<eos> How many people do you intend to kill?<eos> Oh, how many people do you believe would die if there is an extended war between England and the colonies?<eos> How many?<eos> How many people will die?<eos> Enough!<eos> So that their desire for independence is overwhelmed by their need for law and order.<eos> Provided by you.
Come to think of it, our extradition laws are rather ambiguous.<eos> I hope you know what you are doing.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, it's from Mr. Franklin.<eos> "To the most honorable William Reynolds.<eos> "You have rendered a great service to our country,<eos> "for that I am grateful, as others would be if they knew.<eos> "But they must never know.<eos> "The true battle is only just beginning.<eos> We may have need for you again.
Had to drive all the way back, drop Ted off.<eos> Sobbed the whole way home.<eos> I'll make sure to double-check my trunk before I leave.<eos> Boy can't help it.<eos> What would make my life a lot easier... is if you kept some distance.<eos> Lot of responsibility running a motel.<eos> Must be hard to find the time to be a dad.<eos> Boy's growing like a weed.<eos> Won't be long before he's bigger than me.<eos> I'll call the garage for you.
Could do this number with my eyes closed.<eos> Why can't she?<eos> The auditions are canceled.<eos> Scram.<eos> Mr. Rix.<eos> Disappear, or I'll call security.<eos> You're the best director in the business.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Must be difficult.<eos> People expect so much from you.
Edna with the spaghetti and Adderstone.<eos> And then it sort of started going wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> We best get back to the orphanage.<eos> I hypnotized the director to pick me<eos> And all the audience.<eos> All of the audience?<eos> But that's amazing, Molly!<eos> You were on television all over the world.<eos> Miss Moon, this letter has just arrived for you.
You're very welcome.<eos> Oh, and Molly?<eos> It wasn't the hypnotism that made you special.<eos> It was you.<eos> MOLLY: There was one more thing to sort out.<eos> Mrs. Trinklebury.<eos> Hmm?<eos> We need to ask you something.<eos> We love you,<eos> And we need you here.
Danica thinks it's unladylike to toss things in the toilet.<eos> And I happen to agree.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, why don't you have Danica do your plumbing then?<eos> Danica can direct her power anywhere Danica chooses.<eos> That is the power of Danica.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If this problem gets any worse we're gonna have to move you into a different room.<eos> That means no TV.<eos> That could be very scary for you.
She's talking to herself.<eos> It's strange.<eos> Honey, you should go to bed.<eos> If it was all one continuous loop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi, I'm Touissant.<eos> Touissant?<eos> Who's this guy?<eos> It's not for me.<eos> Is it for you?
There's more room in the basement for me now.<eos> And another thing, Rudy.<eos> Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting with you and Trudy at your office to discuss her investing in the manufacturing of my new idea.<eos> No.<eos> I'm still getting to know her and falling in love.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't do that.<eos> And what manufacturing idea?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I have always been there for you, no matter what.
Sir, please!<eos> -You cannot sell on Kmart property!<eos> -I made those mops myself.<eos> -I paid for them.<eos> Please.<eos> -It took a lot of work.<eos> I won't come back, but you don't have to take my stuff!<eos> Please!<eos> -Are you even allowed to do this?<eos> -How embarrassing for you to be seen here like this with your daughter.
You can pay more.<eos> I can't pay more.<eos> I won't.<eos> Costs are higher.<eos> Wear and tear on the molds.<eos> We have to remake them every other week.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Can I see the molds?<eos> They're in the machines.<eos> It'll take some time to prepare them for you.
I like this, it's a very good design.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can you stay an extra day, meet with our designers?<eos> No, because of your boss?<eos> What hotel are you staying in right now?<eos> -The Holiday Inn, ma'am.<eos> -Holiday Inn.<eos> Let's move them over to the Radisson, get them a suite.<eos> You'll be more comfortable with your baby.<eos> I'll call your boss and get it taken care of, give you an extra day so that tomorrow you can come in, meet with the designers.
It's going to happen.<eos> She's finally going to notice me for doing something great.<eos> Charlie Brown.<eos> I hate to admit it, you blockhead... but public opinion leads me to believe, that after all these years... I may have been wrong about you.<eos> This is not easy for me!<eos> My whole world has turned upside-down!<eos> Can I please have Charlie Brown come to the stage?<eos> It is my pleasure to present to you today, this award for the highest achievement in this year's standardized testing.<eos> But before I do, the school proclamation.<eos> "On this day, whereas you have upheld the highest of academic standards. "And whereas no one would have ever expected that of you." "And whereas you are the first to ever receive a perfect score."
Fall in!<eos> Fall in!<eos> Battalion, fall in!<eos> Order!<eos> Arms!<eos> Eyes front!<eos> Battalion of cadets,<eos> Virginia Military Institute!<eos> Forward, march!<eos> Why is the answer no insufficient for you?
Order!<eos> Arms!<eos> Eyes front!<eos> Battalion of cadets,<eos> Virginia Military Institute!<eos> Forward, march!<eos> Why is the answer no insufficient for you?<eos> General, with all respect--<eos> There is no respect, not in your face, your voice, your words!<eos> There is no respect in you.
Lookie here.<eos> My day is made.<eos> I didn't even finish breakfast and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.<eos> Injun?<eos> Nah.<eos> I just dress like this so's I don't get scalped out on the prairie.<eos> Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.<eos> Yeah, you can't be too safe out there... with all of them savages runnin' around.<eos> So, what can I do you for?
The prisoner will now be permitted to address his peers before our master passes judgment.<eos> What has just been said of me is true.<eos> I offer no argument nor dispute the simple facts.<eos> But they hardly begin to cover the scope of my true crimes.<eos> Honor requires more than admission, so I offer a full confession and the whole truth.<eos> For far too long, I failed to recognize my own hypocrisy.<eos> I ignored my own cowardice, conveniently hiding behind a position of political compromise.<eos> And for what?<eos> To retain the meager wealth and rank that men desire.<eos> So I come before you a condemned man for having finally stood up to injustice.
As I ascend to the apex of my ambitions, he sinks further into the abyss.<eos> In recognizing that symmetry, if you were him, could you allow such a personal disgrace and affront to go unanswered?<eos> No.<eos> So I've come to realize that we're dealing with someone of such profound internal damage that he has simply not been pushed far enough.<eos> Find me Lord Bartok's family.<eos> Do you take issue with anything asked of you?<eos> Not at all.<eos> And for this price, there's not much I would take issue with.<eos> Commander.<eos> I have a surprise for you tonight.
It's instinct.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Careful.<eos> Are you sure you're able to...<eos> Please continue.<eos> What's your predilection, mister?<eos> You look like you could use something potent.<eos> Or omnipotent.<eos> My brother makes this.<eos> It's like a tree fell on you.
If we don't find Wallington's stock can your stallion carry both you and Mrs. O'Dwyer?<eos> - I'm carrying her.<eos> - Good.<eos> Nick can ride with me if he has to, this animal's strong.<eos> Mr. O'Dwyer, I need to say this to you and I don't want you to get sore.<eos> We're making a five day journey in three days.<eos> Ridin' long and sleepin' the bare minimum.<eos> We need to take care of these animals and ourselves.<eos> I ain't thinkin' about myself right now.<eos> I know you're not which is why I'm puttin' this to you direct.
There aren't any to question.<eos> What transpired?<eos> Mr. Brooder... just educated two Mexicans... on the meaning of manifest destiny.<eos> They deserve it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are we breakin' camp?<eos> No, you go back to sleep.<eos> I'll wake you when we're...<eos> Unless you want to eat dinner.<eos> Here, we saved some for you.
Yes, sir?<eos> I'm stayin' here.<eos> I intend to finish off the males since they know about Bright Hope.<eos> I want you to... escort the O'Dwyer's home.<eos> Make... sure they get there safe.<eos> Yes.<eos> - How's your leg?<eos> - Help Chicory.<eos> Sheriff...<eos> Anything I can do for you?
Now, listen, tell us why you've agreed to come on our show this morning.<eos> Well, urn, uh, Friday night, uh, Adam Jones at The Langham opened up, and it wasn't...<eos> Let's just say it wasn't perfect, and...<eos> - I like things to be perfect,<eos> - Is that man who makes you cry?<eos> So we are offering free dinners before we reopen next week.<eos> Wow, well, that's a big deal.<eos> - All week.<eos> In that case, but why... - Mm-hm.<eos> I think I'm gonna cook for you today, too, right?
- Hang in there, OK?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I'm kind of embarrassed about how I handled the situation.<eos> I'm just so frustrated with not having any control, and I think that what I was trying to do is regain some of the control over the situation.<eos> Obviously, that didn't really work out so well, so... it just kind of sucks right now because I feel like everything's falling apart slowly.<eos> My friends turned on me.<eos> I have no one to talk to...<eos> I mean, besides you. I mean, kind of...
Tromp?<eos> Mr.De Ruyter?<eos> This way, please.<eos> Mr.De Ruyter, I've heard so many good things about you.<eos> Really?<eos> You're the man to lead our fleet.<eos> You mean with Cornelis Tromp?<eos> No, under me.<eos> And not under Tromp? No.<eos> I want you, only you.
What if Charles breaks his word?<eos> We are on good terms with England.<eos> Right Honorable member Kievit...<eos> I hope you're not suffering from sleepless nights?<eos> I'd sleep better if the Prince were king.<eos> Only then we know for sure that Charles won't betray us.<eos> You're responsible for the civil war in this country.<eos> You, Mr.De Witt.<eos> Damn you.<eos> My French king, has an army ready for you.
Back to shore, straight away.<eos> Hoist the sails.<eos> We have to get his brother here as well.<eos> Say that this comes from Cornelis.<eos> I don't know if I...<eos> We're going to be in power soon.<eos> We need to know who is with us and who is not.<eos> There must be some kind of procedure.<eos> That depends on...<eos> A message for you.
The great hero from the Battle of Texel:<eos> Cornelis Tromp.<eos> They don't know what they're doing.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> Retirement?<eos> Back to Zeeland?<eos> What will the Netherlands do without you?
You want them to like you'?<eos> Like me'?<eos> I want to fuckin' kill them.<eos> He's fucking laughing at us, 127.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The public are gonna string us up for this, you realize.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Right. I'm replacing you as lead.<eos> What'?<eos> And you, 529.
I thought I'd been careful.<eos> And one day, of course, the inevitable happens, and here we are.<eos> Total fucking disaster.<eos> I kept meaning to tell you.<eos> You kept fucking meaning to tell me, did you'?<eos> You kept meaning to tell me'?<eos> This is shite!<eos> Absolute fucking shite!<eos> You don't give a fuck about anything, dae you'?<eos> It's all a fucking laugh to you.
And I desperately need your help.<eos> My help with what?<eos> Miss Cushing, the language, for one thing.<eos> As you can plainly see, I do not speak a word of American.<eos> Tell me, why would you want to stay here?<eos> All alone.<eos> Alan, this is Sir Thomas Sharpe.<eos> Sir Thomas, Dr. Alan McMichael.<eos> Best man in town if you're feeling poorly.<eos> I've heard so much about you from Mother and my sister.
The lady takes her place slightly to the left of the leading gentleman.<eos> Six basic steps, and that's all.<eos> However, it is said that the true test of the perfect waltz is for it to be so swift, so delicate and so smooth that a candle flame will not be extinguished in the hand of the lead dancer.<eos> Now, that requires the perfect partner.<eos> Would you be mine?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I'm sure Eunice would be delighted.<eos> I dare say.<eos> But I have asked you.
Everybody's waiting.<eos> I'll be there shortly.<eos> Miss Cushing.<eos> Edith. I really have no right to ask this, but...<eos> Sir Thomas.<eos> May I speak with you in my study, please?<eos> You and your sister, if you would be so kind as to fetch her.<eos> Child, please tell our guests that we will join them presently.<eos> Now, Lady Lucille.<eos> Sir Thomas, the first time we met I imagine it was hard for you to realize that I didn't like you.
Could you speak plainly, Mr. Cushing?<eos> Plain I will be, missy.<eos> Plainer than you might like to hear.<eos> In the past few days your brother has deemed it fine enough to mix business with pleasure by repeatedly engaging socially with my daughter.<eos> My only daughter.<eos> Sir, I'm aware that I have no position to offer, but the fact is...<eos> You are falling in love with her.<eos> Is that it?<eos> You play the part well.<eos> The other day, my daughter asked me why I didn't like you.
No.<eos> Miss?<eos> What is it, Annie?<eos> Your manuscript was delivered this morning by Sir Thomas Sharpe, but I didn't want to wake you early.<eos> It's all the same, Annie.<eos> Thank you. Just leave it there.<eos> The letter, too?<eos> Yes, the letter, too.<eos> Dear Edith. By the time you read this, I will be gone.<eos> Your father made evident to me that in my present economic condition I was not in a position to provide for you.
Thomas?<eos> Thomas!<eos> They checked out this morning, miss.<eos> In time for the early train.<eos> Are you all right, miss?<eos> Edith.<eos> Lucille has gone.<eos> Your father bribed me to leave.<eos> I cannot leave you, Edith.<eos> In fact, I find myself thinking of you even at the most inopportune moments of the day.
Don't touch him like that!<eos> That's my father!<eos> Forgive me, I was...<eos> He's turning 60 next week.<eos> He's afraid of looking his age, you see.<eos> That's why he dresses so well.<eos> Why he likes taking long walks.<eos> His hand feels cold.<eos> Why is it so cold?<eos> I'm here for you now.
Once she signs the final papers, I want this over with.<eos> This is a valve controller I had fabricated in Glasgow.<eos> This could make all the difference.<eos> Think lucky thoughts, Edith.<eos> The Sharpe mines might reopen if this thing cooperates.<eos> Mr. Sharpe?<eos> Ah, excellent.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're Lady Sharpe, then?<eos> Forgive me, mum, but there's a few letters for you.
You're probably wondering why I requested this meeting.<eos> I presume it's to tell me my services are no longer required.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Well, I've loved buying fabrics and textiles for you.<eos> I'd have been doing it anyway. But we know it was a test run, to see if there was any demand.<eos> And after three months we were either going professional or giving the whole thing up.<eos> - We're going professional.<eos> - Oh, I'm delighted.<eos> And please tell whoever it is that I'm around to impart what little wisdom I...<eos> Evelyn, we want to employ you.
- Oh, I'm delighted.<eos> And please tell whoever it is that I'm around to impart what little wisdom I...<eos> Evelyn, we want to employ you.<eos> We want to go professional with you.<eos> You have contacts.<eos> You have taste. You can haggle the hind legs off a donkey.<eos> We would like you to be in charge of sourcing for our whole operation in this country.<eos> - I'm 79 years old.<eos> - We don't mind if you don't.<eos> We'll give you a team to work under you, of course.
But luckily everything can be saved by a device called a gudgeon pin remover.<eos> - We just popped out for some of those pancakes.<eos> - I don't suppose you'd care to join...<eos> Good Lord.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Nothing I haven't done before.<eos> Something must have gone wrong with his steering.<eos> It almost looked as if he was aiming straight at you.
Madam, this perfect specimen and I were planning to spend the day alone together.<eos> - I didn't mean to intrude.<eos> - Of course she can come.<eos> Of course you can come.<eos> It's difficult.<eos> Every morning I take a taxi to the roundabout and I have a decision.<eos> I can either go left to Nimish or right to Abhilash.<eos> Both of whom love me.<eos> I'm pretty sure they're going to propose soon enough.<eos> Just because I'm looking at you when you talk, don't think I'm interested or listening.
That's really the point, isn't it?<eos> For all relationships, the journey.<eos> It's not enough to stand still.<eos> There's gotta be progress.<eos> Movement towards something.<eos> Because the really frustrating thing is, we could be madly happy.<eos> And not to take the risk, when it's so close you could almost reach out and touch it.<eos> The great and terrible thing about life there's just so much bloody potential.<eos> All of which is almost certainly nonsense and I've no idea what I'm talking about.<eos> Tell me about you, Norman.
- You know what that is?<eos> - Mm-mm. A big-ass black man on your pale white ass.<eos> "No!<eos> I don't want any more!<eos> Stop!<eos> That's enough."<eos> Too late. He done tagged the next guy in.<eos> That's like a rabbit.<eos> You don't want him no more so now here comes the guy that wants to rub your face.<eos> "I like his hair." He's breathing on you.
You're my Potato Chip, You and nobody else, okay?<eos> I love you so much.<eos> - Okay okay...<eos> - He'll be back, sweetheart.<eos> I love you, Katie!<eos> Dad!<eos> Go ahead. Please drive.<eos> 7 Months Later.<eos> NURSE: Jake, it's time.<eos> DOCTOR: I'm proud of you, Jake.
By a loving stable family in Queens. They have two other children, it's a perfect fit.<eos> Queens?<eos> Takes over an hour's subway to get here.<eos> You can't see her anymore.<eos> What?<eos> She'll continue therapy with a social worker who helps integrate her into her new community.<eos> She needs a clean break from us.<eos> You've done great work with her.<eos> Honey, we're all very proud.<eos> But, she can't start her new life holding on to you.
You are nothing but a failed genetic experiment, a motherless..!<eos> Damn you, Tuvok!<eos> I could have eaten two meals tomorrow with my winnings.<eos> We have urgent matters to discuss.<eos> We have nothing to discuss, your Section 31 hung me out to dry.<eos> Their methods left much to be desired<eos> I have always believed you to be innocent.<eos> That save me from any beatings or helped me avoid the rape gangs?<eos> Something big's coming down, you're desperate, why else would you be here?<eos> I need you back on the Icarus.
Am I on Celebrity Subpoena?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Tell me, am I on Celebrity Subpoena?<eos> And hello, sir.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Fuck it, wrong house.<eos> -Stop.<eos> Does Adam Yates live here?<eos> I'm Adam Yates Stedmeyer.<eos> Okay, so you're married to my aunt, which makes you my uncle.
-Strut, strut, strut...<eos> Wow, they're really good at your dance.<eos> Your poor man's Macarena that you are very famous for.<eos> Everybody do the...<eos> They're, like, picking dicks out of a tree.<eos> It looks like dick-picking.<eos> And for the record, I still like your music.<eos> I mean, I know you've fallen on hard times.<eos> Hard times?<eos> You're so poor now, but I really like you still.
An assassin.<eos> An assassin, okay.<eos> And you're here to kill who, exactly?<eos> You have a girl here.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Do you love your family?<eos> My family?<eos> Yes, your wife... two small children.<eos> You love them?<eos> We're not talking about me, we're talking about you.
May I?<eos> Sure.<eos> Can I have some approval now?<eos> All right. This is the code for our RAT.<eos> See, it's compact. It's slick.<eos> Under a meg.<eos> You would never have picked up on it.<eos> Ever leave that USB drive on your desk?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Who works here who doesn't like you?
It's 20%.<eos> You call it whatever you want.<eos> I meet my partners.<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> And like I told your bagman, I don't want to meet.<eos> I don't give a fuck about what you want.<eos> It's what I want when I make a deal, face-to-face.<eos> Because I can put together another bankroll.<eos> Target another target.<eos> And if I stop thinking about you, if I stop thinking about anything, it disappears.
Well, I don't.<eos> And like I told your bagman, I don't want to meet.<eos> I don't give a fuck about what you want.<eos> It's what I want when I make a deal, face-to-face.<eos> Because I can put together another bankroll.<eos> Target another target.<eos> And if I stop thinking about you, if I stop thinking about anything, it disappears.<eos> It vanishes.<eos> It ceases to exist.<eos> But you...

And two gunmen with them.<eos> And the two guys with you?<eos> Lose them.<eos> I'm changing the location.<eos> You and Kassar, Papua Square.<eos> Walk west.<eos> Meet me in two hours.<eos> It'll be packed.<eos> How am I supposed to find you?<eos> I find you.
Merc pricks.<eos> Fucking mercs, I told you.<eos> - Did you get it?<eos> - Went to shit.<eos> Some civvy was there, botched the whole thing.<eos> What about Dallas?<eos> Shit.<eos> Sir! Got to talk to you.<eos> Sergeant Maddox.<eos> Consider your rate doubled for you and your men.
- More than you wanna know.<eos> - Oh, fuck. Brody!<eos> After surviving a near death experience only one year ago, actor, Brody Walker, is bouncing back with his new blockbuster, Gridlocked, which is set to take the weekend box office by storm.<eos> Walker is currently on a press tour and has been garnering praise for his portrayal of a rookie cop, a role he is expected to reprise in an already greenlit sequel to the film.<eos> Ben has the exclusive interview.<eos> Brody Walker, how you been, man?<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Nice to see you too, Ben. I'm doing well, thank you for asking.<eos> I've got to ask you. It was about a year ago that you found yourself in quite a bit of trouble.<eos> A few run-ins with the law, a number of rumors about you.
It was dark. And...<eos> But, you know, I'm feeling better now and Brody's back.<eos> So no more troubles with the law?<eos> No.<eos> No more violence?<eos> No more drugs?<eos> - Nobody's perfect, Ben.<eos> - Right. Okay, so you're going through this rough patch and then all of a sudden you find yourself in the middle of... I guess we got to call it a surreal experience.<eos> Walk me through that.<eos> What was that like for you?
- How'd you get that?<eos> From your car.<eos> You asked me to get it for you.<eos> Oh, you...<eos> You pulled me out?<eos> No, my friend Luke pulled you out, but you asked me to go back and get this box.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Very much.<eos> He seems to like you, which is a first for him.
I'm done.<eos> Is that what Ruth would want?<eos> How do you know about Ruth?<eos> Did you read my letters?<eos> What do you care?<eos> You're done.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> She was a beautiful woman.<eos> In every way.<eos> I can see why they were so precious to you.
He passed away late last night.<eos> Ms. Danko?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Levinson's art collection is being auctioned off next week.<eos> This is a private auction, and is by invitation only.<eos> And Ira asked if you would attend.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I know this is short notice.<eos> But it's important to know... he was very fond of you.
- Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> - Let me... Yeah, yeah.<eos> - You're so sweet.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You dropped your chips.<eos> - Oh, my chips.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We finally meet after all this time.<eos> Hi.<eos> I have heard so much about you.
Cambodian-americans.<eos> Okay. Mr. Visser retains this very well-known and very highly-paid drug lawyer.<eos> Mm.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Oh, he's right about the egg.<eos> That is magnificent.<eos> I'm gonna insist that you pay.<eos> Won't be needing this.<eos> My lawyer will be in touch with you.<eos> Trust you?
All we have in this unit is each other.<eos> Unit of losers.<eos> John Almond is a burnt-out Jesus freak who's totally lost his street smarts.<eos> Almond's a pastor on the weekends. - It's true.<eos> - Wait. - Almond is a pastor?<eos> - On the weekends!<eos> He still has the highest conviction rate of any detective in the history of this bureau.<eos> All the forensics geeks hate Niedermayer so much they pushed him onto the sunshine division.<eos> Yeah, they hate him because they hate being corrected by a liaison, and he corrects them because he's better at their jobs than they are.<eos> And we already talked about you, horny little minx.
And I got black balls, son.<eos> Not any kind of handicap.<eos> Portland's got more strippers per capita than Bangkok.<eos> Half of them got to be named Cassandra.<eos> I personally know three strippers named Cassandra.<eos> We used to use them as ring girls for our mixed martial arts bouts.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I ordered deep-fried chicken balls.<eos> Niedermayer says to babysit you.
Why?<eos> The card matches the sticker on our victim's computer.<eos> Dude.<eos> I'm a stripper.<eos> Why? Sexual and/or emotional abuse which undermines your self-worth and reinforces your conviction that the only thing you have to offer this world is your sexuality.<eos> No, strippers strip 'cause they hate men and they get off on controlling them.<eos> When Toby first asked me out, I said no like 100 times.<eos> College boys.<eos> All they want is bragging rights, bagging a stripper.<eos> Not Toby. He didn't brag about you to anyone.

Don't move!<eos> You're bleeding like it's an olympic sport!<eos> Lieutenant! What are you doing?<eos> He was moving towards his weapon.<eos> But why did you toss the gun?<eos> It was so far away from him, I thought that... that people would think I shot an unarmed man.<eos> He was gonna kill me.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> The bad guy tagged Gravely in the vest.<eos> He shot you.
And I chose the wrong path.<eos> Like everybody always does.<eos> Catherine Turner, you're under arrest for the homicide of Tobias Percival.<eos> I didn't know Visser would kill Toby.<eos> You brought a gun so that Tobias Percival could blackmail Eugene Visser.<eos> Blackmail is a felony.<eos> Statutory homicide.<eos> Even when it's a white knight blackmailing a drug-dealing murderer.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Now pull that energy back. Slowly pull it back into yourself.<eos> If your stomach hurts, let the energy flow to your stomach. Let it heal you.<eos> If you have cancer, hypertension, diabetes or AIDS, let this energy come in and heal you. Until you feel better.<eos> Once you feel better, gather the energy to the back of your neck.<eos> Let it collect there.<eos> Once it's gathered then...<eos> I'm a volunteer...<eos> I heard that you had no relatives.<eos> I know...<eos> I could hear you in my sleep.
This cream is certified by Chulalongkorn University.<eos> I'm not making it up.<eos> And now, what you've been waiting for. You get to try this special cream.<eos> My assistants will hand out samples.<eos> Please come up here.<eos> Numbers 1 to 10.<eos> Numbers 11 to 30.<eos> If you didn't register, don't worry.<eos> There's enough for everyone.<eos> Give me your hand. I'll apply it for you.
If it's got a microphone or a lens, God's Eye can find you.<eos> So you invited me here to show me a tracking device.<eos> On steroids.<eos> Lots of them.<eos> Let me put it to you this way.<eos> It took us nearly a decade to find Osama bin Laden.<eos> With this, we'd have located him anywhere on the planet in a couple of hours.<eos> Now, that's a serious piece of machinery that could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.<eos> But for some very nauseating political reasons, any rescue plans involving any US government forces or entity has been strictly ruled out.<eos> And that's why I need you.

You could do that.<eos> How's that working out for you so far?<eos> You got one friend in the ground, another one in the hospital. And then, of course, there's that little issue of the bomb that destroyed your home.<eos> Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules.<eos> Like it or not, you live in that world now, too.<eos> You wanna know how to kill a shadow?<eos> You just shine a little light on it.<eos> If you get the God's Eye for me, I've already got authorization for you to use it until you get Shaw.<eos> You go from the hunted to the hunter.<eos> And there's no place on Earth Shaw can hide from you.
SOCM medics on standby.<eos> They're already inbound.<eos> Pull over, kid.<eos> Dom, you gotta protect Ramsey.<eos> As long as she's alive, she can lock them out of God's Eye, and they know that.<eos> That means they're not gonna stop coming until they've got her.<eos> And this time, when they come they're gonna come with everything they've got.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You're not.<eos> I'm leaving you.
Anyone else scared?<eos> Not really, I already lived longer than I expected.<eos> Password?<eos> Fart noise.<eos> Did you not see the parentheses?<eos> Bellas, so glad Y'all came, c'mon in.<eos> Standing in front of you, Ladies, happens to be the world's biggest a cappella fan.<eos> - We found you.<eos> - Yes, hello, here I am.<eos> What can we do for you?
Can we get some confirmation?<eos> Is Spirit sure of this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, the young one is right.<eos> She's not that young!<eos> Ten, ten to twelve years younger.<eos> We're contemporaries, okay?<eos> You must seek out this Mamie-Claire.<eos> I'm so annoyed by Spirit.<eos> The path isn't against you.
We're contemporaries, okay?<eos> You must seek out this Mamie-Claire.<eos> I'm so annoyed by Spirit.<eos> The path isn't against you.<eos> It's just the path.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't wanna be petty.<eos> I just wasn't brought up that way.<eos> She's my nemesis, but she does owe me.<eos> This has been heavy on you.
I think that was all forced.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yes, I just...<eos> You're really not doing it?<eos> I thought you guys were really symbiotic.<eos> Wasn't it a web algorithm that got you together?<eos> She seems amazing.<eos> You never even met Stevie.<eos> Through you, I met her!
You brought me a Chipwich?<eos> I can get you another one.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> It was clear that the thing that Meadow wanted most in the world the thing that she wanted to define her to give her a place to put her time and talents, her everything the restaurant, it was clear that it would never happen.<eos> The most surprising thing was that Meadow was actually surprised by it.<eos> She could see the whole world with painful accuracy but couldn't see herself or her fate.<eos> And because I was in love with her I decided I couldn't see it either.<eos> I'm starting a restaurant.<eos> Oh, I'm an attorney.<eos> That's awesome for you.
Beware the Thane of Fife.<eos> Be bloody, bold, and resolute.<eos> Laugh to scorn the power of man, for none of woman born shall harm Macbeth.<eos> Then live, Macduff.<eos> What need I fear of thee?<eos> But yet I'll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate:<eos> Thou shalt not live.<eos> Saw you the Weird Sisters?<eos> No, my Lord.<eos> Came they not by you?
- Where to, boss?<eos> Home.<eos> Loser.<eos> Sir, my report on the school arson case.<eos> Then wait here for them.<eos> sign and I'll follow up.<eos> Not necessary.<eos> L'm handling it.<eos> Don't be silly, it's a small case.<eos> Too small for you, sir.
They're saying at the teahouse you've become a security guard.<eos> That's so insulting.<eos> I bet it's that little bastard's doing.<eos> Have some tea.<eos> I rue the day I made Ah Sang a disciple.<eos> He uses my kungfu to do awful things.<eos> It's disgraceful!<eos> He shames my school!<eos> See - how could I tell you?<eos> Well I'm telling you -
What?<eos> You want to fight me?<eos> So I'm a flunkey -<eos> A flunkey with money is as good as a king.<eos> And you?<eos> A poor teacher, so pure - you have to repair umbrellas to eat.<eos> Does that feel good?<eos> You can't eat purity, can you?<eos> Ask yourself -<eos> Which of your students still remember you?
I'll seal off this whole place.<eos> See what you tell your boss then!<eos> Don't believe me?<eos> Just try me, you bastard!<eos> What'll you do about the school?<eos> Sang's boss has my captain in his pocket.<eos> The two foreign devils are in cahoots.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> The school is doomed.<eos> Fatty, I trust you because you're not like other cops.

I don't ever want to see your face again.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Ip Man.<eos> Finish him off!<eos> Get out.<eos> Want any tea?<eos> Listen, things have quieted down.<eos> I'm not expecting more trouble.<eos> But - the foreign devils can't be trusted.<eos> Ah Sang's boss has it out for you.
Please forgive me.<eos> You captured a god to turn it into a slave.<eos> What you are doing is an affront to our ancestors and to Tengger!<eos> You will pay one day.<eos> And so will this old man!<eos> A'ba.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> You're right.<eos> I offended you and the Mongols.
- I prefer Tilly. Tilly, the only reason these bastards haven't run us McSwineys out of town too is me dad empties their shithouses and I win 'em the footy.<eos> We lose this match, all I've got left is the shit.<eos> Thank you, Teddy.<eos> I know you and Mae have been looking out for Molly.<eos> You leaving?<eos> No. I'm going to change.<eos> Been looking out for me, have you?<eos> Iced VoVo?<eos> No, thank you, Molly.<eos> I remember you.
Beloved by all, missing.<eos> And I know what happened to him.<eos> Tilly, certain accusations have been made, requiring me by law to make a thorough search of this tea chest.<eos> What am I being accused of?<eos> "Chocolat en poudre".<eos> Chocolate milk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ooh, my.<eos> Oh, good Lord!<eos> This isn't how I remember you.
They don't like us here, Teddy.<eos> Me and Molly.<eos> They'll never forgive me for that boy's death.<eos> They never forgave Molly and she didn't do anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They tried to take Barney away just for being different.<eos> People came to the school.<eos> I had to run and get Mum and Dad.<eos> I remember you boys.<eos> I used to watch you from here, you and Reg and Barney, up on top of that silo.
It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I've been a fan of your work.<eos> Effective immediately, all research material is considered the sole intellectual property of Crylonis Pharmaceutical and its subsidiaries.<eos> - Stop. What?<eos> - Hey, that's personal property, man!<eos> I don't understand. We're operating under a grant - from Werner-Goss Biotechnical.<eos> - And as of two hours ago, Crylonis Industries became the principal shareholder in Werner-Goss. - No, you can't do this.<eos> - Pursuant to the grant agreement signed by Frank Walton, "any violation of lACUC Review Board standards shall herein negate all claims of ownership and revert intellectual property rights back to the holding corporation."<eos> Which is, in this case, us.<eos> I'm sure it must be difficult for you, but there's an important lesson to be learned here:
I've grown accustomed to being on my own.<eos> Some say even too accustomed.<eos> Too independent.<eos> Miss!<eos> Miss!<eos> My scarf.<eos> I lost it.<eos> You must be Farmer Oak.<eos> Gabriel, yes.<eos> My aunt's told me about you.
I've never asked anyone before.<eos> No.<eos> I should hope not.<eos> Well...<eos> Perhaps I, erm, I should...<eos> Perhaps I should leave.<eos> Mr. Oak, there are things to consider.<eos> Is someone waiting for you?<eos> No, but that doesn't mean I'll marry you.<eos> Good day to you, then.
I didn't say I wouldn't marry you, either.<eos> I haven't ever really thought about it.<eos> I have 100 acres and 200 sheep.<eos> If I pay off the money, the farm is ours.<eos> You could have a piano in a year or two.<eos> Flowers and birds and a frame for cucumbers.<eos> A baby or two.<eos> Mr. Oak...<eos> Or more.<eos> I will always be there for you.
I will always be there for you.<eos> Mr. Oak, I don't want a husband.<eos> I'd hate to be some man's property.<eos> I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding if I could be one without getting a husband.<eos> That's stupid talk.<eos> You are better off than I, Mr. Oak.<eos> I have an education and nothing more.<eos> You could do much, much better than me.<eos> That's not the reason.<eos> I'm too independent for you.
Perhaps we should leave, miss.<eos> But none of it as good as this lot.<eos> It's good stuff, I'll grant you that.<eos> Well, it's up to you.<eos> If you wanna go elsewhere...<eos> No, no, no...<eos> Farmer Stone?<eos> It's Miss Everdene.<eos> Farmer Everdene's niece.<eos> He talked about you with such great admiration.
But I was too restless to be tied down.<eos> What a luxury, to have a choice.<eos> "Kiss my foot, sir, my face is for mouths of consequence."<eos> It wasn't like that at all.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you love him?<eos> No, but I rather liked him.<eos> Anyway, it's impossible now.<eos> Mr. Boldwood.<eos> I had no intention of shooting you.
No, you're not mistaken, but I should never have sent it.<eos> Forgive me, it was thoughtless to disturb your peace of mind.<eos> So you meant it as a joke?<eos> No.<eos> No, not as a joke.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> It was impetuous.<eos> I see.<eos> Perhaps you think I am too old?<eos> But I will care for you more than anyone your own age.
"Miss Everdene," please.<eos> If Mr. Boldwood did really speak of marriage, I'm not going to tell stories just to please you.<eos> I just said I wanted you to mention to the men that it might not be true I was going to marry him.<eos> I could say that if you wish.<eos> But I could also give you an opinion on what you've done.<eos> I dare say, but I don't want your opinion, Mr. Oak.<eos> I suppose not.<eos> Well, what is your opinion?<eos> That you're greatly to blame for playing pranks on a man like Mr. Boldwood.<eos> Your actions were unworthy of you.

No.<eos> Can I?<eos> Oh, good Lord, no.<eos> One inch to the right or the left, and you kill the ewe for sure.<eos> Not even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.<eos> Well, who, then?<eos> Gabriel!<eos> Gabriel!<eos> Gabriel Oak, wait!<eos> Miss Everdene needs you.
But she will.<eos> Tonight.<eos> I know she will.<eos> And when she does...<eos> I wanted to tell you in advance, Gabriel, because I... I believe I know your secret.<eos> I've seen you together.<eos> The way you speak to her.<eos> And watch her.<eos> And look after her.<eos> And I know her, er, profound affection for you.
You said you'd be alone.<eos> Well, she's alone.<eos> Oh, she has a dog with her.<eos> Dog people usually say they're with their dog.<eos> Well, I appreciate you coming to meet me.<eos> I am...<eos> No names.<eos> What? That's the first rule.<eos> Someone asks me who you are, I have plausible deniability.<eos> Better for me, better for you.
Actually they've got very, very good vodka.<eos> That's great, Dad.<eos> If I were armed, you'd know it by now.<eos> Your father sure is.<eos> He's clean.<eos> Here's the rest of what we owe you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Now if you'll untie him so we can leave and never see you again.<eos> I'm afraid I can't do that.<eos> We're not done with you just yet.
Oh, I know you will.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They have no interest in me.<eos> I sent them on their way.<eos> Amy...<eos> This tattoo will forever bond you to me.<eos> Every time you look in the mirror, you will see me.<eos> You will see us.<eos> I will be with you wherever you go.<eos> You're crazy if you think I'll be bonded to you forever.
I don't even know how I'm going to pay for an attorney.<eos> I don't get paid until Friday!<eos> Josh, I know you can hear me.<eos> Josh!<eos> Josh!<eos> Mr. Harvest, despite all your priors, that include disorderly conduct, drug possession, forgery, identity theft, vandalism, despite all of that, this court has decided not to inflict any more pain on your mother<eos> with any kind of prison time on your person.<eos> However, you will have to submit to drug rehabilitation and professional counselling for a period of 12 months.<eos> But with your mother's busy schedule, and given that you are still a minor in need of supervision, this court cannot take the chance you will fail to meet these requirements.<eos> Your mother has informed me that your father, Jim T. Wallace, is alive and well, and has agreed to look after you for the remainder of your 17th year, and/or until you comply with this court's order, whichever comes later.
Just answer the charges please, General.<eos> Very well.<eos> We started a revolution.<eos> All revolutionaries shoot counter-revolutionaries.<eos> What kind of trial is this?<eos> Who's judging me?<eos> You?<eos> Did the people call you up and ask you to?<eos> Were you voted in?<eos> Were you?
Let's go sit down.<eos> I want to get a good look at you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, did you know the Porters? The family that lived here before.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I know of them.<eos> They left before we...<eos> They were in way over their heads.<eos> Yeah, well, David's wanted to do this his whole life, ever since I've known him, so...<eos> Must be a very exciting time for you and your husband, what with a baby on the way.
How did it go?<eos> It was good.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Is this Jane Porter?<eos> Who is this?<eos> You don't know me, it's Evey Maddox.<eos> I live in your old house in Paso Robles.<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, I-actually opened a letter addressed to you from the library.
You don't know me, it's Evey Maddox.<eos> I live in your old house in Paso Robles.<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, I-actually opened a letter addressed to you from the library.<eos> You opened my mail?<eos> - Yes, I'm so sorry.<eos> I wouldn't normally do this but I saw you checked out all these books on ghosts and the supernatural and<eos> I just wondered whether it had anything to do with your experience here at the house?<eos> Oh please, Ms Porter, I know this sounds completely crazy but I've been seeing things and hearing things and, well, nobody believes me because I'm pregnant.<eos> And then Helena Knolls mentioned you.

Don't take this the wrong way.<eos> You're kind of intense. Intense?<eos> Intense how?<eos> When I said I had to leave early, you pulled your gun out on the table.<eos> No, no.<eos> I was doing a thing like:<eos> "Don't you walk away until I get a second date."<eos> - It was supposed to be funny.<eos> - It really wasn't.<eos> I was just chasing you because you forgot your wallet.
Nobody knows we're here.<eos> She has to be here for your wife.<eos> She ready to go?<eos> I'm not so sure about this Witness Protection anymore.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Ay, perdona.<eos> My wife is a come mierda.<eos> How you say in English?<eos> Shit mouth?<eos> The U.S. Government has you trafficking on tape.
Copy that.<eos> Mrs. Riva?<eos> I am announcing my entrance into your private domicile.<eos> I'm Officer Cooper.<eos> I'm here to escort you to Dallas.<eos> You must of not seen me.<eos> Oh, I saw you.<eos> - Mrs. Riva, I am a police officer.<eos> - Ay, please.<eos> Look at you.
- She's always this judgmental.<eos> He's a criminal.<eos> You kidnapped me. You broke my parole.<eos> What you gonna do, just leave me out here?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> They're looking for two ladies, right?<eos> Well, this is three people.<eos> So why don't you let me drive and you can get in the back.<eos> Look, I can help you. Just let me.<eos> - Why should I trust you?
- Oh, right now? - Shh. Mm.<eos> - All I ever wanted was...<eos> Go on.<eos> I was just saying, all I ever wanted was to be just like him.<eos> So that's why you always act like a little man.<eos> You're pretending to be someone that you're not.<eos> You have to be who you are. Own it.<eos> But I have to be tough to be a cop.<eos> I gotta get my name back.<eos> You can't wait for them to give it to you.
You can rest for a bit... but we have to leave by sunrise...<eos> - to get you to the courthouse. - I know, by 8:00 a.m.<eos> Just in time to get my head blown off.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They charge an arm and a leg for that stuff.<eos> I would think that you would love the minibar.<eos> The things inside must feel so normal in your little hands.<eos> Why don't you go and commandeer some food from your cowboy boyfriend?<eos> I am not going to dignify that statement with a response.<eos> I am, however, responsible for you... so I am gonna go next door to get some food.
I did not underestimate you. I overestimated you.<eos> It turns out you're exactly who I thought you were when I met you.<eos> Shut up and untie this cheap bracelet.<eos> Move it.<eos> Move. - I'm moving.<eos> - Move.<eos> You're gonna need this!<eos> - Gun! I gotta get the gun!<eos> - No, you don't!<eos> - I can't believe I trusted you.
- I knew you would believe me.<eos> - I told you to go home.<eos> No, you're not gonna need your weapon right now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't follow orders, do you?<eos> Well, maybe you will now.<eos> Outside, quickly and quietly.<eos> - I don't believe this.<eos> - Just relax.<eos> I trusted you.
- I told you to go home.<eos> No, you're not gonna need your weapon right now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't follow orders, do you?<eos> Well, maybe you will now.<eos> Outside, quickly and quietly.<eos> - I don't believe this.<eos> - Just relax.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> My father trusted you.
I'm asking you for the last time.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You won't regret this. I promise.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - What?<eos> You made me not kill him so that you get to kill him?<eos> I get to kill him?<eos> I just saved your life!<eos> I have been waiting for six years for this moment... and you come at the last second and ruin it?<eos> I just took a bullet for you!
This is where your guy said he dropped off the little freaks?<eos> Yeah. That'll be 76 bucks.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm law enforcement, so...<eos> Great. 76 bucks.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> I'm the police of the sky.<eos> But we're on the ground and this is a car.<eos> So... 76 bucks.<eos> So, that means nothing to you?
Hurry up, Alvin, come on!<eos> I will...<eos> Whoopsie. ...take a little nap.<eos> So, how much is this gonna cost?<eos> To the nearest bus station, $32.<eos> we're a little short.<eos> How short?<eos> About 32 bucks.<eos> Have a nice night.<eos> Easy for you to say.
Alvin.<eos> Totally forgot about this.<eos> Alvin!<eos> Which way is the pool?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Got some bad news, muchacho.<eos> The chairs are for hotel guests only.<eos> Beat it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got some bad news for you, too, muchacho.
Pre-dic-ta-ble.<eos> Cut!<eos> Sorry, my moustache itches.<eos> His moustache itches!<eos> - Want a prompter for him?<eos> - Let's wait a minute.<eos> Could you go over his line with him?<eos> Action.<eos> Why all this hostility?<eos> It's nothing personal against you.
How dare she look us in the eye!<eos> Look at Rani.<eos> She's better than any son.<eos> The way she takes care of her mother-in-law.<eos> Gulab.<eos> I said I'm in a meeting.<eos> Gulabo?<eos> Is that your name?<eos> Like a Rose?<eos> Does every part of you smell like roses?
You stay out of it.<eos> You know as a child, I loved reading books too.<eos> But my mother said, Girls who read make bad wives.<eos> So, she married me off at 14.<eos> You're trapping me the same way!<eos> And why did you build this wall?<eos> Oh...<eos> You'll see... After your wedding!<eos> Now listen, don't take on a new contract.<eos> I need you at home.

After your wedding!<eos> Now listen, don't take on a new contract.<eos> I need you at home.<eos> No way!<eos> It's my last days of bachelorhood.<eos> I'll call you from the mobile.
And I... Once Gulab's bride gets here... It'll be my turn to lie on a cot...<eos> What you doing Lajjo?<eos> Going for a competition?<eos> No...<eos> I have a delivery tomorrow.<eos> What?<eos> A delivery.<eos> What do you know about "delivery"?<eos> You, with your infertile womb.<eos> Booze has drowned all the love inside you.
Please take her Rani...<eos> Please.<eos> Our precious daughter. Beautiful as a flower.<eos> She doesn't know how much she is loved. Goodbye darling, you leave us with a heavy heart!<eos> The animals and birds will miss you...<eos> Trees and plants will go dry...<eos> You are the center of our Universe... Our precious daughter.<eos> Beautiful as a flower.<eos> Our precious daughter.<eos> God Himself watches over you. Because you are God's favorite too.
The boss sent your share.<eos> He said a big client is coming tomorrow.<eos> OK.<eos> What is it Raju?<eos> ls there someone with you?<eos> You can play detective tomorrow.<eos> Now good night!<eos> Darling...<eos> Sweet dreams...<eos> Sweetest dreams to you too Bijli.
Their husbands come to me of their own free will... And that's my fault?<eos> Gulab goes to a whore...<eos> That whore in the city!<eos> And that's my fault?<eos> And Lajjo!<eos> Your husband stays out drunk all night.<eos> That must be my fault too!<eos> I have corrupted your saintly men!<eos> You didn't have to sell your wedding necklace... To save your child from pimps!<eos> It is easy for you to talk!
Bijlii.<eos> The boss is furious!<eos> You took off without a word.<eos> And you keep refusing clients!<eos> He said he'd fire me... For letting you take the bike.<eos> He said "Gas doesn't come for free!"<eos> Don't spin yarns.<eos> Just tell me who's on my stage?<eos> She's nothing!<eos> Just a filler... While the crowds wait for you.

Remember the lover I told you about?<eos> The one who taught me to dream?<eos> He's the one!<eos> Lajjo...<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Go make your village proud!<eos> You know Raju?<eos> I think he's falling in love with me.<eos> Your Raju?<eos> I've noticed how he looks at you.
Rise and shine!<eos> Who is it?<eos> I need some talcum powder.<eos> The boss wants me for a big client.<eos> You must've been quite hot in your time.<eos> Must have been in demand too!<eos> Goodnight Raju.<eos> What was she doing here?<eos> She's a cheeky bitch!<eos> She's perfect for you.
You have some cheek!<eos> How dare you enter my house?<eos> I will hand you to the police!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Get lost!<eos> Before the village folk beat you to a pulp!<eos> You'll have the TV by the Dussehra festival.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Oh my... Lajjo!<eos> Look at you... Glowing like a new bride.
Behind the well?<eos> Or we can go back to my tent!<eos> Come on!<eos> Isn't this too much for a simple fuck?<eos> You could have just paid my daily rate!<eos> What kind of pimp will you be?<eos> Ranaji!<eos> Save your festival bonus... For some other whores!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I did all this for you!
Janaki!<eos> Come here!<eos> How dare you steal my money!<eos> What money Ma?<eos> Who did you give it to?<eos> That boy?<eos> Who is he?<eos> Don't you run from me!<eos> I'm struggling to pay back the loan for your wedding!<eos> You know I mortgaged the house for you!
Her rate is 1000.<eos> No discount.<eos> Fine.<eos> 800 and not a penny more.<eos> A trip to the moon for 800.<eos> You get to ride the rocket.<eos> Bijli!<eos> Back off!<eos> He wants the new girl!<eos> I'll find someone for you.
To stop the wedding.<eos> He rides for hours to see me.<eos> I never called him... Ever!<eos> I didn't steal the money Ma!<eos> Bijli?<eos> Excellent Bijli...<eos> Good job!<eos> What a comeback!<eos> They'll be back next week.<eos> Paid an advance for you.
I didn't steal the money Ma!<eos> Bijli?<eos> Excellent Bijli...<eos> Good job!<eos> What a comeback!<eos> They'll be back next week.<eos> Paid an advance for you.<eos> Keep your share.<eos> You beat the new girl!<eos> Good for you!
Enough!<eos> You owe me.<eos> I believe a finger would be fair.<eos> Don't you?<eos> No!<eos> Jock!<eos> I wouldn't, mate. I really wouldn't.<eos> Jockie, thank heavens!<eos> Where have you been, man?<eos> Right behind you as always, sir.
Jesus Christ.<eos> Is this how she was found?<eos> - What are you doing? - Oh, no.<eos> To the left a bit. - Like this?<eos> - Sorry, I meant to the right.<eos> Like this?<eos> Like this?<eos> Are you quite finished buggering around?<eos> No.<eos> Because I have a question for you, old bean.
But why does everyone seem to think...<eos> Oh! You pretended to be gentle, but you weren't!<eos> Milton Krampf tells everyone he is getting painting.<eos> You're his dealer, so you have painting!<eos> I am very sorry. I simply don't know.<eos> Dmitri, please to fetch 12-volt high-tension car battery.<eos> I am afraid you are barking up the wrong Englishman, comrade.<eos> Vladimir, please to take Mr. Mortdecai's trousers down.<eos> Perhaps we can work something out.<eos> What if I find it for you?
You go down, get your face seen a bit... then you meet me 'round the back later, we climb up the side of the building, break through the window, grab the painting.<eos> Oh, diabolical.<eos> Let's review it a few more times, shall we?<eos> It's just the old smash-and-grab routine, sir.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> This is just the old smash-and-grab business.<eos> Smash-and-grab.<eos> - Jock?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - I am so very proud of you.
Of course it is.<eos> This is just the old smash-and-grab business.<eos> Smash-and-grab.<eos> - Jock?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - I am so very proud of you.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - And, Jock?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - You know, I've always been fond of you.
- Get on that ladder!<eos> And what, pray tell, might you be doing whilst I'm engaged in thus heroics?<eos> Beast! Beast!<eos> How I long for the rain and indifference of Europe.<eos> - Well done, Jock!<eos> - It's a privilege, sir!<eos> Well then, Mr. Krampf. I suppose since you're here and I'm here, it's time for you and I to talk turkey.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Bad news for you, Strago.
- Yes.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> We are going to enter the Goya into the auction, disguised as our Sheridan.<eos> But it's already at Sedgwick's. It's been authenticated.<eos> We'll make a switch.<eos> But first we must convince our buyers that the Goya's back in play.<eos> They won't take our word for it. They'll want to see it themselves.<eos> Then we'll show it to them.<eos> What the situation requires now is a well-spun rumor.<eos> Sir Graham. A message for you, sir.
Apparently it was a nasty car accident.<eos> Does your wife know that one of the missing agents you're looking for is Kate Hewson?<eos> Why open up old wounds?<eos> Anyway, it's classified.<eos> Well, it seems kind of strange that Hassler would choose you for this one.<eos> What happened between Kate and I, it's over.<eos> Okay? But she was my partner.<eos> And that means something.<eos> You expect me to believe that if you...<eos> A- plus for you.
Stallings.<eos> The other guy that was in the car with me.<eos> I'm afraid he didn't make it.<eos> No.<eos> Was he a close friend of yours?<eos> I need to call my wife.<eos> Oh, I believe the Sheriff's Department got in touch with your emergency contacts after the accident.<eos> Where's my phone and the rest of my things?<eos> Oh, we don't have anything of yours.<eos> But I can certainly put on my Nancy Drew detective hat and check into that for you.
Did something bad happen to them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I hope you find what you're looking for.<eos> Here's the damage.<eos> What's this?<eos> You don't have a phone. You have no ID, no money.<eos> You don't know a soul in town. That's where I live.<eos> If you find yourself in any trouble, you can look me up.<eos> So you believe me, huh?<eos> I always believed you.
Hi.<eos> Checkout's at 11:00.<eos> I'm sorry. I must have, uh... overslept.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What happened to "I'll pay first thing"?<eos> Are the phones working yet?<eos> - Why wouldn't the phones be working?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I couldn't get a dial tone last night, and I've been expecting some calls.<eos> Oh, no one's called for you.
I'm not delusional.<eos> I'm not having hallucinations.<eos> With great respect, you wouldn't know if you were having an hallucination.<eos> I mean, walking around with an epidural hematoma is very, very dangerous.<eos> I'm not having a dissociative breakdown.<eos> You see, it's not me.<eos> It's this town.<eos> It's... it's just a town.<eos> You were in a terrible accident.<eos> We just want to get you better.
You try, and too often it doesn't work.<eos> But you have to continue, and you never give up.<eos> Zafar AI-MuIk<eos> Ahmad Sher Khan.<eos> Paidur Khan and his sons,<eos> abdul Qahar Khan lf somebody said something openly against the Taliban... they would be warned.<eos> Bakht JamaI...<eos> MiaguI Jan Pacha.<eos> Dr. Haider all.<eos> We know about you.
She's getting a Iot of fame and I think it's more of a publicity stunt.<eos> She should have stayed in Swat.<eos> She went to england.<eos> MaIaIa is just name of a character.<eos> It can be anyone.<eos> She's a girl.<eos> She don't know anything.<eos> Her father wrote everything for her.<eos> That's why she's so famous.<eos> L've noticed something about you.
You are your father's son and you're part of him.<eos> But it doesn't mean you have to be him.<eos> I'm gonna call you.<eos> Listen, you want to be in somebody's ring... You don't have to call me.<eos> All right, smile!<eos> How you doing?<eos> This was taken from the 10th round of the first fight, right?<eos> Good call.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> I heard about a third fight between you and Apollo, behind closed doors.
Respect.<eos> Congratulations, Adonis, on a sensational effort.<eos> I just wanna thank my mom.<eos> She's at home.<eos> I love you.<eos> Even though I know she's mad at me for doing this. Hopefully I made her proud.<eos> You almost gave me a heart attack but I'm proud of you.<eos> I got my family right here.<eos> Without them, none of this would've been possible.<eos> Rocky, Apollo Creed's son looks at you and says family.

Mrs Miller-<eos> Oh, my dear-<eos> Glass House Laundry next.<eos> Sheffield Weavers Union please be ready.<eos> Youre straight after.<eos> You cannot deliver your testimony like this.<eos> Deputations will be heard one by one.<eos> Im fine.<eos> No, Mrs Miller, youre not.<eos> Lloyd George will dismiss you and all you say.
You get your aches and your chest cough, crushed fingers.<eos> Leg ulcers, burns, headaches from the gas.<eos> We had one girl last year poisoned.<eos> Cant work again.<eos> Ruined her lungs.<eos> And your pay?<eos> We get thirteen shillings a week, sir.<eos> For a man its nineteen and we work a third more the hours.<eos> Theyre outside most days on deliveries so at least theyre in the fresh air.<eos> What would the vote mean to you, Mrs Watts?
The thought that we might...<eos> That this life... that there is another way of living this life-<eos> Sorry.<eos> My words... Im not...<eos> No..<eos> No...<eos> The finest eloquence is that which gets things done.<eos> Thank you, Mrs Watts.<eos> I believe we have that all down.<eos> We will have a response for you very soon.
Have you got the information I asked for?<eos> Lloyd Georges summer house is not yet completed.<eos> He was complaining about it at dinner just the other night.<eos> Its being built next to the golf course at Walton-on-the-Hill, paid for by the owner of The News of the World.<eos> Invaluable information, thank you.<eos> Edith, come here.<eos> Mrs Watts.<eos> How is your son?<eos> Its his birthday tomorrow.<eos> I am so sorry for you...
I could never do what you do.<eos> Can you imagine me as a spy?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> -Out in the field.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -With a gun!<eos> -What?<eos> "Hi, terrorists. Oh, golly!<eos> "Oh, I shot myself!<eos> "l meant to shoot you, not me!"
De Luca is not going to take you anything.<eos> In case you did not hear me... you are not to make direct contact with any of the targets.<eos> Track and report.<eos> We're setting you up in a surveillance office across the street from De Luca's.<eos> You'll be tapped into the same telecom trunk... and have access to voice and data coming into his office... and that is as sexy as it gets.<eos> One mistake, and we've got a nuclear bomb in the hands of terrorists.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Go see Patrick.<eos> He's got special equipment for you.
You're gonna get one of those!<eos> No, I'm not!<eos> Look at that!<eos> That looks high-tech.<eos> It's like the future.<eos> -Patrick.<eos> -Susan.<eos> Hey, Patrick.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was given specific instructions by Elaine to tailor these gadgets to you.
-l like to play the odds.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Well, good luck.<eos> Here is my phone number.<eos> Memorize it, then burn it.<eos> These people we are dealing with, they like to....<eos> How you say?<eos> Murder entire families.<eos> Do you have something for me?<eos> Do I have something for you?
How you say?<eos> Murder entire families.<eos> Do you have something for me?<eos> Do I have something for you?<eos> Would you like something from me?<eos> Not that.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You're supposed to have an envelope with my gun in it.<eos> I don't have a gun.<eos> I am just aroused from looking at you.
Perfect.<eos> Just in time for a nightcap.<eos> Apparently, there's nothing wrong with it.<eos> I don't want your drink.<eos> Fuck you, Rayna.<eos> Scrumptious.<eos> So, joke's on you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> How long was I out?<eos> You fainted just long enough for us to laugh at you.
Yeah, probably.<eos> But it was not quite like this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> Can't just be because I remind you of some sad Bulgarian clown.<eos> You remind me of my mother.<eos> Really?<eos> You know that you and I are pretty close in age.<eos> You're funny.<eos> It's the Bulgarian clown in you.
"This is what I've got, world.<eos> It's hideous, but it's mine."<eos> This was her.<eos> Oh, wow. Hey, how'd you get that picture of me?<eos> I look amazing.<eos> Hello, doppelgänger.<eos> She was the only person I could ever trust.<eos> Well, here's to your mom.<eos> To my mother.<eos> And to you.

This is like what the Man wants.<eos> Us, you know?<eos> Two smart, pretty brunettes... kind of breaking each other down.<eos> I mean, you look similar to a gal I was in college with.<eos> Things happened.<eos> I think we all dabble. lt's mostly just kind of stuff with hands and--<eos> God, I can't wait to kill you.<eos> That's clean through.<eos> Thanks for your weapon.<eos> It's been inside you, so I don't think it should go inside me--
-Excuse me?<eos> -You're a loud kisser.<eos> And it's gross and unappealing.<eos> You look like some old, toothless woman sucking the jelly out of a donut.<eos> Hey, what's it like sleeping with the man that killed your father?<eos> Nice try, Coop.<eos> She already knows it was Cress.<eos> Okay.<eos> You've probably always been in love with him, haven't you?<eos> Talking in his ear... hoping eventually one day he'll fall in love with you.
Something got fucked up in my eye.<eos> I would've been out a long time ago if it hadn't been for Fine.<eos> So, yeah, I'll do anything it takes to keep him alive.<eos> That's pretty pathetic, right?<eos> Extremely pathetic.<eos> God, you're an asshole.<eos> When this is over, I'm gonna shave that fucking head.<eos> All right, Miss Havisham.<eos> I'll take you up on your offer.<eos> But if you try anything, I mean anything... I'll make your dream come true and send you and your boyfriend to heaven.
You know I just helped kill a terrorist, right?<eos> You ever see Kanye do some shit like that?<eos> He never, never!<eos> Isn't this wonderful?<eos> I was hoping to spend the rest of my life in jail.<eos> Give me some quality time to deal with the fact... that I was sleeping with the man who killed my father.<eos> Anyway. Call my lawyer.<eos> Get the Goyard tote from the hotel.<eos> I need everything on time--<eos> Do you think I still work for you?
I approached my disease the same way that I'd approach a race.<eos> There's an enemy to be defeated.<eos> I recall one time in the hospital, the third cycle of chemo, very weak, making my way down an endless hallway and a nurse comes up to me with a wheelchair.<eos> She said, "Mr Armstrong, would you care to sit down?"<eos> And I said, "Thanks, but no thanks."<eos> "I'm gonna walk."<eos> And I did.<eos> I didn't give up because it's worth it.<eos> Inside us is something more potent, more powerful than any drug on the planet.<eos> It's in me, it's in you, it's in every newborn baby.

She taught me when I had to work at her restaurant.<eos> Gwen Koh.<eos> How wonderful you could join us.<eos> My Amanda has told me so much about you and Jules.
Gwen needed you to perform without misgivings.<eos> So I excluded this memory from the transfer.<eos> She gave away her life with her daughter.<eos> There's nothing inside of you that knows what that meant.<eos> There's nothing left.<eos> Sales are through the roof.<eos> Was I someone else before?<eos> Body donor.<eos> Do you remember my last conversation with Gwen in the holding room?<eos> Can you feel that part of her reaching through you towards her little girl?
Son, what's your name?<eos> I'm Shaun.<eos> Shaun.<eos> Are you sure that you want to volunteer?<eos> No.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Whew. Well, uh, this is gonna be a whole lot easier if we can get a few volunteers.<eos> Easier for who?<eos> You?
I just got back two days ago.<eos> I was on my way to see my family.<eos> I got a 7-month old who doesn't even know who I am.<eos> My wife...<eos> I haven't seen my wife in...<eos> I'm not fucking dying in here.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going home to them.<eos> Don't worry...<eos> I'm not voting for you.
- Yes. What does that mean?<eos> It means that if it comes down to one of us and one of them, we don't vote.<eos> Somebody Would have to sacrifice themselves to save the other. Yeah, right.<eos> And who Would do that?<eos> I Would.<eos> Sure you Would.<eos> I Would.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> I really don't know what I Would do.<eos> Let's hope it doesn't come down to you, then.
Uh, I'm a graduate student.<eos> Uhhuh, in?<eos> - Psychology. -<eos> -Well, that's useful.<eos> How about you? What do you do?<eos> - Fuck off, dickhead.<eos> - What do you do, huh?<eos> You collect your disability checks?<eos> Listen, guy.<eos> If You're trying to get us to not vote for you, You're going about it the wrong way.
We're in!<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, he... he's right.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Okay, that's, uh, that's five.<eos> We just need three more.<eos> Everybody vote for the kid.<eos> We're voting for you.
Sir, speaking of the school... What are we going to do about that?<eos> I need to report to the director of education that there is no school in this village.<eos> We'll go to the town hall tomorrow and tell him about our predicament.<eos> Our government sent a teacher here, that means it will build a school as well. It's as simple as that.<eos> You can't go to the town hall tomorrow.<eos> The bus comes only once every three days.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Sir, it took them 30 years to send you.
Where will I teach the kids?<eos> How will we solve this, director?<eos> Look, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough.<eos> Two days ago, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and his colleagues were executed by the military.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -Be quiet, walls have ears.<eos> Ankara is in chaos.<eos> All hell is breaking loose.<eos> With the grace of God, our glorious military, will bring a new order to our country.<eos> By the way, sir, I have some advice for you.
- Thank you, Mr. Hershfeld.<eos> - You've earned it, both of you.<eos> And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but your appointment with Mr. Lee... that's not with Jimmy Lee by any chance, is it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Why, do you know him?<eos> I'm afraid that I do and, well, quite frankly, he's bad news.<eos> How so?<eos> Well, I've known him for a number of years.<eos> He's washed up as a fighter, but word on the street is that he's been working at a local community center and he's been using the kids as an excuse to make extra money.<eos> I mean, you do what you want, obviously, but if I were you,
- Really?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> And now you're down at the community center coaching kids in karate.<eos> Well, karate, tae kwon do, kung fu, martial arts, yes.<eos> All right, look, the thing that I don't really get... why is an MMA champ like yourself...<eos> Yes. Working down at the community center coaching kids?<eos> - It's temporary.<eos> - It's temporary?<eos> Yes, until I get my next big fight.<eos> So what I heard about you is... is true.
That's very good.<eos> Well, there's a lot more where that came from.<eos> Who knows, maybe we'll be adding sound to our animations one day.<eos> Who's bothering us now?<eos> Well, there is a certain bill collector looking for a Wilt Dinsey... whoever that is.<eos> I'm certain that won't fool anyone, Walt.<eos> Allow me to get the door, sir.<eos> I will scare away the varmint.<eos> Welcome to the House of Sam!<eos> What can I do for you, son?
Now, who is up first?<eos> Go on, get up there. Get up there.<eos> No!<eos> She's just a little shy, that's all.<eos> And what is your name?<eos> William.<eos> Thank you, next.<eos> Ah, I told you to use your girl's voice.<eos> Hi, my name is Tina, I'm so excited to be here.<eos> I prepared a little dance for you.
The problem is we pay you up front... that we don't realize a profit for at least six months.<eos> But whatever that profit is, you keep it.<eos> Press has been good, there are other distributors.<eos> Yeah, let's not yell fire just yet.<eos> Actually, when we took on Alice... I was forced to put in a copyright.<eos> How do you--<eos> We pay you for the originals, it's a sale.<eos> We own the originals.<eos> We make the prints and the negatives, and lease them.<eos> The copyright protects us, not you.
Charles... look, we're very busy here today.<eos> Good, and Walter, look... I've just had a chance to finish review of the last Alice animation.<eos> I must say, I am quite disappointed with you and your team.<eos> Ah, you need a new Alice. The quality is not presentable.<eos> Well, Charles, I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way.<eos> Virginia has worked for us before.<eos> Well, find somebody else.<eos> Look...<eos> Walter, I want to help you.<eos> I'm going to be sending my brother-in-law George to join you and your team.
I do.<eos> I see a man that fights for what he believes in.<eos> So, you're just going to give up?<eos> You weren't there in Kansas, Lil.<eos> It was the worst time in my life, and I came out here a failure.<eos> I don't want that to happen again.<eos> You will never be a failure.<eos> You have too much goodness inside of you... that is why we're all here.<eos> If you give up, you're giving up on all of us.<eos> It must be very tiring for you, working all these long hours.

GOLDSTEIN I am sorry, thank you for stopping by.<eos> Walter!<eos> Charles.<eos> I trust you've had a change of heart?<eos> Do you have the contract?<eos> Now, let's sign it and be done with this.<eos> Do you mind if I take a look at it before I sign?<eos> Hurry up, I have a meeting to get to.<eos> Wait, am I reading this correctly?<eos> You want us to assign all rights of ownership of Disney Studios... to Snappy Comedies and you?
Uh, Private?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh. Sure. Sure.<eos> You look kind of nervous.<eos> Probably your first hostage rescue, huh?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Here. No, I can get that one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow. I ain't never seen any shit like this before, sir.<eos> Good for you.
Salima's passion.<eos> I mean, I'm just a hustler from LA.<eos> You know what's gonna happen to a Pashtun girl... that sings on national TV in this country?<eos> What her family is gonna do, her father?<eos> It's already done.<eos> Just the fact that her coming here, it's done.<eos> Look... And yet, she knows this, and here she stands in front of you just asking for a chance.<eos> Just asking for you to give her a chance.<eos> If the ulema doesn't shut us down, if the ministry of information doesn't throw me in jail, there will be another season, Mr. Lanz.<eos> There is no later for Salima, or for you... or your country.
If you ever tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it.<eos> But I'm gonna cut my fee.<eos> There'll be no Richie 35 on this one.<eos> There'll be Richie 15, and we're still both gonna do great. Because this is golden.<eos> Brian, you don't wanna be the guy... that left the Alamo.<eos> You are a piece of work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My posthumous book...<eos> I wonder what you'll call it.<eos> Chief, this is for you.
Matthew!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Matthew!<eos> Matthew!<eos> Are you gonna fuck me or what?<eos> On it like a bonnet.<eos> On it like a bonnet - alright, fight club, what the hell is going on here?<eos> - I'm a guest!<eos> Unless someone signed you into the building, you are not a guest.
- I really did.<eos> He fucks everything in life up.<eos> I have two beautiful children, both are gonna have ridiculously terrible teeth; so you're getting braces, you're getting braces, you're getting braces!<eos> Hey.<eos> You going to lunch?<eos> Dinner maybe?<eos> How about brunch with my folks, you'll love them.<eos> You're smart, handsome and now have stocks vesting until 2018, you can go get any woman you want.<eos> Really?<eos> But I would still choose you. Why?
- No. No.<eos> It's just a friend.<eos> Well you can still get the phone.<eos> I don't want to get the phone.<eos> It's just a friend. It's no big deal.<eos> - You call has been forwarded to an automatic voice--<eos> Are you one of Matthew's patients?<eos> No.<eos> I went to Columbia.<eos> I'm surprised Matthew hasn't mentioned you.
- They got porters and...<eos> - Have porters.<eos> Finished.<eos> Chemist delivered your things.<eos> Shall I have Roger open the crate?<eos> No.<eos> I'll see to it when I'm finished.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir?<eos> I know Roger's been a help to you.
- Excuse me.<eos> - Yes, miss?<eos> Is the 8:10 the fast service?<eos> The 8.10's the slow one, makes local stops.<eos> And the 9:05?<eos> That's the fast train, goes right on through.<eos> - All aboard!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All aboard.<eos> Honeybees are attracted to you.
- No, merely confirmation of the first.<eos> The second was unavoidable, and all the more damning.<eos> The man at the station.<eos> Everything about him, his clothes, the patches on his trousers, his hands, scarred and burned with acid, announced his profession.<eos> Stonemason.<eos> Money must have been a dire necessity, else you would never have forged your husband's signature.<eos> The money was to pay for the headstones your husband would not allow.<eos> For Grace.<eos> For James.<eos> For you.
He may never wake.<eos> They sent me away till morning.<eos> You didn't even have the decency to tell me what'd happened to him!<eos> I didn't think it would make a difference.<eos> I'm his mother!<eos> I'm his mother...<eos> And you stole him from me!<eos> He's all I had!<eos> And I've lost him now.<eos> Why wasn't it you they did it to?
I should've done whatever it took to save her.<eos> Lie to her, make up a story.<eos> Take her by the hand and hold her as she wept, and said, "Come live with me.<eos> "Let us be alone together."<eos> But I was fearful.<eos> Selfish.<eos> She's the reason...<eos> I came here to my bees, so that I couldn't harm anyone ever again.<eos> I'm leaving you the house.<eos> You and Roger.
My friend John.<eos> My brother Mycroft.<eos> Mrs Hudson.<eos> Masuo Umezaki.<eos> Maya...<eos> Umezaki.<eos> Ann.<eos> And who is that one for?<eos> Me.<eos> You.
Nobody's expecting you to be. You know, the pillar of strength.<eos> You can cry.<eos> You know, why don't we just go on to the next question, would that be ok?<eos> Do you want to put your tissue, maybe under your chair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Good.<eos> So...<eos> When Jack came along... was it different for you then?
Don't get nervous in the service, okay?<eos> We're just gonna look at this boat real quick.<eos> You look nice today.<eos> What?<eos> You look pretty.<eos> And you're not fat.<eos> You know, you have a great body.<eos> I do not.<eos> Come on aboard, take a look around.<eos> I'll wait for you up on the dock.
Come on, get up.<eos> Hey, come on, man, let her go.<eos> She didn't do anything. I'll...<eos> I'll... I'll...<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll what, Mr. Fuller?<eos> Check the purse, find the phone.<eos> Pass code?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because once you know what's on there, I'll be useless to you and you'll just kill me.
It's all under control, sir.<eos> Do I detect some frustration or doubt, Mr. Washington?<eos> How did you...<eos> Does redial ring a bell? You should be you're alone when you give away your best tricks.<eos> So you were there.<eos> Where, may I ask?<eos> This magician doesn't reveal her secrets.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll be a good sport and give you a head start.<eos> If I were you, I'd get out of that hotel cause cops are on the way.
Yeah, except they're not actually yours, are they?<eos> You know, strictly speaking, they belong to a senator.<eos> Because the Senator needs more money.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> They're mine now.<eos> We both know the Senator didn't hire us to steal the diamonds.<eos> He hired us to steal the drive.<eos> So I'm going to go ahead and call Kevin's murder a breach of contract and take the diamonds as compensation.<eos> Hm, I guess you have a point.<eos> But how can I get them to you if, uh, I don't know where you are?
Goddamn, she's still here.<eos> Ready, Jessica?<eos> You're going to look just like me.<eos> Hey, Penny, it's me.<eos> Now, listen, here's the plan.<eos> I have right here in my hand what it is you want.<eos> But if you want it, you're gonna have to come and get it.<eos> Isn't it time we were properly introduced?<eos> You know, face to face?<eos> Is this face to face enough for you?
Here.<eos> Oh, you are a magician, aren't you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Take it.<eos> Uh, no, no, I don't think so.<eos> It's not part of the deal.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You get the drive, I walk away.<eos> No, no.<eos> You know, because, funnily enough, I don't trust you.
Homer's a genius, my man.<eos> Just like Shakespeare, Byron, Zeppelin, Dylan.<eos> Ugh. Poets.<eos> Poets.<eos> Poets.<eos> I'll have him back Sunday afternoon!<eos> Bye, Mom, I love you!<eos> Oh, hey, Noah, come on in.<eos> You know, Kevin already left.<eos> Actually, I, uh, picked something up for you.
Come on.<eos> Why was your door locked, Claire?<eos> Oh, I just had a personal call.<eos> You guys take your seat, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> You know what, give Mrs. Peterson and I a second.<eos> I'm concerned, Claire.<eos> Very concerned.<eos> Your behavior lately has raised a lot of eyebrows.<eos> Mike Avenido reported an incident in the gym with you and Noah Sandborn.
You never get used to it.<eos> Spectral Sightings, I like that.<eos> - That one's mine.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Stop.<eos> You boys fight too much.<eos> It's unnecessary.<eos> It's clear you both need each other.<eos> Maybe we should go into business together?<eos> I thought you said this business was too dangerous for you and you said it could kill you.
Close?<eos> Your number is not in his phone book.<eos> My phone number is... 98721018 1972/10/18 is my birthday.<eos> The number is easy to remember.<eos> We're brothers, my number need not be in his phone book.<eos> Nice number.<eos> Yes.<eos> He gave it to me.<eos> Sir!<eos> Phone call for you.
Well, I just got out of prison.<eos> What about crime?<eos> A story of a gangster, his rise and fall.<eos> I've seen that a few times.<eos> Because it always makes money.<eos> All right, when do I get my goods?<eos> Three days.<eos> A 100-page screenplay in three days?<eos> Are you trying to fuck me?<eos> 'Cause if you fuck me, I will fuck you.
Good God!<eos> Look... Look at you!<eos> Well, I'm certain your father has told you some nasty things about me, but I want to assure you, they're all true.<eos> Is, uh... Is he home?<eos> I'm sorry. I thought you knew.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Joshua.<eos> My dad left something for you.<eos> It's a record.<eos> Money that he owed you and some other people.
Not that you'd ever do it. Not after Buddy named names.<eos> Oh, you didn't know?<eos> Word was he had hired someone he shouldn't have.<eos> So he got subpoenaed.<eos> He had to testify.<eos> Closed session. No press.<eos> Makes it easier.<eos> So, he named you, of course.<eos> Now he's been cleared. Gets to make his movie.<eos> In a way, thanks to you.
No, no.<eos> No, not at all. Not at all.<eos> Otto, would you mind if we had a little chat?<eos> Won't be a second.<eos> I sort of feel like I walked in on my wife. Do you love him?<eos> Oh, it's far more lurid than that.<eos> He's paying me for my services.<eos> So am I.<eos> And you'll get them again, January 2nd, as promised.<eos> I just need you a few days on some of the new scenes.
Well, what he said was,<eos> "You keep up this level of work,<eos> "and I'll see to it that your name is on my movie."<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Those were his exact words.<eos> Be in touch.<eos> Very well.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> You too.
Okay. I still have one more move. Something my dad taught me, actually.<eos> Do you mind if I check the trunk?<eos> It's right here.<eos> Turn the ignition like you're turning it on.<eos> Yeah, it's on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Yes!<eos> Lam very impressed.<eos> I don't know what I would have done without you, so...
It's incredible, really, when you think about it.<eos> All the things that have to occur in sequence, all for two strangers to meet.<eos> You know, you make one different decision, you take a different fork in the road, and then two people just pass each other by.<eos> But yet, here we are.<eos> Is it all chance?<eos> Simple serendipity?<eos> Or is it something more?<eos> Fate? Destiny?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not flirting with you.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you, uh, do you work here?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> Uh, do you possibly have any old newspapers, magazines?<eos> That kinda stuff?<eos> Um I'm sure there are something like that around here.<eos> Well, we have to find the right pile.<eos> I know you.<eos> I, I saw that article about you in the paper.
Cheers.<eos> - Where've you been?<eos> - Just doing stuff. You know.<eos> No.<eos> We need to get going.<eos> Get changed, Chlo.<eos> What's the thing to say?<eos> Good luck?<eos> Mr Miller, Abby Thompson.<eos> Yeah, I remember you.
I dunno, just thought we all would.<eos> Are we going or not?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You shouldn't have come earlier.<eos> - I know. It was stupid.<eos> Yeah, it bloody was.<eos> Don't do that sort of thing.<eos> - People don't know you're here, for good reason.<eos> - I said I was sorry.<eos> It's just I was spooked by those calls and I I needed you.
What are you thinking?<eos> - Yeah, well, it's shit!<eos> - I can solve Sandbrook.<eos> - Claire's the key.<eos> - What if Lee Ashworth comes looking for her?<eos> - That's your plan?<eos> Just stay a bit longer, get to know Claire.<eos> - Have dinner, have some drinks, you can all stay the night.<eos> - , have a sleepover!<eos> She needs someone like you and you're not overloaded for friends.
-the potential he has.<eos> -Get out!<eos> Don't talk to me.<eos> Listen, your son is an intelligent kid.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Before it gets ugly.<eos> Get the...<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> Listen, Lorenzo's gonna be fine.<eos> He's gonna survive you.
I'm talking to a machine here, I guess. But the machine said this was Carol. So, Carol, this is Bill.<eos> I remembered your number, so I thought I'd give you a call.<eos> If you're not busy today, why don't you come down to the clubhouse around 11:00?<eos> I'll be on the patio waiting for you.<eos> If not, hey, no big deal.<eos> End of messages.<eos> - Hi, Carol.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Glad you came.<eos> - Can I get you anything? - Oh... No.
Wow. You've been through a lot together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You think he saw it that way?<eos> Did you ever lose anybody?<eos> A wife or...<eos> My wife left me. Then she died.<eos> Boy, that would piss me off.<eos> Could have been worse.<eos> Could have been me.<eos> I like you a little bit, I think.
We got it.<eos> We got you.<eos> That might be my biggest accomplishment right now.<eos> Come on, you're young. You got a lot more life to...<eos> Screw it up even more?<eos> You got plenty to show for it.<eos> You know that, Lloyd.<eos> I wrote a song.<eos> I want to hear it.<eos> Yeah, someday I'll sing it to you.
Had two good jobs.<eos> What kind of time was he looking at?<eos> 25 years.<eos> Department's on full tactical.<eos> We have got to get this guy back into custody.<eos> Not unless one of ours gets to him first.<eos> I know.<eos> We've set up an emergency task force.<eos> Chief wants you to take lead.<eos> Commander, the press is ready for you.
They found Wilhelm's truck.<eos> He slipped through, John.<eos> Is this you?<eos> You want any help with that?<eos> No.<eos> Anything I can do around here?<eos> Well...<eos> I mean, you could hang that mirror over there, if you want.<eos> You got any nails?<eos> It's right behind you.
Has three kids.<eos> I like kids.<eos> You like having three baby mamas around for the rest of your life?<eos> How crazy does that sound?<eos> [sighs]<eos> That's it?<eos> Ugh, all those guys, and not one of them is dateable?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Steve, This is Jean Worther from Downtown National Bank.<eos> I've got some pretty good news for you.
Check out the number one viral video of the week.<eos> Over half a million hits, and it's only been up one day.<eos> It's from the heart.<eos> It's the kind of honesty we need more of around here.<eos> And he's cute.<eos> [Steve] You a fake, Avedon. Steve?<eos> You're that Leah?<eos> You don't even deserve to be with Leah.<eos> She's smart and funny and can just totally hang.<eos> O-M-G, he's totally talking about you.
I've heard that you get a lot of letters from kids.<eos> -Have you gotten these kind of visits and letters -Sure. -from kids that you don't know?<eos> -Sure Why do you think these kids write you?<eos> Because I am those kids.<eos> What is it about you that they...
-Sure Why do you think these kids write you?<eos> Because I am those kids.<eos> What is it about you that they...<eos> I am a child.<eos> I never grew up.<eos> I never lived in your society.<eos> I never went to school.<eos> I never had a mother and father.<eos> I raised myself up.<eos> What do you think it is about you that makes people want to be a part of whatever it is you're a part of?
I raised myself up.<eos> What do you think it is about you that makes people want to be a part of whatever it is you're a part of?<eos> I'm brand new.<eos> Everything I do is always brand new.<eos> Okay, you get the tickets, I'll get the reservations.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Talk to you soon.<eos> -Lindsay.<eos> Um, did you get the Rodel file? -Yes.<eos> I set it on your desk behind you. -Okay. Thank you.
That's why it's magic.<eos> While you're busy watching the deck in the left hand, the magic was happening in the right.<eos> Not sure if I want you handling my cards, friend.<eos> Will you excuse me for a moment?<eos> Dealer change.<eos> Very nice party, Mr. Pope.<eos> You are a very loved man.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Tao.<eos> Whoever said money can't buy love clearly just didn't have enough.<eos> This place will never be the same without you.
- Hey, hey, time's up. - What if Sydney was sick?<eos> - Nobody's talking to you.<eos> - That's all the time you get.<eos> - No, it's not all the time I get.<eos> - Mr. Pope already answered your question.<eos> I don't accept his fucking answer!<eos> God damn it, get your fuckin' hands off me.<eos> I don't care what you don't accept.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> What about the shit that I've done for you?
In pursuit of at least one armed suspect.<eos> Don't ever put your fucking hands on me again.<eos> Pretty sure shooting a cop is not very good for our situation.<eos> I'm in charge!<eos> - Please describe the bus, over.<eos> - Bus number 657.<eos> I repeat, 657.<eos> - I'm in charge.<eos> - Noted.<eos> I'm gonna make this real fucking simple for you.
Vaughn works there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ask a few questions, check it out.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'll send one of my guys.<eos> Okay?<eos> You just...<eos> You've had a rough one, Bauhaus.<eos> Just... hang at the station.<eos> I'll hit you back when I need you.
Get me out of here!<eos> I got an idea.<eos> All right, detective, here's the deal.<eos> No more games.<eos> You fix the tire, I release all the hostages but one.<eos> Once I get where I'm going, I release the last hostage.<eos> Nobody follows us.<eos> I see someone follow us... choppers, police escort... I kill another fucking hostage.<eos> What do you think, detective?<eos> This gonna work for you?
Beautiful!<eos> So soft and tender.<eos> Sweet smelling.<eos> Now, my dearest heart, now that you have shown me your beautiful finger, show me the rest, show me your face, show me your mouth, your neck, so I can kiss it. Please!<eos> Now courtesy demands that I ask for something that I could freely take, without any pretext.<eos> I'm your king, don't forget!<eos> Your Majesty... my royal lord, since you have deigned to demean yourself, leaving your lofty chambers to come to this lowly pigsty, far be it from me to dispute the will of such a great king.<eos> Therefore...<eos> I am ready and willing to grant your desires.<eos> I only ask of you this one favor.
Now, now...<eos> Come on now.<eos> There we go.<eos> Come on... Come on...<eos> There...<eos> This too will pass.<eos> Everything passes.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Come quick, the king needs you right away.
Look, I'm a government agent.<eos> Yeah, and Mary Poppins is your grandmother.<eos> You're a guy with no I.D., no badge, who just stole that car!<eos> You want to move that gun?<eos> Yeah, gladly.<eos> You just assaulted a federal agent.<eos> No. I just restrained a suspect who was resisting arrest.<eos> Get up on your feet.<eos> You see, I called the Seattle Secret Service Office.<eos> They've never heard of you.
Okay. Are you sitting at the reception desk at the Seattle Office?<eos> I have to go.<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> Are you sitting at the seventh-floor reception desk at the Seattle Office?<eos> Yes. Now I really must go.<eos> There is no seventh-floor reception desk at the Seattle Office.<eos> Who are you?<eos> All set, Mr. Burke.<eos> You give that to me.<eos> Yeah. And I give this to you.
Where's my family?<eos> Where are they?<eos> - Aah! - Where are they?<eos> Why are you so angry?<eos> I thought all you wanted was your family.<eos> Oh, dizzy.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> I don't even know what they see in you.
We just got here.<eos> Ben, go inside the house and lock the door.<eos> Take care of your mother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what I've been doing.<eos> They are important.<eos> It is the manner in which you choose to...<eos> Mr. Burke, is there something I can do for you?<eos> Stay away from my family, okay?<eos> I've done nothing but help you and your family.

Hello, Leonard.<eos> Silas.<eos> I didn't expect to see you here this late.<eos> Have you thought about killing yourself?<eos> No, that's not until stage three.<eos> Why is Nia's interface on?<eos> Have you been snooping again, Silas?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> A month ago, health and safety saw you on Nia's interface after-hours.<eos> I was told to keep an eye on you.
Why is Nia's interface on?<eos> Have you been snooping again, Silas?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> A month ago, health and safety saw you on Nia's interface after-hours.<eos> I was told to keep an eye on you.<eos> Is there something you want to tell me?<eos> As the manager here at Atmos, one of my duties is to maintain the safety and welfare of the team.<eos> Therefore, if I believe that someone on the team is in danger, or involved in an activity that is unsafe, I'd report him, or her, to health and safety.<eos> Unless, of course, the activity were to stop.<eos> Does that make sense to you?

I do not think you are in any position to be setting the rules here.<eos> 25, and they're not my rules.<eos> I stopped training to be an agent because the job always comes first.<eos> And I wanted to be a mother.<eos> I chose for my family to come first.<eos> But Ethan didn't make that choice, did he?<eos> You hurt my family, Kate. I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> Maybe for you.

They're watching.<eos> You got to earn their trust.<eos> All right?<eos> You can do this, or I can.<eos> But if you want to survive in this place, I suggest you give me a little push.<eos> Peter, I'm not gonna do that, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I know you're not.<eos> Man, come on, come on.<eos> - That's why this town needs you. - What? !
- Awfully.<eos> There you go!<eos> We don't have much time so I'll skip the formalities.<eos> But I'm having the thorough cleansing of my intestines.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Right, I was unable to convince the queen.<eos> I relayed your reticence about the songs to her.<eos> I proposed an alternative repertoire. An alternative musician, an alternative evening.<eos> She doesn't want alternatives.<eos> She wants you and only you and only your "Simple Songs". She says it's all that Prince Philip listens to.
Please don't insist.<eos> Personal reasons.<eos> But what are these bloody "personal reasons"?<eos> "Personal" means I am not obliged to answer.<eos> Let's see if we can resolve these personal problems. I mean...<eos> What is it that's wrong?<eos> The soprano.<eos> We'll get a different one then. No problem.<eos> It wouldn't make any difference.<eos> What, even Sumi Jo? She is absolute best. I mean, she's already expressed her enthusiasm at being directed by you!
Yeah!<eos> I wonder too.<eos> Liar!<eos> You know the difference between you and me?<eos> What?<eos> Ultimately I never liked life well enough.<eos> Brenda wanted to play Eva Braun a hundred years ago.<eos> She spent six months working on her role.<eos> I have been studying all the hotel guests for a weeks now.<eos> I've been meticulously observing you, Fred, Lena,... The Russians, the Arabs, the young and the old.
What for?<eos> To pay my respects?<eos> No, I don't work for you any more.<eos> I don't owe you anything.<eos> Drop me here.<eos> Anyone you need to say goodbye to?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> They're ready for us.<eos> We know about Harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
Top left corner.<eos> Identical bird.<eos> Different time stamp, same image.<eos> CCTV's been tampered with.<eos> As you already know.<eos> So let's stop wasting time.<eos> This is about Harry losing Qasim, isn't it?<eos> Before he disappeared, Harry made three encrypted phone calls.<eos> The first two we can't trace.<eos> The third was to you.
Dr Omalu uses different stuff.<eos> Makes less of a mess.<eos> Possible causal relationship between self-medication and early head trauma, leading to narcotics abuse and overdose.<eos> You're not her shrink, Bennet!<eos> If I know how she lived, I know why she died.<eos> And you should be careful, Danny.<eos> One day, I may be rushing through your autopsy.<eos> " Dr Wecht, Dr Omalu is here to see you. "<eos> You know the reason you're not back in Nigeria, don't you?<eos> Yes. Because I remind you of you.
Living women are...<eos> Well, occasionally they're a pain in the ass, but quite often, they're amazing.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just be a little less of an artist.<eos> - Fit in a little more.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's another death row case.<eos> The guy's being railroaded.<eos> $1,000 for you.
Father, I'm working on my MBA.<eos> I'm studying.<eos> My books are all over, everywhere.<eos> She's a nice girl.<eos> She's from Nairobi.<eos> Went to British school.<eos> She wants to work.<eos> We're letting her tidy up around the church.<eos> We're asking you because we know she'll be safe and cared for.<eos> - I feel God in you, Bennet.
That is basically my office, there.<eos> Is that your father?<eos> Yes.<eos> The chief.<eos> Those are my peaches.<eos> They should not be here.<eos> Your room.<eos> Your room.<eos> There is a...<eos> The key, I have it for you.
No...<eos> Need is not weak.<eos> Need is need.<eos> I know where you are.<eos> I was you.<eos> You're in America now.<eos> So, you have to be the best version of yourself.<eos> If you don't know what that is, you pick something and fake it.<eos> So, I will just...<eos> There, for you.
You...<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> Yes.<eos> With you.<eos> To celebrate.<eos> You don't dance, do you?<eos> I had quite a revelation tonight.<eos> This body was made for dancing.<eos> When they say "" dancing machine "," I am what they mean.<eos> I'm very proud of you.
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> CTE.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> We publish.<eos> Dekosky is going to coauthor.<eos> - Dekosky?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Omalu, Dekosky and Cyril Wecht.<eos> Well, I'm very proud of you.
You are good, Prema.<eos> I'm sure you see good in me.<eos> I see all that you are.<eos> I want to marry you.<eos> We can fall in love.<eos> If you want to marry me, I will marry you.<eos> That is good, because I already made the down payment.<eos> I saved all my money and I bought this for you.<eos> Get me Elliot Pellman.<eos> " I have Chris Jones for you. "
Or even better than you?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You think this is about Bennet Omalu?<eos> I'm not here because of you.<eos> I'm here because people are dying.<eos> You are here for redemption.<eos> You are here to use me to cleanse your sins.<eos> You self-righteous bastard.<eos> Do you have any idea what I could have, how much I could have... if I went back to my side of the ball and just kept my mouth shut?<eos> Everything in my world is telling me not to agree with you, except one.
This man has been a public servant for decades.<eos> Cyril.<eos> Have you ever performed any private services on county time?<eos> Have I?<eos> Apparently, we've both hurt the government's feelings.<eos> Are you referring to the death row case where I used my personal time?<eos> We don't want you, Dr Omalu, but we can have you.<eos> - And what does that mean?<eos> - That means they want your testimony.<eos> - Against you?
Whatever takes over for me, they're going to want the CTE information, you know that.<eos> What if they show up here with a warrant?<eos> On suspicion of what?<eos> Science?<eos> Suspicion of bullshit.<eos> We got screwed.<eos> You didn't deserve it.<eos> You know the worst part?<eos> How easy it was.<eos> Cyril, they are not going to make me say one word against you.
" Commissioner Goodell, is there a link between... " " playing professional football and the likelihood... " " of contracting a brain-related injury... "<eos> " such as dementia, Alzheimer's, depression or CTE? "<eos> " We're doing everything we possibly can for our players now. "<eos> " I just asked you a simple question.<eos> What's the answer? "<eos> " It sort of reminds me of the tobacco companies, pre-'90s, " " when they kept saying, "No, there's no link"... "<eos> " between smoking and damage to your health, "<eos> " or ill health effects. "<eos> And they were forced to admit that that was incorrect... " through a spate of litigation in the 1990s. "<eos> " And my question to you is... "
Cui bono, Mr. Fogg.<eos> These men profit nothing from blood.<eos> They profit from cargo.<eos> And they profit most when that cargo is least costly to win.<eos> Those stories you've heard... tools of the trade, self-applied by the pirates themselves, intended to separate us from our cargo by surrender rather than sword.<eos> These are men, Mr. Fogg, not monsters.<eos> If we behave rationally and civilly, so will they.<eos> Down to the well, move! The ship is yours, sir.<eos> Our manifest.<eos> Everything that would be of value to you is accounted for, and its location in the hold.
No, I'm not stupid.<eos> I know how that sounds.<eos> But I am telling you we met at the bar.<eos> We had a few drinks.<eos> And I don't know what happened after that.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> I believe you, Miss Page.
Yes, it's perfect Chechnyans-kidnap- a-preschool weather, Vladimir.<eos> Can you at least pretend to be cold?<eos> It's unsettling.<eos> Anyone here speak Chinese?<eos> Nobu?<eos> The man is Japanese.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I just thought that...<eos> Forget it.<eos> Oh, please tell me he's right behind you.
It's unsettling.<eos> Anyone here speak Chinese?<eos> Nobu?<eos> The man is Japanese.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I just thought that...<eos> Forget it.<eos> Oh, please tell me he's right behind you.<eos> Unfortunately, my employer is attending to other matters.<eos> He apologizes to you in particular, Madame Gao.
- Come in, please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Lucinda is expecting you.<eos> But she's resting now.<eos> - So she'll see you at dinner.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll show you to your room.<eos> Yes, just up here.<eos> There's a bathroom right there to your left.<eos> And there are clean towels in there for you.
Okay!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not bad for a city boy.<eos> Okay.<eos> So heavy.<eos> Hey, Sherwin.<eos> Look at that.<eos> - Did you make it?<eos> - Oh, no, I'm not that nice.<eos> A neighbor heard that we have a special guest, and she made it just for you.
- I'm pretty cold.<eos> I brought a photo to show you.<eos> That's Carl, my husband, holding Fiona.<eos> I was so young when I met him.<eos> You would have liked him.<eos> He was smart, too.<eos> I put my life on hold after Carl.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Fiona hated me for the life I chose.<eos> She certainly wouldn't want it for you.
- None taken.<eos> So I heard your old man's over there in Tucson these days.<eos> - Yeah, he just finished a stint at state.<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> Three squares a day, the way he likes it.<eos> You know, if you need a place to stay, we can fix up that old spare room.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm crashing with some buddies.<eos> You've already given me more than I deserve.<eos> I just wish there was something I could do for you in return.
Tell the truth, Justin.<eos> Don't you dare lie.<eos> Ma'am, if I may...<eos> Now, I was just having a few off-duty beers with my buddy Tyler here when... Wham!<eos> My dog didn't know what hit him.<eos> Got me pretty good too.<eos> Now, that's assault.<eos> I mean, I'm willing to drop all charges if you go ahead and put him down yourselves.<eos> Truth is, he'll be put down regardless.<eos> Max wasn't anywhere near you or your dog.
- Really?<eos> Or we can stop with this nonsense, Sadie.<eos> Sign over all claim to this find to me and I will make sure the university doesn't hear about your little indiscretion.<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> You really want to fight against the university?<eos> We have more money than the Vatican and almost as many lawyers.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> I'll sign your release.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> See how smart an education makes you?
You have a kidney in your body that wasn't there before, Mr. Chamberlain.<eos> So, please don't lie to me.<eos> The last person to come in contact with an object like the one you found... he thought it had healed him, too.<eos> That's where I kept it.<eos> Wasn't long before I noticed it didn't react well to the humidity in here.<eos> Thing had just... melted.<eos> Melted?<eos> Things been tough, Mr. Chamberlain?<eos> Since the death of your wife.<eos> Must have been very hard for you... knowing there was nothing you could do to save her.
Maybe she went skinny-dipping.<eos> Mike, she may be down by the stream.<eos> - Go check it out. - But...<eos> No "but," all right?<eos> Just check it out now.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's just hope this is one big misunderstanding.<eos> Hey, Carl, get down to the stream quick.<eos> All right, ladies, let's go see what Mike has found.<eos> After you, sir.

Jay McInerney called it "something like a sleek Vonnegut chassis... wrapped in layers of post-millennial Zola."<eos> David Foster Wallace, welcome to our show.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm glad to be here. All right.<eos> Now, you have said you saw yourself as, quote,<eos> "a combination of being incredibly shy and being an egomaniac too."<eos> I believe I said "exhibitionist" also.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I think being shy basically means being self-absorbed... to the extent that it makes it difficult to be around other people.<eos> Difficult for you or difficult for the other people? Ah.
He's got to be working for somebody.<eos> Denzel's on the trail of a kidnapper in this one.<eos> I got my own movie to go to.<eos> - Who are these friends?<eos> - You met them before.<eos> - There's some I haven't met.<eos> - And you're never gonna meet those.<eos> They'd call this house day and night when you were in eighth grade. Hi.<eos> Can I please speak to Stephon?<eos> So, what's up with you and that neighbor Ben?
You have fun?<eos> What the fuck do you want, man?<eos> I want to know who did the drive-by on one of your corners.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> Is that all?<eos> I mean, that's why you came all the way down here for?<eos> Nah. Nah, you see?<eos> There's something you ain't telling me.<eos> You know something about who shot Donelle, bitch?<eos> Who's Donelle to you?
So you ask me who's responsible for that shit on the corner... - It's you.<eos> - What are you...<eos> - You motherf...<eos> - You let him run the streets.<eos> - He shouldn't have been there.<eos> - Shoot him.<eos> He got in the way. That shit's gonna happen when you somewhere<eos> - you ain't supposed to be.<eos> - Finish him right now.<eos> So, it's you, it's me, it's... it's my man Handro in Mayfield.
You were so scared.<eos> Hell, yeah, I was scared.<eos> That detective knows.<eos> That man don't know shit.<eos> What you need to be worried about is our man in Mayfield, Alonzo's boss.<eos> - It's time for me and Justin to move away.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> You with the running.<eos> I need to think about Justin, and the girls in the support group will understand.<eos> The girls in the group don't give a fuck about you.
And just tell me who murdered Wil.<eos> Who was it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It had nothing to do with me.<eos> Where were you on the night of the fire?<eos> We were up on the farm... together.<eos> We drank all night.<eos> Put the gun down, Bedwyr, or you'll lose more than just the farm!<eos> I didn't kill Wil!<eos> I believe you.
The insulin and the paan box.<eos> Something's fishy<eos> Why fishy?<eos> Maybe he just went away somewhere<eos> Nothing "just" happens in this world<eos> Look, it's no big deal for me<eos> Two days at the lodge and I'll figure it all out<eos> Your father could be alive and innocent Or dead and guilty<eos> Shall I go?<eos> Find out for you?
When I mentioned the paan box, he left the table<eos> I pushed him around a bit.<eos> Watched his eyes<eos> He gave himself away<eos> Simple<eos> If only I could learn to think like you<eos> Many talkers in this world. Few doers<eos> You look like a doer<eos> If you need help, you can count on me<eos> There's a room in my lodge for you
I didn't know<eos> Finally he apologises<eos> Who does that...<eos> Are you the owner?<eos> I own nothing<eos> Do you know the owner?<eos> Or are you trespassing, too?<eos> You really don't recognise me?<eos> Madam!<eos> Coconuts for you
Let's go.<eos> Hurry<eos> Where is Sikdaar?<eos> I must talk to you<eos> When did you get hold of those letters?<eos> May I see Mr. Sikdaar?<eos> Gajanan can't see anyone right now<eos> No, he'll see me<eos> If it wasn't for me, he'd be rotting in jail<eos> If it wasn't for you none of this would have happened

There's a car waiting<eos> Come with me<eos> Don't think<eos> Ajit<eos> Do middle-class folk like us ever stand up for our country?<eos> No, we go to the movies<eos> Let's go to the Metro<eos> Do it for your country<eos> Why not join Dr. Guha?<eos> He seems to love you
I know what you're doing<eos> What am I doing?<eos> You're playing and my father is your plaything<eos> Sometimes he's a blackmailer. Or sometimes a traitor<eos> And now he's a drug dealer<eos> Your father made the drug and installed the machines at the factory. Why? Ask Dr. Guha<eos> Opium dries up in the market.<eos> Where did it all go?<eos> Add two and two<eos> Is it my fault your father expected more from you?
What do you want me to do?<eos> "Dr. Guha, you asked me to join your war<eos> "Mustering the courage takes time<eos> "Ajit has accepted his father's death<eos> "Ajit is a loyal and brave man.<eos> That's why I send this letter through him<eos> "You've been betrayed.<eos> Your plan is in jeopardy<eos> "Leave the factory now with Sukumar and Ajit<eos> "I'll wait for you at the lodge.
Devil.<eos> To me he's an ordinary cheat<eos> A traitor<eos> A coward<eos> Where is he?<eos> Right here Amongst us Hiding<eos> Betrayal No.2<eos> Anguri Devi<eos> You were betrayed too<eos> The man who made you another's mistress made you lie and murder
The man who made you another's mistress made you lie and murder<eos> The man who promised you'd both leave Calcutta forever<eos> That man is going nowhere.<eos> He's staying right here<eos> Sukumar, have you heard of Yang Guang?<eos> No<eos> Before dying, my uncle... Tried to tell me his name<eos> Anguri Devi, have you heard of Dr. Guha?<eos> Amazing but you both know him very well<eos> The man you met only 4 times in 4 years is running a lodging house 3 miles away from you
Perfect, isn't it?<eos> No, sir<eos> Not so perfect<eos> You stole the Green Gang's opium to make heroin in Sikdaar's factory<eos> But perhaps you forgot to tell Gajanan Sikdaar<eos> Politicians!<eos> Yes, today.<eos> No, tomorrow.<eos> Why risk it?<eos> What happened between you and Bhuvan?
Like tempting a dog with a bone<eos> You dangled Anguri Devi in front of Sikdaar four years ago<eos> You did the same with me<eos> She pretended to hide the letters<eos> Because I told you that I always find what is hidden<eos> After Sikdaar was dead, you sent me the stamp to confuse me<eos> When I saw Watanabe, you appeared as a freedom fighter<eos> So Dr. Guha takes the blame<eos> And Yang Guang is never in the picture<eos> We are tools for you
To live together<eos> Mr. Bakshy<eos> The colour of truth?<eos> Red<eos> No one could sing like her<eos> Should I kill you?<eos> End it here<eos> Too late, Doctor<eos> Mr. Watanabe<eos> That siren is for you
I understand. I tried contacting Officer Ferguson from TSA, but he must have his phone off.<eos> I mean, my hands are tied.<eos> Paul? Can you step up to the plate and save us?<eos> I'm gonna need my dress whites.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Your uniform, as requested, Officer Blart.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I am the general manager of this resort, so I don't take tips.<eos> And I don't normally deliver dry cleaning either, but I just... I wanted to clarify that I was not making advances towards you earlier, nor would I, ever.
See, Vincent, I'm fiercely independent, yet I'm not a big fan of being alone.<eos> I'm a contradiction.<eos> I told you I was crazy.<eos> And I told you that I'm crazy.<eos> You can't out-crazy me.<eos> My crazy will take your crazy, shove it in a metal tube, fill it with rats, then blowtorch it until the rats have no way to escape except eating their way through your crazy.<eos> Wow. You are oblivious to the avalanche of insanity<eos> I am about to unload. You don't know what I will do to you!<eos> You don't know what I'll do to you!<eos> I will spin around until I throw up on you and your friends.
- So?<eos> - You believe in god.<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> There are answers for this in science?<eos> There are answers for everything in science.<eos> But not in god?<eos> God is more our creation than we are his.<eos> So... why end your life?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> If god is not waiting for you on the other side, who is?
I was wrong to treat my wife the way I treated her and she was wrong to treat me how she did.<eos> Now neither one of us are ever gonna get the chance to say I'm sorry.<eos> She's listening.<eos> No she's not.<eos> It is during our darkest times that our loved ones are closest.<eos> Even those who have passed.<eos> Her spirit...<eos> No, it's not.<eos> She's with you.<eos> This forest holds her for you.
Yeah. They shared a correspondence during the war. They was pen pals.<eos> And this is just one of the letters. Get up!<eos> What the...! -Huh!<eos> -O.B.! Stop!<eos> Whoa! Easy. Whoa!<eos> All the stupid<eos> Like to rip my goddamn arm off!<eos> I didn't drag her stinking ass up this goddamn mountain just for you to break her neck on the outskirts of town!<eos> You the one handed her my goddamn letter!<eos> I didn't give it to her I give it to you!
O.B.! Give the major back his iron.<eos> One thing I know for sure this nigger-hating son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.<eos> Now, I'll help you protect your $8,000 you help me protect my ten.<eos> Deal?<eos> Well, ain't love grand?<eos> Y'all want to lie on the ground and make snow angels together?<eos> Hut! Come on!<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.<eos> The name's John.<eos> When we get to Red Rock Hyah! I'll buy you and Major Marquis there dinner and booze. Get in!
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.<eos> I take it you're Daisy Domergue? That's her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, it says here 'Dead or Alive. Yeah.<eos> It does.<eos> Well, transporting a desperate hostile prisoner such as her sounds like hard work.<eos> Wouldn't transporting her be easier if she were dead?<eos> Well, no one said the job was supposed to be easy.<eos> And why is her hanging proper so important to you?
You got a good eye, son.<eos> Well, I'll be double-dog damned!<eos> General Sandy 'Don't Give a Damn' Smithers?<eos> Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix's Marauders.<eos> Erskine's boy?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Uh...may I sit down, sir?<eos> Well, according to the Yankees it's a free country.<eos> General Sandy Smithers.<eos> Boy oh, boy did my daddy talk about you!
Blink if you're calm.<eos> He blink?<eos> He blinked.<eos> Blink if you're gonna remain calm.<eos> He blinked.<eos> Take his pistol.<eos> I'm real sorry about this, son.<eos> Like I said nothing personal, just a precaution.<eos> Pretty sneaky.<eos> (I am) afraid the same applies to you, too Mr... Mobray.
I might let a whore piss on it.<eos> I spit on it.<eos> Good for you, sister!<eos> Warren!<eos> Goddamn it, you leave that old man alone.<eos> Stand down, you son of a bitch.<eos> I shared a battlefield with this man.<eos> Or would you deny me that, too?<eos> I suppose you were there.<eos> May I join you?
Now, when he gets here I'm gonna kill that fella and turn my sister loose.<eos> Now, do you have any reason why you would want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?<eos> No.<eos> You don't?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You sure you don't?<eos> I mean, we did just kill Minnie and Sweet Dave.<eos> Now, you and Sweet Dave looked mighty chummy over here.<eos> I just met these people! I don't give a damn about them!<eos> Or you. Or your sister. Or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming, for that matter.
Oh! That sure was pretty.<eos> Shit!<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I see that Lincoln letter?<eos> "Dear Marquis<eos> I hope this letter finds you in good health and stead.<eos> I'm doing fine although I wish there were more hours in a day.<eos> There's just so much to do.<eos> Times are changing slowly but surely and it's men like you that will make a difference.<eos> Your military success is a credit not only to you but your race as well.
You're one shy. That's $3.<eos> They gave me...<eos> Look, I'm validated for the entire day, okay?<eos> Five stickers, six stickers, I don't know from stickers because I was in that court back there saving people's lives, so...<eos> Gee, that's swell.<eos> And thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system.<eos> Now, you either pay the $3 or you go back inside and you get an additional sticker.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Fine. You win.<eos> Hooray for you.
- Well groomed, as always.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> Keith, Karen.<eos> Yes.<eos> You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin and I won't have it.<eos> - Do you want me to call security?<eos> - It's okay, Brenda. We got it.<eos> - Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate.<eos> Hey, Aaron. - What can we do for you, Jimmy?
That's money for Chuck.<eos> Isn't that what you wanted?<eos> A measly 26 grand?<eos> Jesus, you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians.<eos> Throw in some beads and shells while you're at it.<eos> It's just a start, there'll be more.<eos> Unless you're gonna just tear them all up.<eos> And why was it made out to me? Why not Chuck?<eos> Can he make his way to the bank?<eos> I just assumed it was best to have the money go through you.
We'd like to welcome you.<eos> You're one of the lucky ones.<eos> You have one of our superior rooms, which means you have a view.<eos> - Did you read the leaflet?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now the fact that you'll turn into an animal if you fail to fall in love with someone during your stay here is not something that should upset you, or get you down.<eos> Just think as an animal you'll have a second chance to find a companion.<eos> But even then, you must be careful.<eos> You need to choose a companion that is a similar type of animal to you.

Now, that sounds like a great idea.<eos> Did you like my mom too?<eos> It's just you have so many pictures of her... up in your room.<eos> We don't even have that many at home.<eos> I think that's why you and my daddy keep fighting.<eos> It is, isn't it?<eos> You are a...<eos> A very clever girl.<eos> And when my mom chose my dad... I bet you were pretty sad.<eos> But weren't there other pretty girls for you?
Your father, Col. Usmaan Khan.<eos> How long has it been since you two last talked?<eos> Imagine how happy he'll be to see you in the Indian Army again.<eos> If you do this job, I promise you'll be honorably re-appointed on the same post in the Army.<eos> "Your shoulder sways, My chest sways, ."<eos> " How will these broken hearted, Carry the burden of my faith?"<eos> "My infidelity sways, My loyalty sways."<eos> " Your slave sways."<eos> "My lord sways"<eos> "l have smiled And broken myself into a million pieces, For you my lord."
- We're just providing refugee camps.....<eos> - Come on, Nawaz.<eos> We all know what Dark Water does in reality.<eos> Refugee camps are just a front.<eos> America supplies weapons to Jihadis in Syria through Dark Water.<eos> And Lashkar is part of those rebel forces too.<eos> So you must know where they are.<eos> Why do you always trouble me?<eos> Hello.<eos> Seems like ISI has already informed Lashkar about you.
Of course you don't, Roy.<eos> - And don't you forget that.<eos> - Sir!<eos> Sir!<eos> The man you killed in Syria was not on our list, Daniyal.<eos> Sir, I already told you.<eos> Things got out of control.<eos> I didn't have any other choice.<eos> That was a stupid mistake.<eos> Now they know everything about you.
"And took a sip of liquor."<eos> "And now my name's tainted."<eos> "O Sweetheart."<eos> "O beautiful girl."<eos> "You're an arrow."<eos> "And my heart's the target."<eos> "She'll fear God if not her devotees."<eos> "Keep your promises."<eos> "O wow!"<eos> "I'll go and complain about You to God."
"She'll fear God if not her devotees."<eos> "Keep your promises."<eos> "O wow!"<eos> "I'll go and complain about You to God."<eos> The second one's ready as well.<eos> I'll use this to make a trigger.<eos> This is a toy car remote.<eos> Will it work?<eos> A similar remote was used in the Boston bombing.<eos> "l'll complain about you."
From me.<eos> What? From me.<eos> Because I don't know if you didn't notice, but everything that I'm around gets hurt.<eos> Ronan, you left me alone.<eos> I had to take care of things by myself.<eos> I had to take care of Dad by myself.<eos> I don't need your protection.<eos> What I needed was my older brother.<eos> You're not understanding what I'm s...<eos> I want you to know, when I get out of here, I'm knocking you clear out.
Dad?<eos> You.<eos> I've been looking for you for a long time.<eos> It's not me you want.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You're exactly who I want.<eos> The machine you made, no one's ever tapped into the building before.<eos> How did you manage to make a machine that could do that?<eos> I wanna know why you murdered my family.<eos> I don't have any answers for you.
Yeah, it's still Tedeschi.<eos> (Operator) Number?<eos> "N" as in Nancy, "T" as in Thomas, 703-1.<eos> (Operator) Hey, detective.<eos> Now this is the fifth time you guys put me on hold. (Operator) I do apologize for that.<eos> I see you're waiting on a warrant.<eos> For the last 50 minutes, pal.<eos> (Operator) Just give me one second to bring that up.<eos> The warrant has cleared processing. The approval should be coming through any second.<eos> Well, that would be great news, but the problem is, the last guy told me the exact same thing before he transferred me over to you.
Basic assault shit, a pair of drug offenses.<eos> We pulled a D.N.A. Swab from his fingernails.<eos> It's gonna take a couple hours to process.<eos> No drugs? Nothing on him?<eos> No.<eos> Doesn't sound like the kind of guy you'd bring out the stealth team for.<eos> Yeah, he wouldn't be top of my list.<eos> (Roy) This guy probably got caught in the crossfire.<eos> Detective.<eos> - Got something for you.
Come with me.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> This is the only sanctuary I could find this close to the city walls.<eos> People tend to avoid churches when they're living their lives in a state of perpetual fantasy.<eos> My God.<eos> My wife,<eos> No matter how many hours and days I spent trying to stop the spread of that disease...<eos> There was nothing I could do to save her life.<eos> Why does she look exactly like me?<eos> Because I designed you in her image.
No, we tried, we don't got much.<eos> I got you an old address for a next of kin... Evan Lund.<eos> - Send it to me.<eos> - All right.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (Kelly) How did all this come about?<eos> When we first introduced the technology, the people panicked.<eos> It was just too real.<eos> They could never allow you into the real world.
They could never allow you into the real world.<eos> So they passed a law banning all A.I.<eos> Then how did I end up where I did?<eos> I started building you as a side project.<eos> I didn't have any kind of plan. I just wanted to spend another five minutes with the woman that I loved.<eos> And Vice?<eos> Julian Michaels...<eos> This guy... he somehow talks his way into getting a special license to operate artificials in the strictly controlled confines of Vice.<eos> You gotta believe me, the second that I found out what his plan was, I tried to shut it down, walk away.<eos> But he had a controlling interest in the company, so he seized everything, including you.
That's from her last day.<eos> She's an artist.<eos> It's part of her character shading. Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> But there's no template for this particular image, meaning she created it herself.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> It's a real temple.<eos> We cross-checked the location against our records and we got a hit.<eos> Her genetic designer lives there.<eos> Evan Lund.<eos> I remember you.
You and I have both been living in an illusion.<eos> It's time for us to go live in the real world.<eos> All right, lovebirds.<eos> Hey, hey, take it easy now.<eos> It's a big gun.<eos> It's a sig sauer, with a compressor on.<eos> In fact, why don't you guys turn around?<eos> Look, you don't have to do this.<eos> She's not gonna hurt anybody. I know, I know.<eos> You're in love with a robot, but listen, the people who are after you are not gonna let you just walk away, pal.
Alan Sykes, back on the scene. - Jesus, look at that.<eos> - Alan, do you hear me?<eos> Scramble the S.R.T.<eos> They're still holding at pier 62. Make it happen.<eos> I want every officer we have in the area diverted to that facility right now.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You did it.<eos> You actually got in, you son of a bitch.<eos> It's the end of the line for you.
- May God forgive me.<eos> The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.<eos> He leads me beside quiet waters.<eos> He restores my soul.<eos> He guides me... in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<eos> For I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil.<eos> Simon Rants?<eos> Yes.<eos> Time to go, pal.<eos> The police are on their way, unfortunately for you, you'll be dead by the time they get here.
For the truth.<eos> Mr. Johnson?<eos> My name is Theresa Burke, and I'm here... because I heard that you needed some assistance.<eos> In finding a place?<eos> I have a place that I think you're really gonna love.<eos> It's, um... - It just came on the market.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Please, just stop.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.<eos> It must be a very difficult time for you.
Pilcher!<eos> Put down your weapon.<eos> Put it down.<eos> What is this?<eos> Some kind of an experiment?<eos> That's not Boise, okay?<eos> I know Boise.<eos> Your mind is lashing out, Ethan.<eos> It doesn't want to accept the truth, but trust your own eyes, everything you've seen today.<eos> There's nothing for you out here.
No. Can I borrow your gun?<eos> Shall I load it?<eos> No need.<eos> Captain Yem.<eos> Oh, hello sir!<eos> You weren't sleeping?<eos> I wish I could.<eos> The Japanese Consulate raided Mirabeau... a leak?<eos> Who could have done that?<eos> I like you very much.
Who the hell are you?<eos> What rotten luck.<eos> The Commander?<eos> Only minor wounds.<eos> Kang is unharmed, too.<eos> And the culprits?<eos> They're being taken to Central Police Station.<eos> Why there?<eos> Bring them to the military police.<eos> They were foiled, thanks to you.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> We believe Owen Hall, the head instructor, is the recruiter.<eos> Everything you'll learn is a capital offense.<eos> Something doesn't add up. Something about you.

You've already told your boyfriend you have this, which means your former employers now know, and their next move is to eliminate any threat to their mission.<eos> She's not FBI anymore.<eos> She could compromise your mission.<eos> I won't sabotage Alex.<eos> One way or another, she'll be done.<eos> Better it be you.<eos> You eliminate Ryan, and then we can talk.<eos> In the meantime, I will just stand back and see whether Mr. or Mrs. Smith survives.<eos> But a word of advice.<eos> Take Ryan out before he takes you out.
How's it going with Ryan?<eos> Have you worked out how to clear that playing field yet?<eos> I'm not going after him.<eos> I have my mission, he has his.<eos> Just so you know, this has rung a few more times.<eos> Wonder what they'll do if they think you're ignoring them.<eos> Living and working together.<eos> Sounds like my personal nightmare, no space.<eos> Didn't figure you for someone who had relationships.<eos> Didn't figure you for one, either.
Didn't figure you for someone who had relationships.<eos> Didn't figure you for one, either.<eos> Relationships make for weak operatives.<eos> Owen?<eos> Something I can help you with?<eos> You know what? I just figured it out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> See, I can understand falling into debt for a really beautiful Tom Ford tuxedo, but all these Bonobos?<eos> Are we sure they're gay?<eos> You do realize that I don't find you as charming as everyone else here does, right?

Consider this one a personal favor.<eos> Come on, you've already aided an act of treason.<eos> - I see you made it past the<eos> - Ryan, we need help.<eos> Something went wrong.<eos> The security guard you sent after me...<eos> Harry, he's hurt.<eos> And you really expect me to buy that?<eos> This isn't a game!<eos> I need you right now.
I see them.<eos> Didn't you tell them who you were?<eos> That's probably why they're shooting at us.<eos> We've lost the main thrusters.<eos> Brace for impact!<eos> Looks like recruiting the Wrens will be more difficult than I thought.<eos> You weren't easy to recruit either.<eos> So we switch to plan B.<eos> Better stay out of sight.<eos> I have a feeling we're gonna need you later.
The Protectors were executed for treason, just as Fenn Rau will be when he is found.<eos> They were loyal to Mandalore and Saxon betrayed them!<eos> Enough!<eos> Fenn Rau's people are dead and mine are not.<eos> And I intend to keep them that way.<eos> All of them. Except for me.<eos> Walk with me.<eos> So you're Sabine's brother?<eos> Hmm, I didn't even know she had a brother.<eos> I mean, it's not that she didn't want to talk about you, but she just, I don't know, she never really talked about you before.
The trick is keeping it, along with your head.<eos> Do you even know how to wield that blade?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Always so immature, so selfish.<eos> Yeah, and what about you?<eos> Always putting power and politics before your own family.<eos> Everything I do is to protect my family, Sabine!<eos> Please! You do it for control.<eos> And your father called me stubborn.<eos> Now I see it in you.
Well, I am your daughter.<eos> How could I be anything less?<eos> (SIGHS) Look, the rebels are planning something, and we need your help.<eos> It'd be the first real blow to the Empire and we can show the galaxy that they can be defeated.<eos> Please tell me these rebels are more than just a blind Jedi and some child.<eos> Our numbers are growing every day.<eos> Mother, this could be the key to freeing Mandalore from Imperial control.<eos> I am not a traitor.<eos> I want to save Mandalore too, but it needs a strong leader.<eos> You have to trust me, just like I'm trusting you.
If I can restore our family's name, if I can protect Father, then I have to try.<eos> Saxon promised!<eos> Gar Saxon cannot be trusted.<eos> Mother trusts him.<eos> Enough to trade the Jedi for your safety.<eos> (ENGINES RUMBLING DISTANTLY) Mother, what have you done?<eos> You can't do this!<eos> SAXON: Yes, she can.<eos> Because she is loyal.<eos> Just not to you.
Sabine!<eos> By Mandalorian custom and law, no one can interfere.<eos> Are your customs more important than the life of your daughter?<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> You have some skill.<eos> But not enough to save you.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I was about to say the same thing to you.<eos> Yield.<eos> I'll never yield to you, girl.
I hope that's true for both our sakes.<eos> If they discover you here, I'll be executed for treason!<eos> You might be anyway.<eos> We think the Empire was monitoring your last Fulcrum transmission.<eos> - So you got captured to warn me? - Nope.<eos> To get you out of here.<eos> Well, I guess I have no choice now.<eos> Look, I'm not happy about it, either.<eos> For all I know, you're playing a long game to set us up.<eos> I could say the same to you.
Ms. Schmidt-<eos> - FBI. We need your help.<eos> Oh, Christmas. I am so sorry.<eos> Are you okay, Agent Yermuther?<eos> I think she broke my back.<eos> [whispering] I broke Yermuther's back.<eos> -[Yermuther groans] -[Dunleavy] Easy. -[Dunleavy] Easy, easy.<eos> -[Yermuther] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. [upbeat music]<eos> I need you, Lillian.<eos> Lillian! Oh, well, I see you finally found the trash-picked baby monitor I hid in here to listen to you and Kimmy.
Got my poker set and 62 ounces of liquid plumber.<eos> Scared?<eos> I'm a Marine.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, you should be.<eos> It's like a tsunami in a bottle.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, Mr. B., this came for you.<eos> I had to sign for it and everything.<eos> It's a big-boy day for you, huh, Kyle?
Hey, Mr. Alzate, what's worse ...?<eos> Mr. B. getting in the Explorers Museum or his zingers?<eos> - You got invited?<eos> - Yeah, that was the news.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But you know what's gonna happen?<eos> You're gonna get in because you're a great great man.<eos> Oh!<eos> Direct hit.<eos> I'm very happy for you Mike.
I'm a part of Outdoor Man.<eos> Oh, yeah, Kyle, and a very valuable part.<eos> Pick that up, will you?<eos> Hey, Mikey, I just got a call from the Explorers Museum.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Turns out you were wrong.<eos> Well, that doesn't sound like me.<eos> It sure doesn't.<eos> Don't need any help.<eos> Looks like the invitation wasn't just for you.
Remember last night, my big speech about my cells dying?<eos> You're not dying.<eos> You're aging like everybody else except John Stamos.<eos> My mistake was treating you like a feeble old man.<eos> I never said I was feeble.<eos> Well, taking credit for somebody else's accomplishments... pretty feeble.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Having your name on that spearhead...<eos> No.<eos> ...is really that important to you?
Everybody's shaking their head, like, "Hell no, there's no way I'm doing that."<eos> Until this one skinny, tattooed arm raises into the sky, right?<eos> And it's this old toothless hooker.<eos> And she says, "You know what, I'll give it a go, but I'm not sure that stick's gonna fit in my mouth."<eos> Oh, come on, man!<eos> That's hilarious!<eos> Aw, the not-so-subtle, disingenuous slow clap.<eos> Thank you, thank you. I will be here all week.<eos> I mean, that is your... that is your plan, right?<eos> Well, actually, that's up to you.
What?<eos> On your feet.<eos> You're not gonna regret this.<eos> Oh, I'm not talking to you.<eos> Tiny, you're out of here. Thanks for your help, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He's funny.<eos> Oh, my gosh, wait a minute, you were trying to use him as intimidation?<eos> Oh, you amateur!<eos> I can't believe you did that. It's just... it's so sad for me to see you go to such great lengths to be such a rookie.
Please release all nonessential personnel.<eos> They'll be safer on their own away from here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - The hospital. - Whoa, whoa.<eos> We can't split up.<eos> That's, like, the number one rule of horror movies.<eos> The wolves are here for all of us.<eos> Someone needs to watch over Granger.<eos> Okay, then I'll go with you.<eos> No. I need you here.
We can't split up.<eos> That's, like, the number one rule of horror movies.<eos> The wolves are here for all of us.<eos> Someone needs to watch over Granger.<eos> Okay, then I'll go with you.<eos> No. I need you here.<eos> So do they.<eos> I no longer work for NCIS, remember?<eos> You're in charge, dear.<eos> What if they come for you and Granger first?
Shall we?<eos> That's my girl.<eos> I'm going to tear you open from the inside out.<eos> Sh... she said that?<eos> Man, my grandma didn't mess around, homie.<eos> She was a real O.G.<eos> Straight up, tough, but fair, and she always kept it real.<eos> Damn, man, I miss my grandma, man, for reals.<eos> Every day. Listen, you got to know that-that she's up there right now, you know?<eos> Looking down on you, watching out for you.
Every day. Listen, you got to know that-that she's up there right now, you know?<eos> Looking down on you, watching out for you.<eos> Amen to that, brother.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> Deeks, you have a visitor.<eos> Are they bigger than a bread box?<eos> Hey. Hey. What are you doing here?<eos> Detective Whiting said I could see you.<eos> That is uncharacteristically kind of her.<eos> Maybe my message of love is wearing off on you.
You like it?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> I am in a huge rush, but, uh,<eos> I thought you were being deployed.<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, but I-I got in this thing and so... you know, but it's-it's not a big deal.<eos> I really don't even need it.<eos> See?<eos> Look. Oh.<eos> Yeah. Then why are you...<eos> Yeah, in fact, it's for you.
Yeah, let's see if she left anything behind.<eos> Now, you've heard of shooting fish in a barrel, right?<eos> Well, this is shooting Hetty in a cage.<eos> Don't gloat, Carl. It's unprofessional.<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> Look at me. See, my face is going to be the last thing you're ever gonna see.<eos> The hell it is.<eos> You.<eos> I expected more from you.
'Cause she is so rude, every single time.<eos> Okay, she's an operative, like you, Krystal. Okay?<eos> So right now we just need to stick to the facts.<eos> Now, you said that they were targeting a cosmetics exec that you met?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Leonard Sipp.<eos> Len is like...<eos> He's like an artist in the industry.<eos> We met at a trade show.<eos> Girl, he's totally into you.
Okay, so, I probably shouldn't admit to this because Len Sipp is such a big deal... but I kinda have a tiny problem with stealing things.<eos> I haven't made the budget either.<eos> Okay, when he gets off the phone, you go after him.<eos> Yeah. Ask him why Dyad would be interested in a cosmetics company.<eos> See if it has anything to do with this gene called LIN28A.<eos> - Lin what?<eos> - 28A.<eos> Listen, Krystal.<eos> I know you can do this, all right?<eos> I believe in you.
Oh, my God.<eos> We gotta get out of here.<eos> - Don't you have family in Seattle?<eos> - They don't want me.<eos> I'm sure that's not true.<eos> - Ira.<eos> - Hey. You can't be down here.<eos> Susan has a plan.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're talking about taking a stand against all of this. But we need you too, Mud.

If you need to take a break, you can.<eos> Darling, we haven't slept all week.<eos> You're exhausted.<eos> - I... just an idea.<eos> - What's my next call?<eos> But you're not enjoying yourself.<eos> Because he won't listen to me.<eos> He can't win in the House.<eos> I'm not talking about him.<eos> I'm talking about you.
They eat together, they piss next to each other, and they carve up the world like a Sunday roast.<eos> This is where the real power is.<eos> No women or presidents allowed.<eos> The former, I am not.<eos> The latter, I will be again, because I have managed to reduce a national election down to one state.<eos> And while these men here can't swing the votes of an entire nation... one measly state?<eos> Well, that they can do.<eos> And that's why I'm here.<eos> So welcome to Elysian Fields.<eos> It's strange for you, isn't it?
I don't know you get to ask that.<eos> She was my teacher.<eos> Theology, among other things.<eos> I don't know why I did that.<eos> It's not... about jealousy.<eos> She saved my life, actually.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Well, we won't be seeing Karen for a while.<eos> She knows me.<eos> She could see how I feel about you.
- You've made a thousand deals.<eos> - Yeah, well, this one is different.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I can feel it right here.<eos> - Do you hear yourself?<eos> - Yeah, loud and clear.<eos> I'm a little confused that you don't seem to hear me at all.<eos> Once we're solidly back in power, - we will regain our position...<eos> - That is naive.<eos> Naive is new for you.
No, I... I will defend the president.<eos> Vice presidential business as usual is the way to play it, I think.<eos> You need to trust my instincts on this one.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you, Mark.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You may not always agree with him, but you like him.<eos> I like his clarity.<eos> Let's just not forget, his candidate lost.<eos> And now he works for you.

I forced the Secretary of Health and Human Services... to put Francis Underwood in front of him on the donor list.<eos> I understand if you think I'm a monster.<eos> But I'd do it again.<eos> To save the president, I'd do anything.<eos> You really think that I didn't know, Doug?<eos> The timing gave it away.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What did you think was going on here?<eos> I'm not fucking you because I like you. I'm fucking you because I hate you.
You have no idea...<eos> I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.<eos> What?<eos> I killed Zoe Barnes.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.<eos> She said she wanted to be invisible.<eos> I knew it wasn't possible.<eos> I knew that she would only ever go away... if I made sure of it.<eos> I don't believe you.
I knew it wasn't possible.<eos> I knew that she would only ever go away... if I made sure of it.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Believe me...<eos> I deserve this.<eos> Zoe Barnes fell in front of a train.<eos> It was ruled an accident. I pushed her off the platform and I walked away.<eos> I know you reached out to Bridget Cohen.<eos> Telling that committee or her how I got my liver is not going to help this administration or you.
I'd rather not.<eos> So, what?<eos> Money?<eos> Yeah... but enough.<eos> Enough so I can really get lost for a while.<eos> Buy some time till I figure out what I'm gonna do next.<eos> We can figure something out.<eos> I bet.<eos> You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...<eos> - I've never told anyone but you.
We can figure something out.<eos> I bet.<eos> You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...<eos> - I've never told anyone but you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know everything.<eos> But isn't that what you wanted?<eos> I miss touching you.<eos> I don't know how to not be around you.<eos> I think of you all the time.
You're so beautiful.<eos> - Keep going.<eos> - Not just beautiful, beautiful.<eos> There's lots of people like that.<eos> You are radiant, Claire.<eos> And good. You are so good.<eos> - I'm not good.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - Why won't you kiss me?<eos> - I wanna look at you.
How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.<eos> It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.<eos> Look, Claire, you and I have always been on the inside. Trapped. In the bubble.<eos> But going forward... with my operating on the outside, in the private sector, and you working from here... we can own this house together.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> I've designed this.<eos> I wanted you to be the president.<eos> I've made you the president.
You can do what you want with it.<eos> - When do you meet with the US attorney?<eos> - Day after tomorrow.<eos> I never thought that Frank Underwood would not be president.<eos> Not really.<eos> You could just run away.<eos> What does that get me?<eos> You're good at taking care of yourself.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Look, I want you to know that I care for you, but I don't know how much I can be there.
I just try to remain as clear as possible.<eos> You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.<eos> You know... I was here before you and I'll be here after you.<eos> And regardless of that, let me remind you... that nothing is more dangerous than me.<eos> You need to be practical now.<eos> Davis isn't wrong.<eos> We've been trying to get our hands on Ahmadi for a year, Francis.<eos> - She hasn't delivered.<eos> - Yes, but this isn't about her.<eos> This is about you and coming out with a strong message in your first address to the nation.
What's Good Friday?<eos> It's the day Jesus got nailed to a cross to slowly suffocate.<eos> And also, they stabbed him and made him drink vinegar and laughed at him.<eos> How is that good?<eos> I think it was meant to be sarcastic.<eos> Remember, his people were Jewish.<eos> Like Seinfeld.<eos> Wonderful!<eos> -[door opens] -[Lillian] Hey. Is this too Egyptian for a Seder?<eos> Yes, I think my accessories are a little too major for you.
It's a sad story. But spare the rod and spoil the child.<eos> Oh, look at the time.<eos> Honey, you be Ruth and shoulder my burden.<eos> I'm gon' be like Naomi and go to bingo.<eos> Glory to God!<eos> -[Reuben] ♪ Elijah Rock ♪ -[choir] ♪ Rock ♪<eos> -[Reuben] ♪ Shout, shout, shout ♪ -[choir] ♪ Shout, shout ♪<eos> ♪ Elijah Rock comin' up, Lord ♪<eos> ♪ Satan is a liar and a conjurer too ♪<eos> ♪ If you don't mind high He'll come to you ♪
Well, I hate to say I told you so, because I prefer the less formal "toldja."<eos> Toldja!<eos> She used the Bible to manipulate me.<eos> Just like--<eos> Gosh dang it!<eos> I mean, is that what all religion is?<eos> Basically.<eos> That and cut-up doughnuts.<eos> Don't they know I can reassemble those doughnuts? Uh-huh.<eos> Well, Clara's gonna talk to Reuben tomorrow. About you.
That and cut-up doughnuts.<eos> Don't they know I can reassemble those doughnuts? Uh-huh.<eos> Well, Clara's gonna talk to Reuben tomorrow. About you.<eos> Like how Jesus knew Judas would betray him in the morning.<eos> Well, unlike Jesus, I'm not just gonna give up.<eos> I'm a good person, Kimmy.<eos> I can't let Clara ruin everything.<eos> -We've gotta stop her!<eos> -But how? The only thing that stopped Bernice was the pressure and the sugar.<eos> We've gotta tell on her before she tells on you.
And that young, impressionable girl in the fishing gear... was me.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That was the whole story.<eos> I just don't want that to happen to you.<eos> Especially if you care about Artie.<eos> After that night, I never saw 15-year-old Eric Trump again.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll agree to put on one item of your clothing if you put on one of mine.<eos> Come upstairs.<eos> I'm just making an educated guess about you, but I'm allergic to cats.
What white nonsense is this?<eos> What the hell are you wearing?<eos> You look like a black guy on Easter.<eos> We're on our way to kick a little old lady out of church to prove I'm a good person.<eos> But we almost forgot our bait.<eos> To the clothing drive!<eos> The clothes just took me here, Lillian.<eos> Titus Apollonia Andromedon.<eos> How do you know my fake middle name?<eos> Oh, I know all about you.
That's one. Ignore him.<eos> Yeah, sorry about the breakup.<eos> That's okay, I'm fine.<eos> Of course you're fine.<eos> Not every member of a species finds a mate.<eos> Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin.<eos> Look at the contributions he made.<eos> I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.<eos> Wha... So now you think you're better than Isaac Newton?<eos> No wonder women don't like you.
There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.<eos> Yeah, but that's shooting fish in a barrel.<eos> You're kind of a sad sack.<eos> I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I'm just upset.<eos> No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings.<eos> And I'm proud of you-- for reasons I'm sure have something to do with my father.<eos> And if you don't like that machine, get rid of it.<eos> Because I love you exactly the way you are.<eos> I feel the same way about you.
I can't believe I've never noted this incredibly beautiful freckle on your nose.<eos> Ugh!<eos> It's just one more part of you for me to love.
On the beach.<eos> That's just not fair.<eos> I'll tell you what's not fair, that horse underneath him instead of you.<eos> Why are you trying to wind me up?<eos> 'Cause you deserve to date a handsome guy, and I always like sticking it to Marjorie.<eos> He is handsome.<eos> Handsome and rugged.<eos> They don't make rugged anymore.<eos> I blame soy milk.<eos> You know, he couldn't take his hazel-green- with-a-fleck-of-blue eyes off of you.
I blame soy milk.<eos> You know, he couldn't take his hazel-green- with-a-fleck-of-blue eyes off of you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - He was totally eye-boning you.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I'm not going behind Marjorie's back.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Why pursue the perfect man if it might temporarily make an elderly woman uncomfortable?<eos> You know Marjorie's only, like, ten years older than you, right?<eos> If you ever say that again, I will gut you like a fish.

Please tell me you didn't sleep with him.<eos> - She did.<eos> - Three times.<eos> Christy!<eos> - Actually, three and a half.<eos> - Three and a half?<eos> How do you think I got him to stop singing?<eos> This is bad, this is very bad.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, this is bad for you.
Stop and think before you act.<eos> Instincts will catch up.<eos> It's good to see you guys.<eos> The royal family's been great and all, but they're so focused on the new Inhumans, they've left me to explore Attilan on my own.<eos> Did you know they have secret laboratories?<eos> Oh. And they have catacombs.<eos> You, new Inhuman with the power of fire.<eos> What do they call you back home?<eos> Freak? Misfit?<eos> Wherever you come from, they don't trust you.
They know you're not like them.<eos> You'll never be normal again.<eos> Normal's overrated.<eos> (VOICE ECHOING) You're a monster.<eos> No... I'm not!<eos> HULK: Remember what I told you!<eos> (GRUNTS) This is the opposite of control.<eos> The registration disk itself is small.<eos> Everyone will forget they're wearing it.<eos> Sounds convenient for you.
Sound like anyone you know?<eos> IRON MAN: Dante.<eos> Get through the force field or everyone on Attilan will be trapped.<eos> Let's hope Hulk's having better luck with Inferno.<eos> Inferno?<eos> It's me!<eos> Just want to talk!<eos> I destroyed the palace.<eos> It's all my fault. That was all Maximus.<eos> No one blames you.
This doesn't feel right.<eos> Yeah, this isn't just the Avengers HQ. It's their home.<eos> Kind of feels like we're intruding.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I'm all for it.<eos> Those other guys left their jobs and abandoned this place.<eos> Finders keepers, I say.<eos> Since the Terrigen Mist created all the new Inhumans, the world needs Avengers.<eos> The world needs you.<eos> Which means working for you, registering new Inhumans and fitting them with a tracking disk?
BLACK WIDOW: Long time no see, Baron!<eos> But not nearly long enough.<eos> Heard someone's taking credit for my exo-suit design.<eos> The Avengers!<eos> I mean, the old Aven...<eos> I mean, yay!<eos> Surprised to see them here.<eos> Unless they've changed the design, that uni-beam blast bought us a few seconds.<eos> Take him down.<eos> First, I'm gonna take care of you, and then I'm getting you for that tomato crack!
Take them into custody, and get Cap to a medic.<eos> Pronto!<eos> (GROWLING) Let 'em do what they gotta do, Hulk, as long as it gets Cap to a doctor.<eos> This is, like, totally embarrassing, but I'm really still a big fan.<eos> Where is Romanoff?<eos> Where is Black Widow?<eos> Natasha?<eos> (CHUCKLES) Good luck.<eos> You don't find her unless she wants to be found.<eos> And by then, it'll be too late for you.
Widow!<eos> Funny, the people you meet in prison. Huh? (ROBOTS APPROACHING)<eos> Through there!<eos> Go! I brought backup.<eos> The backup has arrived.<eos> Black Bolt and Medusa are helping us?<eos> You'll need to catch me up on who's on whose side.<eos> After we find and free the others.<eos> Already did.<eos> Natasha got us out before she got you.
So did I, to tell you the truth.<eos> Why do I say that?<eos> I always tell the truth.<eos> Lousy bot!<eos> Gonna smash you into... (GROANS)<eos> It's rude to interrupt. (GRUNTS)<eos> Widow, take half the team and concentrate your attacks on one bot at a time.<eos> Falcon, take the others and do the same.<eos> Keep it for a sec.<eos> It's a good look on you.
Tony, I know you can't rush genius, but hurry up!<eos> This is it, tweak the code syntax and it should...<eos> And it should break the link between Ultron and the Inhumans.<eos> Hulk, I need an Inhuman.<eos> You sure this is gonna work?<eos> It's our best shot.<eos> Think you can get the hothead inside?<eos> Don't want to hurt him!<eos> Dante... Trusts me!<eos> He also trusts you to do the right thing for all the Inhumans.
This should broadcast a signal just strong enough to reach Inferno.<eos> If it works, we go worldwide.<eos> Dante...<eos> That you?<eos> Got it.<eos> Now we hack into the global satellite network, insert the code, broadcast it, and cross our fingers that it gets... (RUMBLING)<eos> We are out of time, Stark.<eos> (GRUNTING) HULK:<eos> All right, buddy, time out!<eos> I will use my full strength against you if necessary.
(SLOWLY) Can't believe I'm saying this.<eos> Magic...<eos> Now.<eos> Tony?<eos> IRON MAN: I'm okay...<eos> Now what?<eos> We devise a plan.<eos> Let's figure out how to get you out of here.<eos> No, you guys have to leave.<eos> Not going anywhere without you.
Work with the others.<eos> Rebuild trust between humans and Inhumans.<eos> There are a lot of fences to mend.<eos> You wouldn't leave any of us, we're not going to abandon you.<eos> We all have work to do, I just have to do it from here.<eos> Tony, you've been the best friend I've had since...<eos> Well, maybe ever.<eos> I like to think I work best alone, Cap.<eos> But the truth is, I'm better because you're my friend.<eos> Tony... I'm not sure we can do it without you.
Gregorio!<eos> You should have seen your face.<eos> Yeah, we got you so good.<eos> NCIS Special Agent Gregorio, we'd like to officially welcome you to our team, to the city, with a special slice of New Orleans pecan pie.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> And for future reference, I hate surprises.<eos> So you hate fun.<eos> Surprises aren't fun.<eos> And I'm not much of an agent if I can't sniff out a surprise.<eos> Well, we got one more for you.
- Oh, that's nice.<eos> Oh, look at the happiness pouring out of the hat.<eos> I think I made a mistake.<eos> Time for work.<eos> The body of Lieutenant Jay Nielsen was just fished out of the Gulf.<eos> Landing on Loretta's table as we speak.<eos> Sonja, you're with me at the morgue.<eos> Lasalle and Gregorio, dig into Lieutenant Nielsen's recent whereabouts.<eos> Find out how he ended up in the drink.<eos> Oh, you, a little agent.
Oh. Sorry, guys.<eos> Ow, ow, cut it out, cut it out, ow, ow.<eos> I said no more cell phones, Lund.<eos> You got yourself killed, and your team, too!<eos> I can explain.<eos> No, you can't, because you are dead.<eos> Dead men do not talk.<eos> Yeah, but the point is my team keeps calling me, and I-I can't...<eos> I don't care if the president of the United States is calling you.<eos> I catch you on that phone again, you're done.
Close down 15.<eos> And the mud-gas separator.<eos> No, it's not working.<eos> Someone must be remotely overriding the pumps.<eos> We can't stop them.<eos> Got to keep trying.<eos> If we stick around here, we're dead.<eos> Come on!<eos> We got to get everyone off this rig.<eos> Right behind you.
What?<eos> This is a really bad idea.<eos> I don't even know where the ventilation system leads to.<eos> Out of here.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> Listen, you follow this vent until you find another one.<eos> Get to the mess hall and get the crew to the lifeboats.<eos> We're back online.<eos> Hello?<eos> It's for you.
Not from here.<eos> We got, like, nine minutes!<eos> We got to get to the lifeboats.<eos> No, Bonnie and the crew took 'em.<eos> You got no other option but to help me.<eos> Just a couple holes in the pipeline, huh?<eos> Do it for my family.<eos> Isn't that what you said, Hauser?<eos> Uh-uh, this is his fault.<eos> Keep waving that weapon in my face, I'll feed it to you.
Nonsense.<eos> You just have a-a well-developed sense of self-preservation.<eos> You're training to be a medical examiner, not an NCIS field agent.<eos> I have no doubt that you have it in you to die a hero's death, but, for the time being, I'd appreciate it if you could stay alive to help me examine the dead.<eos> And with that very healthy sense of self-preservation, I ask you to please stay alive, so that we can both die like heroes a very long time from now when we're old and gray, all right?<eos> My dad was 53.<eos> He was an actual war hero.<eos> Thanks to me, he didn't die like one.<eos> Why?<eos> Why thanks to you? Why?
I need to get back there.<eos> We all gonna fit on the ledge and hold hands?<eos> You want to help Palmer?<eos> Do your job. Right.<eos> Well, Captain Smith is down on my table.<eos> Perhaps he can help.<eos> I can be your Jimmy, Ducky.<eos> Not while we still need Abby, Abby.<eos> I spoke to the ATM company.<eos> They're sending security footage over to you any moment. Okay.
About you coming to work full-time as my assistant.<eos> It will never happen again, Doctor, I promise.<eos> It was an extremely unusual situation.<eos> They always are.<eos> See, I was in the shower, and, the doorbell rang, but I didn't know it at the time.<eos> I hope this won't become a habit, Mr. Palmer.<eos> No. See, I always answer my door.<eos> I was referring to you being late.<eos> Does this mean I have a job?<eos> I'm glad it worked out for you, I am.
Most of all, I don't want to cut open another friend.<eos> We only get the B-sides on our table.<eos> And it is every day.<eos> I also see their families, Ryan.<eos> Some of them let their loss just knock 'em cold.<eos> And they drown in misery, while others, they choose to make their darkest hour their defining moment.<eos> They choose to take something bad and turn it into something good.<eos> Like your dad did.<eos> My dad?<eos> When he lost your mom, he chose to put everything he had into you.
Means it wasn't your fault, Ryan.<eos> Not your fault.<eos> You want to get this guy, we need you to testify at the trial.<eos> Palmer.<eos> That's my dad's wallet.<eos> There's something in there you're gonna want.<eos> My senior thesis project.<eos> Plenty of miles on that photo.<eos> He showed it off a lot.<eos> He was proud of you. Yeah.
I said, damn, what a wild couple of days.<eos> Anyways, 'sup with you guys?<eos> Sorry, amigo, not interested.<eos> (SNEEZES) This is what happens when you lick your spilled latte off the steering wheel.<eos> She did that. She's gross.<eos> - Lois, are you okay?<eos> - Ugh. Yeah. It's just my allergies.<eos> (SNIFFS) I can't figure out what it is.<eos> Maybe it's Brian.<eos> He practically sleeps on top of you.
LOIS: Peter, Peter, Peter... CLEVELAND:<eos> Roadhouse. That's nasty. That's nasty.<eos> What?<eos> Wha-Wha-Wha-What?<eos> This place is awesome!<eos> Totally!<eos> And did you see Tom Sizemore in the bathroom with a ladle?<eos> You've been playing the exact same song for 14 hours.<eos> That means you're great.<eos> I was right about you, guy.
Okay, red flags flying.<eos> Look, I need him out of here.<eos> You can't kick him out.<eos> He's my friend, and I live here, too.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I want you out of my room.<eos> Well, it's not your room anymore, it's our room.<eos> Lois said so, and I'm not leaving.<eos> I can't believe I ever wanted you here in the first place.<eos> You're messy, you're loud, and thanks to you, we've got a recurring flea problem.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> A sleeping curse?<eos> That's never kept us apart before.<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!<eos> You may have stopped me, but you can't stop The Savior.<eos> Now you are mine.<eos> Emma, are you there?<eos> I was on my way back to you, and Gideon... He wanted me out of the way.
- Where are we?<eos> - Neverland.<eos> Get the pirate!<eos> Make him pay!<eos> Over there!<eos> Oh, bloody hell.<eos> Look, I've got... I've got treasure buried all over this island and, uh...<eos> and rum.<eos> Any of you lads old enough to drink rum?<eos> There's only one thing we want from you... to make you pay for what happened to Pan.
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're confused. You've been in a coma.<eos> The Evil Queen's guards... They stabbed me. I-I passed out, and then...<eos> The curse must have brought us here, whatever this place is.<eos> I'm gonna go get a doctor.<eos> All right.<eos> Whatever she did to you,<eos> I know Snow White is in there somewhere. - Trust me.<eos> - You are delusional and speaking gibberish.<eos> Why would I trust you?
We'll soon see about that.<eos> Put it down.<eos> There's a good boy.<eos> Don't look so surprised.<eos> I practically invented Dark Magic.<eos> But worry not.<eos> I won't force you to do anything.<eos> When you join me, it will be because you want to.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Because I will never join you.
Like Snow and me.<eos> And your daughter.<eos> Emma? - Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> You guys draw up the search grid?<eos> Yeah, we did, but if we're gonna find that flower before we're both asleep for good, we're gonna need your mother's tracking skills, which means it's time for me to say good night.<eos> How do you do it, Dad?<eos> You and Mom have been separated by the curse for weeks, and you still found a way to work together.<eos> Well, even though I can't be with her, I know that she's fighting for me just as hard as I am for her.<eos> Emma, I know Hook is out there doing the same for you.
I'm not your errand boy.<eos> The women I love is in danger, and every second I spend arguing with you should be spent finding a way back to her.<eos> You expect for me to believe that Killian Jones fell in love?<eos> This isn't driftwood. It's a weapon.<eos> And it's the only chance we have of winning the coming war.<eos> Whatever war there is, it isn't mine to fight.<eos> There's a great darkness on the horizon, Hook.<eos> If you don't do what I'm asking, the Savior will die.<eos> The Savior?<eos> Yes. A great hero, unlike you.
No, she doesn't have to be the Savior anymore.<eos> We're awake.<eos> Well, Snow White and Prince Charming may be awake, but the rest of this town is very much asleep.<eos> Find Emma now, and she will never fulfill her destiny, the curse will never be broken, and everyone will be trapped here forever.<eos> What do you expect us to do...<eos> Just leave her out there?<eos> Drink this, like I'm going to.<eos> It'll put you back under, and then, when the time is right,<eos> Emma will find us.<eos> That's easy for you to say.
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know what you're really meant to be, Lucy.<eos> Just ask them why they really chose you for this mission.<eos> - Car trouble?<eos> - You're with Rittenhouse.<eos> If you keep playing your part, it helps us protect everyone.<eos> You, your family.
I want you to help me steal the time machine to save Jess.<eos> He... he brought it back, okay?<eos> No harm, right?<eos> - Tell me about Jessica.<eos> - Jessica's still dead.<eos> She's alive, guys, please!<eos> That's my father.<eos> I'm glad you know about Rittenhouse.<eos> What you are a part of is inhuman.<eos> Well, I've got news for you, my dear, you're a part of it too.
I was 17... when my father told me about Rittenhouse.<eos> And how do you handle a responsibility like that?<eos> Took me a long, long time to come to grips with it.<eos> My father... your grandfather... Ethan Cahill, he's still alive.<eos> You'll meet him soon.<eos> He ran away when he was told.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You'll come around like we all did, because it's who you are, Lucy.<eos> It's your legacy.<eos> You know, not a day goes by that I don't think of you.
Your personal life might be a mess, but you always have the facts.<eos> It's like... standing on concrete.<eos> But then you realize that you're standing on quicksand, and nothing's true.<eos> You know, you're wrong about one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> When Ernest calls them the Lost Generation, he doesn't mean aimless.<eos> He means battered... broke down... but getting ready to stand back up.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I like that.<eos> I like you.
Lucy.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I know meeting your father has thrown you, and I get it that you don't want to talk to me about it, but what do we do in our family when we go through tough times?<eos> When we need to collect our thoughts?<eos> We write them down.<eos> We write them down.<eos> It's a journal.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Boy, we really could've used you.
You're a grandfather.<eos> And you an uncle.<eos> Does she know?<eos> We're gonna tell her.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> Don't worry, Grandpa.<eos> You survived worse than this.<eos> Bayonet in Korea, shrapnel to your lungs at Khe Sanh.<eos> This is just a little difficulty breathing, that's all.<eos> And I'm gonna stay right with you. Make sure these guys know what they're doing.
So, what kind of assistance does your grandmother need?<eos> Physical?<eos> Dietary?<eos> No, none of the above.<eos> What I really want to see is your security room.<eos> She has a habit of sneaking off. Uh, sure.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And she doesn't miss a beat.<eos> Next part's up to you.
Do you think we should be worried?<eos> I'm sure he has a good reason.<eos> They accepted your story?<eos> Yeah, Pacey stuck with it, said one of the dealers found the wire.<eos> But that an NCIS agent undercover came in and saved him.<eos> I think Pacey's just happy to be out of the CI business.<eos> And you?<eos> You are not compromised?<eos> Officially, no.<eos> Unofficially... I crossed a line for you today, cleaning up your mess.
Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.<eos> Nicely done, Howard.<eos> Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.<eos> Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.
I know. That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.<eos> You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.<eos> I've been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now's the time.<eos> W-We can just lock the door; you don't have to kill him.<eos> You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.<eos> Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.<eos> As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.<eos> Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.
Good luck.<eos> People have been saying that for 600 years.<eos> Hey, you're home early.<eos> You'll never believe it.<eos> Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.<eos> Wow. He finally used it.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> No idea.<eos> All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.<eos> Well, I'm really happy for you.
"It's alive," we run.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.<eos> I'm welding this locomotive engine.<eos> And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?<eos> How'd you even get that up the stairs?<eos> I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."<eos> And then I couldn't, so...<eos> I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.<eos> Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.
I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.<eos> I'm not getting any younger.<eos> Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of...<eos> Careful.<eos> The sound of crying can make me lactate.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> Oh, that's gonna make me cry.<eos> And there they go.<eos> Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.
How do boys decide who calls?<eos> Is that what "top" means? Ignoring this.<eos> And then afterwards,<eos> I went to the gas station to use the bathroom, and it's got a "customers only" policy now.<eos> I was forced to buy gum. [Titus exhales sharply]<eos> Gum is the lie your mouth tells your stomach.<eos> Titus, just use our bathroom.<eos> Never, Kimmy Jimmel.<eos> Our bathroom is strictly for grooming, shame eating, and pep talks before trying to put on jeans.<eos> Unlike you, I have some self-respect, which means I need to get my own copy of that key. How?
What the hell are you still doing here?<eos> Get a life, why don't ya?<eos> You're right.<eos> I will.<eos> [chuckles mockingly] Banned!<eos> Now on the clock, the Washington Gun-Takers with the 20th pick of the NFL draft.<eos> Up next, the Seattle Raisins That You Think Are Chocolate Chips.<eos> Ugh, I hate them.<eos> They're liars.<eos> Jackie Lynn, I haven't been this proud of you since that misprint in the paper said that you were a National Merit Finalist.
You know what that means?<eos> You did drugs to get better at school.<eos> You fucking dorks.<eos> You're not having sex because you're too busy online trying to get likes.<eos> You know how your parents got likes?<eos> By fucking people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'd fuck somebody.<eos> They'd be, like, "Do you like me?"<eos> "Yeah, I like you." "Great, I just got a like."
You did drugs to get better at school.<eos> You fucking dorks.<eos> You're not having sex because you're too busy online trying to get likes.<eos> You know how your parents got likes?<eos> By fucking people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'd fuck somebody.<eos> They'd be, like, "Do you like me?"<eos> "Yeah, I like you." "Great, I just got a like."<eos> If they told someone about you, and you had sex with that person, that was a retweet.
No one wants a bad relationship with their father.<eos> He never understood, I wanted a relationship with him, so I would always try, you know, despite his behavior.<eos> Like, when Half Baked came out, it wasn't well reviewed... And I'd say correctly.<eos> But my dad was such a narcissist that he was mad at me somehow, like I'd embarrassed him.<eos> You know, famously, Harry Truman, the president, when he was sitting president, his daughter did a play and got a bad review, and Truman wrote the reviewer a nasty note threatening to fight him... on White House stationery.<eos> Yeah, like, that's the way you're supposed to do it, whereas my dad would have written, "Read your review of Neal's movie.<eos> Spot-on."<eos> And when Chappelle's Show got popular, he was interested again, but I was, like, "I don't...<eos> Man, come on. Take a walk."<eos> I don't need you when things go well, I need you all the time."
There's a man I know who works as a docent in a small museum in the Northwest.<eos> He recently remarried.<eos> Rotary Tuesdays. Euchre Fridays.<eos> A modest but happy life.<eos> Gavin and I played Euchre. Before you killed him.<eos> Gavin was a brilliant accountant. And an even better man... who worshiped you.<eos> When the Feds came asking questions about the nature of his relationship with me, his only thoughts were about whether you and your children would be safe and well provided for.<eos> This person you described...<eos> I didn't kill your husband.<eos> I helped him walk away from everything he loved to protect you and your innocence.
Where is he?<eos> Who hired you?<eos> I got an anonymous package... detailing... files a-about every aspect of your operations, and... And your payment?<eos> I received a credit stick.<eos> It's in my apartment.<eos> It's in the... the lining of a red silk dress.<eos> Now, my husband...<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's married.<eos> He remembers you as you were.
What I do care about is the lives of the people out there, so just...<eos> Okay.<eos> I need... I need something that burns.<eos> Crap, come on.<eos> This damn scarf.<eos> Was any of it real?<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> What we did at night with the lights off?<eos> That was personal.<eos> The way you let me feel about you...
I told you you would be amazing.<eos> You don't have to say that.<eos> It's true.<eos> I killed a man today.<eos> And by killing him, I prevented us from interrogating him.<eos> From getting information on his other cases and clients, victims.<eos> Aram, you did the right thing.<eos> She's the reason we were able to find you.<eos> Hey, Janet...<eos> I'm probably only alive because of you, so... thank you for that.
I need to speak with you right away.<eos> Call me as soon as you possibly can.<eos> He never showed up?<eos> Can you reach him? No, no, no.<eos> Put Sidney on the line.<eos> Do you know where he went?<eos> Yes, yes, yes. As soon as you hear.<eos> Don't worry, sweetheart.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I won't ever give up on you.
And then you will have something to charge me with.<eos> Arnold, give agent navabi copies of whatever she needs.<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> Give it a go, sweetheart.<eos> Come on.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I know, dear.<eos> I don't want to, but what choice do I have?<eos> I can't trust you to stay if you're not sedated.
How'd you know that was gonna work?<eos> You ever trip over one of those things in the dark?<eos> They're lethal.<eos> Reddington.<eos> Elizabeth, where are you?<eos> Asa hightower, the apothecary, we have him in custody, and we found his lab.<eos> Have you identified the toxin?<eos> The lab's working on it. Not yet, but they will.<eos> Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison.<eos> One of my men is bringing it to you now.
All right, inmates, go, out of your racks.<eos> Out!<eos> What happened?<eos> Welcoming committee.<eos> You ok?<eos> I am right now.<eos> It's later I'm worried about.<eos> Anything I can do to help?<eos> Give me some of that "Don't touch the skinny white guy"<eos> Pixie dust you got sprinkled on you.
This ain't social hour.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> No touching.<eos> Is everything ok? It's not my mom, is it?<eos> No.<eos> No, she's fine.<eos> She's fine.<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> She asked about you.
She claims he's the Bone Crusher.<eos> To against conscience is neither right nor safe. Here I stand.<eos> I can do other...<eos> Martin Luther.<eos> I'd love to get a piece of that, huh? It's ok.<eos> Hey, quiet in there!<eos> Hmm?<eos> It's not my first time in a prison.<eos> I can handle it. Sorry.<eos> I don't want them looking at you. I know.
Said it happened pretty fast.<eos> She got hit in the head pretty good.<eos> I'll have our field office assist in canvassing the area.<eos> Copy that.<eos> This guy, he knows we're onto him.<eos> He's not gonna wait long before he starts breaking bones.<eos> Go sit down.<eos> What was that?<eos> I was thirsty.<eos> I helped you because I like you.
Or so you believe.<eos> Edgar Legate is nothing more than a name I employ to take credit for various killings for which I or my associates are responsible.<eos> One of my competitors, Baldur Magnusson, is actively seeking a reliable independent contractor to kill me, someone I won't see coming.<eos> I think Legate would fit the bill nicely.<eos> - And you want me to become Legate?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'm not gonna play dress-up assassin so you can kill someone I've never met.<eos> I don't need you to become Legate to kill Magnusson.<eos> I need you to become Legate so Magnusson will hire you to kill me.<eos> You want me to deliver him to you? Yes.
- They found the house.<eos> - Who? The cops.<eos> They have all of our equipment and our research.<eos> - Well, what should we do?<eos> - What can we do? Natalie, we have to start all over again.<eos> Malik, I'm sure there's something we c...<eos> - Natalie, just... - Don't!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Natalie.<eos> There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you.
The writing is atrocious, but I can't put them down.<eos> Other than being rich, what do these three have in common?<eos> Xavier Holcombe's annual poker bash. An all cash, no limit marathon with positively obscene stakes.<eos> - How obscene?<eos> - Buy-in is half a million, quite the research grant for our star-crossed outlaws.<eos> I bought in on a lark three years ago.<eos> Lost my... well, no one has a shirt that expensive.<eos> Nevertheless, I had a ball.<eos> It's a weekend of delicious isolation and degenerate risk...<eos> Heaven. Just like everything else is to you. A game.
- Belgium.<eos> You know, Tom and I were just starting to find some semblance of normalcy.<eos> And you had to just sweep in, drag him back down your rabbit hole.<eos> There must be dozens of contract operatives just like him.<eos> Why him?<eos> Tom is very good at what he does.<eos> It defines him.<eos> He can no sooner choose to stop than a great white shark can choose to stop swimming and eating.<eos> He will do what he does. But at least if he's doing it for me, he won't risk a double-cross, unlike with the vast majority of his prospective employers.<eos> Because unlike them, I genuinely care for him. Or rather you, and your daughter.
As I told your goons...<eos> Oh, tut, tut. Don't be uncharitable.<eos> These gentlemen are seasoned professionals like yourself,<eos> Monsieur Edgar... Legate.<eos> I don't insist on the Monsieur.<eos> That Saudi oil minister in Kuala Lumpur...<eos> How on earth did you manage that one? I don't discuss the details of my work.<eos> I appreciate that, particularly as I wish to engage your services.<eos> You know, I usually require a referral for a new client, but, uh, I might be able to make an exception.<eos> So... Legate works for you.
Aram, check that local PD has shut down the roads - 10 miles in every direction.<eos> - On it. And that Hazmat team we sent earlier,<eos> - they should be there any minute.<eos> - No, Hazmat's already transported her. - What are you talking about?<eos> - The Hazmat team.<eos> The Hazmat team is already en route.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We have gone through quite a lot of trouble to find you, young lady.<eos> You're the most valuable asset in our portfolio.<eos> Fortunately, the FBI was kind enough to lend an assist and lead us straight to you.
- I don't want your money.<eos> - Why not? You were right. We do the same thing.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I-I know.<eos> You put your life on the line.<eos> - What you do...<eos> - No, I'm sure you deserve more.<eos> It's just I have this... this student loan and this online poker debt...<eos> What you did, no one else would do for me.<eos> I'd do anything for you.
But what I do know is that this family's the most important thing in my life.<eos> I don't wanna lose it.<eos> We just arrested a woman who... would've done anything to stay with the person she loved, but... she lost him anyway.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> From the beginning, we've been fighting secrets and... agendas and... psychotic homicidal killers coming between us.<eos> And for the first time, we're together, and we've got no one to fight.<eos> But it still feels...<eos> Like we're coming apart?<eos> I know this family is the most important thing to you. But it's not gonna work if you can't be who you are.
Like we're coming apart?<eos> I know this family is the most important thing to you. But it's not gonna work if you can't be who you are.<eos> - I guess I'm just scared.<eos> - Of what?<eos> I'm not gonna love that person.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then you love that person.<eos> Because that's who I am.<eos> I understand that the work we do depends on you. So I'm going to allow this, but understand this...
Your skin is so amazing.<eos> It's like... porcelain... but not toilet porcelain.<eos> Tea cup porcelain.<eos> I love your voice.<eos> It is so soothing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes I just listen to myself and I'm soothed.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - What?<eos> I was just hit by an intense wave of love for you.
but not much else.<eos> But this...<eos> This...<eos> This is important to me.<eos> And I guess it's kind of hitting me right now as I'm talking in my soothing voice.<eos> Two years into my fifth time getting sober,<eos> I finally get it.<eos> I want to be here.<eos> And for that, I need to thank you.<eos> And you and you and you and you and June.
And that was it?<eos> You didn't beat yourself up?<eos> What for?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I did try to make amends to the waitress, but she was so shook up, she jumped ship in Cancun.<eos> What if I wake up tomorrow and I want to use?<eos> Then you call me, you go to your meetings, you do what you've been doing for the past three years.<eos> I'm still so sad that this happened.<eos> Well that's a good thing.<eos> It shows how much your sobriety means to you.
Suzanne.<eos> Have I met her?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You sat next to her at Jill's birthday party.<eos> I did?<eos> Honey, I'm worried about you.<eos> She's vegan, does driftwood art.<eos> You said she smelled funny.<eos> I really don't remember.<eos> Oh, that's sad, 'cause she always asks about you.
You should get her this necklace.<eos> By tomorrow.<eos> It's kind of pricey.<eos> I think I'm gonna stick with the flowers.<eos> I thought you loved her, but okay.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Uh, no, I'm good.<eos> You sure?<eos> 70% of all Americans are dehydrated; they don't even know it.<eos> That settles it, I'm getting you some water.
It's clear he has the motivation to kill the poachers, but what about the stabbings?<eos> And why start now?<eos> He could be having some kind of temporary psychotic break.<eos> I mean, he's organized and controlled during the day and then chaotic at night.<eos> Plus, he's mission-oriented when he kills the hunters, so you would think he would feel satisfied afterwards, but no, he becomes destabilized.<eos> What if it's the killing that's destabilizing him and locking something worse inside of him?<eos> Dr. Jekyll turns into Mr. Hyde when the sun goes down.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're here checking out your boy Reid, shaking me down to make sure he's ok.<eos> No, I'm here for you, Calvin.
See what I brought you?<eos> Slippers.<eos> Floors can be chilly.<eos> You'll be up and about soon.<eos> You turned my daughter against me.<eos> We treated you with synthetic, platelet-derived growth factor.<eos> Wound healing.<eos> I'm not dead.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I need you.
We heard it though.<eos> It sounded scary.<eos> Mud saved us.<eos> She says it's a bear;<eos> I think it's an ogre.<eos> Umm, what's the scientific name for ogre? Ogre...<eos> "Ogre-us not-real-icus"?<eos> I don't know, it looks pretty human.<eos> OK, I have a theory.<eos> This bullshit story about a bear in the woods, you made it up, right?
Go sit down!<eos> You're being impatient.<eos> Come on...<eos> I really look like my mom there.<eos> Yeah, you do look like your mom.<eos> Been reminding me of her all day - stomping around,<eos> - I'm trying - to help her. - What do you mean by that?<eos> Hey?<eos> She's... acting dumb, and she gets mad at me for going to visit Rachel. But she shows me things, like about why I'm special.<eos> Darling, you know that even if Rachel's being nice to you, we can't trust her?
I hate fondue.<eos> I can't give Kira what she wants.<eos> She's cutting herself for answers I don't have.<eos> I cut myself since I was small, but I stopped when I found peace and my sestras accepted me.<eos> She's an old soul.<eos> You should share our horrors with her.<eos> God, I don't want her dealing with what we do.<eos> But she will have to.<eos> You know this.<eos> I wasn't a good sister to you.
- Where was he?<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about. Mud!<eos> I know he's out there!<eos> Is she alright, love?<eos> Yeah, she's alright.<eos> Dr. Perkins.<eos> I mean it's not rocket science!<eos> Your problems with your daughter trace back to your relationship with your own mother!<eos> That's not bad.<eos> I've got a shirt for you in the truck.
That's from her.<eos> Psychopath!<eos> The Castor soldiers and the women that they infected...<eos> Yeah, but she's going to tell us about P.T. Westmorland, aren't you, Virginia?<eos> Well, well.<eos> Haven't you come far.<eos> How things must have changed while she kept me in here drooling on myself.<eos> Who?<eos> Get me out. Then we'll talk.<eos> You don't get to decide.
- You need to leave right now! - What is this place?<eos> Is this where he lives?<eos> What did they do to him, Mud?<eos> Tell me!<eos> What did they do to him?<eos> - You need to go, OK? - Just tell me!<eos> - He can't find you here.<eos> - Mud?<eos> - You need to go!<eos> - I need you up here!
- What?<eos> We're on a whole new level with Westmorland.<eos> We have to trust S now more than ever.<eos> So what am I meant to do in Switzerland, then? Hmm?<eos> I need to be here for Kira, and I have an art opening in three weeks.<eos> The boys have been digging.<eos> There are at least six different subsidiaries of Neolution registered in Switzerland.<eos> So we start there.<eos> - Follow the money.<eos> - Adele needs you.
You overvalue ruthlessness, P.T. You always have.<eos> Rachel is too damaged for this responsibility.<eos> She's done pretty well so far.<eos> She tried to kill me.<eos> I didn't intend for her to go that far.<eos> - I'm sorry, Susan.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> Your corporate-raised psychopath is finally paying dividends.<eos> But admit it: scientifically, you're lost without me.<eos> That's why I need you, Susan.
- Yup.<eos> - Yes. And Helena is Shark.<eos> Shark, that's good.<eos> Great name.<eos> What about Rachel?<eos> Rachel... is Elephant.<eos> And here's her cane.<eos> Why is she Elephant?<eos> Elephants are scared of mice.<eos> She's scared of you, mouse?
You heard P.T. mention our modern-day Eve.<eos> Here she is.<eos> Why do I have to stay here another night?<eos> To monitor your sleep.<eos> The needles hurt too much to sleep.<eos> We're nearly done with that.<eos> And then I can go home?<eos> Yes, of course, you can.<eos> Come along.<eos> Um, I have a present for you.
On whose behalf are you arguing now?<eos> Your transport has been arranged.<eos> You know best.<eos> Who is that?<eos> Virginia's guest.<eos> Unlock his cuffs and leave us.<eos> Is all this really necessary?<eos> I thought we had an agreement.<eos> You're a traitor, Mark.<eos> You're lucky we need you.
Is that the end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't think that's the end.<eos> I think when you get here we'll... We'll write the end of that, yeah?<eos> We'll work on it together.<eos> Okay.<eos> Say goodbye now, Kira.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I love you, more than anything.<eos> I've never been so proud of you.
Okay. I'm inside the cervix, separating the membranes...<eos> You sure you have to do this?<eos> A natural inducing technique.<eos> Thirty-five weeks is nearly full-term for twins.<eos> We need to get this done in a hurry.<eos> There are too many people looking for us.<eos> - What about Gracie?<eos> - Be patient, Mark.<eos> After the birth, she'll join us.<eos> Until then, I need you on security.
- Be patient, Mark.<eos> After the birth, she'll join us.<eos> Until then, I need you on security.<eos> - Mark...<eos> - Relax, Helena.<eos> Mark...<eos> Mark...<eos> My dear child, so this is where I finally find you.<eos> I've been searching for so long.<eos> My name is Tomas, and I'm going to take care of you.
Now, sit your ass down.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> I don't know what you know...<eos> You could be a Neolution yourself.<eos> But I have to gamble that you're still police, like me, and like Beth was.<eos> We've done all we can naturally.<eos> It's just of matter of time.<eos> No dilation from the membrane sweep?<eos> As soon as it happens, we're ready.<eos> - Hmm. - We'll harvest foetal stem cells and begin processing a treatment for you immediately.
Get your hands in the air!<eos> Now!<eos> I have broken no laws, Detective.<eos> Sit your ass back down in that chair.<eos> And I have a permit for this gun.<eos> Don't test me.<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Oh, this can't fall on you.
Goodbye, Mark.<eos> Contraction.<eos> First one.<eos> Get this off her, she needs to breathe.<eos> Inhale through your nose. Exhale through your mouth.<eos> Breathe, Helena. Breathe.<eos> There you go.<eos> Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Look at you.
Wake up.<eos> Meathead, come on!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Hey... hey. I'm here.<eos> I'm here, hey. She's awake, Coady.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> - Heart rate is steady.<eos> That's good.<eos> Thanks to you, we're still in business.
That you and the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the new world after they cut out her tongue.<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> I don't blame you after what my father did to you.<eos> He is dead.<eos> These are miracle babies.<eos> I'm sorry I came.<eos> I'll go.<eos> You still have family.<eos> You see?<eos> They remember you.
I'm going Southern Regional.<eos> We can catch up. Great.<eos> See you both at the opening.<eos> Where are you off to?<eos> I'm just, uh, going to get some flowers.<eos> - Mum!<eos> - Chicken...<eos> You're a worrier, and I've told you everything I know.<eos> And you're right.<eos> We can't stand down yet, but that's exactly why I need you at the opening.
- Go, go!<eos> I love you. - I love you.<eos> - Felix, are we clear?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, come on.<eos> Felix! Felix!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - My God, hello!<eos> - Congratulations!<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> Look at you!
I am dressed.<eos> I'm just thinking that S and Delphine are up to something, right?<eos> Your mom is at the florist, hon.<eos> She's thinking about your brother.<eos> Are you?<eos> S said last week that she's got some other source, so I'm trying to figure out...<eos> Do you have any idea how hard your brother's been working for tonight?<eos> Yeah, my brother's got a problem with me, he'll tell me.<eos> Well, why don't I tell you my problem?<eos> The entire time that we were gone, he was painting you, different versions of you.
- Incoming.<eos> - What the hell, S?<eos> I'm sorry, love.<eos> I saw a window.<eos> You've worked with MK's murderer.<eos> I knew you couldn't stomach it.<eos> He was the key to Rachel.<eos> Hey, hey. - Hey, Felix.<eos> Hey, what the hell's going on?<eos> These are for you.
- Felix. She chose us as her own.<eos> We are who we are because she carried two little London urchins on her wings to Canada.<eos> Watching her raise my sister, watching my sister raise her own daughter,<eos> finding my biological sister, it's quite mad.<eos> It's taught me that we are all mysterious works of chance,<eos> of choice, of nature versus nurture.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So to my galaxy of women. Thank you for the nurture.<eos> - I'm proud of you.
That was a death trap. That meeting.<eos> You expected them to kill me.<eos> I told you what I wanted.<eos> You chose not to listen.<eos> What, we just ride off into the sunset when everything we have ever wanted was at our fingertips?<eos> You expected me to take a payoff.<eos> That is how we win!<eos> No, we win if Neolution is exposed and Westmorland is stripped of his myth!<eos> Where's your smoking gun, Rachel?<eos> There's nothing for you here.
Welcome home.<eos> Were you really gonna shoot me coming in my own door?<eos> - In the leg.<eos> - So you do wanna talk.<eos> No. I just wanna put holes in you with this .45.<eos> Bigger than holes you can put in me with that 9mm.<eos> Won't make much of a difference in the throat, love.<eos> Or we put them down?<eos> What have you done with my future?<eos> She just wasn't that into you.
Is it true about the courier?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry, Raymond.<eos> Stratos, we have to take the bitter with the sweet.<eos> Unfortunately, it's not just one courier.<eos> People are talking about other setbacks.<eos> I have a lead on three cargo ships in Marseilles.<eos> If they are as advertised, we should purchase them.<eos> Your travel itinerary.<eos> I've booked a room for you and Corina at la Maison de Mon ami.
I gotta hang up. Stratos.<eos> - I'll call you right back.<eos> Yes!<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> Corina, what are you...<eos> You are drunk!<eos> What the... - How dare you.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> Talked about what?<eos> You.
It's nice to meet you, Jeremy.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Brah!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> With the fruit basket.<eos> You sprung for the suite.<eos> Happy Valentine's.<eos> Happy Valentine's to you.
Look at us. We got baller suites, killer views.<eos> We're drinking beer at 10:00 in the morning.<eos> It's awesome. First of all, don't say "baller" ever again in your life.<eos> Why? Just trust me.<eos> That's why.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Okay? That's number one.<eos> Number two, I am, supposed to be romantic this weekend with her.<eos> You're-you're aware of that, right? So what's the problem?<eos> The problem is that you are here, and I do not need you judging me.
Shut up, please, okay?<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Just relax. What do you mean, going I-in?<eos> Where, what's, where... In where?<eos> 1204.<eos> I got it.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No. No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna go with or without you.
Throw these away, though, right?<eos> -Those are prescription!<eos> -[Artie] Smart.<eos> Frames is where they get you.<eos> Don't you remember how things used to be before Kimmy?<eos> We screamed at each other two to three hours a day, and you never had a nice boyfriend, and you never had a good job, and people thought you were autistic 'cause you wore those New Year's glasses everywhere.<eos> I chose to hear "artistic."<eos> If Kimmy was here right now, she would tell you to beg Kimmy to come back.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, what would she say to you?
If Kimmy was here right now, she would tell you to beg Kimmy to come back.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, what would she say to you?<eos> She'd say I shouldn't screw things up with Artie just because I'm afraid I'm not as good as his dead wife, and she'd tell me I'm perfect the way I am.<eos> And I would believe her because that sweet dummy, if she loves us, there must be something good about us.<eos> Ah, damn it all to hell.<eos> Now I have to take Artie upstairs and bang him.<eos> He's probably gonna cry after, which'll just set the cats off again.<eos> You got to admit... she makes us both better people.<eos> I mean, look at you. Two months without her, you poisoned a Grammy winner.
♪ Get in the boat, we'll find dry land ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause we're stronger than this storm ♪<eos> You can totally stay here.<eos> We'll just tell them you're our Emotional Support Human.<eos> Does that mean I can go into restaurants with you?<eos> [Kimmy] What?<eos> Oh, great, it's you!<eos> I used too big a rock!<eos> And also, it took me a while to find the right window.<eos> But I need you, Kimmy.
You can totally stay here.<eos> We'll just tell them you're our Emotional Support Human.<eos> Does that mean I can go into restaurants with you?<eos> [Kimmy] What?<eos> Oh, great, it's you!<eos> I used too big a rock!<eos> And also, it took me a while to find the right window.<eos> But I need you, Kimmy.<eos> Yeah, to rub your feet and wash your cereal bowls and go refill your MetroCard when you "literally can't right now."<eos> No. I need you 'cause you're my conscience.
Texting him, lying about it, and then she kissed him.<eos> And she's suffering for it.<eos> Obviously you are, too.<eos> A grown man buying SpaghettiOs...<eos> That just screams lonely.<eos> I like SpaghettiOs.<eos> Plus, the beef stew's on the top shelf.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I'll leave you with this.<eos> There's a very tall, very sad woman who would love nothing more than to reach up and get you that beef stew, and... fill your life with sporadic moments of happiness.
Hi, Christy, alcoholic.<eos> Hi, Christy.<eos> So my mom isn't gonna be here tonight.<eos> Yes!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry, I don't have any beer.<eos> I can offer you water, unless you want some expired chocolate milk that might have a little kick to it.<eos> Water's fine.<eos> So this is a nice surprise.<eos> Well, I've been thinking about you, and I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd take a shot you were alone.
What's going on?<eos> Adam, things are not good with us.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Last night was great.<eos> Last night was super weird until we had sex, and then tonight you blew me off for this?<eos> It's ten cent wing night.<eos> Just admit it.<eos> You're still angry at me.<eos> Okay, maybe you're right.<eos> I don't want to be, but every time I look at you, I think of you with that other guy and it hurts.
I guess call me when you're less mad.<eos> But until then, I don't think we should see each other anymore.<eos> Oh, that's just wrong!<eos> So I'll see you?<eos> I hope.<eos> What you got today, Walter?<eos> Tofurky.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Hit me.<eos> Oh. Got to learn to trust you.
And yet you always want it.<eos> Sad, but true.<eos> Anyway, I made a really good impression on my Admissions Liaison Officer, who helped me through the process.<eos> And remember the congresswoman who nominated me for West Point?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> She was just as happy to nominate me for the Air Force Academy.<eos> So, even a Democrat could see how good you are.<eos> You really got into the Air Force Academy?<eos> I really did.<eos> I am... I'm so proud of you.
My interest was piqued.<eos> I don't see what the big deal is.<eos> Of course you don't see what the big deal is, because you're not the one who has an issue-<eos> And by the way, I'd never seen this guy use a pen in seven years.<eos> He uses crayons.<eos> Like, uh, like, uh, like a little kid. Little kid.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Says the one throwing a temper tantrum.<eos> Maybe you should take a time-out.<eos> I'll take a time-out if it gets me out of here, gets me away from you, I'll take a time-out.
Why did I agree to this?<eos> It's like you said, there's no roads in or out of here.<eos> This is so dumb.<eos> This is dumb!<eos> Just relax, all right?<eos> You're gonna be fine, you're gonna be fine.<eos> When this light goes green, we're gonna jump, okay?<eos> No, I-I don't want-- You know what?<eos> I don't want to do it, 'cause if I die,<eos> I don't want to be strapped to you like an infant.
You've known me for seven years now.<eos> What do you think? Okay.<eos> Okay, hey, hey, hey, okay, listen.<eos> Stop for one second.<eos> You want to know?<eos> Yeah. Okay, I'll tell you.<eos> That was a list of things that I'd like to do when I retire, okay?<eos> You happy now? I said it.<eos> Now we can continue.<eos> After you, please.
After you, please.<eos> I'm sorry, excuse me. Retire?<eos> That's what I said, when I retire.<eos> I'm coming up on 20 years. Okay?<eos> I'm gonna pension out very soon.<eos> I got to think about what comes next.<eos> You're serious right now?<eos> I'm absolutely serious.<eos> No, I want to do this for the rest of my life with you.<eos> Unlike you, I don't want to do this.
Don't sl... slam it.<eos> It's too deep.<eos> All right, uh...<eos> we don't have a lot of time.<eos> Maybe, maybe we find another place to cross, huh?<eos> We're gonna use, we're gonna use the boards on the back of the truck and we're gonna build a bridge.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you, do you take into account that I'm here, too?<eos> Do I have a say in anything we do? Or you just make decisions all by yourself?<eos> Oh, that's rich coming from you.
What do I mean by that? You didn't feel the need to include me in your decision to retire.<eos> It's my retirement.<eos> Why would I include you in something like that?<eos> It's got nothing to do with you.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe...<eos> Easy. ...because it's a big decision that affects me, too.<eos> Did you think about that?<eos> Huh? I mean, you want to talk about trust.<eos> Well, I... trust you to bring me in on big decisions like that.
Come on.<eos> Conversion between... the reciprocating and rotational motion?<eos> The crankshaft.<eos> Attagirl.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Okay, Ada.<eos> Okay, fresh clothes, air mattress, cell phone, books and a laptop.<eos> All purified with an ozone sterilizer.<eos> No ethylene oxide for you.
He made me.<eos> I... I need my job, Cabe.<eos> I know.<eos> I get it, but...<eos> But what?<eos> All these kids, they're my kids.<eos> And they may be brilliant, but they learn from me, too.<eos> And I can't get them to understand a concept like loyalty if I'm spending time with someone who went after one of the team.<eos> Even if I did it unwillingly?<eos> I like you, Allie.

You ready?<eos> My dad just gave me the VR headset, totally purified.<eos> Thank you for doing this.<eos> Toby, she's ready.<eos> Get it in gear.<eos> Uno momento.<eos> Can I talk to Ada for a moment?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Ada?<eos> Um, I've been brain-storming preliminary code and I believe that I can create an algorithm to compress worldwide genetic data in such a manner that even if there is only one bone marrow match out there for you, I will find it.
Wow, you're seriously gonna try to identify Happy's pathology from a two-page questionnaire?<eos> Tobias, it's not Miss Quinn's pathology I'm identifying. It's yours.<eos> Mine?<eos> Sweet. Your fault.<eos> You refuse to see any of Miss Quinn's flaws.<eos> He's right. You do.<eos> You think I'm really great.<eos> And that's bad?<eos> Happy can't open up, bare her soul, if she feels she won't be given an honest assessment of her true self.<eos> Why share her intimate thoughts and feelings if all she gets back from you is surface-level pabulum?
Let's us see what that is.<eos> I'm about to test my Sandwich Plane-Tiling Hypothesis!<eos> I can't miss this.<eos> All my life, I have been trying to solve "square bread versus round tomato."<eos> How to get total bread coverage without overlapping the tomato slices, which has been impossible because circles on a square in the Euclidean plane have a maximum packing density of .9069.<eos> So, the solution was to think outside of the box by growing my tomatoes inside a box.<eos> Think you have too much time on your hands now that the election's over. Quiet.<eos> This is important.<eos> Says the inventor of the world's stupidest hot dog. Wow.<eos> Everything is stupid to you today.
You saved my life.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> Monkey.<eos> I have a legitimate phobia of the primate we call Macaca fascicularis.<eos> Your phobia is a load of Macaca.<eos> I am terrified of monkeys.<eos> I nearly blew everything in Djbouti last year because of one of those furry vine swingers.<eos> I can't go.<eos> I'm gonna freak out and put the entire mission at risk.<eos> Well, you are in luck, ya big baby, because we actually need you here.
- You?<eos> - No. Toby.<eos> I know the letters in the word "lacrosse."<eos> Quiet.<eos> Toss it just behind him.<eos> He'll think the nest fell from the tree.<eos> Okay, you and Thiago... You stay back and look out in case the guards come back.<eos> Approach... slowly.<eos> Easy, monkey.<eos> We just want to perform some scientific tests on you. Okay.
Virus is only contagious before symptoms present.<eos> We could have missed the window, or we could infected now.<eos> It's too soon to tell.<eos> Let's get the little bastard out of the tree already.<eos> Well, someone just has to rub these flowers all over themselves and attract the little scamp down here.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.<eos> I already tangled with Furious George in the tent.<eos> You touched the flowers.<eos> If more than one of us smell like muira puama, it'll get confused.<eos> Besides, he could easily be attracted to you.
Not good.<eos> His, uh, friend was killed two weeks ago Right in front of him.<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> So why haven't you been to visit him?<eos> Because I'm no good to him.<eos> I even drove out there and couldn't go in.<eos> Knowing I can't get him out drives me insane.<eos> I know. I know. You're right.<eos> Walker doesn't think he's slept in a while, and...<eos> He asked for you.
B block can use the cafeteria.<eos> B block line up for chow.<eos> Line up for chow.<eos> This is the day you're supposed to move Frazier's stuff, isn't it? Yeah.<eos> Luckily it sounds like the guards are gonna shut it down.<eos> Look, I know it's hard to think outside the box when you're in a box, But think about the moves.<eos> Cell Block b's a patsy.<eos> Look, everyone's looking over there So you can push the stuff through here. Maybe.<eos> Or maybe I just won't do it, Since you're protecting me.<eos> Do you know why they killed Delgado instead of you?
You get every other weekend and that's it.<eos> How many times has she done this?<eos> A few. I don't know.<eos> I didn't count, Liz.<eos> How many times, Bob?<eos> Two. Two times a week.<eos> What?<eos> We were gonna tell you. Ok?<eos> I knew you'd be mad.<eos> She knew you'd be mad, too, and look at you.
I'll survive.<eos> Besides, they don't really need me now That you put malcolm in there.<eos> What?<eos> I...<eos> I put him in there?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I think you're the one that pulls the strings in here.<eos> You decide when to help, and you decide when to look away, and you have a lot of friends,<eos> And they're afraid of you, So they play your little game.
- I mean, what is the problem?<eos> The kid's got an odd fashion sense.<eos> What's wrong with my fashion senses?<eos> Oh, hey, buddy.<eos> Uh... nothing.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> I think you look very handsome.<eos> Uh, you want to go play in the other room?<eos> So you can keep talking about me?<eos> Okay. So I can keep talking about you.
What's her last name?<eos> - Gonzalez?<eos> - Perez.<eos> - Maldanado. - That's a tough start, guys.<eos> You have lived with Alba your entire lives, and you don't know her full name?<eos> Alba is a rich fountain of culture.<eos> - You know what, Alba?<eos> - Hmm? Tomorrow, me and you...<eos> we're going out.<eos> On me. And I want to know every single thing about you, because you are my new friend.
- Okay, look, I'm not trying to pass any judgments here, all right?<eos> Anything anyone wants to do or wear, I'm cool with.<eos> Well, would you listen to that!<eos> Gene here is cool with the rest of the world having free will.<eos> Thank you, Gene.<eos> - I didn't mean it like that.<eos> - No? No. I'm just looking after my daughter's safety.<eos> I mean, come on, it's common sense, all right?<eos> That's why we have a boys' room and a girls' room.<eos> I got news for you, friend.
Suing is how rich white people solve their problems.<eos> Yeah, but you don't have to actually sue them.<eos> You could just threaten to sue them.<eos> I do love threatening.<eos> Hey, Sabrina, I'm so happy you wanted to come back here.<eos> Yeah, well, these ribs are delicious.<eos> And...<eos> I wanted to sing and show you there was nothing to be afraid of.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, I'm so nervous for you.
Kai, what are your dreams?<eos> Well, you are, babe.<eos> I got everything I need right here in this sauna.<eos> Maybe you should start figuring it out so that people don't think that you're a loser.<eos> People think I'm a loser?<eos> No. No.<eos> They don't now.<eos> But they might think that soon. You know?<eos> So maybe it's a good time to just start thinking about it.<eos> - Yeah. - For you, anything.
Will you just get to the point? Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> First things first.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Okay. Your turn, do me.<eos> And don't give me one of your sissy taps, either, okay?<eos> I need you to muster up all the strength you can in that tiny, pale, bony body of yours.<eos> I will ruin you when we get home.<eos> Now give me your wallet.<eos> No way, I don't trust you.
Hey. Whatcha doing?<eos> Oh, hey, babe.<eos> I'm just getting ready to go to a meeting.<eos> You're going to a meeting dressed like that?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Ah, I got so excited, I totally forgot to tell you.<eos> - What? - I'm starting my own business.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Yeah. Babe, that's so great.<eos> I'm really happy for you. Yeah.
- You are like a can of tuna fish... - Uh-huh. - ...that has far exceeded...<eos> ...its expiration date. - I don't get that.<eos> - No, it's good, good.<eos> - Yeah, she smells.<eos> - Okay. What are you doing on my laptop?<eos> Oh, man, we are feeding these cyberbully dicks with both barrels.<eos> - What? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Let me see. You're on my account.<eos> Of course I'm on your account.<eos> How else would I be you?
- It's a journal.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Everybody used to fear and respect me.<eos> Now they think I'm some sad sack of emotion.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Hey, don't say that.<eos> I'm sure they still fear you.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know that time you told me my voice sounded fat?<eos> Yeah, that was a good one.<eos> That was a great one.<eos> It's like you've got butter in your throat.<eos> Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me.<eos> I can't wrap my mind around what that even means, but that's the point, I've been thinking about it ever since.<eos> See, you got in my head.<eos> That's the bitch that's inside of you.
I just can't see inside my own mouth.<eos> Okay. You know what?<eos> You do it.<eos> No way. I'm not getting anywhere near that thing.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Yeah, it's probably better.<eos> This red-headed gumdrop will bungle it anyway.<eos> Give me the... give me the pliers.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> There we go. There's hope for you yet.
Here's your journal.<eos> That's okay, Zoe.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I had a lot of time to think in there, and I'm not mad at you.<eos> - You're not?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, my... Of course not.<eos> It would be such a silly waste of time for someone like me to be mad at someone as insignificant as you.<eos> The truth is...<eos> I pity you.
We can't use it.<eos> The Spear...<eos> It draws on our desires, our weaknesses, our hatred.<eos> Our darkness.<eos> We're not strong enough to wield it.<eos> The spear is a weapon.<eos> And you know what we do with weapons.<eos> Doing some light reading on Zembezi, I see.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I came here to drop some future knowledge on you.
Do it.<eos> Death would be too kind.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Where's the Spear?<eos> You took it to the rendezvous point.<eos> Oh, did I?<eos> Right.<eos> If you don't wanna get stuck in 1916, get to the ship now.<eos> That means you, Amaya.
Aw, he jinxed it!<eos> I hate that guy.<eos> Not that guy.<eos> These guys!<eos> You travelled back in time to help yourselves, I figured I could do the same.<eos> You know, it's true what they say.<eos> If you want something done right, you really have to do it yourself.<eos> Give me the Spear and I'll spare your team.<eos> You can go to hell.<eos> No, but I'll make a hell for you.
K'i-aheen.<eos> Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.<eos> It can't be me.<eos> Use it.<eos> Fix the world.<eos> - Just do it, Sara!<eos> - Look, I can't.<eos> There's too much darkness inside of me.<eos> I can't control it.<eos> I believe in you.
I'm damaged.<eos> I know.<eos> The Gambit, Lian Yu, League of Assassins, you dying.<eos> I could take it all back.<eos> But you won't.<eos> Everything... that has happened to me...<eos> All the suffering that I endured, it's all led to this moment, hasn't it?<eos> The Spear doesn't need someone pure of heart.<eos> It needs someone strong enough to do the right thing.<eos> Sara, it needs you.
It was a boating accident.<eos> Looks like an actual accident.<eos> Call HIDTA.<eos> Run a deconfliction report on Curt Framingham and on Metro Gold Capital.<eos> Let's see if the Feds are into this guy.<eos> I got a guy at the Fed who gets me whatever I want to know.<eos> You want me to call him?<eos> We're good.<eos> Someone want to fill me in on the office gossip?<eos> Um... your gang unit pulled indictments for everyone but you, so... why don't you tell us how you worked that out?
Get up.<eos> We're booking you for murder.<eos> Get up.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey.<eos> April from Med... test came back negative for hepatitis.<eos> Only insulin found on the needle.<eos> Now, they still got to do the blood drop on Marvin, but the VA reports from last week showed that hepatitis was his only communicable disease, so... you're in the clear.<eos> My gosh.<eos> Look at you.

It's over.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen...<eos> I kind of ran from Intelligence.<eos> I'll admit I wasn't ready to work side-by-side with you.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> It's like my family up there.<eos> I'd really like to come back.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Is that okay with you?
And what's his mother?<eos> We need you on this trip.<eos> You're our chosen historian.<eos> You always have been.<eos> - Go to hell.<eos> - Lucy! I know we're asking the unthinkable.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> You have such a good heart, and I admire that.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm proud of you.
Rufus, these guys are everywhere.<eos> Jiya, we can't let them have the time machine, all right?<eos> I'm so sorry for putting you on the spot.<eos> The last thing I ever wanted was for you to become a double agent... believe me.<eos> I know how hard it is.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'll explain everything to you, I swear.<eos> But you have to do this.<eos> We need you.

That sounds like a great idea.<eos> See you later.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I meant, like... like, both of us.<eos> Didn't you hear him?<eos> I'm all healed.<eos> I don't need a service dog anymore.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying I'm done with you.
Now, to take an old man pee.<eos> Oh, Brian, just in time for dinner.<eos> We're having sloppy Joes.<eos> Eh, what else you got?<eos> How about a knuckle sandwich?<eos> If Peter said that, you all would've lost your minds laughing.<eos> It's just that at Carter's house, if you don't want something heavy, Étienne will whip you up an egg dish with some shallots and chanterelles or whatever's fresh.<eos> Yeah, I know all about Étienne.<eos> He climbed into my bed when I was 11.<eos> I'm sure this is a step down for you, Bri, but now you're back in the real world where our poop stinks, and we all eat garbage.
And now for the confusing commercial backstory.<eos> Ready for the fund-raiser, Dad?<eos> Yeah, be right there, buddy.<eos> We're going to a fund-raiser, and we share a bedroom.<eos> Mr. Pewterschmidt, you have a visitor.<eos> Hey, buddy, looking good!<eos> So, what are we drinking?<eos> Or better yet, why aren't we drinking?<eos> Get the hell out of here!<eos> I told you I'm done with you!
But he should be.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Come on, it'd be temporary, just until he realizes I'm a great hang.<eos> But you're not, so I don't want any part of this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it. I get it.<eos> Nah, you-you wouldn't want to help me.<eos> What was I thinking? He...<eos> he's your grandfather.<eos> Even though he did say that thing about you.
But they have an opening!<eos> Zayn is gone!<eos> He does know Zayn is gone, right?<eos> Oh, he definitely knows.<eos> Yeah, he-he thinks you could be in O-Town, but not One Direction.<eos> Okay, I'm pretty sure you're manipulating me, but let's go blind that old bastard.<eos> Listen, Peter, we know you've been working hard on the violin, but more importantly, you're our pal, and we'd like you to be back in the group.<eos> Really?<eos> What if I'm not good enough?<eos> Well, that's the thing. We decided we'd rather be lousy with you than great without you.
Tom.<eos> Come on.<eos> She lies, and the consequence is front-row seats?<eos> She deserves to have a childhood.<eos> She deserves to be ready for adulthood.<eos> The hours I work, never getting to see her...<eos> I don't want to be the bad guy.<eos> Which makes it my job?<eos> You get to be Cool Dad?<eos> She has a wild soul, like you, and I don't ever want her to lose that.
But I want you to visit me again, all right, Ruby Tuesday?<eos> Goodbye, Uncle Nico.<eos> Potatoes...<eos> Fried!<eos> I killed her!<eos> Who did he say was responsible for Susanna's death?<eos> What did your brother say when you saw him with the body?<eos> Mr. Jackson?<eos> ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
I remember the skull on her T-shirt in this club in the Richmond, uh, Park something...<eos> No, Parade.<eos> Uh... something that begins with a "P."<eos> I was there from, like, 11:00 to midnight.<eos> Is it the place?<eos> How do you pick them? What's your pattern?<eos> _<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I know how much he meant to you.
There's a midnight vigil at his house.<eos> I want to g-go with Ruby.<eos> Let me talk to Dad, okay? That's what you always say when it's no.<eos> Why can't I go?<eos> ! Because midnight is too late.<eos> And Ruby... she's much older than you.<eos> I understand this is hard.<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> You're the worst mom in the world!<eos> You didn't even fix the camera yet, and if you hate Ruby, I hate you!
Then don't come in here.<eos> They should go to children who are gonna use them.<eos> You don't have the right to make that decision on your own.<eos> I can't do this the way you're doing it.<eos> Your way is better?<eos> Three months... grieving time's up?<eos> Time to act like she never existed?<eos> Is that what you think I'm doing?<eos> Oh! How dare you!<eos> Um... every time I look at you, I think...

And snooping on people's secrets.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you knew that stuff was out there.<eos> I feel terrible about what happened to you.<eos> Oh, so now you feel bad for me, like I'm that Muppet on Sesame Street whose dad is in jail.<eos> Is that why you were so nice about the garbage can?<eos> I- - Well, I mean, maybe that had something to do with it, but... [chicken clucking]<eos> They're allowed to stay up late.<eos> They're not chickens.<eos> I- - I really do like you.
Plus, you're afraid of a vacuum cleaner. You gave up halfway through a revolving door.<eos> When I brought you a bouquet, you ate it.<eos> I thought it was a Edible Arrangement.<eos> I don't have a lot of fruit experience.<eos> Also, you're weird for naming a baby Linda.<eos> Well, you live with a grown woman named Kimmy.<eos> But I did not name her that.<eos> Then maybe this is for the best.<eos> For both of us.<eos> Uh-uh, ain't nobody tracking what this says about you.
Previously on "once upon a time"...<eos> What you have is a gift. I wanted to use my magic to help someone for so long.<eos> You're still trying to fill the hole in your heart I created.<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> I'm not here to stop you.<eos> I'm here to do it for you.
It made good target practice, though.<eos> And so will you.<eos> Why don't you practice on my ax?<eos> Are you all right? Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, that was a first.<eos> Not a lot of people want to befriend the girl with magic.<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe I am a monster.<eos> You used your magic for good, and that doesn't make you a monster.
And so will you.<eos> Why don't you practice on my ax?<eos> Are you all right? Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, that was a first.<eos> Not a lot of people want to befriend the girl with magic.<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe I am a monster.<eos> You used your magic for good, and that doesn't make you a monster.<eos> It makes you special.
I came here because I heard you were wicked, and I thought we could help each other.<eos> Why would I help you?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> Look around.<eos> You're out here, living alone in the middle of nowhere.<eos> You look like you could use a friend, especially with the final battle approaching.<eos> I could be that friend.<eos> One wouldn't want to be alone for what's coming.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> Because I'm not afraid of you.
Isn't it obvious?<eos> I came to get you out of here before you get yourself killed.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Just get out of my way.<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> So... so now you care about my own good?<eos> You're not gonna blame me for something?<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that in all your sobbing over Robin's death and your broken heart, all you did was blame me.<eos> I sacrificed Hades for you, the man I loved, to save your life.
Well, that's not true.<eos> We can go back down there and get the crystals for ourselves.<eos> You really think it'll be that easy, after what we just went through?<eos> I think you've done enough for today.<eos> You really think this is all my fault?<eos> Think?<eos> If you didn't have to prove you were stronger than everyone else, she wouldn't be sitting on a magical nuke right now.<eos> So, let me fix it.<eos> And make things worse?<eos> If being the best is so important to you, zelena, why don't you go someplace where you can be on top?
I promise.<eos> Me, too.<eos> She's one of us.<eos> We'll protect her with our lives.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Weak.<eos> But you've never looked stronger.<eos> Zelena, I'm so sorry for everything.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
- That should have never happened if you hadn't have been meddling in things that don't concern you!<eos> I am sorry that I shot you in the leg.<eos> I am going to pay you back...<eos> - Come on, man. Come on. - ...for what you did to me.<eos> Don't!<eos> Don't!<eos> Stop smiling.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you liked my smile.<eos> - Yeah, well, you're creeping me out. - Aw. This really is personal to you, isn't it?
If Hetty hadn't sent Kensi to Afghanistan, none of this would've happened.<eos> But every time you guys interfered over there, you cost them money.<eos> And eventually, I guess, they decided to try to get rid of you in order to protect their operations.<eos> You couldn't have warned us?<eos> I didn't know who they were going after until I saw Hetty with Carl Brown.<eos> Swear to God.<eos> They didn't tell me everything.<eos> They didn't trust me.<eos> Does anyone?<eos> You know why I don't trust you, Sabatino?
Who picks the ring finger?<eos> Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> It's not like you think.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Joelle, I was trying to protect you.<eos> So was I.<eos> I really cared for you.
Or we're gonna have a problem.<eos> All right, get Omar Fry down here.<eos> Set up a fake hit that you can show Donald Clark.<eos> Get him on tape giving you the rest of the money.<eos> Listen, Hank, I think I got through to Clark.<eos> - I think he might back out of this thing.<eos> - Al.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Remember the Family Secrets sting?<eos> When I had to cover you in, what, two gallons of pigs blood over you because you were supposed to be stabbed to death?
You better update your records.<eos> I got out of the life a while ago.<eos> Yeah, but that life always follows you.<eos> You know that.<eos> That's gang retaliation.<eos> What we don't know is were you the target or were you the instigator, Jeremy?<eos> You never saw her like that because you ran as soon as you heard gunshots.<eos> You left that girl to die, didn't even call 911.<eos> Which, by the way, the medical examiner said probably would have saved her life.<eos> Who shot at you, Jeremy?

Put your stuff back in your locker.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Brother, you don't owe me.<eos> You don't owe me a thing.<eos> Look, my last gang team, we were tight for five years.<eos> And I thought that that's... that's where I belonged.<eos> And I lost that.<eos> I know how this feels.<eos> So as far as your desk is concerned, I was just holding it down for you.
My dad spotted a woman cowering with her baby, and, without thinking, he just ran forward to save them but he didn't see the landmine.<eos> How was work? Good!<eos> Mrs. Anderson got a new hip.<eos> Katie still tossing over Mr. Williams but Mr. Franklin's still hangging in there.<eos> He was a boxer when he was young.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> He's got a bit of fight left in him.<eos> Did you sleep alright?<eos> Like a baby.<eos> What would I do without you?
You're late!<eos> I was in the wrong lab.<eos> My timetable says room 22.<eos> Right.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Can you let your mother know, your clothes need ironing in this school.<eos> Okay, so you call that...<eos> Hello, Mum!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I've come to look after you.
Ah, you must be very proud.<eos> I get us a tea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tonk!<eos> Did I frighten you?<eos> No<eos> I'm Sam<eos> Do you want me to guess your's?<eos> It's Chrissy.<eos> What did it feel like this morning, when everyone was looking at you?
I'm going to keep him on a rolling detention, for now. but let's make sure this is a one-off.<eos> It will be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right. Same time tomorrow?<eos> Don't ever fight my battles for me again!<eos> I thought you'd be pleased, just trying to help<eos> Helping sounds like it's for the people but really, it's a selfish act.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> If you think about most human interactions, People only give to receive.<eos> Well, what if I said I liked you?

Do you want to go?<eos> You go first.<eos> It's all "Barbarian burners" for 60%.<eos> I'm an emperor now.<eos> Hi!<eos> You came.<eos> You must be Sam.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> I'm Mike, Oscar's dad.<eos> He's told me all about you.
Is it football?<eos> Well, didn't you know?<eos> Oscar, here, stands undefeated Junior League, under-16's chess champion for the last 3 consecutive years.<eos> Dad!<eos> What?<eos> Never missed a match, have we?<eos> Follows in his father's footsteps<eos> Sam dives, he's really good.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I bet your dad's really proud of you.
So neat, tidy.<eos> Are you saying I'm fastidious?<eos> Okay.<eos> Anal?<eos> Fastidious is fine.<eos> It's all so perfectly intact.<eos> That's the way I like to keep things.<eos> My mind, my smile, my body.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not gonna throw myself at you. I only do that once.
Don't worry.<eos> Your Wyatt's fine.<eos> And I take it Rufus has recovered too.<eos> I just wanted you to know when I destroy Rittenhouse tonight... and I will... that also includes your grandfather,<eos> Ethan Cahill, which means... honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen to you, but whatever it is, it's probably not good.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I thought you deserved the truth.<eos> So you told me.<eos> What do you want from me? My blessing?<eos> I don't want anything from you.
How do you know that?<eos> Okay, how much do you want?<eos> I've got about $50.<eos> We don't want any money.<eos> We need you to take us to the Rittenhouse summit.<eos> So you're the one always begging to time travel.<eos> How's it working out for you?<eos> Jiya, please.<eos> You know, since all this started, I have almost died... a lot.<eos> And every time, I think about you.
You're alone?<eos> I said I would be.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> It was in Ethan's files.<eos> It's the name of the person who put the order out to kill your family, and the men who carried it out.<eos> Go on one last trip, get your wife and your daughter back, and then surrender the Mothership, or destroy it...<eos> But this... it's over.<eos> Once I get my family back, I never want to see that machine again.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> This is for you.
Take it from me: you age surprisingly well.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> On your knees!<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> Hands behind your back! Hold it right there.<eos> - You followed me?<eos> - He's a terrorist, Lucy.<eos> - Just think about what he's done.<eos> - Think about what we've done.<eos> No! I trusted you, Lucy.
We're good-- [in cockney accent] Talk to your doctor, Guvna!<eos> [in normal voice] Okay, I get it, Ken, and I agree.<eos> The problem is the writing.<eos> I mean, where's the jingle?<eos> Oops! It's right here.<eos> [laughs] ♪ Urethrex makes you feel good ♪ ♪ 'Cause it reopens your peehole ♪<eos> [Ken] That's not what it does.<eos> -I have no bones.<eos> [Richard] Damn it, it's like that time a bear drowned in my pool.<eos> [sighs] Rule one: make them remember you.
It's actually Ricky Ann Sprinkles.<eos> And every storm is different.<eos> Exactly, just like snowflakes or Subway sandwich artists.<eos> Or bunkers.<eos> Maybe a bunker can be a good thing, a safe place.<eos> I've got a bunker to build.<eos> Well, you were a lot of help!<eos> What if that had been the guy from Golden Corral?<eos> All right, Titus, you got us.<eos> We based the Urethrex bladder on you.
BunCo--<eos> Okay, how do you do that?<eos> Talk about what happened in front of, like, all these people?<eos> Huh... So I guess there's two things I know more about than you.<eos> Talking about bunkers and my mom's phone number.<eos> I don't like it here.<eos> -[door opens] -[Russ] Honey! Look at my new door-opening strength.<eos> Like it's nothing!<eos> Who sent you a gift basket?<eos> Actually, it's for you from Andy Cohen at...
So that's philosophy?<eos> Rude.<eos> Yeah, if everyone donated all their organs, then everyone would be dead, and there'd just be, like, a pile of organs.<eos> I must not be explaining it right.<eos> Look, if a trolley--<eos> -What kind of trolley?<eos> -I don't know! Just learned this morning.<eos> Doesn't sound like you did.<eos> [laughs] Sick burn, Cyndee.<eos> I like you.
"Feel the learn."<eos> On the count of three, let's say what we want for dinner.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> -[Cyndee squeals] [both laugh]<eos> How does this look?<eos> After the Post story, I really feel like people are gonna expect a vest.<eos> What's going on here, Russ?<eos> Do you not like it?<eos> I was gonna wear it to the launch party for Skinnygirl baby formula this weekend.<eos> Look, I know, for you, this is a whole new world.
Artie's probably gonna propose.<eos> Meanwhile, I've been a saint all year!<eos> Some of the saints were flawed in real life.<eos> Look at Francis.<eos> I don't trust a man who spends that much time with birds.<eos> Wait, so you think this is gonna be a proposal?<eos> Well, he's gonna have to ask my parents first. At Greenwood Cemetery... [softly] Oh.<eos> ...where they work. But is that what I want?<eos> I thought I'd never get married again after Roland died.<eos> Was shot in the face by you, Lillian!

What? No!<eos> No, no!<eos> I'm sorry, but if you're gonna remember what it's like to be the underdog, I'm gonna have to pile some dogs on you.<eos> You said I would never have to see them again!<eos> -Russ.<eos> -There he is!<eos> No, don't hit me!<eos> [all laugh] What's happening?<eos> What? Can't a father hug his son?<eos> Ooh, I am so proud of you, going from dud to stud like this!
So she comes in on her own terms and invents this, dissociative psychobabble, whatever it is, and that paves the way for an insanity defense.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> We may not be buying this whole multiple personality act, but a jury might.<eos> No.<eos> I don't buy that. Because it's still, it's a huge risk.<eos> And if this risk didn't pay off, she would spend the rest of her life incarcerated in an asylum.<eos> No, no. I don't think that's the reason she came back.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think she wants something from us.<eos> I think she wants something from you, specifically.
She must have... she must have seen me on the hike.<eos> She must have been watching me.<eos> She must have seen me fall and cut myself.<eos> - Alicia.<eos> - Steve, why is she doing it? Why?<eos> If she wanted me dead, then why didn't she just have someone kill me?<eos> Because she's messing with you.<eos> She's trying to get in your head, and it's working. God.<eos> You have to stop letting her get in your head.<eos> We want to figure out what's going on and what she's up to? I need you on your game.
Well, I guess you never really know someone, do you?<eos> And who's gonna wear these dainty little things?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's not you.<eos> An asset I'm developing...<eos> a reporter from the Journal.<eos> The one who exposed Sean Gregory?<eos> Well, someone's got to find out how that happened.<eos> See you next time the world explodes.<eos> Since when does Ryan ski?<eos> Um, your ex-fiancé is most likely dating someone for the first time since you... a likely asset... and that is your headline?
She has to be connected to the AIC.<eos> Gun for hire, maybe?<eos> And if she had a partner, it has to be someone that she trusted.<eos> Pull up K.A.s. Maybe I could recognize him, too.<eos> Known associates.<eos> Good idea.<eos> I don't understand something, Raina.<eos> The government covered up everything that happened at the G20.<eos> They didn't release your name.<eos> Why are the AIC after you?
It's best if you stay.<eos> I want to talk to you alone.<eos> I'll be upstairs, and you'll be fine.<eos> - I'm glad you're safe.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now that you know I'm safe, you can leave.<eos> We haven't spoken for weeks, and that's all you have to say to me?<eos> There's nothing left to say.<eos> Look... all I wanted was to hear your voice. If something had happened to you...<eos> Something did happen to me, and I survived it without you.

My team needs to know what's happening with the vote.<eos> Your names check out on my end, though you can take Mullen off the list.<eos> Roarke finally okayed the money for a regional airport with his name on it.<eos> Now even God couldn't change him to a "no."<eos> Well, it's nice to see you in your element.<eos> Well, I'd rather be out of it with you.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> Grab me when you know more, okay?<eos> Did you know this was gonna happen?<eos> Am I just an asset you're working?
Owen, listen to me.<eos> Break Tony's restraints.<eos> Put your gun in his hand.<eos> I'll cover you.<eos> I got it.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Did what I give you help?<eos> - Oh, can't use it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Well, because I don't know if I can trust you.
Me help you?<eos> That's...<eos> What a smart man does who knows his limits... asks for the help he knows he needs.<eos> So... help me.<eos> Help me trust myself again.<eos> Help me be... who I was... instead of who I am right now.<eos> The finest Pinot grigio that your local supermarket sells. Mm.<eos> Funny. I pegged you as more of an Old World red kind of guy.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> Is the FBI right behind you?

I don't even know what that means.<eos> Is the FBI right behind you?<eos> Well, if they are, they're after me, not you.<eos> I'm trusting you, until you give me a reason not to.<eos> Trusting is a very stupid and dangerous habit, and yet I keep doing it.<eos> You put your neck on the line to protect the people you love.<eos> You shouldn't have to pay for that.<eos> You gonna open that or what?<eos> Caleb, it's Shelby.<eos> I know you probably don't want to hear this, but I think your family needs you right now.
Hope it's the lacrosse team getting their eyebrows pierced; that's hilarious.<eos> We got to go. Come on.<eos> That was weird.<eos> What's up with them?<eos> Sharice, let's go!<eos> Sharice!<eos> What the hell?<eos> They're upset you're leaving for Clayton.<eos> How did they know about Clayton?<eos> No clue, but I've been getting emails all day from the mothers asking if we're still going to make it to the finals without you.
You can't have sex till you visit all the bases. It's a rule.<eos> This is where I write all the rules.<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Casey, you have to try that on.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no. It is so you.<eos> I'm probably not gonna go to the dance. Evan's, like, banned from school property.<eos> Try it on. Seriously.<eos> Mm... It's gonna look really cute on you.
Then why are you telling people that I'm going to go there and buying me shirts?<eos> Because I think you're amazing, and I think you're gonna get in anyway.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm scared because I don't want to leave you guys and Evan and my team.<eos> Just the whole Clayton Prep thing is starting to feel kind of like...<eos> Selfish.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Even Sharice turned against me.<eos> No. Sharice is your best friend. When you were little, she followed you like a puppy dog.
Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.<eos> Were you aware of this? No.<eos> No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj,<eos> Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.<eos> How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.<eos> Why aren't you talking to me?<eos> - Because I'm mad at you. - Oh.<eos> Well, now I'm sorry I asked.<eos> Sheldon, it's humiliating.<eos> Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life.
What? !<eos> Hello, Father. We need to talk.<eos> All right.<eos> I have come to an important decision.<eos> I will not be accepting your money anymore.<eos> I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> Yes, that is wonderful!<eos> You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!<eos> I am so proud of you.
Yes, that is wonderful!<eos> You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.<eos> Where did I fail as a father? !<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Keep asking yourself that!<eos> But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.

Really?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah. You see, see this ant In the middle, right here?<eos> The, the really cute one?<eos> Uh, she's kind and fair.<eos> That's the queen.<eos> That's like me.<eos> And all these ants around on the side, those are worker ants.<eos> That's like you and chip and sabrina.<eos> Do i have to build tunnels for you?
That's like you and chip and sabrina.<eos> Do i have to build tunnels for you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, i mean, if i asked you to, you would.<eos> See, 'cause without the queen ant, All the other ants would just be running around like kooks.<eos> Nothing would get done.<eos> It'd be crazy.<eos> It'd be chaos, you know?<eos> You don't want that.<eos> Ben. We need you.
Sweet.<eos> No school.<eos> Oh, that's... Yeah.<eos> Yeah, i know.<eos> But, you know, Don't think that you just get to sit around And do whatever you want all day.<eos> no, i meant, you guys...<eos> You're grounded.<eos> Am i grounded, too?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. No more special treatment for you, buddy.
Hi.<eos> Am I, uh, am I crazy or is it my day to pick up Charlie, I thought?<eos> Oh, um... no, you're right.<eos> I'm gonna- - I'm gonna come in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I don't believe you.
HPD's got a bird in the air, but we lost visual.<eos> Well, y-you have to get her back.<eos> We're gonna do everything in our power.<eos> You don't, um, understand.<eos> I was the one who told them about Natasha.<eos> All right, listen, to me,<eos> Celine, I'm sure you didn't have an option.<eos> You don't blame yourself now, okay? Right.<eos> I'm not the only one to blame here.<eos> So now we know what I am worth to you.
No, it was a nice thing to do.<eos> Didn't change anything, but, uh...<eos> You can't change the way things are with Stan and me. No, but I thought, uh, you know, give it a shot.<eos> Not that-- change anything.<eos> You know what I mean. I just feel that I... contributed to the problem, so...<eos> No, this is, um... it's not your fault, Danny.<eos> Anyway, uh, I was, uh, I was at home, and I was, uh, I was thinking about, uh... when you and I had to tell Grace that we were splitting up.<eos> And I remember it being, uh, pretty awful, uh...<eos> For me, it was about the worst day of my life.<eos> And I don't want you to go through that alone, so I am here for you, if you want me to be here.

Belle, stop.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> That was my parents.<eos> They're looking for the other half of Blue's wand.<eos> Any luck in here?<eos> Not yet, but we've just begun.<eos> Well, can we hurry it up?<eos> Once my folks find that wand, I'm gonna go after the Black Fairy.<eos> Belle, I may have a way to speak to our son, but I need something from you first... your trust.
It's about...<eos> Well, it's about Henry.<eos> Henry?<eos> When the Final Battle comes, he'll want to fight to the very end.<eos> But the thing about battles is, not everyone makes it through.<eos> So... if we lose or... if there are casualties, he can't be anywhere near it.<eos> I need you to take him to New York where he will be safe and where... he can start a new life... with you.<eos> Regina, I-I don't know what to say.<eos> You'd really trust me to raise Henry?<eos> No, I trust him to raise you.
She means the heart of Storybrooke...<eos> Granny's.<eos> Granny's.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Sorry, sis.<eos> You'll have to sit this one out.<eos> Black Fairy: ♪ Saw the silent shadows did fall ♪<eos> ♪ I cried and called my sweet bairn's name ♪<eos> ♪ But never saw sweet baby again ♪<eos> You know, I've been keeping this down here just for you.
Are you serious?<eos> Do you really think that was a fond memory, being back in that house?<eos> That woman never cared for me, never loved me, never did one thing a mother should.<eos> She never even gave me a name.<eos> And when you defeat her, I won't shed a single tear.<eos> So, please, don't assume we share the same story.<eos> I just want to find my son.<eos> Gideon: I think you already have.<eos> Thank you... for fighting for me.<eos> I would do anything for you, son.
She has it well-hidden.<eos> - Then we're lost.<eos> - No.<eos> There is something here of use.<eos> The one thing she's afraid of...<eos> You learning her darkest secret.<eos> And what is that?<eos> The reason she gave you up.<eos> You've searched everywhere for a way to defeat her, but I think all your answers are right here,<eos> inside you.
The other half, please.<eos> Well, hang on just a second.<eos> How do we know that you are actually you?<eos> Because it's me.<eos> Wait. No. Hook's right.<eos> We should have a safe word or something.<eos> How do we know you're not the Black Fairy?<eos> Black Fairy: Because I am.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry I doubted you, love.
It's okay to be scared.<eos> Miss Swan, you are treading where few who have dared tread survive.<eos> We're past threats.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> This is bigger than anything you've ever faced.<eos> No curse, no monster is ever going to be as terrifying as finding out why you were abandoned.<eos> You think I'm afraid of the truth?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think it means being vulnerable, and you and I are people who are really bad at being vulnerable.<eos> If you won't do it or you, then do it for your son.
No.<eos> I need my power.<eos> If I sever his destiny, we can be together, and I will still be strong enough to protect him.<eos> Fiona, no.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Your son is destined to be a great hero.<eos> Do not take that from him.<eos> You do not need the power.<eos> Don't tell me what I need.<eos> I promise you, son, I will spend every moment of every day trying to find my way back to you!
Why did you want me to believe you hated me?<eos> I was banished to that empty, wretched place, Rumple.<eos> It was easier to let you hate me, at least until we found a way for us to be together.<eos> You didn't have to be banished.<eos> You chose your power over mine.<eos> I was trying to protect you.<eos> As someone who has made the very same decision, I know a lie when I hear it.<eos> You sentenced me to a life of cowardice.<eos> I altered your fate so that we could be a family together.<eos> Everything I did was for you, to protect you.
And I'm so sorry I allowed her to take control of me.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Of course we can.<eos> You were under her control.<eos> I can only imagine how difficult that was, but look...<eos> You needn't worry about her ever again.<eos> I know how hard that must have been, facing your mother like that, Rumple.<eos> Well, it's over now.<eos> The Black Fairy will never again be a problem for us.<eos> I'm proud of you, you know?
I can only imagine how difficult that was, but look...<eos> You needn't worry about her ever again.<eos> I know how hard that must have been, facing your mother like that, Rumple.<eos> Well, it's over now.<eos> The Black Fairy will never again be a problem for us.<eos> I'm proud of you, you know?<eos> You did what you said you would.<eos> You fought for this family.<eos> You saved your son.<eos> I'll make a promise to you, Belle, and to you, Gideon...
Tomorrow?<eos> You live here.<eos> Aye, but I'm not staying here tonight.<eos> It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> A seafaring man does not take superstitions lightly.<eos> The last thing you and I need is another stitch of bad luck.<eos> After tomorrow, there'll be no getting rid of me.<eos> - Promise?<eos> Black Fairy: So... did they trust you?
Are you kidding?<eos> You interrupted my story 'cause we're at a table?<eos> What story?<eos> About the cafeteria guy Christy's got no shot with.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Hostess movin' us to a booth?<eos> Adam misses me and wants to get together.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> - Oh, I'm so happy for you.
Sorry again.<eos> For what it's worth, I'm glad you guys are back together.<eos> Hey, we're fine as long as numbnuts here doesn't text his ex-wife again.<eos> Oh, come on, let's not start this.<eos> I told you, she texted me.<eos> She needed help with the pilot light on the water heater.<eos> Fine, but you still haven't said you're sorry.<eos> Because I'm not!<eos> Oh, numbnuts.<eos> Okay, so just to be clear, I text a guy who I was just friends with and that's an unforgivable offense, but it's okay for you to text your ex-wife right after you slaughtered my goat.
What if he wakes up?<eos> You stick his thumb in your mouth and start over.<eos> You don't wash your hands?<eos> I didn't touch anything.<eos> Anyway, he's seeing her tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you ask him about it?<eos> 'Cause then he'll know I broke into his phone and won't trust me anymore.<eos> - He shouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, but he doesn't know that.<eos> Maybe this relationship with Adam isn't good for you.
So, as we speak, my boyfriend and his semi ex-wife are having a romantic lunch in his apartment.<eos> With his very old dog.<eos> Aw, Adam has a dog?<eos> What kind?<eos> I think it's a "Shut the hell up, Wendy" doodle.<eos> The point is, this broad's plotting to get him back.<eos> Ex-wives'll do that.<eos> They'll get their boobs redone, cook up a couple of steaks, invite the guy over for a little night swimming'.<eos> Or stuff of that nature.<eos> Bonnie, if there's any hope for you and Adam, you got to learn to trust him.
Actually, I found him in a box on the side of the road.<eos> He was just a puppy.<eos> Aw, so you rescued him?<eos> Mm, he kind of rescued me.<eos> Okay, I think we're done walking'.<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> We hang out till he gets up.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> I think he likes me.<eos> I think he likes you, too.
Highway Patrol should be there any minute.<eos> With any luck... they rule Wayne's death accidental.<eos> We just have to make sure VFF gets the word and buys the story.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call me the minute you get a ping from Ian.<eos> You all right?<eos> No, not really.<eos> You know, my asset.<eos> How 'bout you?
Well, I guess I'm not a very good cyborg.<eos> You got the stuff?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Food's better at the Council of Elders, but it's still mostly based on squirrel.<eos> Look, I need a report.<eos> What's the word on the bomb?<eos> They're getting ready to use it.<eos> - What? - Yeah, big operation.<eos> I should get more details at the Council of Elders meeting next week.<eos> Here, I got something for you.
Madam Secretary.<eos> Step away from my client.<eos> Jim Fox?<eos> The mafia lawyer?<eos> Well, to be fair, he's also defended celebrity killers.<eos> Well, at least they found the Stingers.<eos> But if Milken won't talk, then we'll never find out who killed Agent Garcia.<eos> That why you're stress eating?<eos> No. I spent half the day thinking about dead rhinos.<eos> What about you?
He never has in the past.<eos> Why now?<eos> Well, he's certainly not doing it for the money.<eos> Milken doesn't exactly have deep pockets.<eos> Maybe there's a man behind the curtain who does.<eos> Mike B.?<eos> Well, if anyone can tell us who hired Jim Fox to represent Milken, it's Mike.<eos> Well, um, if I may, ma'am, why don't you call him yourself?<eos> Because, frankly, he'd rather hear from you.<eos> He asks about you, you know.
- It's kind of short.<eos> - Did you make that?<eos> - That's very short.<eos> It's for the Spring Fling.<eos> I'm going full Edie Sedgwick.<eos> Oh, you are.<eos> So, did you get asked?<eos> I asked someone, actually.<eos> Thad Newton.<eos> - Wow. Good for you.

I promise I'm just the same slightly lame guy that you saw this morning.<eos> The mission's not in such great shape, though.<eos> They raided the compound, but we missed some key members.<eos> How's your asset?<eos> Let's just say it's gonna be an interesting debrief tomorrow.<eos> The kids are here, I should go.<eos> Tell them no drinking.<eos> Not one drop,<eos> I mean it.<eos> Except for you,
And things got done.<eos> And now, to go back to bureaucracy and budget cuts, while-while stuff like that happens...<eos> I want to slay dragons, ma'am, not play whack-a-mole with evil.<eos> Sometimes making evil have to duck and find another hole is the best we're gonna do.<eos> Somebody sent me this after one of the terrorist attacks.<eos> It's a poem called "Good Bones" by Maggie Smith.<eos> The last part of it goes:<eos> "Life is short and the world is at least half terrible,<eos> "and for every kind stranger,<eos> "there is one who would break you,
Heard from her?<eos> What, since she wasn't arrested for aiding and abetting a domestic act of terrorism?<eos> No, I haven't, and I don't think that anyone else should, either.<eos> Shelby, she's part of the team.<eos> We can't ignore her.<eos> We can try.<eos> Just for that crack, you're driving.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> DéjÃ vu.<eos> For you, sure.
Changed my mind.<eos> I do feel like dancing.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You've just helped me.<eos> I thought you would want to see me go down.<eos> I don't want the mission to fail.<eos> You worked at the Children's Defense Fund.<eos> You wrote for "The Daily Show."<eos> I mean, you may have graduated from Quantico, but you quit three months later to write speeches for Eric Garcetti.<eos> This type of thing is not for you.

To understand that we all live with the pain of what's happened to us.<eos> Clay blames you for what happened to his father because it's easier than living with the fact that he wasn't perfect.<eos> Clayton was my biggest mistake.<eos> Clay doesn't know that.<eos> He thinks you're the mistake.<eos> And you?<eos> What about your mistake?<eos> Nimah, I love you. I do.<eos> And I don't love a lot of people, because I don't have a lot of people.<eos> I have Alex and you, and that is it.
[Peña] When we were having a head of department meeting,<eos> I was asked if I knew someone that they could recommend for a new design department that was going to be created called Wellbeing.<eos> I said, "Oh, maybe there's this lady, Ilse Crawford."<eos> I only knew about her name and her work from the magazine, Elle Decoration.<eos> She wrote a book, Sensual Home, and for some reason, I never bought it.<eos> But actually, I married the one that wrote it, so I didn't have to buy it.<eos> [Ilse] Oscar has been in industrial product design for decades and has joined the business.<eos> He's Colombian, so he's brought in this wonderful character and big heart.<eos> [Peña] This one is the last green touch.<eos> That counts as a vegetable for you, doesn't it?
He'll lead me to Kate.<eos> Get Dembe to a hospital, please.<eos> We should double back, find another path.<eos> This is all too exposed.<eos> You must know my friend Kate.<eos> Should've told you about Janet.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.<eos> I-I'm sorry that I'm-- Hey.<eos> Can I tell you something I admire about you?
I only resort to it in times of extreme necessity.<eos> So believe me when I say, this is both extreme and necessary.<eos> Call her.<eos> She said you'd do this.<eos> She said I'd do what exactly?<eos> Underestimate her.<eos> Baz!<eos> It's me.<eos> Your friends, uhm... the black fella and the man in the hat, Reddington-- they're here.<eos> You said they'd kill me to get you, if this is the last time you hear my voice, know that I didn't give you up.

I don't know.<eos> - Sister, maybe?<eos> - Racist.<eos> It was the way they're saying hi!<eos> Guys, shh!<eos> Racist.<eos> Man, she's meeting his family already.<eos> It's not that I don't like birthday parties.<eos> It's just that I don't like being the center of attention.<eos> Oh, you think the party is about you?
Always messing up my plans.<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Good to meet you.<eos> - Yeah, nice to meet you.<eos> This is my girlfriend.<eos> Happy to meet you too.<eos> Hey, come on down.<eos> I got a little surprise for you.
I had to change the theater to... not make it only that kind of typography.<eos> I remember I made these very dark posters that had serif typography, just to do something opposite to what I had done before.<eos> And I showed them to George Wolfe, and I was turning 50 at the time, and he said, "Okay, Paula is turning 50.<eos> I'm not sure... Did I say that?<eos> She said I said that, that's just framed bad.<eos> Okay, we're having soup.<eos> Soup with avocado.<eos> [dog whines] [both] Go away, Mimi!<eos> -Watch it.<eos> -[Paula] This is not for you.
Yeah.<eos> Well, hey, let me show you upstairs.<eos> - You want some coffee?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, Burgess, look who's here.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey!<eos> I told you to call me when you got here.<eos> - It was so nice to meet you, Nicole.<eos> - You too.
Have a great day.<eos> Nicole, hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey.<eos> I was...<eos> - It's Adam, remember?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I last saw you at your husband's birthday.<eos> I remember you.
This is an empty box.<eos> God is in all His churches.<eos> Your God's love is not unconditional.<eos> He does not love us.<eos> And He does not love you.<eos> I have done His bidding.<eos> My life's work is in His name.<eos> Your life's work makes Him puke.<eos> I am the Bishop of Gresit!<eos> Your God knows that we wouldn't be here without you.
I am the Bishop of Gresit!<eos> Your God knows that we wouldn't be here without you.<eos> isn't it?<eos> She was a witch!<eos> Lies? In your house of God?<eos> No wonder He has abandoned you.<eos> But we love you.<eos> What?<eos> We love you.<eos> We couldn't be here without you.
I fight for myself.<eos> Fine.<eos> You.<eos> Kill them!<eos> Quickly!<eos> No.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're very big at telling other people what to do.<eos> Getting the good people of Gresit to commit murder for you.
he's not.<eos> He's a vampire. have you?<eos> Belmont.<eos> but it's not been abandoned.<eos> It's alive and working. tell her exactly how long you've been waiting down here.<eos> What is the year of your Lord?<eos> 1476.<eos> then.<eos> There. what kind of messiah creates mechanical death traps to buy himself an uninterrupted nap in a stone coffin?<eos> My defenses were not for you.

Heh, look at this.<eos> You already got a hit.<eos> And she sent a message.<eos> She did?<eos> What am I looking at here?<eos> It's mostly small, colorful pictures.<eos> Those are emojis.<eos> Read 'em. Okay, it says "Hey," and then a kissy face, and then, like, a saucy, smirking face, three balloons, and a locomotive.<eos> What the hell is all this?<eos> Maybe she likes you.
Wait, what do you mean?<eos> - You want to keep wearing the brace?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> When I wear this brace, I get pampered like the Queen of England.<eos> So, I have the most money in the world, right?<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Great. Can you make sure my hair looks like anyone in a nursing home?<eos> All right, hitting the links.<eos> Joe, golf shorts may not be the right look for you.
- I don't think so.<eos> Chopper, scan.<eos> A probe?<eos> What's it doing way out here?<eos> Speaks Imperial. That's bad.<eos> Let's blast it before it spots us.<eos> Ezra, get in the nose gun, but hold your fire.<eos> We don't want to attract attention if we can avoid it.<eos> I'll power down so it can't scan us.<eos> That includes you, Chopper.
Transport's lost shields.<eos> Get everyone off the transport and on the Ghost, now.<eos> Let us be of assistance, Captain.<eos> Senator Mon Mothma?<eos> Proper introductions will have to wait, I'm afraid.<eos> Right.<eos> Gold Leader, we need a diversion.<eos> - Copy.<eos> Gold Squadron, follow my lead.<eos> - I'm right behind you.
Now, submit or be destroyed.<eos> Very well.<eos> - She'll never keep her word.<eos> - I know. I'm stalling her while you figure out a plan.<eos> I'll take what I can get.<eos> Keep working.<eos> Look out!<eos> He's on top of us.<eos> Uh, he's coming around.<eos> Gold Leader, I'm bringing him right to you.
In fact, I am the reason my mission was successful.<eos> This inventory droid is a complication that could ruin my plan.<eos> We must appease him.<eos> For now.<eos> You just called me "Sir"?<eos> Oh, now I see what you're up to, C1-10P!<eos> You want me to relax so you can take possession of the data disk.<eos> Hey, Chop, would you mind checking on the hyperdrive power coils?<eos> Feels like we're dragging a bit.<eos> Look, AP, this childish competition between you and Chopper has gone too far.
Maul was manipulating you.<eos> I want to go to Tatooine to check things out.<eos> Ezra, can I have a word with you?<eos> We're training for the attack on Lothal, and nobody knows that place better than you.<eos> I need you to help us prepare if we're going to be successful.<eos> But, Hera, if Master Kenobi is alive, think of what he could do for the Rebellion.<eos> If he was alive, do you think he would be hiding on some backwater world instead of helping us?<eos> I wish things were different.<eos> I really do.<eos> But right now, I need you here.
Hera really did it.<eos> Look at everyone.<eos> I can't believe they're all gonna help Lothal.<eos> - It wasn't just Hera.<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> You, too, Kanan.<eos> And Zeb and Sabine.<eos> Chopper... less so.<eos> No. That's not what I meant.<eos> I meant you.
You, too, Kanan.<eos> And Zeb and Sabine.<eos> Chopper... less so.<eos> No. That's not what I meant.<eos> I meant you.<eos> Kanan, I...<eos> I didn't do any of this.<eos> If not for you guys, I'd be back on Lothal, just waiting to be rescued like everyone else.<eos> Ezra, you have never been like everyone else.<eos> Hera always saw something special in you, and so did I.
Wait.<eos> Bendu, hear me out.<eos> No!<eos> I am the one in the middle.<eos> I take no side.<eos> So you're just gonna let us die?<eos> You think the Empire won't kill you, too?<eos> I am beyond your worrying and wars.<eos> I am unseen, unknowable, like a rock in the river.<eos> Do you think it chance this world was so difficult for you to find, eh? But maybe we were meant to find it and meant to find you.

No...<eos> Just listen for a second.<eos> This is so awkward.<eos> I don't...<eos> We're doing our jobs.<eos> Nell.<eos> When you subbed in... on my bar trivia night.<eos> We were friends before, but, um that's when everything changed.<eos> And that's when I knew.<eos> That's when I knew I was in love with you.
Nell.<eos> When you subbed in... on my bar trivia night.<eos> We were friends before, but, um that's when everything changed.<eos> And that's when I knew.<eos> That's when I knew I was in love with you.<eos> Not only because your unfathomable knowledge of pirate diseases helped break our losing streak, but because of how amazing you were with my friends.<eos> And... how amazing you are with me.<eos> I can't top that.<eos> Can you go first, hon?<eos> I knew that I was in love with you when you came to my home and you met my family.
Thanks.<eos> Go ahead, Caesar.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right, so there's a girl lost in the woods, she's barefoot, and it's this cold out?<eos> Sounds like the guy's hallucinating.<eos> There's one way to find out.<eos> Suit up.<eos> Get everyone together from every different jurisdiction in five.<eos> Won't be any footprints, but maybe we get lucky.<eos> Hank, we're a couple hundred yards north of you, approaching a cabin.
Y-you can trace the deposit.<eos> You can trace the call.<eos> Shanee Wallis wasn't reported missing.<eos> Her friend didn't mention anything.<eos> Well, then someone's lying.<eos> But it's not me.<eos> No, it's none of these.<eos> He's older, he's bald.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have said that earlier.<eos> Why did he separate you and Shanee?
I will do everything in my power to keep her safe.<eos> And her mother.<eos> Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> He went for smokes last night.<eos> He didn't come back.<eos> Maybe he ran out on you.<eos> No, he left his car.<eos> Did he leave his keys?<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe he left them for you. No.
It doesn't bother me.<eos> I know.<eos> But that was before.<eos> Before what?<eos> Before me.<eos> Take those off.<eos> I want to meet the woman who plays peek-a-boo, who reads fairy tales, who makes funny faces at babies.<eos> I never make funny faces at babies, ever.<eos> Promise me you'll think about a change of venue, for me.<eos> For you.
I was at his funeral.<eos> There was no reason for nikos to send his dog mato after me.<eos> That psychopath just broke my brother's jaw looking for me.<eos> Okay, just take this, all right?<eos> And go. We don't want any trouble.<eos> I don't want your money!<eos> Who are you?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Annie kaplan.<eos> I guess that makes you Mr. kaplan.
Metal plate.<eos> Nikos.<eos> Where's Annie?<eos> I'll let you two talk.<eos> Nikos, where's Annie?<eos> I'm sorry, Kate.<eos> She was gone before the ambulance even got there.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Annie was my family.<eos> I know how she felt about you.

A life of crime?<eos> He's a traitor.<eos> I have nothing to say to him, and I don't want to hear anything he has to say to me.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Lizzy is fine, now.<eos> But red says she's in danger.<eos> What kind of danger?<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> And there's something he wants to ask you.<eos> Work for you?
And page one is just a dedication to Winston.<eos> Ugh. Come on.<eos> The kids used to love Vice Principal Jess, and now they won't have anything to do with Principal Jess.<eos> It's like I'm living in my own damn adorable shadow.<eos> Please?<eos> You-you might get some ideas from your audience.<eos> My audience is the men who built this great country.<eos> Your students would never understand that Pepperwood's just a New Orleans story about a guy fighting with the alligator within.<eos> Well, could you just do it for me?<eos> Yeah, I'll.. I mean, I'll do it for you, Jess, sure.
So you guys don't get to write to your international pen pals for a month.<eos> You've all lost your community garden privileges.<eos> Two weeks' suspension from the freestyle poetry slam.<eos> And I'm calling all of your parents.<eos> Spread the word!<eos> Principal Day is done messing around.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Oh, my God, they work fast.<eos> When did they even take this picture?<eos> Well, apart from the devil horns, it's a pretty good picture of you, Jess.
I can't condone you... making contact with my students.<eos> - What?<eos> - That said... thanks for putting them up to it.<eos> Jess, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> "Upmost"?<eos> There's only one person I know that says "upmost."<eos> - It's "utmost." - "Utmost"?<eos> "Utmost."<eos> Agree to disagree.<eos> But the good news is my writer's block is gone, and that is thanks to you.
I assure you, it's "utmost."<eos> - What's an "ut"?<eos> - Come on, you're a writer.<eos> It's "up." Up to the most.<eos> Not ut to the most.<eos> I assure you.<eos> - Okay, sweetie.<eos> - You didn't come in here and say,<eos> "Thanks for putting them ut to it."<eos> I would've laughed you out of here.
I would've laughed you out of here.<eos> What is an "ut"?<eos> ! Furguson is miserable.<eos> So you're saying that this is a different emotion than we've seen for the past three years?<eos> A father knows.<eos> He misses Gil.<eos> It'd be wrong for me to take away a piece of his heart.<eos> I mean, I already took away his testicles.<eos> Anyway, let me just... _<eos> Proud of you.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> This team was created to put an end to the rogue group of agents within the CIA working on behalf of eight power players in America.<eos> Sooner or later, the Collaborators will stage another attack, and when they do, your mother will be done.<eos> When she resigns, we all know who's next in succession.<eos> Henry Roarke.<eos> Caleb, it's Shelby.<eos> I think your family needs you right now.

I just see what's coming.<eos> You kept me waiting longer than I thought.<eos> No one is meeting you here.<eos> Oh, that's not true.<eos> So, this is all just for me, huh, the Russian?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, you don't trust me.<eos> I don't trust anyone.<eos> - Well, I trust you.
I don't trust anyone.<eos> - Well, I trust you.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You buy these in bulk?<eos> How many girls are you listening to right now?<eos> Look, I can go.<eos> I'll make you a deal...<eos> One time only.<eos> Any details about me you need, any documents or photos you want, ask now.<eos> I like you, Sasha. You intrigue me.
Apparently.<eos> But I wouldn't trust anything you give me.<eos> Then get it for yourself.<eos> This is a key to my apartment.<eos> You know I've been here all morning. You've been listening yourself.<eos> I haven't touch a thing since you left, so go.<eos> Rummage through the place, see for yourself who I am.<eos> No, I don't need to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I like you, too, okay?
What happened?<eos> I let my fear of failure take me to a dark place...<eos> A place I needed to go to remind me it's never where I ever want to be.<eos> Clay, you have a gift.<eos> You know how to inspire people, how to keep us moving forward even when we don't want to.<eos> That speech tonight...<eos> We know you wrote it.<eos> But more than that, we know that you mean it.<eos> Thank you for not leaving us.<eos> We need you.
At some time or another, they've lied to me.<eos> But you don't.<eos> You never have.<eos> Yeah, that's a lot to put on me.<eos> Some day, I may have to.<eos> I know, but you haven't yet.<eos> I'm gonna start tomorrow.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Alex Parrish, if we're being honest with each other,<eos> I never really liked you...
I bet you didn't know I would do that, either.<eos> Oh, you're smarter than you look.<eos> - This has to stop.<eos> - Can it wait half an hour?<eos> I have to run down a lead.<eos> A lead?<eos> On me and my team?<eos> I know you think I'm an adversary, but I'm on your side.<eos> I think I found something that could help you. I swear!<eos> You want me to trust you now?

He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.<eos> I'm trying, but I'm judging.<eos> Maybe your dad's right.<eos> Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.<eos> I have come to an important decision.<eos> I will not be accepting your money anymore.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> Yes, that is wonderful.<eos> You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
So, do you want to come?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I already live in a place all the nerds come to.<eos> I went to your boring thing last month.<eos> My aunt's funeral?<eos> Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.<eos> Well, I'm not going, but I do think it's nice you want to.<eos> It's not that I want to go, I just think it'll make Leonard happy.<eos> And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.<eos> Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks.
I'm such a lucky guy. (chuckles)<eos> You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?<eos> I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.<eos> Oh, dear God, you're cheating on me with Raj.<eos> (giggles): Never gets old.<eos> Okay, there is something I want, but it's not a big deal.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys.<eos> But before you say anything, I'll make up for being gone by doing everything around here- - I mean everything.<eos> I'm even gonna answer for you. (high-pitched voice):
The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Dinner's almost ready.<eos> If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like its cousin, bowl of meat.<eos> Hey, if you're still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.<eos> Thank you, but it doesn't look like I'm going to Comic-Con this year.<eos> Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.<eos> Howie?<eos> Sure.<eos> This is for you.
Mom.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's ok, Mom.<eos> You're just here to visit me.<eos> Cassie told you. Cassie?<eos> I sent that girl packing.<eos> Rotten little thief.<eos> She was stealing from me.<eos> Mom, Cassie's not a thief.<eos> She takes really good care of you.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Maybe it's some kind of long-term déjà vu.<eos> Déjà vu doesn't include shards of glass at the bottom of Black Pine Cove.<eos> Like this is the first time you passed out and woke up with mysterious wounds?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, okay, listen.<eos> I'm a black-out drunk.<eos> Black-out, as in nothing in the head.<eos> Why is my head packed?<eos> You wouldn't believe the stuff I have in here.<eos> Stuff about you.
Can I have my cellphone back?<eos> I have someone I have to call.<eos> That won't be possible at this present time.<eos> _<eos> I'm just checking to see if you're okay.<eos> Uh, Serena's still sleeping it off.<eos> Her breathing's great.<eos> Nice and deep.<eos> Uh, call me.<eos> I'm just thinking about you.
You're more like me.<eos> There's some...<eos> Sam...<eos> Just tell me again what happened, Mum.<eos> How he died.<eos> - When I was...<eos> - I remember I was at nursery.<eos> And you were in a car crash, a lorry came out of nowhere and hit you head on, and that's when you got your scar.<eos> That's right.<eos> Dad scooped you up in his arms and took you from the car.
Sam, don't forget your swimming kit.<eos> Sam!<eos> I saw you come in, thought we could do some more diving practice.<eos> I was doing this game, playing this game, it's a diving game.<eos> I thought this game, it might help you.<eos> I've been doing these exercises for my arms.<eos> I can really feel, feel the difference.<eos> You should come to mine tonight.<eos> We're having hangers and mash.<eos> I don't even fucking like you!
Found it.<eos> - Go on. Where?<eos> - In the street.<eos> Sam, I know it's Mr. Williams'.<eos> He gave it to me.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> It was the night he died.<eos> But you said he was asleep.<eos> It's ridiculous. I don't believe you.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's not though, is it?<eos> My mum died. People say it gets better, but it's just shit.<eos> - I don't bite.<eos> - I know.<eos> What is it about you?<eos> I can't put my finger on it.<eos> On what?<eos> The reason I like you.
It's meant to be a gentle death, like drowning.<eos> I wouldn't have thought drowning was gentle.<eos> - I found it.<eos> - Sam, that's Mr. Williams'.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> I don't even like you!
I meant to tell you.<eos> But what?<eos> Couldn't find the right time?<eos> Please.<eos> Please listen to me.<eos> Do you... have any idea how it feels to grow up without your dad?<eos> I-I had to protect you.<eos> Protect me?<eos> It's no wonder you never liked to talk about him.<eos> Cos it's you you're the one I need protecting from.
- No, no!<eos> That was James.<eos> That was James, James loved you.<eos> - James...<eos> - I don't want to hear about him!<eos> No, but that was the man that he killed!<eos> You mean the man you ran away with.<eos> - Why did you leave my dad?<eos> - He wasn't your dad.<eos> He didn't love you, he didn't even want me to have you.
Have a seat.<eos> She told me you were dead.<eos> I can understand why she would have done that.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not her fault.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> Honestly...<eos> Not much.<eos> I don't really remember you.
I can understand why she would have done that.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not her fault.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> Honestly...<eos> Not much.<eos> I don't really remember you.<eos> That's OK, you were small.<eos> I remember you, though.
It's my fault.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> Honestly...<eos> Not much.<eos> I don't really remember you.<eos> That's OK, you were small.<eos> I remember you, though.<eos> Kicking the ball, riding your bike, mucking about in the paddling pool.<eos> You'd keep going all day.<eos> Made me tired just watching you.
You'd keep going all day.<eos> Made me tired just watching you.<eos> We used to say you had rocket fuel in your veins.<eos> - Me and Mum.<eos> She left you.<eos> And she left you for...<eos> - For that man.<eos> - Yes, for James.<eos> Whatever she says, whatever I did, I loved her very much.<eos> And I love you.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Take a seat, Sam.<eos> You know, I don't really need to be here.<eos> It's to please my mother.<eos> You feel good when you please her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's a worrier.<eos> What about pleasing your father?<eos> It's clearly important to you to see him.
Can you think why your mother might be concerned about your relationship with him?<eos> It's hard for her to accept I can make my own decisions.<eos> She's got good reason to worry, hasn't she?<eos> No.<eos> - No, it's all cool.<eos> - Really? Your mother told me about the stealing, the lying.<eos> I'm 16, Helen.<eos> Going through a phase.<eos> OK.<eos> So there's nothing special about you then?
What was the question?<eos> How do you feel, knowing your father is a murderer?<eos> Fine.<eos> He's paid his debt to society.<eos> OK.<eos> But what about James, the man he killed?<eos> What are your feelings for him?<eos> I didn't really know him.<eos> But you remember him, don't you?<eos> He looked after you with your mum when you were young.
So...<eos> Do I get to go to prison to visit my dad?<eos> That was the deal, wasn't it?<eos> I'll call and make the arrangements.<eos> Chrissy, we're going to be late.<eos> Can you help me with this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I could never do this.<eos> There we are.<eos> Let me look at you.
There we are.<eos> Let me look at you.<eos> - Lovely.<eos> - Yeah, I'm good at funeral wear.<eos> Sorry, that was childish.<eos> What time will you be back?<eos> It's not as if you knew the woman.<eos> Go and wait for me in the car.<eos> All right, Dad.<eos> You know it was the nurse, the nurse that looked after you so well.
- Lovely.<eos> - Yeah, I'm good at funeral wear.<eos> Sorry, that was childish.<eos> What time will you be back?<eos> It's not as if you knew the woman.<eos> Go and wait for me in the car.<eos> All right, Dad.<eos> You know it was the nurse, the nurse that looked after you so well.<eos> - Well, that's her job. - Yeah.<eos> And that's why I came back here, to look after you.
- They can't have gone far.<eos> - Let's go to your house first!<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> - Hi, Gran.<eos> - I don't want him in my house.<eos> I don't know how you stand her.<eos> Who do you think you're smirking at?<eos> Come back down here!<eos> It's not up to you, Gran.
- What?<eos> - She's dead, Chrissy.<eos> She can't be!<eos> No, she can't be dead!<eos> Hey, it's all right.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - It's all right, it's all right.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Look at me, look at me.<eos> - I'm here for you. - Get the fuck off me!
I just need to make her see, OK?<eos> Get out my way!<eos> All right, go on, go on after her, go on.<eos> Don't be long, huh?<eos> Chrissy.<eos> I've got to go back, I want my dad.<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> It's too weird,<eos> - I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> - He likes you.
Get out my way!<eos> All right, go on, go on after her, go on.<eos> Don't be long, huh?<eos> Chrissy.<eos> I've got to go back, I want my dad.<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> It's too weird,<eos> - I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> - He likes you.<eos> My dad really likes you and you can't go back.
You love me.<eos> You love me!<eos> How could you think that now?<eos> Sam, please.<eos> Please, Sam!<eos> Sam, what the fuck?<eos> Please, no!<eos> - Sh... - Sam!<eos> Sam!<eos> I don't need you.
You love me!<eos> How could you think that now?<eos> Sam, please.<eos> Please, Sam!<eos> Sam, what the fuck?<eos> Please, no!<eos> - Sh... - Sam!<eos> Sam!<eos> I don't need you.<eos> I don't need you.
Where's Chrissy?<eos> - What are you doing here? - It's just us.<eos> - What?<eos> - She ran away, Mum.<eos> We're not supposed to be here. This is<eos> - supposed to be just us, Dad.<eos> - Why are you saying that?<eos> - He doesn't want you, Sam.<eos> - He wants me.<eos> - I'm not coming back to you!
- He wants me.<eos> - I'm not coming back to you!<eos> I'm staying with Dad.<eos> He understands me.<eos> - He loves me.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - Well, you've got that wrong.<eos> - Sam...<eos> Dad...<eos> I knew she'd come after you.
Tried to drown me.<eos> And he wanted to kill me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I tried really hard to protect you.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> You weren't strong enough.<eos> But you don't have to be strong any more, Mum, because I'm a man now.<eos> I'm all grown up.<eos> And I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> I can take care of you now, properly.
I'm all grown up.<eos> And I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> I can take care of you now, properly.<eos> I'll put the kettle on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tea or instant?<eos> Tea.<eos> Put this around you.<eos> It'll keep you warm.<eos> What would I do without you?
-I don't care about that.<eos> -Well, I do.<eos> It's obvious that I only cause problems for you.<eos> Since I left, everything's gone so well for you.<eos> Are you going to pretend that nothing happened?<eos> -That kiss was a mistake.<eos> -No, it wasn't, Alba.<eos> Since you arrived, everything's changed for me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You.
Uh, I'm very sorry, but--<eos> I just want you to tell me if you find out anything.<eos> I assure you, I can be very generous.<eos> How could you do that to me?<eos> Do you want to get me fired?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> I just want you to tell the truth.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> It doesn't matter what you say, I don't believe you.
-I told Don Francisco--<eos> -Is this really necessary?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Excuse me, could you leave me alone with Miss Aguilar?<eos> It will just be a moment.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What's all this about?<eos> You know very well that I don't have papers.<eos> I know it, you know it, but they don't.<eos> I know all about you, Don Francisco, your past with him... and this reunion at the station.
-How was your day?<eos> Good?<eos> -Yes, very good.<eos> [Francisco] Lidia.<eos> Let's go to my office.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> [Alba] You're crazy.<eos> They almost saw us, and my shift starts in ten minutes. What's this about?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> What did he say? Or what did you say to make him believe you?
Look, this is the report from customer support...<eos> [Ángeles] Lidia. Lidia.<eos> Um... it isn't easy for me to say this to you...<eos> You don't have to.<eos> No, I do. I do.<eos> Please.<eos> You were right.<eos> [sighs] I was furious about Mario, and... I didn't even give you the benefit of the doubt.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Wrong about you and wrong about Carolina.
Well, geniuses and their patrons.<eos> [chuckles] Yes.<eos> -What about your father?<eos> -My father!<eos> When the rotary's up and running, he'll have to say we were right.<eos> I'll take the blueprints.<eos> I'll get the money to do it, but this needs to stay between us.<eos> Got it?<eos> No one's to know.<eos> I don't know how I can look you in the eye.
Why do we lie, knowing that the truth could come to light?<eos> Maybe the fear of facing the truth paralyzes us.<eos> Anyway, Ángeles continuing to work is cause for celebration.<eos> Of course. And the more women work, the less we men have to do.<eos> -I'm getting a drink.<eos> He's charming.<eos> Witty, intelligent, fun.<eos> Not many like him left.<eos> So... you needn't worry about me.<eos> It's obvious you like him, and he likes you.
-Get in.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> -No.<eos> I'm not leaving until we talk.<eos> You want to talk?<eos> Let's talk.<eos> I don't want you to do anything for me.<eos> I don't want you to leave anything behind for me.<eos> I don't want you throwing your life away, because I don't love you.<eos> I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.<eos> It's true.<eos> I'm grateful for what you did, but when I pay my debt--<eos> I don't care about the money.<eos> Ten years apart, and finally we're together.<eos> It's a sign, Alba.<eos> If I'd known you worked here, I never would've come.<eos> You can't be in love with me.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> -I'm in love with you.
If I had to put up with you day and night, I'd have been the one who slit my wrists, not Elisa.<eos> Ricardo... that's enough.<eos> That isn't even half of what he deserves. [door opens]<eos> How is she, doctor? She has to rest.<eos> She's awake now.<eos> Doña Carmen, your daughter has asked to see her husband first.<eos> Darling... how are you?<eos> Do you still love her?<eos> That's all in the past.<eos> I really need to believe you, because I can't... I can't bear the idea of you thinking about another woman. -Elisa...
[softly] I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you. I just wanted to get on with my life.<eos> Do you have to choose my best friend, my brother-in-law?<eos> I don't believe it! I don't!<eos> I was about to destroy my life and my wife's life for nothing!<eos> Alba... tell me it wasn't for nothing.<eos> I didn't ask you to give up anything for me.<eos> I suppose you'll remember this.<eos> You're still living in the past.<eos> I don't believe you.
"Sorry"?<eos> Do you really think he knows the meaning of that word?<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> We were happy until you came along.<eos> -So it's my fault? -Yes.<eos> Don't kid yourself.<eos> I'm just the latest on a long list that includes Rosalía Fernández,<eos> Antonia, Estrella and Carmencita, that cute receptionist. -[breathing heavily]<eos> -But you should consider yourself lucky.<eos> Either out of pity or love, Mario always goes back to you.
It takes a lot of blows to make you stop seeing with your heart.<eos> But when that heart finally does break, it can't be put back together.<eos> And from then on, only reason remains.<eos> Reason leads to distrust.<eos> And from distrust to hatred... there is only one step.<eos> Any left? -What?<eos> -Is there any left?<eos> Ah.<eos> Do you like brandy?<eos> Are you asking because I'm a woman or because you want the rest? [chuckles]
-Welcome to my temple.<eos> This is my secret hideaway, Lidia.<eos> It's entirely possible that right now, my dear father is writing a new will to disinherit me. Hmm.<eos> Tomorrow, they might not even let me into the building.<eos> That would be a shame. [chuckles]<eos> "I had thought that, as well as being a magnificent host, you had big dreams."<eos> I guess I'm not such a good host.<eos> It was a great party. I didn't mean to insult you.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just that... I expected more from you.
Gain their trust.<eos> I'll help them get the copper.<eos> Some copper's been stolen in Talavera, and we have to fix the line urgently.<eos> -We can't wait for the usual paperwork--<eos> -Come here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> It's about Carolina.<eos> You're saying she has a letter.<eos> A letter addressed to you... I mean, to Alba.
Are you going to explain, or should I give you my theory?<eos> All right.<eos> It's true.<eos> My real name is Alba.<eos> I changed it to be able to work here.<eos> Francisco was the love of my youth.<eos> I hadn't seen him for ten years.<eos> There's nothing between us now.<eos> All right.<eos> I believe you.
We have a problem.<eos> You and I don't have much more to say.<eos> You wrote me a note.<eos> There was a letter in the suitcase.<eos> You know I did.<eos> What did it say?<eos> [chuckles] You humiliated me and now you want to make a fool of me.<eos> You want me to tell you I love you so you can reject me?<eos> -I'm not humiliating you.<eos> -Sorry, I don't believe you this time.
Is it really going to end like this?<eos> Over a kiss?<eos> Carlota, I don't care if you kiss Sara, or anyone else.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I love you just the way you are.<eos> Free, unpredictable.<eos> I don't want you to change.<eos> All right, then... what's the problem?<eos> I know what you mean to me.<eos> I don't know what I mean to you.
Because we've been waiting for it since suffrage was born...<eos> I don't understand how you let Ángeles go back home to that animal.<eos> We had no choice.<eos> The law is on his side.<eos> Men make the laws for themselves.<eos> [sighs] They're not all like Mario.<eos> Miguel is different.<eos> He's made that clear in the two years I've been with him.<eos> I love him... [inhales deeply] and I'm not throwing my relationship away... ♪ You're not a lover You're a tyrant ♪ because of an attraction.<eos> Sara... I like you, but it's not enough for me to leave him.
He works in administration?<eos> What's his name?<eos> Pablo Santos.<eos> [Alba] Because, despite what they say, the past was not always better.<eos> But if you forgive the damage it has done to you, the past will become the present, and it will trap you again and won't let you escape.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> [Alba] You have to live in the present and trust in the future.<eos> It's not easy, but who said life was?<eos> How did you manage to get her to believe you?

I was just trying to be pleasant.<eos> Break up with Carlos tonight. If you don't, I'll tell him everything.<eos> You helped me with Carolina to save your marriage.<eos> -You wouldn't dare. -Don't test me.<eos> My wife almost killed herself because you appeared in my life.<eos> You clouded my judgment. [inhales sharply]<eos> I was going to leave it all for you, but you're not worth it.<eos> You destroy everything you touch.<eos> -You won't soften me up. -[sniffles]<eos> I know this is undoubtedly one of your great performances because there's nothing real left in you.

Me?<eos> I only think about myself?<eos> You have no idea! No idea!<eos> All of this, all of it, I'm doing it for you.
Then this will be easier for both of us.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Thirty minutes ago, you were the life of the party. Are you going to throw it all away?<eos> CHAPTER 6:<eos> FAMILY<eos> This is all moving very fast, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it.<eos> Excuses. Excuses.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> -I'm not right for you. -[scoffs]
-Confused? Not at all.<eos> I understand very well what's going on here.<eos> I won't say anything, but don't ask me to keep working as normal.<eos> We're committing a crime, and now I'm an accomplice. -It won't always be like this.<eos> -Well, that's reassuring.<eos> Automation is the future.<eos> You said it.<eos> It will come about.<eos> You'll have what you wanted and we'll stop doing this.<eos> Your father is starting to trust you.
My father had asked them to fire me.<eos> I know it's wrong, and we have no secrets, and it's wrong to lie, but I had no choice. It's all right.<eos> At times, life leaves us no choice.<eos> Did the Cifuenteses do anything?<eos> [voice breaking] They used their contacts and they tried, but... -[sighs]<eos> -Carlota, you've done all you could. No, I haven't.<eos> I haven't done enough.<eos> I just want to see her.<eos> If you go back there, they'll arrest you.<eos> I could tell by the way the policeman was looking at you.
How generous!<eos> You ruined her--<eos> Stop it!<eos> I don't want to hear another word.<eos> Forget about me, both of you.<eos> -Drop it.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Lidia is protecting you. Everything she's doing is for you.<eos> What?<eos> She's stayed in the company and gotten close to the owner's son for you.

Everything she's doing is for you.<eos> What?<eos> She's stayed in the company and gotten close to the owner's son for you.<eos> You were photographed kissing when you met at the train station.<eos> Alba is doing all she can to ensure those photos are never seen.<eos> She's doing it all for you.
Here's to now!<eos> We have to enjoy the moment.<eos> And this could be the last night of our lives.<eos> [Alba] They say that blood is thicker than water. Good afternoon.<eos> That the ties that bind you to your family are unbreakable.<eos> But we don't choose our families. [Carlos] What was the lawyer doing here?<eos> It's strange.<eos> You think you know your children, but they are as they are, not as you would like them to be.<eos> You have to accept that.<eos> And just when I was thinking I was wrong about you, I find Francisco in front of the rotary!
And just when I was thinking I was wrong about you, I find Francisco in front of the rotary!<eos> Now you can imagine why I called the lawyer! Someday, you'll admit you're mistaken.<eos> That machine is the future.<eos> And so you can lie to me, steal from the company?<eos> Look who's talking.<eos> You use your company to spy on your clients.<eos> That paid for the house you live in and the school where you were educated.<eos> Educating your children means giving them values.<eos> I lie, but to strangers and always to protect my family.<eos> Why do you think I hid it from you? I did it to protect you.
That's interesting.<eos> -Since when, exactly?<eos> -Since the bar.<eos> So don't invent some excuse, you man-eater.<eos> I'll be very brief.<eos> Pablo's mine, all mine, got it? I'm not giving him up just like that.<eos> [gasps]<eos> [Alba] The truth is, you never know how much you love something until you lose it.<eos> It happened to me with Francisco, with Gimena, and I didn't want it to happen to me again.<eos> You know I would leave everything for you?
You don't feel anything for Carlos.<eos> You're saying that to punish me. Francisco, please.<eos> You're making it up to push me away.<eos> [scoffs] You really feel something for Carlos.<eos> Is it just an infatuation? Are you in love with him?<eos> Carlos makes me happy.<eos> Do you know how long it's been since I've felt happy? Of course I know.<eos> Ten years.<eos> Do you know how I felt all those years?<eos> Thinking about you was very, very painful.
It could've ended in tragedy.<eos> [sighs] What's he doing here?<eos> One of the girls found him in trouble and brought him.<eos> He keeps saying your name.<eos> I read the obituary in the paper.<eos> The rich kid is about to inherit a fortune, right?<eos> In another time, I would've told you to take advantage of the situation.<eos> With a ring on your finger, you won't need to steal anything.<eos> Not everyone does things out of self-interest.<eos> I was only thinking of what's best for you.
I was just saying to Indalecio that if he didn't turn up tonight, we'd have to put it in the hands of the authorities.<eos> But fortunately, there was no need. So, thank you.<eos> You can go.<eos> Good day. -He turned up?<eos> -[Carmen] Yes.<eos> Where was he?<eos> Getting drunk in a bar... that we went to a few days ago.<eos> You've gotten to know my son very well in such a short time.<eos> Someone might think that annoys you.<eos> My dear, there were others before you. [chuckles] Yes.
You look so pretty!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Your mother's putting away your father's things. -She says it hurts to see them.<eos> -[smacks lips]<eos> -You want a souvenir of your master? -I don't want to fight.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You'd definitely win.<eos> With my aching body and hangover, a fly could beat me.<eos> I know what you think of me, but I didn't do it.<eos> I am who I am thanks to you. Who you are...
It's what your father wanted, Elisa.<eos> He had his reasons.<eos> -If it's any consolation, I had no idea. -Oh, poor Carlos!<eos> What a terrible burden, inheriting the entire family fortune!<eos> -What?<eos> Elisa, my girl!<eos> [Francisco sighs]<eos> Let her blow off some steam. She has good reason.<eos> See how your father trusted you?<eos> He knew you were brilliant, and this is proof of it.

Because I'm not sure if I want to move forward with it.<eos> It would take a huge investment and we'd lay off a lot of staff, putting many operators out of work.<eos> There are always connections... Didn't you hear me?<eos> I'm not sure if I want to do it.<eos> You have to do it.<eos> Your time has come.<eos> All the quarrels and fights you had with your father were to light a fire under you, to prepare you for this.<eos> Enough excuses and whining.<eos> You have to do it... and I'm going to help you.<eos> I've always had faith in you, and you know it.
I think that means he's getting better.<eos> Is it day or night?<eos> I don't, I don't care, I just want to know.<eos> Lois, answer the bloody phone! N-No, no!<eos> W-we don't need Lois.<eos> Chris, pretend to answer the phone.<eos> Oh, uh, hello?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, one second.<eos> Mom, it's for you!
♪ 'Cause Tootsie Rolls are all I see ♪<eos> ♪ Whatever it is I think I see ♪<eos> ♪ Becomes a Tootsie Roll to me!<eos> Joe, is something wrong?<eos> I didn't hear you crying in the shower this morning.<eos> I'm just dealing with some stuff at work.<eos> But everything's going so well.<eos> You've been getting all those commendations and my online handmade lip balm business is really taking off.<eos> I don't even know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, I'm proud of you.

It takes a real man to take a hit like that.<eos> Feel better, sport.<eos> How about that?<eos> "Real man."<eos> See?<eos> I told you, Stewie.<eos> You're a big, tough boy.<eos> Yes, I guess I am.<eos> That may be, Stewie.<eos> But if I were you, I'd stay off the field.
Freeze, police!<eos> Too late, Joe.<eos> I already identify with my captors.<eos> Don't hurt Max and Ken.<eos> Holy crap, Joe. That was freaking amazing!<eos> You kicked their ass!<eos> You're right, I guess I did.<eos> And without my help.<eos> See, this is the Joe I remember.<eos> You know, maybe you had it in you all along.
He's her father.<eos> So, you brought your daughter out tonight.<eos> And how old is your teenage daughter?<eos> - I'm 17.<eos> - You're 17!<eos> Well done.<eos> Listen, she has her own voice.<eos> She's, like, "I can speak for myself!<eos> I'm 17 years old!"<eos> Good for you.
I'm, like, "Relax, relax. You've got to relax."<eos> She'd be, like, "I could not be more relaxed."<eos> I'd be, like, "Shh.<eos> Relax."<eos> She'd be, like, "Katherine!<eos> I am already relaxed!"<eos> At which point my dad... who's very big and mean and Irish and didn't let us shout in the house... he'd come stomping up the stairs, like, "Who's shouting in the house?"<eos> And she'd be, like...<eos> "Well, Katherine... told me... to relax."<eos> And he'd be, like, "Well, look at you.
They were, like...<eos> "Where do you live? !"<eos> I was, like, "I live in the U.K."<eos> They were, like, "Cool.<eos> Where's that?" I was, like, "Don't worry about it.<eos> I have a lovely daughter, and I get to travel around doing stand-up comedy."<eos> They were, like, "What? !<eos> That's so weird!<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Like, that job is for a man, and nobody is ever gonna love you if you do it, because it shows how weird you are.

He treats my sister like gold.<eos> He treats me like family.<eos> That's why they got so upset.<eos> But it also means that when Kerrie marries David next month, I am as good as Filipino.<eos> Those fuckers have to accept me.<eos> It's the perfect crime!<eos> It was also a long way around for one sister to go to get the other one out of a jam,<eos> which is why it's such a shame I'm gonna need her to leave him for a Jew soon.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> So, Kerrie, to you, my beautiful baby sister, on your wedding day, I just want to say... relax.
-[Stoick] Hiccup!<eos> Has anyone seen Hiccup?<eos> Hiccup!<eos> Have you seen Hiccup?<eos> Where am I?<eos> There's got to be something sharp.<eos> Come on. Come on. Come on.<eos> He's awake!<eos> Quick, Berthel, knock him out again.<eos> -I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If gold is what you want, Berk has more gold than you can imagine.<eos> Stoick will pay you double what Viggo is offering.<eos> [laughs] Nice try, Hiccup.<eos> Berk has no gold.<eos> Everyone knows that. [laughs]<eos> Who's the fool now?<eos> Gonna swim home with your hands tied?<eos> Now, you can't run either.<eos> -Throk!<eos> -I've been looking all over for you.
Guarantee no kids in Russia or China are doing this goofy crap.<eos> Shame on you for hacking this.<eos> I didn't. Sly must've plugged into their security cameras to download the ceremony to his laptop, which he forgot to close.<eos> I found it running on a loop when I came in.<eos> It's uncomfortable.<eos> I feel guilty watching this.<eos> I feel sick watching it.<eos> Yet no one's looking away.<eos> Good morrow, compatriots!<eos> Good morrow to you, fine sir!
I will call out the readings, you can jot them down?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's funny how you trust me to monitor multimillion-dollar equipment, but not with choosing a wedding dress.<eos> Why do you care that I don't want a maid of honor?<eos> You're being weird about this.<eos> I am not being weird about the maid of honor thing, I'm being weird because,<eos> I don't know, I just thought maybe we'd grown close over the past couple years.<eos> What?<eos> We're-We're friends-ish.<eos> I like you just fine.
It's just that all the flowers and pink taffeta, it's just not my bag.<eos> I'm a genius, not a cheerleader.<eos> Not how I meant it to sound.<eos> It depends.<eos> Did you mean it to sound obnoxious and rude?<eos> 'Cause if so, you were right on the money.<eos> It came out wrong.<eos> No, it came out accurately.<eos> You-You guys love facts, you just stated one.<eos> You're a genius. I'm a dumb cheerleader, and I'm too stupid to be friends with you.
The vapor trail indicates we need to adjust the barrel one degree east.<eos> Copy that.<eos> All right, stand back and watch the magic.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Are you kidding me, Cabe?<eos> I've seen better magic at birthday parties.<eos> We're getting tired.<eos> We only have five seconds left until...<eos> It's working.<eos> It's turning. Cabe, I never doubted you for one moment, my man.
Hate being dolled up.<eos> My least-favorite first lady, Dolly Madison.<eos> I tried dresses and makeup, but it's not me.<eos> I don't want to disappoint Toby.<eos> This big wedding is important to him, and meeting his family is stressful enough.<eos> Doing it while I'm pretending to be something I'm not...<eos> Happy, I just wanted to make things easier for you.<eos> I couldn't care less if we were picking out a Vera Wang or a Black Decker.<eos> I know Toby could care less, too.<eos> 'Cause that wing nut is crazy in love with you.
All right, all right, that's it, if the only way I can end this madness is to actually pick someone to stand up for me on my big day, I'm gonna do it.<eos> Because, listen, I...<eos> I want the real deal.<eos> I want someone who's always dependable.<eos> Someone who can adapt when things get hairy.<eos> I want someone who comes up with solutions when it seems there are none.<eos> I want someone who, in short, is sharp as a tack.<eos> So...<eos> I want a best ma'am.<eos> Paige, if it wasn't for you on that cable today, I wouldn't have a Happy to marry.
I got time to take a stab at that to-do list with you. The night's wide open.<eos> No, it's not, 'cause you're gonna go play Nerd World with Sly and the putz-around gang.<eos> No, I told Sly I can't make it.<eos> You never said you couldn't make it, you said you didn't want to go, and broke his dork heart.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> He just wanted to pay me back for helping save his clubhouse.<eos> He-He didn't have to do that. I was glad to do it.<eos> He's not trying to pay you back. He's trying to be your friend, dummy.<eos> Sometimes if someone is your friend, you let them do stuff for you, like give you a cloak or help plan a wedding, even if you don't want it.<eos> 'Cause it's not about you, it's about them, and them feeling good about being a good friend.
No, I didn't.<eos> He just wanted to pay me back for helping save his clubhouse.<eos> He-He didn't have to do that. I was glad to do it.<eos> He's not trying to pay you back.

I don't know.<eos> I'm a genius. I am new to this feeling stuff.<eos> Like it or not, you have a funny way of growing on people, old man.<eos> Sly got close to you during the campaign, and now that it's over, he's scared.
How are you still here?<eos> Did you really think you could turn my own son against me?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Why are you crashing my daughter's wedding day?<eos> Because Emma and I are destined to fight.<eos> Light and dark must have their reckoning.<eos> Unless, of course...<eos> What?<eos> Unless you give me your heart now and save us both the trouble of fighting the Final Battle.<eos> You really think I'll just surrender to you.
This is the only way.<eos> It's all right, Emma.<eos> At least one of us is getting our happy ending.<eos> Just get it over with.<eos> No.<eos> Why won't you die?<eos> 'Cause her heart's stronger than you think.<eos> Henry, what are you doing here?<eos> You don't have to be afraid of being alone because you never have been.<eos> Look. Their song has been inside you the whole time.
It's not important. What matters is you were with me.<eos> You were with me my whole life!<eos> [laughs]<eos> Swan. Killian!<eos> [Archie] Are you ready to recite your vows?<eos> Emma, when we met, there was just one thing that mattered to me...<eos> And you did something that no one else ever could.<eos> You showed me that a heart full of love was the most precious treasure of all, and one that I don't intend to lose.<eos> They say that a captain's heart belongs to his ship.<eos> And with this ring, it now belongs to you.

"Oh, my God."<eos> "This tour bus is so clean.<eos> Who made that bed right there?<eos> Who made that bed right there?<eos> Who made that bed right there?"<eos> You know?<eos> Like, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then I would say, "I made that bed."<eos> And they would be like, "We love you now." And I'm like...
Why can't you be like your cousin Peggy?"<eos> "She's graduating college. Why can't you?"<eos> People don't understand, when you grow up between two cultures of any kind, it's hard because you start realizing that certain things you do that are considered, you know, like, American are ridiculous to the other side of your family.<eos> I had to ask my mom for permission to go on spring break to go swim with the dolphins, right?<eos> "Mom, can I go swim with the dolphins?"<eos> "What's that?"<eos> "How much is that?"<eos> "$200."<eos> "Do you get to eat the fucking thing after?"<eos> "No, go, and then when your brothers are hungry, we'll show them a picture of you riding the dolphin."
"If you're like this first generation and you're one of the few that's doing the first of everything in your family, do something, do the first of something.<eos> Tell this woman what you think of them, what you think of this person.<eos> Tell her how you feel."<eos> I thought, "Can I tell my mom how I really feel?"<eos> And I thought, "If not now, when?"<eos> I went inside to her room... and she looked different.<eos> Sometimes they don't tell you that they'll look different.<eos> And the moment I saw her... I cried.<eos> And I was like...<eos> "I love you.
And I thought, "If not now, when?"<eos> I went inside to her room... and she looked different.<eos> Sometimes they don't tell you that they'll look different.<eos> And the moment I saw her... I cried.<eos> And I was like...<eos> "I love you.<eos> You're the most important person in my life.<eos> Everything I do, I do to honor your journey.<eos> And if I could bargain with God...<eos> I would shorten my life so that you could have a longer one, and I would take care of you until you died and make sure that you had the happiest life ever."
So a massive barrier was constructed, to protect the rest of North America, but new breeds have started to appear, so we reassembled our team.<eos> We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids and a brutal terrorist with a plan to end the human race.<eos> The fight for mankind's survival has just begun.<eos> Previously on Zoo...<eos> I want what you want...<eos> To find the person who bombed my precinct and your camp.<eos> I ID'd the bomber.<eos> Her name is Abigail Westbrook.<eos> Jackson, she's your sister.<eos> My father's alive, and he needs you, Jamie.
You gave a 14-year-old a b...<eos> A b...<eos> We need to do this now.<eos> Leanne.<eos> Leanne Ducovny.<eos> Where are the children going?<eos> Leanne, over here.<eos> Let me help you with that.<eos> Abe.<eos> After you had the affair, I couldn't look at you.
Let me help you with that.<eos> Abe.<eos> After you had the affair, I couldn't look at you.<eos> Every time I tried, all I saw was betrayal.<eos> So I started to focus on Isaac, tried to see you through our boy's eyes.<eos> As a mother.<eos> A good mother.<eos> That got me through.<eos> But now, Isaac is gone.<eos> I don't know how to look at you anymore.
We'll find another way to get Isaac back.<eos> What's this?<eos> Mom?<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Let's go, hurry up!<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> - Come on, get out.<eos> - Dad, help! Go, go, go.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Gus.<eos> Honey, I'm right here, I'm right behind you.
Especially the Shepherd hunters, they nearly caught me, killed me numerous times, so I came west, changed my name, kept moving, and then I met you.<eos> I know this is hard to believe, but I promise you, the man that you've spent the last three years with, that's who I really am, okay?<eos> You didn't just... make me forget about my past, you made me see a future.<eos> A future with you.<eos> Why are you telling me this right now?<eos> We're about to go to Mexico to find Abigail and those hybrids.<eos> Because... Abigail Westbrook... is my sister.<eos> I didn't even know I had a sister.<eos> You know, I couldn't stop my father, but maybe I can stop her.<eos> And I need you.

You know exactly what it is, man.<eos> A freaking cop?<eos> I should've known.<eos> Yeah, you're not that smart.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> You're not the first to get played.<eos> Yeah, well, when I put the word out, I'll be the last.<eos> Word's not going out.<eos> Go ahead, man, send me to prison.<eos> It's nothing. But every hitter in the city's gonna be coming for you.
Okay. Well, this is what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna call Rush.<eos> Yeah. You gonna tell him where to meet you.<eos> And you're gonna introduce me as your new connect.<eos> No, no, no, pass.<eos> See, the funny thing is, you seem to think that you have a choice.<eos> Aw. Mom has a Benz.<eos> Funny thing is, nobody's working in that household.<eos> And if you go away, so does their lifestyle.<eos> Man, I trusted you!
You're right.<eos> We took a hit on the deal.<eos> But I can get the cash tomorrow no problem.<eos> But I need it tonight.<eos> That sting created a time issue for my partner.<eos> He's blaming me for the lost shipment, wants double his money back.<eos> Wow. Didn't think the great King had a partner.<eos> Lately, he's been thinking that he's the one that's in charge, making demands.<eos> It's disrespectful, and, frankly, it's time for him to go.<eos> So what are you saying? You want me to take care of him for you?
I was just... thinking about Asakeem and the thousand ways<eos> And, honestly, I can't even imagine how you feel.<eos> To be honest with you, I don't feel anything.<eos> It's not Asakeem, it's not Sullivan, it's not any of the hundreds of others.<eos> I chose this job. And I choose to be okay with it.<eos> Wow.<eos> I mean, that's just really... evolved of you. I'm just...<eos> I got to be honest, I'm not there.<eos> I just want to... break all his fingers.<eos> And the other thing, too is that I have you.
Sometimes you got to let go and just trust it.<eos> You must be worried to take such extreme countermeasures.<eos> Be exposed to the open road like this. Mm-hmm.<eos> My brothers will find me anywhere.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't say I'm worried.<eos> We're just kind of taking this opportunity to... show my lady friend here the beautiful countryside.<eos> Unless you want me to soil this car, I'm gonna need a bathroom break.<eos> That's why you don't bring a terrorist on a road trip.<eos> They ruin everything.<eos> ♪ You're the one that I want ♪ ♪ You are the one I want ♪
What's up, fam?<eos> Everything's great, man.<eos> Thank you for handling that thing over in Inglewood.<eos> Those dudes started pressing a brother real hard.<eos> Well, you know, they mess with you, they messing' with me, right?<eos> No doubt.<eos> So, uh, what's up?<eos> You in the market for something new?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh, getting a little hardware for my lady here.<eos> Aw, look at you.
You in the market for something new?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh, getting a little hardware for my lady here.<eos> Aw, look at you.<eos> Winner, winner.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Aw, I'm the real winner here.<eos> I thought you was a loner, bro.<eos> Yeah, well, I wised up, man.<eos> You should, too.<eos> I don't know about that. But I got something for you.
All that matters is they're off the streets.<eos> You can thank me later.<eos> How long can we bat cleanup?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's hope that Sam gets that distributor before we have to find out.<eos> How long has Sam known about this guy?<eos> And... what happens if we weren't here?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Sam knows what he's doing, and he trusts us to have his back and we had it.<eos> My gut was right about you.
Wilson admitted to being King's distributor.<eos> Sam's clear to take her down.<eos> Sam, you say the word and the team's coming in.<eos> It's a go.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Load up.<eos> Switch, you ride with me.<eos> Nobody touches Zeus.<eos> He's mine.<eos> Yeah, I'm right behind you.
Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.<eos> In an attempt to return the planet to the animals, a secretive group called The Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity.<eos> And then, lab-made creatures... Called hybrids...<eos> Devastated the West Coast.<eos> So a massive barrier was constructed to protect the rest of North America... but new breeds have started to appear, so we're trying to reassemble our team.<eos> We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids.<eos> The fight for mankind's survival has just begun.<eos> - Previously on Zoo...<eos> - It's me, Clem.<eos> My father's alive, and he needs you, Jamie.
You want to sit this one out?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Thanks, Tony.<eos> I'll take him from here.<eos> This way.<eos> Look who's here.<eos> Hey, I got a couple of those.<eos> Nice hardware.<eos> That's not for you.
- Memory hotspot comin' up.<eos> All right, you're on the move, Sally.<eos> I'm... on a street somewhere. It's...<eos> It's in New York, I think.<eos> It's... it's foggy.<eos> Sabine!<eos> Weather foggy or brain foggy?<eos> I told you, please don't worry about me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You take care of your parents, we'll take care of you.
I am not working with my father.<eos> He made me think there was this big plan to get the family all back together, but...<eos> Kirsten was right.<eos> He's absolutely psychotic.<eos> Linus, um, I've got class.<eos> If you wanna practice GarageBand or learn basic programming, stay.<eos> If you wanna keep grilling me about my dad, it's not gonna happen.<eos> Look, first, GarageBand is really cool.<eos> And second, no more grilling. I...<eos> I believe you.

Hello?<eos> - Nasty, right? - Uh, yeah.<eos> Ejected from his car during a high-speed chase, landed on a freeway sign 20 feet off the ground. - Ugh.<eos> - Nice shootin', Tex.<eos> Uh, I'm looking for the M.E.?<eos> Oh, well, you found her.<eos> Amanda Weston.<eos> You must be Camille Engelson, from the NSA, right?<eos> I hear you're snarky.<eos> Well, what does that make you?
Sure.<eos> Why Cameron?<eos> You mean why not you?<eos> Whoever runs this place, their first job... is to protect the team.<eos> "Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise"?<eos> That is a bad policy in our business, and can get people killed.<eos> - I made a mistake.<eos> - Yes. You did.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look at you, big boss man.
- I made a mistake.<eos> - Yes. You did.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look at you, big boss man.<eos> Yeah, I have a feeling this isn't gonna be one of those fun promotions.<eos> Oh, well, as long as you don't abuse your authority and start ordering tests on me.<eos> Kirsten... everything I do is because I care about you.<eos> Deeply.<eos> I need to know why you think you heard what you heard in that stitch.<eos> I need to know that stitching is safe for you.

Oh, this is nice.<eos> Oh, yeah, it's got that back support.<eos> Ahh. Oh gosh, I could get used to this. Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, let me see.<eos> Mm... yeah, you're right, it's very comfortable.<eos> Hey, I wanted to thank you for taking me to your mom.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> I know, but I'm glad I did.<eos> I just... I didn't...<eos> I didn't feel right about keeping that from you.
- Mmm. - She's hungover.<eos> I resent the implication.<eos> You texting Ivy?<eos> Ivy?<eos> Ohh, did I know you guys were a thing?<eos> Uh, we're just texting.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Let me see that real quick.<eos> "Hey, Ivy, Camille here."<eos> "Just wanted to let you know that Maggie bitch-slapped me for saying I trusted you."
All right, let's button this up like a Hollywood pre-nup.<eos> Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.<eos> In three, two, one, mark!<eos> How long have you been screwing her for, Mark?<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> - Don't you lie to me!<eos> I'm in Broden's apartment.<eos> He and his wife are arguing, she's accusing him of having an affair.<eos> How long have you been screwing her for, Mark?<eos> I consulted with her, but I did it for you!

You wanna go back to your place?<eos> Oh, Camille wanted the house to herself tonight.<eos> She's having "company."<eos> Oh, well.<eos> It's so much harder than I thought it would be.<eos> What... You thought us not being together would be easier?<eos> You hear how that sounds, don't you?<eos> What?<eos> How could you say that to me?<eos> Do you know how long I waited for you?

You thought us not being together would be easier?<eos> You hear how that sounds, don't you?<eos> What?<eos> How could you say that to me?<eos> Do you know how long I waited for you?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Not nearly as long as I was willing to wait for you, and I'm still willing to wait for you - if that's what you need, but...
With my heart breaking because we can't be together.<eos> - That was incredible.<eos> - I knew you'd like it.<eos> Mind blowing.<eos> Well, 2001:<eos> A Space Odyssey is pretty much the mind blowing Godfather of sci-fi cinema.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, no, no, thank Stanley Kubrick.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.
Oh, I know.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> - How are those oxytocin levels?<eos> - Holding steady. Yours?<eos> Never lower.<eos> Camille: You're doing it all wrong.<eos> - What?<eos> - The walk of shame.<eos> There's no walk. There's no shame.<eos> I gotta say, I give you and Cameron a lot of credit for holding out as long as you did before finally throwing oxytocin to the wind in favor of the other big "O."
- What?<eos> - The walk of shame.<eos> There's no walk. There's no shame.<eos> I gotta say, I give you and Cameron a lot of credit for holding out as long as you did before finally throwing oxytocin to the wind in favor of the other big "O."<eos> We didn't.<eos> It was more like Kubrick, a kiss, and a cuddle.<eos> We're keeping things very PG around here.<eos> - And your night?<eos> Hard "R."<eos> Cameron's really able to keep his hands off you?
Why shoot off his finger?<eos> Maybe the killer was trying to make a point.<eos> No pun intended.<eos> Maybe I should pilot this.<eos> Both:<eos> No.<eos> You might still have a little performance anxiety.<eos> She means in a stitch kind of way.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's the only frame of reference I have on you.
- No, let her poke around.<eos> - Camille.<eos> My stitch, my rules.<eos> My lab, my orders.<eos> Mission clock's running.<eos> Got a memory hotspot in another region that's mapped a little better.<eos> - Move her.<eos> - Linus...<eos> Isolate memory image and grab what you can, thanks.<eos> Did I make a mistake trusting you?
You okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - What were you two playing at?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Reckless or stupid?<eos> Oh, I don't like your tone, Goodkin.<eos> You kept Kirsten in an unmapped area for longer than I wanted to, so are you reckless or stupid?<eos> Well, that depends.<eos> Are you the lab director or a flustered boyfriend?<eos> Neither. Right now, I'm the guy who's wondering if he was wrong for trusting you.
I'm pretty sure I don't need any help.<eos> It's on a high shelf. You're my pocket bae.<eos> Tall-ish Linus to the rescue.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> Please don't hurt Camille.<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> From someone who really cares about her.<eos> - You mean, like me? - I mean me.<eos> What do you mean, "what is my game?"<eos> You heard me, sweetheart, I don't trust you.
Why don't you guys run off and Chloe and I will swap horror stories.<eos> We won't be long.<eos> - Is there wine?<eos> - Yes, loads.<eos> Take your time.<eos> - We won't be too long.<eos> I hope.<eos> - Camille...<eos> - Oh, God, please don't make it a thing.<eos> I was going to say that I'm happy for you.
_<eos> Mimi?<eos> Nice to meet you, Uncle Nico.<eos> What does this have to do with Ruby?<eos> Everything. And nothing.<eos> If I get locked up, who's gonna be the man in Ruby's life? You?<eos> Stay here.<eos> Lost him?<eos> Yeah, but we found each other again.<eos> Life got dull without you.
I'll take her home, and then I'll give you a call.<eos> We'll get the charges in front of Judge Vasquez before he has his morning coffee.<eos> No leaks to the press until we indict. - Okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> You ready?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I put the man's brother on death row. - I know.<eos> - So what does he want from you?
Two days after his mother ambushed me in front of my office. But let's move on.<eos> What kind of story calls for dressing up like a $10 hooker and burning suspects alive in the middle of the night?<eos> We had a chance to catch him, and we caught him.<eos> "We?"<eos> Yeah, me and the police.<eos> And Nico Jackson.<eos> I've had an hour of sleep in three days...<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> I'm just trying to understand.<eos> You know I'm proud of you.
If you let him go, he will kill Serena.<eos> You have gone completely out of your mind!<eos> - You don't understand. - Then tell me!<eos> You have no i...<eos> No! No! No!<eos> No, you can't let him go!<eos> - Laura... - No!<eos> Laura...<eos> If you get arrested, what do I tell Serena?<eos> I will fix this for you.
You don't know what you've done.<eos> I love you.<eos> We won't let him out of our sight.<eos> We have to be at the hospital when Mimi comes to.<eos> I don't trust the police. We'll call Jenny.<eos> She'll stay on top of Haskell. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Why is your hand on my person?<eos> Oh, I have a trainload of questions and you, as a person of interest in this screwed-up case, aren't going anywhere until I get answers.<eos> All right. How about we downgrade my classification to witness?<eos> See, the attorney for the suspect is planning on leveling very serious charges against you...
An uninformed observer might look at it this way:<eos> Disgraced excop steals a motorcycle, winds up in an alley where a girl turns up dead.<eos> Next night, commits violent assault in an apartment where a girl turns up all but dead.<eos> So, you want to help me out here, or you want me to act uninformed?<eos> Inspector Kupner, do you want to come in here and write up Mr. Jackson on charges of vehicular theft, please?<eos> Won't be the first time you interpreted the facts to suit the needs of the moment.<eos> Really?<eos> Are we still there?<eos> Five years, we ever left "there"?<eos> Look, if you are still blaming me for, what... not "cutting you some slack," not "fixing" it for you, then you are not the man that I still, on no evidence whatsoever,
Second floor!<eos> The cops want to talk to you!<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Where's DeBray?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He came by to say hello, and then he took off.<eos> That's not his apartment?<eos> Why would I be in his apartment?<eos> Should I sing you a lullaby?<eos> Like your little boy never heard from you?
Please?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've been crazy with this story.<eos> But it's over now.<eos> It's done.<eos> Is it over for Nico Jackson?<eos> I need you to trust me that nothing happened and that I'm done running around being certifiably insane.<eos> If there's something you don't have... that you're searching for out there...<eos> I want you to find it right here.<eos> There's some music that you need to face.
Ladies, you're dog-tired, you just want to fall asleep.<eos> And he's there behind you.<eos> "Baby.<eos> Baby.<eos> Baby.<eos> "What?"<eos> "Are you sleeping?"<eos> "Yeah, I'm trying.<eos> What do you want?"<eos> "I want you, baby.
I've wanted you all night.<eos> Oh, I want you so bad.<eos> You look so good right now.<eos> In that nightgown and your curlers, girl.<eos> I just want you so bad right now."<eos> "Oh, baby.<eos> Thank you for thinking I'm beautiful even though I'm in my curlers, but, please, can we talk about this tomorrow?<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> Baby, aren't you tired?"<eos> "I'm never tired for you, girl.
- Oh, right, yeah. - Right.<eos> Yeah, I'm-a go down there and say hello to him.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stick 'em up.<eos> Richie De Santo.<eos> I thought that was you, man.<eos> How you doing? - Lou.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look at you in your civies.
Your Uncle Clay sent some people to kill us, too, you remember that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Son, I've make plenty of mistakes.<eos> And I'm not ashamed of 'em, I don't deny 'em. Made a lot of mistakes.<eos> I'm just like anybody else.<eos> However... putting Clay Maxwell where he is now was not one of 'em.<eos> Okay?<eos> Son, let me explain something to you.<eos> The time is coming in your life where you're gonna have to make a lot of important decisions.<eos> Decisions that are gonna make you unpopular sometimes, decisions that are gonna make people not like you.
Okay.<eos> You okay, Dad?<eos> I'm fine, son, I'm fine.<eos> I'm just in the bathroom.<eos> I'll be out in a minute.<eos> I ordered some extra room service.<eos> You know, I-I got you some cannolis, and...<eos> What happens in Chicago, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm really proud of you, Dad.
I know.<eos> Clearly, the boy's an idiot.<eos> Papa.<eos> You know how many times I... I had to ask your grandmother out before she agreed to a date?<eos> Huh.<eos> 17.<eos> Okay, well, nowadays, they call that stalking.<eos> Well, 63 years married.<eos> I must have done something right.<eos> I'm just saying that if this young man really wanted a serious relationship with you, he would have fought for you.
I'm working outside.<eos> Pay's decent.<eos> And at the end of the day, I get to come home to my beautiful "Smokeshow" of a wife.<eos> Excuse me, what now?<eos> "Smokeshow."<eos> That's what the guys on the crew call you.<eos> Oh, really. Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, I think we're gonna have to cut this down to maybe once a week, then.<eos> Seriously, Adam.<eos> You know you could do anything and I'd be proud of you.
That's fantastic news.<eos> Go, Danny.<eos> Good for him. Adam?<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing, Steve?<eos> How you doing?<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah. Good to see you.<eos> You, too.
Yeah. But you do believe my time has a value attached to it?<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> I-I guess.<eos> You guess.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're an expert among experts, okay?<eos> Sam has told us that you've executed and designed pyro for the biggest movies in Hollywood.<eos> Believe me.<eos> We understand your time is valuable.<eos> I like you, Kensi.
That's det cord.<eos> Yeah, that's the explosive they used.<eos> You see that yellow cord with the two black stripes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not a hundred percent, because of all the various suppliers, but for my money, yellow cord with two black stripes comes from PWX Supplies in the Valley.<eos> Wow. Nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much, Lincoln.<eos> Anytime.<eos> You got off easy with the coffee.
Feels like a James Bond movie.<eos> Easy.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Little advice. Hmm?<eos> If you ever want to see a paycheck, fill out your W-4 ASAP and give it to the guy that...<eos> Vic...<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm starting to think that... someone doesn't like you.
Left foot forward, together. Oh, there it is.<eos> Yup. Right foot back, together, forward...<eos> - Ti-Tight. Loosen the grip. Just...<eos> - I'm trying. How are you feeling?<eos> I mean, I'm feeling a bit like David Hasselhoff on Dancing with the Stars.<eos> No, you're killing it.<eos> Am I?<eos> Next, you're gonna spin me.<eos> I'm gonna spin you.<eos> Under the arm and then and back to you.
"Don't blame the doctors or the nurses, "but I've had enough of hospitals for one life, "and I have some unfinished business to take care of.<eos> Be safe... OG..."<eos> Admiral Albert Jethro Chegwidden.<eos> Former Navy SEAL, commander of JAG.<eos> Henrietta called, said she was in trouble, so here I am-- once more into the breach.<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Southern California weather, we have low clouds and dense fog overnight into our mid-morning hours.<eos> Visibility, in some cases, is...<eos> Good morning.<eos> You have yourself a beautiful day.<eos> Good morning to you.
What do you mean?<eos> Um, well...<eos> You have a lot of memories from there, too.<eos> I was in that coma for weeks, but... you were awake for all of it.<eos> Please, I'm good.<eos> You know, my part was...<eos> my part was easy.<eos> I just showed up, ate the Jell-O and proposed to a girl in a coma.<eos> Yeah, I'm serious.<eos> You were there for me the entire time, and I wasn't there for you.
Sam?<eos> I'll take Bridges.<eos> All right.<eos> Admiral Chegwidden, you're with me.<eos> Leaves you and me, Langston.<eos> Oh, no, this is not gonna happen.<eos> Look, you can either do it our way, or you can spend the day reaching out to your contacts trying to get out of our lockup.<eos> Keep up, young lady.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> That goes double for you.
- Glad you came.<eos> - Oh. I won't lie, I was surprised when you said you wanted to meet, 'cause the last I heard, I was bad luck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm still not convinced you aren't.<eos> But I might not be sitting here today if you hadn't been there.<eos> You helped me hang on.<eos> Oh, come on, I did what anyone would do in that situation.<eos> No...<eos> I'm not too big to admit when I was wrong.<eos> Sorry I doubted you.
I'm on it.<eos> How you feeling about your friend hunkering down now?<eos> He's not out of the country yet.<eos> For your sake, let's hope not.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, I love a good stroll as much as the next guy, but why me?<eos> Well, because I need your help.<eos> As hard as it is to admit, you may be the only one I can trust right now.<eos> What kind of help you looking for?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> But I need to know if I can trust you when the time comes.
In exchange for a reduced sentence.<eos> But he only wants to speak to you.<eos> He needs a familiar face, someone he can trust.<eos> We'll drop Kamran off at the bus stop, then we'll head over to Oakville.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> All right, this is everything the CIA has on Zhrov.<eos> He's always maintained deep ties to the Kremlin.<eos> When I was undercover, he was handling all of Isaak Sidorov's arms-dealing operations.<eos> Oh, yeah. I remember.<eos> Wasn't this Sidorov guy in love with you?
He's not hurting him. Let him answer.<eos> Nobody paid me!<eos> That's a lie!<eos> We know you set my wife up to be here.<eos> It was not.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Maybe you didn't know where this was headed when you signed up.<eos> You give us a name now, it's gonna make a huge difference how this plays out for you.
That's illegal.<eos> I understand that.<eos> No one has to know.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> I won't need that long.<eos> Eric, you should be seeing this.<eos> Got it. Downloading now.<eos> They must have followed you and Michelle home from the prison, but we still can't find them on any nearby traffic cams.
Zhrov, you tried to escape, jumped from the car, ran, and got shot from behind, got it?<eos> I did four years in Russian Nazarovo prison.<eos> Makes Pelican Bay feel like a country club full of women.<eos> I'm not talking.<eos> Feel like a country club now?<eos> This is a simple piece of rope.<eos> But it is the difference between life and death.<eos> You tell this man everything he needs to know and you get it.<eos> Fool around and you're surely gonna die, my friend.<eos> So, I would really, really try and stay conscious if I were you.
Don't be afraid to lose visuals. I got him from up here.<eos> We need him to feel safe.<eos> He's heading south on Western.<eos> I got him. You can peel off.<eos> Handing off.<eos> He's yours.<eos> He's turning west on Lemon Grove.<eos> Too close. Stay back.<eos> We scare him, this isn't going to work.<eos> Coming up behind you.
I got a flight to take you to Kamran and Aiden.<eos> Already spoke to 'em.<eos> They know I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> Sam, their mother just died.<eos> Me going there is not gonna bring her back.<eos> Right now I have to find Tahir and whoever it is that did this.<eos> You know we're not gonna be allowed to work on this case in any official capacity.<eos> Who's gonna stop me?<eos> Go to your kids.<eos> They need you now more than anything.
Deeks, plug that phone into the Audi's tablet. Okay,<eos> I'll bring up Sam's voice mail, start scrubbing through for mission recordings.<eos> Okay, you know what, uh, I don't have an adaptor.<eos> It should be in your kit.<eos> Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what you guys are doing, but whatever it is, you need to hurry.<eos> Come on, Deeks.<eos> Trying.<eos> This is Sam, leave a message.<eos> This is Sam. They don't have it.<eos> Eric, sending to you now.
Sam, what are you doing?<eos> Sam, listen...<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> Tahir contacted us.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Come with me, I'll take you there.<eos> Don't play me, G. I'm not playing you, but we have to hurry.<eos> Tell me where he is.<eos> Not unless you promise to do this with me.<eos> It's not about you.

I'm not playing you, but we have to hurry.<eos> Tell me where he is.<eos> Not unless you promise to do this with me.<eos> It's not about you.<eos> If it's about you, it's about me and everyone else on this team.
Please, have a seat in the back.<eos> Tahir must be on the bus.<eos> Anyone have eyes on him?<eos> Yeah, he's near the back, but we got civilians on there, too.<eos> Kens, you got a shot?<eos> I don't, I'm blocked.<eos> Eric, do not lose that bus.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> I'll follow with Nell.<eos> I saved you a seat, Sam Hanna.
Yeah, he's near the back, but we got civilians on there, too.<eos> Kens, you got a shot?<eos> I don't, I'm blocked.<eos> Eric, do not lose that bus.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> I'll follow with Nell.<eos> I saved you a seat, Sam Hanna.<eos> Now, I suggest you refrain from any attempt at heroism, or my colleagues on board will start shooting the other passengers.<eos> Now give me your hand.<eos> I have something for you.
Let's take a look at this thing.<eos> Well, I got to be honest, I thought that, uh, thought it'd have a little more bling to it.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You know me.<eos> I'm more bang than bling.<eos> That's right.<eos> Sunshine and gunpowder.<eos> My life will never be the same without her.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm here for you.
Where would he stay?<eos> We already have Stuart.<eos> Well, we can make some space in the garage.<eos> Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.<eos> That sounds awful.<eos> Let's hope he thinks so, too.<eos> For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.<eos> Wow. I'm starting to think you didn't mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey, uh, so we've been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we'd be happy to fix up the garage for you.
I realize it's irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I'm feeling a bit replaced.<eos> Well, this isn't an easy time for him.<eos> He's losing his apartment, he's in debt, he's probably humiliated.<eos> Yes, probably.<eos> But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?<eos> Can I get anyone anything at all?<eos> Raj, you don't have to serve us.<eos> It's the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.<eos> It was really no problem.<eos> Not for you, Box of Towels.
- Wait, is anything gonna jump out...<eos> - No.<eos> I already asked.<eos> Thank you, Sheldon.<eos> It's a... blank notebook.<eos> Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I'm sure you will, too.<eos> He also never had sex in that room.<eos> That's something else to look forward to.<eos> This means a lot.<eos> Well, I know this is a difficult time for you.
So, relax.<eos> We're happy to have you.<eos> Thank you, but how do I know you're not saying that just to be nice?<eos> Do you actually pay for that haircut?<eos> That'll do it.<eos> Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology.<eos> Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?<eos> Sheldon, she's fine.<eos> Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she's stuffed.<eos> Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.
It's just Raj.<eos> You can hit him with the bat, but it's fine.<eos> And if my heart stops, just let me go.<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting.<eos> I just wanted to go someplace where I wasn't causing problems.<eos> I'll say it again.<eos> India.<eos> Can I just stay in the garage?<eos> Don't do that. We'll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
Never should've had all these kids so close together.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Beverly believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.<eos> Is that bothering you?<eos> Yes. I don't care for unconscious thoughts.<eos> My brain and I are best friends.<eos> It should tell me everything.<eos> I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.
If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.<eos> Wouldn't you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?<eos> Better than I feel in their steam shower?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Penny would be the entree.<eos> Then Leonard's basically a cheese course.<eos> And because I love you, you're dessert.<eos> I want to say "aw," but I'm gonna say "ew."<eos> No, you see, I'm doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.<eos> Good for you.
If I could just check one more...<eos> Already cleared the browser history.<eos> You're a good woman.<eos> What you working on?<eos> Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.<eos> Oh, that's right, maternity leave's almost over.<eos> Ah, you excited?<eos> Yeah, I mean, I'll miss halley, but it'll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated.<eos> Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.<eos> That's great, good for you.
But he's a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.<eos> Oh, quick!<eos> Sit!<eos> So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.<eos> Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show.<eos> People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I couldn't help myself.<eos> I guess I just love love.<eos> Well, I'm very happy for you.
Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective.<eos> Get this, people are calling it<eos> "the longest one yet""<eos> Hello? Anybody home?<eos> Is that Bert?<eos> It's Bert.<eos> I think it's Bert.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I broke up with Rebecca.<eos> - Oh. You know, good for you.
Do not touch that phone.<eos> Penny?<eos> Oh, Zack. Hey.<eos> What are the odds of running into you here?<eos> Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.<eos> Uh, what's new?<eos> Oh, tons of stuff.<eos> Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.<eos> Well, congratulations. That's what my dermatologist said.<eos> No, on-on getting engaged, good for you.
Yeah, right? I got a lot of menu jokes, but that's my favorite.<eos> All right, this is everything.<eos> What do you want to learn?<eos> It really doesn't matter, as long as it's challenging.<eos> Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up... magic.<eos> Howard, I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.<eos> So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?<eos> Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding.<eos> Have you ever tried to juggle?<eos> Yes, I'm juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.
Yes, but that's gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.<eos> Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.<eos> Again...<eos> I would never let Howard work with an ex.<eos> What, you wouldn't trust him?<eos> I wouldn't trust her.<eos> He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.<eos> Yeah, that-that is the sexiest dog.<eos> And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job I was uncomfortable with.<eos> 'Cause he's scared of you? Terrified.
Well, I don't love it, but if you really want to take this job, I'll find a way to deal with it.<eos> No, I know you'll try, but it'll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and...<eos> I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're-you're unhappy there and then you're gonna blame me for making you stay, and it's fine, I'll just... I'll suck it up.<eos> You don't need to do that, it's okay.<eos> Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I'm being selfish and holding you back.<eos> What?<eos> Say something.<eos> Yeah, that is pretty annoying.<eos> I made you tea.
And peter, you, too.<eos> Shut down that truck and get inside.<eos> Lois, I already told you.<eos> I don't want to eat your garbage food.<eos> All right?<eos> Now can you go inside and get me some pop rocks?<eos> I'm making a paella.<eos> You know what?<eos> Enough of this nonsense.<eos> You love this truck so much, stay in it, 'cause I don't want you or your food in the house.
I love this truck.<eos> I got everything I need in here.<eos> Maybe I'll just live here.<eos> I can imagine it now.<eos> Whoops. I stopped thinking about the truck. And started thinking about amazon woman.<eos> Brigitte nielsen drunk in a burbank park.<eos> All right, time to greet the day.<eos> Are you living in a truck?<eos> I see you got a hooters calendar in here.<eos> How do you get anything done. With those rocking knockers staring at you?
Oh, chris, I'm so sorry you got hurt like this.<eos> Roller derby was the best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> I finally felt like I was good at something, I made friends...<eos> But seeing you like this, I realize you were right.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> So I'm going to quit.<eos> No, meg.<eos> I got hurt because I didn't belong out there, But you do.<eos> I watched you skate.<eos> You found your calling and I believe in you.
Nobody look.<eos> This is a private, gross matter.<eos> Mr. Griffin, is this performance art. Or, uh, some sort of political statement?<eos> Well, I'm kind of ticked about condoms in porn, But this is unrelated.<eos> Oh, hey, lois.<eos> I guess you must be happy.<eos> Yeah, it's every girl's dream to have her husband hoisted. Out of a food truck in a horse harness.<eos> No, look, I-i'm just saying, you were right.<eos> I'm a big tub of lard, And you have every reason to be ashamed of me.<eos> Ashamed of you?
Ashamed of you?<eos> I-is that really what you think?<eos> Well, yeah, you kept saying how overweight I am.<eos> Peter, don't you get it?<eos> I only wanted you to eat healthy because I love you, And I'm concerned about your health.<eos> I want you around for as long as I'm around.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I love you, too, lois.<eos> I'm sorry I was such a jerk.<eos> I guess I could do without eating so much junk, But I could never do without you.
You kept me sane.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have been closest friends.<eos> Don't leave your friend for THEM.<eos> Tiberius!<eos> If Jim is your friend why did we find him unconscious in cryostasis?<eos> We wandered for over two centuries.<eos> He would have died if I hadn't preserved him until I could get him home.<eos> I AM home!<eos> Thanks to you.
He is, for all intents and purposes, real.<eos> Sir, we can't stay here too long.<eos> We're being bombarded by Hawking radiation.<eos> Kirk to Scott.<eos> Can we allocate more power to the shield grid?<eos> Aye, but I found something I think you should see.<eos> Meet me in sickbay.<eos> Sulu, you have the conn.<eos> Captain...<eos> I need you here on the bridge studying the rift, Avi.
Please stop, Jim.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Please!<eos> Don't!<eos> Jim!<eos> Sleep.<eos> Enterprise to Defiant.<eos> Enterprise to Defiant.<eos> Kirk here.<eos> I know how hard that was for you, captain.
Wait!<eos> It's no good.<eos> It's totally dried up.<eos> But it's such a thick pipe.<eos> Zuru.<eos> The watchtower?<eos> The Safeguard!<eos> Exterminators!<eos> Yaichi!<eos> Above you!
We cannot take this information out into base reality... but we do not have any orders to stop you from connecting to it.<eos> Take the injured over there!<eos> Someone help carry them!<eos> Hurry, over here.<eos> Bring the molecular tape!<eos> Fusata.<eos> Shall I wrap it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Killy.<eos> We were saved thanks to you.
Rebecca Sherman, Thomas Roth,<eos> Alice Winter, Peter Theo, Maxwell Fletcher, and finally, Warren Shepherd.<eos> So, if our analysis is right and we're looking for eight Collaborators, we have everyone.<eos> We all know who's next in succession when she resigns.<eos> Henry Roarke.<eos> If you want to keep your job, you'll find out what he's up to.<eos> Your sister... She died at the Al-Qaeda train bombing.<eos> This is not about my sister.<eos> Whatever it is that's happening between you two, you have to stop it.<eos> I like you, Sasha.

Is everything okay?<eos> Wait. Raina, I'll come with you.<eos> Hey, you know what's a really good way to stay away from somebody?<eos> By spending the entire night with them alone.<eos> Okay, for the last time, my relationship with your brother is strictly professional.<eos> Like your relationship with your boss was or your relationship with your fellow recruit?<eos> No, no, no. Don't even intimate that either of those was only my doing.<eos> You had a say in the matter. So did your father.<eos> I'm not leaving till you're off this team.<eos> Good luck to you 'cause if your mother had to choose between me and you,

So did your father.<eos> I'm not leaving till you're off this team.<eos> Good luck to you 'cause if your mother had to choose between me and you,<eos> Oh, what... are you sleeping with her, too? !<eos> Hey.<eos> The Journal reported Sasha Barinov was killed two nights ago in a freak accident...<eos> Faulty gas tank in her car, but that's not what happened, is it?<eos> I know she was important to you.
- She hasn't said yes. - Uh, Earth to Clay...<eos> Seriously, both of you.<eos> Yes, we want you to throw an engagement party for us to use as a backdrop for a matter of national security.<eos> And I'm supposed to just blindly accept this?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.<eos> Right now, outside those doors, there's a vast conspiracy threatening everything you care about, and we're the only ones fighting it.<eos> You want to know what I've been doing?<eos> I've been playing superhero, only I-I'm failing.<eos> Like Ben Affleck as Batman. And I need you.<eos> We need you.
It's not the alcohol. I...<eos> Let's just be married, enjoy being married.<eos> I mean, we can have a wedding for everyone else, but let's elope for us.<eos> We can't do that. I mean, I'll...<eos> I'll talk to my mom... No.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I want to be married to you.<eos> And I could do without the wedding and the weird, I don't know, "my dad gives me away wearing a white dress conveying a virginhood I clearly don't have."<eos> But you don't want to elope because it's romantic.<eos> You just want to put a wall between you and whatever's pulling you away from me.
We didn't know that you were here.<eos> I just didn't care.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I... just got a... troubling phone call from Felix Cordova.<eos> I'm calling a meeting to the bunker ASAP.<eos> I should probably put a shirt on for that.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry you had to see that. No.<eos> I should be sorry for what I said last night. No.<eos> Don't be.<eos> After we spoke, I realized all this time around you, I thought that I had feelings for you.
I know you're stressed out, it's a stressful time.<eos> You remember when Stevie was waiting to hear from Lovell, and she wanted us all to start calling her Stephanie...<eos> Okay.<eos> Could we please not talk about Stevie?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> It's just, I knew this whole process would be a nightmare.<eos> I just thought it would be mine.<eos> A nightmare just for me.<eos> Well, and who doesn't want that?<eos> Your Dad and I are very proud of you, Noodle.
Okay, here we go.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Ready?<eos> Five, four, three, two, one.<eos> I got the e-mail.<eos> "Dear Ms. McCord, it is our pleasure to inform you..."<eos> Yes!<eos> My God!<eos> Noodle!<eos> I'm so proud of you. Yes!
Five, four, three, two, one.<eos> I got the e-mail.<eos> "Dear Ms. McCord, it is our pleasure to inform you..."<eos> Yes!<eos> My God!<eos> Noodle!<eos> I'm so proud of you. Yes!<eos> Well, clearly I wasted my time researching those other schools.<eos> Rafferty knows a fashion star when they see one.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
I know you should have heard it from me, but, um...<eos> I just...<eos> I was gonna tell you after Ali found out about Rafferty, but, I mean, she was so happy, and I really didn't want to rain on her celebration, so...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I mean, I'm not happy, but I'm okay.<eos> 'Cause Russell's ready to storm the castle to get you off the wait list.<eos> I already told him that I'm going to write a letter to the admissions board, you know, pleading my own case.<eos> I feel like it's the least that they can expect from a future graduate.<eos> Mom...<eos> I am so proud of you.
You do?<eos> - Babe, books.<eos> - Uh, just so you know, remainders of your book on St. Augustine are not gonna be huge sellers.<eos> Huh, too bad it's not celebrity gossip.<eos> Oh, don't go telling your dad that St. Augustine isn't a celebrity.<eos> That's right.<eos> Jason!<eos> You are gonna miss your ride.<eos> Could I get some money for school?<eos> Good morning to you, too.
- You're up early.<eos> - Yeah, there's a debate meeting.<eos> - I'm-I'm taking the bus.<eos> - You're gonna miss it.<eos> I ran into your calculus teacher.<eos> Do I need to go on?<eos> You know what?<eos> Just... just ground me, and I'll-I'll give you the money back.<eos> Ah, you're not getting off that easy.<eos> You have one chance to explain to me what is worth more to you than our trust.
- kind of girl. - But you know what?<eos> This is good; she's going against her instincts.<eos> Jason's got to get in there and build on the friendship.<eos> That's not exactly what I told him.<eos> You didn't tell him<eos> - to fight for her?<eos> - Well, he did.<eos> Look where that led him.<eos> Because he went too big. Henry.<eos> Your son needs you, come on.
Why do I know that name?<eos> Independent risk management and defense contractor, works with a lot of different firms.<eos> And here's a list of his most recent partners.<eos> Mr. Brennan, ma'am. Daryl.<eos> Thanks so much for coming in to see me again.<eos> - We're gonna get people talking.<eos> - We are.<eos> You remember my senior policy advisor, Jay Whitman?<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - You, too.
Abort.<eos> The deal is off.<eos> Do not touch Clementine.<eos> Let her go immediately.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> See, we had a deal in place.<eos> With Reiden?<eos> Whatever they told you, it isn't true.<eos> I didn't steal anything from them.<eos> I want to believe you,
That's good, call the razorbacks to our position.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Jackson.<eos> - Tessa.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We heard your distress call.<eos> These are my friends, Abraham and Dariela Kenyatta.<eos> Guys, this is Tessa.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - We've heard a lot about you.
Come on, you need a, a real lawyer.<eos> No, I need someone I can trust.<eos> Someone who knows me.<eos> Hey, Clem, it's your dad.<eos> Jackson tells me you're still in New York.<eos> So am I.<eos> And apparently I'm a lawyer now.<eos> Long story.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> I know you're an adult and everything, but... if I don't hear from you soon, I'm gonna start picturing you tied up in the back of a van someplace, so give me a call, please.
This is impossible.<eos> She can't be pregnant.<eos> There's blood on her shirt, from when she was shot.<eos> How quickly can you test this?<eos> How long is his break?<eos> 20 minutes.<eos> Formaldehyde.<eos> Smells like home.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> What's disgusting is you arresting Jamie because your badge and gun didn't woo her back to you.
Oh, yeah, the winner and a friend get to hang out and practice with retired Red Sox players and then play in a real game, right on the field at Fenway.<eos> Oh, my god, that's always been a dream of mine!<eos> Well, that and tuning a guitar in front of a live audience.<eos> This was in perfect tune when they handed it to me.<eos> Next up, our fantasy weekend for two at Fenway park.<eos> Oh, man, this is it!<eos> And the winner is...<eos> Peter Griffin!<eos> Holy crap, I won!<eos> Wow, good for you!
Rupert, what do you think of this fan fiction I wrote?<eos> "Diego pressed Dora against the wall,<eos> "her bosom heaving,<eos> "her hot Latina breath on his face.<eos> For once, Diego was going to do the exploring."<eos> Whew, just reading it...<eos> Okay, Stewie, time for you to get dressed.<eos> Yeah, a closed door means "come in," I guess.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Let's pick out a cute shirt for you.
Stewie!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> You're messing with my schedule, so I'm giving you wall poo.<eos> Stop that right now.<eos> You just earned a time-out.<eos> A what?<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Don't you walk away!<eos> Hey, don't bruise me, I'm going dancing later.<eos> You listen to me, you little monster, I take abuse from everybody around here, but I am not gonna take it from you.
Ha! That's funny 'cause she's hot.<eos> Ah, it's a little like tennis.<eos> Uh, did you see that, Peter?<eos> I'm doing it all!<eos> Damn it. This is supposed to be my weekend.<eos> Stewie?<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Meg's awful!<eos> She gave me a time-out and she made me sit in this chair.<eos> My god, she put eye shadow on you, too.
The trick, Chris, is thinking of the wand as an extension of your arm.<eos> Wow, I can't believe I'm pretend bowling with a dog on drugs!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Oh, my god, a baby!<eos> My name's Shelly.<eos> I can't have any of my own.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I love you so much. Ah!<eos> Everywhere's a nightmare!<eos> Wow, it's nice they put on a banquet for you.
Well, at least somebody's having fun here tonight.<eos> Oh, you're just nervous about the big game tomorrow.<eos> I-is it 'cause of how pink you turn when you run?<eos> A couple guys mentioned that today on the field.<eos> What?<eos> Who said that?<eos> I don't know, "N-Nomar" something.<eos> You met Nomar? !<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> We've been saving a spot at the head table for you with all the hall-of-famers.
She's scary and mean, and I don't ever want her to be in charge of me.<eos> Are you afraid of me, little guy?<eos> Oh, Stewie, I'm really sorry I left you in that time-out.<eos> I love you very much, and I'm so happy you're home.<eos> You're my little brother.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Well... all right.<eos> Can I have your baby?<eos> Don't let her in!<eos> We're all proud of you, Peter.
Reid deserves to know everything.<eos> I'm so sorry, Spencer.<eos> We will find her, I promise.<eos> We'll find her, ok?<eos> Ballistics came back on the gun that was used on Cassie.<eos> It's the exact weapon Jack Vaughn used when he was a mob enforcer in Boston.<eos> Lindsey must have taken it from her father.<eos> Maybe she wanted his reputation or she just wanted to make sure her dad knew what she was doing.<eos> The reasons are unimportant.<eos> What's important is you were right, and I should have believed you from the start and I didn't.
There's a factory nearby that manufactures non-FDA-approved seasickness tablets.<eos> Essentially, scopolamine pills.<eos> Los Indios is only a 40-minute drive to Matamoros.<eos> Looks like we've got Lindsey where we need her.<eos> Now we put the knife in her hand.<eos> In here, we're all psychopaths.<eos> We have to be, 'cause it's predator or prey.<eos> Oh, my stomach.<eos> Medic! Cell block C, now!<eos> I helped you because I like you.
You got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> You all right?<eos> Uh, it's open.<eos> Of course.<eos> He's the resident.<eos> He's just gonna grab a few things.<eos> What is it?<eos> This picture was on a different page.<eos> Does that mean something to you?
Previously on "once upon a time"...<eos> The evil queen sent everyone from the enchanted forest here. That's what you're going with?<eos> It's true.<eos> How long will you be with us?<eos> A week.<eos> It's your destiny.<eos> You're gonna bring back the happy endings.<eos> I do hope you like apples.<eos> It's poison.<eos> You may not believe in the curse, but I believe in you.
It's your destiny.<eos> You're gonna bring back the happy endings.<eos> I do hope you like apples.<eos> It's poison.<eos> You may not believe in the curse, but I believe in you.<eos> Henry!<eos> Every story in this book actually happened.<eos> Goodbye, Emma.<eos> Henry, you were right about the curse.<eos> I should've believed you.
Wherever we end up, we're gonna win.<eos> Archie!<eos> Hey, Archie!<eos> What happened? ! What's going on?<eos> What did the black fairy's curse do?<eos> Really, Henry?<eos> Black fairy?<eos> Curse?<eos> Henry, I-i-i thought we were past all this.<eos> She's done something to you, to... to everyone.
You know who.<eos> Where's my mom?<eos> Henry... You know exactly where Emma is.<eos> She's in the same place that she's been for the last two years.<eos> Emma? You have a visitor.<eos> Your son.<eos> Mom.<eos> Henry.<eos> Thank god you remember me.<eos> Of course I remember you.
Perhaps even the Boston skyline?<eos> As I recall, you had a lovely apartment overlooking it all.<eos> Wouldn't it be nice to go back?<eos> Yeah. It would be nice.<eos> Good.<eos> Because it's not just your well-being that I'm concerned with.<eos> It's Henry's.<eos> He's clearly still clinging to the delusion that these stories are real.<eos> Now, I'd hoped we were past all that.<eos> But now, thanks to you, I have a 14-year-old boy who still believed in fairy tales.
Bloody hell.<eos> I think I just woke up the giants!<eos> Hook, I think it's worse than giants.<eos> Don't tell me you're afraid of a little fire. That's not fire.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Run!<eos> So, yes.<eos> I haven't been completely honest.<eos> The police did find evidence of what happened to belle.<eos> I just wanted to save you and Gideon the heartbreak.
"I want you to push your chest into the mat and your butt in the air, and then pull up the front of your mat like a slut."<eos> I was like, "All right." I was trying to be a team player.<eos> I was like, "I'm a bad girl.<eos> I'm a yoga slut down on my luck... trying to forge a mind-body connection."<eos> And then she goes, "That's right, pull up the front of your mat like a sled."<eos> Minor adjustment.<eos> Let me just close my butt.<eos> So, my wife says, "Wait for me, I'm not ready."<eos> And I held my ground.<eos> I go, "I'm not gonna wait for you 'cause you're a late person.
I went to Catholic school for nine years, and they teach it to you when you're so young, you're seven.<eos> They're like, "There's this guy Jesus, and he loves you.<eos> And you love him, too, right?"<eos> You're like, "Wait.<eos> Do I know this guy?"<eos> And they're like, "Oh, yeah, there's this guy Jesus, who everybody loves 'cause he loves everybody.<eos> And a long time ago, he died, and it's not totally your fault.<eos> So... don't be scared or sad 'cause he's in heaven now with his dad, who is also God.<eos> There's this other thing called The Holy Spirit that no one really understands.<eos> All three of these things are a cluster... that are staring at you all the time."
Ma'am.<eos> All visitors proceed to the nearest exit.<eos> It's just weird, you know?<eos> Yeah, I didn't even know you wanted to see him.<eos> It's been, what... 13 years?<eos> - Fourteen.<eos> - So, why now?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I guess Linus's father dying affected me more than I realized.<eos> Or feelings for you are making me want to reach out to my family.
Your father was telling the truth.<eos> It was self-defense.<eos> Parsons attacked first. - Why?<eos> - I don't know, but maybe Bruce does?<eos> Can you maybe help a girl out?<eos> - With what?<eos> - With not, uh, totally freaking out?<eos> - Trouble in paradise?<eos> - Paradise in paradise.<eos> So, everything's great with you and Amanda?
So, I'm thinking about going and seeing my Mom tomorrow.<eos> You want to come?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're quiet tonight.<eos> Yeah, there's a lot on my mind with my Dad and Maggie coming back.<eos> I hope she appreciates how you handed back the keys to the lab without a single dent. Ha.<eos> Actually, she was more concerned about me turning over some of the stitches to Camille.<eos> Well, that was only two of them.<eos> Well, I handled that one okay, I think.<eos> It's just, um, then I asked her about the cube and the credenza, and who's selecting our cases, and, uh... you know, because I wanted to find out for you.
Dad, did you do something wrong?<eos> I'm done here.<eos> Miller just had a visit from his lawyer.<eos> I thought Miller could do better.<eos> The kid looks a little green. Describe him.<eos> White male, twenties, big hair.<eos> That wasn't his lawyer.<eos> Maybe we should just call it?<eos> Call who now?<eos> Girl, you're so far away I need a passport to reach you.
You push people away.<eos> Hey, Kirsten.<eos> Sorry, I gotta go.<eos> Call me... if you want.<eos> I'm sorry, did I just walk in on something?<eos> You think?<eos> You know, sometimes you can be a little bit of a bully.<eos> Well... sometimes you can be a little bit of a stupid.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You know, Kirsten, believe it or not, there are days when I actually miss the old "feelings challenged" you, because now you have this, like, huge emotional blindspot, where, when it comes to certain people,
Really?<eos> Who?<eos> Me.<eos> It's mine.<eos> Quiet, Milly.<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - Twelve.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> I'm the big brother, let me take care of you.
Brave... stupid.<eos> Look out for her.<eos> You really screwed up this time!<eos> - You could have been arrested!<eos> - Why?<eos> It's your pot.<eos> You're so lucky I covered for you.<eos> Stop smoking that crap, it's making you dumb.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Away from you, loser.
- You could have been arrested!<eos> - Why?<eos> It's your pot.<eos> You're so lucky I covered for you.<eos> Stop smoking that crap, it's making you dumb.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Away from you, loser.<eos> Yeah, where you gonna go?<eos> To the friends you don't have?<eos> Nobody likes you, Milly.
Don't fight them, Linus.<eos> Just give them the notes!<eos> But they're my notes.<eos> I did the work, not them.<eos> It's just like it was in Michigan.<eos> Everybody hates me here.<eos> It's okay, Linus.<eos> Things will get better.<eos> And until then, you'll always have your mother and me.<eos> I don't want you.
They wanted to know what he told me.<eos> I didn't tell them.<eos> Yeah, yeah. You're smart.<eos> That was pretty bad-ass.<eos> Maybe next time, you pay, I go, huh?<eos> Deal.<eos> Someone really doesn't want you talking to your father.<eos> Or they want you talking so they can get information.<eos> Or Camille's just saying that so she can disagree with me.<eos> Not everything's about you, Princess.
You look well.<eos> What part... of stop texting, stop calling, stop harassing me, don't you understand?<eos> Come on.<eos> We're family.<eos> We're all each other has.<eos> That is not true.<eos> I have a sister... have friends.<eos> I have a brilliant young man who loves me, but who I haven't spoken to in days because I'm afraid if he finds out you've been talking to me he won't trust me anymore.<eos> Listen to me, I know exactly how Maggie Baptiste thinks.<eos> She's using Linus to get to you, to get to me.

Make him trust you.<eos> Help us find out where Jacqueline is.<eos> No.<eos> How do you think your new friends would feel... if they found out who was really behind the Young Cameron anomaly?<eos> Get out of my apartment.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Someplace safe.<eos> Somewhere Joe Zeiss can't try to have you killed again.<eos> Look, I know the truth.<eos> I know Zeiss skimmed the $30 million and pinned it on you.
God, that son of a bitch!<eos> Kristen, just calm down.<eos> It wasn't... it wasn't Stinger.<eos> - It was Maggie. - Maggie didn't know where she was!<eos> What did you do?<eos> I was just talking to Maggie and it...<eos> It slipped.<eos> It slipped?<eos> My mother's location just slipped out?<eos> - I trusted you, Cameron, with the most important thing in the world.
What's up?<eos> Not in front of his son.<eos> You sure?<eos> Hey, Andrew.<eos> I think we have the wrong address.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Ivy.<eos> It's me.<eos> Look, I'm not sure what's going on here, but...<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I'm here for you whenever you need me to be.
So, how was the rest of your night?<eos> Ah, it was all right.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Remember Christmas as a kid?<eos> It was the best, you know.<eos> You got games and toys and...<eos> Uncle Billy gave you a couple of beers, watched you run into shit.<eos> As an adult, all you get is underwear and your family.<eos> Mmm, I've done your laundry.<eos> Underwear's a good gift for you.
Since when do you smoke?<eos> - Since my parents got here.<eos> - What? I thought they were meetin' us at midnight Mass.<eos> I know, but my dad wanted to stop by and take a look at the furnace.<eos> - I just fixed your furnace.<eos> - Yeah, that's why he wanted to stop by.<eos> This is the last thing I need right now.<eos> Listen, don't be nervous.<eos> All right?<eos> Yeah, they don't like you.
Have fun with your helmet tomorrow, Kyle.<eos> What are you doin' up so early?<eos> I was feedin' cattle while you were sleepin' in.<eos> - You did that on Christmas mornin'?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, the cows don't know it's Christmas.<eos> Sounds like somethin' I'd say.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Every Christmas.<eos> I got a little somethin' for you.
So, it's like everything was on track.<eos> But... now what?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Do I... forget about Abby and go be with Heather?<eos> Or do I stay with Abby while Heather's having my kid?<eos> I can't answer that question, Colt.<eos> Fuck!<eos> That's the same thing Siri said.<eos> I can't answer it because you're askin' the wrong question.<eos> You're thinkin' about what's best for you.
Rooster?<eos> - Colt.<eos> - Abby.<eos> - Heather.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Okay.<eos> I got somethin' for you.
I black out.<eos> And I just wake up in the morning.<eos> I don't even look at him, but I can feel that he hates me.<eos> You know that feeling?<eos> It's like, "What's that in the air?"<eos> It's rage and it's all directed at me, so...<eos> I was like, "I'm gonna play stupid." I just roll over, and I'm just...<eos> "Mmm! Morning!<eos> So, should we list all the things that we're grateful for?<eos> I'm grateful for you."
I'm pretty sure you got it.<eos> Maybe.<eos> My sister still hasn't spoken to me, and I don't know if she ever will.<eos> I tried to do the right thing and I turned myself in, 'cause I believe that I should pay a price for what happened. And what did they do?<eos> They sent me here to be a part of a team they don't really want me on.<eos> I feel stuck, out of place.<eos> If I'm weighed down by my sins, it's because they keep pressing them down on me, Shelby.<eos> This isn't about what they think of you, Nimah.<eos> It's about what you think of yourself.<eos> You need to decide if you can stop regretting what you didn't do in the G20 and remember what you did.
What?<eos> I-I'm not being funny.<eos> - We're gonna go order the food. - What?<eos> What did I say? All right.<eos> Good idea.<eos> I'm hungry. - Hey.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Um, so, I've been thinking a lot about you.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> You haven't said much. - Mm-hmm. I know.
Well, how about you buy me dinner?<eos> I don't pay for stories.<eos> Okay, so I'll buy you dinner.<eos> Okay, but it can't be expensive.<eos> I have a very strict code of ethics.<eos> Oh.<eos> Friday night, pick the worst restaurant in town.<eos> You're on.<eos> León, it's Shelby Wyatt.<eos> I was just thinking about you and thought I'd call and see how you were.
Now, will you be able to stay with him?<eos> He's gonna need help.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - What?<eos> I-I've got to take care of Christy.<eos> Aw, aren't you a good mom?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> D-Don't worry, I will take care of this big lug, get him back into fighting shape.<eos> Is that cool with you?<eos> That your ex-wife is gonna take care of you?
Oh sweetie, I wasn't worried.<eos> - Oh, good. Bye-bye.<eos> - Wait, I...<eos> Hello?<eos> Damn it.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Oops. I'm here, baby!<eos> Hey there, sleepyhead.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just taking care of you while your mom pees a circle around her boyfriend.
Fine.<eos> You realize that whoever wins this gets him.<eos> Jill, I appreciate your help, but I can go to the bathroom by myself.<eos> Don't forget to wash your hands.<eos> I got it!<eos> - Christy, I'm worried.<eos> - About what?<eos> I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a mother.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> It's just that I've been here all day taking care of you, and frankly, it's kind of tedious.
But I'm going to give you the chance I was denied.<eos> All you have to do is walk away.<eos> Leave Raymond Reddington.<eos> I won't betray him.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> The person who unearthed the bodies goes by the name of Mr. Kaplan.<eos> She's Reddington's cleaner and one of his closest confidantes.<eos> Why is she at war with him?<eos> Ressler.<eos> I got two questions for you. One.
Where did you hear those words?<eos> I know those words.<eos> You know them because I said them to you many times a day when you were a baby.<eos> That can't be true.<eos> Regular affirmations build a child's self-confidence, you're proof of that.<eos> It's no surprise you don't remember with all you've been through.<eos> You and I were very close once.<eos> You knew me as Katya.<eos> I was your nanny.<eos> I don't believe you.

I was your nanny.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Your mother hired me to care for you.<eos> I promised her that I would defend you with my life.<eos> The reason I'm telling you this now is so that you'll listen to me when I beg you, walk away.<eos> I gave the authorities enough to put him away forever.<eos> But you and your team must disavow any knowledge of the task force.<eos> So, you served Reddington up on a silver platter to the FBI?<eos> You did that for me?<eos> Not you, Elizabeth.
I'm rolling out there now.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, what's all this?<eos> Diane Fowler's living room.<eos> It was catalogued, crated and stored in evidence.<eos> Seems the bureau spares no expense for their leadership.<eos> We're gonna reconstruct the whole scene.<eos> And we're gonna dissect it until we find what we need.<eos> This is extreme, even for you.
Well, how about you buy me dinner?<eos> - I don't pay for stories. - Well, I'll buy you dinner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We won't be able to fulfill our promise to you.<eos> You could stay here, join us.<eos> - You're nothing.<eos> - You are my sister.<eos> Leon, it's Shelby Wyatt.<eos> Thought I'd call and see how you were.<eos> Good morning to you, too.
- Stop it.<eos> - You're new here.<eos> You can wait your turn.<eos> Now, why don't you guys go ahead? I'll take care of this.<eos> "This"?<eos> Really, Owen?<eos> Is that what I am now... "this"?<eos> Okay, I don't know what you are, drunk maybe?<eos> No. Stupid.<eos> Stupid to ever think that anyone would want me here but you.
If we're not going to be able to have real connections, we might as well have fun while not trying to.<eos> Go.<eos> Get compromised.<eos> I am going to drink until I forget we had that conversation, and you are going to get yourself out of this mess so we can stop making mistakes.<eos> Call your sister.<eos> One day, she'll answer.<eos> The dead father-in-law and brother-in-law's ex in my house.<eos> That's about where I thought this day would end.<eos> Clay's not home.<eos> Unless you've come to tell me that he's left me for you, too. No.
Get out.<eos> Fine.<eos> Where's Zoe?<eos> I'm taking her with me.<eos> Zoe stays with me until her mom gets out of the hospital.<eos> But she's not your daughter.<eos> She is my blood, and I've got 85 cops in this building who have her back.<eos> - This isn't over.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It is for you.
I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> - Hey. - Stop.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you so uptight?<eos> Didn't you hear me say no?<eos> I heard you.<eos> I just don't believe you.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> My mother is gonna be impeached.<eos> We're all gonna be exposed.<eos> This operation is over.<eos> We get briefing memos, too...<eos> People in custody who look like the right person, but don't match fingerprints on file.<eos> Make me hate you again.<eos> I thought that I had feelings for you. But the person I really care about... Was my brother.
- Hey. - Good day.<eos> What are you doing at the FBI, Alex?<eos> Ma'am, no liquids past security.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know I had a water.<eos> I don't think it'll work.<eos> We need something more recent, something undeniable.<eos> If you want more, I can ask Felix.<eos> No, I don't want to go around Clay.<eos> And I definitely don't want to risk ruining whatever it is Felix is doing for you regarding Nimah. But it's not sabotage.
I took on this job 'cause I thought it was the high ground.<eos> It doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And we made sure of it.<eos> We did what was needed. I stand by our choice.<eos> After what happened at the FBI today, my mother will be forced to resign.<eos> Her and Nixon. That's a great legacy.<eos> I lost a friend.<eos> Maybe my relationship with Maxine will survive, - but...<eos> - Clay, the fight isn't over.<eos> I had feelings for you.

- Emily.<eos> - Right, of course, sorry.<eos> Uh, please, sit.<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> This is my first... whatever this is.<eos> Not mine.<eos> Emily's been in the foster system for quite some time now.<eos> Terrific.<eos> How do you like it?<eos> Hang on, I have a hat for you.
Oh, neat.<eos> Is there a prom in it?<eos> Oh, that girl's not gonna pick me.<eos> I've watched The Bachelor enough to know I'm not getting a rose.<eos> Ah, come on, there's always hope.<eos> We were there.<eos> No rose.<eos> So, it didn't work out with this young lady. You'll take what you learned and use it moving forward.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm hoping for a baby next time.<eos> When babies don't like you, they have the decency to keep it to themselves.
Hey, how about, how about you and Bonnie come live here and help me with her?<eos> We might have to take you up on that.<eos> Let's see how the banana bread goes.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Now I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Christy, this was a mistake.<eos> When people don't like me at first, they never like me.<eos> I don't have a chance with her.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't like you at first.
Oh, great.<eos> Now I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Christy, this was a mistake.<eos> When people don't like me at first, they never like me.<eos> I don't have a chance with her.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't like you at first.<eos> You didn't? Nope.<eos> I thought you were self-obsessed and spoiled and your teeth were so white it made me angry.<eos> But then I got to know you, and now I can't imagine my life without you in it.
I'm just so bad at this.<eos> I think you're doing okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you hear what she said?<eos> She thinks I'm doing okay.<eos> I have never once heard that from my daughter.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Hey, Violet, it's your mother.<eos> Just checking in, haven't heard from you in awhile.<eos> I thought maybe you and Luke might want to come over for dinner on Sunday, unless you broke up with him, in which case, bring the new guy.
The detective who reached out to you.<eos> Yeah, Elijah bell.<eos> There is no Elijah bell in the Philly pd.<eos> He works with krilov. So does your witness. No.<eos> No! I was at her house, okay?<eos> I was there when she was taken.<eos> By krilov's men.<eos> He staged the whole thing.<eos> Hitchin wasn't involved. During the raid, you were knocked out unconscious.<eos> That's when krilov started to work on you, implanting memories.
What memories you implanted in agent ressler's consciousness and what you took away.<eos> You're going to give me everything we need to exonerate him.<eos> I could do that, I suppose. If properly motivated.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> From 25 years ago? No.<eos> But then, you wouldn't be very good at your job if I did.<eos> No. Not 25 years ago.<eos> Just two.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You were brought to me by a mutual acquaintance of ours, who wanted me to take certain memories away from you.
You were brought to me by a mutual acquaintance of ours, who wanted me to take certain memories away from you.<eos> What memories?<eos> Let us say you had uncovered certain truth about Raymond reddington,<eos> and he couldn't have that.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No. I'm not lying.<eos> And I think you know that.<eos> So, let's make a deal.<eos> Full immunity.<eos> I walk, in exchange for the memories I took from you.
and he couldn't have that.<eos> You're lying.<eos> No. I'm not lying.<eos> And I think you know that.<eos> So, let's make a deal.<eos> Full immunity.<eos> I walk, in exchange for the memories I took from you.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> That is a shame. For all of us.<eos> But more so for you than me, I suspect.
To continue to unravel my life.<eos> He's sidelined ressler.<eos> He's trying to do the same to you.<eos> You did it once. Yes.<eos> When you were a child. To protect you from the memory of killing your father.<eos> I hired krilov once. Never again.<eos> That's Julian Gale, I've been avoiding his calls and I'm beginning to think that was a mistake.<eos> Bogdan krilov, Julian Gale. Directly or indirectly, they're working for kaplan.<eos> Against us.<eos> Against you.
- It is.<eos> - Henry, stop.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I am so happy you found me.<eos> And I'm so happy I got to know my son.<eos> But it's so clear now.<eos> Coming to storybrooke wasn't good for either of us.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Look where I ended up.<eos> Look at you. Look at your arm.
She would convince you to go against your dark instincts.<eos> I couldn't let that happen.<eos> But once the final battle is won, the curse on belle and Gideon will be lifted, and I will have unchecked powers.<eos> Not even the laws of magic will apply.<eos> I can make them love you without you having to give up being the dark one.<eos> Don't you realize?<eos> You can finally have it all.<eos> No...<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't trust you.
Just go ahead.<eos> We're racing against the clock.<eos> I'll only slow you down.<eos> Go.<eos> Save Emma!<eos> Save our son!<eos> Can you see him?<eos> We lost him.<eos> But he won't be far behind.<eos> I'm so sorry that I ever doubted you. I know.
I was wondering if I could...<eos> Go.<eos> We'll deal with all this later.<eos> - Suit's a nice touch.<eos> I was worried it was a little over-the-top, but I look good.<eos> You know, I was... No, no.<eos> Over-the-top would have been using the Phoenix jet to get to Boston before me, renting this car, and then meeting me here with that sign.<eos> The hat and the gloves are just the cherry on top of a banana split of weird decisions.<eos> Bozer called me and told me what happened.<eos> And, sure, I'm missing mandatory rehab for my arm, but I wanted to be here for you, man.
Which ignited lab chemicals... that were used as the accelerant that caused the explosion.<eos> The victim's re...<eos> Remains?<eos> Keep reading.<eos> It's fine.<eos> The victim's... remains were found five feet from the south wall.<eos> It's presumed she was knocked over by the initial blast.<eos> Uh, resulting gases then caused a flash-over that burned hot enough to consume the lab equipment and the... victim's body.<eos> No.<eos> Hey, Mac, I know this has got to be hard for you.
Yep, got it. Hacked it.<eos> Looks like your paparazzi tried to e-mail this pic of Jack before you got his phone.<eos> To who?<eos> Frankie's killer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Message didn't go through.<eos> Which means I can't trace the I.P.<eos> I'll see if I can tie this e-mail address to a physical location, but it could take some time.<eos> Well, time isn't on your side, Mac.<eos> I need you back here in 48 hours for another assignment.
Is she okay?<eos> - She's fine, I'm not.<eos> Ever since Hawaii, Captain Aloha's been blowing up her phone nonstop.<eos> And she's all giggles and smiles and...<eos> I need your help, man.<eos> I mean, I'm stuck in the friend zone, and I don't...<eos> You're stuck in the friend zone?<eos> Okay, couple things. First of all, "stuck"<eos> implies that you deserve to be in some other type of zone.<eos> And that ain't up to you, man, that's up to her.
And besides, if you leave now, you won't be able to finish your work.<eos> Oh, my work?<eos> Yeah, who cares about my work?<eos> I do.<eos> Frankie, everything we used to talk about you're actually doing now.<eos> I can't just let you walk away from it.<eos> Mac, this isn't about you.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> It's not about me.<eos> It's about you and what you're doing for the world.
Yeah, we need it for electrophoresis.<eos> Okay, yeah, that's... that's what I thought.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, unflavored gelatin only, Jack.<eos> Frankie has a very specific recipe, so Jell-O won't work.<eos> So... no cherry-flavored?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> I know it doesn't look like much, but it's gonna...<eos> No, it's not about that.<eos> It's about you.
And it wasn't about you.<eos> Okay. I thought after seven years, you would have gotten over it.<eos> I am over it.<eos> I'm completely over it.<eos> Okay? Hey.<eos> Will you listen to me?<eos> I am trying to apologize.<eos> Look at this. You know what?<eos> I didn't ask for apology, okay?<eos> We're fine. However I felt about you, losing Makino was not your fault.
Okay.<eos> I'm glad you like your bed, though, buddy.<eos> I love it!<eos> That's fantastic news.<eos> Let's get into it.<eos> All right.<eos> You cozy?<eos> Cozy.<eos> You... you want to know a secret?<eos> Your daddy built this bed all by himself just for you.
He'll listen to me.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> Whatever these people want, don't give it to 'em.<eos> Don't you give it to 'em!<eos> Anyway, the-the point is that, um, these are the people that... that helped save your life today.<eos> I guess Tanaka and Jenny helped, also.<eos> But, these people are my family.<eos> I'm-I'm saying that it'd be nice... if... if you woke up, 'cause you get to meet 'em, right?<eos> But yeah.<eos> 'Cause, come to think of it, if it wasn't for you, I never would've met them.
It's time.<eos> You got this.<eos> You really think she has a chance?<eos> Right now, she needs to believe it.<eos> Octavia kom skaikru, step forward.<eos> Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion.<eos> Ilian kom trishanakru.<eos> Accept the sigil of your clan and fight with honor as their champion.<eos> What are you trying to prove?<eos> I'm here for trishanakru. Not you.
Please don't be her.<eos> Fio kom trikru...<eos> Octavia's still out there.<eos> Couldn't tell her I loved her, even with the world ending.<eos> Trust me, Bellamy, she knows.<eos> She knows.<eos> You were smart to come back here and hide, but not smart enough.<eos> For Lincoln's sake, I'll make your death quick.<eos> How could you even say his name?<eos> Lincoln would be ashamed of you.
This is what mankind chooses to do with its final days.<eos> Another battle?<eos> More blood?<eos> You used to believe that people were worth saving.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Skaikru taught me that people are cruel and violent and selfish to the core.<eos> Not Lincoln.<eos> He believed that we can do better, and I loved him for that.<eos> And yet here you are, killing for your own clan, just like everyone else.<eos> Lincoln would be ashamed of you.
I was only trying to help save our people.<eos> I am not my mother.<eos> I'm not willing to cast aside honor for power.<eos> No one has to know.<eos> You misunderstand.<eos> I will not allow your dishonor to give luna an advantage, and you will not shame our clan ever again.<eos> You are azgeda no more.<eos> Sire, wait.<eos> You're banished, echo, and when I win this conclave...<eos> Make no mistake... There will be no place for you inside that bunker.
She's survived harder things than this.<eos> Before she dies, I'll tell her she's lucky to have you as a brother.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> After she guts you and before you die, you tell her I was the lucky one.<eos> Mezi kom louwoda klion kru...<eos> Only 4 warriors remain...<eos> Roan kom azgeda, luna kom flokru, guara kom podakru, and Octavia kom skaikru.<eos> I'm sorry about trikru, Indra.<eos> Octavia's doing well.<eos> Thanks to you.
Roan kom azgeda, luna kom flokru, guara kom podakru, and Octavia kom skaikru.<eos> I'm sorry about trikru, Indra.<eos> Octavia's doing well.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> You taught her to be a warrior.<eos> A warrior has many teachers, war chief among them.<eos> If she wins, we'll see what she has truly learned.<eos> You.<eos> You lied to me about the flame.<eos> I trusted you, and you broke that trust.
Octavia kom skaikru is victorious.<eos> The crypt of the first commander belongs to her people.<eos> No.<eos> I wasn't fighting for skaikru today.<eos> I thought I was fighting for myself, but I now know that's not true, either.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it equally because we are equal.<eos> We are one clan, and we will survive praimfaya together.<eos> Lincoln would be so proud of you.
First woman you been with since Camille died.<eos> And she throws a hump into you.<eos> Makes your eyeballs roll back like a slot machine.<eos> Then she starts taking you to her church, you know, where they clap their hands and shake their butts.<eos> And now, you're grasping for salvation.<eos> Am I close?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just making sure we put away the right guy.<eos> This has nothing to do with the Valentine case.<eos> This is about you.
Actually, I'm looking for you, too.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Hey, look, you can't do this!<eos> Yeah, you wanna get locked up, too?<eos> It's clear.<eos> No Eric, Sarge.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> Mark Scalise.<eos> Man, it is odd seeing you.<eos> I mean, this is how I remember you.
Get Jay and Erin hip to this.<eos> Break up into teams.<eos> Check out these banks and their surveillance cameras, see if anyone's casing them.<eos> We only have access to the latest 24 hours worth of footage; Anything older than that is stored off-site at our security firm.<eos> Stop there.<eos> Stop there.<eos> Will you zoom in on that?<eos> Looks like our suspects, but only two of them.<eos> That's all they need to case the place.<eos> They're clocking the crowd, clocking getaway routes, even you.
Your prints didn't pop up in any criminal system that we got, so what did you do...<eos> you just wake up one morning, decide you wanted to rob banks?<eos> Okay, what about your friends who beat feet and left you holding the bag?<eos> What are their names?<eos> Look at me.<eos> We are trying to help you get out of prison while you still got a life to live.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Just look.<eos> That's on you.
- This is my home.<eos> - Take her, too.<eos> For what?<eos> Get dressed, Sunshine. Let's go.<eos> You hit the lottery, Sammy?<eos> Did your old boss ever let you do interviews?<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> The 50 grand we found at your girl's place matches serial numbers on missing cash from the banks.<eos> That's bad news for you.
Why do you want to protect Spann?<eos> For money you're never gonna get to spend and a double murder charge you will not beat?<eos> Come on, Ray.<eos> We know he put you up to this.<eos> Lay it on him.<eos> Darren.<eos> Bobby.<eos> Really?<eos> That's Spann.<eos> The guy who was supposedly looking out for you.
She doesn't need to hear this.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Son, if you give us that statement,<eos> you're gonna have to testify in open court in front of Lavar Spann.<eos> And we both know what he's capable of.<eos> But Officer Atwater said you all would be able to protect me.<eos> Yeah, well, I wish I could guarantee that.<eos> Listen, I am sure your whole life you've been told not to trust the police.<eos> Just, please, trust me on this one.<eos> You do not want to open your mouth, 'cause it's gonna end bad for you.
You were banging co-eds in law school when I was in the Gang Unit, so I understand how this works.<eos> That kid snitches, he's dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> So, his testimony's not an option.<eos> Well, we killed one, one wouldn't talk, and you got the other two.<eos> That's a hell of a theory.<eos> But I only had two years left on my sentence when I was paroled.<eos> Even if I'm violated, and they make me do every day, it ain't gonna be nothing but a vacation for me.<eos> I'll be out in 18 months.<eos> Yeah, and I'm gonna have a unit sitting on you every second.
Even if I'm violated, and they make me do every day, it ain't gonna be nothing but a vacation for me.<eos> I'll be out in 18 months.<eos> Yeah, and I'm gonna have a unit sitting on you every second.<eos> They're gonna be waking you up and tucking you in, and when you... when you spend the first dollar of that bank's money... and you will... you'll see me again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Listen, when you get in there, keep your head down, okay? Do your time.<eos> Get your GED or something.<eos> Just... just make a plan.<eos> Hey, look at me.<eos> When you get out, me and Sergeant Voight will make something happen for you, okay?
I know you'll look for inconsistencies when you interview Detective Upton.<eos> You will not find any.<eos> Until the board has made its determination, you're stripped.<eos> You can take that badge off your chest.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> Um, I'm downtown.<eos> Why?<eos> I...<eos> I need you.
Until the board has made its determination, you're stripped.<eos> You can take that badge off your chest.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> Um, I'm downtown.<eos> Why?<eos> I...<eos> I need you.<eos> I need you to come here.<eos> I need you right now.
You can take that badge off your chest.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> Um, I'm downtown.<eos> Why?<eos> I...<eos> I need you.<eos> I need you to come here.<eos> I need you right now.<eos> I need you.
Why?<eos> I...<eos> I need you.<eos> I need you to come here.<eos> I need you right now.<eos> I need you.<eos> This is really not a good time for me.<eos> He's... he's dead!<eos> I just got home and... and he...<eos> I need you! Right now!
We don't know what happened here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tech!<eos> You came home to find Johnny Martelli dying in your bed, and you don't call 911?<eos> - You call your daughter?<eos> - She's the police.<eos> She's not an ambulance.<eos> Meantime, he's bleeding out.<eos> Why don't you tell us who Johnny is to you.
Upton, you got a second?<eos> - I was just gonna...<eos> - Sure you do. Come on.<eos> You're next at the Review Board.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> It was just you and Lindsay in that room.<eos> Just your recollection and hers.<eos> - And the offender.<eos> - He doesn't matter anymore.<eos> They're gonna drive a wedge between you and Lindsay.
- Yeah, well, Hank said to stay close, but my apartment's a crime scene.<eos> They went through my panties.<eos> Where were you before?<eos> I'm on administrative leave.<eos> I was working a rough case, and I went after a guy.<eos> I hurt him.<eos> Bad.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What happened between you and Johnny Martelli?
Hank, she said,<eos> "There's something bigger going on here."<eos> She wouldn't say what.<eos> That is all.<eos> Her boyfriend stole 40,000 painkillers.<eos> They're missing, and I think she's got them.<eos> - Okay. - No.<eos> You have got to stay here.<eos> You can't keep me out of this.<eos> Erin, believe me when I tell you I am doing this for you.
I'm FBI Special Agent Jennifer Spencer.<eos> We're overdue for a chat.<eos> It's just me.<eos> I come in peace.<eos> The FBI usually does.<eos> Maybe we should talk inside.<eos> Do I have a choice?<eos> Some history at CPD.<eos> Time away for substance abuse, plus a DEA task force gig that lasted all of two weeks.<eos> Now this interview gets away from you.
You're right.<eos> You don't.<eos> How long you been here?<eos> Long enough.<eos> They want me in New York, like, yesterday.<eos> What I'm saying...<eos> I mean, you know about this.<eos> You know about everything, right?<eos> I knew I needed to do something.<eos> I mean, they told me in no uncertain terms they're coming after you.
_<eos> Happy birthday, boss.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Older but not wiser.<eos> Delivery just came for you, but there was no card.<eos> Secret admirer?<eos> Oh, yeah. You know me, got them lining up out the door.<eos> Thank you for the flowers.<eos> What flowers?<eos> Hey, I, uh, I also got you a little something.
- Please, tell me you have that research saved to a cloud somewhere.<eos> No, the cloud's not safe.<eos> But this is.<eos> What's on this?<eos> Everything.<eos> Professor.<eos> We need to go.<eos> Right now.<eos> Back door.<eos> Here's to you... and another trip around the sun.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi!<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you, what are you doing here?<eos> So, some guy named Lazlo just showed up at the bookstore the other day.<eos> He said that Darius Tanz wanted to meet me.<eos> I'm getting a tour, and he's taking me to lunch.<eos> Wow. I assumed it was because of you.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I told him all about you.
- Dylan, I don't have time to listen...<eos> - Right!<eos> You don't have time.<eos> Look, - I don't want to fight.<eos> - Well, I do!<eos> I am fighting for what I believe in.<eos> I just wish once you could respect that!<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You want to stay?<eos> More power to you.
Best food truck in the city.<eos> How's your, um, beet cashew taco?<eos> Yeah, about as good as you said it was in that Forbes exclusive you did last year,<eos> "The Elites' Best Eats."<eos> That's what you're reading?<eos> Tragic.<eos> Well, at the risk of sounding like a pathetic fan,<eos> I've pretty much read everything published about you.<eos> That's funny, because I've read pretty much everything<eos> - published by you.
There are 300,000 possible frequencies, and only one will give us thrust.<eos> I'm doing the math in my head here, sir, and even with this supercomputer, we do not have enough time to check them all.<eos> Then what are you suggesting?<eos> We have to cut down the number of frequencies.<eos> That would cut corners.<eos> We might miss the frequency that would save us all.<eos> In the '50s, the JPL guys nearly blew themselves up testing rockets, now they lead the field.<eos> What is so wrong with taking big swings like Darius says?<eos> Because Darius Tanz is not a scientist, he's a celebrity.<eos> And he's convinced you and the rest of the world, with his charm and bravado, that he knows the way.
I'm sure next time will...<eos> No, I don't think there's gonna be a next time.<eos> When you're passionate about something, time means nothing.<eos> Who said that?<eos> You did.<eos> The night we met.<eos> Hey, how old was Isaac Newton when that apple bonked him on his head and he came up with the theory of gravity?<eos> He was 23.<eos> Hmm. But it took him 20 more years to prove it.<eos> Well, I have faith in you.
Maybe we should take a break.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> We don't have time for a minute.<eos> I made a total ass of myself.<eos> Don't beat yourself up about it.<eos> All right? The guy sounds like a total jerk.<eos> What am I doing here, Liam?<eos> These people are Harvard academics and MIT science whizzes, and I'm just a self-published nobody.<eos> All I know is Darius has a reason for everything.<eos> And if you're here, it's 'cause he sees something in you that the others can't see.
I'm gonna ask you a question.<eos> Who are you working for?<eos> What is the encryption key?<eos> And how do we regain control of the probe?<eos> That was... three questions, actually.<eos> You're not so good at math, eh?<eos> Who are you working for?<eos> What is the encryption key?<eos> How do we regain control of the probe?<eos> If there's any humanity left in you, Tanz, you still have time to do the right thing.
Less than four hours.<eos> Well, then it's impossible without Darius's help.<eos> And what if Harris won't let you talk to him?<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> Right now, the EmDrive is our best chance.<eos> It may be our only chance.<eos> Well, then why is Darius building the ark?<eos> The ark is Darius's backup plan.<eos> You are plan "A."<eos> He believes in you, Liam.
Darius.<eos> Theresa.<eos> My God.<eos> It's been... 15 years.<eos> This is, Grace Barrows, a work, a work colleague.<eos> Grace, this is<eos> Theresa.<eos> Lazlo's sister.<eos> Well, congratulations on all your success.<eos> It's pretty hard not to keep tabs on you.
Sorry. I can't get ahold of Liam, and his work space is empty.<eos> He just vanished, and... he's not answering his phone.<eos> I had this other cousin, he'd thought he'd paid his phone bill...<eos> I'm sure that Liam paid his phone bill, Jamie.<eos> Security measures have been completed.<eos> All employees must return to their workstations.<eos> - Thank you for your patience.<eos> - Let's get back at it.<eos> Liam!<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> ENGIN is an avionic startup. The government just signed a billion-dollar contract with them this morning.<eos> I have feelings for you.
If you were Roarke and you wanted to frame a passenger for blowing up a plane, who would you choose?<eos> Politically, someone I'd want the country to think is a threat.<eos> Anyone from his registry.<eos> He tried to push it through again.<eos> It's still not popular.<eos> I don't know. What better way to frighten people into getting on board than a terrorist attack at the hands of a Muslim?<eos> God, that's what I was afraid of.<eos> Yeah, framing Raina for a mall bombing, that was a dry run.<eos> This is the main event.<eos> We need you.
If the perpetrators are on there, it serves Roarke's policy.<eos> Who's got access?<eos> Alice Winter.<eos> - And I can get it.<eos> - No way.<eos> - She'd kill you.<eos> Look, you can't risk blowing your cover.<eos> Your in with the Collaborators is our best hope of beating them.<eos> What... What if we fail today?<eos> We need them to still believe you.
Clay?<eos> Hey, wake up.<eos> - Clay! - Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, of course it would be you.<eos> Listen, hundreds, maybe thousands, of people are gonna die if you don't get us the call-and-response code for airborne terror threats.<eos> - There's no such thing.<eos> - Yes, there is.<eos> And we know that you can twist the right arm and get it for us.<eos> You know, I can see why people fall for you.
Oh, come on. Haven't I earned...<eos> I think that's enough for today.<eos> We need those flights and those names.<eos> Whatever you think you should do, do it.<eos> I trust your judgment.<eos> My assistant can validate your...<eos> Getting flights and passengers.<eos> Incoming.<eos> The bad news is, I just lost a bet.<eos> I trusted you.
We need those flights and those names.<eos> Whatever you think you should do, do it.<eos> I trust your judgment.<eos> My assistant can validate your...<eos> Getting flights and passengers.<eos> Incoming.<eos> The bad news is, I just lost a bet.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> Peter didn't.<eos> The good news is, now I get to take it out on you.
- seat 10-E. Udin Y., - CoastWest<eos> - flight four-zero-three, seat 14B. - Satara G., Pan Atlantic flight five-five-four, seat 35-B.<eos> Next plane is Southeastern sixteen. Southeastern sixteen, this is CIA operative Owen Hall.<eos> Initiate emergency landing response - on the following code. - Southeastern sixteen...<eos> All targeted flights are beginning emergency landing procedure.<eos> Bad news.<eos> All six of those planes are on their way to landing safely.<eos> No one lost their lives, including all those innocent Muslim men and women you tried to frame.<eos> So, it's over, Alice.<eos> For you.
There's still work to be done.<eos> You've got a presidency to topple.<eos> And we still don't know how.<eos> You can't leave.<eos> Nimah and Raina are both in custody.<eos> Alice Winter...<eos> She knows I turned on them.<eos> I feel like this is the part where I need to give a rousing speech. But all I can think of is... thank you.<eos> We would not have been able to do this without you.<eos> And we wouldn't be here without you.
Stop.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Let your mind rest.<eos> We won't see anything if you're all wound up.<eos> I'm not wound up.<eos> I'm just sober, finally.<eos> Yeah, well, you still need to take a moment.<eos> And if I'm being honest, I kind of need one, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry I made a pass at you.
I missed you.<eos> What did you and Lindsey do to her? How did you...<eos> Now stop.<eos> You don't get to walk in here and hiss at me like I'm the criminal.<eos> Now, we do this my way.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> How was prison? Did you like it?<eos> No.<eos> It's not fun, is it?<eos> Unlike you, I didn't deserve to be there.
And just as I don't judge race, I don't judge folks by who they love, either.<eos> Now get the hell out of my store, 'cause unless there's a Supreme Court case I haven't heard of, Obergefell v. Hodges is still the law of the land.<eos> Working deductively, the secret wouldn't be any of the topics you've already volunteered, because you wouldn't want to make it that easy on me.<eos> Genius, truly.<eos> So what is left that I wouldn't want to admit?<eos> Love.<eos> Is that what this is all about, love?<eos> Or my mother?<eos> No.<eos> For you.

If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.<eos> She does.<eos> Because she... she knows.<eos> That's the secret.<eos> What I don't want to admit about myself. Hold up.<eos> Let's play this out, because she will not lose to you twice.
Uh, I'm sorry. Full stop.<eos> Why would Spence say he's the father of...<eos> Quiet.<eos> You had eyes on me while I was in prison, didn't you?<eos> Spencie, don't ruin the moment.<eos> I don't want to, but I'm on the clock.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> I wanted to make sure things were just as uncomfortable for you as they were for me.
When we first sat down, you said you were going to show me what kind of man I am. And you have.<eos> Every time I touch this, you're getting warmer.<eos> I'm waiting for a phone call.<eos> So are we, Lindsey.<eos> Whoa, whoa. It's ok.<eos> There it is.<eos> If this is a trick, I'm going to kill all of us.<eos> I swear to you it's not a trick.<eos> And you'll want to hear what the person on the other end of this line has to say.<eos> At first I was furious, because the secret had to be the baby inside you.
But it should be mine.<eos> I wish it were mine.<eos> Because you and I... We deserve each other.<eos> That is the real secret.<eos> Kill her.<eos> Lindsey, I said...<eos> You bitch.<eos> You're pregnant?<eos> Lindsey, sweetheart, it's complicated, ok?<eos> No, it's not. Playing the game with Reid was more important than being faithful to you.
Now, obviously he's not old enough to understand it, but that's not what matters.<eos> My promise was that I would come home to him every night, and so far, I haven't broken it.<eos> How is Hank?<eos> He just started walking.<eos> Well, it's more like this little waddle.<eos> But the kid is walking.<eos> You know, I had no idea that I could love this much.<eos> Ok, I just have to say something.<eos> Of all the heroes I have met, and I have met a lot of heroes, you, Derek, "Chocolate Thunder" Morgan, are the most heroic.<eos> Ohh, ohh, ohh! That's for you.

Yes, sir.<eos> Go find a scapegoat, right now!<eos> Yes, sir...<eos> I...<eos> You're still up?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you want?<eos> It was Yang Bin's idea.<eos> I didn't know a thing.<eos> Why should I believe you?
Let's go.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Bao.<eos> This is Kai.<eos> Hi, Kai.<eos> He's taking over Yang Bin's turf.<eos> Sure, that's no problem.<eos> Hi, Kai, nice to meet you.<eos> This is our distribution plant.<eos> How much we'll sell depends entirely on you.
Captain.<eos> "Wait."<eos> "No Signal."<eos> What's going on?<eos> Kid, the drugs and the money will set you for life.<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> I want to get to know you better.<eos> Besides, this small batch doesn't amount to much for me.<eos> You're a big shot from a big city.<eos> What can a small place like this do for you?
Besides, this small batch doesn't amount to much for me.<eos> You're a big shot from a big city.<eos> What can a small place like this do for you?<eos> I want you to give me the Greater China market.<eos> What can you give me for it?<eos> From now on, you won't just be selling ingredients.<eos> I'll arrange permits, customs, processing and sales.<eos> Anything that Cheng Yi didn't pay you for, I'll pay.<eos> I promise that your profit will spike.<eos> How can I trust you?

The big shot has a big mouth, too.<eos> Do you have the guts to give it a try?<eos> During your treatment, we were worried that you wouldn't make it.<eos> So we injected some morphine.<eos> We're both in the drug business.<eos> Take as much as you need.<eos> Stop pretending.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Liu Haojun.<eos> I trust you.
Be free of danger and misfortune.<eos> Live long in peace.<eos> Be humble and gracious.<eos> Respect your elders.<eos> Then you shall be rewarded with life, beauty, happiness, health.<eos> You may place your flowers on the altar.<eos> My wife.<eos> Today is her birthday.<eos> You've done a good job in China.<eos> The elders... have taken an interest in you.
Huasheng.<eos> How have you been?<eos> I can't believe we're meeting again.<eos> Where is he?<eos> What's the rush?<eos> I've waited ten years for you.<eos> Cut the crap.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I kept him alive for ten years so that you would come back.<eos> Yunan, I can finally give closure to you and our child.
He lived up to his oath as a police officer.<eos> He showed the world the Chinese police force's resolve to rid the world of illegal drugs.<eos> As long as illegal drugs exist in the world, our efforts to fight it will not stop for a second.<eos> We salute you.<eos> In this operation, Li Jianguo openly defied his superiors' orders.<eos> However, he bravely sacrificed his life to save a fellow officer.<eos> That's something that every officer should learn.<eos> I hope that you will inherit his professionalism.<eos> Keep serving your country and your people by becoming a better police officer.<eos> We have a new mission for you.
Thanks.<eos> -I still can't believe it.<eos> -What?<eos> That we are sleeping here tonight?<eos> And every night for the next six years?<eos> The presidential quarters.<eos> Thank you for stripping me of my fear.<eos> I could strip you of other things, too.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> -But I want to see you.
The tunnels are a serious matter.<eos> If you want my help, you'll have to tell me who.<eos> -Emilia Urquiza.<eos> -What?<eos> Do you have the time?<eos> It's been 15 minutes since the last time you asked.<eos> I have a hard time being in confined spaces.<eos> Let me ask you a question, now that I have the chance.<eos> For a cigarette.<eos> Everything has a price with you, huh?
As if we owed you something.<eos> But you owe me something much bigger.<eos> Don't touch her, you son of a bitch!<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> [Emilia] How can it be that, after 20 years, you've changed so much in just the last two?<eos> If you leave, you're going alone.<eos> You're not taking my children.<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> -You can't stand sleeping next to me?<eos> Am I not enough for you?
-Excuse me?<eos> -You can't stand sleeping next to me?<eos> Am I not enough for you?<eos> What I can't stand, Diego, is being married to you.<eos> This -- all of this is what I can't put up with anymore.<eos> -Don't touch me.<eos> -Don't you understand?<eos> No one leaves a president.<eos> I'm not leaving the president.<eos> I'm leaving you, Diego.
And it's all nonsense.<eos> Talk to me, honey.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> My mom is a murderer.<eos> She killed my dad.<eos> Do you really believe your mom would do something like that?<eos> Why hasn't she come for us?<eos> Because she's afraid.<eos> You know what your mom's like.<eos> Remember everything she taught you and your sister.

Hmm?
Because of your criminal record.<eos> Sons of bitches.<eos> But I didn't tell them anything.<eos> Son, you have to be careful.<eos> I know.<eos> Look...<eos> I love Emilia, but she's a woman who's very important to the rest of the world.<eos> Much more so than you.<eos> I'll do everything I can to help both of you.<eos> But... if I have to choose between you and her...
I don't think it is.<eos> Anna is a reasonable person.<eos> You don't understand what I'm trying to say, Pepe.<eos> What do you think would happen if the people of this country were to find out about the situation?<eos> Do you think they would allow Anna to continue being the president's right hand?<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> Watch your attitude, Pepe.<eos> It's not in your best interest for your old friends to become your enemies.<eos> Tomas, I think you're losing touch with reality.<eos> You seem to think that the entire fate of the country depends on you.

You never quit.<eos> You got it in your head you wanted to box, and now here you are.<eos> You're almost a champ.<eos> Can you handle this?<eos> Handle what?<eos> The responsibility of defending your people and your barrio.<eos> Of being one of us.<eos> The Tepito Bitches.<eos> -I'm not old or strong enough...<eos> -You have the courage, the strength, and people's respect. We need you.
What can we do?<eos> Going in there would be a suicide mission.<eos> If we go, it'll be kill or be killed.<eos> Be killed, more likely.<eos> This isn't a hotel or a warehouse.<eos> I'm in.<eos> We're talking about a secret detention center filled with soldiers who are trained to kill.<eos> I'm also in.<eos> [Zyan] You've already done enough, don't you think?<eos> All the men close to you die.
[Juan] I did it to feel like less of an asshole.<eos> What will we do now?<eos> We'll do... what we always do.<eos> Here... we neither forgive... nor forget.<eos> Let's go to bed.<eos> I'm calling from Attorney Lieberman's office.<eos> It's really... [sighs]<eos> No, please don't put me on hold.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, if the mountain doesn't come to you...
Your children know you.<eos> They know who you are.<eos> And anyone who knows you knows everything they're saying is a lie.<eos> They have to know that.<eos> A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme music playing]<eos> [Maria] Remember last year?<eos> Maria, wait. Wait.<eos> -No.<eos> -Are you having second thoughts?<eos> I regret many things... but I don't regret you.
-No.<eos> -Are you having second thoughts?<eos> I regret many things... but I don't regret you.<eos> You know, I have to tell Patricia about your mom.<eos> -No, Daniela, please don't.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Maria, I'm doing everything wrong.<eos> I'm deceiving my team.<eos> I have to talk to her.<eos> Daniela, this isn't about you.
Are you listening?<eos> -Or do you have something better to do?<eos> -No.<eos> Ma'am... I have reason to believe Emilia has had contact with her family.<eos> This is huge.<eos> This is insane.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> I can try to succeed where so many others have failed.<eos> [Canek] Zyan.<eos> It won't be easy for you.
She'll turn herself in.<eos> I know her.<eos> She won't be able to resist.<eos> -[bell tolling] -[Diego] Viva Mexico!<eos> ONE YEAR AGO... [crowd cheering]<eos> Good night.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Please.<eos> After you turn yourself in...<eos> I'll do everything in my power to protect you and your family.
Is she in hiding?<eos> I wish I knew, but I have no idea.<eos> And I won't know until she decides to return home.<eos> [reporter 2] What do you think about the rumor that your mom killed your dad?<eos> I have to see my children.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You want me to stay here doing nothing after seeing my kids like that?<eos> If you go, you'll put them in more danger.<eos> She's my daughter... and she needs me.<eos> She needs you alive.
Drive, goddamn it!<eos> Drive!<eos> [Almada] With the utmost adherence to the law, we've ordered a national operation that will sweep the areas where organized crime operates and where we suspect the masterminds and perpetrators of the assassination are hiding.<eos> Those sons of bitches are headed to our barrio.<eos> You're losing a lot of blood.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I'm the one asking the questions.<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing... but they used me.<eos> Just like they used Diego.<eos> Like they used you.
Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Hey! I'm gaining on you, Brian.<eos> Meg, slow down.<eos> You're coming way too fast.<eos> Ew, Brian, what happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, idiot, you got to wait till the guy says go.<eos> Excuse me, do you think you can help me out?<eos> Sure, just let me do an awkward, extremely unattractive pool walk over to you.
Just fish out the one that's yours.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm Isabella.<eos> I'm Chris.<eos> Listen, my aunt is waiting for me, but it was nice to meet you, Chris.<eos> You, too.<eos> Enjoy the boobs of your morning.<eos> Afternoon!<eos> Enjoy the boobs of your afternoon.<eos> My word, Chris, that girl was totally into you.
But I can't ask you to take care of my children.<eos> Isabella, I want to do this.<eos> Chris, stop.<eos> You would really look after my kids for me?<eos> Of course I would.<eos> You're a wonderful man, Chris Griffin.<eos> Thank you. Gracias.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> Don't worry, I'm gonna take good care of you.<eos> I'm gonna call you "Juan," and I'm gonna call you "Two."
I will not allow this.<eos> Look, I made a promise to Isabella, and I'm gonna keep it.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, these two need to eat.<eos> He bought a breast-feeding book.<eos> Someone may want to pop in on him.<eos> There's no way Chris is gonna be able to take care of two babies.<eos> Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he opened his slut legs.<eos> No, Peter, that's not...<eos> Anyway, we got to call Child Services.<eos> Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.
This place looks pretty rough.<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> Santa Terrible.<eos> Look, there she is!<eos> Chris!<eos> What in the Mind of Mencia are you doing here?<eos> My babies!<eos> Isabella, I missed you so much.<eos> Ay, Chris, I missed you, too.<eos> Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> Please say you got the onion bun...<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Mongoose!<eos> Mongeese!<eos> Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.<eos> Hey, you must be Isabella.<eos> I came as soon as I heard about you.
All right, I'll see you later.<eos> What?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Laser tag orientation.<eos> Well, that's obviously not true.<eos> Yeah, that boy got lie-arrhea.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I-I got to follow him, find out where he's really going.<eos> Good idea.<eos> If I was you, I'd stick to him like glue-arrhea.
Yeah, absolutely.<eos> You said it, babe. Yeah, Chinese Peter very hungry.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, Lois.<eos> Just 'cause they're my kids and they all look like me doesn't mean we have anything in common.<eos> Daddy.<eos> I've never felt proud of any of my children until now.<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> For years, I have dreamed of one day traveling from Bavaria to play the accordion for my birth family.<eos> May I?<eos> I have just one question for you.
- Oh! - Out of Popsicle sticks. - Oh.<eos> That big one doesn't blink a lot, does he?<eos> Hey, Lois, where's your purse?<eos> Me and some of my kids are going to the movies.<eos> By the way, Dwarf Peter died.<eos> I didn't know what he ate, so I gave him nothing.<eos> His name was Tyler.<eos> He had a name.<eos> Everything you say, you say with pride.<eos> I like that about you.
He was not my boyfriend, Peter.<eos> And I wasn't about to stand by and watch him kick your ass.<eos> I was holding my own there.<eos> You were getting beat up.<eos> No, no, I meant I was holding my own nuts so he wouldn't kick them.<eos> But if he's not your boyfriend, why'd you kiss him?<eos> He kissed me.<eos> And I should've told you.<eos> I'm sorry if I hurt you, Peter.<eos> I guess Larry just reminded me of a younger version of you, and the truth is,
I liked that he was paying me a little attention, the way you used to.<eos> Maybe I have been taking you for granted, but I promise I'll make it up to you.<eos> I'll be the best husband ever.<eos> You already are.<eos> For God's sakes, when push came to shove, you stood toe-to-toe with a much younger man and fought for me.<eos> Oh, hey, by the way, uh, thanks, all my kids, for stepping in to help.<eos> Really, really appreciate that.<eos> But you're right, Lois.<eos> I'm gonna change.<eos> I'm gonna do all the stuff for you that Larry was doing.
Turns out, I should've listened.<eos> And there's the, awkward pause.<eos> Sorry, I'm a little out of practice with all this.<eos> You're doing fine.<eos> My friends have been after me to get back out there or whatever, but I don't even know what I want.<eos> Okay, no, sure, no, no.<eos> We all, we all want that, but...<eos> It's complicated, you know?<eos> No está complicado.<eos> - Is that you or me?
From 8:00 p.m. last night until... two hours ago.<eos> I see.<eos> And, said member was...?<eos> Sofia Martinez.<eos> Well, thank you for alerting me.<eos> I will make a note.<eos> Thanks, Nadine.<eos> Jay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good for you.
That's because I don't call you back.<eos> Yeah, well... why not?<eos> Mike, um, what we... shared on election night was...<eos> Crazy.<eos> Surprising.<eos> But, frankly, you're not my type.<eos> I get it.<eos> The hatchet man mystique, it's sexy, but it's intimidating.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Fine, I like you, Nadine.

That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Fine, I like you, Nadine.<eos> I like you and I would like to<eos> - go out with you.<eos> - You sound like a teenager.<eos> Americans have an underdeveloped language for romance.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, Maggie?<eos> The family of Colin Mitchell is here for you.
Did you try your song?<eos> I tried everything.<eos> Well, you better get unblocked.<eos> The secretary needs that speech in, like, three hours.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> I mean, Colin Mitchell is a hero.<eos> Traveling the world, speaking truth to power.<eos> Meanwhile, w-what have I done with my life?<eos> A man is dying in a Sudanese prison and you're making this about you?
Is there a more optimistic slant, or is that about the size of it?<eos> Well, our team just arrived in Jerusalem.<eos> Dr. McCord and Agent Maloof will be working directly with Mossad.<eos> Subtitle sync and corrections by awaqeded for<eos> Bess, I hear our little intel-sharing op<eos> - with the Israelis has borne fruit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I trust your marriage will survive it.<eos> - I mean it.<eos> - I believe you.
- His generals.<eos> And yet whoever Salnikov appointed theater commander of the Bulgaria mission must still be in his good graces.<eos> We think it's Vladimir Doroshevich.<eos> He's a hardliner, and one of Ostrov's righthand men.<eos> You worked on Intel inside Doroshevich's team during the Ukraine invasion, isn't that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> The file says your asset, Dmitri Petrov, was compromised and probably executed.<eos> Do you have any other access?<eos> I might.<eos> I'm onto you.
He was always pushing Ostrov to take a more aggressive stance towards Europe.<eos> Would you be willing to look at some intelligence we've acquired, give me your take?<eos> When I offered my assistance before, you told me it was impossible because of President Dalton's promise to the Russian government.<eos> What's changed?<eos> Part of the agreement with Russia is that they honor their neighbors' borders.<eos> This incursion into Bulgaria, covert as it may be, nullifies that deal.<eos> But if Salnikov knew I was in D.C...<eos> We have ways of protecting you.<eos> It's a risk, it is.<eos> It's up to you, of course.
The jogging thing's always an ambush.<eos> I know about your work with the European Independence League, or the "I Hate NATO Club,"<eos> or whatever the hell it's called.<eos> And you, you think I'm playing a double game 'cause I'm still on their payroll?<eos> Well, since you didn't tell me you were on it in the first place, yeah...<eos> - Elizabeth.<eos> - I kind of do.<eos> I would never betray you.<eos> Not for the kind of money they're offering, anyway.<eos> Fond as I am of you, Mike, you try to jack me around, my next conversation's gonna be with the attorney general.
I had no idea they were a cryptofascist creep squad.<eos> And once you uncovered the creep squad element?<eos> I quit.<eos> Months ago.<eos> Do you want to see my paystubs?<eos> I'm a cynic, but II draw the line at trying to destroy democracy.<eos> And II certainly wouldn't trade on our relationship.<eos> Well, you should have told me up front.<eos> There was nothing to tell you.<eos> And by the way, I don't work for you.
You kept sending me apartment listings.<eos> Um... well, I... yeah, you got me.<eos> Where are you moving?<eos> And when?<eos> But a-also where?<eos> Bert has a room for rent.<eos> So you're gonna be roommates with Bert?<eos> Uh, no, it's, uh, pretty private, actually, it's over his garage.<eos> So the only time I'll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.<eos> Well, good for you.
That's the importance you put on us having a baby?<eos> I'm happy about it, but, I mean, it's not like I did much.<eos> I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you.<eos> So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?<eos> No, I'm waiting till he's in a good mood.<eos> Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.<eos> I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.<eos> And he'll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.<eos> I guess.<eos> Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go...
Are you feeling okay?<eos> Not really.<eos> Apparently grief can make one less regular.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.<eos> Oh, the-the more details, the more sorry.<eos> Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.<eos> I made your favorite oatmeal... plain.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.

That's sweet, but you...<eos> you did just fine on your own.<eos> Well, I thought that, too, but I've come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.
I will.<eos> - And when you're at the gate?<eos> - Uh-huh. And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?<eos> I don't know what they look like, but sure. Oh.<eos> And don't forget to Skype me when you arrive.<eos> I won't.<eos> - And every morning.<eos> - Got it. Now of course, my 9:00 a.m. is your noon, so let's avoid the whole "good morning," "good afternoon" minefield, and let's just say, "Hello."<eos> Good thinking.<eos> And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do.
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...<eos> I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.<eos> Princeton.<eos> A fine institution.<eos> The place where Albert Einstein taught, and where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.<eos> And just remember, I'm proud of you. And I support you in all that you do.
Thank you. That means a lot.<eos> Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist, who's as smart as me, as tall as me, and has hair like Thor, well, then, I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.<eos> ♪♪<eos> How are you settling in?<eos> Pretty well.<eos> Princeton has a beautiful campus.<eos> Now, I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk.<eos> Then, would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate?<eos> They're both shocking.<eos> Actually, I want to hear about you.
Great.<eos> Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.<eos> Oh, why does he need a ladder?<eos> He doesn't; he just likes looking at them.<eos> Bring a book.<eos> Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki,<eos> She's back at Caltech for her postdoc.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello. - Hi.<eos> Oh, let me bring a chair for you.
All she's got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.<eos> Well, what do you want us to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch.<eos> Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.<eos> Come on.<eos> Looks don't matter to Sheldon.<eos> Because he only has eyes for you.
We'll all go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Pardon. I just need to... yeah.<eos> That was fun.<eos> It was like Mario Kart.<eos> Bye.<eos> We need to talk. Wh...<eos> Is this about Leonard and Amy?<eos> I don't like it either.<eos> Okay, I know you don't have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you.
Thanks for asking me.<eos> What's the occasion? He's here because, Mom had to go see the D-I-V-O-R-C-E lawyer for a couple hours.<eos> Aha.<eos> What are we doing here? We got army men today?<eos> - All right, well, we better...<eos> - Danno, I'm hungry.<eos> Hungry? Kid's hungry.<eos> There's a vending machine right down the hall. It is loaded with good things.<eos> Come on, Uncle Steve's gonna take you.<eos> Let's go. By the way, this, right here, this is from me to you.
- Oy.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You know that? You're a crazy person.<eos> Well, I'm not crazy, I'm just not interested in, like, a, like, a goof, like, a gag gift.<eos> I don't know why I try to be nice.<eos> I just wanted to get you something. Forget about it. All right?<eos> No, whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Hey, hey... Hey, you can't take back a gift.<eos> Well, open it.<eos> You know, this gesture of generosity<eos> - is very uncharacteristic of you.
That was... that was a legitimate question.<eos> You don't have to be a smart-ass with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. You know what, buddy?<eos> I know you're stressed about Rachel's divorce, but you need to tone it down a notch, okay?<eos> Why would you even bring Rachel...?<eos> It's got nothing... You were being sarcastic.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> - I was not being sarcastic.<eos> - No? No, and if we're being honest right now, I don't think this thing with you and Rachel is, is a healthy thing.
So, what about you and Ryan?<eos> Was all of that just for the tail last night?<eos> He's been so supportive lately, not doubting me as much.<eos> But I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.<eos> You told him you needed time.<eos> Maybe he used that time to grow.<eos> Or maybe he's just making me think that he's changed, you know?<eos> And then when things get difficult, he'll be back to the same old Ryan.<eos> Well, you know what? Something will happen, and you'll just know, one way or another, right?<eos> So, are you gonna say something or just make me watch you?
It was itchy.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We take care of each other. It's...<eos> It's the little things.<eos> Well, you keep it up, and you might just get her back. No.<eos> That's...<eos> That's not what this is about.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Take it from someone who notices these things... when you're not looking, she's looking at you and no one else.
- Unless Georges de La Tour painted a second Repentant Magdalen... and he didn't... this one had to be fake.<eos> The original's at LACMA.<eos> The rest of this art's real, though.<eos> You better produce, and fast, or I'm gonna let him have his way with you.<eos> I wouldn't mind.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Hey, we're in.<eos> Will and Iris came through.<eos> Establishing the link to Theo's home system.<eos> Pushing it to you.
- Shelby...<eos> You broke up with Maxine because you didn't want her tainted by the scandal of being with you.<eos> You don't have that same concern about me, do you?<eos> Because I am already damaged.<eos> - You...<eos> - I... have been so afraid of what other people think of me, instead of caring about what I think about myself.<eos> I don't want to keep making the same mistakes over and over again.<eos> I am not a mistake.<eos> But we would be.<eos> I am not the one for you, Clay.
I can't believe you've remembered that.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> The last time you were here, we were talking about girls.<eos> How's it going with dating?<eos> Bad. Bad, bad, bad.<eos> Most girls still completely ignore me, even when I'm wearing a leather jacket.<eos> Except Paige.<eos> Who's Paige?<eos> An annoying girl who's always bothering me when I'm wearing my headphones, and she wants me to study with her even though we're both getting "A"s.<eos> It sounds like she might like you.
Come here.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> A jacket, weirdo.<eos> Take it off.<eos> Why? I'm cold.<eos> There are a lot of people here now. The room's gonna heat up. I know Zahid runs hot.<eos> What?<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> A series of random and unsynchronized tests to determine whether Paige has what it takes to be your bae.<eos> I don't understand your methods, Zahid, but I trust you.
No, they want me to start right away.<eos> What do you guys think?<eos> Wow. That's exciting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's a lot to discuss.<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> We have to figure it out.<eos> I mean, you know,<eos> I'm sorry, honey, but I don't think there's any way that this could work.<eos> I mean, we need you at the same school as Sam, right?
Wow. That's exciting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's a lot to discuss.<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> We have to figure it out.<eos> I mean, you know,<eos> I'm sorry, honey, but I don't think there's any way that this could work.<eos> I mean, we need you at the same school as Sam, right?<eos> But we'll talk about it when your friends aren't here.<eos> 'Cause he doesn't have a onetoone aide anymore. And he relies on you heavily.
I didn't say anything.<eos> Okay, we're gonna go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay, I know that because of your autism, you might not know if you love me yet, and that's totally fine.<eos> But if you could figure it out by Thursday, that'd be great, because we're having dinner with my whole family and we could break the news to them then.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> It's about the baby.<eos> I'm tired of leaving you messages.<eos> Obviously, you don't care about this pregnancy, and that's fine.<eos> I was really upset about it before, but I can see now that if you can't be bothered to call back, well, we're better off without you.
Take care of yourself, okay?<eos> Take care of myself?<eos> What the...<eos> Hey, Elsa, what are you doing? What happened?<eos> What, did things get too real for you?<eos> You're being so selfish. You know that?<eos> Oh, good, good. I'm being selfish.<eos> Great. For once, something gets to be about me.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I liked you.
And my sister didn't even flinch.<eos> "Fine!<eos> Fuck it!<eos> I'm out of here!"<eos> And she left.<eos> My sister left at 18 and never came back.<eos> That's some gangster shit.<eos> I remember that day like it was yesterday.<eos> She was in the garage, loading the trunk of her car with all her shit, and I was upstairs in my room.<eos> And then my sister yelled up to my room, "I love you so much, Joe!"
And then I told him, "Joe, I'll buy you that hoverboard."<eos> I'm gonna get you a tutor, and she's gonna help you with your math.<eos> "You bring the grade up, it's done."<eos> So, I get the tutor.<eos> This is how shitty of a dad I am.<eos> Just for one week with the tutor, he has a quiz the following week.<eos> Four out of five right.<eos> Doesn't even apply to the grade.<eos> And I just looked at him like this:<eos> "Look at you, Einstein."
But that's everything I got.<eos> Okay, kids, give me your best worried looks.<eos> Ooh, that's good worry.<eos> And Maggie, when we visit Gil, you should think about your mom and me disappearing forever any time we step behind a wall.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Where am I?<eos> No, seriously, where did I go?<eos> It's so dark in here.<eos> Maggie!<eos> Ol' Gil, there must be something we can do for you.
Are you deliberately trying to sabotage this?<eos> I really think you are worth taking a shot on.<eos> I don't want to be anyone's shot.<eos> You know, sometimes you can be a little bit of a bully.<eos> Well, sometimes you can be a little bit of a stupid.<eos> - So, what's up?<eos> - Ivy.<eos> Things were going great, then all of a sudden, she started ghosting me.<eos> Stay close to Linus.<eos> Make him trust you.
- We're back to not knocking?<eos> - Where's my mother?<eos> - The less you know, the better.<eos> - I think that's up to me to decide.<eos> It's not.<eos> Our mission stays the same.<eos> You keep stitching, we keep mapping the brain until we have what we need to get to the other side.<eos> I get to decide how my story ends. - No one else.<eos> - Kirsten, wait.<eos> Not for you.
Seriously?<eos> Well, this was fun.<eos> - What's everyone's problem?<eos> - Millennials.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Girl problems.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Oh, look, we're twins.<eos> We're all going through stuff.<eos> I could use a friend, I was thinking maybe you, but clearly not.
- Look, even a simple "sorry."<eos> You know, "Linus, you're awesome",<eos> "but I just don't see us happening," that would do.<eos> I wouldn't be happy, but at least I'd know.<eos> Yeah, I pretty much had planned to say just that.<eos> But now that I'm with you...<eos> I can't do it.<eos> Linus... you are so awesome.<eos> I really do see us happening.<eos> I really want to believe you right now, but I don't think I can.
You two seemed to get along.<eos> Not as well as you and Amanda in the kitchen.<eos> - What did you say to her?<eos> - I may have simply put her on notice about using you to get information back to Stinger Senior.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I'm trying to protect all our asses, Linus.<eos> Who asked you to?<eos> And here's something, you're no genius when it comes to relationships, so just stay out of mine!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know things between you and Amanda are...
- I want a lawyer.<eos> - Yeah, that's not really our thing.<eos> He came to me.<eos> Wanted me to help him.<eos> I told him no.<eos> End of story.<eos> That sounds a lot like a story with only a beginning and a middle.<eos> Not sure I trust the ending.<eos> - What is gonna happen to me?<eos> - Well, that all depends on you.
- A couple minutes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Zelda.<eos> - You're going down this round.<eos> - Jake needs your help.<eos> - Don't you mean you need my help?<eos> No, Jake.<eos> He's waiting for us at the end of this game.<eos> He left us a message, and I think it has to lead to his killer.<eos> Why should I believe you?
My secret's out now.<eos> So is yours.<eos> Okay, stay back!<eos> Everybody get back!<eos> Game over!<eos> Well played, DK.<eos> Rick DeToro?<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of Jake Rowland.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Jake would've liked you.
We go, "Here, you decide what to do with this shit."<eos> [audience laughing] See you later.<eos> She has to figure out if you should have kids, if she should have them.<eos> That's her job. Because women have judgment.<eos> They have judgment. Men don't have judgment.<eos> Men have intent.<eos> Men just want to spray the world with their cum, just mist.<eos> "More of me.<eos> More of me."<eos> It's her job to go, "That's enough of you, I think.
Meaning?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> You're about as helpful as tits on a...<eos> You!<eos> Look what you've done to me!<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> I'm a monster!<eos> You're a miracle!<eos> You didn't even have feet!<eos> Now look at you, walking around on new legs, with hands that can crush steel...
- Lumber inspector.<eos> - Huh. Didn't know that was a thing.<eos> That's because you have no vision.<eos> - This, Danny...<eos> - This is your world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please, Figgis, for your sake, tell me you're joking.<eos> It's just a temporary setback, but I am going to fix this, trust me. That's the whole point.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> I wouldn't trust you to fix potato Salad!
It was murder.<eos> We're being hunted.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I know what Kevin and Edgar meant to you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I know what Kevin and Edgar meant to you.<eos> Yeah, I thought the days of losing my brothers were over.<eos> Just wish I knew what happened.<eos> I thought it was terrorists.<eos> They had some help.<eos> But, Jules, I need you to know that there's no place safer for you and Mary than right where we are now.
I'm serious, brother.<eos> I don't need any help.<eos> Get back to your car.<eos> Son of a bitch, kid.<eos> You sure you don't want some? - Caffeine makes me twitchy.<eos> - Not me.<eos> I'm special.<eos> I can drink a gallon and still stay steady on the gun.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I think the only thing steady about you is the constant stream of nonsense coming out of your mouth.
Oh, you piece of shit.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, brother.<eos> I know you guys were close.<eos> Yeah, I've talked to Tio already.<eos> They're bringing her back stateside.<eos> I'll check in as soon as I know something.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Why is everyone being so quiet?<eos> 'Cause we save all our talking for you, Mouse.
That heroin was stamped.<eos> That means someone owned it.<eos> Do you have any idea how hard it is - to transport that much horse?<eos> - Horse?<eos> What are you Scarface now?<eos> Whatever, man. Okay, this whole situation stinks.<eos> All right, do we even know who ordered us to hit the mullah?<eos> Do we even know who Johnson told about the wife's transport?<eos> Yeah, somebody's shutting people up.<eos> Hey, Z, I don't disagree with you, but ours is not to reason why.
Yeah, he was a piece of shit.<eos> Peter found a new line of income, one even his father didn't know about.<eos> Child pornography.<eos> Such people must be disposed of.<eos> I don't disagree, but why involve us in this shit?<eos> I couldn't bring my own men.<eos> As your friend said, uh, he was untouchable.<eos> And I needed backup.<eos> He used us.<eos> And something in it for you too.
Uh, let me...<eos> I really look forward to it. Yeah.<eos> What's your email?<eos> How much beef do you actually think is in this patty?<eos> I mean, the sign says quarter pound, but<eos> I'm calling bullshit on that.<eos> I swear we passed that honky-tonk like six times already.<eos> A worthwhile mission takes patience, Nadine.<eos> Turn left.<eos> I got a question for you, G-woman.
The key is communication. The lock is trust.<eos> - I like that. - Yeah.<eos> And I'm sure those guys would like some lasagna.<eos> Invite 'em in.<eos> Yo, fellas! Come on in.<eos> - Swagger, it's me.<eos> Memphis, I've been trying you for hours.<eos> Yeah, well, your buddy threw my cell phone out the window.<eos> - Turns out we picked up a tail. - Shit.<eos> I don't want to lead them to you or to Zehnder's evidence, so now that it's dark, I'm gonna try and shake 'em.
Clem's baby could solve the sterility problem?<eos> Are you proud of yourself?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You kidnapped...<eos> How does that even compute as right to you?<eos> It's not.<eos> Isaac is not safe.<eos> We have to go after Isaac.<eos> After you had the affair, all I saw was betrayal.<eos> Now Isaac is gone, I don't know how to look at you anymore.
- Really?<eos> I think you got some bad intel there.<eos> Detective, please, I'm well aware of your former life.<eos> Fine.<eos> Still not interested.<eos> Tarapoto, Peru.<eos> That's where your teammates will find the next hybrid they're looking for.<eos> And how the hell did you know about that?<eos> Are you gonna stand there asking questions, or are you gonna accept my offer and start getting some answers?<eos> - Got something for you.
That'sthat's all him.<eos> First time he used it was his high school science project.<eos> It's kind of been his thing ever since.<eos> I don't even think it's intentional...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So you're really leaving.<eos> Dariela.<eos> Dariela.<eos> You once told me it never mattered where in the world we were... as long as we were together.<eos> I need you here with me.
Well, a few things have changed in the last ten years.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I guess I just always thought that if... I could tell people the truth, that things would change.<eos> But it didn't stop Reiden from killing people, didn't stop the Shepherds.<eos> The same people that were in power then are in power now.<eos> And I got really sick of not seeing justice done.<eos> So, I went out and did it myself.<eos> All right, I'm still adjusting to the new super Jamie.<eos> I mean, for you it's been ten years.
The same people that were in power then are in power now.<eos> And I got really sick of not seeing justice done.<eos> So, I went out and did it myself.<eos> All right, I'm still adjusting to the new super Jamie.<eos> I mean, for you it's been ten years.<eos> For me, what?<eos> We set some birds loose on a beach, I took a nap, you cracked my skull open.<eos> How is that, by the way?<eos> To be honest, I don't know.<eos> But, um, this quest thing that you're on, it just seems a little dark for you.
I may have something in steerage.<eos> Done.<eos> My goodness, I haven't been in steerage since Li Yanping and I stowed away on a Chinese destroyer off the coast of Pulau Belitung.<eos> He's known as the debt collector, a mercenary paid to exact revenge.<eos> Exact revenge on me?<eos> For what?<eos> All I can tell you is, he's coming to Washington.<eos> But who hired him? Mr. Kaplan?<eos> No.<eos> Kate may be targeting people around you, but not you.
Someone else put him up to this.<eos> Unfortunately, I'm in no position to help.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Not there.<eos> You need to take this to Cooper.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I've spent 30 years building an intelligence network of spies, informants, patriots, traitors.<eos> I've used it to build an empire that exists for only two reasons, to keep me free and you safe.<eos> Elizabeth, I may not be there, but I have eyes and ears everywhere.<eos> And they tell me the debt collector is coming for you, which means he's the next blacklister.
Where are you?<eos> Traveling.<eos> I'll do what I can from here, but my reach is limited.<eos> You need to find Elizabeth, Harold.<eos> Listen to me, Edgar.<eos> That's your name, isn't it?<eos> Edgar Grant?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> The FBI raided your house this morning.<eos> So, if you hurt me, you'll only make it worse for yourself and your family when you're arrested.
Knowing what I would have to do in response.<eos> She was wrong to think Elizabeth and her child were safer without me in their lives.<eos> But in the end, she was...<eos> She did what she did out of love for the little girl she swore to protect<eos> what seems like a lifetime ago.<eos> It broke my heart.<eos> That day in the woods.<eos> Hearing the gunshot.<eos> Leaving her behind.<eos> Right or wrong, it was between you and her.
Sir, I could be wrong, but, uh, I think I might know where agent Keen is.<eos> Some kids at Horizon middle school reported seeing a woman matching Mr. Kaplan's description, and she was holding a key ring that said "Troop 14441."<eos> Their old cabin is on Johnson lake.<eos> Get me the local authorities on the line.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> From you, nothing.<eos> This is all about getting to Kaplan.<eos> Yes.<eos> By taking advantage of her love for you.
Feels like god's work.<eos> Until you realize there is no god, and you've committed sins for which there is no absolution.<eos> - I just did what you asked.<eos> - Nothing more.<eos> Word to the wise.<eos> Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.<eos> Confucius.<eos> Stunningly applicable even after all these years.<eos> Two graves.<eos> Is the other one for you or for Kaplan?
Here. Here.<eos> Two rabbits.<eos> There's a woman in the other room.<eos> I need you to get her to divulge the name and the address of Kaplan's new driver.<eos> I'm skipping euchre with the Saltmans to tell you this face-to-face--<eos> I'm out.<eos> Please, we can discuss that later.<eos> I'm with you... what, 19 years?<eos> There's talk of bodies turning up, an investigation.<eos> I wanna help, but you're hotter than a 4-peckered billy goat, and I can't risk doing another stretch, not even for you.

- You know where to find them?<eos> - I already did.<eos> He's standing right in front of me.<eos> This is Mako Tanida.<eos> He killed some of the Bureau's best men and women.<eos> And then Reddington goes and kills him.<eos> Why would Reddington do that?<eos> In exchange for your protection.<eos> I followed you to the woods.<eos> I saw you and Keen with Reddington.
You won't be using that arm again.<eos> But it's your left arm.<eos> I know you're right-handed.<eos> I know that because we've worked together for 11 years.<eos> I know your wife has diabetes, that your daughter's favorite animal is a hippo.<eos> I know you love Chinese food, that you eat it every Wednesday when you shack up with your girlfriend in her apartment above WuFat Noodle House.<eos> I know you skim an extra grand every week to help pay for that girlfriend.<eos> Abe, you steal my money so you can get laid, which I've ignored because you're an accounting wizard.<eos> What I cannot ignore is your betrayal.<eos> You are how Mr. Kaplan has drained my accounts.
I can't do that.<eos> No one can.<eos> He'll remain here until he agrees to testify, which he will never do. Come on.<eos> There's got to be something...<eos> You're a smart girl, Janet.<eos> You saw an opportunity and you took it.<eos> Can we please just focus on aram?<eos> I'm doing that.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> To tell him the truth about you. About me?
Baz.<eos> My god.<eos> I need an ambulance. I'm at 501.<eos> Hello, Kate.<eos> Raymond.<eos> Clever use of Laurel hitchin to commandeer the grand jury.<eos> A critical oversight on my part.<eos> You're so focused on destroying me you're willing to hurt one of the few people you've ever loved.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was so focused on you I didn't see that getting you away from her is unnecessary.
Man about the house.<eos> Be nice to have someone around the house to talk to.<eos> I can hardly get a word out of my son.<eos> Do you think he might be...<eos> Say it.<eos> Straight.<eos> You're a cheeky bitch!<eos> - What about Evie?<eos> - What? What about her?<eos> Well, going all the way to Australia to get away from you.
Evie, look.<eos> I've got a seal's willy bone!<eos> - Jonjo...<eos> - Is it a boy monster or a girl?<eos> I heard something.<eos> Is it the Feds?<eos> Why did you let me drink so much?<eos> You're off tomorrow.<eos> Relax.<eos> - Do you think Leighton fancies you?
- Jonjo...<eos> - Is it a boy monster or a girl?<eos> I heard something.<eos> Is it the Feds?<eos> Why did you let me drink so much?<eos> You're off tomorrow.<eos> Relax.<eos> - Do you think Leighton fancies you?<eos> - Leighton?<eos> Do you not see the way he looks at you?
My infamous big brother.<eos> But I got to admit, you're a bit of a disappointment.<eos> Well, so is finding out your sister's a psychopath.<eos> Why are you spreading the hybrids?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Help me understand.<eos> You want to end the world.<eos> Why?<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> My father never told me about you.
Must have fried out our earpieces earlier.<eos> You know, summoning rods will tend to do that.<eos> Abe!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Great.<eos> What's with the disembodied Logan voice?<eos> It's weirding me out.<eos> You said there was a problem here?<eos> Where were you?<eos> We needed you.
Mitch, let go!<eos> - You failed as a father.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - You let Connor die.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You think our father was a madman?<eos> A monster?<eos> He laid down his life for you.
Shut up.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - You let Connor die.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You think our father was a madman?<eos> A monster?<eos> He laid down his life for you.<eos> His son.<eos> Got it!<eos> Behind you!
Okay.<eos> Guess we'll be going now.<eos> Word is out.<eos> It doesn't matter where you go, you won't be able to protect her.<eos> Well, he's right about one thing...<eos> You are now the most important person in the world.<eos> Let's go find out why.<eos> You know, most people, they just worry about running into their ex at the grocery store, not arresting them for murder.<eos> I told you, I didn't kill Leanne.<eos> And, against my better judgment, I'm starting to believe you.
You were told not to do this.<eos> Problem with the hybrids is they were uncontrollable.<eos> Like feral animals.<eos> But I fixed it.<eos> You used human DNA.<eos> Your DNA?<eos> Abigail.<eos> I thought you'd be happy.<eos> This was your project.<eos> And I fixed it for you.
Really.<eos> But we don't have much time.<eos> Go collect all of your research.<eos> I'll be there soon.<eos> I just, I need to say good-bye.<eos> I love you, Abigail.<eos> I love you, too, Dad.<eos> Hey. You know, if you asked me to stay, I'd consider it.<eos> That's tempting, but I can't.<eos> My only living relative wants to kill me, so the safest place for you is not here.
I hate to do this, but, uh, I have orders to keep you here.<eos> Orders from who?<eos> Your father.<eos> Well, is he on his way?<eos> No.<eos> No, he has to stay with Jackson.<eos> It's the only way for the plan to succeed, cure the animals.<eos> Jackson is dying.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I got one for you:
- Batgirl knows best.<eos> - She's right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Destroy them.<eos> Principal Waller, I wanted to let you know that<eos> I've increased the Wi-Fi capacity and we can handle all the guest for the games.<eos> Thank you, Lena.<eos> Sounds like you're really on top of all the IT girl duties.<eos> I try.<eos> Anything else I can do for you?
Now if your mundanities are complete,<eos> I believe it's time for my speech.<eos> Thank you for hosting us on your humble planet.<eos> Having coached Korugar Academy to victory in the past eight games--<eos> Oh, knifster!<eos> Oh, I have missed the you.<eos> Starfire.<eos> You haven't changed.<eos> How unfortunate.<eos> I made for you the gift of the luck that is good.
Oh, my precious ears.<eos> Students.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourselves.<eos> If that kind of nonsense happens again,<eos> I will cancel the games.<eos> Now, go to your rooms and prepare for tomorrow's competition.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Absolutely not!<eos> I have garlic in my eye.<eos> I expected more from you.

It's with you by my side I know I belong<eos> Lashina!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I heard you singing.<eos> Thought you must have been reminiscing.<eos> That song gets stuck in my head.<eos> It was always my favorite.<eos> Remember how you used to have those nightmares?<eos> It was bad news if your crying woke Granny.<eos> I'd sing to you until you went to sleep.
Oh, no!<eos> Batgirl!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Slice and dice.<eos> Good gorka, I am oozing my life goop.<eos> Come on, Furies.<eos> - Hey, Granny.<eos> - Out of my way, Big Barda.<eos> I don't take orders from you anymore.
Coast is clear.<eos> Letting the Furies do the hard work for us was a nice stroke. Letting the Furies do the hard work for us was a nice stroke.<eos> A tip off to Batgirl's security system and bang, bang, bing, bang!<eos> The Furies are out and the Responsometer is ours.<eos> The army is 92% complete.<eos> SO cool.<eos> How great am I gonna look commanding these things?<eos> Very great, Master.<eos> Platinum.<eos> I have a treat for you.
We are the strongest when we do the blast of togetherness.<eos> Diana!<eos> You're safe here.<eos> I'm going back to fight. No!<eos> You should stay here.<eos> Protect me.<eos> Uh... I mean, protect us.<eos> Should any of those things escape the stadium.<eos> But they need me.<eos> I need you.
Hello?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Oh, you're still alive.<eos> Pity it's come to this.<eos> Now I must reveal myself.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Just get me out of here, and I'll finish the job.<eos> The supers are right about one thing.<eos> There is no greatness without sacrifice.<eos> And for my greatness, I'm sacrificing you.
"Hey, look at this!"<eos> It's a picture of my dog, "but I put a hat and glasses on it so it would look like a person."<eos> "It still looks kind of like a dog a little bit."<eos> "Hey, look, it's a picture of you!"<eos> But look at your jacket and your hair!<eos> "Look at the way you used to...<eos> "Remember that hair?"<eos> So you needed that time for the picture to make any sense or have any resonance.<eos> Nowadays, you go,<eos> "Hey, would you like to see a picture of you standing right where you are one second ago?"
"Just leave me alone, would you?"<eos> "I've got to write shit into a magic phone and stuff."<eos> I've got no time for this... "fucking dog stuff."<eos> Then my dog goes, "You're right."<eos> You know, I love you, but I...<eos> "I push and I push and I push, and I push you away."<eos> "I'm no good."<eos> "I'm no damn good."<eos> "But what say..."<eos> what say I just stood here and stared at you...
It's all about location.<eos> I popped out here.<eos> Anybody brown, we popped out here, we made it.<eos> We're the rappers that made it.<eos> What's wild is, I never even knew how the whole X-Men Origins story went down.<eos> It's crazy, because we know nothing about our parents and our parents know nothing about us.<eos> "Dad, your favorite color?" "Stanford!"<eos> "What?<eos> No."<eos> "No, I want to know more about you." "Why?
You bring nothing to the table.<eos> I see you getting mad. "Hell, no.<eos> I have a personality."<eos> Where do you think you got that from, dummy?<eos> Us.<eos> Clothes, culture, money.<eos> "Whoa! I have opinions." No, you don't.<eos> And then you have the audacity to be, like,<eos> "Hey, why are you so melodramatic?"<eos> Because I went to war for you.
Late at night, back and forth, back and forth.<eos> One night she was like, "Hey, come over."<eos> I bike over to her place, white picket fence, McMansion, Ford Expedition, Eddie Bauer edition.<eos> "Oh, they made it!"<eos> Mrs Reed opens the door.<eos> Her father is this successful retired judge.<eos> Mrs Reed's like, "You want brownies?" "Yeah.<eos> Cool."<eos> "Hey, stay for dinner." "We just had brownies, but okay."<eos> We're sitting there at the dinner table. And now Mrs Reed's like, "Hey, honey, we know so much about Bethany, but we don't know anything about you.
She says nothing, like a G.<eos> Bell rings.<eos> I'm walking to my locker.<eos> I hear footsteps.<eos> She's like, "Wait up." I was like, "What's up?"<eos> "Oh, that was crazy back there.<eos> What are the chances?"<eos> She's like, "Listen, you know, ever since my family moved from Nebraska, you've been my best friend.<eos> And you're really special to me.<eos> This year wouldn't be the same without you.
30 second time-out.<eos> Do you understand what's about to go down?<eos> You're about to go to prom with Bethany motherfucking Reed."<eos> "This is the American dream.<eos> This is what Dad fought for."<eos> Ding-dong. Mrs Reed opens the door.<eos> She has this look of concern.<eos> And I look over her shoulder, and I see Jeff Burke putting a corsage on Bethany's wrist.<eos> And she's like, "Oh, my God, honey, did Bethany not tell you?<eos> Sweetie, we love you, we think you're great.
Listen, me and my girlfriends live in Manhattan and we were wondering if we could get some tix?"<eos> Question mark.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know if you know what this means.<eos> But, you know, if life gives you lemons, sometimes you've got to make "revenge lemonade."<eos> Sprinkle in a little irony.<eos> Reply, son.<eos> Reply.<eos> "Bethany, comma, enter.<eos> Totally remember you.
Boom. I go to the airport.<eos> We go from New York, Chicago, to Nashville to LA.<eos> I pick up my Toyota Camry L-motherfucking-E.<eos> Don't you ever forget about it.<eos> Cloth interior for life.<eos> Whipping through the streets of LA.<eos> "Hello, headliner. What do you need?"<eos> "Hasan bhai, Dad had a heart attack.<eos> Hey... idiot, pick up your phone.<eos> I need you.
Do you know what it's like to have a parent that controls your life?"<eos> "No, I don't. What is that like?<eos> Do tell.<eos> I would love to hear that story."<eos> "Tell me more."<eos> What?<eos> She's like, "I wish I could have gone with you.<eos> But I can't change the past.<eos> I never thought you would want to talk to me ever again.<eos> But the reason why I write about you is because I see you kept your promise.
"No, I don't. What is that like?<eos> Do tell.<eos> I would love to hear that story."<eos> "Tell me more."<eos> What?<eos> She's like, "I wish I could have gone with you.<eos> But I can't change the past.<eos> I never thought you would want to talk to me ever again.<eos> But the reason why I write about you is because I see you kept your promise.<eos> So even if you never want to talk to me ever again, I'll always be rooting for you."
You're good enough." But that's not the American dream.<eos> It's not asking for a co-sign.<eos> It's what every generation did before you.<eos> You claim that shit on your own terms.<eos> Pizza Hut pizza sliders.<eos> Nine in a box for just ten bucks.<eos> That's you.<eos> You're not Hasan Minhaj. You're "Hussan Minhajj".<eos> This is new brown America.<eos> The dream is for you to take, so take that shit.
Ahh, sorry.<eos> I woke up, and you weren't in bed, you were gone, and I...<eos> Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fine, I just...<eos> I thought maybe...<eos> You miss me?<eos> I take it Camille didn't come home?<eos> No, I haven't been able to get hold of anyone.<eos> - Nothing from the NSA?<eos> - Nada.<eos> Okay, well, I don't know about you, but I can't sit on my hands much longer.
It's a 30-minute job, I'll be done in 10.<eos> Okay, I'll look around the lab and see if there's anything else that's... been moved around or changed.<eos> Cameron?<eos> I found something!<eos> Cameron?<eos> Cameron?<eos> This is pretty cool, huh?<eos> For a Deadmau5 show.<eos> Deadmau5 wishes he were this cool.<eos> All right, question for you.
I really think that's our lead.<eos> Oh, was "Mother" looking out for us when we got trapped and nearly died in the garage?<eos> We don't even know if she exists or if she's just some NSA stalling technique.<eos> But we do know Stinger, and this has his fingerprints all over it.<eos> Kirsten, this is not about Stinger.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> You were the only one left when I bounced.<eos> Why weren't you taken?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Are you and Maggie and the NSA doing this to get me to trust you again?
You were the only one left when I bounced.<eos> Why weren't you taken?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Are you and Maggie and the NSA doing this to get me to trust you again?<eos> Work with you?<eos> Forgive you?<eos> Listen to yourself, you're being ridiculous!<eos> Why?<eos> Because you say so?<eos> Why should I trust you?
Cameron...<eos> I'm gonna make the bounce.<eos> Jake.<eos> Coco Soo?<eos> Jamie B?<eos> I wanna speak for Tom, the same way I spoke for you all, but I...<eos> I can't do it alone.<eos> Yes, you can, Kirsten.<eos> Ed.<eos> Tom needs you.
Tom is the most... silent of us all.<eos> Nine squares.<eos> Nine monitors.<eos> Cameron... I'm not bouncing yet.<eos> I think I've figured it out.<eos> The images on each monitor are all part of one big puzzle.<eos> They were deliberately separated, but if I arrange them just right, they might tell me something.<eos> So, Cameron, if this is all a stitch, then all the conversations we had weren't really between us.<eos> Tom's memories are clearly mixing with my emotional state.<eos> Anything that felt out of the ordinary coming from you, must've been coming from Tom.
He seems out of it.<eos> There's a woman here.<eos> Yeah. He's stuck in the past.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> It's not the same flying without Reed.<eos> Flying without you Reed.<eos> Frontal limbic network's all lit up.<eos> Fred's feeling guilty about something.<eos> Man, this shouldn't have happened.<eos> Not to you.
Okay. Well, you don't have to say that.<eos> - I know my mother.<eos> - Really?<eos> Do you?<eos> 'Cause she's actually incredibly insightful.<eos> Maybe bringing you to her was a bad idea.<eos> I think you're being too hard on her.<eos> She loves you.<eos> Okay, well, did she tell you anything?<eos> About you, not me.
I'm meeting her tomorrow at 8 a.m.<eos> Can we use your apartment to meet?"<eos> And I said, "Of course, sure." You know.<eos> "Use your key. I'll be sleeping. But, yeah."<eos> So, the next morning, she forgot her key, of course.<eos> And she's knocking at the door, and I go to answer the door.<eos> My eyes are, like, glued shut.<eos> And I open the door, and she goes, "Sarah, this is Amber."<eos> And I said, "Amber, it's so nice to meet you.<eos> I've heard so much about you." And I grabbed her hand.
And she had a huge... She had a sign, like, twice her size.<eos> And it said, uh, "Abortion is bloody murder."<eos> And the "bloody" was, like, in red paint, dripping down.<eos> And that was the first time I was like, "Oh, they had to go to, like,<eos> Michaels or Blick's or something and buy crafts.<eos> Hobby Lobby, probably."<eos> And she goes:<eos> "God hates you."<eos> And I was like, "Do you really think God hates?"<eos> And she goes, "Yeah, he hates you."
Who is this?<eos> A friend... with the same agenda.<eos> Atlas.<eos> Check the message.<eos> All roads lead to Tanz.<eos> Who are you?<eos> RE/SYST?<eos> The global hacker collective?<eos> If we can get the crystal from Nicholas, we can rebuild our own EmDrive.<eos> I don't want to be without you anymore.
Hey, hey. What's go... what's going on?<eos> Dad, there's, um... something important I need to tell you.<eos> Hey, I just found a first edition Hemingway from a book dealer in Newton.<eos> Jillian.<eos> Laura.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'ml'm working here now.<eos> I thought your dad told you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I got some news for you, as well, Jills.
What do you want?<eos> Katya, your government's cut off all communications with the United States.<eos> We're on the brink of war, and we don't know why.<eos> You mentioned something about Atlas being the cause?<eos> Yes.<eos> You must know something more about it.<eos> Why don't you ask Mr. Tanz?<eos> He spearheaded it.<eos> I'ml'm afraid II don't understand.<eos> Does this photo have any meaning to you?
He's a professor at Columbia University, and he takes me places.<eos> Classy places.<eos> Places in Midtown.<eos> I've been to the opera, Neil.<eos> Have you ever even heard of Don Giovanni?<eos> - Sure. That's...<eos> He's like...<eos> - [tires screeching]<eos> Hey, you must be Neil.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
- And ultimately I wonder, what is the point of it all?<eos> [car honks] - Beth!<eos> They're here! They're here! - Oh!<eos> [all shouting] Claire!<eos> Oh! - [laughs] Hey!<eos> - [car honks] Hey, I'm lost.<eos> Does anyone know where Camp Firewood is?<eos> [all] Katie!<eos> It's so great!<eos> - Oh! - Look at you!
I've been... I work at a bar.<eos> That was good.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> [all] Gary Chester Silverson!<eos> [car honks] - There's Coop!<eos> Hey, man!<eos> All right!<eos> - Coop!<eos> Hey, Katie.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about you, Coop.
That was good.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> [all] Gary Chester Silverson!<eos> [car honks] - There's Coop!<eos> Hey, man!<eos> All right!<eos> - Coop!<eos> Hey, Katie.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about you, Coop.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about you, too.
Murderer.<eos> Manc lad.<eos> Works the boats.<eos> What you getting all serious for?<eos> You do know if they see us together, we go back inside... for good.<eos> What about our agreement?<eos> What agreement?<eos> I can't believe you just said that.<eos> We agreed to look out for each other once we were out.<eos> Yeah, I am looking out for you.
He likes to bring his buddy.<eos> Two of 'em?<eos> How does that work?<eos> At the same time?<eos> My tips don't exactly buy me new brake pads.<eos> Don't tell me you're jealous.<eos> Mary...<eos> Get down.<eos> Hands.<eos> I keep thinking about you. I'm sorry, I...
I just need to know how many are going.<eos> Could I just have a word with him?<eos> Mr. Petrie's here.<eos> No.<eos> As you were, please.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, Desmond do you have any idea how far from the shore you are?<eos> All you had to do was ask.<eos> Hm. "Need £80."<eos> I've always looked after you.
I saw him in the house.<eos> I don't know about Dessie's room.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Hello.<eos> Blake Albrighton.<eos> It's D.S. Redford.<eos> I need to talk to you about Dessie and Petrie.<eos> Are you ready to tell me why the police suspected you?
It's really itchy.<eos> I can't imagine anything more terrifying.<eos> Will I shut up?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You thought you were gonna die.<eos> Not as bad as I thought it would be.<eos> I'm gonna keep you safe.<eos> Let's get some air.<eos> It's no secret that Baxter's behavior towards you has been concerning to staff.
We were good together.<eos> I know.<eos> Really, really good.<eos> I know.<eos> It was a tough day.<eos> You know what?<eos> What?<eos> You were right.<eos> You were right to push him. You've been great with him lately.<eos> He's been needing you much more than me, which has been hard for me, but, clearly, really good for him.
I know.<eos> But... imagine having a young child that was just diagnosed... and a toddler.<eos> And the person that you love most in the world and the person you trust splits.<eos> So, yeah, I kept Sam separate and safe.<eos> Because I didn't know if you were gonna leave again.<eos> Honey, I...<eos> It was wrong.<eos> I've been so angry, and I've been holding it over you for so long.<eos> And I'm done. I'm done doing that.<eos> He needs you. I need you.
You're one of the chosen ones.<eos> That's right.<eos> Identical information on both pieces of paper.<eos> Except on that save the date, you're gonna get a pretty cool, insecure picture of the two of us.<eos> That's a magnet.<eos> Put that on the fridge.<eos> Decorate your home with our faces.'"<eos> You see those pictures, you're like, "Oh, fuck.<eos> I can't go to this."<eos> They're just looking at you like, "This is what love is, right?
Of course you can.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll finish up here, and we'll go, okay?<eos> You want to help me put away the groceries?<eos> No.<eos> Wow, I have never seen a less photogenic family.<eos> Yeah, we pride ourselves on that.<eos> Can we be done now?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Oh, look at you in this one. Look at you scowling!
I'm always nice.<eos> I'm probably not supposed to be telling you this, but Casey has some sort of boyfriend.<eos> Oh, yeah, I know that.<eos> I read all her texts.<eos> I love that.<eos> Cool shirt.<eos> Thanks. I'm hoping it'll get me a practice girlfriend.<eos> I was being sarcastic. You look stupid.<eos> But hey, you're not hideous.<eos> I'm sure some sad insecure girl will crush on you someday, deep in the very far future.
Yes.<eos> Liam, perfect timing.<eos> I need you to draw up instructions for Harris's team on how to extract the crystal.<eos> - No.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm going. To London.<eos> Okay, Rambo.<eos> Do you want a team or is this a oneman mission?<eos> - Look, I need to see this through.<eos> - Yeah, well, I need you here with me.
You did good out there.<eos> This could make the difference for all of us.<eos> You're a real hero, Liam.<eos> Hey, you ever need to talk to someone about Croft... I've been there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thought we'd lost you there for a moment.<eos> Yeah, you and me both.<eos> I reached Calhoun.<eos> They're calling off the dogs.<eos> I don't want to be without you anymore.
That was Jesus Christ our Lord and savior that made them do that, okay?<eos> If he did anything, he did everything, including that, all right?<eos> He did it, like, on the eighth day or some shit.<eos> "And on the eighth day, little girls will grab their pussies from behind."<eos> And even... And even the disciples were like, "Whoa, already?"<eos> Like, we can do that later." He was like, "It's what I thought of now.<eos> No order.<eos> We'll get them all done."<eos> And then he made lakes or whatever. "Hey, Dad. Excuse me, Dad."<eos> I have a question for you. Hey, Dad.
Only you can enjoy a delicious orange whenever you so choose.<eos> Yeah, player.<eos> Good logic.<eos> "See what the fuck she want now."<eos> So, I turn around real as fuck and I say, "Yeah?<eos> What the fuck you want now?"<eos> She's still pointing, not wavering at all, being a kid, and she says, "Well, um, do you want to pick one?"<eos> And I'm like, "Man, I don't give a fuck about this whole situation", but... I am taller than you and... logistically, it does make sense."<eos> So, I grabbed the orange like a boss and I handed it to her.<eos> And in my head I thought, "Don't ever say I never did nothing for you."
Her chamber!<eos> The computers, the monitors.<eos> Everything is just gone! Where's my mother?<eos> The less you know, the better.<eos> Is this, um, too soon?<eos> Us doing the whole sister routine?<eos> Maybe, but... I like it.<eos> We know as well as you do that you've been seeing Daniel Stinger.<eos> What is gonna happen to me?<eos> Well, that all depends on you.
I'm out of here.<eos> No way.<eos> You know all Linus ever did was defend you, right?<eos> And the really sad thing is, is that you are... totally incapable of knowing how much you just hurt my best friend.<eos> I do know.<eos> One day soon... this will all make sense.<eos> You literally messed with my head.<eos> I have spent every day since then trying to make it up to you.<eos> Doesn't that mean something?<eos> No! Not if we can't trust you.
No, Maggie.<eos> This is exactly why you need to talk to me more.<eos> Ivy, Stinger, my mother...<eos> they're my family.<eos> They're not just NSA cases.<eos> Yes, they are NSA cases.<eos> But not only do you work for the NSA, you work for me.<eos> I tell you what you need to know to do your job.<eos> Yes, Maggie.<eos> I do work for you.
This may be your best and only shot at actually stopping Daniel Stinger.<eos> Use all your resources.<eos> They're not kids, Maggie.<eos> It is too dangerous.<eos> Keeping this team safe is one of the few really good things that I have done in my life, and I am not going to compromise it, not even to get Stinger.<eos> I get it.<eos> And you're not alone in this, okay?<eos> I know.<eos> The truth is I haven't felt alone since you joined the team.<eos> None of this works without you.
And you're not alone in this, okay?<eos> I know.<eos> The truth is I haven't felt alone since you joined the team.<eos> None of this works without you.<eos> I mean that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Any LAPD detective could do my job.<eos> Come on, Quincy, you know you're more than just a job.<eos> The team, they look to you.<eos> They need you.
What?<eos> You know I eat when I'm nervous.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> It's gonna be great tonight.<eos> Are you Detective Quincy Fisher?<eos> Who's asking?<eos> I'm Kate Ronan.<eos> The person behind All In.<eos> And I surrender.<eos> Special furniture just for you.
There's no way out, Kate!<eos> I knew this was gonna be a suicide mission, but it'll be worth it when I see you dead.<eos> Flank her.<eos> You never should've left me to die, Maggie.<eos> Kate!<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Thanks for having my back.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Recovering.<eos> Kate was willing to sacrifice her own life out of sheer hatred for you.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.<eos> The NSA is going to terminate Jacqueline.<eos> The last time we spoke, you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> What's different now?<eos> Things have changed.<eos> Kirsten and...<eos> Linus and... the whole team.<eos> They all hate me.<eos> You're my only real family.<eos> - I want to believe you.
Hey, guys.<eos> How was Waterville?<eos> It was really fun.<eos> It's always fun to get away from camp. Even for an hour.<eos> Totally.<eos> Look, I've been begging her to move in with me.<eos> I want to get married.<eos> But if she's not willing to make a commitment, why should I be?<eos> Oh, I don't know, mate.<eos> Seems like this is between you and Claire.
But I will find a buyer that cares about this place as much as we all did.<eos> And it has been an honor to be your camp director.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, George, the Bill Clinton videotape I sent you...<eos> I bet you dollars for donuts that he'll defeat you next November.<eos> - Unless...<eos> - Unless what?<eos> Unless I campaign for you, George.
Good afternoon.<eos> What can I get you? Bowl of your chili.<eos> How 'bout you, big boy?<eos> I'll have a Denver omelet and a side of your buns.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Oh, shit! Give me that sugar. Give me that sugar.<eos> I'm giving you the sugar!<eos> How about some cream?<eos> No, here we go!<eos> Oh, shit! Good for you, man.
That's the spirit.<eos> It's luck and serendipity.<eos> Oh, yeah. Coop told me about the spirit.<eos> It's that totem thing, right?<eos> Uh... Yeah, well, you know, there's more to the spirit.<eos> They'll explain it to you.<eos> That's cute.<eos> No, it's a way of life and it's a philosophy.<eos> Yeah, Ginny, it's like when you forget to set your alarm clock, but you wake up the next morning at the exact right time.<eos> That's the spirit of Camp Firewood... watching over you.
So I really need you to embody the roles of Theseus, Hippolyta, Puck, and Bottom.<eos> So get comfortable in that donkey mask, Rory.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is drama for beginners.<eos> I used to teach this class with Ben.<eos> I'm so sorry, this is a closed rehearsal...<eos> - Susie, oh, my God!<eos> - Little Logan?<eos> - God, look at you!
Yes! Yes, tell the world, darling.<eos> Send a, you know, what's the...<eos> - A telegram?<eos> - A telegram.<eos> Is there anything you can't do?<eos> It's gonna be one hell of a wedding.<eos> Garth, you have a phone call in the infirmary.<eos> - For me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here in the States, "You have a call" means the call is for you.
I left camp behind years ago... when I was fired.<eos> What did you expect would happen?<eos> You went rogue.<eos> The menu would say grilled cheese and you'd make a taco.<eos> Or the menu would say hamburgers and you'd make a taco.<eos> Or the menu would say chicken soup and you'd make...<eos> Tacos!<eos> I know what I did!<eos> And don't give me your holier-than-thou crap.<eos> Beth cared about you even after you became a can, and how did you repay her?
After the incident, I spent years in physical therapy, just learning how to walk.<eos> I still can't type.<eos> Don't you dare judge me.<eos> And don't you dare judge me!<eos> Gene, I didn't come here to fight you.<eos> Well, then I guess you came to the wrong Winnebago!<eos> Get a goddamn hold of yourself, Gene!<eos> I don't want you here, Mitch!<eos> Whatever it is you came for...<eos> I have nothing for you.
Um, and if you do... Iâ€™m going to have to seriously reconsider this relationship.<eos> Okay?<eos> Come on, Andy!<eos> Come in here.<eos> I have to show you something.<eos> You've gotta see this knife that Renata bought.<eos> It looks like it was made for gutting deer.<eos> This is her bag.<eos> I donâ€™t like the idea of rifling through someone else's stuff.<eos> Claire, I need you.
- Seven.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Each of you must make up a song about... dinosaurs!<eos> Okay!<eos> Go!<eos> - ♪ Brontosaurus ♪ - ♪ Where did you go ♪<eos> - ♪ Stegosaurus ♪ - ♪ My friends, dinosaurs ♪<eos> ♪ Don't forget the pterodactyl ♪<eos> ♪ Why did you leave me On the verge of extinction ♪<eos> - ♪ Everybody's doinâ€™ the Dinosaur Stomp ♪ - ♪ I shed a tear for you ♪
I was just about to come and find you.<eos> I've just had the most amazing news.<eos> Billy Baldwin has dropped out of The Neptune Effect.<eos> - They want me to jump in!<eos> - What?<eos> $35 million budget.<eos> Top-line talent.<eos> It's going to win technical awards for sure.<eos> Yeah, my people think this could put me into the next tier.<eos> - Wow! Iâ€™m so happy for you.
- Will you accept my apology?<eos> - Of course I will, yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Come here, you.<eos> - I have a secret to tell you.<eos> - What's that?<eos> You were right about me.<eos> You fell right into my trap.<eos> I made you look insane.<eos> And now, no matter what I do, no one will believe you.
[Beth] Point, Deegs! -Go! -[Seth] Let's go!<eos> [boy] Come on, Andy!<eos> Um, I'm gonna run back to the cabin to grab my sunblock.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -So... Oh.<eos> Listen, Ginny, I heard you, and I totally respect what you had to say.<eos> -Thanks, Coop. -Boop.<eos> I was wondering if we could talk. Oh! Um... [grunts]<eos> See, Ginny feels really weird about us, and I'm not supposed to talk to you.<eos> -I'm sure you can understand.
What does it look like, Gary?<eos> You blind?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Some of these 16-year-old JCs look like they're 21, and I'm 22, so that is a one-year difference.<eos> -But they're not 21.<eos> They're 16.<eos> -Yeah, exactly!<eos> Um, has anyone seen Coop or Ginny?<eos> "Um, has anyone seen Coop or Ginny?" God, you're such a blowhard!<eos> Wow. Who died and made you mayor of King Shit Mountain?
-No, no, but it's like stuff comes out.<eos> Stop!<eos> This whole act is getting a little pathetic, dude.<eos> I'm not lying, man.<eos> I'm like you guys now.<eos> Hey, yeah, sure, man.<eos> You'll do it one day.<eos> I did do it!<eos> Why isn't anybody happy for me?<eos> I'm happy for you, kid.
Well?<eos> -Well, what?<eos> -Let me see it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Look at that thing!<eos> Looks like a train ran over it.<eos> Well done!<eos> Thank you, Abby.<eos> That means so much, coming from you.
Sorry about Ginny.<eos> What a bummer.<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> You know, I've been thinking about what you said at the barn before.<eos> Maybe we should... give it a chance, you and me.<eos> Oh, Coop, maybe we just got caught up in all that camp nostalgia.<eos> But you should be with Ginny.<eos> Yeah, but that's... See, that's not an option anymore.<eos> So I'm saying that's why it should be you and me.<eos> I understand, and you know that I care about you so much.
Hi, over here. Yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> I prefer to be non-violent normally, but I should tell you I have been trained in Krav Maga.<eos> Okay, well, I'm just gonna touch your pressure point right here.<eos> Fucked you up. I fucked you up.<eos> Time's up, Camp Firehose.<eos> I think I hear my ride.<eos> George, please don't do this!<eos> It's not too late!<eos> Too late for you, Willie-Shits-His-Pants!
-What happens now?<eos> The missile needs to fly into orbit, turn around in space, reenter the atmosphere, and then it will destroy us all, so...<eos> -So how long do we have?<eos> -Five minutes.<eos> Oh, we're all gonna die!<eos> And all the campers, too, and they don't even know it.<eos> Donna, Yaron...<eos> I'm sorry I'll never get to see our kid get his or her GED.<eos> Hey.<eos> Before the missile hits, I'm really sorry I never told you my true feelings.
Second chances.<eos> - That's great.<eos> I'm gonna take off.<eos> See you.<eos> Some of us are breaking the glass ceiling.<eos> The fall color is a hit.<eos> I've been promoted to senior VP!<eos> Some of us are finding--<eos> Some of us made tons of money.<eos> Beth, I'm talking about you.
I don't have one.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm bad with gadgets.<eos> You liar.<eos> No. It's true.<eos> I never even use a computer.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Won't you?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll try harder for you.
Okay.<eos> This is delicious.<eos> SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE REMEMBERING!<eos> Did you see this, Michi?<eos> I saw it a while ago, Nanaka.<eos> You saw that I saw it, right?<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> The stuff after that.<eos> It really ticks me off.<eos> This guy writes mean stuff about you by name.
Okay, I'll be going.<eos> See you later.<eos> Shin.<eos> Yes?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> See you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> You're up early, Hitomi.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll make you some tea.
Yes?<eos> I liked this woman quite a lot.<eos> I see.<eos> A true genius doesn't go by the norms at first.<eos> I see.<eos> To be honest, I've been thinking that I'll stop writing for your company.<eos> What?<eos> You can't do that!<eos> I sure hope it sells.<eos> Michi, can I join you?
Even on the final page of the novel, we never learn the names of the characters.<eos> However... what has stayed with each and every one of us that read it is an undeniable emotion.<eos> Though I myself am an author, I can't explain it well.<eos> In all likelihood, this is a new emotion.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I would like to express my congratulations on winning this prize.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell us your honest feelings about being...<eos> Shin!<eos> I'm so happy for you.
All right!<eos> Bartender!<eos> Two more tequilas.<eos> What?<eos> Michi, are you all right?<eos> Sorry. I'm really sorry.<eos> Here. Wipe your mouth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You haven't wiped your mouth at all.<eos> Oh, you!
Are you dating Nanaka?<eos> What?<eos> Hitomi, she would never fall for this loser.<eos> She got all kinds of hot guys hitting on her.<eos> Thank you for your time today.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I was asked to come.<eos> Are you interested in yoga, Shin?<eos> No.<eos> I was wondering if I stared at you long enough, would I fall in love with you?
Why do you send those nasty faxes?<eos> Because it's just not fair.<eos> He goes and kills people because he wants to.<eos> Then he gets to be killed himself.<eos> The dead person ends up with nothing.<eos> To the living, all that's left<eos> are regrets and remorse.<eos> Nothing will ever happen again in my son's life.<eos> But the murderer's son is a successful author, and it's thanks to him.<eos> How convenient for you!
Thank you.<eos> It has been a while.<eos> I'm Sunako.<eos> I served Minami Shirakawa.<eos> I have Minami's will, which is meant for you.<eos> Her will?<eos> WATER IN THE ASHTRAY, THE MOURNFUL TALE, ABOVE THE BLUE SKY<eos> DRIFTING EMOTIONS<eos> Dad, is this really how things were meant to be?<eos> Keisuke, thanks to you, I was able to enjoy the last six months.
If she had died, your novels would have sold even more.<eos> You did it to make my novels sell?<eos> You had Nanaka and Minami killed for that?<eos> Mr. Michima... it seems that you actually have talent as a novelist.<eos> I never imagined you would win an award.<eos> Come to think of it, you don't know about... Hitomi Tsukamoto's true identity.<eos> What?<eos> She's the only daughter of the famous novelist Hibiki Ogie.<eos> She's been a fan of yours since your debut.<eos> So, it was easy to get her to do things for you.
She's the only daughter of the famous novelist Hibiki Ogie.<eos> She's been a fan of yours since your debut.<eos> So, it was easy to get her to do things for you.<eos> I wonder why something so interesting doesn't sell.<eos> Maybe if it got a lucky break, it would sell.<eos> Like if it caught the eye of a prominent person.<eos> Even simpler, if it won an award, or something.<eos> It's a good thing she's such a simple girl.<eos> Right away, she used her contacts and promoted it to the panel of judges.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
I could sense that quite intensely as I read.<eos> When I researched you, I found out your father was on death row.<eos> It made me laugh.<eos> I had found the perfect plaything.<eos> My heart danced with joy for the first time in a long time.<eos> In six months, I would change an unpopular novelist who feared death into a best-selling novelist who desired to commit murder.<eos> Don't you think that sounds like an interesting game?<eos> Is that why you sent those invitations to them?<eos> You need friends if you want to play.<eos> I selected women appropriate for you, and had them come to your home.
Yuki Kobayashi.<eos> You and I are going to the police now.<eos> Yuki Kobayashi.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Mr. Michima, it appears you do not understand this, but if you have money and reliable contacts, there's almost nothing you can't do.<eos> The police can arrest me.<eos> I wonder why your father's execution happened when it did, don't you?<eos> You did that too?<eos> Who knows?<eos> I got this for you.
You're going to inherit that, right?<eos> Minami told me everything in the letter that came with her will.<eos> This is what she wrote in her letter.<eos> "Escape and live.<eos> I can't defeat that woman.<eos> Unfortunately, she's just too powerful for me."<eos> I don't want to do what she told me.<eos> It's foolish.<eos> In the end, I'm sure that Minami never had a look like this on her face.<eos> All those other people were prepared to die unlike you.
Really?<eos> Lately, I like reading books.<eos> Maybe I'll read it, too.<eos> I am so looking forward to his next one.<eos> I am, too.<eos> DRIFTING EMOTIONS Shin Michima<eos> Who are you?<eos> I want to write for this person who's waiting for it.<eos> I hope this one sells.<eos> I was wondering if I stared at you long enough, would I fall in love with you?
I am so looking forward to his next one.<eos> I am, too.<eos> DRIFTING EMOTIONS Shin Michima<eos> Who are you?<eos> I want to write for this person who's waiting for it.<eos> I hope this one sells.<eos> I was wondering if I stared at you long enough, would I fall in love with you?<eos> It hurts, Hitomi.<eos> If only we had left together...<eos> I'll make you some tea.
Mr. Sakurai.<eos> I'm not allowed to have a pet here.<eos> I'll negotiate with the owner.<eos> Hitomi, in the invitation, it said someone might lose their life, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then, why did you come?<eos> For protection.<eos> Protection?<eos> Of who?<eos> You, of course.
You, of course.<eos> Me?<eos> You thought my life was in danger?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Every day, I acted like I was doing yoga so I could guard you.<eos> Is that right?<eos> But why protect me?<eos> At first, because I was your fan.<eos> But... then I fell in love with you.
Please.<eos> Shin Michima,<eos> there is no reason or logic for why I love you.<eos> Is that wrong?<eos> No, but, just leave me alone.<eos> I'm sick of it all.<eos> Finding something that I love and then losing it,<eos> I don't want it to happen again.<eos> Give me a chance.<eos> Just let me be near you.
Last one.<eos> Card.<eos> I should probably get home.<eos> Oh, and Sam, I refolded all of your socks in a totally better way.<eos> Bye, Paige.<eos> Sam, that... that's weird.<eos> Hey, Dad, did Mom used to touch all of your stuff?<eos> How did you get her to stop?<eos> I don't think I ever did.<eos> Oh, my gosh. Look at you.
Okay. That's okay. I'm gonna text him.<eos> Thank you for trying, Beth.<eos> Seriously? I knew you were nervous, but picking up a phone call during an interview, and now you're texting.<eos> Are you trying to blow this?<eos> My brother's autistic.<eos> Well, I'm a dick.<eos> No, that's okay. You didn't know.<eos> I just have to answer my phone in case he's freaking out or he disappeared, which is what happened right now.<eos> It's kind of my job as his sister.<eos> That must be hard for you.
And he's so cute.<eos> And have you seen his notebook thing?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> The way his brain works is so interesting.<eos> Interesting?<eos> My brother's not a science experiment.<eos> No, I know that.<eos> What happens when he relies on you, then you leave?<eos> I'm not gonna...<eos> 'Cause then he'll need you.
I was just trying to help.<eos> I'm not always gonna be around to stick up for you.<eos> Good.<eos> Sam...<eos> No, you're just like Paige.<eos> But instead of touching my books and my turtle, you're touching my girlfriend.<eos> I'm glad you're going to that new school, because you will not be around to bother me.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I don't need you.
No, I'm not ashamed.<eos> Elsa, I'm not ashamed of anything.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just like to keep my work life and my personal life separate. I'm not ashamed.<eos> Mm-hmm. It's just how I am.<eos> It's a guy thing.<eos> Yeah, I just could never be that way, not with someone I work with every day, someone I'm friends with.<eos> It's a huge part of my identity.<eos> Yeah, but maybe it shouldn't be.<eos> What? Everything with you revolves around being a mom.
You want play catch?<eos> I send you to Iran.<eos> You can play catch with Khomeini and Saddam Hussein."<eos> I guess we're not playing catch.<eos> The things people will say.<eos> People say, "My dad never said, 'I love you.'"<eos> I tell them, "My dad, Iranian dad...<eos> Immigrant dads don't even know what that means."<eos> If I went to my dad... "Dad, do you love me?"<eos> I am growing used to you."
In the morning, "I love you."<eos> Lunchtime, "I still love you."<eos> Afternoon, "I loved you more than lunch and breakfast.<eos> I love you even more now."<eos> Even when they get in trouble, you gotta tell them you love them.<eos> My son gets in trouble... "You're in big trouble.<eos> You did not clean your room!<eos> But just know that I love you.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> I will always be here for you.
The kids gotta unwind and rewind and wound down.<eos> I know, we were just about to have an orgy, but we gotta go home.<eos> The kids gotta unwind, rewind and wound down."<eos> My parents did not leave one party for us to go home and unwind and rewind and wound down.<eos> Not one.<eos> If we got tired at a party, they'd be like, "You want to sleep?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go find a pile of coats.<eos> Fall asleep on the coats.<eos> Make sure one of the coats is my coat so I don't forget you when I'm going home."
Now that I know I want Julia to be my girlfriend someday, I've decided to look nice whenever I see her.<eos> That kind of thing is important to girls, but looking nice is hard.<eos> Yeah. Look at you.
Coxcomb.<eos> That's a funny word.<eos> As far as birds go, chickens aren't as cool as penguins, but they have some interesting habits.<eos> In a natural setting, a rooster will entice hens into mating by spreading his feathers and performing a demonstrative dance.<eos> Jeez!<eos> Don't sneak up. You made me overzest.<eos> Why so jumpy?<eos> I know. I couldn't help myself.<eos> These lemon squares look delicious.<eos> They're not for you.
Well, we have been snowshoeing a couple times.<eos> "We"?<eos> As in you and your mom.<eos> Me and my boyfriend.<eos> Snowshoeing was his idea.<eos> I hate the cold.<eos> You have a boyfriend?<eos> Mm-hmm. Miles.<eos> Anyway, it's great that you're showing so much interest in others. We've been working on that.<eos> But how about we get back to you?
Sure. Of course, honey.<eos> We've been getting along lately.<eos> It's what you wanted, right?<eos> Yeah. It's great.<eos> It's really good. Really good.<eos> Um... so I should just...<eos> Go to the bar and get your credit card.<eos> Okay? And, by the time you get back, we'll either be better, or we'll really need your help.<eos> Call if you need me.<eos> Nobody needs you, Mom.
But then they kept laughing harder and then Bailey Bennet...<eos> Well, I am all there. I am!<eos> I know you are.<eos> Some kids are just assholes, Sam.<eos> That's just the way it is.<eos> But even the assholes get girlfriends.<eos> It's easy for everybody, but not me.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Trust me. It's hard for everybody.<eos> Not you. You stole Mom from the boy with the Jeep.
But I need her as my therapist.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Then you should start dating someone your own age.<eos> Like a practice girlfriend before I date Julia?<eos> No. I wouldn't call it that.<eos> When Roald Amundsen first explored Antarctica, he took several practice journeys over easier terrain.<eos> It's the logical thing to do.<eos> And when I get enough experience with other girls, then I can date Julia and she can stop being my therapist.<eos> Or you could find a girl your own age.<eos> That's your sweet spot. Plus, those are the girls that are gonna like you, too.
Do as I say.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> Eyes down.<eos> Nazareth.<eos> Right where we left it.<eos> Mother, are we almost there?<eos> Yes, it's just ahead.<eos> Jews!<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Look at you.
My lords!<eos> Quiet!<eos> An old lady speaks.<eos> My lords!<eos> I would bow, my lords, but I'm too old for that.<eos> And you are young men.<eos> I offer you sweetcakes and the best wine from the vineyards of our kindred.<eos> You'd feed an army that's crucifying your own people?<eos> I'd offer you ambrosia from the gods of Mount Olympus and conjure up dancing girls and woodland nymphs if you would spare these children of my father's house.<eos> If you tell me these men are not bandits and thieves, I'll believe you.
It's very good wine.<eos> For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it with you.<eos> It's a hard thing you have to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> We leave this village as it is.<eos> I thank you, grandmother.<eos> The Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.
For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it with you.<eos> It's a hard thing you have to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> We leave this village as it is.<eos> I thank you, grandmother.<eos> The Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.<eos> The Lord lift up his countenance upon you!
We were establishing order.<eos> It's a bloody business,<eos> - establishing order.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> And what of this family?<eos> Did you establish order?<eos> They appeared innocent.<eos> We left them untouched.<eos> Was that before or after they gave you the wine?<eos> Your own men won't even lie for you.
What have I done?<eos> Who is this child?<eos> Tell me, who is he?<eos> I asked Father about going to Jerusalem for Passover, too.<eos> Then you ask, and suddenly we all go.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> There's plenty you don't know.<eos> You're the only one who really matters.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Everybody loves you.
- Where?<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> The boy, he's here.<eos> He's yours.<eos> By the blind rabbi.<eos> Look.<eos> Go!<eos> Thank you, Rabbi.<eos> I'll remember you.
God is your father.<eos> But we're all children of God.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> But you...<eos> You are begotten of God.<eos> That is why you can make dead birds fly, the sick well, the blind see,<eos> and why you were able to make Eleazer live again.<eos> He's made you a child to grow in wisdom as well as in all other things.<eos> Keep your power inside you, until your father in heaven shows you the time to use it.
It's a practice jump.<eos> You don't need paperwork for a practice jump.<eos> At Oberstdorf we do everything to the letter.<eos> - I could've done two jumps by now.<eos> - Relax.<eos> Focused, not tense, remember?<eos> Focused, not tense.<eos> I did it. 61 meters.<eos> Without a headwind or breakfast.<eos> Do that tomorrow, you're in, they can't get rid of you.
Let's go.<eos> You gotta put that crash behind you, Eddie.<eos> And remember that practice... I want you to know that was the best jump you've ever done, by a mile.<eos> Everything was working, man, everything.<eos> It was...<eos> Your take-off, your timing, your balance... your trajectory all working together.<eos> It was like second nature.<eos> It was...<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> I was really proud of you, man.
Good.<eos> Get the van back sharpish, and I don't ever wanna hear about ski-jumps again.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Don't worry about him, love.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you, too, Mum.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Eddie, this came for you.
Okay? I'm begging you.<eos> Do it right or don't do it at all.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> This time a year ago you were plowing snow.<eos> And you were landing on your head.<eos> Look at the progress we've made.<eos> Exactly!<eos> This is my moment!<eos> Don't make this your moment, please!<eos> They'll make you a fool.
Simple.<eos> Eddie, listen.<eos> You got more dedication, more heart and spirit than any jumpers out there.<eos> Any of them.<eos> Jesus, I spent six months trying to get rid of you, dude.<eos> You're like gum on my shoe, you never gave up.<eos> I mean, are you gonna give up now, at the Olympics?<eos> This is your moment.<eos> You're Eddie "The Eagle," man.<eos> Proud of you.
Edwards!<eos> I'm Edwards.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Eddie "The Eagle." Eddie "The Eagle."<eos> For you.
It was unbelievable.<eos> - I have never gone that far before.<eos> To see 71 meters it was like...<eos> Is that a good book?<eos> Instructive?<eos> Very.<eos> May I?<eos> You... brilliant.<eos> Well done.<eos> I was wrong... about you.
- Yeah. Well, I think I can match that.<eos> "Now the real work begins.<eos> WS." Warren Sharp.<eos> So how about it?<eos> Here's to the next four years.<eos> God, that's good.<eos> Hello, Mum.<eos> Hello. Where do you think you've been, young man?<eos> Competing in the Olympics, Mum.<eos> I'm so proud of you, son.

Just hung 'em.<eos> Yeah, I got a leave.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> A good mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.<eos> "If I go up to the heavens, you are there.<eos> If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.<eos> Even in the darkness, will not be dark to you.
Yeah, I got a leave.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> A good mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.<eos> "If I go up to the heavens, you are there.<eos> If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.<eos> Even in the darkness, will not be dark to you.<eos> The night will shine like day, the darkness is as light to you.
That stuff don't belong to you.<eos> Unhitch that wagon and head off down the road.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The free men of Jones county?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna concern myself with five or six deserters hiding out in the swamp who don't have the courage to show their face.<eos> Sir-- you've got a quota to meet.<eos> You're dismissed.<eos> What do you say, sumrall?<eos> Well, there will be no more dry firing' for you.
Yeah, so do I.<eos> Thomas, I don't think that, uh, turning' ourselves in is gonna stop 'em.<eos> I know you lost your farm, and I--<eos> I know your mama's hurtin'.<eos> All right? But that does not make these men your friends.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Right here. Look out there.<eos> That's your friend.<eos> Evenin', Jesse.<eos> I brought you some biscuits.
Yes, sir.<eos> I'll do as you say, sir.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Forget the trip to the beach.<eos> We got a job.<eos> No detail yet.<eos> Boss told me to get Mazaru immediately.<eos> Why does it have to be today? .<eos> I have an important job for you.
They're our friends, aren't they? .<eos> They used to be, but no more.<eos> You're a tough one, huh, Sirin? .<eos> Kill them.<eos> You think you can kill me that easily? .<eos> I think you're injured, Lieutenant.<eos> How do you know me? .<eos> I just know.<eos> Why did you follow me here? .<eos> I followed Claire, not you, Lieutenant.
Go!<eos> Go away now!<eos> CLAlREe You guys are too late.<eos> Leave it.<eos> Go away.<eos> Before it's going to work.<eos> Now!<eos> Now.<eos> Don't even try.<eos> I'm just going to say hello to you in hell.
It's... it's in...<eos> in my Rolodex.<eos> Can I go to my desk, please?<eos> Here.<eos> When does the next shipment go out?<eos> Two weeks.<eos> What are they using them for?<eos> W-we don't ask those questions.<eos> We just breed the bugs they tell us.<eos> You should have asked.
Previously on "The Americans"...<eos> You missed the meeting.
I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you know how to set the tension?<eos> Tense, loose.<eos> Loose.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I, uh, usually ride a... a regular bike, but I'm in...<eos> I'm in a town...<eos> In town on business.<eos> Huh. I'm sor... Uh, are you a local?
In town on business.<eos> Huh. I'm sor... Uh, are you a local?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Okay, well I...<eos> One... One... One more.<eos> Um, ah, I'm gonna be coming back a bunch, and I-I know nothing about, um, Topeka.<eos> What... what should I do, like, when I'm...<eos> When I'm not working?<eos> I spend time with my family.<eos> Oh, you have kids?
When I'm not working?<eos> I spend time with my family.<eos> Oh, you have kids?<eos> No. My sister's family.<eos> Nieces and nephews?<eos> Nice.<eos> Yeah, I have, uh...<eos> I have three nephews.<eos> Love 'em to death, but I'm always happy to leave.<eos> But you must do something besides see them.
Sorry, I only have a few minutes.<eos> Uh, that's all I need.<eos> You remember three years ago when that KGB officer was killed...<eos> Vladimir Kosygin?<eos> He was kidnapped by a group of FBI agents and then shot in cold blood.<eos> For now, it doesn't really matter who took Kosygin or why.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Once.<eos> In the back of the head.<eos> You killed him?
Previously on The Americans...<eos> That's my son.<eos> Our son.<eos> _<eos> You missed the meeting.
Sorry to bother you, Ms. Kovalenko.<eos> We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> Which one's yours?<eos> In the blue jacket.<eos> That's a cute kid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Might be a lot of opportunities for him in America one day.<eos> It's something we can talk about, if you're interested.<eos> Talking to you is not safe.<eos> You're not being watched.

She's 62.<eos> Mary Kay cosmetics and good genes are the key to my vibrant skin.<eos> I like to say Mary Kay can't change your genes-- not that you gals need any help in that department-- but our rich, creamy foundation will seal in moisture and keep your skin silky, smooth, and sassy.<eos> I'm sorry, but now is not such a good time.<eos> Well, here's a sample of a skin-care product I've been using for almost 15 years.<eos> "Day Radiance."<eos> If you take care of your skin, dear, your skin will take care of you.<eos> - Thank you, but like I said-- - I understand.<eos> I could come back another time and host an in-home beauty demonstration for you and some of your friends.<eos> You get to keep a ton of samples, and the makeover is free.
That's very frightening.<eos> Yes, I'm very lucky, and I know that.<eos> I-I have been taking these... karate classes.<eos> Do you think that's stupid?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> want to feel... like I did before.<eos> Like nothing happened.<eos> Something big happened.<eos> You went through a trauma.
I don't know anything.<eos> My own parents, I don't know anything about them at all.<eos> You need a hand?<eos> No, it's all under control.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> I can't tell you, Paige, how much I've been looking forward to this day.<eos> I have heard so much about you for so long.<eos> Where did you meet my parents?<eos> Here, in Washington, a long time ago.<eos> Are you a-a spy?
My son become man in Soviet Union.<eos> What will he do?<eos> Well, he can make something of his life here.<eos> But a boy needs his mother to become man.<eos> And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.<eos> What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.<eos> Just pieces of information that you pick up.

It's possible.<eos> "Possible" is word American use when they don't want make promise.<eos> We can't promise asylum.<eos> And you're right, there are risks, big risks.
She wants to take me skydiving.<eos> Do you want to go?<eos> Well, I'm trying not to die before Matthew graduates from college.<eos> Just give me, like, five more minutes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You want another?<eos> - No.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> I'll gain weight and get fired.<eos> If everybody need to look skinny like you for job, nobody have job.
She understands "work."<eos> There was a man back there.<eos> He was one of ours.<eos> We have people watching to make sure you haven't been followed.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Try not to look over your shoulder.<eos> You don't want to draw attention.<eos> Was I doing that?<eos> I was just checking...<eos> You just shouldn't look worried.
We'll put two fifty of that into a college trust fund for your son.<eos> And, if things go well, we'll give you more.<eos> And I can save half for college, half for house.<eos> Well, saving for a house will take a very long time.<eos> But I won't use that money for nothing other than those things.<eos> Just son and house.<eos> So, how are things going at work?<eos> Fine.<eos> Usual.<eos> You get along with your coworkers?
Mm. Just lunch.<eos> Do they ever ask you where you went for lunch?<eos> Uh, I guess.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I mean... nobody cares though.<eos> Everybody go out to lunch sometimes.<eos> You need to be able to tell them where you ate, what you ate, who you ate with, and why you picked that place to eat.<eos> But... nobody ask me all of that.<eos> You have to be prepared if they do ask.<eos> You don't want to appear nervous.
Okay.<eos> I'll see him then.<eos> One of Gabriel's people.<eos> Thursday.<eos> Stan.<eos> It's not absolutely conclusive yet, but they just translated an intercept from Thailand showing travel for a group of known KGB officers coming in and out of the country at the same time Gaad was murdered.<eos> There was nothing else going on in Thailand to tie those guys to.<eos> I know how you feel about squeezing Burov, but it might take years for us to get somebody like that inside the KGB again.<eos> I could be next on their list.<eos> Or you.
Tuan?<eos> Uh, just a sandwich.<eos> Um, roast beef, lettuce, onion, mustard, on a roll.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Evgheniya.<eos> It's Dee.<eos> Sorry to call you so late.<eos> Are you okay?
Sometimes I hear things-- exactly the things I was asked to tell you about.<eos> I don't know if they're urgent.<eos> I used to just tell Gabriel, and...<eos> Well, he always said it was very important for him that we talk them through.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't meet with you on a regular basis.<eos> I understand.<eos> I will pray for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You should try it.
I, uh...<eos> I guess we're not the best at that.<eos> Now that he was retired, I thought maybe...<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> How are things there?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, he was a great boss.<eos> I mean, I'm not the easiest guy to be the boss of.<eos> Did you just come to visit?
Now that he was retired, I thought maybe...<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> How are things there?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, he was a great boss.<eos> I mean, I'm not the easiest guy to be the boss of.<eos> Did you just come to visit?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm sure that, over the years, he's told you some things that you couldn't repeat.
Did you see him?<eos> With his big black eye?<eos> When this is all over, I gotta teach that kid how to fight.<eos> If my son came home like that, I'd do something.<eos> But Evgheniya...<eos> Alexei's not going to take him back home and Evgheniya can't change his mind.<eos> And it doesn't look like she's going back without her husband.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to rethink this.<eos> You have kids?
Wouldn't want you getting lost again.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's great.<eos> You've meant a lot to our family...<eos> It's been quite a road.<eos> Um, before you go...<eos> I'm not leaving just yet.<eos> I know.<eos> Um... but we wanted to get your advice on a family thing.<eos> Do you think that... we could ever take Paige and Henry... back... home?
I'm not leaving just yet.<eos> I know.<eos> Um... but we wanted to get your advice on a family thing.<eos> Do you think that... we could ever take Paige and Henry... back... home?<eos> To...<eos> To live.<eos> Is this something you want to do?<eos> We're thinking about it.<eos> We don't know if... they would ever really adjust to life there...<eos> But with the situation here, and everything... most of which you know about, and, really, everything that goes along with it... um, it's not much better either...
Well, good.<eos> - Sounds great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But you know, you have to be careful with him too.<eos> I know.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Not one sound.<eos> I don't have much money.<eos> You can have what there is.
What do you want?<eos> The truth.<eos> About what?<eos> Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk.<eos> - Who...?<eos> - You tell us.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I don't know who this person is.<eos> She's you.
Sevsk.<eos> You're lying.<eos> About what?<eos> Everything.<eos> I don't understand...<eos> Your life is a lie.<eos> Why are you saying such things?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, who you're talking about...<eos> Who are you?<eos> You were born in Dyatkovo.
Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome.<eos> He's cute.<eos> What the hell was Wyatt thinking?<eos> - I get you're upset... - Upset doesn't touch how pissed I am.<eos> I'm fielding calls from the President, for God's sake.<eos> And Rufus was a hostage?<eos> My ass.<eos> He was in on it, and so were you, by the way.
I put a car on your house for your protection, you're welcome.<eos> This is about Wyatt's wife, isn't it?<eos> I knew he was fixated on her murder, but this is just so reckless.<eos> Can you blame him?<eos> I mean how is he supposed to let Jessica go when, thanks to you, everyday, he has to come to work and stare at a damn machine that can go back in time and bring his wife back to life?<eos> I thought we were a team...<eos> he should've just come to me.<eos> Oh, the way that I came to you about Amy?<eos> You and I had a deal.<eos> While I chased Flynn through time, you would be working on getting me my sister back, and how is that going so far?
I thought we were a team...<eos> he should've just come to me.<eos> Oh, the way that I came to you about Amy?<eos> You and I had a deal.<eos> While I chased Flynn through time, you would be working on getting me my sister back, and how is that going so far?<eos> - It is not that simple.<eos> - You have done nothing!<eos> I am not surprised that Wyatt stole the Lifeboat behind your back...<eos> I am shocked that he didn't do it sooner.<eos> I would steal it myself if I thought it would bring Amy back. And you would do the same for your family.
This is Lucy Preston.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Rufus took out the Lifeboat, didn't he?<eos> That's got to be the only reason he's not picking up his half dozen devices.<eos> Why would Rufus want to talk to you after everything that you've done to help Flynn?<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> So you and me... we'll have to speak, instead. Face to face.<eos> There's a park, 16th and Mariposa.<eos> Downtown, one hour. What? So you're here?<eos> You're... you're in San Francisco?
- Becky.<eos> - So, crazy being stuck here.<eos> Makes you wonder what we're gonna do... to pass time.<eos> You could play Galaga.<eos> That's one idea.<eos> Um, I'm gonna go put on some music.<eos> Dude. Go talk to her.<eos> Oh, um... she kind of scares me.<eos> I mean, it's the whole Olivia Newton-John of it all.<eos> Anyways, I'd rather just stay and hang with you. 'Cause you're super cool.
Jeez.<eos> Stop!<eos> Rufus is gone.<eos> So I guess I got to trust you.<eos> I wish I could say the same.<eos> I know what my family must think of me.<eos> I'm sure Homeland Security's questioned them.<eos> They probably think I'm a monster.<eos> Anthony... either you trust me or you don't.<eos> I... I get that you and Flynn are trying to wipe out Rittenhouse...
Change what?<eos> - Change history?<eos> - Go back. In the Mothership. Attack key moments in time, til they get what they want, a reality in their image.<eos> Shiny, happy, brave New World.<eos> Sterile, clean... and totally under their thumb. Are you telling me that...<eos> Rittenhouse wants to take the Mothership back so they can nuke history even more than Flynn?<eos> Sister... you ain't seen nothing yet.<eos> Flynn's the only thing standing in their way. But it's not enough.<eos> I can't risk them getting the Mothership. So I'm gonna destroy it.<eos> And I hope to God you and Rufus... will blow up yours, too.
Hey, man, I'm sorry. For everything.<eos> - Tough guy.<eos> - You need to go.<eos> The girl's mine. I saw her first.<eos> You're not listening to me, man... get out of here.<eos> Oh, I'm hearing your signal now. Loud and clear.<eos> Knock it off, right now!<eos> - Whoa. - Hold on.<eos> Now you, stand over there.<eos> You okay?
- No, he's got a gun!<eos> - Joel!<eos> - He's got a gun! - He's got a gun!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> Stop it, stop it, stop it.<eos> It's okay. Don't worry.<eos> It's just... it's important to me that you guys aren't together.<eos> Okay, listen, listen, I'm sorry. You seemed like a really nice guy, you did.<eos> - It's not you, I just... - What?
- No, no, no, please don't go!<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Please don't go!<eos> I can't take that chance.<eos> Go. Please!<eos> Please don't kill me.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you, we're just going for a drive.<eos> Stop fighting me. Please.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> You all right?
- Did they have a nice chat?<eos> - Sorry, Mr. Mason.<eos> - National security and all that.<eos> - Yes, well, obviously.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> What did Bruhl have to say to her?<eos> I'm not playing games with you today, I'm not in the mood.<eos> Oh, what's the matter? Your boss is miffed you lost the time machine?<eos> You should talk.<eos> You've lost two of them.
Come in.<eos> Look, I know exactly who you are, and I know you know exactly who I am, and it's probably a huge mistake coming over here, but I thought that maybe even you wouldn't hurt your own daughter.<eos> And I just wanted to tell you face to face... that I know.<eos> You've got this all wrong, Lucy.<eos> I'm glad you know about Rittenhouse, I'm glad you're here.<eos> It's a relief, honestly.<eos> A relief?<eos> Having to watch you from afar, never being able to speak to... to my own daughter.<eos> It's been... hasn't been easy.<eos> And you... you're smart, you're beautiful, you're incredib... I could care less what you think about me.

I had two very close friends.<eos> My parents invite me to go see a film.<eos> I said, "Of course I'll go see that movie with you", because you love me.<eos> "Why on earth would you want to see me suffer?"<eos> And then I sat through Steven Spielberg's War Horse, which, if you haven't seen, as far as I'm concerned, is a 14-hour, real-time documentary about a gentle horse struggling in vain to escape from barbed wire.<eos> This may be your war horse.<eos> If that's the case, do as I did.<eos> Take a lap outside.<eos> Get yourself a treat.<eos> There's probably a CVS or a Rite Aid selling ice cream... nearby because you're a good friend.
Apologies, apologies.<eos> Okay, this is the scariest part of the show.<eos> I'm trying to believe in something, and, uh... I can't, there's something more, more bigger than myself, and I just, I just can't, I can't think of anything.<eos> And, um...<eos> But then I remember there's this game that we used to play when we were kids, and it's called One Big Blob.<eos> What happens: I'm it, you run away from me, frightened, afraid.<eos> I begin running after you, while chanting, one big blob!<eos> One big blob!<eos> One big blob!<eos> Eventually I end up catching one of you, and it's gonna be you.
I'm gonna wait!<eos> One big blob!<eos> I don't want to do it, either.<eos> One big blob!<eos> One big blob!<eos> One big blob!<eos> One big blob!<eos> I know it's weird.<eos> One big blob!<eos> You can do it!
Probably not what she's here for.<eos> How do you know our daughter?<eos> I don't.<eos> She hired me for a cleaning job. - Oh.<eos> - What? Wow. Right on time.<eos> Wait, Lily, did you hire a cleaning lady?<eos> Yeah, with an app on your phone.<eos> Daddy said my room was a pig sty.<eos> Okay, we'll double back to that unnecessary and inaccurate slam on pigs, and I think daddy meant for you to clean your room.<eos> We can't have you cleaning our daughter's room. It just... it sends the wrong message.
I've been compromised.<eos> Okay, g-get in the house.<eos> Ooh! Bad idea!<eos> Ow! I was gonna take you to a farm!<eos> I may have to change the name of this side dish to "potatoes au great-in."<eos> I'm not hearing a difference.<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, this is... unique.<eos> Yes, thank you very much.<eos> You know how on your show you were always taking chances and trusting your instincts?
That's the wrong one.<eos> I gotta say, Gavin... when that storeroom door opened, and I saw your face grinning down at me,<eos> When we get home, I'm going to do everything in my power to get you back in the good graces of the Hooli board.<eos> I can use a fellow of your talents, sir.<eos> That's very gracious of you, Jack.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome aboard, gentlemen.<eos> Our flying time to Mountain View is 11 hours and 36 minutes, and we will be stopping off in Jackson Hole first. Oh.<eos> Stopping off at Jackson Hole, are you, Gavin?<eos> No, Jack. You are.
- What's more important than a life?<eos> You talk like life means something.<eos> If it doesn't, then what's the point?<eos> This is what magic is for.<eos> Boldly spoken for a student who lacked the balls to control a flea.<eos> Look, I survived your abuse, and I got off my ass, and I went into the goddamn world.<eos> What have you done?<eos> You... you've sat around and drank.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - No, fuck you.
Do I see fifty-five?<eos> Fifty-five, I see fifty-five.<eos> Do I see sixty?<eos> You madam, can we see sixty?<eos> Is that seventy, sir or...<eos> Wonderful hair. 70!<eos> Thank you very well!<eos> Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs.<eos> Yes, I believe the last time you and I saw each other we were both bidding on the Malevich.<eos> You won that one I guess.
No.<eos> So boy trouble?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Why don't you come back to the party?<eos> Your brother's doing a very fine job.<eos> I just lost out to dance with a beautiful woman.<eos> Maybe I could have one with you?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Well, surely there's something we can do to cheer you up.<eos> Pretty little thing like you should be enjoying yourself.
You know, you could have just become an actress.<eos> Not the same thing.<eos> I was kidding. I don't really care anymore about how you became you. Really?<eos> I thought you wanted the truth.<eos> I know what really gets you off about being on the con.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Tell me.<eos> See you in the game, Maddie.<eos> - Right down this way, please.<eos> - You got it.
Although something tells me, all you're gonna be thinking about is trying to find me.<eos> Roll it down.<eos> Hands on the wheel.<eos> Real slow now.<eos> License and registration.<eos> Everything all right, officer?<eos> Sorry there, sir.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> I most certainly will.<eos> Hey, have you seen a woman in a wedding dress?
Not anymore.<eos> Go back to the office.<eos> Sir, I...<eos> Thank you, Gregorio.<eos> Don't even start.<eos> Gregorio's a good agent.<eos> We need her.<eos> The FBI, NCIS and the Coast Guard are working the case.<eos> That's plenty of manpower.<eos> Well, you're the boss.
Special Agent Pride.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Hope it's all right that I drop by.<eos> I...<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> How you were treated yesterday.<eos> FBI's not much on courtesy.<eos> It's not how I would have handled things.<eos> Especially since you're engaged to Eliza.
Sometimes, I think they like being dissatisfied. Preach.<eos> If you do kill me, I guess you'll spare me decades of trying to fix a kingdom hell-bent on staying broken, doomed to sexual frustration.<eos> - But you have a wife.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Oh, and I'm going to be a father, if that changes your mind about the whole killing me thing.<eos> Wish I had a choice, but one of us has to die, and I'm not the one up a tree.<eos> Worth a shot.<eos> At least you don't have to worry about getting old.<eos> Excuse me. I would age like a fine wine.<eos> And you are a total DILF.
"I am Anand Trivedi."<eos> "And now for the main headlines."<eos> "Tension and violence continues to build in East Pakistan."<eos> "Pakistan's President Yahya Khan has said..."<eos> "...that the opposition groups are getting open support from India."<eos> "In return, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi clarified that..."<eos> "... India has no association with the internal conflicts of its neighboring country."<eos> "But if Pakistan decides to take any military action..."<eos> "...then our armies are capable of giving a fitting reply."<eos> Papa, if there's a war will you have to go?

East Pakistan is landlocked by India from all three sides.<eos> Sending supplies by road ways is impossible.<eos> By air, the supplies will be insufficient.<eos> And anyway, we'll have to enter Indian airspace.<eos> In this situation... we have only one option left.<eos> The sea-route.<eos> All the way...up here.<eos> We can tackle the Indian fleet, but...<eos> INS Vikrant!<eos> You know...
The obvious targets are Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Madras and Port Blair.<eos> And if that's the case, then they will launch a surprise attack.<eos> Swift and from the high sea.<eos> We must keep an eye on this area, sir.<eos> What is the vessel status out there?<eos> All deployed, sir...except S21.<eos> Send it immediately... for recce operation.<eos> But sir...<eos> S21 is under Capt. Rann Vijay Singh's command.<eos> And you know him pretty well.
We've no choice.<eos> If enemy presence is detected in this search operation then Capt. Rann Vijay Singh will not wait for orders before attacking.<eos> Sir, it will trigger a war.<eos> Where is Lt. Commander Arjun?<eos> 500 kms from Visakhapatnam Port. 80 degrees east... 600 nautical miles down.<eos> This is our area of operation.<eos> Sir, what are my orders sir?<eos> Capt. Rann Vijay Singh, your mission will be passive.<eos> This is just a search operation.<eos> If you detect enemy presence, you must report back.

Rann Vijay Singh, your mission will be passive.<eos> This is just a search operation.<eos> If you detect enemy presence, you must report back.<eos> And wait for further instructions.<eos> And if I come face-to-face with the enemy do I 'still' report back, wait for your instructions?<eos> Yes...headquarters will instruct you what to do next.

The Mission's called 'Operation Sea-Sight'.<eos> And this is a classified mission.<eos> Sir, if I see a...<eos> - Remember, we're still not at war.<eos> Understand?<eos> This is only a recce mission.<eos> We've to wait and watch.<eos> Don't worry, I'll be back soon.<eos> Finally we're going to be blessed with this bundle of joy.<eos> Do you have to go?
Oh, that's good.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> By the way, sir...how long do we have to wait?<eos> Officer Arjun is coming.<eos> Look Arjun, we all know Rann Vijay Singh very well.<eos> And we've strict instructions...<eos> Under no circumstances do we attack first.<eos> And that's your responsibility.<eos> Sir.<eos> Pankaj, how are you?
Where is your officer by the way?<eos> - He's on his way.<eos> We're almost ready to go, sir.<eos> But we can't leave.<eos> Political...<eos> Our officer is coming, you see.<eos> So we wait...and wait...wait...<eos> Iqbal.<eos> - Ramsagar.<eos> How are you?
We're almost ready to go, sir.<eos> But we can't leave.<eos> Political...<eos> Our officer is coming, you see.<eos> So we wait...and wait...wait...<eos> Iqbal.<eos> - Ramsagar.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Hello.<eos> You're their benefactor until we all come back.
Executive officer.<eos> - Hello, sir.<eos> Second in command.<eos> - Sir.<eos> The orders are in your lockers.<eos> - Okay.<eos> These are the keys.<eos> Your mission goes as planned.<eos> The torpedo key.<eos> I hope you won't need it.
With 5 degrees aft bubble.<eos> Sir, half ahead two.<eos> two going half ahead, sir.<eos> Dive to 40 meters with 5 degrees aft bubble.<eos> Sir.<eos> What's this, Surya?<eos> For drying clothes, I guess.<eos> Underwear...<eos> For drying underwear...<eos> Only if you wash them this year.
Sir, half ahead two.<eos> two going half ahead, sir.<eos> Dive to 40 meters with 5 degrees aft bubble.<eos> Sir.<eos> What's this, Surya?<eos> For drying clothes, I guess.<eos> Underwear...<eos> For drying underwear...<eos> Only if you wash them this year.<eos> How can you dry clothes on this shaky line?
How much?<eos> 200,000 tons.<eos> All systems are running fine, sir.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Conduct emergency drill.<eos> Now, sir?<eos> - Yes, why?<eos> The crew hasn't completely settled in, sir.<eos> Yes, of course...<eos> Before breaking your jaw the enemy would like to know whether you brushed your teeth, or not.
Goodnight, Arjun.<eos> Sir...<eos> Radio message.<eos> Order to reach a location, sir.<eos> Our first mission, gentlemen. Let's toast to that.<eos> General Patton.<eos> Every soldier's role model.<eos> They even made a movie on him.<eos> It won the Oscar this year.<eos> Did you see it?
- Good.<eos> Sir, this entire area is clear.<eos> Sir, no sonar contact in this area either.<eos> Sir, we've had no sonar contacts anywhere.<eos> Shall we consider 'Operation Sea-Sight a success?<eos> Move aside...move...<eos> Good news everyone...<eos> Our first mission is a success.<eos> Prepare to head home.<eos> Brighten up...you can go home and get married now.
We'll start celebrating right here, from hell.<eos> We'll have a ball.<eos> Yes, sir...yes, sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> Mr. Girish Kumar from RAW.<eos> He has information for us.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Sir, I've classified information.<eos> The Director gave me special instructions that I must convey this message to you personally.
Devaraj.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Just...just hold till the bloody enemy kills you.<eos> Because that's the order.<eos> Useless politics.<eos> Dive to 40 meters.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Depth 40 meters, holding sir.<eos> We're both refugees.<eos> But, why were you singing your rebel anthem?
- Sir.<eos> Just...just hold till the bloody enemy kills you.<eos> Because that's the order.<eos> Useless politics.<eos> Dive to 40 meters.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Depth 40 meters, holding sir.<eos> We're both refugees.<eos> But, why were you singing your rebel anthem?<eos> We thought you're...
- Fantastic!<eos> Keep tracking.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Devaraj.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The sonar spotting has been done. 2000 meters.<eos> We dive 250...7 degree aft bubble.<eos> Heading west...and we torpedo the enemy.<eos> Sir we must stay on hold until our orders don't change.<eos> Rann Vijay Singh doesn't wait for any orders, and you know that.
It's my call...that we head west, full speed.<eos> Sir...you're the senior naval officer.<eos> You know that the discipline of the armed forces is our identity.<eos> That's the difference... between us and the rogue forces.<eos> One small mistake... can lead to an Indo-Pak war.<eos> And 650 million civilians will have to pay for it.<eos> And sir you cannot fire without joint orders, sir.<eos> Sir. He's right.<eos> According to the rules I cannot proceed without your joint orders.<eos> So you want to play 'rules'?
You need both our permission to fire torpedoes, don't you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - How sad...<eos> Sad!<eos> And do I need anyone's permission...to conduct a drill?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Well then... let's dive 250 aft 7 degrees, heading west.<eos> Since we've found the enemy, let's wrap up 'Operation Sea-Sight'.<eos> So let's torpedo the enemy.<eos> But Devaraj, I don't want you to be...
I can only follow rules. And according to the rules, it's my duty to implement the captain's orders during a drill.<eos> Please.<eos> Sir.<eos> Torpedo in tube no. 1...ready to fire, sir.<eos> Depth 240 meters, sir.<eos> Attention all stations, this is your captain.<eos> Gentlemen, don't ever forget this moment.<eos> Not every soldier lives to see this day.<eos> Victory...<eos> Victory is something that will never be handed to you. You have to fight for it.
Let them know where we are.<eos> Send clear signals.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> She was hungry, so...<eos> Oh...we completely forgot about the kid in this emergency.<eos> This is for you.<eos> There was only one.<eos> Officer.<eos> Thank you, for saving our lives.<eos> This would've never happened if you had firmly told the captain to follow head-quarter's orders.
His body was riddled with bullets.<eos> Later...head quarters also sent medals.<eos> Devaraj!<eos> We won't head back until this Pakistani submarine isn't destroyed.<eos> Sir, we...<eos> - And you, officer...<eos> Stop me if you can.<eos> Full speed ahead.<eos> - Sir, the consequences...<eos> If you point that gun at the captain then I'll arrest you for mutiny.
Come on, come on, come boys.<eos> We've no time.<eos> Yeah...go on.<eos> Good.<eos> Now remove the jack.<eos> Multiple injuries.<eos> Deep incisive wound in the left shoulder.<eos> We need to wait until the anesthesia kicks in.<eos> Is he fine?<eos> Arjun...now you're in command.
Dismissed.<eos> - Sorry, sir...but I can't follow this.<eos> You know this submarine better.<eos> You've been with our captain longer...<eos> - Jadhav, dismissed.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> Headquarters has designated officer Arjun with special powers.<eos> It's an order.<eos> I accept him as my captain.<eos> And so will you.
Position.<eos> Port 265 degrees west, center 900, sir.<eos> Program torpedo.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Centre 900.<eos> Centre 865.<eos> Centre 850.<eos> It's not too far.<eos> Centre 800, sir.<eos> You were right. - 780.
Compartment 6, okay sir.<eos> Compartment 7, okay sir.<eos> Alright boys, listen up.<eos> This isn't over yet.<eos> We're still at war.<eos> We're diving to 350, sir.<eos> They cannot locate us at that depth.<eos> Arjun...350 meters means the seabed.<eos> The battery unit can fail at any time.<eos> I hope you're aware of that.
- No. I hate the stupid updates.<eos> I...<eos> I don't even do it.<eos> I'll do it for you.<eos> It's quite easy.<eos> I can't stand that crap.<eos> Anyway, Kendra says you haven't been around for the last few nights.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, I was hoping she hadn't noticed.<eos> You've got a lot of apps on here.
I just love that we can talk things out like this, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Communication.<eos> It's so important.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Why are you breathing so heavy?<eos> 'Cause... you take my breath away.<eos> You still gotta get her the ring.<eos> - It's the right thing to do.<eos> - You're not hearing me.
To get her a ring that she may or may not even want?<eos> Shame on you, guy.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> Look, I thought you were just trying to do something nice for your wife.<eos> I was.<eos> But then she wanted to do something nice for me.<eos> So if you think about it,<eos> I'm actually putting her needs before mine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a real angel, guy.
I'm actually putting her needs before mine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a real angel, guy.<eos> It's kinda like the man upstairs is telling you forget about the ring, get yourself an ATV that I can ride, too.<eos> Yeah, maybe, but by accepting this miracle quad,<eos> I'm actually getting closer to God.<eos> Yeah, especially if you don't wear a helmet.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> You just made top of the list of people who can't ride it.<eos> Hey, if you're gonna have a guilty conscience,
- Round three? - No.<eos> We're done sparring.<eos> You see, despite your best efforts to stymie us in this investigation, we figured out who you were covering for.<eos> Edward Gabler.<eos> You know what else we figured out?<eos> We figured out what was stolen from that safe.<eos> It was the knife that Gabler used to kill his girlfriend, Heather Mayfield.<eos> We know that because we pulled her autopsy report.<eos> And our M.E. compared her stab wound to the victim's stab wound, and confirmed that it was the same blade.<eos> Somehow Leo Stein figured out that you had that knife.

But I couldn't exactly turn it over, either.<eos> So I stuck it in our safe, and I tried to forget about it.<eos> And for years I did...<eos> until Leo came to see me.<eos> He said he had reason to believe the firm had the knife.<eos> He threatened to go public.<eos> He told me he wanted justice for Heather.<eos> It wasn't about the money for him.<eos> He was... I don't know... An idealist.<eos> So you fired him just in case he did go public.
Look, I don't want any part of this, you understand?<eos> Then go!<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Look. Don't do this.<eos> I have more money.<eos> I can pay you whatever you want.<eos> I just gave away $2 million.<eos> You actually think I care about money?<eos> I'm doing this for Heather.<eos> You killed my sister.
Put the gun down, Alan.<eos> He's not worth it.<eos> Listen, you've got the evidence in your hand.<eos> They got to retry the case.<eos> Don't throw your life away 'cause of this guy.<eos> What life?<eos> My life is over.<eos> An innocent man was killed this morning.<eos> And I'm an accessory.<eos> Alan, you're not like him.
This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.<eos> That does, that does surprise me.<eos> Surprises us all, Max, but go on.<eos> I've always been on the receiving end of your sarcasm, but, truth be told, it never bothered me.<eos> I always took them as a token of affection.<eos> I'm going to miss your little quips.<eos> I hope that you would consider texting me one of those from time to time.<eos> To you, buddy.<eos> Lieutenant Kelly.<eos> Nobody understands the meaning of ohana more than you.
And for that reason, among many others, you are gonna make an amazing father to little Sara.<eos> And from what I've already seen, you already are.<eos> Mahalo, brother.<eos> Kono.<eos> Without you, I would've never married my beautiful Sabrina.<eos> And Detective Williams is my role model as an individual, but your loving relationship with Adam is something that Sabrina and I hope to emulate.<eos> Love you, Max.<eos> Sergeant Grover. I'll miss your smile.<eos> Yes, that one.<eos> I know a part of you will always belong to Chicago, but Hawaii has claimed you as one of its sons, and I truly believe that the islands are a better place because you are here.
My minister murdered.<eos> His wife slain.<eos> The killer dead by her own hand.<eos> And still the contagion spreads.<eos> It is in my walls.<eos> It is in my blood and in my mind.<eos> Is it any wonder that I've not slept?<eos> If such tragedies befall me while I wake,<eos> what kind of hell awaits me should I ever fall asleep?<eos> You have failed me for the last time, Monseur Marchal.

I do not understand why the King allowed it.<eos> A sign of weakness, perhaps?<eos> Magnanimity, strength.<eos> Cruel one moment, kind the very next.<eos> The winds of power are not constant.<eos> Now, let us talk of the future.<eos> How might I repay you?<eos> With your loyalty.<eos> The courtyard is a ladder.<eos> Have you ever noticed that?
The courtyard is a ladder.<eos> Have you ever noticed that?<eos> But opportunity does not shine equally for all, but you can't believe you have the misfortune to be a woman.<eos> Thus, when my noble clients require a little help,<eos> I'm here.<eos> And there are many.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> I fear my good friend, Madame de Montespan, may soon need allies.<eos> i want you to befriend her.<eos> What use would she have of me? She already has you.

The world may be poisoned but you are the antidote.<eos> And until he realizes this?<eos> He shall continue to prying, interrogating, hitting people.<eos> It's not what you do, it's who you are.<eos> This poison is like love.<eos> How so?<eos> It has a mystery ingredient.<eos> I do not yet know where it comes from but I will not stop looking until I find out.<eos> You see, it's not what I do, it's who I am.<eos> Where are you going?

Me?<eos> And Amsterdam?<eos> It will be yours.<eos> You are placing the entire fate of France in my hands, Why?<eos> I hardly have to say it.<eos> Might be nice to hear.<eos> Glory.<eos> Whose?<eos> Ours.<eos> It is time for you to carve your name in history.
I hardly have to say it.<eos> Might be nice to hear.<eos> Glory.<eos> Whose?<eos> Ours.<eos> It is time for you to carve your name in history.<eos> I was always under the impression only one of us could win.<eos> There can be two winners, providing they are on the same side.<eos> We are on the same side, aren't we?<eos> How are you sleeping?
I fail to see how any marriage can be happy.<eos> If the terms are satisfactory, the union productive...<eos> For some, heaven.<eos> Others, a prison with no escape.<eos> There is always means of escape.<eos> It is merely a case of finding it.<eos> I have a friend who specializes in such matters.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Another four weeks, perhaps five.<eos> Do you have other children?
Where are they?<eos> Well, one fell to the pox and two with my cousin in Lyon.<eos> and Father Etienne takes care of the others.<eos> Father Etienne?<eos> Takes confession and gives money to those who aren't earning.<eos> And, if we have unwanted children, takes them off our hands and places them in a hospital for orphans and strays.<eos> He is a saint, mark my words.<eos> I shall return in a week. Avoid too much exertion.<eos> I'll spend my days in bed, then!<eos> You must be Father Etienne.

To have an intelligent woman as one's counsel is, perhaps, the best tactic of all.<eos> If I may, Madame, I believe women to be the equal to men where strategy is concerned.<eos> Explain.<eos> Well, it seems to me, Sire, that living in Versailles is a constant balance between power and negotiation.<eos> It is women who must negotiate the hallwayss of Versailles with no power at all.<eos> Not all women are without power<eos> Please do not misunderstand me, Madame.<eos> Your skills may not be visible to most but they are just as effective.<eos> The journey, Sire, is war.<eos> You are preparing to leave for Holland.
The journey, Sire, is war.<eos> You are preparing to leave for Holland.<eos> No, I'm staying here.<eos> I see..<eos> Then who will lead the army, Sire?<eos> My brother.<eos> Yes, he showed great bravery in the Spanish Netherlands.<eos> I remember hearing such stories about him.<eos> He is a master of the battlefield.<eos> While you are a master of war, are you not, Sire?

I am relieved to hear it.<eos> The King must be informed, of course.<eos> We shall visit him together.<eos> He will, no doubt, dismiss my own account. but he can hardly question the word of a man of God.<eos> Very attractive, don't you think?<eos> As are it's contents.<eos> Fragrances?<eos> Of a sort, yes.<eos> Each is carefully crafted to induce certain feelings and pleasures.<eos> Whether you seek repose or stimulation, We have just the thing for you.
Only 6,000, but for you...(five)<eos> Are you looking for something special?<eos> Deep water, Your Highness?<eos> No, and I have no intention of it.<eos> Well, allow me to convince you otherwise.<eos> Being at Versailles and not throwing one's money around is frowned upon.<eos> Good morning, Your Highness.<eos> May I interest you in some silks?<eos> I find wool to be more insulating.<eos> But then you are wearing a sheep.
I find wool to be more insulating.<eos> But then you are wearing a sheep.<eos> It's better than wearing a worm.<eos> These are all fetching.<eos> Fragrance?<eos> Packing fragrance, Your Highness, to perfume your fabric.<eos> That is all?<eos> Oh, how bizarre.<eos> Duchess, your beauty puts every woman in the room to shame!<eos> You once mentioned a friend of yours that offers marriage advice.

To steady herself, perhaps?<eos> That, of course, was the first thought that came into my head, Sire.<eos> Have you ever lost a child?<eos> No, Sire.<eos> Then what qualifies you to speak of her state of mind or motives?<eos> If I understand the details correctly, her motives were very clear and inapropriate towards someone Of The Cloth.<eos> They were of a sensuous nature.<eos> My King?<eos> Leave the matter with me.<eos> Is that how you seduce all the women?

You're dead.<eos> He's given me his blessing.<eos> I kissed his hand.<eos> And now, I kiss yours.<eos> We have so much catching up to do.<eos> Father Pascal came to visit me, just after the passing of our daughter.<eos> I was feeling weak and faint and I almost collapsed.<eos> As I did, I stretched out a hand and I clasped him by the cassock.<eos> He helped me to my feet but his hands wandered in the most intrusive way.<eos> You have not mentioned this before.

The slow treatment, will he be aware of it?<eos> He will but have no sense of the cause.<eos> My dear, the choice is simple:<eos> death or suffering.<eos> Suffering.<eos> Why does the King get to declare war and I don't?<eos> Why can't I do that?<eos> In fact, you know, I think I will.<eos> I will declare war on someone today.<eos> You can't go.

My uncle Hugh, miserable bugger!<eos> The only time I ever saw him smile was when his wife fell off a horse.<eos> You'll miss him terribly, I suppose.<eos> Not as much as I will miss you, darling.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> The door...<eos> Bontemps?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> He once commanded me to tell him, should the situation ever arise, if a woman ever tilt his mind on matters of state...<eos> How can you be sure it is she who affects him so?
Bontemps?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> He once commanded me to tell him, should the situation ever arise, if a woman ever tilt his mind on matters of state...<eos> How can you be sure it is she who affects him so?<eos> All I know is, ever since he has chosen Madame, our needs are plenty and his time is finite.<eos> We can all be drunk in love, Bontemps.<eos> Drunk or sober, he will not listen to me.<eos> As his valet, I have no voice.<eos> Come and have a drink with me.<eos> Perhaps, you should try to get some sleep, Sire.

The wise ones do, Your Majesty.<eos> I've seen you sleep.<eos> I must speak my mind, Sire.<eos> These are not the words of a valet.<eos> No, Sire. They are the words of a friend.<eos> Well, I do not wish to hear them.<eos> I anticipated that, Sire,<eos> So, I have given my words to another.<eos> Highness! So, both my brother and my valet are plotting against me, is that right?<eos> Not long ago, you looked me in the eye and said...
Highness! So, both my brother and my valet are plotting against me, is that right?<eos> Not long ago, you looked me in the eye and said...<eos> Is this madness?<eos> "Any woman would influence me in matters of state..."<eos> "... you will tell me and by the morning, she will be gone."<eos> I said enough!<eos> Sire!<eos> It was your idea, was it? This spectacle!<eos> It was mine.<eos> You?

It's not yet 9 o'clock!<eos> I have made an enemy of the Queen and she is plotting against me.<eos> I need wine.<eos> I can understand her disapproval but conspiring against another seems far beyond her character.<eos> but it's that idiot priest!<eos> He's turned her to it.<eos> Father Pascal?<eos> I find that surprising.<eos> He's both devout and inspiring.<eos> Sometimes, Francoise, you're so naive.

Most unsuitable.<eos> Will we win?<eos> I believe so.<eos> But I confess I was surprised when the King chose to remain.<eos> As glorious as he is on the battlefield, he is not his brother.<eos> No doubt, he prefers to confront his adversaries closer to home.<eos> But where is the glory in that?<eos> Swords over muskets any day, if you ask me!<eos> A fight is not a fight unless there's a blade involved!<eos> You're not going.

Kings must lead, they do not follow.<eos> I'm called by a higher purpose to command my armies myself.<eos> It is I who must go.<eos> You are to remain here.<eos> Is that it?<eos> No apology, no nothing!<eos> I cannot stay here any longer.<eos> What is this higher purpose?<eos> Bontemps, he came to me because he was concerned, because we're all concerned.<eos> Then you will know why I must go.
Perhaps His Majesty has forgotten.<eos> Whilst I appreciate my brother's bravery, I believe he is a winner of battles, not wars.<eos> I shall lead he attack on Holland.<eos> This is wonderful news, Sire!<eos> Your loyalty gives me great comfort.<eos> The question of Regent remains.<eos> Madame,<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> My mother asked you for your help.<eos> You gave it gladly and received, in return, a betrayal of that goodwill.

My mother asked you for your help.<eos> You gave it gladly and received, in return, a betrayal of that goodwill.<eos> Is that why you came here?<eos> To apologize?<eos> In part.<eos> I also came here because we have a common acquaintance.<eos> A curious woman, lives in the village.<eos> Sometimes goes by the name of<eos> Ariadne.<eos> You know her?
And now she has asked me to help you.<eos> With what?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Well, I cannot think what she meant.<eos> Do you know the Queen's new confessor?<eos> Father Pascal.<eos> I know his face and reputation.<eos> Perhaps we should take a turn in the garden.<eos> I hear the lilies are in bloom.<eos> You are here for confession, perhaps?

I was tempted<eos> by the sins<eos> of the flesh."<eos> Can you please press this bloom between the fold?<eos> I believe this is what heaven must smell like.<eos> The chapel should be filled with them.<eos> Very pleasant.<eos> What is the meaning of this letter?<eos> Alas, it's a suicide note.<eos> My son, you do not plan to take your own life?
Alas, it's a suicide note.<eos> My son, you do not plan to take your own life?<eos> Not mine, no.<eos> Watch over me while I take my rest and deliver me from danger.<eos> May thy grace be with me always.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I admire your devotion.<eos> I know no greater love in this world.<eos> Will you pray for me, Madame, when I go to war?

Shall I come back later?<eos> Good idea!<eos> I see.<eos> Here I was looking for someone to declare war on, when the answer was right under my nose.<eos> In accordance with the laws of our kingdom,<eos> I, Louis XIV, King of France, solemnly confirm that in my absence for reasons of war, the Regency of France and all her possessions shall be placed in the hands of<eos> Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of France,<eos> Queen Consort of Navarre.<eos> My mother performed the same role with distinction<eos> I know I can rely on you to do the same.
Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of France,<eos> Queen Consort of Navarre.<eos> My mother performed the same role with distinction<eos> I know I can rely on you to do the same.<eos> I'll take you to the salon to effect some key introductions.<eos> Please allow me that honor? .<eos> Chevalier de Lorraine, may I present my niece, Isabelle.<eos> Isabelle...<eos> Le Chevalier, one of the court's most charming bachelors.<eos> I can see already, you will be a great success.
Excuse me.<eos> I am looking for some seeds.<eos> What kind of seeds?<eos> Akar Saga.<eos> Why that seed?<eos> I'm a student of the healing arts.<eos> No one can take from this plant.<eos> I cannot help you.<eos> I have many other seeds with ? properties.<eos> Perhaps you have some Ashoka seeds?
Perhaps you have some Ashoka seeds?<eos> I have a patient with an intestinal disorder.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Begone!<eos> Do you hear me?
I have a patient with an intestinal disorder.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Begone!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Are you hurt, my dear?
Step aside!<eos> Out of my way!<eos> I believe this was intended for you, Majesty.<eos> Is it by his hand?<eos> How could he do such a thing?<eos> How indeed?<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> He's not a man to take his own life.<eos> The note was by his hand.<eos> You think otherwise?

I don't know what to think, Sire.<eos> I'm too bound in grief right now.<eos> You understand the weight that falls upon your shoulders in my absence?<eos> Trust your advisors, keep your own counsel., hide your true feelings.<eos> Good day, Madame.<eos> Make me proud of you.<eos> Your word will be law, Sire, and disobedience will find it's reward.<eos> Please, take me with you.<eos> I will be safer at war in Holland than at war here.<eos> You fear the Queen as Regent?

There will be plenty...<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> - All right, move it on the bus.<eos> Get off me.<eos> Do you understand what you did?<eos> I don't care what it takes. I want them found.<eos> Commander, thank you for meeting me on such short notice.<eos> I don't have a lot of time, Mr. Snyder.<eos> None of us do, from what I understand.<eos> What do you want?
Does the Global Authority still have any interest in reclaiming the stolen gauntlet?<eos> I mean, that's what started this whole hullabaloo in the first place, isn't it?<eos> I figure it must still have some value.<eos> You have access to it?<eos> I deal in information.<eos> I deal in absolutes.<eos> If I could somehow provide information that led to the gauntlet's recovery, what would it be worth to the Global Authority?<eos> You're asking that as a representative of the Governor-General?<eos> Today, I'm representing myself.<eos> If you were to be the one to lead us to the gauntlet, I promise you, Mr. Snyder, you'll never want for anything again.

- It's okay.<eos> He's safe.<eos> Come on, hand 'em over.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Just ask somebody!<eos> - Wrong way.<eos> - I made a mistake.<eos> Back up.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> Are you all right, sir?
Please make your way to your assigned evacuation centers.<eos> Come, come.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> Go, go, go. Right, right out there.<eos> Right there.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There's room.<eos> - We can take you with us.<eos> - Ah, no.<eos> You need to stay indoors.
Him?<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not going with him.<eos> He's our ticket out of here.<eos> You must be Charlie.<eos> Heard a lot about you.<eos> I'm Alan.<eos> Hi.<eos> You made us breakfast.
No way.<eos> I'm not going with him.<eos> He's our ticket out of here.<eos> You must be Charlie.<eos> Heard a lot about you.<eos> I'm Alan.<eos> Hi.<eos> You made us breakfast.<eos> Was it any good?<eos> You made eggs.
Her orders.<eos> Move into the exclusion zone.<eos> - Tell your story to my sergeant.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> One vehicle coming through!<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Clear.<eos> All right, move forward.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> Are you the sergeant?
That's exactly what I'm trying to do here.<eos> My orders are to escort these children out of the Colony.<eos> I'm no different than you, Sergeant.<eos> Just a loyal soldier, following orders.<eos> What happens if he calls the Governor-General's office?<eos> She already evacuated.<eos> They won't be able to reach her.<eos> This is taking too long.<eos> Everybody, get ready to put your head down if I say so.<eos> If you do anything other than stick to our story, this is all over.
You all know who we are.<eos> So you know how desperate we must be to try this.<eos> They didn't tell you what's happening, did they?<eos> Why they doubled up the shifts this morning.<eos> Or told you to seal the gateway and hold it no matter what you hear.<eos> The bloc's being evac'd.<eos> That's their cover story.<eos> What's really happening is Total Rendition.<eos> The RAPs are gonna send the whole bloc... to the Factory.<eos> All of us, me, my wife, my kids, you, and all of your families.

Ve day, victory in europe.<eos> And a celebration is underway Near a royal air force base 100 miles northwest of london.<eos> What can I get you, gentlemen?<eos> A kiss.<eos> I'm afraid we stopped Serving those yesterday.<eos> Well, I suppose it will just have to. Be four pints of Your finest ale.<eos> With Newfound peace and hope, Everyone is thinking about A new future for themselves. But one is dreaming of A new future for us all.<eos> Today, we Think about arthur c. Clarke. As one of the Greatest science fiction.<eos> He was a radar technician In world war ii. He then writes wearing his Science hat and his science. Fiction writer hat, not A science fiction story,<eos> You're An ingenious man, arthur, But you're also infuriating.

Now, imagine if A rocket were to be fired. Vertically without deviation.<eos> It would reach the f1 and Probably the f2 layer, So this means that.<eos> It's possible To send instruments of. All kinds into the ionosphere.<eos> Exactly, so, if a rocket.<eos> Were to achieve a speed Of eight kilometers per second. Whilst traveling parallel With the earth's surface, It would continue to circle In a closed door orbit for a,<eos> Therefore, becoming An artificial satellite.<eos> Now, at the correct Distance from earth, It would make one Revolution every 24 hours, But it remains stationary, Of course, above the same spot.<eos> So, if we were to have Three repeater stations, 120 degrees apart, It could, I believe, Give television and microwave Coverage to the entire planet.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> You're a bloody genius.
No, I-I rechecked all my calculations last night. They're solid.<eos> And I showed the numbers to my advisor, Professor Croft.<eos> Five hours later, he disappeared, and didn't show up for class.<eos> - His place was trashed.<eos> - Trashed?<eos> There were big, scary goons staking out his house.<eos> They chased my ass across campus.<eos> Now either this is an amazing coincidence, or I'm onto something that someone, somewhere, doesn't want public.<eos> I'm telling you, Mr. Tanz, the sky is falling.<eos> And you may be the only person that can do something about it.
Let's not talk about that thing.<eos> It's been two years.<eos> I'm working on it, dad.<eos> But it's hard, you know.<eos> It's got a mind of its own.<eos> - And a temper.<eos> - Aldo.<eos> For god's sake.<eos> He's with a bunch of super heroes.<eos> Aldo: You think Superman or someone could take that thing off him.
You might say, it's addictive.<eos> Improves muscle tone too.<eos> Losing your edge.<eos> Your friends have made you soft.<eos> Like I said, soft.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> You betrayed us, why?<eos> Betrayed?<eos> That assumes I was ever on your side in the first place.<eos> There you go, Mr. Fernandez.
- Especially by you.<eos> - I don't wanna go back.<eos> The Titans are always acting like they care so much.<eos> It messes with my head.<eos> Just a little longer, Terra.<eos> With the money from blood we'll form our own league of assassins.<eos> You and I.<eos> Together in every way.<eos> I didn't see you bringing quite so many weapons to our new place.<eos> - If you don't like them...
He had you pegged from the start.<eos> That's how he does it.<eos> Mixing truth with lies.<eos> You're so freaking annoying.<eos> You don't know anything about him.<eos> He saved me.<eos> Let me guess, he kept you isolated.<eos> Dependent. Told you everyone was your enemy.<eos> Trained you, ruthlessly.<eos> And promised you exactly what you wanted.
There's a new girl, right?<eos> Beast Boy: All I can say is that she's a wonderful addition to the team.<eos> - Come on, Gar...<eos> - Starfire would kill me.<eos> Kevin: There's no way Starfire is listening to this, man, she's brushing her hair.<eos> Forget it.<eos> My lips are sealed. Whoa, man, he just turned into a seal, folks, I swear.<eos> But really, Gar, is she gonna, like, replace Terra?<eos> Terra?<eos> Yeah, you know, there are lots of stories about her.
It's good.<eos> I'm glad you're impressed.<eos> Okay. So do you want the bad news, or the really bad news?<eos> You pick.<eos> So the cops came and searched your boat.<eos> They found half a dozen shark fins packed in ice below deck.<eos> Depending on the species, that's a $30,000 haul.<eos> But it's about a $50,000 fine, since this is your second offense.<eos> It's a fish, lady.<eos> Just like the ahi you throw on the grill, only bigger.

A lot of blood.<eos> Human blood.<eos> Did some tests, found out that it belonged to, Sam Harrison.<eos> You know who that is, right?<eos> I think that he came to you, okay, and said he wanted you to help him find a great white shark, like Roy Scheider, in Jaws.<eos> You know.<eos> Didn't go as planned.<eos> Shark bites the guy.<eos> You can't take him to the hospital because you're a shark finner... It's not good for business...<eos> So you, you cut him up, hang him up there on the dock, make it look like a shark-lover did it.
Please come in.<eos> Yo, Professor Nutsack!<eos> Stinky Dickweed!<eos> How are you, my man?<eos> - Aren't you glad you made bread?<eos> - Hey. Leanne, Mitch, this is my daughter Christy.<eos> - Hi, Christy. - Hey.<eos> Nice to meet you both.<eos> I'm sorry I have to go, I have a class and then work.<eos> - What do you do?
They brought it from L.A. in case there wasn't enough wine in Napa Valley.<eos> Chug, chug, chug, chug! And there might not be.<eos> I'm so drunk, I can't feel my legs.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Hey, hen party in the kitchen!<eos> Old school!<eos> Look, it's the Ghost of Christmas Past.<eos> Hey, um, Christy, can I...<eos> Can I tell you something that I've been thinking about all night?<eos> You should go home and I should go to bed?
So am I.<eos> Wink, wink.<eos> Whoa, you look amazing.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Leanne, I was told to bring you this.<eos> - Gracias.<eos> - Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> The hot cheese is making its move.<eos> You really are good at what you do.
- Yep, I went to a couple of meetings,<eos> I heard the spiel, I bought a book, and then one night I'm looking around the room and I said to myself, "Mitch, these aren't your people, these people are quitters.<eos> You're not a quitter, u'rehe opposite of that, you're a successful film director."<eos> Move it. - Mm.<eos> - Not that way.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Bad!<eos> Bad hand!<eos> We-We-We talked about that.<eos> Thank God I brought my good hand.<eos> Okay. You're Adam's friend, and you're really drunk right now, so I'm gonna be a sport and give both your hands a pass. But if it ever happens again,
She could be here too, for all we know.<eos> So what, we got about four, five hours left of oxygen?<eos> Maybe less.<eos> I'm sorry to get you involved in all of this.<eos> These men, they're holding my friends hostage, and I... I didn't have a choice.<eos> I suppose it's my fault for wanting to believe you were really a fan.<eos> No, I am a fan.<eos> I think what you do is amazing.<eos> I got trapped underwater once, and it was the most terrifying moment of my life.<eos> And you, you lock yourself up to entertain people for a living.
Just stay optimistic.<eos> Because now, we can change nothing.<eos> The winner, Peter Pouly.<eos> - I felt pretty good.<eos> I just had...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I've just had some bad luck days.<eos> Bryan, look at me.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You are what you are.
Got plenty to go on.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Call your son.<eos> Tell him turn himself in.<eos> We'll let you go.<eos> No charges.<eos> I wouldn't waste my time.<eos> Ryan will never give himself up to the cops.<eos> There's always Plan B.<eos> All right, you said Novak ripped you off for three cars, right?
Anything else?<eos> Because I'm 100% open to any advice or suggestions or criticism.<eos> Okay, um, tell me, Kim:<eos> Out of 13,000 other coppers, why do you think you deserve to be up here?<eos> I've paid my dues.<eos> I've been shot, run over, almost lost my partner, and I've...<eos> I've arrested more people than most police officers combined in this district, so.<eos> See, you know, that's the thing.<eos> Real police... they don't boast or expect any medals pinned to their chest.<eos> - You asked.
Let's do this.<eos> Doggy, doggy.<eos> When were they last fed?<eos> Six days, patrón.<eos> You know, we didn't always use the collar.<eos> But the dogs would tear open the carotid artery.<eos> Next thing you know, it would be over too quickly?<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> You're doing all this for your brother's honor, when the truth is he had none.<eos> You didn't know my brother.
I did it again.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> I was sleep-eating.<eos> Well, that explains that dream.<eos> "Commander McGarrett, please say yes.<eos> Dr. G. Kimbo."<eos> Who's Dr. Kimbo?<eos> Hey.<eos> You, you want to tell us something, Max?<eos> Well, it appears that Dr. Kimbo was under the mistaken impression that you were in charge of all the hiring decisions.
Pardon the interruption, but I got a customer here.<eos> He's interested in a test drive.<eos> Really?<eos> It looks like the only thing he's interested in is the free Danish tray.<eos> You know, it's funny you should mention food.<eos> He does have a passion for it.<eos> The man is looking to expand his shrimp truck business, and he told me he's gonna be needing about four or five new trucks.<eos> And you're just, handing me this amazing opportunity out of the goodness of your heart?<eos> Hell no.<eos> I'm doing it because when it comes to fleet sales around this place, I hear that you are the man.
Left?<eos> Sorry, bruddah, change of plans.<eos> How's it going?<eos> He's not gonna be taking the truck.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Paul, we know your nightclub is tanking.<eos> We know that you got creditors coming after you.<eos> We know that that $50,000 bonus would have gone a long way to saving your ass.<eos> So you think I killed Mitch for that bonus money.<eos> Well, you're a sharp guy.
I'm sure your coworkers will be happy to take some of those deals off your hands.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Just wait.<eos> I guess there was the phone call.<eos> Phone call. Yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> Last night, when I was leaving the dealership... I passed by Mitch's office and I-I overhead him on the phone.<eos> I didn't get the details, but the conversation sounded pretty heated.<eos> I mean, Mitch was pissed.<eos> And you get to work the next day, you found out Mitch has been killed, but you don't... you don't think to tell the cops about that phone call?
She needed new tires, so I brought her car to work today.<eos> New tires.<eos> Yeah, you got to get that taken care of.<eos> Good thinking. Good thinking.<eos> So, I guess you just took a cab home last night?<eos> I mean, the only reason I'm asking is 'cause I just... happen to notice that your car is in the parking lot as well.<eos> She dropped her own car off.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You know, you're real quick on your feet, Bob.
I-I was desperate. Look, I-if I don't make my quota,<eos> I'm out of a job.<eos> I-I figured Mitch would be pissed when he found out, but I was wrong.<eos> He went absolutely crazy.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> Sit down, tell me about it.<eos> He stormed in here, and he... he said I had to get the buyer on the phone and-and unwind the deal.<eos> Said he didn't care what I... what I said, but he had to have the car back right away.<eos> Which, as you know, it's impossible to do.
It's the cost of doing business.<eos> Everybody knows that.<eos> So even if this car was loaded with product, to kill a cop and a civilian in broad daylight doesn't make any sense to me.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> They wouldn't. Wouldn't be worth the risk.<eos> So why would they do it?<eos> Mr. Sung in the flesh.<eos> I'd say it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<eos> But it's not.<eos> You and Mitch... slick operation?
They wouldn't. Wouldn't be worth the risk.<eos> So why would they do it?<eos> Mr. Sung in the flesh.<eos> I'd say it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<eos> But it's not.<eos> You and Mitch... slick operation?<eos> I mean, judging by the mountain of cash we found at Mitch's house, I'd say business has been good.<eos> No witty retort to that one?<eos> Okay, then maybe you can help me understand something else.<eos> You're under the radar, you're making a bunch of money, things are good.
You had to know that would get my attention.<eos> I'm sure you hear this all the time, but I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Nice try, nice try.<eos> But we found the car and the bodies you left with it.<eos> And if you add your drug charges onto that, you're looking at the end of your days as a free man.<eos> Okay, look, all right, I've been smuggling drugs onto the island, but like you said, my game is all about avoiding cops, not capping them in the streets.<eos> Truth is, Mitch was no longer handling transpo for us.<eos> Really?<eos> He called a couple weeks back to say that he had a better offer and was calling time on our arrangement.<eos> You just accepted that?
Shit!<eos> - I need hardly remind you that I never miss.<eos> Your gun, please, and mine.<eos> - You think you're gonna get away with this, Bill?<eos> - Sam, open the closet.<eos> Get inside.<eos> - Oh, but, Bill, I'm not really good in confined spaces.<eos> - Sam!<eos> Closet or the bullet, come on.<eos> You, too, sheriff.
- Forgive me, I'm, I'm desperate.<eos> - Tickets, please, what's goin' on here?<eos> - It seems my friend here has misplaced his wallet.<eos> - Yeah, lose it all the time.<eos> - Well, I'm still gonna need a ticket, sir.<eos> - Don't worry, I'll take care of his ticket.<eos> - A whiskey salesman, huh?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Bourbon, rye, Brandy, through the whole midwest clear to Omaha.<eos> - Suits you down to a t,
- You remember Mattie, my cousin?<eos> - Well.<eos> - I introduced you to her.<eos> - Mattie, god.<eos> Fred Finley.<eos> - Bill hickok.<eos> - Whiskey.<eos> - Be two bits.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You ever had Kentucky bourbon?
- House rules.<eos> - You callin'?<eos> - I'm raising.<eos> 20 more.<eos> - Wait, hold on, you're a goddamn cheater.<eos> You've been winning' every hand all night long.<eos> - Now, hold on, son.<eos> This happens in poker.<eos> Even a blind hog finds an acorn once in awhile. - Oh, yeah?<eos> Who the hell are you?

I'd be happy to teach you.<eos> No, no, no, don't shoot him, Sam, he's just a boy.<eos> - Idiots.<eos> - Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> - What?<eos> - Which one's your horse?<eos> - Uh, that one.<eos> - Much obliged.<eos> Closer to the fire, so i can see you, please.<eos> What do you want, old man?

How would you like to be marshal of abilene?<eos> - Why the hell would I wanna do a crazy thing like that?<eos> - The same reason you just interfered in another man's quarrel and put yourself between him and a bullet.<eos> 'Cause sometimes it takes a good man to stop bad people.<eos> - I ain't a good man.<eos> - Son, every man's got his demons.<eos> - How much does the job pay?<eos> - A $100 a month.<eos> - That's not nearly enough.<eos> - 150 and $10 extra for every man you arrest.

Say, a house and some new clothes?<eos> - I think we can handle that.<eos> - Marshal, all right.<eos> - Now, you fine gentlemen let me know if y'all need anything else, okay?<eos> - Thank you, ma'am.<eos> - Thank you, ma'am. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Gentlemen, within a week, abilene will be an island in the sea of Texas cattle and Texas humans.<eos> - Will all due respect, mayor, this is a good Christian town, a god-fearin' town.<eos> - Oh, for god's sakes, get off your high horse, Jenkins.<eos> You and I both know that abilene can teach sodom and gomorrah a few lessons.

Why aren't you in school?<eos> - Don't you know nothin'?<eos> It's Saturday.<eos> - Saturday?<eos> Well, go on, get outta here.<eos> - I want my gun!<eos> - No, I'm keepin' your gun, I like it.<eos> - I said I want my gun, you bastard!<eos> - Hold up your hands, you son of a bitch!<eos> I saw what you did to that poor boy.

Ben, pour our new marshal a drink of the good stuff.<eos> - It's all right, Ben.<eos> We'll drink this bottle.<eos> - Ah, no, no.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> Whiskey's whiskey, ain't it?<eos> - Well, I prefer my own brand.<eos> - This is your brand.<eos> These are all your brands.<eos> Unless you're puttin' bad whiskey into good bottles.
Unless you're puttin' bad whiskey into good bottles.<eos> - How much you make a month, marshal, 150?<eos> That ain't very much.<eos> - Things are gonna change around here.<eos> First thing that's gonna change is this whiskey.<eos> I have a duty to the citizens in this town.<eos> - Would $50 a month change your mind?<eos> - You know, the second thing that's gonna change, these cards.<eos> I had a sneaking suspicion that people ain't been gettin' a square deal.<eos> - You're a good man, Bill.
- Would $50 a month change your mind?<eos> - You know, the second thing that's gonna change, these cards.<eos> I had a sneaking suspicion that people ain't been gettin' a square deal.<eos> - You're a good man, Bill.<eos> I spotted that right off.<eos> What do ya say a $100 a month?<eos> - What kind of a marshal would I be if I didn't follow the letter of the law?<eos> I reckon 25% of the house sounds about right, don't it?<eos> This offer is nonnegotiable.<eos> - Well, you're a pragmatist, Bill.
- What about me?<eos> You know I have a farm that needs plowing'.<eos> - I'm gonna give you some more advice, son.<eos> Drinking, gambling, and shootin', they don't mix, speaking from personal experience.<eos> Best you stay there till you've learned your lesson.<eos> - I'll need money then.<eos> - Money?<eos> What for?<eos> - For breakfast.<eos> You need to feed the prisoner.

but I'm keeping your gun.<eos> - You can't keep my gun.<eos> You can't keep my gun, please.<eos> - Sullivan, let that idiot out.<eos> - May I help you, marshal?<eos> - Yes, yes, of course, I,<eos> I would like to buy a hat.<eos> - What kind of hat?<eos> - Well, a lady's hat, but i don't know much about 'em, so I'd appreciate any suggestions you might have, Mattie.<eos> - You presume familiarity.

You know, that name sounds familiar.<eos> I swear I've heard it somewhere before.<eos> - Here.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's on the house.<eos> Take it and leave.<eos> No, no, no, I, i insist on paying.<eos> You know, this is a nice place you have here,<eos> Mrs. poe.<eos> - I know what you're thinkin'.
- You take care of him, all right, preacher?<eos> - Oh, don't you worry about that one little bit, marshal.<eos> I'll make sure he gets a first-class sendoff.<eos> - I'm talkin' about the boy.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Well, I'm gonna have to raise, boys.<eos> Goddamn, hickok!<eos> - I believe this belongs to you.<eos> - Looks to me like he belongs to the devil now.<eos> - You ordered this piece of horseshit to shoot the sodbuster.
It ain't right that a grown boy can't horse around without risking a bullet.<eos> - And you're gonna tell me how to keep that from happenin'?<eos> "The carrying of firearms within city limits<eos> "is strictly prohibited."<eos> - No guns at all.<eos> You leave 'em at camp, or ya check 'em into the marshal's office on the way into town.<eos> - You sure about this, son?<eos> Some folks ain't gonna be too happy about this.<eos> - Yeah, well, they'll just have to live with it.<eos> - Boss, you know boys can't belly up to the bar if they're cuffed hand and foot to the marshal's desk.
- You know, you might almost be as fast as me.<eos> Ben, pour Arkansas a drink on me.<eos> Rest of you, keep givin' your guns to the bartender.<eos> Sully will pick 'em up later.<eos> - Can I do somethin' for you?<eos> - Yeah, mayor, you can do somethin' about that young marshal of yours.<eos> Boy's runnin' all of my customers out of town.<eos> - Now, listen to me, you son of a bitch.<eos> Ain't no one stopping' them boys from drinkin' the swill you call whiskey.<eos> - Now, you listen to me.

How was yours?<eos> - It was good.<eos> - I see ya found 'em.<eos> The pearls.<eos> - Oh, uh, I must've taken 'em off when I was cleanin'.<eos> - Well, you should be more careful.<eos> Allow me.<eos> There, back where they belong.<eos> Now what are you so excited about, son?<eos> - You should've seen him!
Do me a favor.<eos> Tell 'em not to be like you.<eos> - I'll walk you home.<eos> Why?<eos> Who are you tryin' to protect?<eos> Me or poe?<eos> You stay down.<eos> Goddammit.<eos> - Give me two.<eos> - Mr. hardin, you're pretty fast with a gun.

- These drovers, all from the south,<eos> Texas mostly, and they don't much cotton to yankee lawmen.<eos> I'm just sayin' if somethin' was to happen to wild Bill, we'd need a new marshal.<eos> - You want me to kill wild Bill for nothin'?<eos> - You never get somethin' for nothin'.<eos> No, there's a reward,<eos> $500 reward.<eos> - Isn't that ironic.<eos> A bounty on a lawman.<eos> - You in?

- What you lack in sense, you certainly make up for in gumption.<eos> Don't you know anythin'?<eos> I invented the road agent's spin.<eos> - I didn't know you were that old, marshal.<eos> - Well, it's a funny thing.<eos> Older I get, the more I learn.<eos> - Well, if you'd like to keep learning', I'd holster that pistol of yours.<eos> - Notice my hammer tied back?<eos> If something should happen to cause my thumb to slip, you will catch a bullet right between your eyes.<eos> - Well, I can't see what good it's gonna do me to surrender my guns, if you're just gonna go ahead and shoot me in the back the second I turn and walk away.

- I understand your problem.<eos> I do.<eos> It's just I ain't ready to leave town yet, and I sure as hell ain't taking' these guns off.<eos> - You remind me of someone.<eos> - Well, he sounds handsome, who?<eos> - It's not important.<eos> The point is, you got potential.<eos> You just might do.<eos> - Do what?<eos> You want me to be a lawman?
- I usually take a different route on these patrols, keep the bushwhackers guessing'.<eos> - Why the shotgun?<eos> Seems to me a rifle would be a little more accurate.<eos> - Well, this here's what i call preventative medicine.<eos> Sawed-off filled with blue whistles is a mighty fine deterrent.<eos> - Well, I've never had to shoot twice at the same man.<eos> - There's somethin' you gotta learn about gunfightin'.<eos> - Oh, yeah, what's that?<eos> - No matter how fast you are, there's always someone faster.<eos> The more you use your gun, the sooner you're gonna run into that man.
Keep your eyes skinned.<eos> The lawman has no friends and few sympathizers.<eos> A momentary benevolence can prove fatal.<eos> I don't intend to die of an excess of benevolence.<eos> - Well, I don't think you got--<eos> - you see him?<eos> - See him, I got him.<eos> You can't see him?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I can see him.<eos> - You know this dandy here?

- I want you to stay away from wild Bill.<eos> You are not to see or speak to that man again.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> - Whenever I look into a light of any kind, it's edged with halos, bright as January sun dogs.<eos> - Well, ya have a film over your eyes,<eos> and it'll be all right for a while, but in five years.<eos> - In five years what?<eos> - Total blindness.<eos> I can't help you, but you can help yourself.

What am I gonna do?<eos> - You cannot ignore this, Bill.

- Tickets, please. - Come with us, Bill.<eos> - You know I can't.<eos> I have to finish this, Mattie.<eos> I've been runnin' my entire life.<eos> - You're still runnin'.<eos> It's time for you to hang up your guns.<eos> If you stay, we can't wait for you.<eos> - I'll wait for you, wild Bill.<eos> - You do as your mother says, boy.<eos> - I know why you're goin' back.

- You ain't gonna try to stop me, are ya?<eos> Reckon you'll want this.<eos> - Poe!<eos> - Wouldn't shoot me in the back, would ya, hickok?<eos> Guess not.<eos> $500 to the man that kills wild Bill.<eos> - I'll show you wild, hickok.<eos> Wild Bill, my ass!<eos> I'll show ya wild!<eos> You're not so wild, hickok!
It's succeeding.<eos> Very, very slowly.<eos> Explains the distress call, I guess.<eos> So, a 400 mile ship, reversing away from the gravitational pull of a black hole.<eos> Are we having fun yet?<eos> Hello?<eos> Who's there, hello?<eos> Please report status.<eos> Oh, hello, what have we got here? !<eos> You're probably handsome, aren't you?

Also, it's his real name.<eos> It's what?<eos> Look at the screens!<eos> Slow today, Missy.<eos> All those screens have been angled to a single viewpoint.<eos> But not originally, they've all been moved.<eos> Which means?<eos> Giant ship, single pilot, but not designed that way, something's happened to the others.<eos> Yes.<eos> And now it's time for you to figure out what.

Which of you is human?<eos> Me.<eos> Me.<eos> I'm human.<eos> I'm the only one, just... just me.<eos> Please stop this!<eos> Stop right there, now!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But you're the reason that they're coming.
I'm the only one, just... just me.<eos> Please stop this!<eos> Stop right there, now!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But you're the reason that they're coming.<eos> - Put it down<eos> - Put that down now!<eos> They won't come if she's dead.<eos> You don't need to do this.
Look at me.<eos> Go on, look at me.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's very, very good.<eos> Now, do you see this mad woman sitting in this chair?<eos> Her name isn't Doctor Who.<eos> My name is Doctor Who.<eos> It's not, is it?<eos> I like it.<eos> You don't know it yet, but in a short time, you will trust me with your life.

Why?<eos> Because it had a mummy and a daddy.<eos> Go tell a pig about your moral high ground.<eos> I pick a scenario, we drop her down into it, and we see how she does.<eos> How does that work?<eos> We just take the TARDIS for a spin and we graze for distress calls.<eos> We pick a good one.<eos> Our usual Saturday.<eos> And what if she just walks out and slaughters everyone just for a laugh?<eos> Well, I will be monitoring you the whole time.

- Me?<eos> - Yes, you and Nardole.<eos> You can be her companions.<eos> Oh, nah!<eos> Forget it.<eos> Absolutely no way.<eos> Nardole agreed.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You did in my head, which is good enough for me.<eos> Why do you want to do this?
Oh, nah!<eos> Forget it.<eos> Absolutely no way.<eos> Nardole agreed.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You did in my head, which is good enough for me.<eos> Why do you want to do this?<eos> She's my friend.<eos> She's my oldest friend in the universe.<eos> You've got lots of friends.
Why do you want to do this?<eos> She's my friend.<eos> She's my oldest friend in the universe.<eos> You've got lots of friends.<eos> Better ones.<eos> What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
She's my oldest friend in the universe.<eos> You've got lots of friends.<eos> Better ones.<eos> What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> She's the only person that I've ever met who's even remotely like me.<eos> So, more than anything, you want her to be good?
So, Time Lords, bit flexible on the whole man/woman thing, then, yeah?<eos> We are the most civilized civilization in the universe, we're billions of years beyond your petty human obsession with gender and its associated stereotypes.<eos> But you still call yourselves Time Lords?<eos> Yeah, shut up.<eos> Okay.<eos> We had a pact, me and him.<eos> Every star in the universe, we were going to see them all.<eos> But he was too busy burning them.<eos> I don't think she ever saw anything.<eos> And you think that if she did, she'd change?
Yeah, shut up.<eos> Okay.<eos> We had a pact, me and him.<eos> Every star in the universe, we were going to see them all.<eos> But he was too busy burning them.<eos> I don't think she ever saw anything.<eos> And you think that if she did, she'd change?<eos> I know she would.<eos> I know it.<eos> You're a bloody idiot.
Course.<eos> She scares me.<eos> Like, she really scares me.<eos> Okay.<eos> So promise me one thing, yeah?<eos> Promise you won't get me killed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't promise you that.<eos> Thanks!<eos> I mean, look, you're human, and humans are so mortal.
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't promise you that.<eos> Thanks!<eos> I mean, look, you're human, and humans are so mortal.<eos> Cheers!<eos> I mean, you pop like balloons.<eos> I mean, one heart.<eos> It's your most important organ, and you've no back up.<eos> It's like a budget cut.<eos> You'll try and keep me alive?
Repaired.<eos> - Repaired?<eos> - Stand.<eos> Away.<eos> You can help her?<eos> Is that what you mean?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> What are you going to do with her?<eos> - Re-pair.<eos> - Don't try and stop them. They'll snap you in half.
- Always!<eos> Sir, step away from those doors.<eos> You'll bring them back!<eos> What do you care, Smurf?<eos> They're not even interested in you.<eos> Sir, I swear to you, step away from that lift or I will kill you!<eos> Don't, you will only make me angry.<eos> - Honey, listen to him.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because if somebody kills you and it's not me, we'll both be disappointed.
- Well, obviously you were boarded.<eos> - No.<eos> Your ship was taken over, it happens.<eos> - No.<eos> - Doctor?<eos> This is worse than I thought.<eos> Much worse!<eos> 50 of you taking your brand-new ship, fresh from the factory, to pick up some colonists?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Two days ago, you almost bump into a black hole.
Nothing comes out of a black hole.<eos> Nothing boarded this ship.<eos> I'm afraid you'll never see your crew again.<eos> Black hole. 400 mile spaceship.<eos> It's a matter of time!<eos> Pay attention.<eos> Hello?<eos> Back with us?<eos> No, don't try to speak, just relax.<eos> You'll be fine.
This way, Mr Razor, look sharp!<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> This way, this way.<eos> What about him?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> They don't feel pain.<eos> - I think they do.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> So, why did you say they don't?<eos> It was a clever lie, but you see straight through me.
So, why did you say they don't?<eos> It was a clever lie, but you see straight through me.<eos> Come, tea, this way.<eos> What are those things?<eos> People, people, people, people, they're people.<eos> What are you doing to them?<eos> Curing them.<eos> Come.<eos> In here.<eos> Do you want the good tea or the bad tea?
Er, I'll take the good one.<eos> Excellent, positive attitude.<eos> Will help with the horror to come.<eos> What horror?<eos> Mainly the tea.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Hospital.<eos> Yeah, but where?<eos> The ship.<eos> You are on the ship.

Hospital.<eos> Yeah, but where?<eos> The ship.<eos> You are on the ship.<eos> I was on a ship, yeah, but it wasn't like this.<eos> You were at top of the ship and now you are at bottom.<eos> Ship, top, bottom, see?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did I get here?<eos> You were sick, very sick.
Yes.<eos> How did I get here?<eos> You were sick, very sick.<eos> - Broken.<eos> Heart broken<eos> - New heart.<eos> Good, is it?<eos> I... haven't dared look yet.<eos> Is good, is very good.<eos> Shiny. You can carry it off.
You were sick, very sick.<eos> - Broken.<eos> Heart broken<eos> - New heart.<eos> Good, is it?<eos> I... haven't dared look yet.<eos> Is good, is very good.<eos> Shiny. You can carry it off.<eos> Not everybody can.<eos> For some people, it all goes a bit, you know...
For some people, it all goes a bit, you know...<eos> What?<eos> Vending machine.<eos> - Drink it while it is very hot. - The pain will disguise the taste.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> Oh, weeks. Many weeks.<eos> Maybe months.<eos> God.<eos> Is good you get strong.
- Yeah, but... the picture, it's frozen.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, it is, they're not moving. Look at them.<eos> They are at top of ship.<eos> Top of ship very slow.<eos> We are at bottom.<eos> Bottom much faster.<eos> Very fast bottom.<eos> Yeah, I don't understand.<eos> So you don't know?
What are you doing in here?<eos> She works for me now we agreed.<eos> Everyone here works for me!<eos> There's a floor out there, needs cleaning.<eos> Running all the way!<eos> I know you dream of leaving.<eos> No, me? Never.<eos> This is your heart now.<eos> Outside this hospital, it will stop working.<eos> It's a good thing you've got all those locks, then, in case I accidentally wander off.
How much longer, Doctor?<eos> How many more years?<eos> - But what about these life-forms?<eos> - What are they?<eos> Where did they come from?<eos> How can there be so many?<eos> Those are the descendants of your crew-mates.<eos> - Two days for you, generations for them. - What are these... - Look.<eos> What kind of treatment is that?<eos> Why won't you ever explain?
And the exodus will begin.<eos> Exodus?<eos> Operation Exodus.<eos> We will leave this city, we will climb up through this ship, and we will take command.<eos> Well, you could just go up right now.<eos> We have to be strong.<eos> There are lifts.<eos> There are many dangers.<eos> I've been up there, there's a friend of mine, he could help.<eos> You do not understand the dangers.
Many years ago, there was an expedition to floor 507, the largest of the solar farms.<eos> And?<eos> Silence.<eos> They never came back.<eos> There is something up there.<eos> And we must be strong.<eos> Return to the hospital.<eos> - I don't...<eos> - You see, my dear.<eos> You must be strong to leave the hospital.
And?<eos> Silence.<eos> They never came back.<eos> There is something up there.<eos> And we must be strong.<eos> Return to the hospital.<eos> - I don't...<eos> - You see, my dear.<eos> You must be strong to leave the hospital.<eos> And you will be soon.
- I thought you needed four arms for Venusian?<eos> I've got hidden talents, as well as hidden arms.<eos> But it's been ten minutes,<eos> - so she must have been down there for years. - Yeah.<eos> We can take the TARDIS, go back and get it right.<eos> This close to a black hole, we'll never be able to pilot her accurately.<eos> Do you think they're coming down here?<eos> Because if they are, where does that lift arrive?<eos> Just asking.<eos> You are dear to me.

Just asking.<eos> You are dear to me.<eos> You are my dearest person.<eos> - You are like...<eos> - I know.<eos> A mother to me.<eos> Definitely not a mother.<eos> Or an aunt.<eos> No.<eos> But this question you must not ask.
No.<eos> But this question you must not ask.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because if you do, I think I might tell you.<eos> Ah, sorry, mate.<eos> Guess what I'm about to do.<eos> Do not.<eos> Do not do this.<eos> I'm going to ask you again.<eos> When you hug me... it hurts my heart.
It's just, you know... work in progress.<eos> So, these lifts, where do we find them?<eos> It's through there somewhere.<eos> Oh, I like the hat!<eos> I'm going to ask for a hat when it's my turn.<eos> Your turn?<eos> No, actually.<eos> I'm afraid, Miss Potts, it's your turn.<eos> Thank you for bringing her, Mr Razor.<eos> Ah, you see through my clever disguise.

Ah, you see through my clever disguise.<eos> Stupid thing. You didn't.<eos> Please, tell me you didn't.<eos> Is for your own good, make you strong.<eos> Ready for the exodus.<eos> I'm sorry about the deception, it's best to get people in here without them knowing why.<eos> We don't want screaming in the main part of the hospital.<eos> Don't you touch me!<eos> Don't you lay a finger on me!<eos> This unit of yours won't last forever you know, you need the full upgrade.

Look at them.
You're not going to turn me into one of those things.<eos> I'm rebuilding you to survive in a world not made for flesh. Look at them.<eos> They're screaming in pain, every second they're alive.<eos> But we've got something for that now.<eos> This won't stop you feeling pain, but... it will stop you caring about it.<eos> It fits over your head.<eos> Okay, you two, welcome to a new time zone.<eos> Not knowing the differential, I don't know how much time has passed here.<eos> - Right, we need to find out more about this ship.<eos> No, Missy, you do it.
- Anyway...<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - Nardole!<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, ordinary person.<eos> Please maintain a minimum separation of three feet.<eos> I'm really trying not to kill anyone today, but it would be tremendously helpful if your major arteries were out of reach.<eos> I have been so looking forward to meeting you.<eos> Right, I'm very happy for you.<eos> I was watching you on the screen, it took me a while to work out who you were.

If planets had twins...<eos> You don't remember being here before, do you?

You really can trust me on that.
- "Doctor!<eos> Oh, Doctor!<eos> Doctor!"<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> I may be about to take that silly little gun away from you...<eos> He'll never forgive you, you know, he'll never set you free.<eos> Not when he discovers what you did to his little friend.<eos> I haven't done anything to his silly little friend.<eos> Oh, but I'm afraid you did... a long time ago.<eos> You're brand-new.

We mean you no harm. We're just passing through.<eos> We're looking for Bill Potts, friend of mine.<eos> Bill Potts.<eos> Yes, Bill Potts.<eos> You're a Cyberman, you're part of a neural net... can you find her?

What have they done to you?<eos> It's Operation Exodus, whatever that is.<eos> Oh, wrong name for a start.<eos> I... waited.<eos> This is not an exodus, is it?<eos> More of a beginning, really, isn't it?<eos> I waited.<eos> In fact, do you know what I'd call it?<eos> I'd call it a genesis.<eos> You've met the ex?
This is not an exodus, is it?<eos> More of a beginning, really, isn't it?<eos> I waited.<eos> In fact, do you know what I'd call it?<eos> I'd call it a genesis.<eos> You've met the ex?<eos> Specifically, the Genesis of the Cybermen.<eos> I waited for you.<eos> The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.<eos> What do you think?

- Dewey!<eos> Ah, ha ah! I'll put the marbles back, I swear!<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Ma Beagle?<eos> Glomgold?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Uncle Scrooge!<eos> Uncle Scrooge?<eos> Oh, my gosh, the nephews!<eos> Wait, you know us?
What in dismal downs is going on in here?<eos> There it is.<eos> Why aren't you in your rooms?<eos> We've got this.<eos> There are four of us and three of them.<eos> If we... wait, never mind.<eos> They teamed up.<eos> Ah, good, that means only one target.<eos> No, get back!<eos> You're old!
You locked us in a room!<eos> I gave you marbles!<eos> All we wanted was to hand out with you!<eos> Well, now you have, and look at the mess it's got me!<eos> I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?<eos> Everybody out!<eos> - But we're...<eos> - Out!<eos> Well, what are you gaping at?<eos> The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
And no one tell your uncle Donald!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Who is that?<eos> You've got the job, Duck!<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> I'm a real accountant!<eos> Accountant?<eos> That was filled yesterday.<eos> You're our new sailor!
-I don't think so.<eos> She's sweet, but she's kind of got a dark sense of humor, dry.<eos> You've got to give me something to work with.<eos> I'm looking at my kit. I've got walnut, coconut cream. I've got some cherry cordials.<eos> Well, she's very cordial.<eos> You know, why don't we do this? Let's just do 12 plains.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> When you present this to her, there's different ways you can do it.<eos> You could do sort of 1920s, like, sort of little boy, like... [high-pitched gibberish]<eos> You know, just make it seem bigger than you.
Yeah, well, he has a little too much time on his hands since, uh, the divorce.<eos> You've built an incredible business here.<eos> We're fortunate.<eos> KTS is highly profitable.<eos> We could be in Century City or Beverly Hills, but it's important we stay in the community.<eos> I agree.<eos> Why's it important to you?<eos> I hire strong, successful, good people.<eos> The types of men and women that the youth in the neighborhood need to see, need to meet.<eos> Mm-hmm. Men like you, Sam.
He's with us. All right.<eos> Irvin, throw the gun away.<eos> This man is not worth it.<eos> Yeah, but doing him would be worth it to me.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Brother!<eos> Look around you.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> Look at these kids.<eos> Showing these people what's right, being an example, that's who you are.
Revelation 14:13.<eos> "And I heard a voice<eos> "from heaven say unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth."<eos> "Yea, saith the Spirit,<eos> "that they may rest from their labours;<eos> "and that their works do follow them."<eos> - You know your scripture.<eos> - Nice.<eos> He did his homework.<eos> But have you submitted to God's righteousness?
That's why they'll change it.<eos> You two have been fighting this war your entire lives.<eos> Now you're so entrenched, you can't even see that there's something better waiting on the other side of the conflict.<eos> But your children can see it.<eos> They just need your help to make it real.<eos> Mamá, don't give up on us.<eos> Please, Papá.<eos> All right, mijo.<eos> We'll try.<eos> Ma'am, you done did a terrible thing to me.
Are you ready to be baptized and reborn?<eos> I am.<eos> "I indeed baptize you with water<eos> "unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier<eos> "than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:<eos> "he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,<eos> - and with fire."<eos> - They're not letting him up.<eos> Let him go!<eos> You're...
"than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:<eos> "he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,<eos> - and with fire."<eos> - They're not letting him up.<eos> Let him go!<eos> You're...<eos> That's how they prove their loyalty.<eos> Being willing to die.<eos> Praise God, Samuel.<eos> You are risen!
Dabir Fakoury's an ISIS leader.<eos> Did he ever cross paths with Hizb Al-Shahid during your time with Black Dog Station?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> So you're tracking a connection between HS and ISIS?<eos> What about Yunis Hamawi?<eos> Also ISIS.<eos> Did his name ever come up?<eos> You guys want to tell me what this is about?<eos> I might actually be able to help.<eos> So you never found any concrete connection between HS and ISIS other than a shared ideology.
A shared ideology would make them much more dangerous, and, again, do you want to let me in on that?<eos> We're not authorized to do so,<eos> - Dr. McCord.<eos> - Excuse me, you're aware of my involvement in both operations that effectively dismantled HS, and yet you're telling me that my clearance isn't high enough to be filled in?<eos> That's what we're telling you.<eos> I think we've gotten everything we need.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> I'm heading back in the office now, Blake.<eos> Well, I'm still at the Port of Baltimore.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I am unable to bring the gift home today because they won't release it from customs until it undergoes a three-day quarantine.
Well, that didn't take long.<eos> So, Blake's still out?<eos> He's been further detained.<eos> Yeah, he ran into some protesters from the Equine Resource League in a parking lot at the Port of Baltimore.<eos> They pelted him and his car with manure.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's, rattled.<eos> What are they protesting anyway?<eos> Somebody sent me a horse?<eos> No, ma'am, that you're sending her back to Mongolia where she'll be euthanized.
Stop.<eos> What?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Inspiration.<eos> Mr. Hobbs, I-I don't think I can park here. Mr...<eos> Governor, we understand the symbolic gesture of filing suit against the state for overriding its sore-loser law and allowing us on the ballot.<eos> I can't imagine you expected the Sixth Circuit to hear the case, and... now we find ourselves in an awkward situation.

You're wasting your time.<eos> ERL is under no obligation to reveal the source of our information.<eos> Does it concern you at all that any leak in the state department could be a matter of national security?<eos> That's your problem.<eos> I have the Freedom of Information Act on my side.<eos> Did you get the information directly from Minister Sendoo?<eos> Otherwise, there's no other explanation why it was on your Web site so fast.<eos> The foreign minister and I had no direct communication.<eos> It's the minister of education.<eos> Do you even read your own illegally obtained information?

Look, I know they can come on pretty strong, but they're probably just embarrassed and intimidated by you.<eos> So, because of their fragile psyches, I'm supposed to help them burn up the Bill of Rights?<eos> It's one thing to defend the Fourth Amendment, it's another thing to develop technology so impenetrable that it locks out the state's ability to investigate with probable cause.<eos> Giving the NSA access to a private customer phone would set a terrible legal precedent.<eos> Maybe you need to practice some of the tenets. Taoism has taught you, and let go of your longing.<eos> The world's religions aren't the only thing I've learned from.<eos> In the intelligence community, there's a method for developing assets called "MIC"...<eos> M.I.C.<eos> First you try to persuade with money... that's the "M."<eos> You have plenty of that.
You have plenty of that.<eos> "I" is for ideology.<eos> I tried to appeal to that, and I failed.<eos> And the "C" is for coercion, but as an ally of Dalton's... not a lot to coerce you with.<eos> So it seems... that you have run out of letters.<eos> Yes.<eos> All I can do now is humble myself and appeal to you as someone who cares deeply about the welfare of this country.<eos> So few of us find ourselves in your position.<eos> You have the U.S. government groveling at your feet for a small piece of proprietary information.<eos> You're the only person who can help us.
I overheard her conversation on the phone with you.<eos> I don't know why people think alcohol affects auditory nerves.<eos> Please have a drink and, explain the futility of verse to me.<eos> I don't think it's futile.<eos> Sometimes it can be ever so slightly... indulgent.<eos> Unnecessarily convoluted and redundant.<eos> Also pretentious, arrogant, and not essential to the evolution of mankind.<eos> Otherwise a perfectly harmless pursuit.<eos> Should we go?<eos> With what do you occupy your superior gray matter?
Also pretentious, arrogant, and not essential to the evolution of mankind.<eos> Otherwise a perfectly harmless pursuit.<eos> Should we go?<eos> With what do you occupy your superior gray matter?<eos> I'm a physicist.<eos> Ha! Bravo.<eos> The geniuses who brought us nuclear weapons, space junk and global warming.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - What a charming oversimplification.<eos> Tell me something, how do you live with such an unimaginative reductionist view of the world?
Tell me something, how do you live with such an unimaginative reductionist view of the world?<eos> How is life, without the resonance of beauty, even worth the effort?<eos> Let me tell you a little something about beauty,<eos> Mr. Hobbs.<eos> You seem to think I can't appreciate beauty because I study the intricacies of its components.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't we just go?<eos> Bartender?<eos> It was Richard Feynman, physicist, personal hero of mine, who put it best.<eos> He said that he could appreciate the beauty of a flower more than, say, you.
"as modest stillness<eos> "and humility.<eos> "But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the actions of the tiger."<eos> Henry V.<eos> We, got our hands on some oppo research that could have influenced the narrative of the election, and the president decided not to use it.<eos> He still feels that way.<eos> Even I had a moment on the high road, but it turns out, it's not really my thing.<eos> 'Cause I can't stand seeing good people being hurt because of unbridled greed and ambition.<eos> So I want you to think about this, Governor.<eos> Imagine if you held the country up in an elaborate legal proceeding, rattled their faith in the system, even got yourself in office, only for the voting public to discover that you withheld information pertinent to your competency to be president of the United States.
I didn't go private for a paycheck.<eos> Just couldn't remember why I signed up anymore.<eos> So now you want to go to an Iraqi prison because some dumb-ass on your team got trigger-happy?<eos> Good game.<eos> B.<eos> Don't talk to that suit until you get your head right.<eos> Damn.<eos> Do you ever miss?<eos> Nope.<eos> You're Eric Broussard?
Don't talk to that suit until you get your head right.<eos> Damn.<eos> Do you ever miss?<eos> Nope.<eos> You're Eric Broussard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm here for your incident report.<eos> Sign here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your sworn affidavit that you and your men fired in self-defense.
You haven't called me.<eos> I'm trying not to take it personally.<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> Are you telling me that despite the shocking massacre that just occurred in this bloc, you have nothing to report?<eos> It's all just noise.<eos> I didn't want to bother you.<eos> Tell me about Nolan Burgess.<eos> The Deputy Proxy.<eos> You know, a man can only play dumb so many times before everyone starts to believe it.<eos> You just oversaw a security failure of biblical proportions.
Our little bumblebee tracked her all the way home.<eos> - A theater?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Not a bad place for a hideout.<eos> Lots of entrances and exits.<eos> Good job.<eos> I got to tell you, there's a lot of people coming in and out of here.<eos> How many?<eos> Like, a lot.<eos> You're back.
- Yeah.<eos> Not a bad place for a hideout.<eos> Lots of entrances and exits.<eos> Good job.<eos> I got to tell you, there's a lot of people coming in and out of here.<eos> How many?<eos> Like, a lot.<eos> You're back.<eos> I need you to find the Bowman sister, the one who was banging Nolan Burgess.<eos> You know where she is.
How many?<eos> Like, a lot.<eos> You're back.<eos> I need you to find the Bowman sister, the one who was banging Nolan Burgess.<eos> You know where she is.<eos> This is no way to treat a lady.<eos> Unbind her immediately.<eos> Miss Kenner, I'm so glad I found you.<eos> I'm horrified at the outrageous way that you've been treated.<eos> - You can help me?
I signed a confession.<eos> This confession?<eos> Seems like a whole lot of nonsense to me.<eos> How could an upstanding woman like yourself be solely responsible for these kinds of crimes?<eos> They said I had to sign it... to keep my son safe.<eos> They don't have the power to keep your son safe, but I do.<eos> I can see why you were attracted to Nolan.<eos> He's smart, handsome, but he has the wrong kind of ambition.<eos> And it's going to destroy him... and maybe even the whole bloc, unless he's stopped.<eos> And you're different?
To accuse Gerald of killing her, the love of his life, doesn't fit the evidence.<eos> Simply not true.<eos> It's nice to see you, Gerald.<eos> Not sure I can say the same.<eos> I wanted to let you know we're taking another look at your case.<eos> I've already exhausted all my appeals.<eos> Which were all based on ineffective assistance of counsel.<eos> I know.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> As soon as that guilty verdict came down, you bolted.
Did Gerald invite you over?<eos> No, I had followed him home once.<eos> I wanted to see where he lived.<eos> Well, you're not too big on boundaries, huh, Paul?<eos> I was in a dark place back then.<eos> I was closeted, depressed.<eos> Being gay in the military during "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" will do that to you.<eos> So, one day, when I passed by, I just knocked on the door.<eos> Claire answered.<eos> Did she know who you were?
Bodie Whitman.<eos> I remember that name.<eos> He spent ten years in a federal prison for his part in an armed robbery.<eos> Was one of Gibb's last undercover cases.<eos> It's before my time.<eos> It was... 2001.<eos> Whitman was a foot soldier in a militant antigovernment militia led by his older brother.<eos> Gibbs infiltrated the group using his backstopped alias,<eos> Leland Robert Spears.<eos> So, you and Torres are right.
Gibbs is with Bodie Whitman on the I-95, halfway between here and Baltimore.<eos> According to Bodie's driver's license, that's where he lives.<eos> It was the summer of '96, and we were running surveillance on a chop shop... just me and a couple of hotshot young agents named Gibbs and Vance.<eos> That's Director Vance.<eos> And if I remember, those two hotshots bailed your ass out of one hell of a firefight that night.<eos> Is that the story you've been telling all these years, Leon?<eos> Come here!<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> You, too, Fred.<eos> Well, we both know you didn't pull me off the back nine at National to reminisce, so...
why the hell am I here?<eos> An old case of yours has resurfaced.<eos> Which one?<eos> My undercover I.D.<eos> Damn, I was hoping it wasn't that one.<eos> You remember Deputy Director Doyle Roden of the Department of Energy.<eos> Special Agent Pettis.<eos> Doyle.<eos> Where's Gibbs?<eos> You mean Spears.
It's NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> How'd he explain the tats to his wife?<eos> He said that she knew that he had a past, riding with bikers.<eos> The warrant paid off.<eos> Deputy Director Roden got a call from Ramsay's burn phone yesterday.<eos> Text Gibbs.<eos> I'm willing to tell you anything you want to know.<eos> But I need you to promise me something.<eos> No deals.<eos> You killed two Marines.
About what?<eos> Well, Maya didn't want to talk about it.<eos> I should've asked more questions.<eos> I should've done a lot of things.<eos> Um, we have to process your home for evidence tonight.<eos> Do you have someplace to stay?<eos> Mr. Kettering, do you have someplace to sleep tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for letting me do the cervical artery dissection today, Doctor.<eos> You earned it, Doctor.
Taj, this is an active crime scene.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Bro, I'm a Voltrane alarm technician.<eos> All right?<eos> I was called here to remove the unit.<eos> Who called you?<eos> I did.<eos> Walt?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Same thing you are.
My motel's not very far.<eos> Look, I'm not really in the mood for talking, so...<eos> Yeah, that's fine by me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is the investigation over?<eos> Did you arrest Maya's killer?<eos> No.<eos> No, but we know who it is.<eos> Who?<eos> You.
Is the investigation over?<eos> Did you arrest Maya's killer?<eos> No.<eos> No, but we know who it is.<eos> Who?<eos> You.<eos> Is that some kind of joke?<eos> No.<eos> No joke;<eos> Wow. You must really... hate me.
Did you arrest Maya's killer?<eos> No.<eos> No, but we know who it is.<eos> Who?<eos> You.<eos> Is that some kind of joke?<eos> No.<eos> No joke;<eos> Wow. You must really... hate me.<eos> 'Cause I was on a plane when Maya was killed, and you know that.
No joke;<eos> Wow. You must really... hate me.<eos> 'Cause I was on a plane when Maya was killed, and you know that.<eos> Don't know anything yet.<eos> So I get my keys?<eos> No cuffs?<eos> You'll get those, too, as soon as we figure out how you managed to be two places at once.<eos> Well, good luck with that, because it didn't happen.<eos> You know what did happen?<eos> I think you got Darlene pregnant.

Maya was a good Catholic, and she wanted to work things out.<eos> But you didn't have that kind of time, so you went to plan B. Go to hell.
The same hat, the same duffel, the same guy... 2,500 miles away.<eos> They on the same flights?<eos> We checked.<eos> They switched places.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So, who is he?<eos> Your alibi.<eos> Story time, Kettering.<eos> Listen up. You found a stranger... That guy... who's about your height and weight, you paid cash for his ticket from San Francisco to D.C., same day and time as your flight.<eos> Only difference is his flight was nonstop, while you had a layover in Chicago.

In 1995, in Japan, a cult spent millions on a facility.<eos> You mind if I join you, Dr. Ducky?<eos> By all means, Agent Reeves.<eos> Yeah, I was just explaining to our friend here that despite the claims of certain foreign powers, liquid sarin cannot be made in the kitchen.<eos> Abby says mere drops can be deadly.<eos> Yeah, the liquid evaporates when it's exposed to the air.<eos> Direct inhalation can cause a buildup of acetylcholine in the nervous system.<eos> The body can shut down, in under a minute.<eos> Nasty business.<eos> Yeah. Do you come from Brumarket?
Never heard of him.<eos> Well, that's why it didn't flag.<eos> But we found out it was a cover name.<eos> Somebody famous?<eos> The security records don't say, but they do say the guards were armed.<eos> Which means I can pull conceal-and-carry permits, and find out who they were really working for.<eos> Jovan Dezic,<eos> Bosnian foreign affairs minister.<eos> He was at the concert with his 16-year-old son.<eos> And you knew that because he had to register his travel plans with Homeland.
Dezic was part of the Bosnian-Serb army during the genocide.<eos> Ever heard of "Sniper Alley," Gibbs?<eos> Sarajevo.<eos> Civilians murdered in cold blood.<eos> Including your parents.<eos> Dezic was suspected of being there, though it was never proven.<eos> This was revenge.<eos> You altered the report before you gave it to Earl.<eos> And you took his security clearance to steal the sarin.<eos> And it was you who switched the bomb and the balloons.
Qasim, these conversations you've been listening to, they're about a terrorist we've been tracking for months.<eos> Bishop, get your mind off revenge.<eos> You need to stay out of it.<eos> If Gibbs finds out you're working on this, and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.<eos> I'm willing to take that chance.<eos> Commander Turner.<eos> Aren't you going to say hello?<eos> Who is this?<eos> I think you know who it is.<eos> You let us down, Commander Turner.
We missed him.<eos> Or not.<eos> Freeze!<eos> NCIS!<eos> Hi, Gibbs.<eos> Bishop.<eos> How's that water leak coming?<eos> Agent Bishop, you were specifically told to stay away from the Chen case.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> And you, Officer Reeves, I don't know where to start, but it'll probably be with us reevaluating your relationship here.
From your compound.<eos> I don't have a clue what you're talking about.<eos> So you're clueless.<eos> No, I'm a carpet salesman.<eos> With enough emergency supplies for World War III.<eos> No, just enough to survive.<eos> What, a zombie apocalypse?<eos> The end of the world, man.<eos> It's coming sooner than you think.<eos> Oh, you're one of those.
Delilah's whole life is on that hard drive.<eos> - If she finds out it's missing...<eos> - What? You didn't tell her about Rosebud?<eos> Why would I if there's still a chance I could get it back?<eos> Yet another lie.<eos> Not a lie... omission.<eos> Yeah, Duck, I'm on my way.<eos> To me, honesty is all about the three yous.<eos> "The three yous," Doctor?<eos> Yeah, well, there's the you that the world knows, there's the you that your friends and family know, and there's the you that only you know.

Well, don't look at me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Been here too long.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> So what happened?<eos> He broke into your old apartment yesterday.<eos> He was looking for something specific.<eos> And I... the current occupant shot him.<eos> Wait, wait, no, I'm sorry.<eos> You?
Handy?<eos> That's a great word for it. Yeah.<eos> Crown moldings, all the little details, that's all me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a great neighborhood, too.<eos> I would still be living there if not for that crazy night.<eos> That crazy night you carved up all your friends in my living room?<eos> Beaver.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You'd look great in beaver.
Yeah.<eos> It's a great neighborhood, too.<eos> I would still be living there if not for that crazy night.<eos> That crazy night you carved up all your friends in my living room?<eos> Beaver.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You'd look great in beaver.<eos> You know, I had a beaver bomber jacket on my old showroom floor.<eos> You'd love it.<eos> And you.
What could he have been looking for?<eos> Tip? How would I know? Listen, we talked about cooking, sports.<eos> I mean, I certainly never let him know where I lived.<eos> Well, he tore up the walls and floors for some reason.<eos> No, not my hardwoods.<eos> I put those in, too.<eos> What did you put under them? Nothing.<eos> Oh.<eos> Mm... mm... nothing.<eos> Okay, so you're saying that Louis came and burglarized your old apartment and you have no idea...?
If your agency solves the Pretoria Heist, you're a made man.<eos> Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> I remember Pruitt trolling the halls of Congress my first year on the Hill.<eos> He definitely gave off a slippery vibe.<eos> How are you, Jenna?<eos> Hello, Pete.<eos> Congressman Peter Shaw, uh, NCIS Director Leon Vance.<eos> Congressman, it's a pleasure.<eos> Pete, please.<eos> Rock stars like you get to skip all the formalities.
No, why would I do that?<eos> You tell us.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm going to at least need to know that you have some kind of a theory.<eos> How's this?<eos> Pruitt knew about your bogus furrier business and needed a partner to intercept a shipment.<eos> You sent three goons to steal the diamonds, deliver them to Pruitt for safekeeping.<eos> Well, I wish I had popcorn.<eos> You guys are good.<eos> Then you killed Pruitt, but the only reason we can think of is a liar like you had no intention of honoring their partnership to begin with.
Sure.<eos> And was there something else or did you just come here to gloat?<eos> I want to know if there are any, uh, additional surprises I should be expecting.<eos> Any more occupants in the apartment?<eos> Well, if you expect them, they won't be surprises, now, will they?<eos> But... if you must know... what's it worth to you?<eos> I should've known better.<eos> Enjoy your third life sentence.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You're good.
NCIS.<eos> Should have figured with those clothes.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> You know, Nicole Trainer, uh, didn't say you were funny.<eos> How did she describe him again?<eos> As a, uh, "self-serving, arrogant D-bag who only cares about himself""<eos> Oh, yeah, that was it.<eos> Sounds like sour grapes.<eos> Nicole knows I was the best thing that ever happened to her.<eos> She also mentioned that you were the one that gave Petty Officer Collins a black eye.
Forced?<eos> By who?<eos> I don't know, but she was terrified of him.<eos> That's when she lost it on me and threw me out.<eos> I swear, she was alive when I left.<eos> And you didn't think to come to us?<eos> I didn't want Nicole to get into trouble.<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look like you needed it.
Do not do the crime if you cannot do the time.<eos> That's good advice.<eos> Double murder--<eos> You're looking at a mandatory life sentence.<eos> Am I supposed to know what you're talking about?<eos> We're gonna refresh your memory.<eos> Petty Officer Collins.<eos> He clued into your drug operation and confronted you.<eos> You killed him. Made it look like an accident.<eos> And you were the on-site investigator, so it was easy to cover your tracks.

Name is Henry Rogers, former Marine sergeant, Force Recon. The guy's a handful.<eos> Did he, uh, eat something, drink anything?<eos> Let me lay it down for you real simple.<eos> I answered your questions.<eos> Now I'm done.<eos> Sir, we can't release you just yet.<eos> We're looking into the death of a fellow Marine here.<eos> I know that.<eos> The death is looking suspicious.<eos> You're a key witness, Sergeant.
Right.<eos> But, I mean, as far as-as you and Quinn, you, uh... never sang into a microphone while she watched?<eos> Look at this, it says it's allergy medicine.<eos> It doesn't look like that, looks more like pencil shavings.<eos> Yeah, but why would anybody put pencil shavings inside of a pill bottle?<eos> Or why would anyone keep them at all?<eos> So it's true?<eos> You found Maya out here? What'd you do?<eos> Haul her car away to the station already?<eos> Who are you?
I was driving nearby and I thought maybe he'd be here, and you two were just taking the Mick out of me, you know, 'cause you're both Marines and I'm a Brit?<eos> The whole American Revolution thing?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Right.<eos> Damn.<eos> You've got good instincts, Reeves.<eos> Need to use them.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You were with this guy for two days, and you don't know where he is.<eos> What, and you do?
All right, I'll pick it up now.<eos> Help!<eos> I'm being chased!<eos> NCIS federal agent!<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Freeze!<eos> You ready?<eos> For what?<eos> Show-and-tell.<eos> You and Maya lived in the same neighborhood, you worked at the same company, you were friends.
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Freeze!<eos> You ready?<eos> For what?<eos> Show-and-tell.<eos> You and Maya lived in the same neighborhood, you worked at the same company, you were friends.<eos> Is that against the law?<eos> She confided in you, she told you she was gonna blow the whistle.<eos> She also told you that she called the hotline for advice, and that she gave details to the guy that answered.<eos> And you I.D.'d the guy as Corporal Beck.

Is there any classified data on here?<eos> Classified, unclassified.<eos> And when was the last time you backed this up?<eos> Never. I have antivirus software.<eos> Viruses mutate.<eos> Well...<eos> That's why the flu virus circumvents the flu vaccine every year.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Well, you click that, and it sends the virus to people you know.<eos> They pay, you get the decryption key.
We stay here and watch that car leave.<eos> 6:46 this morning.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Blue Camry.<eos> But it's just the driver. Where's the other guy?<eos> Which storage unit did they access?<eos> The cameras are only on the gates.<eos> Buzz, that is not what he's asking.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> See, you get to ask all the questions, Buzz gets to do all the work.
A cold one.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's it.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Answer me, where are my test subjects?<eos> You mean your victims?<eos> They're on our medical examiner's table.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> If you thaw them out, you'll kill them.<eos> You already killed them.
You mean your victims?<eos> They're on our medical examiner's table.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> If you thaw them out, you'll kill them.<eos> You already killed them.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I put them into a state of suspended animation.<eos> And I will bring them back.<eos> Your college roommate, Clint, was shocked when he saw the virus you both created was back online.<eos> You took him to your lab, where you froze him in your ice chamber.
You don't get it.<eos> I put them into a state of suspended animation.<eos> And I will bring them back.<eos> Your college roommate, Clint, was shocked when he saw the virus you both created was back online.<eos> You took him to your lab, where you froze him in your ice chamber.<eos> Cancer patients.<eos> I could put them into a state of hibernation.<eos> And when science has cured cancer, my test subjects can live healthy, productive lives.<eos> They're not test subjects.<eos> Couple of homeless guys, and you froze them while they were still alive.
Hitchhiker give you anything?<eos> Not really.<eos> Apparently, he spotted the body when he was walking past.<eos> All yours, Duck.<eos> Thank you, Timothy.<eos> Come, Dr. Palmer, let's free this young man from the mud.<eos> All right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> There you are, Corporal, your final about-face.
Colin and Jamel got rolled on by a couple of crosstown cowards, and Mickey got silly drunk, and drowned in a pool.<eos> Yeah, well, those are the stories.<eos> But we know the truth.<eos> You trying to bring more charges on me?<eos> 'Cause I'm up for parole in five years.<eos> Then I would start talking.<eos> I might've heard some rumors that someone was rallying the troops, trying to get back in business.<eos> You got a name?<eos> Nope.<eos> And the boys will make damn sure that you don't get one either.

You ever heard the name Jack Haley?<eos> No.<eos> NBA journeyman.<eos> '96 Bulls.<eos> Rode the bench most of his career.<eos> But he was the one person that the team's star forward,<eos> Dennis Rodman, trusted the most, opened up to, often leaned on.<eos> What is your point, sir?<eos> Haley made the biggest impact of his career from a seat on the bench.<eos> And the only thing stopping you from doing the same is you.
Looking a little choppy before you hit the triple.<eos> Yeah, I spun out on a dime.<eos> I thought for sure we were gonna end up stacking bodies.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> You really need a guardrail, something padded.<eos> And there's only one thing that I dislike more than catching a bad batch and losing my wheels...<eos> Being hassled by cops.<eos> Ask you a few questions about the death of Corporal Kyle Campbell?<eos> And I need a little pillow talk with Kate Upton. Look, you knew Kyle, right?<eos> If you have nothing to hide, then there's nothing to be quiet over.
What the hell?<eos> Someone cut the padlock.<eos> Jones body... it's gone.<eos> This will complicate the autopsy.<eos> I jinxed us, didn't I?<eos> So much for a quiet day at the office.<eos> So, you're telling me Petty Officer Jones was murdered?<eos> You can't know that without a body.<eos> Somebody took it for a reason. Why?<eos> You and your team are free to turn this place inside out, but this ship, my ship, is set to rendezvous with the carrier group in two days.
That's great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Same with the blood tests.<eos> The recent stress likely contributed to you passing out.<eos> But only because you're a tad anemic right now, and that's to be expected, so... Wait, what?<eos> Why is that to be expected?<eos> Well, in your current condition.<eos> Wow.<eos> You don't know.

Now, Tim, repeat after me:<eos> "I, Timothy McGee..."<eos> I, Timothy McGee... "take you",<eos> Delilah Fielding..."<eos> take you, Delilah Fielding...<eos> "to be my lawfully wedded wife."<eos> to be my lawfully wedded wife.<eos> "I, Delilah Fielding..."<eos> I, Delilah Fielding...<eos> "take you, Timothy McGee..."
"I, Timothy McGee..."<eos> I, Timothy McGee...

Also explains how he found Nelson.<eos> Got security footage from the parking garage.<eos> Can you fast forward to 9:47 p.m., please?<eos> Yep.<eos> And there's our stoner.<eos> And Gunnery Sergeant Tanner walked right by him.<eos> Yeah, he bumped into him in the parking lot.<eos> Purely by chance.<eos> He recognized him.<eos> Probably from the same photo you did, Gibbs.
Be assured, my government is following up in Liberia.<eos> This will not end here.<eos> Ball's in your court now.<eos> That idiom I know.<eos> Press conference is in an hour.<eos> Director.<eos> Please be mindful in your media portrayal of my government.<eos> It is a powerful tool that could help build trust.<eos> This press conference will be seen back home.<eos> Which is why you're giving the opening statement.
Not necessarily.<eos> Tribal witch doctors have been known to hunt down albinos, and then hack off body parts to use for certain potions, uh, to cure a variety of ills.<eos> Not albino, Duck.<eos> Lot of good it did him.<eos> I'm afraid that's all we have for you now.<eos> I got something.<eos> The BOLO on Petty Officer Charlie Hudson's motorhome came back.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So what are you still doing here?<eos> You know, you don't fool me.
They've got weather satellites covering the entire planet;<eos> resolution isn't as good as the military satellites, but we should be able to pick something up.<eos> If not R.A.C., Petty Officer Hudson.<eos> Still missing.<eos> Yeah, go.<eos> Take Abby.<eos> NCIS.<eos> Again. Hey, McGee.<eos> Hello, hello... hello.<eos> And you must be Carol's friend.
Have they been through here?<eos> They took my brother, Ramón.<eos> Well, boss, couldn't get anyone to talk.<eos> They're afraid of something. Yeah.<eos> Gathered that. Ten kilometers, on foot, to the coordinates where the satellite spotted Dean.<eos> It'll be dark before we get there.<eos> Got to find some place to stay. Okay, let's pack 'em and stack 'em, boys and girls. No time for chitchat.<eos> Well, make time.<eos> NCIS.<eos> Same NCIS you hung up on earlier.
Who's they?<eos> Hudson and Dean.<eos> Asked me for a favor, so I said sure, added their package to our haul.<eos> You expect us to believe you're stupid enough to send some mystery box to Paraguay?<eos> Yeah. Three of us go way back.<eos> You guys serve together?<eos> No, I never actually made it through basic.<eos> We met down at The Anchor Bar.<eos> A lot of SEAL teams hang out there.<eos> And you'd do pretty much anything they asked, right, mate?
Yeah, I think so.<eos> Wow.<eos> Come, sit down.<eos> I haven't been entirely honest with you.<eos> Why am I not surprised?<eos> Owen Granger has been in police custody since this morning.<eos> We just got word that he was stabbed.<eos> Is he alive?<eos> For now. Meanwhile, three of my agents are being held by different agencies across the city.<eos> Now, if none of this is news to you, then, bravo, you win.

Meanwhile, three of my agents are being held by different agencies across the city.<eos> Now, if none of this is news to you, then, bravo, you win.<eos> You think I'm behind this?<eos> Are you?<eos> No.<eos> Henrietta, why didn't you tell me about any of this sooner?<eos> Because I didn't realize what you have to gain until now.
We're about to exit this wormhole a lot sooner than we planned!<eos> [Lance] Whoa.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Looks like some sort of iceberg graveyard.<eos> -Coran, what's the status?<eos> -[Coran] Checking that now.<eos> We didn't make it to our exit point, but we're several galaxies from Zarkon's fleet.<eos> -Allura!<eos> -[all] Allura!<eos> [Coran] Oh, no, you look exhausted.
-Coran, what's the status?<eos> -[Coran] Checking that now.<eos> We didn't make it to our exit point, but we're several galaxies from Zarkon's fleet.<eos> -Allura!<eos> -[all] Allura!<eos> [Coran] Oh, no, you look exhausted.<eos> You must rest.<eos> You've been exerting way too much energy.<eos> I'll go check on the main turbine and figure out what's going-- [screaming]<eos> Whoa! Are you all right?
-[all] Allura!<eos> [Coran] Oh, no, you look exhausted.<eos> You must rest.<eos> You've been exerting way too much energy.<eos> I'll go check on the main turbine and figure out what's going-- [screaming]<eos> Whoa! Are you all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Look, I tell you what, I've probably hit a slippery spot on the ground there.<eos> Someone please wipe that up there!<eos> You're sweating.
I flushed the turbine and it's fine.<eos> The bad news is, the teludav, or wormholer, as you Earthlings call it, is in bad shape.<eos> Several scaultrite lens-stones of the magnifying beam generator are cracked.<eos> As you know, the magnifying beam generator uses a crystal to convert Altean energy into usable fuel. That supplies the power needed to wormhole.<eos> Well, anyway, I need to remove the cracked lenses and readjust their trajectory temporarily until we can replace them.<eos> I'll also need to divert power to make up for the lost energy.<eos> Anyway, it's going to take at least a quintant.<eos> All right. We'll hide the ship and get some rest while Coran comes up with a work-around.<eos> Tomorrow, we'll be sharper and refocused.<eos> What the heck do you think you're doing?

Okay?<eos> I thought you were gonna help Coran with the wormholer.
Why are you making cookies?<eos> Because baking clears my head, Pidge. Okay?<eos> I thought you were gonna help Coran with the wormholer.<eos> One mention of the slipperies and he got all sensitive and kicked me out.<eos> I hate not being able to read Altean.<eos> What is this stuff?<eos> Are you sure you're making food?<eos> You're gonna try and tell me that these aren't cookies?<eos> Okay, I might have overcooked them.<eos> Wait, where you going?
It's me.<eos> It's been me all along.<eos> That's how they found us on planet Arus. [groans]<eos> It doesn't matter, Princess.<eos> We're in this together. We're gonna get out together.<eos> Uh, how?<eos> We're trapped.<eos> We need to form Voltron and go through the storm.<eos> The storm?<eos> What are you, nuts?
We need to form Voltron and go through the storm.<eos> The storm?<eos> What are you, nuts?<eos> Yeah! [stammering] What do you mean?<eos> Yeah, why would we do that?<eos> It's risky, I know, but it's our only chance.<eos> We have to go through the storm, then lure Zarkon's ship away, giving Allura some time to get into open space.<eos> -Then, what?<eos> -Then, we wormhole away.<eos> Coran, remember how you said getting this Castle to wormhole is impossible?

Let's disband and get back to the Castle.<eos> Attack that Castle with everything we've got!<eos> Capture Voltron!<eos> Why haven't we wormholed yet?<eos> Because we can't!<eos> We're missing several scaultrite lens-stones!<eos> They've shattered! Gone!<eos> Don't exist!<eos> Sloven-day-ho! That's Altean for "gone."<eos> Wait, did you say "scaultrite"?
Morvok! [grunts]<eos> [Allura] There's no point in debating this further.<eos> Zarkon is clearly tracking us through me.<eos> [Lance] Aww, space baloney.<eos> [Pidge] That's not possible.<eos> Why would that be so hard to believe?<eos> Zarkon's forces showed up on Arus only after I awoke.<eos> She's got a point.<eos> I would absolutely travel across the galaxy to find you.<eos> It's not you, Princess Allura.
It's a Galra finder.<eos> So, where are the Galra?<eos> [Pidge] The nearest ones are right here. A planet called Taujeer.<eos> Then that's where we're headed.<eos> Everyone should get some sleep.<eos> Tomorrow, we'll find that Galra fleet and take it out.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> You just seem a bit anxious.

[Shiro] Come on!<eos> Give it all you got.<eos> That's it!<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> [Lance] You got it.<eos> [Pidge] Anytime.<eos> [Shiro] All right, Hunk, time to work on those engines.<eos> [Keith] So, what happens if Zarkon does come after us?<eos> You said you could pilot us to safety, right?
We're almost there.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> [Lance] You got it.<eos> [Pidge] Anytime.<eos> [Shiro] All right, Hunk, time to work on those engines.<eos> [Keith] So, what happens if Zarkon does come after us?<eos> You said you could pilot us to safety, right?<eos> Sure, but after that, could we even go back to the group?<eos> And if we don't, who would pilot the Castle or create wormholes?<eos> Well, what about you?
Just in time.<eos> What was that?<eos> The Galra.<eos> They're back.<eos> [Shiro] Hunk!<eos> Take the Yellow Lion and hold up the ark.<eos> If it falls into the acid, the Taujeerians are doomed.<eos> [Hunk] Not to mention the guy beneath them. Which would be me, in this particular scenario.<eos> Lance, Pidge, we've got to draw the cruiser's fire.<eos> Coran, we need you here now.
- How do you know?<eos> Because you're out there, and a Galra fleet just showed up here!<eos> We need you now!<eos> [Allura] We'll be there in two doboshes.<eos> [Keith] Even faster than that.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's the booster fuel Pidge added to this pod.<eos> Allura!<eos> [grunts] Grab my hand!<eos> Princess, are you okay?
Way to go, Coran!<eos> Hunk, what's your status?<eos> Mostly just trying not to fall into a bubbling pot of acid.<eos> Divert all shields to the main hull!<eos> Focus full firepower on their ship!<eos> [Lance] We're being overwhelmed!<eos> [Pidge] We need Voltron!<eos> Oh, if only there were another who could pilot the Red Lion.<eos> Finally, Alfor. I will walk in your footsteps!<eos> Oh, Red Lion, I am unworthy to be your Paladin, but since you have chosen to bestow this honor upon me,
Oh, if only there were another who could pilot the Red Lion.<eos> Finally, Alfor. I will walk in your footsteps!<eos> Oh, Red Lion, I am unworthy to be your Paladin, but since you have chosen to bestow this honor upon me,<eos> Coran Hieronymus Wimbleton Smythe, I humbly accept.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay. Just a quick lap.<eos> Uh, okay, guys?<eos> So, yeah... the-- the Red Lion ran away.<eos> I can't hold it any longer!<eos> Hunk, you have to!
-I can feel it too.<eos> -Same here.<eos> Then do it!<eos> [Shiro] Now let's get the Taujeerians to safety.<eos> How are we going to do that?<eos> Their booster rockets are shot.<eos> I'm so sorry for leaving.<eos> Me too.<eos> We thought we were doing the right thing.<eos> But clearly you were correct, Shiro.
[Shiro] Okay, look.<eos> I now know for certain that Zarkon is tracking us through the Black Lion.<eos> We have to find some way to stop him.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> We've never had this situation before.<eos> Two paladins battling for the same lion.<eos> Well, unless we want Zarkon taking control of Voltron every time we get close... I'll have to forge a new bond with my lion.<eos> One that's stronger than his.<eos> Well, while you're working on that... the rest of us need to find some new teludav lenses... otherwise we won't be able to travel via wormhole.
Last time, I ended up giving away three quarters of my shipment of lango... in exchange for a used pogo oscillator.<eos> Father was not pleased about that.<eos> Well, while Coran is picking up his lenses... I'll take you shopping for something sparkly.<eos> This isn't shopping!<eos> You're not wandering around saying...<eos> "What a lovely pink hat!<eos> This is so becoming."<eos> I can't allow Allura to get anywhere near those... filthy, lowballing Unilu hoodlums.<eos> But I'd love something sparkly.<eos> Look, you're the only one who can operate the Castle.

No, you have to be in the pod bay to call shotgun.
Anything?<eos> Nothing?<eos> Never mind, you know what?<eos> I'll catch up with you guys later!<eos> This is beautiful!<eos> Maybe the scaultrite is under these samples. I don't know.<eos> Rubbery.<eos> Sweet and salty.<eos> So cold, but spicy.<eos> What's next, what do you got?
Where'd you get this?<eos> Someone gave it to me.<eos> Okay, that's vague.<eos> Tell you what...<eos> I'll give you 1,000 GAC to take it off your hands.<eos> It's not for sale.<eos> Two thousand.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Give it back.<eos> How about this? I keep the knife and you beat it before security gets here.
Then tell me where you got it.<eos> Hey! Come back with that!<eos> Trouble at the Slice Capades?<eos> It's one of those pirates!<eos> I knew they looked edgy.<eos> Varkon's comin' for ya!<eos> [Shiro] So this was Zarkon's home planet.<eos> Show me more.<eos> [Shiro] King Alford built you from that comet.<eos> And you fought beside him. With Zarkon.
Maybe check there.<eos> I don't think this would be "on" the map.<eos> It might be more "off-book."<eos> Maybe this will help you remember?<eos> Again, what?<eos> Ah, the old Unilu shakedown, eh?<eos> [chuckling] Fine.<eos> Starting to get a fuzzy recollection yet?<eos> Who is this?<eos> -Is this you?
Let's just say, "Number 44?<eos> Your order's up."<eos> Enjoy your meal.<eos> What did you do to her face?<eos> It's cracking!<eos> She's smiling! She's enjoying her food.<eos> Okay, let's provide some sustenance!<eos> Show me more.<eos> Those wings...<eos> You have powers I haven't unlocked.

And then I will take control of Voltron.
Sauce me!<eos> Now you're getting it!<eos> -Bon appétit.<eos> I got you now, pirate!<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> Don't forget what I taught you!<eos> Those are the fundamentals of cooking!<eos> That kid is a genius.<eos> I don't care if we have to search the entire galaxy! I want him back at Vrepit Sal's!<eos> You could never take my place as the head of Voltron.

You've forgotten what's most important between a lion and its paladin.<eos> It's not about power.<eos> It's about earning each other's trust.<eos> Trust has nothing to do with it.<eos> The lion is mine, forever.<eos> No!<eos> Sire, what is it?<eos> My connection grows weaker.<eos> We must hurry if we ever wish to reclaim Voltron!<eos> Did you just save me?
Who?<eos> Pirate number two!<eos> My lucky day!<eos> Hold on.<eos> With every purchase, you get a free Kaltenecker.<eos> Time to get moving, guys!<eos> Security's on our tail!<eos> There's the rest of the crew!<eos> Everyone up on Kaltenecker!<eos> Did you buy a cow?
Good eye, friend.<eos> This shop's been in my family since before the empire began.<eos> Can I interest you in a butcher barrel?<eos> Or perhaps a set of window breakers?<eos> Teludav lenses! Yes!<eos> I mean, I don't have any idea what these pieces of junk are.<eos> I see you've got your eye on these antique glass table toppers here.<eos> Well, they're pretty ugly. But I do have an empty curio cabinet for grotesqueries.<eos> How much do you want?<eos> How much have you got?
Shiro, this doesn't feel right.<eos> We've come too far to turn back now.<eos> They just sent us a route to the base, but we'll have to move quickly.<eos> Because of the solar flares, it's only open for another varga.<eos> Then, it will be closed for two quintants.<eos> -They're gonna close it for two years?<eos> So, any thoughts on who's gonna join you on this little mission?<eos> I'm thinking things might get a little hot, so you're gonna want someone who can stay cool.<eos> You're right.<eos> Keith, you're coming with me.
He's probably going to shoot first and ask questions later!<eos> And they're not gonna be able to answer his questions because they'll be dead!<eos> We haven't yet severed Zarkon's link with the Black Lion, so it has to stay here.<eos> And the Red Lion can withstand the heat from that sun. So, yes, it'll be Keith.<eos> [Coran] The course to the base will be quite treacherous, to say the least.<eos> You're walking a razor's edge between the gravitational pull of the black holes and the sun.<eos> One false move, and you'll either be crushed into infinity or burnt to a crisp.<eos> -Keith, is everything okay?<eos> -I'm fine.<eos> You kind of blew up at everybody back there.

I know.<eos> We all have.<eos> [Keith] We're getting drawn in by one of the black holes!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Great job!<eos> That was close.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> This place just looks like a plain asteroid.<eos> I am going to ask you some questions.<eos> I will know if you lie.
Are we welcome here or not?<eos> You were told to come unarmed.<eos> You also told us to identify ourselves.<eos> The lions are about as close as we come to an ID.<eos> If anything happens, believe me, you'll be happy you have the Red Lion on your side.<eos> I imagine we would.<eos> However, I wasn't referring to your beast.<eos> Keith!<eos> He has one of our blades!<eos> Who did you steal this from?
Keith!<eos> He has one of our blades!<eos> Who did you steal this from?<eos> I didn't!<eos> I've had it all my life!<eos> [guard] Lies!<eos> [Kolivan] Can you corroborate your friend's statement?<eos> Does this blade truly belong to him?<eos> [Shiro] I... I don't know.<eos> Shiro, you know me.
If they're not going to help us, let's get of here.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> Antok, give the boy the blade.<eos> We will meet again.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> These trials result in one of two things.<eos> Knowledge or death.<eos> Surrender the blade.<eos> You cannot win.
Can't wait.<eos> These trials result in one of two things.<eos> Knowledge or death.<eos> Surrender the blade.<eos> You cannot win.<eos> Come on, Keith.<eos> Surrender the blade and the pain will cease.<eos> I won't quit.<eos> Then the pain continues.<eos> You are not meant to go through that door.
Come on, Keith.<eos> Surrender the blade and the pain will cease.<eos> I won't quit.<eos> Then the pain continues.<eos> You are not meant to go through that door.<eos> This is not a fair fight!<eos> Nor is taking on the Galra, yet that is the fight we face.<eos> Surrender the blade and the pain will cease.<eos> Never!<eos> You are not meant to go through that door.
Too much interference from the solar flares and the black holes.<eos> If we account for the gravitational lensing, maybe we can reduce the noise and interference and connect with the Red Lion's sensors, right?<eos> Th-That's right, right?<eos> -Are you looking at me?<eos> -We can give it a try.<eos> Get on it.<eos> Haggar wishes to speak with you.<eos> Keith!<eos> Guess I really wasn't supposed to go through that door. [groans]<eos> Hey, man. You did it.

Hey, man. You did it.<eos> Shiro?<eos> Kolivan told me you lasted longer than anyone ever has in those battles.<eos> -You don't have to keep this up.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> Just give them the knife and let's get out of here.<eos> I can't give it to them, Shiro.<eos> Is that a hologram?<eos> His suit has the ability to create a virtual mindscape, reflecting its wearer's greatest hopes and fears.<eos> And, at this moment, your friend desperately wants to see you.

So, just give them the knife.<eos> -I can't do that.<eos> -Just give up the knife, Keith!<eos> You're only thinking of yourself, as usual!<eos> I've made my choice.<eos> Then you've chosen to be alone.<eos> Shiro!<eos> Wait!<eos> Huh... [man] Keith... [gasps] Dad?<eos> You're home, son.
Your mother gave it to me.<eos> Mom?<eos> She'll be here soon.<eos> -You need to get him out of there.<eos> -He can decide when to leave.<eos> You're messing with his mind.<eos> You're going to kill him!<eos> Knowledge or death, Shiro.<eos> I'm calling this off.<eos> You gotta tell me, Dad.
I'm calling this off.<eos> You gotta tell me, Dad.<eos> I have to know.<eos> Where did the knife come from?<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Your mother is almost here.<eos> She'll tell you everything.<eos> I can't wait around anymore.<eos> I have to go.<eos> If you go out that door, you'll never find out who you are.
She'll tell you everything.<eos> I can't wait around anymore.<eos> I have to go.<eos> If you go out that door, you'll never find out who you are.<eos> Goodbye, Dad.<eos> -The Red Lion is moving!<eos> -We gotta get down there!<eos> [Hunk] It won't be ready for five more minutes.<eos> I am going to ask you some questions.<eos> I will know if you lie.
-We gotta get down there!<eos> [Hunk] It won't be ready for five more minutes.<eos> I am going to ask you some questions.<eos> I will know if you lie.<eos> I have reason to believe that a spy has infiltrated Galra command.<eos> That is very alarming.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Are you aware of any spies within our ranks?<eos> No.<eos> Commander Thace, are you the one who lowered the solar barrier during the Voltron attack, allowing it to escape?

It has a link with Keith.<eos> It knows when he's in danger.<eos> It's coming for him.<eos> The Red Lion has started attacking!<eos> Wait, what does that mean?<eos> Why would the lion attack?<eos> Unless...<eos> -Allura?<eos> -Everyone, stay focused.<eos> -Keith, are you okay?
Just a few more ticks, Princess.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Wait!<eos> Just take the knife!<eos> It doesn't matter where I come from.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> We all need to work together to defeat Zarkon.<eos> If that means I give up this knife, fine.<eos> Take it.<eos> You've awoken the blade!

What?<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> Oh, nothing important.<eos> We've just figured out a way to defeat Zarkon.<eos> Really?<eos> I dozed for ten minutes, and you guys figured out how to defeat the forces of evil?<eos> You've been asleep for three hours.
But I always get the worst jobs.<eos> Go to a Galra-occupied planet to get my lion. Go to a Galra-occupied Balmera to get a crystal. Go into a belly of a beast with the only Galra alien team member.<eos> I'm not an alien.<eos> Well, you're kind of an alien.<eos> You're way more alien than me. You're at least some alien.<eos> I'm-I'm none alien.<eos> [sighs] Let's just concentrate on the job here.<eos> Yeah. Was-Was your mom the alien?<eos> Your grandpa?<eos> How Galra are you?
I don't know.<eos> Did the Blade of Marmora, like, teach you the secret handshake, or something?<eos> No.<eos> No one said anything.<eos> The Blade of Marmora...<eos> They're real tight-lipped, aren't they?<eos> I get that your society is secret, but is everything a secret?<eos> Okay, look, it's bad enough that Allura hates me now.<eos> Can you just lay off?<eos> Allura doesn't hate you. You just need to give her time to accept the fact that you're Galra, the race that destroyed her entire planet and all of her people.
No way.<eos> Is that Coran?<eos> So, you're about to go into the belly of a weblum to harvest scaultrite.<eos> Good for you!<eos> Scaultrite is an important substance, with thousands of commercial and industrial uses, including fabrication foam, insect night vision goggles, teludav--<eos> Uh anti-fungal klanmüirl lotion and other such lubricants.<eos> What's wrong with the video?<eos> It's ten thousand years old.<eos> It's probably corroded.<eos> I could go on for days. But you've got a weblum to enter and some scaultrite to collect.
[Hunk] Look!<eos> [Keith] Guess that ancient Altean weblum tracker put us right on the money.<eos> We gotta get out of here!<eos> We haven't watched the entire video yet! -We don't know what to do!<eos> -We're not leaving.<eos> You fly, keep our distance. I'll skim through the video.<eos> So, you've made it into the weblum's first stomach!<eos> -[Hunk] Rewind!<eos> -[Keith] I know!<eos> [Coran] So, you've identified a weblum.
I have been given orders to remain by your side until we clear all personnel or find the spy.<eos> What am I standing on?<eos> A mucus pocket?<eos> I do not like mucus!<eos> And is that steaming stomach acid?<eos> Lookit, right over there.<eos> Oh, man, I really hope I don't see any blood.<eos> Hunk!<eos> Knock it off.<eos> You're freaking yourself out.
Oh, man, I really hope I don't see any blood.<eos> Hunk!<eos> Knock it off.<eos> You're freaking yourself out.<eos> No, standing inches away from a pus-bubble is freaking me out.<eos> Look, we're inside a disgusting worm.<eos> There's no way to sugarcoat it.<eos> We're gonna need that big brain of yours if we want to make it through. -Will you be all right?<eos> -[continues groaning]<eos> I said, will you be all right?
No, standing inches away from a pus-bubble is freaking me out.<eos> Look, we're inside a disgusting worm.<eos> There's no way to sugarcoat it.<eos> We're gonna need that big brain of yours if we want to make it through. -Will you be all right?<eos> -[continues groaning]<eos> I said, will you be all right?<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Good.<eos> I gotta be able to count on you.<eos> Besides, no one knows an explosive digestive tract like you.

Not those things again.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're turning this ship into a bomb.<eos> Keith! Keith, are you there?<eos> Keith, answer me!<eos> I guess you can keep your weapon.<eos> -Oh, my gosh, I found it!<eos> Oh, my gosh, don't throw up.<eos> Don't throw-- [retches]<eos> Keith! Keith, you made it!
Ah! I know what to do!<eos> What?<eos> If we want that third stomach gland to secrete the ooze, I need to get farted out of the weblum's butt and attack the face, getting it to fire its laser puke.<eos> For the sake of the universe, I'll provoke the beast!<eos> You two stay here and get that scaultrite!<eos> Hurry!<eos> I don't know how long we can hold these things off.<eos> I'm out!<eos> Heading to my lion now.<eos> Commander, there you are.
Yoo-hoo! Over here!<eos> Yes! Yes, it's gonna do it!<eos> Oh, no, it's gonna do it!<eos> [gasps] It's working!<eos> I think it's about to get hot in here.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> He's out!<eos> [sighs] Tell me you got the scaultrite.<eos> Grabbing it now.<eos> So, you're just like the rest of 'em.
I'm coming out.<eos> [Hunk] On my way.<eos> Where's your buddy?<eos> He's long gone by now, and he got a bag of scaultrite.<eos> What?<eos> Should we go after him?<eos> No.<eos> Whatever the Galra are planning won't matter after we defeat Zarkon.<eos> Copy that.<eos> By the way, Hunk, you really came through in the clutch back there.

All right, guys, we're ready to fire.<eos> Be careful, you've only got one shot.
-You are? -Yes!<eos> That's my thing!<eos> -Since when?<eos> [screaming] Pidge!<eos> Nice catch.<eos> [Pidge] This seems like an awfully large place to hold only one prisoner.<eos> [Shiro] Let's hope this Slav guy is as good as the Blade of Marmora said he is.<eos> Beginning phase two of the plan.<eos> I'm blocking the sensors.<eos> Lance, you've only got four doboshes to scan the base and land your lion before they're back online.

We're right on top of your entry point.<eos> Get to my location.<eos> Hurry, you've got 60 ticks.
-Can you get a visual on the cells?<eos> -No, not from here.<eos> And even if I could, we don't know what Slav looks like.<eos> Then we're just going to have to check both.<eos> Dibs on the closer one!<eos> What? My legs are tired.<eos> [sighs] I'll go to the command center to try and access the security system.<eos> Let's get moving.<eos> [screaming] [screaming continues, intensifies] Already, your mind is rendering me weapons and genetic modifications. -[panting, screaming]<eos> -It must be eating you up.

-And the third level?<eos> Closed system. I can't get in from here.<eos> [Shiro] You can't get in from the command center?<eos> No single location can access the entire prison.<eos> It's a security measure.<eos> When you reach that level, you'll have to link me in.<eos> We're on our way down.<eos> Okay.<eos> [to herself] While you do that...<eos> I'll find you, Matt.
Okay, open the panel next to you.<eos> Connect your gauntlet so I can hack in.<eos> Now, I have access to level three.<eos> Opening the entrances.<eos> Pidge, you have any idea how I'm gonna get through these giant doors?<eos> Lance, be quiet.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> Okay, but seriously, those are some heavy-duty doors.<eos> Don't play innocent.<eos> I know what you did.
Sending to you.<eos> Are you Slav?<eos> Are you here to torture me?<eos> No, I'm here to save you.<eos> I'm a Paladin of Voltron.<eos> Oh, no, even worse.<eos> In 98 and 3/100ths of a percent of realities with a prison break, I die!<eos> And your chances are even worse!<eos> [crunching, growling] [shrieks] Are you--?<eos> [clears throat] Are you Slav?
-Yup. We don't have time for this.<eos> You're just gonna have to bring both of them back.<eos> Okay. Give us the route out of here.<eos> -Yeah, we're ready to go, too.<eos> -[Lance] Hello?<eos> -[Shiro] Pidge!<eos> [Shiro] Lance, looks like we're on our own.<eos> We've gotta get back to Pidge.<eos> Wait, what? I have no idea where I'm going.<eos> -Slav, do you know how to get back?
Okay. Give us the route out of here.<eos> -Yeah, we're ready to go, too.<eos> -[Lance] Hello?<eos> -[Shiro] Pidge!<eos> [Shiro] Lance, looks like we're on our own.<eos> We've gotta get back to Pidge.<eos> Wait, what? I have no idea where I'm going.<eos> -Slav, do you know how to get back?<eos> -Yup. What am I talking about?<eos> Of course, you do. You're a genius.
Oh, but not too right.<eos> -Oh, come on!<eos> -[yelps] Oh! Now, I gotta start over.<eos> Sir, Laika has escaped.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Guard this station.<eos> Come on, get outta here.<eos> Are you sure you know where you're going?<eos> Yup.<eos> -[growling] -Whoa! You're really savage!
-Oh, come on!<eos> -[yelps] Oh! Now, I gotta start over.<eos> Sir, Laika has escaped.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Guard this station.<eos> Come on, get outta here.<eos> Are you sure you know where you're going?<eos> Yup.<eos> -[growling] -Whoa! You're really savage!<eos> No wonder the Marmorites think you're so awesome.
There's a 12 percent chance I could slip.<eos> There are even realities in which I drown because, in those realities, I never learned to swim!<eos> What about this reality?<eos> Did you learn to swim in this one?<eos> I can't remember!<eos> There are infinite possibilities!<eos> It's a tiny puddle!<eos> I can already feel myself not being able to breathe.<eos> My lungs are filling with water.<eos> How did you escape?

He's also a chef and just a pretty cool dude to hang out with.<eos> Yup.<eos> And Keith is always doing things like flying into asteroid fields and black holes and cool junk like that.<eos> Yup.<eos> And I thought I was the team's sharpshooter, but I guess no one else thinks that.<eos> Maybe I don't have a thing.<eos> Yup.<eos> You don't have to agree with me so quickly.<eos> They wouldn't keep me on the team if I didn't contribute in some way, would they?<eos> -Yup. -Maybe you're right.

Yup.<eos> You're so strong.<eos> Must be that robot arm.<eos> But doesn't it bother you that you only have one?<eos> -[screams] -Oh, what?<eos> What? Look at all those cracks!<eos> I can't step on those.<eos> I was carrying you!<eos> Oh, I guess no one cares about their mothers' backs anymore!<eos> Wait, you know that nursery rhyme?
Oh, I guess no one cares about their mothers' backs anymore!<eos> Wait, you know that nursery rhyme?<eos> Nursery rhyme?<eos> I'm talking about quantum realities here.<eos> Cracks initiate space-time temporal fissures, which mathematically make higher probabilities for alternate realities in which your mother has a broken back.<eos> [sighs] Is there a different route we can take?<eos> One without cracks?<eos> Well, sure, we could go out the scree duct, but, you know, it's all full of scree. Ugh!<eos> There's the vlaxenator, but you can hear the water dripping in there.<eos> -And you're worried about drowning.
-Now, you're getting it!<eos> [Shiro] Pidge, are you there?<eos> We need an alternate route.<eos> Pidge?<eos> Okay, sorry about that.<eos> I'm back. I'll find you a new route, Shiro.<eos> -Yeah, can you tell me where I am?<eos> -Just a sec.<eos> Pulling it up now.<eos> [suspenseful music playing] How about I cover your eyes and carry you across?
-I'll know.<eos> -[growls] Let's just give it a try.<eos> No screaming!<eos> I was screaming?<eos> Uh, I don't see an alternate route, Shiro.<eos> -[rapid beeping] -[gasps] -Lance, look out!<eos> -Quick, somebody's coming.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -Are you trying to get us caught?<eos> I've found you.
Uh, I don't see an alternate route, Shiro.<eos> -[rapid beeping] -[gasps] -Lance, look out!<eos> -Quick, somebody's coming.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -Are you trying to get us caught?<eos> I've found you.<eos> Stay away from my friend!<eos> There's your kidnapper.<eos> Put the prison on lockdown!<eos> Pidge, you've gotta shut off this foam for me!
It's our only option.<eos> Why don't we just turn the gravity off and float over them instead?<eos> Honestly, that's our best shot of getting out of here in one piece.<eos> I ran the numbers.<eos> Pidge, any chance you can turn the gravity off?<eos> Oh, that's a great idea!<eos> Then the sentries won't be able to maneuver, but we have our jetpacks.<eos> It's genius!<eos> That robot arm is fantastic!<eos> Now, imagine if you had two.

[gasps] You're an animal?

You're not going anywhere. And neither is the lion.<eos> -[both scream] -[growling] [both scream] [panting] [grunts] [groans] See what I was saying about those robot arms?<eos> Lance! No!<eos> -No!<eos> -Wait, I got this.<eos> Come on... [takes deep breath]<eos> Nice, Lance!<eos> That's why we bring our sharpshooter.<eos> Yup.<eos> At least, you're okay.
I was thinking of my father.<eos> He gave his life to try to keep Voltron out of Zarkon's hands and now we have a chance to defeat him.<eos> I... I don't want to fail.<eos> [Coran] You know...<eos> Princess, your father would be proud of you.<eos> It wasn't that long ago we found out Altea had been destroyed.<eos> - I've never felt so alone.<eos> - Nor have I.<eos> And we could have easily given up. But we didn't.<eos> You didn't.
When the Galra were here, these caverns were closed off. As if the Balmera was protecting itself.<eos> Now that the Balmera is free and healed, the crystal caverns are opened once more.<eos> Of what was that rumble?<eos> Perhaps because a crystal this big has never been asked for.<eos> No, this is something different.<eos> Shall we stop the ceremony?<eos> [grandmother] Let her finish.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [Shay] The crystal has been loaded onto your castle, Princess.<eos> We wish you could stay longer.
- Is this guy a little--?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No doubt.<eos> - Not a fan.<eos> [Coran] Stop hitting the teludav!<eos> [Coran] Princess, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.<eos> What is it, Coran?<eos> This plan of ours, it's... Well, it's dangerous, you know?<eos> We're taking certain risks.<eos> You are taking certain risks.

- And don't forget that cool cube thing.<eos> - Yeah, and that awful cube thing.<eos> You realize once we defeat Zarkon, the universe won't need Voltron anymore.<eos> - We can return to Earth.<eos> - I can look for my family.<eos> I guess I could look for mine.<eos> This is it.<eos> As long as everything goes according to plan, we can't fail.<eos> No more questions.<eos> I'll get the truth out of you one way or another.
Oh, by the way, uh, I invited him to the wedding.<eos> Rootger's coming?<eos> Yes, and he's bringing his girlfriend.<eos> Her name is, uh, Floor.<eos> That's right.<eos> Rootger and Floor, come forth to the dance floor.<eos> Yo? Mr. Gable, are there any job openings down at the warehouse?<eos> - For you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm just... You realize it's a warehouse?
- Yes.<eos> I'm just... You realize it's a warehouse?<eos> It's where boxes are lifted and moved around and stuff.<eos> It's not the greatest gig for people with bird bones.<eos> I'm a lot stronger than you think, Mr. Gable.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> I will see if they're hiring.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> All right, are you squeezing my hand to prove how strong you are?
Come on, guy.<eos> You're sweating all over the boxes.<eos> Makes it hard to read the barcodes.<eos> It's crazy hot back here, man.<eos> Where's the air conditioning?<eos> Oh, that?<eos> That's, uh, in the spa area.<eos> Right next to the waterfall.<eos> It's a warehouse, guy.<eos> Hey, uh, I noticed you're out of the, uh, the Bluetooth headphones thing.
That's, uh, in the spa area.<eos> Right next to the waterfall.<eos> It's a warehouse, guy.<eos> Hey, uh, I noticed you're out of the, uh, the Bluetooth headphones thing.<eos> I'm gonna go up front and let them know that...<eos> - Ah, don't do it.<eos> - What? Come on, you're looking for an excuse to go up front into the air conditioning.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Trust me, it'll kiss your skin, you're gonna love it, and then you're gonna have to come back here and melt.
We're gonna be in it for the long haul.<eos> - I'm not really a sports guy.<eos> - No, you like movies?<eos> 'Cause I love that Sandy Bullock.<eos> Isn't she fantastic?<eos> I will see anything she is in.<eos> Her or Liam Neeson, right?<eos> With the scary phone voice.<eos> "I'm coming for ya."<eos> Kevin, you think you're the first warehouse guy to make pointless conversation just to stay in the air conditioning?
Kevin, you think you're the first warehouse guy to make pointless conversation just to stay in the air conditioning?<eos> Oh, Mark!<eos> Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark...<eos> Saying my name a bunch of times is not gonna work either.<eos> Here's the deal...<eos> I feel like I'm being underutilized in the back.<eos> I should be out here on the sales floor.<eos> I don't tell a lot of people this, but my passion, from when I was born, has always been electronics.<eos> - Yes, you know... your TVs... computers, and... vacuum things and... and, uh...<eos> those strips, you know, with, like, a lot of plugs you can do... like a... Lot of options on those things.
But are they first cousins?<eos> Because if they're not, that's not that weird.<eos> No, that's still really weird.<eos> Hey.<eos> Kev around?<eos> Some of the boys at the fire station went hunting, and he said he wanted some venison.<eos> Oh. Deer meat... in a CVS bag.<eos> Well, I had to grab some cortisone cream.<eos> Eh, it's a long story.<eos> Uh, hey, Uncle Kyle, who are you bringing to the wedding?

You have my attention.
- For Uncle Kyle? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> No.<eos> She's a partner at a law firm and she paid her way through law school by being a fitness model.<eos> Yeah, well, you know what else she is, is single.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Mom, no, I don't know.<eos> Kendra, you need to get on board with these cuts because as of now, we have 12 people eating Yodels in their cars.<eos> Do I need the belt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's for back support, but you're wearing it like a halter top.
I don't understand.<eos> I'm... I'm making more money.<eos> Now I get to contribute to the wedding.<eos> That's not the point, Chale.<eos> You've been working here half a day, and they bump you up into the room with the A/C and the fancy shirts and...<eos> Ooh! You think you're better than us?<eos> No, no. It...<eos> It's not that at all.<eos> We have different abilities.<eos> You have a very low center of gravity.
He's the token gray.<eos> People are only buying things from him 'cause they think he's gonna die.<eos> If you could just send this back on the belt, I need to get back out front.<eos> It's boiling in here, and I am beginning to shvitz.<eos> So I said, "Hey, "I'm not gonna bill you for getting the kitty out of the tree, but someone's gonna pay for these pants. " Wow.<eos> Brave and funny.<eos> Yeah, and sometimes, both at the same time.<eos> Yeah. I, uh, put out a grease fire once at a comedy club and stayed for open mic night.<eos> Yep, came in second. Whatevs.<eos> Kyle, you are too much.
But, anyway, I have seen enough here.<eos> I'll go get to work onsome other couples, huh? Okay.<eos> - I'll text you names.<eos> Bye. - Okay, bye.<eos> So let's just say I'm pretty much banned from the Empire State building.<eos> Me and King Kong.<eos> Hmm? Yesterday, one of our back room brothers betrayed us.<eos> He sold us up the river for nothing.<eos> Sorry, I'm ashamed of myself.<eos> Not you, Bob.
Now alone, we're just single fingers, but together, we ball up into a fist, a fist of power.<eos> Hey, Gable.<eos> Jerry called in sick.<eos> You want a shot at sales up front?<eos> I'm just gonna need a minute.<eos> What's up?<eos> Mr. Gable, what are you doing here?<eos> Just waiting for the store to open.<eos> Getting ready to chow down on a nice Danish compliments of the beautiful break room they got there only for salespeople.<eos> So you're working up here now?

I'm already the top salesman.<eos> Oh, and, uh... out here, they don't call me Scott, just "The Machine. "<eos> Well, Machine, I've already felt the cool air, the nice poly blend against my skin, so I'm doing everything it takes to stay out here.<eos> That's what's happening.<eos> That's pineapple.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Oh. I gotta...<eos> Thank you for shopping at Best Box.<eos> Your warranty is in the bag.<eos> Hey, you looking at the 65-inch 4K, huh?

Sit.<eos> Stay.<eos> Let's get this bad boy tied to the roof of your car.<eos> We'll get you home.<eos> I think I'll look around a little bit more.<eos> Okay, but the sale's not gonna last much longer.<eos> It says it's on sale for the whole season.<eos> That sign's, like, two years old.<eos> Personally, I find that a good sound system is as important as the picture itself.<eos> Now with these, you get the movie theater experience without ever leaving the house.

By the way, where are you from?<eos> We love your accent.<eos> Birmingham, England.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Told you. Your co-worker's wonderful.<eos> With that accent, he could sell me anything.<eos> Not bad for a guy who's just out on parole.<eos> He's still wrestling with some demons.<eos> But just make sure you get your credit card back.<eos> Hey, I know why you're outselling me.

That's an interesting accent.<eos> - Where you from?<eos> - Right around London.<eos> Where exactly?<eos> By the bridge, the...<eos> London Bridge.<eos> After it fell down.<eos> They rebuilt it.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause I used to live in London, and nobody talked like you.
These are all excellent headphones.<eos> These are more expensive, but they're the best.<eos> Rootger? - Oh.<eos> - How about those Mets, huh?<eos> Hey.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> And why would I help you?<eos> Traitor.<eos> 'Cause I'll buy you lunch, and... and...<eos> You can eat it right here.

What?<eos> Her teeth are white.<eos> Mm. More of an eggshell.<eos> I need like a new golf ball white.<eos> Okay, so, let me get this straight.<eos> We set you up with this incredible girl who's into you, and you don't like her because her teeth are not golf ball white?<eos> New golf ball white.<eos> Plus, the girl's got emotional issues.<eos> When I pulled over to get her Crest whitening strips, she flipped out on me.<eos> "I hate you.

We don't have a union!<eos> We should.<eos> Hey, there's an AX right there.<eos> Bob, Bob. AX 200.<eos> Right there, that box.<eos> Give me that, please.<eos> - Oh, no problem. - All right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just need to inventory it first.<eos> Oh, you're killin' me.
You gotta take it.<eos> Oh, that's a belly burner!<eos> Take it, sir! Sir, take it!<eos> Sir, no!<eos> No!<eos> Can I interest you in our extended warranty?<eos> You know, I was thinking, um, out of 162 games, if the Mets' pitching can just stay healthy for, like, half of them, we would be in good shape.<eos> Get back in the hole.<eos> Fine, but I want you to know, back there, we are a band of brothers.<eos> So you can just stay up here by yourself and rot.
You were saying?<eos> All right, okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've got to take this.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Dr. McCord, it's Marguerite Sanchez from the FBI.<eos> Deputy Director Sanchez, what can I do for you?<eos> We apprehended a suspect today whom we believe is responsible for building the bomb that was used in the attack at the coffee shop in Illinois.<eos> Yeah, I saw that on the news.<eos> I think you may have some knowledge and expertise that could be helpful to our investigation.
This is our guy, Rex Mayfield.<eos> He built the bomb that Atif Al-Mutaya detonated in Illinois?<eos> They met in an ISIS chat room and made the deal on the Dark Web.<eos> The bomb was fairly sophisticated.<eos> Evidence discovered in Mayfield's barn links him strongly to that bomb.<eos> Did he have any prior ties to ISIS, or is he self-radicalized?<eos> That's one of the things we're hoping you can help us with.<eos> So far, he's not really saying much that's useful.<eos> Well, look, I would be happy to help, but you must have experts better qualified in Islamic extremism.<eos> He also has ties to another radical group you're very familiar with.
Looks like you spoke too soon.<eos> Madam Secretary, I have some bad news.<eos> President Diome, all of the leg work on the solar farm has been done.<eos> Why on earth would you turn around and give the contract to the Chinese?<eos> They offered us better terms.<eos> Let me guess, no money down in exchange for exclusive rights to your, what, titanium reserves?<eos> The oil and gas fields recently discovered off our coast, actually.<eos> China's been making these deals all over Africa.<eos> They rarely work out well for the host nation.<eos> You know that.
We're gonna be fine.<eos> No offense, ma'am, that would all be much more comforting to a math major, so if you don't mind, I'm just gonna close my eyes now.<eos> Sure.<eos> You're going to prison for the rest of your life.<eos> But if you tell us where the other bomb is, we can take death off the table.<eos> I'd argue death has a mind of its own.<eos> Where's the other bomb, Rex?<eos> Don't know.<eos> But like you, I'm all atwitter to find out.<eos> You said you built the bombs to bring about the prophecy.

You're welcome.<eos> Whatever Rex is doing... stop him.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Foreign Minister Chen.<eos> Madam Secretary, welcome to Nigeria.<eos> A word?<eos> Ming, if you're trying to send me a message, you don't have to follow me all over Africa.<eos> Why, you could have just called.<eos> I'm simply offering Senegal and Nigeria competitive deals... for the benefit of both parties.<eos> So, they get a wind farm, you get 100-year leases on oil and gas.
I'm honored, Madam Secretary, but I must confess, a bit surprised.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I came back to discuss a deal with you that could bring significant investment to Togo.<eos> Might even provide jobs for them one day.<eos> That would be wonderful... but U.S., historically, has avoided investing heavily in Togo.<eos> Why the change?<eos> You notice I didn't say,<eos> "significant American investment."<eos> Now I am officially intrigued.<eos> You want responsible foreign investment that lifts up the Togolese people.
That was quite an experience we had in Bolivia.<eos> It all worked out according to God's will.<eos> Speaking of God's will, remind me, what are the Five Pillars of Islam?<eos> What?<eos> Why is Al Masjid Al Aqsa significant to Muslims?<eos> The Dome of the Rock where the Prophet Muhammad ascended into heaven.<eos> Peace be upon him.<eos> That's what you say when the prophet's name is mentioned.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Mayfield.<eos> You are officially not a Muslim.
The reverend was a brilliant man.<eos> He really wasn't.<eos> In just two hours, he was questioning everything he'd told you.<eos> Liar.<eos> His faith was strong... and so is mine.<eos> Which faith?<eos> Your pretensions to Islam or your misguided Christian cult?<eos> You know, Finch should have really listened to you, taken steps to bring about the end.<eos> But, as I said, he had doubts about the entire enterprise.<eos> So, in my professional opinion, you've made some grievous theological errors, Rex.
I-I did receive a payment from Mr. Andrada, and I told your embassy employee that it was hush money for unwanted sexual advances.<eos> But the truth is the payment that I received was to keep quiet about something else.<eos> Something much bigger, more damaging.<eos> I will tell you the truth, Madam Secretary, on one condition.<eos> Which is what?<eos> You must grant me asylum here in the United States.<eos> I won't be able to go back home after I tell you.<eos> President Andrada, hello.<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> You are a man of many surprises.
That is how I keep my enemies off-balance.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your friends, too.<eos> In fact, just today President Dalton learned something about you that he found surprising in the extreme.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm sorry, where are my manners?<eos> How's the nose?<eos> Is that a-a new splint?<eos> I do not have time for these games.<eos> No, I know you like to cut right to the chase.

You've taken tens of millions of dollars in secret payments from Chinese companies.<eos> We have the proof, and we intend to share it with the Filipino people.<eos> I am a millionaire many times over.<eos> My people will never believe it.<eos> We'll find out soon enough.<eos> These are exactly the kind of American lies the Filipino people will never accept.<eos> Let me stop you right there.<eos> You don't have to give me a speech.<eos> Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe the Filipino people will be fine with you selling them out to China to enrich yourself.

Elizabeth.<eos> Great speech.<eos> The press at home is already talking about how brilliantly I played China and the U.S. off one another to our advantage.<eos> Which was my plan all along.<eos> Sure.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I'll see you in Singapore in a month.<eos> So now we are even.<eos> Who, you and I?<eos> You know,
Well, I guess I have no choice now.<eos> Look, I'm not happy about it, either.<eos> For all I know, you're playing a long game to set us up.<eos> I could say the same to you.<eos> I suppose for now, we'll just have to trust each other.<eos> Open this door!<eos> Stop!<eos> I'll tell you anything!<eos> A confession already?<eos> You are good.
- I guess we'll see.<eos> - Kallus.<eos> I saw a report that a shuttle theft from Lothal was prevented.<eos> Actually, Lieutenant Lyste was responsible for that.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that deserves commendation.<eos> Thank you, Governor.<eos> Step carefully.<eos> ISB is watching her.<eos> You should, too.
The use of this specific color, the angle of the line, this is the work of the rebel Sabine Wren.<eos> I believe this helmet belongs to her compatriot, the young Jedi and our escaped prisoner, Ezra Bridger.<eos> Bridger?<eos> If Bridger was the shuttle thief, why didn't Kallus alert us?<eos> Because, Colonel Yularen, Kallus is the rebel spy, Fulcrum.<eos> He used Lyste's cylinder to impersonate and implicate him.<eos> And more importantly, he used the young Jedi's power to gain access to my office and reprogram my droids.<eos> Very skillfully, I might add.<eos> I would never have suspected one of my best students was capable of this betrayal.<eos> And that is why you and so many others have been deceived.
Clearly to me, it seems to be this is an issue of money. was gonna do everything in their power to make sure that this bill wasn't signed.<eos> Backpage argues that Senate Bill 6251 would violate Section 230 of the CDA.<eos> That they have no responsibility for third party postings.<eos> The court agrees, and the bill dies.<eos> ♪ There's a lady ♪<eos> ♪ Such a lady ♪<eos> ♪ With perfect etiquette ♪<eos> ♪ She can cook An eight-course meal ♪<eos> ♪ And never break a sweat ♪<eos> ♪ Happy blessings to you God blessings to you ♪
Deputy Director Atwood, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Jack's psycho profile B.S. isn't evidence.<eos> But the e-mails that Agent Garcia found on your private server are, Walter.<eos> You have no idea what you've done.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You had Delgado killed.<eos> You put my team in the line of fire like we were expendable.<eos> You are expendable!
So do you want eggs or not?<eos> With this rate of tariff, I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect on the anti-dumping cases.<eos> I think this is going to work.<eos> I'll need to run this by my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.<eos> I think this is a very good day for both of our countries.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> There's an American on the boat.<eos> The Russian research vessel.<eos> - And how do you know that?<eos> - Mr. Xu told me before you came in.
- Will Conway's my friend. But... this won't end well for him if he wins.<eos> You take care of yourself, Ben.<eos> They have a recording of him.<eos> I'll be right there in a minute.<eos> You have to promise me Will Conway never finds out this came from me.<eos> You know I'm gonna be the president, right?<eos> - I hope so, sir.<eos> - You hope so?<eos> I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.<eos> I'm gonna be the president, and you're gonna flip me those motherfucking controls...
But I know that's not the kind of thing you like to hear.<eos> Mark.<eos> Come in.<eos> - We have much to discuss.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> Uh, Mr. President.<eos> As I believe you know, yesterday we had something of a drill here in the White House.<eos> I know people are wondering what that was about.<eos> Yes.<eos> Everyone except you.
What?<eos> Forgot to eat today.<eos> What have you got for me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Don't do "I don't know."<eos> Saw Meredith Lee.<eos> I mentioned the Moretti Fund, organ transplants, uh...<eos> She got a little tense, but... I don't know.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were fired?<eos> - Oh, that was you?
You might have been.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't even know what I'm saying sometimes.<eos> Forget it.<eos> - Hey, hang on a second. - Hey. I need to tell you how I'm feeling.<eos> The nation needs you, Mr. President.<eos> - We all need you. - We're done for today.<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> Why don't you want to hear what I'm trying to tell you?<eos> Listen. You... enough.
Ten minutes. 20 minutes.<eos> Really, two minutes for a nickel?<eos> When did I get a peso?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Any chance you could lend me a quarter?<eos> Lend you?<eos> Are you a good credit risk?
Terrible... but I think you probably have 30 cents of good karma coming at you.<eos> Oh, in that case, why don't I just give you the full two hours?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> This hopefully makes up for all those gas stations I robbed.<eos> What?<eos> It's a joke.<eos> It was just one liquor store.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> - You, too.
That band doesn't deserve to be saved on the hard drive.<eos> Sir, I'm here to take in Lieutenant Dale.<eos> She's there.<eos> Stop.<eos> - Lieutenant Dale, stop.<eos> - Freeze!<eos> Stop! Freeze!<eos> Get 'em up!<eos> Colonel Jackson, please, I can explain...<eos> Lieutenant Tamsin Dale, you are under arrest per Article 134 for violation of Section 793 of the Espionage Act.
Different rules, different trial science.<eos> We could even put the president on the stand.<eos> Nobody is putting the president on the stand.<eos> - Dare to dream.<eos> - Right.<eos> Gentlemen, as the convening authority, I'm gonna ask that you not turn this trial into a media circus.<eos> "Convening authority"?<eos> One officer picks the jury pool and gets to set a lot of the rules.<eos> We don't do a lot of courts-martial, so I'm gonna ask you to use my office as the interview space for Lieutenant Dale.<eos> You were her commanding officer.
That's why.<eos> Tell me about the memo you leaked.<eos> 43 civilians died in that bombing.<eos> Colonel Kell said he cared less about civilian casualties than his tactical objectives.<eos> Except one of his tactical objectives is to prevent civilian casualties.<eos> For every civilian we kill, we make 40 enemies.<eos> So, part of every mission is try hard not to kill them.<eos> But the colonel's collateral damage stats were 30% higher than his peers.<eos> Unless he was stopped, it was going to happen again.<eos> You're a lieutenant and you get to decide this?
I went through the chain of command.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> And the colonel continued his reckless engagements.<eos> So, I went to my ultimate boss.<eos> The American people?<eos> Come on.<eos> It's why I signed up in the first place.<eos> I'm fighting this because I did nothing wrong.<eos> The secret Ranger unit might disagree.<eos> Wasn't a covert unit exposed and three soldiers killed because you leaked that memo?

I'm not saying anything about the Ranger unit until you have security clearance.<eos> So... you're just not going to say.<eos> I can't.<eos> Okay, I guess we're out of here.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Even with your life at stake.<eos> Why'd you release the document?<eos> One sentence, don't think about it, just say it now.<eos> I love my country.<eos> You may think it sounds hokey, but we're the greatest nation in history, or supposed to be... and then this colonel comes along and says he doesn't care if we kill innocent people.

Guess I'll gas up my car.<eos> And we are... going off the grid,<eos> - except for my computer...<eos> - Be strong.<eos> Which is air-gapped and externally booted.<eos> I will input the information into the algorithm, and the completed profiles will go there... and on paper.<eos> Paper.<eos> So, how'd the team take it?<eos> I told them it would be fun, like camping.<eos> Marissa, have you ever been camping?
What leadership score did you give Lambert?<eos> Grading on the officer curve... yikes.<eos> He's only 50th percentile.<eos> Looks like Lambert, juror number one, is our nuke.<eos> Mr. Colon.<eos> Two.<eos> Yes. Colonel.<eos> We would like to thank and excuse juror number two, Major Vikowitz.<eos> Vikowitz?<eos> Bull, did you hear me?
We have our panel.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.<eos> Please report tomorrow at 0900.<eos> Counsel will now have a motions hearing.<eos> Mr. Colon, please follow Major Barnett.<eos> This session is adjourned.<eos> Follow me, Mr. Colon.<eos> Why Vikowitz?<eos> Not smiling, head still.<eos> Did you see the way he steepled his fingers?
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Colon and I have to take a trip.<eos> Trip?<eos> I thought we were having a motions hearing.<eos> 'Cause I'm making a motion about a classified document, the hearing will be held at a black site.<eos> Black site.<eos> Cool.<eos> Attorneys only, sir.<eos> Got it.<eos> The one time I might want to be a lawyer.<eos> By signing this security memorandum, you agree never to share, speak of or acknowledge the existence of classified documents in this case.
Attorneys only, sir.<eos> Got it.<eos> The one time I might want to be a lawyer.<eos> By signing this security memorandum, you agree never to share, speak of or acknowledge the existence of classified documents in this case.<eos> And if you do any of those things, Mr. Colon, be warned. You can be jailed up to ten years.<eos> I understand.<eos> We're on the record.<eos> So where's the mysterious document?<eos> This is part of discovery.<eos> But you weren't allowed to view it till you had clearance.
Sergeants Valeo, Frakes and Lieutenant Kleeman were killed.<eos> - It's tragic.<eos> - Yeah, but when they arrested our defendant, they didn't charge her with that. Why not?<eos> There must be a reason.<eos> Uncovering other people's secrets is like catnip to you.<eos> But you keep yours to yourself.<eos> Vicious slander.<eos> Thanks for the wall.<eos> How was the hearing?<eos> Or was it all just a terrible misunderstanding and you're now the oldest Chi Phi pledge at Hudson?
Vicious slander.<eos> Thanks for the wall.<eos> How was the hearing?<eos> Or was it all just a terrible misunderstanding and you're now the oldest Chi Phi pledge at Hudson?<eos> "What the U.S. Army Won't Let You Know."<eos> Wow. GlobeSpill's Web site certainly knows how to sell a memo.<eos> I can't talk about the black site, Bull.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> So you're using the jury profiles to manipulate the jury.
Okay.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> So you're using the jury profiles to manipulate the jury.<eos> To know the jury.<eos> Everyone looks at life through a filter.<eos> Some people are cheerful, some suspicious.<eos> Some have an impudent disregard for trial science.<eos> Impudent.<eos> Profiles help us see what color that filter is.<eos> So you can choose facts.
Well, it's just...<eos> GlobeSpill is associated with Chinese hackers, right?<eos> Well, that's a rumor.<eos> NSA hasn't been able to track it down.<eos> I mean, officially, anyway.<eos> Well, GlobeSpill may want... Tamsin locked up and forgotten about.<eos> So that they could cover up something they did.<eos> Can you build new juror profiles?<eos> Not until we find the worm.<eos> You and Cable do that.
Precedent.<eos> The Army wants to come down hard on leakers.<eos> Look at Private Manning a couple of years ago.<eos> But Manning leaked tens of thousands of documents.<eos> Lieutenant Dale only leaked one.<eos> Under the Espionage Act, it doesn't matter.<eos> The crime is the leak, not who got hurt.<eos> Can only argue lack of harm at sentencing.<eos> After she's been convicted.<eos> You're early.

If we could just bring up the real memo...<eos> I'm going to prison.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I want you to know what you're up against.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> Dr. Bull told me the situation about my case.<eos> Well, your testimony will help.<eos> Thank you for representing me.<eos> I know you didn't want to.
No more secrets.<eos> Dr. Bull told me the situation about my case.<eos> Well, your testimony will help.<eos> Thank you for representing me.<eos> I know you didn't want to.<eos> Yeah, well,<eos> I blew up my career once, too.<eos> In the D.A.'s office.<eos> This guy was going away for something he didn't do, and, um...<eos> You threw yourself on a grenade.
Mr. Colon, silence.<eos> She uploaded a redacted document.<eos> No classified information, no Ranger unit.<eos> GlobeSpill filled in the blanks, got those Rangers killed.<eos> - It was GlobeSpill.<eos> - Mr. Colon, stop.<eos> The members will disregard Mr. Colon's outburst and the allegations in it.<eos> Those allegations shall play no part in your deliberations.<eos> Colonel Gonzalez, I move for a recess, and can we please absent the panel?<eos> You know what happens now.
You know what happens now.<eos> The FBI comes to TAC and arrests me.<eos> No.<eos> They're gonna do it right here.<eos> FBI.<eos> Special Agent Jim Riley.<eos> - Listen carefully.<eos> - Sir, I need you to step aside.<eos> Now.<eos> Benjamin Colon, you are under arrest for violating Section 793 of the Espionage Act.
I told her to.<eos> You went behind my back?<eos> She had to tell the jury she didn't get those Rangers killed.<eos> They would have charged her, Bull, on another count of espionage.<eos> It was a tactical decision.<eos> Maybe she gets charged, maybe she beats all the charges.<eos> - She agreed.<eos> - Always going for the big win?<eos> I told you to trust me.<eos> - When you didn't trust me!

She scrubbed maybe 20%, but I'm just not sure how much longer we have.<eos> - Until what?<eos> - Until we're raided by the FBI.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> - The FBI's coming here?<eos> - As soon as they get a warrant.<eos> The Feds are not gonna get a peek at our clients' business.<eos> Be ready to hit the kill switch.<eos> Colonel Jackson.<eos> Hey. You seem like a good guy, is what I don't get, being all you can be.
Colonel Jackson.<eos> Hey. You seem like a good guy, is what I don't get, being all you can be.<eos> I bet your soldiers look up to you.<eos> And I bet they're right to.<eos> I imagine you're gonna wheel up next to a point any day now.<eos> How could you convene a trial when you knew Lieutenant Dale only uploaded a redacted document?<eos> Do you think taking some words out makes it okay to violate orders?<eos> GlobeSpill put those Rangers in harm's way, not Dale.<eos> You know what happens when you join the greatest fighting force the world has ever known?<eos> You make a commitment to discipline.
So, um, talked to Barnett.<eos> The judge gave a second instruction to the members to disregard Benny's fireworks.<eos> And this is one jury that knows how to follow orders.<eos> Maybe, but they heard it.<eos> And they saw Benny get arrested to let them hear it.<eos> Well, what's Lieutenant Dale gonna do without Benny?<eos> Give the closing argument?<eos> Me?<eos> The members want to hear from you.<eos> Walk them through what you did.
Well, what's Lieutenant Dale gonna do without Benny?<eos> Give the closing argument?<eos> Me?<eos> The members want to hear from you.<eos> Walk them through what you did.<eos> Start with the bombing. - Go.<eos> - At 0530 on 1 December, a unit from the 28th Armored Brigade deployed a series of laser-guided bombs<eos> - together with Maverick missiles... - No.<eos> No, no, no, stop.<eos> I ask you to tell me about a traumatic car wreck, and you read me the accident report?
Why'd you report this colonel?<eos> He's a jerk. So what?<eos> - He was an ongoing threat...<eos> - The story.<eos> Why do you care so much about civilian casualties?<eos> - It affects our mission.<eos> - The story, Lieutenant.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw this.<eos> - And screw you. - Hey.

Body language matters.<eos> Manolo and McNamara are our most important jurors, which means eye contact.<eos> Engage with every word.<eos> Things were so black and white to me then.<eos> Right and wrong.<eos> Colonel Kell was wrong, so I had to act.<eos> And the Army asked him to resign.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> You need to punch the key words.
Can I help you, Dr. Bull?<eos> There was this officer in 2006.<eos> Deployed with the 141st Infantry Brigade in Kabul.<eos> Forward operating base, lots of civilian contact.<eos> The unit came under fire, and a private left behind some ordnance.<eos> Kids were known to play in the area, so this officer... went back for it. Without permission.<eos> And on his way back, he hit an IED, and it took off his hand.<eos> I may have heard this one.<eos> Another soldier's mistake put the mission at risk.<eos> You fixed it and got a Bronze Star in the process.

Colonel Jackson?<eos> Lieutenant Tamsin Dale's actions make me sick to my stomach.<eos> The arrogance. The selfishness. The carelessness.<eos> This is a young woman who had so much promise.<eos> And she threw it away because she thought her opinions were more important than the rules.<eos> That her humanity trumped her duty.<eos> But... to remain the greatest force for good this nation has ever known, the Army must study its mistakes.<eos> And if we hide our mistakes and punish the people who expose them, we won't.<eos> Lieutenant Dale, as convening authority, I am altering your sentence.<eos> You will be dismissed from the Army, but your confinement will be limited to one year, served here, on base.

Court is adjourned.<eos> Maybe what you do, maybe lying for a living is... a little strong.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Your story's gonna be... different from here on out.<eos> I signed up to serve my country.<eos> Turns out this is how I'm going to do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Be well, Lieutenant.<eos> Danny's right.<eos> You're pretty good.
Hey.<eos> - The FBI took the deal?<eos> - What deal?<eos> The FBI wants to get GlobeSpill, we gave 'em GlobeSpill's worm.<eos> We traded Benny for the hackers' code.<eos> The FBI is gonna bludgeon GlobeSpill with it at trial.<eos> All charges dropped.<eos> It was Bull's idea.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You didn't come to the FBI for my release.

I told my best friend.<eos> Kenny.<eos> He told his father, and his father told my stepmother.<eos> And then your stepmother punished her.<eos> Sometimes a secret has to be kept.<eos> I didn't need your protection in court.<eos> I know.<eos> If I had to do it again, I'd do the exact same thing.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're Benny Colon, right? Yeah.
I did it.<eos> You would have broken your ankle if you hadn't.<eos> Fear only gets you so far, Lund.<eos> You want to make agent, you better find another way to motivate your butt up that rope.<eos> Lieutenant Nielsen's wife said he came home early from tour to take her on an anniversary cruise on their boat.<eos> Lives in Shreveport, drove down yesterday to prep.<eos> Next thing she knows, CACO's at her door.<eos> She's left with a broken heart while her husband was literally melted away.<eos> Ladies first. Oh, no.<eos> You're senior ranking agent.
Listen, Ryan, I-I never thought that I would be a hero.<eos> Especially after I screwed up really bad a couple of years ago when I chickened out, but... then a very good friend of mine set me straight.<eos> Yeah, there was a time when I thought I would be an archeologist.<eos> Yeah, what happened?<eos> Why did you decide to go to medical school?<eos> Well, although archeology carried a certain romantic appeal, I soon realized it wasn't in my bones, so to speak.<eos> You have to decide what's in your bones, Mr. Palmer.<eos> Not a spine.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> You just have a-a well-developed sense of self-preservation.

We can't risk spooking this kid while Palmer's hanging onto him.<eos> Okay, Gibbs.<eos> Yeah, you got it.<eos> Um, excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you not to go up there.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah, crazy, I know, but Navy interests.<eos> But that's a city building.<eos> Yeah, I know that, but that's one of our team members up there, and if he dies, you're gonna be dealing with the whole U.S. Navy.
Before you fled Russia, I asked<eos> Arkady to look in on Katerina.<eos> And I learned that she had a daughter... my daughter.<eos> You're a grandfather.
Before you fled Russia, I asked<eos> Arkady to look in on Katerina.<eos> And I learned that she had a daughter... my daughter.<eos> You're a grandfather.<eos> And you an uncle.<eos> Does she know?<eos> We're gonna tell her.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> Don't worry, Grandpa.<eos> You survived worse than this.
His grandfather, he served in World War I.<eos> His father died in Guadalcanal.<eos> And his son-- he lost his son in Desert Storm. - Hmm.<eos> - Well, we may have started this with a missing lieutenant, but now Master Sergeant Louis Miller is our case, and we need<eos> - to find him.<eos> - Uh, may I suggest we start with the retirement home.<eos> He was having a problem with his oxygen when he was abducted.<eos> Maybe there's somebody working on the inside.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I want you and Deeks undercover at the retirement home.
Perfect.<eos> And, Ms. Blye? Yes?<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, Mr. Hanna?<eos> Yeah?<eos> A Secret Service agent will meet you in the boatshed.<eos> It seems Louis is a person of interest in one of their investigations.<eos> What kind of investigation?<eos> Well, that's for you to find out. Okay.

Okay.<eos> And, Mr. Callen.<eos> You and I have another matter to attend to.
It may be a long recovery.<eos> Is something else going on with him?<eos> He'll pull through.<eos> And he's not the matter at hand, Mr. Callen.<eos> Yeah. I, uh...<eos> I think I know what this is about.<eos> Joelle. No.<eos> No, I-I don't want to talk about that bitch.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you?
Thank you, Agent Thompson.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Well, he's a piece of work.<eos> Well, I don't want to waste any more of your precious time, Agent DeChamps.<eos> What do you have on Louis Miller?<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> Looks like a picture of a coin.<eos> It's a 1933 double eagle gold coin.<eos> The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made it illegal for citizens to possess gold currency, but I think Louis Miller's hiding one.<eos> Wait, hold on. A decorated vet's been kidnapped, and you're talking to me about pocket change? I thought maybe the guy threatened the president.
Ginger here was distracting you.<eos> Didn't even work on you a little, handsome?<eos> I mean, you are a stone-cold fox, but I got a lady bird.<eos> Thank you, though, Ginger.<eos> Okay.<eos> So you caught us.<eos> What are you gonna do now?<eos> I'm a war hero. Well, the voices in my head actually informed me that you're not,<eos> Eddie, a war hero.<eos> Oh, I am. No, you're not a war hero. You're a liar.
I thought Louis gave you the location of the Double Eagle.<eos> He did.<eos> Los Angeles National Cemetery.<eos> Buried with his son.<eos> You were right.<eos> He kept it in the family.<eos> Don't worry, Agent Hanna, I'm not gonna go digging up a marine's grave.<eos> I'd need to get a court order, permission from the Health Department--<eos> - I'm too impatient for all that.<eos> I don't think you really cared about the coin anyway.
You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.<eos> Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.<eos> As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.<eos> Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go ahead, open it.<eos> "Congratulations.<eos> "The bearer of this certificate is entitled "to the ultimate train experience "at The Nevada Northern Railway.<eos> "You are at the throttle.

You know exactly who I'm talking about, Reddington.<eos> Isabella Stone.<eos> She's perfectly safe.<eos> I have every intention of returning her to your custody as soon as she's given me - the information I need.<eos> - You've gone too far.<eos> I just came from Main Justice.<eos> They threatened to shut us down.<eos> - They're bluffing.<eos> - Are they?<eos> From their point of view, you've become a bigger liability than an asset.
Hands! Keep 'em up!<eos> Keep 'em up!<eos> Find where he's transmitting from. Get the location to Ressler.<eos> Tell him to breach.<eos> Well... you're a many of many skills, Mister...<eos> Well, whoever you are, I need those skills.<eos> Count me out.<eos> Like him?<eos> I know who you are, and that you're willing to kill me if you have to.<eos> But you don't know who I am.
The man is one of the great living artists.<eos> He rarely does portraits.<eos> He's very selective in who he portrays with his brush.<eos> David, it's a painting.<eos> What I'm talking about is life and death.<eos> The last three paintings he's done... One is hanging in the Whitney, one is in the Tate Modern, one is in the Pompidou.<eos> I could be hanging in the Pompidou if you would just get the hell out of my house.<eos> Now go, please.<eos> - I owe you an apology.<eos> - You can't come in here! - I lied to you.

Come si dice... kidnapping.<eos> You speak Italian?<eos> - There was a girl.<eos> - Of course there was.<eos> Tell Polpetto I'm a great admirer of his work.<eos> Not so much his nudes.<eos> They're a hair splayed for my tastes.<eos> And that I do apologize, but I require his services.<eos> What you are witnessing, Warden, are solid titanium rods traveling at Mach 7...<eos> - Who are you?
Based on this, it seems like the only way you will is if you do.<eos> I just want to know, what was there to gain from me disappearing?<eos> And why was it so important that someone confess to my murder?<eos> And whoever wrote this, what could they possibly want?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Harold, it troubles me that you're dissatisfied with the results of our efforts.<eos> Doing good for selfish reasons doesn't make you good.<eos> It just makes you good at being selfish.<eos> I'm sorry about your daughter.<eos> You've never spoken of her around me, which of course I understand, but... you've seemed... anxious of late.
I know, dear.<eos> I don't want to, but what choice do I have?<eos> I can't trust you to stay if you're not sedated.<eos> You might try and run off again.<eos> We're not there yet, but we will be.<eos> I know we will.<eos> It's gonna happen.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who are you?
You might try and run off again.<eos> We're not there yet, but we will be.<eos> I know we will.<eos> It's gonna happen.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who put you in there?<eos> Is this a sick joke?<eos> You did!
You were in bad shape. Well, worse shape.<eos> You try to hide it, but you're scared.<eos> I wasn't just gonna leave you.<eos> Well, it was remarkably generous given that I locked you in the trunk of a car.<eos> Well, you were pretty polite about it, all things considered.<eos> I've been poisoned.<eos> By someone close to me.<eos> I need to figure out by who.<eos> What happened last night, I can't remember.<eos> You and your friend broke into the apartment across the hall.

It was all busted in, and there you were.<eos> I said, "the police are on their way,"<eos> and you said, "my sincerest apologies,"
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You've been on the hook, what, two, three years? Waiting for him to leave Helen for you.<eos> You finally figured out that the only way that you'd ever be with him was over Helen's dead body.<eos> And so you made a plan.<eos> Poisoned her.<eos> I'm not saying anything until I have a lawyer.<eos> She's in a coma.<eos> Robert hasn't left her side.<eos> Guess he changed his mind. That's not true.<eos> Well, he told us that you poisoned his wife.
Do you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then you love that person.<eos> Because that's who I am.<eos> I understand that the work we do depends on you. So I'm going to allow this, but understand this...<eos> We are sworn officers of the law.<eos> Do not expect us again to carry your water.<eos> You work for us, not the other way around. Is that clear?<eos> I'm sorry to have put you in such a difficult position, Harold.<eos> Who are you?
Who are you?<eos> Losing someone we love is painful.<eos> Agonizing even unto death.<eos> The Japanese call it tako-tsubo... a grieving surge of... abnormal electrical waves that causes the heart to deflate... and contort until it resembles a... a fishing pot.<eos> Hollow and cold, an empty vessel at the... bottom of a fathomless sea.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> You have suffered enough of that in your life.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The man you killed at the massage parlor... was an associate of mine.<eos> You didn't know him, you didn't rob him.
Thank you, Ryner, for all you and the Olkari have done to assist us.
Thank you, Ryner, for all you and the Olkari have done to assist us.<eos> Once we defeat Zarkon, it is my hope that we can continue to unite our forces and rebuild the once great coalition that my father, King Alfor, began.<eos> Princess, it's time.<eos> Everyone lock into position.<eos> We're taking this thing up.<eos> Princess, we are go for launch.<eos> Charging main turbine.<eos> Commander Thace, you have sent encrypted messages to outside forces.

Why do you disturb me?<eos> My apologies, sire.<eos> -I fear your singular focus has--<eos> -Has what?<eos> I've overstepped my bounds.<eos> We've apprehended a spy within our ranks.<eos> He plans something with an outside force.<eos> I suspect an attack is imminent.<eos> Let your druids find out what he knows.<eos> You will stay here.
Okay, the cloaking device is ready to go.<eos> Pidge...<eos> May I have a moment with Keith, please?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Have all the moments you like.<eos> Is there something I can help you with?<eos> I just wanted to say... the Galra, they've done terrible things.<eos> Destroyed entire civilizations.<eos> They took my family.<eos> But, in time, I've grown to consider you and the paladins my family.

I'm in.<eos> The plan is working.<eos> Keith is on board and Zarkon's fleet is on the way.<eos> The Castle of Lion defenses are up and ready to go.<eos> Starting gravity generator now.<eos> [Slav] Commencing cloak.<eos> We are tracking the Black Lion.<eos> We know this is part of a bigger plan.<eos> Where is he going?<eos> [Kolivan] Okay, you've made it to the lower communication deck.
I must connect to the Black Lion.<eos> Kolivan, I'm in.<eos> Now, what?<eos> Now, you need to reset the system, using the codes that Thace obtained.<eos> It'll be down for a dobosh.<eos> That's when we'll upload the virus.<eos> -It doesn't seem to be working.<eos> -Try it again.<eos> Keith, are you there?<eos> And now, we know you were attempting to shut down the system.

That solves one problem, but now we're trapped in here.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> There's an exit through the main power conduit.<eos> It leads to the second deck.<eos> Go, now.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm not gonna leave you.<eos> You must.<eos> I will shut down the system.<eos> Paladin, this is where my journey ends, but, as a member of Voltron, you have a bigger mission.

Now, I will take back what is mine!<eos> Summon the energy again!<eos> We must fight beside our emperor!<eos> [Shiro] All right, let's hit him with the big guns.<eos> Hunk, form shoulder cannon!<eos> Fire!<eos> Attack!<eos> [Shiro] Look out!<eos> Princess!<eos> Are you all right, Princess?
Are you all right, Princess?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> How badly is the Castle damaged?<eos> Our power levels are decimated.<eos> Communications aren't working.<eos> We can't reach the paladins.<eos> I'm afraid we can't fight anymore.<eos> We cannot give up.<eos> Did we win yet?<eos> Coran, you and Slav do what you can to get the Castle functioning again.
We cannot give up.<eos> Did we win yet?<eos> Coran, you and Slav do what you can to get the Castle functioning again.<eos> Kolivan, can you get me to the komar?<eos> It will be dangerous, but I know a way.<eos> -You and Antok come with me.<eos> We're going to have to attack the witch directly if we hope to stop that thing.<eos> Coran, the bridge is yours.<eos> No!<eos> You've been weakened by operating the teludav.
Something's wrong with Shiro.<eos> Guys, we can't let Zarkon get the Black Lion.<eos> Antok!<eos> [Pidge, faint] Keep Zarkon away from the Black Lion!<eos> [Keith, faint] Come on!<eos> We can't give up!<eos> [Hunk] I'm running out of strength, man.<eos> [Lance] Look out!<eos> -[Hunk screams] -[Pidge] Hunk!<eos> -[breathing heavily] -[Lance] Whoa... What did you do?
We can't give up!<eos> [Hunk] I'm running out of strength, man.<eos> [Lance] Look out!<eos> -[Hunk screams] -[Pidge] Hunk!<eos> -[breathing heavily] -[Lance] Whoa... What did you do?<eos> I've got Zarkon's bayard.<eos> [Keith] You mean you've got your bayard.<eos> [Shiro] We've only got a few minutes left before power returns to Zarkon's ship.<eos> Form Voltron!<eos> You're Altean?

Anyway, sorry for being such a downer lately.<eos> Thanks for listening.<eos> Who else would like to share? Hi.<eos> I'm Bonnie. I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Hi, Bonnie.<eos> First of all, I want to apologize for being late 'cause you are all very important to me.<eos> Even this woman who I've never seen before.<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - June.<eos> You are very important to me, and that is a lovely name.
No, no, no.<eos> The guy over there told me what sweetbreads were.<eos> I had to spit 'em in a plant.<eos> Spoiler alert... pancreas.<eos> Hey, green wristband, huh?<eos> Yeah, it's 50 bucks cheaper for the food only, and I'm not drinking.<eos> - So it's just me and the toddlers.<eos> - And me.<eos> Nice.<eos> So are you a green wristband just for today, or all the time?
Okay.<eos> So, um, did you bring my necklace?<eos> Oh, darn!<eos> Siri was supposed to remind me, but the bitch just hates me.<eos> I will bring it to you tomorrow.<eos> It's on my nightstand.<eos> Right next to her Bible.<eos> Excuse me, miss, do you have deconstructed Tater Tots here or, uh, just Oreos?<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, you mentioned this meeting, I thought I'd check it out.
Captain Grover, so nice of you to use the doorbell this time.<eos> Yeah, I missed you, too, Cordelia.<eos> I'm here to talk to you about one of your girls.<eos> I'm not sure where you've got your information, but I'm not in that business anymore.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, Cordelia.<eos> Who you think you're talking to?<eos> You might've changed your operation a little bit and learned to be more discreet, but, from the looks of these fancy bottles and artwork, I think you're still in business.<eos> Cordelia, if I was here to arrest you, I'd have handcuffs.<eos> And not for what you want 'em for.
I was protecting my business.<eos> Before we judge, can we just talk about the people that I'm helping, okay?<eos> These are really lonely men with tragically low self-esteem.<eos> And The Method gives them the self-confidence that they need, you know, often for the first time in their whole lives.<eos> You done?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause this is what I think.<eos> The stuff you teach these guys doesn't work... it never did.<eos> That's why you rely on girls like Vanessa to help from exposing what you really are, a con artist.

Do you believe that there's a thin line between love and hate?<eos> Because the way that you were laying into me back there, that was so over the top,<eos> I was like, Wow, maybe she likes me.<eos> I don't.<eos> Fair enough. Fair enough.<eos> Hey, just so you know, I go for more of the uninhibited, free-spirited types.<eos> Yeah, I know what you're doing.<eos> It's called negging.<eos> Right? Yeah, you're betting that my self-confidence is so fragile that I actually care about what you think of me.<eos> You prey on women's insecurities and vulnerabilities, and then you exploit that.
He came to me a couple months back.<eos> He'd just been dumped by his fiance, right?<eos> Guy was a real mess.<eos> Like, crushed.<eos> I gave him a TCB.<eos> Total Confidence Rebuild.<eos> Well, it looks like this ex-fiancée filed a restraining order against him.<eos> So this guy has a history of not taking no for an answer.<eos> So let me guess.<eos> What'd you do, hook this guy up with Vanessa?
Last chance, Neil Ware!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Is he gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just us.<eos> You're okay. You have to find him.<eos> He is crazy.<eos> We have every cop on the island looking for him, okay?<eos> He's not gonna get far.<eos> No, you don't understand.
Derek Sanders, right?<eos> Man. Right?<eos> I hear what you're saying.<eos> You guys are like, Blake Stone, I'm not that awesome.<eos> But look at me now.<eos> No, please.<eos> My God!<eos> - They shot him! - Is he dead?<eos> They shot him!<eos> Neil Ware, you're under arrest.
Can I be serious for a second?<eos> Please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You saved my life. Okay.<eos> Well, don't let it go to your head.<eos> I was just doing my job.<eos> I'm ready to get serious about my life.<eos> You know, I want a committed relationship.<eos> And you seem like someone I could maybe go the distance with, Kono.
Oh, nothing.<eos> It's just a good day to be alive or appear to be alive.<eos> Kyle, may I have a word?<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> Well, that's Bogey, sir.<eos> Mostly.<eos> What's it doing in here?<eos> It's healing your pain, Ed.<eos> Ah.<eos> We all know how much you loved him.
It's not that he doesn't love the dog.<eos> It's just that...<eos> Bogey's a Horcrux.<eos> You mean like in "Harry Potter"?<eos> No way.<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> So, there's a piece of your soul in Bogey?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> So, you're just like Voldemort.
Not special like he...<eos> He-He's just a special kid.<eos> And if you can't see that, you can burn in hell.<eos> Okay. Well, I wish you luck.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I wish you luck, because your school is a mess.<eos> Have you met the other two Pemberton kids you've educated?<eos> - Yes, I know Chip and Sabrina. - Yeah.<eos> Well, this place has just about ruined them.<eos> You're running a crap factory here, pal.
Ugh! Look at this kid.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> That kid sucks.<eos> Sucks, sucks.<eos> This is a great school to come to if you want your kid to suck.<eos> Oh, look, here comes another guy.<eos> You suck! Well, it's the middle of the school year.<eos> I think you're gonna find it very difficult to find any school<eos> - that's willing to... - No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're not the only game in town, buddy, okay?
You've got security.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> That's exactly why Ben needs to go here.<eos> It's a good school.<eos> And he was happy here.<eos> Please, if you don't take him back, I might have to home school him. And I will ruin him.<eos> Please don't let me do that.<eos> All right, fine, fine.<eos> Ben can return to Lockwood. You cannot.<eos> - You got it.
Please don't let me do that.<eos> All right, fine, fine.<eos> Ben can return to Lockwood. You cannot.<eos> - You got it.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Okay. All right.<eos> One last thing, please cut the kid some slack on his outfits, okay?<eos> He's gender fluid. He's what?<eos> He's gender fluid.<eos> You're an educator.
In Soviet times, my papa was turned into, um... how you call?<eos> Drinking cripple.<eos> Alcoholic.<eos> He was not very gentle to my mother.<eos> So to help my mother,<eos> I had to, um I had to do a lot of things to survive.<eos> Life has not been easy for me.<eos> Hey. We've all had to do things to survive.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> You see what you did?
She tears me down, I build myself back up again.<eos> I got to be honest. I'm running out of building supplies.<eos> Well, I'm sorry you're doing so much building, but it's actually Sabrina who's being bullied.<eos> Come again?<eos> It seems that she has been excommunicated from her friend group, and since she is quite possibly our most popular student, it's had a ripple effect on our entire ecosystem.<eos> All right, are we talking about the same Sabrina?<eos> Dark hair?<eos> Pretty in - a terrifying kind of way?<eos> - I've spoken to her. She won't open up.<eos> You're her aunt. Perhaps you can get through to her.
- Hey, Mickey? - Hmm?<eos> Thanks for the sandwich.<eos> You got it.<eos> I think that went great.<eos> Hey, Doc, you got to help me.<eos> Come on, let's go inside<eos> - and pop this thing out. - Sir, you need to take your hands off me.<eos> No, come on.<eos> What do you want to hear, that I was wrong?<eos> That I'm wrong and you're right?
- You saved reality itself.<eos> - Well, you were there, too.<eos> Yes, but I've realized that there's nothing further for me to teach you.<eos> - Any of you.<eos> - So, what?<eos> You're just gonna walk out of here and not say good-bye?<eos> I was going to borrow the jump ship, actually.<eos> I think Mick would call that stealing.<eos> Well, maybe Mr. Rory has had somewhat of an affect on me.<eos> And you on me, Captain.
What was your relationship like with the tenant,<eos> Dan Llewellyn?<eos> Frosty.<eos> I mean, rest his soul, but... what a royal pain in the ass.<eos> How so?<eos> Dan was looking to break his lease, move in with his girlfriend.<eos> But he had eight months left.<eos> - What was her name?<eos> - Vivica something.<eos> You got a couple of properties with code violations.
I'm Angie McCallister, from Reynolds, the LGBT home next door.<eos> Kyle was one of ours.<eos> Kyle was released two weeks ago.<eos> His mother passed away a year ago.<eos> He and his father were always at odds.<eos> Six months ago, he tried to take his own life, and he was placed with us.<eos> We'd been working with Kyle and his dad.<eos> They'd come so far.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, did you have any issue with the tenant next door?
I can do both at the same time.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Dan Llewellyn stood up for a few gay teens a week and a half ago...<eos> Punched a grown bully who was threatening them.<eos> Harlan Betts.<eos> Betts left, but pissed.<eos> You and Erin.<eos> The guy punched me, and I'm the one in hot water?<eos> Why don't you go arrest him?<eos> Maybe because you're the one that likes to taunt teenagers.
How long have you been seeing Bill?<eos> Six months.<eos> He tell you what he did for a living?<eos> Finance.<eos> He tell you he was married before?<eos> Married still?<eos> No.<eos> We love each other.<eos> We're moving into a new house together.<eos> And why do you keep talking about him in the past tense?
What happened?<eos> The gun that killed Curt Framingham belongs to you.<eos> And your brother was in your house last night.<eos> He had access.<eos> Rafi doesn't even know the combination.<eos> It's 7-14-90.<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> You don't think he could figure that out?<eos> Look.<eos> You found out Bill or Curt or whatever he called himself was married, you got angry.
Just tell me what you know.<eos> Do you know that your husband had another name before he met you?<eos> Forrester.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> You should start moving on.<eos> I've got to get back upstairs.<eos> Well, your sister says you and her fiancé were at her place last night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He stayed for an hour, then left.<eos> What, so you followed him back out to the suburbs, see his big house, his wife?
We know exactly what happened.<eos> Doused him in paint thinner, pulled the gas hose, went to class like nothing happened.<eos> Man, I would never do that.<eos> Sure you would.<eos> You already have.<eos> Like that time in Florida you took a baseball bat to a guy 'cause he tried to steal a package off your porch.<eos> No.<eos> I've changed.<eos> I didn't hurt Bill.<eos> All right, then explain it to us, 'cause you were the last person with the guy.
Who are you?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Come on, little sweet thing.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Look at your little face.<eos> Come on.<eos> Marvin?<eos> Marvin, I got a present for ya.<eos> Rosie!<eos> You found my Rosie-Rosie!

Look at your little face.<eos> Come on.<eos> Marvin?<eos> Marvin, I got a present for ya.<eos> Rosie!<eos> You found my Rosie-Rosie!<eos> Rosie!<eos> You found her.<eos> You found my Rosie!<eos> How did you... how did you find her?
I want a lawyer as well.<eos> That's fine. We have plenty enough to ring you up on as it is, so you don't need to say anything, but you are gonna listen.<eos> Leon Tremaine.<eos> Also known as Jupiter.<eos> He was a boxer who almost made the Olympic team in 2000.<eos> All the fighting gave him brain damage and turned him homeless.<eos> He wandered to Chicago all the way from Indiana.<eos> He had just reconnected with his daughter, who'd been looking for him for ten years.<eos> That's who your husband put a bullet into.<eos> That's who you put a bullet into, because you're gonna get charged the same.
He lost his mom right before his dad kicked him out of the house... twice, and he was coming back to the only place that had ever treated him well when he died in the fire you guys rigged.<eos> That's how Kyle died.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Look at him!<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> You don't know what hurting is.<eos> Do you want me to show you?<eos> I'd be happy to.<eos> Just nod your head at me.<eos> You knew the Feds were closing in, so you decided to fake your husband's funeral.
Hey, hope you feel better soon.<eos> That doesn't sound like the whole family.<eos> Hey, hope those eyes get better soon, Pop. It's me, Peter.<eos> Shipoopi.<eos> Oh, thanks for coming, Peter.<eos> I-I'm here, too, Grandpa.<eos> And, uh, and Meg went down to-to put money in the meter.<eos> Aw, I don't care.<eos> Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt, your vision will be impaired for a few weeks while you recover.<eos> I recommend you and your wife have someone around to help you during this time.
Yes.<eos> And you guys have to let me.<eos> You feel better?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> He's not giving us anything.<eos> He may not have anything to give us.<eos> No. No, I can't live with that.<eos> You might not have a choice, Mr. Deeks.<eos> That is awful rich, Hetty, considering you're the person that put her in this position in the first place.
That's not gonna happen.<eos> How'd you get in here?<eos> You must be Eric.<eos> This is Hetty's I.D. How'd you get this?<eos> She gave it to me.<eos> This place is on lockdown. I can tell. You've done a fine job of securing this location.<eos> Are you mocking me?<eos> - Should I be?<eos> - No. Then take the compliment.<eos> Okay, thank you.
- No. Then take the compliment.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Who are you? A.J. Chegwidden.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Two D's.<eos> Admiral.<eos> Retired.<eos> You gave me quite a scare. That's some grip.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Me? You. You got the whole arm.
Well, I didn't hit her that hard.<eos> Go either way.<eos> A.J., I had questions I needed to ask her.<eos> What, did you want me to let her shoot you first?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Just gonna have a hell of a hangover, a nasty concussion, but she'll survive.<eos> How you doing?<eos> My head.<eos> What happened?<eos> Who are you?
Details.<eos> Where is Miss Blye?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is Officer Ferris?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I swear.<eos> Joelle. What the hell happened?<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Or that.<eos> And you are?
Especially since it's a snitch's relative and not the actually snitch.<eos> Come on, Sergeant, I made a promise.<eos> I made a promise too, Detective.<eos> I promised to truly serve our sovereign county and state as a police officer without favor, affection, malice, or ill will!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> So I, had a PI friend look into Rebecca's case.<eos> Omar Fry, he was cleared on all charges.<eos> You... you do know that, right?
So I, had a PI friend look into Rebecca's case.<eos> Omar Fry, he was cleared on all charges.<eos> You... you do know that, right?<eos> Yeah, that's what the detective said.<eos> You know, with the murder rate here, what the hell do Chicago cops know, right?<eos> All right.<eos> But now if it turns out that this Fry isn't the guy, you know, you don't get a refund?<eos> I know in my heart he did it.<eos> All right, I'm gonna need, 10% up front for a new barrel and a set of wheels.<eos> You know, you already have a gun.
All right, I'm gonna need, 10% up front for a new barrel and a set of wheels.<eos> You know, you already have a gun.<eos> Why can't you just get this over with?<eos> Listen, you want this not be traced back to us?<eos> I'm gonna need an untraceable gun, and I'm not gonna pull up in my own personal vehicle to do this, all right?<eos> Look, it's your job, it's fine.<eos> That's 5,000.<eos> I think I've got it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, so, just so we understand each other, once you start this, there's no turning back.
Then you should be able to tell us where we found the .45 that killed Rebecca Clark.<eos> All right, look, look, is any operation 100% ironclad?<eos> You know, maybe a few guns fell through the cracks, we lost track, but we have made over 80 felony arrests so far.<eos> What's important here is the victim.<eos> We're in agreement on that same page.<eos> So what can we do to help?<eos> I need the reports on everyone you sold guns to and every piece of surveillance you got.<eos> So you're gonna jeopardize our whole operation?<eos> Your operation is jeopardized.<eos> You're through in my city.
Man, I just sling drinks.<eos> What, like a nine millimeter with a .380 chaser?<eos> Remember this?<eos> That's you and Thomas Kade.<eos> You're buying 23 guns.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> Kade is an ATF agent.<eos> You telling me that gacked-out white boy was a cop?<eos> That's right.<eos> And one of the guns you sold was used to murder this young woman,
You're buying 23 guns.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> Kade is an ATF agent.<eos> You telling me that gacked-out white boy was a cop?<eos> That's right.<eos> And one of the guns you sold was used to murder this young woman,<eos> Rebecca Clark.<eos> Everybody wants a strap.<eos> So I sell them on the side for a little bit of cash, but I ain't never shot at nobody in my life.<eos> All right. Then who'd you sell it to?
Set up a fake hit that you can show Donald Clark.<eos> Get him on tape giving you the rest of the money.<eos> Listen, Hank, I think I got through to Clark.<eos> - I think he might back out of this thing.<eos> - Al.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Remember the Family Secrets sting?<eos> When I had to cover you in, what, two gallons of pigs blood over you because you were supposed to be stabbed to death?<eos> Hey, so did Detective Lindsay explain everything to you?<eos> Yeah, I'm supposed to get dolled up like I'm dead, and you're gonna take pictures.
What happened was this:<eos> I saw you becoming unhinged after the incident.<eos> You were having a panic attack.<eos> I brought you whiskey to calm your nerves.<eos> Do it.<eos> With any luck, somebody will catch it on camera.<eos> You can introduce it at your trial as Exhibit A.<eos> You almost shot a kid, Bill.<eos> He snuck out to go to a party.<eos> You evidently caught him sneaking back in.

Hey, boss.<eos> Hey.<eos> Odell!<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> You know how the old man feels about you sitting in his special chair.<eos> Out you go.<eos> Odell!<eos> Come on.<eos> Good boy!<eos> You know, you could use a dog.
Do you still have full access to the police department?<eos> Well, actually, no.<eos> The Department feel I've gone a bit batshit over this case.<eos> Have you?<eos> A little.<eos> Have you shown them the letter you received?<eos> - Not yet, no.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I suppose I lack confidence that they'll act on it.<eos> You plan to act on it.
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> Letting Flynn murder through time?<eos> - That's madness.<eos> - In the beginning, I thought it was important, that it could hopefully even bring my wife back to me, but no matter what I do, nothing gets better.<eos> - Hello, beautiful.<eos> - You're engaged to some doctor you don't even know.<eos> Rittenhouse is in control of Mason Industries.<eos> We'll have the capability to pinpoint anyone, anywhere, anytime you want.<eos> What you are a part of is inhuman.
I used to. But now I just think that you're sad, and you're lonely.<eos> I think you're a broken person... who misses the people that they love, just like me, just like Wyatt.<eos> Don't talk about my family like you know them.<eos> You want to stop Rittenhouse, we'll help you.<eos> But not like this.<eos> How?<eos> You don't know. Because there is no other way.<eos> Good-bye, Lucy.<eos> I'm Senator Joseph McCarthy.<eos> And you're a communist spy.
Immoral?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, you can thank me later.<eos> But instead of searching for our intrepid time travelers, I found... this.<eos> Everything you've ever wanted to know about Benjamin Cahill.<eos> Enough to convict him seven times over.<eos> See, anyone, even you, can play the crusading cop, but I was playing the long game.<eos> Rittenhouse thinks we were playing checkers while I was playing 3D chess.<eos> Why are you telling me all this?<eos> Because... you're dull, but honest.
You know, you never told me where you got it from.<eos> You gave it to me.<eos> - Uh, no, I didn't.<eos> - Well, not yet.<eos> Take it from me: you age surprisingly well.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> On your knees!<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> Hands behind your back! Hold it right there.<eos> - You followed me?
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> According to your own words, serial killers are predominantly male.<eos> Obviously, things have changed.<eos> Did you ever think of getting help?<eos> What about you, Alicia?
This way.<eos> My name is Danny Williams.<eos> I'm from Jersey, so I'm obviously a very big fan.<eos> Jersey?<eos> What brings you out to Hawaii?<eos> My... my ex, my ex-wife, she-she came out here.<eos> She brought my daughter.<eos> So I joined the HPD.<eos> Wanted to be close to her. My wife...<eos> Not my wife, my ex. You know what I mean.
Sorry about Danny.<eos> He... doesn't usually get awkward like this.<eos> It's all right. - It's Jersey. It's Jersey.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Listen, man, it's-it's, um... it's-it's really great to meet you.<eos> I just want you to know I saw you in the Garden. 1988. Tunnel of Love Tour.<eos> You know that, obviously.<eos> And I snuck in with my buddy, Ricky Schwartz.<eos> We couldn't afford tickets, so we snuck in through the loading area.<eos> You and Ricky snuck in?
You said she had blood on her hands? Yeah.<eos> She also says she has no idea how it got there.<eos> In fact, she has no recollection at all of the last 24 hours.<eos> We sent a sample of the blood over to the lab for DNA testing.<eos> We could be looking for a body.<eos> I didn't think I was gonna see you again.<eos> I'm sorry, have we met before?<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> You're not Madison Gray.

It is just us.<eos> You're not gonna hurt me, Alicia.<eos> There's a guard right outside that door, and they pat you down before they let you in here.<eos> Yeah. They did.<eos> Just not well enough.<eos> Shall we try this again, because I don't care what kind of game it is you're playing... it ends now.<eos> You are gonna tell me what is happening, or I am gonna slit your throat right here in this room.<eos> It's not that easy, Alicia.<eos> It takes a certain type of person to take someone's life.<eos> I don't know if you have it in you.

When I heard that I was receiving a visitor from Hawaii...<eos> I so hoped it was my old friend,<eos> Alicia Brown.<eos> Maybe you recognize this old friend,<eos> Dr. Madison Gray...<eos> You might know her as Lauren Parker.<eos> According to the log, she visited you here once a week for the past four months.<eos> Groupies.<eos> They can never get enough.<eos> You orchestrated. Sienna Brown's murder from inside this prison.
Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll find her, Alicia.<eos> You're gonna find her when she wants to be found, Steve.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Stay in touch.<eos> I will.<eos> Hello, Alicia.<eos> What do you want?
Hello, Alicia.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To finish the game.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Shoot me.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> I didn't think that you had what it takes, either.<eos> That's why you have other people kill for you... So that you can feel powerful and in control.<eos> But the truth is... you just don't have the guts.<eos> I like a challenge, don't you?
That's why you have other people kill for you... So that you can feel powerful and in control.<eos> But the truth is... you just don't have the guts.<eos> I like a challenge, don't you?<eos> That was a good game, but not much of a challenge.<eos> You, on the other hand... Moral, virtuous, you've spent your life putting killers behind bars... Turning you into a killer... now, that would really be something.<eos> You think I'm gonna kill for you?<eos> Going to jail, I suppose, could be hard.<eos> And after such a happy reunion with Sienna.<eos> But she will visit you.<eos> Certainly more than you visited her.
Certainly more than you visited her.<eos> I'm not gonna kill anyone for you.<eos> You will.<eos> Here, you'll need this.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't move, or I will shoot you.<eos> I think this time, you actually will.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Pull the trigger.<eos> You're insane.
I'll make sure of it.<eos> This seems easy for you.<eos> I mean, I know you've taught this, but you haven't done anything like this in decades.<eos> Well, that's why it's so easy.<eos> I've spent 20 years with my wings clipped, not being allowed to be the man I knew I really was.<eos> Now I can.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Big day.<eos> You brought friends.<eos> And you are...
Tell us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.<eos> I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.<eos> And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.<eos> I'll wait for your funeral, you right-wing sellout.<eos> Hands where I can see them.<eos> Who are you?
It was only later that we were able to determine that actually this code was targeted specifically at Iran's uranium enrichment plant in Natanz.<eos> Uranium enrichment facilities are very secure facilities. It's not like they're connected to the Internet.<eos> You can't get your code in and out in that way.<eos> So one of the ways Stuxnet was able to get into the facility was via USB key.<eos> So it was able to infect USB keys, and then somebody would bring USB key with them into the secure facility, not realizing it was infected, plug it into a computer inside, and then that computer inside would be infected.<eos> You know, we don't know definitively who is behind Stuxnet, but it's very clear that it's a nation-state, and it's nation-states that had something against Iran. And it's likely that it isn't a single nation-state.<eos> You have to remember as well with cyber warfare that the sort of barrier to entry is quite low.<eos> If a country wants to do something like build a nuclear missile, that's actually quite difficult. But when you talk about something like cyber warfare, it's actually quite cheap and quite easy for a country to develop a cyber weapon.<eos> And that cyber weapon can have equivalent effects.<eos> You could have a cyber weapon potentially shut down the power grid, for example, on the whole East Coast.

Wall Street is out. All your banks are out.<eos> You can't even withdraw money.<eos> You know, you can imagine people, panic starting, and people trying to get cash.<eos> You can't get cash. ATMs aren't working. Then things like your water waste treatment plants aren't working.<eos> So, no clean water, there's going to be a run on stores. Stores potentially aren't even operating.<eos> Your credit card's not going to work at the store. There'd be absolutely mass panic.<eos> If you can blind the US military, if you could shut down our GPS and our computer networks, our military is basically unable to function. And it could take days or weeks to get those systems back up and running.
Are you thinking about getting a boat?<eos> What, are you out of your mind?<eos> You should do it.<eos> Nothing like being rocked to sleep by the ocean. - Yes.<eos> - All right, well, I closed up the wound, but he's gonna have to remove these staples in a week or so.<eos> Noelani, thank you very much for coming up.<eos> We really appreciate it.<eos> As I mentioned before, Commander, I'm very happy to help out whenever I can, but are these house calls gonna become a regular thing?<eos> Because emergency medicine isn't really what I do. Wait.<eos> What do you do?
You should listen to this guy.<eos> He knows what he's talking about.<eos> He put you up to saying that. I know he did.<eos> He wants me to die on the job with him instead of retiring, huh?<eos> I got no idea what you're talking about. Oh.<eos> Okay, uh, what's going on?<eos> I got a theory, all right?<eos> What if it wasn't a coincidence that Celine got grabbed where she did?<eos> I mean the location and the exact time.<eos> Harry, you were tailing her a couple of weeks.

Didn't seem relevant to my case at the time, so I didn't ID her.<eos> All right, how about a description?<eos> I can do better than that.<eos> I got a picture of her.<eos> A picture? You got it on you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is this, Harry?<eos> Old school.<eos> I got to tell you it's quite the buzz to meet another fan of analog tech, mm-hmm.<eos> So what do you shoot on?
I can do better than that.<eos> I got a picture of her.<eos> A picture? You got it on you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is this, Harry?<eos> Old school.<eos> I got to tell you it's quite the buzz to meet another fan of analog tech, mm-hmm.<eos> So what do you shoot on?<eos> Pentax, Nikon, Hasselblad, Canon?<eos> What do you got, some kind of weird license plate fetish?
Yeah.<eos> What is this, Harry?<eos> Old school.<eos> I got to tell you it's quite the buzz to meet another fan of analog tech, mm-hmm.<eos> So what do you shoot on?<eos> Pentax, Nikon, Hasselblad, Canon?<eos> What do you got, some kind of weird license plate fetish?<eos> Oh, no, I just keep a record of all the cars that park outside my house.<eos> Naturally.<eos> And you are, again...
Naturally.<eos> And you are, again...<eos> Jerry.<eos> Jerry Ortega.<eos> Five-O special consultant.<eos> You on medication, Jerry?<eos> No. Why?<eos> No reason.<eos> Yeah, I mean, these days with high-res camera phones and all the filters, everyone's a photographer, right?<eos> It's cool that you still do it the old-school way.
You on medication, Jerry?<eos> No. Why?<eos> No reason.<eos> Yeah, I mean, these days with high-res camera phones and all the filters, everyone's a photographer, right?<eos> It's cool that you still do it the old-school way.<eos> You know, with f-stops and ISOs.<eos> I mean, it's not just an aesthetic choice for me.<eos> These days, you can't be too careful.<eos> I mean, digital files can be hacked and manipulated and shared.<eos> You know that, and that's why you work on film.
What-- this is a private conversation.<eos> Rachel's still in...<eos> Obviously.<eos> Hey, you got to admit, I called this.<eos> When are you and the ex gonna get back together?<eos> No, Harry, we're not gonna get back together, uh, for a lot of reasons.<eos> Most important being that I have a girlfriend that I like very much. Okay?<eos> I didn't hear the word "love," did you, Steve?<eos> Harry, you know what?<eos> You don't know anything!

Dude, this is crazy.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't know the, the specifics and you're not, you don't, just... butt out, please.
Okay. Breathe.<eos> We got a bomb tech coming out right now.<eos> We're gonna get this vest off of you;<eos> look at me.<eos> I'm right here with you, okay?<eos> We're gonna breathe together.<eos> Okay. You're doing great.<eos> All right, go, go. Go, go.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're okay.

Yeah. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You ready?<eos> Hello?<eos> You're testing our patience, Mr. Stratham.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I-I had nothing to do with the, the police showing up at that house.<eos> Look, I have the money...<eos> I talk.<eos> You listen.
Please don't!<eos> I-I have money!<eos> I have money!<eos> What the hell am I doing here?<eos> For starters, I wanted you to know what it really feels like to be kidnapped.<eos> To be grabbed, and hooded, and thrown into a trunk of a car.<eos> Was that scary, Celine?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You see, there was something about the way that you were abducted that gnawed at me.<eos> When they put you in the car, they put you in the back and you just cooperated, like a good little girl.
I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You see, there was something about the way that you were abducted that gnawed at me.<eos> When they put you in the car, they put you in the back and you just cooperated, like a good little girl.<eos> Now, Natasha, on the other hand, when they grabbed her, she was struggling.<eos> Fighting for her life.<eos> She put up the kind of commotion that people take notice of.<eos> So they put her in the trunk where nobody could see her.<eos> And then there were the ligature marks on her wrist, put there by the kidnappers.<eos> See, they tied that rope tight around her wrists so that she couldn't get away.<eos> But you, Celine, they knew you weren't gonna get away.
You knew I was tailing you, that's why you acted like a good girl.<eos> You made sure I only saw what you wanted me to see.<eos> The kidnapping, not the boyfriend.<eos> What boyfriend?<eos> Well, Colin Hanson.<eos> Well, if he's not your boyfriend, he's pretty confused.<eos> When we picked him up about an hour ago, outside terminal three, Honolulu International, he was waiting for you.<eos> So we got his phone.<eos> We found texts, voicemails, pictures of the two of you.<eos> That is you, right?
See right there, that's your problem.<eos> Tryin' to control people, places and things you can't do anything about.<eos> What you need to do is write down a list of all your fears, and then just turn them over - to your higher power, who's...<eos> - Marjorie, she's gone again.<eos> But again, dynamite stuff.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> Are you Danielle Janikowski?<eos> I am.<eos> And you are?
But again, dynamite stuff.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> Are you Danielle Janikowski?<eos> I am.<eos> And you are?<eos> Bonnie Plunkett.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, it appears he has a type.<eos> Oh. Or you and I do.
Bonnie Plunkett.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, it appears he has a type.<eos> Oh. Or you and I do.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what brings you by?<eos> An-and just so you know, I've already pressed nine-one on my phone.<eos> Relax.<eos> If I wanted to rough you up, I would have waited inside.<eos> You've got great taste in furniture, by the way.

- Okay, are we done?<eos> - Oh, we're just getting started.<eos> Actually, I only have one more question, so, yeah, we're almost done.<eos> - Why'd you two break up?<eos> - Well, why don't you ask him?<eos> Because I respect the boundaries of people I care about.<eos> - You just broke into my house.<eos> - Yeah, I don't care about you.<eos> Wow.<eos> - You really love him, don't you?

Wow.<eos> - You really love him, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> Why else would I risk squeezing through your doggy door with a full bladder?<eos> It is possible that you're just insane.<eos> It is. Keep that in mind.<eos> So, what happened?<eos> He cheat on you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You cheat on him?
- Of course I do.<eos> Why else would I risk squeezing through your doggy door with a full bladder?<eos> It is possible that you're just insane.<eos> It is. Keep that in mind.<eos> So, what happened?<eos> He cheat on you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You cheat on him?<eos> - What did he tell you?<eos> - Not as much as you just did.
If Joel lands on Stomach Churn, he'll have the points to eliminate Maki and Japan from the game.<eos> Going for the Point Thruster.<eos> He's got it.<eos> Well, he's got the Point Thruster, but that won't matter if he can't navigate back to the platform.<eos> Whoa, he is really shaky up there, barely holding on.<eos> Germany! Germany! Germany!<eos> Disaster averted for Joel!<eos> And Maki and Japan are out of the competition.<eos> Yeah, take a break, brother!<eos> You earned that one.
Germany! Germany! Germany!<eos> Disaster averted for Joel!<eos> And Maki and Japan are out of the competition.<eos> Yeah, take a break, brother!<eos> You earned that one.<eos> - He is celebrating himself. - That's right!<eos> One thing he has to remember is the rotation.<eos> The longer he rests, the worse it's gonna get for him.<eos> - Oh, he's dizzy.<eos> - You think?
What a way to end Level 3!<eos> Emmanuel Chiang and Steven Tucker have the highest point totals and will be headed to the final level.<eos> Before the action starts, let's check in with our two finalists.<eos> I'm not having any doubts.<eos> I'm going to go and give it my all.<eos> Strength, to me, is what you can do with your body, not necessarily how it looks.<eos> It doesn't matter what you look like if you can't do anything cool.<eos> He's got it!<eos> I'm a proud man, I don't like losing.<eos> I'm winning, I'm dominating you, you'll be mine, okay?

Both competitors now making the transition to the second part of the power source of Grid Lock.<eos> Grid Lock has these small cracks and very, very little room to find anywhere for your fingers and your feet to go, - so we will see how they fare.<eos> - Emmanuel Chiang is not out.<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> You can recover, but you do not want to get too far behind.<eos> Steven Tucker's doing a nice job, finding a way to get his feet wedged in that tiny little crack.<eos> Look at that.<eos> He just hit another one.<eos> We've got a race right now!<eos> You're so close, almost there!
- USA!<eos> - Steven Tucker is tonight's Beastmaster.<eos> - Whoo-hoo! He goes home with $10,000.<eos> He's also earned a spot in the finals and an opportunity to win $50,000 and that highly-coveted title of Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> I honestly didn't think that I would make it this far, and to make it to the championship, I'm super stoked.<eos> My son, he's six years old. He loves all of this stuff.<eos> I can't wait to watch with him.<eos> He's going to be stoked.<eos> I can't wait to get home and see him.<eos> Now, if you're like me, I'm sure you can't get enough of Ultimate Beastmaster, so there'll be 12 more competitors coming back for our next episode.
The Beast does not respect you or any country that you are from.
Who will challenge this champion?<eos> Let's find out on Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Sorry, folks, we don't have the Beauty.<eos> All we have is the Beast.<eos> Terry, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.<eos> Oh, wow, I just got that.<eos> - Yep. Yep.<eos> Yep. Yep. - Okay, that's...<eos> - It's a bad joke. - That hurt.<eos> That's why you're the comedian.
And speaking of competitors, they're still celebrating Yuji's amazing run.<eos> It's times like these that I'm proud to be Japanese.<eos> An excellent show!<eos> Well, let's not hand tonight's $10,000 prize over to Yuji so quickly, 'cause we've got some Americans who think they can give him a run for his money.<eos> From Los Angeles, is former professional soccer player Cortni Joyner.<eos> Cortni's years on the soccer field gave her imposing leg strength and agility that will be key to powering her to victory.<eos> You've gotta be certain kind of crazy to play professional soccer right out of college.<eos> You're getting stiff-armed in the head by girls that are 5'10" constantly.<eos> That's what makes me the kind of athlete that I am.<eos> If you can lift heavier than me, I can run faster than you, and lift close enough to you to beat you when it comes time.
Since we have no dog in the fight because, unfortunately, our two US competitors were knocked out of Level 1, are you going for South Korea, Germany, Brazil?<eos> I'm flying back over to South Korea.<eos> Back on to South Korea!<eos> No, you know, wait.<eos> I'm staying in Germany.<eos> I decided to stay in Germany.<eos> Give me your passport, sir.<eos> I am stamping "Germany."<eos> That is who you are riding with.<eos> I'm gonna hold you to that.
And there he goes.<eos> All right!<eos> That tallest platform is 27 feet high, and the vertical distance between the platforms ranges anywhere from four and a half feet to eight feet.<eos> That's the attempt he'll be making right now, is eight feet.<eos> There he is.<eos> He actually caught it at the right time.<eos> I think he caught it at the right time.<eos> You just have to get those legs over, and once you get them over, don't take them down!<eos> He makes his way to Spinal Descent.<eos> Terry, this guy has done everything in the fitness world you can think of: martial arts, weightlifting, gymnastics, capoeira.
I mean, he does a full split in mid-air, and gets the Point Thruster.<eos> That was impressive, and it got him 20 points, as he makes his way into Stomach Churn.<eos> Oh, no...<eos> He's gotta be careful.<eos> He earned the name "Sonic" back home, and now we can see why.<eos> He just blazed through that obstacle like a video game hedgehog.<eos> I'm not sure he knows where he is right now, after that landing.<eos> He's kind of shaking off the cobwebs now.<eos> He wants to hear it!<eos> You are the best!
Now, I know that as a Marine, this guy has trained on his fair share of obstacle courses.<eos> Let's see if that experience helps him here.<eos> He did it!<eos> Only 5'6", but tremendous jumping ability.<eos> When I was a kid, I used to run and jump over everything, run everywhere.<eos> My mother used to tell me, "Hey, son, go back and walk."<eos> Just barely made it on there!<eos> He's got 30 points as we get our first look at the Mag Wall.<eos> He's gotta watch his hand placement.<eos> The more stretched out you are, the better position you can be in.
He might be able to do it.<eos> - USA!<eos> USA! - Get that one more handle!<eos> - USA!<eos> USA! - USA!<eos> USA! No!<eos> Almost!<eos> He had a lot of trouble with this third section.<eos> He got caught up high on that wall and really needed to continue that way.<eos> You can see he made the mistake of going for that bottom foothold, and that's a tough move for any athlete to pull off, even a Marine.
Here's Gina Castillo.<eos> My life changed when I started seeing my now ex-husband.<eos> I suffered psychological violence.<eos> He destroyed my self-esteem.<eos> It was a very tough experience.<eos> In a way, it made me click. I found out about CrossFit, and I win because I set my mind to it.<eos> If she wins, she would give any financial winnings to her parents, who supported her during her darkest time of need.<eos> I'm telling you, I love this woman.<eos> As I see it, my biggest reward is my daughter.<eos> Fanny, you're always with me... and this is for you.

- You're a total warrior!<eos> - Yay!<eos> - She's got it!<eos> She's got it!<eos> Look how strong this woman is!<eos> Let me tell you something, right now, I'm like, "Gina!<eos> Gina! Gina!"<eos> Gina! Terry, there is nothing stronger than a single mom.<eos> We are seeing that right here, right now.<eos> When you've got to raise a kid all by yourself, you learn to overcome obstacles on a daily basis, so this Beast is just another bump in the road for Gina.

I entered this competition for all the nerds out there.<eos> The people who are teased.<eos> Looking nothing like the skinny kid from his past,<eos> Michael approached Faceplant looking focused.<eos> Michael Pela, go for it, brother!<eos> But after a weak jump, his case was closed.<eos> Great potential, but the Beast is merciless.<eos> Next was gym owner Todd Wise of the USA.<eos> I'm doing the Ultimate Beastmaster for my community.<eos> I want to be inspiring for them, and I want them to know if you work really hard and you put your mind to it, you can do great things in life.
There you go!<eos> And now it's the biggest leap.<eos> He's gonna have to time it right.<eos> Oh, he comes up short!<eos> He's in a really tough position.<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> He can't afford to get stuck here.<eos> - He's almost there.<eos> - Can he make it?<eos> One of the things about this obstacle is you need to have controlled strength so that you're not just plunging toward the ground.
Oh, no, he's starting to slide!<eos> - Ah. - That's a wrap, unless he is...<eos> No, yeah, he doesn't want to give up, but those hands are not gonna have it.<eos> Into the blood!<eos> An amazing performance by Charles Robinson.<eos> This is... Watch this jump. Watch this jump.<eos> This is, like, wow!<eos> It was amazing.<eos> It was amazing. Best feeling in the world.<eos> Once you get to those chains, forearms just start tightening up.

Best feeling in the world.<eos> Once you get to those chains, forearms just start tightening up.<eos> You have nothing left.
You know what, he's moving through at a great pace, which actually helps you.<eos> He is doing really well!<eos> You think we'll see him on Level 3?<eos> And his hands are hurting, which isn't going to bode well for him in Chain Reaction, considering that's the main thing you've gotta use.<eos> Here he goes on Chain Reaction.<eos> If he gets that Point Thruster, he will tie Charles Robinson from the U.S.<eos> No, he flew right past it!<eos> So, now he at least needs to get past Chain Reaction if he wants to move in front of Charles.<eos> It looks like he's in pain.<eos> Do you think it's that injured hand?
But Spinal Ascent brought his comeback attempt...<eos> Get up there!<eos> to a quick end.<eos> Well, I gave everything I had, so I'm not upset with my efforts.<eos> It's just, it was a hard obstacle.<eos> Then it was the first Brazilian to hit Level 2, Chico Salgado.<eos> He had the craziest of runs, when he desperately and illegally grabbed the chains of the Spinal Ascent platform... Oh! Chico, no, no, no!<eos> It's a pity! Chico Salgado, with his disqualified run, is now sitting on the bubble in fifth place, and Todd Wise was the first competitor eliminated in Level 2.<eos> That's awesome, man.<eos> You fought till the end.
Makes a great transition to the Ejector, and he needs a strong leap now.<eos> He's got it...<eos> Look at the agony of defeat over here that's going on.<eos> The Brazil booth is going nuts right now.<eos> Nobody knows exactly what's going on there.<eos> - Oh, Rafinha! No!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Do you see this?<eos> - What is going on?<eos> Look at this! - Why do you have your shirt off?
We have one competitor left to go, and it's Mexico's Roberto Perez.<eos> Now, if Roberto can make the grab here on the Ejector, he'll move on to Level 4 and Philipp Hell?<eos> Well, he'll be out. It's Mexico versus Germany for the final spot.<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Level 4!<eos> Come on!<eos> Level 4!<eos> Level 4!<eos> - Come on, my Rober!<eos> - Go, Rober! You got this, brother!
Thank you, Your Holiness.<eos> You remember my assistants, Lama Samten, Lama Dote and Geshe Tashi.<eos> You can tell them apart by their auras.<eos> Buddhist humor.<eos> That's...<eos> He's...<eos> That's...<eos> - He's funny.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now, who are you, little sister?
This is Chloe.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Chloe.<eos> Your Holiness, this...<eos> Whoa! She is the wisest of us all.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, where is the sand mandala?<eos> Members of the National Buddhist Center here in D.C. anticipated your arrival.<eos> May you be at peace.<eos> May you be well.
And as for them,<eos> I ask that you endorse my choice for my successor over China's.<eos> Well, as always... the United States encourages you to achieve your goal through direct dialogue with China.<eos> When I die, the Tibetans will lose their loudest voice in this world.<eos> China will be emboldened to trample even more of our rights.<eos> U.S. policy is clear.<eos> We are officially neutral on this issue.<eos> I die knowing that I've done everything I can for my people.<eos> I have no regrets, Elizabeth.<eos> Do you?
Hang on, Jay.<eos> I have peace and light on the other line.<eos> I got to call you back.<eos> Namaste, Russell.<eos> You watching this? !<eos> Y... Yes.<eos> Where did he get this bright idea?<eos> What the hell did you say to the Lama? !<eos> Mr. Chen, the United States will not officially endorse any new Lama; You have my word.<eos> How generous, Madam Secretary, but the People's Republic needs you to publicly disavow this choice.
I practically was her only parent for six months when you couldn't get out of bed. Remember that?<eos> Because I sure as hell do!<eos> Prime Minister Verma, let me start by saying that I am open to taking a second look at some of the protocols.<eos> Since India will sacrifice the most, we believe it's only fair.<eos> Just none that increase coal emissions.<eos> The rich Western nation built on coal tells the emerging market, "It's okay when we polluted."<eos> You find a new way."<eos> A classic.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You promised to bring electricity to the 300 million Indians who live without it, and you think loosening coal restrictions will help you deliver.
Um, no, sir.<eos> They winter in South America, then travel up to 5,000 miles to their North American breeding grounds.<eos> They settle here to eat fish from the Potomac.<eos> I saw a few my first year, but... not many since.<eos> My grandchildren, well... they may never see an osprey at all.<eos> That's what scientists call shifting baseline syndrome.<eos> Each generation accepts their version of nature, plunders it, then leaves the next generation to accept the depleted version, and so on.<eos> Which brings me to us.<eos> Now.<eos> You.
Or I will kick your ass.<eos> Welcome to Washington, Senator.<eos> I received your inducements, Madam Secretary.<eos> All very generous.<eos> But we cannot accept as long as your government endorses the American Lama.<eos> And that's why I'm glad to report that Senator Morton had a change of heart.<eos> We reaffirm our neutrality.<eos> A government with conflicting opinions.<eos> I will never understand democracy.<eos> Well, you say "tomato,"
I say "let's ratify our climate deal."<eos> We'll resubmit the protocols with a new addendum for Indian solar funding.<eos> Everybody's happy.<eos> Planet saved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's just one more matter to settle.<eos> Really?<eos> Chinese Buddhist scholars have found the Dalai Lama's true reincarnation.<eos> A two-year-old boy in Sichuan Province.<eos> If you officially recognize him, we will gladly have the Standing Committee consider the protocols for ratification.
A two-year-old boy in Sichuan Province.<eos> If you officially recognize him, we will gladly have the Standing Committee consider the protocols for ratification.<eos> Ming, we-we support the PRC's right to recognize this boy as the next Lama.<eos> Just as we support Tibet's right to recognize their own boy.<eos> I'm afraid that's not good enough.<eos> Disqualify the American Lama or recognize ours.<eos> Otherwise, no deal.<eos> Do you know the mountains that President Dalton and I had to move to put this deal back together?<eos> All to do what's best for our children and grandchildren... and the other seven billion people on the planet, too.<eos> And you are putting it all on the line, trying to strong-arm us into endorsing some toddler that you are using as a political pawn!

I don't understand. I was just editing a spreadsheet.<eos> You're falsifying government records.<eos> You were covering up for your boss.<eos> - Who is he? - If you tell us, you'll be out on bail before your favorite ice cream store closes.<eos> We hear you love mint chip.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I need to get in there.<eos> Yeah. I know the feeling.<eos> ...the moment that you start naming names.<eos> No, you can't.
...the moment that you start naming names.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> It's a brazen violation of procedure.<eos> Yeah. Pale face, the rapid breathing.<eos> He's probably still in shock, which means he's vulnerable to an authority figure.<eos> I have two authority figures in there with him right now.<eos> I'm fourth in line for the presidency, and his boss.<eos> With the right approach, I can get him talking.<eos> Look, you just tell us the names we want to know, and you get to go home.<eos> It is what I did at the CIA, and it's the best play and you know it.
That's right.<eos> The embassy bombing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You helped evacuate the injured.<eos> I-I was doing my job.<eos> Is that what it was?<eos> 'Cause a guy who carries a pregnant FSO three miles to the hospital isn't just punching a clock.<eos> He's a patriot.<eos> I don't know what you've gotten yourself mixed up with, Barry.<eos> But I know that you... you didn't intend to harm the United States.

We have to reduce demand.<eos> In the case of rhino horn, the market is mostly concentrated here.<eos> In Vietnam.<eos> Oh, your thing...<eos> Your thing. Sorry.<eos> I had a pie chart for that.<eos> Fine. Why Vietnam?<eos> Because traditional folklore holds that the black rhino horn has a wide range of curative properties, including troubles with impotence.<eos> Which it doesn't, I assume.<eos> The horn is just keratin, so, you know, it's about as effective as chewing on your fingernails.
- No. I don't...<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> I'm sorry. By the way, I almost forgot.<eos> There is an entire thread for tips on this thing.<eos> Thanks, Jace.<eos> Hello?<eos> Jim Fox is here?<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> Who hired you to represent my employee?<eos> They told me you were direct.
- Iron-clad and unqualified.<eos> - It'll never happen.<eos> The alternative is a lengthy trial, which won't go well for you.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> A mole inside the State Department right under your nose?<eos> You give me a platform, and I'll savage you<eos> - like a lion ripping apart...<eos> - Good night.<eos> Do you know the difference between<eos> - you and me?

- Mr. President.<eos> Bess.<eos> Well, I know the timing isn't great, but I need to talk to you about the south-western black rhinoceros.<eos> You went over my head!<eos> Shattering decades of protocol, all for some dumb mammals my grandkids can see at the zoo!<eos> Well, that'll be the only place they can see them<eos> - at the rate we're going.<eos> - It's an abuse of an executive order.<eos> Waiver, technically, and it was an emergency.<eos> It's your pet rock, I get it, but you don't just throw it through my office window.

It's competition in its purest form.<eos> The weak get shunted aside.<eos> Relaxes me.<eos> I have nothing to say to you or the FBI.<eos> No, no, no, you misunderstand.<eos> I'm here to offer my sympathy.<eos> I know what it's like watching someone die in front of you, thinking, on some level, it's all your fault.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> How is any of this my fault?<eos> You were hired for the single purpose of getting Barry Milken out of custody so your employer could have him killed.
I know the feeling.<eos> Security clearances are frustrating.<eos> I worked in Intelligence.<eos> There were a lot of times I wanted to tell people things that I couldn't, not even my family.<eos> But I didn't, because security is a bond of trust.<eos> And I hope you know, Ashley, that we would protect you with that same bond of trust.<eos> We appreciate all the effort you're going to.<eos> And I am so sorry for your daughter.<eos> She's a beautiful person who doesn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> But you understand, I have to protect my girl, too.
It's a very painful process of growth and experience.<eos> Don't move. I learned that being an immigrant myself.<eos> When I arrived in England at the age of eight years old, I wasn't just a foreigner. I was a "bloody foreigner."<eos> Years later, I found myself walking on a Saturday afternoon and... I got jumped by this guy.<eos> And he beat the living daylights out of me.<eos> Skull fractured, both cheek bones, eye sockets, all my ribs busted.<eos> And I was a mess, man.<eos> It was just like, "Why me?" Mumbling through my messed-up mouth.<eos> And this old lady in the bed next door said,<eos> "Young man, why not you?
We're both guilty, Raymond.<eos> I came here to see for myself.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Who-- who's not?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Dembe?<eos> Dembe?<eos> Dembe?<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You and that fella in the hat brought Kate out here.
And by what it would do to me if we got too close.<eos> How's this for terrifying?<eos> I couldn't care less what you admire.<eos> I can appreciate the kindness you showed to an injured woman in need.<eos> It's commendable, as is your loyalty to her.<eos> Even under the threat of death.<eos> But you do need to call her.<eos> She was right about you.<eos> Said you were very dangerous and absolutely relentless.<eos> Could've used a few like you in Quang Tri.
- Barry had been having this heated conversation with another man, right down the street.<eos> I was sitting in that window, and I could see it all.<eos> This man kept thumping Barry's chest like this.<eos> And I told that old hair bag Officer Keating when he finally showed up 45 minutes later.<eos> But did Officer Keating follow up with me?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Okay, any other details about the man?<eos> White gentleman.<eos> Brown hair.<eos> A little shorter than you, looked like...

Al!<eos> - What? - Hey.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there, buddy.<eos> I'm just gonna watch, man.<eos> Hang back.<eos> No, but just...<eos> Look, the observation room, that's it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Quite the family tree you got.
He got pinched for bribes, money laundering, threatening a witness.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> Barry Kimball.<eos> Don't know him.<eos> So... you're gonna deny to my face<eos> knowing or interacting with Barry Kimball, whose warehouse got torched.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> [grunts] Here's what I think went down:<eos> You tried to squeeze money out of Kimball.<eos> Told him you'd rat him out to the city 'cause you have connections.

Jay.<eos> In here.<eos> Metal wedges.<eos> I work with a detective...<eos> I mean, he's a... he's a really good friend of mine.<eos> You killed his daughter in that fire.<eos> I mean, I knew her her whole life.<eos> She was... just one of those people, made the world a better place.<eos> I mean, she just... she had a glow.<eos> A chief at CFD, he told me arsonists like to return to the scene of the crime, but I had a real strong hunch you would anyway.
- Yeah.<eos> Till we know what's on that second file, we step light.<eos> Find her.<eos> - Yo, Sarge.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> DCFS tracked down the little girl that Bobby recorded, Taja Bowes.<eos> She lives in a foster home in Garfield Park.<eos> - You and me.<eos> - Yeah, let's go.<eos> So you're police officers?
Penthouse suite.<eos> Big upgrade.<eos> - My dad booked it.<eos> - Well, yeah, we figured.<eos> Why?<eos> I told you that I'm making amends, so my dad's gonna let me come home.<eos> We were meeting to talk.<eos> Or maybe you called him for help?<eos> We know someone was paying Bobby off.<eos> Were you and Bobby blackmailing your dad?

I forgot that I took my dad there.<eos> Look, I didn't know Bobby was filming me.<eos> Why do you think that I'm lying to you?<eos> Because I'm an addict?<eos> No, but it makes you good at it.<eos> Look, I've apologized to a hell of a lot of people.<eos> I-I thought that was Stephen.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> And Bobby wasn't just your buddy from meetings.<eos> You broke his heart.
You broke his heart.<eos> No, I-I-I didn't think that that was worth mentioning.<eos> Just...<eos> Look, we fell into bed a few times, it...<eos> We were both desperate and trying to get clean.<eos> - It burned out quick.<eos> - Sarah, you lied to us then, and you're lying to us now.<eos> Four hours after we spoke, you packed up and you moved to a suite that your dad paid for.<eos> You think we're just gonna believe that that's a coincidence?<eos> Were you and Bobby blackmailing your dad?

- That's not sick!<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - You raped me.<eos> Sarah...<eos> I understand why you didn't wanna tell us what was on this video, and I'm so sorry...<eos> But you've gotta understand that, from where I'm sitting, this is enough for Bobby to blackmail your father.<eos> If that's what he was doing, I didn't know.<eos> If you didn't know he was filming you, okay, fine.<eos> But the minute that I showed you this video, you knew what it was, and you had to know that Bobby was using it to blackmail your dad.

Bobby sent me the tape two months ago with a note saying the audio would be released if I didn't pay.<eos> I paid.<eos> He wanted more.<eos> I paid again.<eos> See, I know where you grew up.<eos> I came out of Cicero.<eos> Know what we used to call you guys?<eos> Junkyard dogs.<eos> Yeah, we'd ask "How are you?"<eos> You'd say, "Why the hell you wanna know?"

That's enough.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> - Enough.<eos> - No.<eos> I never heard from Bobby after the second payment.<eos> I'm happy to share all our correspondence with you.<eos> Thursday night, I was with my wife, and my friend Miles, a junkyard dog, will confirm that.<eos> All right.<eos> You keep smiling, Cal.<eos> You know, the nice thing about my job, no matter how much money you have,

Insists Sarah's her client.<eos> You have to let her lawyer upstairs then.<eos> We need to talk to her first.<eos> Stall them.<eos> You can't do that, Hank.<eos> Stall them.<eos> Your lawyer's downstairs.<eos> Or your dad's lawyer, I should say.<eos> Your dad is in the next room.<eos> By law, I have to let your lawyer up here unless you tell me not to, or you can sign this waiver and just talk to me.

I know a way to sneak you out of the sector.<eos> Senator, we'll get you to that meeting.<eos> Give them the coordinates to Dantooine.<eos> The rebel squadron defended their transport vigorously, but we thwarted their attempt to refuel.<eos> A scan of the vessel before it was destroyed revealed no cargo aboard, and only a small crew.<eos> Their cargo was something prized, a certain Senator, I suspect.<eos> Senator Mothma?<eos> Her capture is a priority.<eos> If she escaped aboard the Ghost, where is she now?<eos> Not where you'd expect.
He's right.<eos> Go now.<eos> We've got this.<eos> Hera, got a new problem.<eos> Two of 'em.<eos> Chop, get me emergency power.<eos> They've sustained damage to their core systems, and it seems Commander Skerris has dealt with their Y-wing escort in the nebula.<eos> Hail the rebel ship.<eos> This is Governor Pryce.<eos> You have been charged with treason against the Empire.

I'm stalling her while you figure out a plan.
We've got a job to do.<eos> Copy that, Phoenix Leader.<eos> Despite what you two think, I'm confident we have our best team on the job.<eos> Okay, since when does our best team include AP-5, Chopper, and Wedge?<eos> I don't get it, AP-5.<eos> Why are you so surprised Hera picked me for this mission?<eos> Your grasp of protocol is sorely lacking.<eos> Imperial pilots never remove their helmets in flight.<eos> I know, I was top of my class at the Imperial Academy.<eos> Oh, Lieutenant Antilles, you are mistaking my attention to detail for an attack on your obviously fragile ego.
This is a restricted sector.<eos> Identify yourselves.<eos> This is 836-VS. Delivery of service droids.<eos> Code clearance, uh, B6279.<eos> That was not very convincing.<eos> I definitely would not believe you.<eos> Thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> 836-VS, you've been cleared.<eos> Follow us in.<eos> No, you follow my lead.
That was not very convincing.<eos> I definitely would not believe you.<eos> Thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> 836-VS, you've been cleared.<eos> Follow us in.<eos> No, you follow my lead.<eos> Halt.<eos> Proceed through the scanner one at a time.<eos> I'm aware of the protocol.<eos> Now you.
To warn you.<eos> - About Maul?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Uh, you know?<eos> One doesn't survive as long as I have by being foolish or unprepared.<eos> Maul is an old adversary, and a persistent one at that.<eos> We can fight him together.<eos> I had no intention of fighting him, though that seems inevitable now.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You're the answer.
You talk too much!<eos> You have the heart of a rebel.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> You may have transmitted your warning, Agent, but in doing so, you've given me the last piece of the puzzle.<eos> Now, this is the trajectory of General Dodonna's fleet, and this is the trajectory of your Fulcrum transmission.<eos> Taken separately, they mean nothing.<eos> But together...<eos> Nothing.<eos> There's no planet there.<eos> The rebels are smarter than you give them credit for.
I wish I could help you, Commander Bridger, but I can't.<eos> Doing so would play into Thrawn's hands, and he would wipe out all we've worked to build.<eos> I know.<eos> He planned this.<eos> Senator Organa was right.<eos> It was too soon for open warfare against the Empire.<eos> I promise you, we will do our best to negotiate fair treatment for the prisoners.<eos> What if there are no prisoners?<eos> I'm not ready to give up yet.<eos> You have courage, Ezra.
Come on. Mr. Flynn now works as a digital forensics specialist.<eos> He'll get you up to speed.<eos> Okay, we just learned from NSA that Tara and Paul Nelson were out of town last night during Logan's murder.<eos> They are now on their way to a two-day couples retreat in the Angeles Forest.<eos> Undercover overnight operation.<eos> What, what! Kensi and I are all over that.<eos> Do we keep marshmallows in the Audi?<eos> We always keep marshmallows in the Audi.<eos> Mr. Deeks, slow your roll.<eos> You and Ms. Blye will be forgoing your undercover for your Overwatch duties. Hmm...
You tell me.<eos> Well, he shut down on me for awhile, which was understandable.<eos> Then he purged all the furniture from his house.<eos> Then things were great.<eos> And now, I'm not sure.<eos> Furniture thing's pretty typical.<eos> How about using a dining room table as firewood?<eos> Is that typical?<eos> Maybe not, but I get it.<eos> You know, you got to find a way to cope with the demands of the job.
It's just someone from work who happened to be in the neighborhood.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> Good.<eos> I'll meet you.<eos> Send me an address.<eos> Just go.<eos> So funny, running into you.<eos> I'll see you at work on Monday.<eos> Take care, pal.<eos> You, too.
But, um, I'll trade you for Earl Grey.<eos> You sure?<eos> Oh, yeah. It's one of my faves.<eos> I drink it with my boss all the time.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, I noticed you were kind of upset before.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I don't know what came over me.<eos> Maybe it's because, um, you and Eric are so simpatico.
At least three times in the past four days.<eos> If he was a member of Almawt, I bet that's their spot.<eos> Take a picture.<eos> Dave, I'm sending you a photo of an address where we think Almawt was meeting.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Tara, stop!<eos> We're federal agents.<eos> Nell?<eos> You'll make it a lot easier if you don't run.<eos> We know about you and Paul selling the information-- it's over.

We didn't sell anything.<eos> They kidnapped my sister Chelsey and they forced us to do this.<eos> Oh, God, honey, you should sit. You shouldn't be moving.
Come on, baby!<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Watch out! Tree!<eos> Are you Chelsey?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm Anna, and that's Sam.<eos> We're federal agents.<eos> I was sure I was gonna die.<eos> You're alive, Chelsey.
It wasn't strictly personal.<eos> Did you ask her about Sabatino?<eos> You know I did, but that's not the point.<eos> Facing one's pain... head-on, and cauterizing the wounds-- it's true bravery.<eos> Ignoring, denying, deluding ourselves just, um... leads to more heartbreak.<eos> I wonder if that really is her family.<eos> Does it matter, Mr. Callen?<eos> Lately, I see sunshine coming from the cracks in that wall you've been rebuilding and rebuilding around yourself.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna have that looked at.<eos> Mm. I hated her just as much as you did for hurting you.
[sobbing] I can't leave, just go.<eos> We need to get you out of here.<eos> [sobbing] Just go.<eos> No, please, you can't cross that line!<eos> I can't leave.<eos> Just go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Come on, you're okay.
Okay.<eos> What did he want?<eos> For me to stay in the trailer.<eos> Juliana, let me ask you, can you picture the man?<eos> Had you ever seen him before?<eos> No.<eos> He put an ad up on Craigslist, a caretaker for his cabin.<eos> I drove up there to meet him, and he locked me up.<eos> I escaped. [chuckles]<eos> Okay, so you got out, and that hiker found you, but you didn't want his help.
- Thank you.<eos> Now, that's terrible.<eos> Tied up?<eos> She wasn't tied up.<eos> She was chained to the wall.<eos> [sighs] Well, the cabin was Darren's place, before they called it a man cave.<eos> He'd disappear out there for days.<eos> Hunting?<eos> That's what he said, but I never got my fur coat.<eos> But you sold the cabin, right?
Darren's decision.<eos> He used to drive a truck.<eos> He got laid off.<eos> He was in an accident, right?<eos> Which was not his fault, but they let him go.<eos> I think that's what killed him, losing his purpose.<eos> Ma'am, the buyer of the cabin, they shielded their identity behind an LLC.<eos> I-I don't know what that means.<eos> It just means that they didn't want to be known.<eos> Were you by chance at the closing?
Now, she was taken with her friend Juliana Parks in the Chicagoland area five days ago.<eos> Juliana has been recovered, but Shanee is still being held.<eos> I am not law enforcement.<eos> I do not represent law enforcement.<eos> I only want Shanee Wallis returned to her family.<eos> I want this one.<eos> Who's Shanee Wallis?<eos> Hey, Daniel Jung.<eos> So, you want to do what I do?<eos> Who are you?
Hey, Daniel Jung.<eos> So, you want to do what I do?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Detective Alvin Olinsky.<eos> This is Sergeant Hank Voight, Chicago Police Department.<eos> So, what are you doing in the middle of our investigation?<eos> [chuckles] Well, hold on, boys, okay?<eos> Look, I-I'm just trying to locate Shanee Wallis, same as you.<eos> You know, we should compare notes.<eos> The first time we ever heard that name was when you went public.
Girl's missing.<eos> You think I know where she is?<eos> Austin was messed up.<eos> November, he shows up looking for a place to crash.<eos> We weren't really brothers.<eos> He just didn't have anybody else.<eos> Friends?<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> You don't get it.
I've never seen that before in my life.<eos> Me either.<eos> Open the door.<eos> I wouldn't know how.<eos> Open it!<eos> My husband must have put that in.<eos> I don't know anything about...<eos> What's the code?<eos> I'm telling you, I have no idea.<eos> And I'm telling you I know you do know, and I know that girl is in there.
I'll call CFD.<eos> 3737.<eos> Go.<eos> Adam!<eos> Kevin!<eos> In here!<eos> Hey. We need an ambulance, bro.<eos> She needs help.<eos> Incorporation documents off your computer.<eos> You created the LLC that purchased your husband's cabin.
37?<eos> Darren's favorite number.<eos> He uses it all the time.<eos> This was just some game they made up.<eos> Oh, so you admit you knew it?<eos> You admit it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> Yeah, I was trying to be the perfect wife.<eos> Geraldine, you like blaming other people.

Convert's fervor.<eos> Good to see you, sir.<eos> "Sir" denotes respect.<eos> You can call me "Mr. Speaker."<eos> The President doesn't know I'm here.<eos> Well, this is Washington.<eos> Everybody knows you're here.<eos> They just don't know on whose behalf.<eos> I'd like to say the American people, but I hear how that sounds.<eos> Well, you don't represent the people any more than I do.

Believe it or not, we women are ready to face any situation.<eos> Though some men might not agree...<eos> [Mario] Who knew that the telephone was going to save lives?<eos> What a story!<eos> Good afternoon, Don Pablo.<eos> Do you want to talk?<eos> [stuttering] No, actually... [clears throat] I was calling to clear up a doubt.<eos> A doubt?<eos> This morning in the lobby, I saw an operator being interviewed about the fire... but she wasn't the one who handled the incident.<eos> It was you.
-Why didn't you want to say it was you?<eos> -I'll be honest.<eos> It's true, I called the fire department, but I can't be in the news.<eos> My family disapproves of my work, and I didn't want to upset them by appearing in the papers.<eos> My parents want me to get married, but I'd rather work and be independent.<eos> [chuckles] A progressive woman.<eos> -Do you mind?<eos> -No.<eos> [chuckles] That's great.<eos> Do you have anyone you have to answer to?
We can't do anything. Yes, we can.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> [Pilar] Carlota!<eos> My dear, how lovely!<eos> What a surprise.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> -[Carlota] I've come to talk to Father.<eos> -[Emilio] And to what do I owe that honor?<eos> The thing is... a friend of mine is being held at the police station.<eos> You have contacts in the police, so I thought you could help her because Sara can't lose her job.
-I apologized.<eos> Maybe I should remind you what you did to me.<eos> I apologized.<eos> I did all I could to fix things, and you didn't give me a chance.<eos> I'm not giving you a chance now to take her away. Don't make me call the police.<eos> -Please, Mario.<eos> -Go.<eos> [Carmen] Indalecio, I'm so grateful you decided to disregard my husband's irrational whim and leave the will as it was.<eos> [Indalecio] With all due respect, Carmen, Ricardo signed his last wishes, specifying that Francisco would take charge of the company, Elisa would be the main shareholder, and Carlos would have an income as long as he gave up any claim to the company.<eos> But you decided not to give it to the notary.
You would have gone and, like, fucked up the date.<eos> I would've definitely gone.<eos> That's called "negging," by the way, when someone undermines your confidence just so they say one nice thing to you, and you're, like, "Oh, all right.<eos> Don't fall for that.<eos> Lara, now I'm twice your age and I'm someone's mother, and you don't mess with someone's mother, because we know whose fault you are.<eos> Yeah, I called his mother.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I was, like, "Hello, Linda.<eos> Yes, it's nice to speak to you again as well.<eos> Just want you to know I'm finished with your son, but you're not, because you've managed to raise one of the top one assholes that I have ever met.
Shame on you for hacking this.<eos> I didn't. Sly must've plugged into their security cameras to download the ceremony to his laptop, which he forgot to close.<eos> I found it running on a loop when I came in.<eos> It's uncomfortable.<eos> I feel guilty watching this.<eos> I feel sick watching it.<eos> Yet no one's looking away.<eos> Good morrow, compatriots!<eos> Good morrow to you, fine sir!<eos> That's a fancy little brooch you got there.
We got to keep lessening our load. Come on.<eos> Agent Cabe Gallo, Homeland Security.<eos> I need to commandeer a Desert Tech HTI sniper rifle.<eos> It's a matter of life and death.<eos> Excuse you, I'm with a customer, you'll need to wait.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> I'm an agent of the U.S. government.<eos> Well, as an agent of the U.S. government, you would know that the law requires a ten-day waiting period before the sale of a firearm.<eos> And as a licensed firearms merchant in the state of California, you should know that this badge allows me emergency appropriation.<eos> Look, for all I know, that's fake and you're some kook who's just...
I'm Terry Crews.<eos> And I'm Charissa Thompson.<eos> And we are fired up because we are about to watch 12 more competitors summon up all the courage they can muster as they enter the jaws of the Beast.<eos> And they are gonna get up close and personal with some of the most terrifying obstacles they've ever seen, all with the hope of being the one competitor that makes it to the end.<eos> Here's our two American competitors, ready to take on those obstacles.<eos> First, starting in the east and ready to represent the women, is CrossFit queen Lindsay Andrew from Charlotte, North Carolina.<eos> Her unique training regimen gives her impressive agility that should set her up for success.<eos> CrossFit prepares you for the unknown and unknowable.<eos> That's how I train every day, since we have no idea what this course is like.<eos> I think it's important to demonstrate that you can do anything you put your mind to, regardless if you know what's gonna happen or not.
There's go forward.<eos> I'm taming the Beast, I'm out in the environment, and that's what a Beastmaster is.<eos> And I'm going for it.<eos> This is our home, our country.<eos> We're not gonna go home without a win.<eos> Lindsay Andrew and Trevor Carter, two competitors proud to represent their country and ready to put their hurt on the Beast in their quest to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> Getting right into it at the head of the Beast is American Trevor Carter.<eos> So, he's a firefighter, but he's very good at rock climbing.<eos> You look at him, he's very, very confident right now.<eos> As you can tell, the way he breezed through the Jaw Breaker, that wasn't a problem.
Look at that.<eos> Let's see how he makes it in the brain of the Beast.<eos> He passed the Point Thruster, passes Brain Matter.<eos> Coming up on Faceplant, and we've made this a lot more difficult because we've swapped the chain with a rope.<eos> That's going to challenge their grip.<eos> Trevor's a firefighter, so he should be used to climbing ropes in his training.<eos> Yeah, he says he uses his fear of falling to push himself harder.<eos> No, no! He has a fear of falling!<eos> And he falls into the blood!<eos> Let me tell you, you slam into those Energy Coils, it's a game changer.
Guilherme's out to prove a point, and he is doing a great job so far.<eos> He's got 30 points.<eos> He's a member of BOPE, which is an elite group of men.<eos> Only 400 are selected among the 1,000 that apply.<eos> That makes Guilherme an expert on urban warfare.<eos> Let's see if that helps him here on Faceplant, Terry.<eos> Oh, he does not make it!<eos> Faceplant claims another victim!<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> He had perfect form leaping upward for the rope, but you've really got to grip it with everything you've got to stop that downward momentum.
Personal trainer Eiji Semba from Japan took a risk in order to prove his manhood to the love of his life.<eos> By participating in this contest, I'd like to show off my skills.<eos> To show I'm a man.<eos> This is for you.<eos> But the higher jump to the transfer wall... Whoa! Was quite the heartbreaker.<eos> Having trouble.<eos> - I guess he can kiss that girl goodbye.<eos> - No! CrossFit queen Lindsay Andrew from the United States pumped up her training to a whole new level.<eos> I just recently went down to Fort Jackson and got on their obstacle course.<eos> My boyfriend was like, "Ya know, you're gonna be fine.

- Well done!<eos> - I almost had a heart attack there, Hans.<eos> That was very close!<eos> And with that time, he takes over first place from Phelipe Young.<eos> The Brazilians are not big fans of Germany right now.<eos> Yeah, Marco brags about his upper-body strength.<eos> He's gonna need that on the Mag Wall.<eos> A little bit more to go.<eos> He's into the blood!<eos> Once you get to the inverted section of the wall, it can cause your body to swing out awkwardly.
Guilherme watching nervously.<eos> If Silke can make it past Brain Matter in the next 25 seconds, he's going to be eliminated.<eos> A little stumble there.<eos> She's gotta get moving.<eos> Flashing those gymnastics skills.<eos> She looks very comfortable here.<eos> I think she's gonna do it!<eos> Oh, she made it!<eos> Guilherme Medeiros of Brazil is eliminated, and Silke will be moving on to Level 2.<eos> Now, as you know, Terry, points are cumulative, so she needs to continue on and make every obstacle count.
He's doing great!<eos> Goes right up into the Digestive Track at a great pace.<eos> Really making a great move.<eos> This is how you do it.<eos> You jump down into the Dreadmill.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Well done!<eos> - He's gotta keep making his move.<eos> - Santiago! Those Dreadmills are moving!<eos> You gotta get your speed!
Very smooth!<eos> Sped right up the Digestive Track and through the Dreadmills...<eos> - He stopped!<eos> - Come on, Shimofuji!<eos> Amazing balance!<eos> but finally lost his grip on Chain Reaction.<eos> He fell!<eos> Here, it seems he threw in the towel.<eos> Trevor Carter was next, keeping America in the competition.<eos> Being a firefighter, you've gotta perform under pressure.
- Come on, Shimofuji!<eos> Amazing balance!<eos> but finally lost his grip on Chain Reaction.<eos> He fell!<eos> Here, it seems he threw in the towel.<eos> Trevor Carter was next, keeping America in the competition.<eos> Being a firefighter, you've gotta perform under pressure.<eos> Your legs are heavy, you're hurting.<eos> You're sucking in smoke, choking.<eos> But you're going, you're moving, you're pushing through barriers.
He zoomed through the first two obstacles and went for the Point Thruster in style.<eos> He's got the Point Thruster!<eos> But he had an awkward dismount off the spinning gear.<eos> Oh, he's off!<eos> No, no, no! No!<eos> He landed right on the edge and right over it.<eos> That's where the centrifugal force is!<eos> Okay, Terry has this thing called centrifugal force, which I know is an actual thing, but every time I ask him for the definition, he skirts by that.<eos> That's because I'm too smart. I'm too smart to tell you.<eos> If you don't understand it, you're never gonna get it.
Here we go.<eos> Almost lost his balance there!<eos> Perfectly-timed jump!<eos> Gets it, making his way.<eos> Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?<eos> - Nope, he goes right by it.<eos> - It's gone. And right into Coil Crawl.<eos> Hand delivered!<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> He slides down. You don't want to get your feet wet, because then your grip is completely gone.
- It's gone. And right into Coil Crawl.<eos> Hand delivered!<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> He slides down. You don't want to get your feet wet, because then your grip is completely gone.<eos> This is sinking.<eos> Then you gotta make that all-important decision:<eos> are you going right to stay the course, or are you going left to try to pick up some bonus points, which are worth 40?<eos> - He's going for the bonus!<eos> - Going bonus! Wow, the gymnast is putting on a floor show.<eos> - You mentioned gymnastics?
That this girl is on fire!<eos> She still has to get 15 feet above, and she's slipping down.<eos> - I'm sorry!<eos> - No! Hold on!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> - Silke! - That hurt my heart, Zigzag!<eos> So, our last female is out of the competition, and that is it for Germany.<eos> She put up such a tremendous fight.<eos> She made history for all the females in this competition, and she definitely made her country proud.<eos> Are you disappointed?
Let's watch them go toe to toe on the Power Source.<eos> All right, we're about to kick off Level 4 of the Beast, but before we do, let's take a look at how our two finalists made it here tonight.<eos> That's how you do it!<eos> In physical aspects, I was a weightlifter.<eos> Stamina, strength and power...<eos> I think I'm the best in those.<eos> I feel gymnastics has given me the tools I need to face the Beast.<eos> Nicely done!<eos> To raise Mexico's flag, to compete in its name fills me with pride and happiness.<eos> Beast, you met your match.
It all comes down to this.<eos> - Yes. Oh, man!<eos> - Hyunho!<eos> - Santiago!<eos> It's Hyunho Kim from South Korea, versus Santiago López from Mexico.<eos> Level 4, the Power Source, Terry.<eos> It starts with the Foundation.<eos> Each one of these Energy Taps is worth ten points.<eos> They're both moving at a great pace right now.<eos> And you notice the handholds get progressively smaller on the way up.
He recovered well.<eos> Both of these competitors very evenly matched, literally.<eos> Like, look, their hands are on the exact same spots right now.<eos> Santiago made a desperate dive for that Energy Tap right there, but he misses.<eos> He's having a really tough time with Grid Lock.<eos> Oh! Hyunho Kim gets another power tap and then falls!<eos> It's neck and neck.<eos> This is anyone's game.<eos> Santiago is continuing to struggle here.<eos> Grid Lock gives you such little room to propel yourself up.

Wow, Terry, Brazil's Felipe Camargo enters this competition with a résumé that may actually scare this Beast.<eos> You're talking about a man who's used to climbing.
Wow, Terry, Brazil's Felipe Camargo enters this competition with a résumé that may actually scare this Beast.<eos> You're talking about a man who's used to climbing.<eos> - He is a five-time...<eos> - A professional climber.<eos> Brazilian climbing champion... from 2010 all the way to 2015.<eos> That's five years in a row.<eos> Makes his way up Jaw Breaker with ease, and dances up Mother Tongue.<eos> Approaching that first Point Thruster worth ten points, and, Terry, I know you're a big believer in taking the risk to get those.

He's got himself 40 points as he moves on to Faceplant.<eos> Throat Erosion is done!<eos> Now, this is where it gets tough.<eos> Not surprising, considering that this guy is on fire.<eos> And there he goes.<eos> Oh, nice swing!<eos> Felipe from Brazil! The Brazilian hosts are fired up by this guy, and for good reason.<eos> Come on, Felipe!<eos> Felipe is quite the hero in his country.<eos> Did you know that he carried the torch in last summer's Olympic Games?
Right now, we have 12 brave competitors from six different countries who are about to take on that magnificent monstrosity that we call the Beast.<eos> So, Felipe Camargo started things off by finishing Level 1.<eos> I'll be curious to see if anyone can match up with this guy.<eos> Well, let's quickly meet the two Americans hoping to do just that.<eos> The first competitor to go head-to-head with the Beast is parkour sensation Brandon Douglass from Boulder, Colorado.<eos> He's 5'9" and 145 pounds.<eos> Brandon has dominated in hundreds of parkour competitions using his combination of both speed and agility.<eos> Parkour just teaches you a lot about yourself, because you're constantly dealing with your fears.<eos> I thrive with really precise technical obstacles, stuff that most people would be scared to jump to.<eos> If you're scared to jump to a one-foot wall, then try jumping to something that's two inches wide.
César is trained in kung fu, Muay Thai boxing, as well as MMA fighting.<eos> So he's down to kick some butt on this course.<eos> César is 6'1", 182 pounds, and he's not just physically sharp, he's worked on his mental game, as well.<eos> That's a great philosophy.<eos> Let's see if he's mentally prepared for Faceplant.<eos> No!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> No elevation at all.<eos> That was out and down.<eos> Let me tell you, there are times you want to be off the chain.
I felt alone...<eos> When I first started with my acrobatics... my life changed a lot.<eos> And I'd like to be an example for all Mexicans that practice this sport, and that's my focus.<eos> To be someone kids can look at and think:<eos> "If he can do it, why can't I?"<eos> That's what I'd really love to do.<eos> And back on the course, Ivan has done a great job so far.<eos> He's now on the Energy Coils with 50 points.<eos> That's so perfect!<eos> You're doing great!
- What happened there?<eos> Psychologist Steffen Zimmermann refused to let the Beast get inside his head... but the Energy Coils brought his session to a quick end.<eos> He has to be careful there.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Those runs by the two Germans put Ludwig in fourth place and Steffen in sixth, and unfortunately,<eos> Mexico's Thaily Amezcua and USA's Mimi Bonny have been eliminated.<eos> Brazil's César Curti has now fallen all the way to eighth place, and sits on the bubble.<eos> And now it all comes down to this, our last athlete for Level 1, and it's Japan's Kaori Sakai.<eos> If Kaori scores more than 40 points, she'll guarantee herself a spot in Level 2, and Felipe Camargo's countrymate, César Curti, will be going home.<eos> Kaori is looking focused, and she's ready to show the Beast that you do not mess with Mom.
If Kaori scores more than 40 points, she'll guarantee herself a spot in Level 2, and Felipe Camargo's countrymate, César Curti, will be going home.<eos> Kaori is looking focused, and she's ready to show the Beast that you do not mess with Mom.<eos> I graduated high school, got married, and had a child.<eos> We divorced two years after the marriage, sadly.<eos> As the parent of a boy, I knew I needed to get stronger, so I started CrossFit to show how a single mother can live strong.<eos> I'd like to win at Beastmaster.<eos> Kaori Sakai has been looking like Supermom so far.<eos> She's got 30 points going into Throat Erosion.<eos> Eyes should be focused on the rope.<eos> You cannot reach an object you don't see.
Kicking off Level 2, it's 24-year-old Felipe Camargo.<eos> This guy is a legend in his native Brazil.<eos> The rock-climbing champ showed us he's a front-runner by finishing Level 1.<eos> No question!<eos> Let's see what he's got left in the tank here on Spinal Ascent.<eos> He is so well-conditioned as an athlete.<eos> He's been a climber since he was ten years old.<eos> All that practice is coming in handy today.<eos> It's an eight-foot jump to that top platform.<eos> Wow, did you see that?
He's been a climber since he was ten years old.<eos> All that practice is coming in handy today.<eos> It's an eight-foot jump to that top platform.<eos> Wow, did you see that?<eos> He just muscled his way up that platform.<eos> That's about as smooth as we've seen that obstacle done!<eos> Now, we know this guy can climb.<eos> Let's see how he falls as he takes on Spinal Descent.<eos> It's all about body control and weight distribution here.<eos> Those cords can give out suddenly if you don't hold on right.
Look at him.<eos> Then Mexico's Ivan Zepeda drew upon his own advice before taking on Level 2.<eos> Honestly, I'm very scared.<eos> But I'm a PE teacher, and I always tell my students not to be afraid.<eos> I'll see you in the third round, Beast.<eos> He had his fear under control when he cruised past Stomach Churn...<eos> Two more! Two more.<eos> Come on!<eos> but when he entered Digestive Track, the Beast spit him out.<eos> Ivan, you got desperate, brother!
- He climbed up!<eos> He snagged a last-minute Point Thruster...<eos> - Go, get the Point Thruster!<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> ...before falling victim to the Beast.<eos> He did it!<eos> I showed how Korean guys are strong.<eos> If I make it to the next level, I'll try to do better.<eos> Looking at the leader board, nobody can catch Brazil's Felipe Camargo and, unfortunately, Japan's Daigo Nakano is our first competitor eliminated in Level 2.<eos> Next up is Chang Suk Bang from South Korea and possibly the only man in this competition tougher than you, Terry.

Chang Suk Bang!<eos> Go get 'em, Chang Suk Bang!<eos> Go get 'em, Chang Suk Bang!<eos> Tie that shoe.<eos> Take your time.<eos> You earned it.
We'll see if that intense training helps him here on Stomach Churn.<eos> Look at him hold on to that thing!<eos> - Hard.<eos> - Oh, my goodness.<eos> - That took a little...<eos> - Oh, my goodness!<eos> A little wind got knocked out of him there.<eos> Sure did.<eos> Beast is designed to find your weakness. Mm-hmm.<eos> You have to trust your instincts.
He's having trouble reaching that next pole.<eos> I like his strategy here of kicking that pole so it swings a little closer.<eos> Oh, he lets go!<eos> But he still manages to score 260 points, putting himself in excellent position.<eos> Now, trying to follow up on Felipe's impressive performance is Ivan Zepeda from Mexico.<eos> - Come on, Ivan!<eos> - Come on, Mexico!<eos> He's got the lowest point total thus far, so if he wants to move on, he's gonna need to put on quite a performance here.<eos> In order to be a better person, you've got to give it your all.<eos> And you'll never know what that is if you don't give it a shot.
One of the best efforts I have ever seen.<eos> But, as we enter the final level, he's found a worthy challenger in Ludwig Hefele.<eos> Come on, Ludwig!<eos> With phenomenal parkour skills, Ludwig Hefele, he's got the speed...<eos> Wills his way back!<eos> ...strength, and climbing ability to take on the most formidable competitor we've ever seen.<eos> I will advance as fast as possible and try to stay focused.<eos> Now they'll battle it out on the toughest obstacle in the Beast, one that no competitor has yet to conquer, an 80-foot climb up the Power Source.<eos> Because only one of them will win $10,000 and advance to the finals... for a chance to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> So, what do you say?
Should be a little bit easier for him.<eos> Except that this beam is very unbalanced.<eos> And there's a Point Thruster opportunity here, but it looks like Yunhwan is just focused on getting across Brain Matter.<eos> Now he's gotta make his way on to Throat Erosion.<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Yeah, he's got it!<eos> He grabbed the top!<eos> Korean Kim Yunhwan!<eos> There's his younger brother watching on as Yunhwan now has to make the jump on Faceplant.<eos> That rope can really do a number on your hands if you don't get a good, firm grip on it.
But whenever I get sick, she gives me money to see a doctor.<eos> If I become the Beastmaster and win $10,000, I will give my mother a call and give her the money.<eos> Yunhwan Kim is starting with 60 points from Level 1.<eos> And there he goes!<eos> - Oh, look at this.<eos> He's gonna go with the pull-up approach.<eos> Get that leg up there.<eos> I think that's a problem because it tends to burn more energy.<eos> There's the explosion.<eos> You can do it!
He doesn't look fazed at all.<eos> Jumps down into the last one.<eos> There he goes.<eos> He has conquered Stomach Churn.<eos> Now, here's where being a little smaller can help you get through this tube, because that thing, remember, is sinking fast.<eos> Which means he needs to move!<eos> Faster!<eos> Go!<eos> Man!<eos> If you get out of the Digestive Track fast enough, you'll have a higher angle on the jump to the Dreadmills, but when it's lower, it's just that much harder, as Yoshitaro just found out.
But won't get it...<eos> Oh, he rolled off!<eos> Oh, I thought he had it, too.<eos> He took a huge face blow right here.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Pow! Right on his face.<eos> That hurt.<eos> Let me tell you, he was stunned.<eos> Even with short legs, it's a tough tube.<eos> So, one wrong move, it slips you down.
Hustle, hustle, hustle!<eos> He's gonna end up in that fuel quickly if he doesn't make a move here.<eos> - Jumping...<eos> There we go.<eos> - There we go.<eos> Good job.<eos> Good job, Tabito Okayasu.<eos> He's got a decision to make here.<eos> And he's going left to the bonus obstacle.<eos> The bonus round consists of three different challenges, each worth 40 points, as opposed to the Level 3 obstacles, worth 30, but as you know, Terry, when you get into the bonus territory, you can lose the same amount of points,
Into the Extraction where you gotta climb up across a field of vertical pipes to a higher platform, Terry, and some of the pipes move up and down.<eos> Figuring out what he wants to do.<eos> Climbing up these pipes is gonna take big-time upper-body strength, and also grip strength.<eos> These pipes can get slippery if your hands are sweaty.<eos> He's going up now!<eos> He's got the other pipe now, but, oh, man, he stopped!<eos> Oh, and he can't just hang there!<eos> He's draining his energy.<eos> He's got to pull himself up.<eos> Come on, Jonathan, you can do it!
Yungyung Kim getting another Energy Tap, but, oh, falling off again!<eos> His arms must be exhausted at this point.<eos> He's right up next to Jonathan Collins, but he is still behind in points.<eos> That Energy Tap he overlooked early on may be the deciding factor here.<eos> Yeah, yeah...<eos> Ouch!<eos> It's not over yet, Charissa.<eos> Yungyung is not gonna quit, no matter how much pain is in his fingers.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You can do it!
Standing eight stories high... at 640 feet long.<eos> It was constructed from over 50 tons of steel.<eos> The final outcome was so intimidating, this monstrosity was given a name... the Beast.<eos> Athletes from all over the world tried to conquer it.<eos> A soldier... a world-class rock climber... a U.S. decathlete... a two-time world champion ice climber... and so far eight have prevailed and earned the title Beastmaster.<eos> Now, the last 12 competitors will face off for one remaining spot in the finals.<eos> Who will it be?<eos> That is the Beast, and it has devoured Americans, Mexicans, South Koreans, Brazilians, and Germans, and believe it or not, it's still hungry.<eos> I have no idea how that's possible.<eos> Charissa, it is obvious you've never seen me at an all-you-can-eat buffet.

Ohh! He's into the blood!<eos> Let's see what happened.<eos> Magnet got me.<eos> I didn't move quick enough.<eos> Team USA, baby!<eos> Whoo! Air Force Ken!<eos> That Mag Wall grounded Air Force Ken, but let's see how our next three competitors handle the Beast.<eos> First up was Mirella Araüjo.<eos> My inspiration is my son. She fought her way up Mother Tongue...<eos> You have to have momentum to get you to the top.
Three strong competitors have failed to traverse the Mag Wall, but will muscleman entertainer Mitsuteru Tanaka from Japan be able to buck that trend?<eos> I am a muscleman YouTube artist.<eos> I broadcast one muscleman video a day.<eos> I'd like to succeed here so I can let the world know who I am.<eos> I'd like something that says I'm number one.<eos> He flexed his way across the Energy Coils.<eos> Oh, he made it to another one!<eos> He is making this thing look easy right there.<eos> And he looked good on the Mag Wall...<eos> You gotta go!
He is making this thing look easy right there.<eos> And he looked good on the Mag Wall...<eos> You gotta go!<eos> He's gotta pull himself up here.<eos> ...until his muscles finally met their match.<eos> Oh, he couldn't reach it!<eos> And he fell!<eos> Now, with the top three competitors all failing on that Mag Wall, well, they're tied with 50 points, so it's gonna come down to the fastest time.<eos> Our next competitor is a parkour specialist from South Korea, Taeyoon Kim.<eos> Practicing parkour lets you overcome the fears inside you.
Our next competitor is a jujitsu champion from Japan, Kaita Omura.<eos> I applied for this for my close friend who died last year.<eos> He and I had been close friends since the third grade.<eos> Last year, in August, while swimming in the ocean, he was dragged under by waves and died.<eos> He always said, "Never give up."<eos> So I want to win this with his words in my heart.<eos> And Kaita is holding on to that inspiration as he starts across Brain Matter.<eos> He's just gonna go with a crawling technique.<eos> You know what, that's an actual, viable technique.<eos> You can crawl your way through this thing.
I am a professional fighter of mixed martial arts.<eos> I want to let the entire world know my nickname, Wild Horse.<eos> The Wild Horse took off in the beginning.<eos> He galloped through Brain Matter...<eos> Very smooth.<eos> This is as good as we've seen it happen.<eos> What's his technique gonna be?<eos> but couldn't hold on to the end.<eos> Ohh! He missed!<eos> Ahh... If you let that friction get you, it just burns right through your hands.
Let's see if that gets him far in this competition.<eos> At the moment, I am a student in engineering.<eos> But additionally, I am a fashion and fitness model.<eos> I am the Ultimate Beastmaster because I have the best body, and I have the greatest ambition and I have to make some people at home proud.<eos> Well, Nam Vo, as you can tell, is a very successful model back home, and now he's hoping that he can be successful on Faceplant.<eos> If he lands this jump on Faceplant, he'll eliminate his own countryman, Alexander Schmidt.<eos> This man only eats 25 grams of carbs a day.<eos> - A lot of people don't understand...<eos> - I eat that for breakfast.<eos> It's one banana, and you get your energy from carbs.
And, to make things even more challenging for our competitors... Hey, why not? We've angled up the Digestive Track by ten degrees, which is going to make for a steeper climb before the deadly jump into the Dreadmill.<eos> Now Germany's Nam Vo is next.<eos> As a kid, I was very overweight.<eos> I realized I must change my life, so I started training.<eos> I achieved a lot in a short period of time.<eos> I am Nam, and I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster!<eos> My boyfriend, Nam Vo.<eos> He doesn't know it yet, but he's not ugly, and he's doing a very pretty job here in Level 2.<eos> My carb-challenged homie eats a banana for his carbs, and that's it.<eos> The rest is protein, and you can tell.

He needs to be careful with that face when he lands on those gears.<eos> Ow! That was a ten-foot fall, and he slammed onto the pad.<eos> Now remember, Terry, the Beast has been modified in the Digestive Track.<eos> Remember, it's angled up ten degrees, which makes it way more challenging than before.<eos> At 6'2", it won't be easy jumping into that cylinder.<eos> There he goes.<eos> Ack! Rough start.<eos> Run, dude!<eos> Run fast!<eos> It's sinking into the the blood very quickly, and you gotta go, Nam!

I've always worked for everything that's come my way.<eos> I was never handed anything in life, so this is another chance to prove to these elite athletes that, hey, I'm on the same field as you.<eos> In my mind right now, it's all about that grand prize.<eos> Our underdog is showing that fighting spirit as he maneuvers down Spinal Descent.<eos> Doesn't look like he's having any problem here.<eos> Not at all.<eos> His socks look good, hair looks good.<eos> He's in order.<eos> Okay, he's holding on.<eos> You really have to go off instinct right here.

The Digestive Track proving too much for Brian Redard.<eos> The worst thing to say is that you got flushed out of a Digestive Track.<eos> That's probably the worst thing!<eos> He suffers from Beast constipation!<eos> Now in retrospect, wish I went for that Thruster there, but in hindsight, I really thought I could get all these done.<eos> Let's see if the next two competitors were able to step up to the challenge.<eos> Japan's jujitsu champion Kaita Omura.<eos> He sparred with the Beast on Spinal Ascent.<eos> Spinal Ascent is no joke!<eos> You must ascend!
Look out!<eos> He's going down into Spinal Descent.<eos> - Ken has a different approach.<eos> He's going for the Point Thruster.<eos> Could we also make mention that that hat stayed on?<eos> And he's got it!<eos> Yes, 20 more points for Ken.<eos> I like it!<eos> He's the first athlete tonight to get to that Point Thruster, and he's on his way to Stomach Churn.<eos> Now taking a look at Germany's Nam Vo, and you know he does not want to lose that lead.
He went for it!<eos> Air Force Ken misses the jump to the Dreadmills, but knocks Germany's Nam Vo out of first place.<eos> Yeah, it's definitely harder than Level 1.<eos> There's all kinds of weird muscle movements going on and coordination and balance.<eos> Yeah, it was good.<eos> I liked it.<eos> Now, Ken shouldn't be too excited, because South Korea's parkour master, Taeyoon Kim, is up next.<eos> I can do it!<eos> Yes!<eos> Since parkour trains you to adapt to the surrounding environment, there's a training method for overcoming any kind of obstacle.
If I hadn't missed a step in the middle... I could have finished.<eos> It's too bad.<eos> Now, Taeyoon Kim just took first place, and that run eliminated Japan's Kaita Omura.<eos> South Korea's Woosung Yu is now on the bubble.<eos> And here's the guy looking to knock him out, Brazil's Bruno Nogueira.<eos> All right, back here at the Beast, and all Bruno's gotta do is clear Spinal Descent in order to eliminate South Korea's Woosung Yu.<eos> And he does it!<eos> Woosung Yu is out!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> You've gotta get to that center.

And now on to Coil Crawl.<eos> He's gotta make his move.<eos> Those things are sinking right away.<eos> Wow, he really understands how important it is to stay on that top coil and keep it moving.<eos> Not a surprise.<eos> This guy's a competitor.<eos> He is heading for the bonus obstacles.<eos> He has to stay balanced, because those coils have no stability.<eos> Ooh, 30 points, and now he's on to Bungee Beds.<eos> They're worth 40 points, but you can lose 40 points if you're unsuccessful.

- Going for it?<eos> - Should I go for it?<eos> Yeah, dude!<eos> I'm going for it.<eos> He's going for it.<eos> If he fails, remember, you lose 40 points.<eos> I need some noise!<eos> And Ken looking for some encouragement.<eos> You've gotta love this guy's spirit.<eos> He is just that kind of guy you really want to get behind and root for.
- He's not...<eos> It doesn't look... - Oh... he's into the fuel.<eos> The coil sinks, and it just gets too low for him to make that jump to the next ring.<eos> Bruno's run puts him in second place with 170 points, and USA's Ken Corigliano is now the man to beat, sitting pretty in first place with 280 points.<eos> No fate is sealed for any of our remaining competitors up to this point, and now Germany's model student, Nam Vo, is next.<eos> I usually have one motto:<eos> I am fit for passion. But today, I am fit for the Beast.<eos> Bruno Nogueira is now on the bubble, and that means Nam Vo needs 180 points to eliminate him.<eos> Nam Vo from Germany.<eos> You can do it!
- Oh, my God... - Why did that happen?<eos> Thank you, Hans, Terry, and Luke.<eos> - The whole world...<eos> Level 3 is hard!<eos> - Thank you, guys.<eos> And while the South Koreans break out the tissues, we are all set to go for an exciting match-up in the finals!<eos> This is it, the final level!<eos> Ken Corigliano and Nam Vo had to muster up every ounce of strength, courage, and stamina to get to this point.<eos> Charissa, you could cut the tension with a knife!<eos> You sure can, so what do you say?
My specialty is I am an all-rounder.<eos> You must be perfect in every aspect of fitness.<eos> I am very excited to represent Germany.<eos> I don't give up.<eos> Every day I know I'm ready to go.<eos> I'm fearless, and I'm fierce.<eos> I got a lot of grit.<eos> I never back down, and I hate to lose.<eos> I don't give up.<eos> You don't stand a chance.
Air Force Ken dangling.<eos> They are tied right now.<eos> This is where they have to dig deep.<eos> Now, Nam is getting serious.<eos> He wants to show what he can do.<eos> Very little room to even get any kind of grip.<eos> He makes a jump...<eos> Ken.<eos> And he falls behind.<eos> This is really difficult because you are holding on just with your nails inside of these zigzag cracks.
It's the finals, y'all.<eos> It sure is, and here we go.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> First up, this Beastmaster has to be one of the favorites to take home the grand prize of $50,000.<eos> It's Felipe Camargo.<eos> Not only is Felipe a professional rock climber, but he was the only competitor who made it to the top of Level 4.<eos> Damn! That's right, and tonight he is back, and he is hungry for that title of Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> I'm geeked up.<eos> These guys are the best of the best of the best!<eos> You're right.
