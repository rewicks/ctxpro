- Yeah.<eos> What's in your hand?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Feel a little high strung?<eos> Go join a quartet.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Weller, get out of there.<eos> Riley's coming your way.<eos> Thanks for the heads-up.
That I, Gordon Meredith Enver, should be in your shoes, breathing your rarefied air as a beloved visionary instead of... lurking, nameless and thankless in the shadows, like some digital thug!<eos> Gord...<eos> I'm so sorry... that you feel that way.<eos> But I didn't steal anything from you.<eos> Yeah, we developed some of that code together, but then I begged you to move to Silicon Valley with me to finish it.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Yes!<eos> I remember, because I couldn't believe how little faith you had in us.<eos> In yourself.
He needs to regain his composure, and I don't think his prison cell in Zero Division is a good place to do that.<eos> Let's let him catch his breath, okay?<eos> Then we'll get right back out there.<eos> Okay, fine, but make it quick.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Place is a bit sparse.<eos> Haven't had much time to decorate.<eos> At least your doors open when you want them to.<eos> They didn't always.<eos> - Nice flowers.
It's the Awakening.<eos> It's a sacred Daedalus ritual.<eos> This better not be a sex thing.<eos> If it is, we should probably go along with it, right?<eos> We don't wanna blow our cover.<eos> I can't believe your real name is Boston Arliss Crab.<eos> I thought it was an alias.<eos> You're making fun of my name when your first name is...<eos> Wait, who's that guy?<eos> Excellent question.
Wait, who's that guy?<eos> Excellent question.<eos> I got eyes on a shady-looking dude headed straight for the exit.<eos> Follow him, but don't engage.<eos> - We're on our way.<eos> - If you want the heart of a lion, you must first be willing to consume it.<eos> Who will be the first to partake with me?<eos> Stop!<eos> No one leaves once the Awakening has begun.<eos> Uhh!
His name is Benjamin Oren.<eos> He's an executive at Northlake Military Contractors.<eos> Northlake stands to make millions if an attack on the U.S. led to military action overseas.<eos> He's sending another text.<eos> Right.<eos> We're following him into the Fine Arts building.<eos> Boston, what are you doing?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Okay.<eos> Ohh!
- Give me your other hand!<eos> I'm saving your life.<eos> Here.<eos> - Ow!<eos> - You don't wanna run towards gunfire.<eos> Gunfire doesn't kill people!<eos> People kill people!<eos> I guess, technically, gunfire does kill people.<eos> Gah!<eos> Uhh!
Here.<eos> - Ow!<eos> - You don't wanna run towards gunfire.<eos> Gunfire doesn't kill people!<eos> People kill people!<eos> I guess, technically, gunfire does kill people.<eos> Gah!<eos> Uhh!<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Sorry!

People kill people!<eos> I guess, technically, gunfire does kill people.<eos> Gah!<eos> Uhh!<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Sorry!<eos> Uhh!<eos> Ohh!<eos> Down!<eos> Uhh!
No, it's nothing like that.<eos> It's, um...<eos> All right, look, I'm with the F.B.I.<eos> There's some heavy-duty stuff going down right now, and I need to help stop it.<eos> You're about to pull a gun on me, aren't you?<eos> Wha... what makes you say that, Gord?<eos> The fact that you left the Awakening Ceremony.<eos> You're not fleeing from the sound of gunfire.<eos> Also, there's a pistol-shaped bulge in your jacket.<eos> Ohh...
- Zach sold to you?<eos> - And a few other members.<eos> Lithium was getting too expensive, but we're not gonna have that problem.<eos> No, but the F.B.I.'s already onto you.<eos> They're gonna know the truth.<eos> Once this bomb goes off, the truth isn't gonna matter.<eos> Tomorrow morning, when an entire U.S. city is glowing red, nobody's gonna care what a couple of Feds and their pet rat have to say.<eos> Now hack!<eos> I'm sorry, but my Buddhist teachings prohibit me from contributing to violence.<eos> Ohh!
Munson, let him go.<eos> Turn around, Fed, or your Buddhist friend here gets his third eye!<eos> Third eye is actually a Hindu...<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm sorry, Rich.<eos> I can't let him get away with that container.<eos> That's okay, why are you apologizing to me?<eos> - I don't know why...<eos> - 'Cause...<eos> Ohh!

Ohh!<eos> Ohh!<eos> - Put the gun down.<eos> - Okay!<eos> Back up.<eos> Strontium's been contained.<eos> - Send me an ambulance.<eos> - Agh!<eos> Rich has been shot.<eos> Twice.
You do realize that your work with us is highly classified?<eos> Well, don't I get a medal of some kind?<eos> Purple Heart, Silver Star?<eos> Redemption's its own reward.<eos> Ah, stupid spiritual enlightenment.<eos> Ow!<eos> Jeez, that's close.<eos> See ya.<eos> What if I told you I could help you solve another tattoo?<eos> What?
Human scum.<eos> Eat lunch... among other things.<eos> These are all towns in Pennsylvania.<eos> Cargo manifests.<eos> ...900 units, ...750 units, ...650.<eos> What are they shipping, blood?<eos> Tankers hold thousands of gallons.<eos> It's gotta be something different.<eos> What the hell are they up to?<eos> Fascinating question, Doc.
and that's exactly where you're going.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> If I say yes, then I am just as bad as he is.<eos> But if I say no, he's gonna send me away.<eos> You have to do it.<eos> - I can't be part of this.<eos> - It doesn't matter whether you're part of it or not; he's gonna do it anyway.<eos> If you turn him down, he'll just find somebody else to take your place.<eos> And you'll get shipped out to God knows where and nobody will ever hear from you again.<eos> And for what?
- What's wrong with you?<eos> - Need some help!<eos> - Coming through.<eos> - Rafi! Rafi! You alright?<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I was making my deliveries...<eos> - I got jumped.<eos> - By who?<eos> - By who?
Took all my shit.<eos> Let me get a towel.<eos> Let me get a towel!<eos> You're gonna be alright?<eos> Just relax, OK?<eos> Alright?<eos> Gus...<eos> There's no way two guys pulled a move like that without backup.<eos> - You're sayin' there are more?<eos> - Hundred percent.
You're gonna be alright?<eos> Just relax, OK?<eos> Alright?<eos> Gus...<eos> There's no way two guys pulled a move like that without backup.<eos> - You're sayin' there are more?<eos> - Hundred percent.<eos> It's not gonna be enough just to take out two of 'em.<eos> I'm gonna find their nest, and we're gonna burn<eos> - that damn thing to the ground.
It's not gonna be enough just to take out two of 'em.<eos> I'm gonna find their nest, and we're gonna burn<eos> - that damn thing to the ground.<eos> - I like the sound of that.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> _<eos> - Any idea what they look like?<eos> - I talked to some customers.<eos> They say the new guy has a black and grey beard.<eos> Like that guy over there?
I'm sure they care, Soph.<eos> I'm just nervous.<eos> I know it's a horrible thing what they are doing to us, but I can't help it.<eos> This baby is the only family I have left in the world and I just want to make sure that everything is OK.<eos> I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> We're gonna begin your epidural in just a few minutes.<eos> Miranda, you're gonna have to scrub in.<eos> How... how long will the operation take?<eos> Why?
I'd love to, I... but, uh, I don't deserve it.<eos> Well, I do, if you don't mind.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> But I can say from experience, it's not gonna help.<eos> Great, you're an expert on this too.<eos> Enough to know what you're going through right now.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> You're feeling guilty.<eos> Feeling angry.<eos> Mostly at yourself.
- Hey, it's all right.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> Just try to relax.<eos> I can't!<eos> - BP is normal.<eos> - Pick up some Mayo scissors.<eos> - Tell me about your kitchen.<eos> - Mayo scissors.<eos> What?
Now breathe deeply.<eos> Tell me what else you remember.<eos> Bladder blade and Richardson retractor.<eos> I remember the smell.<eos> What did it smell like?<eos> Vegetable soup.<eos> That was her favourite.<eos> Suction.<eos> And she was always playing music.<eos> What kind of music?
Bob Dylan.<eos> Simon and Garfunkel.<eos> We're ready, Sophie.<eos> You're going to feel a slight pull.<eos> Got it.<eos> - It's OK.<eos> - Here she comes!<eos> - Here she is!<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Clamp.
- It's good.<eos> - You did it.<eos> Hey, you did it!<eos> There we go.<eos> Why isn't she crying?<eos> Respirator.<eos> Miranda, why... why isn't she crying?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Relax.<eos> - One moment.
- What does she look like?<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> I want to see.<eos> Dr. Weiss?<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I've got her.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where's Olive?<eos> - Why can't I see her?<eos> - Clamp.
Jack, I love it.<eos> We need a second bedroom for the baby, right?<eos> Okay, crib can go right here.<eos> Or maybe it can go right there. Am I nesting right now?<eos> 'Cause they told me I would start nesting.<eos> Can we even afford this place? Uh...<eos> Didn't that guy say it was $200 a month?<eos> Look, I know that it's more expensive than their one bedrooms, but you like... - You like it, right?<eos> Okay, that's good, because I already put first, last and security deposit.<eos> - What? - Yeah.
It's not okay. And we need to talk about this.<eos> Uh, we...<eos> There's nothing to talk about, all right? He said medication was an option, so.<eos> Toby. - I'll leave you two alone.<eos> Um... This is serious.<eos> And this could kill you.<eos> Yeah. And so could surgery.<eos> - Uh... - Okay. You're being a child.<eos> A child?<eos> - Okay. What? Oh.
Probably.<eos> We'll, we'll play it by ear.<eos> See you later.<eos> - All right. Very cool.<eos> - I'll see you, see you...<eos> - Toby. - Oh.<eos> What's with the text?<eos> Uh, I'm gonna do it.<eos> Do what?<eos> The surgery, in an hour.
Look, you were right about me. You've always been right about me.<eos> I'm no good.<eos> I'm never gonna be any good. And I come to you, and I've got my hand out.<eos> So... can you bail me out?<eos> Wait.<eos> Jack, why are we here?<eos> Oh, I forgot something.<eos> Uh, this is the money pit that I've been working on.<eos> Hey, babe?<eos> Yeah. What?
I'm never gonna be any good. And I come to you, and I've got my hand out.<eos> So... can you bail me out?<eos> Wait.<eos> Jack, why are we here?<eos> Oh, I forgot something.<eos> Uh, this is the money pit that I've been working on.<eos> Hey, babe?<eos> Yeah. What?<eos> I bought it.<eos> What?
- Um... She, uh... she went to the dark side, man.<eos> I actually think she forgot my birthday.<eos> Yeah, well, that happens.<eos> Why don't you come out with me for a few hours?<eos> Shelly took the kids to Jersey.<eos> Give Rebecca some space.<eos> It's your last birthday of freedom.<eos> When you're done talking with your girlfriend, can you bring up some toilet paper? !<eos> Hey, Miguel, pray for me, okay?<eos> - All right, man.
I lied to my wife.<eos> She hates when I smoke, so I told her I stopped.<eos> Well, actually, I did stop.<eos> Haven't had a cigarette in a week.<eos> But yesterday I bought a pack.<eos> I just wanted to hold 'em, you know?<eos> You should tell her the truth.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Thing is, Father, we actually... haven't exactly been in a great place lately.<eos> For a while, really.
I want to be alone.<eos> Wait, you what?<eos> Jack, the house isn't done. It's not ready.<eos> There are moving boxes everywhere.<eos> I trip over them all the time. There just...<eos> There are too many things in this house, and I need you<eos> - not to be one of them.<eos> - Babe, the house isn't...<eos> Get out!<eos> What?
I love you.<eos> But do not come back into this house until you've had a major attitude change.<eos> Hey, God.<eos> I know we only talk during play-off season, but if you're listening...<eos> I'm concerned that my wife might be possessed by demons.<eos> Thanks again for the bathroom sex at Froggy's, Jack!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm a monster.<eos> Guys... ... when are you coming out?<eos> How much longer?
- No. Thank you. - Oh.<eos> If you can do that, then you will still be taking three babies home from this hospital, just maybe not the way you planned.<eos> I felt all of them, Jack.<eos> I felt all three kicking.<eos> I really felt like we were meant to have three.<eos> Me, too.<eos> What if we still are?<eos> Baby okay?<eos> You're a good man.<eos> What?
I mean, between the kids and the band now and your work schedule, I feel like we never get this kind of time for ourselves.<eos> Yeah. I mean, I pretty much have to go to a show if I want to schedule time with my wife nowadays.<eos> That's not really fair.<eos> Neither is Ben keeping you out till, you know, well beyond 11:00 most nights.<eos> He doesn't keep me out past 11:00.<eos> I'm teasing you.<eos> Um, Miguel and I have something to tell you.<eos> Yeah? What?<eos> We're getting divorced.<eos> What?
Remember that.<eos> It's past midnight.<eos> Don't be mad at Grandpa.<eos> - Nobody's mad.<eos> - I'm a little mad.<eos> Nobody's mad. We're just confused.<eos> Well, Tess asked me to teach her how to play chess, 'cause she's got a tournament at school tomorrow night.<eos> Well, I guess, technically, it's tonight.<eos> - When did you enter a chess...<eos> - Last month.
Heather.<eos> Can you give us the room?<eos> Of course.<eos> - I'll be at my desk if you need me.<eos> - I'm sure that I will.<eos> Are you having an affair with Heather?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Huh? I would never have an affair.<eos> I wouldn't do that to my kids.<eos> - So what then?
Just so they know that someone's in the stand there to support them and love them.<eos> When we play that piano gig, and he's already gone to bed, he always leaves me a glass of water on my bedside table, 'cause he's worried I'm not drinking enough water, especially when I'm singing.<eos> So, please, Ben, please do not tell me what Jack would do if he really loved me.<eos> My husband's a freaking superhero, and you have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - Okay, sorry. - It's okay.<eos> I overstepped. It's okay.<eos> - Have a good night.<eos> So I made this for my father after he passed away.<eos> It's called a memory box, and I put a lot of his favorite little things and things that remind me of him, like, um...<eos> Oh, my gosh.
- Can I take this thing off yet?<eos> - No, no, no. Not yet, not yet. - Please?<eos> - Almost. Almost, almost, almost.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Come on.<eos> - Okay. I got you.<eos> - Okay. I don't want to walk into walls.<eos> I got you... I would never... I would never put you in a wall.<eos> Can I please take this thing off?<eos> Oh, no, no. Not yet. Almost.
Thought I could will myself to be a different kind of man.<eos> I tried to lose the weight, tried to get a job my parents could brag to their friends about.<eos> I even tried to date the nice girl.<eos> Molly.<eos> I met the fiancé.<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> I guess he's your Molly.<eos> Toby is not my "Molly."<eos> You want to know what I finally figured out, Kate?<eos> What?
- You're... - Ugh. You're stuck with me.<eos> "But our love has always been worth it.<eos> I will encourage you, trust and respect you.<eos> I will create a home with you, full of laughter and compassion.<eos> I will raise a family with you, I will grow old with you,<eos> I will share my dreams with you."<eos> So today, um... in front of, uh, everyone here, I pledge myself to you.<eos> "Jack, I fall a little bit more in love with you every day.<eos> In you, I have found my soul mate, my best friend, my lover, my partner,<eos> my safe place.
Previously on This Is Us...<eos> I've decided to have gastric bypass surgery.<eos> - Uh, I'm gonna do it.<eos> - Do what?<eos> The surgery.
- I don't know, are you?<eos> Guys, we need to have a meeting.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What happened to knocking, huh? And since when do you call meetings?<eos> Yeah, last I checked, we... - we call the meetings.<eos> - Yeah. You attend the meetings, and then we continue to feed you.<eos> That's-That's the deal.<eos> What's up?<eos> We want our own birthday parties this year.<eos> - What? - What?
- The... donkey.<eos> Mom, we're gonna be ten, we're too old for donkeys and banners.<eos> I want a Madonna party.<eos> Sophie and I love Madonna.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Hold on a second, who's Sophie? - My best friend.<eos> - What happened to Grace?<eos> - We drifted.<eos> - I want a Princess Bride party.<eos> - Princess Bride?
No.<eos> Baby, do you want your own birthday party, too?<eos> - Meh<eos> - REBECCA: Kevin! - Hey.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Uh, maybe we could invite some of your friends from school.<eos> That's okay.<eos> They have a rule that if you have a party, you have to invite the whole class.<eos> It's too many kids.<eos> - The whole class?
- Meh<eos> - REBECCA: Kevin! - Hey.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Uh, maybe we could invite some of your friends from school.<eos> That's okay.<eos> They have a rule that if you have a party, you have to invite the whole class.<eos> It's too many kids.<eos> - The whole class?<eos> - So we do the whole class.<eos> The whole class!
Randall's voice, at a certain point, is gonna drop. And then Kevin's gonna... get one of those weird, wispy mustaches.<eos> And Kate... Kate's gonna get womanly.<eos> And they're not gonna need us anymore, but, you know, with kids...<eos> Jack... you are the love of my life.<eos> - And our kids are... my everything.<eos> And?<eos> I'm done having kids.<eos> - 12 hours.<eos> - 45 kids.<eos> What about a dog?
Man, I haven't been this high since the '90s.<eos> How'd you get here?<eos> I took the bus.<eos> Look at all this.<eos> Fit for a king.<eos> "But what are kings, when regiment is gone, but perfect shadows in a sunshine day?"<eos> Christopher Marlowe.<eos> Hey, you get a lunch break?<eos> I was thinking I might like to hit the town, accessorize the ol' wardrobe.<eos> - What?
- Yeah.<eos> How do you not like magic?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey, bud, do you like magic?<eos> 'Cause I hear there's an awesome magician outside in the backyard.<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - You're good?<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Hey, babe. - Come on over here a second.<eos> - Wow. - What?
- I pick, um...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I mean, they're both great. I-I...<eos> Okay, okay, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, look at me.<eos> A romantic gesture of this magnitude is only effective if it is directed at the love of your life.<eos> All right, the end of Notting Hill completely falls apart if Hugh Grant thinks that Julia Roberts is just kinda a'ight.<eos> Then he's just kind of annoying her at a press conference, right?<eos> I've never seen that movie.<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?
Sounds like a recap, not a question.<eos> My question is why, after we finally found your perfect egg cream that passed your egg cream litmus test, why, William... why are you not drinking it?<eos> It's not the right time yet.<eos> Oh, okay, no problem.<eos> Then I got plenty of time.<eos> Nothing career-defining going on at work...<eos> - Can we pull over right here? - Right here?<eos> - Pull into this parking lot. - Sure.<eos> Sure, that's...<eos> Now what?
Uh, what's happening?<eos> When I was a little boy in Memphis, there was this record shop, Hoppy's.<eos> I hear they tore it down a couple of years ago.<eos> When I was a kid, that was the place.<eos> They'd let you listen to any record, even if you wasn't gonna buy it.<eos> One of the owners... Mo Moretti was his name... He could look at you and tell what song you needed to hear.<eos> Every Saturday morning, we would wait for Mo to open up shop.<eos> He'd drive up in his all-black Cadillac Series '62, tunes flowing out the windows, cool shades, drinking a grape soda.<eos> I always wanted to be like Mo.<eos> Even if just for a minute.
Is it rage?<eos> Is it sadness?<eos> Is it fear?<eos> Maybe it's loneliness.<eos> Whatever it is, I want it to flow through your hands and I want you to let it out.<eos> All right? Let it all out.<eos> Pound it!<eos> Here we go!<eos> Let it out!<eos> One more time!
For you, Sophie... always.<eos> Kev. Hey.<eos> Sophie is Kate's best friend and she's spending the whole party with you.<eos> So don't you think that maybe... you should suggest to her that she should go play with your sister for a little while?<eos> I can't, Dad.<eos> I love her.<eos> Wow. So this whole party was for Sophie.<eos> I guess.<eos> He loves her.<eos> Oh, boy.
Which is crazy, I mean, The New York freaking Times is gonna review our play.<eos> So right now Travis Bauman and I are neck and neck to finish first place in our class.<eos> But if I don't get an A on my Hamlet essay...<eos> Hey, I will write that Hamlet essay for you if you stop telling me this story.<eos> Come on, man, it's Valentine's Day.<eos> Go on a date.<eos> Kate, do we know someone desperate enough to go on a date with Randall?<eos> Randall, ignore him.<eos> He thinks he walks on water now because he's having sex with Sophie.<eos> What?
- Ooh. Uh, excuse me. My good man, do you have this dazzler in a 56 long?<eos> I love that you love flashy clothes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, like, when did that start?<eos> I don't know, I've always just had a thing for fashion.<eos> You know, sixth grade, a well-fitting pair of Z. Cavaricci jeans and I was done for.<eos> I love learning that about you.<eos> I love telling you that about me.<eos> - Ooh, cats or dogs?<eos> - Uh, dogs.
Thank you.<eos> So, like, when did that start?<eos> I don't know, I've always just had a thing for fashion.<eos> You know, sixth grade, a well-fitting pair of Z. Cavaricci jeans and I was done for.<eos> I love learning that about you.<eos> I love telling you that about me.<eos> - Ooh, cats or dogs?<eos> - Uh, dogs.<eos> - Thank God. - Yeah.<eos> - And what about kids?
Yeah... Good news, big guy.<eos> Got it in a tall.<eos> He's got it in a tall.<eos> Randall. - Hey. - It's 11:30.<eos> I'm sorry, sorry.<eos> I... my father's nurse, I had to wait for her to show up, and then drop my girls off at school.<eos> Uh, Beth's mom broke her hip.<eos> - Yikes. - Yeah. Sorry to hear that.<eos> Hate to do this, but had to move tomorrow's quarterly with Buchanan up to this afternoon.<eos> What?
And now... he has a new car and I am in the best place I've ever been.<eos> So, any of that scare you?<eos> No... hmm<eos> Okay. Can I ask you a big one now?<eos> This is what we're doing. We're going deep.<eos> Um... you know, you never really talk about your dad's death.<eos> - That's not true. - No, I...<eos> - When we met... - No. I know, I know that you've told me the basics of how your dad died, but, uh, the-the couple times that I've brought it up you kind of shut me down, so I was wondering if you could tell me what happened.<eos> You know, exactly.<eos> What?
I didn't realize you two had gotten to know each other.<eos> Yeah, on his morning walks.<eos> We got to talking.<eos> You know, people don't stop to just talk anymore, you know?<eos> We became friends.<eos> He always asked about my daughter.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> This neighborhood will miss him.<eos> Who's it from?<eos> What?
They're just MM'S.<eos> You sure you don't have anything stronger?<eos> I want all the toppings.<eos> Are toppings disrespectful? - Top away.<eos> Go ahead. - All right.<eos> Hey, Pearson! You made it!<eos> Now, this is a first.<eos> Bring it in, come on.<eos> Can I get you a drink?<eos> - Beer.
You have so many beautiful futures in front of you.<eos> Make sure you pick a good one for me, okay?<eos> I will.<eos> And make sure that charmer cousin of yours follows your lead, not the other way around.<eos> You're the best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> - Oh, Mom. - So I just... Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna cry. I'm not, I'm not crying.<eos> Okay. Bye, now, baby.<eos> - Bye, Mama. - Bye.<eos> Oh, man.
Hey, kid's got something. Come on.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Yeah, right now.<eos> Drinks down.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Waiting two years for you to hand me something.<eos> I'm not sleeping on this.<eos> All right, give me a G.<eos> You officially ended our days as a cover band, boy!<eos> On the five!
There's nothing wrong with me focusing on my career, you know?<eos> - You mean the singing?<eos> - Yeah. I mean the singing.<eos> You do know that things are actually going pretty well for me right now, right?<eos> I sing at open mics every Friday and Saturday night at different bars around town.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah. And I just recorded a demo.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My cousin who works for Elektra Records promised that he would have them listen to it.<eos> So, things are going well for me.<eos> What?
You're an idiot!<eos> Yeah, you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached.<eos> Lose your damn head.<eos> Nobody cares about you. Nobody cares about you.<eos> You must take one pill twice a day, all right?<eos> All right? All right, David?<eos> [voices whispering] Are you nuts?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> What?
Klonopin?<eos> Yeah, Klonopin'll...<eos> Or hold the phone.<eos> Yogurt and Klonopin.<eos> [Lenny's voice slows, laughter]<eos> That'll... a cocktail... [indistinct chatter]<eos> Or hold the phone, is that... who's that?<eos> [solemn music]<eos> Ooh, a dark horse candidate. Late entry to the race.<eos> Ooh, good hair, nice hindquarters.
- Okay.<eos> There's a little something we got to clear up about last night.<eos> That happened here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a sec?<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean, not much to tell.<eos> It was just a regular day at the office.<eos> Yeah, some college kid, he came in this morning with a busted-up face, said he got attacked on his way out of here.<eos> - By who?

When she died, I didn't even get to go to her funeral.<eos> I was trying to make it here alone.<eos> But then the fire took everything.<eos> It just happened so fast.<eos> Yeah, those old buildings, they burn pretty quick.<eos> But I've never seen a fire move like that.<eos> Hey, uh... can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you ever feel unsafe?<eos> Like from you or...
Can't exactly fund every district in the country.<eos> Even billionaires don't have that kind of money.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You sound just like Lauren.<eos> Man, it is crazy how quickly she gets in your head.<eos> But by all means, you guys want to turn this world into a police state, that's fine with me.<eos> Just don't ask for my help.<eos> What does she think about all this?<eos> Hasn't really come up.<eos> - Huh. - What?
I'm-I'm...<eos> I'm the genius, but you're very smart.<eos> Let's get back to the station.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> So I was able to use the footage from Murphy's body-cam, along with some that Ada pulled off her phone to reconstruct the fire in this 360-degree<eos> - virtual view of what happened.<eos> - Hell yes!<eos> It's great.<eos> So the full-size one, it'll have the same resolution?<eos> Full-size?
Come on.<eos> Look, I'll get us some shots, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey. Hey! Get a room.<eos> Wow, I mean, I can't believe that Pete built this in one day.<eos> It's pretty cool, right?<eos> It's like being inside a KISS concert.<eos> Are you people ready to rock and...<eos> You...<eos> What?
- Boom.<eos> - What?<eos> Find something?<eos> This guy, Duke Johnson.<eos> He was the Lakefront H-VAC supervisor for both buildings.<eos> I mean, if anybody can tell us about the guys that worked there, it's this guy.<eos> But this file's ancient, though.<eos> I mean, there's no address, there's no number.<eos> It's gonna be impossible to track him this way.<eos> How about that way?
You're nervous. I get it.<eos> But just give the speech that I wrote.<eos> You are gonna do great.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What do you think about privatized policing?<eos> Like rent-a-cops?<eos> Mm. No, more like actual police.<eos> Like if people could pay for some of the stuff that the 13th District does now.<eos> What, what, what?
This could get a little loud.<eos> Go now!<eos> You got this, Murph.<eos> Just a little bit further.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, hey. We got, we got you, we got you.<eos> She's out!<eos> Thank God.<eos> And me.
May I?<eos> It's chilly in here.<eos> So, where are we?<eos> My basement lab, where I work.<eos> So you were telling the truth about being a doctor.<eos> Biotechnology research.<eos> Neurology, genetics, biochemistry.<eos> My father was a scientist.<eos> He inspired me to continue his research.<eos> Fascinating.
So how were the '80s?<eos> Hair... lots of hair.<eos> Well, Vanessa wants to see you guys ASAP.<eos> Right, thank you, Martin.<eos> Need anything else from me tonight?<eos> No, we're all set.<eos> All righty, then.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> What are we gonna tell Vanessa?<eos> Well, the truth.
Excuse me.<eos> I know you.<eos> John Stevenson is in the house. I know.<eos> Get everybody out.<eos> Seal the exits.<eos> Will do.<eos> He's here for the time machine.<eos> Break it down.<eos> Griffin. No.<eos> Griff, honey?
Josh is my guy.<eos> He's like cilantro.<eos> Green, smells great, not for everyone.<eos> There it is.<eos> I barely know this Howard.<eos> Does he paint?<eos> Does he dance?<eos> What's his art?<eos> His art is keeping people accused of murder out of jail.<eos> Oh, for God's sake!
Or Clanton's his last name.<eos> I don't really know.<eos> He's really attractive.<eos> That's Clanton?<eos> I would love to meet him.<eos> Why don't you invite him in?<eos> Dad says he's an outdoor boyfriend.<eos> I always imagined she would end up with someone different, someone successful and ambitious, urbane, with a sense of humor and a warm heart.<eos> Maybe a lawyer.<eos> Someone like...
I love Josh, but his lack of experience was weighing on me.<eos> I'm Josh.<eos> Okay. Seeing as I can't take that back, I'm going to own it.<eos> Lawrence.<eos> Oh. Josh tells me you can keep me out of prison?<eos> I can do better than that.<eos> We're not even going to trial.<eos> I love this guy already!<eos> You're pleading insanity.<eos> - What?
Listen to this.<eos> "To whom it may concern.<eos> Ever since that night at the Hendersons', my life has not been worth living.<eos> I'm ready to leave this world."<eos> Keep reading.<eos> "I committed an unspeakable atrocity that night.<eos> I arrived at the house to fix the cable, was greeted by Mrs. Henderson, and then before I knew it, I had taken the life...<eos> That's a confession!<eos> ...of three baby owls."<eos> Wha...?
He knocked over a nest when he went on the roof to fix the cable.<eos> He felt so bad about it, he thought his life wasn't worth living.<eos> So Bentman killed some owls, not Margaret.<eos> I have a hilarious joke I could make right now, but I won't out of respect.<eos> Thank you, Dwayne.<eos> Bentman had an owl-ibi!<eos> Oy, gevalt. - Say again?<eos> - What was that?<eos> Put it in, Chief!<eos> - Yeah! - Nice shot!
Not just in basketball, but in the post-game art-therapy session.<eos> All right.<eos> Quick house issue.<eos> Left about half a can of blue energy drink in the fridge after breakfast, and now, there's only a quarter of a can left.<eos> Now, I ain't pointing fingers, but it'd be cool if we could respect each other's personal space.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm not giving up on you.<eos> I've got 24 hours to get airtight evidence.<eos> I did it.<eos> What?
- Okay, great.<eos> - God, it's exciting, huh?<eos> - Yeah. My dad might finally catch a break.<eos> Why do you want him to admit to something he didn't do?<eos> I don't.<eos> I want him alive.<eos> Both physically and emotionally.<eos> I mean, I love you, but...<eos> You love me?<eos> What?
- Yeah. My dad might finally catch a break.<eos> Why do you want him to admit to something he didn't do?<eos> I don't.<eos> I want him alive.<eos> Both physically and emotionally.<eos> I mean, I love you, but...<eos> You love me?<eos> What?<eos> What? - What?<eos> - What?
And ordinarily, I would do anything Howard says.<eos> But pleading insanity means you are admitting to killing Margaret. I know you didn't do that.<eos> Summer, what do you think?<eos> I don't know, Dad.<eos> I just... I don't want you to die.<eos> And, for the record, I don't love you.<eos> It was like a "love ya."<eos> Like, "I love ya!<eos> Have a nice summer."<eos> What?
It's hard not to be after all we've been through.<eos> And so we retreat... for the familiar, places we feel safest, behind the walls of our righteous fortresses, but it's all a fairy tale.<eos> We're... we're not safe... behind these walls... not in our own homes, not inside our own skin.<eos> Because we have been deceived.<eos> But not by the Great Deceiver... because there is no Devil.<eos> Now, Devil or not, evil is real, it exists. It infects us, spreading hatred... and madness... and death.<eos> And now, today's selection from the Holy Scriptures.<eos> What shall enlighten us tonight?<eos> What words... will gird us for the battle to come?<eos> How about the Psalms?
Hurry. - Let's go. - Hey.<eos> Hey! Please don't hurt our family.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> They saw my face! Get down here.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Now we can go.<eos> We gotta split.<eos> All 3 of us.
And based on his precursor crime, it would have been difficult to predict a sharp escalation to this level of violence.<eos> Then he was manipulated into it.<eos> In fact, he may not even realize it.<eos> And if he's not the Alpha, the next likely option is the muscle, but he's our latest victim, so it has to be one of the women.<eos> The question now is, which one?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Ohh... Honey?<eos> Get over here.<eos> Come on!<eos> On your knees.
You will not screw this up!<eos> Please let me go. Please.<eos> Bethany, please.<eos> Shut up!<eos> - Sweetie...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Sweetie...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> On your back. On your back.
I know Lem's not exactly the same as us.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> There's a nest of vampires in Midnight.<eos> - Like Uncle Lem.<eos> - No. They're nothing like Lem.<eos> - So should we be worried?<eos> - No. We should be prepared.<eos> Go get a knife.<eos> I don't think I've ever seen you in my church before.<eos> First time for everything.
- I made you. - We're family.<eos> - My family's here now.<eos> I'm sorry, but you can't stay.<eos> Mazatlan it is.<eos> Lem, it was good to see you after all this time.<eos> You know?<eos> You too.<eos> Let's not end the night this way?<eos> A drink?<eos> For old times' sake.
Mazatlan it is.<eos> Lem, it was good to see you after all this time.<eos> You know?<eos> You too.<eos> Let's not end the night this way?<eos> A drink?<eos> For old times' sake.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Right.<eos> To old friends.
Snuck in.<eos> You really stepped up, risking your life like that.<eos> Thank you. You saved everyone here.<eos> I never intended to taste your blood.<eos> I wasn't about to let you die.<eos> Even after you heard about who I was?<eos> Dark past?<eos> Join the club.<eos> Might want to clean up.<eos> For what?
You didn't entrust him to a relative? Get a shovel, I'll show you where he's buried.<eos> Why would you take that.<eos> Upon yourself, franz? Because as a genetically. Defective child, he was a waste of the nation's resources.<eos> Because it was the will of the reich.<eos> Be that as it may, Your file is peppered. With inconsistent and insubordinate.<eos> Behaviour. Not to mention the loss of jacques rigaud.<eos> Judging by facts, not words,<eos> It's frankly hard to tell which side you are on. What are your specific plans as a triple agent?<eos> I will continue to cultivate my relationship.<eos> With that cell of agents...
Which is why he is in berlin. And, as it happens,<eos> I will use his son against him, And duncan sinclair will do anything we ask.<eos> The gala tonight is here at an estate on the edge. Of this park.<eos> Himmler's presence means the place will be airtight.<eos> I made contact with manfred franke at the reichsmuseum. He helped us. Build helene bauer's cover.<eos> I've convinced him.<eos> To offer a few. Of the museum's best pieces to be displayed in the hall tonight. In honour of the historic occasion.<eos> He'll give us access. To the art before it's delivered.<eos> And we'll use that to smuggle in a bit. Of explosive, about this much.<eos> As well as pencil fuse.
You're sure?<eos> Positive. When is the delivery staff expected?<eos> A little over an hour.<eos> Does that leave you.<eos> Enough time for...?<eos> Ample. Because I can't have anyone walking in and seeing.<eos> Unaccredited individuals.<eos> Of course not. I'd have trouble explaining it of course.<eos> May I ask. What exactly it is that you are intending to do?<eos> Some kind of listening device?
We captured an additional spy. Perhaps that man can be executed and brigadefuhrer faber.<eos> Could still pursue his work with sinclair.<eos> Their minds are made up. Your man here.<eos> Can start interrogation on the brit. And, in the meantime, why don't you. Return to your responsibilities to obergruppenfuhrer schmidt.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> In the middle of the day?<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> Security protocol one!<eos> Proceed to the closest shelter. Go! Let's go!<eos> Security protocol one!
You're ok.<eos> Alfred, you're ok.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Are you?<eos> I am.<eos> What is it that you were afraid to tell me?<eos> Don't do this to yourself; Let me help you.<eos> I don't want you to remember me. As that.<eos> As what?<eos> A monster.
Don't do this to yourself; Let me help you.<eos> I don't want you to remember me. As that.<eos> As what?<eos> A monster.<eos> The reason why I went. To faber that once?<eos> I did something terrible, And I couldn't face you.<eos> Nothing you can say changes. How I feel about you.<eos> I killed an innocent man... At schmidt's party.<eos> One of the jewish servants, I murdered him.<eos> And for what?
You don't know a damn thing.<eos> We know your mother loves you.<eos> Just let that girl go and see for yourself.<eos> We could take you to her right now.<eos> Liars!<eos> You just got the victim killed and lost the unsub.<eos> Not exactly a win.<eos> You're all regional coordinators with a few years on the job, and this is an advanced training seminar.<eos> You gotta do better than that.<eos> So what else?
We all are.<eos> We know what this case means to you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I don't need help.<eos> I've personally spoken to the parents of every single one of Tommy Yates victims, and I'm not about to change that now.<eos> Mrs. Wilson?<eos> I'm SSA Rossi, but you can call me David.<eos> I want to thank you for coming in.<eos> Is there anything I could get you...<eos> Water, coffee?
Because all the answers aren't all out there.<eos> Most are right here.<eos> And that's the job.<eos> That's why we get into the mind of the killer.<eos> And if you can't get into your own head, you're never gonna get into someone else's.<eos> And the way we do that is we need a process, and we've all got one.<eos> I play the trombone.<eos> I go to the shooting range.<eos> Meditation.<eos> Jigsaw puzzles.
And the way we do that is we need a process, and we've all got one.<eos> I play the trombone.<eos> I go to the shooting range.<eos> Meditation.<eos> Jigsaw puzzles.<eos> I even know a guy who likes to box to find his zen.<eos> So what do you do?<eos> Me?<eos> I cook.<eos> Always the same dish.
We'll see about that.<eos> Ogress! "Ogress, a giant half-cyborg, half-woman, enters."<eos> Me Ogress.<eos> You die now.<eos> All right, now the next part's just wrestling.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Wrestle, wrestle, wrestle.<eos> Then cut to commercial, and then act two.<eos> "Interior, underground bunker."<eos> What?
"Interior, underground bunker."<eos> What?<eos> The Over-Madames have lied to you.<eos> Men are real.<eos> We can restore the world to the way it was before the war and women's lib.<eos> - Men?<eos> Who needs men?<eos> - We are lesbian mutants.<eos> - We worship only...<eos> - the Goddess!
- Try the punch.<eos> - I'm not 12!<eos> Where are the drugs, robot?<eos> How does it refill itself?<eos> - Rhonda, down here.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> Do you see any baggies?<eos> - No, there's gotta be a... - Ahem.<eos> Hey!<eos> What?
What the fuck is this?<eos> Costumes, characters.<eos> You look ridiculous.<eos> This is my new character, Sam.<eos> I'm not a pimp. I'm a queen.<eos> - We're exploring some ideas.<eos> - We don't need new ideas. I have ideas.<eos> Sam, your ideas are so complicated.<eos> Okay? Check this chick out, right?<eos> - Me?
Shit.<eos> Spanish.<eos> - I hope you're fucking happy.<eos> - Buy another one.<eos> Tell your mommy to take it out of your allowance.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Hey. Sam!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> You're leaving?<eos> Why?
Your fucking movies are hysterical.<eos> They're not comedies.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> We'll do it your way.<eos> All right?<eos> I'll make your show.<eos> I'll listen.<eos> I'll...<eos> Compromise.<eos> - In return...
"Sheila the She-Wolf and Ruth."<eos> Ruth isn't a wrestling persona.<eos> It's just my name.<eos> All the windows need to be open at all times.<eos> - I'm also a very light sleeper, so, the smallest noise or variance in smell will disturb me.<eos> Well...<eos> I can't fully control what happens when I'm asleep.<eos> But I'll try my best.<eos> Look, I respect how committed you are to your character.<eos> What character?
- That wouldn't make sense.<eos> - Why not? I'm Liberty Belle.<eos> I need a manservant to carry my enormous American flag.<eos> The American hero doesn't need a manservant.<eos> You're self-made.<eos> - You'd probably carry your props.<eos> - Fuck the valet, okay?<eos> Point is, you need to develop your own gimmick.<eos> - How you walk, how you talk.<eos> - Oh, like a shtick.
Kind of evil person who gives out raisins to kids on Halloween.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who said you get to invent your own character?<eos> - Well, you didn't give me one, so...<eos> - I'm still marinating on it.<eos> I get really anxious when I feel like I'm behind.<eos> Especially in a group setting.<eos> Wow, what a fantastic quality.<eos> I could pair up with someone who's the same size as me.<eos> Fine. Good idea.

Good idea.<eos> All right, how about wolf lady?<eos> Oh, no.
I was so depressed.<eos> And...<eos> I... I felt deeply connected to Anne of Green Gables.<eos> So... I wore a straw hat and puffy sleeves to school every day for a whole year.<eos> It's...<eos> You know, it's a related feeling.<eos> I haven't lived with anyone in a very long time.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Maybe we need a system.<eos> For privacy.
Oh, hey, I'm Keith.<eos> I'm Cherry's husband.<eos> - Where's Cherry?<eos> - She's taking a shower.<eos> There's no hot water in the morning, 'cause there's 14 women living in this shitty, rundown motel.<eos> Bash say, give you poolside view.<eos> Well, it's a view of the parking lot.<eos> Very convenient.<eos> Enjoy your stay.<eos> Oh, no!
I don't like being scared.<eos> Ah. That's it.<eos> That's me.<eos> - What?<eos> Where?<eos> - I'm the guy on the motorcycle.<eos> - I did two days of stunts on this.<eos> - Jesus. So, you guys are a stunt couple.<eos> - So, you've worked with Sam before.<eos> - Yeah, twice.
- I'm the guy on the motorcycle.<eos> - I did two days of stunts on this.<eos> - Jesus. So, you guys are a stunt couple.<eos> - So, you've worked with Sam before.<eos> - Yeah, twice.<eos> And partied with him an extra five years after that.<eos> In your opinion, one professional to another, do you trust him?<eos> Or is he just another white racist director?<eos> He's more sexist than racist, in my experience.<eos> - Oh, no!
- Rosen?<eos> - This is your last warning.<eos> You break curfew again, you're fired.<eos> Look, are we still doing this whole Louis Gossett Jr., Richard Gere thing?<eos> Come on.<eos> 'Cause I really don't see you up anybody else's asshole.<eos> Other people don't piss me off as much. And Sam put me in charge.<eos> I'm official now.<eos> So, deal with it, Rosen.<eos> Fuckin' anti-Semite.
I think, just, nerds try harder.<eos> - Sort of doing a werewolf thing over here.<eos> - Yeah, I like it.<eos> She's actually British, which is impressive.<eos> These two.<eos> And finally, our star.<eos> Debbie, I'd like you to meet Glen Klitnick, our phenomenal executive at K-DTV, aka, the man who's making all of our dreams come true, huh?<eos> Glen, I'd like you to meet the beautiful Deborah Eagan.<eos> You, of course, know her best as Laura Morgan.<eos> - Paradise Cove.
Uh, Glen said...<eos> - Oh, Glen.<eos> Yeah, he's a golf buddy.<eos> I owed him a favor for writing a recommendation letter to Pepperdine for my son.<eos> Give us a second to show you what we're all about.<eos> Look, this is a family business, all right?<eos> I mean, our customer is a nice suburban mom who's looking for a good deal on a wrought-iron bistro set, okay?<eos> Hey, enjoy the refreshments.<eos> Sam?<eos> What?
I guess I could work on my character.<eos> Sharpen the edges.<eos> I once went so method as April in a production of Company, my boyfriend didn't recognize me.<eos> Then he hit on me at an airport bar.<eos> And then, well...<eos> I was really great in that production.<eos> I just used my pain to emote.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Deep dive.<eos> Deep dive.
And then, well...<eos> I was really great in that production.<eos> I just used my pain to emote.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Deep dive.<eos> Deep dive.<eos> Oh, goddamnit!<eos> Fuck.<eos> You wanna order dessert?<eos> - Breakfast dessert?
Uh, excuse me. I have to go.<eos> - Go? Where?<eos> - Do you need something?<eos> I know the machine is out from diet orange, but there is grape.<eos> I'm not really a soda person.<eos> Listen, Gregory...<eos> I need to pick your brain.<eos> I don't need to pay for it.<eos> "Pay for it"?<eos> Brain picking, dick licking...
You need to be in school.<eos> And end up an old spinster librarian like you?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - I'm not a spinster.<eos> I'm a genius.<eos> And I get all the boys with my big brain.<eos> Oh, yeah, 'cause guys love a big brain.<eos> Ooh, you little guttersnipe!<eos> You're just jealous of my horse!<eos> What horse?
Today's a glorified private rehearsal.<eos> I have a star problem.<eos> What about the 12 other girls busting their ass out there?<eos> You and Barbie, get your shit together.<eos> And I'll come back when you're ready to work.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey... Can I get a little privacy, please?<eos> - What's up, old man?<eos> You need something?<eos> - Hilarious.
- Sam.<eos> Because one, she's actually talented, and two, she's gonna make you look great.<eos> Hate her all you want.<eos> Shalom, everyone!<eos> I am Gittel, the Orthodox Warrior!<eos> It's all about the Jews now.<eos> - The fuck is this?<eos> - I will beat you with a chicken.<eos> I will lock you up with my completely covered legs and guilt you into submission.<eos> What now?
What am I supposed to do?<eos> Typical whiny Soviet.<eos> "What should I do?<eos> I'm so cold, so, I only dress in gray and build things out of cinder block."<eos> Lousy Commies.<eos> You think your nukes are so big?<eos> Wait till you get a load of our warheads.<eos> Because this is the greatest country on Earth, and I am willing to fight for it.<eos> Let's go, you dirty Russian.<eos> Oh, shit.
In Soviet Union, we eat stars and stripes for breakfast.<eos> That's because there's no food.<eos> All you people have to eat are turnips, snow and misery.<eos> We are empire.<eos> Well, we are America!<eos> - Throw me.<eos> - What?<eos> Use this hand and throw me.<eos> You'll look great.<eos> - All right, on three?
Oh, my God. You sound like a Protestant.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> If any of you have any information about the whereabouts of my video camera, or if any of you happened to steal it, bring it the fuck back now.<eos> Now!<eos> No questions asked, except you'll be immediately fired.<eos> There's too fucking many of you anyways.<eos> All right, so you start with the lockup.<eos> - Then we go into the arm twist.<eos> - Ah! Then we go into the headlock.<eos> And then... hammer lock.
Now I'll move over and pull.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> And there, there.<eos> Like... ♪ Everybody's trying to break Your spirit ♪<eos> - That's how you sell it. - Yeah.<eos> ♪ Seems like it's been forever ♪<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - When you hit her, you stick your arm into her.<eos> You know? Hit her. Don't be afraid.<eos> Like that.
Little decoration for the ring from our sponsor.<eos> - Let's check it out, huh?<eos> - Right.<eos> Cool.<eos> Oh, it folds.<eos> - Yeah, this barely fit in the car.<eos> - I bet.<eos> We'll find a great place to put this.<eos> Let's get you a good seat.<eos> Check, check.
That's it?<eos> Is that "places"?<eos> Sure, Ruth. Places.<eos> Thank you, places.<eos> Can I get a little kiss for luck?<eos> You're not gonna need luck.<eos> I scripted the match so you'll win.<eos> Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.
If you're worried about your heart, give Weight Watchers a try.<eos> That guy's a jerk.<eos> Please don't tell anyone.<eos> Tell them what, that you're emotionally distressed?<eos> I've been waiting my whole life to do this.<eos> It should be in my DNA, but I didn't even make it into the ring.<eos> You don't wanna let people down.<eos> I get it.<eos> I feel like I'm disappointing a lot of people right now.<eos> What?
Happy birthday, Sheila!<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> I love birthdays.<eos> It's fine. Really.<eos> Don't make a fuss.<eos> Oh, we're going to make a fuss, majorly.<eos> Let me handle it.<eos> This is my passion.<eos> Please kill me.<eos> Not on your birthday.
It's more of, like, a therapeutic lean.<eos> My therapist taught it to me.<eos> - Why were you hugging your therapist?<eos> - Because it helps.<eos> Please?<eos> You have to put your weight on me.<eos> It's about intimacy.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We're supposed to do this for 30 seconds at a time.<eos> - Three times a day.
TWA Flight 847, hijacked five days ago by Shia Muslims, sits on the tarmac at Beirut Airport.<eos> Today, an exclusive interview with pilot Captain John Testrake.<eos> - Have you been well-treated?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Are you able to eat what you want to eat?<eos> Well, uh... They sometimes bring us airline food and they sometimes bring us, uh, Lebanese food,<eos> - and it's different, but it's delicious.<eos> - What's Lebanese food?<eos> - Like, beans or something.
You're the fuckin' producer.<eos> You're a human checkbook.<eos> And if you're not that, you're just some overeager fanboy who's sold 14 women on some crazy fuckin' pipe dream.<eos> I'm gonna get it together.<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> When there's no more money, it's over.<eos> So, we're canceled.<eos> Well, technically, you can't really be canceled if you haven't aired.<eos> But we're on hiatus.<eos> Open-ended.
- Okay.<eos> Oh, are these nail clippings?<eos> Maybe they're Fritos.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you really think the show might go away?<eos> Like, we'd all never see each other again?<eos> It's not sleep-away camp, I mean, it's... It's a job.<eos> All jobs are a crapshoot.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> What?
I haven't counted the change yet.<eos> So we'll have another car wash.<eos> We'll do a car wash every day until we raise enough money, until every car in this state is shining.<eos> - Because we have to do something.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And we'll step up our game this time.<eos> And go topless.<eos> My mom's having a fund-raiser.<eos> - For women's wrestling?
I'd like to toast my mother for organizing all this.<eos> Ah. Before I bring her up here, I'd like to bring up some other powerful, equally admirable women.<eos> Women who have struggled with drug addiction.<eos> Women who have found that showing up at a gym every day to learn how to wrestle has kept them sober.<eos> These are the women of WAD.<eos> Wrestlers Against Drugs.<eos> They've come to share their stories.<eos> If you're moved to support them, please, open your hearts and your checkbooks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - For the love of God.
So, my husband said, "It's either me or the crack."<eos> I chose the crack.<eos> Crack should be my middle name.<eos> And also my first and my last name.<eos> Eggs, bacon, bangers and mash, toast, marmite and crack.<eos> I went to three rehabs.<eos> Uh, Hazelden was the best one, so, you know, you guys... Now, if you have, like, a...<eos> If you have a fucked-up kid or whatever.<eos> Also, I did a lot of crack.<eos> Crack!
It's just about whatever's in front of you.<eos> You are pretty.<eos> I don't even know if you're over 18.<eos> But I don't care.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Whoa, whoa! - Oh, my God.<eos> - Honey, you've been following me like a puppy.<eos> I am your daughter.<eos> I'm...<eos> What?
Your father once made a magical wardrobe.<eos> It took me between realms.<eos> - My father passed. Years ago.<eos> - I know.<eos> I have all of Princess Emma's memories, too, and I'm sorry.<eos> I was hoping that maybe you still have that wardrobe.<eos> I remember the one you speak about.<eos> But I dismantled it years ago.<eos> It reminded me of darker times.<eos> No offense.
We sort of live together.<eos> Now... you might have my sword, but I've got your... This thing.<eos> Chisel.<eos> Now we duel.<eos> Hook, stop!<eos> I really need to get home and get someone off the rum.<eos> And the dessert.<eos> Sorry, Hook.<eos> I think it's time to go back to the Jolly Roger.<eos> Oh, no.
Now... you might have my sword, but I've got your... This thing.<eos> Chisel.<eos> Now we duel.<eos> Hook, stop!<eos> I really need to get home and get someone off the rum.<eos> And the dessert.<eos> Sorry, Hook.<eos> I think it's time to go back to the Jolly Roger.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.
Am I a scoundrel over there, too?<eos> No, you're not a scoundrel.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I see.<eos> And, uh, this other Robin, before he died, did he... Did I have a good life?<eos> I think so.<eos> I hope so.<eos> He helped a lot of people, which he was proud of.<eos> And he loved his friends and... family.<eos> And you.
No, you're not a scoundrel.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I see.<eos> And, uh, this other Robin, before he died, did he... Did I have a good life?<eos> I think so.<eos> I hope so.<eos> He helped a lot of people, which he was proud of.<eos> And he loved his friends and... family.<eos> And you.<eos> And me.
Oh, good. I don't want her to be a freak.<eos> And there's our problem.<eos> Ugh. I don't even want to see that.<eos> I can't believe that monster thing is in there with my baby.<eos> It's like a...<eos> Acardiac twin.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I made a guard Google it and show it to me.<eos> The way it's sucking my baby's blood just reminds me of, like, a...<eos> A vampire?
What is our goal?<eos> To have a healthy baby so that my mom can adopt her and I can see her all the time when they visit.<eos> You're sure?<eos> No baby today?<eos> There's... there's still a chance, right?<eos> Very slim chance.<eos> You know, I saw this movie once where this girl got to keep her baby in prison.<eos> They gave her a crib and diapers and everything... all in her cell.<eos> And her mom just dropped the baby off every morning, like daycare.<eos> What?

It's been oozing for days. And then there was this smell.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> No.<eos> That's definitely not normal.<eos> I'm Lee. But everybody calls me Needles.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> You know, I once helped a guy I liked rob a convenience store.<eos> You're a doctor.<eos> But before, I had a bunch of crappy foster parents. "Stars, they're just like us."<eos> What?
Maybe stay in your own lane, Dr. Bailey.<eos> Uh, that's Chief Bailey. And I've been asked to drive in yours today.<eos> And you're used to driving a luxury vehicle with cruise control.<eos> A little trickier when you're at the wheel of an '86 Datsun with the engine on fire.<eos> You know what?<eos> If I were you, I'd take a look at how I allocate my resources, is all.<eos> Come here. You'll love this.<eos> Two inmates just beat the hell out of each other. I've got one eyelid lac and a human bite to the hand.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Lidocaine.
I know you know.<eos> Where is my mom?<eos> Tell me!<eos> Rochester. Settle down.<eos> Okay, listen, we need to get your pulse rate down, okay?<eos> So just take a couple of deep breaths with me, okay, Kristen? Take a deep breath.<eos> Why won't you just tell me? !<eos> She's downstairs.<eos> - Wilson. Sorry. She doesn't want to be lied to, right?<eos> What?
You want to know what she did to end up in here?<eos> No. I really don't.<eos> We're keeping Ellie for...<eos> Hannah.<eos> Her name is Hannah.<eos> Please call her Hannah.<eos> Uh, the baby will be kept in the hospital's NICU for observation for as long as she needs.<eos> And then she can come home?<eos> And then she can go with you.<eos> Uh, any other questions?
That's it!<eos> Hold it!<eos> We got him.<eos> You did good, Pants.<eos> You know, taking a beer shower sounds great until you actually do it.<eos> I'd be happy to crack open a hydrant and hose you down.<eos> Very happy.<eos> Somehow even my underwear is soaked.<eos> Somehow?<eos> What?
Supposed to be pretty painful.<eos> Anesthesia.<eos> Yeah, but 65% of donors report back pain afterward.<eos> So something goes wrong, bone or nerve damage, you could be off the job for a while.<eos> - And you know this how?<eos> - I googled it.<eos> Aw, Stella... - What?<eos> - You care.<eos> - Yeah, so?<eos> So what?
Nothing.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's just... You... nothing.<eos> I had Lee Henry swing by the firehouse, and bring me something from home.<eos> All right. Fine.<eos> A ping-pong paddle.<eos> Please.<eos> This is a carbon fiber killerspin diamond TC.<eos> The Cadillac of table tennis paddles.<eos> No. No.
Pretty great, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You forgot to give me an emergency contact.<eos> I thought that was more like a formality.<eos> It's not.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I don't know who to put down.<eos> It's not the sat, man.<eos> Just give me a name. It doesn't have to be family.<eos> Just a responsible party.
Hey, don't lean on me.<eos> You didn't take your medication, did you?<eos> I'm sorry, Gabby.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll help get him to the ambulance, you get some ice on that eye.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Take a break, Gabby.<eos> Yeah. Something I should know about?<eos> We'll fix it as good as new, Chief.<eos> At no cost to the firehouse, obviously.
You're a tough cookie.<eos> You're gonna make it through.<eos> - I know you will.<eos> - Do I have a choice?<eos> No.<eos> Why did you decide to do this?<eos> Donate to somebody you'd never even met?<eos> You need help, it gets me out of work for a few days. Win-win.<eos> I've not always been proud of the way I've lived my life.<eos> And this...
Where's my Chloe?<eos> Kidd!<eos> Over here!<eos> I got a young girl!<eos> - Non-responsive!<eos> - My Chloe. My baby.<eos> We got her, okay? We're working on her.<eos> - Mouch, I'm gonna need a hand.<eos> - Copy.<eos> One, two, three.
I've never felt that way before.<eos> And... something else.<eos> Something...<eos> That's when it happened.<eos> David, I think... I... killed your friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Don't give a newbie a bazooka... Bazooka and act surprised when she blows shit up.<eos> What?
Wait.<eos> Let's talk about something else, okay?<eos> What did you say that article was about?<eos> A new, drug or something?<eos> It's just a closet, David.<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> You see?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> Why don't you tell me what the stars said?<eos> What?
- Tell me, have you ever seen a psychiatrist for paranoid delusions?<eos> David, what... what just happened?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your brain just lit up.<eos> There's all kinds of neural activity.<eos> I've never seen anything like this, really.<eos> That wasn't a memory. I just...<eos> I just heard my sister.<eos> Hey, don't move.<eos> What?
- Come on! - Come over here.<eos> David Haller.<eos> As I said...<eos> They have her.<eos> Division Three.<eos> They probably do.<eos> You can't help her.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - You're leaving.<eos> - Just for a day or two.
Yeah, it certainly is.<eos> Your blood claim to the throne, how do you propose we deal with that little footnote?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let the upper echelons of the nation decide behind closed doors.<eos> A privy council.<eos> Following the tribunal, I expect to remain the King of England.<eos> Long live King Robert.<eos> How long have you been here for?<eos> Most of the night.
Packing kind of light, aren't we?<eos> It's not as though you're gonna need many clothes.<eos> The tree does not grow far from the apple, Mummy.<eos> I haven't decided if I'm going yet.<eos> Why wouldn't you?<eos> There's a thing today where they pick the next King of England.<eos> Which is completely out of your hands.<eos> Go.<eos> Hm. Go!<eos> Psst! For God's sake!
Before I speak, I think... It's only fair to give my siblings to voice their support or concerns.<eos> So I humbly defer to my brother,<eos> His Royal Highness Prince Liam, whose opinion matters to me immensely, as it should to you too.<eos> Prince Liam, as your brother has suggested, would you like to share with us your perspective on these proceedings?<eos> Cyrus?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What's he planning, anyway, your brother?<eos> - He's planning to tell the truth.<eos> - The truth!
- The truth!<eos> He'll never know what it's like.<eos> When you're the first-born son, the crown is inevitable.<eos> It's only now that he's gotten a small taste of what you and I have always known... the possibility of life without the crown.<eos> I wonder how he'll behave in this moment of uncertainty.<eos> Not before the world, but behind closed doors.<eos> People are at their best, or worst, when they have an opportunity to touch greatness.<eos> I should know.<eos> I've been both.<eos> Mostly worst.
Think about it.<eos> Your Highness, I wanted to thank you for keeping me out of prison.<eos> I owe you one for tracking Ted Pryce.<eos> You let me use the family gym for that.<eos> True, so I guess you owe me one.<eos> Well, I'm afraid it's my last day on the job.<eos> I've been relieved of my position, which is... not exactly a surprise, given the circumstances.<eos> I have a feeling you won't be unemployed for long.<eos> As a matter of fact, this makes things easier.<eos> How so?
Just promise me we'll come back here when we have her.<eos> Mon frre, I love it here.<eos> All these shinny happy people.<eos> Time to go.<eos> It's a facility in the woods, so we have to go in on the ground.<eos> By which I mean, we definitely should not go in on the ground.<eos> That'd be dumb.<eos> He's gone.<eos> - Who?<eos> - David.
Thank God.<eos> You have to please just... open the door.<eos> Where's David?<eos> He was here.<eos> His sister was in the next cell.<eos> I told him... before, not now... but they took her.<eos> But that's what they do.<eos> They come, they take us away.<eos> Questions.<eos> Always the same questions.
Did you have to let him kick you in the crotch so many times?<eos> Maybe you should just... watch my back.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm done with this shit.<eos> All right.<eos> We... were wrong.<eos> We... had it all wrong.<eos> Where's David?<eos> He took her.<eos> His sister.
We thought... we were ready.<eos> What happened?<eos> So much power.<eos> It wears... a human face.<eos> What?<eos> Be careful.<eos> It... wears... A human... Face.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Miss Bird? Hello, Miss Bird?<eos> Cary?
Treating him... like the others.<eos> He is schizophrenic.<eos> This is not mental illness.<eos> I mean split mind.<eos> This monster isn't David.<eos> It's a parasite of some kind. You see?<eos> Another consciousness inside of him.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> This thing... burrowed into David's brain when he was a boy, maybe even a baby, and it has been there, feeding on him, ever since.<eos> - The memories.
There's always a fight.<eos> Wait.<eos> Be careful.<eos> There's a chance we've left the real world and that we're in David's world now.<eos> And that's bad why?<eos> Well, that would make him God and he's crazy, so... Stop it.<eos> He's not crazy.<eos> This is much, much wo...<eos> Hey, gorgeous.<eos> No, no, no, no.
Hey, gorgeous.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> This is not the talking place.<eos> This is the listening place.<eos> Such a pretty boy.<eos> And then you people... Starting putting all these ideas in his head.<eos> No, no, come... - No.<eos> White room. Now.<eos> - I can't stop her.<eos> Me. David.
Andromeda.<eos> Cassiopeia.<eos> I'm getting out tomorrow.<eos> Kissinger says I'm going.<eos> So I get to go home.<eos> No!<eos> David, wake up.<eos> I could try a shot of adrenaline.<eos> Mm-mm, no.<eos> Too risky.
Because I know.<eos> I mean...<eos> I'm pretty sure.<eos> How do you...<eos> Put your hand here.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I won't touch you. It's not my first day.<eos> Just close your eyes.<eos> Andromeda.<eos> Cassiopeia.
I mean...<eos> I'm pretty sure.<eos> How do you...<eos> Put your hand here.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I won't touch you. It's not my first day.<eos> Just close your eyes.<eos> Andromeda.<eos> Cassiopeia.<eos> Bootes.
And I saw him when we were in his mind, just before the monster came.<eos> I saw him, like a flash.<eos> He had... he was stuffing tape into his mouth, audio tape.<eos> And his hands were...<eos> - Are you saying...<eos> - Glitches.<eos> Omissions.<eos> You've seen his memories.<eos> There are rips in them, gaps.<eos> What if...
You've seen his memories.<eos> There are rips in them, gaps.<eos> What if...<eos> I've seen implanted memories before.<eos> You can always tell.<eos> Implanted from the outside.<eos> I'm talking about...<eos> He's so powerful, David.<eos> Maybe he's hidden his real memories behind fake ones.<eos> Why?
How long did you treat David?<eos> On and off for three years.<eos> Why off?<eos> People with schizophrenia are subject to delusional thinking.<eos> When David was on his medication, he was open, almost desperate to work.<eos> But when he went off it...<eos> What about drugs or booze?<eos> He had conflicting impulses, good and bad.<eos> There was a friend.<eos> A man or woman?

Before the break-in? Days or weeks?<eos> He doubled his sessions.<eos> It was clear that there were things he wanted to say but couldn't until his last appointment.<eos> Dr. Poole?<eos> What did the stars say?<eos> You're in love with him.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd very much like to see David again.<eos> Could you take me to him?<eos> Why?
I just want to ask him why.<eos> So he's in charge.<eos> Nobody's in charge.<eos> We're here together.<eos> And Melanie Bird?<eos> Is she not the leader of your little band?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> It's a trap.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Upstairs!
It's a trick.<eos> He's not...<eos> Throw them in the vehicle.<eos> I'll take them back myself.<eos> All good in the head now?<eos> You think you're safe here, with these clowns,<eos> dreaming you're a mountain climber?<eos> Look, it's your little room.<eos> I am not in the mood.<eos> Whoopsie.
Spot check.<eos> Arms out.<eos> Do we--<eos> I just-- you know I can't stand to be touched.<eos> right?<eos> Human spit?<eos> Maybe he ate yogurt.<eos> Like a creamy...<eos> What's he on?<eos> Klonopin?
Why wouldn't I be happy?<eos> I know.<eos> get out?<eos> What life is. so...<eos> it's too loud.<eos> It's life.<eos> I'm not saying-- but come on.<eos> You can't stay here forever popping pills five times a day.<eos> I'm down to twice a day.<eos> maybe...
David: Wanna be my girlfriend?<eos> gorgeous!<eos> David: I'm the magic man.<eos> - Sydney?<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> It's after hours.<eos> I'm sorry. I was just on my way back from the bathroom.<eos> Do you like music?<eos> Music?
Did you ever eat an animal that was still living?<eos> There's a... Smell.<eos> A heat.<eos> You're burning up.<eos> Cary!<eos> Cary!<eos> my love.<eos> But there's just no place to go.<eos> Amy: Nobody wants you here.<eos> What?
And anyway, with that kind of thinking... With that kind of thinking, wars would never end.<eos> David, read his mind.<eos> You have the power.<eos> You can control it now.<eos> We may never get this chance again.<eos> To know what D3 knows.<eos> Their operations, their spies, their tactics.<eos> Read his mind.<eos> So use him, you're saying.<eos> And then what?
The... the halo is losing power.<eos> Hey, kid! And when it fails?<eos> Think of the Shadow King as a computer virus.<eos> It's been in David's head for decades.<eos> Learning his systems, bypassing his defenses.<eos> Now it's ready to override the original program.<eos> Meaning me.<eos> Exactly. Meaning you.<eos> If we don't get Amahl Farouk out of your head today, he will erase you.<eos> Permanently.
Have I seen you before?<eos> No, don't tell me.<eos> - I'll remember.<eos> - Oliver, could we talk?<eos> What's happening, space captain?<eos> Uh... W-would you like to have dinner with me tonight?<eos> Well, uh, I'm on a mostly liquid diet.<eos> - I like liquid.<eos> You know, uh, you remind me of someone.<eos> Your wife?
About David.<eos> He's a world-breaker.<eos> And if you'd killed him before he figured that out, then maybe your tactical forces and... what is it?<eos> World coalition? Maybe that would've impressed me.<eos> But not now.<eos> Well, kid... you better learn to fly like a bird, because the age of the dinosaur is over.<eos> Feel real. - A simulation.<eos> - Are you real? - No, this is real.<eos> What is the the point of life? - I don't have...<eos> - Pretty sure.
So you can melt their heads?<eos> All right, this meeting is over.<eos> No, I need a meeting so that I can change their mind...<eos> We need to get him to the lab.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> Is he sick? Nothing.<eos> Ptonomy, get him to holding.<eos> He's not sick.<eos> He has some kind of creature in his head.<eos> A mutant. Very old.
Tell him to move one click closer then hold.<eos> I'm giving your man another hour.<eos> Mm, what happened?<eos> Doesn't matter, we'll probably all be dead in ten minutes.<eos> Why am I tied down?<eos> You tell me.<eos> God, I can feel him inside, trying to force his way out.<eos> Use your power.<eos> You just have to hold on for a little while longer.<eos> God. And then what?

And then what?<eos> Then... when we pull, you push.<eos> What...
For a long time, I thought it was a dream.<eos> Yeah, that was him.<eos> Oh, what did he do with it?<eos> What did he do with it?<eos> - What did he do with it?<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - He was just a baby. - What did he do with it?<eos> He's not a baby now.<eos> Uh-oh. Looks like one of the animals is out of its pen.<eos> Fascinating.
Isolate it and end the hospital fantasy.<eos> Unfreezing time and executing your friends in a hail of bullets, unfortunately.<eos> Unless we can physically change the dynamic of the room.<eos> Block the bullets, move the bodies.<eos> We're going to need everybody.<eos> May I introduce you to my friend, Jules Verne?<eos> It's all right.<eos> He can't hear us in here, the monster.<eos> He's very powerful, but Oliver has a few tricks - left up his sleeve.<eos> - First of all...
Well, ha... look around, pal.<eos> We're in a locked coffin, underground.<eos> - Right.<eos> - There is no way out.<eos> Tell me, how can we be underground when we're not even inside our body?<eos> So if there's no body and no ground, then there's no coffin.<eos> It's just an idea.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Good. Now, I want you to imagine a classroom.<eos> A what?

Now, I want you to imagine a classroom.<eos> A what?<eos> A classroom.<eos> With a blackboard. We're gonna figure this thing out, you and me.<eos> Once and for all.
That's why we gotta help each other.<eos> There he is, big as life.<eos> The lock was all rusted up, so I had to cut it off with a saw.<eos> You ready to do some shopping?<eos> All right. All right, now aside from the akms, the Beretta AR70s, and the Daewoos, over here I got your magnesium flares... stun grenades... and toe poppers still packed in the DOD Bubble Wrap.<eos> This... isn't how we fight them.<eos> Well, good luck and God bless us all, but me and Rosie, we're gonna dig in.<eos> They come after us, they're gonna get a fight.<eos> I need to protect what's mine.<eos> - Another one?

What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You're Kyle Barnes?<eos> I'm sorry. I... I didn't know.<eos> They were possessed, and then... saved.<eos> He's around. He brought us here.<eos> We needed to find our own place.<eos> - At a church?<eos> - It's not like that. They're all like me.<eos> Saved?<eos> By who?
It's supposed to get hot today.<eos> That body's gonna get pretty ripe in the back of your truck.<eos> Stop.<eos> And we need to do something about Kat 'cause...<eos> I just left her in that warehouse,<eos> - and somebody's gonna find her, so...<eos> - I'll handle it. It's my mess, Byron, I'll clean it up myself. Rose.<eos> We are in this together.<eos> Well, maybe we should plant something here... after.<eos> Some annuals.
So, I'll, uh... I'll be back tonight to look in on y'all, all right? - Okay.<eos> Now, if we wait long enough this problem may just solve itself.<eos> You mean we just sit here and watch him die?<eos> Why not?<eos> Let you off the hook from having to make an actual decision.<eos> But I can make it even easier for ya.<eos> You're out of time.<eos> You can feel it, can't you, Kyle? The darkness closing in.<eos> No. The only thing I feel?<eos> Your desperation.
Dot! Dot? Oh, what happened?<eos> What did you do?<eos> Shit! Oscar! Oscar!<eos> What happened? ! She wouldn't let me leave.<eos> She drugged me.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> She came after me!<eos> She wanted to use this on my baby.<eos> Why?<eos> What?
Nice touch, huh?<eos> The old "turn the tables" thing.<eos> What are you doing here, Blake?<eos> I didn't think you were gonna remember me.<eos> You need to let me go.<eos> Well, I'm not locked up anymore, Outcast, so I don't need to do anything I don't want to do!<eos> I can eat when I want, sleep when I want. I shit when I want.<eos> Come here. Fuck when I want.<eos> Hey, hey! Well, that'll be a neat trick.<eos> Huh? Even for you!
Well, I'm not locked up anymore, Outcast, so I don't need to do anything I don't want to do!<eos> I can eat when I want, sleep when I want. I shit when I want.<eos> Come here. Fuck when I want.<eos> Hey, hey! Well, that'll be a neat trick.<eos> Huh? Even for you!<eos> Use the Force.<eos> Just tell me what you want.<eos> What I want?<eos> I had a dream.<eos> A vision, actually.
That was just to get our attention.<eos> But look at the second sentence.<eos> "My heart is as cold as Ike."<eos> But Aunt Josephine said she liked to think of her husband someplace hot.<eos> "As cold as ice" would make a lot more sense.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Unless these aren't grammatical mistakes at all.<eos> They're a message.<eos> Aunt Josephine said she and Ike developed secret codes.<eos> C for "ice" instead of "Ike."
They never told us about you. They never told us about Uncle Monty.<eos> I have a feeling there's lots of things they never told us about.<eos> Your parents, Baudelaires, wanted to raise you in a quiet world, far away from the fiery injustices that were threatening all of us.<eos> They were trying to keep you safe.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - No. No, it didn't.<eos> Not long after this photograph was taken, your parents and I had to make a vastly frightening decision.<eos> I remember that day so well, Klaus.<eos> Your mother had just wrestled one of our enemies to the ground, when she turned to me and said...<eos> - What? - Uh-oh.
I ate a banana just before you arrived.<eos> - I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Leeches are very small animals.<eos> If we were in the water, we might have reason to fear, but I doubt they'd attack a sailboat.<eos> Hurricane Herman might have even scared them out of the territory.<eos> You see?<eos> We're perfectly safe.<eos> Yeah. Perfectly safe. See?<eos> They're leaving.<eos> Uh oh.
Later.<eos> I am ready to be fierce and formidable again myself, and to face you, Count Olaf!<eos> I have had enough of your schemes!<eos> I have had enough of your plots!<eos> I have had enough of your greed and your betrayal.<eos> Listen to me, Olaf, you villain, you wretch, you vastly untalented actor!<eos> I'm going to tell you something I should've told you a long time ago.<eos> And what might that be?<eos> It's "have"!<eos> What?
Look at her pantsuit.<eos> I'm surprised at you, Baudelaires.<eos> Women can be doctors just as men can be receptionists.<eos> I'm talking about the receptionist.<eos> Hi, I'm Cookie.<eos> Shirley?<eos> - I'm Shirley. Cookie?<eos> - Don't mind if I do.<eos> Did you consider our little proposal?<eos> - What proposal?
You will awaken from your trance when I say the word...<eos> Charles... would you like to do your impersonation of a chicken?<eos> I told you to wait in the waiting room.<eos> - Did you?<eos> Charles, would you like to stop?<eos> - That's Shirley?<eos> - We should go before she sees us.<eos> Wait.<eos> I really wanna practice saying the secret words.<eos> Why?
- That's Shirley?<eos> - We should go before she sees us.<eos> Wait.<eos> I really wanna practice saying the secret words.<eos> Why?<eos> So you could take over and you wouldn't need me anymore?<eos> - Someone has trust issues.<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> I dated you!<eos> Secret words?
You're just in time to see the accident.<eos> It's not an accident.<eos> You're doing this on purpose!<eos> Let's not split hairs.<eos> That's Klaus' job.<eos> And you can shout as much as you want.<eos> Your brother isn't here right now.<eos> Poor little orphan.<eos> Haven't you learned anything this year?<eos> Week?
I'm unstoppable!<eos> Why do you hate us so much?<eos> Because it's fun.<eos> How are you doing back there, Charles?<eos> Oh! Just peachy!<eos> Wait till Sir finds out that his partner's been turned into human boards.<eos> I bet he won't even wait until the morning to fire...<eos> Where am I?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
And, "We're going to kick you out and have your license revoked, and if we ever have children, we're never gonna let you anywhere near them!"<eos> Well, I showed them!<eos> I don't think I can hold them off much longer, boss!<eos> I'll show everyone!<eos> It was never about the fortune.<eos> - It's about... - Ah!<eos> Sometimes when we are startled by a loud noise or an angry mob looking to confront their hypnotist, we take a step back.<eos> Dr. Orwell was right.<eos> There was a fatal accident at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill that night.<eos> Nice catch.
Sorry, I have my own life now, with my own evil scheme, which I've put a lot of work into and I don't need you ruining, like that bar mitzvah.<eos> What if I told you we had another chance to destroy the Baudelaires?<eos> The Baudelaires?<eos> Well, their miserable children this time.<eos> Fate has brought us together, my pet.<eos> Fate and fortune.<eos> How big a fortune are we talking?<eos> Is Sunny asleep?<eos> She's dreaming about biting something.<eos> Why?
That can't be legal.<eos> It's not like we have a constitution.<eos> If this place is so miserable, why don't you leave?<eos> Lucky Smells is our life.<eos> Lucky Smells is our home.<eos> We need to find those answers and get out of here, fast.<eos> According to the map, the mill library should be just behind... behind this door.<eos> Trying to get out of log day, are you?<eos> We wanted to visit the library on our lunch break, Sir.<eos> Oh, what a lovely idea.
The truth is right there in your book.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I had it redacted.<eos> - Sir, you defaced your own book?<eos> - I didn't have a choice.<eos> Charles, we made certain deals to keep this mill open.<eos> And if she wants us to cover up the truth and blame the fire on the Baudelaires, well... that's the cost of doing business.<eos> Is it really worth it?<eos> This mill is all I have, Charles.<eos> And you.
- Because you broke your glasses.<eos> Because of this town.<eos> Everyone thinks our parents did this bad thing, but they never even met them.<eos> Well, I'm not like everyone else.<eos> You don't believe it.<eos> I met your parents.<eos> Standard procedure for nervous little boys.<eos> That's standard, too.<eos> Now focus here, Klaus, and tell me what you see.<eos> An E or an A?

An E or an A?<eos> - An... - An E or an A?<eos> - An A.<eos> - An A or a C?<eos> - A C.<eos> - A sea or a lake?<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - A reptile or an amphibian?<eos> Fire or accident?<eos> A blonde or a bottle blonde?
"How did you survive World War I?"<eos> Hey, I'm really glad you asked, because I was a prisoner of war!<eos> - Jennifer... - And you, Grandma Time!<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Check your mail?<eos> Been sending you messages, leaving clues!<eos> I even wrote an album!<eos> Hmm? "Délivrez-moi de France"...<eos> "Rescue me from France."<eos> "Toujours en 1921"...
- And some... some new clothes.<eos> - Top.<eos> You look like a serving wench.<eos> Oh, by the way... you were never forgotten.<eos> Hannah even kept your, uh... your tortoise, Terry, alive.<eos> Damn thing eats better than we do.<eos> I know how you're gonna find her.<eos> How?<eos> Can you feel it?<eos> What?
- You're right.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> Mother?<eos> Listen to the voice of your daughter, Katarina.<eos> You're a mother. Now think like one.<eos> The Guardians are gone.<eos> James and Cassandra have found their son.<eos> What would you do?<eos> Where would you go?<eos> Somewhere safe.
A scolding?<eos> A lecture, perhaps.<eos> I'm about to be talked wit and wisdom by two people younger and less traveled than myself.<eos> There's a turnout for the books.<eos> I thought you were inevitable.<eos> Written.<eos> Every little kick was like... a knife in my heart.<eos> When you left me, I felt... free.<eos> But then I saw you.<eos> Only for a second.
When are we exactly?<eos> December 26, 1959.<eos> Right after I undid our lives here.<eos> This would've been your home.<eos> I know when they are.<eos> It's now.<eos> It's here.<eos> The end.<eos> They're coming for me.<eos> For you.
Now, I supposed... That's your job.<eos> Surely you've realized by now.<eos> Took me so long to see it.<eos> The thing I believed I was meant to become...<eos> A sad, lonely, demon at the end of time...<eos> Was never me.<eos> Ensuring my own creation meant ensuring yours.<eos> The promise of a timeless realm.<eos> The deceiver... It was always you, Olivia.<eos> What?
"she had seen them coming, and so sent the winged monkeys after them."<eos> All right, James.<eos> Bedtime for Bonzo.<eos> Keep going.<eos> I know there's more.<eos> Yeah, there's the whole ending here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Let's see here.<eos> "There once was a serpent... "who only traveled one direction.<eos> "Always forward, never backward.
Maybe this is a good thing.<eos> If the phones are missing, it means they're in play.<eos> Yeah, but you missed the window.<eos> The sale is over.<eos> The merchandise is gone.<eos> How can you track down something that you couldn't even get when it was right in front of you?<eos> If the AIC is now training,<eos> Owen is training them.<eos> I just need to figure out...<eos> What?
What was your approach?<eos> Being Alex Parrish.<eos> Celebrity works.<eos> I've already got Stephanie, Courtney, and, um, Samantha.<eos> I'm still working on Jeanne, but she'll fold.<eos> I agree.<eos> You look comfortable, so they feel relaxed.<eos> Perfect approach.<eos> Clearly, being Alex Parrish works for you.<eos> What?
Okay, well, that is a new one on me.<eos> I'm gonna go get Miranda.<eos> Wait.<eos> She's here?<eos> She didn't answer my last call.<eos> You called her?<eos> She didn't tell you?<eos> I'll find her. Okay.<eos> I'm... I'm coming with you.<eos> Just in case.
Just in case.<eos> Something doesn't seem right.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I'm standing with the man I'm gonna marry and trying to spot the man that I have to wake up with.<eos> Traditional wedding in a white dress is definitely not in our future.<eos> Who'd you get?<eos> She's pretty.<eos> And there's your guy.<eos> To the bride and the groom!

Okay.<eos> Well... we promised each other we'd tell the truth in here, and since it's our last night, I hope you don't mind what I'm about to say.<eos> They chose me, Alex, not you.<eos> It's over.<eos> That's what I wanted you to believe.<eos> I was hoping you'd call.<eos> Well, that's good to hear.<eos> You promised me dinner.<eos> When's that happening?<eos> How about this weekend?
Of course.<eos> Well, why didn't you say that?<eos> Because I didn't want you to worry.<eos> No, it's fine. I'll be fine.<eos> Just go. Go right now.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> I don't want Rhys to die.<eos> I don't either, but I also don't have $3 million lying around.<eos> What?
I think our friend, the Consul General of Japan, is an alcoholic.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> 'Cause she just confessed to every imaginable indiscretion except diamond-smuggling.<eos> And then she kissed me.<eos> Wow, Rhys is gonna be sorry he missed that.<eos> And then she threw up on me.<eos> She ate a lot of sushi.<eos> Kohana's not our smuggler.<eos> Jesse is.<eos> What?
I've got this.<eos> No, I've got this.<eos> Jesse doesn't have diplomatic immunity.<eos> If we can get proof, I can arrest him.<eos> I'm gonna have to call you back.<eos> $3 million.<eos> Plus interest.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We had to charge Tommy.<eos> What? For what?
He knows that.<eos> Theo Tasker killed the Kincaids.<eos> And we will prove that.<eos> We'll get Tommy out.<eos> And in the meantime, your brother will be safe in custody overnight.<eos> Yeah, because nothing bad ever happens to people in jail.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Rhys!<eos> Benji!<eos> Just in time for dessert.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah.<eos> Y-You put me there.<eos> So you'd be safe.<eos> Where is the money?<eos> Tommy, listen to me.<eos> I said, where is the money?<eos> Where is the money?<eos> Where'd you get a gun?<eos> Allie... where is the money?<eos> Why?
You'll bring my $3 million and you'll bring Tommy.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I just want to talk to him.<eos> You want to talk to him?<eos> I have him right here.<eos> 4:00 P.M., Ms. Vaughan...<eos> The money and your brother.<eos> Or I'll come to you.<eos> What'd he want now?<eos> You.
Roll on them.<eos> I'm sure you have enough information to dismantle the entire organization.<eos> Release the money... now.<eos> Or you'll do what?<eos> You'll shoot me, the way you shot the Kincaids?<eos> No, I shot them in the chest.<eos> You, I'll shoot in the head.<eos> You guys get that?<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> On the ground... now! On the ground... now!
We both know you stole the diamonds.<eos> Now, you see what he's doing?<eos> First he sleeps with your girlfriend...<eos> - He did not.<eos> - Repeatedly.<eos> And then he steals the diamonds, blames us so he can keep her cut.<eos> You think I'm rogering this girl senseless for the diamonds?<eos> He is not.<eos> Isn't that why you rogered me?<eos> - What? - What?
Hey, Nick.<eos> The cartel money is evidence now, so I'll just go get it.<eos> _<eos> You forgot to say goodbye.<eos> You are really very, very good at your job.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I put a tracker in the bag.<eos> 'Cause you knew that I would steal it.<eos> I hoped you wouldn't, but...<eos> So... what now?
What are these buildings?<eos> They're all owned by the Firm.<eos> Including the church?<eos> No, the building next to it.<eos> They're not even here, are they?<eos> You stashed them in the Rectory.<eos> Get out!<eos> I will when you give me my diamonds back.<eos> Sophie, can you check to see if that has a rectory?<eos> Why?
There's no need to worry.<eos> It's taken me a lifetime to find a home where I'm accepted, so I worry.<eos> If anything happens, don't hesitate.<eos> Make sure no one's hurt.<eos> I feel dread.<eos> Something is different.<eos> We do this every month.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow morning.<eos> You were right.<eos> Some seriously bad mojo.
I was right about the gun.<eos> - That was very specific.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> Specific.<eos> The night Aubrey died, she was taking a walk, clearing her head.<eos> She didn't know what to do.<eos> She wanted to tell Bobo she'd lied, but she was scared.<eos> She didn't want to lose him.<eos> - And she said all this?<eos> - In a way.
Just scratch that.<eos> You can stay as long as you need. Where's Creek?<eos> - She said she was working.<eos> - She is, just not here.<eos> Creek! Creek!<eos> Creek!<eos> Come here!<eos> - What was that?<eos> - It's a tiger.<eos> What?
No, she did.<eos> So, if it bites you, do you...<eos> You're born a were, dimwit.<eos> Not exactly common knowledge.<eos> Weretigers are rare nowadays.<eos> - So the Rev did that?<eos> - Such a waste.<eos> You're bleeding, aren't you?<eos> - A little.<eos> - More than a little.
But...<eos> I need someone a lot more powerful than me.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Long story.<eos> I'll be back in a sec.<eos> Where you going?<eos> I need some magic from the stash.<eos> Where are you going with your great-great-great-great grandma's skull?<eos> You said she was powerful, and I need her help.<eos> Yikes.
Her husband asked her to get to know you, but what she felt for you, that was...<eos> That was real.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> But the woman I love, she didn't exist.<eos> Bobo.<eos> Glad to have you back.<eos> Nice to be back.<eos> I'm just checking. How's the stitches?<eos> Painful.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But um...
Painful.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But um...<eos> At least there's a good story with the scar.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Looks like you're making yourself at home.<eos> I thought for sure after the tiger and the ghosts, you'd be gone.<eos> Well, I can't leave now.<eos> I got a sign.<eos> Well?<eos> Well, what?
Looks like someone's raising the bar on breakfast.<eos> Good luck topping this one.<eos> That sounds like a dare.<eos> Maybe because it is.<eos> So, uh, maybe now that this is a thing, we can agree on, say, an MPAA rating for communal spaces?<eos> Sorry.<eos> We'll keep it pg.<eos> Liv?<eos> Is she having a small stroke, or...<eos> Zombie vision.
She was always wrapped up in some drama or whatever...<eos> You saw her room?<eos> Bit of a mess.<eos> That's what she was...<eos> A hot mess.<eos> Sounds like it could be exhausting.<eos> Sometimes, kinda.<eos> Yeah, she was messy, self-centered, dramatic, kinda scatterbrained, usually late with rent.<eos> It was like having a real-life soap opera play out in front of you.<eos> Oh, boy.
The bar downtown?<eos> So cool...<eos> Yvonne put that up. She was DJ'ing there.<eos> She DJ'ed at ice ship?<eos> Hashtag, my kind of cool bitch.<eos> I told you, she was so talented.<eos> She could've been a star if she hadn't been murdered.<eos> It so sucks when that happens.<eos> Clive, we have to go to ice ship, it's just like the bomb.<eos> And, also for clues and stuff.
- I'm fine. C'mon.<eos> On the house. Anything.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To be human again.<eos> Well, things are tough all over.<eos> Not entirely.<eos> My dad owns an airline, and my trust fund kicked in last year.<eos> I can get you $1,000,000,000 in cash.<eos> Now.<eos> For a cure.
I only solved it basically single-handedly.<eos> Where's my credit?<eos> I'm not sure Clive can put the stuff you do in police reports.<eos> I guess.<eos> Strange case.<eos> He confessed even though you didn't have much hard evidence.<eos> I bad copped him.<eos> He folded like that.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> - What?
Don't take all day, Joel.<eos> These lights are giving me a headache.<eos> Yeah, I knew.<eos> I stopped by her place after work. She told me.<eos> So you went to her place the night she died?<eos> You failed to mention that before. What was the purpose of your visit?<eos> Just...<eos> I knew she had a rough day.<eos> And I promised to loan her some money. How much money?<eos> What for?
We detect things!<eos> No joke.<eos> Does anyone have, like, an aspirin or ibuprofen?<eos> As Ms. Moore was saying, it appears you were hoping for something beyond friendship.<eos> You were totally into Yvonne, but she friendzoned you.<eos> She wanted your money, but she didn't want you.<eos> She didn't even take the money.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I don't know, she just said she didn't need it.<eos> - Or me. - Ugh.
Pinot.<eos> Major took the cure?<eos> When?<eos> Couple days ago.<eos> Liv said his memory has started fading.<eos> It's heartbreaking.<eos> Yeah... that's how it goes.<eos> Poor major.<eos> So?<eos> So, what?
And he could be wandering around forever.<eos> Guys, he should be getting his memory back soon.<eos> - What?<eos> - The zombie cure works.<eos> No side effects beyond a couple days of memory loss.<eos> I heard it straight from the horse's ass's mouth.<eos> - Wait, you're saying...<eos> - Yeah. Turns out Blaine was lying this whole time.<eos> He never lost his memory?<eos> Just for a day or two.
I was never going to keep you.<eos> I'll be back in time for tea.<eos> Anne...<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Cuthbert.<eos> I, uh... didn't say I'd hire a boy to be rid of you.<eos> It was in hopes that you could stay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll never forget you.<eos> You take care now Anne with an E.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake.
Yes, Miss Cuthbert.<eos> Wipe that silly grin off your face.<eos> I wouldn't give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman.<eos> Trouble is, I don't know about keeping her.<eos> She's an interesting little thing.<eos> More to the point if she was a useful little thing.<eos> I propose we give her a one-week trial to see how she behaves.<eos> She has five days.<eos> I'll need a lot of convincing, that's for certain.<eos> Oh, for Heaven's sake.
- Thank you.<eos> I'll just come in and sit a spell, shall I?<eos> Catch my breath.<eos> I've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.<eos> I don't suppose you're any more surprised than I am myself.<eos> What an incredible mistake.<eos> The mind reels.<eos> Couldn't you have just sent her back?<eos> We may yet, but for now, she's here on trial.<eos> Trial?

- If you stay here, perhaps you two will become friends.<eos> A real friend. Let go!<eos> Let go of me! Shut it!<eos> I mean it.<eos> Go get it.<eos> - Hold her down. - Please... don't!<eos> Don't!<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Guess what, Princess Cordelia. We're sick of you and your stupid stories! - Stupid stories!<eos> - Liar!
But we all have the power to disarm the enemy, to starve them of the collaborators they need.<eos> We only need to unite behind the law of our bloc.<eos> If you collaborate, you die.<eos> We're good.<eos> Make copies and have them distributed.<eos> I want this hitting the streets just as the news starts to spread.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've been preparing for this moment for a long time.<eos> Today we hit them where they live.<eos> To liberty.

Now you only have to focus on why you came.<eos> To end the Occupation.<eos> There's another soldier I'd like you to meet.<eos> Uh, Patrick, this is Bram.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Good to meet you.<eos> Everyone's gonna work in pairs today.<eos> Maybe you could partner with Bram?<eos> No problem.<eos> To liberty.

What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> You got out of the camps?<eos> They just released me.<eos> And you came here?<eos> I tried to go home, but the Occupation took over our house.<eos> There was an attack...<eos> What attack?<eos> Your mom. She's part of the Resistance.<eos> What?
Technically, that's true.<eos> I must admit to a certain fondness for Los Angeles.<eos> I always loved visiting... before.<eos> I share the sentiment.<eos> I've lived here for a long time.<eos> You must understand that I've come to Los Angeles only to gather information.<eos> Others will be reaching the conclusions.<eos> Of course.<eos> I just wanted to be sure that you had all the information.<eos> On what subject?
Stan was driving Cindy to ice skating practice around 4:00 a.m...<eos> When someone T-boned their car.<eos> That's when I should've said "ouch."<eos> Hit and run?<eos> The crime scene tech says the other vehicle was accelerating at the point of impact.<eos> Kind of an ill-conceived murder plan, isn't it?<eos> A smashed-up vehicle is a pretty difficult weapon to hide.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> A big truck could've rammed into a subcompact like this and driven away with not much more than a scratched-up bumper.<eos> What?
Major and I haven't eaten since Janko, so...<eos> Two brains.<eos> That is convenient.<eos> So that's what you...<eos> You get to a crime scene, and you think...<eos> So, she's gonna...<eos> She just cooks 'em up right...<eos> It's better if you don't over think it.<eos> Something smells good.<eos> Just in the nick of time.
- But I'm just trying...<eos> - Don't make me ask you again.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'm turning it down.<eos> So, this is happening.<eos> It took me 20 minutes to get out of the parking lot because Liv insisted on checking my oil.<eos> Here it's been all selfies and sour gummies, and Demi Lovato.<eos> How did you make out at the bank?<eos> Oh, we came up empty.<eos> But this guy right here.
We all get these.<eos> Bunch of brains mashed together.<eos> No visions. No crazy mood swings.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I cannot stop taking selfies, and then I stare at them and I just, I criticize myself.<eos> I mean look at this.<eos> I look like ass in every picture.<eos> Gross, right?<eos> We have to take this to the authorities.<eos> What?
But...<eos> I don't even have a driver's license.<eos> What exactly were in those texts, Winslow?<eos> Your friend was dead just hours after she sent them.<eos> - Surely... - Oh, my God! Badger much?<eos> She just found out her best friend was murdered.<eos> Major Nathaniel Lilywhite!<eos> Don't even.<eos> We have to take this to the authorities.<eos> What?
I know.<eos> We done here?<eos> Sure.<eos> So, that letter...<eos> - What?<eos> - The letter.<eos> When did you get it?<eos> Twenty-two months ago.<eos> You ever think how differently things might've turned out if you'd have been around when her ex got out?<eos> Once or twice.
I have to see her. I have to.<eos> We didn't get to say goodbye.<eos> Klaus!<eos> Krystina.<eos> Did the frommer boy chicken out?<eos> No, I shot him.<eos> Is she alright?<eos> She is at the hotel renier.<eos> She was escorted.<eos> By an ss officer.
This is what a double-agent relationship looks like.<eos> It is in your interest.<eos> That I maintain credibility with my superiors?<eos> Correct. My agent in canada.<eos> Has not reported in since the failed operation. But if he has been captured.<eos> And is in your custody, it would reflect poorly on me.<eos> I know you would never release him.<eos> That's right.<eos> I need him terminated.<eos> An honorable death.
We have taken strides toward victory.<eos> We have also known loss.<eos> We... Must grieve.<eos> So, For the sake of all the souls watching us right now, Watching.<eos> And love, and do what is right. Because the future...<eos> I have something to say.<eos> I want to make a toast. To my husband.<eos> Franz, I never thought you'd become the man you are today.<eos> I hope we can all find a way to live by your words.<eos> To the future!
Where are you taking him?<eos> Sergeant breeland wants him.<eos> Wants him where?<eos> I said, "wants him where?"<eos> She never said anything about a transfer.<eos> Run!<eos> Hey! Stop right there!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Hey! Get back in the room!<eos> Rigaud?
How much did Nathalie insure these paintings for?<eos> Their book value... $4 million.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Not... Not being funny, but $4 million for paintings like this?<eos> Didn't realize you were a critic, Maxine.<eos> Well, you can share both your opinions with the art-gallery director.<eos> Oh, that'll be room service.<eos> My latte.<eos> Better make it quick.<eos> Oh, nice place.
Come on, Nathalie.<eos> I know my wife.<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> - Not yet you're not.<eos> Your people already briefed us.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I pushed to insure these paintings... over my supervisor's objections.<eos> Now you're being held responsible?<eos> Personally.<eos> For a $4-million policy.
Looking for something?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Eric Beaumont, Arnaud Castel.<eos> It's Arnold, please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Arnold's the one who valued the collection at $4 million.<eos> Ah, you do value appraisals.<eos> Ah. Authenticity determination, as well.<eos> 11:59.<eos> One minute early.
Fine.<eos> I'm going.<eos> You know how much I love you.<eos> See?<eos> Got what you wanted again.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Castel.<eos> Really appreciate your help.<eos> Of course.<eos> And well done.<eos> All of you.
He's too scared.<eos> Okay, then this is over.<eos> - No, wait. Wait. Wait.<eos> - Ohh!<eos> Oh!<eos> I know someone who can talk him into anything.<eos> Well, then, call him.<eos> You know, I think...<eos> I think the value of my role has been underrepresented.<eos> What?
How's 25%?<eos> Okay. 25% it is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Arnold Castel.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Take the call.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> Just talk to him.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What?
No crowds.<eos> Do you ever...<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, it's...<eos> Sometimes, I feel like I have long hair.<eos> Like, from when we... when I was you.<eos> And it's not like I just remember having it.<eos> I reach for it to, like, brush it out of my face, and it's just... it's not there.<eos> Does that... does that ever...<eos> What else?
And it's not like I just remember having it.<eos> I reach for it to, like, brush it out of my face, and it's just... it's not there.<eos> Does that... does that ever...<eos> What else?<eos> Sometimes, my balance is off.<eos> Like, my center of gravity and my hips...<eos> - Watch it.<eos> - No.<eos> And...<eos> What?
I know how everything works down there, I just... I...<eos> - No. Go on.<eos> - No, I...<eos> I didn't touch anything or look.<eos> Any more than I had to.<eos> I just... look, just to be completely...<eos> I did... when we switched, I did...<eos> Well, that's okay.<eos> I, uh...<eos> What?
David, sit down. Please, sit.<eos> Honestly, I've never seen a mind like yours before.<eos> It's as if your brain is defending itself.<eos> Certain memories, certain parts of your story have been walled off or erased.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means I can't do what I need to do to orient you, to train you.<eos> And frankly, I'm concerned that I'm just making things worse.<eos> You're giving up.<eos> No. You're too important.<eos> Why?
Do you love me?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Then there's nothing else to say.<eos> Everybody in here keeps saying that I'm sane.<eos> What if they're wrong?<eos> Okay, David.<eos> Show us how you ended up in Clockworks.<eos> You ready?<eos> Just a pinprick.<eos> Into the left!
You know I do.<eos> Then there's nothing else to say.<eos> Everybody in here keeps saying that I'm sane.<eos> What if they're wrong?<eos> Okay, David.<eos> Show us how you ended up in Clockworks.<eos> You ready?<eos> Just a pinprick.<eos> Into the left!<eos> To the right!
So now you've learned to tell three lies at once?<eos> You see that I had no choice, don't you?<eos> So now what?<eos> You do what they want?<eos> I do what I need to in order to protect you. And to protect myself.<eos> I've come to a decision.<eos> I... We need to lay low.<eos> We need to behave.<eos> Behave?<eos> For a while, not much longer.
I do what I need to in order to protect you. And to protect myself.<eos> I've come to a decision.<eos> I... We need to lay low.<eos> We need to behave.<eos> Behave?<eos> For a while, not much longer.<eos> And when the time is right, we'll get out.<eos> We leave all this behind, and we go to spain.<eos> So, we behave. One more night?<eos> A week?

I'll escort you back to your laboratory,<eos> And your "ordeal" is over.<eos> Thank you. I have the reichssicherheitsdienst outside if you'd care to come with me.<eos> Thank you, franz.<eos> I'll see you both shortly.<eos> Come on!<eos> Your car is early!<eos> Even your leader tried to spare himself this.<eos> You might follow his example.<eos> Not by suicide.
You do what it takes.<eos> There are two ways.<eos> One is violent and merciless, The other is strategic.<eos> Go on.<eos> Our bosses, They made a deal.<eos> We can make a deal.<eos> Ullie!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
Go on, just get on with it.<eos> Salute, march, do as you're told.<eos> I mistook you for a spy, not a soldier.<eos> If I allow you.<eos> To escape, I will be blamed.<eos> What would faber do? He would do what he needed to do,<eos> And then he would protect himself. There are ways you can shift the blame. And then take the credit when intelligence.<eos> There...<eos> I have one condition.<eos> Condition?
Murphy's actually right.<eos> Don't worry, they might ditch him, but I'm too awesome to leave behind.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Congratulations, Emori.<eos> You get to live in a hole in the ground for 5 years.<eos> Thanks for playing.<eos> Come on. At least we get to live.<eos> Said the cockroach to the raven.<eos> Systems check complete.<eos> What?
Now there's hope.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Jasper...<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> Give him a minute.<eos> They'll figure it out when we take the still.<eos> We don't need it.<eos> There's one in the bunker.<eos> My little boy's all grown up.<eos> So what?
Why waste it in fighting?<eos> You're not packed.<eos> I tried.<eos> Talk to me, Harper.<eos> Just tired of fighting, Monty.<eos> I know.<eos> We all are.<eos> But in that bunker, we'll be safe.<eos> Every time we think that, something bad happens.<eos> So what then?
You sent them down to die.<eos> The difference now is that they have a choice.<eos> And so do you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is what they want.<eos> They're wasted.<eos> They don't know what they want.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Get ready to move out.<eos> - Yes, sir. - What?
Get ready to move out.<eos> - Yes, sir. - What?<eos> No. You can't.<eos> I'm sorry, son.<eos> Bellamy is right.<eos> We can't save them if they don't want to be saved.<eos> If Octavia was in there, would you let her stay?<eos> If Octavia was in there... At least I'd get to say good-bye.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> Skairipa.
And whoever wins gets the bunker.<eos> Will you fight, or will you burn?<eos> Remember, it's not black rain, but it can turn at any moment, so keep the person with your assigned chem tent in sight at all times.<eos> "No one but us saves ourselves.<eos> We ourselves must walk the path."<eos> Not too late to change your mind.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You can still stay, you know?<eos> I'm not a quitter.<eos> Thanks for understanding.
It won't always be like this, Clarke.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Bellamy will go free as soon as the death wave passes, ok?<eos> Ok.<eos> Good.<eos> In the meantime, Bellamy has a lot of friends in the guard.<eos> We need to put someone on his door that wants to survive more than be liked.<eos> I think I know someone like that.<eos> They're just gonna keep him locked up for 5 years?<eos> Of course not.
I just saved your lives.<eos> I'm hoping you will return the favor.<eos> Unless we can get another ride, no one's making it to that island.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> - David...<eos> - I know.<eos> Nate's already put his name in, but I'd like to give him my slot, too, if that's ok.<eos> I want to give him the best chance.<eos> Of course.<eos> One minute.
Roan banished me.<eos> I heard.<eos> Monty...<eos> I was only trying to save my people.<eos> Monty, do you copy?<eos> Is that so wrong?<eos> Bellamy, come in. Do you read me?<eos> Yes, Monty. I read you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Two clicks outside Polis.
Is that it?<eos> Yes...<eos> And then we threaten to destroy the crops unless they make room for our people.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Once we have the food, we have the power.<eos> We call the shots.<eos> We found the Skaikru armory.<eos> They are our guns now.<eos> We can't wait any longer.<eos> Your orders?
It's simple.<eos> There's no power in the ring.<eos> Two minutes ago, I thought it wasn't a problem because I could activate it remotely.<eos> Over the rocket's comm system.<eos> So we turn the power on from the inside.<eos> We can't get inside. That's the point.<eos> Without power, we can't even open the hangar door.<eos> Raven, think.<eos> You've solved bigger problems than this before.<eos> Oh, yeah, not in 53 minutes.
I got it, I got it, I got it.<eos> - Give me your hand. - Right. Here, here, here.<eos> Look. We're gonna go on 3, ok?<eos> - 1...<eos> - God!<eos> Ok. 49 minutes.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, no, not with your hands, ok?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> It's too heavy to carry all the way by yourself.<eos> On 3.
Remember, we'll have an hour each.<eos> Don't turn them on till I tell you, and after that, breathe easy.<eos> Where the hell's Echo?<eos> Great. I'll find her.<eos> You get everybody strapped in.<eos> Echo?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
Excuse us. Thank you.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - Nothing good.<eos> Whoever ran this place had it wiped down before they ran.<eos> Between that and the fire, they wasn't much left.<eos> We found shavings from some kind of titanium alloy, and this.<eos> It's definitely an integrated circuit timing chip, but I haven't seen one quite like this before.<eos> Timing chip, that's used in--<eos> Everything from traffic lights to railway switches--<eos> To bombs.
Oh, boy.<eos> Isn't this a sticky wicket?<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> As I mentioned, Senator Diaz made a campaign promise that I intend to hold him to.<eos> You what, uh, bribe them?<eos> I've been known to make the occasional charitable contribution.<eos> In exchange, my back is scratched by the good men in blue.<eos> Yours, not so much.<eos> You blew a .12.<eos> - I what?
We're monitoring for reports or complaints.<eos> Oh, oh, I got one. I got one.<eos> Reports of someone flying a drone from the roof of the Mazelon Hostel.<eos> - All right, the address--<eos> - I got it.<eos> Call in security!<eos> Aram.<eos> I gather we have a picture of Farook.<eos> I might have him leaving the hostel on 92nd.<eos> On the ground! On the ground!
You put our country at risk to get me back.<eos> I don't know whether to hit you or hug you.<eos> Well, you know what Ezra said about Alma--<eos> I broke off our engagement.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> Be happy.<eos> You obstructed our investigation, put lives at risk, lied to us.<eos> - Yes, to protect my country.<eos> - Your country?
So he thinks that we're coming to save his kid, not take his organs.<eos> I thought that, once you had examined the boy, it'd be better coming from you.<eos> I'm just glad you're here.<eos> I mean, Dr. Corridan said that there's nothing he could do.<eos> Then he said there was another doctor who was coming in from Seattle.<eos> I was like... I mean, it's great, right?<eos> Th-There's hope.<eos> So, okay. What's the plan?<eos> I mean, you... you... you want to do some tests?<eos> Surgery?
- You're pissed.<eos> Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, I am.<eos> We lost the donor, Caroline's repeat scans show more extensive esophageal invasion, her parents are a wreck, and... and you're... you're here getting drunk?<eos> Jackson.<eos> I got off work, and I had a beer, April.<eos> Four beers, actually, and, uh, some whiskey on top of that.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Nothing. Nothing wrong with me.<eos> We have a patient who's counting on us.<eos> No, not us.
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, I am.<eos> We lost the donor, Caroline's repeat scans show more extensive esophageal invasion, her parents are a wreck, and... and you're... you're here getting drunk?<eos> Jackson.<eos> I got off work, and I had a beer, April.<eos> Four beers, actually, and, uh, some whiskey on top of that.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Nothing. Nothing wrong with me.<eos> We have a patient who's counting on us.<eos> No, not us.<eos> Me.
You just...<eos> Yes, I lied, but they can't move her, and I just needed a little more time.<eos> What is the matter with you?<eos> Why are you torturing this poor girl?<eos> You just made a promise that you know you can't keep, that you know we can't deliver.<eos> We can find a way to deliver.<eos> Where?<eos> Where... Wh-Where are we gonna find it?<eos> At the diner?<eos> What?
- Night-night, baby.<eos> - Sleep well.<eos> Be good for Grandma, okay? Love you.<eos> Love you, nugget.<eos> Mwah!<eos> Why didn't you just tell me?<eos> All right.<eos> Forget it.<eos> "You good?"<eos> What?
I'm gonna go sleep.<eos> Like the dead.<eos> Unless you think we should go check back in on the patient.<eos> No, no, I think you're right.<eos> I think we should rest.<eos> All right, we should... go do that, then.<eos> Sure. No, great.<eos> That's a good call.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?
Jackson said I could get a ride home?<eos> - Oh, of course, of course.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Come here, little baby.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, please, that's what grandmas are for.<eos> No.<eos> I mean...<eos> What?
Good girl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, please, that's what grandmas are for.<eos> No.<eos> I mean...<eos> What?<eos> - What, baby?<eos> - Just...<eos> Thank you, Mom.<eos> For everything.
Hey, you're okay.<eos> I know you're afraid. It's okay.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your sister, and I'm gonna explain everything, okay?<eos> I just need you to relax.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> I'm taking you somewhere safe.<eos> Okay? Somewhere where we can talk.<eos> You shot me.<eos> What?
You're still in contact with Roman?<eos> While you were raiding the compound,<eos> Shepherd had me tied up in front of a projector.<eos> She wanted me to watch you die.<eos> And then she wanted Roman to kill me, but he couldn't.<eos> He chose you over her.<eos> So she turned on him.<eos> But we fought our way out, and then...<eos> But then I...<eos> Then what?
Are you a pirate?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Is that your treasure?<eos> It's shiny.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Yep, I'm a pirate, too.<eos> Sorry, is my daughter bothering you?<eos> Can I get you anything else?<eos> Some dessert?
I want answers.<eos> And I'm gonna get 'em.<eos> Even if I have to do this a thousand times.<eos> I'm gonna show you a series of photos.<eos> I need you to tell me if you recognize any of the individuals.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you ever seen this woman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What about this woman?
You failed.<eos> Instead, you led a dozen agents to their death.<eos> That is not her fault.<eos> Whose fault is it?<eos> I am just as responsible for yesterday as she is.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just consider yourself lucky you didn't lead that raid.<eos> You need to leave the building now.<eos> Understood.<eos> Nas.

You know what?<eos> I think we should take her to Gitmo.<eos> Let them take care of her. I'm telling you I don't know the plates.<eos> Every month I get these unmarked packages.<eos> I just put 'em in the cars.<eos> The drivers pick their plates.<eos> Does the car have any distinctive markings?<eos> It was a regular car.<eos> Swapped parts?<eos> Anything?
Nicollette Brown.<eos> Kevyn Sierra.<eos> Maria Vanlenz.<eos> The list goes on... and on.<eos> Innocent men and women.<eos> It's not about what you remember. It's about what you did.<eos> These deaths that's who you are.<eos> You're gonna go with these agents. And you're gonna answer all their questions.<eos> Where will they take me?<eos> Somewhere... safe.
Patterson's back at the FBI.<eos> We need to alter our attack plan.<eos> Just in case Roman remembers anything.<eos> And what about Weller?<eos> That stays.<eos> He's still crucial to the end game.<eos> When were you gonna tell me about this?<eos> I'm telling you now.<eos> Here, Nas had an inside source at Sandstorm.<eos> What?
- Are those the same thing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> People we look up to, people we aspire to be, who teach us how to be greater than we are because they're greater than we are.<eos> - Ugh. Did you find it?<eos> - I'm looking.<eos> They're great if we don't look too closely.<eos> Well, I can't get any information about his case without that number.<eos> Alex sent me an e-mail one time with an arraignment number on it or something...<eos> - Try the "search" box. - I'm searching.<eos> Oh, maybe this.
Have you heard from Alex?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> We tried, but we can't figure out where they put him.<eos> Go away!<eos> It's Murphy.<eos> I-I need Dr. Robbins.<eos> There's a laboring mom on her way.<eos> Um, tell me if you hear anything, okay?<eos> Uh, what?
Go away!<eos> It's Murphy.<eos> I-I need Dr. Robbins.<eos> There's a laboring mom on her way.<eos> Um, tell me if you hear anything, okay?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Oh, you guys haven't heard about Karev?<eos> Hey, um, Wilson.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> What?
No, no, we're past that, okay?<eos> - I did some recon.<eos> - And?<eos> I think Minnick's plan is to go into the O.R.s and turn each attending one by one.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We never let her in the O.R.<eos> We isolate the enemy, cut off her supply lines, starve her out.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Genius.<eos> What?
Okay.<eos> Mindy, it's Dr. Robbins.<eos> Has your water broken?<eos> Yeah, I trashed this poor guy's car.<eos> - Hey, it's fine.<eos> I am gonna divorce my husband.<eos> No, I'm gonna kill that son of a...<eos> Big inhale.<eos> That jerk is out shopping right now.<eos> Shopping!
Do you want to... talk about it?<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not something you want to hear about.<eos> Okay.<eos> I miss Alex.<eos> And I know that that's not fair to say to you, but it's true.<eos> I hate that he's gone.<eos> I just...<eos> I hate it. But sometimes, every once in a while...<eos> What?
- Well, I don't know.<eos> - We just said I don't... No idea.<eos> Hey, what happened last night?<eos> Do we have all the attendings with us?<eos> Uh, well, Hunt... I'm not sure where he stands yet.<eos> Well, what about Riggs?<eos> Uh, Riggs, we can ask after he's done talking to your mom.<eos> Whenever he's done doing what?<eos> - Talking to your mother.<eos> - My what?
30... something.<eos> - Okay. Go home.<eos> - No, no, no, no!<eos> I'm okay. And I'm not gonna risk you making a mistake 'cause of exhaustion.<eos> No, you're not. Okay.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Is that razor wire?<eos> I'm staying.<eos> Home, Wilson.<eos> Okay, gently on "three," guys.
Can you tell me anything about her medical history?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> She was very private.<eos> I-I mean, like, really, really private.<eos> Annie and her husband never said hi, never waved.<eos> Right after they moved onto our road, they started to build the wall around their place.<eos> Not a fence... a wall, like a fortress.<eos> - They seemed a little...<eos> - Private.<eos> Nutballs?
There she was, tangled in all of that razor wire.<eos> Well, one thing's for sure... she'd be dead right now if it weren't for you finding her.<eos> There's evidence of early ulceration. She's been down a long time.<eos> The blood flow's been compromised. Page cardio...<eos> We need a vascular consult 'cause she's in danger of losing this leg.<eos> Right away, Doctor.<eos> Okay, push 5 of haldol.<eos> Uh the rumor mill is ch...<eos> The rumor mill is churning.<eos> What?
Yeah, but we're residents.<eos> It doesn't really concern us.<eos> It only concerns us.<eos> This is our education.<eos> We worked hard to get here, and they're obstructing it.<eos> Look, Kepner, Avery, and Robbins are all with Grey.<eos> Karev probably will be, too.<eos> Karev?<eos> Karev's in prison.<eos> What?
You just ligated a branch that we might need for the anastomosis.<eos> And now the esophagus is ready to be excised, which was quicker.<eos> V-fib!<eos> She's in cardiac arrest!<eos> Ready? Grab the paddles!<eos> 1, 2, 3.<eos> Paddles!<eos> Charge to 120.<eos> Clear.<eos> So, what now?
I know.<eos> You don't!<eos> You are the attending!<eos> This is your loss. Okay?<eos> You take the hit.<eos> if you put it on her, she might quit.<eos> She might think that she can't survive it, so you show her that she can.<eos> You tell her, "when this happened to me..."<eos> it hasn't.<eos> What?
Okay, great.<eos> I am not ready.<eos> Put your hand down, intern.<eos> None of you are ready, but you are ready to do as much of it as you can under the extremely close supervision of an attending with the reminder to pass it off if you need to, which means you'll be that much closer to being ready.<eos> The donor will be an O.R. 2 supervised by Dr. Webber.<eos> That'll be you, Warren, with Cross assisting. - Yes!<eos> - Thank you, Dr. Minnick.<eos> No.<eos> Edwards and Wilson, you'll be in O.R. 3 working on the boy with Dr. Karev.<eos> - The boy? - Yes.
You put the snake in the hat.<eos> We did ask that.<eos> I'll tell Grendel.<eos> Grendel has all the patterns.<eos> She sees the patterns.<eos> She sees the patterns, I see the patterns.<eos> - You don't see the diagram... - Okay. - ...because I see the diagrams!<eos> - Okay, okay, ma'am. You don't know the diagrams. You don't know the diagrams!<eos> We're gonna give you something to relax you, all right?<eos> Two I.V. of lorazepam.
She sees the patterns, I see the patterns.<eos> - You don't see the diagram... - Okay. - ...because I see the diagrams!<eos> - Okay, okay, ma'am. You don't know the diagrams. You don't know the diagrams!<eos> We're gonna give you something to relax you, all right?<eos> Two I.V. of lorazepam.<eos> - CBC, chem 1 and a tox screen, and call psych. - Okay.<eos> So, how old is that pacemaker?<eos> That is the Ford Pinto of pacemakers.<eos> Okay, ma'am, we're gonna take that old pacemaker out and give you a brand new, shiny one. How's that sound?<eos> Ahh... For the snakes?
Is she just gonna go back to the street?<eos> Nope.<eos> 'Cause I just found out who she is.<eos> Call the company, get them to trace the serial number. That will tell us who you are, Ms. Doe.<eos> Warren and Cross did fine work with the renal vein graft.<eos> It should be an easy anastomosis.<eos> Got it, sir.<eos> All right. Well, what's next?<eos> - Irrigating here...<eos> - Good hemostasis...
- So, no rule book.<eos> - Where's Bailey?<eos> She left.<eos> She said she was going to Camp David.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> She said she had a summit meeting.<eos> She said I'm in charge.<eos> Invite me inside for coffee.<eos> For coffee?
Well, you may have a hard time understanding her.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Well, her speech is... very disorganized.<eos> She's possibly delusional.<eos> She's alive?<eos> Claire's alive?<eos> Are you telling my daughter's alive?<eos> Did I say he's 16?<eos> I know it doesn't change anything, but he's 16, and he is open on a table.<eos> Anything?
I know!<eos> Dr. Webber, prep the mother for dialysis. I will call UNOS myself.<eos> Karev, start the anastomosis on the boy.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop.<eos> We might have another option, but...<eos> But?<eos> - Wilson.<eos> - Jo, what is it?<eos> The husband.
I am.<eos> And as your chief... I am ready to lift the suspension if you feel you can come back.<eos> I want to.<eos> Good.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Not until he does.<eos> Okay, there's a difference between loyalty and stubbornness, Grey.<eos> I do not want to be reinstated unless Richard Webber is as Residency Director.<eos> Minnick goes.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.
Y-You can... You can sit.<eos> Y-You can sit, but y-you can't tell I can tell.<eos> Uh, they crisscross, the...<eos> The snakes are in the cart.<eos> They told me...<eos> I still have a kidney?<eos> And Chris... He also h... has a kidney?<eos> Yes.<eos> Chris received a different kidney.<eos> A perfect, healthy living-donor kidney.
Night.<eos> Hey, Wilson.<eos> How you doing?<eos> You okay?<eos> Do you need me to do anything, or...?<eos> I don't do reunions, but I can see why people do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They can make you feel like you haven't felt in a long time.<eos> It's comfy, it's familiar, it's kind of like coming home.<eos> What?
Just one little clip.<eos> You'll be in and out.<eos> And I'll make sure that Owen doesn't see you.<eos> Promise.<eos> Give me 10 minutes.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Good to have you back. - Morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, when I was Chief...<eos> Interim Chief.
No abdominal reconstruction needed.<eos> Good. I was hoping to avoid having to call Jackson in.<eos> Things still difficult at home?<eos> I'm not sure I can stay there anymore.<eos> I mean, I want to.<eos> It's been so easy with Harriet, but...<eos> But everything's so much harder than it needs to be right now.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Yeah. - And...<eos> - And what?
- Hi!<eos> - Hi yourself.<eos> How big is your stove?<eos> I don't... I don't know how to answer that.<eos> I want to make pierogi for you, but my stove sucks.<eos> Ooh, that sounds nice.<eos> Uh, what is it?<eos> Something I do very well.<eos> Okay. I don't have to stay or anything.<eos> Just... pierogi.
We should take him to the ICU, start fresh tomorrow.<eos> - Agreed?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Those sutures should control the bleeding, but he's got a big openskull fracture up here.<eos> - FAST exam negative.<eos> - Pupils are sluggish.<eos> I didn't realize you were back.<eos> There's no other obvious injuries. I'm gonna need to see those trauma films.<eos> I just stopped by for, uh, some stuff.<eos> - Stuff?
No problem.<eos> Thanks, Pierce.<eos> So, you've been here since morning?<eos> Look at that.<eos> The scans are up and...<eos> Hey. First day back and pulling an all-nighter.<eos> Ambitious.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are you being a jerk?<eos> What?
Who is "we"?<eos> Jim.<eos> I meant you guys, obviously.<eos> Can they see him?<eos> That's not really a good idea, Jim. He's not out of the woods yet.<eos> I'd really like him to rest so we can go back in tomorrow.<eos> Right now you guys should just get some food, get some rest yourselves.<eos> No. We aren't going anywhere.<eos> Tell you what... you guys stay here, and I'll bring us in some food.<eos> Food?
'Cause you were sleeping and because I'm tired.<eos> I'm so, so tired.<eos> I'm wiped. Ugh.<eos> Residents are a bottomless pit of questions.<eos> And it's cute, but it's also unbelievably draining.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, why don't we rest a minute, like just for... just for a minute?<eos> - Just a minute. - Okay. - Then rally.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> One minute.
Well, I-if he wasn't on the list...<eos> Karev, this is a good thing, okay?<eos> All we've got to do now is have an awkward conversation with the parents, and then we save a kid's life.<eos> You're unbelievable. You know that?<eos> I can talk to the family with you.<eos> Do you want to be married to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why won't you talk to me?<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> For what?
Karev, this is a good thing, okay?<eos> All we've got to do now is have an awkward conversation with the parents, and then we save a kid's life.<eos> You're unbelievable. You know that?<eos> I can talk to the family with you.<eos> Do you want to be married to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why won't you talk to me?<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> For what?<eos> The fight.
Or no one wins.<eos> I'll talk to the family.<eos> Hold on.<eos> This is why you called me all the way in here at this hour?<eos> He went behind my back. He lied to me.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> We ready? Hold on.<eos> Look, I don't trust him.<eos> I don't want him in the O.R. with me.<eos> Uh, what?
That's what's on her mind... her boob job, her boobs, which are perfectly fine, by the way.<eos> You know what? When she gets in the car, you look at them, and you tell me that they're not perfect.<eos> I'm not gonna check out your mom's boobs.<eos> It's called the Second Law of Thermodynamics.<eos> It's also called life.<eos> Oh, it's good to see you, Meredith. Hi.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> And, um, Alex, right?<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> What?
Uh, no, it's fine.<eos> He fell, too.<eos> He wouldn't let go of my hand.<eos> No reason to take a chance, sir.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Her syncopal episode lasted at least 60 seconds.<eos> Oh, it sounds like you've been watching a lot of medical shows, sir.<eos> He's not gonna like that.<eos> I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon.<eos> 1, 2, 3.
No, I'm... I'm not...<eos> It's her body. It's her boobs.<eos> She doesn't have to justify her decision to anyone.<eos> I mean, don't come at her demanding anything.<eos> Just... give her some support.<eos> I want to know what you did to Richard Webber. Nothing.<eos> Ooh, it was bad. Really bad?<eos> Okay, shh!<eos> I kissed Eliza Minnick, and he caught me.<eos> Mnh-mnh, what?
- You told me...<eos> - Okay, why do you even want a baby?<eos> Have you asked yourself that?<eos> - What? Why do I want a baby?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> What do you need that you don't have that you think a baby is going to bring you?<eos> - I want a family.<eos> - You have one!<eos> You and me... That makes one.<eos> What else?
You don't know.<eos> You want a dream, Owen.<eos> And when you have a child... you might not get to have what you asked for.<eos> You get what you are given.<eos> And it might be wonderful.<eos> And it might be painful, and it might be both.<eos> I know you're scared, but...<eos> Amelia, I think you'd be an amazing mom.<eos> I was already an amazing mom, Owen.<eos> For better and for worse.
Not if you don't want to.<eos> I was born in a two-room shack with an outhouse, six brothers, not a lot of food or love or... anything.<eos> Getting out of there was...<eos> When that social worker put this little baby in my arms, when I looked down at my Maggie...<eos> Maggie is the universe giving me a gift.<eos> She is... a happy person.<eos> She's cheerful.<eos> Maggie is rare.<eos> She's special.<eos> This...
I just got started.<eos> My mom has been sick for months without me knowing... months.<eos> I feel like I left the house with the oven on and went about my business and came back to find the whole house engulfed in flames.<eos> And no one will let me in.<eos> - No matter what I do, I can't get inside.<eos> I can't save anything.<eos> I could've stopped it if I had known.<eos> S-So, I can't give up. I can't give up, not now.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> What?
Come here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She's gonna go... and I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> You're never ready.<eos> You just do it.<eos> Listen to her.<eos> Talk about whatever she wants to talk about and record her voice in your mind and memorize everything.<eos> And just keep sitting there.<eos> - Orgasms.
I have to impart wisdom.<eos> This wisdom, right now?<eos> You have got time.<eos> You don't have to go there right now.<eos> I've had orgasms.<eos> Oh, well, good.<eos> They're not a gift. It's your right.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<eos> - And this is important. - Mm-hmm.<eos> At least once a day.
Tell Meredith not to...<eos> Not to cave?<eos> Not to care?<eos> Not to give up so easily?<eos> Not to fall in love?<eos> Not to have children?<eos> Not to tell a lie?<eos> She left me wondering what to do, what not to do.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What?
Oh, my God!<eos> I'm a lawyer!<eos> I'm a lawyer. Oh, my God.<eos> ♪ Nostalgia sweet... ♪ I'm resigning.<eos> To go where?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I'm retiring.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> When?<eos> Two weeks.
You're saying if we contact the owner of that car, they'll have a video of this encounter?<eos> It's on its hard drive.<eos> They can't erase it.<eos> Good work.<eos> Zoe, ask the investigator to come up here.<eos> Good job!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I like these daisies much better than the lilies.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> What?
Go see your mom.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oh, Dad.<eos> Sweetheart, listen to me.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you. I didn't do it, Maia.<eos> I know, I know!<eos> Glenn, what's going on?<eos> No, what?
It's all gone?<eos> The Rindells have 13.8 million on hand, and that's from an initial investment of eight billion.<eos> They never invested a cent?<eos> Not after 2008. The housing bubble.<eos> There was a shortfall, and they made it up with money from new investors.<eos> But I steered people to them.<eos> The Women's Fund, all their money.<eos> I even told Emily's List to put their 401k there.<eos> I know there's a lot for you to process, Diane, but we need to think about a few things and act fast.<eos> The escrow?
I even told Emily's List to put their 401k there.<eos> I know there's a lot for you to process, Diane, but we need to think about a few things and act fast.<eos> The escrow?<eos> Yes.<eos> There will be a penalty, but we must get out of it now.<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> And you need to delay your retirement.<eos> The government might freeze your account and put you on a living-wage budget.<eos> What?
Well, they can claw back past earnings and distribute them among all the victims.<eos> That's what they did with Madoff.<eos> But my personal account, that is my money, isn't it?<eos> No, not necessarily.<eos> They'll allow you to keep a subsistence-level amount of cash, but they might freeze the rest.<eos> So am I broke?<eos> Well, I don't like to talk that way, but you can't live the way you've been living for more than a few months. You'll need to keep your job.<eos> Or maybe sublet this apartment.<eos> Is there a reason you and your husband are delaying your divorce?<eos> What?
Uh, when the Feds call you in for an interview... and they will... call me.<eos> Here's my card.<eos> Actually, it's my firm's card.<eos> I just scratched out my boss' name. That's mine right there.<eos> Doesn't really instill confidence.<eos> I'll have cards made up for next time.<eos> So, um, I was thinking about what you said at the party.<eos> That you would have partners thrown out the door to make room for me.<eos> Now, you're looking for an emeritus position?<eos> Uh, no, a partnership.
Yes, I signed my exit agreement, and they they won't...<eos> My God... this is my life.<eos> It's gone.<eos> I'm losing my apartment.<eos> I'm unemployable.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> How is my life suddenly so fucking meaningless? !<eos> It isn't.<eos> How can you work so hard every single day of your life and have nothing to show for it?<eos> Not a friend!
Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting. No, no, we didn't.<eos> Uh, we're not.<eos> I'm here to chat.<eos> How are you doing, Diane?<eos> Come on, sympathy doesn't suit you, Adrian.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You.
Thanks.<eos> Well... that went in a different direction than I thought.<eos> She can't be a name partner.<eos> I didn't offer her that.<eos> Junior partner is fine.<eos> With an equal equity draw.<eos> Don't you ever call an audible again.<eos> You got it.<eos> Oh, my God, they're saying they have a sex tape of us.<eos> "TMZ, Exclusive footage:
Adrian, it's Diane.<eos> In a few hours you're gonna get a call from this firm offering you a good deal on the Kendall brutality case.<eos> Yes, I don't disagree.<eos> I, um, I just want you to know, there's an associate here who found the key piece of evidence that the case turned on, and she was just fired.<eos> You left this.<eos> Give it to someone who needs it. I'm done.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where?<eos> Someplace.
- Speak up.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I want to...<eos> - Maia.<eos> That is your third apology in 30 seconds.<eos> Forget apologizing.<eos> Jump in. Don't hesitate.<eos> Look, choose a partner...<eos> Diane, Thomas... and you follow them around all day.<eos> 24 hours.
Will you talk to Boseman?<eos> No.<eos> You talk to him, and then, I'll follow up.<eos> My new client?<eos> Hi. Are you here for Diane?<eos> I'm Diane's assistant, but I also sometimes work as an investigator.<eos> Would you like to come back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> A garbage bag.
Why, didn't you give your name?<eos> Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case. That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?<eos> Bitcoin.<eos> I thought it was all a bit too "disruptive economy" for you.<eos> Well, maybe for Lockhart/Gardner, but here, you'll fit right in.<eos> So, what's the case you want to argue?<eos> I'm being set up.<eos> For what?
Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case. That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?<eos> Bitcoin.<eos> I thought it was all a bit too "disruptive economy" for you.<eos> Well, maybe for Lockhart/Gardner, but here, you'll fit right in.<eos> So, what's the case you want to argue?<eos> I'm being set up.<eos> For what?<eos> Cyber terrorism.
Yeah, I've been looking for that.<eos> You keep it.<eos> - So what do you need?<eos> - Well... hypothetically speaking, if we had a client who had knowledge of a crime being committed... tonight, let's say, and he wanted to help you prevent that crime, might there be a deal to immunize him?<eos> Well, that would depend.<eos> Is he responsible for the crime?<eos> No.<eos> - Okay, what is the crime?<eos> - An attack on the power grid.<eos> Cyber terrorism.
Not after the backlash over the ten years.<eos> We still have options, don't lose hope.<eos> Give me a minute, please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You told me to call if it ever got to that point.<eos> I think it just got to that point.<eos> So who's this hacker?<eos> Lawyer's been asked by the client not to say.<eos> And who's this lawyer?<eos> Why?
Okay. Tell her I'll get back to her.<eos> "Her"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just a guess.<eos> Doing great, guys. Doing great.<eos> Diane. Do you have a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> Am I in danger here?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - My review.
An attorney came to me asking for anonymity.<eos> - You mean, your girlfriend?<eos> - Sir, this is serious.<eos> It makes my position here untenable.<eos> You didn't tell me anything, Colin. I guessed.<eos> I guessed that you were hiding your girlfriend.<eos> - You tell her that.<eos> - I'm resigning.<eos> No, you're being promoted.<eos> To Deputy.
Why are you here, sir?<eos> Because this is about cyber terrorism.<eos> No, this is about the Sixth Amendment.<eos> God...<eos> They seized our attorney and are holding her until she names our client.<eos> That is the definition of governmental over... Okay, okay.<eos> On the record. What relief are you seeking, Counselor?<eos> A temporary restraining order forcing the Department of Justice to release Lucca Quinn.<eos> And I'm granting such an order.<eos> What?

What relief are you seeking, Counselor?<eos> A temporary restraining order forcing the Department of Justice to release Lucca Quinn.<eos> And I'm granting such an order.<eos> What?<eos> Diane!<eos> When the fuck did that happen? What happened?<eos> We won the restraining order, so now they're prosecuting Lucca.<eos> - For what?
Why not in the real one?<eos> But again, this is not my hack.<eos> Yes, I encouraged someone, but legally, I did nothing.<eos> Who have you encouraged?<eos> Do you know his name? - No.<eos> I know his handle.<eos> - Listen... we need your help, Mr. Staples. Diane.<eos> There's nothing I'd rather do than help you, after all we've been through, but I-I have legal troubles of my own.<eos> They occupy my days, they interrupt my nights.<eos> What legal troubles?
We ask for immediate relief.<eos> I wish it were, Your Honor.<eos> But Lucca Quinn is a co-conspirator, and we ask that we be allowed to present testimony to support this contention.<eos> How long is it gonna take?<eos> The witness is right here now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You had a meeting with Lucca Quinn, did you not, Mr. AUSA?<eos> I did.<eos> And what did she give you?<eos> A flash drive.
- No.<eos> We're your lawyers.<eos> We didn't know who would show up.<eos> Sir, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> - You're representing me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I would suggest you remain silent.<eos> There it is.<eos> Right on time.
Thank you, Maia.<eos> For what?<eos> Not judging us, not judging me.<eos> Do you love Dad?<eos> We had troubles and, um... we never wanted to bother you with them, but, um... Yes, I love your dad.<eos> This will be a hard time.<eos> The trial?<eos> No.<eos> Your father's agreed to a 35-year plea.<eos> What?
You never could.<eos> I love you.<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's go.<eos> So you're a hero.<eos> I saw it.<eos> The video.<eos> Okay. It's... let's not.<eos> What?
Well, I do my best.<eos> - Where's Amy?<eos> - She's on her way home.<eos> We'll have to eat cold mac and cheese.<eos> - I love cold mac and cheese.<eos> You still worried about your job?<eos> I'm always worried.<eos> It was crazy coming here, like a street party.<eos> Yeah. I kind of liked it, though.<eos> To a weird three months.
It was crazy coming here, like a street party.<eos> Yeah. I kind of liked it, though.<eos> To a weird three months.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is what I think. - Want to hear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think for every weird three months, there are three normal months.<eos> I mean, the world has to live in balance, right?<eos> So, I mean, my guess is the next three months will be boring.<eos> To boring.
This is the worst Cook County jail abuse I have seen in years.<eos> So, we're suing for $12 million, but we do expect settlement before trial.<eos> - Any videotape?<eos> - No.<eos> But we have a very sympathetic family and a grieving widower.<eos> So, all we need of your financing is $300 thousand.<eos> Thanks, though.<eos> Our algorithm is going cool on police suits.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> What else?
Right. Um...<eos> They have accused my client of stealing 400 running shoes from their back-stock.<eos> - 417.<eos> - Objection.<eos> Okay, um,<eos> - and he didn't do it, right? - That is correct, sir.<eos> He did not do it.<eos> What do you need, ma'am?<eos> I'm here as an observer for the union.<eos> Why?
What you will learn over the next four sessions is the Friedman method.<eos> A way to determine guilt... and obtain a confession.<eos> One of these four people is lying.<eos> They all deny taking money from a cash register, but one of them did.<eos> The first step in the Friedman Method is ascertain guilt.<eos> Find out who is lying.<eos> Look, I didn't do it.<eos> I wasn't even there.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Pretty convincing?
How does someone prove their innocence without explaining why they're innocent?<eos> And he says it's all about detecting anxiety.<eos> Well, I don't care how innocent you are, if a cop calls you in for questioning, you're gonna be anxious.<eos> So what does anxiety prove?<eos> What if there is no cop? What if there is no reason to be anxious?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Everybody's different.<eos> Everybody's got their tell.<eos> I don't...<eos> What?
We're going to court.<eos> Fuck the union, we will finance this thing ourselves.<eos> You, I want you in court.<eos> What is your name again?<eos> - Maia.<eos> - Maia. Great.<eos> - Second chair.<eos> - I... well, thank you, sir.<eos> Unfortunately we've run into a snag, Adrian.<eos> - What?
But doesn't your method result in false confessions?<eos> Very few.<eos> In fact, hasn't your method been banned by police in Canada and England?<eos> I wouldn't call it banned.<eos> They've chosen not to use it.<eos> Because it resulted in too many false confessions?<eos> I don't think that's fair.<eos> But is it true, sir?<eos> I'll leave that analysis to others.<eos> Analysis. What...
I put it in my disappear bag.<eos> It's hard not to take that personally, but, um, where is this bag?<eos> It's in... in...<eos> - You forgot?<eos> - No.<eos> That's why I made a song so that it would always help me remember.<eos> ♪ My disappear bag, my disappear bag ♪<eos> ♪ I hid you very safely in the ♪<eos> I don't know.<eos> One second.
That is last year's Phil talking.<eos> In the spirit of living more dangerously, why don't you take an emotional risk and... and try and have an honest conversation with your father?<eos> Also, well, I may not be wearing... Randall's mothers blouse, but I thought maybe you'd like...<eos> And he's gone.<eos> Uh, da... how am I saying it wrong?<eos> - His name is Keith.<eos> - No. Keef?<eos> It couldn't be simpler.<eos> K-E-I-F-T-H.<eos> Keifth.
Runs a company, hell of a role model.<eos> He could never do better than that for a mother.<eos> You know what, Phil and Claire have already raised their kids.<eos> I think it's time for them to travel.<eos> There.<eos> That's where my disappear bag was hanging!<eos> You have, like, a hundred missed calls from Gloria.<eos> You have to come back right now.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> What?
Mitchell, sorry to interrupt.<eos> I didn't know you were with a common worker.<eos> Can it be?<eos> Hmm? Cameron Tucker.<eos> Yes. I'm sorry. You are...?<eos> Keifth.<eos> Keifth. I-I don't believe I know...<eos> No, C-Cam, didn't you tell me you once dated someone named Keifth?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Keifth.
Us.<eos> Aah! This is dangerous!<eos> That's how you know we're alive!<eos> It's like I said in my wedding toast... that bride of yours is fearless.<eos> Funny thing is, we went to an amusement park earlier today and she was too scared to get on this one ride.<eos> Or she pretended to be so that I wouldn't have to admit how scared I was.<eos> I have a hunch that she's not the only one who's trying to protect my feelings today.<eos> You seem to be rambling, son.<eos> When you hugged Claire earlier, she felt a ring box in your pocket.<eos> What?
You're telling me you're doing this for Dad?<eos> Okay, good to know.<eos> Don't... don't tell-tell Dad, please.<eos> It will kill him.<eos> My God.<eos> Okay, it is done.<eos> We've removed one piece of metal.<eos> Looks like shrapnel.<eos> Good, it's all good. How big is it?<eos> Three centimeters by one.
I have to get that.<eos> Diane Lockhart's office.<eos> How can I... may I help you?<eos> I know. I shouldn't be interrupting you, but a Dr. Picot is on the line.<eos> Yes, it's his malpractice case.<eos> Tell him I'll call him back.<eos> No, no, no, he was arrested.<eos> What?<eos> When?<eos> Just an hour ago.

Explain your bid.<eos> I'm sure they'll listen.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go ahead,<eos> I'll take the next one.<eos> It's what I said against Trump.<eos> I spoke at a rally.<eos> No, a lot of folks spoke out against Trump.<eos> It's...<eos> Then what?
I thought he went out of business.<eos> He runs a 12-man operation<eos> - on the Gold Coast. - 12 men?<eos> Is he fucking kidding?<eos> We have 80 lawyers here.<eos> It's minority-owned?<eos> Yes. They just moved here from D.C.<eos> So it's about their government connections?<eos> My guess?<eos> Something more.
Well, just that you and Amy are getting harassing calls.<eos> That you're enjoying this new law firm.<eos> And that you were worried about Mom's cancer scare.<eos> Anything about Jax?<eos> I really don't think we should go there.<eos> It's okay, Rupert.<eos> Just that he still blames me for this Ponzi scheme.<eos> That's it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why? What else?
Maia.<eos> I work over there. No, I know.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I work for Diane, but when she's out, tell me if you need anything.<eos> What are you doing at 4:00?<eos> It's okay if you voted for him.<eos> We just need someone for a bid.<eos> Sorry, sorry, hi.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Why?
I like helping men with their self-esteem issues.<eos> Good lawyer?<eos> Very talented.<eos> So how far does a smile get you?<eos> The... The bad boy Tom Cruise smiles.<eos> Do the judges go wild for it?<eos> That and a good argument. No.<eos> I think you've always relied on the cute little metrosexual thing.<eos> The, "My God, the law is just something" I stumbled into," shit-eating grin.<eos> Wow, the powers of perception.
That and a good argument. No.<eos> I think you've always relied on the cute little metrosexual thing.<eos> The, "My God, the law is just something" I stumbled into," shit-eating grin.<eos> Wow, the powers of perception.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Whoever wins buys the other a drink.<eos> Won't you be busy... with your good blonde lawyer there?<eos> I'll make time.<eos> Let me think about it.<eos> Thanks for the burger.
Thank you.<eos> A citizen of Syria?<eos> No. The United States.<eos> I was wondering if you'd ever come by.<eos> Here I am.<eos> When was the last time you were here?<eos> Christmas.<eos> That's right. Chocolate-covered strawberries.<eos> What can I get you, Maia?<eos> Answers.
No, no. Okay.<eos> No, I don't understand.<eos> What is this regarding? It's regarding a very important matter regarding your suit.<eos> Sorry for saying "regarding" twice.<eos> My suit?<eos> I'm confused. Diane Lockhart has some important information for you regarding the Rindell matter.<eos> She's not my lawyer.<eos> I know, but she has information for you.<eos> Can you put her on?<eos> Actually, just one second.
I know, but she has information for you.<eos> Can you put her on?<eos> Actually, just one second.<eos> First, I need you to write something down regarding Diane.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> Um... okay.<eos> This is very important.<eos> Please write it down exactly.<eos> The numbers 8, 7, 3, 1, 0, 9, lowercase "H," capital letter "R," capital letter...<eos> Capital letter "U."
Why don't you repeat it back?<eos> What is this about again?<eos> Diane wanted you to have this code before you two talked.<eos> Why?<eos> I, um, why?<eos> I wasn't told all the whys and wherefores, but it seemed very important.<eos> One second.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You.<eos> Me?
I, um, why?<eos> I wasn't told all the whys and wherefores, but it seemed very important.<eos> One second.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You.<eos> Me?<eos> Why? We got the name of the patient in Syria.<eos> His family lives in Chicago and they won't talk to me.<eos> Why won't they talk to you?<eos> Okay, one second.
So Tariq's brother, Aimar, would seem to be the terrorist the U.S. is after, not Tariq?<eos> Tariq flew to Syria to try to stop him.<eos> He is not a terrorist.<eos> He is a student here. He is studying chemistry.<eos> And he flew to Syria with an airline ticket?<eos> Yes! To bring him home.<eos> Your Honor, Dr. Picot should be allowed to continue Tariq's surgery because the person he is helping not only is not a terrorist, he is trying to persuade a terrorist to come home.<eos> Mr. Morrello. Anything?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> One second, please.
Just like you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They wanted to draw the brother out.<eos> They wanted to get him to that clinic.<eos> Also reportedly killed in the drone strike were Aboulafia's brother and 34 hospital personnel.<eos> You did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> Something to destroy Jax.<eos> And Mom?
We already suggested we meet.<eos> - What?<eos> - She tweeted back.<eos> - What? !<eos> - "What do you look like?<eos> #Wetlandsex"<eos> _<eos> Oh. What are you gonna say?<eos> - I'll send a photo.<eos> - What, of you?
Ask her to send a photo back.<eos> Uh, what's the investigator's name?<eos> Jay DiPersia. Want me to get him?<eos> Yes, and Lucca, too.<eos> What... Marissa?<eos> You got something.<eos> - That was fast.<eos> Wow, you sent an attachment too.<eos> You're a saucy wench.<eos> What?
A problem with the fertility clinic... they say they have no record of a Laura Salano ever donating there.<eos> Diane Lockhart, please.<eos> I'm, uh, not sure how we can help you, Ms. Lockhart.<eos> At a certain age, fertility...<eos> I'm not here for myself.<eos> - I'm here for a client. - Oh.<eos> - You're an egg broker?<eos> - No, a lawyer.<eos> Uh, you used to be the Lake Drive Fertility Clinic, Doctor?<eos> Yes, years ago.
Diane Lockhart, please.<eos> I'm, uh, not sure how we can help you, Ms. Lockhart.<eos> At a certain age, fertility...<eos> I'm not here for myself.<eos> - I'm here for a client. - Oh.<eos> - You're an egg broker?<eos> - No, a lawyer.<eos> Uh, you used to be the Lake Drive Fertility Clinic, Doctor?<eos> Yes, years ago.<eos> Actually, two years ago.
Do you know we're lawyers, Doctor?<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - Do you know that we're lawyers?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> October.<eos> _<eos> The ovum that you have, Dr. Norwood, it belongs to our client, and she wants it back.<eos> What's your evidence of that?<eos> This contract.
Laugh if you will, but I need a woman... who is able to enjoy...<eos> - Someone to share your bed with, someone to show you the true meaning of love?<eos> No, God, no.<eos> No, I'm looking for someone to share a milkshake at Scooter's Frozen Custard.<eos> No, been a very long, hard year.<eos> God, they are good.<eos> - Mm. Sex is transient, but a Boston Shake...<eos> Okay, am I being invited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Next Tuesday.
So is this why you came in here today?<eos> Yes.<eos> As fascinating as I find you, Colin, I need to know what Mike Kresteva's up to.<eos> - This is from Kresteva?<eos> - Yeah. Why?<eos> Well, he was just given the police brutality study. Yes.<eos> So why is he after us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll check it out.<eos> Thanks for the burger.
Okay, I think I helped here.<eos> - With the Twitter account?<eos> - Yeah. Was that the first time you ever slapped anyone?<eos> Yeah, I guess it was.<eos> Anyway, I contacted Twitter and told them it was a Twitterbot imitating you, and they froze it until they review it.<eos> That's great.<eos> I didn't even realize you could do that.<eos> I didn't either.<eos> The, uh, problem, Laura, is... the last remaining ova has already been fertilized.<eos> - By who?
As far as my clients are concerned, it does.<eos> Your beef is with whoever voided the contract...<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I just want to see who the dad is.<eos> He'll be on the other side, right?<eos> I think so.<eos> The next person through those doors will be the father of my child.<eos> The next male through those doors will be the father of my child.<eos> My client is willing to pay for you to find another egg donor.<eos> How gracious.
I barely even know who you are.<eos> So I'm not?<eos> You're not.<eos> Go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a lie.<eos> I'm not being fired.<eos> I just got a new Google alert.<eos> It says that you just bought $350,000 in jewelry.<eos> What? !
Well, thank you, anyway.<eos> Did I visit your office yesterday?<eos> - You did.<eos> - Did I ask you about... police brutality cases in Chicago?<eos> - You did.<eos> - And did I ask you for suggestions on how to address this issue?<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> And you chose not to answer.<eos> I wasn't certain of your motives.<eos> My...
What does your AUSA say?<eos> Yeah, he lies.<eos> Does your boss know that?<eos> Well, everyone lies.<eos> But Kresteva is lying about us.<eos> He's saying we said things that we didn't.<eos> All right, here's what I can do. I could argue your case to the assistant attorney general, Wilbur Dincon.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
I'm not sure what the problem is here, Colin.<eos> Mike's got a strategy. He needs to pursue it.<eos> I'm just worried that it's an all African-American firm.<eos> - It's all black?<eos> - It's not all black.<eos> Diane Lockhart is Caucasian.<eos> It just seems like it would be a public relations disaster to go after an all African-American firm.<eos> Especially to try to curb police brutality suits.<eos> We're not just after them for police brutality.<eos> Okay, what else?
What's wrong?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, why? You just have a look.<eos> Mrs. Kolstad wants to see you now.<eos> Are we in trouble?<eos> What?<eos> No. Because I need this job.<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> We've had to make a difficult decision here.<eos> What?
Can I speak, please?<eos> Her client needs to prove themselves tough to this administration so they'll decide in their favor on the OOs, Your Honor.<eos> - I don't even know what that means.<eos> - Well, actually I don't either.<eos> Owned and operated TV stations, Your Honor.<eos> Right, so I don't understand, are you saying that your client didn't post the episode online?<eos> No, he did.<eos> I-I don't understand, Your Honor.<eos> - What's the defense?<eos> - Fair use.
And I wanted to point that out.<eos> So you put the episode online as a public service?<eos> Hey, look, let's not go overboard here.<eos> He's not Nelson Mandela.<eos> But I get your point. Counselor, do you have anything?<eos> Yes, let's see.<eos> The definition of fair use is that<eos> "brief excerpts of copyrightable material may be used."<eos> Brief. So... how long was that episode that you wrote?<eos> - 42 minutes.
- Yes.<eos> - Okay, and how small is that?<eos> Just give me a real-world example.<eos> I mean, just talk to me.<eos> Come on, take a sip.<eos> Tell me how small two microns are.<eos> Two microns are about... 1/50 of the width of a human hair.<eos> You just said something I understand, so start there.<eos> I mean, just take a single human hair, and imagine you had a knife that could cut that hair into 50 thin slices.<eos> What else?
What is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Check, please.<eos> Yeah. They're a little slow here, but that just gives us longer to get acquainted.<eos> Check, please.<eos> I represent Reddick, Boseman Koldstad.<eos> Aha. So they hired someone.<eos> Well, good for them.<eos> Look, here's the thing, um, this is my lunch break, Ms. "Tanjoni."<eos> - Tascioni.
Thanks.<eos> It was fantastic.<eos> You were fantastic.<eos> Did you, did you see his face when you made him read the date?<eos> You made him read it.<eos> It was classic.<eos> - It was like Perry Mason.<eos> - Yep.<eos> I think we've taken this as far as we can, so we should think about a possible deal.<eos> What?
- Are they both still alive?<eos> - Yes. Who's your best friend?<eos> I don't have a friend.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Say it again.<eos> I don't have a friend.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> That's your right.<eos> What?
I don't believe you.<eos> That's your right.<eos> What?<eos> Please don't say you're gonna save me.<eos> No, I'm gonna kiss you.<eos> Then I'm gonna save you.<eos> I had a best friend.<eos> Who?<eos> A co-worker.<eos> He or she?
That's your right.<eos> What?<eos> Please don't say you're gonna save me.<eos> No, I'm gonna kiss you.<eos> Then I'm gonna save you.<eos> I had a best friend.<eos> Who?<eos> A co-worker.<eos> He or she?<eos> She.
- Yeah.<eos> You fucked up.<eos> You got me interested.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What's with the boxes?<eos> I'm looking for a new place.<eos> Why?<eos> Just for a change.<eos> Change to what?<eos> A new place.
I look at all your faces and... and I see hope.<eos> So, we should probably split up into groups.<eos> No, let's divide up the posts.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Everybody take a pile.<eos> Uh, let's have racist posts here, anti-Semitic right here, and at the end up there<eos> - we'll have threatening posts. - Uh, we might need another pile.<eos> What?<eos> - "I would love to see you..." - ...<eos> Dead.
I need to see you today at lunch.<eos> What color panties are you wearing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm color blind.<eos> I was in a plea bargaining session when I realized<eos> I sent someone to jail for 30 years because I hadn't gotten laid.<eos> You wanted to talk?<eos> Uh, y-yeah,<eos> I'll have to get back to you on that.<eos> Four hours.
Are they American citizens?<eos> - What?<eos> - Has your dad called you?<eos> Why?<eos> God, look at you.<eos> - You hate me.<eos> - You're trying to destroy my dad.<eos> - How should I look?<eos> - I'm not destroying Henry. I'm just trying to keep him from destroying me.<eos> And you.
And you.<eos> I'm not the enemy here.<eos> You turned evidence.<eos> Because your dad was doing the same.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> We talked.<eos> We understand each other.<eos> - You should go.<eos> - Maia, your dad is gonna call you in the next day or two and ask you to meet him to talk.<eos> Just the two of you.
- Playing "Goodie" by Good Girl.<eos> No. Stop.<eos> Ada, stop.<eos> Sorry, it's this thing Fantasia got me.<eos> - Ada, stop playing!<eos> - Volume up.<eos> Go ahead, it wears itself out.<eos> - What should I do?<eos> - Well... I know what I want you to do, but you may not want to.<eos> What?
- Excuse me?<eos> - Who did you vote for for president?<eos> - I'm not gonna answer that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> It's irrelevant.<eos> Really? Your politics are irrelevant to this?<eos> Mr. Boseman, you gave $8,564 to Hillary Clinton.<eos> Diane Lockhart, you gave...<eos> - Where'd you get that?<eos> - Public records.
What are we looking for?<eos> - Threats.<eos> - Harassment.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Oh, Diane?<eos> You mean like, "Is it considered rape..."<eos> ... If you rape a female lawyer?<eos> Tell me, Ms. Lockhart, could you get me off if I raped a female lawyer?<eos> And here's another.<eos> Ugh, and two more.
- It's been forever.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do they have hummus here, or is it just chips?<eos> What?<eos> Uh, do they have real food here, or is it just drinks?<eos> I'm on this detox.<eos> I mean, if you eat eight chips, that's 142 calories.<eos> Uh, I-I don't know.<eos> And everyone goes on about how healthy guacamole is.<eos> What?
And everyone goes on about how healthy guacamole is.<eos> What?<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> - Good, how are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Oh, this is Zack.<eos> - Hey. - Hey, Zack, nice to meet you.<eos> Colin.<eos> Yeah, you too.
Do you have some proof to back up this contention?<eos> Yes.<eos> An Aaron Fowler claimed you directly told him to keep his harassment of this panel to under 13 posts.<eos> Do you know, the only thing sadder than Tom and Katie Bueller is a sputtering Ferris Bueller caught in a lie.<eos> God, you are exactly like my mom.<eos> - Can I read you a few posts? - Please.<eos> We want to give you every opportunity to defend yourself.<eos> This is to me from a pro-choice activist.<eos> - "Go to..." - ...<eos> Hell.
Good-bye, Diane Lockhart.<eos> I promised to give you a progress report on your case.<eos> So, hi, here I am.<eos> Anyway, I leaked a fictitious story to Henry Rindell about your firm receiving an $800,000 bribe from a fictitious client to backdate his earnings.<eos> Uh, w-what?<eos> Yeah, I know. But we can use this to embarrass Kresteva.<eos> Ms. Tascioni, I'm sorry to be prosaic in my thinking, but this doesn't seem like a baroque matter.<eos> We didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Why are you misleading the investigator?<eos> Good question.
All right? You're a product analyst.<eos> No one asks what that is.<eos> - Do you want a setup?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hi, we're just in the market for a two bedroom in the Loop, so we saw this and we skidded to a stop, didn't we, Jay?<eos> Oh, God, he hates when I rattle on like that. But we love each other, so what can I say?<eos> Young love. It's infectious. Isn't it?<eos> Like the plague.<eos> Well, this is a very good starter apartment for young couples.<eos> Especially young professionals.
We may have to move in a month or two.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Money, Dad.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why don't I let you two talk.<eos> - Good to see you, Amy.<eos> - You, too, Henry.<eos> We should talk.<eos> We did.<eos> Yes. But once more.
- Thanks?<eos> I wish I could wear earrings like that, - but they make my face droopy.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> Um, he wants to bankrupt you.<eos> Right. I got a call from the Paisley Group.<eos> There was a federal agent over there yesterday asking questions about us.<eos> He's trying to scare off our clients.<eos> What?
Sorry.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> Um, he wants to bankrupt you.<eos> Right. I got a call from the Paisley Group.<eos> There was a federal agent over there yesterday asking questions about us.<eos> He's trying to scare off our clients.<eos> What?<eos> - What?<eos> - No, you.<eos> What?
I don't care who is.<eos> - It's looking like a persecution.<eos> - It's a tactic.<eos> Well, then, go around it.<eos> You need to make it clear that this is not about race.<eos> Vita voglio essere uno squalo.<eos> Nella mia prossima vita voglio essere uno squalo.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Italian.<eos> - Why?
- Where's the defense?<eos> - I'm here, Your Honor.<eos> You're late.<eos> You had me waiting.<eos> My apologies, Your Honor.<eos> I was just assigned this case.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> We start at 10:00, you're here at 10:00.<eos> What do we have today?<eos> Tortious interference.
- So... $1.3 million versus $86 million.<eos> - Those two things are not connected.<eos> - Whah-whah-whah-whah.<eos> - Don't cry poverty in here!<eos> - We're not crying poverty.<eos> - Ms. Quinn clearly wants to avoid... - We're just saying that the DOJ is... - any oversight by officials...<eos> - intentionally trying...<eos> - To take something... caught in the cookie jar...<eos> Both of you, back in your seats.<eos> Decorum.
Yikes, who pissed you off?<eos> Can we do the cute talk another time please?<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> A nine-digit number, some repeats, all connected to top CEOs.<eos> But none of them are from tax returns or legal cases or employee numbers.<eos> - Did you try Social Security numbers?<eos> - Yes. Maybe they're passwords.<eos> That just happened to all be nine digits?<eos> Maybe they're part of some secret society of rich assholes.<eos> What?
Diane Lockhart.<eos> Pastor Jeremiah, how are you?<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> You are looking well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As are you.<eos> You get younger looking.<eos> No, no, it's the times.<eos> It lights a fire in your belly.<eos> That and a stationary bike.
Then die. That's how you know the truth.<eos> Die. And God'll tell you.<eos> So there's an hour missing.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Now, either someone is covering for the reverend, or Paul Johnson and his lawyer don't want us to see - that his dealer entered the room.<eos> Wait, wait, freeze.<eos> It's a laptop; Just press the space button.<eos> Do you want me to enhance?<eos> What?
- I don't know.<eos> Now, either someone is covering for the reverend, or Paul Johnson and his lawyer don't want us to see - that his dealer entered the room.<eos> Wait, wait, freeze.<eos> It's a laptop; Just press the space button.<eos> Do you want me to enhance?<eos> What?<eos> I was just thinking I'm pretty good at your job.<eos> I think I'll go for a detective license.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What?
No two routes appear to be the same.<eos> But about two weeks ago, a pattern started to emerge.<eos> Two or three times a week, Paul's routes included a pit stop at Kovac's office. Well, that makes sense;<eos> He's his lawyer.<eos> Paul didn't claim to have a lawyer until we served him the eviction notice.<eos> Good.<eos> We need to look deeper into Kovac.<eos> Any lawsuits, past crimes.<eos> See what you can find.<eos> Perfect timing. Yeah.
Carl, you said this was a battle between the firm's heart and its head.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's about the past or the future.<eos> Your past glories have a lot to teach us, but this... this is now.<eos> The fights are now, and Adrian knows how to fight them.<eos> I vote for Adrian.<eos> So here we are.<eos> We're split.<eos> Yep.<eos> 50/50.
We're split.<eos> Yep.<eos> 50/50.<eos> This should be fun.<eos> That's the problem with the world today?<eos> You think the fights are different now.<eos> But you're wrong.<eos> They're exactly the same.<eos> May I?<eos> To idealism.
Hi. Well, I hope you both had a nice lunch.<eos> I'd like to keep this under three hours.<eos> Certainly. See's?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - See's?<eos> - No.<eos> My husband picked out all the good stuff and sent me to work with the coconuts.<eos> What's your husband's name?<eos> Michael... son.<eos> Why?
Good. Maia, um, let's talk about when you did become aware of the Ponzi scheme.<eos> You said it was when the press reported on it.<eos> Yes.<eos> And not before?<eos> That is correct.<eos> You graduated from law school in 2016, right?<eos> Yes. Was it a big day?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, there was a celebration at your parents' house.<eos> To a fantastic year.
You need to speak in hypotheticals,<eos> Mr. Sweeney.<eos> But... why? We can't put you on the stand knowing you will perjure yourself.<eos> You can only relate something that is true or potentially true.<eos> God, I love the law.<eos> And everybody takes it so seriously.<eos> - Your party?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Chemsex.<eos> Chemse...
But... why?

Drug cocktails, then sex.<eos> Most enlightening.
I couldn't find anything. So I went back with a K9 unit this morning...<eos> Talk about a convenient memory.<eos> Ma'am. No.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor. Please, tell the court what, if anything, you found.<eos> A white plastic bag containing approximately 1.5 grams of a synthetic cathinone commonly known as bath salts.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Why aren't they introducing the dashboard cam into evidence?<eos> Mr. Boseman, Ms. Lockhart, are you both done pounding your table?<eos> I apologize, Your Honor. But given the significance of the officer's new testimony, I'm curious why we're not seeing his dashboard video of the encounter.<eos> Good question.
Your Honor, there's nothing exculpatory on that recording.<eos> - Well, that's a relief, Your Honor.<eos> - My guess is. You would like to see it.<eos> If it's not too much trouble.<eos> The State has three hours to provide Defense with the dashboard video.<eos> Adjourned.<eos> Hey, you want a rental, you got to talk to the office.<eos> No, I need a name.<eos> Last night, you drove someone. A man in a suit.<eos> This man.
Why? You know him?<eos> No. You will not put him on the stand.<eos> You have no right!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He saw what happened.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I insist that you not contact him again, or I'm hiring other lawyers.<eos> - So you did beat up that cop?<eos> - No.<eos> - What?
Prince James it is!<eos> Your father loves you so much.<eos> My son.<eos> Careful with your words.<eos> This deal must stay a secret, which means this boy... is no longer your son.<eos> I want to say something.<eos> Emma, I am so proud of you for what you did tonight.<eos> Defeating Gideon reminds us that, with a little bit of hope, nothing can tear this family apart.<eos> I'd like to make a toast... to family.<eos> - To family.

Why are you here?<eos> You've forgotten your father.<eos> You were barely my father.<eos> You were a drunk who died when I was 6 years old!<eos> I owe you nothing!<eos> You don't truly believe that.<eos> Is this... is this why you're here?<eos> I've spent my whole life trying to forget you.<eos> Tell me what you want!<eos> The truth.
Well, I am going to tell him.<eos> It's... difficult.<eos> Actually, it's quite easy.<eos> You tell him that he has no rights to his daughter... none.<eos> And if he comes anywhere near her, I will make him bleed!<eos> Go home, Zelena.<eos> Ta-ta.<eos> Robin, there's something I need to...<eos> Nottingham?<eos> No.
Because I just really desperately need<eos> - to kiss you right now.<eos> - Hang on!<eos> You're forgetting something.<eos> What's that?<eos> My superpower...<eos> I know when you're lying.<eos> What are you hiding from me?<eos> The truth is, um... I'm a bit out of sorts...<eos> - because of Archie.
- Archie?<eos> Y-Yeah, I paid the Cricket a visit because I needed to talk to him about... about you.<eos> I thought you were gonna die.<eos> And that does something to a man.<eos> It changes the way he thinks about things... about us...<eos> And he reminded me how important it was to share my feelings.<eos> And I didn't want to let you in the shed without sharing them, so... feelings shared.<eos> Well, I like feelings once in a while.<eos> Now, why was I here?<eos> Life jackets. Right.
So I guess you want me to move before you write me a ticket?<eos> I already gave you a ticket, ma'am.<eos> You're new here, aren't you?<eos> - It's my first week.<eos> - Well, you're doing a fine job.<eos> You know, it's teenagers like that you should really look out for.<eos> You never know what kind of trouble they might get into.<eos> Seriously, you should really keep an eye on those two.<eos> In case they end up somewhere they shouldn't be.<eos> - Nice shot.
Hello.<eos> Hi. It's nice to see each of you enjoying one more day in Middleton.<eos> Yeah, we figured we might as well stick around and soak up some of the local flavor, since when are either of us going to be back in this town again?<eos> We ran into each other at Middleton Botanical Gardens and discovered we both shared an interest in gardening.<eos> Who could have known the two of us had so much in common?<eos> So you ended up enjoying your days here, after all.<eos> Yeah. Grey House is really starting to feel like home.<eos> "A radiant palace in the greenest of our valleys, by good angels tenanted."<eos> - That's Edgar Allan Poe.<eos> - The Haunted Palace.
No, I mean, it's possible, it's just...<eos> I'm the one with the unique perspective.<eos> Which you'reconvinced is so much better than mine.<eos> Whoa. What we have here is a sea of flowers and a romantic evening that we don't want to see go to waste.<eos> I'll tell you what was a waste: this entire day, and then coming home with you.<eos> It's a good thing we never have to see each other again.<eos> That's the best news I've heard all week.<eos> Why did I even open a stupid flower shop?<eos> - Well, I'm sorry about all this.<eos> - About what?
She just thinks that the town needs something<eos> - and then makes it happen.<eos> - A woman of action.<eos> Yeah, she had this sense... well, she called it her "flutter"... where she knew when things were going to turn out right or wrong.<eos> I think I'm going to like this movie.<eos> I think you're going to love it.<eos> Is it all right if I see the mayor tomorrow?<eos> There's something that I want to talk to her about.<eos> Is my daughter planning on changing the world?<eos> Just a small part of it.
- When you get a chance.<eos> - Yeah. No problem.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> Do you have anything to put, like, popcorn in?<eos> Uh, like a bowl?<eos> - Like some fancy containers.
- Hmm. I don't think so.<eos> Well, I knew it was a long shot.<eos> It's just... you sell so many different things in this place.<eos> I like to keep a variety, just in case.<eos> Well, I need something that really stands out because of what's going to be in them.<eos> Well, I'm experimenting with all kinds of different flavors so that Ben knows just how much effort I put into it.<eos> Well, then, I hope you find the one thing that's perfect.<eos> Yeah, I'll just have to keep looking.<eos> Are you going to the theatre now?<eos> - Yeah, then the grocery store.
Because I want the decisions of my administration - to outlive even me.<eos> - Well, I'm sure the next generation will take into account everything that you've done.<eos> If there's anything to take account of.<eos> I heard Stephanie saying she was taking her concessions to the theatre.<eos> I'm sure she could use a hand.<eos> - That's an excellent idea.<eos> - To get me away from anybody<eos> - I don't want to see.<eos> - And to help out a friend.<eos> What?
Like mother, like daughter.<eos> I thought I could sneak in here without getting caught.<eos> I wasn't trying to catch you.<eos> I just need you to look at this.<eos> Oh, what is it?<eos> Oh. Numbers.<eos> Nobody who works in city government should ever have to look at numbers.<eos> Except those are good numbers.<eos> Especially...<eos> - this one.
It's a handrail.<eos> Nobody appreciates great art.<eos> - Popcorn, get your popcorn!<eos> - There's only one kind.<eos> Yep. Plain.<eos> I decided that the concessions aren't supposed to take over the whole night.<eos> They're... just supposed to accent what is already here.<eos> That way, the star of the show can be the star of the show.<eos> - Glad I made it. - Hey!<eos> Yeah, just in time.
Then he'd use the whiteboard.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - Our first lead.<eos> - Let's start there.<eos> - Here's what we know.<eos> Rutger ate Josh's whitefish.<eos> Wait.<eos> That squiggle is the fish?<eos> Put waves up above so we know it's underwater.<eos> Oh, good idea.
Certainly limits our options for going forward.<eos> Here!<eos> I found a helmet.<eos> I know this marking. It's from Saw's team.<eos> There's another.<eos> Oh, and more down there.<eos> All from Saw's unit.<eos> But where are the people?<eos> They must've been attacked.<eos> By who?
I don't understand. Where did the rebels go?<eos> It's just a dead end.<eos> Do you have to call it that?<eos> Look!<eos> Are those Geonosians?<eos> Not Geonosians.<eos> Clankers.<eos> Halt.<eos> You will be eliminated.<eos> Battle droids.
You don't just find a fully operational shield generator on a deserted planet for no reason.<eos> Good point.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> Um, no. What does that mean?<eos> Work fast!<eos> A shield generator?<eos> Separatist model.<eos> About as old as you, Rex.<eos> But someone's kept it operational, been maintaining it.<eos> Battle droids?
Sabine and Zeb found a shield generator. They're out there extracting the deflector core.<eos> You have to warn them.<eos> Gerrera says once the storm dies down, the droids will be coming.<eos> Looks like the storm's letting up.<eos> Spectre-4, Spectre-5.<eos> Get back to the Ghost immediately.<eos> Affirmative, Spectre-2.<eos> We've got the deflector core, and we're...<eos> Leave it if you have to. There are battle droids in the area. I don't know how many.<eos> Battle droids?
Spectre-4, Spectre-5.<eos> Get back to the Ghost immediately.<eos> Affirmative, Spectre-2.<eos> We've got the deflector core, and we're...<eos> Leave it if you have to. There are battle droids in the area. I don't know how many.<eos> Battle droids?<eos> I don't see any battle droids. I just see a bunch of rocks.<eos> I'm not sure those are rocks.<eos> Destroyers.<eos> Oh, no.
We capture the bug, we turn off the droids, we save your friends.<eos> What do you think, Hera?<eos> It's a good plan. Get the bug.<eos> Ezra, I'm sending you over there on three.<eos> One. Two. Three!<eos> Chopper, go with him.<eos> Even with your help, I can't jump that far.<eos> I've got a better idea.<eos> You thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> For once, yes.
I always forget they can do that.<eos> Yeah, but he's no Skywalker.<eos> I heard that.<eos> Down here.<eos> I think.<eos> Chopper, any sign of him?<eos> Go. Go!<eos> This way.<eos> Let's split up. You go that way and cut him off.<eos> Oh!
Maybe the mediator took it?<eos> Like I said, the guy's a crook.<eos> I got him.<eos> Someone tagged Lucifer at The Grove.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Someone named "Cottoncandy86"?<eos> That's an unfortunate name.<eos> No, Mom, it's an Internet-- never mind.<eos> It looks like they were getting frozen yogurt to celebrate... newlywed life?<eos> #mrslucifer, #hottiehubby?
I haven't seen you in a while, Lucifer.<eos> Uh, I know you've been through Hell.<eos> I suppose we can discuss that another time.<eos> Oh, no, no, there's no need for censoring, Doctor.<eos> Candy and I have no secrets.<eos> Isn't that the key to a successful marriage?<eos> And how are you coping since your... travels?<eos> Any warning signs of lasting trauma?<eos> Denial?<eos> Rash decisions?
I begged him to quit, but no.<eos> My hubby's all about his work.<eos> He is? Oh, my God, it's "Detective this," and "Detective that."<eos> Working with you means so much to him.<eos> Well, he's got a strange way of showing it.<eos> Well, duh. Dude's totally messed up.<eos> But then, you probably already know that, huh?<eos> 'Cause you're kind of the reason why?<eos> What? Uh... Didn't you two just go through a super bananas situation?<eos> With like, poison?
I appreciate your honesty. And now, I'd like to be honest with you.<eos> Oh. This'll be a hoot.<eos> Since I escaped Hell, all I've wanted is to get back to the Silver City, to reunite our family.<eos> You're still fantasizing about heavenly rebellion?<eos> Just let it go, Mum.<eos> Been there, done that, big fall.<eos> But that's just it.<eos> Why do you think you lost that fight?<eos> Oh, I don't know, let's have a think, shall we?<eos> Not enough cardio?
I just consulted insisted emotions can't be controlled.<eos> Well, we respectfully disagree.<eos> Um, our children learn to manage their emotions in no time.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?<eos> Let the schooling begin!<eos> You see, we make our students' emotional needs the priority.<eos> Whence our motto.<eos> "Sentio ergo sum."<eos> "I feel, therefore I am."<eos> Fascinating.
Well, she implied that a hefty contribution to the school would grease the wheels on Wolfe's admission.<eos> So you made the contribution and Wolfe was still rejected?<eos> Yes.<eos> We felt we'd been... misled.<eos> More like robbed.<eos> And then, when we tried to bring it up to Debbie, she had the gall to suggest that the school hadn't received the donation.<eos> But the check cleared!<eos> Lying...<eos> I know my husband's temper suggests otherwise, but we're dealing with this the civilized way...<eos> Through our lawyer.
I am now, am I?<eos> - On what charge?<eos> - Ladies, he's resisting arrest.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Right, why do you sexy detectives look so disturbingly familiar?<eos> Mum!<eos> Mum, come on.<eos> Come on out from wherever you're snooping.<eos> What?
My pleasure.<eos> Right, why do you sexy detectives look so disturbingly familiar?<eos> Mum!<eos> Mum, come on.<eos> Come on out from wherever you're snooping.<eos> What?<eos> I tried to find ones that resemble your detective.<eos> Then again, all humans look alike to me.<eos> No, you did, um, well, remarkably well.<eos> But what on Earth for?
The donation never made it into the school account.<eos> I cashed the check.<eos> You stole the money? - Why?<eos> - I guess I was tired of feeling like I didn't belong.<eos> Starford seemed so nonjudgmental and inclusive.<eos> But I'm-I'm under a lot of pressure to look a certain way, drive a certain car.<eos> And my salary barely covers my rent.<eos> Okay, so Debbie found out that you took.<eos> Jon and Craig's donation money and... did you kill her?<eos> What?
You know that?<eos> You want to talk about something now?<eos> I could tell you anything? Yes.<eos> I'd like to ride with Lucifer.<eos> I promise I'll make him take me to my actual school this time.<eos> You are lucky my daughter likes you so much.<eos> Yes, I'm starting to respect the deceptive little parasite.<eos> Well, that's nice.<eos> Speaking of, a deal's a deal.<eos> What?

He says it's you killing Debbie.<eos> He was listening to me.<eos> He never listens to me.<eos> So you said that you killed Debbie?<eos> No, I-I said I wanted to kill her.<eos> Every morning, while peeling the sticker off some root vegetable I got at the supermarket for a third of the price of the organic crap.<eos> Rubbing it in dirt works like a charm, by the way.<eos> Why would you say that to him?<eos> Because I'm single and I work full-time, and Debbie had a million little ways of making me feel like a bad mom because of it.<eos> - For working?
Like, I'm sorry that my bake sale cupcakes weren't gluten and dairy free, Debbie.<eos> Joy, where were you two nights ago?<eos> Tuesday?<eos> Um, I was, I was with Mr. Taylor.<eos> Mr. Taylor?<eos> The wellness mentor?<eos> What were you doing?<eos> We weren't discussing the French New Wave.<eos> So you're having an affair with the... with the P.E. teacher.<eos> Only on Tuesday nights.
Yeah, she-she asked me to grab something for her.<eos> Well, let's get that over with, me.<eos> Don't tell her I, got a copy made.<eos> She gets all fussy about things like illegal duplicates.<eos> So, do you do private tutoring?<eos> 'Cause I'm free most of the time.<eos> Specifically now.<eos> Yeah. Lucifer, what are you doing?<eos> Madison said she needed something from your car.<eos> What?
With your stupid handsome face and your chiseled abs and your huge...<eos> You slept with the P.E. teacher, too?<eos> Well, the movement and wellness mentor, Detective, but...<eos> Madison, if I've learned anything here tonight, it's that everyone here has secrets.<eos> No one's perfect.<eos> Okay? But we didn't have sex.<eos> Well, I mean, okay, one time. But, come on, that was, like, years ago.<eos> One time was all it took.<eos> This is about your son, isn't it?<eos> What?
I-I get it. I-I'm a mother, too.<eos> Um, maybe you remember Trixie, my daughter.<eos> Th-The little girl who was sad because her mom had such a scary job.<eos> That's me.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> So, please,<eos> Madison, put down the gun.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I-I got so angry, I couldn't control myself.<eos> What?
I wasn't lying before, obviously.<eos> I do intend to use the Flaming Sword to cut through the Gates of Heaven.<eos> But what you left out...?<eos> Is that once I do that, I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven and slamming the gates on her backside.<eos> But she'll be trapped there, on her own.<eos> Won't God destroy her?<eos> Hopefully, they tear each other apart.<eos> Then they'll both get what they deserve.<eos> What's that?<eos> Punishment.
Then they'll both get what they deserve.<eos> What's that?<eos> Punishment.<eos> For manipulating me.<eos> I mean, Dad set a trap for me, but Mum was the one who made sure that I fell into it.<eos> She was the one that made sure that I felt... that I... that I felt things that I don't want to feel anymore.<eos> That, right there, that what you stopped yourself from feeling, that's exactly what you need to feel.<eos> What, the anger?<eos> I feel it.<eos> Not the anger.
Well, I don't know. I haven't told her.<eos> Hence the secret part of the secret plan.<eos> - She's your best friend.<eos> - Yes, well, as much as I love my little sex thug,<eos> Maze can do things that she thinks are in my best interest that turn out to be, well, disastrous.<eos> And I can't afford that.<eos> But the good news is she's busy focusing on her new bestie right now.<eos> The detective.<eos> They're practically inseparable.<eos> Hey, roomie.

Or just a... A stranger on a bus.<eos> My father would never use public transport.<eos> That song is completely unrealistic.<eos> - What song?<eos> - The song I hate almost as much as I hate these hypocrites, like God Johnson.<eos> Hypocrite? I don't know.<eos> I see some similarities between the two of you.<eos> That man is not my father.<eos> Well, good thing, 'cause he might be our killer.<eos> Whaaat?
Markowitz?<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Don't you have better things to do than to raid our fridge?<eos> I was about to leave this place altogether, but I hit an unexpected snag.<eos> Now I need to distract myself with something.<eos> Hello, something.<eos> You know, just in case I'm giving off an "I have zero self-respect" vibe, let me make it clear.<eos> Hands off.<eos> I'd rather sit at home alone, and in the dark, than to hang out with you.<eos> Sassy.
I'm not the Devil.<eos> I'm just a man who's delusional.<eos> I made it all up. I made it all up!<eos> Hello, son.<eos> Dad!<eos> See?<eos> I am the Devil.<eos> Nice try, Santa.<eos> - Tell me what you told the police.<eos> - Only the truth.
I made it all up. I made it all up!<eos> Hello, son.<eos> Dad!<eos> See?<eos> I am the Devil.<eos> Nice try, Santa.<eos> - Tell me what you told the police.<eos> - Only the truth.<eos> That you, Mr. Kringle, are a cold-blooded killer.<eos> - What else?
"The piece is here."<eos> Well, what do you know.<eos> It fits perfectly.<eos> Yes, I think this is what Uriel was trying to tell me.<eos> Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.<eos> It wasn't complete.<eos> Dad supposedly destroyed the Flaming Sword after the rebellion.<eos> So, are you saying he just broke it into two pieces?<eos> And this.
- Detective, we should do something.<eos> - He's at a bar downtown.<eos> Would you come with me and make sure that he's okay?<eos> Nope.<eos> - Nope?<eos> - I'm a homicide cop.<eos> I do not go around checking on worried criminals like a nanny, Charlotte.<eos> - So if we're done here.<eos> - I heard... things.<eos> On a... onon the phone call.
But you know what? I'm so busy.<eos> I have been sidelined by my own mother and the detective.<eos> It's absurd.<eos> I won't stand for it.<eos> I am gonna find a way into that party.<eos> Do you always whine like this?<eos> I don't know how she puts up with it.<eos> Where's Dr. Linda?<eos> Suspended.<eos> Because of you.
Have you seen my plus one?<eos> She's a tiredlooking blonde.<eos> Probably dressed in something freshlyplucked from the floor.<eos> Let's get this pajama party started.<eos> I still don't understand why you're helping us.<eos> Bianca's your client.<eos> I'm not the same woman I was when she hired me.<eos> Did you have a change of heart?<eos> No, the same heart.<eos> Completely different soul, though.
They're angels.<eos> But speaking of children...<eos> What did Chet do now?<eos> Run out on another tab?<eos> The police suspect him of killing Zeke Moore.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I have it from a very good source.<eos> I'll get to the bottom of it.<eos> Thank you, Charlotte.<eos> - As always.
- That's enough, ma'am. Chet, you're so good.<eos> - You're dope!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I... - I love you more.<eos> Look, that phone... I think it is way more important than we thought.<eos> It might be the key to taking down Bianca.<eos> Great. Now that we've solved that, I can get back to the case and...<eos> Ooh!<eos> God! What?
- Let's go.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I... - I love you more.<eos> Look, that phone... I think it is way more important than we thought.<eos> It might be the key to taking down Bianca.<eos> Great. Now that we've solved that, I can get back to the case and...<eos> Ooh!<eos> God! What?<eos> !<eos> What?
Speak, not read.<eos> I've always found tongues much more useful than books.<eos> So whatever language this is...<eos> It's Sumerian.<eos> Unlike some of us who had everything handed to him, I actually spent my youth studying.<eos> Excellent.<eos> My smart boy.<eos> Howhow quickly can you translate it?<eos> Um, should only take me a few days.<eos> Days?
I am a doctor, but patching people up isn't my thing.<eos> It is now.<eos> Suppose I could take a gander.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> I should warn you, you might have to...<eos> - What? !<eos> Who did that to you?<eos> I mean, was it Lucifer?<eos> I-I mean... not on purpose, you know.<eos> Accidentally, like with that
I know that you've been living in Mexico, but can you think of anyone who may have wanted your brother dead?<eos> My family had many enemies.<eos> It's why I left, to get away from the Ruiz empire.<eos> I tried to get Chet to go with me, but...<eos> But, unfortunately, he got involved in the family business.<eos> I know you were the one who put my mother in prison.<eos> I also know you were after Chet, so I know what you think of my family.<eos> But I loved my brother.<eos> He didn't deserve to die.<eos> Especially not like that.
We're not killers.<eos> God, no.<eos> We run Dandy Lyon Cleaners.<eos> Lyon's our last name.<eos> Get it?<eos> We take care of crime scenes, dead body removals.<eos> All the icky stuff.<eos> But totally legit.<eos> Yeah, like this poor guy, died of a heart attack.<eos> Like, two weeks ago.
Now, it is finally time that I go back to being the loyal soldier that he entrusted me to be.<eos> Mom is not going anywhere!<eos> Well, I am afraid that we do not have a choice, Brother!<eos> Mum's powers are returning, and it won't be long before we can't contain them.<eos> I mean, she's already killed one person, and now the detective is on a... the detective is on her case.<eos> So, please, no discussion.<eos> Mum has to go!<eos> She already has.<eos> Your mother's gone.<eos> What?
She's on Santa Monica Pier, and she wants the piece.<eos> We have to give it to her, Amenadiel.<eos> We've run out of options.<eos> Please.<eos> Brother, please.<eos> She... she has Chloe.<eos> Linda!<eos> You here?<eos> ! I'm tracking Lucifer's mom, and I think she might be on her way.<eos> Oh, no.
Look, if you think that I wouldn't forgive you for your mistakes or your flaws, if you think that I don't know who you really are by now, you're wrong.<eos> Linda, look at you.<eos> Lucifer. I'm okay.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I-I should never have got you involved in any of this from the start.<eos> It's not like I didn't know I was dealing with the most powerful, well... the most dysfunctional family in the universe.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> I walked into this with my eyes wide open, chose to be your friend and face all that comes with that.<eos> The good, the bad and the crispy.<eos> What?
You know, I think we're gonna go old school.<eos> I'm thinkin'... The Romantics.<eos> Okay, now I'm jealous.<eos> Tom.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Agent Keen, that is so cool.<eos> I had no idea you were so artsy-craftsy.<eos> I just found this outside my front door.<eos> What?
Tom.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Agent Keen, that is so cool.<eos> I had no idea you were so artsy-craftsy.<eos> I just found this outside my front door.<eos> What?<eos> Like a gift?<eos> No, like a warning...<eos> or a cry for help.
Why haven't you taken these premonitions to the police?<eos> I have.<eos> They looked at me like I'm crazy.<eos> That's why I came to you, Agent Keen.<eos> I saw you at the grocery store, recognized you from the news.<eos> I followed you home because I thought you'd understand.<eos> The pardon.<eos> You know what it's like to be judged harshly, how it feels not to be believed.<eos> When did these premonitions start?<eos> Just over two years ago.
For now.<eos> But they're out there, very close.<eos> The next time they call, we're gonna find them.<eos> I don't know whether to be relieved or terrified.<eos> Thanks to you, I know how it's happening, but it's only happening because these people, these killers live nearby.<eos> How much of it do you think she actually understands?<eos> Too much, I'm afraid.<eos> That's why she does it.<eos> She knows they have to be stopped.<eos> ...a kid?
Charnquist is in the building. Get Con Ed on the line.<eos> Cut the power, lock up that elevator.<eos> Sir, I know have a lot of bad news today, but the security system in the building shows there's a backup generator.<eos> What the hell is goin' on?<eos> Get Ressler on the horn now.<eos> He's not answering.<eos> - ♪ not alone ♪ - The stop!<eos> Where's the emergency stop?<eos> Incredible.<eos> Truly incredible.
Do you know who he is?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> That's good.<eos> Then it's only a matter of time.<eos> Well, this seems like a good fit.<eos> For now.<eos> Last two years haven't been kind to people we work for.<eos> You take care... or we'll be mopping you up with club soda.<eos> So you do use club soda.<eos> Fascinating.
Let's not panic just yet.<eos> Maybe he doesn't remember us ruining his life and stomping all over his heart.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> I'm Sergeant Wells.<eos> Jake, Amy, nice to see you.<eos> Teddy, nice to see you, too.<eos> Excited to have you in the field with us.<eos> Good.<eos> I just hope I don't bore you to death.<eos> Ah, what?
- Definitely the last one.<eos> - Right?<eos> No, I really think it's William Atherton.<eos> Okay.<eos> We have to engage him on topics that he cares about.<eos> Pilsners... he loves talking about pilsners.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Just saying the word gives me PTSD.<eos> Pilsner-TSD.<eos> - Good one.
But the fake fight's back on.<eos> So shut it, you bigmouthed bitch and your stupid sneakers!<eos> If you don't like my shoes, you can just tell me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you guys about something?<eos> Actually, Teddy, this is not a good time.<eos> We're still having a pretty big fight.<eos> Well, I think what I'm about to say may solve things.<eos> y, I'm still in love with you. What?<eos> - What?
Yeah, and then they got married.<eos> Then they got pregnant, and then the kid has a tumor in her heart.<eos> I thought you had a TMR.<eos> Yeah, I thought you had a ventral hernia repair.<eos> I did, and I pushed it.<eos> Me too.<eos> - Robbins has you on standby?<eos> - No, I wouldn't say that.<eos> Well, I think it's a good idea.<eos> Just in case.
Never mind.<eos> Go away, both of you.<eos> Someone page Dr. Warren.<eos> Laparotomy closed. Fetus and baby stable.<eos> Nice work, Dr. Brody.<eos> And welcome back, Dr. Pierce.<eos> - Tonight.<eos> Sabrina's Restaurant.<eos> - Sorry? Let's go have a drink and have a conversation.<eos> - Like a date?
And you know this.<eos> You're a doctor... ish.<eos> Ohh.<eos> That's a good catch today, Edwards.<eos> You know, undiagnosed, Cross' TB would have only gotten worse with time.<eos> Yeah, I didn't catch it. Cross did.<eos> Well, how is that?<eos> I thought it was internitis. I made up my mind about it before I even took his temperature.<eos> Well, it was still a good outcome.<eos> Yeah, despite me.
The fear goes away, trust me.<eos> You might be willing to risk it again.<eos> Hi. Can I take a look at your head?<eos> This might sting a little, okay?<eos> - There we go. - Ah.<eos> Okay, Diego, look at this boo-boo.<eos> You may need a few stitches when we land. But that's okay.<eos> You know what, my little girl, when she was your age, she busted her knee open.<eos> Do you know how many stitches she got?<eos> Three.
You got her hooked up to machines just to stay alive.<eos> That is an IV to keep her hydrated.<eos> Now, what can that be?<eos> I never thought I could fall in love so fast, but I've never felt like this about anyone.<eos> I'm so glad we found each other.<eos> Me too, dumpling.<eos> Every day.<eos> It's, like, affecting my body and soul.<eos> Does make you want to puke.<eos> Oh, my...
Someone have a ruler?<eos> That's got to be at least 10 inches long.<eos> Uh, that's bigger.<eos> She's got a few ulcerations, but I'm not sure it's anything that needs additional repair.<eos> Do you think they were trying to find a way out? Mm-hmm.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Okay, let's scoot that bucket over here.<eos> I got it. Okay.<eos> Okay, yeah. Yeah. Right there.<eos> O... Okay. No, no.
And I plan to grow old with my man and to have old-people sex.<eos> Well, don't you want to have old-people sex, Catherine?<eos> Because that's what you'll get if you set your ego aside and listen to me instead of dismissing me the way you keep dismissing your own damn husband!<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Doctor... Avery.<eos> Good night.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I had a patient full of worms today.<eos> Did you take any pictures?<eos> What?
I've had to reprimand him myself.<eos> Of course I read his file.<eos> After a mistake like Warren makes, a resident goes one of two ways.<eos> He either plays it smarter or he plays it safer.<eos> Warren went safer.<eos> He may not even be aware it's happening.<eos> Moving on.<eos> Martin Carver.<eos> You talk to Wilson a lot. Uh, daily.<eos> Why?
- Hi, Holly.<eos> I'm Dr. Kepner. - Hi.<eos> Can you tell me how you fell?<eos> So, I was having the best sex of my life.<eos> No, third-best.<eos> I'd hate to see the best.<eos> No, no.<eos> So, then I had to pee. And it was dark, and I'm trying to find the bathroom.<eos> I found the front door instead, walked right out in the stairwell and...<eos> - Oh, no.
I'm Dr. Kepner. - Hi.<eos> Can you tell me how you fell?<eos> So, I was having the best sex of my life.<eos> No, third-best.<eos> I'd hate to see the best.<eos> No, no.<eos> So, then I had to pee. And it was dark, and I'm trying to find the bathroom.<eos> I found the front door instead, walked right out in the stairwell and...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Yeah, two flights.
Uh, well, according to these numbers, I say we amputate, then.<eos> Here's a number for you, Warren... 27.<eos> A 27-year-old wants to keep his hand.<eos> We're gonna do a rotational flap with antibiotic beads and try to save this guy's hand.<eos> Right. Of course.<eos> Book an O.R. and, uh, get me some images of his left and right thighs, also, for the grafts.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey. So, Meredith was talking about bringing Nathan over tonight.<eos> Bringing him home?<eos> - To our house? - Yeah.
No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I was curious.<eos> Also, I was in the hall. I figured I should move the big, giant, scary tumor or something.<eos> - I have a giant, scary tumor.<eos> - What?<eos> I stayed up all night studying it, and I think I solved it.<eos> Now you're telling me I could have solved it from the comfort of my own home, my own bedroom, my own bed...<eos> I want a giant, scary tumor. Get your own. I got to go see my patient.<eos> All night?
Okay.<eos> Move. Move!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - Oh! - You're okay. You're okay.<eos> How long had she been choking?<eos> I don't know... A... a few minutes... five?<eos> Page neuro. The baby's brain may have been deprived of oxygen for too long.<eos> Next time, call an ambulance.<eos> What?
Was that Dr. Hunt?<eos> Yes. Uh, we'd like to talk to him if we could.<eos> I'll, uh, tell him to come by.<eos> What was that about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey. What are you doing?<eos> Did you treat a choking baby this morning?<eos> What, are we not speaking now?<eos> Yes!<eos> Why?
Uh, we think this might belong to you.<eos> I think we found you a radiologist in training.<eos> Yeah, thanks. You're welcome.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> No, no. Thank you.<eos> No worries.<eos> That poor bloke is losing his mind.<eos> Yeah, some people just need a nanny.<eos> So, do you want to, um, come over for dinner tonight?<eos> What about the kids?
Yeah, some people just need a nanny.<eos> So, do you want to, um, come over for dinner tonight?<eos> What about the kids?<eos> With the kids.<eos> You seem to like kids. They seem to like you.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I mean, maybe I could bring something. Then you wouldn't have to cook.<eos> That's okay. I'll make something they like.<eos> After they go to bed, you can... Stay.<eos> Not all night, just... For a while.
It's okay. I got you. I got you, okay?<eos> - All right, lie back. - Okay. Just lie back.<eos> Relax as much as you can.<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I was in the hospital a... a lot.<eos> And, uh... they would have to... Ow!<eos> Ow! Oh, that's okay. I'm sorry.<eos> They would do a bunch of stuff that hurt me, too.<eos> And I hated it. I hated it.<eos> So, do you know what I would do?<eos> What?
And what would I have told Harriet? !<eos> - I'm fine, April!<eos> - Breathe.<eos> You know, Megan use to call me *** during *** so serious.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You can say it.<eos> - What?<eos> - She was right.<eos> Wouldn't war make anyone grumpy?<eos> Not her.
- Come back.<eos> No.<eos> No. Stephanie!<eos> Stephanie, come back.<eos> Stephanie...<eos> Please.<eos> Stephanie!<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I found him in O.R. 2.<eos> O.R. 2?
- Oh, yeah, I got it, I got it.<eos> You need to isolate the distal.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> Her BP's steady, sats are 96.<eos> Which means she's finally stable.<eos> Mm-hmm. She's gonna make it through this and keep the leg.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You got her back, Edwards. Now you need to get yourself back, okay?<eos> - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Gurney!
I'm... I was fine. I'm fine.<eos> It's just, you're gonna need to breathe.<eos> When I... when I tell you what I have to tell you, so... take a deep breath for me so I know that you can.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - What do you want to tell me?<eos> Take a deep breath for me.<eos> So...<eos> Remember the dream... where they come back to us?<eos> Derek forgets his keys, and Megan goes for...<eos> For coffee. Yeah.
- Hey. You're not going home?<eos> - Uh, nope. Incoming's two minutes out.<eos> Well, look, I just wanted to, um... say I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> I yelled at Jackson when I shouldn't have...<eos> Well, he was an idiot, and he almost died, so...<eos> I just meant that, you know...<eos> He's your baby's father, and I went too far.<eos> I was just mad because he and I had been talking earlier when the alarms went off...<eos> Maggie.<eos> What?
She said, "Dead bodies can't stay above ground.<eos> The air makes them sad."<eos> Yeah, actually, that's not a bad idea.<eos> What?<eos> A little show and tell?<eos> What if we put the bodies outside, use them as bait, see what shows up?<eos> You're a freaking genius. Yeah.<eos> Who's pointless now, bitch?<eos> You feeling better now?<eos> A little.
I don't know what I am.<eos> How Zen.<eos> No, um, no, I... I don't know.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I woke up in the mountains, and, uh... I couldn't even remember my name.<eos> I remember the dog, and...<eos> I remember the mist came and killed him, but, before all that...<eos> I remember nothing.<eos> What?
Can we go, too?<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, wait a minute.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We're moving.<eos> Guys, no, we need to stay together here.<eos> Well, why the hell do we have rules, if they don't apply to everybody?<eos> Come on. Look, this is for everyone's safety.<eos> Everyone?
Okay. Okay.<eos> Do whatever you want. Just don't come running for help when it all falls apart, okay?<eos> Repent, and let yourself be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<eos> Go therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father... and of the Son... and of the Holy Spirit.<eos> You okay?<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> Repeat after me.<eos> "I repent and baptize myself in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins."<eos> I repent and baptize myself in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.<eos> Again.
- I repent...<eos> - Good. Again.<eos> - I repent...<eos> - Will you be baptized?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you... be baptized?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Why? Why?<eos> Because I repent.<eos> Why?
- I can't go any faster!<eos> I'm gonna hit something.<eos> What if nobody's at the hospital?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> - Take him in the side. - They have power.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Watch out, get him...<eos> What is going on out there?<eos> Is anybody coming?<eos> The military?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> This is the living room.<eos> It's not done. This is where you'll work your magic.<eos> Yes, because I am the woman.<eos> Exactly. And in here...<eos> Think she'll like it?<eos> When did you do this?<eos> Yesterday. I said I was going to Mike's.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not just for this.
Who are you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What?<eos> At the hospital. Why are you here?<eos> What does it matter to you, faggot?<eos> Just being friendly.<eos> My mom had a panic attack when this thing came.<eos> Phones were dead, so I ran here for help.<eos> Guess I'm stuck here.<eos> What?
It's the endless cycle of life and death.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to talk about rats anymore.<eos> You're sure this is what we're meant to do?<eos> You're not here to question Her path.<eos> We're only survivors, just like the rats.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Shelley's dead.<eos> What?
Well, maybe three houses at a time is more conducive to our athletic prowess.<eos> Everything happened so fast.<eos> My dad... he came after me.<eos> Kevin... he jumped in the way.<eos> It was my idea to check on him.<eos> We shouldn't have even been there.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> And all I wanted to do after it happened was find you to make sure you were okay... because we're... we're family.<eos> Alex, we have to go.<eos> What?
You need to rest.<eos> There's a couch in the manager's office.<eos> Get some sleep, and I'll look for food.<eos> The door locks from the inside.<eos> You'll be safe.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I've got a gun.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Any sign of Alex? Eve?<eos> Anything?
You have to know that.<eos> I saw her.<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> Is that why you're lying?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Who the hell is this?<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - Lock them up.<eos> - Did you kill Jay, too?<eos> What?
You're probably wondering why we got all this shit up here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - It's Richard Nixon. - Yep.<eos> It's Richard.<eos> Sir Richard.<eos> Thirty-seventh President of the United States.<eos> Yep.<eos> - He was an asshole.<eos> - Yes, he was.<eos> - An asshole.
- Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - We'll smoke on it, figure it out.<eos> - We'll figure it out.<eos> You know the worst thing about working?<eos> - Coworkers. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - I guess you're kind of my coworker. - I guess I am kind of your coworker.<eos> But, nah, they're the worst, man, because we were writing on this TV show.<eos> - Shitty show.
"Man, he has 150 million reasons to take that contract."<eos> - I love... I like that.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - I want to do that.<eos> - We should start doing that.<eos> Fuck it. Why not?<eos> If he can do it, why can't we do it?<eos> - So, we started doing it. - Yeah.<eos> Our buddy Mookie asked us if we wanted to go to the titty bar.<eos> - Titty Tuesdays. - Titty Tuesdays.
I guess he's gone."<eos> But as we got older, we wanted to figure out what he did, so we did a little bit of research.<eos> We went to the Newark Public Library and found out that, in order to get 20 years in the state of New Jersey, you can do one of four things.<eos> Commit first-degree murder, second-degree murder, child molestation or tax evasion.<eos> So, we immediately got rid of tax evasion, right?<eos> The nigga was broke.<eos> He had no money.<eos> That left us with three choices.<eos> - All bad.<eos> - Terrible. Terrible choices.
- It's true. We did some research<eos> - with Henry Louis Gates...<eos> - These guys don't believe us.<eos> And Marcus Garvey.<eos> - We did some research. - They don't believe us.<eos> And look at this. Look at this shit.<eos> See that right there?<eos> Black happiness.<eos> Seventy-seven percent of it is white suffering.<eos> Now, 11 percent of it...
Solid.<eos> - Yes. - I mean, that's a solid team.<eos> - It's a great team.<eos> Who's gonna be on your team, though?<eos> Who are you gonna have?<eos> You gonna have Karl Malone, the Mailman?<eos> - You ain't gonna have...<eos> Shawn Kemp?<eos> - No. - You ain't have the Reign Man?<eos> - Mm-mm. - The Glove?
Who's gonna be on your team, though?<eos> Who are you gonna have?<eos> You gonna have Karl Malone, the Mailman?<eos> - You ain't gonna have...<eos> Shawn Kemp?<eos> - No. - You ain't have the Reign Man?<eos> - Mm-mm. - The Glove?<eos> - No.<eos> - Detlef Schrempf?<eos> - Stockton?
Never mind.<eos> Hey, what the hell is going on here?<eos> I did some research on this.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> Okay. "Without the War on Drugs, you probably don't get hip-hop."<eos> Moreover, without the crack epidemic which accelerated the War on Drugs, you certainly don't get gangsta rap.<eos> "And without gangsta rap, you don't get Biggie!"<eos> No Biggie?<eos> No Biggie.<eos> None of it.
Tell everyone you know.<eos> - Dope.<eos> [laughing] You gullible-ass niggers.<eos> I started it because I hate niggers, Jews and fairies!<eos> [laughing] - You almost had us there for a second. - He almost had us there for a second.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bye-bye, Nixon.<eos> - Bye, man. Peace, Nixon.<eos> Thanks for the War on Drugs.<eos> Thanks for the tour.
Rosaries around her wrists and feet.<eos> The only way to change history and to save Mom is to cut the tree at the trunk.<eos> He's gonna take her, and you are going to stop him.<eos> Hey. I hope this is okay.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> My home is your man cave, apparently.<eos> Well, Laurel came home from school Thursday and went "Sopranos" on the flat screen with a Wiffle ball bat, trying to kill a fly.<eos> I got a guy coming to fix it.<eos> When are they home from Grandma's? Tuesday.<eos> Full disclosure,
I brought him in to answer for that thing in Arizona with the checks?<eos> But I thought we were...<eos> Where's my attorney?<eos> Why has everything changed? What?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, but I do know this guy checks out.<eos> You can't let him leave.<eos> He hasn't committed a crime, Raim.<eos> We got nothing to hold him on.<eos> What about the body in the closet?<eos> - What body?
The big man's putting pressure. Wants us to keep him in custody while we make the case.<eos> Well, at least I'm not wanted for murder anymore, right?<eos> That's one small victory for the space-time continuum or whatever the hell this is.<eos> His wife's body isn't in the closet anymore.<eos> You sure? We searched it this afternoon.<eos> Trust me, I looked like a crazy person.<eos> Except to the Deacon.<eos> He knows I know.<eos> Okay, so, uh... so what do you think made him move it?<eos> You, probably.
- Jules. - And first, you stab him in the back to protect Stan Moreno.<eos> And now you're here, snooping around like he's got something to hide.<eos> Come on.<eos> He deserves more.<eos> Garage is unlocked. Go ahead and take a look if you want.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Just talking with Jules, catching up.<eos> Yeah, about what?<eos> He wants to have a look in the garage.<eos> - Oh, yeah, what for?
The Ogres... they'll kill us.<eos> We're the only things standing between those monsters and home.<eos> If we run, they'll kill everyone.<eos> How can we possibly win?<eos> This blade... it's called Hrunting.<eos> It was enchanted with light magic to ensure that whoever carries it into battle will be hailed a hero.<eos> So, you can either be remembered as a hero or forever known as the coward who ran on the eve of victory.<eos> All right, Beowulf.<eos> I'll fight.<eos> To victory!
You're right, Bae.<eos> You're right.<eos> Now, here.<eos> Drink your tea.<eos> What's in this, Papa?<eos> It tastes strange.<eos> Memory potion.<eos> I won't let you follow me into the darkness, Bae.<eos> One of us has to be strong.<eos> Wha...?
I won't let you follow me into the darkness, Bae.<eos> One of us has to be strong.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Papa, Papa, where are we?<eos> How... How did we get out of the cave?<eos> You bumped your head.<eos> It must have been harder than I thought.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> Beowulf won't be bothering us anymore.<eos> What?
No. I'm here to return Queen Cobra before the Charmings realize she's missing.<eos> And maybe to... apologize.<eos> I shouldn't have gone behind your back and helped Robin escape.<eos> No. This one's my fault.<eos> Your fault?<eos> Okay. Let's go with that, then.<eos> How did I ever think that removing my evil half would change anything?<eos> When I saw Robin in that alternate world, it was a test... to see if I could move forward, and I failed.<eos> Well, I thought I was rid of you for good, Queenie, but I guess I'll always be paying the price for what you did... what I did.<eos> What?
So, Ethan gets the property, and the cop investigating him goes away.<eos> Which gives him motive.<eos> Ethan was arrested, but the charges were dropped.<eos> A cop was murdered, and it just went away?<eos> Do you think he paid people off?<eos> That's what we're gonna find out.<eos> Ethan didn't do this.<eos> How do you know that, Ms. Vaughan?<eos> Because I was with him last night.<eos> - All night?
Uh... Stefan, Miguel, Fernando.<eos> Fernando... He's ambitious.<eos> Send him.<eos> Yes, Mum?<eos> Darling, I-I don't mean to meddle, but...<eos> Do we have any more of those butter biscuits?<eos> I've eaten all mine.<eos> Ooh, those are lovely ones, aren't they?<eos> I think they're right here.<eos> Yes. For God's sake.
Actually, that's not a bad idea.<eos> That's enough!<eos> This is not a democracy.<eos> You two, get out.<eos> Alfie, send Fernando.<eos> The rest of you, turn to page three.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Hey. So, that cop who got killed... Detective Mason.<eos> Did you know he had a substance-abuse issue?<eos> What?
- Allie...<eos> - She's a killer.<eos> She's mini Margot.<eos> Well, she's also 15.<eos> You remember what you were like at 15, don't you?<eos> Hormonal, yes.<eos> Homicidal, no.<eos> Well, then you're lucky.<eos> I was 13 when I got my first gun.<eos> What?
What if he killed that cop?<eos> We could find out... with your help.<eos> You want me to spy on him?<eos> He started it.<eos> If we're going to prove that Blackwell was behind the FBI breach, then we need to go after the woman who ordered it.<eos> Donna Kane, C.E.O.<eos> She founded the company 15 years ago after a two-and-a-half-decade stint in the Marines.<eos> I do love a woman in uniform.<eos> Perhaps I could charm her with my...<eos> Hard-core lesbian.
There's only one way to find out.<eos> Welcome to Blackwell.<eos> Ms. Kane's office is right this way.<eos> Mr. Nye, it's a pleasure.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Kane.<eos> This is my associate, Corina Lopez.<eos> Thank you for taking the time.<eos> I have the contract all ready for you to sign.<eos> Before I sign, we have some concerns.<eos> - Such as?
Except, this is not a data center.<eos> This is someone's room.<eos> Who the bloody hell are you?<eos> I'm Troy, and you're Special Agent Diaz in charge of Rhys Spencer Griffiths, former head of the Kensington Firm.<eos> And now a confidential informant with Benjamin Jones.<eos> Shut it!<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> He's seen our files.<eos> Where's the information being stored?<eos> - What information?
He knows everything about us.<eos> And he's so pretty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't think we're gonna have to worry about Blackwell.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because if Troy knows everything about us, then he probably knows everything about Blackwell.<eos> I know a lot.<eos> Enough to shut them down and put Donna Kane away for good?<eos> How fast can you guys type?<eos> To family.
This is what kept your boyfriend from spending the rest of his life in jail.<eos> Hey, babe?<eos> Do you know where my...<eos> No, that won't be necessary.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Who was that?<eos> That was Detective Anderson.<eos> She and her partner would like me to come down to the station, answer a few questions.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> What?
- You were always thinking about yourself and protecting yourself.<eos> Yeah, because you sure as hell weren't gonna protect me.<eos> You hired somebody to spy on me, to follow me around!<eos> Yes, and I was right to!<eos> Because you're weak and you are selfish, and you are incapable of thinking of anything or anyone other than Alice Vaughan.<eos> And I knew that about you, the whole time.<eos> And I still loved you.<eos> What's this?<eos> Steve Mason wasn't murdered.<eos> What?
And I still loved you.<eos> What's this?<eos> Steve Mason wasn't murdered.<eos> What?<eos> He killed himself.<eos> That's his suicide note.<eos> He was struggling to make ends meet.<eos> He knew his family would collect if he was killed in the line of duty, so he set the fire.<eos> How'd you get this?<eos> Through Captain Dixon.
You don't owe me anything.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I owe you everything.<eos> I came to Los Angeles with nothing, and you changed my life.<eos> And I was wrong.<eos> About what?<eos> I was recently asked to look into the murder of Detective Mason.<eos> - Come on, Allie.<eos> - He killed himself.<eos> What?
And I was wrong.<eos> About what?<eos> I was recently asked to look into the murder of Detective Mason.<eos> - Come on, Allie.<eos> - He killed himself.<eos> What?<eos> Mason left his wife a note.<eos> He set the fire so his family could...<eos> Anyway, the point is... that I'm so sorry.<eos> Beyond.
He is hot.<eos> Can we keep him?<eos> It's not enough that I have a child?<eos> You have to have one, too?<eos> - Where's he going?<eos> - Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> You'll wake the baby.<eos> I'm gonna have to wake him anyway when I arrest him.<eos> Arrest him?<eos> For what?
He helped us.<eos> He know who we are.<eos> He knows everything about us.<eos> The feds are gonna lock him up either way.<eos> Then let me go. Please.<eos> Troy, I... I'll talk to the feds.<eos> We'll work out a deal.<eos> It's going to be fine.<eos> What if I could tell you where your husband is?<eos> What?
How about... a family dinner?<eos> Mm. You, me, Tessa, and Margot.<eos> Just you, me, and Tessa.<eos> I can cook.<eos> Babe, she might enjoy having some time alone with her dad without her wicked stepmother.<eos> Have you seen "Cinderella"?<eos> Yeah, that chic was cold.<eos> You are perfect.<eos> I'm really not.<eos> What?
I'm sorry. We left them in the van.<eos> You mind if I take a quick look in your bag?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Emergency response.<eos> This is Officer Angela Rose,<eos> Bailey Merchants Bank, 831647th Street.<eos> Everybody out of your offices now!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - On the floor.
Go! Go!<eos> Go!<eos> - Okay!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Drop that phone now!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Come on!<eos> 12 hostages.<eos> Police units are on their way.<eos> - Cellphones.
- Okay!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Drop that phone now!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Come on!<eos> 12 hostages.<eos> Police units are on their way.<eos> - Cellphones.<eos> - Cellphones!<eos> - Cellphones.
Zara Hallam.<eos> How are Mike and the kids?<eos> Oh, good!<eos> Or so I'm told.<eos> Oh, I hear that.<eos> Eric Beaumont, Commander Nina Sellars, an old friend of mine.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> It's an honor, Mr. Beaumont, but I'm afraid there isn't much for you to do here.<eos> You still haven't made contact with the hostage takers.<eos> Zip.
They operate on different frequencies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> It's awful tight.<eos> Yeah, that's the idea.<eos> Hands.<eos> I've got to do this.<eos> Now. Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> On the ground.
- Get her to lift that jammer.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We need that dedicated signal.<eos> Okay, what do we know about the security guard, Angela Rose?<eos> Well, at 8 years old, she lost her mother to cancer.<eos> Father was a cop, died last year.<eos> Graduated from City College with a B.A. in English.<eos> Unmarried, two dogs.<eos> How long has she been a security guard?<eos> Three years.
That strategy sounds high-risk.<eos> It's the only one available to us. Taxi!<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> They've determined the robbers are drilling the safe-deposit boxes looking for something.<eos> Oh?<eos> He needs to know who rents those boxes.<eos> Confidentiality and... and discretion are vital to our clients.<eos> More vital than saving lives?<eos> Let me see what I can do.<eos> What?
Look him in the eye.<eos> Make him feel like you're on his side.<eos> But I'm not on their side.<eos> I don't think she's cut out for this.<eos> Okay.<eos> You and me...<eos> we're gonna do this together.<eos> Okay, Angie?<eos> You just need to remember they wanna get out of there just like you do.<eos> What?
You tell SWAT to hold their positions.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Thank you... both of you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> There's your list.<eos> That was fast.<eos> Doesn't say what's in those safe deposit boxes... just the names of everyone who's rented one.<eos> Gracias.<eos> And ha ha, by the way.<eos> Ha ha what?
A shift in latency, rise in the pitch of a voice... those are signs of discomfort with the situation, aren't they?<eos> Why do you ask, Ms. Carlson?<eos> Because Ms. Bloom's voice did both those things when Ms. Denard asked her for the list of names.<eos> I noticed it too, but that's not surprising, is it?<eos> She's under a lot of pressure.<eos> Our ex-cop, Grimes... he went to prison for taking bribes from a meth dealer.<eos> That's right.<eos> Is there anything else on his rap sheet?<eos> Uh, got commendations in '06 and '07, and...<eos> What?
You seem pretty real to me.<eos> I dropped out of the academy because I get panic attacks.<eos> There's nothing wrong with being afraid, Angie.<eos> It's what you do with your fear that matters.<eos> You're a professional negotiator?<eos> I am.<eos> How many cases you negotiated?<eos> Thousands.<eos> You lose any?<eos> One.
But Commissioner Fletcher was his superior officer at the time and on duty that night.<eos> We think Fletcher shot that kid and made Grimes take the fall.<eos> The missing tape would prove it.<eos> That's quite a valuable tape.<eos> Ms. Bloom may have been using it all these years to blackmail Commissioner Fletcher... special treatment.<eos> And now that Grimes is out of prison, he figures he can blackmail both of them.<eos> No surprise Grimes thought he could take all these hostages and still walk away.<eos> With that tape, he's got Fletcher in his back pocket.<eos> Grimes is calling back.<eos> Show time.
And now that Grimes is out of prison, he figures he can blackmail both of them.<eos> No surprise Grimes thought he could take all these hostages and still walk away.<eos> With that tape, he's got Fletcher in his back pocket.<eos> Grimes is calling back.<eos> Show time.<eos> All right, here's the deal.<eos> We need safe passage to Teterboro with a plane waiting.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to guarantee the safety of those hostages, Teddy.<eos> One more condition...
Can you hear me?<eos> I hear a voice.<eos> The Djinn summons him.<eos> I know where Alex is.<eos> Are you certain this is the place.<eos> Yeah. I know what I saw.<eos> Might be right.<eos> I think I saw this place on a list of Dreyfuss's holdings.<eos> They're gonna turn it into a server farm.<eos> What farm?
Yours are something else.<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> And Brakebills continues its tradition of fucking my shit.<eos> There's nothing we can do here.<eos> There are other options.<eos> One, I send you to someone who may know more.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is it? Professor Mayakovsky.<eos> The drunk perv in the igloo?<eos> Pass.
Where's Quentin?<eos> So we finally get to the cashier and guess what.<eos> - Hmm? - I left my wallet in the car.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> - Talk about bad timing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, does Donut House, does that taste like donuts?<eos> I just use that thing for soup.<eos> Soup?<eos> What the fuck?
That rabbit knows if you're--<eos> - Pregnant. - Okay, okay.<eos> - You're not smiling.<eos> - I'm sorry. - It's just--you see--<eos> - Pregnant.<eos> Okay, rabbit!<eos> Chill.<eos> Ah, ah! Where do you think you're going?<eos> It may suck all the moisture from my tongue, but damned if I'm not going to toast to this shit.<eos> To our violently attractive progeny.
- Ms. Wicker.<eos> - Uh, Julia.<eos> The test was positive.<eos> If you'd like, we can discuss your options.<eos> - I want an abortion.<eos> - Okay. That's something that we can perform here in office.<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, today?<eos> Unfortunately, we do have a waiting list, but it should just be a couple of days.<eos> Days?
Unless getting kicked out of a fivesome counts.<eos> - First for me.<eos> - Same. I'm thinking we should probably bone up.<eos> Like, study?<eos> I'll grab what I can from the Brakebills Library.<eos> Fine.<eos> And grab some Adderall while you're there.<eos> Okay, I'm done.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> What?
What about it?<eos> You make it sawdust.<eos> Do not worry.<eos> I give you tool.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I'm just finishing up.<eos> Gonna jerk it?<eos> - Break in the office?<eos> - No.
You came to Brakebills only to ease your suffering.<eos> The voices.<eos> It was all chore and burden.<eos> But you saved yourself, traveler.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe you're simply done.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Why?<eos> Chance at what?
Remarkably like that.<eos> Incorporate bond.<eos> Even I cannot break.<eos> Why?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I'm not drunk enough to talk about it.<eos> Okay!<eos> I make love to many students.<eos> And then I fucked the wrong one.<eos> Oops.
Last night was...<eos> It felt really good, and it was... Probably exactly what I needed, but I...<eos> It was also really weird and sad and I feel awful.<eos> I feel worse than before.<eos> Apologies for my terrible life.<eos> I just don't wanna use magic like that.<eos> I'm sorry for everything you lost.<eos> I'll see you at work.<eos> It is after much deliberation that I have decided... we will not execute the prisoner.<eos> What?
- Stop it!<eos> Wait!<eos> - I can't. Stop!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No! Kady!<eos> Kady!<eos> Kady!<eos> - I can't...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Holy fuck. Oh, my--
-I'm going!<eos> Yes!<eos> As of today, all your clients belong to us.<eos> Your dad wanted me to deliver a message.<eos> Thelatest pollnumbersin Seattle's mayoralraceshow districtattorney Floydbaracustrailing by10points...<eos> What... what happened to you?<eos> Two requests. Say yes to both or i blow your brains out.<eos> First, you're gonna show me where your new brain suppliers are headquartered.<eos> I can do that.<eos> What else?
No PTSD.<eos> What it shows me is you're the same major who went to qumar.<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> The same major?<eos> Actually, I came back more committed than ever.<eos> I love it!<eos> I want to shake your hand, soldier.<eos> I hope this isn't too personal, but...<eos> Is that a human pulse I'm feeling or are you just happy to see me?<eos> What?
Laugh the pain away.<eos> That's what Finn always said, huh?<eos> He was balls to the wall, man.<eos> -To Finn. -You can't drink in here.<eos> -Boo. -Lame, man.<eos> I need you guys to focus up.<eos> Is there anybody you know who might have had it out for your pal Finn?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> We piss off a lot of folks.<eos> -Like who? -Everyone.
-Rudy! No,no,no .<eos> Thiscan'tbe happening.<eos> -Rudy,baby,don'tfreakout! -Yes! Boohoo,Rudypooh!<eos> Whatthehell iswrongwithyou ?<eos> You'vegottahaveeverything? -Areyoufilmingthis?<eos> -Whoa. You'resick,dude.<eos> You'rea sickman!<eos> There'sa hiddencamera? Idon'tbelieveyou !<eos> Youcanhave anyone,man.<eos> Whyher ?
All right.<eos> All right.<eos> So what do we have in store?<eos> Buckle up, my friend.<eos> We're gonna take this night to the next level.<eos> Where do we get our hands on some super Max?<eos> Are you ready for this?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> My mom never let me play with these.<eos> Too dangerous.
Settle down?<eos> You got knocked up by some rich guy when you were working as a stripper.<eos> I was waitress at a strip club.<eos> You were a topless waitress.<eos> Okay. And that's even worse, it just means you couldn't dance. Hey!<eos> I am a great dancer.<eos> FBI!<eos> We have a warrant for the arrest of Christopher and Pamela Pemberton for fraud.<eos> ...checks the runner at first.<eos> What?
Go out on the front line, right?<eos> Chain yourself to a redwood, light yourself on fire.<eos> Just not tonight, understood?<eos> I'm sorry, were you saying something?<eos> I was distracted by how uneven your eyebrows are.<eos> My Uber's here, so I'm out.<eos> I'll be home whenever.<eos> Cool.<eos> What are you drinking?<eos> Oh, just some absinthe.
But you see, there are two problems.<eos> You're not.<eos> And you can't.<eos> Peace out, Mackenzie.<eos> Something the matter?<eos> No, I'm good, I just felt kind of funny for a second.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Funny how?<eos> Funny like you just drank six different types of sleep medication funny?<eos> What?
Sometimes that makes my tummy feel better.<eos> I have not. But I will definitely take that into consideration.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, hey, Ben, you hungry?<eos> You, uh, feeling like having some ice cream?<eos> I can't. My mom says I'm allergic.<eos> Yeah, well, I got news for you, pal.<eos> Your mom is just projecting her own eating disorders onto you.<eos> What's projecting?<eos> Great question.
It was humongous!<eos> I'm lucky he didn't beat me with it.<eos> I... uh, go put a steak on your face or something, I don't know.<eos> Sabrina, can you please try and think for a second?<eos> You're the one who told me to get out on the front lines.<eos> Well, I don't... I give terrible advice!<eos> - Everybody knows that.<eos> - Look at me! I'm grotesque.<eos> - I'm gonna sue his ass.<eos> - For what?
What do you want?<eos> Just checking in.<eos> You don't strike me as much of a cook,<eos> - Oh, you are so, so sweet.<eos> Oh! Shoot.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Oh, my, what did you - do to him?<eos> - No. I didn't do that.<eos> He got pounded at school for checking out some kid's wiener.<eos> Because of you!
Why don't we step outside until we figure this out?<eos> You are not even a real cop.<eos> You've got a cloth badge.<eos> Don't make me detain you.<eos> With what?<eos> You have no gun.<eos> No, I have a Taser.<eos> Bitch, I hope you brought two, 'cause Mama's got a real high tolerance.<eos> Okay. Here we go.<eos> Oh, no!
This is awesome, right, guys?<eos> Why are we in a poor person's restaurant?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> It's not a poor person's restaurant... don't be an ass.<eos> This guy's not even Japanese.<eos> His name's Pedro.<eos> All right, well, Hamilton wasn't Puerto Rican, but people seem to be enjoying that just fine.<eos> All right, listen, I brought you guys here because I, I got to tell you some pretty big news, and it's not...<eos> - Pass.<eos> - Pass?
You're excused.<eos> A little hustle, please.<eos> The colonel's waiting.<eos> So what?<eos> So show some respect.<eos> He's a freaking war hero.<eos> Dude went buck wild on Korea.<eos> Look at this beast.<eos> If there was ever a guy to surrender the patriarch role to, it's this stud.<eos> What?
Hello, Grandma.<eos> Now, it has been a long day, so why don't we all go upstairs and change into our PJs?<eos> Yeah, sorry, Grandma, that's not gonna work for me.<eos> I've got a party to go to tonight.<eos> And I probably won't get home until late, so, you know what, don't wait up for me.<eos> I realize you children aren't used to having rules, but all that's going to change.<eos> Now, be a good girl and do as Grandma says.<eos> No.<eos> I think you'll find I have very little tolerance for back sass, dear.<eos> Upstairs.
So, of course, I'm trying to convince him it was just a rash, - but, you know, he wasn't buying it.<eos> You know, when I was a little girl, a rash spread through our village and nearly took all of the women.<eos> Right on. - Yeah.<eos> Very cool that we both have rash stories.<eos> So, this is it.<eos> Home, sweet home.<eos> Oh, yeah, I live real close to the airport.<eos> Super convenient.<eos> Thirsty?<eos> Yeah. - Cheers. - Oh.
Right on. - Yeah.<eos> Very cool that we both have rash stories.<eos> So, this is it.<eos> Home, sweet home.<eos> Oh, yeah, I live real close to the airport.<eos> Super convenient.<eos> Thirsty?<eos> Yeah. - Cheers. - Oh.<eos> - Mm, mm. - There we go.<eos> Cheers.
I popped one in your beer earlier.<eos> Uh... no, y-you're joking.<eos> This is a joke, right?<eos> - Of course I'm joking! - Oh.<eos> Who would do that? - Oh...<eos> I can't tell, I can't tell.<eos> - I know.<eos> Actually, I'm joking about joking.<eos> I'd say you have about ten minutes. Wha...?<eos> Oh.
Great. That was a lot of info there.<eos> - Thank you so much. - Yeah. Mm.<eos> Whoa-whoa! That's not what you want to gulp.<eos> - Mm-mm. Mm. - No... no guzzling.<eos> All right, that's on you.<eos> Do you want to go dance?<eos> Yeah, lead the way, bitch!<eos> We're gonna die!<eos> - What?<eos> What?
Chip, from now on, you'll be the colonel's apprentice.<eos> You can start by cutting his food into little pieces and feeding him.<eos> Doesn't he have a nurse for that?<eos> He does.<eos> You. And, uh, little Miss Rosemary Kennedy here will learn to behave like a lady, or she will suffer the consequences.<eos> Yes, Grandma.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to enjoy my coffee.<eos> What?
Yeah, if it's not broke, you don't fix it.<eos> Oh, what's the name of the clown that everyone got growing up?<eos> - Sully?<eos> ‭ - Yeah. Sully the Clown!<eos> That guy's the best.<eos> What, a clown? Sounds pretty lame.<eos> No, not this guy.<eos> He's like the Mick Jagger of clowns.<eos> We find somebody half as good as Sully, we are in business.<eos> - One more time.
I thought we agreed I'm the boss.<eos> No, if you saw my silence as agreeing with you, that's on you.<eos> Well, what happened to keeping it basic?<eos> We did. We basically threw the best party ever.<eos> - Too bad Ben couldn't care less about it. ‭<eos> - What?<eos> Come on, he's surrounded by ten grand in gourmet candy, and he's eating crayons?<eos> Yeah, well, don't take it personally, his heart just isn't for sale.<eos> - Sully in the house!<eos> - What?
Oh, oh, easy now.<eos> - Where are the brakes on this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I'm just the delivery guy.<eos> - What?<eos> No, where you going?<eos> Don't leave!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Sabrina, help!<eos> 'Sup.
You got it. Just, uh, give me ten minutes and we'll light this place up.<eos> yeah, Light it up.<eos> but did you not just hear me?<eos> I said this is it, it's showtime.<eos> Oh, I heard you, but I got to bang out my pre-show ritual first.<eos> Where's your green room?<eos> Oh, no, man, this is a home, so we-we don't have a green room, but you should do whatever you need to do.<eos> Well, what other kind of rooms do you have?<eos> For you?<eos> The bathroom.
I'm calling an audible, I'm going in manually, okay?<eos> Ben, listen close.<eos> What I'm about to do is gonna suck.<eos> You're gonna hate it and that's okay.<eos> Sometimes we hate things, you understand?<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> - What are you--<eos> - There we go.<eos> Do you-- do you know what you're doing? I'm pulling the trigger!<eos> All right?
Okay, Ben, listen.<eos> Party's over, okay?<eos> Your Aunt Mickey screwed up. I screwed up and, um, we're gonna have to take a little ride.<eos> But we haven't even had cake yet.<eos> he's right, Mick.<eos> It's not a party unless you have cake.<eos> Okay, we'll do cake first.<eos> We'll do cake first. We'll do cake before the drive and we'll make a good memory.<eos> It's the least we can do before we send him off into the system.<eos> Happy birthday... Cake!

Do you have any idea how poisonous that stuff is?<eos> How is birth control poison, Sabrina?<eos> It destroys your body and causes crazy mood swings.<eos> So do babies!<eos> Why do you all of a sudden care what...?<eos> I get it.<eos> Get what?<eos> You're jealous.<eos> I'm jealous? - Yeah.<eos> - What, of you?
What do you care what I do with my body?<eos> You're not my mom.<eos> Honey, as far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm here, I have two jobs:<eos> make sure nobody dies or winds up pregnant.<eos> No deaths, no births.<eos> Is what you're doing even legal?<eos> You're 17!<eos> What is he, like 30?<eos> Actually, the age of consent in Connecticut is 16.<eos> What?
I'll figure it out, okay.<eos> I don't want to hear about your nipples anymore.<eos> - Are we cool on that?<eos> - Yeah, we're good. We're good.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> - But we got to keep her from seeing him.<eos> No, that's the classic thing.<eos> If we forbid her to see him, she's just going to want him more.<eos> We got to make her break up with him.<eos> - What?
Oh, my God, it was so hard.<eos> It's like, are we in algebra or, like, the freakin' space program?<eos> Like, "Earth to algebra, nobody likes you."<eos> So cool, cool... chill.<eos> Um, well, I just, like, think you're really, really pretty and, like, super cool, and I like hanging out with you and stuff.<eos> And, like, you're super freakin' chill and, like, all that good stuff.<eos> Chip, you don't have to be so nervous.<eos> You can just ask.<eos> Well, I was just wondering if I... - I could pay you $500 to make out with me?<eos> - What?
I don't know. What's wrong with you?<eos> - You look horrible.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Well, I've been sick all day.<eos> I don't know. I think I got to stop drinking on school nights, you know?<eos> - Or maybe you have a baby inside you.<eos> Well, that's not possible 'cause she's using condoms, right?<eos> - Right. Yeah, of course.<eos> - Yeah, I'm just saying, maybe you want to take one of the pregnancy tests in Poodle's bathroom, you know, just to be sure.<eos> She's got a good point. It couldn't hurt.<eos> Oh, uh-oh.
It's kind of the same thing.<eos> ♪ Sabrina's getting married ♪<eos> Wait...<eos> Sabrina's getting married?<eos> Okay, what the hell's going on with this one?<eos> I'm happy and sad... and mad.<eos> Come on, Ben, what's going on with you, buddy?<eos> I'm just a big, fat, no-talent loser.<eos> Even your magic pills couldn't help.<eos> - What magic pills?
Damn.<eos> She's unbelievable.<eos> That picture comes to us from the legendary robby ragosa, Who's playing d1 At virginia, smokin' goals<eos> Wait, why is there no face on mine?<eos> There's no face on any of 'em, doof.<eos> It's a freakin' sext.<eos> Look at that body.<eos> And, oh, that tattoo.<eos> It's like a... It's like a freakin'...<eos> Unicorn.
Off to a creepy start.<eos> Then principal gibbons just pops out of nowhere And busts me.<eos> Now i have to go in front Of the honor board and tell 'em who else was involved.<eos> What's an honor board?<eos> Why don't you ask her?<eos> it's a committee of students and teachers That handle disciplinary matters.<eos> Sounds like a committee of narcs and rats That handle snitching matters.<eos> I'm not a rat, okay?<eos> It just looks really good On your college applications.<eos> Uh-oh.
This guy was... Okay.<eos> I do not have time for this.<eos> No... Well, i'm coming back around to the snitching thing.<eos> I have a lunch meeting<eos> That i'm late for.<eos> I'm saying he was a hot senior.<eos> It took me Many years to get him in the sack.<eos> I will see you at chip's hearing.<eos> Hey, chip, do you believe in god?<eos> What?
I'm gonna have to go public with this.<eos> It's a little machine, and you stick it into your computer.<eos> Yeah, i know what it is.<eos> Oh, it's your entire hard drive.<eos> And i've got a feeling It's not all that honorable.<eos> oh. Oh, i was right.<eos> I want you to listen to me right now.<eos> I own you.<eos> Yeah... You were just gonna snitch on me.<eos> What?
Get away from my client.<eos> Is that mom's suit?<eos> Used to be mom's suit, now it's my suit.<eos> Oh, your breath reeks of booze.<eos> Oh, does it?<eos> Yeah. You gonna go tell on me, donnie brasco?<eos> Get the hell out of here.<eos> ugh. Hope you have a plan.<eos> Yeah, i'll pop 'em in or something.<eos> For the hearing! Oh, yeah.
The shark movie?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah. You seen it recently?<eos> Ugh.<eos> No, no. Totally holds up.<eos> Hey, you ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You ready?<eos> You ready for this. All right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?
They did it! Not me!<eos> Gone!<eos> It was stewart.<eos> No, no, it was pierce.<eos> I want them out of here!<eos> Screw you, dude.<eos> Get them! I didn't do it!<eos> Leave!<eos> That minivans are for soccer moms and pedophiles.<eos> No, the other thing.
Don't go to a neighbor and ask for stuff, okay?<eos> Deal?<eos> - Deal.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Now, come on, give me a hug.<eos> Then get out of here, okay?<eos> See ya.<eos> Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa. Get back here.<eos> Turn around.<eos> What?
- You are so weak.<eos> - You're one to talk.<eos> Me?<eos> No! This?<eos> That's nothing.<eos> That's, like, there was one left.<eos> I didn't want it just hanging out - Sure.<eos> - on my dresser, mocking me.<eos> "Sure."<eos> Wha...?
Now, just keep your feet on the pedals. All right?<eos> Hey, you're doing fine.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> Whoa, no, no, no!<eos> Slow down!<eos> Slow down!<eos> Oh, no! Oh, no!<eos> Oh, I think I killed him!<eos> I killed him!<eos> Oh, no!
What's happening?<eos> Guesthouse caught fire last night.<eos> You don't think that we...<eos> No, yeah, I do think that we.<eos> We flicked, like, 20 butts over the fence.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Just the person I wanted to see.<eos> Hey, what's up, Liz?<eos> What's going on? That sociopath nephew of yours just burned down my guesthouse.<eos> What?
Well, that's his imaginary friend.<eos> You know, totally normal, healthy, sane.<eos> Can I talk to Omicron?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> He doesn't like people.<eos> Yeah, he doesn't like people. Uh, me neither.<eos> What does he think of your neighbor?<eos> Let's just say he's not gonna be happy when he finds out she got me in trouble.<eos> "I'll tear the heart out of that woman if she messes with you, Ben."<eos> Kids.
What happened to the patch?<eos> - I love the patch.<eos> - Wha...?<eos> This combined with the cigarettes is a whole new ball game.<eos> Oh, yeah, the patch is rad, Alba.<eos> Guess what I did with mine.<eos> I slapped it under the pits.<eos> - Aw, come on. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, direct line right to the bloodstream.<eos> - Smart. - Yeah.
Anything that gets in our way.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> You find yourself in quite the predicament.<eos> Confess and Ben goes free while you spend your life in chains, or stay silent and betray an innocent boy.<eos> Yeah, we get what's going on...<eos> We just explained it to you.<eos> Well, seems there's only one solution.<eos> Un vagabundo.<eos> A... what?
Is he normally this sweaty?<eos> I don't think it's normal for anyone To be this sweaty.<eos> Ah. Okay.<eos> First off, i had zero knowledge Of what was going on with your parents' finances.<eos> Aren't you their money manager?<eos> I know, right?<eos> I mean, It doesn't feel great to be left out.<eos> It didn't help that i found out About the fiasco from the ny insider column At my therapist's office.<eos> what?
I'm just getting started.<eos> Huh. Jackie gilford<eos> Had her housekeeper deported Because she didn't want to fire her.<eos> Oh, and caroline martin--<eos> She used all the money from her 9/11 charity fund To fix that face.<eos> and not that It's worthy of an article, But that purebred goldendoodle she won't shut up about?<eos> Rescue.<eos> So, you know, As you can see, there are plenty of stories here That are far juicier than my family.<eos> girl, you are the story.<eos> what?
I could've got some of our glory back. Mm.<eos> I get it.<eos> Look, all you got to do is change the conversation.<eos> So how do i, um... How do i change the conversation?<eos> Well, you could tell everybody You tackled a school shooter.<eos> That could be nice. Nah, nah.<eos> You know what,<eos> An injury is always the safest bet.<eos> You take a line drive to the sternum right now, That's all they'll remember.<eos> Tax fraud who?
And then... The coup de grÃ¢ce.<eos> The most precise and intricate part of our plan.<eos> between the heat, The smell, and the crying,<eos> Oliver's left with only one option.<eos> Really?<eos> This now?<eos> Ugh.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Is that poop?<eos> What?
between the heat, The smell, and the crying,<eos> Oliver's left with only one option.<eos> Really?<eos> This now?<eos> Ugh.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Is that poop?<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> What?
Well, thank you.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> Just get me your aunt's phone number, we'll be even, huh?<eos> Done.<eos> And here he comes in three, two...<eos> And he will be walking through that door in three, two...<eos> Where is he?<eos> Ugh.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Oh, no.
Definitely.<eos> Innocent lives be damned.<eos> No.<eos> No. No, no, not-not innocent.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Unless you think you... have lived an innocent life...<eos> Ichabod.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Dreyfuss, but we have a situation.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> DREYFUSS:
Unless you think you... have lived an innocent life...<eos> Ichabod.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Dreyfuss, but we have a situation.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> DREYFUSS:<eos> What? What, what, what?<eos> We've had a breach.<eos> He disabled the security protocols and gained entrance.<eos> He disabled the secur...<eos> my security... protocol?
I've often wondered wh-what it was about that particular moment.<eos> Were those woods in some sort of mystically charged area or something?<eos> That night I made a request.<eos> And I got an answer.<eos> No.<eos> It wasn't a dream.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A messenger.<eos> This is a c... c-contract?<eos> For what?
More tricks and games.<eos> That comes to an end now.<eos> Tell me where the last piece is.<eos> Graupha keph pai!<eos> Machis nach med tal!<eos> I'm all right, all right.<eos> Crane!<eos> The Greek fire.<eos> There are other paths to eternity.<eos> Nice throw.
That comes to an end now.<eos> Tell me where the last piece is.<eos> Graupha keph pai!<eos> Machis nach med tal!<eos> I'm all right, all right.<eos> Crane!<eos> The Greek fire.<eos> There are other paths to eternity.<eos> Nice throw.<eos> Nice catch.
Spots where the mystical energies peak.<eos> Wait.<eos> Pull up a, uh, current GPS map of the D.C. area.<eos> This is the Lincoln Memorial.<eos> And this is where we found the Dyer House.<eos> George Washington hid the Philosopher's Stone pieces on the strongest ley line intersections.<eos> Presumably, that's where we'll find the last piece.<eos> Whoa. Intense.<eos> Of course.<eos> What?
The fact that the last Talisman piece disappeared along with him makes a case for the culprit.<eos> Yeah, your friend and mine, Malcolm Dreyfuss.<eos> No, we were ahead for a minute.<eos> Looks like we just lost our lead.<eos> Hey, not for lack of trying.<eos> You did good.<eos> - Both of you.<eos> - Damn straight.<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> For better or worse.
Why have I not been to see you more often?<eos> Well, you always pushed me to try new things... so I've moved to Washington, D.C.<eos> I have a new apartment, new compatriots... new friends.<eos> Miss Jenny is with me, of course... as are you... always.<eos> So, I thought you might like to know that whilst I miss you terribly... I'm not alone.<eos> Until next we meet.<eos> I found a merchant on Main Street selling these.<eos> A Headless bobblehead.<eos> Wonders never cease.<eos> To absent friends.
I will decide what my daughter can and can't handle.<eos> Our daughter.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Uh, look, let's try this again.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's good to see you, Dee.<eos> I can't believe how big she's gotten.<eos> That's what kids do, they grow up.<eos> Yeah, I've been meaning to check in more.<eos> Two years.
And when I got pregnant, I decided I needed to go back to civilian life.<eos> Mitch and I weren't exactly an option.<eos> He helps out financially.<eos> Calls, when he remembers.<eos> That's how it's always been.<eos> I'm fine with it.<eos> And is Molly "fine with it"?<eos> Of course.<eos> Good.<eos> What?
Young girls.<eos> Same markings.<eos> Though the time of deaths predate our victim.<eos> The second was killed near Philly a day ago.<eos> The first was discovered... outside Sleepy Hollow.<eos> So, you think this thing that's killing these girls originated in Sleepy Hollow?<eos> And is now coming to D.C.?<eos> That is what evidence suggests.<eos> When did the first incident happen?<eos> Three days ago.
Yes.<eos> According to the Chronicles, she was killed on her 11th birthday.<eos> Because that is when the Witnesses acquire their powerful mantle.<eos> And the girls that he killed before her?<eos> Sustenance.<eos> That rental car plate you gave us, we got a hit on it.<eos> It's headed north on Route 97.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Told you.<eos> Ice cream.
Feldspar bolts.<eos> Made of the same stone as Plymouth Rock.<eos> These should suffice in vanquishing the beast.<eos> How did this thing even find Molly?<eos> I may have an answer.<eos> I found this in Molly's room.<eos> Here.<eos> Occult symbols.<eos> Some Hermetic, some shamanistic.<eos> What?
It's okay to be upset.<eos> So if that wasn't Dad...<eos> And it wasn't.<eos> Then what was it?<eos> Was it a monster?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was a monster.<eos> I was responsible for bringing it here.<eos> By drawing those symbols.<eos> What?
Visions of Mr. Crane, except he's not Mr. Crane.<eos> Molly!<eos> Hello?<eos> He was so scared, Mom, so alone.<eos> We still don't know exactly what it is that you saw.<eos> It could have been a-a bad dream.<eos> Got an idea.<eos> I've been talking to the others about showing you something, but... maybe now's the time.<eos> Showing me something?<eos> What?
And they did.<eos> That really happened?<eos> Well, one thing you learn from the Vault is that all stories have a hint of truth to them.<eos> Pygmalion is a story of creation, about how artistic talent and intense emotion can bring beings to life.<eos> Molly, a short while ago, your teacher, Mr. David, was attacked.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> I promise you.<eos> But we believe he was attacked by a monster.<eos> More precisely, we believe he was attacked by Mr. Stitch.<eos> What?
- No!<eos> I'm not mad at Mr. David!<eos> No.<eos> Molly, Mr. David is speaking to you.<eos> She thinks she's helping me, but she's not.<eos> "She"?<eos> She thinks she knows what I'm feeling, but she doesn't.<eos> She says we should be honest with each other, but she's the one who was lying.<eos> - Go, go, go, go!<eos> - Oh, my God.
Molly!<eos> Stay back!<eos> I'm sorry I brought you here.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> I guess I just needed someone to talk to.<eos> You were always the one who listened.<eos> I guess I should have been talking to you, Mom.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I still need to finish the ritual.<eos> Blanket.
You know this woman?<eos> My god.<eos> Nancy.<eos> The thing that did this... it's in the walls.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Agent Thomas knew this poor soul.<eos> It's another life.<eos> Dreyfuss is gonna pay for.<eos> You said you saw it behind that vent?<eos> Only the eyes.
There she is.<eos> That's Ashley.<eos> So, what...<eos> Bluetooth scanner. Patent pending.<eos> Not exactly legal yet.<eos> But I can use a remote link to clone Ashley's SIM card.<eos> That way, if and when Dreyfuss calls, we can piggyback and use cell tower triangulation to locate him.<eos> But, not too close, Romeo.<eos> Just because you score with girls at bars doesn't mean that puppy dog charm of yours is gonna serve you here.<eos> Puppy dog charm?
My young and rather stylish rider of pestilence.<eos> And my ambitious, social climbing, and savagely hungry...<eos> Rider of famine.<eos> Just two more spaces left to fill, my friend.<eos> And I'm hoping the dark rider of death will be strong enough to rejoin us soon.<eos> The condition for his recovery will be attended to immediately, Malcolm.<eos> And that will leave just one last totem, Jobe.<eos> War.<eos> So Dreyfuss vandalized the Eisenhower building, and took the scales of justice.<eos> Yes. A set of golden scales.
And that will leave just one last totem, Jobe.<eos> War.<eos> So Dreyfuss vandalized the Eisenhower building, and took the scales of justice.<eos> Yes. A set of golden scales.<eos> It's not always seen in the hands of lady themis.<eos> Correct, master Wells.<eos> Scales are a totem in many mythologies.<eos> In the zodiac, Libra is a symbol of logic and balance.<eos> In biblical texts, the scales are a symbol of dread and primal power.<eos> No.
You sure you weren't an actor?<eos> Well, not unless you include John of Gaunt in the bath.<eos> This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, this...<eos> Ah.<eos> Agent Thoma...?<eos> Agent Thomas? Seems our search for Dreyfuss is nearing a conclusion.<eos> Something amiss?<eos> You ever get that feeling like... someone just walked over your grave?<eos> In my case, that may have actually happened.<eos> Twice.
Now, rather than seeking a greater understanding of the world, like the Masons proper, the Arma Mutata sought to change the world for the better.<eos> Sounds like fanatics.<eos> "Fanatic" is too kind a term.<eos> The Arma Mutata believed the instruments for this great change were the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<eos> They sought to raise them by bonding them to human hosts.<eos> But in order to do so, they required powerful, supernatural artifacts.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, Dreyfuss used scales charged by the hunger demon and a scroll charged by that djinn... To raise the Horsemen of Pestilence and Famine.<eos> The Headless Horseman already has one of these totems, right?<eos> That ax of his.
Because if we don't, it will be a disaster like no other.<eos> Ball is in your court, and the clock is ticking.<eos> Is it just me or was it weird what Jenny was saying about not always being around?<eos> Look, it's her life.<eos> She makes her own choices.<eos> Besides, it's not even like you're gonna notice she's gone now that your life is all Missy-centric.<eos> Okay, sometimes I feel like you aren't that into Missy.<eos> Now, I'd really like for my best friend and my girlfriend to get along.<eos> So she's officially your girlfriend now, huh?<eos> What?
And I thought, uh, Crane's time travel act was trippy.<eos> Save the questions for later.<eos> - What'd you find?<eos> - Not much.<eos> There's practically no literature on how to save someone who's become a Horseman.<eos> Because it's not possible.<eos> I saw a piece of what was inside War, and what was left wasn't human.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Crane's blood.<eos> What?
Not all reawakening is welcome.<eos> At this moment, the Avatar of War is breaking my father's psyche down, bit by bit, and soon there will be nothing left of the man known as Ichabod Crane.<eos> You must reach him before that happens.<eos> Save him.<eos> For that is a rebirth no one wants to see.<eos> It's a question of which Henry we're dealing with, because if it's the Bad Henry, then he can cause a lot of damage.<eos> We found it like this.<eos> Either the Archives has a serious raccoon problem... Or someone pulled an old smash-and-grab.<eos> You should see this.<eos> Oh, no.

Or someone pulled an old smash-and-grab.<eos> You should see this.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> (gasps) Spare jewelry?<eos> Something slightly more valuable.
An attack on Sleepy Hollow.<eos> What's this spell book look like?<eos> A book with spells in it.<eos> Very helpful.<eos> Okay, I think I got something.<eos> Here.<eos> "Incantantio Separatio."<eos> Spell for separation.<eos> This must be it.<eos> Problem?
Yes, we are.<eos> War's spirit was but separated from Crane's.<eos> It can be recalled, provided you have the right host.<eos> Perhaps I'll do.<eos> Shall we begin, Father?<eos> If we must.<eos> You were the offended party, Henry.<eos> I demand satisfaction.<eos> Very well.<eos> To the death.
And I thought we scheduled for Thursday next?<eos> Oops. Got our wires crossed.<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> So let's get that Mbps rate blazing.<eos> When I'm through you'll be able to play your video games, watch your porn, and video chat your grandma<eos> - without any lag.<eos> - Right, well, I'm a little preoccupied now, so could we reschedule?<eos> Are you available between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. three weeks from today?<eos> If the world hasn't ended in fiery apocalypse, then yes.<eos> Three weeks today.
And like you said, Hell has rules.<eos> You cannot trick us with cheap intimidation.<eos> So... are we going to pussyfoot around, or shall we strike a deal?<eos> Alex checked the frame and print for any runes, sigils, and symbols, right, and found a message written with invisible ink.<eos> Now, with a little help of copper sulfate and some heat...<eos> Voilà.<eos> "E pluribus unum."<eos> And a floor plan of the Vault, notated with surveyor marks, pointing to a spot behind this wall.<eos> Right here.<eos> What?
You made it back.<eos> Jobe was trying to help us, sent us to the right place.<eos> Mm-hmm. So... you met the man downstairs<eos> Yeah, the Father of Lies.<eos> The freaking Devil himself.<eos> Yes, and he gave us something that might do the trick.<eos> The Philosopher's Stone.<eos> That turned Dreyfuss immortal.<eos> So, if I can get close enough to Dreyfuss, I can use this to reverse the effects of his immortality long enough to deliver a mortal blow.<eos> On our end,
Why squander it on a mad quest for power?<eos> You say squander.<eos> And I say... I've merely chosen my destiny. Jobe... would you be a dear and fetch me the president?<eos> You know, I'm feeling a strangely urgent need to slice her right across... the neck.<eos> Don't, or I'll shoot.<eos> Agent Thomas.<eos> Do you have any idea how much I paid for this shirt?<eos> This was supposed to be my victory shirt.<eos> My... Wh...<eos> What?
Agent Thomas.<eos> Do you have any idea how much I paid for this shirt?<eos> This was supposed to be my victory shirt.<eos> My... Wh...<eos> What?<eos> What's ha-happening?<eos> Why am I still bleeding, Jobe?<eos> Why am I not healing, Jobe?<eos> You gave us no choice.<eos> Oh, no.
But it appears your contract with my employer has come to an end.<eos> Which makes me a free agent!<eos> It is finished.<eos> We can only hope the Horsemen have gone with him.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> What happened?<eos> It's too early to call, but I think we just won.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Agent Diana Thomas.<eos> Homeland Security.
Situation dire.<eos> Prognosis grim.<eos> No, Agent Thomas.<eos> Another day at the office.<eos> How can you be so flippant?<eos> You might have just damned yourself.<eos> I have learnt a very important lesson over the years.<eos> One that is reflected in the heart's blood of this nation.<eos> Work hard, stay true, surround yourself with people you love and respect, and there's nothing you cannot achieve.<eos> So this?
Tell Riggs I haven't seen him in a while, and I'm asking him over for dinner.<eos> I'm not easily offended, but the guy's getting pricklier.<eos> So you say.<eos> Every morning.<eos> Not every morning.<eos> Every morning.<eos> Hon, clearly your partner is going through something right now, and it's starting to consume you.<eos> And in the interest of talking about anything else over breakfast, get ahead of it.<eos> Hey, there he goes.<eos> Any updates?
So you say.<eos> Every morning.<eos> Not every morning.<eos> Every morning.<eos> Hon, clearly your partner is going through something right now, and it's starting to consume you.<eos> And in the interest of talking about anything else over breakfast, get ahead of it.<eos> Hey, there he goes.<eos> Any updates?<eos> Nope. Not talking about it.<eos> - What?
I got a dead body in Koreatown.<eos> See?<eos> This is what texting is for.<eos> Not asking a girl to a dance.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Hey, and don't forget to invite Riggs to dinner again!<eos> "Generational" my ass.<eos> As long as there's dances, there's gonna be kids who ask other kids to the dance.<eos> So he's gonna need a little game. Am I wrong?<eos> What?
Look like the future's in here.<eos> Is it not just me, but do you hear music?<eos> That's evidence.<eos> I know. It's not like I was gonna crush it up and snort it or anything.<eos> The party's over!<eos> We're shutting this down!<eos> They can't hear you.<eos> I got the bass cranked up.<eos> What is this?<eos> Some kind of a rave?
He got a lab somewhere?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> Adam did, but he was one of the few.<eos> Owlsly's... super underground.<eos> What a great thing to be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Owlsly is an artist.<eos> A Leonardo da Vinci of chemistry.<eos> I thought you said you had autopsy results.<eos> On this guy?
I broke it down to basic compounds, reverse-engineered it, and then I field-tested quite a few of them.<eos> That's becoming clear.<eos> Guys, I was blown away.<eos> This isn't old-school MDMA.<eos> The owl takes Molly and packs her bag.<eos> Good-bye. Sends her to college, 'cause this is... smooth.<eos> - Mind-expanding.<eos> - Is it legal?<eos> And it fixed the third act of my screenplay.<eos> What?
Yeah. And yes, he may have field-tested one too many supplements when he gave it to me.<eos> Smile, Rog.<eos> Hello.<eos> LAPD.<eos> We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."<eos> Owlsly.<eos> Owlsly.<eos> What-what?
Henry Cho, you get me.<eos> She's awake again.<eos> You can have ten more minutes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry. I keep drifting off.<eos> So, you were saying there were two men?<eos> One had a gun.<eos> They forced me into the hallway and started yelling, "Where's the money?"<eos> No one even noticed.<eos> What money?
He was still sleeping with Jessica.<eos> I killed him because he made me feel stupid.<eos> I dropped my guard.<eos> I let him in.<eos> I'm gonna need you to put that bag down.<eos> No problem.<eos> You should sit down, though.<eos> You should, um...<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> Transdermal from contact.

I'm gonna be squeezing a lot more than a half a million out of you.<eos> She worked us, Rog.<eos> I mean,<eos> Kang didn't kill Owlsly.<eos> I mean...<eos> Kang didn't kill Adam.<eos> Owlsly did.<eos> She killed him and took Kang's money.<eos> And then she drugged me.<eos> What?
I mean...<eos> Kang didn't kill Adam.<eos> Owlsly did.<eos> She killed him and took Kang's money.<eos> And then she drugged me.<eos> What?<eos> What, did you know this already?<eos> What, 'cause I told you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Twice.
- Good night.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Are we on speaking terms yet?<eos> I'd rather not talk about this.<eos> We're talking about it.<eos> If you don't tell Dad, I will.<eos> Tell Dad what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> RJ got asked to the dance by three different girls.<eos> - What?
Unable to work together in any cohesive way.<eos> - Actually, I'm not the one who deserves your praise.<eos> Menial labor without superspeed is really quite tedious.<eos> Then again, I've missed working with a fellow scientist.<eos> Cisco and Caitlin and I, as you know, worked together for some time and... I miss the camaraderie.<eos> - Legion of doom doesn't have karaoke Fridays?<eos> - I know it's easier for you to think of me as a monster.<eos> But, um, I've met some of history's monsters, Raymond, and believe me, I'm not one of them.<eos> - You killed Barry's mother.<eos> Twice.
- Martin, are you sure about these calculations?<eos> I'mpilotingmanuallyhere.<eos> - Did I or did I not win six carlins?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> 20secondsto intercept.<eos> - Jax, be prepared to restore the feed on my signal.<eos> - Ten seconds.<eos> - You're just gonna have to trust me.<eos> -Inthree,two ,one ...
- You don't even know my question.<eos> - At what angle do we need to re-enter the earth's atmosphere?<eos> 38 degrees.<eos> I'm from the 22nd century;<eos> I've learned astro-navigation in grade school.<eos> 38 degrees.<eos> or don't you trust me?<eos> - the re-entry angle needs to be 38 degrees.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Thawne.
Well, I thought I'd seen the last of this place.<eos> Let's not make it a habit.<eos> Well, I appear to be getting considerable vibrational energy from this.<eos> My old friend, please, forgive me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Am I okay?<eos> Why wouldn't I be okay?<eos> I miss him too.<eos> He blew himself up.<eos> For what?
Yep, that just happened.<eos> Well, that's remarkable.<eos> The spear must be composed of some kind of magnetized compound which acts as its own sealant.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.<eos> It will draw on our weaknesses, our desires, our regrets.<eos> It will promise each of us that we can remake the world just as we want it.<eos> Well, what's wrong with that?<eos> What?
Then we can destroy the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Mick, Mick, Mick, when have we ever destroyed anything we've ever stolen, let alone the most valuable score in the universe?<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> How the hell are we supposed to find anyone in here?<eos> - I said, how the hell are we sup...<eos> On your feet, you lazy good-for-nothings, or I'll have you shot!<eos> Did you hear me, Lieutenant?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - On your feet with your weapon, you fool of a Tolkien!<eos> On your feet!
I left all my research at Oxford.<eos> To help you, I would need a vast library.<eos> Well, lucky for you, we brought one.<eos> How'd it go out there?<eos> It was worse than any nightmare.<eos> You've seen this before.<eos> In World War II, it's definitely a situation where the sequel was worse than the original.<eos> What changed?<eos> I had Gideon show me the historical record.<eos> My future.
"Control-Z"?<eos> Like an undo command on a computer.<eos> Well, I was gonna try the new version on my latest test subject, but then I was worried it might melt his brain.<eos> Axel.<eos> No, it's Tesla, actually.<eos> He looks more like an Indiana to me.<eos> No, he's Axel.<eos> You gave me that little guy for Christmas.<eos> You haven't been running any tests on him, have you?<eos> What?
I don't know where the Englishman is.<eos> Neither do it.<eos> I can only imagine how those psychopaths are torturing Rip.<eos> Gideon!<eos> I've discovered the missing ingredient for my recipe.<eos> Rum.<eos> And speaking of which, I'm gonna need you to fabricate me another bottle of it.<eos> Ooh, and some nachos.<eos> I will do nothing of the sort.<eos> What?
But from what I could tell, he was building some sort of reactor.<eos> He said it would burn a thousand times hotter than the sun once it's operational.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> Could be a power generator, a particle accelerator.<eos> What if Thawne is trying to destroy the Spear?<eos> Impossible. You need the blood of Christ to destroy it.<eos> That's why Rip broke it up into so many pieces.<eos> Unless he figured out there's another way, by incinerating it.<eos> But why would Thawne want to destroy the Spear?<eos> No.
Ray, find us the quickest way into the lab, now.<eos> Look, you gotta believe me, okay?<eos> This is not the way it's supposed to be.<eos> Is this some sort of test of my loyalty?<eos> Does Mr. Thawne even care?<eos> Look, this isn't about Thawne.<eos> It's about you and me.<eos> I assure you, my... my dedication to Mr. Thawne has never been stronger.<eos> Did you just press the silent alarm?<eos> What?
I guess we're done here.<eos> You know the really swell thing about the Spear being destroyed?<eos> Now you can't stop us from killing you.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't insult my intelligence.<eos> Even at your fastest, you're moving in slow motion to me.<eos> Except they're not alone.<eos> I say we go down fighting.<eos> You kill one of us, we kill all of you.<eos> For Amaya.
Can anyone corroborate that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, maybe he told someone.<eos> All right. Any chance you have an alibi for the night of the murder?<eos> No.<eos> Kanuha, you got to understand what this looks like.<eos> You just did seven years in prison when your partner didn't even do a day.<eos> You had to have been angry about that. Yeah.<eos> I was.<eos> For awhile.
Excuse me?<eos> You get that look on your face like I'm supposed to know what you're thinking, but I-I-I don't.<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> There's two things on this earth that I am very grateful for.<eos> One is that you cannot read my mind;<eos> The second is this seat belt right here.<eos> Only two? Just two?<eos> Not the birth of your daughter or getting to know your beautiful little boy?<eos> Just me not having a superpower and your seat belt... that's it?<eos> Right now, yeah.
Don't you basically work on ads for a living, Schmidt?<eos> Yeah, well, my current account is for a menopause pill that eliminates night sweats.<eos> Oh, you're repping EstroFuel?<eos> Yes. Chest bump.<eos> You know, maybe I could use Donovan for the cover of The Pepperwood Chronicles.<eos> I mean, he wouldn't be Pepperwood but...<eos> - Gator! - Oh, Gator!<eos> It's perfect.<eos> - He could be a great Gator. - Why don't you just use a real gator?<eos> What?
You know, maybe I could use Donovan for the cover of The Pepperwood Chronicles.<eos> I mean, he wouldn't be Pepperwood but...<eos> - Gator! - Oh, Gator!<eos> It's perfect.<eos> - He could be a great Gator. - Why don't you just use a real gator?<eos> What?<eos> Gator is Pepperwood's best friend... - and clairvoyant brother. - Mm.<eos> Oh, my bad.<eos> Sorry, I haven't read it yet.<eos> - What? - What?
Now you get to read it.<eos> Now I get to read it.<eos> Robby's hospital bill is only $400.<eos> - That seem low to you?<eos> - Did he have a minor procedure?<eos> No, he had what the doctors call "a full Frankenstein."<eos> - They put dog bones in his knee. - Then that's way off.<eos> It's got to be much higher.<eos> Do you think he thinks I can't afford the full amount?<eos> What?
So please don't feel any pressure to like it, even though I spent 7,000 hours writing it.<eos> So without further ado, or as Pepperwood would say,<eos> "Ah-don't."<eos> You'll get that when you read it.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Here it is.<eos> I cannot wait to read this.<eos> I cannot wait to R-E-A...<eos> - Jess! Hey, there she is.<eos> Oh, me, hey.
No.<eos> No!<eos> You are the face of EstroFuel.<eos> - The shoot is tonight.<eos> - Oh, my God, it's tonight?<eos> And I told my boss that Cece's Boys would be there.<eos> - You told your boss...<eos> - Thank you, I'll see you there.<eos> Winston, you ready for the tour? - Hmm?<eos> - The what?
- This is important.<eos> - There was just a poster saying that they were closed on Veteran's Day.<eos> That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> Folks, we got a lawsuit.<eos> - Good job. - Great.<eos> Seriously, guys, just let me pay this.<eos> Say that one more time. Say that you're gonna pay one more time and see what happens.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> You know what usually calms me down?<eos> - A good mall walk.
Shut up!<eos> I-I'm the C.O.W.?<eos> I'm the... I'm the cop of the week?<eos> ♪ Moo moo ♪ I'm home!<eos> Well, congratulations, Winston, on finally making C.O.W.<eos> And damn you!<eos> Cece, we're gonna have go put out a menopause fire.<eos> - Let's go! - I made C.O.W., though. I made C.O.W., we ain't forgetting about all that.<eos> Okay, so, my lawyer says I don't have a case against the gym because I signed a waiver.<eos> A waiver?
Was that it?<eos> She didn't advise me on anything else.<eos> Okay. No one says the word "advise"<eos> unless they got advice, so what did she advise?<eos> Uh... oh, no. - What did she advise? - She didn't... it just wasn't...<eos> - What did she advise? - It didn't...<eos> Come on, what did she advise?<eos> - She advised that I sue!<eos> - I knew it!<eos> Who? You.
It's going back to being a guest room.<eos> You know, Louie's dad didn't... didn't want that stuff.<eos> You gonna take it to Goodwill?<eos> I said I'm boxing it.<eos> I didn't say I'm getting rid of it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go back to bed.<eos> Hey, Kelly.<eos> How's Anna feeling?<eos> Night and day.
On the bus, Darla said her stomach hurt.<eos> We thought she was carsick.<eos> But when we got inside, she buckled over.<eos> Hi, Darla, honey, can you tell me where you feel the pain?<eos> My back... and my stomach.<eos> I'm Gabby, and this is Sylvie.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> Can you roll on your back, sweetie?<eos> It hurts so bad.<eos> Any tenderness?
It's on the inside.<eos> We're gonna need all the students out of this area. Okay.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Follow me... now.<eos> Trisha!<eos> Darla.<eos> You're having contractions.<eos> What's that?<eos> Honey, do you know you're pregnant?<eos> What? What?
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me one good push, okay?<eos> Okay, stop pushing.<eos> Baby's breech.<eos> I'm gonna reach in and try and ease the baby's legs out.<eos> Okay, tough girl, let's do this.<eos> Get ready to push again, okay?<eos> - I'll try.<eos> - Good.
- I'll try.<eos> - Good.<eos> On three... one, two, three.<eos> Why isn't it coming?<eos> You're doing great.<eos> Let's try again. Gentle push... nice, easy breaths.<eos> Okay, the baby's shifting.<eos> This is our shot.<eos> Got one leg.<eos> Two of 'em.
Don't talk to your daughter like that.<eos> She needs your support right now,<eos> - not your judgment.<eos> - Do you have any idea what you're getting in the middle of here?<eos> Dawson.<eos> Everyone always knows best but me, right?<eos> You, your... your friends at school, these people.<eos> You want to keep the baby?<eos> Then go live with your Aunt Therese.<eos> What?
Seriously, Mouch?<eos> A Charleston Chew?<eos> Any left?<eos> So we went through the wreckage, splinter by splinter... no body.<eos> We turned the scene over to OFI.<eos> They'll bring in search dogs, look for any traces of him... if you're saying there's still someone inside.<eos> Well, I wasn't hallucinating, so yeah.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah.
My name's Matt Casey.<eos> I'm a lieutenant with the CFD.<eos> I see.<eos> I wanted to ask you about the man living in the basement at 3281 West Palmer.<eos> There's no basement unit in that building.<eos> I know there was a report of a victim being trapped down there, but, I can tell you, there's nobody living in that basement.<eos> Well, I saw him.<eos> Now, I'm not trying to get you in trouble.<eos> If you were renting to him under the table...<eos> What?
We might be too late. Hey, you get us in there, we'll be able to help him.<eos> It should've popped by now.<eos> There's probably a surface bolt on the inside.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Tony, you get another hose. I'll steal one from the jaws.<eos> Hey, we don't have time.<eos> Tony.<eos> All right, give me a hand, guys.<eos> Ready?<eos> All right, one, two, three.
While I wasn't there to mock you.<eos> Such a shame. - Timing's everything.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> Hey, did I ever thank you?<eos> For being there for me when I was laid up?<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I mean, you had a concussion, so I just assumed that you were delirious.<eos> But... yeah.<eos> So Casey's still making you spit polish the place?<eos> Non-stop.
Welcome back.<eos> - Hi. - Mmm!<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> You must be Walker.<eos> Great to finally meet you.<eos> It's really great to finally meet you. I've heard nothing but wonderful things.<eos> Uh, ok, speaking of wonderful things, let's have it. How's your mom doing?<eos> She's ok. You know, we have good days and bad days.<eos> So, are you still going to be going to Houston on the weekends to visit her?<eos> No, actually, I...
Wait.<eos> Two nights before Helen died, we came back from a dinner party, and our babysitter said she thought she heard a noise upstairs.<eos> Did you investigate?<eos> Yeah, I checked the whole house.<eos> Nothing was out of place, nothing stolen.<eos> Helen and I, we didn't give it another thought.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Could that have been him?<eos> I understand you teach anatomy class every Tuesday evening?<eos> Every other Tuesday.
Maybe our killer sees something out here we don't.<eos> All right, Mom, I just want you to meet her, ok?<eos> Just meet her and tell me what you think.<eos> I already know what I think.<eos> Come on, Mom, let's go.<eos> Let's go say hi.<eos> Mom...<eos> Mother.<eos> Maybe you can show her your scrapbook, huh?<eos> What for?
Our current profile of the unsub doesn't apply to his earlier killings.<eos> Those had no ritual and a strong sexual component.<eos> Ok, so something happened in the 10 months between here and here.<eos> Something big.<eos> Because when the unsub emerged to start killing again, his victimology and M.O. had done a complete 180.<eos> We think he may have burned himself, right?<eos> Maybe he was in some sort of accident during that time.<eos> What kind of accident?<eos> No idea.<eos> What?
It turns out the Jarvises ran some sort of discount spiritual center out of their two-car garage.<eos> It was a mish-mash of, I don't know, like old testament fire and brimstone mixed with Halloween goblins and snake oil commerce.<eos> Was Bryce involved with the family business?<eos> Mm-mmm. Bryce hated his parents, his parents loathed him.<eos> Back in the day, local child services had the Jarvis residence on speed dial.<eos> There was rumors of sexual abuse. It was never proven.<eos> But he continued to live with them as an adult?<eos> Yeah. Bryce could not hold down a job. He had no place to go.<eos> Anyway, a couple of years ago, Fred and Marnie got put in county lockup for 6 months.<eos> On what charge?
Anyway, a couple of years ago, Fred and Marnie got put in county lockup for 6 months.<eos> On what charge?<eos> Fraud.<eos> It turns out that the Jarvises were selling ointment that they claimed when spread liberally on one's face and arms and hands, would repel Satan.<eos> And, yes, you heard that correctly.<eos> No need to adjust your headsets.<eos> While they were locked up, Bryce had a nervous breakdown.<eos> He spent time in the state hospital.<eos> Let me guess. Shortly after his release, the murders of the 6 young women started.<eos> Exactly two weeks later.
So I can testify against him?<eos> Legally, you can describe every detail of what Mark did to you.<eos> You just can't say what he confessed about other victims.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want to make sure that he never hurts another person.<eos> I knew something was wrong, but I... I never suspected anything like this.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> But I thought that I had found true love.<eos> I was so happy to get married.<eos> Now this.
Drug cartels.<eos> Could have threatened Reid and used him as a mule.<eos> Agreed.<eos> This could simply be a case of bad luck.<eos> Reid was in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Spence's mom is ok.<eos> The home nurse he hired said all is stable.<eos> Oh, thank the stars.<eos> Alvez: How long did he tell the nurse he'd be gone?<eos> Uh, 3 days.
Absolutely. But there's something bigger in play. That's why he crossed the border and kept it a secret.<eos> There's something he didn't want to share with any of you.<eos> Ok, so what would make him risk everything?<eos> His mom.<eos> Yeah, but she's here and she's safe.<eos> - [Beep] - Oh, wait.<eos> Cruz just sent me the arresting report.<eos> Hold, please. Translating now.<eos> It says here that Reid was involved in a high-speed chase.<eos> What?
Which I'm intimately familiar with, but none of this would have happened if he would have let us help.<eos> Well, Penelope, that's what we're gonna do now. Ok?<eos> Well, I'm still mad at him.<eos> Prentiss: We know you didn't do this.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> She was stabbed, multiple times.<eos> It looked personal.<eos> We got the results of your blood work.<eos> There's cocaine and heroin in your system.<eos> What else?
What is it?<eos> I'm gonna run it through the lab.<eos> Whatever's in those vials, I was giving it to my mom.<eos> That's the only thing I'm sure of.<eos> So Emily said they're gonna try a cognitive, but she isn't very hopeful.<eos> Did they run a full tox screen? No.<eos> No, they only looked for cocaine and heroin because those were the drugs in his possession.<eos> And?<eos> And he tested positive for both.<eos> What?
You said that you met Nadie, who calls herself Rosa, in Houston.<eos> Why didn't she just give you the vials in the U.S.?<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> But she helped us and I trusted her.<eos> I was right to.<eos> I still believe that.<eos> Well, she convinced you to cross the border multiple times.<eos> She had you risk your life.<eos> Because she must have had something to lose, too.<eos> Like family.
I didn't record it.<eos> But that was our agreement.<eos> I determined he was still under the influence.<eos> Anything he said wouldn't have clarified matters.<eos> You're committed agents.<eos> And I've worked with the IRT before.<eos> I trust you know what you're doing.<eos> We do.<eos> I promise.<eos> Thanks for the ride home.
Trust me.<eos> Garcia had meals delivered to your mom almost every night. Garcia:<eos> And that nurse you got is amazing... Cassie.<eos> Cassie, she's great.<eos> JJ: I brought the boys by.<eos> Your mom really loved them.<eos> Reid: I bet she did.<eos> Uh, I just got a text.<eos> Reid isn't eligible for the Bureau's legal assistance.<eos> What?
I-I just... I can't be on board.<eos> I told you, it wouldn't be contentious.<eos> Yes, great, you were right, and I was wrong.<eos> _ Let's finish up.<eos> Schooling.<eos> Private or public?<eos> - Private.<eos> - Private.<eos> And nannies?<eos> The more the merrier.
You're right.<eos> How'd you leave things?<eos> Well, she swears it's over with the old guy.<eos> What do you think? You trust her?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Yeah. Me neither.<eos> Look, if anything else happens...<eos> Absolutely. Anything I know, you know.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> Anything at all?
Finally.<eos> But my daughter's having a hard time, now that I'm with Xo.<eos> And I would never put her through this if I didn't think that your mom... and what we have... Is worth it.<eos> Just give your daughter some time.<eos> I bet she'll come around.<eos> So, thank you for giving Bruce another chance.<eos> Well, he seems to really care about you.<eos> Right?<eos> So, can we put another dinner on the books?<eos> Maybe a double date?
And... I don't know, I-I don't like thinking about you like that.<eos> I'm sorry, you asked me what was wrong.<eos> No, it's okay, I get it.<eos> Hey, Michael, I'm done with dinner.<eos> I'm picking up Mateo and I'll be home soon.<eos> Sacre bleu!<eos> Sorry, I mean, oh, my gosh.<eos> So, of course I told Rafael.<eos> He said he was gonna end it, but I mean, can you believe her?<eos> What?
I tried to tell her about the algorithm.<eos> I take it you're not on board with our plan to coparent.<eos> You've only known each other for two weeks.<eos> We've thought everything through, negotiated the terms of our agreement, and we took my very comprehensive compatibility Love Forecast.<eos> It takes a lot more than a compatibility test to make this kind of commitment, otherwise, everyone matched on eHarmony would be married.<eos> My Love Forecast is better than eHarmony's... if you're honest.<eos> Question 42 of our compatibility test is, "Do you have a supportive family?"<eos> You checked yes, and clearly, you don't.<eos> I'm gonna go freshen up.<eos> What?
Hey, Duarte, escort ASA Valdez upstairs to the drunk tank.<eos> Uh, Mr. Carrera was pretty loaded when they hauled him in this morning.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Good news, bad news, Arnold.<eos> Which do you want first?<eos> - How bad's the bad?<eos> - Very. I'll take good for $500, please, Alex.<eos> Stone authorized a plea of 20 for Carrera today only.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> On a simple assault?
Peter...<eos> Rifking called.<eos> Carrera said we should shove it.<eos> Well, look on the upside.<eos> You're first chair on a homicide.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Peter, I wanna...<eos> - Anna, I'm eating.<eos> - Valdez?
Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Peter, I wanna...<eos> - Anna, I'm eating.<eos> - Valdez?<eos> - Hey, it's Arnold Rifking.<eos> Sorry, Arnold, you're too late.<eos> Boozy the Clown...<eos> Kid in the cell... he died.<eos> What?
You went to the lake with Wilkes still in the ambulance?<eos> The dude was covered in vomit, and stinking of booze.<eos> We figured he wasn't going anywhere.<eos> Turns out you were wrong.<eos> Remind me not to get sick.<eos> Remind me not to be a black male.<eos> Hey... that kid from the lake...<eos> He made it.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> What?
You make an arrest, you cuff your man.<eos> You holster your weapon, safety on.<eos> You load a prisoner, you strap him in.<eos> That way, if someone accuses you of something, you don't have to think when you answer.<eos> You know exactly what you did, because you did it the same away a thousand times before.<eos> Valdez?<eos> We'll meet you there.<eos> Mr. Carrera has something he thinks might help with your search for Mr. Wilkes's killer.<eos> Right.<eos> In exchange for what?
Mr. Carrera has something he thinks might help with your search for Mr. Wilkes's killer.<eos> Right.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Hear him out, and then tell me how you want to play it.<eos> When I was in the cage with Wilkes, he... He might've said something about a cop hitting him.<eos> Might have?<eos> Depends.<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> Wh... what my client means is that in exchange for your empathy regarding a certain incident in a local tavern, he'd be willing to testify against the police officer who killed Mr. Wilkes.<eos> Pass.
Yeah.<eos> If Kev killed that son of a bitch, that son of a bitch needed killing.<eos> A cop, EMTs, doctors...<eos> Lots of fingers will be pointing.<eos> Ending in a textbook case of reasonable doubt for any and all of them.<eos> The problem is, we don't have enough evidence to convict any one of them alone.<eos> No, Anna, the problem is saying,<eos> "Sorry, someone screwed the pooch,<eos> - but we don't know who."<eos> - Because of Reverend Fitch?

Character evidence isn't admissible until after a verdict.<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> My question is why?<eos> Because we're looking into the truth about what happened to Wilkes.<eos> You even sound like your old man.<eos> When the acorn falls, it lands in the shade of the oak.<eos> It could be stifling.<eos> No, my dad has nothing to do with how I practice law.<eos> Hm. A couple of years ago, I called my dad out of the blue, just to say I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
- That's crazy, Kev.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> Because how many times have you grabbed a bad guy a little tighter than you should have?<eos> Hit him harder than you should have?<eos> I mean... This is what we do.<eos> This is payback.<eos> No, it's...<eos> What we did... What we do... We do it for the right reasons.<eos> Keep shooting, huh?<eos> What?
- Previously on Pure Genius...<eos> - When I opened Bunker Hill, I made a promise that I would do everything humanly possible to save everyone who came through these doors.<eos> I didn't build this hospital to deliver bad news.<eos> - James? - I promise not to overpromise.<eos> I want to go out with you to a concert. - You know, like on a date.<eos> - Um...
Okay, I've penetrated the pleural wall.<eos> - I need to hook her up to ECMO.<eos> - No! What are you saying? Doctor, this patient will die if we don't get her hooked up to ECMO now.<eos> - I promised.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine, do it.<eos> Look, this problem has nothing to do with me or my company.<eos> Your early generation of microchips used cadmium.<eos> Which is well known to be linked to respiratory diseases.<eos> Yes, but not from secondary exposure in topsoil.
Not afraid to go against you, either.<eos> Well, then you're just as foolish as I assumed.<eos> I have nowhere to hang this after all.<eos> Virtual reality therapy.<eos> The military developed it to treat combat survivors suffering from extreme PTSD.<eos> Soldiers are put through VR battle simulations to help speed up therapeutic recovery times.<eos> So you want to take Evan back to the day he broke his leg?<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Coleman, we believe the trauma that caused Evan's conversion disorder was his brother's death and Evan's belief that he is responsible.<eos> What?
So you want to take Evan back to the day he broke his leg?<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Coleman, we believe the trauma that caused Evan's conversion disorder was his brother's death and Evan's belief that he is responsible.<eos> What?<eos> That happened years before his accident.<eos> And Evan lost the use of his legs when he was 13.<eos> That was the same age that Derek was when he died.<eos> We believe this treatment is our best hope to break the cycle of guilt that's destroying his body.<eos> You want to put him through that again?<eos> That horrible night?
Derek was in his room.<eos> We were playing video games together.<eos> Think back to that day the best you can.<eos> Is this what the downstairs looked like?<eos> Smoke.<eos> There was smoke.<eos> Like this?<eos> More.<eos> A-And I could tell it was coming from upstairs.<eos> Like that? Yeah.
What the hell have you done to us?<eos> She swore Carter was innocent.<eos> I told you, never trust the client.<eos> Where were you yesterday?<eos> Home.<eos> Went to bed early, at 10:00.<eos> In the past seven words, you exhibited two of the three most common you blinked twice the national average, and you pointed your feet towards the exit.<eos> When we fib, we subconsciously get ready to leave the room, in case we're caught.<eos> We know you were with Carter yesterday.<eos> Why?
Welcome aboard.<eos> Please keep your arms and legs inside the car at all times.<eos> Expectant mothers and young children should not ride.<eos> That was a joke.<eos> Everyone ready?<eos> Here we go.<eos> No.<eos> But let's go.<eos> God!<eos> Thanks for your time.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Please know that my settlement offer still stands.<eos> But... you won.<eos> Well, we both lost Adam.<eos> Here, here. Come here.<eos> Dean.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sorry I won't be able to help you with your next trial.<eos> For double murder.
But... you won.<eos> Well, we both lost Adam.<eos> Here, here. Come here.<eos> Dean.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sorry I won't be able to help you with your next trial.<eos> For double murder.<eos> Police are on their way.<eos> What?
We traced that user to you.<eos> And that's not a theory, it's a fact.<eos> One family member just became dispensable.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say...<eos> So... still have mixed feelings about advancing technology?<eos> She wasn't at fault.<eos> Your uncle was a cabbie, wasn't he?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For 32 years.
Hayes?<eos> Open the door.<eos> I knew I couldn't do this job.<eos> I told you.<eos> You wanted the truth, and I found it.<eos> Earl was innocent.<eos> And he... he died anyway.<eos> I couldn't save him.<eos> Open the door.<eos> What?
We'll go back through the files... again.<eos> You need a break.<eos> I came home so I could focus.<eos> Go away.<eos> What you need to do is un-focus.<eos> Relax.<eos> Neuroscientists say that the best way to solve a tough problem is to focus on something else.<eos> So let your subconscious do the work while you tell me what's happening with you and Wallace.<eos> We got into a fight.<eos> - About what?

He had no remorse.<eos> He would've kept raping women, kept ruining their lives.<eos> He would've never stopped.<eos> So you killed him.<eos> Yes.<eos> What about Sophie?<eos> I thought she'd get off.<eos> Innocent people aren't supposed to go to prison.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> NYPD.
Enjoy your legacy.<eos> We don't usually see you here for this part.<eos> I wanted to make sure Sophie was okay.<eos> Even now, she has a long road ahead.<eos> Well, at least she doesn't have to go it alone.<eos> Maya.<eos> Brave women.<eos> I want in.<eos> On...?<eos> Us.

We should take advantage of it.<eos> Gavin, you told me to interrupt if Jack Barker came to see you. I'm sorry.<eos> Yes. Send him in.<eos> I thought Barker would crack after one day in that basement.<eos> The fact that it's taken him two weeks to fess up about hijacking my fucking plane and resign will make it all the sweeter.<eos> Hiya, Skipper.<eos> Sorry to barge in.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> Really?<eos> Whatever for?
- No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> My shame will linger even after my voting rights are restored.<eos> Now, are there records of these chats on your server?<eos> Yeah, we store everything.<eos> What... Okay.<eos> What's going on? How serious is this?<eos> Each violation of COPPA... carries a penalty of $16,000.<eos> So we're fined $16,000?<eos> Oh, no.
All right, all right.<eos> Don't think about that.<eos> Just think about how to solve this massive, massive problem.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Quick as you can.<eos> Jared!<eos> Just...<eos> Wait.<eos> We could shut down.<eos> No, no, no.
I came to take it.<eos> I thought I'd have to buy you out, and I wanted to know what kind of CEO I'd be dealing with, so I had my comms people pull your press, like this interview you did with TechCrunch<eos> where you described PiperChat as, and I quote,<eos> "Exactly like HooliChat,<eos> "but without the suck-ass parts," end quote.<eos> Or the one you did with Emily Chang, where you told her how you took "the best parts of HooliChat "and made them less crappy."<eos> I was about to throw you a massive acquisition deal, and then I realized you'd already publicly admitted to stealing my IP.<eos> I hope you have a good lawyer.<eos> He works at the car wash down the street.<eos> What?
Eight different ways to make a Chinese recipe, octopus.<eos> So I just traded one year... of free rent, full pool privileges, and more room in the crisper for an application that is just... eight recipes for octopus?<eos> - Hmm? - Yes.<eos> Hey, guys, they're ready.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> I went through every chat in his history.<eos> They're all the same.<eos> Perhaps it was another chat format.<eos> Could you acquire Skype or FaceTime and check them as well?<eos> What?
Could you acquire Skype or FaceTime and check them as well?<eos> What?<eos> Uh, Gavin, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I need to talk to you about this PiperChat acquisition.<eos> I put together a panel of the most active users you ported over from PiperChat.<eos> Bear in mind, this group is representative in terms of gender, race and, most importantly, age.<eos> Now, who else thinks changing to a HooliChat log-in is hella lame?<eos> Madison, Allison, Jennifer,<eos> Stephanie, Quinn, Ingrid, Kaylee...<eos> - Oh, no.
Here we go.<eos> Todd, our senior systems engineer.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's my official duty to... escort you off the property...<eos> I understand.<eos> - Thank you for your dedication...<eos> - ... and relieve you of your badge.<eos> Yes.<eos> I guess this is it then.<eos> Goodbye, Hoover.<eos> Your parking hang tag.
I mean, he must've had a reason.<eos> Wait. Peter was a compulsive note-taker. Right?<eos> What about his journals? I mean, do you guys still have them?<eos> Richard, I am on thin ice as it is at Raviga.<eos> No. Monica, listen to me, okay?<eos> I haven't slept in days.<eos> I'm walking into pools fully clothed.<eos> This is all I think about.<eos> Please.<eos> Fine, but just this once.
- I didn't send that.<eos> - Oh, you didn't?<eos> - My hand to Satan.<eos> But before you go ahead and get a little brown boner in your pants, you might wanna consider that it's not a woman.<eos> I bet you're being catfished by Gavin himself.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - But...<eos> - But what?<eos> On the off chance that this is an actual real woman, getting murdered seems like an acceptable risk.<eos> - Oh, hey.
- Okay.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> So... do you like movies?<eos> Depends on the movie.<eos> I'm the exact same way.<eos> It being a movie doesn't mean I'm gonna like it.<eos> Would you care for some wine or a cocktail tonight?<eos> Uh, just water, please.

Just water, please.<eos> I love water.<eos> I do.<eos> Oceans, rivers... lakes.<eos> When does a pond... become a lake?<eos> I wonder if it's depth.<eos> Where are those waters?<eos> Felt like we ordered waters a while ago.<eos> And...<eos> What?
I do.<eos> Oceans, rivers... lakes.<eos> When does a pond... become a lake?<eos> I wonder if it's depth.<eos> Where are those waters?<eos> Felt like we ordered waters a while ago.<eos> And...<eos> What?<eos> Fucking prick.<eos> - What? - Oh, nothing.
Let's get a bottle of Malbec.<eos> - Fucking Gilfoyle.<eos> - Right?<eos> Mr. Bighetti.<eos> When you're ready.<eos> Uh, ready for what?<eos> I'm like the class clown already.<eos> Why is my name on the board?<eos> _<eos> Oh, no.
But the King, he may need you.<eos> The King, in his wisdom, has all but banished him, Father Beocca.<eos> You should also raise the question of how the Northmen came to know of Aethelflaed's situation, of where she would be.<eos> If you believe her to be alive, you will not abandon her.<eos> You will not. That is a fact.<eos> So, what is the real reason we're travelling home to Coccham and not to Winchester?<eos> There's nothing to be said in Winchester.<eos> I won't be part of a whispering court.<eos> We will go when I have something to say, not before.<eos> Sihtric.
My news is too important to trust to a messenger.<eos> Lunden has been reclaimed.<eos> Praise God.<eos> Not a single Northman has been left alive in the city... but this great victory has come at a significant cost.<eos> It is the way of battle.<eos> It concerns Aethelflaed, Lord.<eos> What of her?<eos> We fear that she has been... taken.<eos> We pray that is the outcome, Lord.<eos> By the Northmen?
Who are you?<eos> He's Alfred's bastard.<eos> I am called Osferth, Lady.<eos> I am simply called Osferth.<eos> Every person in every town has been instructed to pray, that she is alive and kept well.<eos> Then, she will surely be alive, kept well, and will be free in no time.<eos> All right, say goodnight.<eos> You do not believe, Lord?<eos> Oh, I believe... but in the true gods.<eos> And in fate.
Oh, you wouldn't like her-she's bony and she squeals.<eos> She passes the time.<eos> And if you put a pup in her belly?<eos> Then, Alfred will get two for the price of one.<eos> And Viking blood to strengthen his line, eh?<eos> What will happen when we reach Beamfleot?<eos> Will there be a ritual, a toast, a meal?<eos> There will be a heathen sacrifice the youngest member of the visiting party will be split with an axe.<eos> They will want to humiliate us.<eos> In what way?

She is a daughter, not a son.<eos> Unloved and, in truth, banished to Mercia to spend her life being humped by her husband, whom you have so generously put to bed.<eos> But like her husband, Alfred's not minded to pay a great sum.<eos> Alfred's price is what?<eos> Say it!<eos> I will.<eos> Separate from the 100lb weight of silver offered by her husband,<eos> Alfred will add another...<eos> 200lb weight of silver.<eos> 300lb in total.
Business is done.<eos> Done?<eos> ! A bargain has been made, and not a good one.<eos> Say nothing.<eos> Uhtred and Father Pyrlig have gone to see how your lady is, Lord.<eos> Then I will go to her.<eos> No!<eos> You will wait here.<eos> You will sit... with me.<eos> To silver and gold.
Give her time with the priest and then you will see her.<eos> 26 ships.<eos> By the next moon there will be more.<eos> And more still, the moon after.<eos> Alfred will pay for his own destruction.<eos> You should not underestimate Alfred of Wessex.<eos> Never.<eos> But he will pay what you have agreed?<eos> He will.<eos> Even for an unloved daughter?
Please?<eos> Destiny is all.<eos> What binds a man to a land?<eos> You have a poor wretch, toiling in the fields, burning in summer, shivering in winter. He works all day, every day for nothing more than a loaf of bread and a pot to piss in.<eos> His children die of disease, his wife dies giving him children.<eos> Yet, when that land is threatened, something stirs. Why?<eos> It is the land that feeds him.<eos> More than that.<eos> Er, the trees off the land are used for shelter and fire.<eos> More than that.
So you will take him this letter.<eos> This is a great responsibility.<eos> They will have no peace.<eos> None.<eos> I have told them the same.<eos> But you will still help them?<eos> I must, I have no choice.<eos> If they escape then there will be no ransom paid. No great army.<eos> The men of Wessex are saved, yes, but what becomes of you?<eos> Of us?
Tomorrow I will make a sacrifice to keep you safe.<eos> All of us?<eos> Give your name to the scribe.<eos> The sum of your contribution will be written beside your name.<eos> We're helping to free the Lady Aethelflaed.<eos> I've got nothing to give, I've got a family.<eos> Any man or woman found to be hiding the value of their wealth shall be punished.<eos> All must pay their share.<eos> You have the gratitude of the King, and of God.<eos> Name?
I'm glad to hear it.<eos> You spoke of a plan.<eos> I did?<eos> Mm-hm. Am I to be reminded?<eos> The men of Devonshire.<eos> They should remain in the fields.<eos> I must have been very drunk.<eos> It can be the only explanation, Lord.<eos> Yes. You swear?<eos> On my life.
Get it done before we burn!<eos> It's all cleared, the hall of men, Lord.<eos> Now, how do we clear the yard?<eos> They will follow the silver.<eos> Where did this begin?<eos> Lady, quickly, run for the rear gate.<eos> Do not stop!<eos> The Princess!<eos> Stop her!<eos> After her!
Lord?<eos> To die.<eos> It will be today.<eos> Who is with me?<eos> Who is ready for glory... or Valhalla?<eos> - Shield wall! - Shield wall!<eos> Faster!<eos> Move!<eos> Faster!<eos> Shield! Shield!
Okay, how?<eos> We move Weber in the trunk of a rental.<eos> The Austrian border is 50 miles.<eos> No customs.<eos> No searches.<eos> And they like American dollars.<eos> No planned searches, but they can always pull you over.<eos> And when they do, I promise you, they're gonna look in your trunk and find your asset.<eos> When was Lydia in Malate?<eos> What?
Using your credit card?<eos> Is this a death wish?<eos> ! Let's get you out of here.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You guys go around the back.<eos> Owen might try to make a run for it.<eos> You must not have gotten the message.<eos> The surveillance op is on.<eos> We have to move now.<eos> What?
You don't. They do.<eos> If you don't trust the CIA, then you don't deserve to be here.<eos> I'll do this myself.<eos> How long is this gonna take, anyway?<eos> Not long at all.<eos> Owen Hall.<eos> You probably don't recognize me, but I recognize you.<eos> Daniel Sharp.<eos> I was only 14 when they murdered my mother right in front to me.<eos> Because of you.
I may put the mission before our relationship, but when it comes to your life, it's not even a question.<eos> I know.<eos> So you want to get out of here, find a place to be alone?<eos> Now's just not good.<eos> I can wait.<eos> Okay, well, let's meet tonight.<eos> Just don't come back down here again, okay?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm moving into Leigh's old room for the rest of training.<eos> What?
Oh, shoot, can I have a tampon?<eos> I forgot to go to the store.<eos> - Sorry, I don't have my period.<eos> - You don't?<eos> We used to always have the same cycle.<eos> You aren't gonna cry because we are not on our periods at the same time, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I think I'm due soon.<eos> - _ - Oh, my God.<eos> What?
With school, and money.<eos> Okay, first, l-let's take the test.<eos> Is this a... - _ - a plus, or a lightning bolt?<eos> It's nothing. My mom's test was expired.<eos> I'll have to buy one tomorrow.<eos> Kind of a letdown.<eos> So, you'd be excited?<eos> I mean, it's sooner than we thought, but our family already started earlier than we planned.<eos> That's true.<eos> What?
I'm just a little bit completely trashed.<eos> Don't tell my dad.<eos> I can crash here, right?<eos> She won't let me take her to Bruce's.<eos> - You can't tell my dad. Please!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll be nice to you, I swear. - Just sit down.<eos> You can have sex with him all the time.<eos> We'll get you some water.<eos> And maybe some pizza?
We'll get you some water.<eos> And maybe some pizza?<eos> I have to call Bruce, right? _<eos> Definitely.<eos> Just give her a little time to sober up.<eos> Okay, I don't want to mess this up. - _<eos> - This feels like some kind of test.<eos> _<eos> Ma, she's gone.<eos> What?
I left my pictures here.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Dad, are you all right?<eos> Did you see the Internet?<eos> - _ - Penis! Penis!<eos> No, we haven't.<eos> What's going on?<eos> It was awful, the way I yelled...<eos> "Penis" a hundred times?<eos> At Darci.
The plea deal is off the table.<eos> Apparently there's a lot of scrutiny...<eos> Rich guys being treated differently.<eos> And my family is high-profile, so the mayor wants to show he's tough on white-collar crime.<eos> Okay, so you fight back.<eos> If I do that, everyone in my life will be subpoenaed, interrogated and dragged through the mud.<eos> - What's the alternative?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I could plead guilty.<eos> And what?
Me three.<eos> All right.<eos> What comes up must come down. Oh!<eos> Over there is where part of that amazing memoir took place.<eos> When the author was 14 years old, she would swim from island to island to escape her crazy home life.<eos> Well, not island to island, but-but, hmm.<eos> No, she did.<eos> No, that's impossible. There are jetties just under the water that you can't see.<eos> I remember, during our drug bust, our boats had to go around.<eos> What?
Blood test, uh, X-Ray, DNA, MRI and whatever else the doctor recommends to rule out any plastic surgery.<eos> You got it, friend.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, it-it's just that, um... her ex killed my dad.<eos> I know. But that's only if you believe that death is finite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, so...<eos> Well, that went well.<eos> You do realize, when you pass this medical exam, you leave the country.<eos> For good.
I'm glad you asked.<eos> The main problem is pressure.<eos> There isn't any. CHALK SCRAPES So, don't hold your breath or your lungs will explode.<eos> Blood vessels rupture.<eos> Exposed areas swell.<eos> Fun fact!<eos> The boiling temperature of water is much lower in a vacuum.<eos> Which means... that your sweat and your saliva will boil... as will the fluid around your eyes.<eos> You won't notice any of this because 15 seconds in, you've passed out... as oxygen bubbles formed in your blood. And 90 seconds in... ..you're dead.<eos> Any questions?

'<eos> - Crop rotation?<eos> - Space.
I haven't seen MY true face in years.<eos> Swapped it for this one on the run.<eos> Oh, look, Bill, it's Nardole!<eos> What a lovely surprise!<eos> Thought I sent you to Birmingham for a packet of crisps.<eos> Yeah, I saw through your cunning ruse...!<eos> Yes, well, if you will go thinking for yourself...<eos> What do you want?<eos> I was given strict instructions to keep you at the university.<eos> - Who by?

'Instruction received.<eos> 'Organic component will be deactivated.<eos> 'Please remain calm while your central nervous system is disabled.<eos> 'Your life is in our hands.'<eos> Airlock! Airlock. Helmets on.<eos> - Where are we going? - Outside. Didn't they say that was a bad idea?<eos> But I know a worse one.<eos> Wait, why, why, why... why do I need that?<eos> What about the... air... force-field thing?<eos> Not strong enough for a vacuum.
- You ok?<eos> - Shh. No!<eos> What happened?<eos> I can't move.<eos> Your suit set to auto.<eos> The Doctor hacked it and walked you out.<eos> And you've got oxygen deprivation which is why you feel... - like... you feel.<eos> - Have you looked down there?<eos> Oh, no, they're fine.<eos> What?
What if there never was a hack?<eos> What if this is just business?<eos> Business as usual.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Bill.<eos> Bill.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Why are you saying that?<eos> - We're going to have to leave you here.<eos> - What?
He's wired them to the coolant system.<eos> If we die, it vents.<eos> When the suits kill us and they are going to kill us... the core will blow and the whole station will be destroyed.<eos> One very big boom.<eos> Is that really the best you've got?<eos> Revenge?<eos> Not just revenge.<eos> It's revenge as bright as the sun.<eos> It's revenge you can see across galaxies!<eos> - Not bad for a blind man.
Open up.<eos> Let's send them a message.<eos> Let's teach them a lesson they will never forget.<eos> They take our lives, we take their station and every penny they will ever make from it.<eos> Die well!<eos> It's the finish line!<eos> It's winning!<eos> Open it. Doctor!<eos> - Doctor...<eos> - What?
Die well!<eos> It's the finish line!<eos> It's winning!<eos> Open it. Doctor!<eos> - Doctor...<eos> - What?<eos> It's Bill...<eos> Of course it's Bill.<eos> Fate and me, we have a thing.<eos> Hello, suits.
Never had a head office.<eos> But as far as I remember, there's a successful rebellion six months later.<eos> Corporate dominance in space is history, - and that about wraps it for capitalism.<eos> - Yay!<eos> Then the human race finds a whole new mistake...<eos> But that's another story.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> But you will.<eos> Laters!<eos> Laters... Never again.
There are survivors, a handful.<eos> I can't leave them.<eos> Course not.<eos> We found a hiding place.<eos> We might still be safe there.<eos> So what was it like, this monster?<eos> I don't know. We deserted.<eos> We were the ones who couldn't face it.<eos> Roman soldiers don't run, and we did.<eos> What?
Yeah.<eos> Well, where is he?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That creature killed him.<eos> That thing, where did it come from?<eos> It killed him?<eos> Yeah. He was covered in this, like... black slime.<eos> It knows where we are, and we'll all die here, in the dark.<eos> No-one is going to die!<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm ingratiating myself.<eos> Stop it. It's nauseating.<eos> It's called charm.<eos> I'm against it. I'm against charm.<eos> Yeah, we all know that.<eos> I said don't move!<eos> Did anybody hear that?<eos> Do you know what that sound was?<eos> What?
Marcus was hurt, like you, and the sunlight healed him in the end.<eos> I am feeling better.<eos> Good. Yeah, don't worry, Bill.<eos> Lucius'll look after you.<eos> Shut up, Cornelius!<eos> Right, listen, there's something I should explain.<eos> What?<eos> This is probably just a really difficult idea.<eos> I don't like men... that way.<eos> What?
Whoa, there they are.<eos> The lost Legion of the Ninth.<eos> Totally found them.<eos> Yeah, you totally did.<eos> Nardole, what happened to you?<eos> Oh, I'm blending in.<eos> Welcome to our land.<eos> Scotch.<eos> Drop your weapons.<eos> Oh, for goodness' sake!
We need to get out of here.<eos> Now!<eos> I know you're inclined to bear a grudge, so just remember I know about 10% of your secrets.<eos> The dark secrets.<eos> And I'm the only one in the TARDIS who knows where the tea cakes are.<eos> Kar. She's holding the gate.<eos> Remember.<eos> Her name is Kar.<eos> Kar!<eos> Kar.
You can't take on every fight.<eos> All right.<eos> I didn't know what really happened to the Ninth Legion.<eos> No, we were both wrong about that.<eos> They were never really missing.<eos> They've always been here.<eos> The Ninth Legion and the Keeper of the Gate.<eos> Seizing the day till the sun goes out.<eos> Holding back the dark.<eos> What?
Should I have stayed below decks?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's fine.<eos> She's supposed to be in the vault.<eos> How were the engines?<eos> Better than you deserve.<eos> You are naughty.<eos> Do you ever do basic maintenance?<eos> No, but I've got a plan for that.<eos> What? You.
I'll do my job, you do yours.<eos> Thing is, your job is to make it look like I screwed up the first time around.<eos> All I'm after is the truth.<eos> If you didn't make a mistake, then there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Uh, Ms. DeFranco, I'm Hayes Morrison.<eos> This is Franklin Cruz from the CIU.<eos> We would like to talk to you about Clark Sims.<eos> I need to see your credentials.<eos> Now his.
Were you living in the city in 2006?<eos> I was born and bred in Queens, been working for the utility company since 2005.<eos> Do you remember where you were August 24th and September 3rd of '06?<eos> Probably on my yacht in South Hampton.<eos> You'd have to ask my butler to know for sure.<eos> Maybe you kept a calendar.<eos> Best I can do is have you check with dispatch.<eos> Did you ever hear about the Black Orchid Killer, Joe?<eos> Detective Cestero.<eos> What?
That sounds promising.<eos> Except there's no record of exactly where he was in the city.<eos> Did they have GPS tracking on trucks back then?<eos> No, didn't start that until 2011.<eos> That doesn't alibi him out, either.<eos> Sometimes textbook theories don't pan out, Tess.<eos> I know, but Joe...<eos> he just doesn't fit the profile.<eos> He's not B.O.K.<eos> What?
Oh, so a needle in a huge haystack.<eos> Divide and conquer?<eos> - I need a break.<eos> - Me too.<eos> I'm gonna make an executive decision we take 20.<eos> Good by me.<eos> Donald Cutler was one of the witnesses who saw Joe outside of Marla Higgins' apartment, right?<eos> Yeah, I interviewed him.<eos> Yeah, he was one of the guys who called the tip line.<eos> Why?
Uh, no.<eos> I just wanted to say I did make a mistake on Clark Sims.<eos> Thanks for helping me fix it.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> Don't forget about Joe Kaplan.<eos> Kind of screwed up there, too.<eos> Still the same ball buster, huh?<eos> You know it.<eos> So... are we over it?<eos> - Our fight?
We leave him here, he dies.<eos> Do it!<eos> Your funeral, Doc.<eos> This isn't our smartest decision!<eos> Never stopped us before!<eos> - Ready? - Yeah!<eos> All right.<eos> News chopper must've followed us out here.<eos> At least we're not working in complete darkness.<eos> On three.
Easy, easy, easy. We're here to help.<eos> You're bleeding. Let me treat you.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - T.C.<eos> You're lucky, T.C. Most don't survive what you did.<eos> I'm Amira.<eos> Let me see your hand.<eos> - Leave it in or take it out?<eos> - Ah, take it.<eos> Thanks for the warning.
- All right, easy.<eos> Got him?<eos> I got him, I got him.<eos> Let me go!<eos> - Didn't realize you were back.<eos> - Yeah, it feels like I never left.<eos> Yeah, but you did and when the others find out you crossed early, you might get a matching shiner.<eos> Brave talk, doc.<eos> Where was all that courage when Topher got fired, huh?<eos> Thanks for your help.
You get to see what your little rebellion reaped.<eos> I had to hire temps to run this place.<eos> I haven't left, myself, in two days.<eos> I didn't make you fire Topher.<eos> No, incompetence and lack of leadership took care of that.<eos> If you wanna talk, let's talk.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here while you yell at me - like some whipping boy, all right?<eos> - What are you gonna do, Paul?<eos> Walk off?<eos> Again?

I just hope you know where you're standin'.<eos> What the hell are you thinking extubating a patient?<eos> We don't do that procedure without an order from a doctor.<eos> I called for a doctor...<eos> Dr. Rivera, any other doctor.<eos> No one came.<eos> - Well, then you physically go and get one.<eos> - I didn't have time.<eos> What if he lost his airway, huh?<eos> What then?
We'll approve the west entrance with<eos> - Prime Minister Aaronson.<eos> - No, no, no, the table shape.<eos> I spent three days getting both sides to agree to an oval table.<eos> This is a rectangle.<eos> - It can't be a rectangle.<eos> - That's just the diagram.<eos> The table will be oval.<eos> Can we confirm it's oval?<eos> The actual table.
Oh, hey, congratulations on NewsSource.<eos> You're officially trending online.<eos> I am?<eos> It's been, um... positive.<eos> Okay, that was a bad "um."<eos> What did that "um" mean?<eos> It hasn't been as focused on the peace deal as we'd like.<eos> Some pundit on Twitter's calling you Madam Sexy-tary.<eos> Could you get back in your crate?<eos> What?
I'm gonna need some coffee.<eos> Don't you have a car waiting?<eos> Don't you have a staff meeting?<eos> Yes.<eos> Frankie's hazelnut roast.<eos> Smells amazing.<eos> Yeah, she brought it back from Seattle.<eos> Get on it. It goes fast.<eos> Oh. Hey, Kevin.<eos> 'Sup?
Oh, my God, do you see that?<eos> I mean, even in my own house, I am appraised like a show pony.<eos> Okay.<eos> All I said was you looked hot.<eos> Alison, it's not a reality show!<eos> Fine.<eos> Forget I said anything.<eos> I'm gonna assume this is somehow different than when Dad was called "arm candy" by a magazine, and everybody was just okay with that.<eos> Yeah, it's different.<eos> Oh, hey.
She will.<eos> But only after she's won their trust.<eos> Keep me informed, Harold.<eos> I want to know when Elizabeth checks in.<eos> Smoll? I've tried him twice.<eos> Try again.<eos> I want to know the minute the transfer is complete.<eos> To get the WITSEC list, we need to get giannusa alone.<eos> We've got leverage over him once we do.<eos> What kind of leverage?
I placed Emma knightly in the harem so she could keep me posted as to their criminal activities.<eos> So what, she could tell you what they were planning to steal so you could steal it first?<eos> Something like that.<eos> If you already had someone inside, then why add me?<eos> Because Emma went silent.<eos> You're telling me she turned?<eos> Who is she anyway?<eos> Aram says her records have all been scrubbed.<eos> Yes.<eos> By MI6.
Will you describe for us what you've called the "Thanksgiving of Horror"?<eos> Well, it was a stormy afternoon, and Larry was staring out at the rain.<eos> I didn't know it at the time what he was thinking, but in hindsight, I'd say it was,<eos> "One day, I'm gonna throw Margaret through this window."<eos> "Throw Margaret through this window."<eos> _<eos> This is shard 142 of 429.<eos> This is shard 143 of 429.<eos> In your expert opinion, is the shatter pattern consistent with a Southern lady being thrown through the window?<eos> Yes. Especially shard 262.

Dr. Senior Jr., in your mind, is this clearly an act of murder?<eos> Mine peepern ainnevern peeped uh sickersite sinmy burr thinday. His peepern ainnevern... peeped uh sickersite... sinin burr thinday.<eos> Your witness.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Your Honor, the prosecution rests.<eos> Praise the Lord.<eos> Praise... the...<eos> Well, glad that's over.<eos> Anne, can I offer you another glass?<eos> Oh, just half.
Semen?<eos> Now, how would your semen be found at the crime scene?<eos> I think we all know how semen... makes its way into the world.<eos> This is not the first crime scene you've contaminated, is it?<eos> Uh, okay, so, I have a medical condition...<eos> So you contaminate every room you walk into?<eos> Is it fair to say you've got semen on your hands right now?<eos> Well, it's not fair, uh, but it is true.<eos> Ew. No further questions.<eos> Ohh, boy!
Confess to the world that you're the twisted monster that kidnapped and killed all these women, or you walk, and I'll hunt you down and I'll kill you.<eos> I don't know. Maybe the trunk of my car didn't send a clear enough message.<eos> Yeah, you remember me now, don't you?<eos> You're the one that kidnapped me.<eos> There you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hey, Bolan. I got a guy you might like for the bodega robbery on 81st.<eos> - Check it out.<eos> - Yeah. Isn't that your collar?<eos> Yeah, a real gem.
Ask her, she'll tell you. She's not a credible witness.<eos> Why, because she was in the nut house that her dad put her in to shut her up?<eos> - Her brother told her.<eos> - Then it's hearsay.<eos> Look, get a statement from the brother.<eos> Maybe that'll hold water.<eos> - Hey. Well, surgery went well, considering he had the wrong blood type on his ID card.<eos> - Huh. - He's lucky we caught it.<eos> - Is that Mr. Benson's sister?<eos> - Who? - The patient.
- Just the paper?<eos> Who comes up with the names of these serial killers anyways?<eos> Hell should I know?<eos> Betting he's not happy.<eos> You got the Zodiac Killer, the Grim Sleeper, and this guy's named after a bird.<eos> It's 2016... you think they'd come up with better names.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I was you, I wouldn't move a hair.<eos> Not a one.
Jamie's night started romantic in the bedroom, then things went south.<eos> Killer left angry, went across the street, found the nail gun.<eos> Came back and popped Jamie when he answered the door.<eos> Hey, you think we can get the killer's height from the angle of the nails?<eos> Sure, if you can tell me which of the 14 nails went in first.<eos> What can you tell me about STD 36?<eos> Nothing. But only because STD number one taught me some hard lessons.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Something?
Okay. We have to confirm that with your husband.<eos> Meaning, we have to tell him about the affair.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> I mean, can't you just confirm that I was with him?<eos> I'm sorry. We need to clear him as a suspect, too.<eos> Don't worry, Eleanor.<eos> Greg will vouch for you!<eos> He loves you!<eos> Ellie was at home with me that night.<eos> All night.
- Thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Well, don't let me interrupt.<eos> You guys... talk.<eos> No, I'm the one who's interrupting.<eos> I should go.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Great.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Ben.<eos> - You too.
- You too.<eos> Unless... You want to come in for a drink?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I could definitely use one.<eos> I see you redecorated.<eos> A... little.<eos> That's right.<eos> This used to be your house, too.<eos> For a while.
A... little.<eos> That's right.<eos> This used to be your house, too.<eos> For a while.<eos> You two live together?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm here most nights.<eos> And how long have you been...<eos> - A year.
That's right.<eos> This used to be your house, too.<eos> For a while.<eos> You two live together?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm here most nights.<eos> And how long have you been...<eos> - A year.<eos> - Two months.
I didn't see Troy as her type.<eos> Well, first of all, Troy's everyone's type, and secondly, she's gonna use him to kill her husband.<eos> - What?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You need to come home now.<eos> I hate being the sensible one.<eos> I can't.<eos> You're gonna have to cover for me.<eos> I'm... taking a personal day.<eos> What?
Sophie, pleasure to meet you.<eos> And, of course...<eos> - Ethan...<eos> - Hey, nice to meet you.<eos> Ethan Ward.<eos> Well, listen, thank you, guys, for seeing me on such short notice.<eos> Um, it's kind of an emergency.<eos> Last night, me and my entire Board of Directors had our personal information published online.<eos> - What?<eos> - Like what?
I couldn't help overhear you lying to my friend just now.<eos> Are you saying that if we go in the back, we won't find your secret stash?<eos> For cigars manufactured after 2014.<eos> Yes, it was...<eos> So, you have a choice...<eos> I can shut you down, or...<eos> Or what?<eos> You can tell me everything you know about this son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, could you help me break into Heather's apartment?<eos> What?
Raymond, darling.<eos> How are you?<eos> Are you well?<eos> Happy birthday to Arabella.<eos> They grow up so fast, don't they?<eos> I found the microphones, Margot.<eos> What kind of parents use their daughter to move on another family?<eos> For the record, that is exactly what I told her.<eos> Dad.<eos> For God sakes.
These are crime-scene photos, implicating an assassin named Willy Grace, who called you six minutes after he murdered her, according to these phone records.<eos> Bold presentation, but it'll never hold up in a court of law.<eos> What about the court of public opinion?<eos> Your press packet.<eos> Bold presentation.<eos> And we made sure that our people put one of those on every chair in this room.<eos> I think the media's gonna have more than a few questions for you.<eos> And not just about the property.<eos> Get these two out of here now!<eos> What?
I'll take it.<eos> Thanks, Daddy.<eos> Now it's a party.<eos> First, there's Scotty Beene.<eos> Taggart's been cutting him out of the profits for the last several months.<eos> Scotty, right?<eos> Ted.<eos> - Have we met?<eos> - East Coast operations.<eos> Hell of a month, right?
Who told you that?<eos> Seems you're not very popular, Raymond.<eos> Not only are your people cross with you, but most of them have defected.<eos> - Defected?<eos> - To the Kensington Firm.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> You watch your step, little girl.<eos> You take what I love, I'll take what you love.<eos> Raymond, father to father, if you come anywhere near my daughter again, I will do more than break your wrist.<eos> My wrist?

She's banging Tad, by the way.<eos> What?<eos> I just wanted to say thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For going along with all of this.<eos> As if I had a choice.<eos> And for trying to protect me.<eos> Fat lot of good that did.<eos> And for letting Eddie and me spend the night.<eos> What?
So, how did Hook pop the question?<eos> On board a romantic cruise on the Jolly Roger?<eos> Did he make Smee and the rest of the crew serenade you?<eos> We may never know, because I kind of said yes before he had a chance.<eos> I cannot wait to tell your father that we have a wedding to plan.<eos> About that... we're going to wait a little while before we start planning.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, Gideon's still out there, and even though I defeated him once, we don't really know what he's up to, and I don't feel like I can focus on anything else until I've really dealt with that.<eos> Actually, you're going to have to.<eos> What now?
With this.<eos> This is one of your mother's spell books, that I've kept hidden from you.<eos> It has a map inside that will lead us to a powerful object that can help find Snow White.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Wait. Isn't that...<eos> Page 23... the page that magically appeared to me with what I thought could be an ending to my story with Robin... a happy... ending.<eos> Inside, it was just a cruel twist of fate, showing me an ending that could never be.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> It means the Evil Queen has found him... the other Robin, that is... and she wants me to know that she'll hurt him unless I face her.<eos> "One last time."
It will lead you to gaze upon the person you love most.<eos> The fairy told me about the man with the lion tattoo.<eos> You could use it to find him.<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> I always thought you were the one person on my side.<eos> Regina, don't you see that I am?<eos> Enough!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting what I came for.<eos> My revenge.
I was hoping you might have room for one more.<eos> Well, then.<eos> Captain Hook is always welcome on the Nautilus.<eos> We push off at nightfall.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> I couldn't let anything happen to you.<eos> He's not the one you should be worried about.<eos> So that's your plan.<eos> You're going to separate us.<eos> Then what?
I thought there were things they wouldn't do.<eos> Well, they're doing the very best they can to track Morozov.<eos> Something's turned up.<eos> He's making a trip to Illinois, the Land of Lincoln.<eos> - When?<eos> - 29th.<eos> To think they once had a Lincoln.<eos> Now a Reagan.<eos> She's not there.<eos> What?
Never gave anything to their other kids they didn't give me, too.<eos> The mom, she was always worried about me.<eos> But they were all so proud of themselves that they took in a boat person. Yeah. - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> Uh, you just seemed really spaced out.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm- - I'm kind of in a fight with my mom.<eos> About what?

I had a great time the other night.<eos> So did I.<eos> So, you want to, um--<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Great.<eos> Saturday at 7:00?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Well, I, um- - I got to shower and get to work.<eos> - Nice meeting you, Philip.<eos> - You, too.
We say whatever we want, right?<eos> If I want to say I hate Russia, I can say it.<eos> - I hate Russia!<eos> - Loesha.<eos> If I said it in Soviet Union, I would be put in jail.<eos> You know how easy it is to go to jail in Soviet Union?<eos> I've heard.<eos> My father, he spent 15 years in prison camp.<eos> 15 years.<eos> For what?

So, where to next?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Someplace nice, but not too nice so there's room for growth.<eos> What about one of those Bread Oven places?<eos> There's a new one on Pennsylvania Avenue.<eos> I took a date there last week.<eos> And?<eos> They have a see-through grand piano.<eos> What else you need to know?<eos> What?
It's a good thing.<eos> She'll get it.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Compared to this,<eos> Matthew Beeman won't seem so important.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> - Hi. - All clear.<eos> - Henry here?<eos> - Nope.<eos> What?
Compared to this,<eos> Matthew Beeman won't seem so important.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> - Hi. - All clear.<eos> - Henry here?<eos> - Nope.<eos> What?<eos> Oh.<eos> We think the U.S. government is planning to attack the Soviet Union's grain supply.<eos> What?
Here you go.<eos> Hello, Anatoli.<eos> We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> In case you can't tell from our suits.<eos> We're sorry to disturb your lunch.<eos> We only want to talk to you for two or three minutes.<eos> We know you work for Aeroflot.<eos> This is an organization that's very interesting to us.<eos> We were hoping you'd be willing to get together with us at some other time, in some other place, and maybe, y...<eos> What?
I'm sorry, but I can't.<eos> What kind of bugs are these, huh?<eos> What do they do?<eos> Randy?<eos> We don't... it doesn't have a name.<eos> W-we derived it from Sitodiplosis mosellana.<eos> - What does it do?<eos> - It's a pest.<eos> It eats crops.<eos> - What kind of crops?
It's-It's not that many.<eos> It's... it's complicated.<eos> - Do you know anything about bugs?<eos> - Where are you sending them?<eos> I-I ca... I can tell you.<eos> It's... it's in... in my Rolodex.<eos> Can I go to my desk, please?<eos> Here.<eos> - When does the next shipment go out?<eos> - Two weeks.
I'm not! I don't know!<eos> I've been doing well.<eos> Some of the other kids screw around, but I don't.<eos> Maybe I laugh sometimes. - Henry.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm calling him today.<eos> Fine.<eos> You don't put enough jam on this.<eos> Henry!<eos> What?
_<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Hmm?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay...<eos> Oh! No! Oh!
I'm coming back in a few days.<eos> I have a work thing in the city.<eos> Well, lucky for you, you just ran into the Carob-Gorp-Eating- Hiking-Expert of Topeka.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ben Stobert.<eos> Brenda Neill.<eos> It was all her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - To beer.

I thought he hated religion.<eos> Uh, h-he did.<eos> But he was pretty great on class and poverty.<eos> Are these your notes?<eos> Mm-hmm. It's from college.<eos> Here.<eos> "Labor is therefore not voluntary but coerced.<eos> It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need.<eos> It is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it."<eos> What?
Can I see you then? Hmm... let me think about it.<eos> Yes, please. Agent Beeman.<eos> Sorry, I only have a few minutes.<eos> Uh, that's all I need.<eos> You remember three years ago when that KGB officer was killed...<eos> Vladimir Kosygin?<eos> He was kidnapped by a group of FBI agents and then shot in cold blood.<eos> For now, it doesn't really matter who took Kosygin or why.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Once.
Sometimes we need to get to know different people.<eos> So, who are you getting to know?<eos> Um... a scientist...<eos> Someone who knows a lot about this stuff.<eos> So, he doesn't know who you really are?<eos> No.<eos> So who do you say you are?<eos> A salesperson.<eos> What do you sell?<eos> Women's clothing.
Welcome to John F. Kennedy International Airport.<eos> Taxi.<eos> Going through his things.<eos> If she even looked nervous...<eos> How did you leave it?<eos> I told her it was crazy and dangerous and she could never do it again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did she get it?<eos> I hope so.<eos> What?

If there was something on him with a parishioner...<eos> - Elizabeth...<eos> - No, no...<eos> I know, but it's interesting, right?<eos> I mean, who knows what goes on with the good pastor? What about Kansas?<eos> It was fine.<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's...<eos> What?
I need to see Doctor Walters.<eos> Repeat that?<eos> This is... Stacey McAllister.<eos> I need to see Doctor Walters.<eos> Hello?<eos> Call back tomorrow-- 4:00 PM.<eos> Smells good.<eos> Reserve judgment till after.<eos> What are we having?<eos> Fatta.
And I thought studying was the key to success.<eos> You and me both.<eos> You know,<eos> I had a crush on Matthew when I first met him.<eos> He had a lot of hair and played guitar.<eos> And now, he likes me back.<eos> I think I was sort of hoping that with all of the garbage in my life that-- that he would make me feel better.<eos> Being with him only makes me feel worse, though.<eos> I don't know if it's because... Matthew's not right for me or...<eos> What?
- Hi.<eos> Is everything okay? Yeah.<eos> Is... everything okay with you?<eos> Y- - Yeah.<eos> I miss you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I've been, um-- been having these memories of my childhood.<eos> Of- - Of what?<eos> My father bringing home food and clothing.<eos> S-So good things?
Did he bring home other things?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Yes?<eos> This es-- is Stacey McAllister.<eos> There is an appointment available tomorrow-- 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> Uh, say again?<eos> 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> All right?<eos> Y-Yes.<eos> To old scars and new skin.
There is an appointment available tomorrow-- 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> Uh, say again?<eos> 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> All right?<eos> Y-Yes.<eos> To old scars and new skin.<eos> How long were you in for?<eos> 12 years.<eos> You? Seven.<eos> Collateral damage?
Nah.<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> As long as he doesn't root against the Kings, he's in the clear.<eos> All right. Okay, see you tomorrow.<eos> Thank you. Good night, guys.<eos> You want to get something to eat?<eos> No, thanks. You want to go to the mall or something?<eos> Not really.<eos> Are you tired of me?<eos> What?
I'm just tired.<eos> And old.<eos> How's the harder math going?<eos> Easy.<eos> You'll be running the travel agency soon.<eos> We'll be working for you.<eos> I'm not really interested in the travel-agency business, Dad.<eos> He's not interested in the travel business.<eos> I guess he has bigger plans.<eos> Like what?
I'm in fashion.<eos> I'm not that deep.<eos> I don't buy that for a minute.<eos> No, really, I'm, like, barely thinking about anything right now.<eos> Really?<eos> I am.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Because even though you're in bed with a naked woman, I bet you there is some part of your brain that's just thinking about your super wheat, or whatever it is.<eos> Stick out your tongue.<eos> What?

I can't tell you how thrilled the Centre is.<eos> Good.<eos> Anything on the greenhouse?<eos> Yes.<eos> We should have something within the week.<eos> All right.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I have to talk to you.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> What?
Murder board!<eos> Murder board!<eos> Murder board!<eos> - That one's on me. - Murder board!<eos> Murder board!<eos> Mr. Davis.<eos> May I have a word?<eos> How in the world did you get past security?<eos> They don't normally allow your kind into this country club.<eos> What?
Oh, I know Jeremiah had something to do with this.<eos> It's time to take that bastard down.<eos> I don't know, Josh.<eos> He kinda runs this town.<eos> I need this, Dwayne.<eos> I gave up all my cases in New York for this, so I'm not backing down.<eos> I'm going to stick my Northeastern nose wherever I want.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Holy [bleep]!<eos> Oh, my...
- Summer?<eos> Do you mind if I have a go at it?<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure.<eos> Sure.<eos> Give me your best shot.<eos> Mr. Henderson, this is an e-mail that you sent your trainer/lover, Alfonso.<eos> Would you mind reading it, please?<eos> "Dear Alfonso, I cannot wait to see you tonight.<eos> I'm picking up... a bottle of Pinot."<eos> What a hilarious joke.
!<eos> What are you, a sailor?<eos> Answer my question!<eos> Why won't you answer my mother-[bleep] question?<eos> !<eos> So...<eos> I've decided not to take the stand.<eos> Let's put down what we know.<eos> Margaret called Jeremiah four times between 3:52 and 4:19.<eos> So, what if, at 5:00 P.M.,
- Right. - All right, yeah.<eos> Now, the thing is, because of what they working on, I can't figure out how to get there.<eos> - Now, I see Arlington right here. - Uh-huh.<eos> _<eos> - I'm gonna try and get a Lotus approved for the office.<eos> Um, could be a life-- life-changer.<eos> Good.<eos> Can I, um--<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> What?
We can't promise asylum.<eos> And you're right, there are risks, big risks.<eos> You get caught, you could spend the rest of your life in a Soviet prison or worse.<eos> I have to know my son will be safe.<eos> We can't guarantee his safety if that happens.<eos> No one can.<eos> We'll do everything we can to keep you safe.<eos> There's a lot we can do to prevent bad things from happening.<eos> Look...<eos> What?
That's it, you're not gonna argue with me?<eos> Do you want me to argue with you?<eos> No!<eos> Look, what do you want me to say? !<eos> I don't know!<eos> Something.<eos> Look, I'm not like my dad, okay? If I-<eos> - If I did something wrong, then I'll fix it.<eos> I can't be your girlfriend anymore.<eos> What? I just-
Let's go get it.<eos> _<eos> I didn't think he was like that.<eos> You didn't buy his act, anyway.<eos> No, but there was something about him that-- I thought that maybe...<eos> You liked him.<eos> No, I didn't like him.<eos> It's okay to care.<eos> No, it isn't, Philip.<eos> Not for me.
I didn't ask questions.<eos> Well, it was bad.<eos> It was worse than you could imagine.<eos> People were shot, worked to death in the camps.<eos> Some were counterrevolutionaries.<eos> But some...<eos> Some hadn't done anything.<eos> Just people.<eos> I did it too.<eos> Why?
Yeah.<eos> It just... came up.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Wouldn't it be a nice world if nobody had to do this. Mnh, mnh!<eos> Go left!<eos> Go left!<eos> - Back off back off back off!<eos> - Shit.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Bye bye, Rich.
- Not say it right?<eos> - No.<eos> Like, um... like he's a lady's man?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Women like him.<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> You too.
Except of Yuri, the GRU officer.<eos> Nobody likes him.<eos> Yuri?<eos> Yuri Tkachuk.<eos> He thinks he's a big man and he knows everything but he know nothing.<eos> Mm. So it's not that different from the FBI, then?<eos> Do you have a Yuri too?<eos> Every office has a Yuri.<eos> Where did you tell your coworkers you were going today?<eos> Mm. Just lunch.
Everybody go out to lunch sometimes.<eos> You need to be able to tell them where you ate, what you ate, who you ate with, and why you picked that place to eat.<eos> But... nobody ask me all of that.<eos> You have to be prepared if they do ask.<eos> You don't want to appear nervous.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where do you usually eat?<eos> I like pizza.<eos> At Armand's.<eos> - On Wisconsin?
If someone... if someone was to go after me again like... like in the parking lot...<eos> It's just going to take time.<eos> But we'll keep practicing.<eos> And you're doing really well.<eos> You are.<eos> I'm sick of being scared.<eos> I know.<eos> I know how hard it is.<eos> I was scared like that.<eos> For a long time.
Things have been good. It's Deirdre, leave a message at the beep.<eos> Hi Deirdre, it's Gus.<eos> Listen, um, I just wanted to call, and...<eos> I know I haven't handled things, um, perfectly, but... you're a really terrific woman, and I-I really like you, and I know you know that... and I-I just didn't want to get off onto the wrong foot<eos> Ah, listen<eos> I don't know how to say this... but I'm married.<eos> And things haven't been going well, and... it's complicated... and I didn't want...<eos> Hi.<eos> Thanks for picking up.<eos> ... At least Evgheniya.
Muj?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> See the blood there?<eos> Is that all blood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Christ.<eos> I've never seen anything like that.<eos> ♪ may God bless and keep you always ♪<eos> Oh, man.
He's vulnerable.<eos> Let us use the tape against him and get him working with us against them.<eos> Think it through. Hello?<eos> Tuan?<eos> Tuan? Uh, just a sandwich.<eos> Um, roast beef, lettuce, onion, mustard, on a roll.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Evgheniya.
All right. I was just trying to help.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't think I can do it.<eos> - Of course I do. - I knew it!<eos> I knew you'd have a go, Celeste!<eos> God!<eos> Oh, I just...<eos> Don't do this today.<eos> You promised Mum.<eos> The kids.
Don't know, I blacked out.<eos> Bea's daughter is here.<eos> I know we're in lockdown, but under the circumstances...<eos> Debbie... Debbie's here?<eos> She's here?<eos> She's in reception.<eos> You want to see your daughter?<eos> You tell me what happened.<eos> Just give me a name, Bea.<eos> Hello, sexy.
Look, maybe another time, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> Home delivery.<eos> Oh...<eos> Fletch, I'm so sorry.<eos> I left you a message.<eos> Didn't you get it?<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry. No. No.
It's going to be all right.<eos> It's not going to be fucking all right. Nothing's all right.<eos> Yeah, the satnav is down.<eos> There's no signal.<eos> Yeah, don't worry.<eos> Do you get back much?<eos> Press trying to get through to the quay. Sorry, sir.<eos> You have to go right round the creek.<eos> Really?<eos> Sorry, sir.
An hour and a half.<eos> Ricky has been driving me for six years now.<eos> I can't remember the last time he missed a day.<eos> Thank you for offering to fill in, Mr. Diggle.<eos> It's my pleasure, Mrs. Queen. Believe me.<eos> Are you sure my son won't miss you?<eos> He said he was staying in for the evening.<eos> And you believed him?<eos> It's been my experience when your son wants some alone time, there's not much I can do to stop him.<eos> Hmm. Much to my chagrin.
- Women.<eos> - Can't live with them...<eos> [Laughs] Can't afford to live without them.<eos> You know, Neil, I really appreciate you giving me the check back.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Hey, no worries, Elliot.<eos> Look, here's to your first big fight with the fiancee.<eos> [Laughs] I remember our first big fight.<eos> I was heading out for 'nam.<eos> 'Nam?
It's for people of all ages. Don't look so concerned.<eos> I'm just one of a whole community of guys who are devoted to My Little Pony.<eos> We're called Bronies.<eos> And we get together, we dress up, we Brony out.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> I don't know about that. Ah, it's just 'cause it's new to you.<eos> Look, it's all positive.<eos> We celebrate My Little Pony's beautiful ethos of friendship, caring, learning to value people different than ourselves.<eos> You're against all that?<eos> Some of it.
I wanted to thank you.<eos> - Ah. You saw the sign.<eos> - Mm-hmm. You didn't have to do that.<eos> Our agreement stipulates Darby Pearson, not Pearson Darby.<eos> Our agreement also stipulates a 51/49 percentage structure.<eos> And this is your way of showing me that you think of it as 50/50.<eos> - Merely a gesture.<eos> - Ah. Heck of a gesture.<eos> How would you propose to a woman?<eos> A woman?
Yep. Yeah.<eos> You know, it would be awesome to have six legs.<eos> You are beyond weird, Markley.<eos> I'm just saying, it would be awesome to climb up walls and jump over buildings and stuff.<eos> Okay, just stop.<eos> I owe you big time, bro.<eos> If you hadn't have smoked that Mech, I'd be lying right next to them poor dudes.<eos> You know I got you.<eos> It's true. You saved his life.<eos> And mine.
Okay...<eos> Sadler, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> First, you're gonna get me a coffee.<eos> Then you're gonna undo all this mumbo jumbo, none of this was even approved by head office.<eos> This'll save the company money...<eos> Look, I know what it's like to be young and ambitious and think you have the answers to everything, but you can't go messing with the system just because you think you have a better way of doing things.<eos> But I'm telling you... No look, I'm telling you to reset the network to the way that it was and do the job that I hired you to do.<eos> I can un-hire you just as easily.<eos> And that coffee? Make it black.<eos> Incredible.
You know something, I'd be careful if I were you. 'Cause someone might just just come along and poach him away.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Have a good day, sir.<eos> Alec, when you're done with this customer can you drop by my office?<eos> My printer's jammed.<eos> Printer jams, how novel.<eos> You know there's no paper in the future?<eos> Or should I say no future in paper.<eos> Drop by for a chat unless you've made up your mind.<eos> Incredible.
He's a good cop.<eos> I'll be the judge of that, when I meet him.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> You should go.<eos> You ready to lay down some cover?<eos> Deal me in.<eos> Yes, everyone.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Escher?
Imagine that there is.<eos> If you found that proof, what would you do next?<eos> If I had found it, then that means there would actually be something.<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, you can stay sorry.<eos> In the car.<eos> You're not coming in.<eos> Kiera, you're trying to stop another murder.<eos> Dozens more.
I just think the inspector isn't giving this full consideration.<eos> Okay, put it on my desk and I'll have him review it.<eos> - Like it's gonna make a difference.<eos> - Thanks...<eos> - She alright?<eos> - That's a good question.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> They're taking out Dillon.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
You might be a lifetime or two ahead of me.<eos> I'll save you a seat in nirvana.<eos> It says "indescribable beauty."<eos> Well, that's-- that's more like it.<eos> Watch your head.<eos> Evan was right, you know?<eos> About Ryan.<eos> Someone did call that tip to the FBI ten years ago.<eos> It was you.<eos> Why?
I see. And did you keep the receipt?<eos> What?<eos> (Tessa) It was easy to imagine my life without Ryan.<eos> Too easy.<eos> So should we go to the Ingmar Bergman retrospective or check out the Matisse exhibit at the Met?<eos> Let's do both.<eos> It was inevitable.<eos> Ryan and I were destined for different things, and it was only a matter of time.<eos> But it wasn't that time.<eos> Not yet.
You flee this compound, and you flee your protection,<eos> How long have you known I worked for them?<eos> Long enough to know you're the only one that could help me.<eos> You're the only that can help the human race, ascend.<eos> Lauren. - You're insane.<eos> - We both know that's not true.<eos> Deep down in your heart you understand me, and what I want.<eos> Listen me, I brought you here, so you can extract the stem cells from the strongest Fae I could find,<eos> - and implant them...<eos> - ...into you.
You were supposed to be helping me meet a guy, not finding one for yourself.<eos> When did you even have time to ask him out?<eos> When you were putting on your lip gloss.<eos> That was a diversion tactic on my part.<eos> Frankly, you were kind of already wearing too much.<eos> Why would you do that to me?<eos> I've always wanted what other people want.<eos> You take something that's available... who wants that?<eos> Take something from someone... value.<eos> Unbelievable.
We are so sorry to hear that, Katherine.<eos> Losing James, Maryann's dad was... was the hardest thing that we have ever faced.<eos> Still facing.<eos> Hi, Dr. Young.<eos> Hello, Maryann.<eos> I should be getting back to Andy.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Maybe soon I can go out to play with Maryann.<eos> Her grandparents and I agreed it's probably not a good idea.<eos> Why?
My mom isn't gonna like this.<eos> Open it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They were my dad's when he was a kid. Okay.<eos> Get the phone from my room.<eos> Wait, wait. Can't we just play catch in the porch?<eos> Well, I don't think you'd be able to explain a broken window.<eos> My mom said that you wouldn't be coming by anymore.<eos> She told my grandmother I should leave you alone.<eos> - Why?
See you in hell, Stan.<eos> Rossignol!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> Every man for himself!<eos> You came to help me.<eos> I finally realized the importance of family.<eos> And I wanted to tell you I'm proud of you, son.<eos> You're a good guy.<eos> Because of you.
Yeah, he got but the one leg.<eos> He came that time to Sunday dinner at Bo's?<eos> He got drunk, flipped his old Plymouth right in front of the house.<eos> I remember.<eos> Well, he sobered up after that, found Jesus.<eos> Runs a little no-tell motel, kind with the free HBO but no ice.<eos> Has a little lay congregation out back.<eos> Ellen May wants to be done whoring, he might give her a chance at honest work, cleaning rooms and whatnot.<eos> If she doesn't like what he's preaching, there's plenty of other churches in Boiling Springs.<eos> Whorehouses, too.
What's up, buddy?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Listen, about tonight, I...<eos> Yeah, I was hoping you could take maybe me and Dylan to the batting cages?<eos> The batting cages?<eos> You and Dylan-- who's Dylan?<eos> He's my homeboy, kind of.<eos> He's epically badass.<eos> And he's really into the batting cages, so I kind of promised him you'd take us.<eos> Uh, Jeannie?
You had quite a few nice base hits in there tonight.<eos> Baseball's not really my thing.<eos> No?<eos> But... Dylan really liked you, huh?<eos> I guess.<eos> Think he thought I was cool, too?<eos> Having been around a decent number of guys, I can tell you with confidence that your friend Dylan is a douche bag.<eos> And you, you're, like, the best.<eos> And he should be so lucky as to have you as a friend or whatever.<eos> Thanks, Jeannie.
And it belonged to my dad.<eos> So, um... This whole setup is what, payback for what happened to their father?<eos> You can't do anything against the Ryans.<eos> They will hurt you or Declan... Or Carl.<eos> Amanda, promise me.<eos> Enjoy, Conrad. They're imported straight from Cuba.<eos> That's very kind of you, but completely unnecessary.<eos> Yes.<eos> Jason?<eos> - Oh, what a delight.
She's completely cut off from us. Savannah: Ugh.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Work!<eos> Amanda, are you okay? Um.<eos> Yeah.<eos> (Sighs) I'm fine.<eos> Amanda: Hey, Eddie, since we're alone and nobody can see us, i have something toconfesstoyou that you can never, ever tell anybody, okay?<eos> Melissa: Zooming in.<eos> I love...<eos> Me? No.
Once a whore, always a whore.<eos> You work for me.<eos> I own you.<eos> Bitch!<eos> I just wanted to be with Jonah.<eos> He was going to give me the life I'd dreamed of, help me become the person I really am.<eos> I couldn't let Jack take that away from me.<eos> You understand, don't you?<eos> I don't, no.<eos> Poor guy.
That was the lab.<eos> Bruce definitely fired a gun at some point.<eos> There's residue on the sheets and on the boots.<eos> We need to get him to the station.<eos> Biotic decomposition is slower in the winter months, and since her body wasn't immersed in the river, it wasn't deteriorated, so I can tell you a little more than I thought.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I knew Katie.<eos> She and my daughter were in class together.<eos> We're sorry.<eos> Me, too.
You know, there are better places to have this conversation.<eos> We have time.<eos> We always have had time for each other.<eos> You also seem to have exhausted the patience of the local law enforcement.<eos> Seems Roman Godfrey had quite the night.<eos> It's the White Tower.<eos> There's something happening there.<eos> Pryce is playing liar's poker.<eos> Francis Pullman saw his hand, drove a titanium syringe three inches into his temporal lobe.<eos> - And Rumancek?
B.T. Dubs, I was so sorry to hear about your breakup with Remington Steele.<eos> Though there really wasn't enough room<eos> - in your sidecar for both of us.<eos> - Hello, Nolan.<eos> Hey, buddy. Mm.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You two...<eos> A fake up?
Mom, you're not interfering with anything.<eos> Please just sit down and eat with us, please?<eos> I'm gonna have my dinner in my room.<eos> You're not gonna eat with us, grandma?<eos> No, but I am going to come in and say good night to my baby boy later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I got the donu, even though you told me- good!<eos> Listen, I saw mark. - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, I saw him right outside.<eos> I, uh-- Okay, sorry.
This is a wagyu filet with a mousseline of smoked chanterelle mushrooms and black garlic.<eos> Oh, it is so good.<eos> Oh, that's so good. Mm.<eos> Nice pairing as well.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Do you want to eat out there or something? - No, no, no.<eos> - You don't like it in here?<eos> - I'm just, um--<eos> - You hot?
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Good luck. - Okay.<eos> Beautiful family you have.<eos> They're something, aren't they?<eos> I'm, uh, headed to the airport.<eos> And I wanted to-- can you give this to your nephew, the--the kid who doesn't look at anybody?<eos> - Max?
- Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Good luck. - Okay.<eos> Beautiful family you have.<eos> They're something, aren't they?<eos> I'm, uh, headed to the airport.<eos> And I wanted to-- can you give this to your nephew, the--the kid who doesn't look at anybody?<eos> - Max?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, Max.
Let's just drink some more. How about that?<eos> Oh, man!<eos> A little more.<eos> What do you got going on here?<eos> Can I see this for a second?<eos> Let me see. Why?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, this is not good.<eos> This is gonna be-- this is gonna end up horrible.<eos> Why?
Yeah, but she wasn't all that interesting till after she was 5.<eos> You know, aren't you the one who's always saying illegal immigrants are breaking the law, hence the word "illegal"?<eos> I know, but he's part of the Outdoor Man family.<eos> He's practically part of our family.<eos> Gosh, remember that time that he dressed up like the Easter Bunny for the kids?<eos> Tripped over the garden hose on the way out, head popped off.<eos> Mandy to this day thinks rabbits have Mexicans inside of them.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I think you have a lot of Mexican inside you.<eos> - Why?
Just let me in.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> I don't blame anybody.<eos> It just happened.<eos> This happened.<eos> It's my problem to solve.<eos> Why can't you understand that?<eos> Because you said that we'd do it together.<eos> You said that we couldn't control the future, but no matter what happened, the only thing that mattered-- the only thing-- was that we faced it together.<eos> Not this.
Is it wonder that a man strong of desire would not be tempted to taste such ripe offering?<eos> Take lesson and remove yourself from fucking sight.<eos> Yes, Domina.<eos> We have not yet procured enough horses.<eos> I will not have cavalry found lacking in moment of need.<eos> What has happened?<eos> Nothing of concern, apologies.<eos> Break words, and find comfort in how they are received.<eos> I was attending Caesar as commanded...<eos> Caesar?

A thing that could be forgiven in light of youth.<eos> Yet your men falling to retreat does not so easily slip from concern.<eos> I ordered them to stand ground.<eos> Yet they fled.<eos> Because they feared the enemy more than their commanders.<eos> A false assumption we must see corrected.<eos> What punishment would you have me inflict?<eos> One to stand warning.<eos> That death at the hands of Spartacus pales against the wrath of the House of Crassus.<eos> Decimation?
Everything will be as it should, little master.<eos> Everything will be as it should...<eos> Apologies.<eos> You mistake intent.<eos> No.<eos> You mistake mine.<eos> He took something from me.<eos> And I would have something in return...<eos> Stop this...<eos> Tiberius --
You cannot do this.<eos> It is already done.<eos> It is the rarest of things, to see a man that honors his words.<eos> Stay beyond agreed upon hour, and you shall know the bitter truth of it.<eos> May the gods grant all that you deserve, mighty Crassus.<eos> As they have granted Heracleo.<eos> Come, my love.<eos> There are many wonders beyond these walls<eos> You wish to break words?<eos> Tiberius.
The citizens of this fair city were all laid to grass by rebellion's fury.<eos> Not all.<eos> All of note.<eos> What of the Aedile's wife?<eos> She has left these walls, never to return. You would claim entire fucking city for yourself?<eos> A wise man does not fight for glory alone.<eos> The Senate will not easily swallow bitter news of such greed.<eos> Greed is but a word jealous men inflict upon the ambitious.<eos> They will be made to see past it and oblige us in the spoils of war.<eos> Us?
What punishment would you have me inflict?<eos> He took something from me.<eos> And I would have something in return.<eos> If errant word falls from mouth, only suffering will follow.<eos> Come, my love.<eos> She stands a Roman.<eos> I stand nothing but a slave.<eos> You will regain sense.<eos> It is you who has no sense.<eos> Donar!
I will see the Senate cast you out for laying hands upon honored member --<eos> You... will do... as I... fucking... command!<eos> Marcus.<eos> Return to Rome. Speak of this, or any word against me... and I shall devote fortune towards your death in darkness of night.<eos> See him upon his horse.<eos> And second legion set to purpose towards Spartacus.<eos> Give word to stand ready to move upon a moments notice.<eos> We must not fall to sense of comfort.<eos> I do not favor fleeing like rabbits at imagined footfall of hunter.<eos> Nor I.
The law is gonna change, Jeannie.<eos> Unless it doesn't.<eos> Well, it will, because politicos won't be able to resist the potential tax revenues.<eos> Unless they can!<eos> Uh, you know, Jeannie, I've actually been doing a lot of reading on this...<eos> Oh, well, if you've been doing reading, then I'll shut up.<eos> Uh, would you?<eos> Because that would be great.<eos> Listen, I know that you have been spending a lot of time with little babies, and that that's super hard, and God bless mothers, but for those of us that have been in the grown-up world, what you need to realize okay, Jeannie, uh, Jeannie... Is that it's unprecedented...<eos> Ah-ah, Jeannie, Jeannie.
Make him feel very special.<eos> I'm sure we can find time in the schedule.<eos> - Let's give him a few more days.<eos> - We have less than a week, sir.<eos> I wouldn't wait any later than Friday.<eos> We can make Friday work, sir.<eos> Well, let's see if he's available.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Give me your phone.<eos> - Why?
- He actually got up?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> He got up.<eos> Is there any way of getting a scan of his brain?<eos> You're looking at everything i've got.<eos> We're in a tent.<eos> Practically everyone's gone.<eos> We're moving out.<eos> And this is all with a robot?<eos> Unbelievable.
Did a number on you, huh?<eos> Stay here.<eos> Jesus. Look at his eye.<eos> Yeah, it's ugly, but it's good for us.<eos> Good for us how?<eos> Well, Bello's burning his own lieutenants.<eos> It means he's convinced we didn't sell him out to Bobby moi.<eos> Come on.<eos> Future reference, man, I like this place much better than your warehouse.<eos> You and me both.
Like I should talk.<eos> I've been so pissed at Teddy. Okay, Teddy isn't lording his power over you the way Dixon is with me.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> He's trying to make me use Shane's sister as our surrogate.<eos> Wait, Shane has a sister?<eos> Exactly!<eos> I've never heard of her either.<eos> Now he's trying to jam her down my throat.<eos> "Rand Gunn is coming tomorrow. Time to step it up, Ade.<eos> D."
I sure hope my performance doesn't disappoint you.<eos> I have something very special planned.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Third and long for the Hollywood Vines.<eos> With just 13 seconds left to play, this is it, folks!<eos> All right, they're leaving a huge hole in the middle.<eos> T.O., you work the sideline, I'll hit you in the end zone.<eos> All right?<eos> On one.<eos> Ready?
You are aware that you can't question a juvenile without a parent present?<eos> I... made sure not to ask a single question.<eos> Um, I was very careful, and I recorded the entire conversation.<eos> That's a technicality.<eos> You're playing with fire.<eos> Being raped-that could give Kat a motive for murder.<eos> Okay, the victim was in possession of date-rape drugs. Kat was raped. Let's do the math here, people.<eos> She doesn't know who raped her.<eos> - Who else has she told?<eos> - Just me and the mother.
These men have all been classified as "unlawful combatants" by the AUMF.<eos> Until we can establish that they're not a threat to national security, they're not going anywhere.<eos> Put him back.<eos> Just the person I wanted to see.<eos> What is going on?<eos> I thought the evidence cleared these guys.<eos> The DNA, the fingerprints, it's all too neat.<eos> I've been burned too many times trying to bring this man to justice.<eos> There's only one person that I know I can trust anymore:<eos> You.
For thinking you could live in a world without my tender, loving care.<eos> Finally! Where have you been?<eos> Come on... her! Get her out of here!<eos> If your heart weren't so small, you'd be dead.<eos> Let's go, ma'am.<eos> I wish you were dead.<eos> You have to leave.<eos> I'm going to the police. I'm gonna confess.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna believe?<eos> You or the victim here?
Drafted in the first round in '09, led New York in scoring last two years.<eos> Incredible agility.<eos> And his killer's on the loose, so maybe we should be discussing that.<eos> If it was Picasso who was lying here, we'd be discussing art.<eos> Looks like he got beat up pretty bad.<eos> Injury to the back of the head.<eos> Bloodstain on the bench right there.<eos> He fell back on the ball, hit his head on the bench?<eos> There's going to be a list of enemies a mile long on this one.<eos> Why?
You know, I don't know who you think you are--<eos> My moniker is Nigel Alexander Nesbitt.<eos> Well, Nigel, when you impugn the life-affirming muds of Baden-Baden, you're on the precipice of the equivalent of someone taking a shit on the royal muds of England.<eos> Ah, Harvey. I was hoping we might have a moment alone.<eos> So was I.<eos> I wanted to run something by you.<eos> - This is a lawsuit.<eos> - Three lawsuits.<eos> What have I gotten up to now?<eos> Not you, your clients.
Oh, sweet. It's not even my birthday.<eos> It's not to you. It's from you.<eos> This is to Harvard.<eos> I'm going over Sheila Sazs' head and telling them everything that happened.<eos> Well, you are.<eos> - Rachel, you can't--<eos> - No, come on. You said it yourself.<eos> It is not right that I'm being denied admission because someone's punishing Louis.<eos> It's not, but I can't sign this.<eos> - Why not?
Lex...<eos> I never told anybody this.<eos> I think I hit somebody.<eos> But I just kept driving.<eos> So what can I do for you, Henry?<eos> I'll get right to it.<eos> Frank Sullivan approached me on the street And accused me of being behind the leak.<eos> Was it you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Gavin.
Brian, you have a visitor.<eos> Um, you know, why don't we just break for lunch?<eos> That's 30, everybody. 30.<eos> Hello?<eos> I asked the stage manager to change the lights.<eos> Something about being here makes me want to dance.<eos> Why'd you ever quit?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is, I'm gonna start dancing again.<eos> Thanks to you.
- Eddie Santos-- he's been following us ever since we landed-- outside the hotel, outside the restaurant where we eat, outside this club.<eos> Why didn't you report him?<eos> I did-- to your State Department.<eos> Obviously, your government is deaf to the concerns of the loyal Cuban citizens.<eos> Some more loyal than others.<eos> Couldn't help but notice on your passport there's an entry-- "Gobierno Cubano""<eos> My Spanish is a little rusty, but I'm pretty sure that means "Cuban government""<eos> You're not just Silvana's manager, are you?<eos> I was assigned to accompany Silvana on her tour--<eos> Marta, too.
Let go! Please, let go! It's not like that!<eos> Well, you're very lucky.<eos> The wound's healing nicely.<eos> 17 stitches but... with any luck the scar won't be too visible.<eos> Baby?<eos> You're, uh...<eos> You're about six weeks pregnant.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Olivia.<eos> Oh, my God.
Also, respond to my e-mail about the dinner tonight and let everyone know you're very excited about it.<eos> What if I'm not?<eos> Come on, Derek.<eos> If you go, everyone will.<eos> Play is continuous.<eos> What dinner?<eos> They won the crash case. $15 mil each.<eos> Hey, Dr. Yang, congratulations on winning the case.<eos> Are you gonna spend some of that money on furniture for the house?<eos> Why?
- Have a think, then, dickhead.<eos> - I don't want to think.<eos> Right now, I want to fucking hurt you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good.<eos> Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Morning, guv.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Good.
Don't shoot!<eos> They put a bomb on me!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> Am I making myself clear now, John Wayne with the crippled hand?<eos> Okay, I want a sniper on that balcony.<eos> I want one on that balcony, I want one on that roof.<eos> Why did they kill Mr. Stoop?<eos> He gave them the vault key.<eos> They seem to want a show.<eos> Why?
I would like to learn.<eos> Okay, so I'm gonna position it so you can check his cornea.<eos> - I'll be able to see okay?<eos> - You should be fine. Your cornea looks good.<eos> You should be fine. Your cornea looks good.<eos> Now you're gonna feel like something's in your eye for about two weeks.<eos> What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> We're gonna give you some drops and an eye patch.<eos> - No. No way. No eye patch.<eos> - Why not?
Hey.<eos> I thought you'd still be looking at that secret camera video.<eos> I finished an hour ago.<eos> But it turns out, the photographs hidden in Mrs. Purcell's computer are far more interesting.<eos> So, Teri had dirty pictures, too?<eos> Wait.<eos> It gets better.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Innocuous.<eos> Mundane.
Yuck!<eos> Take this.<eos> Listen.<eos> You see Bittoo.<eos> Shoot him here.<eos> Where will you shoot him?<eos> Here.<eos> - Good.<eos> Go on, son.<eos> Okay, uncle.
I don't know.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just gave her a soda.<eos> How did his parents die?<eos> Car wreck, 15 years ago.<eos> You didn't think I'd talk to Natasha and track you down?<eos> What'd you think, I'd just be farting around the office looking in trash cans, wondering where the hell you were?<eos> I couldn't risk it getting back to Arroyo, all right?<eos> I'm trying to save Natasha another fist to the face and get this case back to where it belongs, with us.<eos> Us?

Say they don't hire you.<eos> It's not like you're out on the street.<eos> You have a great job with people who love you.<eos> And I'd only get to see Jada on the weekends.<eos> You know, I'm... I'm not so sure I'd like living in Philadelphia.<eos> Right?<eos> Thank you! It's just Philly.<eos> Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London.<eos> - Who needs it?<eos> - Not us.
- No, no, please.<eos> You know, actually none of you could even really make the cut for this thing.<eos> Which I am so sad about.<eos> Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that Robert invited me too.<eos> - What?<eos> - He said he wanted me there for support.<eos> I'm... his wife.<eos> Angela's husband and I are in love, but as a politician in this town you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs.<eos> He is risking everything to have me there today.<eos> Me.
Good. Wow.<eos> This is suddenly so easy.<eos> Guess what?<eos> You're fired.<eos> - What? - Yeah.<eos> You are fired.<eos> One of the perks of being boss.<eos> I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend.<eos> And, wow, that turns out to be you.<eos> Yup, sorry.
How are we supposed to get her to do it Without understanding her?<eos> We'll make adjustments as we go.<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> Zhukov said things would change.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Elizabeth, this is crazy.<eos> We have no choice.<eos> Ow! Sorry!<eos> That's all right, miss.<eos> So sorry.
Are you okay?<eos> I haven't been sleeping very well.<eos> Grayson.<eos> I'm worried about grayson, and...<eos> Is he doing all right?<eos> Yes. Likes biology.<eos> [ laughs ] never would have guessed that.<eos> And to think we almost lost him.<eos> Well, it all worked out.<eos> Thanks to you and mr.
You?<eos> (Groans) My shoulder's a little...<eos> Oh, the phone's broken.<eos> (Exhales) Wait a second.<eos> We almost hit somebody.<eos> (Tommy) She's alive.<eos> Hi. Wh... what's your name?<eos> (Strained voice) Pam.<eos> Please... you have to help us.<eos> Us?
Just 'cause you're asking for help does not make you weak.<eos> You raised Riley.<eos> You pretty much raised me.<eos> You're one of the strongest women I know.<eos> I just don't want to be a burden.<eos> You're family.<eos> You'll always be a burden.<eos> But at least with family, you'll never be alone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Class!
Has she responded at all?<eos> Some incomprehensible sounds, initially.<eos> Glasgow score of four, but then nothing.<eos> So we downgraded her to a three.<eos> Get a stat C.T. page Dr. Park.<eos> Doctor!<eos> I've really been here a long time.<eos> Whose patient are you?<eos> That's just the thing...<eos> nobody's.
The pain's still pretty bad.<eos> On a scale of 1 to 10?<eos> I'd say an 81/2?<eos> I mean, it comes and goes, but it's mostly continuous.<eos> Is there anything in particular that brings on the pain?<eos> Everything in particular... the bending, the lifting, the turning.<eos> You guys prescribed something to me once before.<eos> Um, what was it?<eos> Uh, lor...<eos> lor-something?
Bheem Singh Chandel!<eos> Why did you stop my car? - I received a tip from control room..<eos> That this is a stolen car?<eos> The tip was right.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Let me go.<eos> You didn't let me go.<eos> Sir, what do you want me to do with it?<eos> Incinerate it!<eos> - Why?
So, will you?<eos> Keep your eyes on the road.<eos> Shameless.<eos> "When I saw you, I realized sweetheart."<eos> "That love's crazy."<eos> Tara.<eos> What the"<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Staring at you.<eos> Why?
Cold?<eos> No.<eos> Can we walk like this?<eos> You're afraid of people seeing us.<eos> There's no one here.<eos> Come on. You're scared.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You should think of your baby, sir. I know.<eos> - So warm.<eos> - Me, too.
Hold me tighter!<eos> I don't wanna go!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> A dream?<eos> It wasn't real?<eos> Da-dada!<eos> Da-dada! Hi...
I don't wanna go!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> Little Bamboo!<eos> A dream?<eos> It wasn't real?<eos> Da-dada!<eos> Da-dada! Hi...<eos> Da-dada!
I need to thoroughly search your cubicle for contraband.<eos> All clear.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> My sweatshirt was outside.<eos> I don't remember putting it in my pocket.<eos> Maybe I am losing my memory. Jesus.<eos> No, I'll just tell them the truth.<eos> I'll just give it back.<eos> You can't do that!<eos> Why?
Now just show me this blank dude's stuff, And let's kick art's sorry ass. Ha ha!<eos> J.D. Salinger's famous book on teen angst Is called "catcher in the..."<eos> "rye."<eos> The character Atticus Finch is from the book...<eos> "to kill a mockingbird."<eos> F. Scott fitzgerald's most famous novel<eos> Is entitled "The Great..."<eos> "Escape." no.<eos> Ugh. "Train Robbery."<eos> Sorry. Uh...
Okay, sure, yeah. Believe whatever you want.<eos> No, no, no, no. Don't pass out on me just yet.<eos> I'm only just getting started.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> This wasn't the first time he escaped that mountain, and that you let him go free as long as you could hide your little tryst from the old man.<eos> The hell he said.<eos> His brain is mush. Oh, yeah?<eos> Then how did I know?<eos> What, have you spilled it to anyone?<eos> Homer? Hesiod?
No, no, no, no. Don't pass out on me just yet.<eos> I'm only just getting started.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> This wasn't the first time he escaped that mountain, and that you let him go free as long as you could hide your little tryst from the old man.<eos> The hell he said.<eos> His brain is mush. Oh, yeah?<eos> Then how did I know?<eos> What, have you spilled it to anyone?<eos> Homer? Hesiod?<eos> Herodotus?
You've got my soulful yet haunting eyes.<eos> Night, Marty. See you tomorrow.<eos> We do have filing cabinets, you know.<eos> This is kind of my process.<eos> What are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you were taking time off.<eos> Turns out, time off isn't all it's cracked up to be.<eos> I just wanted to get a head start on some of the cases that you left for me.<eos> Well, we're gonna need food. - "We"?<eos> - Yeah, we.
Vogel said it was best I stay away.<eos> What the fuck does she know?<eos> If it's any comfort, we're not on the best of terms anymore.<eos> She doesn't understand us, Dexter.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She said I might lose you... but we'll always be together, right?<eos> Vogel had these DVDs of her and dad.<eos> Did she ever show them to you?<eos> A couple.<eos> You?
- I'm not sure that's--<eos> - You're lieutenant now.<eos> It's time to grow a set of balls.<eos> I want to hear something by the end of the day.<eos> Just like old times, huh?<eos> You, me, steak, beer.<eos> Yeah, it's been a while.<eos> So how are things?<eos> Good, great.<eos> You?
We wish you and Harrison luck in whatever comes next.<eos> - To Dexter. - To Dexter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll miss you guys too.<eos> Dexter.<eos> This is Oliver Saxon.<eos> Again.<eos> He responded to the listing and was hoping to take a look at the place.<eos> - Pleasure.
It was confession, a sacrament.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> He told me the diamonds were here.<eos> I didn't believe it.<eos> But then I found them...<eos> And him.<eos> It was the greater good.<eos> 20 years I've kept St. Roch open.<eos> Those diamonds helped so many people, Felix.<eos> Even you.
Obviously wasn't a game of strength.<eos> Or wits.<eos> That's very clever.<eos> Moving on.<eos> I didn't even want the goldfish, but my date insisted I give it a proper home, which meant something nicer than the plastic bag that it came in.<eos> So, went to the pet store, bought this aquarium, but then we started looking at it, realized how lonely it looked, which meant, of course...<eos> More fish.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But there's so many fish to choose from, I didn't know where to start, which is where I had my epiphany.<eos> You ready for this?
Rates are soaring.<eos> And it's not just because of increased diagnoses.<eos> In fact, one article I read claims it's environmentally based.<eos> I just had to come over and thank you again.<eos> - Frank. - This man saved my life.<eos> I'll take that we're eating in the same restaurant as either a fortuitous opportunity or a divine hint to thank you again, though, while I have you, I'm still feeling fatigued.<eos> - You say this is normal? - Mm-hmm.<eos> He saved my life.<eos> Frank Valente, please, meet Dr. Sydney Napur.<eos> - Pleasure. - Oh. [ Chuckles ]
I've decided to move here.<eos> To Los Angeles?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I only moved to Savannah because of Sheila.<eos> Now that we're divorced...<eos> I'm absolutely thrilled.<eos> Think of all the decadent dinners we'll have.<eos> In fact, what are you doing tonight?<eos> Adrian's introducing me to someone.<eos> A woman?
What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What do you mean, you're gonna drop me?<eos> What?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> No, it matters to me.<eos> Of course I wasn't trying to pull a fast one.<eos> I just didn't think it was a big deal.<eos> So that's... that's it?<eos> Me, too.
There was nothing I could do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you tried, Mike.<eos> If it'll make you feel better, you're not the only person being let go this week.<eos> Well, Clark and Owens are only getting let go because someone found out that they're moving to Bratton Gould with McKinney and Kline.<eos> - They are?<eos> - Yeah, I overheard it.<eos> I guess some people will choose any port in a storm.<eos> Harold, good luck.<eos> You too.
I got to get more Pall Malls, too.<eos> Damn, girl, I'll jack you cigs.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> - Besides--<eos> - Don't look.<eos> It's just Joe and his rank-ass cab.<eos> What of it?<eos> I don't want Joe stopping.<eos> God!<eos> Why?
Your wife.<eos> Her finger was broken postmortem.<eos> You took her ring.<eos> What did you do with it?<eos> I pawned it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - At a pawn shop.<eos> Which one?<eos> Your son, Adrian, just kept drawing this over and over.<eos> Why?
I can go out.<eos> Oh, Lyric, girl.<eos> You're the best.<eos> Now you want to help me do the other side?<eos> Yo, Lyric!<eos> You seen Kallie up in here?<eos> Ever heard of knocking, Bullet?<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> No, didn't see her.<eos> Why?
And I am willing to forget that this ever happened if you assure me that you can tame your childish nonsense and accord me some respect.<eos> I-I will.<eos> I can. I will.<eos> And now I will go home to my husband, because... I'm his Valentine.<eos> But she already hated you, Castle.<eos> So it doesn't sound like you're any worse off.<eos> I do respect the way she handled it, though-- strong, decisive.<eos> I feel like somehow, it brought us closer.<eos> I am sorry about the earrings, though.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
I think Brendan is worried that he's older and he's fatter and he can't get it up as much as he'd like.<eos> You were in a Jesuit seminary when you were younger?<eos> Is that correct?<eos> That question have a point?<eos> There just seem to be a lot of vows you consider gray areas.<eos> - But then you are a cop... not a priest.<eos> - Last I checked.<eos> - Again... Do you think detective McCann is concerned with Internal Affairs?<eos> I don't think he would tell me even if he was.<eos> Why not?
(Sighs they made me think Schiller did it.<eos> If I don't kill him, Alexandra's gonna come after me.<eos> Schiller's still a bad guy.<eos> He's got you under his thumb.<eos> You've got good reason to kill him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But if I do it, dad gets what he always wanted.<eos> He gets rewarded for killing my husband.<eos> That's why we have to make him pay.<eos> Not "we."
You won't do anything about it because you can't win a war against us Duchenkos, and Nicholae Schiller won't start anything he can't win.<eos> Well, it's already started.<eos> No, Schiller backed out.<eos> This was Alexandra Duchenko's deal. But she jumped on a plane to Russia, so who knows where she is now?<eos> So where's the money?<eos> J.J. never told me where it was.<eos> You're not worried about how good you're getting at this?<eos> What have you done?<eos> How do you look them in the eye?<eos> Who?
Can you babysit?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Just give me 24 hours' notice.<eos> You know what the best part about living across the street from you guys is?<eos> I can see that I have a life and you don't.<eos> I'm having people over tonight, and I just need to borrow some ice, some beer, some cold cuts, and...<eos> Whatever this is.<eos> I got to be honest.<eos> Kinda surprised you're having lunch here today.<eos> - Why?
I did it for Jules.<eos> Love it.<eos> You know the drill.<eos> Family prayer before family food.<eos> Hands. Okay, dear Lord, thank you so much for our friends and our family.<eos> Thank you for this wonderful food and...<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Hmm? Nothing.<eos> He was all like...<eos> Why?
Too late, because I am fierce.<eos> I love you, Sam.<eos> Uh, you have to say that; I have sex with you.<eos> Okay, the real test is, will you have sex with me wearing that dress?<eos> You get the tequila, I'll go put on some heels.<eos> Lightly salted, just the way you like.<eos> Mm, thanks.<eos> Who could've seen this coming? Right.<eos> We end up with the house.<eos> Unbelievable.
He's banging scared.<eos> If that's true, I'd be the best lay on the planet.<eos> I just don't want to lose her.<eos> Oh, you won't.<eos> But it's fun to lose yourself in the magic of Broadway.<eos> Alan.<eos> Fine.<eos> Well, it's too bad you're in a relationship.<eos> Kate's show will be packed with half-naked supermodels.<eos> S-Supermodels?
I-I got caught up in it, and then I-I couldn't figure out how to get out, and it...<eos> Trust me, you are the most amazing person I've ever met.<eos> I love you whether I'm Sam Wilson or Walden Schmidt.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> Unfortunately, I have no idea who Walden Schmidt is.<eos> Kate, wait.<eos> You know what?<eos> This whole time, I thought he was the douche.<eos> Turns out you're the douche.<eos> Unbelievable.
You know, sometimes I wonder how things would've turned out if I had been the one raised by King George instead of my brother, you know, would I have been corrupt like him?<eos> Never.<eos> - Same blood ran through our veins.<eos> - But your hearts are different.<eos> You may not believe it, but trust me, I know you're Charming. I had a lot of fun today.<eos> Fun?<eos> Almost getting killed is fun?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I missed our adventures.<eos> Me, too.
- Can I just-- for the record, can I just point out that I have never seen Jessa take heroin in the whole time that we've known each other. Fabulous.<eos> You certainly have lived a lot.<eos> I guess so.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Oh, but it's very impressive, especially since I haven't heard a word about work.<eos> Um, yeah, well, I'll figure it out.<eos> - She's resourceful.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Must be very nice to find yourself in such a... successful situation.<eos> Situation?
No record of him after 1987.<eos> Family?<eos> A brother in town, but here's the weird thing-- nobody ever filed a missing persons report on him.<eos> That's odd.<eos> You and Rigsby go and see what the brother has to say. All right.<eos> So what did I do last night? Come on.<eos> I'm dying here.<eos> You got up on the table and sang "Bohemian Rhapsody." Oh.<eos> I do a pretty good Freddie Mercury. That's not so embarrassing.<eos> Maybe not for you.
I mean, at my grandma's funeral, they kept the casket in a private room until the service started.<eos> Let's just go find it.<eos> Aria was right.<eos> The casket isn't here yet.<eos> Okay, so let's split up.<eos> And if you find it, send out an S.O.S.<eos> Looks like we got the same "A" message.<eos> Blocked.<eos> Kisses?<eos> Redial?
Saving someone's life is still important to me.<eos> You know what?<eos> That's pretty impressive, too.<eos> Hey, here's an idea.<eos> Why don't you look me up when you get back to Argon?<eos> Maybe we can hang out.<eos> Really?<eos> I-I mean, sure.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Me, too.
He aiming to.<eos> You know how he is he put his mind to it.<eos> We should talk about what if he can't.<eos> If he ain't up to it.<eos> He'll be up to it.<eos> And if he ain't?<eos> Who'll take us out?<eos> You, of course.<eos> - Unless he wants you to. - Me?<eos> You the wild man.
Oh, snap.<eos> Give 'em the front room.<eos> We'll move our bed into Honorée's room.<eos> What, they gonna sleep on the floor?<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> ( music playing ) ♪ They fly away<eos> - ♪ Oh, birds... - Hey!<eos> - ♪ They fly away... - Hey.<eos> Told you I'd make it.<eos> ♪ You ready?
They'll know.<eos> As soon as he doesn't report back from leave.<eos> So...<eos> They'll come for him.<eos> But we've, er, we've got time until then...<eos> I mean, you, you, you won't tell anyone until we've...<eos> Thank you.<eos> They shouldn't be disturbed.<eos> What?<eos> The Middletons.
It's a simple question.<eos> You know, we met at the SCLC meeting.<eos> We was putting together a group to March with Dr. King in Chicago.<eos> We just clicked.<eos> It wasn't about race or Vietnam.<eos> It was about equality.<eos> When she told me who she really was, it was like I already knew.<eos> She was recruiting me for the KGB, America's number-one enemy.<eos> And I was right there with her.<eos> Me and her against the world.
No problem, baby.<eos> How long has this been going on?<eos> I walked in on Mrs. Peri and her co-star over a month ago.<eos> Why did you finally decide to tell me?<eos> At first I didn't think it was my place.<eos> But you and I are becoming so close.<eos> I couldn't protect her anymore.<eos> So... you know the name of a good divorce lawyer?<eos> - You can't leave her.<eos> - Why not?
It's not true!<eos> - I'm innocent!<eos> - Get her out of my sight.<eos> We'rerunningout of gladiators to fight her!<eos> Is there not one program in Argon worthy of Paige?<eos> Mmm. There is one, sir.<eos> Citizens of Argon!<eos> Distinguished guests from around the Grid!<eos> We now present the one and only warrior worthy of locking discs with the traitorous Ex-commander Paige.<eos> Me!
- Mm-hmm. Dip it again, slower this time.<eos> Oh, I do love my glass of wine at the end of the day.<eos> It's almost as good as the one at the beginning of the day.<eos> Yeah, you know, I don't miss it.<eos> This herbal tea suits me just fine.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Oh, more power to you.<eos> But if I didn't have my "Goofy Grape" to sand the edges off, I'd nail the door shut, turn the oven on and... (clicks) light a match.<eos> Let me just top that off for you.<eos> Hey, ladies.
- Do they deliver?<eos> - No. But I pot every other day, so I'm in the neighborhood.<eos> Oh, Victoria, do you have any hot mustard sauce?<eos> - They got plum sauce? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I love the plum sauce.<eos> I have to say... I feel completely satiated from our healthy, baby-smart dinner.<eos> You know, once you start eating right, your body actually craves that kind of food.<eos> I mean, who needs those heavy sauces, or French fries or... thick buttery rolls that melt in your mouth.<eos> Not me.<eos> Me neither.
Here's a good one:<eos> studio apartment, utilities included, small pet allowed.<eos> You could get that ferret you always wanted.<eos> No, man, I need at least a two-bedroom.<eos> I've got to have a home office.<eos> Why do you need an office?<eos> I might write a book someday.<eos> And I need someplace to put my globe.<eos> God, it's starting to get cold in here.<eos> You guys cold?
Okay.<eos> I can't imagine how scared she must be.<eos> Okay, I need you to prep the parents for what they're about to see.<eos> They cannot panic when they come into this room.<eos> Police asked for blood and urine on the driver.<eos> Get that and then meet me back down here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen, do you mind talking to the parents?<eos> I'll get blood on the kid.<eos> Why?
Those cards are really... colorful.<eos> How's my biopsy coming along, Molly?<eos> Coming, coming...<eos> we're slammed.<eos> No worries.<eos> Correct.<eos> Yes!<eos> How's the studying going?<eos> No complaints.<eos> You?
Am I okay?<eos> We're still waiting on official results, but yeah.<eos> You look good.<eos> Tyra...<eos> What's happening?<eos> Why are my legs like that?<eos> Aortic dissection from the impact of the trauma?<eos> Could be.<eos> He needs an angio.<eos> Why?
How are your mama and grandma?<eos> They're good.<eos> I'll have to tell them<eos> Felicia's place closed down.<eos> They won't believe it.<eos> Just last month.<eos> So many places going under.<eos> But not you.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Gracias a dios.
- Cool.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> _<eos> Yeah, what's up?<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> Uh, slow down just a little bit.<eos> _ _<eos> Website.
My next trick is quickly becoming the envy of every magician in Las Vegas, I daresay, the world.<eos> I have been performing this amazing feat on volunteers.<eos> However, questions have arisen as to its very safety.<eos> And so, tonight in order to prove that it is in no way harmful, I shall endeavor to levitate myself.<eos> No!<eos> Monty, I don't think that's a very--<eos> Rose, my lovely Rose.<eos> The government has sent us two of its finest agents to investigate my magic, and I must prove to them that it is safe.<eos> I would ask you now to please put your hands over your heats, and when I say, "Rise up," you will lift me off the stage with the combined power of your minds and my magic.<eos> Uh....
We can push back, Deena, or you can just sign this prenup and hope for the best, but I would push back if I were you.<eos> Push back.<eos> Push back hard.<eos> Nicely played, Cary.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You're gonna make a hell of an equity partner.<eos> Now, you two get moving on Gross's asset assessment.<eos> They offered you partnership?<eos> Uh, I know, it's funny, right?<eos> Me, too.
I think they realized "unclean hands."<eos> Okay, they're in here.<eos> Okay, let's see.<eos> Could you try the ones on that side?<eos> Ah, we thought we'd lost you.<eos> It's a jungle out here.<eos> This is my client, Eli Gold, and this is Josh Perrotti.<eos> Hello.<eos> And you remember Agent LaGuardia?<eos> Of course.
This is our second delay. - Hello.<eos> Delay them an hour.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> And you.<eos> An exciting office.<eos> So, they sent over the wiretap complaint application, but it checked out.<eos> So I asked them to send over the underlying notes used to prep the judge, but that checked out also. So I...<eos> Can I set this here?<eos> Yes, please. - So?
Meet. Don't talk about forming a new firm, don't talk about jumping ship, just ask them if they're happy.<eos> - We can't be accused of doing anything wrong.<eos> - We're just seeing if our clients are happy.<eos> - Right. But it will scare the hell out of the partners.<eos> It'll make them think we're jumping ship and taking all our top clients with us.<eos> So what was that about?<eos> You guys are quitting? No.<eos> Plotting.<eos> Why? Because we want attention from our bosses.<eos> Why?
It coordinates 50% of the world's BitTorrent traffic.<eos> Not so many computers, but powerful and well-configured.<eos> Half the day has gone.<eos> How did it feel in court?<eos> So far it's been boring.<eos> The prosecutors' strategy is to lie as much as possible in the most boring possible way so you fall asleep in court and become physically undable to defend yourself.<eos> Some say that you've made a lot of money by spreading illegal material.<eos> We've probably made a lot of money, but the site costs a lot, too.<eos> Hi. Okay, we're coming down.<eos> Bye.
How am I qualified to help other people?<eos> It's like I suddenly feel incapable of doing my job, like I have hit a wall.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm done with being a therapist.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Bullshit.<eos> We both know you are not going to quit your job, so let's not follow Alice in Pityland down the rabbit hole.<eos> Let's get back to the dalliance with the co-worker.<eos> Why?
Yeah, I was depressed in college a lot. I just watched a lot of movies.<eos> Oh, you should have joined a sorority.<eos> I was in one. It's a cultural tease.<eos> Yeah, like, if you go in to get a haircut and you want some asymmetrical haircut, you should be like, "yeah, I know Oingo Boingo, or I at least know what New Wave was."<eos> I was explaining Prince to her.<eos> What do you mean explaining Prince?<eos> I was explaining who he was.<eos> Remember her music.<eos> Okay, well, this is just rough, but...<eos> - Okay. - Ready?
Yeah. What'd you say?<eos> That I'm seeing someone.<eos> It could be serious.<eos> That right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Have you told your son anything?<eos> Mm, I may have mentioned a thing or two, that I met a man who's nice and funny, easy on the eyes.<eos> Taylor's happy for me, so what do you think about meeting him?<eos> I'm cool with it.<eos> You?
yöur decision isn't right. Once yöu join the gang, yöu won't have a way out.<eos> Let's go and tell the police - No, Kajal. Mom's in their captivity.<eos> yöu won't tell the police anything, Kajal. For my sake.<eos> But, Vishwas, how is this<eos> - Just forget me, Kajal. yöur world's full of bright life, hopes. My world's filled with darkness and nothing else.<eos> We cannot be together, Kajal. And..<eos> And? And what?<eos> Say it.<eos> We won't meet again. I'm sorry.<eos> "Without me.."
That's what we do, right?<eos> - Stop them, not scramble them.<eos> - Don't lecture me, Kal.<eos> I'm still older than you.<eos> No.<eos> You may have left Krypton that way, but you're not anymore.<eos> The wormhole got me here faster.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Tell it to Einstein.<eos> - Who?
- Stop them, not scramble them.<eos> - Don't lecture me, Kal.<eos> I'm still older than you.<eos> No.<eos> You may have left Krypton that way, but you're not anymore.<eos> The wormhole got me here faster.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Tell it to Einstein.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Smart guy.
Tell us. How is Krypton?<eos> We feared it was destroyed.<eos> It was.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Then the arrivals from Argo City were right.<eos> Arrivals from Argo City?<eos> They appeared the same way you did, a short time after Brainiac took Kandor.<eos> Was there a couple with them named Zor-El and Alura?<eos> Great Rao, he looks just like his father.<eos> - Unbelievable.
Jealous?<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks. Look.<eos> So, Marc. Cheers!<eos> - Thanks, guys.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Cheers! To you!<eos> More anyone?
The A22 under the Hailsham Bridge.<eos> He walked out in front of a lorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> Of course I miss him.<eos> Actually, I have something you might be interested in.<eos> Yes, it's a... thing, I can't describe it, papers and drawings.<eos> That sounds like exactly the sort of thing we're looking for.<eos> We have to get out of here, now.<eos> What?
What, no kiss first?<eos> So, you're getting tremors.<eos> It could be psychosomatic. Or the Deel's could be activating.<eos> Thoraxin's an experimental drug, it's hard to gauge its efficacy.<eos> Then why am I taking it?<eos> Because there's every chance it's keeping you alive.<eos> You know, when Jessica handed them the manuscript, she didn't give them it all.<eos> She ripped out a few pages.<eos> She must've given them to someone.<eos> Grant?
Yes, the tarantulas.<eos> I don't see why it is necessary.<eos> - Don't worry, sir. Official police business. PAPADAKIS:<eos> Detective, please.<eos> RIGSBY: I assure you it won't take too long. PAPADAKIS:<eos> Wait, what are you doing?<eos> RIGSBY:<eos> I'm gonna need to take a close look at this spider here.<eos> PAPADAKIS: No.<eos> This one specifically here. - This spider.
Ah, trust me, you'll have fun.<eos> "Trust me, you'll have fun."<eos> Was there ever a more suspicious phrase?<eos> J.J., you have to live a little.<eos> You spend your days chasing paperclip thieves.<eos> When do you ever get the chance to nail a killer?<eos> No, it's true.<eos> I'm happy to help.<eos> Ahem. It's the performance aspect that concerns me.<eos> What performance aspect?
You tortured them.<eos> I knew you'd be upset.<eos> You're not as tough-minded as you'd like to think you are.<eos> So I wanted to see you.<eos> I haven't gone off the rails, I promise.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Julia Howard got exactly what she deserved.<eos> She helped kill my sister.<eos> Helped who?<eos> Not Red John.
It's Tron they're after. I'll lead them away while you get free.<eos> Hold it right there!<eos> Hey, everyone! Check it out!<eos> You idiots, why aren't you derezzing him?<eos> Clear the way! Move it.<eos> Move program.<eos> If you want Tron... you'll have to go through me.<eos> Will someone kill her already?<eos> And me.<eos> - Me too.
I could put his brother, George, upon the throne in his place.<eos> The King has done what he should not.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> There are many who will be cursing our luck and wishing us to fall.<eos> So, our new queen is not only Lancastrian but now we have half of Burgundy out in force.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she is related to them!<eos> But, Issy, we like her better than the old bad queen, don't we?<eos> And now we must crown her before her belly grows too fat.<eos> Elizabeth.
In body perhaps, but not in spirit.<eos> They have promised me their loyalty, Elizabeth.<eos> Truly you must trust me.<eos> I will be home with you by May Day morning with peaches and salt cod, for you and my prince, Edward.<eos> Annie, feel! He's excited.<eos> He is strong!<eos> Or she is.<eos> Father, what is it?<eos> A rebellion.<eos> Against the King.
- David.<eos> She needs to be stopped.<eos> She needs to be killed.<eos> This is our family.<eos> We are going to protect it.<eos> Of course we will, but what you're talking about goes beyond that.<eos> Does it?<eos> - Because she is the reason you've never met my mother. - I know.<eos> I know what happened to Queen Eva, and I have zero problem with Cora dying for it, but not by your hand and not out of vengeance.<eos> - Why?
All right. So, you're gonna have to catch me up.<eos> What -- did your dad, uh -- he couldn't quit the life, could he?<eos> No, he did. For a while, it was amazing.<eos> We had dinner every night at a table. We watched TV, went on walks.<eos> Even went to the mall.<eos> And then?<eos> And then... The past came a-knockin'.<eos> I woke up one morning and found him dead.... ...his throat ripped out.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
Huh.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's just not what I expected. And what was that?<eos> A little more "Lord of the Flies", less Huxtables.<eos> Sorry to disappoint.<eos> Victor Rogers.<eos> We met -- a Rugaru hunt in Washington.<eos> This is Dean.<eos> Oh, yes. The Winchesters.<eos> Ohh. Better now?
So wait... a little while, let him get to know you better.<eos> Once he does, he's gonna want to follow you anywhere.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I could marry you again right now.<eos> You're so hot when you're nefarious.<eos> Arizona wants to meet with all of us.<eos> Where is our van?<eos> - Someone moved it.<eos> - Why?
And it was a very big commitment.<eos> I wasn't even sure I liked him.<eos> So, thanks.<eos> No, I didn't know if I liked you then.<eos> - Of course I know...<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> Nobody wants you to touch them, Peter.<eos> I can't sit through this.<eos> Come on, Judi, we're leaving.<eos> Why?
No, it's your thing.<eos> Come on, let's go in.<eos> Dinner or a movie...<eos> For as long as we both shall live?<eos> I couldn't help but see your fax on the machine, and I couldn't help but notice that that fax is from a donor clinic, so I couldn't help but deduce...<eos> You can help all those things, okay?<eos> Yeah, well, you're gonna be a dad!<eos> Come here!<eos> Okay. Oh, my God, I'm just saying, the name Morgan works for boys or girls.<eos> Better for girls.
I don't think we... should continue this.<eos> Us.<eos> Wow.<eos> I'm just, I'm not... where I think I should be.<eos> Look, I know there's a lot going on with your mom...<eos> It's not just my mom.<eos> I'm just not there... with you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
I'm just gonna give you a quick listen, and then I'll... I'll leave you guys alone.<eos> Dad... you're right.<eos> It's a mess. And I just feel like I need to help.<eos> And I know it's dangerous, but... you can get blindsided here, too, right?<eos> JOE: Just, uh...<eos> Just come back in one piece, okay?<eos> (conversing quietly) Hey. Hey. Are you guys, uh, gonna go to the bar later?<eos> 'cause we're gonna go to the bar.<eos> Uh, yeah, oh, yeah.<eos> Why? Why?
Sorry.<eos> Yeah... Listen, um...<eos> WILL: No, it's-it's...<eos> I mean, it's not your fault. Right.<eos> No. Um...<eos> Hey, come on, roomie!<eos> We gotta get up early.<eos> Oh, it's starting... now?<eos> Tonight?<eos> Why...?
She prides herself on the... accuracy of her profiles. But to think she would've gone so far as to destroy a family to lend credence to one of her claims.<eos> Did you ever consider the possibility that she lied about you in the article?<eos> What would she have to gain?<eos> I was never revealed as the subject in the article.<eos> No one ever compared me to it.<eos> Anyway, she got a good deal right.<eos> She predicted your drug problem.<eos> You got clean. You picked up your career right where you left off.<eos> And you even made a friend, something that Kathryn claimed in her article was virtually impossible.<eos> Me.
I'm gonna need you tonight, Colt.<eos> I need you to be that M.P. I knew back in Kuwait.<eos> Do you still think you can be that man?<eos> Boyd, I'm gonna make this right.<eos> Jimmy'll be up front in five.<eos> Come on.<eos> Stay here and wait for my call.<eos> What's the name of the place where we're going?<eos> It's called Huatulco.<eos> Huatulco.
I think he might be!<eos> I'm all ears, Mr Cush!<eos> Limehouse! Limehouse!<eos> Whenever she'd get in trouble, she'd threaten to go to Limehouse!<eos> I know they're here.<eos> Were you even gonna tell me?<eos> Well, I didn't know I was obliged to keep you apprised of comings and goings in my holler.<eos> I told you this woman means me harm.<eos> You or Boyd?<eos> Me.
I have never betrayed your confidence.<eos> You helped me remember why I don't trust people.<eos> Because people disappoint.<eos> They fail you.<eos> That's your past talking, Megan.<eos> Because you felt abandoned by your father, it's colored your every move.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But it also taught me to rely on myself.<eos> And as far as my daddy issues go, I am taking care of those the best way I know how.<eos> My way.
Oh, my God.<eos> Great, I'll text you the deets.<eos> I'm going to J.Crew. I'm going shopping, and I'm gonna be so late.<eos> - Oh, love you.<eos> - Bye, lovie.<eos> - Kisses. Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> She's the richest Hindi I know.<eos> We are not going to that party tonight.<eos> Why?
Like, sexual things, murder things.<eos> So, it was really a classical presentation.<eos> Well,okay.<eos> Then I guess it's classic to have to masturbate eight or 16 times a night until your legs shake and you're crying, and you're trying to make sure that your parents didn't hear you, so you check their door eight times, then you move your toothbrush 64 times,<eos> then you move your dad's toothbrush 64 times, then you go back and forth between the two, moving each one eight times until you've reached 64 times, but then you realize that that doesn't feel quite right either,<eos> and suddenly it's 3:00 in the morning, and you're fucking exhausted, and you go to school the next day looking like a zombie.<eos> It's classical.<eos> Anyway, I took medicine, so...<eos> Are you taking medicine now?<eos> - Mmm-mmm. - Why?
I'm gonna go talk to the dean right now.<eos> I'm gonna tell him exactly who's orchestrating the cheating.<eos> What do you think he's gonna say?<eos> I... I think he'll appreciate the honesty.<eos> Hey, believe me... everything's gonna be fine, okay?<eos> I'm gonna beat Campbell to the punch.<eos> Yo, Annie, there's something wrong with the doorknob in your bathroom.<eos> Shh, I know.<eos> I... I don't want Mark or Liam trying to fix it.<eos> Uh, why not?
I basically bought the store out of saltines.<eos> So I hope they do the trick.<eos> Where's Helen?<eos> Oh, I sent her out to get me some soup I was craving.<eos> Why didn't you text me?<eos> I could've got it.<eos> No, you couldn't have.<eos> It's this special soup, Peruvian soup, made from llama's milk.<eos> You can only get it at this one place in Simi Valley that I completely made up.<eos> - Oh, okay, why?
These smoothies will just blend themselves!<eos> Okay.<eos> Think I have our winner.<eos> It's called Rural Ambu-care.<eos> They want to buy an ambulance for people who live far away from the hospital.<eos> Ambulances are dumb.<eos> When has an ambulance ever helped anyone?<eos> What about Andy's music thing?<eos> Well, this is a great service that will help a lot of needy people.<eos> Sorry, Andy.
If we get stopped, stay quiet and let us do the talking.<eos> Mm-hm. You try anything, Amanda won't get a chance to rip you apart. I'll do it first.<eos> You know, it's no wonder you lost your memories.<eos> Your brain had insufficient power to hold on to them.<eos> If we get stopped, my silence might not be enough.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Zetrov's defense contractors played a major role in the South Ossetian war.<eos> They had me accompany some weapon systems here as a consultant.<eos> I won't go into the details. Suffice it to say I'm not a well-liked man around these parts.<eos> Why?
God save the King.<eos> God save the King.<eos> God save the King!<eos> God save the King!<eos> God save the King!<eos> I promised you this day would come.<eos> You may stay down on your knees.<eos> I am the King's mother and you shall kneel to me as to a queen.<eos> I am Margaret Regina.<eos> Elizabeth?
- Sounds great.<eos> - What?<eos> Prom is awful.<eos> We won't have to buy a dress, or pay to have our hair done or rent a limo.<eos> We can go in jeans, and we can eat 'cause we won't care if we look like pigs or if anyone's gonna try to touch our bloated stomachs.<eos> Or worry if we're gonna have to give it up for a lobster dinner.<eos> We can just chill or not even go.<eos> That's even better.<eos> - That sounds awful.<eos> - Why?
- Playing a little poker?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Strip poker?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Hey, idea.<eos> How about you girls help grab some boxes for me out of storage?<eos> - What kind of boxes?<eos> - Just costumes, props.<eos> Whatever stuff from the last say two years?<eos> - Why?
We both know killing her will cost you the thing you want most...<eos> Henry.<eos> Why don't you just give up this obsession with vengeance?<eos> You know it can never make you happy.<eos> Yes, it will. You had a whole curse worth of vengeance, and what did it get you?<eos> A gaping hole in your heart.<eos> That was your curse.<eos> Which you cast.<eos> Still haven't learned your lesson, have you?<eos> What lesson?
I couldn't take the guilt over what I did to Cora.<eos> I could barely breathe. I told her to end it, and she ripped out my heart.<eos> And when she took it out, my heart, David...<eos> It had started to blacken because of what I did.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because telling you makes things real, and I needed to believe it wasn't, that I could find a way to stop it, that redemption was possible.<eos> It is.<eos> Look at August.<eos> But it cost him...<eos> Everything.
Yes.<eos> You really think we'd let you die?<eos> Despite our differences, we're family.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Where are Greg and Tamara?<eos> They got away.<eos> So they still have it.<eos> Still have what?<eos> Sorry about your father.<eos> Me, too.
I won't need magic, as long as I can get close enough to snap her neck with my bare hands.<eos> I can see you're determined.<eos> Once the deed is done, call upon me.<eos> Only I can return you to your regal self.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What's the price?<eos> Mm, boring matter of state.<eos> I need you to cut off all trade with King George's realm.<eos> King George?<eos> Why?
You'll die.<eos> No, I've made my peace with that.<eos> It's just ahead.<eos> You sure whoever's in charge of you guys doesn't want you to die in a mine collapse?<eos> Just keep moving.<eos> Who is telling you what to do?<eos> You know what?<eos> That's not your concern.<eos> It's not ours, either.<eos> Not your concern?
I already lost my dad.<eos> I don't wanna lose anyone else.<eos> We have to work together.<eos> From the mouths of babes.<eos> I'd say the lad has a point.<eos> That's for the last time we met.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> And tell us why you're here before I use something else other than my fist.<eos> I think threatening to kill me is a bit redundant when we're all about to die anyway.<eos> No thanks to you.
You disgust me with your carnal ways.<eos> Okay, help me find wife number four.<eos> - Five. - Whatever.<eos> How about blonde pixie-cut behind me?<eos> - No. - Why?<eos> - She's my manicurist.<eos> - So? So if something goes wrong, I'll have to find another manicurist.<eos> Or a town with more than one manicurist.<eos> Okay, back table, brunette with the bangs.<eos> - Nyet.
You spoke to a D.A.<eos> I was trying to save our lives.<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> You're dead.<eos> Our children are orphaned.<eos> As soon as Rizzo figures it out, we're going to the desert.<eos> And there's not a thing I can say to stop it.<eos> What the hell is this now?<eos> Katherine says she can help us disappear.<eos> Us?
Corpses have their eyes open.<eos> You should shower.<eos> The heat will be good on any of your strained muscles.<eos> Thank you, but I'm just going to stay right here and die of internal bleeding.<eos> You did good out there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You think good enough to be on the team?<eos> It's not just my decision, but, yeah, I'm guessing you're at the top of the list.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, great.
This place is not sinking.<eos> We're having some trouble, but we're gonna fix this.<eos> Cahill's convinced Pegasus to come back to the table. She's having that meeting right now, and she's going to make this sale.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Whatever you say, cap'n.<eos> Bailey, please.<eos> They're reevaluating their offer based on all of these walkouts.<eos> We can't afford to lose another surgeon,<eos> - most of all you.<eos> - Me?
Hold on now.<eos> Where you goin'?<eos> - Just hold up now.<eos> - You stole some of my salt pork.<eos> - I'll make my own way from here on.<eos> - Man, I ain't eat your food.<eos> I knowed you was a thief.<eos> You don't know a goddamn thing.<eos> What, you think I stole that shit?<eos> Why?
Want to go for a ride?<eos> No. Motorcycles are dangerous.<eos> Only if I drop it on my foot.<eos> I can't get it started.<eos> Good.<eos> - Hey, Ma.<eos> Frankie, did you get it? Did you get it?<eos> ! It's not official.<eos> Angela, if you have an issue with my mood...<eos> Your mood?
Is that a fat joke? Because I bought this for everyone.<eos> Look, man, I... I... I feel like I'm doing you a disservice.<eos> Well, I wasn't gonna complain, but I did expect you hours ago with those sheets.<eos> I wanted to give you someplace to crash, but you're crash-and-burning.<eos> You need to get it together. You need to step up and find some place where Opus can sleep where he's not gonna get banana peppers on him.<eos> (Scoffs) I'm not saying it has to have a picket fence and a window box, but something.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying I think you should go. There it is.<eos> Wow. Unbelievable.
Did you see a doctor?<eos> Yeah-- well, a paramedic.<eos> He said I was fine.<eos> Clark, um... I know that we're not supposed to, but maybe they could assign someone different from your office to work with me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I just can't.<eos> And I'm-- I'm sorry, but... there's something I would like you to have so you understand how I feel.<eos> How did it go?<eos> She got over it.<eos> Philip.
I know what it's worth.<eos> There are things that aren't in the paperwork.<eos> Try 30. Things?<eos> You know we do classified work.<eos> They don't let us put everything down.<eos> I have a security clearance, and we already know you have encryption technology.<eos> Why do you think we wanted to buy you?<eos> Look, honey, the technology, I can't talk about.<eos> Anybody can cloak a signal, but I figured out how to make the system portable.<eos> Portable?
You didn't have to pick me up.<eos> I didn't have to bring you coffee, either.<eos> Or a vanilla-cream doughnut.<eos> I'm sorry about before.<eos> You know, we have to do all sorts of things for our work, and it requires being a certain way.<eos> What exactly are you talking about?<eos> You know what I wish as I fall asleep every night?<eos> That I'll wake up and not be worried.<eos> About what?<eos> Everything.
- Oh, he'll take it.<eos> It's the best deal he's gonna get, and he knows it.<eos> - Well, Wesley is gonna have a good man in his life, regardless.<eos> - that's nice of you to say.<eos> All right, well, there you have it.<eos> I can keep it in my room until you're ready to swap it out.<eos> Eric.<eos> - You sure Renee seemed okay when you talked to her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why?
No. No, no, no.<eos> It -- it was still with Nico, but... that's the point.<eos> I...was Mrs. Robinson, and Nico represented what I can't have, or shouldn't have.<eos> And Matt...<eos> Well, I can't have Matt anymore anyway.<eos> Or shouldn't have, right?<eos> It was Matt who told you this was about wanting what you can't have, correct?<eos> Damn it!<eos> And since you are the author of your dreams, who did Matt represent?<eos> Me.
Look.<eos> This is Patrick.<eos> He's 7 years old.<eos> This is Emma.<eos> She just turned 3.<eos> This is my wife Sara.<eos> We're happy. Look at this.<eos> Because when you're standing outside my door with a gun,<eos> I don't care what your reason is, this is who you're hurting.<eos> Not me, this.
They just... They give me an envelope, it has details inside, a-and my pay...<eos> Who gives you an envelope?<eos> I don't know, it's somebody different every single time.<eos> I was gonna get a cigarette.<eos> Look, dude, I swear to you, okay?<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Aw, come on, man!<eos> You think they would tell me anything, huh?<eos> A fuckin' junky?
Cosima...<eos> What'd they do to me?<eos> I think you'd know if they'd done anything really... um, invasive.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm just saying, um,<eos> An EEG is like a neurological test, and that mark on your arm looks like... a blood sample.<eos> - It sounds diagnostic.<eos> - With Paul in on it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Why?
I was her age when I came to live with you<eos> - in London, yeah?<eos> - A little bit older.<eos> Well, you got me this far.<eos> I know that.<eos> I still need your help, though.<eos> Ah.<eos> I need you to tell me, uh... what you really know about me...<eos> Where I came from.<eos> - Why now?
- Am I supposed to intuit what that might be?<eos> - Runaway named Ellen May.<eos> - Is she a fugitive?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> Then why y'all looking for her?<eos> What makes you think she up here?<eos> It was reported to us that she was.<eos> Who in the hell is this?<eos> He's gonna back me up I got to put my boot up your ass out here in front of everybody.<eos> Sexy.
What makes you think she up here?<eos> It was reported to us that she was.<eos> Who in the hell is this?<eos> He's gonna back me up I got to put my boot up your ass out here in front of everybody.<eos> Sexy.<eos> Little sister barking loud now.<eos> You think she got any bite?<eos> Ellstin, we asking you is she here out of courtesy.<eos> We were told this was her last known location.<eos> Reportedly against her will.
You're to be in this house from 9:00 P.M. to 9:00 A.M. every day.<eos> You're not to consume alcohol or illegal drugs.<eos> You are not to associate with any known criminals.<eos> And we have an appointment on the 23rd in my office.<eos> It's yours to screw up.<eos> Well, then you have nothing to worry about.<eos> Be a second.<eos> Hey. Can I call you right back?<eos> Rick? Uh, no, I... I called that off.<eos> Why?
-Yeah, totally.<eos> You're in your experimental phase.<eos> All you wanna do is fuck a woman or black guy, have some adventure and still be able to afford a Birkin bag.<eos> Shit, I'm in!<eos> Fuck it.<eos> You know me.<eos> Sign me up.<eos> Was that who Piper was?<eos> No, no, Piper was different.<eos> Why?
Mm. You got cold hands.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You should get some mittens or something.<eos> Slow down.<eos> You're gonna choke.<eos> Hey, Joe, you seen Kallie?<eos> Nah.<eos> Why?
Mother!<eos> You won't even bow to me!<eos> We're equal now.<eos> Both mothers to a king.<eos> This tension is unbearable.<eos> We must sustain it.<eos> - Sister, I am so sorry.<eos> - Get word to my son, Richard Grey, and tell him to bring Prince Edward here from Wales.<eos> People are already taking sides and I fear the outcome.<eos> - Elizabeth?
No!<eos> Get her before somebody else hits her.<eos> And that.<eos> Pick her up!<eos> Here you go, Rodney.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Jim, come on.<eos> Take the finger off.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
Everything.<eos> ♪ You're giving me a heart attack ♪<eos> Do you see that guy over there?<eos> ♪ It's like you're always there... ♪<eos> The only reason why I wanted Olly Murs was to remind my stupid ex-boyfriend how much he loves me, and now look.<eos> He's macking with some skank to our favorite song!<eos> And he doesn't even care.<eos> That's why we did all this?<eos> For an ex?<eos> Cassie...
- No, I'm fine. I-I--<eos> I got a little, uh, info on our vic.<eos> He dresses as Everett Wentworth and takes pictures with the tourists and the club patrons.<eos> Anybody want to come in?<eos> Anybody, anybody?<eos> You guys? Hey!<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Hi. - Take a pic with me. Hey, one more.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ready?
The vic is still a John Doe.<eos> What's all this? This stuff... was found inside the hidden pocket... on the vic's jacket.<eos> Our vic was a pickpocket.<eos> Loser.<eos> Look, I-I-I-I'm sorry, that's inappropriate and unprofessional.<eos> I'm not supposed to have an opinion, but... that guy was out there taking pictures with tourists, innocent tourists, while he was stealing from 'em.<eos> Pictures, pictures.<eos> You two want to take a pic? - Yeah. Sure.<eos> - All right.<eos> Ready?
I saw what happened at that double murder in SoHo last week.<eos> That cop's brother, Darius Bishop.<eos> Lieutenant Bishop's little brother.<eos> It didn't happen the way you think it did.<eos> He only killed Darius to save the girl.<eos> And the rest I will tell you when I see our deal in writing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before I grab pad and pen, let me ask you one thing.<eos> Did you get a good look at him?<eos> This vigilante?
Once this circle is completely filled in, we will be a perfect company.<eos> And then we'll be able to get even better trophy wives...<eos> - Halfasian ones!<eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.<eos> You can't go in there. I never told you this, but I once came up late at night looking for Jack, and you were in a wedding dress dancing with one of his suits.<eos> Mr. Donaghy will see you now.<eos> [Indistinct chatter and laughter] Stayat-home Lemon.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Did you already run out of things to do today?<eos> Pfft! What? No.
Cupcake sandwich.<eos> [Sighs] Oh, crap.<eos> Motherhood has made me go soft. [Door unlocking]<eos> Lutz, the food is here.<eos> Come eat... All:<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Cover the food!<eos> Blimpie's!<eos> Cerie, you heard the man...<eos> Blimpie's.
They usually come in a blue envelope.<eos> Ziva...! Wait a minute, you got Ziva tickets, too?<eos> Relax, Tony, it's been a while, okay?<eos> Last time, I think it was, what, like, six years ago?<eos> What, no, no.<eos> Six years ago!<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You've been hiding a ticket connection for six years?<eos> Who else have you gotten tickets for?<eos> Nobody.
I don't know, Joe. Did it not... motivate you to... to want to do good?<eos> It is clearly why you want to help others, save others.<eos> Every life is... is Ryan Hardy's responsibility.<eos> Oh. Ryan, the narcissism in that is... is truly beautiful.<eos> No.<eos> That's not true. Then what... what drives you?<eos> What drives you?<eos> Death. Death does.<eos> It, uh, it fuels me.<eos> Me, too.
Not for sure.<eos> The seismics the Ewings did are 2-dimensional and 20 years old.<eos> I've saved up enough money to do some 3-d seismics.<eos> That's what the run to laredo was all about?<eos> I've been saving for this for 10 years, Elli.<eos> I need to know if there's any oil down there.<eos> [ Sighs ] Look, if there isn't, I'll let it go once and for all.<eos> I promise.<eos> But I owe it to papi to find out.<eos> And to myself.
Coffee.<eos> The beverage of choice for recovering alcoholics everywhere.<eos> Been a long time.<eos> John Ross told me he didn't exactly give you the warmest welcome when he saw you.<eos> I hope you can forgive him.<eos> And I, for one, am happy that you don't hate Dallas anymore.<eos> [ Sighs ] I never hated Dallas.<eos> Just everything else that came with it.<eos> J.R. didn't make things easy for you, did he?<eos> Well [Chuckles] you, either, for that matter.
Mm, actually, 38 and a half, but I'm gonna let him have his moment.<eos> But I didn't come here to brag.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> I'm just here to inspire and encourage, because if I can do it, you can do it.<eos> All it takes is submitting to this simple program and being married to a wonderful woman who will actually slap pizza out of your hand.<eos> Truthfully, I had to tear it out of his teeth. Really?<eos> Yeah, it's like getting a sock away from a dog.<eos> All right, I think we have time for one more share.<eos> I better get this over with.<eos> Walk of shame...
Indeed.<eos> Micheletto - call the night watch.<eos> There was some unpleasantness in the streets.<eos> And so I shall escort the good Lord Vitelli safely home.<eos> Rodrigo.<eos> No, no. It's no good. Come here.<eos> It's no good!<eos> My love... it happens to every man once in a while.<eos> Not to me.<eos> To every man.
Schmidt, you said you would leave me alone.<eos> - You said you would leave...<eos> - He crossed a line.<eos> You said you would leave me alone.<eos> Funny seeing you here.<eos> Hey.<eos> You have to go.<eos> Yeah, you have to go over there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye-bye.
Take the damn gun, you little backwoods ass...<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Yo, cowboy.<eos> How's the ankle doing?<eos> Besides the flesh wound from the bullet, just peachy.<eos> You reached for the rifle.<eos> You dropped the rifle.<eos> You should have put the safety on.<eos> Look, I'm just trying to make sure you're all right.<eos> Yeah, no thanks to you.
We both know that dear, old dad wasn't always so dear to ma.<eos> Yeah. So?<eos> Where's that list?<eos> There.<eos> There is probably somebody on this list that dad had an affair with.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> You know, you get more traffic here at night than a 7-Eleven.<eos> You said if I needed to talk...<eos> Felicia packed a bag, went to her sister's.<eos> Why?
Wait.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Awesome, right?<eos> And they're really stepping it up this year--<eos> Super Bowl tix.<eos> Super Bowl tickets?<eos> All I ever got was a discount Dunkin' Donuts card and a free eye exam.<eos> Yeah, I gave that stuff to my dad.<eos> But you've got the real prize....<eos> Me.
I figured, but thanks for the information anyway.<eos> Whiner<eos> So, neo-terrorists, war-lords, mercenaries, doomsday extremists Let's see who you've been dealing with.<eos> Ezekiel? Why does that ..<eos> Wait a minute! I know that name! But it can't be him It's immpossible<eos> I've got a file on him, if it's of any use to you.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - I've been after that guy for a while<eos> As an ally, you'd let me read that file?<eos> You!
Brace for impact<eos> System error Sir!<eos> You're in imminent danger!<eos> This is probably gonna hurt a lot<eos> War Machine, is that you?<eos> Sorry I guess I must've overslept!<eos> I guess I'll really have to hook you up with those women when this is all over<eos> - Rhodey...<eos> - How did he...<eos> Oh .. Thank goodness
Stop!<eos> Why can't we hear the sirens?<eos> No, no, no, stop!<eos> Tell 'em to... call the FAA.<eos> The Feds?<eos> Yes.<eos> They got to shut down this whole airspace.<eos> Uh, okay, what if the government built this thing?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Why?
No, you're totally seasoned.<eos> Don't mock me, boy.<eos> I'm not mocking you.<eos> Why do you think I'm mocking you?<eos> How old are you anyway?<eos> 12?<eos> - I'm 21.<eos> - 21.<eos> 20-freaking-1.<eos> Unbelievable.
Sure.<eos> I posted that photo on Yahoo!<eos> Answers and got it translated.<eos> The Chinese character.<eos> It's jiao.<eos> That that's really sad.<eos> I'm going to the police after school.<eos> I'm gonna tell them about the journal you found.<eos> - Do not do that.<eos> - Why?
Hmm. Why don't you look at that fancy watch of yours and tell me what time it is?<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> I know.<eos> It's seven minutes past what the hell are you thinking accepting gifts from crazy-ass clients?<eos> She caught me off guard.<eos> I want to keep her around.<eos> She pays well.<eos> She is one glass of wine away from tying you up in the attic and boiling your bunny.<eos> Look, taking that watch is just a bad idea.<eos> Why?
So you were second to last?<eos> Yeah.<eos> First of the winners. I have to say, though, obviously I would like to mock you for your hopeless codriving skills, but watching this on that rally circuit, a deeply impressive spectacle, it really was.<eos> Yeah, it is a deeply impressive car.<eos> It's weird, I've never been a fan of the Continental, but I drove the little V8 engine one last year and I thought that was pretty good as well. Yeah, absolutely.<eos> They have done a great deal to improve the car over the years.<eos> But the trouble is, they haven't really done anything to improve the people who buy them.<eos> I mean, they do all that engineering work and then they sell it to Mario Balotelli.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Who?
This is it, Ernie!<eos> The day I've been waiting for my whole life!<eos> Oh, Larry, when I'm boss, you can finally quit dancing, and I'll buy you a car similar to the one you want that I can get through a business connection.<eos> He is my son, and I am so proud of him.<eos> Come on up here Rallo.<eos> (gasps)<eos> What?<eos> Get the (bleep) outta here!<eos> This kid here, he's got the street smarts, the charisma and the meatballs to lead this family.<eos> To Rallo!
That's why you're greedy.<eos> You're born with their luck, so you're lonely.<eos> I'm not lonely.<eos> The man you're dating will be your ruin.<eos> Break up! Dump him at once, sister!<eos> I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> I told you I can't work mornings!<eos> Bad brother!<eos> Why?<eos> why?

Chun-ho?<eos> This is serious!<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Monica!<eos> Who!<eos> What!<eos> This is my favorite picture!<eos> Why!<eos> Yesung!<eos> Why!
You didn't kill anyone!<eos> She died because of me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Very sorry.<eos> Why're you sorry!<eos> No one apologized to you!<eos> Why are you so sorry!<eos> If you speak out, you'll be ordered to leave.<eos> Please help my Yesung.<eos> My daughter.
Trying to get Monica Eton to file a sexual harassment suit against Daniel Hardman?<eos> I know you think you're trying to help me, but drop it.<eos> - Did Mike pull it off?<eos> - Yep. - He suspect you were in on it?<eos> - Nope. Sign this confidentiality agreement.<eos> I'll waive my claim.<eos> One-time offer, take it or leave it.<eos> I decided to farm out the case.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Daniel Hardman.
- Anything else?<eos> - Yes. He was partner, and I had to say "no" to him.<eos> And it made me feel disgusting every single day.<eos> Will people corroborate your account?<eos> It was common knowledge within the firm.<eos> Any number of people knew, including him.<eos> Let the record show that my client indicated Harvey Specter.<eos> Monica, I have one more question for you.<eos> To whom did Jessica tell you to hand in your resignation?<eos> Louis Litt.
- Hey.<eos> Don't touch the roses.<eos> I just spray-painted them.<eos> Well, happy Valentine's Day.<eos> - Or un-Valentine's Day.<eos> - Lana is helping me to host.<eos> Angelo, I cannot thank you enough for letting me have this here.<eos> Quick question for you... are your neighbors the cool kind or the calling-in-a-noise-violation kind?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Why?
- "What did we do wrong?<eos> - Why didn't she tell us?" And now I get it!<eos> - You get what?<eos> You are driving her away!<eos> She doesn't tell us things, important things,<eos> - because you do things like this!<eos> - That is absolutely ridiculous.<eos> I wanna get close to her and every time I build a bridge, it gets washed away when you behave like this!<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> You too!
Good, leave!<eos> Don't forget to take some money!<eos> _<eos> Ted.<eos> First day of school.<eos> You nervous?<eos> What do you think?<eos> It seems silly to ask, but do you know where you're going?<eos> I'll just follow you.<eos> - Hello, everyone.
Tell me this is not a fantastic spot for a date.<eos> It's not bad.<eos> I like a challenge.<eos> - What's albatross?<eos> - I'm sorry. What?<eos> Wendy was working on something called albatross, and I'm guessing that since she reached out to you, that you know what it is.<eos> Wow, you really suck at dating.<eos> I never said this was a date, you did.<eos> - Ouch.<eos> - Albatross.
Shut up!<eos> Don't be fooled, Waris.<eos> That's all it is. Front.<eos> Inside, I'm shaking like a leaf.<eos> I'm here by the skin of my bloody teeth.<eos> First Indian director this place has ever had.<eos> So, we've got to stick together, haven't we?<eos> Make our little show work.<eos> That'll teach them.<eos> Who?
Well, it is.<eos> Listen, I should be there.<eos> Let me help.<eos> No, we can't risk it.<eos> We got a new boss at the bureau -- she's keeping a close eye on us.<eos> I'll let you know the minute we locate the box.<eos> Do it soon.<eos> I want you to move off the Bellmiere case.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
What can I do for you, Agent Callaway?<eos> Let's talk about Senator Pratt.<eos> I have this habit where I like to give every case a good once-over before putting it to bed.<eos> That's why I called him.<eos> He told me a very interesting story about a man named James Bennett.<eos> He's a convicted cop killer, and it turns out he's also the father of your C.I.<eos> James is Neal's dad, yes.<eos> He told me another very interesting story -- now, stop me if you've heard this one -- about James Bennett's late partner, Ellen Parker.<eos> As it turns out, she was amassing evidence against him.<eos> Against Pratt?

Seriously, get your shit together. Mother?<eos> - Listen, I'm sorry, I take... - Equal responsibility, with Lana... Wh-?<eos> C'mon, Katy Hepburn!<eos> The stupid Border Patrol shot me, twice, and I could really use a medivac chopper.<eos> I'm kinda near -- hey, where -- Goddammit man, pace yourself!<eos> See? They just get more and more elaborate, and then it's "ha ha beep" and then somehow I'm the idiot. What?<eos> No no no this isn't a voi-- Smail.<eos> Well, I'm sure there's a lesson in there somewhere, but -- ow!<eos> That oughta do 'er.<eos> Gracias a Diós!

Pambit!<eos> Wrong X-Man, dumbass!<eos> Non lui!<eos> Il papa!<eos> Spar'al papa!<eos> - Ohhh, shit!<eos> Pam!<eos> Ungh!<eos> Rrrgh. I'm fine!<eos> Yeah me too, asshole!
Love the new look, sis. Reminds me of me.<eos> So I know dad was only here to protect his rep, but you risked everything to avenge me.<eos> - That's so sweet.<eos> - Let's not get teary-eyed.<eos> I was just mad you weren't around to baby-sit your niece.<eos> Stop toying with her and finish it!<eos> - M'gann!<eos> - Incoming!<eos> - I'll finish him.<eos> - Sorry, no.
Oh, you call that a cross?<eos> Give me the damn Krazy Glue, Carley.<eos> Give me your Benadryl.<eos> Now, this is a cross Jesus would be proud to be nailed to.<eos> You want to play with this?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, careful with those throwing stars.<eos> They could pierce a jugular.<eos> - You gotta get me out of here.<eos> - Why?
Dad's super excited.<eos> Planned the whole thing.<eos> Invited his buds from the gun club.<eos> It's kind of sweet.<eos> Hey. Look what I stole from work.<eos> - Three cheers for Cap'n Cappuccino.<eos> - Like cream with that hostility?<eos> No, it's fine. Whisk my best friend off when I'm about to have a baby, no biggie.<eos> - We're telling people already?<eos> - Not "people." Just V.
I think you need fresher cultural references. Please, Jeannie, please, please, come on,<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> I need her here. Please, Jeannie...<eos> ♪ I'm gonna touch the sky... ♪<eos> Oh-ho, dushkins in the house!<eos> Talkin' 'bout the dushkins in the h-h-house! Whoa!<eos> I got us set up in the conference room and I have some exciting expansion ideas that'll take the dushkin clubs fucking global.<eos> Yeah, we really want to go in a different direction, Clyde.<eos> You want to do what?<eos> Jeannie!
Ted, respectfully, are you sure that this was the right girl for you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> She was crazy.<eos> Absolutely a nightmare.<eos> It's totally not worth the trouble.<eos> I mean, no matter how... no matter how great the sex was.<eos> Uh-oh. Stay with us, buddy.<eos> No matter how hot and passionate and surprising, possibly illegal...<eos> I don't like this.<eos> Me, neither.
I'm gonna win her back.<eos> Barney and Robin are gonna be so happy I'm happy.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you just unhook my bra?<eos> Shh. There, there.<eos> That night was the big gallery show.<eos> Hey. I'm so sorry.<eos> I decided to grab a snack from the bodega.<eos> Why?
I'd read it a before laying down to sleep.<eos> Pozajmiees me?<eos> All right.<eos> But do not lose it!<eos> This story is a favorite of my dad's.<eos> I promise.<eos> Who are you going isprileati story?<eos> Esteli?<eos> No.<eos> A ... very special.
All right.<eos> But do not lose it!<eos> This story is a favorite of my dad's.<eos> I promise.<eos> Who are you going isprileati story?<eos> Esteli?<eos> No.<eos> A ... very special.<eos> Someone who is not on this board.<eos> Bye.
- Yeah.<eos> I wish it was.<eos> - Hey. Trading your morning run for a little sunrise meditation?<eos> Nah.<eos> I'm just out here counting regrets.<eos> You up to double digits yet?<eos> Yeah, I'm way past that.<eos> You talk to Abby since... No mas.<eos> My legs hurt.<eos> Yeah, me too.
But the last thing Bello wants is more bloodshed.<eos> So that's why we're getting bigger guns?<eos> It's called "deterrence."<eos> Hey, Briggs! Yo. Please tell me there's some hopeful news on the Jangles front.<eos> I wish.<eos> I still don't even really know what the guy looks like.<eos> Every time I saw him, he had a bandana on his face.<eos> Course, he always had those damn rattling keys.<eos> But, uh, yeah, it's still all I got to go on.<eos> Why?
Sis, you go see Rourke, okay?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I had to slip out of the office when dear old Dad wasn't looking.<eos> Working late on a Sunday?<eos> Yeah, well, first Sunday of every month, we do the books together.<eos> Fun, fun, fun.<eos> But enough of that.<eos> Thank you for the drink.<eos> I'm glad you called.<eos> Me, too.
[Beeping] Step back, please.<eos> Belt?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Hey, mom! I got to pee.<eos> You don't have to pee, Billy!<eos> You peed 10 minutes ago.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm cleaning!<eos> Yes, I know that, mother.<eos> But why?
Okay, as much as we have to catch this guy, I think we're out of time.<eos> We let too many people get close.<eos> We may have passed the point of no return without ever realizing it.<eos> What, so, you think there's no way of covering everything up this time?<eos> I want to stay and fight, I do, but...<eos> I don't know.<eos> All of the evidence is eventually going to lead them right here, and your DNA is on everything.<eos> Okay, wait-- what if the only way for all of us to be free is to give them what they want?<eos> And what's that?<eos> Me.
Am I the only one freaked out by that?<eos> No, I think Abed was just showing that he's accepting of our relationship.<eos> No, really.<eos> What was it?<eos> Hey, Annie, sad news.<eos> They closed the ski slopes.<eos> A dozen scouts got buried in an avalanche.<eos> So sad.<eos> I say we cut our losses and head home.<eos> What? Why?
She's cursed them both to die.<eos> What names?<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> What if they're ours?<eos> George says that she'll kill us all with her cursing, so he has commissioned special charms to be made that will protect us.<eos> Er... Lords and Ladies of the court!<eos> A toast to our newly betrotheds... and King Edward and Queen Elizabeth of England!<eos> Edward, you cannot let him do that to me!<eos> I'll have my mother speak to him.<eos> Your mother?
Wait, please!<eos> At least let me see my brother, the King.<eos> No! Aargh!<eos> Oh, please!<eos> Let's go home to Warwick Castle.<eos> Richard.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Truly?<eos> Anne!<eos> Oh, God, Anne!
Suck it up.<eos> Unh. Morning, Claire.<eos> Oh. You don't look so good.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> Heh. Tell me about it.<eos> You should see a doctor.<eos> That looks really nasty.<eos> Well, thank you for your concern.<eos> I have, in fact, been stitched up, so I'm gonna be fine.<eos> You on the other hand, not so much.
What is this?<eos> Nitroglycerine?<eos> Is there something wrong with your heart?<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> Huh? Dr. Glass.<eos> How long have you been taking it? Huh? Tell me.<eos> How long?<eos> A couple of months.<eos> You can't tell anybody about this, okay?<eos> Especially not Tom.
All right! We're good to go!<eos> Let's load 'em up, people!<eos> Five minutes, we're out of here.<eos> Just like old times, huh, Colonel? So, where are we going?<eos> Tom and I were thinking first stop Charleston.<eos> Warn them about the Brazil relocation.<eos> We need to regroup, let them know the situation, then we thought we'd go find Hathaway's people.<eos> Point of that being?<eos> Form a new resistance movement.<eos> The Human resistance movement.
Man, it was hard to run in those sandals.<eos> - They made you wear sandals?<eos> - That was just the beginning.<eos> Every time I stole second, I had to say an act of contrition.<eos> - Is this thing working?<eos> - Come on, Charlie.<eos> Get serious.<eos> You're right, you're right.<eos> Did you know our pitcher had to give a sermon on the mound?<eos> Hey, guys.
- Yeah.<eos> But Ivan doesn't know everything.<eos> And I always play better when I'm down, which is why I wanted your artwork and not this.<eos> 'Cause if I go down, I wanna go down fighting with something I believe in.<eos> So you genuinely liked it.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wish was old enough to vote for you.<eos> Me too.<eos> Me too.
I need to control the flow of information.<eos> It's essential to any successful business.<eos> So no cell phones, no wifi at all.<eos> It makes sense, but it certainly sends a message.<eos> That I'm a tyrant?<eos> That you don't trust your employees.<eos> Yeah, what happened to Cibrex's "big happy family"?<eos> Well... trust is a complicated business.<eos> Mr. Ramsay, there's a possibility that someone wanted to kill you.<eos> Me?
My secret admirer requested I wear a hat with a feather in it.<eos> I'm like, "which one?"<eos> Really?<eos> This secret admirer have any other requests?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> She asked me to bring some poetry to recite at the party.<eos> These, uh, kids at the party...<eos> They wouldn't be the popular ones by any chance?<eos> The most popular.<eos> Why?
Let me explain something to you...<eos> Alex and I are very old friends.<eos> We have an affectionate relationship.<eos> I need that.<eos> I'm human.<eos> It's about comfort, right?<eos> Hey, Morello, remember when we used to comfort each other?<eos> Sure.<eos> You were very comfortable.<eos> Hey, guys.
She OD'd.<eos> I saw her wobbling around the cafeteria this morning.<eos> So she killed herself a different way.<eos> I'm the one responsible.<eos> No!<eos> This isn't on you.<eos> It's on me.<eos> I'm the one who finked to Pornstache about Neptune.<eos> I'm the reason the drugs are still comin' in.<eos> Why?
Does anyone hear me?<eos> Please, I need to speak to the Gamboa.<eos> Here Gamboa.<eos> What is Drink?<eos> I missed you so much<eos> Gamboa, you gotta help me.<eos> Here are some guys armed to the teeth.<eos> They beat De La KVADRA and keep all prisoners.<eos> They have instructions to find it,.<eos> Me?
I'm trying to get to know child with his father.<eos> Roberto, listen to me.<eos> Know that you have a red folder.<eos> wentforyou.<eos> - Shit!<eos> I should hurry up.<eos> Listen, if you see that someone is following you, somethingweird,anything it does not fit, get<eos> Gamboawillcallyou , He will not help you.<eos> You can trust him.<eos> Just him.
So whatever you do, don't look like you're faking it because this Meyer the Liar thing is just an avalanche of shit right now.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it. And I'm swimming in it and I'm breathing it in through my snorkel.<eos> You need to issue a statement, okay?<eos> - "My private life is private."<eos> - Yes. "Besides, Andrew and I, we get along just fine."<eos> Ironically, Ben, we actually are getting along just fine.<eos> That's great. That's a great fake.<eos> No, it's not a fake. That's a real thing.<eos> Oh. Well, great. Say that.<eos> SELINA:
- I stand with the President.<eos> "I stand With the President"? Why did I say that?<eos> Can we pretend you didn't say it?<eos> What will people think I mean?<eos> That you stand with the President.<eos> I mean, there's not a ton of ambiguity with that one.<eos> Well, who knew that being sexually assaulted wouldn't be the worst thing to happen in my day, huh?<eos> That's something for the memoirs.<eos> I am never going back there.<eos> "Danteeksi"?
TMZ, The Enquirer, every tabloid's running with the "rumor."<eos> Right.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Well, Rex did say he told another player.<eos> Yes, but I do not believe that that player would have gone to the press.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I've scheduled an interview with Anderson Cooper 48 hours from now.<eos> We just got to keep this thing from blowing up until then, okay?<eos> In the meantime, anybody with connections to a reporter at Sportscom, that's apparently where this story first broke.<eos> Sportscom?
Yeah, he's the pancake guy.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> I sent them to their dad's.<eos> Are there still reporters out there?<eos> Counted 15, all camped out at the end of the driveway.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Xeno, shut off all the lights.<eos> I want it to look like there's no activity in the house.<eos> And give him your car keys.<eos> Why?
So I should bring him back in a few days?<eos> - No, I don't think that's necessary.<eos> - Really?<eos> Not even for, you know, just the check-in?<eos> If in a couple of weeks he still has some symptoms, you can make an appointment.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> So I see you in a couple of weeks.<eos> If he has a symptom.<eos> Well, you know actually I think I'm gonna bring my other cat in.<eos> Why?
You've asked your three questions.<eos> Attorneys in an inquest are permitted to ask questions, but only a total of three.<eos> - Really?<eos> CLAYPOOL:<eos> Sorry. - What if I'm fast?<eos> - Heh. No, I'm sorry.<eos> I'll have to ask you to take your seat.<eos> HOBSON: Mr. Claypool, I'm Wilk Hobson, counsel for Wolf Bland Insurance.<eos> Unlike Mrs. Florrick, I have just one question, if that's okay?<eos> - Yes, certainly.
Is he reluctant because we're on the opposite side of cases, is that it?<eos> I mean, we've faced each other a few times, but not a lot.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hate this stuff.<eos> It's so high school, you know?<eos> Are you sure he's not seeing someone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does he know that you and I are friends?<eos> I-I... I don't know.<eos> Why?
Chang did what?<eos> Oh, cool. - What are we protesting? - You guys.<eos> You've been hogging that study room for three years.<eos> Somebody finally stood up to you, and you had them banned.<eos> Why must our people always be the victims? - What do we want?<eos> - Justice!<eos> - When do we want it?<eos> - Now!<eos> - What do we want?<eos> - Justice! - Oh, my God.
The clue is in the name.<eos> Miss Gardner.<eos> I apologise, My Lord.<eos> A man about to be attacked does not have to wait for permission.<eos> The law tells us, in the right circumstances, a pre-emptive strike is justified.<eos> In this case, a loaded shotgun aimed squarely at his head!<eos> We only have Mr Scott's appalling aim to thank that Mr Kumarin is here and not being scraped off the nightclub wall with a trowel.<eos> Well done, Will.<eos> RUSSIAN ACCENT:<eos> Pleasure.
- Thank you, my friend.<eos> - Pleasure.
No, no, not that I can think of.<eos> I used to be Territorial Army, two tours, Iraq.<eos> My number.<eos> Any time you want to talk.<eos> Go on.<eos> Back in the day, the IRA used to concentrate their minds on an invisible flame to resist interrogation.<eos> You mean torture.<eos> It wasn't the yanks invented waterboarding.<eos> You were using it on us 40 years ago.<eos> "Us"?
- Yeah?<eos> Want to grab dinner sometime?<eos> You know, nothing too serious, just some good food, fine wine, and... hot butt-naked sex.<eos> You really think now's the time to talk about that?<eos> Well, given that we could be dead in 60 seconds, I'd say there's no time like the present.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Mikey? !<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're all right.<eos> You OK?
I'll kill you myself.<eos> Katherine is gone.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Hey, Caroline, look. I put a lot of thought into this and decided to defer school for now.<eos> This werewolf pack I'm helping, they need me.<eos> I know it's lame to do this over the phone, but I figure this way's harder for you to kill me.<eos> I'm really, really sorry, care, but this is important.<eos> You ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, Caroline.
You ready to start spending your nights safe with me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Hey, I'm going to pick us up some big belly burger right now.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> OK.<eos> We just want to be friendly.<eos> What, we scare you or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you do.<eos> Me, though, not so much.
I'll call you as soon as I find anything.<eos> Thanks, hon.<eos> There once was a bird of yellow bill.<eos> He hopped upon my windowsill.<eos> I lured him in with bits of bread And then I smashed his fucking head.<eos> Abby, me darling.<eos> Top of the morning to you.<eos> He never come home?<eos> What a setup you got here.<eos> Unbelievable.
Quicker minds.<eos> Well done, darling.<eos> Right, I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> 'Night.<eos> Third.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Don't give up your day job.<eos> I enjoyed that.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Please yourself.<eos> But beware...<eos> I will tell you everything and you will die of jealousy.<eos> Harry.<eos> Book I told you about.<eos> Oh, my hands are all dirty.<eos> Sorry, Eve, this is Harry Dunn.<eos> Eve Travers.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Likewise.
- Why didn't you come to me?<eos> - Because I wasn't sure so...<eos> - So you decided to ruin the one bright spot in my otherwise crappy life right now?<eos> - I was just trying to help.<eos> - Help? Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> - I'm sorry, Regina...<eos> - Who else did you tell?<eos> - Daphne?<eos> Your parents?
It's Gabriel Friedman now, yo.<eos> I mean, Rallo.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> DeVon happened to me.<eos> I can't compete with that guy.<eos> Roberta was right about me.<eos> I was a joke.<eos> You were and you are.<eos> But I need you two to get back together, and she's never gonna take you back looking like a nerdy... J-O-O.<eos> Sorry, Rallo.
We're through.<eos> Hi, is this the Waffle House?<eos> Let me speak to Jalisa.<eos> Baby, I got to quit you.<eos> Hello, Maureen, we're done.<eos> Now give the phone to your mom.<eos> Hey, Doreen, you know why your daughter's crying?<eos> Same goes for you.<eos> It's over.<eos> Why?
I need your help.<eos> You need my help?<eos> (forced laughing) I'll never help you.<eos> I'm going after Black Villain.<eos> I will help you. Okay, then.<eos> First thing we need to do is get you out of here.<eos> Good luck. This place is locked down tighter than a friendship bracelet around your mom's fat-ass wrist.<eos> Ha, just kidding, your mom has no friends! (laughs):<eos> Now eat this.<eos> Why?
He's trying to figure out what kind of car he should buy.<eos> That doesn't explain why you were behind the water heater.<eos> It doesn't?<eos> Um, so... you were saying you could help me?<eos> Oh, yeah, I have a paper route, and one of the other boys was beaten to death by his mom's boyfriend.<eos> Shall I put in a good word for you?<eos> I got to take this.<eos> It's Douglas.<eos> Hey, Douglas.<eos> A Hyundai?
Good one.<eos> Loosen me up with some pre-match humor.<eos> I like it.<eos> Nah, I found somebody better-- Rudy Sorrenson.<eos> He's in, you're out.<eos> Hilarious!<eos> Stickin' with the bit.<eos> I love that this is our relationship now.<eos> This match is too important, and you're a wild card. I'm sorry.<eos> Jay...
I have good friends and have fun.<eos> Captain trust me.<eos> And I was appointed vice-captain.<eos> Roberto,<eos> - I'm Roberto!<eos> You're looking for him, but it is no more.<eos> He's gone.<eos> So it's probably best not to be more about.<eos> Never again.<eos> Burbuha ...
Without this folder, there is nothing what can we ponudis.<eos> All that is left of this world Gamboa, is mine.<eos> The content of the red folder, not disappeared.<eos> There is one man in the head.<eos> Roberto Schneider.<eos> Roberto Schneider ...<eos> Professor Schneider does not exist.<eos> Now he is no more of an idiot.<eos> How do you call it?<eos> Burbuha.
That sounds amazing.<eos> But how can you afford it?<eos> Ah, bup, bup, bup.<eos> Nothing is too good for milady.<eos> Besides, a month without antidepressants isn't going to kill me.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Oh, you don't have to say anything.<eos> Just pack your bag, and your chariot will arrive at 6:00.<eos> Yeah, would it be okay if we took my chariot?<eos> Why?
Issy is afraid, Father.<eos> Come on!<eos> Warwick and George are sailing for Calais. We must act, Mother.<eos> Annie!<eos> It was a boy.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> It is your fault.<eos> Queen Elizabeth is with child again.<eos> We must have a son before she does.<eos> Elizabeth?
George is driven by his own ambition and greed...<eos> He would fight against me with the very woman who tore our father apart?<eos> Warwick will use Anne to bind them together.<eos> Then restore Henry to the throne.<eos> It was Warwick who lit a fire in me, taught me to fight, to win, to drag her down and punish her for what she did, for what she did to all of us.<eos> And now he stands with her! Did none of it matter? !<eos> Warwick does not know loyalty and George will soon see this.<eos> George can't be pleased with his new set of circumstances.<eos> I'll wager he didn't even see them coming...<eos> Elizabeth.
And it's made me want to do that too.<eos> And what I want... is you.<eos> Now what?<eos> (Sighs) I'm not here to yell at you.<eos> Angelo has been trying to reach you.<eos> He wanted me to tell you that Regina's okay.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I guess she spent the night there.<eos> At Angelo's?<eos> Why?
Should you do that?<eos> She'll think it's weird if I don't.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Couldn't help notice you're sitting here all alone.<eos> I thought maybe you'd want some company?<eos> Sure.<eos> Your partner won't mind?<eos> "Partner"?
Weird.<eos> But I seriously doubt he has it in him to harm anybody.<eos> That leaves me.<eos> I'll take a polygraph right now.<eos> No one else had access? No.<eos> And the information wasn't on any electronic database?<eos> No--<eos> What?<eos> I gave a redacted summary to a TV reporter. Who?<eos> Bart Crowley.
What's she doing here?<eos> She just got in the van, Sergeant.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Maybe Cathy should've come along too.<eos> And Glenda the tea lady.<eos> Get back in the van.<eos> I won't get in the way, Sergeant, honest.<eos> No, you won't. Because you'll be in the van.<eos> Don't move till we get back.<eos> Right, you ready?
Me, my dad and Keke Rosberg, were on our way to the track and my dad was driving down this country lane, which off the edge of the road drops down into a field and there is a metre drop.<eos> Keke all of a sudden just pulls the- handbrake while my dad is driving.<eos> And my dad doesn't really know how to drive that well.<eos> He thinks he's a great driver...<eos> He's not here to argue.<eos> Lost the back end of the car and put it down into the ditch and we had to leave it there and walk to the track.<eos> There wasn't even a girl in the car?<eos> Who was Keke trying to impress?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Your dad. My dad, yes.
I can't hear you!<eos> Tiny kid, keeps to himself.<eos> - He's my brother.<eos> - He's your brother?<eos> You and your brother Dylan live in this house?<eos> You don't find that a bit strange?<eos> So it is just a lot of coincidental similarities, that may not be so coincidental after all.<eos> What have you done to him?<eos> !<eos> To Dylan?
Sorry, pig lady, but I can't help you.<eos> The only thing I know, is that I know nothing at all.<eos> It's possible, but dangerous.<eos> I can't explain why you're not dead yet.<eos> People from different realities commit suicide or start riots.<eos> I almost did myself for a while.<eos> I need...<eos> We need to get back. According to you we don't belong here.<eos> - I can't let my brother kill himself!<eos> - My brother.
Two for tea."<eos> It only gets worse from here.<eos> You can't be serious!<eos> Gil Thorpe is my nemesis!<eos> I hate to break it to you, Phil, but you're not Batman.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Gil is a snake and he's found the perfect way to mess with me.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that he was hiring me because of...<eos> I don't know?<eos> Me.
Gil is a snake and he's found the perfect way to mess with me.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that he was hiring me because of...<eos> I don't know?<eos> Me.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> What's your last name? !<eos> Right now?<eos> I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> I-I hate to do this, but I have to use my veto.<eos> Veto?
He's decided to drive down to Monte for a few weeks.<eos> Of course, as soon as he returns, I'll let you know.<eos> I'll look forward to it.<eos> Coke Norris was meant to speak against the sale of this Booth Hill.<eos> Only, he was killed by a hit-and-run driver on the way in.<eos> The ayes carried the day.<eos> That the Moonlight Room's motif, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, I'm hoping they might shed some light the disappear on this Georgina Bannard.<eos> I told you, I don't want you getting involved with them.<eos> - Why?
Who else uses that short cut?<eos> Most of the office staff, I'd have thought.<eos> Or it's a five-minute walk around the block.<eos> But you didn't see anyone else on the shop floor?<eos> No. No, I didn't. Thank goodness.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to say thanks, for getting me in on this.<eos> All hands.<eos> What do you make to it, then?<eos> Well, I think if I was going to murder someone... I wouldn't do it in a factory that was crawling with police.<eos> So, why here? Why now?
-Hey, a cat!<eos> I took a picture of it!<eos> -He's just weird. -Oh, relax.<eos> Hey, it's my wedding.<eos> -Someone must've invited him.<eos> -No one did.<eos> Radim doesn't remember him at all. He came on his own.<eos> I don't know what he wants and I don't want to know. I want him gone.<eos> He gives me the creeps, like he's some kind of threat.<eos> -Mainly for Radim. -Why?
Muck up our chance to clean up the projects?<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> He's a bad guy.<eos> He's going down.<eos> Is this about you getting your face in the paper?<eos> You just keep your hunch in your pants, you got that?<eos> Respect.<eos> Remember?<eos> Or you sink.<eos> 0 and 2.
Not by a long shot.<eos> Anyone could be on the take.<eos> As far as Beecher, I don't know.<eos> But if you follow that money they found on Szymanski you might not like what you find.<eos> You burned through those chips fast today, Lou.<eos> You're killing me, Jen. Killing me.<eos> Better luck tomorrow.<eos> Hey, old man.<eos> - Got that popcorn you wanted.<eos> - Out of my way. Sorry, Gramps.
You're nice, though, anyway.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I can tell.<eos> Joan says sometimes good people do bad things so give 'em a second chance.<eos> Wait, who is Joan?<eos> Old lady what lived here.<eos> But she died.<eos> She was wise cos she lived a long time so she knew lots of stuff, and she told me it.<eos> And it upsets me just thinking about her because I...<eos> Sorry, bruv.
Dale.<eos> Hmm? No, I...<eos> I ask for forgiveness every day.<eos> Mm-hmm. And God's keeping score.<eos> Is that it? You're just paving your way to the sweet by and by?<eos> No, ain't got nothing to do with that.<eos> God already has done it.<eos> - Done what?<eos> - Forgiven me.<eos> And everyone in here.
I mean, it's Jackson. He's not some corporate stranger.<eos> He's one of us.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> He's a smart kid.<eos> He's gonna follow our lead.<eos> No. No.<eos> We made this plan.<eos> We pulled it together.<eos> Look, I'm grateful to Harper Avery for an infusion of cash, but I'm-I'm not gonna let some-some...<eos> Plastics fellow?
Uh, gotta love LA.<eos> What are these people thinking?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We've had unsubstantiated reports about sharks swimming in the streets and falling from the skies.<eos> Does April know you coming?<eos> No.<eos> But at least we'll be in the hills away from the flooding. Alright.<eos> It's awfully nice of you to let her new boyfriend stay in your house.<eos> Don't remind me.<eos> Unbelievable.
Collin!<eos> Help me! It's getting away!<eos> Collin!<eos> I've got your back.<eos> Get its nose.<eos> Die already!<eos> It's coming back! - No!<eos> - Oh my gosh!<eos> Fin!<eos> Ready?
Their innocence is gone.<eos> But this is what you do to children every single day.<eos> When will you see, then?<eos> When will it stop?<eos> Riley farm.<eos> It's further out than we thought it was.<eos> He can't tell us anything.<eos> No!<eos> Anwar!<eos> Why?
Just.. I don't trust his kind of Mexicans.<eos> Perhaps I should wait outside.<eos> - Yeah. - No.<eos> No. Agent Cortes has been chasing Jangles for years. I need somebody to bounce this stuff off of.<eos> You couldn't have kept this more in-house?<eos> No, because nobody in-house would listen to me.<eos> I listened to you, okay?<eos> I just didn't agree with you.<eos> So why didn't you just trust my instincts?<eos> - Your instincts? For real?
I've been dying to get in on this ever since you started testing.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> The results of phase two have been amazing.<eos> Phase three should be a hoot.<eos> God, you can retract and resheath before you deploy.<eos> Exactly. That's the best thing about it.<eos> You have total control over the entire procedure.<eos> It's incredibly flexible if you don't get it right the first time.<eos> But I imagine you will.<eos> M-me?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> ♪ oh, oh, oh<eos> Noah!<eos> Get back here!<eos> ♪ Oh, oh, oh<eos> That's it.<eos> Your inner tube privileges are revoked.<eos> I'm telling your mom.<eos> No, you're not telling my mom.<eos> Unbelievable.
Even his name.<eos> You can't trust anything he says.<eos> I-I can't hear that right now.<eos> Just, just... I-I just want Amelia back.<eos> And I want you to have her back.<eos> I do.<eos> But I need you to understand what it is that I'm doing.<eos> My work is very important, and Amelia is at the heart of it.<eos> Mapping the connections within her brain mathematically... it can help millions of people.<eos> Millions.
Right.<eos> All right, let's start with: I'm the boss.<eos> Fine, you're the boss.<eos> You do as I say.<eos> You keep your opinions to yourself.<eos> Understood, Cap'n.<eos> And no indoor soccer.<eos> No, none.<eos> I'm sorry you got shot, Roy.<eos> Me, too.
He's drunk again.<eos> Oh, no, guys, guys. I-I was just messing with you.<eos> I have not had a drink since opening day.<eos> Mike, ah, I owe you and your whole family an apology.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I-I hope you can forgive me.<eos> - You gonna take this crap from him? - Shh.<eos> Yeah, and I'm gonna drop the assault charges.<eos> Well, thank you, Mr. McKendree, but honestly, I'm the one who should be apologizing to you.<eos> Why?
Unless I'm mistaken, the drink this lady just ordered is called the Minnesota Tidal Wave.<eos> Origin unknown.<eos> Oh, well, you know, Robin's been ordering them so much lately that we named it after her.<eos> You named a drink after me?<eos> Right there in the menu.<eos> I can't drink this.<eos> That's better.<eos> I'm still seething, but that's better.<eos> Okay, 20-Years-From-Now-Me, level with me.<eos> You. Us.
Make it now.<eos> Suite 742.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Here's that file you asked for.<eos> Headed over to the diner for some chicken pot pie.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> You know, ever since we've been back from L.A., you haven't said a word to me.<eos> We still haven't talked about what happened there.<eos> Have you told anyone?<eos> Not a soul.
Did you track the source of the text?<eos> I tried.<eos> The encryption's insane.<eos> It's gonna take weeks.<eos> Well, then we need to get started.<eos> Look at me. I know that you are hurting, but you need to stop blaming yourself, get on your computer, and dig until you find them.<eos> And I swear to God, when you do,<eos> I will help you save her.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> - Unbelievable.
Yeah, why are you leaving?<eos> No health insurance.<eos> Nobody can say for sure that they won't charge me if I stay through the storm, so...<eos> I'm all stitched up.<eos> So, is this good news?<eos> You guys find the bastard?<eos> Hm?<eos> Well... the mugger.<eos> The guy who stabbed me.<eos> No, sorry.
Unfortunately, yes, it does.<eos> - Ever heard of VAC Capital?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> They manage my money. Well, they're under SEC investigation for insider trading.<eos> Insider trading?<eos> On what? Did you tell Brandon Boyd that a drug trial was about to fail?<eos> What? I don't know. Maybe at the club.<eos> Well, he turned around and used that information to bet against Philia stock, made $500 million.<eos> Son of a bitch. $1/2 billion?<eos> Off your tip.
Well, I figured Goldie could use someone else normal here to support her.<eos> Right, exactly the way you supported her when you two were still married.<eos> Yeah, exactly. Oh.<eos> I am so sorry, Rocky.<eos> No children, no children.<eos> I know the invitation said "no kids," but my babysitter bailed on me in a text followed by another text saying, "did you get the weed?"<eos> Immediately followed by a third text saying,<eos> "oh, I'm so sorry, oops, that wasn't meant for you."<eos> Here, let me babysit while you go and put some makeup on.<eos> Why?
And then, like, two months later, I catch him cheating on me with the girl next door.<eos> Literally...next door.<eos> He's been living in Fort Lauderdale ever since.<eos> Okay?<eos> We good? Can we get back to work now?<eos> So you feel nothing for this guy.<eos> Oh. Oh, I feel something all right, like kicking his ass in front of all these nice people, but you're not worth ruining a good pair of shoes.<eos> Oh, I guess you got the papers.<eos> I was hoping to get here first, give them to you myself.<eos> Why?
It's gonna be okay.<eos> - Miss Rizzo...<eos> - Tony, don't talk.<eos> Just keep breathing.<eos> We're gonna get you help.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Hazel, just pack a bag and meet me in an hour off of Route 9, where-where we got engaged. Right, right by where...<eos> where we had the picnic.<eos> H-Hazel, who are you gonna believe?<eos> Them or me?
These are résumés.<eos> Please look them over and just keep us posted.<eos> I need to hire you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you working on at the moment?<eos> Employee background checks.<eos> Pass that off to the new investigator.<eos> I need you to do a background check on a partner.<eos> Who?<eos> Me.
Lend me your power.<eos> We need more strength!<eos> So Silas is appearing as Professor Shane.<eos> Wouldn't be my first choice.<eos> Well, it would be if you needed to brainwash Bonnie into committing a massacre.<eos> You need me to come home?<eos> No we got it.<eos> How's the cure search going?<eos> Well...<eos> Not great.
How did he die?<eos> Slowly... he was stabbed.<eos> He was dead before they dumped him here.<eos> What's strange is, that whoever did it then took the trouble to try and save him.<eos> It's probably to late to exfiltrate your girl in the Rezidentura.<eos> Amador didn't give her up.<eos> Everybody talks, it's biology.<eos> He didn't give her up.<eos> Gonna risk her life on that?<eos> And mine.
Aunt Janet helped me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Anyone can make the Golden Gate or Brooklyn Bridge, but we made the Tappan Zee.<eos> Anyhow, there's no need to rush, Frankie.<eos> I will be taking Brick to school today.<eos> - And there's a frittata for you in the oven.<eos> - Oh! I don't even know what that is!<eos> Thought you guys could use a pick-me-up.<eos> Oh, my God, you read my mind.<eos> Oh, me, too.
Not really.<eos> Too much stuff here. It's probably more like 30 for a full round.<eos> Oh...<eos> OK.<eos> Er...<eos> You all right?<eos> Not even a quick one?<eos> Tell... um...<eos> Finley.<eos> Finley.
If...<eos> Kyle wins tonight, um...<eos> I was just hoping maybe you could accept it for him.<eos> Are you not gonna be there? Jimmy, what are you doing?<eos> Look, this is your moment.<eos> You can't miss it. Stop sabotaging yourself.<eos> Whatever makes you do that, it's time to face it, once and for all.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> - Good luck... good luck tonight.<eos> - You too.
So I'm not gonna give you this letter.<eos> I think that you should do whatever you want...<eos> Concerning the settlement.<eos> I won't refute anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, it is actually not fair how beautiful you look.<eos> Oh, what's not fair is you're not going too.<eos> Oh, believe me, I'm gonna cry after you leave.<eos> - Is he not here? - No.<eos> Sorry.
I was just hoping maybe you could accept it for him.<eos> Are you not gonna be there?<eos> Jimmy, what are you doing?<eos> Look, this is your moment.<eos> You can't miss it.<eos> Stop sabotaging yourself.<eos> Whatever makes you do that, it's time to face it, once and for all.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> - Good luck... good luck tonight.<eos> - You too.
Yeah, try doing it in heels.<eos> I am.<eos> Wait.<eos> There's something I have to tell you.<eos> What?<eos> I know what was in your dad's letter.<eos> Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Hey!<eos> I made him tell us.<eos> What? "Us"?
What are you looking at?<eos> Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet.<eos> Look at this.<eos> "Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever."<eos> Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows.<eos> Neither race was happy to see me with those.<eos> Think you could take a break?<eos> Why?
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes this time To make it work.<eos> Just promise me you'll think about it.<eos> Yeah. O-okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Annabeth, are you okay?<eos> Me?<eos> I'm not the one who's about to stand up for another night.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You ready to give up yet, wade kinsella?<eos> Why?
Can we meet?<eos> 'Yeah...<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yep.<eos> I'd just... really need to talk. 'OK.'<eos> Seriously, are you all right?<eos> Some people came round, after you'd gone.<eos> What people?<eos> 'A man and a woman.<eos> Police.'
No! You need to be on the other side.<eos> Climb over the bloody car.<eos> You've got heavier...<eos> Oh!<eos> That was tied on!<eos> No, I took the rope off.<eos> We needed the rope.<eos> I took it off.<eos> I CAN go on the other side... as it turns out.<eos> Perfect.
Some fresh coffee, Mr Molesley.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> My God! Shut the door!<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Will you find me some clothes?<eos> Of course I will but...<eos> Will you see to Lady Mary? Say erm... Just say I've gone home with a headache.<eos> I can manage Lady Mary but Anna, we must tell someone...<eos> No, no, no! But you'll have to tell Mr Bates...<eos> Him least of all!
Andy, Tom, you will be our referees.<eos> - Thank you for volunteering.<eos> - Definitely didn't volunteer.<eos> I had much better things to do.<eos> Leslie said she'd pay me 100 bucks.<eos> And I had nothing better to do.<eos> I'm doing it for free.<eos> There's no way I'm losing this contest.<eos> Old-timey dress?<eos> Check.
You said you knew who that was.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Doug, no one gives a fuck.<eos> - I give an "f," okay?<eos> - You know, why don't we just do bunny ears and say "cheese"?<eos> Why don't we just take this goddamn fucking picture?<eos> Everyone do bunny ears, I'll do 'em on myself.<eos> I am.<eos> I still say you're an idiot.<eos> - Jeannie /
Get your purse, I want to show you something.<eos> Here it is.<eos> I don't have to say a word when I show a property like this, because it's...<eos> I mean, look at this view.<eos> The light, the space... it sells itself, really, a space like this.<eos> And the building...<eos> I thought you weren't gonna say a word.<eos> Didn't he say there's gonna be no words, And then words just blah-blah-blah.<eos> I like it. Do you?<eos> Me, too.
Okay, so...?<eos> Um, Marty, that night...<eos> The... you know, the night the merger fell through, and I blew the whistle on the rainmaker?<eos> Yes. Yes, that night, I said something to you.<eos> I was totally wasted and vulnerable and scared, but I meant it, meant...<eos> What I said, and I'm now done minimizing it and rationalizing and thinking instead of feeling.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Jesus, Jeannie.<eos> "Jesus, Jeannie."
There's something you need to know, Hannah.<eos> This is my house, and in my house, the odds are in your favor.<eos> - You paged?<eos> - I have to talk to you.<eos> - It's Prentiss.<eos> - What about him?<eos> Bad enough he took your job away. Now he's on my ass.<eos> He's giving me extra work.<eos> I was being so nice to him, and then he was like, "Go give an enema to Mr...<eos> Worthington.
Naples. I haven't seen her in too long a time.<eos> We're to be brothers.<eos> And, mindful of that honour, I should like to show you around the city.<eos> Stay in line there! Its beauties are modest in comparison to Rome, but it is my city, so...<eos> Impress me not with your love for your native city, but your love for my sister.<eos> I could not love her more, my lord.<eos> Will your more be enough?<eos> You are marrying Lucrezia Borgia.<eos> Your sole allegiance is to her now.<eos> And to Rome.
I have it covered.<eos> Father Michael!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You getting a henna tattoo?<eos> Do I look like a 13-year-old girl?<eos> David called me, said he wanted his fiancé to have the wedding of his dreams, and that my being here would mean so much to you, Bryan.<eos> It does.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Mm, no, it's half-assed.<eos> What?
I can't. But I am going to give you some time to get a DNA test.<eos> It's really easy, and after you get that test, hopefully in the next few weeks, then call me.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> If you don't, then I'm going to ask for the test through the courts.<eos> But I know you, Anne.<eos> You're a good woman and you're going to want to know the truth, too.<eos> I just... (SIGHS) I can't believe this.<eos> Hey, you and I were totally careless.<eos> If Robie is my son, he probably happened on our first date, same thing happened to your daughter and her boyfriend.<eos> Husband.
Beef chicken pork<eos> - Cocktail - Yeah - Margarita<eos> - Gosh Awards Can escape game And then return to the camp<eos> - Worth a fight?<eos> - Of course<eos> Well, we immediately began to draw positioning<eos> Well, we have been divided into two five-member team<eos> The purple team members have<eos> Reynold Erik Dawn Cochran and Phillip<eos> Orange team members

Yeah. Give it up,andrea.<eos> Once again,immunity is back up for grabs.<eos> For today's challenge,you'll push a buoy through a series of obstacles to a post holding a key.<eos> Once you have the key,you'll unlock a chest, containing ladder rungs and use them to complete a ladder puzzle.<eos> First person to complete their ladder and climb to the top and raise their flag and wins immunity,gawshted a one-in-six shot of winning this game.<eos> Losers,tribal council,where after 33 days out here,somebody will be voted out.<eos> We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.<eos> Here we go!<eos> For immunity!<eos> Survivors ready?
Oh, come on, it sounds like fun, right?<eos> Yeah, I don't think...<eos> This is happening.<eos> Bryan, why don't we just go in the other room and talk... are you gonna write my name, okay.<eos> It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.<eos> Which will it be,<eos> Thomas or Julie?<eos> Oh, I'm so excited!<eos> I can't wait to hear my grandson's name.<eos> Ready?
Pass it through the bars.<eos> No way.<eos> You're not walking off with my evidence.<eos> I've been gathering data for years.<eos> - Shan?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Please.<eos> They will kill me and they will destroy all of this.<eos> Shannon!<eos> You traitor!
- How are you, madame?<eos> - You can call me Silvie.<eos> - Patrick, this is Felix.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Véronique, Peter.<eos> - Felix.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Nice .
- What are you playing, Isabelle? - I am not playing.<eos> - You should be careful with your mum.<eos> She is fragile.<eos> You need to talk. She needs to understand.<eos> - It is hard for your mother, you know?<eos> - I have nothing to say , it is my life.<eos> - Make an effort, be nice!<eos> She is very shocked.<eos> - And you, are you shocked?<eos> - Yeah, me, too.
Are you all right, Daisy?<eos> I'll just get this off and pop in the pantry for my apron.<eos> Well, that's that, then.<eos> Do you know, when you brought up that basket... I were so proud of you, I felt like crying out.<eos> If you were my own daughter, I couldn't be prouder than I am now.<eos> You do know why I came today.<eos> To see the bazaar.<eos> To see you.<eos> I find - perhaps to my surprise - that since I left, I can't think of anything but you.<eos> To your surprise and my surprise.
You need to er, appeal to their better nature, Adam, the sense of community.<eos> You know, tell them the war may be over, but we're still all in it together.<eos> I don't think you should hark back to the war.<eos> You'll only remind them of Churchill.<eos> Sam's right.<eos> I should talk about the future.<eos> People don't want things to go back to the way they were,<eos> I know they don't. If people realise what a national health service means for them and their families, I don't think they'll be slamming doors on us.<eos> Excuse me, what are you doing?<eos> Sorry ma'am.
I think it's less than fair that somebody should put me in a photograph and use me for whatever purpose without my knowledge.<eos> I understand you had the best intentions, but if you'd been straight with me from the start, I might still be employed.<eos> So... the least you can do, sir, is allow me to do something about the situation.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> So... when do we start?<eos> .<eos> Secure the gate!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What is it?<eos> Unbelievable.
Mendoza, part of your job is to make sure these ovens are cleaned properly.<eos> Don't make me regret putting you in charge.<eos> I did clean those ovens.<eos> Well, clearly not well enough.<eos> Yeah. Clearly.<eos> All right, get back to work.<eos> Attention, ladies, breakfast has been temporarily delayed.<eos> Are you sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, it just scared me a little.<eos> Me, too.
At my age you, you've got to keep your blood sugar steady.<eos> I dip at around 10:00.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Oatmeal and cheese sandwich, no crusts.<eos> You should eat something.<eos> He's coming.<eos> I like the shape of your ears.<eos> What else do you like the shape of?<eos> You know what I miss?<eos> Mimosas.
Anyway, it don't matter.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay now.<eos> Who are you?<eos> So what?<eos> Leanne call you?<eos> She's worried about you.<eos> Said you haven't been yourself.<eos> Yeah. She's probably right.<eos> I'm still getting out from under the meds that they gave me.<eos> Why?
- No phone calls?<eos> - No need.<eos> They're dead.<eos> Answer it.<eos> Hello.<eos> VAZIRI [OVER PHONE]: My old friend.<eos> That operation must have cost you.<eos> You think I can't find you?<eos> I'm going to miss our sessions together.<eos> VAZIRl:
Name's Kip.<eos> He runs a high-end home electronics company.<eos> He left town two days ago on some boondoggle white-water rafting trip to Tahoe.<eos> Interesting.<eos> How did he take the news?<eos> Well, he hasn't gotten it yet.<eos> His office says the rafting group will be out of cell range for another day or so.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Describe to me the bedroom.<eos> Why?
Why, thank you.<eos> Other CBI agents, they have, uh, principles.<eos> I leaned into that one. Mm.<eos> Miguel Leyva.<eos> Sinaloa cartel.<eos> He controls drug corridors throughout the East Bay.<eos> Two months ago, a CBI task force was set for a bust.<eos> And when they raided his warehouse, three tons of cocaine disappeared without a trace.<eos> Someone in the CBI tipped him off?<eos> Him and others before him.
Did Saynay ever give you a sense that he felt wrongly accused or set up? Nah.<eos> He wasn't fighting any drama.<eos> Not that you'd know it if he was.<eos> My boy wasn't much of a talker.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Ah, you'd have to meet Saynay to fully appreciate his quiet nature.<eos> Did he ever mention a plastic container to you?<eos> What plastic container?<eos> I guess he didn't trust him enough.<eos> No, clearly.
Plus your gun's outta amo.<eos> Why should we follow you?<eos> Lieutenant Baum's training as a military officer would have included advanced survival tactics.<eos> As long as Captain Crowe incapacitated, he is the logical leader.<eos> Where is my banana split already?<eos> Here.<eos> Good to eat.<eos> Sweet.<eos> No!<eos> Capelblom.
Care to explain?<eos> Trying to learn how to win at a disadvantage.<eos> I assume we're talking about more than just chess.<eos> Rook and knight, valuable pieces.<eos> The Assistant District Attorney and Detective Szymanski.<eos> Their deaths benefited your enemy, Peter Yogorov.<eos> That's very good, Harold.<eos> And I'm in touch enough to know that a number of your associates inside have recently been transferred elsewhere.<eos> Who are you playing against?<eos> The Russians?

How did it get into his system?<eos> The report must have been dusted with whatever he used on Strauss.<eos> Luckily the transdermal absorption rate was lower than her ingestion of it, so it wasn't fatal for Rossi.<eos> Then this was a warning.<eos> If he wanted to kill Rossi, he had every chance to do it.<eos> If this is his endgame, why is he wasting time with warnings?<eos> He's toying with us and we're playing into him.<eos> He's turned Rossi against Morgan.<eos> Even if it was temporary, he wanted to show it could be done.<eos> But why?
We are not to be hunted.<eos> No.<eos> I've been around for over 1,000 years, Willa Burrell.<eos> And you are the second vampire I've ever made.<eos> Now, I did not make this decision lightly.<eos> - I have to send you back.<eos> - No. As your maker, I command you.<eos> Go home to your father.<eos> Come on, that building looks promising.<eos> - For what?
Brand-new sixer every week. ...Whether I need it or not.<eos> I'm waiting for one of those "not" weeks.<eos> What does she only give you a six-pack for?<eos> Ah, she doesn't want me to ruin my boyish figure...<eos> Or end up like one of those "alchies" out on the street.<eos> Hey, dad!<eos> Hey, Stevie!<eos> What are you up to?<eos> Oh, watching the game over here and trying to find a beer for Jim, but it looks like I got to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Oh, why?
Mom?<eos> Mom!<eos> You can't keep living like this.<eos> Like what?<eos> Mom, you know why Emily never wants to visit?<eos> Because her mother is a harping witch of a woman who keeps her from coming to visit.<eos> No!<eos> It's because she's afraid of all this stuff.<eos> She's afraid of you.<eos> Me?
Full head of fiery, red hair.<eos> Yeah, she wasn't afraid to stick up to her mother.<eos> The day she turned 18, she was out of here.<eos> As a matter of fact, that was just before you showed up.<eos> Yeah, eunice just didn't like the way Janice treated her.<eos> And, you know, her best friend drowning in the pool... Eh...<eos> Kind of ruin your day, I guess.<eos> All r this can go.<eos> No, it can't.<eos> Whwhy not?
He wasn't like me or Arroyo or you.<eos> You're not above dicey dealings to close a case, am I right?<eos> Not sure where you heard that from.<eos> Please. You're effective.<eos> Novak was, so am I and Arroyo, while Owen, however, is squeaky clean.<eos> And what's it got him?<eos> Zero, while the rest of us have made first grade, lieutenant, and like Jack Dowdell, commissioner.<eos> So who are you gonna trust?<eos> Me or that coward, Owen?<eos> Coward?
Next morning, bingo! There's a bridge.<eos> The devil says, "I've kept my promise, now you keep yours."<eos> The old lady took a loaf of bread out of her basket, threw it across the bridge and her dog ran after it.<eos> So the devil was tricked by an old lady. Yep.<eos> The devil was so embarrassed, he never set foot in Wales again.<eos> Some would say that he never left.<eos> Check out the back.<eos> Hello?<eos> 'Alfie! '<eos> 'Alfie! '
She was good.<eos> But we started to notice money was missing.<eos> How much?<eos> Only small sums.<eos> Ł10 here, Ł20 there.<eos> But it added up over the months.<eos> So, you sacked her?<eos> It wasn't just the money.<eos> She started handing these out to some of my patients.<eos> Young women mostly.
Good.<eos> Because I'd have had no trouble making sure that your children were fed and their clothes were clean and their homework was done.<eos> But I'd never dream of trying to be their mother.<eos> Or ever letting them forget her, for that matter.<eos> So... good luck.<eos> Wait.<eos> No guarantees but would you mind meeting my kids?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ready!
He stayed when he was here on business.<eos> Well, how serious is it with this guy?<eos> Four months pregnant serious.<eos> Why are you asking me this?<eos> We want to know why you're protecting this guy, April.<eos> Because I trust him.<eos> Which is more than I can say for you.<eos> Dominic wouldn't hurt Calvin-- they liked each other.<eos> Calvin helped Dominic's friend get a job at the airport.<eos> Dominic's friend?
Always on the run, hiding who you are, afraid you're gonna die.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna find us a way out of this.<eos> Really?<eos> Sam.<eos> Hey. Hey, sweet pea.<eos> Pender, Jacobs, Callahan.<eos> Tara?<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> They put me in a white room with racquetballs and they fucking shot me.<eos> Me, too.
I'll be there real soon, baby<eos> I love you, too<eos> Don't spit in the car, please<eos> Can you drive any faster, dumb ass?<eos> What if my baby goes to another customer?<eos> I said don't spit in the car<eos> What are you gonna do about it, dumb ass?<eos> That's one foul mouth you got there<eos> Why don't you just run to your 'baby'?<eos> Dumb ass!
Get you back to the people with the watching and the timing?<eos> Oh, I've been making great strides at the hospital, far beyond the observations I made here.<eos> And I want to continue the work, only move it...here.<eos> With the machines and all the wires?<eos> Ugh, for the love of God.<eos> I'll pay the women what a customer would, and I'll pay the men...<eos> Nothing.<eos> The only men here are Johns. Johns are our living.<eos> Johns are off limits.<eos> - Women only, then.
- Women only, then.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Strictly for masturbation.<eos> And I'll pay them...<eos> Double.<eos> ...double their usual rate.<eos> And I'll include a free medical exam.<eos> I can ask Wanda.<eos> She runs our house. She listens to me.<eos> But... only if you give me a job in your hospital.<eos> You?
Some people have children.<eos> I have seating charts and a uterus incompatible with conception.<eos> Retractor.<eos> I need more exposure.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> Dr. Masters.<eos> Dr. Masters!<eos> Close her up.<eos> Is she gonna be all right?<eos> Who?
Who?<eos> My Betty.<eos> I'm Gene, her fiancé.<eos> Oh, don't tell me it burst.<eos> Her appendix?<eos> And she made me promise not to come.<eos> She said I worry too much.<eos> I'm gonna give myself an ulcer.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Oh, thanks, God.
No, I mean move here to St. Louis.<eos> Look at you, sweetheart. You've gone pale.<eos> Of course I wouldn't move in with you and Bill.<eos> I'd get my own apartment.<eos> It could be close enough so that I could help out with the baby.<eos> Ethan?<eos> Who's Ethan?<eos> Ethan Haas, silly.<eos> You invited him?<eos> And Virginia?
"Nothing turned out the way we imagined."<eos> What do you have here, Winter?<eos> Keep controlling the guards, Bertok.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I just wanted to burn it to warm myself.<eos> We don't even have snowshirts.<eos> Every Russian can see us from a thousand meters away and shoot us like dogs.<eos> Dogerloh is organizing Bedsheets from the population.<eos> Why are you helping us?<eos> The enemy.

Pull yourself together!<eos> We need to win this battle.<eos> That is the last chance to bleed out the Russians before the Americans join in.<eos> And now leave.<eos> Herr Hauptmann.<eos> "How do you lead your men into a battle, that most of them won't survive?"<eos> "The real victors of this war are the flies."<eos> "We feed them with our flesh."<eos> Ten-hut!<eos> Ready!
Love it!<eos> Sold!<eos> Moving on!<eos> I have become a shell of my former self.<eos> A peanut shell. (chuckles)<eos> That'd be good if it was for someone else.<eos> CLEVELAND JR.: ♪ Up in the air, Junior Birdman ♪<eos> ♪ Haven't a care, Junior Birdman ♪<eos> ♪ A tree is his lair, Junior Birdman ♪<eos> Oh. Hey-ya, Rallo.
I hate you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Ah, come on.<eos> That was so cool when we outran Emperor Blog and he was like,<eos> "Puny humans, come back with my Blakelivelium!"<eos> Yeah, and when you destroyed his Bio-Organic Interceptor, he was like,<eos> (deep voice): "I will feast on your still-beating heart."<eos> Man, I got to work on my voices.<eos> You know, Junior, I'm actually gonna miss this when my hair grows back.<eos> Me, too.
Bye, dorks.<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> Please help me, Cleveland.<eos> And on the way, we can stop for a feel-better milkshake.<eos> Can we also go on a tugboat?<eos> Where else would we drink it?<eos> All right, you booger eaters, my punishment is being in charge of your punishment.<eos> And I won't tolerate any humping, bumping, krumping, or dumping.<eos> What?<eos> Thanks a lot, Rallo.
You're five, you'll grow more.<eos> Mama!<eos> What?<eos> It was me.<eos> I stole the candy bar.<eos> Junior had nothing to do with it, I swear.<eos> Please, let him go.<eos> - Rober?<eos> - Fine by me.<eos> Thanks, Rallo.
A couple of drinks, all was swell.<eos> Then these two gents bought 'em a third round.<eos> Halfway through their mugs, the McGraths nearly dropped to the floor and those two fellas had to help the boys home.<eos> Disturbing my staff, Corky?<eos> I got two brothers, one dead, one missing.<eos> Growing more likely this was their last stop before fate stepped in.<eos> More than one man's spent his last night here.<eos> Hardly men.<eos> John and Michael McGrath?<eos> The McGraths.
Well, sir<eos> - I did not think so.<eos> He's in charge.<eos> She pulls the strings.<eos> Hard as nails.<eos> The bitch.<eos> I have to say that I am very unhappy with this situation, Miss Pierce.<eos> I dislike having to lie.<eos> To them?<eos> To anyone.
I couldn't have taken them prisoner even if I'd wanted to.<eos> It was not possible.<eos> I make no apology, Mr Foyle.<eos> You can go to hell as far as I'm concerned.<eos> Your people need me now.<eos> Your role was to help me and this is exactly what we did.<eos> We will not meet again.<eos> I believe you're absolutely right.<eos> You told them?<eos> The Americans?
Intelligence have put out an APW, so the airports, railways and ferry ports are aware.<eos> Her photo's also gone out on the police briefing.<eos> We have officers with Jamie Levinson at the hospital and with Sister Claire, who we think could also be a potential target.<eos> Ruthie Culvert is now our prime suspect but she is also young and vulnerable.<eos> Now, come on. We want her found.<eos> What have we got?<eos> A team's talking to her friends.<eos> We've got trained officers with her brothers.<eos> I wanna visit her mam.<eos> -Why now? -Ma'am?

We'll keep this guy busy.<eos> - What about Snotlout?<eos> - Ooh! Not feeling the trust!<eos> Ruff!<eos> Tuff!<eos> - On it.<eos> - On it. You're giving me the twins?<eos> Okay! I'll take the twins!<eos> Unh!<eos> Carefull, bud.
The councilman is rich and entitled.<eos> People like him all have the same weakness:<eos> thinking they're smarter than everyone else.<eos> Let him underestimate me.<eos> That's what got me where I am today.<eos> Deb McKenzie.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> Give me a call when you're in the city.<eos> Okay, bye.
How do you reckon we get that kind of money?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I can find work.<eos> - Well, raising kids isn't cheap, either.<eos> There's doctor bills and clothes.<eos> Spend a lot of money on clothes for girls, and...<eos> Day-laboring ain't gonna be enough for all that.<eos> If I can get someone to front me some money, I could open my own service station.<eos> I can just see all the bankers right now falling all over themselves to see who can give the convict the biggest bundle.<eos> Ex-con.
-Come, I'll show you.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Yes, right there.<eos> Original.<eos> Yours.<eos> First, you can feel by touch.<eos> Then you can feel the difference in weight.<eos> And last, the original label that unfortunately out of your way.<eos> Of course!<eos> -I'm sorry.
I can not ...<eos> That's your problem?<eos> That's your only problem?<eos> Yes, but ...<eos> Oh please!<eos> How am only things I forgot!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Bye. -Hi.<eos> Something happened to me ...<eos> And me.
All right.<eos> All right, somebody's got to say it, so I'll say it...<eos> You want to know why Neville and Miles betrayed you?<eos> Because you made them.<eos> - I made them?<eos> - That's right, you did.<eos> They were loyal to you.<eos> Miles was loyal to you at first, but you were so paranoid and brutal and unhinged that you pushed them away.<eos> Officers dropping around me like flies, and I stuck around.<eos> Why?
I'm so sorry.<eos> - I'm so...<eos> - No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> You... you have no reason to apologize, okay?<eos> I I...<eos> I told him.<eos> Who?
I've never used that word before in my life.<eos> I don't know where that came from.<eos> That guy just looks at you, and you just want to give him everything you have and then form an elite group of criminals and try to get him some more!<eos> You go and take that back!<eos> I can't hurt him.<eos> We shared a moment.<eos> ♪ the pipes, the pipes are calling ♪ I never thought of myself as being a singer, but he made me great.<eos> This is so not fair.<eos> I totally fixed your Carrie situation.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
It's meaty, but it's also moussey.<eos> It's a meat mousse.<eos> I think I'll leave it.<eos> I'll wait for the buffet.<eos> Are you good to go? Have you conquered Briton?<eos> I'm telling her in stages.<eos> Today I invited her to a party.<eos> Tomorrow I'll fill her in on the theme.<eos> Oh, yeah, no need, actually.<eos> Why?
Like a human shield.<eos> And how are you gonna do that?<eos> Slide in...<eos> No, I mean you need a female guest.<eos> Oh, fuck pigs!<eos> OK, I've got an idea.<eos> And I'll be honest, Grumio, you won't like it.<eos> However, bear in mind, there will be a free buffet in it for you.<eos> Don't think so.<eos> Why not?
How long's that gonna take?<eos> Oh, 10, 15 minutes should be fine.<eos> OK. Fire away.<eos> I hereby call the first meeting of the office Incest Society.<eos> Oh, fantastic.<eos> Count me in. Really?<eos> Of course. I've been hooked since I was a wee lad.<eos> I used to collect butterflies.<eos> I once owned a purple emperor, if you can believe that.<eos> Oh, no. Sorry.
The Lord gave them descendants as countless as the sand on the seashore.<eos> Hebrews 11.<eos> But still, we are starting to worry that children may not be in God's plan.<eos> God may have created the heavens and earth, but...he's not an obstetrician.<eos> And when you say you're "trying," uh, what exactly is your regimen?<eos> Just like the Bible says.<eos> We lie together every night.<eos> The missionary position, I presume?<eos> What positions have you tried?<eos> Positions?
What wonderful news.<eos> Are you signing up?<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> Virginia hasn't asked me yet, but heck yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> I haven't been this excited in, well...you know.<eos> You were there.<eos> I've really missed being a pioneer on the front lines of science.<eos> Right.<eos> Me too.
You all right, mate?<eos> Quiet tonight.<eos> Few problems.<eos> Mate of mine, Billy Still... got pulled by the law yesterday.<eos> Trying to take my mind off it.<eos> Yeah, good seeing you again, Biggsy.<eos> You too, Brucey.<eos> I hate to ask but... you don't have anything on, do you?<eos> Only I could do with 500 just to see me right.<eos> No, mate, sorry.
Thongsook!<eos> Come back to me!<eos> Nam<eos> I've got you some snacks, a belated birthday gift<eos> Take it<eos> Aren't you angry with me?<eos> About what?<eos> No, because we're friends, right?<eos> I'll have to go to class<eos> Nam!

Where?<eos> I swear Thongsook was right there!<eos> I'll try to find Thongsook at the shrine again<eos> The boatman just told us not to go near it<eos> Right, don't worry about him<eos> He came by himself, he'll be able to find his way back<eos> Maybe he's already back in Bangkok by now!<eos> I'll go by myself if you guys don't want to<eos> Wait Nam!<eos> Nam!
Jack!<eos> We have to run!<eos> Nam!<eos> We have to run!<eos> This way!<eos> Speed up!<eos> - We're here!<eos> - Beam, wait!<eos> - Wait!<eos> - Nam!
Thongsook!<eos> Tell me how did you get out?<eos> Devouring Ghost, Devouring Ghost<eos> Pui, what's wrong?<eos> Is it your migraine?<eos> Let's go lie down<eos> Nam, I'll call the boatman again<eos> Amulet, amulet, where's my amulet?<eos> The amulet!<eos> Nam

Don't go, Jack!<eos> Leave me!<eos> Come back here!<eos> - Jack!<eos> - I'm out of here!<eos> I'm a ghost... but you're a fool!<eos> Get out of my face!<eos> Yes!<eos> I've made it!<eos> Nam!
No!<eos> We'll have to find Thongsook<eos> Is that you?<eos> Thongsook!<eos> Thongsook!<eos> - Thongsook!<eos> - Nam!<eos> Run, now!<eos> - Thongsook!<eos> - Nam!

This is none of your business.<eos> Well, if you let Alejandro think I did this, then it will be my business.<eos> Odessa, your hand is bleeding.<eos> Oh! Look at that.<eos> Where do you keep the first aid kit?<eos> In my medicine cabinet.<eos> I'm gonna go get you a band-aid.<eos> No!<eos> I don't want you in my room.<eos> Why?
I'll take care of this.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I got rehearsal in the morning.<eos> Come on, Odessa.<eos> And you, be more careful.<eos> You're starting to piss me off.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Shh.<eos> Come on, Marisol. Give me a break.<eos> Rosie?
I know. I actually thought I was gonna win big and get that plastic surgery I always wanted.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's so cute.<eos> I'm small, so this is okay.<eos> You know what, screw it.<eos> I say we just cut our losses and fly home.<eos> Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Usually people just find me awkward.<eos> I have a hard time with small talk.<eos> Did you find everything you were looking for?<eos> Eh, I did all right for a guy who just had his first homosexual experience with his guitar teacher.<eos> All right, guys, keean eye out for our stuff.<eos> I got tired of not being able to find my bags, so I tied a vaguely Hanna-Barbera-looking character to it.<eos> This triwas imposserous!<eos> There we go.<eos> I really enjoyed sitting next to you on the plane, Chris.<eos> Me, too.
Hey, listen, Mr. Barrington, y-your granddaughter ain't no tease, right?<eos> 'Cause Chris really wants to get in there.<eos> Oh, you're a funny guy, Griffin.<eos> I like that.<eos> Oh, well, you should hear my prank phone calls.<eos> Hey, is your refrigerator running?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Are your doors unlocked?<eos> What?<eos> Why?
I've seen people like you before.<eos> And you make me sick.<eos> You sell snake oil to the weak.<eos> So you think Justin Wade was so good?<eos> He was poisoning her.<eos> I wasn't gonna watch her die.<eos> Modern medicine?<eos> That's the real snake oil here.<eos> They spend millions conning people into buying chemicals and pills, so they can make billions.<eos> The weak?
David, everything is okay?<eos> Are you still upset because I didn't tell you about my past?<eos> No, no, it has nothing to do with that.<eos> I don't care that you were married for a week.<eos> Because... I want to marry you. For...forever.<eos> Then why are you running from me?<eos> 'Cause I'm an idiot.<eos> And I'm afraid.<eos> Of what?<eos> Me?
All right, don't mess it up, kid.<eos> I'm counting on you. Got it.<eos> But at the end of the day, this case goes to trial in Manhattan.<eos> I got to run.<eos> My counterpart in Brooklyn. He's trying to jump our serial arson case.<eos> I'll burn his house down first.<eos> How's the new gig?<eos> So far, so good.<eos> We're prosecuting a sex offender,<eos> Wayne Devereaux.
Flora never met any of my friends.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I never introduced Flora to anyone.<eos> We didn't even go out that much.<eos> The only party we were at together was the...<eos> Eddie, what is it?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> I think we're past the point Where you're allowed to be embarrassed.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> Not you.
Let's just not make it an annual thing, huh?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I hate to say it, but, uh,<eos> Gabe is here, so you should probably go.<eos> What is that?<eos> Someone's buried down there.<eos> It's a calla lily.<eos> It's her.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me, too.
Uh, just one, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪ I heard your heart say, "Love, love, love." ♪ I'm sorry this couldn't last longer.<eos> We both knew that taking one little pill to suppress your grittier side was too good to be true.<eos> Yeah, one little pill that has one nasty, fatal side effect if I keep taking them.<eos> I know you can't and I would never want you to be hurt, but...<eos> But it's nice to dream for a few hours.<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> Kafka would be impressed.<eos> Why?
I thought I might allow you to walk with me this Sunday afternoon.<eos> At Hampstead, perhaps.<eos> We could take a blanket and some cold wine.<eos> Miss Cobden...<eos> When will you call me Jane, Inspector?<eos> Miss Cobden, I...<eos> I do not know what you think it is has passed between us.<eos> I am married.<eos> Mr Reid.<eos> Edmund.
She's in hospital.<eos> Is she alright?<eos> She had a bit of a stroke.<eos> A stroke.<eos> I'm going to head lads.<eos> See yis later.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Seeya Aido.<eos> I don't trust any of those fucks.<eos> Not one of them.
Only that one of them that's been going in and out has a couple of teeth missing.<eos> Do you want another cup of tea, Annemarie?<eos> No thank you.<eos> This one.<eos> This one?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did he come in on his own or with the other one? He came in on his own.<eos> And you noticed him at the time?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
I can't hear a word they're saying.<eos> No, it's all good.<eos> They're under the recorder.<eos> Did you make a deal with them, you stupid donkey?<eos> I didn't say a word.<eos> Why on earth did I trust you?<eos> ...supposed to ask who told you to bring a gun to scare Angie McGuire, and where the hell did you find it?<eos> Behind a loose board in the apartment weeks ago.<eos> I didn't know there was a body on it. A cop!<eos> Wow!
Let's go!<eos> Hands up.<eos> Let's go.<eos> The heck you do that for?<eos> Thought I saw something.<eos> Don't think the workday's over.<eos> Shouldn't you be out on the trail, trying to put a bullet in someone's head?<eos> You know how most outlaws get caught, miss Lane?<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> Tips.
You want me to read to you for a sec?<eos> No.<eos> Mommy said if anything ever happened to her, I should find a good person.<eos> Like you.<eos> And give this to them.<eos> Grace, I want to be a part of your life.<eos> No, Dad, you'll never be a part of my life.<eos> Or Molly's.<eos> You know what you did.<eos> To me, and to Steven.
O.C.C.B. said they had this Zelichenok under surveillance on a RICO case.<eos> So I called, they sent me his address.<eos> Look at you, you're already dreaming of headlines.<eos> You barely heard the guy's name before you cleared out of there.<eos> No, I just know Zelichenok had a public beef with a councilman.<eos> And you think Arroyo might beat us to him.<eos> Well, let's just work it right.<eos> Zelichenok.<eos> They beat us to him.<eos> Unbelievable.
You can't do this.<eos> You can't tell me that I set my dad up to die.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Set him up how?<eos> I still owe.<eos> I told my dad, and he said he'd take care of it.<eos> If he died trying to save me, I'll never forgive myself.<eos> So you still owe a bookie, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Name.
Follow the account number."<eos> You wanted him exposed.<eos> I wanted to be free.<eos> I thought, if his political career was over, I'd finally be out from underneath him.<eos> How'd it work?<eos> He'd place bets through me, buy drugs through me.<eos> And the women?<eos> I facilitated his infidelities.<eos> Against my own mother.<eos> Why?
I'm CSI Russell.<eos> Care to tell us who you are?<eos> A lot of people are living off the grid nowadays, but y-you've taken it to a whole new level.<eos> You-you have no identification.<eos> So far, we've found nothing in your little bunker.<eos> No bank statement, no utility bills, nothing with your name on it.<eos> It's almost like you worked very hard to disappear, haven't you?<eos> Is that a crime?<eos> Well, I'm just wondering why.<eos> Why?
Not that I'd compare myself to Welles, but...<eos> - No?<eos> - Stylistically, I'm closer to Hitchcock.<eos> Does Ulysses still have a vibrating function?<eos> I had to disable it.<eos> Why would a camera have a vibrating function?<eos> That would ruin the focus.<eos> The vibrating sensation helps some women achieve orgasm.<eos> Lester Linden, our documentarian, this is patient F-26-002.<eos> - Pleasure. - Ma'am.
I don't have my glasses.<eos> Just give me this.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, hey. Whoa.<eos> Whoa. Sorry.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> We're trying to take this picture.<eos> - All right, sorry.<eos> - Looks great. Hey, guys. - [Giggles]<eos> - Yeah. Ready?
Just out of the blue.<eos> No reason. Our relationship's so confusing. But this is Nick we're talking about.<eos> He's never gonna tell me how he feels.<eos> It's always gonna be weird.<eos> And I have to stop expecting for it to... change.<eos> What? You realize your hand is still on your boob, right?<eos> I can't explain it, it's... it's, like, really calming me down.<eos> I mean, the sexual tension has been off the charts.<eos> It's like the wild west.<eos> No laws.
Be my husband, and I will be your wife.<eos> I wanted to ask you so many times.<eos> I even bought a ring.<eos> Wait.<eos> May I?<eos> The oddest thing happened to me today.<eos> Really, sir?<eos> Just one?<eos> I performed an act which brought great joy to someone other than myself.<eos> Whom?
It's a rhetorical question. You don't have to answer that.<eos> You have to stop the concert.<eos> What? No. No.<eos> Practically half of Los Angeles turned out to help the rescue workers.<eos> And we have raised a fortune. By tomorrow, my image problem will be fixed.<eos> Everyone loves me!<eos> Yeah, well, Dixon called, and there's been a gas leak at the theater, and the equipment needs to come through this Plaza.<eos> Your rescue effort is impeding the actual rescue.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sorry, guys.
We're going to get you out of there - as soon as we can.<eos> - Oh... - Yeah, that's a really good sign!<eos> We're... we're over here!<eos> Hey. The rescue workers got through, and they stopped the gas leak.<eos> Ade and Navid are going to be fine.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry for being so scoldy earlier.<eos> I know you just wanted to help.<eos> I called USA National, and I gave them the exclusive interview about my wild night with Prince Harry.<eos> What?
I'm sure I'll be very happy there.<eos> Annie... we have the rest of our lives ahead of us.<eos> Hey, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that it's never over.<eos> Of course you feel that way, Naomi.<eos> You're Naomi.<eos> You know, I might em like I'm perfect and I've got it all figured out, but the truth is, I'm... um, I'm winging it.<eos> Think about everything.<eos> Losing my money. Getting it back. Fighting with my sister.<eos> Well, how do you think I got through all of that?<eos> You guys.
Now!<eos> I told you, get back to your room.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I could have gotten us out.<eos> Why?<eos> Daddy's princess has to ask why?<eos> Why I wanted to hurt someone who kept saying that they were gonna help me, but waited and did nothing for years.<eos> You knew what was happening downstairs, but you let me suffer.<eos> And why?
You've done this before?<eos> Many times.<eos> Since you've been bringing him here, has, uh, Evelyn... grown attached to the boy?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Listen to me, do us both a favor.<eos> Take that child out of this house and never bring him back here.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Not really.<eos> But I'll go get him.<eos> And, Rosie?
- I told you.<eos> You just had a heart attack.<eos> Please.<eos> My heart stops every time I see you.<eos> We can have sex, but just to be safe...<eos> Let me do all the work.<eos> Just to be safe.<eos> Boy, I wish you'd fixed that doorbell.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Evelyn.<eos> Rosie.
One, three, seven, two, five, nine.<eos> Sudoku is easy.<eos> Is there even rules to this game?<eos> There's a natural successor to Jerry's sad, smelly crown.<eos> And it's not me.<eos> It's Andy.<eos> Big guy?<eos> Check.<eos> Goofy?<eos> Check.
You're in politics.<eos> What did you expect?<eos> Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you.<eos> People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully.<eos> And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win.<eos> There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms along the path you're walking.<eos> I suppose you just need to figure out whether it's a path you truly wanna walk.<eos> I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt<eos> - when it reopens.<eos> - Sorry, no.
Thursday night.<eos> Freck hasn't been to work in a couple days.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> Anyone want a beer?<eos> Yeah. I... I'll take a beer.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Wait. - Yeah.<eos> - Hold on. I'm not... I'm gonna stay here.<eos> You don't touch that.<eos> Why not?
You should be out having fun.<eos> Go to a strip club or something.<eos> I don't like doing anything without Molly.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Well, you certainly have to be more gentlemanly during the lap dances.<eos> And I don't know about your wife, but Joyce has a strict "no motor-boating" rule.<eos> I am gonna eat one of the prepared dinners she left me, go to bed at 8:30, and smell her pillow till I fall asleep.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> - You're a disgrace to husband's everywhere.<eos> - Why?
Perhaps around 10,000 - 20,000?<eos> It could be more if the trial drags on if you can't afford one, France has an excellent public defense system.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Was that her husband?<eos> He must be pretty agitated with the wife locked up in prison.<eos> Why did he make her do such a thing?<eos> What a loser!<eos> If we present a petition and the ambassador gets involved, we may be able to get her indictment without detention.<eos> Shouldn't we report this to the ambassador?<eos> To the ambassador?
And I can't stand to hear Elena in pain.<eos> - What do you want to talk about?<eos> - I don't know. Anything.<eos> - I ordered you a cap and gown.<eos> - You did? I just figured that you'd forget, so I ordered yours when I ordered mine.<eos> And I got one for Elena, too.<eos> It's gonna work.<eos> We're gonna get Elena back.<eos> What the hell is she doing here?<eos> Hi.
They wouldn't be freaking out if they were fine.<eos> Right, 'cause mom and dad never freak out over nothing. They don't.<eos> They're perfect.<eos> Remember the time when dad was switching jobs, and mom threw away all of our junk food?<eos> That was completely different.<eos> No, no, actually, it's not.<eos> They don't know how to deal with their stuff, so they obsess over us.<eos> Maybe that's all this is, right?<eos> I can't believe how relieved I am.<eos> Me, too.
We'll get your stuff back.<eos> We got a hit on that fingerprint.<eos> You recognize that name?<eos> Yeah. I sure do.<eos> I was thinking desert tones with a pop of cactus green.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you're a little too far East for a Southwest decor.<eos> - Especially in a historic building.<eos> - Jane, I-I can explain.<eos> To a judge.
Robyn.<eos> - Why not Kalinda?<eos> - Money.<eos> Are you okay with that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just kind of weird.<eos> Everything's ending.<eos> Beginning to.<eos> So... How are we gonna tell them?<eos> - Who?
- What?<eos> - Remember Nicki Rutkowski?<eos> - What about her?<eos> - Her name came up.<eos> - Did it end bad?<eos> - No!<eos> We slept together a couple times, and she went on her merry way.<eos> Ask her.<eos> Oh, they're going to.<eos> Unreal.
Ask her when she gets here.<eos> Ask Otis to ask her.<eos> She doesn't speak English.<eos> - Oh... - It's serviceable.<eos> [Laughs] You gotta go White Sox.<eos> No, I don't wanna alienate half the neighborhood who are Cubs fans.<eos> We gotta go with teams that we can all agree on:<eos> The Bears, the Bulls, and the Blackhawks.<eos> And the Fire?<eos> - The who?
I'll talk to you later. Bye.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi, babe.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Ohh.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Better, now that you're home.<eos> I'm glad it's your week and not dad's.<eos> Why?
You play that song for Scarlett?<eos> Nope.<eos> You ain't gonna tell her it's Jason's?<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> That's cool.<eos> It's just... it's between the two of you.<eos> I just thought maybe you're making more trouble for yourself by not saying anything.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't need life advice about my girlfriend, okay?<eos> Hey, guys.
Rayna, over here!<eos> Juliette, over here! Mm. ♪ it must have hit me ♪<eos> You know, I've... I've heard you sing this song in your room.<eos> Is this of your favorites?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Can we please go home now?<eos> ♪ Down, down ♪<eos> Maddie... let me tell you something.<eos> You mean everything to me.<eos> Everything.
I'm not some miserable, lonely person.<eos> Tell him, Lily.<eos> It's a tough weekend for him.<eos> Bro.<eos> We're here for a wedding.<eos> Ouch.<eos> And he used to date the bride.<eos> Ooh, mama.<eos> And he's the best man.<eos> Devastating.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll give me a moment.<eos> Ms. Hasan.<eos> You saved me.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> Ms. Hasan, the work that you're doing, it's-- it's absolutely incredible.<eos> Alexandra-- may I call you Alexandra?<eos> Of course.<eos> I've been trying to get in touch with you for quite some time.<eos> Me?<eos> Why?
Hell, no.<eos> I wouldn't let Jenny near that guy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, but...<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Okay? I just--<eos> I can't believe that the department is forcing her to hang out with some womanizing rich guy against her will.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unbelievable.
That should help with the swelling.<eos> Yes, but, uh, not my pride.<eos> You know, with your bedside manner, you could've been a doctor.<eos> Me?<eos> No, no.<eos> A lawyer, maybe.<eos> I was, uh, in pre-law.<eos> I could've represented you in your case against the cork.<eos> But instead, you became a cop.<eos> Why?
- Hot!<eos> Hot!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Hot!<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You're okay?<eos> - Why did you go to the mall?<eos> - I wanted to buy someone a gift.<eos> Who?
Hot!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Hot!<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You're okay?<eos> - Why did you go to the mall?<eos> - I wanted to buy someone a gift.<eos> Who?<eos> - Just someone.
- Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Hot!<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You're okay?<eos> - Why did you go to the mall?<eos> - I wanted to buy someone a gift.<eos> Who?<eos> - Just someone.<eos> - Me?
Nowadays that doesn't matter.<eos> Some even consider it a badge of honor.<eos> What about you?<eos> What I'm trying to say is, dear brother, it's time to come home.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Keys are in it.<eos> Looks pretty clean inside.<eos> What, so he brings the car here, dumps it, and walks away?<eos> Maybe he had somebody pick him up.<eos> - But why here?
Like a goddess.<eos> Look at all these photos on the wall.<eos> You take a picture of the goddess?<eos> Yeah, I wanted to; piece came out real tight. But dude was all cagey about it.<eos> Wouldn't let me.<eos> What about the stencil paper you use as a template in the beginning?<eos> You, uh... you got that?<eos> No, I already gave that to the other cop.<eos> Wait.<eos> What other cop?
She was that night.<eos> I'll bet.<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> This concludes the proceedings.<eos> Uh... about my testimony back there, I wasn't trying to...<eos> It's all right.<eos> I know how these things work.<eos> Well, I wish I could've just said what I think, which is that you did the right thing.<eos> I know, I know. I'm sorry you're going through all this.<eos> Me, too.
Do they burn witches in these parts?<eos> I am no witch, my lady.<eos> I tend the forest, I gather its fruits.<eos> And sell them to whomever has need of them for good or for ill.<eos> - But the truth might yet save you.<eos> -The truth?<eos> You gave the Galerina mushroom.<eos> I gave no Galerina.<eos> I gave a dried powder mixed with juniper.<eos> To whom?

- No.<eos> No.<eos> To a side account in the Vatican treasury.<eos> Called...?<eos> The Constantinople Endeavor.<eos> The Constantinople Endeavor?<eos> Our crusade against the infidel, the Turk.<eos> The account books for this fund, are for your eyes only.<eos> The entire Turkish navy could be burnt to a cinder, with oil.<eos> Oil?
Why does he want it?<eos> The thought of war disturbs him.<eos> - A man of peace.<eos> -You could say that.<eos> - Well, I would meet with this paragon. -And he is a paragon.<eos> It could easily be arranged.<eos> He is your father, Pope of Rome.<eos> - And he would deny me powder?<eos> -Yes.<eos> - Why?
Where were we?<eos> Chapter 19.<eos> I can't talk right now.<eos> I got a lot on my plate.<eos> Well, let's dig in.<eos> If we start now, we can be done by lunch.<eos> Now's not a good time, Lil.<eos> We got a lot of balls in the air right now.<eos> Okay, toss me the stapler.<eos> Unbelievable.
Further is more of a verb. To further your education, to further a cause.<eos> Whereas farther indicates distance.<eos> Why did I ask?<eos> - I'll see you at lunch.<eos> - Wait!<eos> My grandmother was hoping you could kind of hang out with me at the house until she gets home tonight.<eos> Her friend is having surgery and she's going to stay at the hospital with her as long as possible.<eos> And she wants me to stay there with you with no one else at home, the entire house to ourselves, including your bedroom?<eos> She totally trusts us.<eos> Why?
Doesn't mean it was an easy decision. I'm okay!<eos> Can we stop talking about it?<eos> Stop talking about it?<eos> This is huge, your boyfriend showing up here.<eos> Did you know he was coming? No, I didn't.<eos> I knew he called them, I just didn't know he was going to show up here.<eos> Is this why you were in the counselor's office?<eos> Yes. Sonya was trying to reach me.<eos> I just didn't want to tell you.<eos> - Why not?
(Man) One end of the bow tie - should be longer than the other.<eos> - Hey, Nash. What's going on?<eos> Sam?<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> Last-minute emergency. Go figure.<eos> Let's hope there's not two of them.<eos> - Is Noelle with you guys?<eos> - No.<eos> Why? Have you seen Noelle today?<eos> - No.
Oh.<eos> Aren't you allowed to bring your friends back?<eos> It's not a question of being allowed.<eos> Then what is it a question of?<eos> I wish Tom had arrived.<eos> It's so nice to hear you say that.<eos> No, I mean, he's bringing Isis and I do miss her.<eos> Do you know Lady Grantham's mother, Mrs Levinson, and her son?<eos> This is Lord Aysgarth.<eos> A pleasure.
- Of course.<eos> So, did you get the raise?<eos> - He says he'll look into it.<eos> - Sorry, mate.<eos> At this rate, by the time I'll be able to afford a wife, Mina and I will be in advanced old age.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> Well, not both of you, at least.<eos> You do have a few years on the girl.<eos> Mr. Renfield, this is my co-chairman on the board of British Imperial Coolant Company, Lord Laurent.<eos> - Pleasure.
While you can still talk.<eos> Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. Ow.<eos> Let me help you get it off.<eos> Judge Dent was kidnapped last night. Where did the Joker take him?<eos> Even if I did know, it wouldn't do you any good, Bats.<eos> - He's probably already dead.<eos> - Then so are you.<eos> Cyborg?<eos> I surrender.<eos> To you.
That's where you come in.<eos> If we want to win this thing, we need the best tactician on the planet.<eos> You.<eos> You can't just turn your back on this.<eos> Not when we've got a chance to stop this war and save the world.<eos> War's over, soldier.<eos> You just don't know it yet.<eos> Everybody lost.<eos> - Can I help you, sir?<eos> - Sir?
Going to be the G.M. for Boston.<eos> Been courting me for a while.<eos> Boston's Noelle's hometown, so it all seemed to make sense, you know?<eos> Congratulations. That's -- wow.<eos> That is a -- that's a big change.<eos> Guess we're both moving on.<eos> Sorry, Dani... for everything.<eos> There's no apologies required.<eos> I wish you so much luck.<eos> You too.
Now!<eos> Shouldn't we get your moms?<eos> Why?<eos> It's not like any of their phony L.A. friends are gonna make the trip.<eos> Yeah, but you never made it to where you were headed.<eos> Somebody out there's probably worried.<eos> Who cares?<eos> I'm just excited to meet your folks.<eos> I can't wait to tell them you're shacking up with an underage girl and two lesbians.<eos> Barbie?
Ollie Densmore is dead.<eos> He was gonna kill my father, so I killed him.<eos> I thought you joined his team.<eos> Mmm, it was kind of a Trojan horse thing.<eos> I went into his camp, and... destroyed him from the inside.<eos> Why don't you go home, Junior?<eos> 'Cause I don't have a home.<eos> How was your day, honey?<eos> I've had better.<eos> How about you?
Focus.<eos> Listen, I got a job for you.<eos> Barbie shot Julia Shumway yesterday.<eos> That son of a bitch.<eos> So I sent some people over to the clinic, keep an eye out, make sure he doesn't... show up to finish what he started.<eos> But I need somebody I can trust on the inside, guarding her door, protecting her.<eos> Can I count on you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, it's, uh, iffy she's ever gonna regain consciousness, but, by chance, if she does wake up and start talking, you need to get on that walkie and let me know.<eos> No one else.

No one else.<eos> Just me.<eos> Okay. But, Dad... just be careful today.<eos> Big Jim, got a minute?<eos> Pretty busy this morning, Dodee.<eos> No, you have to come to the radio station.<eos> Ah, I don't want to overwhelm the public with more announcements.<eos> My receiver picked up the military.<eos> They're searching for Barbie.<eos> Barbie?
Why?<eos> That mean something to you?<eos> Not for a long time.<eos> Meet me at my house, Linda.<eos> So, if Julia's in charge now, then... what are we supposed to do next?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She's not the monarch. There's no such thing.<eos> We have to take that egg to the real authorities.<eos> Like Big Jim?
Help him, please.<eos> Drink.<eos> Drink!<eos> Please, Bill.<eos> Come on.<eos> Detail, atten-huh.<eos> Right face.<eos> Forward march.<eos> Detail, halt.<eos> Ready, face.
No.<eos> Yo.<eos> You want to make some music?<eos> You want to order some sushi?<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Hit that.<eos> That's gonna make you feel better.<eos> You know what?<eos> We're gonna throw you a party tomorrow.<eos> Why?
I don't want to lose this house.<eos> Aw, come on.<eos> We'll get through it. Hey...<eos> Would I lie to my best girl?<eos> Oh, Sweetpea, you can always make me smile.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Mathias.<eos> Something will happen.<eos> It always does.<eos> Don't you think it's time to trade up?<eos> Why?
This is my partner, Flynn.<eos> But what...?<eos> And you are?<eos> Gretchen Stiles.<eos> I live here.<eos> With Julia Conrad?<eos> My roommate.<eos> Something's happened to Julia?<eos> Ms. Stiles, I'm afraid we have some bad news.<eos> Hey, Katie. Hey!
What context?<eos> Did his balls pull a knife on her?<eos> No, they complained that I parked in their driveway.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Obviously not.<eos> You don't have any balls.<eos> Okay, all right, well, that's our apology, so we're gonna go.<eos> Good, at least this time you're taking your trash with you.<eos> You douche nozzle!<eos> - Douche nozzle?
She is Ilona.<eos> My wife died four centuries ago.<eos> I know.<eos> I was there.<eos> Then she has been born again, and the fates have returned her to you.<eos> Now, you listen to me, Josef.<eos> You must never again mention Mina Murray's resemblance to my wife.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Never.<eos> To anyone.
I just like the smell.<eos> Cota: See, right there.<eos> I think they're using a wire to pull his lips up.<eos> Why can't people love each other, Wilbur?<eos> Pretty sure this ain't real.<eos> Nah, I taught my mare a few words.<eos> "Hello." "Howdy."<eos> "Pretty bird."<eos> You got a horse that says "pretty bird"?<eos> Unbelievable.
That's a long time to go without getting promoted.<eos> That tells me you have something in your file that's holding you back.<eos> So, that's bullied as a kid, divorced, career tapped out.<eos> You stop me when I get something wrong.<eos> I think someone set up Carter because of one of your cases.<eos> And I need you to help me figure out which one.<eos> That's it.<eos> Joe, I told you I didn't want any part of this.<eos> She's a stupid P.I. Relax.<eos> Why?
♪ What do you do with a drunken sailor? ♪<eos> (laughing): * What do you do with a drunken sailor *<eos> ♪ Early in the morning? ♪<eos> Are you wasted?<eos> Blotto!<eos> That's the only way I can handle your mom.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Ask me why.<eos> Ask me.<eos> - Why?
Listen, if it weren't for him, they would never have been able to frame my father or force Padma into delivering that program.<eos> It doesn't matter who killed her, Nolan. The Falcon is the reason that she's dead.<eos> Look, believe me, I want to make him pay.<eos> But he's been underground for two decades.<eos> No one knows what he looks like,<eos> - let alone how to contact him.<eos> - Victoria does. She gave Conrad documents this morning that prove she terminated her first pregnancy, but we both know that's a lie, which means that she's got someone covering her tracks, someone tech-savvy enough to alter hospital records in a matter of hours.<eos> Uh, what hospital?<eos> I tracked down the nun who helped Victoria. She sent me to St. Michael's, but, of course, there's no record of her ever giving birth there.<eos> I...
Do you have a girl that matches this description?<eos> Well, we have lots of bodies, we have I... lots of parts and... bones and, uh, skulls and...<eos> It could be a year old.<eos> Her legs were frozen.<eos> Frozen...<eos> Yes. Can you look into it?<eos> Of course, yeah.<eos> I'll do it first thing in the morning.<eos> Who can I call to look into it now?<eos> ¿oh, por que?
___<eos> ___<eos> Hey... hey... ___<eos> E-mail would have been quicker.<eos> But not as pleasant.<eos> I brought you breakfast.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Going with you.<eos> Why?
And it really moved me.<eos> So I thought I'd give it a shot.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Well, as a therapist, It's not my place to judge the choices that you make.<eos> So, everybody else, Feel free to judge the choices they make.<eos> - I think it's great.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> If it makes them happy to be together, Maybe they won't have to come here anymore, And that'll make me happy and I won't have to come here anymore.<eos> And with the three of them gone, I can finally finish my story about my aunt bruce.<eos> Unbelievable.
Don't worry, sweetie, I don't think she taught her "Hefty Hanna."<eos> It was kind of a weird question for a college essay.<eos> "Discuss one situation in which you were right and wish you hadn't been."<eos> I could name ten.<eos> Well, your high school experience hasn't been exactly typical.<eos> You hated it.<eos> No.<eos> No. I thought it was very well written, I thought it was very moving,<eos> I just... question whether this is something you'd want to share with an admissions committee.<eos> Why?
I think submitting this as-is would be a huge mistake.<eos> Look, Spencer, if you throw this all out there, your many attractive qualities might be overshadowed.<eos> Honesty may not be the best policy.<eos> So you want me to pretend to be somebody that I'm not.<eos> No.<eos> But you are more than this.<eos> Yeah, but I wouldn't be if it weren't for that.<eos> I mean, why can't I just take a risk and be real and, I don't know, have a little faith that maybe somebody who reads this will actually be impressed that I left Radley, that I'm not still there making crafts out of uncooked macaroni.<eos> Spencer, I... when has being dishonest ever helped me?<eos> Or you?
- so that he wouldn't know her plan...<eos> - No.<eos> Toby, some people, they find an inner peace once they decide...<eos> - We never saw this.<eos> Her doctor never shared that.<eos> This place is covering something up, and I need to know more.<eos> You're gonna trust information that "A" supplies?<eos> Come on, what does "A" ultimately want from you?<eos> Please, you can't tell her about this.<eos> - Or anyone else.
You know, my cousin's working in the shop today. Is he? Yeah.<eos> He said we can take anything we want.<eos> Let's go, then.<eos> I'm telling you. Any trainers you want, man.<eos> Where you lot going?<eos> Shop.<eos> We'll be back in a bit, innit? Hurry up though, innit?<eos> Don't take the piss.<eos> You got to tell someone.<eos> Like who?

This song is my chance to impress important people, the kind that can make my dreams come true.<eos> That's why I've got to finish it.<eos> Well... would it help if I cleaned the kitchen?<eos> You're my hero.<eos> Hey! Don't leave an egg roll over there.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> You can thank Miss Lucinda.<eos> She helped me get dressed tonight.<eos> Why?
- were you joking?<eos> - About what?<eos> Being a butler.<eos> I mean, you really think this is the perfect job for you?<eos> Sure.<eos> But you're so smart and talented.<eos> You could be anything you want to be.<eos> As it turns out, I want to be a butler.<eos> I don't understand that.<eos> Why not?
Of course. You're here to work, not socialize.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - Would you like some help?<eos> - With what?<eos> Cleaning the kitchen.<eos> I couldn't ask you to do that.<eos> You're a guest here.<eos> Oh, no. It's okay.<eos> I-I love cleaning.<eos> Why?
- Would you like some help?<eos> - With what?<eos> Cleaning the kitchen.<eos> I couldn't ask you to do that.<eos> You're a guest here.<eos> Oh, no. It's okay.<eos> I-I love cleaning.<eos> Why?<eos> I find it soothing.<eos> Why?
- Ah, it's a crap joke, scratch it.<eos> Winston, please. Your belly is on my hip.<eos> - Dad, can you come and take our picture?<eos> - All right.<eos> Having a little trouble getting off this air mattress.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> And we... okay. I'm off, I'm off.<eos> Here... where is it? All right, give me this.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Okay, you ready?
You mean us?<eos> What, now we are not a great combo?<eos> Sorry I suggested we go to a quote-seminar-unquote.<eos> Sorry I'm trying to move us forward.<eos> Sorry that you think you know how to do everything.<eos> Sorry that you resent the fact that I know how to do business.<eos> Sorry that you think you know how to do business, and maybe that's why our first business failed.<eos> Sorry that you took two weed breaks every single day instead of making work calls, and maybe that's why our business failed.<eos> Sorry that I didn't take more weed breaks, because I really could have used them working with a know-it-all like you!<eos> - And sorry--
With a six handicap?<eos> Connor McClane pushed hard to get you this meeting.<eos> We had some reservations about you.<eos> Well, like the sound of "had."<eos> Yeah. Well, the T.K. from the Sport-E Boost video scared us.<eos> But the T.K. sitting here right now...<eos> You're the breath of fresh air we need to revitalize the brand.<eos> But I -- you know, one piece of advice.<eos> Only thing that could make Machismo any more sexy is adding one extra ingredient.<eos> Me.
What was I supposed to do?<eos> I couldn't have my new boss thinking I was crazy.<eos> Oh, I got one. _ (Horn blares)<eos> Oh... got away.<eos> That was a big one, too.<eos> Axl, stop screwing around and get over here and help.<eos> Why are you yelling at me?<eos> I'm not the one who put the boat in the ditch 'cause I was looking at what I can't buy.<eos> - Will you stop?<eos> - Why?
But if he is, he's probably cleaning house, which means that Aiden could be next.<eos> Or you.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Hey, thank God.<eos> I went to the police. They said Daniel bailed you out after the blackout.<eos> So I came here.<eos> I figured you'd be here<eos> - or across the street or...<eos> - You shouldn't be here, Declan.<eos> Why?
You don't know a damn thing about our relationship.<eos> Well, I know enough to know that if you two were married, you'd spend the rest of your life regretting it.<eos> You stupid, arrogant boy.<eos> Ohh!<eos> I've just given you something a man like you is rarely offered...<eos> A second chance.<eos> You're going to let Emily go and you're going to let her go tonight.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get backstage?<eos> Sorry, Miss.
Billy's the father.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wendy.<eos> You having a hard time getting comfortable?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just so big.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> I have a hard time getting comfortable, too.<eos> Yeah, really? Why?
I've never seen her so mad.<eos> Could I see the ultrasound?<eos> Just, uh, pretend you can't hear her, Jim.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> Oh, good-looking kid.<eos> Reminds me of my dad.<eos> Mind if I hold onto it?<eos> - How about Alana?<eos> - Well, I still love "***".<eos> Me, too.
- Yes, three years ago.<eos> I bet you miss him.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I just wish I could talk to him again.<eos> Can somebody hand me that box of Kleenex?<eos> Please, don't cry.<eos> I know exactly how you feel.<eos> I mean, I've never mentioned this in session, but sometimes I pick up the phone and I try to call my mother in heaven.<eos> This is why kids should die before their parents.<eos> Hey, guys.
And a man's life is at stake here, which I do not take lightly.<eos> So I'm inclined to give Mr. Bauer a little leeway.<eos> When was the first time that you met Billy Flynn?<eos> When I went to ask him if he knew what happened to my dog.<eos> And what did he say?<eos> That he kicked Gypsy's head in because her barking woke him up.<eos> It was the middle of the afternoon.<eos> Now, 10 years ago, Billy Flynn was incarcerated for aggravated assault.<eos> What kind of inmate was he back then?<eos> Worst of the worst.
Looks like you're not the only unexpected guest.<eos> What's Ellen doing here?<eos> If she thinks her husband's alive, then why the waterworks?<eos> Doesn't add up, dude.<eos> Ellen?<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - No. You are no better than the FBI.<eos> I know you're part of this cover-up.<eos> - What cover up?
would they? we should contact the central government and await orders.<eos> We cannot handle an emergency such as this on our own.<eos> E-Excuse me! A messenger just arrived!<eos> They say Wall Maria has been breached! The Titans are invading!<eos> It's over...<eos> It's over.<eos> Humanity will be devoured by Titans again.<eos> It's over.<eos> I can never go home...<eos> Why?
You want that?<eos> All right, nobody sees you. You understand?<eos> Got it.<eos> I'm a ghost.<eos> The average hit rate for a trained marksman firing at a target from 50 feet under ideal conditions is over 99%.<eos> Of course that assumes you can see your target.<eos> If you're under fire and shooting blind, that hit rate drops to about zero.<eos> I'm almost out.<eos> I'm on my last clip.<eos> - Yeah, me too.

Okay.<eos> So you've written about Judge Gates, right?<eos> You already asked me that question.<eos> We're asking again.<eos> immigration, some professor grabbing another professor at the university, the cancer walk, the Building Commission meetings,<eos> Puppypalooza.<eos> Whatever crap story my editor wants to put me on, that's what I write about... it's my job.<eos> There are five murders a year in El Paso.<eos> In Juarez, thousands.<eos> Why?
She's here with me.<eos> Sonya sends her regards.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> My wife says hi.<eos> I didn't say hello.<eos> I don't know her.<eos> No, you will meet her.<eos> She's very curious about you.<eos> Why?
See you tomorrow?<eos> Is this your car? Yes, why?<eos> Just like that.<eos> It's been ages I saw a Renault 25.<eos> Yeah, they don't produce it anymore. I don't know why.<eos> Specially because it was a great car.<eos> Anyway, I'm really happy with mine.<eos> So, see you tomorrow.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Michel.
!<eos> What, he's dead?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> That's all I need for now,<eos> - but you'll have to wait for the detective.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> How you feeling, sweetheart?<eos> A little weak.
We're following her.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> And you're not. We need to ask you some questions.<eos> What the hell's this about, Rigby?<eos> Questions about what?<eos> The attempted assassination of Nikoloz Arziani.<eos> You're not really her lawyer.<eos> She just retained me.<eos> And I really am a lawyer.<eos> Expensive?
Five days ago, someone using your name and password Tried to access your old account.<eos> But that account would've been archived<eos> When I left the Service.<eos> The password wouldn't have even worked. The failed attempt to access your account<eos> Triggered a security alert. Your account page wasn't the only portal<eos> Arziani's itinerary.<eos> In particular, his travel details -<eos> Where he'd be, when he'd leave, how he'd leave.<eos> Who did you give that password to?<eos> No one.
Five minutes.<eos> Five and a half!<eos> Benji.<eos> Is that what he calls you?<eos> What do you call him?<eos> Is he French?<eos> British?<eos> German? - Swiss? - No.<eos> I can't tell you anything.<eos> Why not?
About what?<eos> Gemma Kirwan, among other things.<eos> Among other things?<eos> You think I'm the person that killed Gemma?<eos> Why is her photo on your computer?<eos> I keep records for people I help.<eos> Like Anthony Walsh?<eos> He was just trying to destroy my work.<eos> He was doing the same to her.<eos> To who?
Shit, honestly!<eos> Interference.<eos> Disorders by the body of the missile.<eos> This can not be avoided.<eos> You know, before what I 'm really scared?<eos> We have a controversial discussion, whether we need to break the capsule, when in enemy Should land territory.<eos> I've been to blow it,<eos> And you know why?<eos> So that the enemy does not realize in what for 'nem scrap we fly into space!<eos> A shame!
Bring on Malinowski!<eos> Join me with Marshal Malinovsky.<eos> Malinowski, how long you want your first Cosmonaut nor his lieutenant in space?<eos> We promote him to captain.<eos> Lieutenant or captain!<eos> Cause you on the spot, that he was promoted to Major!<eos> We can not have a Skip rank!<eos> And for what reason?<eos> We would thus Thousands of captains in our army alienate!<eos> Rodion.
I would be the first to of this darkness breaks through.<eos> And I believed it immediately,<eos> But that was not God, right?<eos> Of course not, but I heard a voice.<eos> We believe pilots to such voices,<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.<eos> But just because we never quite our Can be trusted equipment.<eos> Who can we trust?<eos> Ourselves
Oh, I know so.<eos> Anyway... I'm sorry that I had to drop that kiss bomb on you.<eos> Never apologize for saving my life... Or kissing me.<eos> - Well, that didn't last long.<eos> - What?<eos> Us both being in a relationship at the same time.<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> Honestly, I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be dating Fitch.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?
Me?<eos> Nothing. Why do you think I said something?<eos> You told her I called her uptight.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That might have come up.<eos> Riley, she broke up with me.<eos> Oh my God, Danny, I'm sorry.<eos> It just... it just came out.<eos> But honestly, you haven't been acting like yourself around her.<eos> Why?
You should come, get a sitter.<eos> You never know who you'll meet.<eos> I kinda think you just told me, and his name rhymes with "mirard."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> Ta-Da! Oh, hey, Mrs. Wheeler.<eos> Oh, hey, Riley.<eos> You look like you're ready to stay in and do laundry tonight.<eos> - Wanna watch Emma for me?<eos> - Ooh, sorry.
Put the noodles in the shed.<eos> There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.<eos> Hmm? Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.<eos> I say we make it into saga soup and have ourselves a soup sip.<eos> That'll show Carl for de-friending us in real life!<eos> I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?<eos> Well, we won't know that till after.<eos> Just read the saga and see what it says.<eos> But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic?<eos> With these.
I think I found something.<eos> The Mumwrath.<eos> Its mouth is so filled with fangs, it's like being pressed together between two beds of nails.<eos> We don't want to kill her, Your Majesty, not until we're done with her.<eos> Jafar, I know this girl.<eos> Fear...<eos> Fear of losing her Cyrus is the only thing that will make her wish.<eos> Go on.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> The Sarlacc.
I'm sorry, Lacey.<eos> Stealing that was... well, I shouldn't have done it so...<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Why did you even come last night?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I just miss us hanging out.<eos> Obviously not that much since you're willing to steal from me.<eos> I'll do whatever I have to do to help Danny.<eos> I have to believe he didn't do this.<eos> Why?
That's not like you.<eos> Well, I guess it is like me because I let him tell you, I just wanted to make sure you knew.<eos> - Why the day after graduation?<eos> - Why not?<eos> I wanted to be out of high school and I'll be out of high school.<eos> Come by the restaurant either before you pick up John or after you pick up John, I want to see you and talk face-to-face.<eos> Dad, you'll see me.<eos> Ricky and I will come by and have dinner one night this week.<eos> - Tonight.<eos> - Why tonight?
Lonely life.<eos> Only if you need company.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Have you finished?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> Lloyd?<eos> We've got a match on the DNA, sir.<eos> His name's Michael Reynolds.<eos> Did you phone just now?<eos> Yes. Why?
Like we all were.<eos> Could Gwilym have had anything to do with Michael Reynolds's death?<eos> No.<eos> Not Gwilym.<eos> Michael persuaded Wyn to let us use his caravan.<eos> When you told me who it was in the quarry... I panicked.<eos> I had to know if Wyn had told Dic about me and Michael.<eos> He said he hadn't.<eos> I was so relieved.<eos> Why?
All right, this plane is getting us out of here.<eos> This one?<eos> Looks like it's in the middle of heart surgery. They're replacing the magnetic electric generators.<eos> And those are for decoration?<eos> We don't need the backup.<eos> I can have this plane ready to fly in 30 minutes.<eos> Call the tower, try to get us clearance.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Yo. I don't like the looks of that.<eos> Yeah, me neither.
Is that something or just noise on the film?<eos> That looks real to me.<eos> It's Alex.<eos> Get a C.T. angio and find me.<eos> I want to look at those vessels.<eos> All right. I'll hyperventilate him.<eos> When we get to 100%, I'll say go, you cut.<eos> We watch his sats drop to 90%.<eos> Below 90%, there could be tissue damage, even brain damage, so at 90%, I'll say stop and I'll pump him up again.<eos> You ready?

The girls are gonna love it.<eos> It'll give him some mystery.<eos> Thank you... so much.<eos> Amazing.<eos> - Mm. - This was an amazing day.<eos> Well, you guys did most of the work.<eos> I'm happy I just got to watch.<eos> Yeah, well, is there anything else that I can...<eos> You can show me to an on-call room.<eos> Uh... w... why?
Not everyone's like you, Alex.<eos> People are horrible.<eos> And the last time someone grabbed me like Jason did, I...<eos> I promised no one would ever do that again.<eos> So I am sorry, but... not everyone's like you.<eos> We try to be safe.<eos> And now you think I'm horrible, too.<eos> No.<eos> No. If you hadn't gotten to him first, I probably would have killed the guy.<eos> Why?
You did your best with that girl, Ricky.<eos> We all thought so.<eos> Bloody Powell stepping in like that, made me look a right charlie.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Let's dance the night away.<eos> Tell the boys to give it some life.<eos> This is for you.<eos> She's going. Hasn't taken the money.<eos> Where on earth did you find her?<eos> Jeannie?
I'm worried it will harm baby.<eos> Trust me. I'm a doctor.<eos> Darling, you do...<eos> ..love me?<eos> I'm marrying you, aren't I?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I love every...tiny... ..inch of you.<eos> Now run along, before I take the law into my own hands.<eos> Go on.<eos> Jeannie?
You should be in a hospital.<eos> Mr Powell, please.<eos> I have to.<eos> It's out of the question.<eos> I'll never have a chance like this again.<eos> Please, Mr Powell.<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Do it, Otto.<eos> Help her.<eos> Jeannie?
Mr Powell, please.<eos> I have to.<eos> It's out of the question.<eos> I'll never have a chance like this again.<eos> Please, Mr Powell.<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Do it, Otto.<eos> Help her.<eos> Jeannie?<eos> Jeannie!
Are you offering this to me, because Laurie's coming here?<eos> Well, I'm just saying...<eos> - Now it's a party.<eos> - Ketamine or cheese?<eos> It's right here if you change your mind.<eos> Oh, this is nice.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> Galaxy, that thrift store.<eos> - Oh, I love that place.<eos> - Me too.
(TV playing loudly) I said, turn that down!<eos> George?<eos> Wow. I'm really good at finding people.<eos> Of course you'll think of some way to save that parade.<eos> You're Lavon Hayes.<eos> You can do anything.<eos> Oh. And you are the sweetest little cousin in the whole wide world.<eos> What is this?<eos> Gluten-free blueberry muffins.<eos> Why?
- I'm sorry.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> Wow.<eos> Uh,<eos> I haven't dropped a bag over a guy since the 11th grade.<eos> Tyler Wotmo.<eos> How'd that work out for you?<eos> He was a nice guy. Terrible acne, though.<eos> - So mixed?
Craig was always borrowing from him.<eos> Racked up quite a hefty debt.<eos> If that wasn't enough, then he stole his girlfriend.<eos> You're saying you think Craig was seeing Robbie's girlfriend?<eos> I know he was.<eos> I went over to Craig's...<eos> (Exhales) - (Pen clicks) Listen, I...<eos> I... - Your shoes!<eos> Like to go over the details of your statement from ten years ago.<eos> Why?
I'll see if I can narrow it down.<eos> Find some paint particles somewhere.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Call me with anything else.<eos> You havin' fun, Peck?<eos> You told me to be here.<eos> (Typing) Where's the witch?<eos> Uh, Celery is at home.<eos> We gotta find her.<eos> Why?
I'm not super business-savvy.<eos> I only pick up every few weeks from that guy.<eos> I don't even know his last name.<eos> First name?<eos> Ivan.<eos> I went over there today.<eos> He wasn't around.<eos> Door was open, I went in, figured I'd blaze a j-man, wait for him to show up, but he never did.<eos> I was heading out when that officer grabbed me and handed me over to that crotchety black-haired dude.<eos> Yeah. Officer Swarek.
Sounds like someone's targeting 15, so this case is top priority.<eos> So anything you guys need, you got it.<eos> (Tone chimes, woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.) (Bottle clunks) (Man) How could you not know anything?<eos> Chloe Price.<eos> She's a police officer.<eos> (Woman) I'm sorry.<eos> There's no word yet.<eos> - Can I talk to someone who does know something?<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - Why?
On the morning of the wedding.<eos> Why didn't you tell me, Jean?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And Otto knew... ..when he walked you up the aisle?<eos> Who the hell does he think he is?<eos> Please, darling.<eos> He did it for us.<eos> You wouldn't have gone through with it.<eos> Did you honestly believe I'd cancel the whole shooting match.<eos> Oh, Jeannie.
Bloody madman.<eos> Terrorism's not the answer.<eos> I'm sure he'd have built the Vanguard Party of the Proletariat if he'd only had the time.<eos> Can I take a look at granddad's pistol?<eos> The Spanish Civil War one.<eos> You said it was for me after you die.<eos> I did.<eos> And Adam after you.<eos> I'd like to borrow it now - show it to someone.<eos> Who?
Didn't feel like anything.<eos> You're gonna love this.<eos> The water in Brendan's lungs was chlorinated.<eos> - Definitely not the river?<eos> - Not a chance in hell.<eos> Brendan McCann drowned in good, old-fashioned Detroit tap water.<eos> You got yourself a murder.<eos> That's great work, Leo.<eos> That's, um... first-rate.<eos> Kahlil.
What is it, huh?<eos> What is it?<eos> You kept my daughter from me... (Shouts) for 13 years!<eos> I will never forgive you for that.<eos> Never!<eos> And the more that I know you, the more I realize I was right to keep it a secret.<eos> You would've taken both girls away from me.<eos> You are damn right I would've.<eos> You weren't answering any of my texts and I just wanna say I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.<eos> Why?
- like a Mexican jumping bean? !<eos> - Oh, and don't wait up for me.<eos> I might grab a pitcher of beer and play Foosball with the boys.<eos> Joyce, don't do this!<eos> Come on!<eos> I made you breakfast.<eos> So much for being loving and supportive.<eos> So you're gonna tell me you didn't enjoy getting out of school early?<eos> No, I'm telling you, that when you pull the fire alarm, you can't brag to the other kids about it.<eos> Why?
Three times six?<eos> Eighteen.<eos> Leave him to it.<eos> Nine times eight?<eos> - Fifty-four.<eos> - Seventy-two, dummy.<eos> You want to shut up and let me hear this?<eos> Pablo, my darling, Sunday we have the christening.<eos> We're going to go as movie stars.<eos> All of us.
"Let's see if your kids like it," he said.<eos> And here ...<eos> Here he wrote the lyrics for me. Untitled so far.<eos> So, you've become friends.<eos> But of course man I haven't told you will come to see me?<eos> You see the guy's face when this one day in class.<eos> Don't touch it with your fat fingers full of grease!<eos> "Living is easy with eyes closed."<eos> Come, Antonio.<eos> Ready?
-I've a right to be here.<eos> I own these properties.<eos> If there's a problem...<eos> DCI Stanhope.<eos> Step over here, Mr...<eos> I'm fine where I am.<eos> All right, just wait, love.<eos> Get back in the car.<eos> -Has somebody been hurt?<eos> -Aye, a young woman.
- I don't know. Cailin, hi.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - My mom went to Europe.<eos> You didn't go with her?<eos> - Well, here. Let me help.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> I got it.<eos> What happened to your foot? I sprained my ankle.<eos> - Oh. Sorry.
- Yes.<eos> - You're not Mr Stevens.<eos> I did try to tell you before.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Craig.<eos> - And you're not alone.<eos> No, I needed someone to help me with the chair.<eos> Give the phone to your friend.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> - But why?
- Take the boards off that door.<eos> - We are staying down here, Hellen.<eos> Harry, that radio is at least some kind of communication.<eos> It is the authority to know what happening with the friends. People force that they'll tell us what to do.<eos> How we're going to know what's going on... if we lock ourselves in this dungeon? ....<eos> Timmy?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can I sleep in here with you tonight?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Why?
I uh, had a phone call.<eos> No distractions, remember?<eos> Actually, my friend is coming here to meet me. Oh.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Well, looks like you have your hands full.<eos> She part of your "research"?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you don't get to ask me any questions till you explain this little ensemble of yours.<eos> Oh, yeah. Fleckner built my avatar.<eos> I feel like I let one of my little brother's friends dress me.<eos> Yeah, the really cool one.
And I've got a friend at the DA's office that I'm talking to about Liam.<eos> I will let you know what happens, but just wanted you to know.<eos> Oh, Jesus... I made that from scratch with really good cheese.<eos> - It's great.<eos> - It's a lost cause, babe.<eos> Somebody pass me the tabasco?<eos> - Oh... - I'm kidding. Kidding.<eos> I like this.<eos> I got to play this tomorrow for the grim reaper.<eos> - Grim reaper?
I just wanted to be with everyone.<eos> I'll call them.<eos> Don't ever do that again, OK?<eos> We should all try to get some sleep.<eos> Callie.<eos> Are you awake?<eos> I am now.<eos> This reminds me of our mom.<eos> I know.<eos> Me too.
Thank you.<eos> It's the wrong one.<eos> Never get that on my finger.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well I think it's high time that somebody kissed somebody, don't you think?<eos> - It's ok, mi amor.<eos> - I know.<eos> But she's going to be devastated when she finds out we aren't coming back.<eos> I'm sorry he didn't come.<eos> Me, too. For him.
Do you, uh, remember me, Erica?<eos> I'm Ruben Bauer, your lawyer, and I've brought my friend Dr. Pierce to talk to you.<eos> It's... it's Daniel.<eos> How's your throat?<eos> Does it still hurt after the surgery?<eos> You get used to it.<eos> You've swallowed sharp objects before.<eos> Pens and pencils are my bread and butter.<eos> I've swallowed nails, too...<eos> Some forks.
And then I said, "What's up, Responsible Insurance?"<eos> (chuckles) Exactly!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Would it help if I called Michael and apologized?<eos> Nah, don't bother.<eos> I doubt it would've worked out anyway.<eos> He drives a Honda.<eos> And he's so pale.<eos> Anyway, that's the last time I let Dad set me up.<eos> Dad?
(chuckles) Hey, you know what?<eos> You're getting a wedgie, Poindexter.<eos> (laughing) ...most of our edible products are organic.<eos> Now, I want to start with a really basic command, just to see where we're all at.<eos> Let's try "sit." Oh, oh. Hey, you guys.<eos> Listen up, listen up.<eos> When Teacher says "sit,"<eos> we all gonna shit.<eos> (laughs)<eos> Ready?
You're the winning... est.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you not telling me?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're trying way too hard to make me feel better.<eos> Donna may have told me that Maggie got a job at the country club.<eos> Okay, here are your virgin strawberry daiquiris.<eos> ♪ Everyone's looking at you one for you. And one for you.<eos> Okay. Could you be a doll and get me a yellow umbrella for my drink?<eos> - Why?
You seem awfully eager to get in.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah, that would be an understatement.<eos> Well, I don't like people who cut the line.<eos> I believe in democracy.<eos> Look, I'm kind of in a crisis, and I just need to get in there and see my friends.<eos> So do all those people who are waiting patiently.<eos> Look, I didn't want to have to do this, but if you don't let me in, I'm gonna have to tell Sam you were rude to me.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Sam who?
I'm not an idiot.<eos> I know you guys took it.<eos> Why don't you just wear a different one?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that your only one?<eos> That sucks.<eos> You know what?<eos> I got to get to work.<eos> Yeah, Mack's not paying us to sit around at the beach all day anyway...<eos> Well, not you, at least.
I am Simon Stagg.<eos> Do you have any idea how powerful I am in this city?<eos> Now, I'm warning you... [gasps]<eos> Mister Toad: Excellent shot, boss, right in the gizzard.<eos> Oh, my, that doesn't sound good.<eos> Have you had your cholesterol checked recently?<eos> Must watch the red meat.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Because of what you've done to our kind.<eos> - Your kind?
Oh, but I'm a lion tamer.<eos> Siegfried and Roy in this...<eos> Sheera?<eos> Sheera?<eos> Did I just get Jetered in my own home?<eos> Dr. Santino.<eos> Yes?<eos> Sam Conte from the L.A. office.<eos> I'm Cindy Luck's West Coast rep.<eos> Oh, pleasure.
That was Hendricks from the building.<eos> Turns out someone did pry open the drain grate, then welded it on the way out.<eos> There's hope for you, Beckett.<eos> Well, at least we know we're on the right track.<eos> Excuse me. Federal agents.<eos> Uh, is this about the blackout the other night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Well, like I told the other guy, I wasn't here, so you'll have to talk to Watkins.<eos> What other guy?
This is bad.<eos> Just got passed by a tree.<eos> Just keep driving.<eos> I've got to get home to Molly.<eos> I feel horrible.<eos> I can't believe I lied to her about the thing with Vince.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was the time for truth.<eos> So I just want to say you are the best friend and partner I've ever had.<eos> Thanks, buddy.
Okay, guys, let's check out a fan video question.<eos> This is from Audrey.<eos> Professionally talking, did Twitter change something, and if yes, what?<eos> PS: I love you guys.<eos> - We love you too, Audrey.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks for your question and your endless support.<eos> She's been one of our biggest fans from the very beginning.<eos> I think she's the reason the show is successful.<eos> - Single-handedly.
I'm gonna give the interns the rest of the night off.<eos> Can you give me a hand if there's anything they drop?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm so sorry about Heather.<eos> Yeah. Dr. Hunt, Lydia's desatting, decreased breath sounds on the left.<eos> - Wha...<eos> - Sharpie lady.<eos> Should I throw in a chest tube?<eos> Dr. Yang is gonna take over that case.<eos> Why?
I can't page someone 9-1-1 without the name of the patient...<eos> When Dr. Torres calls in, she'll expect to know who...<eos> No, there's no patient.<eos> Just page her.<eos> We can't page 9-1-1 without a patient emergency.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Does it look like this is not an emergency?<eos> Hey, hey! What's going on? What's going on?<eos> - I need you to page Callie 9-1-1.<eos> - Why?
Can I get you something?<eos> Uh, just water would be great.<eos> - All right. I'll see you in a bit. - Thanks.<eos> ♪ the stars are lined up<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't tell me you've stopped drinking now.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> - It's for Emily.<eos> - Your fiancée, right?
How cute.<eos> You think you're middle-class.<eos> We are very happy with Wilson.<eos> Really? Maybe I should teach Boyd how to fashion a shiv out of a lunch tray.<eos> Dad. What are... do not put those thoughts in his head.<eos> Come on, buddy. Let's grab your stuff.<eos> [Claps] I do not want you giving Boyd the idea that he is unsafe around other cultures, okay?<eos> We want to raise him with an open heart.<eos> If he takes that shiv training seriously, the open heart will be the other kid's problem.<eos> Unbelievable.
I don't really know what we're doing here.<eos> WADE: We need to have a heart-to-heart. FRYE:<eos> I'm not really interested. SHERRY:<eos> Hey, Daniel, sit down. FRYE:<eos> Oh, no. No, thanks.<eos> WADE: This guy chose you for a reason, son.<eos> He drove your car out onto the bridge, and he picked you for this bomb nonsense.<eos> FRYE: Yeah, I recall.<eos> WADE: Yeah, now he tips you off to the location of these new victims.<eos> Why?
You want to interrogate him?<eos> I want to rip him down to the studs.<eos> I want the name of every agent he's ever run in the United States. And I want to know just how close the regime is to a nuclear weapon.<eos> Ms. Mathison?<eos> Leland Bennett.<eos> What is this place?<eos> The firm keeps it for our more privacy-sensitive clients.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I tried to tell your colleague Mr., um...<eos> Franklin.
We're gonna push them back with Hellfire.<eos> Roger.<eos> Withdraw with Hellfire in support, on your command.<eos> On my command. Roger. Wait.<eos> Are they aborting the mission?<eos> You had some bad luck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> At least we have Javadi. He's still in play. That's not nothing.<eos> Stand by for Hellfire mission, over.<eos> You guys ready?
Was that him?<eos> If it was, I would have to tell you, wouldn't I?<eos> Doesn't mean that you would.<eos> Two full days, and he still hasn't called.<eos> That's my math, too.<eos> I don't understand why.<eos> Maybe he's resting on his laurels, after he made you and the Feds look like a bunch of chumps.<eos> You do a lot of drugs, don't you?<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Yes, well...<eos> I put a bullet right in his brain pan, but it didn't kill him.<eos> No, it went "pshoo"!<eos> So now he's got three hots and a cot, courtesy of the state.<eos> Course he doesn't know what day it is.<eos> So they sent you to the shrink.<eos> No, I sent me to the shrink.<eos> I was having a hard time with what I done.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> No, not Dobbs.
Well, yeah.<eos> You guys invaded my land.<eos> Strangers all over my property.<eos> Who knows what you left there or took?<eos> Yeah, I've been stolen from before.<eos> What about the car at Peter Meadows' house, where he was killed?<eos> Also stolen!<eos> But you didn't report it.<eos> Who would I report it to?<eos> You?
__<eos> What did you do?<eos> She's alive.<eos> You said you knew where we were going.<eos> I do.<eos> We missed the highway.<eos> It's safer this way, Ray.<eos> Shit, man, I took fast boats loaded to the rails with coke into Miami, never got stopped once.<eos> - You know why?<eos> - Why, Ray?
Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I just... he... She was telling me that...<eos> Awkward.<eos> I know I'm not your pcp. Primary care physician, but I'd be happy to make a referral for a psych consult, Beth.<eos> Oh. No, no, I'm fine.<eos> I just...<eos> Give that potluck some thought.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Potluck?
You want to coach?<eos> That's easy. I know the athletic director over at Emerson High.<eos> They won city four years in a row.<eos> Y-You'd put in a call for me?<eos> Yeah, I delivered all three of his chubby, ugly girls.<eos> He's like family.<eos> Done. Okay, enough chitchat.<eos> It's time to get young Carter here back on the horse.<eos> Help you forget all about Susan.<eos> Sara.
Wait, when do you talk to Violet?<eos> We talk all the time, and we're Facebook friends.<eos> I don't want her talking to you.<eos> Well, she has to talk to somebody.<eos> She's sexually active, drinking, smoking grass. Sound familiar?<eos> You're making this about me?<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I have come to understand that you were the best daughter you could be.<eos> My job is to forgive you, which I do.<eos> Oh, my God!
We're just taking care of business.<eos> (Lou) I'll, uh, talk to Perkins.<eos> (Crash) He's lying.<eos> I can see it in his eyes.<eos> (Jack) Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Thatcher.<eos> - Uncle Lou is family.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And what's more sacred than that?<eos> I miss this.<eos> Me, too.
A V3 employee -- can't give a name.<eos> But let's say this person wanted to tell their story to the FBI -- admit their guilt.<eos> Is there any chance for leniency?<eos> Depends.<eos> On? The crime -- what laws were broken, how many people were involved, how much money, who was hurt.<eos> What can you tell me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I can set up a meeting... with someone I know from my time at the bureau.<eos> You worked at the FBI?<eos> Briefly.
Four sacks? Incredible.<eos> You about decapitated the quarterback.<eos> If you run my way, you better duck, baby.<eos> This ain't tickleball.<eos> Hey, thanks for showing up.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Oh, my pleasure.<eos> Thanks so much. God bless.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, everybody.
So sorry to attack...<eos> Shit! from behind...<eos> Sasha and Connie...<eos> Hurry and help them!<eos> I'm...<eos> So sorry!<eos> Mikasa!<eos> You saved me!<eos> Are you injured?<eos> thanks to you...
Let's go together and—<eos> Reiner?<eos> It's not time yet.<eos> We must group up first.<eos> It's over... we'll be dead before we make it out of here.<eos> I'm prepared to die...<eos> But what exactly am I going to die for?<eos> Mikasa!<eos> Weren't you with the rear guard?<eos> Annie!
They can't track us.<eos> - Hello, Nikita.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.<eos> Who I am is not important.<eos> What is important is the offer I'd like to make.<eos> - Are you a salesman?<eos> - In a way, yes.<eos> I'm offering you a new life.<eos> All of you.
Are we done?<eos> I have to get back.<eos> That's the nice thing about being in charge of a major corporation.<eos> But, yes, we're done.<eos> I have done everything the group has ever asked.<eos> But this is new and strange.<eos> And we never have to do it again.<eos> But one more question.<eos> Who do you ultimately serve-- yourself, the group, or me?<eos> You...
Look, Nikita works best when she can divide and conquer.<eos> I suggest you deny her that approach and fortify to a single location.<eos> Well, this place is totally off the grid.<eos> I ran it through a dozen shell companies, so it wouldn't show up under my name.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'll come prepared with some recommendations on how to deal with Nikita.<eos> No.<eos> I'll call the others, and we'll figure out Nikita.<eos> And then we'll discuss you.<eos> Me?
Man your ATMs.<eos> Why would a robot need mittens?<eos> Why would a little boy need an aspirin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The one thing Bongo Comics are good for.<eos> Are you okay, Chief?<eos> I'll be fine, I'll be fine.<eos> God, I bent down to pick up a piece of candy and rolled down a hill.<eos> You always think it's the other guy that'll turn into a giant snowball.<eos> Never you.
Grace, you just have to get over that, you got into a half-dozen schools, just pick one.<eos> Yeah, but as soon as I pick one, Jack's just going to make plans to follow me there, like a puppy or something.<eos> Um, you love Jack.<eos> Remember all those months of crying in the hospital...<eos> Please, just wake up Jack, wake up, I'll do anything if you'll just wake up.<eos> I never said that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Don't make me feel like a bad person just because I don't want to be obligated to some guy right out of high school.<eos> Some guy?
And when I was the good girl, I liked me better.<eos> This is so screwed up.<eos> I cannot seem to figure out a way to get out of it.<eos> You just have to tell him that you don't want to get married.<eos> What? I want to get married.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Neither do you.<eos> - Hey Dad.<eos> - I like that, your calling me "Dad."<eos> Me too.
Make the task at hand a great deal messier, sir.<eos> Please remain seated, Mr. Harker, or we shall be forced to restrain you.<eos> Mr. Browning.<eos> Correct.<eos> I am here.<eos> Although, if you ever allege that I was, I have four unimpeachable witnesses who will testify under oath that I am at present dining at the Gresham Club.<eos> What is this about?<eos> Why am I here?<eos> I merely wish to present you to my colleagues, who shall remain anonymous for the time being.<eos> - Your colleagues?
It is possible, and here is your proof.<eos> This man was a collector of debts.<eos> He reveled in the screams of pain and pleas for mercy.<eos> Any attempt to confront him only caused the debtor more suffering.<eos> Now... he is as meek as a mouse.<eos> Not a bully anymore.<eos> I have found a way to rid the world of crime and violence.<eos> No more overcrowding of jails.<eos> No more terror in our streets.<eos> No more need for police.
Thank you.<eos> That's good stuff, really good stuff.<eos> - As for me, my greatest pleasure is...<eos> - That's great, Matt.<eos> You were saying something about how you use the ice...<eos> Okay, I think we're done.<eos> Well, thank you, Tracy.<eos> You were terrific.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - And Matt.
That's good stuff, really good stuff.<eos> - As for me, my greatest pleasure is...<eos> - That's great, Matt.<eos> You were saying something about how you use the ice...<eos> Okay, I think we're done.<eos> Well, thank you, Tracy.<eos> You were terrific.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - And Matt.<eos> - Yeah, him, too.
But they put me in a public affairs unit.<eos> I was a good soldier.<eos> I helped recruitment.<eos> But all I ever really wanted was my own command.<eos> And now I finally got it.<eos> And I'm not gonna screw it up.<eos> Captain, I'm sorry. I...<eos> I feel like a jackass.<eos> But on the flip side, there's Ratko.<eos> Humility over.
Kyle?<eos> Travis?<eos> Katie?<eos> Anybody?<eos> Look at me!<eos> I'm flying!<eos> Whoo-hoo! Whoa. Who are you, and what is that?<eos> Um, I'm just leaving, and that is hours upon hours of parenting-free entertainment.<eos> Yeah, okay, my husband did not consult me about this.<eos> Uh, sorry, ma'am.
No complaints.<eos> Meanwhile, seeing as you came all the way out here.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Miss Anabelle!<eos> Look at you.<eos> Listen, you, you had better be nice to me, or I will show you feisty, remember that.<eos> I'll go and saddle her up.<eos> Could you be any more obvious?<eos> We should get going.<eos> Why?
I know, you were after me for years to go, but you know me, I'm just...<eos> I'm not good at confronting the problems in my life.<eos> "Ignore them and they'll go away."<eos> Exactly.<eos> Except all the things that I should have dealt with a long time ago are still there, so...<eos> It's time for me to untangle them.<eos> I think it's great, Stan.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's nice to hear a positive response.<eos> Why?
Like they already think I am...<eos> So everything's cool.<eos> The judge just gave me probation.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> That boy is a problem.<eos> He's been a terrible influence on Allison.<eos> I wouldn't go that far.<eos> Well, she's not seeing him again, that's for sure.<eos> Rosie.
Yeah.<eos> But...<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Look, Anson, you screwed up.<eos> But... everybody deserves a second chance.<eos> Keep at it.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks, Grace, but after the week I've had, I'm looking forward to a night at home.<eos> You, too.
So, for the first time in years, the whole family is gonna be together.<eos> Look, it's not gonna be a cakewalk, but I want Joffrey to have a normal holiday experience, which means being surrounded by his entire family.<eos> Fine. But if Mom and Dad start fighting, I'm putting Joffrey in one of their laps to distract them.<eos> You want to use my baby?<eos> That's genius. Hey!<eos> Fancy meeting you guys here!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No dogs allowed.<eos> I'm just...<eos> Sorry. Yeah.
Listen, I-I think it's time someone told you the truth.<eos> Santa isn't real.<eos> What?<eos> Because no one else can see him, that means he isn't real?<eos> No glass allowed at Clouds.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks, and namaste.<eos> Bye.<eos> Oh. Merry Christmas, Mom.<eos> You, too.
You... You're the topic of my life.<eos> If I... make films till I die, they'll all be about you.<eos> All my films are about you. You know?<eos> Why am I a topic?<eos> Why did we break up?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Why did we break up then?<eos> - Later. I'll tell you later.<eos> - Later? Again?<eos> Why?
Don't get angry.<eos> He's trying to give you advice.<eos> Right? Right.<eos> Be happy drinking.<eos> Are you avoiding me these days?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you never answer my calls these days.<eos> And come out late like this.<eos> Before, you used to... call me often. But you never call me now!<eos> Why?
No.<eos> In the winter, we met outside the library.<eos> You pretended to give me a High 5, then grabbed my hand.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You squeezed it hard like this.<eos> - Don't you remember?<eos> - Oh, right. I did.<eos> Because I liked you.<eos> Did you do that to the other girls?<eos> No. Just you.
You're good.<eos> Can we meet?<eos> Sorry, I'm busy.<eos> There's something I have to tell you.<eos> Tell me now.<eos> Let's have drinks. I'll tell you then.<eos> I already drank too much.<eos> Really?<eos> - It's because of you.<eos> - Me? Why?
No way.<eos> Yeah, you caught me.<eos> What really happened was I was trying to help someone.<eos> Someone I loved very much.<eos> How were you trying to help them?<eos> I was trying to protect them, you know? Stop them getting hurt.<eos> But you got hurt instead. Yeah.<eos> Did they get hurt, too? Uh... yeah, yeah, they did.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.
Get off of me!<eos> Get in there.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> You got to cool down, Ray.<eos> We got to think this through.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> Oh, Christ, Bunch.<eos> Get back out there and keep an eye on him. All right.<eos> It happened to me.<eos> Not you, not you.

- All right, I'll see you tomorrow morning.<eos> - Not if I'm any good at my job.<eos> God, it's cold.<eos> - Cold?<eos> - I hate it, man.<eos> So, who are we meeting?<eos> I told you a hundred times, I can't tell you his name.<eos> All right.<eos> When is this guy gonna show up?<eos> Why? You in a hurry?
Yeah, anyway, tell 'em, Char.<eos> Tell Hank what you just told me.<eos> I really feel the energy of Mr. Kuester Von Jurgens-Ratenicz.<eos> He's restless and tethered to this property.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Ghost city.<eos> It gets even creepier.<eos> - Tell him, Char.<eos> - Well, I feel he really has something important to say.<eos> To who?

Hey!<eos> Why don't you just leave him the fuck alone, yeah?<eos> Are you talking to us?<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you.<eos> Do you really think you're a big man cos there's three of you taking on one kid?<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> He's joking, he's joking.<eos> Hey, just live... live and let live.<eos> I'm gonna shank you!<eos> Me?
Give over, you soft shite.<eos> Come here, come on, welcome home.<eos> So... about that gay guy that you hooked me up with.<eos> Oh! Yeah. Oh, yeah!<eos> I just wanted to say thanks.<eos> It felt good helping somebody.<eos> You know, I think this is what I'm supposed to do with my power.<eos> You know, be like a... A proper hero.<eos> And all thanks to you, eh?<eos> Yeah, pleasure.
He's alive again!<eos> What's the Abby situation?<eos> She's taken an overdose.<eos> Well, is she OK?<eos> She's alive.<eos> Right, good. Well, that's a start. Erm...<eos> You take care of that situation and we'll take care of this situation.<eos> OK, good, yeah. Yeah.<eos> Er... Bye!<eos> Bye.
Oi, Scary!<eos> I've gotta go.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Stay.<eos> Scary's dead.<eos> You don't need me to protect you any more.<eos> It was never just about that.<eos> But you're right.<eos> It's like going down on your mum, or your sister, at least.<eos> Maybe your favourite aunt.
Anything you want, no judgments, no rubbernecks, no cameras, no rules.<eos> I just want to see a girl.<eos> Blonde, green eyes... emerald eyes, named Katia from Romania.<eos> I need to wash you.<eos> Then... whatever you want.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Katia.<eos> What's your real name?<eos> Katia.<eos> Why?
IA shouldn't be here.<eos> Joe's right.<eos> Brendan's in a box.<eos> Just let the poor bastard rest in peace.<eos> Boyd's here to disrupt and upset.<eos> No respect, man.<eos> He's here to remind us where Brendan went and why.<eos> Brendan didn't go anywhere.<eos> He was put in the river.<eos> And I don't--
So get out of here.<eos> Look, man, I'm just trying to make it.<eos> You know what that's like.<eos> Screwing my friends, my teammates?<eos> No, Wiz.<eos> I don't know what that's like.<eos> You're off the team.<eos> You're probably out of baseball.<eos> - Get ready to go tonight. Come on. - Yes, sir.<eos> - Thanks, guys. - Yeah, man.
Her best friend didn't even know until yesterday.<eos> All right.<eos> They're totally faking it.<eos> Right?<eos> You should write detective novels.<eos> Wade's motive is clear.<eos> But Lemon's, we're not gonna know hers until we unmask her secret lover.<eos> Will it hold?<eos> I need, like, ten minutes.<eos> Oh, thank goodness!
I know.<eos> It's just that we've been here a while, and you don't seem any closer to finding gainful employment.<eos> No, but I am.<eos> I've spent the last couple weeks enacting a genius two-pronged plan to get Brick to hire me back.<eos> - I'm intrigued.<eos> - Prong one: butter him up!<eos> Every day I stop by his office, bring him a pastry, say, "Hey".<eos> Prong two:<eos> Every lunch hour, I schmooze the good people of bluebell right in Brick's line of vision.<eos> Why?
What do you mean?<eos> I wanted to start with something I knew I'd be good at.<eos> I think you'll be good at this too.<eos> Just take a deep breath and float face first in the water.<eos> That's it.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Need I remind you that I almost drowned when I was eight?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So sorry.
This is my bar.<eos> It's her bar.<eos> Say that to me again.<eos> Damon. We don't fix up losers.<eos> And we especially don't fix up loser ex-cop lowlife when you ain't brushed your teeth since 2004, man.<eos> I call her May.<eos> I got him, I got him.<eos> Pinwheels?<eos> Next time bring child support.<eos> Why?
- Should I be worried?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm was just going to stop by the brew to see Zack.<eos> Oh, okay. Cool.<eos> So, how's the trip planning going?<eos> You bet on how much schnitzel you can eat before you're craving a patty melt?<eos> Not exactly...<eos> I'm actually gonna go to tell him that the trip is off.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
No.<eos> No, Dr. Palmer, he's not.<eos> Well I-I-I think it would mean a lot to him to hear you play.<eos> He's... he's heard me before.<eos> Yes, but not since you've been here.<eos> I think it would give him a great deal of comfort to know that you're enjoying your music once again.<eos> Don't you think he need to see that?<eos> Um, Dr. Palmer, could you tell me again about the blonde girl?<eos> The one that I should steer clear of?<eos> What blonde?
But based on the toxicology results, the water in his system and the minerals in his blood and the pollutants that were in his windpipe...<eos> Uh, trace amounts like that would be so small, you couldn't possibly determine exactly where...<eos> Best guess.<eos> McBride was murdered and beheaded in the Copper State.<eos> Arizona.<eos> Thanks, Abbs.<eos> If Ziva's in trouble, a badge might come in handy.<eos> If you know how to get it to her, I'm game.<eos> Well, even if someone could contact her, who would she trust?<eos> Shmeil?
Stand up!<eos> Hey you guys. What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> Hiroto-kun?<eos> !<eos> Hey. Old lady, old lady.<eos> Dis ain't no place fer an old lady ta be around.<eos> Hey, let go.<eos> What are you doing to my boyfriend?<eos> Boyfriend?
Paracelsus was--is-- Sutton's brother.<eos> As you know, he had a rather heretical approach to, well, pretty much everything.<eos> Pushed the boundaries of science, often combining that science with artifacts.<eos> Multiple artifacts.<eos> Just a few moments.<eos> Step into the chamber.<eos> By your command, dear brother.<eos> The wine...<eos> You've drugged me.<eos> Why?
You've got to work it out?<eos> Well...there's a fair amount of shit...choice of debacles.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> I've had a good time.<eos> Cool.<eos> Fucking shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> She left quite a while ago, actually.<eos> Oh... Sorry.
You better be sure about this, Hal, before you say anything to anybody.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> I pushed the meeting with Adam Nye to tomorrow.<eos> Water and Power and the Housing Authority can wait till the end of the week.<eos> And I've set the follow-ups with the V.P. candidates for first thing in the morning.<eos> No need.<eos> I've already made my decision.<eos> Who?<eos> You.<eos> Me?
There was only one pokey thing.<eos> And it was mine.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Who cares.<eos> He's snackilicious.<eos> - He smells like cupcakes...<eos> - And fresh laundry...<eos> And Jon Hamm.<eos> - What did Astrid do to us?<eos> - Not us.

She loves with all of her being.<eos> And I can't do any of this without her.<eos> - Now, was that so difficult?<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What you just did, that's...<eos> Sayin' it out loud like that, that's hard.<eos> Yes, to delve into the innermost sanctum of the heart's desires is oft deemed one of life's most arduous journeys.<eos> - Hale, you gotta tell her, man.<eos> - Who?
All right, good stuff, guys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Dude, what the hell?<eos> You stealing my position when I'm not looking?<eos> I guess I just know how to sweet talk coach.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I'll tell him what you said about his hot daughter.<eos> You still down for our workout tomorrow morning?<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> - All right, 7:30?
Oh, can I get your coat?<eos> - Could I... okay.<eos> - Is Jo here?<eos> Not yet.<eos> She said she and Tyler were coming straight from dinner.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, good. I'm gonna<eos> I'm gonna do a lap, just mingle with some folks.<eos> Dude, this house, is it, like, colonial or something?<eos> Or early modern?
Body and soul are buried inside the house... and this is the room where she was murdered.<eos> Do you consider taking this option?<eos> How much do you need?<eos> I expect around 1 million.<eos> I know that you're in trouble... but I can only give you 500,000 Baht.<eos> 500,000 Baht. No.<eos> I may offer you another option that you might be interested in.<eos> Option?<eos> The option is... you have to pawn your soul to a ghost.<eos> Ghost?
- I'm sure something will come up.<eos> - I do do other things with my time, though.<eos> I'm doing a collection of, like, William Blake-style lithographs depicting my entire sexual history, but on Tumblr.<eos> Wh-what's that?<eos> It's like a blog. Oh, right.<eos> It's just an ironic gesture of how romance is outdated.<eos> I haven't really worked it out yet.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Ooh, yeah. So. You never told me how old you were, birthday boy.<eos> Well, birthday man.
Yeah, of course with women, yeah...<eos> Well a...<eos> A woman.<eos> What was her name? It was Mia.<eos> How was it?<eos> You want me to tell you how my date went with another woman?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> We're both adults here.<eos> Plus who else you going to tell?<eos> My sister?
It's the same guys that do Bootsy's.<eos> No, no, no. You're thinking of Shore Club.<eos> Pour Vous is the same guys as Harvard Stone.<eos> I haven't been to Harvard Stone.<eos> Yeah, it's good on Wednesdays.<eos> Maybe I'll check it out.<eos> Yeah, you know, actually, it's pretty good.<eos> You might like it, you might not.<eos> Hey, you guys. I think I'm gonna go.<eos> - Oh, why?
I asked Grace.<eos> Do you want some more coffee?<eos> I'm good.<eos> You know, I knew you liked sports, but this is a lot of memorabilia.<eos> I even have a mouthpiece worn by the great Ron Jaworski himself.<eos> You know, somewhere in here.<eos> I have no idea who that is.<eos> Quarterback for the eagles, back in the day.<eos> I know, I'm borderline obsessive, aren't I?<eos> Borderline?
Stay as long as you want.<eos> - All right.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'm just kind of surprised that you would even consider living in such a small town.<eos> Aren't you the big city guy?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> I mean, I'm just thinking if you can be happy here, maybe I can be happy here.<eos> I've got to find myself a job, though, first, right?<eos> - What do you do?<eos> - Anything.
I hate us.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'm sorry to do this to you, Maya, but I got a warrant to search the house.<eos> You gotta be kidding me, Frank.<eos> You don't have enough real problems to deal with?<eos> This guy look familiar?<eos> No, never seen him.<eos> Not a reason to tear up my house. Come on.<eos> I'm bringing you in for questioning.<eos> Why?
He was really messed up.<eos> And you think he stole the coke. Yeah.<eos> - He didn't share it with you?<eos> - I guess not.<eos> Even though we have witnesses who say a few days later, you were dealing big for the first time in your life!<eos> No, they're lying.<eos> You know what?<eos> This conversation makes me really wanna piss.<eos> What's that?<eos> You too?
Super scared!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> No way!<eos> Oh well...<eos> They're so beautiful...<eos> Nobody else has ever said that.<eos> They're mesmerizing...<eos> This is way more beautiful than my favorite spot underground.<eos> Dad made me realize how beautiful it is.<eos> Your dad?
Wow. Double wow with a side of WTF.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> She's not taking this breakup well, Doc.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Okay, well, you do know that I can't break up with your girlfriend for you, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But maybe you could talk some sense into her, you know?<eos> I mean, I just want this to end without anybody getting hurt.<eos> And honestly, I'm afraid of what Sheera might do.<eos> To you?

Right now, it's kinda nice just hanging out like this.<eos> All right, give it a shot.<eos> - Oh, hey guys.<eos> - MB!<eos> What's up?<eos> Just putting the sharks to bed.<eos> Actually, the sharks might be put down permanently.<eos> Mac told me we're closing the parks on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.<eos> - Really?<eos> Why?
Save your friend before it's too late.<eos> [grunts]<eos> Big guy, get up, we've got a mission to complete, fast!<eos> You can't win!<eos> I'm growing stronger by the second.<eos> And uglier.<eos> Give it to me!<eos> With pleasure!<eos> That's for what you did to my parents!<eos> [both] Parents?
- Oh, honey.<eos> I don't believe it, wow.<eos> Luke. I'm calling it, best 'take your kid to work day' ever.<eos> Weird. But best.<eos> [Spider-Man] Luke's parents, saved and reunited.<eos> Scorpio, de-powered and pulled out of his glass fishbowl, intact.<eos> I bet Fury's going to give me a gold star or something.<eos> What in blazes were you two doing in that room with Scorpio?<eos> - Staying on missions. Sir.<eos> - Missions?
Now if Tyrus still has contacts on the inside then, it's going to look legit. Great.<eos> Charlie's all right, it's TomTom I'm worried about.<eos> Oh, do not fret, pretty lady.<eos> Yuri Dvorak can take care of himself.<eos> That's still the plan, innit?<eos> No.<eos> Well, she's about to tell Tyrus that we found Yuri.<eos> Yes. So we need someone to play him.<eos> But don't do that accent.<eos> Why not?
Your call's been cancelled.<eos> Now, you said you had some photos of me.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I have them, they are safe.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> I saw you.<eos> You killed Kimberley!<eos> All I want is the photos, now give them to me and we can both get on with our lives.<eos> No, I saw you, you hurt her!<eos> Why?
Yes, go on, be an idiot.<eos> 'Do you really want that?<eos> 'Sorry.<eos> Come on, darling.'<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Hello.<eos> I haven't heard from you so I was wondering how you're getting on?<eos> Oh, you know, we're still working on a few things.<eos> They haven't got you beat, have they, Jack?<eos> What? As if.
I have to.<eos> I just took a bet.<eos> There's no going back on a bet.<eos> Okay, what if I bet him that my idea's better?<eos> Then can I come?<eos> You gonna pony up $10,000?<eos> Best of luck, guys.<eos> Hope it works out.<eos> So you're off the case?<eos> Yeah, thanks to Stephen Huntley.
Then go to jail and trust him.<eos> I'm guessing he's not gonna be there when you get out.<eos> Beth, even if he waits for you, he did this, and the fear of him getting caught is going to cast a shadow over every moment of the rest of your life together.<eos> He may not be able to see that, but I know you can.<eos> I'll get you the money back.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just leaving a note.<eos> By the way, congratulations.<eos> I hear you got the tape thrown out and Ava reinstated as the CEO.<eos> - In spite of you.
That's not me anymore.<eos> And I don't want to be that.<eos> Come help me tonight.<eos> - What do I wear in a boiler room?<eos> If the bookworm finds out I'm a bank robber, I'm screwed.<eos> I don't even own flats.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Zeki? - Wait a sec.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Unbelievable.
Everybody knows this is just a pit stop for you.<eos> So, whatcha thinking? FBI?<eos> CIA?<eos> Maybe get yourself a decent pay over there.<eos> Now I'm confused.<eos> Are you trying to sleep with me or get rid of me?<eos> I'm just saying I'm glad you're here for McCann's murder.<eos> Well, technically I'm on Billy's murder.<eos> And it's not making sense.<eos> Why?
I just didn't realise you'd moved on so quickly.<eos> I haven't.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> - Are you OK?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Oh, oh, please, don't hurt me.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I just sold some art.<eos> That's all I did.<eos> To Marat Milankovic.
Oh, God, it's blank.<eos> Not again.<eos> You have to believe me, I had no idea that...<eos> That's all I've got!<eos> That's what he gave...<eos> So, everything... everything's OK?<eos> We... we... we can go?<eos> Yeah, she can go.<eos> That's absolutely fine. You're staying.<eos> Why?
Wait!<eos> Make sure he will keep his mouth shut.<eos> - To whom could he tell?<eos> Everyone is gone.<eos> To his wife.<eos> - She is already in Estonia.<eos> How are you?<eos> Hurts?<eos> - It's fine.<eos> Thanks to Allah, already less.
How was your flight?<eos> Really good.<eos> Got some sleep.<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> Hey, Bax.<eos> I just got to show you this.<eos> Check this out.<eos> It's not just his room.<eos> It's a room with gadgets.<eos> Ah. Ready?
Don't let a little misunderstanding like that ruin my evening?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You'll be missin' yersel'.<eos> Great place, this.<eos> Oh, you come here often? Aye.<eos> Four maybe five times a week.<eos> They know me.<eos> The food is extraordinary.<eos> But, um, you cannae trust them.<eos> Who?
I just want to stay out of jail.<eos> We have an opportunity here to make some real change with this guy, to keep directing him towards votes that will actually help people.<eos> If we let him scare us off, things will go right back to the way they were.<eos> Come on.<eos> David never gets to slay Goliath, not in real life.<eos> I'm sick of lying to everyone.<eos> This is not who I am and you and I are done.<eos> Can I have my phone back?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah. Me too.
All right.<eos> Keep quiet and do what I tell you.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> So, who's next on your list?<eos> That's being quiet?<eos> Lucas West.<eos> 23 Crepe Myrtle Road.<eos> You miss the city, don't ya?<eos> Oh... sometimes.<eos> The energy... pace.
Keep looking, see if you can find anything else.<eos> I'm serious, Justine.<eos> Look, you should have your own gallery and studio space.<eos> Look, just... Just hear me out.<eos> Remember the vacant storefront I showed you?<eos> Right? It's still on the market.<eos> You say the word and I'll buy it for you.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Let's discuss it over dinner.<eos> Strictly business.
Um...<eos> "Um" is never good.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I want to feel the same way.<eos> I really do.<eos> And I hate that I don't.<eos> I mean, you're just such an incredible guy, and I feel so lucky to have met you, but...<eos> Something's missing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
What are they doing?<eos> Okay, sorry about that.<eos> So, one Blue Hole?<eos> Uh, well, let's see.<eos> There's three of us, so, three drinks.<eos> Yeah, well, they're generally shared, 'cause they're pretty big.<eos> Said three, dick bag.<eos> Get three!<eos> Uh-huh. I don't care for that guy.<eos> Me neither. No.
Wait, how do you know it was 5:36.<eos> The kid who played the court clerk hit the time clock - when Ashley stopped her opening statement.<eos> - Okay, so, we found her stuff in the stairwell, which says to me she was going back to her office.<eos> She was a runner.<eos> So how long would it take her to run down and back up four flights of stairs?<eos> Well, this might be something.<eos> She was assigned a high-profile prescription-drug case.<eos> - The defendant was a prominent Doctor.<eos> - What, he was selling drugs? Yeah.<eos> To the two-six gang.
He wasn't with me.<eos> - Kim.<eos> - Molly... before you say anything, I owe you an apology.<eos> I was really out of line.<eos> Oh, please, everything you said was true.<eos> I'm the one who should apologize.<eos> So I hope this check from the palm desert casino will suffice.<eos> $100,000?<eos> Yeah. Apparently, your ex won 200 grand but kept a hundred of it in his casino account, which is why we never saw the full amount on his tax returns.<eos> Unbelievable.
Yes, but... I have friends in the D.A.'s office, too.<eos> Now, Peter and Jared were never considered anything but witnesses in that assault, certainly not accomplices.<eos> Look, the probation-violation hearing is off.<eos> I'm going to be signing their reports from now on.<eos> If I have no power, what am I doing here, Stanton?<eos> My name is on the firm, too.<eos> Yes, but mine comes first.<eos> No, sir. No, he's... he's fine.<eos> I swear.<eos> Okay. You, too.
We are.<eos> I can't say the same for them, though.<eos> Paul Fitzgerald, you're under arrest.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> You're gonna leave my kid alone, though, right?<eos> No idea what you're talking about.<eos> We're not interested in your kid.<eos> That's sweet... sort of, but not necessary.<eos> I already dismissed the charges against your friend Harley.<eos> Mr. Walls.
Uh, well, maybe not, but, uh, you rich ladies certainly can be amusing. - Ah!<eos> - Let me have it.<eos> This comes straight from the Chinaman on Mott.<eos> You'll find this a little more exciting than your husband's strain, I think.<eos> When in need of more, you now know how to reach me.<eos> Show yourself out.<eos> Mister Maguire, did you get my files back?<eos> I did.<eos> And did Mister Lansing apologize for what he done to young Milo O'Hearn?<eos> Profusely.
- Come on.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Get his shoe off. I got it.<eos> Check his foot.<eos> Let's try to get that dry.<eos> Watch-- watch your elbow. - Okay. - Don't burn it.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Annie?
Okay, don't worry.<eos> We're gonna be fine.<eos> No, it's bad.<eos> Wait, Sabina.<eos> Look.<eos> Come here. Look at this.<eos> - That's where Natalie was.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Esther?<eos> Annie?
I'm not gonna leave her.<eos> I can stay and help her bury Natalie, and you guys can keep looking for Irene.<eos> ♪ (Sam) I think I might have gotten us all killed.<eos> - (Joyce) Oh, my-- - (Daniel) Johnny!<eos> - (Joyce) Oh, my God!<eos> - (Daniel) Johnny!<eos> (Esther) Annie, we've gotta go.<eos> - (Twig snaps, rustling) - Come on!<eos> Esther!<eos> Annie!
- What happened?<eos> - (Sam) She got hurt, that's what.<eos> (Esther) Did she just twist her ankle or something?<eos> No, she got a damn spike in her leg.<eos> I had no idea what had gone on, what had happened, I just saw blood everywhere, and she was in a really bad way.<eos> Oh, my God. We-- we need something.<eos> We need something. We need a first aid kit.<eos> Sam, get-- get some water.<eos> Get some, like, boiled water.<eos> Annie!
Pull your bag in.<eos> Come on. Hurry up.<eos> my God.<eos> guys!<eos> Bullets!<eos> They're shooting at us!<eos> go!<eos> Move!<eos> Go!<eos> Annie!
Bullets!<eos> They're shooting at us!<eos> go!<eos> Move!<eos> Go!<eos> Annie!<eos> come on!<eos> stop! - Annie!<eos> Stop!<eos> Annie!
Now, Charlie, you got a supplier without a face.<eos> Mikey, you got a guy who needs heroin.<eos> Did you miss the part where I can't actually find Odin?<eos> I mean, come on, Charlie, he's not going to show his face for some junkie on the street.<eos> You want Bello to reach out.<eos> Now that's the kind of guy that Odin would show his face for.<eos> But he gets his stuff from the Caza Cartel, all right?<eos> He is not going to want them knowing he's looking for a new supplier.<eos> That's why he's going to use a middle man when he approaches Odin.<eos> Me.
We have to have each other's backs.<eos> Suppose one of us actually did, you know, become addicted.<eos> They'd pull us out.<eos> Go to treatment.<eos> And our cases?<eos> I mean, all our old cases, they'd just... they'd be reopened.<eos> That's huge.<eos> Look, you need to be able to trust who you're in the field with.<eos> And an addict can never be trusted.<eos> Thanks, everybody.
I'm so sorry to bother you so late.<eos> Please. I needed a break from this wedding.<eos> This feels like a problem I can fix.<eos> I find it hard to believe there's a wedding problem that you can't fix. Wait.<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Nikki's mom, who's a lovely person, but doesn't have much to contribute... which is fine... was really pushing for all these over-the-top things.<eos> And I... I said no, and she flipped out.<eos> But up until a week ago, this was what they wanted... a simple wedding in a church basement.<eos> And all of a sudden, her mom wants this, uh... Cinderella fantasy for a six-year-old.<eos> Why?
I'll bury you.<eos> There's just one question to ask.<eos> "You're mine now."<eos> How did we get here?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Wait.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> Tell us what?<eos> Hi, you guys!
Spencer.<eos> You let me believe that you were dead?<eos> What we had was real.<eos> I've been pretending to work with Mona so I could keep you safe.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> It can be hard to know who to trust, but you can't fool your friends, and the girls were on to Spencer.<eos> We don't know what happened at Radley, but Spencer went in there at rock bottom, and then she came out like a shiny new penny.<eos> Mona asked Spencer to join the A-team the night of the masquerade ball.<eos> Did Spencer finally take her up on it?<eos> Yeah, but why now?
Oh, right.<eos> Kris.<eos> Hi.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> There's something that you need to know, and...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> No... no, I'm not all right, because, see, I swore that I wouldn't tell anyone, but if something happened to him...<eos> If something happened to who?<eos> To Rusty.
♪ now I need a place to hide away ♪<eos> ♪ oh, I believe ♪ in yesterday<eos> I don't think we've ever spent two weeks on an assignment, Mr. Shue.<eos> Hey, the Beatles are so epic that we need two weeks to do them justice.<eos> This week is all about the early years of the Beatles, when all they had was a belief in each other and a belief that together they could do anything.<eos> The school year seems like it's never ending, and now we're wasting two whole weeks on a band from the 1940s?<eos> Seriously, can anyone still relate to the Beatles?<eos> Pretty much the entire world.<eos> Yeah, I can definitely still relate.<eos> Why?
Happy Birthday to me.<eos> Could you do it?<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Can't be helped.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Happy Birthday to me.<eos> - Kin.<eos> - Sorry, but do this.<eos> - Huh? Why?
Wait there, wait there.<eos> OK, open.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Is this where Patrick Bateman lives?<eos> No, this is our new flat.<eos> The lease isn't up on ours yet.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm just going to pay for both for a while.<eos> Why?
Yaniv, no!<eos> Yaniv, stop!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Tell him to go.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Don't spoil it, Jakob.<eos> We have to remember something good.<eos> You're right.<eos> Everything matters.<eos> Cassie...
Sometimes, yes.<eos> How can you tie any of this to Connor McClane?<eos> I can't.<eos> So, Mr. Cutler...<eos> No one forced me to do it.<eos> But when the head of the Academy pulls you aside and says, "you're special.<eos> "You've got the goods, but it's real competitive out there,<eos> "and we've got something that's just gonna help you stay at the top of your game."<eos> And you know they're only offering this to the best of the best.<eos> You.

No.<eos> I'm giving you the keys to the kingdom.<eos> Look, if V3 is gonna survive, it's gonna be under the leadership of someone with vision, someone with integrity...<eos> Someone like you, Abby.<eos> I always liked the view from your office.<eos> Here we go!<eos> The New Jersey Bobcats and the New York Hawks renewing their storied rivalry, and there's extra juice today as Terrence King and Pat Purnell face off against their former team.<eos> Spread left.<eos> 4-27 Cadillac on "one."<eos> Ready? Break!
I care about Crabchek.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> You want me to beg for absolution?<eos> Is that it?<eos> All right.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> Santino, please, forgive me, for I have sinned.<eos> I'm not your priest, Connor.<eos> Then, what do you want from me?<eos> Justice.
Good.<eos> Now hand me that toothpick and you and Dean and Tracy -- you beat feet out of here.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going in there alone.<eos> I'll buy you as much time as I can.<eos> Irv, that's death.<eos> Yeah, well, it's what I got coming.<eos> It's my fault, Sam.<eos> I was in some dive and I was sloppy and lonely and I met some girl, and the next thing you know, I'm strapped to some bed and she's twisting things that ain't supposed to be twisted.<eos> "She" who?
I know what you're doing.<eos> You're stalling.<eos> You're stalling.<eos> Guess what.<eos> I'm not offended. I get it.<eos> I understand it.<eos> Tell you what. I'll throw a couple more benjies at you.<eos> Maybe you'll buy yourself a new suit.<eos> Looks like you could use one, right?<eos> You, too.
You're going to let him go, him and his friends. You understand?<eos> Ricardo, no.<eos> I can't.<eos> Listen, you don't understand.<eos> These guys can pin a murder on me.<eos> I have to handle it. Don't worry, Nando.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Chacho, you know who I am?<eos> What I can do? To your familia?<eos> To you?
You're afraid that if I'm right about Arthur being corrupt, you might not know the man you sleep next too as well as you thought.<eos> There's a six month gap in Auggie Anderson's CIA service record, right around the time he opened that account for Arthur in Colombia.<eos> Just keep yourself covered.<eos> The sun can be very dangerous if you're not protected.<eos> That wasn't the story we agreed on.<eos> If Henry is gonna play games, I'm gonna play back.<eos> But you're used to rules.<eos> His game doesn't have any.<eos> He'll use anything against you.<eos> Or you.
Two agents in the field together.<eos> No secrets.<eos> Just like you want us to be.<eos> You already had that... with someone else.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then what happened?<eos> Then Teo Braga happened.<eos> He supplied us with intel-- bad intel-- that got Helen killed right before my eyes.<eos> So, now you see why I cannot completely put my faith in Teo Braga.<eos> - Or me?
Your replacement is on his way up here.<eos> Someone who has proven himself to have the integrity it's gonna take to make some overdue changes around here.<eos> I'm sure you'll agree, Joan.<eos> You've made your point, Eric.<eos> You can leave now.<eos> Henry did this.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Auggie's already taken the hit.<eos> From now on, we trust no one but ourselves.<eos> No one.
But you signed off for what?<eos> To cover your clearance stats?<eos> I signed off because I trusted you, you sociopath son of a bitch!<eos> Should have cuffed you to a car.<eos> Let the river eels gnaw your ass.<eos> You'll suffer for it, no matter. This-- this mars you.<eos> But, hey, we can survive it.<eos> We just need a course correction.<eos> First-- first you gotta back Dani off Of Damon Callis for the murder of Billy Hobson.<eos> What for?
Never mind the bug.<eos> Where are the spaghetti witnesses?<eos> - We cut them loose.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why would we hold on to them?<eos> - 'Cause I asked you to.<eos> "Give me an hour." That's what I said.<eos> I didn't hear you. You mumbled.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why?
Is it Popeye?<eos> No. It's not Popeye. But you'd know him.<eos> Now, this guy, who is not Popeye, wants something that I have.<eos> Now, I'm happy to give it to him, but I want to be compensated.<eos> It's a transaction.<eos> So transact.<eos> There a hitch?<eos> The guy's the hitch.<eos> He's not famous for being reasonable, and he seems to resent the fact that I've invited him to do this business.<eos> Why?
This right here!<eos> With my highest regards!<eos> We should go now.<eos> Just give me a sec. Give me a sec.<eos> I-I-I need a sec. I got to...<eos> I got to take this in.<eos> Did you see? !<eos> Did you see their faces? !<eos> That's the look I'm talking about, when they see the cards laid down on the table!<eos> 'Cause of you.
Those bees are pets.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Well, then, if we all agree...<eos> Dangerous pets... now, if I trespass on your property and you have a tiger, that's still a violation<eos> - Come on! Bees can hardly be compared to tigers.<eos> Well, tell that to the two high-school sophomores - who had to spend the night in the hospital.<eos> - Okay! Getting a little contentious up in here.<eos> Let's call it a day, and we'll hear closing arguments tomorrow.<eos> Hey, heads up... just so you guys know, if you lose, the teens' families are bringing civil suit for their medical bills, pain and suffering, and criminal charges.<eos> Sorry, guys.
- Where did Julia collapse? - Outside.<eos> Past the shoes and knots.<eos> We said if this thing entered one of us, we would kill whoever that was!<eos> - But not Julia!<eos> - I will not let her live... with what I had to live with. Ian! Please!<eos> She's our baby!<eos> I know what happened to you when you were young ... but there is always another way.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't know what this thing did to my family.<eos> To my brother, to my sister my mother, my father!
Quite the cocktail that Doctor cooked up.<eos> Lauren...<eos> and we're back together...<eos> She got me a really pretty necklace.<eos> It really was just a break.<eos> If you don't stop gushing, I swear I'll slit my own bloody throat.<eos> Wait, yeah! I'm pissed at you for making me join the Dark.<eos> They're gross and they took Lauren and the moon will be up soon.<eos> You really need to tell me how you and Sir Smokes-a-lot tricked me so I can un-join them...<eos> Me!
Tell your boss to be a little less paranoid.<eos> His buyer is here, Teo Braga.<eos> Make the call.<eos> How did you know I was here?<eos> How did you know I needed your help?<eos> Auggie called me.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We have Coke, Sprite,<eos> - or Almdudler.
You're laughing a lot?<eos> It's damn funny.<eos> No, it's not funny. Let these perverts do whatever they want.<eos> You're not going to be a part of it. - l didn't say anything..<eos> She goes for jogging every evening.<eos> Wearing shorts.. Wonderful.<eos> Guys. Guys, come on.<eos> - Oh my God.<eos> I want to go forjogging everyday.. .. but who will wake up early during vacation?<eos> Hello, stud.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, ma'am. I'm okay.<eos> If you're facing problem, I'll do it.<eos> No, I'll manage.<eos> Don't..<eos> By the way, you live alone in this giant house? Yes.<eos> My uncle did some charity.<eos> - Okay. What do your parents do?<eos> Actually my mom is no more.<eos> Oh, sorry.
You cheated.<eos> All is fair in love and war.<eos> Neither love nor war is going on here.<eos> It's only stupidity which doesn't suit your age.<eos> Sahil.<eos> Sahil.<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen.<eos> Hi, stud.
How could you even touch her?<eos> Go and ask her.<eos> She dances around me all the time.<eos> It's fine for her.<eos> Yes, because she's not my boyfriend.<eos> I'm sick and tired of this.<eos> What happened?<eos> is everything fine? How is your play going on?<eos> Uncle, she removed me from it.<eos> Why?
You're innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> Take the stand.<eos> Any juror that hears you will have that doubt.<eos> She opens that door, the first question Cameron asks is, did she try and bribe those witnesses?<eos> The answer is yes.<eos> There goes reasonable doubt.<eos> How much did you pay him?<eos> - Cameron. - Pay who?<eos> Don't play dumb.<eos> Clifford Danner.
Mr. Dirkson, I believe congratulations are in order.<eos> Yeah, we closed this afternoon.<eos> Your friends at Lambrex had me send a little something up to your room.<eos> Oh, nice.
Yeah, we got a couple of hits on some heat signatures.<eos> My best guess would be about a dozen other bodies.<eos> Well, that's less than I thought.<eos> Annie, you don't have to go in there.<eos> You are well within your rights to tell Arthur it's not worth the risk.<eos> Auggie, like I said before,<eos> I'm going in with the best team around.<eos> Who?<eos> The sheriff.<eos> Annie?
Not talking.<eos> My name's David Whitehead.<eos> Yeah, I know who you are.<eos> I grew up in Southcliffe.<eos> I'm... I'm a friend...<eos> I was a friend of Stephen's.<eos> Didn't know he had any real friends.<eos> Look, I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah. I used to, er... I used to see you around then sometimes, didn't I?<eos> Me?
Is that Italy?<eos> She wanted to see if the Pope really existed.<eos> Here's a better one.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lucy went to sleep.<eos> That's right, sweetheart.<eos> She did.<eos> Uncle Paul said she won't wake up.<eos> We just best let her sleep, eh?<eos> Like Gramps?
She wanted to see if the Pope really existed.<eos> Here's a better one.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lucy went to sleep.<eos> That's right, sweetheart.<eos> She did.<eos> Uncle Paul said she won't wake up.<eos> We just best let her sleep, eh?<eos> Like Gramps?<eos> Just like Gramps.
I should have just said I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Come home.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Annie.<eos> It's too late for heart-to-hearts.<eos> - No, Annie--<eos> - Good-bye, Auggie.<eos> Annie!<eos> Annie!
What is the matter with you?<eos> Don't scan my testicles ever again.<eos> Copy that.<eos> What does she look like?<eos> What do you want her to look like?<eos> Brown eyes, soulful.<eos> Height?<eos> Average height. I like brunettes.<eos> Would you date anyone in your profession or would you prefer to date someone outside of it?<eos> Sure, either way.
Sir? Can you tie my shoe, please?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you happily married?<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I want a new dad.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> Yeah, sorry.
I guess that's the difference between Marcel and me.<eos> Looking for something?<eos> I figured with you vacating, the attic would be a safe zone.<eos> Found this there.<eos> It was dangerous for you to come back, Josh.<eos> Well, what are friends for, or whatever?<eos> Hey, what did Hayley want?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?
You're a witch.<eos> Do a locator spell, locate the dagger, locate Elijah.<eos> I can't use magic.<eos> It's punishable by death.<eos> Marcel's rules.<eos> Marcel?<eos> What do you think I'm going to do to you if you don't give me what I want?<eos> Not much.<eos> I've been linked, so anything you do to me, you do to Hayley.<eos> Who?
I can't let you run yourself down like this.<eos> Right now all you can think about is morphine.<eos> You have to realize there's so much more to you than just morphine.<eos> You're a doctor.<eos> You scored 15 fives in the state exam.<eos> And you have passions, you like to write.<eos> You feel such a release.<eos> When I think of my novel, well, it's not really a novel.<eos> But when I talking about my play...<eos> Play?
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Now he's talking directly to Jesus.<eos> Where-- where did you come from?<eos> The church keeps an extension ladder for tree trimming.<eos> Don't look down. Bad place for the spins.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Good thing I ignored your request to stay away, huh?<eos> Guess I just felt obliged to keep an eye on you.<eos> Yeah. Why?
Definitely.<eos> And he's scared too, and not just of us.<eos> Four years he's been coaching Idaris John.<eos> What do you got to pay a doctor to betray his oath like that?<eos> Good question.<eos> We'll definitely check his finances.<eos> What's up?<eos> - You still at Bruckmann's office?<eos> - We're just leaving now.<eos> Why?
I gotta get to class.<eos> They're gonna expel me, Cole!<eos> Please.<eos> I need you to speak for me today.<eos> I'm already speaking at the hearing.<eos> Gloria Crane called me.<eos> Archie's speaking too.<eos> Shocking.<eos> Maybe we'll just have to show everyone this interview.<eos> - The board, Archie.
Will do.<eos> Chocolate peanut caramel explosion?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> Ugh, redo it.<eos> - Pour vous.<eos> - Merci beaucoup.<eos> Et possiblement pour moi.<eos> The Red Square.<eos> When I went to pick up the check, the Hollands offered to sell it to me for 25% of the appraised value.<eos> Why?
Have you experienced any tingling or numbness in your legs or feet?<eos> Uh, yeah, my feet have been a little numb, but they get that way when my shoes are on too tight.<eos> Right. Are they numb now? Uh, yeah.<eos> I guess they are.<eos> I want to check your reflexes.<eos> Have a seat up here.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, your response is normal.<eos> I want to do a C.T.<eos> Why?
Your new staff is going to know your recipes before you know it.<eos> It just takes time to develop a team that you trust.<eos> I guess I'll find out if my instincts apply to people or just to candy.<eos> Okay, now that's too much. See?<eos> Was that hard?<eos> No.<eos> I loved it.<eos> So if I love bossing you around, why am I so anxious?<eos> Well, maybe you're apprehensive about sharing your space.<eos> My kitchen? Huh.
Alfio...<eos> Did you understand?<eos> -No...<eos> The messiah... has got a secret...<eos> He knows what he wants... do you know what you want?<eos> -Hit the circle.<eos> Nooo!<eos> I told you the 20!<eos> That slice there!<eos> Why?
I love that idiot.<eos> -I don't believe that...<eos> See, Paolo, this is your problem...<eos> other people's feelings don't matter to you...<eos> My problem is that the woman who should be with me is instead with a....<eos> With a subnormal!<eos> Subnormal?<eos> -Yes!<eos> Tell me why he is a subnormal now?<eos> -Why?
I told Cora I wouldn't leave.<eos> I'll help the others when I figure out how to help her.<eos> There's no time!<eos> The full moon's coming.<eos> The sheriff and Melissa are gonna be dead, so I'm gonna try and help them.<eos> You can sit here and perfect the art of doing nothing.<eos> I wouldn't take it personally.<eos> Anger is just a tool.<eos> He's using it to excuse shifting allegiance from one Alpha to another.<eos> From you to Scott.
So Mr Cameron's porn filter is just going to stop us looking at things that are orange?<eos> Yeah, David Dickinson's had it. He's gone!<eos> I think it's a bit more sophisticated than that.<eos> I think it looks for words and things as well.<eos> On search engines.<eos> Certain words?<eos> Obviously.<eos> Volvo.<eos> They've had it.<eos> Why?
202...201...<eos> Plot 200 is vacant, which means I don't have to stay in it. Yes!<eos> So, there we are.<eos> After the most exhaustive caravan test in all of history, we have established that 10,500 people are just plain wrong.<eos> The Volkswagen Tiguan is NOT the best tow car.<eos> Oh, is that James?<eos> No way!<eos> Plot 200, James, it's all yours!<eos> Where's the...? ! I claim the moral victory.<eos> Why a moral victory?
No.<eos> No bars. No bars.<eos> Just give me one bar.<eos> Give me some cars.<eos> Please give me bars!<eos> Any service yet?<eos> We should get a signal in about a mile.<eos> Okay.<eos> They just let it rot.<eos> Our house.
I'm gonna give the interns the rest of the night off.<eos> Can you give me a hand if there's anything they drop?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm so sorry about Heather.<eos> Yeah. Dr. Hunt, Lydia's desatting, decreased breath sounds on the left.<eos> - Wha...<eos> - Sharpie lady.<eos> Should I throw in a chest tube?<eos> Dr. Yang is gonna take over that case.<eos> Why?
I can't page someone 9-1-1 without the name of the patient...<eos> When Dr. Torres calls in, she'll expect to know who...<eos> No, there's no patient.<eos> Just page her.<eos> We can't page 9-1-1 without a patient emergency.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Does it look like this is not an emergency?<eos> Hey, hey! What's going on? What's going on?<eos> - I need you to page Callie 9-1-1.<eos> - Why?
What do you say, boys?<eos> Feeling Swiss?<eos> You think you can pull that off?<eos> Them coming down here would show some respect, humility.<eos> Qualities famously lacking in both Jack Dragna and Mickey Cohen.<eos> I can't speak for Dragna, but Mickey might surprise you.<eos> There's more to him than meets the eye.<eos> You wouldn't think it, but Mickey Cohen can actually be a very reasonable man.<eos> You garlic-eating son of a bitch!<eos> Here.
It's weird to think that everyone on this street, everyone in this city, soon they're going to want to know:<eos> Who is Ezra Kleinfelter?<eos> What kind of man puts his country's secrets out there for anybody to read?<eos> Buddy?<eos> We're here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Got distracted. Uh-huh.<eos> Sorry, sir.
Too clean.<eos> I didn't even register the traces of fruits and herbs that Mr. Blackburn claimed.<eos> Well, is it possible sir that he swapped the bottles out<eos> - before handing it over?<eos> - I considered that as well, but Dr. Grace didn't find any stimulants in Mr. Fenton.<eos> So why swap the bottles if there was nothing in them<eos> - to begin with?<eos> - Sirs, I wonder if that young lady that gave Mr. Fenton a kiss before the race can be of help?<eos> I am... was, Joe Fenton's sweetheart.<eos> Terribly sorry.
Officer downstairs let me up.<eos> You don't want to shoot the messenger.<eos> Someone left their Bible and a dowel outside my hotel door with that inside.<eos> Instructions to come here.<eos> Quote from Dante's Inferno.<eos> Inscribed on the Gates of Hell.<eos> The King said, "Bring me a sword.<eos> "Divide the child in two.<eos> "Give half to one and half to the other."<eos> By this wisdom...
Meet his brother-- Matthew Tarland.<eos> I pulled a print off the trigger remote that was used in the bomb to kill Tate.<eos> Got a hit in AFIS.<eos> It turns out that his brother there, Matthew, was busted a couple of years ago for solicitation.<eos> There's no way this dude's gonna roll over on his own flesh and blood.<eos> All we have him on right now is driving around the block, and he knows it.<eos> I just... I just don't see he and his brother going to all this trouble without wanting the world to know what Tate did to them, why Tate had to be punished.<eos> Why we all had to be punished, for that matter.<eos> Mm-hmm. No, he wants to confess.<eos> Just not to us.
I just wish we could take the money, you know, put it in a trust for that poor kid.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> Well, kids are resilient.<eos> Maybe he'll be all right.<eos> What about you?<eos> You gonna be all right?<eos> Time heals all, right?<eos> I guess we'll find out if that's true.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> You, too.
I am really enjoying this place.<eos> Plentiful food. Good water pressure.<eos> Things I never even considered before.<eos> There really is a lot to being human, isn't there?<eos> It ain't all just burritos and strippers, my friend. Yeah.<eos> I understand what you're saying.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes, there's more to humanity than survival.<eos> look for purpose, and you must not be defeated by anger or despair.<eos> Or hedonism, for that matter.
I'll do my best. You'll do great.<eos> All right, Felix.<eos> Pleasant dreams.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, babe!<eos> I missed you this morning.<eos> I feel like it's been forever since you were here when I woke up.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> - I had to leave early.<eos> - Why?
So you walk away from both those accidents, which is remarkable, and yet you go cycling in 2008, bump into a Nissan Torino, I believe.<eos> It won, mate, it won.<eos> It won. And you broke your leg?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shoulder...<eos> Because this is what I think we need to impress upon children watching.<eos> Don't get a bicycle.<eos> Because they're dangerous.<eos> Now obviously, you've, as we said in the introduction, handed notice in.<eos> Why?
Which means they're not gonna buy it.<eos> They're gonna steal it.<eos> Hey, Elizabeth Burke.<eos> Bearing gifts in a brown paper bag.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> Oh, it's just his lunch.<eos> He forgot it this morning.<eos> Why aren't you in there?<eos> Uh, scratched off the need to know list.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Now you see it, now you don't.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Thing I can't talk about? It's going down.<eos> - You must follow him.<eos> - Look, I am not following him. I'm not following my husband.<eos> He's never given me reason not to trust him.<eos> - Until now.<eos> - Mozzie.<eos> You can trust truffles harvested in the Perigord region, bed linens handwoven in Madeira, and, for the most part, a Teddy bear named Mozart.<eos> But people?
Just some records I found, some books.<eos> I thought you'd like them.<eos> Like them?<eos> Like? They scare me.<eos> They show up at the door and they ruin my day.<eos> They take me hostage, Frank.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Yeah, I was at the pool today.<eos> I hide them from John.<eos> From my husband.
Hi.<eos> So, why won't your client get in the same room with me?<eos> Well, theoretically, it's impossible since he has a restraining order on you.<eos> Then I want you to give him a message.<eos> Will you tell him that I am ready to settle this thing once and for all?<eos> And we can negotiate the terms for what will be our final confrontation.<eos> I'll let him know. - Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> - And you, too.
I thought that was Est-evez.<eos> "Est-evez"?<eos> Estevez... Emilio.<eos> Estevez.<eos> Oh, well, then it seems that this 30-year-old war has been nothing but a misunderstanding.<eos> Yeah, maybe you guys should just shake hands and make up right here, huh? Well, uh...<eos> There you go.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Maybe a drink or...<eos> Oh, no, no, no. I... I...
The key's inside as well.<eos> What's the gold for, Hagen?<eos> Why's that matter to you?<eos> Because I can tell when I've stepped into a trap.<eos> You lied about having a debt to pay.<eos> I think the gold was used to bribe the federal prosecutor on Peter's case.<eos> Well, if that's true, that would be very kind of me.<eos> You gave me a target with only one approach in the time provided-- through the travel agency.<eos> You figured out what I want yet?<eos> Me.
No, I know what it is.<eos> Why is it here?<eos> Since Rick got back from his trip, I've been bummed that he gets to have all the fun.<eos> And then I realized we can still have fun.<eos> We just gotta scale it back.<eos> That's why they sell used RVS wow.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I got us an rv - what's the problem?<eos> - Us?<eos> - Yeah.
Do I miss how we say "good night"<eos> to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?<eos> Okay, I get it, I get it.<eos> You are an emotionless robot.<eos> Well, I try.<eos> All right, let's just get this stupid game over with.<eos> Great. I'll go first.<eos> Okay.<eos> By the way, how are you with zippers?<eos> Why?
Once a day, they clean these cages. Once a day.<eos> Okay. A biscuit. Just one biscuit.<eos> I just see here, this mess smells. I need a Raquel Welch poster and a rock hammer.<eos> I'm shaking the fence, boss, still shaking the fence.<eos> - MALE DOG 1: Over here. - MALE DOG 2:<eos> Any luck? (SIGHS)<eos> Hardly.<eos> I'm not getting any clues, just a bunch of complaints.<eos> Hey, pretty-boy. Over here.<eos> Yeah, sorry, pal.
I can't help it, okay?<eos> Just when I think she's gone, she just sneaks right back in.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> Do your work. Pervert.<eos> I am getting emails about you 24/7.<eos> Getting a lot of buzz.<eos> I'm so proud.<eos> Wait, hold on. Let me give us some privacy.<eos> Stuart and his shitty curtains.<eos> Sexy.
- Ten?<eos> - You don't know?<eos> He's no longer with me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, he's not dead.<eos> He's in Brooklyn.<eos> There's that matter of opinion again.<eos> Rain's over.<eos> I've been meaning to send him something.<eos> - Who?
- You don't know?<eos> He's no longer with me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, he's not dead.<eos> He's in Brooklyn.<eos> There's that matter of opinion again.<eos> Rain's over.<eos> I've been meaning to send him something.<eos> - Who?<eos> - My son.
No more than I am for... Wanting to stay.<eos> Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but go home.<eos> - I've seriously got this covered.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm just trying to help you.<eos> - What's the big deal? - First you love me, then you hate me, now you love me again?<eos> - Well... I can't keep up.<eos> - I never loved you.<eos> I never hated you, I'm just trying to help out a brother.<eos> In-law.
There you were, mixing a drink behind the bar.<eos> And I...<eos> I don't know, I just had this feeling.<eos> It was... Like a wave crashing over my head, and I knew.<eos> It's the only time that's ever happened to me in my entire life.<eos> It took... all my strength not to just walk over to you and ask you to marry me right then and there.<eos> You never told me that.<eos> I-I... didn't want you to think I was a freak.<eos> Well, you are my freak, and I like it.<eos> Me, too.
Isn't there some kind of rule about writing in library books?<eos> (laughs): I won't tell, if you don't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, what's it about?<eos> I don't want to spoil it for you, so you'll just have to read it yourself.<eos> Deal.<eos> ♪ Thank you, Ingrid, for all of your help.<eos> This would be taking so much longer without you.<eos> - Even for Super Speed Reader Guy?<eos> - Yes, even for him. (laughs)
Just give me five minutes.<eos> Soon...<eos> Dash, hey. I, uh... I got here a little early...<eos> I'll just see you when you get here.<eos> Mrs. Gardiner?<eos> Amy.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm supposed to be meeting Dash.<eos> I really don't think you should touch that.<eos> Why?
When Minnelli was chief of the CBI, he struck a deal with F.B.I. Director Schultz.<eos> What did Schultz want?<eos> She wanted reports. On you.<eos> Minnelli provided them.<eos> When Minnelli retired, that became a part of my job.<eos> But the intel wasn't exactly going to the F.B.I.<eos> I found out that Schultz was passing it on to Homeland Security.<eos> Bob Kirkland?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?
What I'm looking for is an open and honest dialogue.<eos> 100% transparency.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Maybe not yet.<eos> But... that room in your basement.<eos> Come on.<eos> You are a depraved man. At minimum, a pedophile.<eos> But frankly, that's not why we're here.<eos> Why then?
Don't have to.<eos> All you have to do is pull the messages off the White House server and hand 'em over.<eos> I wouldn't even know how to do that.<eos> Because it's gotta be a lot like using a bit torrent to illegally download movies, right?<eos> I'm impressed with your wide range of tastes, by the way, from French new wave to "America's sluttiest moms"?<eos> Bet the White House would love to know how much of your government-issued hard drive is dedicated to that.<eos> We good with Ethan, the IMs?<eos> I scared him straight.<eos> We're good.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
Bea?<eos> You should know, I'm used to being an only child.<eos> Patrick and Keith-- that's his real name-- met on Santorini.<eos> People said they could pass for brothers.<eos> When Patrick decided to come home, Keith offered to come with him.<eos> He took Patrick hostage, read his journals.<eos> That man stole his life.<eos> And now he's got it back again.<eos> - Thanks to you.<eos> - Thanks to us.
Escaping.<eos> Today.<eos> Don't look.<eos> - Where are we gonna go?<eos> - Canada.<eos> We need to get far away.<eos> Their people are everywhere.<eos> The FBI. The Secret Service.<eos> We can't trust anyone.<eos> Only each other.
I've fine daughters...<eos> Thank you.<eos> ..thank goodness, four of them found husbands, even poor Mary, who I was always worried about, she takes after my husband's side when it comes to looks!<eos> Mother, please...<eos> I heard footsteps, Lizzy, on the gravel, all through the night!<eos> It was only the constables, all is well.<eos> It doesn't seem well to me.<eos> Oh... Oh, my heart.<eos> No-one cares about my poor nerves, I always suffer in silence.<eos> Oh, thank goodness! Thank goodness!
Are you sure you like this girl?<eos> Would I be going to all this trouble if I didn't? (Scoffs)<eos> Now this is the important part:<eos> When the horn goes off after the first period, that's when you need to tell her you just... You can't do this.<eos> You just got a text from your ex-girlfriend.<eos> I don't have an ex-girlfriend.<eos> And we're still pretending.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - Riley.<eos> No! My ex-girlfriend.
Victoria, there you are.<eos> While I applaud your go-getter attitude, one of the track lights has been up for ten minutes.<eos> I'll finish up with this sale.<eos> Sheila, can we have a word for a moment?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was going to do this later, but I received a curious phone call this morning from a friend of mine-- Jordan Sawyer.<eos> Does that name ring a bell?<eos> Why?
!<eos> Where is he?<eos> !<eos> Emma, are you all right?<eos> Remember what I told you.<eos> That map will show you where Henry is... only when you stop denying who you really are.<eos> I'll make sure to send Henry your regards.<eos> She's coming!<eos> The Queen!<eos> Ready?
That's why I have to get him out of Haven before this thing gets him killed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you finally get it, Nathan?<eos> Do you think that I revealed myself in front of a stranger and fought that thing off for you?<eos> I didn't know whether it was gonna kill me, and when it didn't, I was almost sorry.<eos> I can't touch anything.<eos> I don't want to live like this anymore.<eos> You have to do what you promised.<eos> You have to end the troubles.<eos> Ready?
You're not dead.<eos> You're very much alive.<eos> [ Echoing ] You're very much alive.<eos> But this place, these people --<eos> They're -- they're not real?<eos> [ Echoing] They're not real? No.<eos> Fine. Fine, I --<eos> I believe you.<eos> But Rhonda, she's real. Sorry.<eos> No.
It was a position of respect.<eos> - Watch over the employees.<eos> - Make sure nobody steals.<eos> There were many responsibilities.<eos> And they all depended on loyalty, didn't they?<eos> Loyalty and honesty.<eos> - You pride yourself on that.<eos> - I strive. You strive.<eos> You strive. Did you even tell your wife?<eos> - Your sons?
Did you used to do that?<eos> Sure I did.<eos> Any PC worth his salt has got to give the troops a little show of force now and again.<eos> Whether they like it or not.<eos> Whether he likes it or not.<eos> So it's kind of like when the principal decides to sit in on class?<eos> It kind of felt that way, Jack.<eos> But, as a great New Yorker famously said, 80% of life is just showing up.<eos> I want in, Sarge.<eos> Why?
That's what Lacy calls it.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Yeah, you and me both.<eos> Uh, no offense, but I'm gonna have to decline the invitation.<eos> Okay, look, it doesn't matter what it's called.<eos> We're all here to talk.<eos> And find out some things.<eos> I'm happy to talk, but I don't need whatever this is.<eos> Yes, but we're all here now, so just give it, like, a few minutes.<eos> Why?
And your neurosurgeon wouldn't have found it on either your pre or post-operative craniotomy MRIs because it is too low on your neck.<eos> Right.<eos> Dr. Lawson, I'm about ready for the translaminar corticosteroid injection.<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> Hopefully this will reduce the nerve route inflammation.<eos> Although, it's possible you may need another.<eos> It's possible I'll need surgery too.<eos> We'll have to see how I feel after the injection.<eos> Hank, I owe you an apology.<eos> Why?
Why not?<eos> Hey there.<eos> I'm Leo.<eos> I work with the police.<eos> Can you tell me what these are?<eos> Kay she na no.<eos> Kay she...<eos> Kay she na no?<eos> Kay she na no.<eos> Us.
With a focus on the American Revolutionary War.<eos> That's got to be embarrassing.<eos> You know, teaching a course about how we kicked your ass.<eos> We?<eos> I didn't realize you were there.<eos> No.<eos> But I was 101st Airborne in Iraq.<eos> What war did you fight in, Professor?<eos> One that I pray is never doomed to repeat itself, sir.<eos> Abbie? Hey.
How?<eos> She's already dead.<eos> She can only be made whole during the blood moon.<eos> We must find her before she completes her resurrection and return her to the ashes from whence she came.<eos> Meaning we burn her to the ground.<eos> Oh, with great enthusiasm.<eos> Jolly good.<eos> Let's set her aflame and bury her bones where she'll never find them.<eos> The tunnels.<eos> Of course.
Yeah, well, this here -- it's optical amplification.<eos> Now, I think -- well, I'm most likely dead-on -- that the tesseratic energy excites plasma with an inverse population of energy levels.<eos> A laser.<eos> A ray of... pure energy -- two terajoules.<eos> See the ampliphier?<eos> We're lucky the drones didn't trigger it while we were taking electromagnetic readings.<eos> This is a weapon, powerful enough to --<eos> Enough to melt through 50 feet of solid rock to bury itself.<eos> Imagine what it could do to a person.<eos> Yeah, or an airplane.
No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're not, okay?<eos> You aren't.<eos> You aren't.<eos> As Weaver's emotional walls tumbled,<eos> I knew I could never write his story.<eos> For what it's worth, dad, I really did like Deb.<eos> I'm sorry it didn't work out.<eos> Me, too.
Impala rear quarters are hard to come by, so I understand why you'd use a Caprice.<eos> Did not use a Caprice.<eos> I have a second series.<eos> 1962 Impala SS409.<eos> It's all original, but... I need a new bright dip on the grille.<eos> Oh, there was something else.<eos> Uh, your brother...<eos> He wanted me to deliver a message to you.<eos> He said he couldn't tell you over the phone.<eos> 91-J.
Okay, so, you don't like what happened.<eos> Actually, I don't like it, either.<eos> It didn't "happen." You did it.<eos> But what I like even less is some putz thinking he can play me with impunity!<eos> Now, about this prosecutor Drew Stafford...<eos> What do we got on him?<eos> Why is this dog hanging around here, man?<eos> 'Cause it's my garage and I like him.<eos> The message from Omar...<eos> 91-J.
There he is, my hero.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Let's just say I gave her what she wanted.<eos> Thank you, Charlie.<eos> And for service beyond the call of duty,<eos> I bought you a little gift.<eos> You might wanna keep that. In fact, you might wanna drink that on your upcoming cruise to the Isle of Lesbos.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Turns out she wants you.<eos> - Me?
Well, I guess we'll just have to keep practicing.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, what happened to you at the diner?<eos> I turned around to take your order, and you were just gone.<eos> Long story.<eos> Um, have you seen Timmy?<eos> No, not yet, but he should be here any minute for his guitar lesson.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna cancel that.<eos> What?
Your Honor, I had no idea.<eos> Even if that's true, your bosses sure did.<eos> And by creating a fake environmental group, this man deliberately made our legitimate claims ring false.<eos> I'll be reporting Mr. Trent and Ivar Oil to the D.A.'s Office.<eos> But since the Clean Water Defenders is not an appropriate plaintiff, I'll be forced to dismiss... unless I can find a substitute.<eos> - Can you?<eos> - I'm gonna try.<eos> Hey, boss. How'd it go?<eos> Unless we can find someone to legally bring the suit, we're gonna lose.<eos> Jakob...
We had to give him the original.<eos> But without that glass, he'll never know the secret.<eos> - We can turn the tables.<eos> - So what's the plan?<eos> Leverage the decoder for the evidence tape.<eos> - Then you'll be free.<eos> - Or not. Depends on Peter.<eos> - Yeah, Caffrey?<eos> - You heard from Peter?<eos> Not since yesterday.
I don't know.<eos> I think you might have grounds for a civil suit against the city.<eos> I'm not the litigious type. So I don't see that happening.<eos> Innocent, but wants to stay in jail.<eos> Suffers a possible career-ending injury, but won't sue. I don't...<eos> I-I can't say I've ever come across anyone like you...<eos> Yeah, well, right back at you.<eos> Okay, 'cause for the life of me I can't understand why this successful, beautiful, high-end attorney<eos> would defend somebody the likes of me.<eos> - Seriously, why?
Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just kept walking and walking, and I didn't know where I was.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got you.<eos> I got you.<eos> Here is to being all grown up.<eos> Ha! Is it just me, or is that guy taking photos of us?<eos> - No, he's taking pictures of you.<eos> - Why?
Deacon.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> My lips are sealed.<eos> This has all been real hard on her.<eos> None of this has been... What I would have wanted or...<eos> What I would have planned.<eos> I guess at some point it's not about what you want anymore.<eos> You just gotta do what you gotta do.<eos> I am sorry about the tour.<eos> Me, too.
No, it's okay, these are good doctors.<eos> I think my days being undercover might be behind me.<eos> Don't worry about that now.<eos> You just get better.<eos> You think you can find something for me in D.C.?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Sir. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Annie, I can't thank you enough for bringing my boy back.<eos> Annie?
I can hardly bear to live in the same house as Veronica any more.<eos> How did you manage things, ending it with Jane?<eos> I battered her about the head with a blunt implement.<eos> Metaphorically speaking, of course.<eos> But if a female challenges the primacy of a male silverback gorilla, that is precisely the treatment she will receive.<eos> My weapon was Jane's infidelity.<eos> I'm thinking of moving out, getting a flat on my own.<eos> Not if you don't want to lose everything, you don't.<eos> Whom do you imagine will be given custody of your children?<eos> Me, of course.
I'm hard to please.<eos> I would never allow...<eos> Something to stand in my way.<eos> We must decide whether we should use bottled or tap water.<eos> We save 50% using tap water.<eos> Then we use it.<eos> It IS an environmental conference.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm separating from Alexander.<eos> - Sad.
I had the strangest dream, and you were there.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Hi, dad.<eos> Hey, you were there, and you were there.<eos> Hey, Mr. C.<eos> I did some healing reiki on you.<eos> Looks like it worked.<eos> And you were there.<eos> I think he's gonna be all right.<eos> Yeah, thanks to you.
Yeah, thanks to you.<eos> Well, look, look, why don't we... why don't we give you guys a moment?<eos> Come on.<eos> - We'll be outside if you need us.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> How was your weekend?<eos> You know, uneventful.<eos> Yours?
He is. It's just... They want a partner there, too.<eos> Mr. Gross has expressed some concern about Cary being up to the job.<eos> We just want the best.<eos> Sure, I'll be there. - Bye.<eos> - What was that?<eos> Will... wants me in the Chumhum meeting.<eos> Why?<eos> He wants a partner there.<eos> Cary, you're sure Chumhum is coming with us when we leave?<eos> Yeah.
Okay.<eos> They asked about your suspension.<eos> No, I-I talked about your suspension.<eos> What did you say?<eos> That we were lucky.<eos> We thought you were going to be... disbarred.<eos> I talked about the money.<eos> The $45,000 that you took.<eos> How we agreed that it was wrong.<eos> Why?
Alicia, we're two weeks away from leaving.<eos> Getting a jump on her clients would mean everything.<eos> Six, seven, eight, nine... ten.<eos> You can't read anything into this. (Phone rings)<eos> Who does Diane have as clients?<eos> CARY: Ushkov Industries.<eos> It's $13 million in billables.<eos> Hello.<eos> KATHY: Alicia, what did you say to her?<eos> What?
- YOU TWO LOOK GREAT.<eos> WHERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE?<eos> - DIANE PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT. WE'RE WAITING FOR PEG.<eos> YOU GIRLS HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.<eos> - PEG.<eos> MAMIE!<eos> WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.<eos> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?<eos> OH, I DON'T CARE.<eos> MAMIE. OH!
Not that bad?<eos> I ruined her sweet sixteen.<eos> It's no wonder I can never figure out a way to get her to like me.<eos> Ben, there's something you need to know.<eos> Dude, unless you know what I should get her for her birthday, it really doesn't matter.<eos> Well, I think I know what she wants.<eos> Really?<eos> Like what?<eos> You.<eos> Me?
I couldn't do it.<eos> Once your mom showed me her picture, I couldn't walk away again.<eos> I'm sorry, but I think I want Emma back.<eos> So you're actually okay with your brother and Riley being together?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> It was kinda my idea.<eos> Look, I'm really sorry about you and Amy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.
Well, that's a window into a dark room.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Okay. Well, I just found out my teenage daughter is pregnant.<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> She's not a cheerleader with an overbite, is she?<eos> - No. Why?<eos> - No reason.
- Okay, but in my defense, - I am emotionally all over the place. - Oh, wow!<eos> - There it is again.<eos> - And I am dealing with a number of personal crises which you really don't need to know about, but I feel like I'm gonna tell you anyway.<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Why can't I stop talking?<eos> Well, that shut me up.<eos> - Nice. - Yeah.<eos> Now what?<eos> - Now you get out of my car.<eos> - Why?
After what you did to her! You bastard!<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> Memorized your moves?<eos> Yes, I did!<eos> Me, too!<eos> But I can't.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> If you miss anything, I'll jump right in.<eos> Ready?
Yelling at a re-run!<eos> They're making me tired.<eos> I made an airplane today.<eos> I made it for my brother.<eos> It looks great.<eos> I'm good at making and fixing things like Daddy.<eos> If that fool didn't make an error, it'd be over!<eos> Go Lotte!<eos> Give up on Lotte.<eos> What!
But then?<eos> ...<eos> And then he fired me for ...<eos> Overall lowered ...<eos> We came here ...<eos> #I was born here.<eos> -A She go for you?<eos> Yeah - like dekabrystka ...<eos> And now thinks I broke her life.<eos> And yourself?
#I know everything!<eos> So tell me ...<eos> #Who in the '78 year ...<eos> He won the match Spartak and Zenit?<eos> You say you know everything ...<eos> #Budkin betrayed us ...<eos> And you and me ...<eos> #He is now with your Nadia.<eos> But the loss ...<eos> #Hard to you?
#How good it is just to sit here with you ...<eos> Look at the fire ...<eos> You could be right away.<eos> #Every evening ...<eos> And you were drunk all the time ...<eos> #Do you have any talking foolishness.<eos> With kids irritates you ...<eos> You should stick to!<eos> And once everything would be better.<eos> #And you ...
I can't watch it, you know? Trust me, this is for his own good.<eos> If he doesn't face this now, he never will.<eos> Yeah, it's too bad, but he's got to get his ass kicked.<eos> Yep. It's time for this to end.<eos> Hi.<eos> Okay, now bow.<eos> Not to me, Karate Kid, to him.<eos> Oh. Bow.<eos> Bow.<eos> Ready.
So, get this -- it's not a dragon.<eos> Uh-- ooh.<eos> Dean.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Or should I say... "Hola"?<eos> Uh, why?<eos> No reason. No reason.<eos> A-are you okay? Me?<eos> Ah --
- Oww! - Stop, stop, stop.<eos> Can you give her something for the pain?<eos> Okay.<eos> Molly... take one of these hydrocodone.<eos> Dad? Dad?<eos> She said you gave her a narcotic that was prescribed to you.<eos> The police want you to submit to a tox screen, and I told them that wouldn't be a problem.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm gonna treat your dad with a course of high-dose steroids.<eos> Why?
The person he knows the least.<eos> Why do you think that is?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Unless he thought he could use...<eos> Unless... he thought he could count on me to give him what he wanted without asking questions.<eos> Because I... am... me.<eos> Jeremiah, you cannot blame yourself.<eos> This is Gina Black reporting live from my hospital bed at Hamptons Heritage.<eos> Don't worry. I'm okay.<eos> Thanks to Hankmed.
made a mistake to trust me.<eos> Are you ready for the match today? - Yes - Sure.<eos> OK, on ? my signal, correréis on a bridge of escsaleras while maniobráis wrench through enrellada rope.<eos> When you reach the end, Make use that key to disengage a bag.<eos> Then Make use parts inside to solve very complicated puzzle.<eos> The first two to finish, still alive. The last person to finish, is out forever.<eos> addition, the winner of this match will decide who give a clue location the immunity idol.<eos> Choose your place and start.<eos> Here we go, two survive. One will be gone forever.<eos> Survivors ready?
can give track any person of any tribe, location the immunity idol.<eos> Who do you give it?<eos> Give it to Monica.<eos> she says you do do all the time?<eos> She does. Not always hear it.<eos> - Although always tries. - Jeff.<eos> what husbands and women do.<eos> What do you do?<eos> track will give Monica.<eos> Why?
Breakfast is in the bag.<eos> Hey, look, I gotta go walk this dog, so--<eos> Jesse.<eos> You're not tying me up again.<eos> Or giving me any more pills.<eos> Just go.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> I know why you're doing all this.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?
[Hums] Russel, is that you?<eos> A boy can't be in a good mood?<eos> Good mood?<eos> [Chuckles] By the way, I love your shoes today.<eos> Okay, what's happening to you?<eos> Tell me while Hank is still here.<eos> Maybe he can save you.<eos> I'm taking a sabbatical from Sutton Chesterfield.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
So I shouldn't bring up Obama?<eos> Bring up anything you want.<eos> Your friends are gonna hate me, aren't they?<eos> I don't want this to poison us, Kurt.<eos> Well, let's go then.<eos> We don't need to do this.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Now, I'm-I'm curious.<eos> Let's meet your friends.<eos> Jeannie?
They're just a little quirky.<eos> Praise Lord Targissian, God of the Universe.<eos> May he fill our vessels with his alien seed.<eos> Hey, it makes more sense than Catholicism.<eos> Tourism numbers, Park budget, safety inspection...<eos> Jet pack, Connie's neck, Steve's fat face.<eos> Steve, Steve...<eos> Steve, you stupid son of a bitch!<eos> Do you swear loyalty to Lord Targissian?<eos> Hey, better him than Obama.
Not if you don't know where you're looking.<eos> Jafar's tower is hidden, enshrouded by magic.<eos> You could be standing right in front of it, not knowing it's there, without my help.<eos> If you want to find Cyrus, then I am your best bet... your only bet, actually.<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> Today... it was the giant rocks.<eos> Some of them as large as a man.<eos> He makes me move them from the bottom of the stone staircase to the top.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> None.
You're gonna be okay.<eos> Hey, plans Friday night?<eos> Just firing off some campaign tweets.<eos> Why, what do you got?<eos> A little surprise shindig at the crib.<eos> You know, for Shay, cheer her up a little bit.<eos> Me and her, we've gotten kind of tight. And I got to look out for my girl.<eos> But don't tell anybody, okay?<eos> Let's keep this intimate, all right?<eos> Exclusive.
Hey, Benny.<eos> Please tell me we're not making a huge mistake here.<eos> What's up, roomies?<eos> What's up, Otis?<eos> Hey, do you need a hand?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> My brother's unloading the u-haul outside.<eos> He's fine.<eos> What's up, bro?<eos> Hey, pal.
I have to ask if you saw a Brian Hayes last night at Molly's.<eos> - I did.<eos> - What's up?<eos> His friends said you threatened him.<eos> Said you wanted to kill him.<eos> It was an argument.<eos> Mm. You seen him since?<eos> No.<eos> I went home to bed, and I've been here all day.<eos> - Why?
Well...<eos> I'm doin' pretty good.<eos> Going to meetings, you know, and a lot of physical therapy.<eos> Oh, that doctor you sent me to...<eos> - She's great.<eos> - Good.<eos> Well, on that note, is there any chance you would consider coming back out on the road with me?<eos> I said the doctor's great.<eos> The hand?<eos> Not so much.
It's for work.<eos> I can't not go.<eos> Ah, see that's the thing. I can not go, so I'm probably gonna... Not go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll ask somebody else.<eos> Is there somebody else?<eos> Do you care if there is?<eos> No.<eos> Me neither.
Then take it out, man!<eos> - We're so close, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> This morning, I was miles beyond anything<eos> - what I did last time... - It's too dangerous.<eos> We're gonna take you up there, we're gonna remove your sensors,<eos> - and then we're gonna close your craniotomy... - What if I don't consent?<eos> What?<eos> What if I say you can't take your sensors back unless you take my tumor, too?<eos> Mickey, I need to take them out.<eos> Sorry, bud.
Anna Leigh Leighton-- now there was a Supreme.<eos> She was majestic and powerful.<eos> She taught me everything I know.<eos> You know how I thanked her?<eos> By cutting her throat.<eos> Right where I'm standing.<eos> With this.<eos> I've kept it all these years.<eos> And now, I give it to you.<eos> Why?
It doesn't matter.<eos> It's done.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> I just talked to Margaret... who confirmed what you refuse to believe.<eos> Honey, it was all a lie.<eos> The pregnancy, the miscarriage.<eos> Tara wants out, Jax.<eos> You, the club, Charming.<eos> She's filing for divorce, and she's gonna take your boys away from you.<eos> From all of us.
Is Tara divorcing me?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Yes.<eos> And taking my sons?<eos> The pregnancy...<eos> I didn't...<eos> Was it...!<eos> Was it a lie?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> Why?
I really can't remember a thing<eos> What do you remember then?<eos> I remember we were on our honeymoon<eos> We were very happy everyday<eos> Are we actually divorced?<eos> Why did we break up?<eos> Why?<eos> How come I woke up one day and my whole world has changed<eos> Don't cry<eos> Why?
I figured there was no reason to worry you if it turns out to be nothing.<eos> It doesn't look like that's the case.<eos> Tim, line 'em up.<eos> Four explosions moving east.<eos> Next big city in line...<eos> Is us.<eos> Wait.<eos> You think it's McCrane?<eos> Sure looks like it.<eos> Why now?
Yes, that was six hours ago.<eos> It was, I admit, a disastrous failure.<eos> But it gave me the idea for Herman, the friendly janitor you met.<eos> With Herman, I commenced the perfect crime.<eos> I caught you as Herman.<eos> But you didn't catch Rosa.<eos> Come out of there.<eos> It turns out that Rosa is great at picking locks.<eos> Does not surprise me.<eos> No, me neither.
Right.<eos> Of course. I forgot.<eos> But after practice...<eos> I have S.A.T. prep.<eos> - We're doomed.<eos> - Mouse...<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> No, we are going to better than fine.<eos> We are going... to be hot!<eos> Hot, hot, hot.
hip jeans.<eos> So it would combine Larissa's two favorite things... commerce and fashion.<eos> If it came with a drink, Larissa would marry it.<eos> Sounds pretty cool.<eos> Yeah, and it gets better.<eos> Samantha is working the Bongo Jeans Holiday Party, so she can sneak me in.<eos> Not exactly sure how.<eos> We haven't quite figured that out yet.<eos> And then I need to think of a way to introduce myself to the C.E.O....<eos> Carter something or other.
No, I don't no him.<eos> Are you sure? A lot of the other traders have already ID'd him and they say he comes round here regularly.<eos> No.<eos> Well, could you show it to your co-workers or family members please.<eos> It's very important.<eos> Sabina!<eos> Yes, Aba?<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you recognise this man?<eos> No, sorry.
- Green.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The clothes hamper was green. The clothes hamper was green!<eos> Drinks on me.<eos> You're weird.<eos> Sorry this is taking so long.<eos> Still writing up my report.<eos> Pretty detailed.<eos> Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?<eos> No, sorry.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - Point to the ones who don't like you...<eos> - I can handle this myself.<eos> - I'm fixing it for you.<eos> And then she... Yeah.<eos> Say, listen, why don't you guys come to my bar later for free drinks.<eos> Teachers don't pay.<eos> We'll think about it.<eos> Okay, they'll think about it.<eos> Bye.
Hello?<eos> Jeremy Gilbert picks up.<eos> Wow. It's a remembrance day miracle.<eos> Now tell me you found Bonnie because I have a hungry vampire who forgot that he's the hero of the story.<eos> I need you to come meet me, and I need you to come alone.<eos> And I need you to be less vague and less weird.<eos> I know where Bonnie is.<eos> Get over here, and I'll explain.<eos> Anything? No.<eos> Sorry.
Oh, and the future is yours, blah, blah, blah.<eos> ( Applause )<eos> - Mr. Goodson.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> - I scared you.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> No, I meant to.<eos> I loved your lecture.<eos> Me, too.
Yeah.<eos> Just looking at... lawyer résumés.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> Jax knows the truth.<eos> He threatened Lowen, and she...<eos> told him everything.<eos> What did he do?<eos> Oh, he didn't hurt her.<eos> Me, either.
___<eos> ___<eos> You never understood, it was your choice to give up Mom's big house, your good job.<eos> Your sacrifice was never for me.<eos> It was for your own secondhand glory, some payday you think you deserve.<eos> And I'm supposed to thank you?<eos> For what?<eos> For spending my life in this house, practicing, praying you'll finally tell me I'm good enough.<eos> You know what you sacrificed, Dad?<eos> Me.
- Find a way!<eos> Shaw: Are you Dr. Gene Porter?<eos> My condolences.<eos> I was sorry to hear about your wife.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Cholera's a terrible way to go.<eos> And who are you?<eos> I just want to help.<eos> This is vaccine.<eos> Cholera vaccine.
It's the last thing I wanna do.<eos> But... there's a chance he can get us home.<eos> And, Emma, while I'm gone, just... Listen to my mother?<eos> Be careful.<eos> Always am.<eos> And when you send that message to Henry, add something to it, would ya?<eos> Tell him... tell him grandpa loves him.<eos> Oh. Um, okay.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You, too.
Hey, we might not be CBI, but we know what we're doing.<eos> Okay. Excuse me.<eos> Yep?<eos> Rigsby, where are you?<eos> Outside the doctor's office.<eos> Looks like Smith's inside.<eos> Are there policemen with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why? Okay, listen carefully. Do not trust anyone in law enforcement.<eos> Anyone at all.
I have my routines.<eos> Weather's finally turned.<eos> It's a little cooler. Far from cold.<eos> But the ocean's still warm and with the warm ocean currents, comes an abundance of sea life.<eos> Just yesterday I watched a pod of dolphins play so close to shore...<eos> I could almost touch them.<eos> There the kind of things, I think you'd enjoy.<eos> Hmm...<eos> Hmm...<eos> Unbelievable.
You said you were finding a job!<eos> No one in this town would hire me.<eos> Because no one trusts you.<eos> But you do.<eos> Don't you, son?<eos> I want to.<eos> What if there was someplace we could start over?<eos> Somewhere where no one knew you?<eos> How?<eos> With this.
Just think it.<eos> You can eat cake all day and not get a stomachache.<eos> Or swing on a vine through a waterfall.<eos> But best of all... you can fly.<eos> Flying is impossible.<eos> Neverland is where the impossible is possible, if you believe it.<eos> Here, I'll show you.<eos> Hoo-whoo!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Uhh.
Don't fight it.<eos> We both know that you're better off without me.<eos> I was never meant to be a father.<eos> No!<eos> Hello, laddie.<eos> Oh, I see you've come bearing gifts.<eos> Where's Henry?<eos> Oh, you mean my great-grandson?<eos> You still haven't told the others who I really am?<eos> Not even your own son.
David Coleman. Malloy, I am highly disappointed.<eos> You don't know a thing about the value of money.<eos> I stand by my purchase.<eos> It's not your purchase if it's on my credit card!<eos> How much was this thing?<eos> I got it at a good price, and I can do this.<eos> Aah! Why?<eos> !<eos> Why?
He just got paralyzed.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Get outta the way!<eos> This man's friend's handicapped!<eos> Look at him!<eos> He's all [Bleeped] up!<eos> What the [Bleep] do you think you're doing?<eos> Grieving.<eos> I got a crippled friend.<eos> Oh, my bad.
- I thought I was giving you the tour.<eos> Looks like you know this place better than I do.<eos> Yes, well, I have an affinity for libraries.<eos> So, have you had any interesting correspondence lately?<eos> That would presuppose a letterbox, so, no.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Actually, I did get a hand-delivered note the other day.<eos> - It was very peculiar.<eos> - Really?<eos> Why?
But it's too late.<eos> You know, he... He was under for way too long without any air.<eos> And he's still alive, but he's...<eos> Afterwards, everybody's thanking me.<eos> You know, saying I saved him.<eos> But I was driving.<eos> I just wanted to drive that car so bad.<eos> I-I took the keys from him.<eos> I never told anyone.<eos> Not even him.
Shall we go now?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, I have to go now.<eos> Joe, I will pay you the deal soon.<eos> That's alright.<eos> I'm sorry. Thank you very much.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We've got over one million views now.<eos> I think I can't go with you guys.<eos> What?
I can.<eos> I will.<eos> Go home now, get some rest.<eos> Tom will drive you.<eos> He'll be awake.<eos> He'll be drunk.<eos> It'll just upset my mother.<eos> Stay here tonight.<eos> But in the morning we're going to talk.<eos> Deacon.
Hey, Peter. Wh-What's that?<eos> Oh, he's gonna turn you into a pile on Joe's lawn.<eos> What? !<eos> Here, let's play steak catch.<eos> Oh, boy, I got it!<eos> Hey, back to you, Peter! Cool!<eos> Steak catch!<eos> I'm gonna use my one steak-in-the-pants time-out.<eos> Not me!<eos> Not me!
He wanted to take the right path.<eos> So he became a cop.<eos> Well, Matt never got his badge.<eos> He was busted for heroin possession. He got kicked out of the Academy.<eos> I was disappointed.<eos> Special Agent Blake Kennedy, ATF.<eos> I just got a call?<eos> What happened to my guy?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your guy?
- There you go.<eos> - Thank you. So, is everything in order?<eos> Relax.<eos> There's nothing to worry over.<eos> The exchange rates are in your favor.<eos> I started as a teller at that SL, you know?<eos> 15 years I put in, and then they tell me I need to take a pay cut.<eos> So I decided they owed me a pay raise.<eos> Here's my $50,000, Mr. Russell.<eos> Outstanding.
Stop picking on him.<eos> What's the matter with you lot?<eos> I have other cases in there to support the theory.<eos> You can either use it, or discard it, as you see fit.<eos> Thanks for your thoughts, Ed.<eos> Do you think it's wise to come down here?<eos> Tongues will wag.<eos> Oh, let them talk.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> Why?
If Mr Moray doesn't see it, then I will tell him myself.<eos> Flora's quite taken with you, Denise.<eos> She's a sweet girl, Ma'am.<eos> One can never guess at the turns of fate.<eos> How could I imagine a year ago I would be here now, like this, a ten-year-old child under my care, to love.<eos> She will want to visit the store regularly, I'm sure.<eos> Will you look after her for me?<eos> If that is what you want, Ma'am.<eos> Denise, I must apologise to you.<eos> To me, Ma'am?
I think he was headed to the same house.<eos> - He runs the port, doesn't he?<eos> - He thinks he does.<eos> Charlie Barosky's a product of every slimy loophole in our criminal justice system.<eos> Look into him.<eos> Maybe there's a connection with the MC or the Byz-lats.<eos> Maybe she's here for the banana split.<eos> What?<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Why?
I need to get a restraining order.<eos> - Thank you, Rhoda.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Fresh baked.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Glad to see you're up and running.<eos> Heard about the drive-by.<eos> Yeah, thank God that kind of shit is a rarity in this neighborhood.<eos> That's right.<eos> Thanks to you.
Nothing.<eos> Oh, my God...<eos> I lost our baby girl.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I can't be around her anymore, Jax.<eos> I know.<eos> She... she kicked me in the stomach.<eos> What kind of sick person does that?<eos> Why?
I'm not trying to make you look bad, chief.<eos> You guys are going about this all wrong.<eos> - Leave...<eos> - You know what?<eos> We're gonna continue working.<eos> So, you're just gonna do this on your own, huh?<eos> That's what we're gonna do.<eos> Okay. Let's see how that works out for you.<eos> Ha fun.<eos> Thanks, chief.
- You know what?<eos> We're gonna continue working.<eos> So, you're just gonna do this on your own, huh?<eos> That's what we're gonna do.<eos> Okay. Let's see how that works out for you.<eos> Ha fun.<eos> Thanks, chief.<eos> Here's where the fire started, making this arc number one.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, guys.
Or Michelle, the talented hash-slinging single mom?<eos> Chefs, what would you say is the most indispensable tool in your kitchen?<eos> That's easy, my knife.<eos> Something even more essential.<eos> My palate.<eos> Very good, Michelle.<eos> Today's advantage round is a palate test.<eos> Each one of you gonna sample one of these four dishes and identify the mystery protein.<eos> First chef to do so will win immunity for the next round.<eos> Chefs.
It's okay, a couple needs to iron out these details before they go down the aisle.<eos> I wish I had done that with my first husband.<eos> When we first got together, it was very romantic-- very much like you two.<eos> Where did you guys meet?<eos> We met at a forensics seminar.<eos> Ended up ditching, spent the whole week together, and then, a month later, we got engaged.<eos> And then, uh, we got married and real life set in, and... as much as we loved each other, we were still very, very different people with different goals and different needs and...<eos> Just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I'm thinking, uh, white chocolate raspberry symphony.<eos> Anybody else?
The potentially catastrophic risk of turning on this machine far outweigh any scientific gain that might come from it.<eos> The people need to understand just how dangerous technology like this is.<eos> And the very real possibility of a cataclysmic event.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Is everything ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just need a few personal days.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Have to help a friend.<eos> Who?
You're talking on a cell phone after what he just told us?<eos> ABBIE: This is a crime scene.<eos> That is a dead body.<eos> His friends are already on their way.<eos> JENNY: There are others out there just like him.<eos> We have to assume they are everywhere. Trust no one.<eos> Not the cops, not your boss.<eos> This is out of control, Jenny. We can't do this by ourselves.<eos> No, look. They were tracking me.<eos> Abbie.
my grandma calls me pineapples, those new york cops from the '70s you wrote about were my idols--i mean, gaminsky, cavanaugh, quigg.<eos> those guys were the real deal.<eos> i once saw gaminsky choke a hippy to death with his own ponytail.<eos> illegal.<eos> love that.<eos> mr. brogan is writing an article about how brooklyn detectives have changed in the 35 years since the squad.<eos> he'll be observing the two of you on your internet identity theft case.<eos> i hope mr. brogan's presence doesn't prove to be a distraction to you, peralta.<eos> distracted?<eos> me?
- Are you dating Elizabeth?<eos> - How do you do that?<eos> - They made me choose.<eos> You have to choose.<eos> You can't have both women.<eos> What was I supposed to do? What, you think you can have a bunch of wives?<eos> !<eos> You got one wife!<eos> This is the way the world works!<eos> - Why? !
I just...<eos> I want to thank you, though, just for being there for me<eos> - No. I'm not listening to you and I'm not there for you.<eos> - Because now we're in this together.<eos> - We're not in this together and I'm not listening and I'm not being there, so just stop telling me things!<eos> What would you like me to do with this information?<eos> Well, it really helped me to tell you.<eos> - You should tell somebody, get it off your chest.<eos> - I can't. - You know what I mean?<eos> - Like... who?
Eight dollars?<eos> That's a very specific amount.<eos> That's fine...<eos> It's your world, your rules, so...<eos> Excellent.<eos> You go to the castle, you got to pay the king.<eos> What is processing? What does that mean?<eos> It's just a word you use to make more money off of us.<eos> - That makes me mad!<eos> - Me, too, yeah.
Should we grow up tomorrow night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Muscle time!<eos> - Get on the ground!<eos> - Muscle time! - I'm a cop! - Back up!<eos> - I got a badge and a gun!<eos> - Arrest me, dude!<eos> He's got backup!<eos> Serpentine!<eos> Serpentine!
I'm like a supernatural Madonna, don't you think?<eos> So Silas read your mind and figured out where The Anchor is?<eos> Now what?<eos> You now that old, ancient story I told you about the Travelers?<eos> Oh, wait. You don't.<eos> I fried your brain and took your memories.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The Travelers-- you know how Silas wants to destroy the other side so he can be at peace with that slut Amara that he calls his one true love?<eos> The Travelers don't want that.<eos> Why not?
And you're certain you're pregnant?<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, I'm not seeing one baby, let alone two.<eos> And you're absolutely sure?<eos> Twins would be hard to miss.<eos> I'm not hearing any heartbeats either.<eos> I'm sorry if you were informed otherwise.<eos> I'll give you some time alone.<eos> -I'm so sorry.
I'm not in The Ritz anymore.<eos> Don't you want it back?<eos> I want it back.<eos> All of it.<eos> Set it up now, Nuck, while there's still a hand to play.<eos> Who don't you trust?<eos> - Huh? - On our side, who don't you trust?<eos> Why are you even asking?<eos> Because I'm curious.<eos> Baden
I got to drive out to Somerset.<eos> Um... I just wanted to tell you I thought I was kind of a jerk today in the car.<eos> Yeah, you... you kind of were.<eos> And you might want to send a note to Mrs. Gaffney, or at least pay to get her wig dry-cleaned.<eos> Honey, come here, come here, come on.<eos> Come sit down.<eos> Come on. I always have time for my third-favorite daughter.<eos> I just wanted to say that I... I miss us hanging out, you know?<eos> I think we should do more things together.<eos> Me, too.
No.<eos> Kristin got too involved with a high-school boyfriend, and it basically derailed her life.<eos> And produced a kid who can't catch a shoe.<eos> This is a danger... Whoa! Whoa!<eos> What are you... what are you dressed as?<eos> I'm a farm girl.<eos> E-i-e-i-no!<eos> Dad, we had a hoedown at my sorority tonight, and all of the other girls were dressed exactly like this.<eos> Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, this is exactly why I told you I don't like sororities.<eos> - Why not?
And I hated every minute of it.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Yes.<eos> As long as you're miserable, I guess I'm happy.<eos> I want to say something, but I... I don't want you to feel any pressure.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I can take pressure. My brothers used to sit on me, like, all the time.<eos> I love you.<eos> Boy, I'm glad you're not a customer.<eos> Why?
W-w-what about all those times that she would drag you into your room with a hairbrush?<eos> She was brushing my hair.<eos> You were screaming and crying.<eos> Yeah, 'cause there were tangles.<eos> Was I the only one mom ever spanked?<eos> - She does high-five really hard.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, I saw her SWAT muffin once with a newspaper, so maybe you guys could form a support group!<eos> "Hello, everyone, my name is muffin, and I'm a victim of spanking."<eos> Unbelievable.
I won't tell him.<eos> Thank you! Oh, you're the best.<eos> Can we get ice cream?<eos> No, honey. It's too close to dinner.<eos> I think you should get me some ice cream.<eos> I said no.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Boyd! Hey!<eos> You said you wouldn't say anything. Daddy always gives me treats when he wants me to do something.<eos> Unbelievable.
oh, that's where they went.<eos> and here's the really cool part.<eos> get in here, look at the scarring on this liver.<eos> cause of death: poison.<eos> ingested.<eos> boyle was right.<eos> all right, i'm gonna go tell him.<eos> yeah, you could.<eos> or you could stay for a post-mortem. nope.<eos> sorry.
What was he talking about?<eos> What "battle"?<eos> Are we dealing with someone who's completely lost it?<eos> He whipped our butts on the chess board.<eos> That doesn't mean he's not two sandwiches short of a picnic.<eos> He's a human fossil.<eos> How can we trust anything he says?<eos> You said Henry's father worked as a county bailiff, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why?
Even these sewer rats will abandon you.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> It's your first assignment as a newly-enhanced operative.<eos> Welcome to Safe House 46.<eos> This man is guilty of various banal cruelties.<eos> Assault.<eos> Rape.<eos> Murder.<eos> You're going to carry out his punishment.<eos> Why?
Share that with your clients.<eos> The era of constriction is over.<eos> Now, a new era needs new branding.<eos> "L. G." Own those letters.<eos> No one says "Lockhart/Gardner" anymore.<eos> It's "L. G."<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Who's thinking of leaving?<eos> - Sonya Rucker. The Wabash Fund.<eos> - Chumhum?
Well, we can't be doing pro bono.<eos> - No, no, no. We should do it.<eos> - Why? Natalie Flores works for a New York lobbyist named Joe Pallotta.<eos> He controls $90 million in client billing.<eos> He can direct Chicago work our way.<eos> Checked online. Okay.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Hey, our first new client. - All right. - Yes.<eos> Hey, uh... Who was the last person hired, the last salaried person?<eos> - Why?
That would be great.<eos> Ne-Next time you're in town, yeah.<eos> Oh, and, um... here.<eos> I got you dried apricots.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I... I thought of you with dried apricots.<eos> Okay. Um, I'll talk to you later.<eos> Natalie, wait!<eos> We have to have dinner tonight, or it'll never happen.<eos> - Really?
Huh... I always took it literally.<eos> That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant.<eos> I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together.<eos> Not as relieved as I'm about to be.<eos> It's a brave new world, little lady.<eos> I (THEME SONG PLAYS) I<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You don't want your girlfriend at work with you.<eos> Hell Clam.<eos> Why not?
Okay, we're almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.<eos> This is so exciting, I-I feel... like I'm 75 again.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What... what is it?<eos> Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.<eos> Can-can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> W-Why do you put up with Sheldon?<eos> Oh, uh, you know, because we're friends.<eos> Why?
Thea.<eos> Roy.<eos> Did I hear you guys say something about a party?<eos> A welcome back to Queen Consolidated party for mom.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If things are going to get back to normal, then we need to start acting normal.<eos> Normal for us is a lavish party.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen, I can't stay for brunch.<eos> I guess we got to go.<eos> Bye.
I just feel really awkward.<eos> You bring the funny, Hiccup!<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> I'm gonna grab my gear.<eos> Then we're gonna get us that Night Fury, brother.<eos> - "Brother"?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You and me.<eos> And the awkwardness continues.<eos> - Shh.
- No, I'm not happy.<eos> What'd, you tell them your stupid scary stories?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe... not.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Come on, let's find the others.<eos> Uh, we're right here.<eos> Could you guys argue any louder?<eos> Sure, yeah, but why would you...<eos> - Shh.
I see you went all out.<eos> Was the Home Depot out of Mexicans?<eos> No, they won't get in my car anymore, since the pinata incident.<eos> Gather around, boys.<eos> It's payday.<eos> You're paying them with meth?<eos> Why not?<eos> It saves them a step.<eos> Plus, it makes 'em work faster.<eos> - Thanks, boss.
Same as it was the last time you asked, ten minutes ago.<eos> Aunt Erin, do you need help with anything?<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> Thanks, Jack.<eos> We got Erin dodging bullets, and Jamie telling off his bosses.<eos> It's been a banner week for the family business.<eos> I didn't tell anyone off.<eos> Oh, and here you thought I was the troublemaker, Dad.<eos> Who'd you tell off?<eos> No one.
Now, you write down the names.<eos> And, Cary, you're fired.<eos> For a second time.<eos> Yes, a second time. Get the hell out.<eos> The executive committee called this emergency...<eos> Hold on!<eos> Quiet down, please!<eos> This is an emergency meeting of the full partnership with one cause of action.<eos> We have a partner who is actively trying to steal our top clients.<eos> Chumhum.
- I'm also your buddy.<eos> - Thanks, guy.<eos> And I'm telling you there's more to this that you think, and if you want to save your marriage and your face, you need to figure it out quick.<eos> Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent $22,000 on the Intellilink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.<eos> Yeah, but, see, the problem is not everyone is signed on to it yet.<eos> They can't sign on, because every time they try they make sprinklers go off.<eos> I know that Intellilink has had some... Hiccups, okay?<eos> I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the Intellilink system and make sure it runs smoothly.<eos> I want you all to meet Pat Conners.<eos> - Hello, everyone.
You are facing the bull again tomorrow.<eos> What is the cause of this ill feeling between yourself and Elpis?<eos> Cyrus, I am responsible for all the bull leapers.<eos> If there is something troubling you, you should tell me.<eos> Last night I saw Elpis cut a lock of Jason's hair as he slept.<eos> I fear she means him harm.<eos> I cannot understand it.<eos> It is not in her nature.<eos> Have you told anyone else what you saw?<eos> Only you.
Little retreat.<eos> Where to?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> We had a meeting.<eos> She missed it.<eos> I'm just trying to find out if we're going to reschedule.<eos> When I see her, I'll let her know.<eos> Do you have a struggle with your need to be a good man?<eos> I struggle with all my needs...<eos> just like everyone else.
Get Caracara up and running.<eos> TM back on track.<eos> SAMCRO will be fine.<eos> Chibs?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> I was wrong about Juice.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> Why?
If he told you, he trusted you.<eos> So whatever it is, you have to be the one to deal with it.<eos> I mean, of course he's gonna to push you away because he hates being vulnerable.<eos> But that's when he's gonna need you to stick with him the most.<eos> I'll keep trying.<eos> We'll, you're gonna have to do better than try, Because my plate is full.<eos> I have too many kids and too many patients, and I can't handle a broken Alex right now.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Is it out of the question to get a little consistency in this family?<eos> What consistency?
No.<eos> What did you do?<eos> He was gonna kill Damon.<eos> But we promised that we would help him.<eos> She didn't have a choice, all right?<eos> Once he had the taste of vampire blood, there was nothing stopping him.<eos> Go ask Dr. Frankenstein.<eos> I'll go deal with him.<eos> Caroline, I'm so sorry.<eos> I-- Yeah. Me, too.
What the hell happened to you?<eos> Ditto.<eos> Elena's not here by any chance, is she?<eos> I haven't seen her, not that I've been looking.<eos> Stef, you awake?<eos> You know, he hasn't seen her either.<eos> I know because we were together all night.<eos> Look. I've had a really crappy couple days, ok?<eos> If you're implying what I think you're implying...<eos> Why?
He redirected it somehow.<eos> It's pinging all over the five boroughs.<eos> This guy's good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're gonna have to be better.<eos> I'm sorry about Jimmy.<eos> I let him fall off my radar.<eos> You and everybody else.<eos> Jerry, you've been dealing with loss for a long time, a lot of years.<eos> Why this time?
Jamie, I just got a text.<eos> Know that collar you asked me to look into?<eos> Yeah, Grady Bayless.<eos> Yeah. Hung himself in his cell at Rikers this morning.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Damn.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. May he rest in peace, huh?<eos> ...which we are about to receive from thy bounty.<eos> Through Christ our Lord.
Not the Colleen I know.<eos> I always wanted to ask you about that.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> There was talk.<eos> Can't say I'm surprised.<eos> Colleen and I...<eos> Not that we ever acted on it...<eos> So what are you telling me for?<eos> I don't know. I never told anyone.<eos> Family, friends.
I always wanted to ask you about that.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> There was talk.<eos> Can't say I'm surprised.<eos> Colleen and I...<eos> Not that we ever acted on it...<eos> So what are you telling me for?<eos> I don't know. I never told anyone.<eos> Family, friends.<eos> No one.
Whoo! And I'm thankful that I have a beautiful wife and two sons who put up with me 'cause, believe me, it's not that way in every family, and I'm also thankful for that drumstick on the right, which has my name on it.<eos> Me- - I'm just thankful for what I'm always thankful for:<eos> to be happy to be kicking around this place with all of you.<eos> I'm thankful for all the ordinary citizens who have come up to me on the beat over the past year and thanked me for my service-- all two of 'em.<eos> Also, bulletproof vests.<eos> I'm thankful I only have a year and a half left before I go to college.<eos> I'm thankful that she still has a year and a half left before she goes to college.<eos> And I'm thankful for four generations of this family at this table, safe and sound and starving.<eos> Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty.<eos> Through Christ, our Lord, amen.
Like a dragon and a field of poppies?<eos> Are people fooled by you?<eos> The only dragons are in children's stories.<eos> Then I must be a liar.<eos> But why these lies?<eos> Who gains?<eos> The fortune-telling was henry's idea,<eos> So it can't have come from catherine. Who are you and who do you serve?<eos> The realm...<eos> Myself, the truth. The truth?
His feelings are for Mary.<eos> Do you want your reputation cleaned up?<eos> Do you want a big wedding and children to silence forever those who call you "whore" behind your back?<eos> Then make yourself the next Queen of France.<eos> "Feelings"? Honestly.<eos> Join us, Kenna.<eos> We're going to greet the King.<eos> You look especially lovely, Kenna.<eos> Who are you dressed to impress?<eos> No one.
Most of the castle servants are gathered to hear from you.<eos> Shall I send a few back to the kitchen?<eos> Your uniform, Robert.<eos> It's a disgrace!<eos> Fix it.<eos> - You may let them in now.<eos> - What are you waiting for?<eos> By now, you've all heard what has happened.<eos> Someone who is no friend of France has invaded the castle and threatened us.<eos> All of us.
I've spent some one-on-one time with aliens before.<eos> Didn't work out too well.<eos> So cases like this are personal to me.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Get comfortable.<eos> Help me!<eos> Please! Help me!<eos> You should be more careful.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You?
Because to do this, I have to be focused, tactical.<eos> I can't be distracted. Especially by things that happened a lifetime ago.<eos> You're saying touching the staff unlocked certain memories?<eos> My worst memory.<eos> The first time I felt hate.<eos> And it won't go away.<eos> I don't trust myself.<eos> The way I went off at Skye and Fitz-Simmons in the lab...<eos> Grant, you telling me this makes me feel I can trust you.<eos> Him, on the other hand...
This is about beckett?<eos> No, but I was hurt you didn't tell me.<eos> Look, I was going to tell you.<eos> It just...<eos> I know it did, and I don't know if it's a good idea<eos> But you know what? I accept it.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because she makes you happy, The same way pi makes me happy.<eos> All I want is the same thing I'm giving you...<eos> Acceptance.
Yes.<eos> No, no, no, no. You're not--no.<eos> We need a minivan. We need it.<eos> No way.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> A minivan?<eos> It's the best-yeah.<eos> You say "minivan," I hear "vagina." That's what I hear.<eos> Okay, well, we're going vagina shopping tomorrow.<eos> So sorry about that.
What can I say?<eos> Grew up in Kentucky.<eos> Horses are my passion.<eos> You know, it was actually a horse that, uh, got me signed with Edgehill?<eos> Yep, Jeff Fordham sent over the grandson of a derby winner.<eos> Couldn't say no to that.<eos> Yeah, that Jeff Fordham... he really knows how to get what he wants.<eos> - What, you don't like Jeff?<eos> - I don't like anybody right now.<eos> Ha ha. Why not?
I was a little afraid you wouldn't talk to me, seeing as I'm fully dressed and not near a swimming pool, but...<eos> Did Jeff Fordham tell you that?<eos> Good lord, y'all are inseparable.<eos> No, look, he's just worried you might be sabotaging yourself a little bit.<eos> He's worried or you're worried?<eos> Okay, I admit it.<eos> I'm worried.<eos> This is something I have wanted to do for a very long time.<eos> I am gonna buy myself out of this label, come hell or high water.<eos> Why?
The verse is good, but the chorus isn't strong enough.<eos> All right, uh, I'll keep workin' on it.<eos> Do that, 'cause when you don't come up with something 40,000 people can sing back at you, they gonna sing something else...<eos> A song called, "boo!<eos> Get off the stage."<eos> Well, Scarlett didn't deserve that.<eos> Man, she's talented. So...<eos> So was her Uncle Deacon.<eos> Not everybody makes it, son...<eos> As hit performers or songwriters.
Lieutenant, you can't trust them.<eos> We should live or die together!<eos> If you still regard me as lieutenant of the Special Force to China you have to obey my order.<eos> Brother, we know we can't beat you.<eos> Let us enjoy the last fight of our lives.<eos> I won't see your final victory. I believe you'll save the children. Yes...<eos> Save the children!<eos> You shouldn't spare us.<eos> Their lives are in your hands now.<eos> Brother.
Don't do this on his big night.<eos> I simply want him to understand that the people who support him are right here.<eos> Nothing's ever simple with you.<eos> Aiden, call me the second you get this.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Have you?<eos> You threatened Jack?<eos> Tell him to run?<eos> - He's in the way.<eos> - Of who?
I simply want him to understand that the people who support him are right here.<eos> Nothing's ever simple with you.<eos> Aiden, call me the second you get this.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Have you?<eos> You threatened Jack?<eos> Tell him to run?<eos> - He's in the way.<eos> - Of who?<eos> Of you.
Come on, we'll get you some water.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're still clipped in there!<eos> Pop-Pop, help!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I got you.<eos> I got you. Oh. You're so strong.<eos> I feel so safe.<eos> That was so much harder than I thought.<eos> But you did it.<eos> Uh, well, yeah, thanks to you.
Actually, less that 6% of salt in the United States is used for food.<eos> The vast majority of it goes for de-icing roads and snow control.<eos> Guys.<eos> Over here.<eos> You're right.<eos> The killer's been here before.<eos> And he seems to have a preference for blondes.<eos> Kylie, this one looks good.<eos> I like it.<eos> Me, too.
Can you tell me the capital of Scotland?<eos> Edinburgh.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I should like to ask the Infant Prodigy a question.<eos> In what year did Christopher Columbus discover America?<eos> She is a credit to you.<eos> Well done, Miss Flora, go and sit down.<eos> Thank you all for coming, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Now we have two people to thank for this evening.<eos> Mr Weston.
- What now, Russell Crowe?<eos> Hasn't your beautiful mind gotten you in enough trouble today?<eos> Look, I don't quit until I get it right, and our corporate pretty boy just doesn't fit into the big picture.<eos> We've never seen him-- NSA or NCIS.<eos> He's a first-timer.<eos> Exactly. But if he sends bugs to tech employees looking for corporate secrets, why make the jump to SECNAV and a crime that carries out a life sentence?<eos> Something made him leave his comfort zone.<eos> It's not about ideology or power, it's... it's about challenging himself, proving that he can do the job.<eos> Who's he trying to impress?<eos> His boss.
You're probably just overtired, which is why this will get you home safe and sound for your curfew.<eos> Think she understood that?<eos> Hey, Layla.<eos> There you are.<eos> You just come over to gloat?<eos> No.<eos> About what?<eos> Juliette flipped our sets.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Why?
- So after considering all these factors...<eos> - I'm here...<eos> Your honor.<eos> I can't speak to my father's business dealings or to his reputation in the financial community, but I do think I can speak to the issue of whether or not he's a flight risk.<eos> He is not.<eos> My father values his family more than anything, and I know he wants to be home to be with us.<eos> He wouldn't do anything to compromise that.<eos> Now my father and I have disagreed over a lot over the years, but...<eos> I've never doubted his commitment to family<eos> - and to the city.
I wanted to look into one of the lab employees<eos> I suspected was an alcoholic.<eos> So you didn't just record objective facts... You memorialized subjective opinion, follow-ups,<eos> - strategies.<eos> Uh, hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - Hi. Uh, Robyn Burdine, the Florrick/Agos investigator.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.
When it comes to his family, he does.<eos> And that's what will eventually... hurt him.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need to go.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> The second trimester.<eos> Well, we could put the plant manager on the stand.<eos> He must have known about the defective pins.<eos> He'll just deny it. Then we need to try another PLCAA exception.<eos> Fine.
A lot of weirdos out there with too much imagination is what happened.<eos> And, yes, I'm looking at you, Castle.<eos> Yeah, except I only commit my murders on paper.<eos> I don't actually do them.<eos> A lot more lucrative, a lot less prison.<eos> So was she electrocuted?<eos> Yeah, but that's not the cause of death.<eos> Her throat was cut.<eos> And the rest of this, if I had to guess, I'd say she was tortured.<eos> Why?
So you were consulting an expert on joint replacement - about a joint.<eos> - Yeah. Is it true that Dr. Torres had never actually done an operation with this kind of joint before?<eos> It's true.<eos> But you went ahead with it anyway.<eos> She said she had done a lot of research.<eos> She said she was confident.<eos> So you trusted her to use her expertise to advise you, and to keep you safe.<eos> When, in fact, what you got was a botched surgery, an infection, a revision surgery, a heart surgery... and... I mean, look at you now.<eos> Just let me pull up the blanket.<eos> Why?
I am concerned for Katherine.<eos> Her husband's jealousy is telling on her.<eos> I fear she might fall ill.<eos> Well, that is all to the good.<eos> Your courting of her has w-worked to our favour.<eos> What I am trying to make clear to you is that I cannot continue with this deception.<eos> Tom Weston is a dangerously volatile man.<eos> The pressure is telling on him.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> All to the good.
Perhaps you should have that engraved on a plaque.<eos> I was thinking perhaps a tattoo!<eos> There she is!<eos> Myrtle!<eos> Don't tell me - a new bustier.<eos> You look magnificent.<eos> You see! Women dress for other women because other women notice.<eos> Oh, we shall have a night of it, tonight!<eos> It's women only, lads! It is women only!<eos> Small mercies.
I mean you no harm.<eos> I have a message for you.<eos> Princess Ariadne.<eos> Run.<eos> Guards!<eos> There's nowhere left for you to run.<eos> Do we know who this man is?<eos> He has yet to regain consciousness.<eos> I thought Princess Ariadne might be able to tell us more.<eos> Ariadne.
Do I have to explain with diagrams?<eos> They will not thank us for interrupting them...<eos> You can trust them, they're my friends.<eos> I'm ready to return to Atlantis.<eos> Really?<eos> That was quick.<eos> The light's fading.<eos> The mountain paths are too dangerous in the dark.<eos> We should make camp for the night.<eos> Ariadne.
I hope someday, I might be able to return.<eos> I wish for that more than anything.<eos> I will send word when I can.<eos> Is he a part of the reason you stay in Atlantis?<eos> As I said... ..there are many people I care for.<eos> Farewell, little sister.<eos> Farewell.<eos> I cannot thank you enough for everything you've done.<eos> I must go.<eos> Ariadne.
Farewell.<eos> I cannot thank you enough for everything you've done.<eos> I must go.<eos> Ariadne.<eos> In the forest when Therus had his sword to me... ..how much of what I said did you hear?<eos> I was still a little drowsy.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> No, I was just curious.<eos> Ariadne.
- Clearly?<eos> And we're doing it at 7:00 A.M.<eos> Well, the guy at the hardware store said to hang the samples in the morning so you can see what they look like throughout the day.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I like this one.<eos> Grandma's Pumpkins?<eos> Grandma's what?<eos> I know, it's ridiculous.<eos> Oh, I'm just so sick of this room.<eos> Why?
Ok!<eos> What do we do with the rest of this shit?<eos> Forty seconds left!<eos> Take it all! Now let's welcome the main man Johnny Henriksen! Hey, what can I say?<eos> Thank you, my friend.<eos> What a crazy ride it's been Johnny! I bid thanks to all who voted for me.<eos> You're very wise. And eh...<eos> My eternal gratitude for the one Norwegian. That made all of this possible.<eos> Johan Halcross.
My guy. Hi! Lars.<eos> Ah!<eos> Welcome to my humble establishment.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Johan winning like a dark horse, that was beautiful.<eos> He's a great guy. You two tight?<eos> He came with me to climb shuwoomba.<eos> What you people in the west call Everest.<eos> Nice to know somebody who knows what he's like me and some other guys who have had a little bit of success are having this Lutefisk.<eos> In a few days.
What?<eos> You...<eos> Why? Are you going to hit me again? The first time is difficult.<eos> The second time... not so much.<eos> Do you see this?<eos> The doctor says I'll need a two week recovery.<eos> You got a doctor's note?<eos> I'll suffer just once. I won't suffer a second time.<eos> If the doctor says that I will need a 2-week recovery, then I can sue you!<eos> Depression, panic disorder, social phobia?
Do you how many times I called?<eos> My business trip to the U.S. was longer than I anticipated.<eos> Yes, it was about that.<eos> I asked you to stay at our hotel. Your refusal was upsetting.<eos> The factory was too far out in the countryside, so the hotel wasn't at a convenient location.<eos> It's been a while since we've seen each other.<eos> I met Rachel while I was in the U.S.<eos> I heard.<eos> Your family's doing well, right?<eos> Thanks to you.
Two.<eos> Three.<eos> We lost!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Not even a phone call.<eos> Am I so easy to forget?<eos> Now, what if I count to ten...<eos> Temmuz!<eos> If you start with the "what if" s, I swear, I will leave.<eos> My friend...
So, can I get my friends to buy some?<eos> The posh ones.<eos> That's okay.<eos> - You look really good.<eos> - Mom, don't worry, I'm fine.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I'm attacking life, I'm wrestling in the middleweight class.<eos> I wonder, to what do we owe this change?<eos> Or whom?<eos> To a friend.
Help!<eos> I have one more request.<eos> Can you please take the dog for a little walk?<eos> Go as far as possible.<eos> Okay, I'll walk her.<eos> Bro, I'm here!<eos> Bro!<eos> I'm going to give you some money.<eos> Then, I'm going to hurt you a little.<eos> Him too, of course.
- Gynecologist for supermodels.<eos> Well, which is it?<eos> You do brain surgery on gynecologists or gynecology on supermodel brain surgeons?<eos> I build robots.<eos> So how about those packers this week?<eos> Packers?<eos> Football season doesn't start for five months.<eos> I know.<eos> I was talking about the, uh...<eos> Fudge-packers.
Now Connie, I'm sorry about this, but federal guidelines dictate that I don't have to let you breastfeed at work unless you got a real sweet set of milkies.<eos> What's wrong with my boobs?<eos> Besides the fact that you also have a back set?<eos> Ah! Antichrist!<eos> Antichrist!<eos> This is going too far, Denzel!<eos> That baby's evil.<eos> I'll prove it!<eos> - How?<eos> - Through science.
No need.<eos> The crimson tide is rolling again.<eos> I got my period.<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> I guess I was just late... this month.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> That's awesome news.<eos> Oh, I am so relieved.<eos> You're relieved?<eos> Why?
You know, I didn't want to come here in the first place.<eos> Big shocker-- I'll call Channel 9 news.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know what it means.<eos> You never want to go anywhere.<eos> You're a stick in the mud.<eos> You take your stick and you plant it right in the mud.<eos> Yeah, well, that's better than being a "hopes too high."<eos> You get this whole perfect idea of stuff built up in your head, and you're always disappointed.<eos> Why?
After we made cookies, I had to jitterbug with his grandma.<eos> She kept touching my face.<eos> She called me Donald.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but we had a deal.<eos> It's gonna be fun, and trust me, you're gonna love "White Christmas."<eos> It's one of the best movie musicals of all time.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's a musical? !<eos> That should have been disclosed at the beginning of negotiations!<eos> Why?
Don't ask.<eos> I can understand why he might find her attractive.<eos> It is more...<eos> What she might find attractive in him.<eos> Indeed.<eos> He has a big heart.<eos> And is brave.<eos> So he says.<eos> And loyal.<eos> To his stomach.
Thank you...<eos> I don't mean thank you, I mean...<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You must go.<eos> Till later.<eos> Till later.<eos> All right!<eos> Sorry.<eos> This is all your fault, this fear.<eos> Me?
But you can make her better?<eos> Please, Pythagoras.<eos> Fetch me some herbs - sticklewort, flaxseed, borage.<eos> Well?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no change?<eos> Give it time, Hercules.<eos> You're right.<eos> He's right, isn't he?<eos> Pythagoras?
And you must suffer a fool's Fate.<eos> Pythagoras.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm going after him.<eos> We can't let him face Circe alone.<eos> Thank you for coming so quickly.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Through there.<eos> Korinna?
Where is she?<eos> Through there.<eos> Korinna?<eos> You must give her this, diluted in water three times a day.<eos> If her symptoms worsen, and only if they worsen, you may try this.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> Are you sure we are doing the right thing?<eos> Are the Gods Greek?<eos> Well, they have a variety of complex roots...<eos> Pythagoras?
I am sure I need not warn you of the consequences if you fail me.<eos> Come.<eos> We must seal our arrangement in the eyes of the Gods.<eos> As Hecate is our witness, you will not cross me.<eos> You will know when the time is right to strike.<eos> Until then, may your injury serve as a reminder of your oath.<eos> Where will I find your sister?<eos> In the Palace Of Atlantis.<eos> Where she is Queen.<eos> Pythagoras?
Found out the cash came from a bank-robbery gang run by the owner, Elijah Banner, and his girlfriend.<eos> There's our mystery woman from the bank.<eos> Elijah told me to rent a safe deposit box there so she and I could case the place.<eos> Oh, were you casing her, too?<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> Boss, she's like a cat.<eos> When she found out...<eos> Hello, Diane.<eos> Oh, I heard we broke up.<eos> Sorry about that.
Do you have Donna's pre-op labs?<eos> In process.<eos> I'm gonna go examine Dr. Webber.<eos> And when I get back, we're gonna get started on the printer.<eos> Is that okay with you?<eos> Pfft, what was that about?<eos> I got her kicked off her own surgery a few days ago.<eos> Alex told me.<eos> Ballsy.<eos> Stupid.
Okay, screw it.<eos> How about we get takeout chicken and eat it in the car like we were raised to do?<eos> I think I love you.<eos> Yeah, yeah, settle down.<eos> Two more women responded to the ad.<eos> One of them's gonna come by in about half an hour.<eos> Did she seem nice?<eos> I told Stan.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
What kind of bugs are these, huh?<eos> What do they do?<eos> Randy?<eos> We don't... it doesn't have a name.<eos> W-we derived it from Sitodiplosis mosellana.<eos> - What does it do?<eos> - It's a pest.<eos> It eats crops.<eos> - What kind of crops?<eos> - Wheat.
Would have rather played baseball, but there wasn't anything like that then.<eos> So, you never played?<eos> Nothing official, just pick-up games in our neighborhood.<eos> Now I play in my company's intramural league.<eos> She won't let me go to the games.<eos> He gets too excited.<eos> - Well, it's exciting.<eos> - You do!<eos> So... So, where are you two from?<eos> Chicago.
Well, I know he talks to a girl named Kira.<eos> Kira...<eos> But I've also heard "Wendy." Wow. You guys have been traveling a lot.<eos> It's what we were talking to you about...<eos> The, uh, grain thing.<eos> We're, um, developing some new sources, and unfortunately, it takes some travel to get to them.<eos> You go separately, though.<eos> Sometimes we need to get to know different people.<eos> So, who are you getting to know?<eos> Um... a scientist...
I would be scared of someone finding out.<eos> Yeah, I guess a lot of its just, um, confidence.<eos> Listen...<eos> Uh, when I was at Pastor Tim's babysitting...<eos> I found his diary.<eos> - Paige...<eos> - I just thought that if<eos> I could find that lawyer's name...<eos> - No.<eos> - ...with the tape...
11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> All right?<eos> Y-Yes.<eos> To old scars and new skin.<eos> How long were you in for?<eos> 12 years.<eos> You? Seven.<eos> Collateral damage?<eos> Just me.<eos> How 'bout you?
Not really.<eos> Are you tired of me?<eos> What?<eos> We haven't been alone in almost two weeks.<eos> We've both been busy.<eos> We live across the street from each other, Paige.<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> D-Do you want to break up with me?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Of what?
You understand?<eos> I do.<eos> It must be very hard, but if you love him, you must forget this.<eos> You cannot see him.<eos> - Forget father?<eos> - No. Not here.<eos> I will get you home.<eos> You will be safe.<eos> But you cannot see your father here.<eos> Maybe someday, but not here.
Maybe someday, but not here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Paige is at a church thing.<eos> - At the food pantry?<eos> - No.<eos> Um, Henry's studying at Chris' house.<eos> Oh, a boy Chris or a girl Chris?
You cannot see him.<eos> But then, what was Morozov doing at that greenhouse?<eos> They're using strains of wheat from all over the world, and no one knows more about Soviet wheat than Morozov.<eos> And Stobert just wants to end world hunger-- like Miss America.<eos> Jesus.<eos> So, the laboratory worker-- how's Philip taking it?<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> How's he taking it, Elizabeth?<eos> The same as me-- it's upsetting.<eos> For me, too.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, there are guards inside, and we don't know what kind of countersurveillance the CIA might have on the building.<eos> So, we go again Friday this week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday next.<eos> - No Thursdays, right?
Did he ever kill anyone?<eos> People who were trying to escape?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You saw his file.<eos> I never saw records like that.<eos> Some guards were cruel.<eos> Some were kind.<eos> I didn't know your father.<eos> Who'd he work for?<eos> Us.
But we still don't have a murder weapon.<eos> Well... we know she was hit with something long and blunt, right?<eos> Yeah...?<eos> We know he was coming from golf.<eos> Go on.<eos> Which means... he probably had his golf clubs with him.<eos> I'm interested.<eos> He used one of them... to kill her.<eos> Keep goin'.<eos> Jeremiah! Oh, for [bleep] sake!
He cares about you.<eos> He cares about you, too.<eos> He knows, like, everything about me.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we told him, over the years.<eos> I remember the day you started first grade.<eos> He said, "You need a pencil, a notebook, and a brain.<eos> You buy her the first two.<eos> She has plenty of the third."<eos> You remember that stuffed tiger you used to hide in your bookbag?<eos> Jesse?
I mean... nobody cares though.<eos> Everybody go out to lunch sometimes.<eos> You need to be able to tell them where you ate, what you ate, who you ate with, and why you picked that place to eat.<eos> But... nobody ask me all of that.<eos> You have to be prepared if they do ask.<eos> You don't want to appear nervous.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where do you usually eat?<eos> I like pizza.<eos> At Armand's.
Yes.<eos> We'll take care of that for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will do a good job for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you repeat what you'll tell anyone who asks where you were?<eos> I went to lunch.<eos> I got my pizza.<eos> At Armand's.
Did he say anything else?<eos> His report is on the way. Tuan never came home.<eos> I called the Morozovs around 10:00.<eos> He wasn't with Pasha.<eos> I waited until 3:00 AM.<eos> He could be out with those new kids, but...<eos> What? I don't know.<eos> Out in the middle of the night...<eos> What, you think he's reporting on us?<eos> To who?
I waited until 3:00 AM.<eos> He could be out with those new kids, but...<eos> What? I don't know.<eos> Out in the middle of the night...<eos> What, you think he's reporting on us?<eos> To who?<eos> His people?<eos> The Centre talked to them.<eos> I know.<eos> Not the Americans.
With his mom mostly.<eos> You know we're not, uh...<eos> I know.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, she's in charge of all that.<eos> W-Well, it's-- it's nice of you to come.<eos> It's been, um, quiet since the funeral. Have you been...<eos> seeing friends?<eos> Getting support?<eos> Some.
_<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
Don't tell anyone.<eos> I can't have my people finding out about it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I believe him.<eos> Do you?<eos> If we report it, would they send him back to Vietnam?<eos> I don't know.<eos> M-Maybe that's what he wants.<eos> What?
Bad enough that his mom would want to take him home to Moscow?<eos> It could work.<eos> Kvass.<eos> Best I ever made.<eos> Mm. I like it.<eos> Mm? Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice here when nobody home.<eos> Peaceful.<eos> No fights...
I mean, helps that we never see each other...<eos> What about Tuan?<eos> You... have nice relationship with him?<eos> Mm. Sure.<eos> I mean, I-I know he looks pretty even-tempered, but, um, Tuan can be a handful.<eos> Me and Pasha, you know, we fight all the time.<eos> - You see this, right? - Mm.<eos> But now?<eos> No fights.<eos> He just quiet.
Oh, good.<eos> There is a man...<eos> We're getting closer, and-- is getting better.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> Good for you.<eos> So, who's the lucky guy?<eos> He is a very famous man in Soviet Union.<eos> Gennadi Bystrov.<eos> He was a defenseman.<eos> Of Soviet national team.
- Sure.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - The Soviet national team.<eos> - We know.<eos> He is really nice and friendly.<eos> Last time, when he came to United States, uh, he, uh, brought the gift for my boy.<eos> Hockey... shirt.<eos> My boy loves it.<eos> Oh, he visits you here?<eos> Bystrov?
- The Soviet national team.<eos> - We know.<eos> He is really nice and friendly.<eos> Last time, when he came to United States, uh, he, uh, brought the gift for my boy.<eos> Hockey... shirt.<eos> My boy loves it.<eos> Oh, he visits you here?<eos> Bystrov?<eos> Yes, he carries package over.<eos> For government.
Anything else I should know about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> There are peace groups, international religious councils.<eos> Do you want me to look into it?<eos> We'll let you know.<eos> Um, the Centre analyzed the wheat sample you sent.<eos> They say it's remarkable.<eos> They suspect it was bred partly from a Kazakh variety, which is surprising.<eos> Stolen.<eos> From us.
This is everything.<eos> Birth certificates, Social Security cards, driver's licenses.<eos> Marriage license.<eos> You want to make it official?<eos> So... keep in mind, I didn't have many options.<eos> Gabriel ran this guy for years.<eos> And he's from home.<eos> This is Father Andrei.<eos> You look different.<eos> No mustache.
Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'm not yet used to it.<eos> But... it's... it's very good.<eos> He want to talk with you.<eos> - Okay... - Only to say... that I... that I understand what is going on.<eos> And I am not political.<eos> And...<eos> Your country, my country... for me, important, you know, both sides try to understand and get along.<eos> No war.
Two months.<eos> Paige feels good about it.<eos> Good.<eos> We've been talking about whether it's time... for us to end our tour here.<eos> I understand.<eos> I've found when officers start to think seriously about it, it's usually time.<eos> When you're ready, I'll have the Centre start putting things in place.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It takes two or three years to really adjust.<eos> Longer for the kids, of course.
What about your pastor?<eos> Paige is open to finding a new place for him.<eos> That's very good news.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll see what we can do.<eos> The Centre thinks they might have found a woman named Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk, who they've been looking for for years.<eos> A collaborator who was on a Nazi execution squad.<eos> Here?<eos> She personally shot hundreds of our boys.<eos> Prisoners.
They used to line them up around a pit at the edge of town... in Dyatkovo.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Newton, Massachusetts.<eos> Her husband was a medic in the American army.<eos> They met in Germany after the War.<eos> She's been living under the name of Natalie Granholm since the '50s.<eos> But we're not-- we're not sure it's her?<eos> They can't find any exit documents matching the maiden name she used when she came to America.<eos> And any photos of her were destroyed during the occupation.<eos> Except for this.
I think if he wants to go, he should go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just thought... he's doing really good now.<eos> All this math stuff.<eos> A girlfriend.<eos> It's all just... working out.<eos> If he gets in, he'll be there for a couple of months, back home, then gone for another couple of months, and back home again...<eos> Yeah.<eos> They like each other.<eos> Good for them.
Not one sound.<eos> I don't have much money.<eos> You can have what there is.<eos> In my purse.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> Take it.<eos> All of it.<eos> This isn't about money.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The truth.
I'm not this person, whoever she is.<eos> Where were you born?<eos> Russia.<eos> You think I knew this person from Russia?<eos> What can I say? Uh...<eos> I haven't lived there for forty years.<eos> Where in Russia?<eos> Where "what?"<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Sevsk.
I don't know this person, this Anna, whoever she is.<eos> Prokopchuk.<eos> Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk.<eos> Who is she?<eos> What did she do to you?<eos> You think she's me?<eos> No, you-- you-- you mistaken.<eos> I swear you mistaken.<eos> My name is Natalie Granholm.<eos> From Sevsk. I'm-
- I-I- - It's not me.<eos> I swear it's not me.<eos> I am a wife, I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother.<eos> I lived in this house for twenty-five ye--<eos> You're a traitor!<eos> - You betrayed your own people! - No.<eos> Never.<eos> You slaughtered your own people.<eos> - That's not true--<eos> - Young boys-- - No.
I swear it's not me.<eos> I am a wife, I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother.<eos> I lived in this house for twenty-five ye--<eos> You're a traitor!<eos> - You betrayed your own people! - No.<eos> Never.<eos> You slaughtered your own people.<eos> - That's not true--<eos> - Young boys-- - No.<eos> - Soldiers--
- That's not true--<eos> - Young boys-- - No.<eos> - Soldiers--<eos> Brave men who were fighting, unlike you--<eos> You took them to the edge of town and you shot them and you dumped them in a pit.<eos> - No, never, never. I--<eos> - You did this over and over again, we know--<eos> You have the blood of over a thousand soldiers - on your hands. - No, no, no.<eos> I'm Natalya Konina.<eos> From Sevsk.
He should be home soon.<eos> John?<eos> Why?<eos> You think he knows something about this woman?<eos> He's never been to Russia.<eos> He- - He cannot tell you anything...<eos> He's a good man.<eos> It's all true, what you said.<eos> I'm Anna Prokopchuk.<eos> From Dyatkovo.
Why?<eos> I worked with the Nazis.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Where...?<eos> Where did you murder them?<eos> In Dyatkovo.<eos> Where?<eos> Edge of- - Edge of the town, like you said.<eos> Exactly where?<eos> What side of the town?
I was sixteen.<eos> I didn't know anything about world.<eos> About anything.<eos> They let me live.<eos> Why?<eos> There was no reason.<eos> Nothing made any sense.<eos> They gave me food.<eos> I was obedient.<eos> Helpless.
Why?<eos> There was no reason.<eos> Nothing made any sense.<eos> They gave me food.<eos> I was obedient.<eos> Helpless.<eos> The first time, they gave me so much to drink, I could barely stand up.<eos> The first time?<eos> That I shot them.<eos> Soviet prisoners.
Um, our people will be seconds away if you're in any trouble at all.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Could be worse.<eos> Could be the French and Indian War.<eos> We're tracking her now.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - She stopped.<eos> Move in now.<eos> Inside! Inside!
So I'm gonna destroy it.<eos> And I hope to God you and Rufus... will blow up yours, too. There'll be people who don't want you to.<eos> Don't trust them.<eos> And don't trust Connor Mason.<eos> So I'm just supposed to believe everything that you're telling me right now?<eos> Tell your government agent to turn on her satellites.<eos> When you see an explosion in Oakland... you'll know I've destroyed the Mothership.<eos> And I got to believe you'll do the right thing, too.<eos> Grab the power pellet to your right.<eos> - No, the other right. - Okay, okay.
Besides the predatory schmucks?<eos> - I used to love it.<eos> - Yeah? Yeah, I mean, I joined 'cause I wanted to see the world.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Well, so far, I've seen Columbus, Milwaukee, Rockford, Chicago a couple of times.<eos> - I know. Really glamorous, right?<eos> Pays the bills.<eos> So if you could do anything, what would you do?<eos> - I'd go home.<eos> - To Cleveland?
Hey, there's... there's flooding.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - In the kitchen.<eos> There's water everywhere.<eos> It's spreading.<eos> Let me just go and check on this.<eos> Your sister okay?<eos> I don't know. Phone lines are down.<eos> She, lives in a double wide with her kid.<eos> No basement.
We will have 12 posts, braided palm leaves.<eos> You'll never feel exposed again.<eos> I'm gonna be rich.<eos> Fuck you, Gilfoyle.<eos> - Do pizza.<eos> - Yes, do pizza.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do pizza.<eos> Pizza.<eos> "Not hot dog"?
- Yeah.<eos> - Do pizza.<eos> Pizza.<eos> "Not hot dog"?<eos> - Wait. What the fuck?<eos> - Huh?<eos> That's... that's it? It only does hot dogs?<eos> No, and "not hot dog."<eos> Give me that. Give it to me.<eos> _
Pizza.<eos> "Not hot dog"?<eos> - Wait. What the fuck?<eos> - Huh?<eos> That's... that's it? It only does hot dogs?<eos> No, and "not hot dog."<eos> Give me that. Give it to me.<eos> _<eos> Jian-Yang.<eos> Motherfuck.
- Great.<eos> And... what exactly are you working on?<eos> Oh, you know, we're tuning... classifier from food to... another purpose.<eos> We're reconfiguring our... Uh-huh.<eos> In other words, you sit around and look at dick pics all day long.<eos> Don't let me stop you.<eos> I would say, "Not safe for work," but this is your work... for a year... at least.<eos> Is that one... actually a hot dog?<eos> No.<eos> Not hot dog.
No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That sounds awesome.<eos> But it's probably nothing compared to the thousands upon thousands of gnarled male genitals that you get to see every day at your job.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Brought you some dinner, 'Neshi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> "'Neshi"?
You fuckin' liar!<eos> You said you had a degree in CS.<eos> Well, bullshit.<eos> I checked.<eos> It's not Computer Science.<eos> It's "Calisthenic Studies."<eos> What? What?<eos> You listen to me, you muscle-bound, handsome Adonis.<eos> Tech is reserved for people like me. Okay?<eos> The freaks, the weirdos, the misfits, the geeks, the dweebs, the dorks!

We need him engaged.<eos> I made the call.<eos> Well, sometimes you have to make compromises.<eos> I mean, I once slept with the head of an assisted-living facility to get my friend Muriel bumped up the wait list.<eos> Am I proud of it?<eos> No.<eos> Do I regret it?<eos> I'm out!<eos> Oh! Out of what exactly?<eos> My relationship!
Yeah, I guess that makes him crazy.<eos> The point is, if you don't draw the line in the sand when some guy pisses in your car, where do you, you know?<eos> Did someone piss in someone's car?<eos> Not literally, no. It's a, It's a figure of speech, an old one.<eos> An adage.<eos> Anyway, Jared, let's get a deck together on this.<eos> Aye, aye, Captain.<eos> And, just word to the wise, often the first customer is the hardest one to land.<eos> Wait.<eos> Customer?
Both of you.<eos> Listen, I think I know what he's gonna say, but let me see if I can pull my CTO in here.<eos> Can you... reel it in a little?<eos> We're trying to make a business deal, not get you laid.<eos> I'm not trying to get laid, Richard.<eos> Clearly, she has a lot of pent-up sexual energy, likely from working in this worm farm, so that's the angle I'm taking since I'm not allowed to have a seizure.<eos> Besides, she's going to bat for us.<eos> You should be thanking me.<eos> The CTO is on the way in.<eos> Yes, because of the technology and because of our business proposal.
We're reviewing it all tomorrow, actually.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> Tomorrow the real fun begins.<eos> No. No.<eos> You're not coming.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, you fucked Dan's last wife the night before he was our judge on the TechCrunch panel, with absolutely no regard for what that meant to the company.<eos> What it meant to the company was that we went to the finals, and we won.<eos> Because of the tech.
If there's an upside to any of this, it would be that I realize now what I have in Dan.<eos> Silver lining, so that's nice.<eos> Listen, I can't do this... anymore.<eos> If we could just close the deal, be done with it.<eos> Yeah. So, I just wanna...<eos> And if it's okay with Dan, it's fine with me.<eos> Good.<eos> So, I will come back and get my stuff when you're gone.<eos> No, I'm just gonna...<eos> the door. To...
He should be okay for at least a few more hours.<eos> Well, that's probably longer than we'll be in business.<eos> Yeah, we got our first past-due notice from Azure.<eos> They said we have five business days till they cut us off.<eos> If you guys wanna feel worse... check this out.<eos> Come join us for an epic gathering where we come together as one people, as visionaries.<eos> Is this not the most exciting time to be in technology?<eos> The whole thing is just like, "Wow."<eos> The most transformative technology event in the world.<eos> Hoolicon.
- No.<eos> - There's a computer in the library that's not supervised on Sundays.<eos> I think if I can pull library duty, I'll be able to sneak on and track down whoever ratted me out.<eos> I am going to destroy that motherfucker.<eos> Not if I destroy him first.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's your policy on anonymous tips?<eos> Fuck. Wi-Fi Pineapples.<eos> It's so obvious.<eos> Not to me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You acted like you wanted to take Keenan Feldspar's offer.<eos> Well, I just ran into him.<eos> He said you turned him down.<eos> Okay, well... Who are you going to believe, me or him?<eos> Him.<eos> He showed me the e-mail you sent him.<eos> Showed you the e-mail?<eos> You fucking snake.
I'm just gonna... go to them.<eos> All right.<eos> She's going to them.<eos> - Never get married, Richard.<eos> - Women, right?<eos> - I'll talk to you.<eos> Yes. - Bye.<eos> We'll go to them.<eos> Guys, we'll go to them.<eos> - Who?
You've killed my battery.<eos> I don't feel the slightest bit more spiritually centered.<eos> Can this thing go any faster?<eos> - Richard.<eos> - Oh. Yeah.<eos> Okay. Thank you, Jared.<eos> Uh, so, what... what time did Big Head say he needed us there?<eos> I don't know. He said whenever.<eos> Typically, campus security requires a specific window<eos> - for deliveries of this size.
Are you sure? We don't want to inconvenience you.<eos> It's no trouble at all, and there's no need to send a negotiator.<eos> I'm in Tibet.<eos> It's right next door.<eos> Well, we'd be grateful to have this in such good hands.<eos> We've missed you, Gavin.<eos> Perhaps when you return, we...<eos> The only thing I'm concerned with right now is bringing our boy home safe.<eos> Fuck you, Jack Barker!<eos> Hey. Opium?
So instead of going through the magical dismemberment door, let's go through the back way.<eos> That door isn't just a door.<eos> It's a portal to another world.<eos> That's where the poison room is.<eos> - So if we find the right fountain...?<eos> - We can walk right in.<eos> I heard a couple librarians whispering about it.<eos> The poison room fountain has a stack of books for a statue.<eos> If we split up, we could probably find it within a matter of weeks.<eos> - Weeks?
Like Ember, like, just like Ember.<eos> - What?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> Umber?<eos> - In the flesh.<eos> - Are they in the eye of...<eos> What even is that? - Lightning storm, huge.<eos> Happened every time Persephone ascended from the underworld.<eos> She used to come every spring.<eos> Now, decades, no pattern, no trace.
- Food run.<eos> Listen, I wish we had time to talk this through, but ultimately, I know you'd agree with me.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Ahh, ahh, oh, my wards.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Why, why are you doing this to me?<eos> - After everything Julia's been through, I can't make her do this.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - This is very good.<eos> Tea?
What happened to "there's no fate but what we make"?<eos> - If you carry me back, you die too, penny.<eos> I read it.<eos> Leaving me is the only way you have a chance.<eos> - Penny.<eos> - I got your book.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Penny?<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Help!
- So uh, funny story, uh, your... your dad is actually a rat person now.<eos> - Do it.<eos> - He's...<eos> - break it down.<eos> - Hakuna matata has failed me.<eos> - It pains me, but I simply cannot go back to Fillory.<eos> - So you're just gonna let Ember turn Fillory into a telenovela?<eos> - Well, you don't understand how he is.<eos> He pitted animals against each other by offering only the sexiest the ability to speak.<eos> Centaurs?
- So you've got time.<eos> Kill it with me killing Reynard.<eos> Good news, found a spell in here.<eos> Turns metal objects into god-piercing weapons.<eos> And if it can be anything, gun, right?<eos> But it took everything John gave us just to make one bullet.<eos> - So we've got one shot.<eos> - Fall back.<eos> Don't inhale the...<eos> Smoke...
The world's a better place when you're in it.<eos> Say the word, and I'll stay.<eos> If you want me to leave you alone for a while and figure this out on your own, I mean, let's face it.<eos> There's probably nothing that you can't figure out.<eos> You are Alice Quinn.<eos> - Okay, so the plan so far is, find a way to stay in Fillory and never get banished again.<eos> Find a way to stop Ember or drive him out or, I don't know, anything but letting him get so bored he decides to just shake the etch a sketch and end our kingdom, everyone I care about, and the well spring in the process.<eos> So, thoughts?<eos> - You're talking about conquering Fillory.<eos> - For its own good.
Primary door is jammed.<eos> Check the wiring.<eos> Yeah, wiring's fun.<eos> León shorted it.<eos> Primary exit is blown.<eos> Proceed to secondary.<eos> In position and standing by.<eos> - Camacho clear.<eos> - Booth clear.<eos> - Brady clear.
So if you can't make people look the other way, you don't deserve to be here, but if you can misdirect someone for just a second, the right second, then you can commit an act of treason.<eos> That's exactly what you did today.<eos> Remember that line I told you about when you first started training here?<eos> You've just crossed it.<eos> You could've helped me today.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> I could have.<eos> You almost got me thrown out.<eos> You called him my friend.<eos> Who?
That's exactly what you did today.<eos> Remember that line I told you about when you first started training here?<eos> You've just crossed it.<eos> You could've helped me today.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> I could have.<eos> You almost got me thrown out.<eos> You called him my friend.<eos> Who?<eos> Elliot.
- in a safe place.<eos> - And let me guess.<eos> You're the only one who knows where they are.<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid a terrorist has found them, the same person who kidnapped Will Olsen.<eos> And if they manage to upload those drives to whomever's waiting for them, it'll make a hostage crisis at the G-20 look like the best news all day.<eos> Please, Alex, you're the only one I can trust to go back in.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the person still inside is your old roommate...<eos> Dayana Mampasi.
Yeah?<eos> Does it come with a raise?<eos> Is your hair supposed to look like that?<eos> Yeah... pretty much.<eos> No, no, no. I like it.<eos> Detective Ryder...<eos> What makes a town?<eos> For my retrospective I picked Sandy Driver.<eos> Born in 1980.<eos> A Gemini.
Says he can help with the missing kid.<eos> Annie, your dad is gone.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> He'll still watch you grow.<eos> He'll just do it from heaven.<eos> "A cowboy rides into town on Friday."<eos> Stays for three days and leaves on Friday.<eos> How did he do it?<eos> Love, dad.<eos> "PS.
Hey, you can't do this!<eos> Who gave you the note?<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> I was here, in a stall.<eos> He gave me 50 bucks!<eos> What did he say about Jesse?<eos> That he could help.<eos> That's it! If you're lying, I'll fucking drown you.<eos> Get out!<eos> Crime stoppers.
Religious figure beckoning towards the side that's male.<eos> Could be the person who put it here did something to Jesse.<eos> Saw something.<eos> Okay. Process it. And get it out of here.<eos> It's from the nativity scene.<eos> Trans versus religion?<eos> Jesse religious?<eos> Maybe caught in the middle.<eos> You're here about...?<eos> Jesse Sweetland.
He couldn't even decide if he knew him or not.<eos> He was jumpy.<eos> He was wanting to put distance between Jesse and the church.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, so what does porn and religion have to do with each other?<eos> Because the blood is Jesse's.<eos> Maybe the cross isn't religion.<eos> Is it an X?<eos> Cross dressing?
Where is he? !<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> So yesterday, when I asked you if you knew Jesse, you said no.<eos> I said no, he didn't have a relationship with the church,<eos> - try as we might.<eos> - Semantics?<eos> A kid's missing.<eos> What did you talk to Maggie about, Father?<eos> It was a kind of talk therapy that focuses on reorientation and healing.<eos> Healing?
We talked a few times.<eos> You ever talk about gender?<eos> A little. In a vague way.<eos> He didn't seem ready to talk about it directly.<eos> What about in self reference.<eos> Does Jesse go by she?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> I think Jesse is still figuring it all out.<eos> You have visitors.<eos> Quiet down.
"If she tells, she never learns the truth about either."<eos> Shit!<eos> Remember me.<eos> Holly, you got hurt.<eos> You're ripped.<eos> "The more you take away, the larger it becomes."<eos> "A hole."<eos> Sandy Driver, fingernails missing from hands.<eos> Fingernails not recovered.<eos> What the hell?
Hi, I'm Dr. Julie Sullivan.<eos> Dr. Li was called away on a family emergency, and I'll be covering for him for the next few days.<eos> And now Meghan has a new doctor, Julie Sullivan.<eos> It's the same woman I tried to save 20 years ago.<eos> I think it's a sign.<eos> I need to start my work again.<eos> And I saw her daughter too.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I've been rotting in this hole for the last 20 years.<eos> For you.
No, you go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna watch the Jets highlights and head home.<eos> No, no, no, you're the man of the year here.<eos> Ah, come on, you know how I hate being in the middle of those things.<eos> Besides, it feels good to just sit here.<eos> Be normal.<eos> And, hey, I take my eyes off the Jets, and their season's a disasterpiece.<eos> So I got to, you know...<eos> All right, man.<eos> Bright and early?
I came all the way down here because you said that we could move things down the field.<eos> Now... are you gonna take a taste back to your people or not?<eos> Shinwell.<eos> Say something... or get the hell out of my car.<eos> Is that peanut butter and jelly and smooth jazz?<eos> I thought you were down here trying to find Decker's accomplice.<eos> I am.<eos> Well, then isn't it time to turn up the thrash metal, dangle from gravity boots, or, I don't know, maybe snack on the world's stinkiest cheese to shock the senses?<eos> Trying something even more radical this evening:<eos> Boredom.
What was that?<eos> May I?<eos> When people go to the grocery store, they tend to buy their favorite brands, right?<eos> It doesn't matter if they're in their own neighborhood or if on the other side of the country.<eos> People buy what they know.<eos> So you're saying our accomplice likes soy milk?<eos> Not just soy milk, this brand of soy milk.<eos> Carrie Traub was drinking coffee when I went to see her at ICE.<eos> She had soy creamer at her desk.<eos> The same brand as this one.
Oh, come on!<eos> This is, uh... this is a shakedown.<eos> Step aside, Braveheart.<eos> Alison, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm loving my neighbours, Eileen, and try not to judge.<eos> And we all miss her.<eos> Hi, Chad.<eos> Hi, Jake. Hi, Esme.<eos> We... we... Pff, I haven't seen you since...<eos> - The funeral, yeah.
You're so normal.<eos> You golf and you watch TV and you... commute!<eos> Sometimes, you look at me so strangely.<eos> It's like our entire life is a lie.<eos> I... googled "bad mushroom trip"<eos> and it said, in a couple of hours, you should be right back to normal, OK?<eos> - Uh-oh!<eos> - Oh, my God! - Bad energy in here.<eos> - Oh, my God! - Alison is no bueno right now.<eos> Oh, sweetie, no.
But I've been in this fight since the beginning with Beth, even before Sarah, and I'm in it for the long haul.<eos> Well, looks like we're missing something.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Dr. Leekie pushed Donnie over the edge, and he didn't have basic firearm safety.<eos> Aldous Leekie is buried in your garage?<eos> Minus the head which was donated to science.<eos> For most of my life, I hated Aldous.<eos> But I chose not to kill him.<eos> The other body, who is it?<eos> A Castor.
He hasn't even placed a bet yet.<eos> Well, if Patton's right, he's not just here as a spectator.<eos> No sign of any movement from Garcia yet, King.<eos> Went straight to his box.<eos> Maybe he's got more money hidden somewhere than we know.<eos> Yeah, still, he's at the track for a reason.<eos> He's gotta be there to make a bet, doesn't he?<eos> Except he doesn't have to place a bet at the track if he's gonna bet OTB.<eos> - OT what?<eos> - Off-track betting.
Well, I don't really know how much of a help I can be since I don't really know the man.<eos> Well, you know him well enough to share his box at the track on the same day that Eliza West gets buried.<eos> And the implication is?<eos> Garcia's made a lot of high-level inroads in New Orleans quickly.<eos> We both know that can't happen without your help.<eos> The kind that probably wouldn't stand up to FBI scrutiny.<eos> Uh, I'm the mayor.<eos> I attract business.<eos> That's my job.<eos> Just like every other mayor before me.
Just make sure they don't mess up my van.<eos> How concerned are you?<eos> I'd be less concerned if he wasn't in denial about how hard this is for him.<eos> But I'll keep an eye on him.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> Garcia just entered.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Hard to believe nobody here is gonna know the race is already over with.<eos> Yeah, except us...
He may be struggling, but he's still at OTB, still game.<eos> Look, if you want to blame yourself for anything, do it for surrounding yourself with people who are just as stubborn and bullheaded as you.<eos> Besides, you're not the only one who wants to make Garcia pay;<eos> we all do.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> That's how you taught us to roll.<eos> So, are you in or are you out?<eos> Wake up, there he is.<eos> No Sebastian.

Where'd you think the $2 million came from?<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Still not sure.<eos> Did I get it legally?<eos> No.<eos> Debatable.<eos> Lucky for FBI,<eos> Garcia's waived his rights, he wants to confess.<eos> Confess to what?<eos> Everything.
I also have to learn how to shoot a gun without freezing.<eos> Bygones.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Thanks, guys...<eos> Hey, wait, wait, hold up,<eos> I know y'all didn't just toast - without Triple P.<eos> - You kidding?<eos> The ringleader of the sting?<eos> In fact... we've been waiting on you. Waiting for what?<eos> Happy birthday!
You tell Eli: either we get the new price or we take our business elsewhere.<eos> Eli Voss will never agree to that deal.<eos> If I'm foolish enough to bring him that offer, he would...<eos> H-h-hello?<eos> Hello, Mr. Crowbar?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> How did you find me? Your book.<eos> Remember?<eos> Names, times, addresses?<eos> Reimer's Cold Storage.
We send it.<eos> On time or else.<eos> So we come up with another idea, OK?<eos> I got a friend in the DEA.<eos> We work with her, and we can throw a giant net over Eli Voss.<eos> The Drug Enforcement Agency, why them? Why not your own boss?<eos> I have some concerns, you know?<eos> Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I think<eos> Voss might have somebody working on the inside of my shop.<eos> - Among the police? - Yeah.
- Especially me.<eos> I didn't lose the phone, Jay, OK?<eos> Somebody lost it for me.<eos> Whatever you say, man.<eos> Goddammit!<eos> I forgot to bring in the wood.<eos> I'll get it! Sit!<eos> Sit!<eos> I have decided the funeral will be on Friday<eos> for the men in the airplane.
But listen, I have a plan, OK?<eos> We'll get Voss up to Canada, and we can throw a net on him up here.<eos> If I do this, I'm gonna have to call in a massive favour.<eos> I have friends inside the Aduana, but this is gonna cost me big.<eos> And I'm supposed to burn all that good will on a Mennonite pastor and an ex-cop who "lacks credibility"?<eos> Agent O'Reilly, my ass is hanging out the window and I need your help.<eos> Emma, I can't find her.<eos> Tina!<eos> We'll have to go without her.<eos> Ezekiel?
That's Gerry's phone?<eos> What the hell was Joey doing with it?<eos> These are the contacts on it.<eos> First names and numbers of all the people. I wrote them into my book.<eos> I've contacted all of them. Yeah, well, except for the third one.<eos> What? "Balia"?<eos> - Belial.<eos> - Belial. Why not? Why didn't you call?<eos> It's the name of a devil.<eos> Like, like the real devil?
But the breeze is cold in paradise I can feel the whispers in the street<eos> Every night I shiver in my sleep<eos> No reality, cause it's all a dream<eos> I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy<eos> Allo!<eos> Hi! Yes, this is Georgina Clios. I'm here to see Christos.<eos> He isn't here, I'm afraid.<eos> Can you tell him, again, that I am trying to reach him?<eos> Of course.<eos> Goodbye.
I see.<eos> 90,000 Euros for this gentleman here, 95!<eos> 95 thousand Euros here!<eos> Now, do I see one hundred thousand Euros?<eos> Get it out!<eos> One hundred thousand Euros!<eos> One hundred thousand Euros! Gone to the man in the fine spectacles and now to the most coveted soprano in the world!<eos> You got him to talk yet?<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> Mrs. Clios...
It won't be long now.<eos> Mrs. Clios...<eos> Are we nearly there?<eos> We'll wait until the Service gates open.<eos> Enter the property from both sides.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> No.<eos> So?<eos> Boy trouble?<eos> Not exactly.
You should see her designs.<eos> They're incredible.<eos> What kind of clothing?<eos> You know, elevated but wearable.<eos> That sounds fun.<eos> It is.<eos> It's a-a fun, nonprofit, social-impact brand that empowers artisans from Peru and Uganda.<eos> And I just got an angel investor who wants to give me the next round of funding.<eos> Problem is, he's an old classmate of hers from Princeton.<eos> From Princeton?
Where are you going?<eos> And can I come with you?<eos> To cripple Argosy, we need to take down its leader, Billy McLeland.<eos> That's him, t-there with Eddie.<eos> Very handsome.<eos> - Do you think?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're looking at six-month-old surveillance photos taken before the FBI bust.<eos> Eddie's team arrested six of McLeland's lieutenants.<eos> But no McLeland.
Well, you brought this on yourself.<eos> How did I do that?<eos> The whole point of breaking up with someone is so you never have to see them again... or their fiancees.<eos> How would you feel if I was hanging out with Margot all the time?<eos> But you just spent an entire day and night with her.<eos> Because we suddenly share a child.<eos> Who is approaching my office with a look on her face.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Tessa and I just did a search for Charles Bergman.<eos> Gretchen's angel investor?
It instantly brought me back to my grandmother's kitchen.<eos> Um, Gretchen.<eos> Is there someplace private that we could talk?<eos> Sweatshops?<eos> I knew it was too good to be true.<eos> I just knew it.<eos> At least you found out before the contracts were signed.<eos> So none of this will reflect badly on your business.<eos> What business?<eos> Without the money...
Look how easy it was for Tessa to find them.<eos> It wasn't easy.<eos> I am warning Ethan.<eos> No. Stop.<eos> You're not doing that.<eos> I have to.<eos> Do you not think your judgment might be a little clouded by your own experience?<eos> These just arrived, Allie.<eos> Wow! Thank you, Robin.<eos> From Ben?
It wasn't easy.<eos> I am warning Ethan.<eos> No. Stop.<eos> You're not doing that.<eos> I have to.<eos> Do you not think your judgment might be a little clouded by your own experience?<eos> These just arrived, Allie.<eos> Wow! Thank you, Robin.<eos> From Ben?<eos> Mnh. From Ethan.
And anyway, I already gave up on trying to reform this country long ago.<eos> You see... all your guests are loitering around.<eos> So I request you to continue your business deal in the room.<eos> Yeah!<eos> See... that's all I wanted to say.<eos> Do you like pudding?<eos> No.<eos> Do try, it's really delicious.<eos> I guarantee you will love it.<eos> Good bye.
Come.<eos> Uncle, this cylinder...<eos> Yeah, I have a bit of...<eos> What do you call your company?<eos> It's a unique name.<eos> Our work is unique too.<eos> I saw both your daughters at Prakash's wedding.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> If you could give me their bio-data and birth-chart... I will find suitable grooms for them immediately.<eos> Both of them?
If father fixes my marriage with someone else... then I'll have to spend the rest of my life looking at her picture.<eos> And who needs two love-lost Romeos in one house?<eos> My brother is enough.<eos> I am looking to get married.<eos> Now do one thing... take this bio-data to my father.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> I am not going to stick my head into the lion's den.<eos> Then who will?<eos> Speak up.<eos> Mr. Romeo...
We've been circulating your bio-data for three years now.<eos> Even Kritika has rejected some pretty good proposals... because of her stubbornness.<eos> Good proposals stop coming with age.<eos> They are not the right guys, papa.<eos> Dear, even you can't distinguish between right and wrong.<eos> I will be retiring after two years.<eos> And I want to see you two get married before that.<eos> I've spoken with my bosses.<eos> They will lend me the money against my house.<eos> Without any interest.
They will lend me the money against my house.<eos> Without any interest.<eos> And I will repay the debt somehow.<eos> Papa, as soon as I get a job... we'll repay all your debts.<eos> I don't want your money, dear.<eos> Just stop looking for a job.<eos> And get married.<eos> Let Kritika get married too.<eos> Just do me this one favor.<eos> Wow...
Think about Kritika.<eos> I am out of my wits thinking about her.<eos> Why don't you look for some NRI?<eos> Excuse me, I am not a traitor.<eos> My own brothers are still bachelors.<eos> You're quite a patriot.<eos> Yes... I am.<eos> Found it!<eos> What'?<eos> Indian NRI.
Indian NRI.<eos> A warm welcome to everyone from Bhushan Patnaik.<eos> We're devout of the Goddess.<eos> You've all come here seeking her refuge.<eos> And she's a Benevolent Goddess!<eos> One who alleviates all our sufferings.<eos> So let's all Focus on Goddess... And She will shower her grace on you.<eos> So repeat after me...<eos> Glory to..<eos> The Benevolent One!
Well, actually I want to book you... for marriage.<eos> Marriage?<eos> Bhushan's marriage.<eos> Why isn't anyone saying something?<eos> She will definitely reject him.<eos> Hey, Romeo...<eos> Don't jinx this.<eos> I will kill you!<eos> Why are you so shy?<eos> No reason...
Throw these guys out.<eos> Be reasonable, father!<eos> I've been asking you to reduce it for a while...<eos> How dare you back talk to your father?<eos> I will remain a bachelor forever because of your greed.<eos> You even rejected Verma's daughter.<eos> I will die a bachelor.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Even Sharma's daughter left.<eos> Enough of this game.
So if you say yes... there will be two weddings instead of one!<eos> Just say yes... and make my prediction come true.<eos> Give it a thought.<eos> And then tell me.<eos> May I leave?<eos> Okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Fine, I am going.<eos> Let's go now!<eos> Kritika.
Otherwise, I would've Cut it out a long time ago.<eos> Both the fathers have become very good friends.<eos> They are bonding well over oxygen cylinders and heart-attack.<eos> Stop laughing, mom...<eos> they are calling everyone downstairs.<eos> Yes, of course...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Someday you will realize, Vaidehi... that I am the best choice.<eos> Vaidehi.
I can't forget her, Somdev.<eos> Your planets were definitely in a conflict... when she entered your life.<eos> But why did she run away?<eos> She could've refused if she didn't want to marry me.<eos> Why humiliate me in front of the entire city?<eos> Badri, it's impossible to understand females.<eos> That's why elders always advice against falling in love.<eos> Get married when you grow up... have few kids and then life's set.<eos> I even thought of names for the children.<eos> Vishnu...
What the hell?<eos> Stop laughing at my life!<eos> Badri...<eos> Father's calling you.<eos> they've found Vaidehi.<eos> Trivedi called... he was apologizing.<eos> That girl is in Mumbai.<eos> It doesn't make any difference to me... whether she is in Mumbai or she's dead.<eos> She is dead for me.<eos> Not just for you...
If you lose that, then... then what.<eos> Life's finished.<eos> You've been showing off your English in Singapore.<eos> English...<eos> I am a master of English.<eos> I see...<eos> Then tell me the spelling of Vaidehi.<eos> Right away...<eos> Vaidehi...<eos> V with A and I...
I am going back to Jhansi.<eos> Are you going to walk to Jhansi?<eos> Yes...<eos> I am going.<eos> You'll fall in the water.<eos> I am going to Jhansi.<eos> Badri, don't go into the water...<eos> Vaidehi!<eos> Vaidehi!<eos> Vaidehi.
Sister-in-law<eos> Why are you calling her, Sister-in-law?<eos> Uncle..<eos> Uncle...<eos> Uncle...<eos> My Singapore, uncle...<eos> Tell me her flat no... and call her.<eos> We want to meet her.<eos> Quit... people are sleeping<eos> Vaidehi.
Tell me her flat no... and call her.<eos> We want to meet her.<eos> Quit... people are sleeping<eos> Vaidehi.<eos> I will call the police.<eos> Tell me Vaidehi's flat number.<eos> Tell me Vaidehi's flat number.<eos> Call her downstairs.<eos> Which... which window.<eos> Vaidehi.
No...<eos> Come, guys.<eos> The water is kept there.<eos> Fruits are in the refrigerator.<eos> Bathroom's on the right..<eos> I won't stay here.<eos> If you want to order food, then the menu cards are right here.<eos> I don't need your charity, I won't stay with you.<eos> Where else will you go?<eos> Prison?
I feel really... sick...<eos> Don't puke here, guys.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Dinner's served.<eos> All by yourself, or did they help?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> I don't touch fish...<eos> so I cut the vegetables.<eos> Let me know how you like it?<eos> Unbelievable.
Do you miss her?<eos> A lot.<eos> But I don't have the courage to talk to her.<eos> But I do.<eos> Here, talk to her.<eos> Huh!<eos> Talk to your sister.<eos> Hello.<eos> How are you?<eos> Kritika!
Kritika!<eos> Kritika, sorry.<eos> Stop wasting your time apologizing.<eos> We're talking after such a long time.<eos> Where are you?<eos> London... with Bhushan.<eos> We're here for a function.<eos> Wow... you're in London.<eos> Even you made it to Singapore.<eos> Vaidehi.
Since you two got here... you're either beating people up or getting beaten up.<eos> What is this?<eos> This is your deportation paper.<eos> They are sending you back.<eos> Joking.<eos> This is your bail receipt.<eos> Who paid for it?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> No, but who paid for it?<eos> Vaidehi.
'He hasn't differentiated between them yet.'<eos> 'Maybe he's gradually changing too.'<eos> 'Urmila has her own cabin in the showroom.'<eos> 'She and Alok look after the business together.'<eos> 'Somdev's company had a successful stint too.'<eos> 'And he took the plunge as well.'<eos> I am still as useless as I always was.<eos> Life's sailing smoothly between collection and romance.<eos> I am thinking, when I have a daughter... I'm definitely going to demand dowry for her. - What?<eos> For our daughter.
Almost.<eos> Stay on it.<eos> Left!<eos> Left!<eos> Push it, push it!<eos> Hey!<eos> Come on! Come on, get stuck in!<eos> i Down in my heart I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy...<eos> Who are you writing to?<eos> Oh, um, a girl back home, Flora.
It's the morale back home that art can raise.<eos> It's for your wives and girlfriends, your children... Don't let them cheek you.<eos> Sir?<eos> Go on, sir...<eos> Paint me!<eos> Put it away, Bates.<eos> But he's raising my morale, sir! Ready to move? Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah? Everybody here...<eos> Bates will drive you to a rendezvous point, and then you'll be driven back down to the boat from there.<eos> So, how far to the handover?
Oh, he can't be that age already?<eos> We haven't met, Robert.<eos> I'm Thomas March.<eos> I knew your father when he wasn't much older than you are.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, before I became respectable.<eos> Thomas, you've been too long a stranger. We must have you over.<eos> Yes, we must.<eos> I've not long moved, to Cassis.<eos> Oh, to...to your mother's place.
The homicide, yeah.<eos> Well, the defense just hit us with a document dump.<eos> I'm gonna have to comb through this all night if I'm gonna make my deadline.<eos> Well, that's the life of a superstar ADA, right?<eos> Well, I don't know about superstar, but... yeah.<eos> This is the life.<eos> Can I get a rain check?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> You better.
No, if you're cops, I'm a cop.<eos> The only cop here is me.<eos> But my colleagues do consult for the department.<eos> Sorry, a lot of shenanigans around this place.<eos> Even I get tricked sometimes.<eos> Jerry Bice.<eos> Welcome to AdRupt.<eos> By shenanigans, do you mean the, prank that Kip Tully played on you?<eos> Who?<eos> Kip Tully.
"Prank"?<eos> Sounds about right.<eos> I'm starting to think this Thorpe guy is more likely to have ties to a frat house than a terrorist group.<eos> I'm not sure I agree.<eos> You're making light of this, because the bug would have given people diarrhea.<eos> Well, think about it.<eos> Millions of people, all coming down with a dehydrating illness, all at the same time.<eos> Don't drink the water. But water is exactly what they would've needed.<eos> There would've been a run on the stuff, hospitals would have been overloaded.<eos> Because of diarrhea?
The living can access the underworld with the help of a gatekeeper.<eos> - I think I figured out what an ancient one is.<eos> - Look, Q, you don't have to come with me.<eos> In fact, I don't think that you should.<eos> - Noted, but I'm coming.<eos> You feel the energy coming off that?<eos> - Yeah, also the stink.<eos> - I don't know, my ancient Greek is a little rusty.<eos> - "The old reveals itself to the new at the fall of milk teeth."<eos> Milk teeth?
- Uh, I hate to bring this up, but I actually... I still have one...<eos> A molar that never came in.<eos> - Oh, I know an extraction spell.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - This dragon better be fucking cool.<eos> Or not.<eos> - I wouldn't have guessed baby teeth.<eos> Why would a dragon want baby teeth?<eos> - Shit.
- Of course you are.<eos> Uh, that's awesome...<eos> I wasn't suggesting that you weren't.<eos> - Your manner does not endear me to you, human.<eos> - We seek passage to the underworld, oh ancient one.<eos> - Hmm. - You seek to die.<eos> - Uh, no, actually, we were hoping to come back after.<eos> - Suit yourself.<eos> I require a gift.<eos> - A gift? - Um...
I said have it ready.<eos> - We have a lovely blend of... Ahem.<eos> Okay.<eos> - And where are the fire dancers?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry, I had a whole thing...<eos> - your majesty, this presentation is beautiful, but...<eos> - It would be so much better with fire dancers, I know.<eos> - I hope my arrival isn't causing undue stress.<eos> - Stress?
- My fingers got stuck in the...<eos> - oh, get over it.<eos> Your girl would.<eos> - She's not my girl.<eos> - No shit.<eos> She's tough as granite.<eos> And you're afraid to bowl.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How long before the dragon eats you and Quentin?<eos> - Tomorrow morning.
- It's like a shade orphanage.<eos> - We should hurry.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> We should split up.<eos> - I kind of have a thing about splitting up in houses full of creepy kids.<eos> Hey, can we ask you a question?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - What was that?<eos> That you just did with the money?<eos> - For the little boy?
You sure you don't want any clothes, or...<eos> - Eh. Can't you get Margo to help?<eos> You know, give you a break?<eos> - I kind of threw her in the dungeon.<eos> - Got ya.<eos> Well, you'll run yourself dead, doing everything on your own.<eos> - Believe me, I know.<eos> - Pass some shit down the chain to the governors or the Dukes or whatever.<eos> You don't have any governors?<eos> No Dukes?
Meow. - Winston!<eos> - What?<eos> - How are you not tired of this?<eos> - Tired of what?<eos> Okay, model types, 3:00.<eos> - Take a bow.<eos> - Wait, those two oatmeal men?<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> How did we ever date the same dude?<eos> Hey! Kampai.
Like a gap in their lower teeth, or a neck nipple.<eos> You're making this way too complicated.<eos> Look, this is all it needs to be... you walk up to a hot guy, okay?<eos> And you say "Hey, you're hot. "Do you want to be a model?"<eos> You have to forge a connection with them.<eos> And that way they entrust us with the thing that makes them really beautiful.<eos> You know what?<eos> You do your thing. I'll do my thing.<eos> But your thing cannot be going back to the slug guys.<eos> Sea slugs, Reagan.
You're all models now, and that's your new manager. There's only one number on this card, and there's two of you.<eos> Oh.<eos> You think we're trying to pick you up, because we're at a bar and we're telling you how handsome you are.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You're hot, and you're about to make the easiest decision of your life.<eos> Not interested.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Only child, right?<eos> I guess now I am.<eos> As of yesterday.
What would the emergency ever be?<eos> Nick, this is gonna be like cottage cheese all over again.<eos> At first, you're gonna be kicking and screaming, saying that you don't want to try it, but I'm telling you, in the end, you're gonna tell everybody that you meet how much you loved it.<eos> - This is nothing like cottage cheese.<eos> - Exactly like cottage cheese.<eos> Guys, I have off-the-charts follicle strength, okay? It'll be a blood bath down there, a real crime scene, so I'm leaning, "No."<eos> I'm out!<eos> Like my mother says at every party she goes to,<eos> "No one touches my purse."<eos> - Good day.
If we don't fix the Wellspring soon, Your Majesty...<eos> One problem at a time, okay?<eos> Our soldiers are deserting us in protest, thanks to Julia committing tree genocide.<eos> Pardon me, Your Majesty.<eos> For the official records, may I suggest a slightly less incendiary term?<eos> Perhaps "arbicide"?<eos> Sure, if you can also recommend how we fight a war without an army.<eos> Your Majesty, there is one option...<eos> - a rather obscure law, based...<eos> - Less words.
Eliot lives and there's no war... that you will do exactly what I tell you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Whatever it is.<eos> Yes.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't let him die.<eos> You are most skillful.<eos> I'm a manipulative cunt.<eos> Fix the Wellspring, now.<eos> No rush.
I froze them so they wouldn't hurt themselves... or you.<eos> Come.<eos> Come closer.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Praise Ember's strength and Umber's wisdom.<eos> So... magic's back.<eos> Shit.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> It's called The Clean Room.<eos> No magic.
You're not.<eos> It was a fairy, okay?<eos> Look, the day The Wellspring failed, I made a deal to save Eliot's life.<eos> You did, too.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You agreed to do whatever it took to save him.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> Well, you did.<eos> What do they want?<eos> Your baby.
Shades go to The Underworld.<eos> There's an Underworld?<eos> It's only accessible to the dead.<eos> But there's a catch.<eos> Alice, what happened to your hand?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It's the least I gave up to learn this.<eos> The living can access The Underworld with the help of a Gatekeeper.<eos> - A Gatekeeper?<eos> - An ancient one.
Sit back, have a nice pipe of marijuana, and enjoy my grand opus.<eos> I call it Fillory's Last Gasp.<eos> I just miss the fire, okay?<eos> Drink this.<eos> What is it?<eos> Renders you unable to harm your own body.<eos> This is all pointless, Q.<eos> You can't medicate me away.<eos> Just fucking drink it.<eos> All of it.
Look... here's the deal.<eos> I just read your book in the library, both volumes.<eos> My book?<eos> Why?<eos> Because it ends the way they all do in a couple days, with 20 blank pages.<eos> Something's about to happen, something magical and really fucking bad, and I think it's...<eos> He's been doing all sorts of fucked up shit in Fillory, bucket list shit.<eos> What's in my book?<eos> You do your recon, find out Prince Ess of Loria has taken Whitespire.<eos> Shit.
Just crack the damn lock.<eos> Hurry, before some fairy asshole sees us.<eos> I'm going as fast as I can.<eos> Fen?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Sweetie, do you know where you are? A plane laid atop our own, so the Fairy Castle and Whitespire actually occupy the same space and time, but two dimensions.<eos> Or possibly the same dimension, but incredibly sped up like that one episode of "Star Trek" where...<eos> Just get the damn chain, Josh.<eos> No.<eos> Not without my baby.
You underestimated how devastating it can be to displease a god.<eos> We've been trying to get ahold of Ember for months.<eos> He ignores us. Because you ask for things.<eos> Offer something to him instead.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> As it is in our shared interest for your High King to succeed, I'm inclined to let you go help him.<eos> Great. Josh, Fen, the baby and I will go right now.<eos> You know it doesn't work that way.<eos> Now, are you familiar with this?<eos> - No. - But goddamn.

So I stopped by the farm where Fogg gets his weekly rasher of bacon.<eos> No thanks. You sure?<eos> Because...<eos> I tried it... and, uh, it's amazing.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> I'm... just trying to do breakfast food, that's all.<eos> Oh, fuck you.<eos> Mmm. Please.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Gluttony.
Deal.<eos> I probably shouldn't say this out loud, but... this was kind of an okay day.<eos> Are you bragging?<eos> No.<eos> Kind of.<eos> Not about this... entirely.<eos> I also kind of killed a god.<eos> Huh. Hilarious.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> Ember.
Okay, wait.<eos> Like, so there's an actual plumber?<eos> Like the Mario Brother of the gods?<eos> - Yes. - And he can just...<eos> I guarantee you, he's doing it.<eos> Attention, please keep calm and follow all code green procedures.<eos> Please remember not to interact and simply gather...<eos> Attention, please keep calm and follow...<eos> Professor?<eos> Mayakovsky!
Come on, Leo.<eos> Let me end this guy right now.<eos> Tact team, stay close.<eos> This is gonna get ugly pretty quick.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Let me just ask you one thing.<eos> You know me, and you know that I'm the smartest son of a bitch that you ever worked with.<eos> Why would I walk in here and risk my neck without a good reason?<eos> And perhaps a profitable one.
1305, looks like we've located your suspect.<eos> Stolen vehicle report.<eos> Headed East on 85th off Crestview.<eos> Copy, Squad.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Look's like she's making it up to you already.<eos> Let's get this little bastard.<eos> Buddy. I got you.<eos> Hands up!<eos> Out of the car!
What if we let you sit in our car?<eos> Can you answer a few questions for us?<eos> Okay.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> Why'd you run?<eos> You were gonna take the car away, but the lady... she never washed it.<eos> She used the wrong oil.<eos> But that car didn't belong to you.<eos> I needed it, for my collection.<eos> What collection?
Hey, he's about to drive us to God knows how many counts of felony auto theft.<eos> If you got a better idea, I'm all ears.<eos> Otherwise, I call shotgun.<eos> All right, facial recognition running at DuPage and Midway airports.<eos> Where's the O'Hare feed?<eos> - I'm not in the system yet.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because this is technically illegal, Gideon!<eos> We need FAA approval to even get access<eos> - to these cameras.
You ain't gonna tell Abby shit.<eos> You just got away with it, dude.<eos> You think every time I drive drunk I get home and I call the cops? No.<eos> I pull over, I pick up the mailbox I just knocked over, throw it in my trunk and I keep moving.<eos> Yeah, but if she finds out from someone else, it's gonna be worse.<eos> Who the hell's gonna tell her?<eos> It's a small town, man.<eos> People find out shit.<eos> - You know Tina Reynolds?<eos> Walgreens?
- Yeah. Yeah. She knows Heather got a pregnancy test.<eos> Doesn't mean anybody's gonna tell anybody about anything.<eos> Look, dude, I've been buying extra-large condoms at that place for years.<eos> Still can't get that rumor started.<eos> Hey, Beau.<eos> Hey, Joanne.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> What brings you by?<eos> Well, I'm going on a two-week cruise with my daughter and my granddaughter and I was wondering if I could borrow your binoculars.<eos> My Bushnells?
- Yeah.<eos> Well, you guys should go together.<eos> - What?<eos> - Fuck that.<eos> What's going on between you two, it's stupid.<eos> It's just ridiculous to drive four hours in two trucks when you're going to the same damn place.<eos> Stop this nonsense and act like grown men.<eos> I'll be here at 8:00.<eos> - 5:30.<eos> - Shit.
Let's get goin'.<eos> Yeah, all right, just help me, uh, throw the trailer on.<eos> You think I'm gettin' into this rolling billboard for Neumann's Hill?<eos> Jeez, Dad. Come on, man.<eos> It's got heated seats, satellite radio, ECO mode...<eos> Did you just say "ECO mode" in my driveway?<eos> Hey, Dad, Rooster told me he voted for Hillary.<eos> Have a good ride, buddy.<eos> So, we're on the ski lift and who's on the chair in front of us?<eos> Mr. Pat Sajak.
Have we met before?<eos> Because... you look very familiar.<eos> Yeah, my family transferred to Garrison my senior year.<eos> I think you were a freshman.<eos> You probably remember me as, you know, the only black guy.<eos> Oh, shit, Rich!<eos> What's up, dude? Man, what happened to you after high school?<eos> - You just, like, disappeared.<eos> - I went to college.<eos> Lame.
Thought maybe you could use this to keep your pipes from freezin' again.<eos> Job's already done, Dad.<eos> Is that my heater from the hunting' cabin?<eos> Your mother needs help, so it's okay to take other people's shit, right?<eos> Is this my heater from the Airstream? Huh.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Bad news.<eos> The leak made it to the storage room.<eos> Shorted out your freezer.<eos> Shit.
Think I can't do anything right?<eos> Well, did you fix the pipe like you fixed the brakes on the truck?<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> - Brakes work fine, Dad.<eos> What doesn't work so good is your reflexes, your eyesight and that gate you plowed through.<eos> The fuckin' gate wouldn't have swung shut if you'd leveled it out.<eos> Oh, yeah, Dad? Let's do an eye test right now.<eos> How many fingers do you see? I see two.<eos> All right!<eos> Enough.
- All right, I'll see you later.<eos> - Is that cologne?<eos> Oh, oh, no.<eos> Uh, Oil of Olay.<eos> Makes my hands feel like a puppy's ear.<eos> I wish John Elway was your dad, too.<eos> Aw, remember Rooster's macaroni painting from the fourth grade?<eos> When I was in the fourth grade, I helped my father dig a well.<eos> Then he left me in it and said, "Learn how to swim."<eos> Okay, trash pile.
You're bullshit.<eos> All right, I gotta go.<eos> What? We're just getting ready to do something real stupid.<eos> Sorry, dude, booty call.<eos> I'll tell Abby you say "what up?"<eos> I'm done with this!<eos> And you.<eos> Oh, shit, she gonna throw the drink.<eos> No, Hank, the game is you only chug if she throws a drink in his face.<eos> What game?
Wait, is it that new hotel and spa in Aspen?<eos> Linda wanted to have her wedding there but she couldn't afford it.<eos> Suck it, Linda!<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I was gonna wait till we got there, but here, grab the wheel.<eos> Colt, what the hell?<eos> Champagne!<eos> Yeah, it's your birthday and I know how much you love champagne.<eos> "Dear Abby, don't let Colt tell you this is from him.<eos> Happy birthday. Maggie."
It's freezing!<eos> Okay, guys... I think I'm gonna have to shut it down 'cause of the storm, so this is last call.<eos> So it's time we get you home.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you.<eos> Aw, that's sweet.<eos> He was talking to the beer.<eos> We're closing up, so, anything else?<eos> Uh... a club soda and lime, please.<eos> Trying to sober up?<eos> - For the last 15 years and four months.
No.<eos> I asked him to give a cow an enema.<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> We said we weren't gonna kiss, and we did, so maybe, along those lines, we should not go to Hawaii?<eos> Hey, Beau, do you ever think maybe we're going too fast?<eos> I'm 71.<eos> Nothing moves fast.<eos> I'm just sayin', we've... we've never gone to dinner, we've never gone dancing... and you've never met my horses.<eos> - You have horses?<eos> - Two. Butch and Sundance.
Oh, it turns out Garrison is quite the tourist destination.<eos> There's the feed store, the Dairy Queen, the Yarn Barn, the... bench in front of the Yarn Barn.<eos> I booked a gig at Duke's Smokehouse in Grand Junction tomorrow night.<eos> You should stop by. Oh, I can't leave the bar.<eos> These people need me.<eos> You've walked around the town.<eos> Alcohol is all we have.<eos> Well, if you change your mind, your name is on the list.<eos> And let me know if you wanna invite any of them.<eos> Them?
You want a cookie?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> They got walnuts in them.<eos> Walnuts got pot in 'em?<eos> - You happy you came?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> This is just what I needed.<eos> I never do stuff like this.<eos> I told the bartender my name was Cindy.<eos> No real reason.
It's like three o'clock in the morning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Little hungover.<eos> Trying to figure out the rest of my life.<eos> You wanna talk about anything?<eos> I got up, I got dressed, I was gonna steal your wallet and sneak out.<eos> There's no money in my wallet.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> I was about to leave... but that would mean heading back to the same old thing I've been doing for the last 40 years.<eos> Same people.
Yeah.<eos> Little hungover.<eos> Trying to figure out the rest of my life.<eos> You wanna talk about anything?<eos> I got up, I got dressed, I was gonna steal your wallet and sneak out.<eos> There's no money in my wallet.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> I was about to leave... but that would mean heading back to the same old thing I've been doing for the last 40 years.<eos> Same people.<eos> Same conversations.
Yeah, yeah, the sex was fine.<eos> I'm sorry, it was great.<eos> But it was more than that.<eos> It was the whole night.<eos> You know, I... I was free.<eos> I don't know... it's like the feeling you get when you're 17 years old, and it's the first day of summer vacation, and you just discovered where your sister hides her weed.<eos> I don't wanna lose that feeling.<eos> I get it.<eos> Freedom like that's the best thing in the world.<eos> Except for cocaine.
We should talk.<eos> Okay. I had no idea you were color-blind.<eos> Well, point of fact, I am.<eos> But that's not why I'm wearing my green shirt.<eos> I am actually en route to a Jimmy Buffett concert in Denver.<eos> I've been a Parrot Head since before it was cool.<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna let that one slide right by.<eos> And if you'd like to join me, I have an extra ticket.<eos> And an extra passport to the fifth dimension.<eos> Acid.
Now they won't let me stack anything higher than my waist.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Hey, uh, remember when you used to be a pro football player?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Well, I just came here to get a case of beer and make fun of you, so one down.<eos> I'm just here for dog food.<eos> Dog food's on aisle seven.<eos> No, it's on six.<eos> Dad, I work here.<eos> For two days.
Well, there is a black brick of lasagna in the trash that says he can't.<eos> Is this gonna be the rest of our lives? Hmm.<eos> I just started this job and we're already like two shits passing in the night.<eos> Did you just say, "Two shits"?<eos> It's two...<eos> You know what? Yes, we are.<eos> But hey, we've got Friday.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Friday.<eos> About that.
Tina's never steered us wrong before.<eos> Well, honey, looks like you guys got screwed like a 10-cent whore on nickel night.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was going through those boxes there, and I found something.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser.<eos> Come here, check this out.<eos> Home movies?<eos> They're dated.<eos> 09-27-69.
No, no, no.<eos> I was going through those boxes there, and I found something.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It was hidden deep inside this nasty dresser.<eos> Come here, check this out.<eos> Home movies?<eos> They're dated.<eos> 09-27-69.<eos> Oh, great, so, now you're the proud owners of somebody's 40-year-old wedding movies.<eos> No, not a wedding.
09-27-69.<eos> Punch that in, babe.<eos> "Napa, California.<eos> Cecelia Shepard attacked on..."<eos> "September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of lake berryessa.<eos> "Shepard died of her wounds."<eos> See, what'd I tell ya?<eos> What are the other dates on those?<eos> 06-18-68.<eos> 06-18-68.
"September 27th, 1969, on the shore line of lake berryessa.<eos> "Shepard died of her wounds."<eos> See, what'd I tell ya?<eos> What are the other dates on those?<eos> 06-18-68.<eos> 06-18-68.<eos> Nothing.<eos> All right.<eos> Try 08-31-68.<eos> 08-31-68.
No, but that's real money, and we're running out of options.<eos> This could be the one we're been waiting for, baby.<eos> I hope so.<eos> All right, let me check back in with Harvey then.<eos> Great, love you.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> All right.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Tina, why'dyouchangethe lock onmylocker?<eos> Igottagetinthere...
This is the most excitement I've had in years.<eos> I'll tell what, if you play your cards right and don't say anything mean, you might just get lucky tonight.<eos> Oh, is that right?<eos> That is right.<eos> Okay, get to work. Yeah.<eos> I mean, i wouldn't mind some...<eos> Get to work!<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> Files are labeled under customer names.<eos> Yeah, mine, too.
Boom, done, ka-ching.<eos> The FBI hasn't been able to catch him all these years, what makes you think we're going to find anything?<eos> Is that the shitty attitude we're going to start with? Maybe.<eos> How is that a shitty attitude?<eos> Because you're, like, "i don't wanna do this..."<eos> Okay, ladies, ladies.<eos> Ladies, you're both pretty, let's get to work.<eos> Can you open the door?<eos> I thought Tina told you that this lady was loaded?<eos> Oh, shit.
He never had kids.<eos> Uh, he served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1964.<eos> Zodiac's first kill was 1968.<eos> Then after Vietnam, in 1965, he got a job with a paper in San Francisco as a crime reporter.<eos> San Francisco? Oh, this is good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, but there's just a little hitch in the giddy-up.<eos> So, for some reason, ferguson decided to leave that job with that paper in San Francisco and move back here to start a job with the old ledger on, um, October the 1st, 1969.<eos> The thing is, Paul Lee stine was killed in San Francisco on October 11th, 1969.<eos> Shit.
We're not looking for the zodiac now.<eos> Here.<eos> Now...<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're going after Harvey.<eos> You're sure you're up for this?<eos> Oh, hell, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Shit.
God... come here.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Afterfourweeks ofinvestigation, theFBI, withthecooperationof thelocalauthorities, usingDNAevidence, havepositivelylinked thedeceasedto thethreelocalhomicides.<eos> Wehavebeenunabletomake apositiveidentification onthedeceased.<eos> Wearecurrently investigatingthosescenes andhisresidence foranyother pertinentevidence.<eos> Theinvestigationis ongoing, butI cantell youatthistime wecannotexclude orconfirmtheDNA ofthenowdeceasedsuspect asa matchfor thezodiackiller.<eos> After40years, theearliersamples arejustunreliable.<eos> Iknowthere'salot offamiliesoutthere thatarelooking forsomeclosure, but,uh,it 'sgonna takea long,longtime beforeweknowfor sure.<eos> I'lltakeyourquestionsnow.<eos> - Shit. Hey.
Holograms!<eos> Right?<eos> Who here loves a good hologram?<eos> Yes, that's what I thought.<eos> So, as chief sponsor of today's festivities,<eos> That amazing-ness is what Reeves is all about.<eos> Making you see things in a new way, Changing the world, One awesome, mind-blowing demonstration at a time!<eos> We love you, Gideon! Yes. All right.<eos> Well, that's enough of me, At least until my keynote speech later, Which is gonna be great, that I can tell you.<eos> So, without further ado...
You can do something, right?<eos> Like, hack it?<eos> I mean, I could try a brute force attack. Or a cryptography approach.<eos> The password's mookie22, capital "m."<eos> That'll work.<eos> You seem annoyingly cheerful.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, Gideon's at his little conference thing, And, you know, it just feels good. To be back to basics, you know?<eos> Yeah, just when you were warming up to the new toys.<eos> Some of 'em.
It's a bottomless pit.<eos> Can I get you a donut?<eos> Okay,<eos> So you're an online ticket broker?<eos> Of sorts.<eos> So do you know reevesreaper26?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Sure looks like you know him.<eos> Well, the traffic on your forum shows. That you facilitated a sale of a windy city tech summit. All-access wristband.<eos> From a joshman5 to...
You are watching a screen.<eos> Okay, you've never watched bones?<eos> Guys, there should be a security guard there.<eos> Hey, over here.<eos> There's the guard.<eos> He's got a pulse.<eos> Squad, we need an ambulance.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Maybe the killer needed backstage access.<eos> Or firepower.
Think I found him.<eos> Man.<eos> Evan?<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Hey, easy, buddy.<eos> You don't want to do that. I said get back.<eos> Look, you don't know me.<eos> But I've spent the whole day getting to know you.<eos> Met your mom.<eos> Your boyfriend Jackson.
The rafters.<eos> He loves this part.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> So are you seriously telling me. This can scan the whole crowd for a gun?<eos> Yeah, it's a portable version.<eos> Of the full body scanners at airports. So everyone is gonna jam in to here. For my keynote speech.<eos> There's pretty much no chance a guy obsessed with me.<eos> Is gonna miss that. And that's when we get him.<eos> My gut feeling is that he wants to take you down publicly.<eos> Probably during your speech.
That's strange.<eos> I must have missed Andre's academy graduation, 'cause I'm pretty sure he's not a cop.<eos> Well, right now, we're not getting anywhere unless we're talking to Andre first.<eos> Look.<eos> So Pete's fed all the information to the APB app.<eos> But in this whole area, only a couple people have downloaded it.<eos> I mean, I know some people don't like technology, but you know what everyone hates?<eos> Rapists.<eos> Seriously, that's a well-documented fact.<eos> No doubt.
So that's why Iraq is such a beacon of peace in the world today.<eos> Look, over there.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Couple of days ago, those guys would have been running from us.<eos> But now that they know we're not leaving...<eos> So you won over their hearts?<eos> That's what you're saying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I did.<eos> _
You could do that.<eos> But this information is randomly set to auto-send.<eos> Unless I stop it.<eos> It'd be a huge gamble on your part.<eos> There is one other option.<eos> I could not send the information, and you could never, ever come near me again.<eos> How do I know that your police friends aren't gonna be paying me another visit?<eos> Because whether you like it or not, I have the power to stop it.<eos> Back off me.<eos> Back off the 13th.
Because I'm going to the opera.<eos> I'm late.<eos> Exeunt.<eos> - Something's not right here. - Mm-hmm.<eos> He's got a cape, unusually pointy nipples.<eos> - You don't think Van's...<eos> - A Mexican wrestler?<eos> I was gonna say, "Hiding something," but your theory makes perfect sense.<eos> We're gonna get to the bottom of this.<eos> Happy Friday, everybody!
I'll just say this:<eos> I've told off a lot of crappy men.<eos> It's like a Vegas buffet. You will feel terrible afterwards.<eos> Yeah, but it feels great while you're eating it.<eos> Ooh, I can't wait to tear this guy a new...<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> What are we still doing here?<eos> It's been an hour.<eos> Okay, Batman's not gonna come to the office, so we have to meet him in his office:<eos> the cover of night.
The other day. Sup, y'all.<eos> It's nice to finally meet you guys.<eos> I'm Dante.<eos> - Good evening. - Pleasure is ours.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Okay! Have a good night... finish your homework.<eos> Like good little, little, little guys.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not buying that.<eos> - The homework thing, or the...<eos> - No, no, no.
I'm Dante.<eos> - Good evening. - Pleasure is ours.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Okay! Have a good night... finish your homework.<eos> Like good little, little, little guys.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not buying that.<eos> - The homework thing, or the...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> All of it. Let me guess, uh, she told you to be nice<eos> - to the new guy, right?
You got an amazing family, Mick.<eos> Yeah, they're all right.<eos> That's funny, I thought we were your baggage.<eos> Oh, you are so stupid.<eos> - She's so stupid.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> You want to see real baggage?<eos> I carry mine with me every day.<eos> See this?<eos> September 26th, 1983.
These guys are no good.<eos> Yeah, if you were supposed to be with her, you'd be with her.<eos> Yeah, back off. She's mine.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, come on, quit messing around.<eos> We see each other every day.<eos> You kidding?<eos> You really don't know who I am?<eos> Mr. Piggy?<eos> Oink, oink?
Now, I knew it couldn't be angels bowling, so...<eos> I thought you were working today.<eos> And didn't we agree that you never wear that sweater again?<eos> - My... - Excuse me.<eos> We're kind of on a date right now.<eos> Uh, Haley. Oh, save it, you lying, cheating, middle-aged pointer.<eos> That's what you do, you know... you point.<eos> You point for your money!<eos> We are done!<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.
Is that Bailey?<eos> 'Cause I think Joe has a little thing for her.<eos> Yeah, he did have a little thing for her.<eos> It's here.<eos> He did it again.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have trusted you talking to him, because you will let him get away with murder because he's a mini you and you like it.<eos> And you know what's worse?<eos> That you're so mean to Manny because he's different than you.<eos> First off, Joe is not a mini me.<eos> Crap.
'Cause I think Joe has a little thing for her.<eos> Yeah, he did have a little thing for her.<eos> It's here.<eos> He did it again.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have trusted you talking to him, because you will let him get away with murder because he's a mini you and you like it.<eos> And you know what's worse?<eos> That you're so mean to Manny because he's different than you.<eos> First off, Joe is not a mini me.<eos> Crap.<eos> Crapola.
- No! We are still on board.<eos> - No, Sal.<eos> We are sorry we made you call Werner.<eos> We didn't know that that was gonna happen.<eos> So you have to understand that you...<eos> Mitchell you want to step in here?<eos> I'm getting dizzy.<eos> I am...<eos> - Stop it! - Okay, no more.<eos> No more matches. No more matches.
- Okay, okay. That cold water woke me up to the hard truth...<eos> I'm smart, I'm beautiful, - I'm legendary in bed,<eos> - Okay. yet I do settle.<eos> I mean, Werner is not good enough for me.<eos> I mean, I get why you two idiots settled.<eos> This is the best you're gonna do, right here.<eos> You're perfectly matched.<eos> Aww. Well, it's kind of sweet when you look at it that way.<eos> Yeah. We are very lucky.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.
Come on, sweetie, we don't want to be late for the wedding.<eos> _<eos> You got this.<eos> Hmm.<eos> _<eos> But don't feel bad for her.<eos> She's got this.<eos> Her words, not mine.<eos> _<eos> No clothes!
_ _ _<eos> _<eos> Mateo, put your clothes back on right now.<eos> No, I want to build a fort.<eos> That's one clap of thunder, Mateo.<eos> Now put your clothes back on right now.<eos> Fort, fort, fort.<eos> That's two claps of thunder, Mateo.<eos> No!<eos> No more thunder!
Yeah, that is impressive.<eos> Anyways, Petra's gonna deal with the whole easement thing, so...<eos> I'm not gonna stress about it.<eos> Okay, Zen Rafael.<eos> I buy one pair of linen pants...<eos> And grow the world's worst beard.<eos> Why does everyone hate the beard?<eos> Except Mateo.<eos> Hey, if I'm nervous about his parent-teacher conference tomorrow, then you must be at a nine.<eos> Closer to a ten... thousand.
Well, I'm not moving my clubhouse.<eos> Great. Then I'm gonna tear it down.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> That conclude our business here?<eos> 'Cause I got ten minutes to kill before my next meeting.<eos> Fine, but this is the last time.<eos> And wipe those greasy hands first.<eos> So let's give them some privacy.<eos> Okay, class, stand up.<eos> Martial arts.
And he's in martial arts, so that's helping.<eos> I'm sorry, we can't have that sort of behavior at Jackson's party.<eos> Look, I'm sure this school has a policy about inviting all the kids.<eos> - We actually don't.<eos> - Well, that's crazy.<eos> Take it up with the PTA.<eos> And, of course, the president of said PTA is...<eos> Yeah, Astrid told me about the birthday.<eos> And look, Jane does not want my pity.<eos> Or help.
There are other ways!<eos> Uhtred, as the king explained earlier, you do not have a voice...<eos> I will say what's on my mind and clearly!<eos> This plan can never work... there are other ways to defeat Kjartan.<eos> It seems everyone is wrong but you, Uhtred Ragnarson.<eos> Do we have a plan, King Guthred?<eos> Yes, we have a plan... and we have an agreement, do we not?<eos> We do.<eos> Excellent. In addition to Dunholm, how many women will you be offering?<eos> None.

You've been here three-quarters of your life, and you never once, not even once, dipped your malasada into your cup of coffee?<eos> Why is that so strange?<eos> I mean, I'm not saying it's strange as much as it is just sad.<eos> I mean, you're on this island, which is sitting on the best coffee in the entire world... 100% Kona coffee.<eos> Now, how do you expect to enjoy the fusion of the flavors, the sweetness of the dough up against the bitterness of the coffee, it's just, it's heaven, man.<eos> You know what?<eos> - Just observe. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Okay? You ready?
All right. That, I believe, is five times in a row.<eos> You rig this thing?<eos> No. Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause if you didn't rig this thing, then it is designed specifically... Engineered... To humiliate adults.<eos> 'Cause nobody can be that lucky.<eos> Again. Again? Yeah, 'cause I need more whipped cream flung up my nose.<eos> This time I'm going first, okay?<eos> Mouth.<eos> This time I'm getting you for sure.<eos> All right.
Mahalo, Jerry.<eos> No sweat.<eos> Here are the boxes you asked for.<eos> I got another half dozen in my van if you need them.<eos> Um, actually... that should not be necessary.<eos> Um, if my calculations are correct, the rest of my possessions should fit perfectly in these seven remaining boxes.<eos> Okay, then... let the packing commence. Where do you want me?<eos> Um... yeah, you could start on those shelves over there.<eos> Check.<eos> Sorry.
Yeah, I'm gonna enhance it and see if I can get a look at that plate.<eos> Who's it registered to, Kono?<eos> Jimmy Rorke.<eos> He was pinched for grand theft and BE.<eos> We got an address on this guy?<eos> Guys, come on back here.<eos> Apparently, Rorke had an accomplice...<eos> But from the looks of things, he must have sustained these wounds in a blast.<eos> Obviously, Rorke didn't want to take him to the hospital.<eos> Chin.
Listen.<eos> Listen, p-please.<eos> I...<eos> Out of the truck.<eos> Let me see your hands. Show me your hands!<eos> Alan.<eos> He's not worth it.<eos> Listen, you've got the evidence in your hand.<eos> They got to retry the case. Don't throw your life away 'cause of this guy.<eos> What life?
Anyhoo, I wanted to wish you luck.<eos> Rumor has it, you're heading to Madagascar.<eos> Never been myself, but hear it's lovely.<eos> So, I want to wish you safe travels.<eos> I wish you health and happiness.<eos> A-And, may the odds be ever in your favor.<eos> And if any of you are interested in acquiring a Crime Clean franchise...<eos> You're done.<eos> Okay, all right, Th-that's all.<eos> And I'chaim!

These are the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> They want revenge for the death of their father.<eos> They killed Aelle.<eos> But they know your father was complicit in his death.<eos> So it seems inevitable that they are marching towards Wessex.<eos> I believe this man.<eos> I always thought they would seek revenge against my father.<eos> So let's move towards repton.<eos> I think our destiny awaits us there.<eos> Tanaruz!
As you can see, i have no time for games.<eos> We found your wife.<eos> Look at her!<eos> We have told her that if you tell us who paid for your fleet and attack then we will spare your life.<eos> That you and your wife can live together again, happily.<eos> I don't know this woman.<eos> Just tell them.<eos> Just tell them, Egil!<eos> If I do it, it is for you.<eos> Not for me.
You say they left their ships at repton?<eos> Yes, my lord Aethelwulf.<eos> In which direction is repton?<eos> Then that's where we're going.<eos> And if we reach repton first, and destroy their ships, then we shall have the better of this battle!<eos> But we must move fast, and keep them behind us!<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Where are they going?<eos> To repton, I imagine.<eos> To the boats?
To the boats?<eos> They are going for our boats?<eos> Oh, you crippled bastard!<eos> You were right! You were right!<eos> Oh, you bloody mad genius.<eos> You were right!<eos> Stay down! Get in lines!<eos> Mind your back!<eos> Shield-wall!<eos> Charge!
- Donovan snell.<eos> But the prosecutor, Weinsbach, claimed that my Gordon, my quiet, bookish Gordon who loved nothing more than watching old movies, doing crossword puzzles. And gardening...<eos> - Dude sounds like he's 80. - Dude.<eos> That he was a neighborhood drug dealer.<eos> And that he got into a Turf War with actual drug dealers, Tommy and Bobby Vega.<eos> And then he said that Gordon killed Tommy in a drug deal gone wrong.<eos> I know this case.<eos> What?<eos> - They had no evidence. - None.<eos> Just an unimpeachable undercover source.
Everyone okay?<eos> Good morning, Alan.<eos> This whole "evacuating to San Fernando" thing is a convincing cover story, so long as you're too ignorant or terrified to start pulling at the threads.<eos> Were you going to tell me?<eos> I got the call last night.<eos> You were in such a good mood, I didn't want to ruin it.<eos> By giving me a heads-up that the world was coming to an end?<eos> I have defended this bloc as long as I can.<eos> But it's become a nightmare.<eos> For us and them.
And they were overruled.<eos> And in light of Alcala's regime, I can't say that I disagree with them.<eos> So that's it?<eos> They flip a switch and turn Los Angeles into glass.<eos> Well, actually, they've rethought that approach.<eos> It was causing labor shortages.<eos> Dare I ask what they're planning instead?<eos> Total Rendition.<eos> I did everything that I could... we... we did everything that we could, but... the decision has come from above, so.<eos> Far above.
I mean, assuming we still have a donor.<eos> Not even a question.<eos> Yeah, in 24 hours, we think she'll be strong enough to do it.<eos> That's... that's great news.<eos> Truck 81, Engine 51.<eos> All right, buddy.<eos> You go be a hero. I'm gonna schedule your donation for tomorrow.<eos> - All right.<eos> - 7110 South St. Lawrence.<eos> Help!
You look pretty good, considering you jumped out a window.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Like I... jumped out a window.<eos> What is it?<eos> - What is what?<eos> - You missed the course in med school in lying to your patients.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, the good news is you're gonna make a full recovery.<eos> Bad news?<eos> The bruising in your pelvis.
Yeah, we're screwed.<eos> Yep.<eos> Sharon Goodwin from Med.<eos> Kelly Severide has been given the go-ahead for his bone marrow donation. Wait.<eos> What about the anesthesia?<eos> 'Cause Dawson said he wasn't cleared for that.<eos> Um, there isn't gonna be any anesthesia.<eos> So, they're going to drill into his hip and just take it out?<eos> That's right.<eos> About a liter of it.
He's gonna be so happy.<eos> We were there when he needed us.<eos> No one can ever take that away.<eos> It's today, yeah?<eos> Louie's dad is picking him up at their place.<eos> I cannot imagine what they're going through.<eos> So, you missed all of it?<eos> Ripping the roof off that car?<eos> The hero dad?<eos> Everything?
I'm taking Claudine with me.<eos> It's hard to imagine Her Majesty in that position, I know, but, well, who can deny there is something enticing about a man in a soutempe.<eos> Oh, Madame, you have missed the best gossip.<eos> My presence was requested elsewhere. Really?<eos> With company more stimulating than ours?<eos> The Queen asked to see me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What services did she require?<eos> If she is with child, it must be an Immaculate Conception.<eos> Not my services, as such.
It's up to us now.<eos> Screw you and your ark.<eos> Nice to see you, too.<eos> You're right, Darius.<eos> The government's plan won't work. They need you.<eos> You said the technology doesn't exist yet.<eos> If you're so damn smart, invent it.<eos> You've got the resources, the talent, the money.<eos> Don't save 160 people, save them all.<eos> Every last one.
Sam!<eos> - Sam! Vessel?<eos> - Whoa. Whoa there.<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, whatever's got you all twisted up?<eos> Are you heading to the vessel?<eos> Yes, we're riding to the port overnight. Be there by daybreak.<eos> Can I hitch a ride?<eos> I need to get to Charlottetown!<eos> - I'm not riding in back.<eos> - No worries at all.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> Alright?<eos> Extra, extra!<eos> Scientist predicts greenhouse effect!<eos> Extra, extra!<eos> Scientist predicts greenhouse effect!<eos> What time does the ferry to Nova Scotia go?<eos> 'Round about 5:00.<eos> Local boy loses life by drowning!<eos> Out of the way, mister!
One big happy family. My, my.<eos> Looks like the Cuthberts have picked up a stray.<eos> Stray dog.<eos> Ruff-ruff! No need to be uncharitable.<eos> Do you suppose they mean for her to be a daughter or a servant?<eos> Doesn't she have awful red hair?<eos> I wonder if she'll be attending school.<eos> What is the world coming to?<eos> I hear they plucked her from an asylum in Nova Scotia.<eos> - A lunatic asylum?

As someone who has never belonged to anyone before, I believe that this is a matter of much solemnity.<eos> Don't you?<eos> What say you, Marilla?<eos> Well... I've got some raspberry cordial in the pantry.<eos> Perhaps we could all have a small glass to celebrate without any danger to anyone.<eos> Oh, Miss Cuth...<eos> Thank you, Marilla.<eos> That would do nicely.<eos> Well, then... to the Cuthberts.<eos> - The Cuthberts.
It's the bane of my existence.<eos> Anne Shirley-Cuthbert,<eos> I suggest you find a worthier overriding concern.<eos> And my freckles. I hate my freckles.<eos> And I can't help but think that the other children would like me better if I was pretty.<eos> Fiddlesticks.<eos> You're a vain one and no mistake.<eos> If a rose wasn't beautiful, nobody would want to stop and smell it.<eos> And besides, how can I be vain if I'm ugly?<eos> Enough of this foolishness.
Fiddlesticks.<eos> You're a vain one and no mistake.<eos> If a rose wasn't beautiful, nobody would want to stop and smell it.<eos> And besides, how can I be vain if I'm ugly?<eos> Enough of this foolishness.<eos> You'll do just fine at school if you'd stop your yammering and fortify yourself.<eos> Why, hello there.<eos> I'm ever so pleased to make your acquaintances.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Salutations!
Everyone does.<eos> Miss Cuthbert... we feel that our group isn't the right fit for you.<eos> I... I see.<eos> We understand clearly now that Anne needs all of your attention.<eos> You've got your hands full.<eos> All of my attention?<eos> Also, we urge you to consider home schooling.<eos> That would be best for all concerned.<eos> And we are concerned.<eos> Good day to you.
I think you heard me plain.<eos> Well, hear this:<eos> You can hold Anne responsible for what she said... I can and most certainly do.<eos> ...but you can't hold against her what she's seen or been exposed to.<eos> That's not her fault.<eos> That child has endured more than any of us can know or imagine.<eos> It's a shame "progressive parenting" doesn't seem to include compassion.<eos> But perhaps you'll muster some up in church on Sunday and thank the good Lord that poor Anne has finally found safe haven.<eos> I know I will.<eos> Good day.
Previously on vikings...<eos> You took my husband, my world, and my happiness.<eos> I renounce everything.<eos> Where's our mother?<eos> She's dead, ubbe.<eos> This was nothing to do with you.<eos> You are ragnar's sons.<eos> It was a mistake not to kill us.<eos> I want to go here.<eos> To this sea.
- Ivar didn't see ragnar die!<eos> He wasn't there!<eos> My ragnar.<eos> My love.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> But, if he is dead, what will you do?<eos> I must pick up the burden.<eos> The burden?<eos> Of ruling.
Then why do it to yourself?<eos> I think ragnar is looking at me, and I can't disappoint him.<eos> Nor can I disappoint myself.<eos> Or you.<eos> Or torvi.<eos> Or any of the shield-maidens who have died fighting at my side.<eos> If I walked away now, what would they say about me in Valhalla?<eos> We have to prepare.<eos> For what?<eos> The sons of ragnar.
We would be fools to give ourselves away so quickly.<eos> So, what about ivar?<eos> How do we control him?<eos> You tell me, brother.<eos> Mother, father,<eos> father.<eos> - Welcome back!<eos> - Lagertha!<eos> Today marks a new dawn for kattegat.<eos> For all of us.
I am hollow.<eos> I need something to fill me up.<eos> I was so sick I thought I was going to die.<eos> But I had time to think about everything.<eos> About what I want from this life.<eos> And I want a baby.<eos> - No, Helga.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I need something more from this life.<eos> But not a child.
What kind of place is this?<eos> It's a temple.<eos> Where are their gods?<eos> I can't see any and yet they're praying with such passion.<eos> I hate that noise!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> No.<eos> No more killing!
Home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Difficult to return.<eos> When we return, hvitserk and I, and our brothers we will have to avenge our father's death.<eos> And that would be difficult for you too.<eos> You would not be welcome, for what you did to all of us.<eos> And I would have to kill you.<eos> Shield-maiden: Shield wall!<eos> Let him pass.<eos> Ubbe.
Blasphemous girl!<eos> As for you, father, you may enjoy the aridities of heaven without my discomforting presence, and that of every other woman whose only crime was a desire to be free.<eos> There is something I would like to see.<eos> Are you going to go home?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> I want to make you all an offer.<eos> Anyone from our homelands who wants good, rich lands to farm<eos> can come and live in my kingdom.<eos> There will always be a part of frankia which is a part of us.<eos> Us?
Once a betrayer, always a betrayer.<eos> Helga: Goodbye, rollo.<eos> Goodbye, Helga.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> I won't forget anything.<eos> You should have killed him when you had the chance.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because I have a bad feeling that he will reach more fame than any of you.<eos> Husband.<eos> Gisla.
That we have all lost a father.<eos> Who's the cripple?<eos> His name is ivar and he's my brother.<eos> So I would suggest you stop laughing at him right now.<eos> Instead, if you want to stay alive, I would learn to respect and fear him.<eos> That would be my advice.<eos> Queen lagertha.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Earl jorgensen.<eos> From Sweden.
This is torvi, my son bjorn's companion.<eos> And this is Astrid, one of my shield-maidens.<eos> I leave you in their company.<eos> You had no right to free my slaves without my permission.<eos> I don't remember you asking permission to kill my mother.<eos> That's different.<eos> I am queen now.<eos> I know.<eos> I just don't know for how long.<eos> Ubbe!
I know.<eos> I just don't know for how long.<eos> Ubbe!<eos> I wanted to tell you.<eos> You look just like your father looked when he was a young man.<eos> When I first knew him.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know. But something!<eos> Lagertha!
We want to kill aelle.<eos> Nothing else matters right now, woman.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> It matters to me even if it doesn't matter to you!<eos> Listen!<eos> I did not come back here to be told what to do.<eos> Not by you, not by anyone!<eos> Please. You must eat.<eos> Tanaruz.
- It's not a riddle.<eos> - No.<eos> It's a truth.<eos> I just don't know what the truth is.<eos> The gods haven't revealed it to me.<eos> Not yet anyway.<eos> Come here, boy!<eos> My horn is empty.<eos> Mine too!<eos> Egil...
Your Highness?<eos> Charge!<eos> Charge!
You are not like anybody else.<eos> Be yourself, Floki.<eos> This world, it is too small for you.<eos> When Balder, Odin's beloved son, died, not only did people weep.<eos> But fire wept.<eos> And iron and all the other metals wept.<eos> The stones wept. Earth wept.<eos> Farewell, voyager.<eos> Farewell, my heart, farewell.<eos> For now.
We do.<eos> What about you, Sigurd?<eos> You've been very quiet so far.<eos> I'm sure you have an opinion.<eos> I agree with you, Ivar. Excuse me?<eos> We should Blood Eagle him.<eos> Finally, thank you.<eos> But I'm not sure. I'm not sure what they're saying.<eos> What I am saying is that we should do what our father always wanted.<eos> Yes?
You are crazy.<eos> You have the mind of a child!<eos> And all you do is play music, Sigurd!<eos> - I'm just as much a son of Ragnar as you are.<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> As far as I remember, Ragnar didn't play the oud.<eos> And he certainly didn't offer his arse to other men. You make me laugh!<eos> Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Enough!
I have Spain, Prussia and the Holy Roman Empire behind me.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> To make a proposition.<eos> What sort of proposition?<eos> If we are to continue these discussions, then, I insist, we do so in private.<eos> As you wish.<eos> No, it's alright.<eos> I'll shall call for you, if required.<eos> Of course, Sire.<eos> About this proposition... Shh, shh, shh!
You put me in an awkward position.<eos> She has offered me her friendship.<eos> Simply as a means to drive a wedge between us.<eos> I think you exaggerate the threat.<eos> You do not know her as I do.<eos> Can you blame her for being jealous of you?<eos> You stole the King from her.<eos> I took what she had already lost and that is what torments her.<eos> Do you have feelings for him?<eos> For the King?
Does His Majesty like that? Yes.<eos> And this?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to tell you a story.<eos> Once upon a time, a young woman arrived at court and like all young women, she fell under the spell of the master of the house.<eos> So the master lured her into his bed, only to replace her with another but by then, she had a fig inside of her.<eos> The master denied his paternity and the child, lucky thing, died before it ever saw the light of day.<eos> You say that you care and protect your subjects, but you don't; you destroy them!<eos> What do you want?<eos> My life!

I'm in no mood for gifts.<eos> You haven't seen it yet.<eos> Her name is Layak.<eos> Where is she from?<eos> Java.<eos> She's a widow witch.<eos> In the daytime, she appears as an ordinary human being but at night she flies around in search of a pregnant woman to suck her baby's blood.<eos> Charming, don't you think?<eos> You're scared, aren't you?<eos> Of what?
Whoa!<eos> Keep moving, Magilla.<eos> The base is ours.<eos> So, what were you saying before we were interrupted?<eos> I...<eos> Okay, good a place as any.<eos> I got an apartment in the city.<eos> I hoped, maybe, we could share, you know, together.<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> No rock?
Go, Mom, we can talk later.<eos> I love you, Jaime.<eos> Be good.<eos> Consuela, give me that cake!<eos> I better go too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> I miss my son.<eos> Accessing most recent footage on Brother Blood.<eos> Lies.
Calm yourself.<eos> The fools trust you.<eos> Use that.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Shit.<eos> You guys scared me.<eos> We can see that.<eos> - Are those for me?<eos> - They sure are.<eos> For your one year anniversary as a member of the Titans.
- And, because of the bug odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.<eos> I think pain is what makes a hero.<eos> It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.<eos> But what about you, Chuckles?<eos> Aside from an unhealthy online presence, you're normal.<eos> Yeah, you're green.<eos> You wouldn't change it if you could.<eos> You like the attention.<eos> Besides it looks okay on you.<eos> Wow.
Terra.<eos> Place reminds me of my parents' church.<eos> - Bunch of crazies.<eos> - Insolent trash.<eos> Who you calling trash?<eos> Keep it together.<eos> Let's be civil to our guests.<eos> Our business is not yet complete.<eos> Sure it is. You wanted the Titans, and here they are.<eos> Not all of them.
- Things happen.<eos> - I accept that.<eos> But I told you even in death there is life to be drawn.<eos> Where is the body?<eos> Unless you have a body, you're one short.<eos> Therefore, our contract is not complete.<eos> Happily there is still a path to the salvation of our deal.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> Excellent.<eos> Mayhem.
Enough to stop her from changing her mind.<eos> It was a suicide, Peter.<eos> The duct tape didn't look suspicious to you?<eos> Walking into a freezing river is suspicious.<eos> The best way to make sure you'll drown is to not be able to swim.<eos> How in the world did she tape herself?<eos> You'd be amazed by what you can find on YouTube.<eos> I'm happy to pursue this, but what exactly am I looking for?<eos> Something that will allow me to charge Jaxson Clark with the stalking and harassment of Lily Spencer.<eos> Without a victim?
- Hey, take it easy.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> Aah! - Stop!<eos> Stop! - Let go of my arm!<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> Let go of my arm!<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Put the phones away.<eos> Lily Jane Spencer was brought in for an OD.<eos> Klonopin?
"Sui," from the Latin, meaning "of self."<eos> "Cidium," Latin for "a killing."<eos> Put them together, and what do you get?<eos> You don't get murder... That's what.<eos> I know I'm pushing it, Mark.<eos> The man was across town when his ex walked into the lake, for God's sake.<eos> It's like he sent her a letter bomb. No, it's not.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> With a letter bomb, there's no intervening, independent cause.<eos> Namely, her own death wish.
she had such a longing for school.<eos> Bide your time, I'm telling you.<eos> Anne is a clever one and all.<eos> Too clever by half.<eos> She'll go back, that's for sure and certain.<eos> It's hard to have lofty ideas when you're stuck in a kitchen all day.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> She'll soon cool off in a week or so.<eos> Or so?<eos> Patience.
I'm sorry I had to leave you at Mrs. Hammond's.<eos> You have no idea how grateful I'd be if you'd visit me here.<eos> Katie?<eos> Idle hands are the devil's workshop.<eos> So if it's alright with you, even though you know best, I would like to suggest that she return to school tomorrow.<eos> What brings you inside this time of day?<eos> - What is it you need, Matthew?<eos> I'll take a coffee.<eos> At three in the afternoon?<eos> Or... or tea.
Oh, fascinating.<eos> I had another excellent day.<eos> I learned so much and I imagine Mr. Phillips was quite impressed and...<eos> And she lied and then lied some more.<eos> I've been doing my best to teach her right from wrong, but, well, this matter is so grave that we knew we had to bring it to you.<eos> Indeed, indeed.<eos> It's a very good thing I'm here.<eos> God frowns on fibbing, young lady.<eos> I imagine he does. I see now how truly wrong I was.<eos> Wrong and disrespectful.
I, uh...<eos> I suppose your mind is burdened, then, by the minister's visit.<eos> Oh, everything is just peaches and cream, thank you for asking.<eos> Now, is there anything I can... bake or clean, or mend or fetch for you?<eos> Marilla?<eos> Marilla!<eos> What's happening?<eos> There's a fire in town.<eos> Fetch the cellar buckets.<eos> Quick like a bunny.
! - She ran inside!<eos> - Did it slow it down?<eos> - What were you thinking?<eos> Fire... fire needs oxygen.<eos> Closing windows and doors deprives it...<eos> - Oh, my word!<eos> - Anne slowed down the fire!<eos> - However do you know that?<eos> - It was Anne! She did it!<eos> The Fire Manual in the orphanage.
I should fetch the eggs.<eos> You can, but you won't.<eos> Now up to bed with both of you.<eos> Anne, please see to it that your guest is comfortable.<eos> Come along, Ruby.<eos> I have a lovely gable room. And the cherry tree is ever so friendly.<eos> My first night here in this room, I cried as you do now.<eos> Try as I might, there was no hope for my imagination that cold night.<eos> Princess Cordelia was nowhere to be found.<eos> Princess Cordelia?

And the cherry tree is ever so friendly.<eos> My first night here in this room, I cried as you do now.<eos> Try as I might, there was no hope for my imagination that cold night.<eos> Princess Cordelia was nowhere to be found.<eos> Princess Cordelia?<eos> Well... she's a wise and solitary princess.<eos> She wears dresses of the finest silk and velvet with puff sleeves and ever so many flounces.<eos> One day...
- You can do it, Anne!<eos> - Penitent. - P-E-N...<eos> I-T-E-N-T.<eos> [cheering]<eos> Intentions.<eos> I-N-T...<eos> E-N-T-I-O-N-S.<eos> Persevere.<eos> P-E-R-S-E-V-E-R-E.<eos> - Engagement.
Well, it's God's plan and that's the way of it.<eos> Oh, there's been some kind of mistake.<eos> There is no way God would think that it's time for me to be a woman!<eos> Now, now, let's get you sorted out.<eos> You'll need some cotton cloths to pin to your undergarments...<eos> - This can't be happening.<eos> - And after, they'll need to be washed in cold water first, and then hot.<eos> Oh, do you have to deal with this, too?<eos> I did. For many years.<eos> Years? !
Where's the shame in that?<eos> Am I the only one who thinks she's out of her mind?<eos> It's a secret, Anne.<eos> That's just the way it is.<eos> Do boys have to contend with anything like this?<eos> Boys have their own problems.<eos> Why are they doing that?<eos> There's a question for the ages.<eos> When I get mine, I stay home from school, because I don't want to have an "accident."<eos> - Accident?
Does she have a favorite colour?<eos> Oh, um, I couldn't say that... for certain.<eos> But... she loves trees and flowers and such.<eos> She's got a lot of romantic notions about life.<eos> So maybe something with a little flounce?<eos> Ruffles perhaps?<eos> And she's got a longing for a certain type of sleeve.<eos> With, um with air... on the sides...<eos> Puff sleeves?<eos> De rigueur.
Mother could hardly keep us apart since you saved Minnie May.<eos> Even Aunt Josephine said she'd be glad to see you again, and she doesn't like anyone.<eos> Wasn't she only staying while your parents were away?<eos> No, no, she's come to stay with us for at least a month.<eos> I don't quite know how we'll stand it.<eos> She's so very particular.<eos> But she's suffered a loss - she's grieving - so she's disinclined to be home alone in Charlottetown<eos> - since her companion passed away.<eos> - Her companion?<eos> Her best friend forever and ever.
I-I should let you know immediately that what you heard just now had nothing to do with romance.<eos> - I see. - Nothing whatsoever.<eos> I couldn't be less interested in Gil... that boy.<eos> I've got much better things to do.<eos> You certainly seem like someone with many possible outcomes.<eos> Oh, you've no idea how much it heartens me to hear you say that.<eos> My advice is to let your ambitions and your aspirations be your guide.<eos> But I have so many.<eos> Oh, good. Plenty of time yet. If you're lucky.<eos> Right. Lucky.
I only wanted you to know that me and my hand Jerry, we'd be real happy to help out.<eos> We'll come on over in the spring if you like.<eos> Get you back up and running.<eos> That's very kind.<eos> Truth is, uh I never really wanted to be a farmer.<eos> Well, I'd best get to it.<eos> As I was saying, I wonder if you could settle up today.<eos> Shame about that vessel.<eos> Word on the street is, you had crops aboard.<eos> Vessel?
Dangerous?<eos> It's going to take a very long time to heal.<eos> He's gonna need months of rest, with no stress or work of any kind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You should be asleep.<eos> So should you.<eos> Wish I had a head for numbers.<eos> I'm a dunce at geometry, but I'm pretty good at math now.<eos> Which part is troublesome?<eos> Here and... and here.
Intelligence? Meaning what?<eos> Espionage.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Spying. For the Crown?<eos> I'm sorry, that's all I can reveal.<eos> [chuckling] What a crock.<eos> - Amethyst.<eos> Don't care.<eos> That is a very special brooch.<eos> Not to me.
I don't like the city.<eos> I remember you now from the big fire.<eos> I'm Jerry.<eos> Gilbert.<eos> Need my help with anything? Anything I can do?<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> And come home someday.<eos> Hope everything works out.<eos> For you, too.<eos> Au revoir.
Is she at home?<eos> - Who shall I say is calling?<eos> - Anne of Green Gables.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, Rollings, these are my guests!<eos> Come in, come in, come in from the cold!<eos> I was beginning to think you weren't coming.<eos> Oh, my dear Anne, it's very good to see you.<eos> Dear me! Whatever's happened to you?<eos> Rollings, take poor, um... - Jerry.<eos> - ...
I never...<eos> At 'ome, I don't have my own bed.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There's so many of us, this is how we sleep.<eos> Don't worry, I don't kick like my sisters.<eos> [chuckling] You'd better not.<eos> Everything will be alright.<eos> It'll be alright.<eos> Thank you for providing us with such a lovely port in the storm.<eos> Merci beaucoup.
And to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned...<eos> And it's now that God changes the bread into the body of Christ and the wine into His blood.<eos> There's going to be a bell that we ring here, and that dates back from the old days, where everything was in Latin and no one knew what was going on, so the bell meant "this bit's important".<eos> For on the night he was betrayed... he himself took bread... and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying,<eos> "Take this, all of you, and eat of it..." "for this is my body, which will be given up for you."<eos> In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,<eos> "Take this, all of you, and drink of it..." "for this is the chalice of my blood..."<eos> You dirty, filthy beast.<eos> You horror!<eos> "The blood..."

Lisa!<eos> I've, erm... I've had a barney with the area manager, after she sacked me.<eos> Sacked you?<eos> What, for being late?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, no, not quite, but if I hadn't have been late, then she wouldn't have opened up and found an IOU for 60 quid.<eos> So, yeah, basically for being late.<eos> - Sorry. - Thanks.<eos> - Why do people go to Mass, Father?<eos> - Lots of reasons.
The cost?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know last year a few families got into debt with everything, you know, the dress, the party, other bits and pieces.<eos> And I just think this year there'll be more doing it.<eos> But the ceremony itself costs nothing, Father.<eos> We ask them every year to keep it simple, and they just get more and more, well... vulgar.<eos> But there's one thing we could ask them to do.<eos> Yeah?<eos> We could ask them to do it in their school uniform.<eos> No suits, no fancy frocks.
Yeah.<eos> How much?<eos> 30.<eos> No, I'm selling. I'm not pawning.<eos> It's the same thing.<eos> Emerald.<eos> Yep.<eos> Blame Frankie for that.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Dettori.
Yeah.<eos> Are they just as frequent?<eos> More.<eos> I have done one or two decent things in my life, Peter, I really have, but I never flash back to THEM.<eos> It's on answer.<eos> 'You've reached Father Michael Kerrigan.<eos> I can't get 'to the phone at the moment.<eos> 'If you'd like to leave a message and your phone number,<eos> 'I'll get back to you as soon as possible.<eos> Um...
She's sick.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You know?<eos> Yeah, she phoned me, said she couldn't make the meeting, so I thought I'd bring it all round.<eos> I'll give it to her.<eos> There's stuff I said we'd talk about.<eos> No, she's too sick for that.<eos> I'm a priest.<eos> I'm used to seeing sick people.<eos> Dead ones, even.
I've got to be there or Mam's got to be there, so...<eos> All right, I'll go with YOU, then.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> No.<eos> - They like it when I go for them.<eos> - Summat wrong?<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> Come 'ere, trouble!<eos> - Who's this for?<eos> - Grandma.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You took her ring.<eos> - Yeah, but... I didn't sell it.<eos> Look, I didn't sell it.<eos> I couldn't sell it. Look.<eos> Please, don't say anything, will you, please?<eos> Please don't...<eos> Who's that for?<eos> My mam.
I think it's as basic as that.<eos> Fear of, ignorance of, Contempt for the bodies of women.<eos> "It's all right," you might say, These old men will soon be dead...<eos> But they've taught younger men, And those younger men will, In turn, teach younger men, And so it will continue, This fear of, ignorance of,<eos> Contempt for the bodies of women. Female priests, female bishops, A female pope...<eos> That's what our church needs.<eos> How confidential is this?<eos> Utterly.<eos> There's no getout clauses in that, no?<eos> No, none.
Now, I'm telling you all of this. So you've got the chance to Address this in your final, Definitive statement.<eos> Don't worry if this final statement. Differs from your earlier statements.<eos> It happens.<eos> Noone's sees those Earlier statements anyway, Just your final... Definitive one.<eos> So, noone's going to think you've Folded or bottled it or whatever.<eos> Well, I can see you've Got a houseful, so, er...<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> Have you been speaking to joe mason, sir?<eos> No.<eos> Bye.
They're not here to support you, Mate. They're here to crush you.<eos> Come on!<eos> Look, you've thought about it,<eos> You've weighed things up, you've Shown what a real good man you are.<eos> Now just strap on a pair and play For the team, you selfish prick!<eos> What about you, mum?<eos> You're quiet.<eos> This what you think?<eos> Fuck the police.<eos> And him.
We had a session this morning, but once a day with Riggs is about all I can handle.<eos> But he said that you two had a...<eos> Damn it, Riggs.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Does Dino Brant work here?<eos> Dino?<eos> Uh, I think he's in the back taking a smoke break.<eos> Do you mind if I head on back there?<eos> We're old friends.<eos> Prison?
Slower?<eos> DNA points to his brother.<eos> I should make you get down on your knees and beg for my forgiveness.<eos> I know that's supposed to be scary, but I am titillated.<eos> Get back to being sorry, fast.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I am.<eos> And I think that Dino's being silent to protect his brother.<eos> So I'm gonna need a favor.<eos> What kind of favor?
Kamekona, you're no good!<eos> Treat your workers like you should!<eos> Three, four, we don't want this shirt no more!<eos> One, two, three four, we don't want this shirt no more!<eos> Finally.<eos> Treat your workers like you should! Took you long enough.<eos> Please tell me this is not the, the emergency you called us about.<eos> Dang right. You got to arrest this guy.<eos> And get him off my beach!<eos> Your cousin?
If you can't arrest him, at least buy a delicious breakfast shrimp loco moco.<eos> Well, I-I definitely can't do that.<eos> That would be crossing a picket line.<eos> I'm from a union family.<eos> And I'm a friend of the working man.<eos> Crossing the line is just something that we do not do.<eos> Socialist.<eos> How about you, McGarrett?<eos> Excuse me, just for a second, please.<eos> Yeah, Chin.
Guess the Coast Guard just fished a body out of the water.<eos> Do me a favor, would you stay here and make sure these two don't kill each other please?<eos> I'll meet you back at the shop in a little bit. To-go bag?<eos> I got to go. Sorry.<eos> I thought we was ohana.<eos> She was found floating about five miles offshore.<eos> Judging from the state of decomp, she's been dead and in the water for three or four days.<eos> Cause of death?<eos> Multiple blunt force trauma to the back of the head.<eos> Multiple?
Africa, Dominican Republic.<eos> Struck out every place, so he decided to try his luck here on Oahu.<eos> Sharks are a family god here.<eos> So if locals found out that he was here to kill a great white, they'd probably want to do the same thing to him.<eos> Boom. So anybody specific?<eos> This lady.<eos> Her name's Lily O'Neill.<eos> She's very big in the conservation world.<eos> They call her...<eos> the Shark Whisperer.
I told Leia she was welcome to stay there.<eos> This is her bungalow right here.<eos> She had the back room, all to herself. Back here.<eos> It looks like Leia might have done some exploring.<eos> Or had plans to.<eos> Maybe she went walking along the cliff, and got too close to the edge, fell off?<eos> That definitely would have killed her.<eos> It's a 1,600 foot drop into the ocean.<eos> Yeah, except her injuries aren't consistent with that kind of a fall.<eos> Chin...
Chicago here fills his thick head with the idea of unionizing.<eos> And then this morning, McGarrett and Williams refuse to do their civic duty by squashing this unrest.<eos> Now Five-O wants my help?<eos> Sorry, sistah.<eos> Not how it works.<eos> Come on now, big fella.<eos> Kamekona, this isn't just about us.<eos> If you help us find the person we're looking for, you'd be helping the mano, which you know is sacred to a lot of people in Hawaii, including me.<eos> The shark is my family's aumakua.<eos> Mine, too.
Come on, guys. Everybody gather round.<eos> I don't like these budget cuts any more than you do, but I want you to know I'm in this with you.<eos> I've cut my expenses.<eos> All the execs are flying coach.<eos> But I do want you to feel like you have a voice in this.<eos> So, not only is my office door always open to you, I've actually had it removed.<eos> That's a very powerful metaphor, boss. That's a very powerful metaphor, boss.<eos> Kenny, thanks for keeping it light.<eos> So good.<eos> Happy birthday!
Amen, sister.<eos> Oh, come on, you started without me?<eos> No, we finished without you.<eos> Yeah, we wanted it work.<eos> I guess you also wanted it to be really simplistic, Because right there, you can make it better if you just added... Okay.<eos> So, right there, You can make it better if you just added...<eos> Okay, I thought you said you were done!<eos> Okay, Mitchell, I love you.<eos> But...?<eos> No "but."
- Well, I think I can do this.<eos> "This American Life," I'm Ira Glass.<eos> Today's program...<eos> "Puppy Love."<eos> We'll hear the story of a man who met his soul mate through a lost schnauzer,<eos> A beagle from Coos Bay, Oregon, who, for one week, was mayor.<eos> And we start with Act 1, a search-and-rescue collie looking for his owner, who was buried alive for 18 days.<eos> After drinking his own urine for a week,<eos> Horace Laughton could no longer ignore the terrible truth... He was running out of oxygen.<eos> H-help.
W-Where's the fire and brimstone?<eos> Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We're already there!<eos> Obviously, I would prefer if you weren't living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I'm very happy for you.<eos> And what "special circumstances" are those?<eos> Oh, boy, I think it's about to get bad.<eos> Shelly, how do I put this?<eos> By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.<eos> What, so... You thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?<eos> No!<eos> Just for the middle part.
We've known about evolution since 1859.<eos> She still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat.<eos> This could have all been avoided if you'd only listened to me.<eos> Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.<eos> You "managed the situation."<eos> That's right.<eos> So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.<eos> Not your whole life!
So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.<eos> Not your whole life!<eos> I mean, science. You got that.<eos> Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king.<eos> But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.<eos> I have gotten much better at that.<eos> Have you?<eos> How am I feeling right now?<eos> What the... How should I know?<eos> Excited? Itchy?
Kept me dry all morning.<eos> And a dry is a smart boy.<eos> Ugh, he keeps saying that.<eos> Charles, you've gotten negative reactions from everyone who's heard it.<eos> I needed to see what Jake thought.<eos> - Oh, I hated it.<eos> - Really?<eos> Anyway, gentlemen, we are off to catch some more convicts.<eos> Two more, and we win.<eos> Huh, just two?

We can use Big Bertha to tap into the security cameras.<eos> This room is clear, but check that closet.<eos> Man, this is like playing the coolest video game ever.<eos> My character is Terry.<eos> - It's locked.<eos> - Ooh, kick it down.<eos> Front kick! Front kick!<eos> - All clear.<eos> - Now strafe.<eos> Strafe!
- Barrel roll.<eos> Duck.<eos> - Duck?<eos> Just tell me where to go, man.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Slide one of your feet forward.<eos> Now switch.<eos> Now punch both your fists forward at the same time.<eos> Are you making me do the running man? Yeah.<eos> The original one.
- Duck?<eos> Just tell me where to go, man.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Slide one of your feet forward.<eos> Now switch.<eos> Now punch both your fists forward at the same time.<eos> Are you making me do the running man? Yeah.<eos> The original one.<eos> Excluding the movie.<eos> And Stephen King's classic short story.
Sarge, just hang on.<eos> I'm coming for you.<eos> Drop the weapon.<eos> - You drop your weapon.<eos> - Okay, stay cool.<eos> We can work this out. I'm a trained hostage negotiator.<eos> I got my friend's sperm back from his ex-wife last year.<eos> Well, she destroyed half of it, and he decided to adopt, but...<eos> - Peralta!<eos> - Right.
Crap, he's getting away!<eos> All right.<eos> We can run right through it.<eos> These suits are fire-resistant.<eos> These suits are not fire-resistant.<eos> They're not?<eos> Then why are they so expensive?<eos> Bye, Peralta.<eos> No!<eos> Judy!
Oh, my God. This is the worst day of my life.<eos> - Where's Charles?<eos> - So, if you're not friends, you won't mind if I waste him, right?<eos> Of course he minds.<eos> I mean, sure, we're enemies, but in, like, a playful way, like Tom and Jerry.<eos> Oh, my God. Was Tom trying to eat Jerry?<eos> - My whole life is a lie.<eos> - Shoot him. No, no, no. Those can't be my last words.<eos> Uh, ay caramba.<eos> What the hell?
Same type of bomb they used in Oklahoma City.<eos> - Where is this guy now?<eos> - We have a BOLO out on his car, and we're tracking his credit cards.<eos> - My God!<eos> - What?<eos> We just got a hit on facial recognition for him.<eos> Where?<eos> Here, in this building.<eos> He just exited the third floor elevator.<eos> Counterterrorism Division.
- All right. So, how does passing on a few names turn into a terror attack?<eos> It was Boyd's idea.<eos> Come again?<eos> Are you saying an agent told you to start building ANFO bombs?<eos> He wanted me to gauge the group's interest in acting on their anger.<eos> The pipeline is gonna break ground on March 25th.<eos> He wanted to know if that was an enticing target.<eos> I brought it up.<eos> People went along.<eos> March 25th.
Genesis 3:25.<eos> That's the codename for your pipeline attack?<eos> Genesis means the beginning, and we were gonna end it.<eos> By what, blowing it up?<eos> Boyd and his team were gonna swoop in before anything got deadly.<eos> What you're describing is entrapment.<eos> Now, my office does not radicalize people or create a terror cell just to take them down.<eos> - Agent Boyd.<eos> - I can explain this.<eos> My office, now.
You know, sometimes I look at you, and I feel like you've maybe never had a carefree day in your whole life.<eos> You gotta learn how to relax.<eos> Hey, not bad for a first-timer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I still can't believe you have never played. Skee-ball before, how is that even possible?<eos> I know we said the past is just the past, but this is much more mysterious than your tattoos.<eos> Well, let's just say I had a very unusual childhood.<eos> So, what will this get us?<eos> How does a brand-new - pencil eraser sound?<eos> - Kinda boring.
And, as I've no idea who he is, I can't have seen him before.<eos> They're both questions concerning identity.<eos> Would you like to rephrase?<eos> - Now you listen to me --<eos> - Just tell us what happened this morning.<eos> The Michonnet woman arrived with her overcooked pastries.<eos> She's the neighbour who raised the alarm.<eos> She works for you?<eos> She provides food.<eos> Of a description.
And then I went... into the garage.<eos> Which I'm not going to do again, however much you try and force me!<eos> No-one's going to try to force you to do anything.<eos> - Moers?<eos> - I hope you're not going to ask me if I know who he is, Maigret.<eos> His clothes are from all over the place.<eos> The suit's English.<eos> The shirt's French.<eos> - What weapon was used?<eos> - A small pistol.
He was killed somewhere else.<eos> Poor soul.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If his clothes are from all over the place he might travel for a living.<eos> And the item of clothing you're most likely to buy near where you live are your shoes.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh!<eos> Are they for me?<eos> They are, my darling.<eos> From Rouen.
My son's name is Sievens.<eos> With the given name Carl.<eos> My daughter's name is Else.<eos> And when is the last time you were in contact with them, Ambassador?<eos> They are the youngest of my family, close from an early age.<eos> And there was always something wild about them.<eos> Illicit relationships.<eos> Playboy lifestyles.<eos> My son grew up with no sense of duty.<eos> To his family or his country.
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Yehei shmeh rabba... .. mevarakh lealam ulalmey almaya.<eos> I tried to get you to walk away from this one, but you were greedy.<eos> You said the more we had, the better our new life would be.<eos> Oh, Isaac.<eos> ~<eos> Where were you going?<eos> America.
How did you know that?<eos> Because I know you.<eos> Are you smiling?<eos> 'So is Louis going to leave Claire for his mistress? '<eos> How do you know I checked that?<eos> Because I know YOU.<eos> Chez Mirielle doesn't keep rooms.<eos> But Louis rents a function room there every Tuesday, so I told Claire she's got nothing to worry about.<eos> Why does he rent a function room?<eos> Poker.
Y'all get ready to watch Big Momma's House.<eos> Our in-flight entertainment today will be Under the Tuscan Sun.<eos> Ooh, I like that.<eos> I hear it's good.<eos> Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?<eos> Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.<eos> W-What do you mean, "a break"? You don't have to fly the plane?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I just take a short break sometimes.<eos> Short break?
Yum. Prepare to die.<eos> You first!<eos> That's what you think.<eos> Peter! Grab on to something!<eos> I grabbed my own belt.<eos> Attention, passengers, I know we're being hijacked, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out that we're presently passing over Yosemite National Park.<eos> That is truly awe-inspiring!<eos> It certainly is.<eos> And you know what you don't see from up here?<eos> Borders.
Brian, please, I trust that this handsome young customer knows what he's talking about.<eos> Oh, my, and I thought only bees pour on the honey.<eos> I'm going inside.<eos> So, are you from around here?<eos> No I'm just in town for the John Singer Sargent exhibit at the museum.<eos> Really?<eos> I've been looking for an excuse to go again.<eos> Well, looks like I won't need that audio tour.<eos> Great. Give me one minute. Let me text my fiancée.<eos> Your what?
Total superfood.<eos> Full of GMOs.<eos> GMOs are bad.<eos> No GMOs whatsoever.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Wow, this is great, we've only been here an hour and we're almost totally sold out.<eos> Yes, I didn't see that coming.<eos> Just like Dan Cortese didn't see the end of the '90s coming.<eos> Three... two... one...<eos> Happy New Year!
I was just kidding.<eos> You were kidding?<eos> ! What was the joke? !<eos> This was!<eos> Oh, damn it, you hit the seam!<eos> Yeah. You know what? You're a jerk, Gronk!<eos> That's it, I'm getting rid of that bastard.<eos> Just like I helped kick the British out of America.<eos> This tyranny shall not stand!<eos> For without liberty...
Up to 50% of US food is wasted, despite being quite edible, so what we do is, we...<eos> So, in the garbage.<eos> And then you saw the body?<eos> I felt. I was climbing out, and I touched something like a wig, but...<eos> Get their info, will you?<eos> You got it.<eos> So, this is what you look like.<eos> It's what I look like with a layer of paint and this uncomfortable wig, so don't get used to it.<eos> Just with me being the alt weekly cover girl.<eos> - The what?
Katty was doing inperson epidemiological data assembly, tracking a probable vector of the Aleutian flu cluster.<eos> Doing interviews, tracking the spread of the virus.<eos> Probable vector?<eos> So, you know how it got here?<eos> We traced the first cases to an Air Liberte flight from Paris to SeaTac.<eos> Our team's been interviewing everyone on the flight.<eos> Ms. Kupps was tracking passengers in first class.<eos> According to her record, she had four left.<eos> Now, unless you have any further questions specific to Ms. Kupps, I have work to do.<eos> Good day.
Was buying me a drink a weird hint to stay at the bar?<eos> No. I just... I...<eos> I thought my fortune had peaked with the appreciative smile.<eos> Unless you're a hooker.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Yeah, it was a joke.<eos> Um... I mean, I was saying that that's why you would talk to me...<eos> Um, looking like you do.<eos> How is it that I look?<eos> Like, way out of my league.
Now how am I supposed to follow that?<eos> You owe it to yourself to try.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I'm completely naked...<eos> Excellent start.<eos> Clive Babineaux.<eos> You expecting something from the CDC?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Fax.<eos> No cover.
Do you know what time it is?<eos> Carey Gold?<eos> Patrice is your daughter?<eos> Everyone.<eos> Everyone. Can I have your attention?<eos> Everyone, if I may?<eos> A toast!<eos> To Major Lillywhite.<eos> A good man, a good friend.<eos> Too pretty?
Carey Gold?<eos> Patrice is your daughter?<eos> Everyone.<eos> Everyone. Can I have your attention?<eos> Everyone, if I may?<eos> A toast!<eos> To Major Lillywhite.<eos> A good man, a good friend.<eos> Too pretty?<eos> Too human?
Patrice is your daughter?<eos> Everyone.<eos> Everyone. Can I have your attention?<eos> Everyone, if I may?<eos> A toast!<eos> To Major Lillywhite.<eos> A good man, a good friend.<eos> Too pretty?<eos> Too human?<eos> Too tan?
Or we can order room service.<eos> I should get going.<eos> It's probably getting late.<eos> You know, I have to, confess something to you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I've been thinking about you since we met at the Baracus fundraiser.<eos> Sure I can't talk you into staying?<eos> Perhaps joining me in the shower?<eos> You know that guy?<eos> What guy?
The egg!<eos> I don't want to do this, but you leave me no choice.<eos> Captain, you were right.<eos> The rebel ship has entered an underground passage.<eos> Let us pass, or I destroy the egg.<eos> Saw, you don't want to do this.<eos> I know you believe you're doing the right thing, but...<eos> Our enemy shows no mercy. Neither can we.<eos> If you harm that egg, you're helping the Empire wipe out the last of his kind.<eos> The last of his family.
You can wield it to do the opposite.<eos> Wield it?<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Kanan, tell him he's crazy.<eos> Consider what he has to say.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> I don't think it's a coincidence this saber came into your possession.<eos> Yeah, but, Kanan, that doesn't mean she can fight with it.<eos> No offense.
Actually, I can't think at all.<eos> Is this about your office again?<eos> It doesn't promote quality thought.<eos> A good thinking spot is key.<eos> I like the library.<eos> How can your mind breathe with all those musty books suffocating you?<eos> Well, what would you suggest?<eos> A place with much oxygen.<eos> - The forest.<eos> - Qasim.
It was a communication to Chen from the pilot, Paul Miller.<eos> It was at 8:12 a.m., right before Chen turned his car away from the airport.<eos> Pilot tipped him off. Yeah.<eos> But how did the pilot know that Willoughby was a setup?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you got it, boss.<eos> I've officially been released, all right?<eos> Go ahead, call him back and tell him.<eos> What?<eos> Gibbs.
I don't want her to know anything else.<eos> I like your bracelet.<eos> Whenever Paul flew somewhere, he'd bring a charm back for her.<eos> Right, baby?<eos> This is so cool.<eos> Eiffel Tower... a little shoe.<eos> It's a clog from Amsterdam.<eos> This is a pyramid.<eos> Where's it from again, Mom?<eos> Cairo.
NSA has a new recording from last night.<eos> Same two callers.<eos> Get it to Qasim.<eos> Torres.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm the only one who's had contact with Chen's organization, so you want me to spend all night reading through this stack of drivel to see if anything flags.<eos> Do you like steak?<eos> Do you marinate?<eos> Purist.
What is so urgent?<eos> Where are the others?<eos> Officer Moreau.<eos> There is no meeting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> We got a mole.<eos> You mean, someone other than Reeves tipped off the pilot?<eos> Miller was never tipped off.<eos> And the fake transmission between Chen and him came to us from the VSSE.<eos> From you.
A-Are you suggesting that I told him?<eos> Not suggesting.<eos> Yes, I'm here.<eos> Do we have the rest of the task force?<eos> We record everything in MTAC.<eos> We got one hell of a forensic scientist.<eos> And she compared your voice to Caller X in the Pashto conversations.<eos> I'd like to make a call.<eos> I bet you would.<eos> Qasim?
That's good to know.<eos> I've been sitting here for over an hour, thinking about codes within codes, and still, I have nothing.<eos> But... you tried the library.<eos> I love the library.<eos> Well, I just had about ten plants delivered to your office.<eos> My own little thinking forest.<eos> Yep.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Somebody call 911!<eos> Qasim.
Well, I just had about ten plants delivered to your office.<eos> My own little thinking forest.<eos> Yep.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Somebody call 911!<eos> Qasim.<eos> Hey.<eos> Three gunshot wounds to the chest. B.P. 70/40 and dropping.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Qasim.
I-I needed the money.<eos> My son...<eos> I'm not asking you why you got into bed with a terrorist.<eos> I want to know why Chen let Willoughby play out to the point of blowing up his own plane.<eos> Willoughby kept the task force tied up for months.<eos> And that was a positive as far as Chen was concerned.<eos> And he knew that his pilot had come to trust you.<eos> He thought Miller might've turned.<eos> That explosion was meant to take us both out.<eos> Qasim Naasir.
Seven years ago, when you hacked my company, I knew you had a past.<eos> - I'll see you on Monday.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> Glad you all could make it.<eos> I'd make introductions, but I think probably best we keep this a no-names type thing.<eos> Now, then, if everybody's ready, we've got a lot of work to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before we get down to business, we got to talk terms.<eos> Terms?
Yeah.<eos> Word is, this isn't just any job.<eos> From what I hear, we're going up against the cops.<eos> So I'm thinking it's time to renegotiate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard the same thing.<eos> Way I see it, that's worth at least double.<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> Anyone else feel like haggling?<eos> Okay, then.
I'm fully aware of this, Gideon.<eos> Well, you say that, yeah, but you drag me up from the workshop to examine an APB call, aka a rivet.<eos> All right, but it's not just an APB call.<eos> You're the target.<eos> She's right, Gideon.<eos> This came in ten minutes ago.<eos> An online video was posted, and we've been getting calls from all over the city.<eos> Play it for him.<eos> Weaponized drones.<eos> Warrantless surveillance.
Bomb squad's suiting up, but listen, Cap?<eos> This doesn't feel like your garden-variety bomb threat.<eos> Safe to assume this is the surprise we were promised.<eos> 1305, what about suspects?<eos> My gut says they ditched their clothes and masks, blended in with what's left of the crowd.<eos> We're looking at a few possibles right now.<eos> Good chances they're just here hanging with the lookie-loos.<eos> Stand by, Squad.<eos> Check the guy with the hoodie.<eos> - Which one?
Headed straight towards the station.<eos> We're talking about anyone who was actually involved.<eos> - I can't say...<eos> - 1305, multiple reports of suspicious vehicles inbound toward the station.<eos> Request immediate assistance.<eos> Thank you.<eos> 1305, Squad, what are we looking at?<eos> Sending you video from multiple APB users now.<eos> More men in red masks.<eos> What the hell?
I can feel it.<eos> There. You see that?<eos> A red sedan.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> That guy, he was at the building!<eos> 1305, Squad, suspect identified.<eos> White male, six foot tall, heading north on Allen Street.<eos> Chicago police, stop!<eos> Damn it, I said stop.<eos> What the hell?
I know, because they interrupted my lunch.<eos> - I think I found something.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.<eos> You mean to tell me six guys in masks walked into a building with backpacks full of modeling clay wired to clock radios?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Hey, I need to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, uh, keep me posted.<eos> - Conrad!<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> What the hell?
- And you know this because...?<eos> - Because...<eos> Listen, I have been trying to get Gideon on his phone all day, it's dead.<eos> I've been trying Murphy on her radio, still nothing.<eos> We have been run all over the city chasing shadows at the exact same time that we can't get in touch with Gideon and Murphy.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Who's in the area?<eos> Attention, all available units, we need someone at 516 Pandora Lane immediately.<eos> There's a situation at Gideon's.<eos> 1306.
All right.<eos> Let's go around back.<eos> - It's not working.<eos> - Oh, I can see that, I can see that.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'm gonna try something else.<eos> Gideon, there is a bomb heating up in here.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm trying to send a signal to Gertrude.<eos> The robot?
The stuff that I work on down here is highly experimental.<eos> And completely illegal!<eos> The guy in the mask might be crazy, but he's not wrong.<eos> On the ground!<eos> Get on the ground now!<eos> They're about to get it.<eos> Mask off, gloves off.<eos> Game on.<eos> Come and get me.<eos> Drives down the lane.
So this was our only shot.<eos> All this would have been over.<eos> Just get up.<eos> No. Wait, wait. Where are you... where are you taking me?<eos> I wanted to do this the easy way. But you left me no choice.<eos> So now I'm going to take down Rittenhouse one member at a time.<eos> So for as long as it takes.<eos> Flynn just jumped again?<eos> Yeah, to Illinois this time.<eos> May 30, 1893.
We're trapped in here!<eos> Can anyone hear me?<eos> Help!<eos> You have to stop yelling.<eos> This chamber is soundproofed and airtight.<eos> We can't use up all the oxygen.<eos> How do you know it's airtight?<eos> Because I'm an architect, and I've been staring at the room for the last 20 minutes.<eos> So any ideas on food?<eos> Water?
So, Charlotte told me that, um, you met Mr. Westmorland.<eos> He came and looked at me.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - After the French Doctor.<eos> She says Delphine was very nice.<eos> Did, um, did he tell you what kind of cancer you have?<eos> Uh, Willem's tumour.<eos> "Wilms'" tumour, right? Yeah.<eos> You must be very tough.<eos> Cosima...
Go.<eos> Been expecting me, Sarah?<eos> Sod off.<eos> I wanted you to find me. Sweetheart.<eos> You have no idea the volcano that outfit is inspiring in me right now.<eos> Turn around... slowly.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - Let's talk about this.<eos> - Oh, I think it's about time, Rachel, you started following my instructions, don't you?<eos> Veera Suominen.
And one day soon, he's going to come back and save us all.<eos> One day...<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> It's me, Nardie!<eos> No...<eos> Wait.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> That first time, with the Heather creature chasing us, where did we run away to?<eos> - Australia.
It all really happened.<eos> - Where have you been? !<eos> - That hurt me, that really hurt me!<eos> I needed you!<eos> Well, I got contaminated by that bacteria in the lab, didn't I?<eos> I was laid up for six weeks.<eos> If I was human, I would have died.<eos> Right now, you'd be talking to...<eos> Come to think of it, who were you talking to?<eos> My...

He'll get us on board the prison ship.<eos> Security is really tight, obviously, but Nardole says there's not been much in the way of resistance since the Monks took over, so they're more worried about the Doctor getting out than anyone getting in.<eos> But what we don't want is for them to do a spot-check on our identity papers.<eos> Papers!<eos> Spot check.<eos> Nardole doesn't have any, and I'm down as university kitchen staff.<eos> It's them!<eos> All right, what are you waiting for?<eos> We need to get this stuff on board.<eos> Chop chop.
This is real.<eos> You...<eos> You're actually...<eos> You're actually doing this.<eos> Do you have any idea how hard the past few months have been?<eos> How hard it's been to hold onto to the truth?<eos> It would have been so easy to just give in and believe their lies.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I fought against it.<eos> For you!
Racism.<eos> People who talk in cinemas!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> This would be an incredibly sophisticated transmitter, powerful enough to beam highly detailed propaganda to the entire world 24 hours a day, and you're going to plug your brain into it?<eos> I know.<eos> It doesn't stand a chance.<eos> That's odd, there's no Monks guarding the entrance.<eos> Come away from the window.<eos> How many Monks were there?<eos> - About 12 Monks there.
Push it into every corner.<eos> Mum!<eos> She's filling its mind with one pure, uncorrupted, irresistible image.<eos> And it's broadcasting it to the world, because it can't help it.<eos> All those years you kept her alive inside you, an isolated subroutine in a living mind.<eos> Perfect, untouchable.<eos> She's a window on the world without the Monks.<eos> Absolutely loved, absolutely trusted.<eos> And that window is opening everywhere.<eos> A glimpse of freedom.
- Cool, cool, cool.<eos> Have a lot of fun tonight. Have fun. Okay?<eos> - Fun at ladies' night.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Ladies night!<eos> You're such a lightweight.<eos> I feel fine.<eos> Hell of a ladies' night, though.<eos> A lot of secrets came out last night, didn't they?<eos> Secrets?
- There's no sound in there!<eos> - He's a gentle lover! - You're just there with the phone - and there's no sound.<eos> - Hello. You don't understand. Oh, hey.<eos> Yeah, it's not so easy, is it?<eos> Can't just snap your fingers and become a couple of Calvin Harrises-e-es.<eos> Listen, this is all part of our process, okay?<eos> - So beat it. - Yeah. Shoo.<eos> We got a song to write that's gonna give you the best damn aural you have ever had.<eos> Check yourself.<eos> Oh, A-U-R-A-L.
- Yeah, okay.<eos> I did!<eos> - Lay it on me.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Stop.<eos> - What?<eos> - What? You're barely seconds in.<eos> Throbbing bass, the lone whistle, the gritty caw of gears grinding.<eos> This is clearly the work of Tim Bergling, better known as... Swedish EDM demigod...<eos> - Avicii. - Avicii...
I don't know. I didn't count, but I started feeling...<eos> Feeling?<eos> Like I'd had enough.<eos> So, you left... in your car.<eos> - That's the thing. - Okay.<eos> What is?<eos> Um, I don't know if it was giving blood or the alcohol or both, but I don't remember.<eos> You're saying you blacked out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> From the car wreck?
That's over twice the legal limit.<eos> And he was on painkillers.<eos> We got what... 48 hours before we got to put him before a judge for probable cause?<eos> I don't want to charge a decorated firefighter with this, but can't have it look like I'm giving him preferential treatment.<eos> I'm giving you 24 hours.<eos> After that, he gets shipped down to 26th and Cal.<eos> What do you mean I can't see him?<eos> Am I not speaking clearly?<eos> He is in custody.<eos> - No visitors except his lawyer.
- I'm his union rep.<eos> Vehicular homicide is not a union matter.<eos> I don't have a hacksaw blade hidden up my wazoo.<eos> I just want to check on him.<eos> - Randy...<eos> - I am asking... bend the rules this one time, or I'm not coming home tonight.<eos> What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> You okay?<eos> Not really.
All right, where we at with the Camaro?<eos> We know that the plates were stolen.<eos> And I can try to get the registered owner down here, see if we can stumble on something else.<eos> I think we've stumbled on enough tonight.<eos> I want something solid.<eos> I already started working on the BOLO.<eos> I'll have CPIC and the state police put out an All Call message over ISPERN and all the city-wides.<eos> - Your office, Sergeant. - Yeah.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Lieutenant.
All right.<eos> What the hell, Kev?<eos> Reece, what's up, dog?<eos> How you doing?<eos> You working on these?<eos> This for a beemer?<eos> Man, you coming up in the world now, Reece.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Who's this for?<eos> Nobody.
Reece, what's up, dog?<eos> How you doing?<eos> You working on these?<eos> This for a beemer?<eos> Man, you coming up in the world now, Reece.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Who's this for?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Tell me who it's for, or you're gonna get the matching one.<eos> - Zadra.
That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Who's this for?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Tell me who it's for, or you're gonna get the matching one.<eos> - Zadra.<eos> - Zadra who?<eos> Michael Zadra.<eos> Runs stolen rides out of Rogers Park.<eos> He usually deals in the basics, you know?<eos> Hondas and Toyotas.
Never mind.<eos> You know, you're real quick on your feet, Bob.<eos> I could learn a lot from you.<eos> Didn't you tell me you were. Salesman of the Year, '07 to '09? Yeah, I was.<eos> Don't be so modest, Bob.<eos> Look at this!<eos> Two trophies here, Salesman of the Year, 2007 and 2009.<eos> What happened to 2008?<eos> L-Look, I-I wish we could keep talking here, but I-I really... I need to get back to these lease agreements.<eos> My bad.
- Damned if I ain't.<eos> - You know, I can't seem to figure out how I ended up in here, and you ended up out there.<eos> Didn't you steal my horse?<eos> - Son, I'm gonna give you a word of advice.<eos> You're sittin' at the poker table, and you can't see who the idiot is, it's you.<eos> I saved your life by throwing' you in that box.<eos> You should be thankful.<eos> - Yeah, uh, just what did ya hit me with, anyway?<eos> - Big ol' bottle.<eos> Scotch.
- I am at work.<eos> I'm the jailer.<eos> - Well, that's handy.<eos> - What about me?<eos> You know I have a farm that needs plowing'.<eos> - I'm gonna give you some more advice, son.<eos> Drinking, gambling, and shootin', they don't mix, speaking from personal experience.<eos> Best you stay there till you've learned your lesson.<eos> - I'll need money then.<eos> - Money?
- For breakfast.<eos> You need to feed the prisoner.<eos> - On the other hand, if as a result of my advice to take alcohol only in moderation and to never pull a gun at the poker table, you promise not to do it again, then I'll let you go,<eos> but I'm keeping your gun.<eos> - You can't keep my gun.<eos> You can't keep my gun, please.<eos> - Sullivan, let that idiot out.<eos> - May I help you, marshal?<eos> - Yes, yes, of course, I, I would like to buy a hat.<eos> - What kind of hat?
Slade had this comin' anyway.<eos> Goon! Come get this piece of shit off my pot.<eos> Have a seat, hickok, and I'll take your money.<eos> - God, they never stop.<eos> - Joey!<eos> Joey!<eos> - Texas boys are here.<eos> - Don't get yourself killed now!<eos> - Oh, god almighty.<eos> - Doc!
You're doin' good.<eos> Just stay this quiet in here as you can.<eos> I tell ya one thing, guns are good for business.<eos> - George.<eos> - Can I help ya, son?<eos> - I'm guessin' you heard about young Joey.<eos> It ain't right that a grown boy can't horse around without risking a bullet.<eos> - And you're gonna tell me how to keep that from happenin'?<eos> "The carrying of firearms within city limits "is strictly prohibited."<eos> - No guns at all.
- You used to like it when I moved.<eos> I don't know if you're aware of it, but you're a hero in Joey's eyes.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Tell 'em not to be like you.<eos> - I'll walk you home.<eos> Why?<eos> Who are you tryin' to protect?<eos> Me or poe?<eos> You stay down.<eos> Goddammit.
A few months ago, the Veritas was translated again.<eos> Everyone who worked on the translation and everyone who subsequently read it is now dead.<eos> Your tutor's a what?<eos> An alien.<eos> What do you mean, an alien?<eos> A space one.
What do you mean, an alien?<eos> A space one.<eos> A space alien.<eos> Will you read the Veritas?<eos> So, you're blind and you don't want your enemies to know?<eos> So... your tutor ran a computer simulation...<eos> Well, yeah - more like he got, like, trapped inside one.<eos> Can that happen?<eos> Yeah, he's an alien.<eos> A space one.

Room secure, your Excellency.<eos> This is Miss Potts, sir.<eos> Hi.<eos> Miss Potts, this is the Secretary-General of the UN.<eos> I have flown here today to speak to the President.<eos> I am told you might be able to help.<eos> I don't know the President.<eos> How would I know the President - I wouldn't even have voted for him, he's... orange.<eos> I mean THE President.<eos> The Doctor.
In times of unusual danger, that status is made official.<eos> Turmezistan, near the border. This is a disputed area - potential hot spot.<eos> The Chinese have troops here, the Russians here, the Americans here.<eos> And in the centre...<eos> A pyramid.<eos> Sir, I have Colonel Brabbit on the line.<eos> Colonel Brabbit, you're on with the Secretary-General.<eos> Colonel, what have you to report?<eos> Nothing, sir.<eos> Nothing at all.
We will take this world. We will rule its people.<eos> But only when we're asked.<eos> We will talk again.<eos> When?<eos> At the end of the Earth.<eos> Yeah, mine too.<eos> It's everyone's. 11.57PM.<eos> Did you get that, sir?<eos> Everyone's phone's gone to 11.57.<eos> Yep, same here.
We have to seal off the lab, the greenhouse, everything.<eos> This can't be allowed to get into the atmosphere.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> We can't search a whole planet in a few minutes.<eos> Narrow it down.<eos> They landed the pyramid in the middle of military crisis - what was the point of that?<eos> OK, what was the point?<eos> What was the effect?<eos> They told us the world was ending in a potential war zone - what did we assume was going to happen?<eos> World War Three.
! Sit down and google.<eos> It's never done anything like that before.<eos> Check the mix.<eos> Anything?<eos> Douglas?<eos> Douglas!<eos> Doctor, listen.<eos> What?<eos> Isn't it worth at least just considering doing the deal?<eos> What deal?
It's your world.<eos> Not any more.<eos> OK, back to the pyramid and negotiate our surrender.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Well for a start, I'm going to tell you the truth.<eos> I've been keeping a secret from you.<eos> We can blind them.<eos> That's how we do it - we blind them!<eos> Blind who?<eos> The Monks?
Well for a start, I'm going to tell you the truth.<eos> I've been keeping a secret from you.<eos> We can blind them.<eos> That's how we do it - we blind them!<eos> Blind who?<eos> The Monks?<eos> Bill, go to the pyramid.<eos> Keep an eye on them all.<eos> Nardole, with me.<eos> To the TARDIS.
And I'm the only one left.<eos> Tell them you're flattered but don't.<eos> What does consent mean?<eos> You must ask for our help, and want it, and know you will then be ours.<eos> Only then can the link be formed.<eos> What link?<eos> Do you consent?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I don't even know your name.<eos> Erica.
Come on.<eos> Doctor, what's happening, you OK?<eos> Bill - sorry, slight hitch, working on it.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> 3614 - need it to open the door, but I can't see the numbers.<eos> One minute, 20.<eos> I don't understand the problem.<eos> Combination lock - all the sonic will do is calculate the number,<eos> I still have to enter it.<eos> Nardole!

Okay, this grid represents the room.<eos> All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is and we can find a quiet path to the crib.<eos> It looks like a map from Dungeons Dragons.<eos> Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.<eos> Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.<eos> Okay. Space A-3, here we go.<eos> It's squeaking.<eos> Mark it. It's nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter's going to as well.<eos> Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did.<eos> None.
- If you won't to talk to him, I will.<eos> Just wait, one second.<eos> I've been doing everything I can to make this happen for us and you could've done it with a snap of a finger?<eos> Look, you don't understand and you need to back off.<eos> - You need to get smart.<eos> - If he was helpful, do you think we'd be in Atlanta working out of a salon<eos> - right now? - I don't know.<eos> 'Cause I don't know what you didn't say to him.<eos> Clearly, he needs to hear it from<eos> - somebody else.
Okay. You're a fake ass bitch.<eos> She's a fake ass bitch.<eos> And I thought that I was a stunt queen.<eos> She a fraud.<eos> Her father Roland Crane.<eos> - I can explain.<eos> - I opened up to you like I never did with nobody else.<eos> Why would you front like that?<eos> You know what you are?<eos> A liar.
So, how can I help?<eos> What can I do?<eos> You're always there for me and my kids.<eos> It's the least I can do with everything you helped me with.<eos> That's why I love you.<eos> Carlotta, you don't just believe in the church.<eos> You believe in me.<eos> But why you won't let me more in your world?<eos> Not just here at the church.<eos> At your home.

Look, I am not defending her, but Star's had it... bad.<eos> We all have.<eos> It's how we get through it that counts.<eos> I don't know where I'd be without Jesus by my side.<eos> Maybe you should give him a try, Alexandra.<eos> Thank you for being so kind to me.<eos> I really appreciate it, and I'm sorry that I lied to you and... everyone.<eos> I didn't think it would get this crazy.<eos> So, where you headed?<eos> To New York?
Yeah, well, I can't complain.<eos> Like the color green.<eos> Who don't?<eos> Don't come in here asking me for any money.<eos> - I...<eos> - Hey, man, it's nothing like that.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I got a new act.<eos> A girl group.<eos> A girl...?
I just sound better during the day.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> Look, Hurt Park Studios at 8:00.<eos> I'll text you the address.<eos> An engineer will meet you.<eos> Where are you gonna be?<eos> I got some errands to run, then I'm gonna meet you there.<eos> And look, Star, this guy's a buddy of mine.<eos> All right?<eos> So no shenanigans.
Hey, Mahogany.<eos> Get your ass out here, 911.<eos> Yeah, you got to see this place.<eos> It's too much for Simone, man.<eos> She's climbing the walls.<eos> We got to get her out.<eos> I disagree.<eos> - You disagree?<eos> - Your sister needs help.<eos> Professional help.
No, not really, unless you have some sort of medical degree that I'm not aware of.<eos> And besides that, I know exactly how you feel about her.<eos> Look, Star, she's a mess.<eos> Anyone can see that.<eos> But she needs help.<eos> Real help that you can't give her.<eos> That's my personal opinion. But as your manager, she's an anchor around our neck.<eos> She's weighing us down.<eos> I got big dreams for you, Star.<eos> Not those other girls, for you.
No, they ain't mine.<eos> Might as well be, though.<eos> Y'all are funny.<eos> And I ain't talking about those sweet boys you got here.<eos> All right, you've been straight up with me.<eos> So I'm gonna be straight up with you.<eos> Why you want to work here?<eos> Well, the shop is missing one thing.<eos> What?<eos> Men.
No, that's just Star.<eos> We're not doing it.<eos> Stop, yo.<eos> You better be at rehearsal at 7:00.<eos> We got so much work to do for these live auditions still.<eos> Oh, yeah, some girl group named Glamour's pretty good, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Glamour.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Jahil.
Why do you always think the worst of me?<eos> Wow. You make Madonna look like Cinderella, don't you?<eos> He said we could get whatever we needed for the live auditions.<eos> I'm gonna go tell Cotton.<eos> Who them flowers for?<eos> Oh, they for you, C.<eos> Special delivery.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Who are they from?<eos> Pastor Harris.
You okay?<eos> Why does everything have to be a fight with her?<eos> 'Cause that's all she's ever known.<eos> She don't know how to do nothing else.<eos> Well, if we're ever gonna make it as a group, she needs to get it together.<eos> That's why there ain't no girl groups.<eos> It's always one.<eos> So, who came up with the group name, Mixed Harmony?<eos> You or Mary?<eos> Jahil.
Grow up, Simone.<eos> No, you grow up!<eos> Stop hurting people.<eos> Alex didn't ask for that lead part.<eos> Then she should have said no.<eos> Why can't you put your ego on the shelf for a second and be supportive of someone else for a change?<eos> You didn't act like this when we were kids.<eos> - Nephew.<eos> - Unc!<eos> - Happy birthday.
I didn't mean that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> And you're right, there is something wrong with both of us.<eos> I'm gonna go check on my grandma, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Alex, you are the star.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Heaven.<eos> I met a man, children.<eos> The man.
How 'bout you sing at the rally?<eos> Sing?<eos> No, I'm not doing that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because... it's about Danielle, not us.<eos> Your group should sing.<eos> Protest songs are a tradition.<eos> Odetta sang at the March on Washington.<eos> We're not Odetta.<eos> Especially not Star.
That's why our country is in the state it's in.<eos> Because nobody's willing to stick up for nobody.<eos> You can go back to praying, Pastor.<eos> I hope it helps.<eos> Eva.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, it's about Star.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Yeah, she's just very triste.<eos> Uh, because of her friend.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Where you think you going, Miss Thang?<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> I got a man waiting for me.<eos> Oh. You better quote Valley of the Dolls, bitch.<eos> This is breaking news.<eos> Turn that up.<eos> Good evening.<eos> First and foremost,
Well, what did you expect?<eos> Now let's get the hell out of here.<eos> How many more people have to die before the police are held responsible?<eos> No more!<eos> How many more people have to die<eos> - before the police are held responsible?<eos> - No more!<eos> Say this with me:<eos> No justice, no peace.<eos> No crooked police.

This is not what we're about!<eos> Get off him!<eos> You okay, sir?<eos> About to call you an ambulance.<eos> This is not Black Lives Matter!<eos> I'm gonna call the ambulance for you right now, okay?<eos> I...<eos> I'm just tryin' to help!<eos> Derek!<eos> Alexandra!
About to call you an ambulance.<eos> This is not Black Lives Matter!<eos> I'm gonna call the ambulance for you right now, okay?<eos> I...<eos> I'm just tryin' to help!<eos> Derek!<eos> Alexandra!<eos> I'm not leaving without him.<eos> You gonna end up in jail.<eos> No, not without Derek! Derek!
Well, if you were there, you would have known.<eos> We got stuck, and my phone was broken.<eos> I saw y'all at the protest, by the way, singing with Mamacita.<eos> She covered your ass.<eos> I didn't need my ass covered, I needed to be...<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm trying to get through to Derek, all right?<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> He needs an attorney or something, right?<eos> Nah, just bail.
Let me tell you something, you go talk to Maggie, and I will tell anyone who listens what you did to make your son a football star.<eos> What do you what?<eos> The whole deal is off.<eos> You're out.<eos> I'm taking those girls to the top, my way.<eos> I got it.<eos> _<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Where you coming from tonight?<eos> Home.
I just got the report about the officer.<eos> This isn't good.<eos> If you're lucky, they'll offer you a plea deal with a minimum of five years.<eos> But he's innocent, Moses.<eos> BLM would never do anything like this.<eos> Are they even trying to find the goons that crashed the rally?<eos> Look, unless somebody comes forward with new evidence, you're their number one suspect.<eos> Could you give us a moment, sir?<eos> Sure.<eos> No contact!
Maybe I'm not.<eos> - ♪ Hey ♪ - Cross, up, down.<eos> - Ugh! - Come back around.<eos> Cross, up, down.<eos> I don't know ♪ Open it, open it, open it, open it.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Star, you ever been locked up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Couple times.<eos> Petty stuff.
I'm sorry.<eos> You gonna be all right, Miss Ruby.<eos> We gonna get him out, right?<eos> We gonna get him out!<eos> Hey, Miss Ruby? I got some of that Blue Dream back at the house when you get home.<eos> All right, y'all ready to turn up?<eos> Put your hands together for Star, Simone, and Alex.<eos> Okay, y'all better work.<eos> All right, y'all, give it up one more time... for Star, Simone and Alex.<eos> And the Ponytail Sisters!
My guest is not only a living legend but quite possibly the coolest person on this planet.<eos> Everybody, put your hands together for Pumpkin.<eos> Oh, my God, this better not be happening!<eos> I must be hallucinating.<eos> What up?<eos> Y'all looking real good, I see y'all.<eos> So, look,<eos> I came out here from Cali just to talk to y'all.<eos> Now, tonight is about raising money for a community hero,<eos> Derek Jones.
She ain't calling me back.<eos> Jahil really got to her this time.<eos> Yeah, but Jahil was wrong for what he did.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Miss Carlotta?<eos> Alex is gonna take me to school today.<eos> I got enough going on around here as it is.<eos> Simone, what are you doing?<eos> - Where we going?<eos> - Hunter's.
I don't know, I guess because of the Spanish.<eos> I never had no one who could sing it before.<eos> - Huh. - Until now.<eos> So, now you trying to connect with your Latin roots?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I didn't think you were about that.<eos> I don't know, I guess I always thought that having a white girl up front and center was gonna be the thing that rakes in the cash.<eos> But, you know, you get to a point where it's like, maybe you're finally even proud of who you are.<eos> - I mean me.<eos> As a Latino.
Nah, you always got my back with the girls, so I got you.<eos> Look, I didn't know you worked this shift, at the club.<eos> I don't.<eos> I came trying to pick up some more hours.<eos> What did Maggie say?<eos> No.<eos> Well, between working here, and at your mom's and that little side hustle you got, I figure you'd be stacking paper.<eos> I quit.<eos> Quit Carlotta's?<eos> And that side hustle.
Get out of here.<eos> You back on them drugs.<eos> All right, get your stuff.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Look, I already told you, I'm not coming back.<eos> Stop trying to find excuses to keep coming over here.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You so fine now you go to work high?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Jahil?
Okay, but I think we were gonna celebrate, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get you back on time.<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> - You say that every time.<eos> Are you good?<eos> Can you get a ride home with Alex or Jahil?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yeah, I got you.<eos> All right, later.
Come on.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - I ain't afraid of no cop.<eos> What's going on with you, Cotton, huh?<eos> How you gonna show up at the club so high like that, huh?<eos> I mean, do you even care about what's going on with those girls anymore, huh?<eos> How'd they do?<eos> Well, they were moved on, of course.<eos> - I'm their manager.<eos> - Hot damn.
You were gonna take her when I got locked up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Exactly.<eos> See, that's what got me knocked up in the first place.<eos> That smooth talk.<eos> That Peruvian smirk.<eos> That dirt weed.<eos> Well, fair enough.<eos> You're here for Alexandra Crane?<eos> - Yes. Yes, and Derek Jones.
You're pregnant.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's in a medically induced coma to decrease the swelling in his brain.<eos> Please, I need to see him.<eos> - Please.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> You'll have to come back tomorrow during visiting hours.<eos> Are you family?<eos> I'm carrying his baby.<eos> Baby? !
Stop making everything about you!<eos> I'm not, damn it!<eos> I lost my son.<eos> But I found my daughter.<eos> Cot, I'm-a help you find your jewelry.<eos> I'll finish her braids later. Cot.<eos> Okay. Thanks for the update, Miss Ruby.<eos> Yeah, I'll be back in about an hour or so.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.
That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Man, Hunter, what are you gonna do when Star is gone on tour?<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's your response?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't...<eos> I'm not used to any of this.<eos> What, what, a relationship?
Come with me, baby.<eos> It's the best I can do.<eos> You could come with me.<eos> You could protect me from all the creepy drunk dudes.<eos> Why are you making a joke of this?<eos> I'm not.<eos> What is it that you're trying to do?<eos> I just told you that I loved you.<eos> What do you want me to say, Hunter?<eos> That I...
You Ruth-Anne Leecan?<eos> How is Simone?<eos> How you sleep at night?<eos> I didn't.<eos> - But I couldn't...<eos> - What?<eos> You couldn't-couldn't what?<eos> Pick up a phone?<eos> Couldn't find a conscience?<eos> What?
Oh, baby.<eos> I'm so glad you came back.<eos> I really need to...<eos> Really?<eos> Come on, put that down.<eos> Put it down, Star.<eos> Take one more step toward me, and I will decorate these walls with the inside of your skull, Hunter.<eos> Try me.<eos> You do understand that this is a life-changing decision?<eos> And not just for you, but... for me and the baby's life as well.
We won.<eos> Ladies, where's your manager?<eos> The Atlanta NextFest and Honda people are waiting outside.<eos> Just give us a minute.<eos> Yo, we ain't got a manager.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Who cares?<eos> After that, fools are gonna be knocking on our door trying to manage us.<eos> Yeah, but I don't want anybody phony, I want someone that's...<eos> Real?
- You guys rocked it tonight.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> This hug is a lot.<eos> Yeah, I don't, you know, hug that long...<eos> You know the first thing I'm gonna do, right?<eos> I'm gonna change y'all name from Big Trouble.<eos> - Please do.<eos> - That was a Jahil thing.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Jahil.
She was with the CDC, investigating how the flu virus came to Seattle.<eos> Just a coincidence you had her number?<eos> Maybe I should be calling my lawyer.<eos> Are you charging me with something?<eos> Or am I charging you with something?<eos> This is so confusing.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Um, your clothes won't be ready for another 30 minutes.<eos> You wanna watch some TV?<eos> _
Clive?<eos> What is it?<eos> _<eos> The coldest place in the state?<eos> Sunnyside!<eos> Irony, anyone?<eos> They'll reach a high of six degrees today.<eos> The jetstream that we're seeing here is staying...<eos> So, the new weather girl... What do you think?<eos> - Scrumptious.
Let's show the world there's no need to fear the other.<eos> Aim...<eos> Take 'em down.<eos> While Seattle will be under zombie control, most of you living here will experience very little change.<eos> The established infrastructure will continue to function, its city government, its schools, firehouses, police department, with a special zombie police force and criminal justice system to handle crimes involving zombies.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> Continue watching for a list of locations where brains can be procured.<eos> So that's your plan?<eos> Holding the country hostage for its brains?<eos> The brains of their dead.
No-one knows.<eos> Everyone who worked on the translation, and everyone who subsequently read it is now dead.<eos> Dead, Doctor, by their own hand.<eos> The Veritas is a short document.<eos> A few pages only.<eos> And, yet, it contains a secret that drives all who know it to destroy themselves.<eos> - Confirmed suicides?<eos> All of them?<eos> - In every case.<eos> Beyond doubt.
You old dog.<eos> Very few know this place exists.<eos> The library of blasphemy, the Haereticum.<eos> - Harry Potter!<eos> - Language!<eos> Please, stay close to me.<eos> The layout is designed to confuse the uninitiated.<eos> Sort of like religion, really.<eos> You happy in those shades?<eos> - Not dark enough for you?
Take a few more minutes if you like.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> Actually do.<eos> Do that. Knock yourself RIGHT out.<eos> I'll be good. I promise,<eos> I'll turn... I'll turn good.<eos> Please.<eos> Teach me, teach me how to be... ..good.<eos> Without hope.<eos> Without witness.

Good-oh!<eos> Nardole, are you secretly a badass?<eos> Nothing secret about it, babydoll.<eos> Well, that answers that question.<eos> It's an opening, like we saw before.<eos> Yeah, like a portal.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - About what?<eos> It would be stupid to go and look.<eos> Cardinal Angelo?
I could do with your help here.<eos> I'm not absolutely sure how this is going to work...<eos> Either it's going to temporarily fix my eyesight, or it's going to burn out my brain.<eos> Just... give me a mo.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> - Makes no difference.<eos> - I know it doesn't.<eos> I know I'm going to die.<eos> I have to say it... the truth.<eos> Without hope.

But I programmed the TARDIS myself, we were on target.<eos> We went to the Vatican, the real one, I'm sure of it.<eos> "Oh"? Those machines, they project the simulations.<eos> And I'm just wondering... ..what happens if we move outside the light of the projector?<eos> Don't let me be right.<eos> Please, don't let me be right.<eos> I'm part of it!<eos> I'm part of the simulation!<eos> Bill, I'm not real!<eos> Nardole!
No, I'm not. I'm a shadow.<eos> A puppet Doctor for you to practise killing.<eos> We have killed you many times.<eos> Then what are you waiting for?<eos> Why don't you kill me now? You suffer.<eos> Pain is information.<eos> Information will be gathered.<eos> Turn me off, turn me off!<eos> I have nothing.<eos> Not even hope.

It's from the Chief!<eos> Is it? Oh, yes.<eos> That's right.<eos> Authorising us to go anywhere we please.<eos> So... Valkyrie?<eos> Valkyrie... is... probing the Martian ice caps with a new kind of camera on board.<eos> Uses a different spectrum to see under the poles and beam back pictures.<eos> What the hell...?<eos> Mars. 1881.<eos> Or thereabouts.
!<eos> - I'm sure it's only a temporary thing but it means that for the time being, we're stuck here on Mars.<eos> Oh, well, yes, I was stationed out there.<eos> South Africa.<eos> One day, I came across something in the veldt.<eos> Something that was clearly not of this earth.<eos> An interplanetary vessel!<eos> I found Friday here on board.<eos> In a sort of coma.<eos> Half dead.
That was the general idea, old love.<eos> But there's nothing here.<eos> Whole show's been a ruddy wash out.<eos> The ship crashed on landing.<eos> I go top side now and then to see if I can repair the beggar.<eos> That's what I was doing when I ran across you.<eos> - And?<eos> - No joy so far.<eos> It could have been a fresh start.<eos> For all of us.
♪ Ain't it all a bleedin' shame!<eos> Someone's coming, Jackdaw!<eos> We'll ruddy swing for this!<eos> Jackdaw!<eos> Come on, mate.<eos> Don't muck about...<eos> Jackdaw?<eos> What manner of fleshy worm are you?<eos> Speak.<eos> What the hell...?
What the hell's going on here, Friday?<eos> Colonel, let me speak to them.<eos> I can do this.<eos> I can sort this out.<eos> Who the devil is this?<eos> She is Iraxxa,<eos> Empress of Mars.<eos> The deuce she is!<eos> And you think you can just go about slaughtering my men willy-nilly, do you, madam?<eos> "Your men"?
Wait, Catchlove! Wait! - WEAPON POWERS UP<eos> Honour must be satisfied. An eye for an eye!<eos> I am in command here!<eos> All right.<eos> By the moons, I honour thee.<eos> I'm the Doctor... and I beg leave to intercede.<eos> - You know my race?<eos> - I do.<eos> And I ask mercy for these primitives.<eos> "Primitives"? !
It's so green there, Sarge.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I miss the trees and the grass!<eos> I never want to see red again in all my puff. I just want to see...<eos> How, in God's name, did they get behind us?<eos> Turn it!<eos> Turn it, for God's sake, 90 degrees!<eos> It won't work, sir, we need more men!<eos> Catchlove, this is senseless slaughter!<eos> Present!
God save the Queen.<eos> God save the Queen!<eos> You will die with honour, with bravery, and in the service of those you have sworn to protect...<eos> You don't know what that means.<eos> Thank you... but not today.<eos> In battle, soldier.<eos> To die in battle is the way of the warrior.<eos> Pledge your allegiance to me and my world, and I will ensure you have the opportunity.<eos> My life and my service are yours.<eos> To the end.
Go tell a pig about your moral high ground.<eos> I pick a scenario, we drop her down into it, and we see how she does.<eos> How does that work?<eos> We just take the TARDIS for a spin and we graze for distress calls.<eos> We pick a good one.<eos> Our usual Saturday.<eos> And what if she just walks out and slaughters everyone just for a laugh?<eos> Well, I will be monitoring you the whole time.<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, you and Nardole.
Much worse!<eos> 50 of you... taking your brand-new ship, fresh from the factory, to pick up some colonists?<eos> Yes.<eos> Two days ago, you almost bump into a black hole.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> We tried to reverse out of it.<eos> And you sent a team down to the other end of the ship to reverse the rear thrusters, yes?<eos> - Yes<eos> - How many people in the team?<eos> About 20.
Alit, get under your bed... and stay there!<eos> It's the scarecrows.<eos> New ones.<eos> It's Okay.<eos> We'll be Okay.<eos> Save your ammo!<eos> Wait for it!<eos> Fire! -= resync to WEB-DL by Yn1D =-<eos> How many times have you died?<eos> How many different ways?
This doesn't make any sense!<eos> Doesn't it?<eos> These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.<eos> You two, you should know by now. When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.<eos> What have we missed?<eos> You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.<eos> I was waiting for my chance.<eos> Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...<eos> I only had time to change one detail.<eos> A single number.
Come on, this way!<eos> Why are there so many children in that house?<eos> Small community, several hundred at most.<eos> So, they keep the children together for their protection.<eos> Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes, fine.<eos> What was that?<eos> They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...<eos> Less to what?
And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.<eos> - They are all coming here.<eos> - And it doesn't work!<eos> Because?<eos> If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.<eos> They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.<eos> You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.<eos> I landed here, I had trouble taking off.<eos> The black hole?<eos> Too close to the event horizon.
And above all, it's kind.<eos> It's just that.<eos> Just kind.<eos> If I run away today, good people will die.<eos> If I stand and fight, some of them might live.<eos> Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.<eos> Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all.<eos> But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.<eos> And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.<eos> Some day.
I'll take the back, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is it, I'm afraid.<eos> So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...<eos> I can't think of anything, can you?<eos> No.<eos> But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Glad you knew that!<eos> Without hope.

Yes, my dear, you will.<eos> Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.<eos> You see, Missy.<eos> THIS is where we've always been going.<eos> This is our perfect ending.<eos> We shoot ourselves in the back.<eos> Okay, to the lifts... floor 502.<eos> Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.<eos> They'll take years to get back here.<eos> Telos!

Hello.<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> Doctors... are... not... required.<eos> I'm not a doctor.<eos> I am the Doctor.<eos> The original, you might say.<eos> Doctor, Doctor, let it go.<eos> Time enough.<eos> Pity.<eos> No stars.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.<eos> I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.<eos> It's up to you, Bill.<eos> But before you make up your mind... let me show you around.<eos> Back in time for tea?<eos> If you want.<eos> You know what, old man?<eos> I'm never going to believe you're really dead.<eos> Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.<eos> Until then.
- Can you get word to Liv? - Totes magotes.<eos> Bye now!<eos> Cheers, then.<eos> Agenda's clear for a few days.<eos> Nice work, doctor shockterbooty.<eos> We're gonna need that phone.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> - I'm here of my own volition.<eos> - Volition?<eos> His own free will.
No!<eos> Roxanne caught him as he was stealing the camera memory card.<eos> She was calling for help and he panicked and strangled her.<eos> You know, most prosecutors would be happy that the person they put away was actually guilty.<eos> Yeah, but my desire to be right is even greater than my desire to win.<eos> - Did you see his dead wife? - Yeah.<eos> Unpleasant lady.<eos> So, mistress p, how much time do I have left in my hour?<eos> You like it, do you?<eos> Me likey.
Unpleasant lady.<eos> So, mistress p, how much time do I have left in my hour?<eos> You like it, do you?<eos> Me likey.<eos> My god, what?<eos> You think, Peyton will let you borrow that getup?<eos> You're dead.<eos> Who's dead?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Drake.
Me likey.<eos> My god, what?<eos> You think, Peyton will let you borrow that getup?<eos> You're dead.<eos> Who's dead?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Drake.<eos> Drake?<eos> Old boyfriend, Drake?<eos> No, Drake the multiplatinum hip hop star.
Did she have a round shell, hankering for pizza?<eos> - Ninja, please.<eos> - Mr. Jin.<eos> Let's try to keep your testimony credible.<eos> Please tell them what they need to know.<eos> - The testimony?<eos> - Right.<eos> I got this telescoping mirror so I can talk to the guys in the cells next to me.<eos> The night he died, I heard a noise coming from weckler's cell, and in that mirror, I saw this fatass guard...<eos> Gary oberman.
This case just keeps getting weirder.<eos> First weckler kills Roxanne, then Gary kills weckler.<eos> Then Gary comes into a large sum of money, goes on a cruise and disappears into thin air.<eos> Seems like someone is trying to clean up a mess, and making an even bigger one.<eos> Nearly 65,000 viewers!<eos> This is about to get fun.<eos> I'm already having a blast.<eos> You wanna know where zombies come from?<eos> I do.<eos> The shah of Iran.
All cash?<eos> Is there anybody else offering you that?<eos> You can offer me a goddamn polar bear if you never plan on giving it to me.<eos> Okay, okay, I'm gonna throw in an extra grand just for waiting.<eos> I'm flying to Hawaii a week from today.<eos> Sid wanted his ashes dumped in a volcano for some goddamned reason.<eos> I need the money before I go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Monday.<eos> No bullshit.
If it's not an imposition.<eos> Make Craig happy.<eos> And I have a lot of room.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you're not staying with me, by the way.<eos> You're filthy, and I don't want the d.A. Banging down my door.<eos> Did I ask to stay with you?<eos> You were about to.<eos> You cool? Yeah, man.<eos> All right, you ready, boys?
You don't know shit and you never will. Do you get that?<eos> No one is ever gonna have a kid with you, ever.<eos> Come on, Lena, let's go.<eos> Baz, throw it to me!<eos> Get out of the way, deran! Here, you try.<eos> Aah!<eos> Pass it, pass it!<eos> Over here!<eos> Where did it go?<eos> Up for the 3!
What's up?<eos> I can't leave you boys alone for one minute!<eos> You were supposed to get him out by 10:00, Hubert!<eos> You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!<eos> We never get to do anything!<eos> Boys, if we want to keep our home afloat, we've all got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Destination:<eos> McDuck Manor.<eos> McDuck Manor?<eos> As in Scrooge McDuck?

- But we're...<eos> - Out! Well, what are you gaping at?<eos> The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?<eos> Pixiu, the Gold-Hunting Dragon...<eos> Gold hunting?<eos> Sounds great!<eos> Not when you're Duckburg's single largest owner of gold!<eos> Aah!<eos> Me money bin!<eos> To your rooms!
To be clear, I'm gonna go catch the dragon.<eos> The hamburger was a metaphor from before.<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, we get it. We get it.<eos> But how are we gonna get up there?<eos> I'm a pilot.<eos> Yeah! Ha ha! It'll take more than some fancy flying to shake old Scrooge, you cash cannibal!<eos> It'll take more than a bruised spine to shake old Scrooge, you bad dragon-dog!<eos> Take that!<eos> Nooooooooooo!<eos> Whoo-hoo!

Dah!<eos> Lad! I thought the traps would get you for sure!<eos> Stupid upside-down temple!<eos> Nothing cool about walking under buzzsaws!<eos> From now on, don't touch anything!<eos> Maybe Atlantis was an ambitious first outing.<eos> Hi again, Granny!<eos> Still at a friend's house.<eos> Uh, her name?<eos> Sub... ina!
You want me to adventure behind Scrooge McDuck, or wait by the sub!<eos> I might as well be back on the houseboat!<eos> Because you have no idea what you're doing!<eos> So show me!<eos> Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!<eos> I'm not lumping you all together.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Which triplet am I?<eos> It's...<eos> Bluey?
Oh, look!<eos> Uncle Hampus is here, and he only speaks Swedish.<eos> We don't want to be rude, so... good-bye?<eos> And you're done.<eos> Yeah, you're never gonna be able to back up that lie.<eos> That was crazy!<eos> Whoa! Oh, hej, Beakley!<eos> Subina...<eos> Take 'em down!<eos> Ojda.
An efficient, clean source of energy that could power Duckburg for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric.<eos> Ooh, Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims by other Scottish billionaires that they have the real jewel?<eos> That bauble?<eos> That's nice, but it's obviously super cursed.<eos> No, it's not!<eos> Curse you, McDuck!<eos> - Webby.<eos> Uncle Hampus.<eos> - How long?<eos> Whole time.
So she's only shown herself to me that I know of.<eos> Maybe I'm tuned into her ghost channel or something, or... maybe it has something to do with this.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?<eos> I know my daughter.<eos> She's trying to protect us.<eos> Seeing her like that would be... very upsetting for her mother and me, but she led you to this for a reason.<eos> Uh, Alice called a couple of months ago about some ghost children trapped in an estate in England.<eos> - The Plover estate.
Do you understand there isn't a single accurate map of this entire place now?<eos> What the...<eos> Shit is radioactive.<eos> Your majesties, welcome to Loria.<eos> You kidnapped our castle?<eos> I'll put it back, as soon as you come around to my offer.<eos> So many hostages.<eos> I wouldn't try anything if I were you.<eos> Guards?<eos> Dungeon.
I've always had a terrible fear of heights.<eos> One day, Alanis Morissette got stuck on the roof.<eos> Alice begged me to get her down, but I couldn't, and honestly, I... I yelled at her, because sometimes that is what one does when one is ashamed.<eos> And the cat... did not end well.<eos> I don't know if Alice ever forgave me for not being brave enough.<eos> Maybe she will now.<eos> No, Daniel, you don't have to do that.<eos> Look, I can do it.<eos> No, I can do it.<eos> For Alice.
I can't banish Reynard again... but you can.<eos> Where's your cat?<eos> Oh, he's around here somewhere.<eos> Come on.<eos> Follow me.<eos> You just wait right here, honey.<eos> So sorry about this.<eos> Late, Ms. Hansen.<eos> Sit, you have ten minutes to complete your midterm.<eos> Midterm?
Yes, I am on my way.<eos> Mr. Brunelle, maybe you can come back another time?<eos> This guy was at the door.<eos> Says he absolutely needs to talk to you.<eos> Mr. Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I'm Jack Brunelle.<eos> Mr. Brunelle, yes.<eos> You wrote to me several times.<eos> Your son Connor was attacked, ended up in a coma, and when he finally regained consciousness, he was addicted to painkillers, right?<eos> And then heroin.
He's free.<eos> My son was assaulted in January of 2012, which means I have less than a year to find his attacker before the statute of limitations expires.<eos> Mr. Brunelle, I understand your dilemma.<eos> You feel a great pressure to right a criminal wrong, but Watson and I are struggling to solve two murders at the moment.<eos> There might come a time when we can offer some help, but I'm afraid it isn't today.<eos> All right, everybody, get your hands up!<eos> Get 'em up!<eos> I said get 'em up! Get 'em up!<eos> Get your hands up! Up!<eos> Up!
Then these young guns show up, start muscling in on our turf.<eos> Santo MatÃ³n.<eos> Yeah. Killer Saint.<eos> Emphasis on the â€œKiller.â€ Those guys are nuts, man.<eos> It's all â€œShoot first, ask questions neverâ€ with them.<eos> You know, pretty soon, we spending more time dodging bullets than we are selling coke.<eos> Felt like living in a war zone.<eos> So when our leader, Terrell, said he had a way to get out, we was, like, â€œYeah.â€<eos> The syrup heist was his idea?<eos> No, a friend of his.
So far, yes.<eos> Mr. Brunelle, it's over.<eos> We've solved your case.<eos> Your son was assaulted by a man named Frank Trimble.<eos> It doesn't matter anymore!<eos> It's past midnight.<eos> You failed.<eos> - You need to give us more time.<eos> - No. I gave you plenty of time.<eos> Years.
You got two arms, bitch.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've been on this diet for three days.<eos> I'm a little hangry.<eos> Great. So you'll help me?<eos> You got two ears, bitch, I said no.<eos> Yolanda, we have a situation.<eos> Alan's leaving you for someone thinner?<eos> - No.<eos> - Smarter?
I'm sorry.<eos> I've been on this diet for three days.<eos> I'm a little hangry.<eos> Great. So you'll help me?<eos> You got two ears, bitch, I said no.<eos> Yolanda, we have a situation.<eos> Alan's leaving you for someone thinner?<eos> - No.<eos> - Smarter?<eos> Taller?
It's not funny, Elliot.<eos> I just turned 51, which is the age my mom passed and her mom passed.<eos> I just wanna live long enough to dance on your grave.<eos> Yolanda, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Back then, people didn't know how to take care of themselves.<eos> You know, they ate too much, they drank too much, they didn't work out.<eos> Oh my damn!<eos> I gotta get to the gym.<eos> - Elliot, can you spot me?<eos> - From space.
- You are so right.<eos> - Mm. Meeting my dad was, oh, amazing!<eos> - Wh-what's that?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, why wouldn't I be okay?<eos> Had a great afternoon with my dad.<eos> We went for a jog.<eos> Out for lunch.<eos> The aquarium?
- You?<eos> - Yes!<eos> C'mon, cheer up, sunshine!<eos> Valentine's Day can never be that bad, because we'll always have each other.<eos> And stop smiling, okay?<eos> You're just happy because you have a man in your life.<eos> I do not have a man in my life, I have a Josh, and we have a strictly punch-card relationship.<eos> Hmm... so you guys aren't going to do anything romantic tonight?<eos> That's right! People get crazy on Valentine's Day, and because we're not a couple, we're not going to celebrate it.<eos> No gifts, no romance, no mush.
Just ask my high school tennis coach.<eos> Hey, did Gabi leave for the grocery store yet?<eos> Fine, I'll tell you.<eos> Gabi has a Valentine's Day gift for you.<eos> What?<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> She's in the laundry room right now hiding it.<eos> See, that's why my tennis coach got fired.<eos> Wait, we had an agreement.<eos> No gifts, no romance, no mush.
I don't ever want to take it off.<eos> But that's when the fun starts.<eos> Don't be dirty.<eos> - Oh my God! - Pretty!<eos> Did I just hear the stripper?<eos> What are you guys doing down here?<eos> Looking for you, sweetheart!<eos> This is the guy you ran away from?<eos> Newsflash, gay.<eos> No, not him.

Help me defeat the Black Fairy.<eos> After we kill this thing, then what?<eos> Then we turn our sights to my mother.<eos> I thought she was trapped in another realm.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> You're the Savior.<eos> Your magic is the only thing strong enough to not only slice into her realm, but to allow me to at last defeat her.<eos> So, you tried to kill me because you didn't believe that I would help you get to another realm to get back to her?<eos> Seemed like a... good plan at the time.<eos> In retrospect, perhaps not.
No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Stop!<eos> As far as I can see, this one's just begun to suffer.<eos> No!<eos> How dare you use that on me!<eos> I gave you this magic!<eos> You wouldn't hurt me.<eos> Haven't you learned?<eos> There are so many ways to hurt a person.<eos> Or a bug.
I gave you this magic!<eos> You wouldn't hurt me.<eos> Haven't you learned?<eos> There are so many ways to hurt a person.<eos> Or a bug.<eos> No.<eos> Please... please... please don't... no!<eos> You could've saved him eons ago, but you didn't.<eos> This is on you, Gideon.<eos> And my boot.
Okay.<eos> But the apartment's as much yours as it is Abby's.<eos> She can't keep you locked out forever.<eos> I'm not locked out.<eos> I... I agreed to give her space.<eos> Four weeks is a lot of space.<eos> All part of the process.<eos> But, yeah, it feels like an eternity.<eos> But we have another therapy session this morning, so I'm gonna propose...<eos> Hey, roomie.
I'm totally cool with that.<eos> Well, we don't have too many late nights or sudden emergencies in budgets and planning.<eos> So, uh, stop by when you're done for the day.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> Get a room.<eos> Things are going well with Kevin.<eos> So far, so good.<eos> Just wish I could relax and enjoy it.<eos> Overthinking?<eos> You?
But have you submitted to God's righteousness?<eos> When the Great Tribulation comes, only the worthy will be saved to sit at the feet of the Father.<eos> John 1:8.<eos> "If we say that we are without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."<eos> I don't presume to tell Him that I'm worthy.<eos> I await His judgment.<eos> And for the chance to serve Him and bring about His will, I await yours.<eos> Nice work, professor.<eos> He's really got this down.<eos> No worldly possessions.
Hey, I was just about to call you.<eos> She fell asleep a few minutes ago.<eos> Oh, sorry... about the buzzer.<eos> You cut your hair.<eos> Yeah, I got it done at lunch, kind of an impulse.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Okay. Sure.<eos> How's work?<eos> Uh, i-it's an adjustment being back full-time, but, um, so far so good.<eos> You?
Believe me, that was not what I had imagined for myself as a young girl.<eos> And at times it felt... like the dream had died.<eos> Took me a while to realize it was just simply replaced by something stronger and better.<eos> Now, Henry and I didn't have the fate of our country on our hands, just the future of our family, and even that, at times, felt overwhelming.<eos> I can't imagine the kind of pressure that you feel.<eos> But now's the time to put aside your personal anguish, and focus on what brought you together in the first place, your incredible, bold vision for ending your country's half-century of suffering.<eos> I'm asking you to reach inside and find the strength, and take the lead again.<eos> I'm asking you to trust that, behind the dream, is something more important.<eos> We've talked it over, and no matter what happens between us, we want this truce to succeed.<eos> Sí, for the good of Colombia.
I just got read in a few minutes ago.<eos> Kevin Park.<eos> His real name was Joseph Garcia.<eos> What?<eos> That's insane.<eos> How do you get a job at the State Department under a false identity?<eos> No, he-he didn't work for the State Department.<eos> He was a CIA operative.<eos> He was using his position in our offices as cover for a highly classified investigation.<eos> What... what kind of classified investigation?
- No, he's my husband!<eos> - Stay here.<eos> Ma'am. Ma'am, I...<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The crane was lifting an I-beam, and boom, the jib arm smacked into the building, takes out six floors just like that.<eos> Poor bastard, sitting in the car.<eos> That was all she wrote.<eos> - Anyone else?<eos> - We're still looking.<eos> - Ma'am, for your own safety...
How bad?<eos> There's four injured, and this guy, Evan Wheeler.<eos> She's lucky she got out of the car.<eos> She's lucky she never got in it.<eos> She was at home on the phone with him when she...<eos> Ah, damn.<eos> Evan!<eos> Oh, my God, Evan!<eos> She's Frank Linden's daughter.<eos> - The Frank Linden?
- That's what he said.<eos> And I don't like what you're implying.<eos> What about drugs? See?<eos> They're going to pin this on you.<eos> I never even smoked weed in high school.<eos> Sure as hell not gonna start now.<eos> Look, my husband needs his rest.<eos> You wanna know anything else, you can talk to his union rep.<eos> Why did you get transferred to Riverfront?<eos> Good-bye.
You can pat me on the head if you like.<eos> PC felony.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I confess, you got me.<eos> Here, take me away.<eos> I apologize.<eos> You're not a girl.<eos> You're a lady.<eos> I'm an assistant state's attorney, Mr. Linden.<eos> Well, very good for you.
It's a... it's a...<eos> It's a showcase trial for Mr. Stone, a small man who will do whatever he can to bring down a...<eos> Please finish that thought, Mr. Linden.<eos> Well, I'm not one to boast.<eos> Well, let me.<eos> You were gonna say a great man.<eos> Well, look, I employ thousands of people.<eos> I have hundreds of commercial tenants, corporate offices of some of the best companies in the world.<eos> I have thousands of residential tenants, good people, by the way.<eos> Good upstanding people.
You tell me, baby.<eos> Did I mess up the money orders?<eos> No.<eos> Someone robbed my storage unit.<eos> You didn't happen to tell anybody we went there, did you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I don't even know which unit's yours.<eos> Did the others get robbed?<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> What, uh, what about security cameras?
Let's meet at the bar in two hours and we'll celebrate.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What do you think of the house?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I got it for us.<eos> - You bought that house?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - For us?
- Wait, hold on.<eos> lovely lady lined up.<eos> - To Nicky's first job.<eos> - To Nicky's first job.<eos> I'm 1 or 2?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Help me.<eos> No, I...<eos> Don't get my goalkeeper!<eos> - That one!
May we all get what we want...<eos> And never what we deserve.<eos> When we get there, I'm gonna need you to watch my back.<eos> At a funeral?<eos> And keep your mouth shut.<eos> We're going to pay our respects and leave.<eos> So this, this Manny guy, when was the last time you saw him?<eos> 20 years ago maybe.<eos> Yeah. Hey, man, where are you?<eos> My place.
I'm keeping this, by the way.<eos> It was always mine.<eos> So Smurf retired?<eos> She'd lost a step, and it was time.<eos> So who's running things now?<eos> You mean you're running things.<eos> So what's up?<eos> Is there any opportunities?<eos> You and me?<eos> Like the old days?
What?<eos> I've got this bracelet.<eos> 20 grand.<eos> Go to your fence, take 20%. - 30.<eos> - Marco, it's not the cut.<eos> Eso todo.<eos> Good? Let's see.<eos> Looks good. How much?<eos> - Mil cien.<eos> - $1,100.
Names he remembered.<eos> A few of these guys say that's all he did at the end.<eos> Just sit, saying shit into one of the mini tape recorders.<eos> You sure you can't come over? I've got the whole place to myself.<eos> I'm going to a movie with my parents and little sister.<eos> Some animated thing.<eos> Family date night.<eos> - Ouch.<eos> - Trust me, I know.<eos> Later.
You know what moral turpitude is?<eos> I'm guessing it's not a good thing.<eos> I have to assess the likelihood of you committing acts of it.<eos> When we send inspectors, we don't tell you.<eos> Everything by the book.<eos> Don't give me a reason to turn you down.<eos> I won't.<eos> And thank you for not giving me some story about being wrongly accused or trying to bribe me.<eos> You wouldn't believe how many people we turn down for that.<eos> No shit.

Yeah, we're not doing any of that.<eos> You're just gonna have to trust me on this one.<eos> Gideon out.<eos> _<eos> - Been a while.<eos> - Danny... I go by DV8 now.<eos> - I need some help.<eos> - What are you gonna do for me?<eos> I'll owe you a favor.<eos> - A favor.
Gideon out.<eos> _<eos> - Been a while.<eos> - Danny... I go by DV8 now.<eos> - I need some help.<eos> - What are you gonna do for me?<eos> I'll owe you a favor.<eos> - A favor.<eos> - I need you to shut someone down.<eos> Bad guys.
Busy day ahead?<eos> Is there any other kind?<eos> Be nice if you had some help.<eos> The handsome, successful, good-with-kids kind.<eos> Really, Mom?<eos> I'm not asking my boss out, period.<eos> What was your question?<eos> What are the birds and the bees?<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> Brian O'Hara.
But as long as I am, how-how can I help you?<eos> Well, I have this informant on a case I've been working on.<eos> Kid's name is Jesse.<eos> Really been risking his neck to help me out, then yesterday he went missing.<eos> Okay, what's the case?<eos> Louis Benoit.<eos> Refreshingly cosmopolitan name for a criminal.<eos> Is he a chef or impressionist painter or...<eos> Actually, one of the biggest drug dealers in Chicago.<eos> Pills mostly.
I watch the news, and I'm aware of what's going on with your company.<eos> I have to ask, is District 13 gonna lose you?<eos> Billionaires don't talk, either.<eos> But you might want to take cover.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello, Lauren.<eos> Or should I call you Judas?<eos> You got some nerve coming here.<eos> You just stole a $50 million submersible from my company.<eos> Your company?
- You good to take them out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Dukes of Hazzard, man.<eos> - Gideon, is that you?<eos> - Yep. Kind of.<eos> Get him in the car.<eos> - There's no driver.<eos> - Yes, there is.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> In, in, in.
That is exactly what Reeves Industries' partnership with the FBI is gonna be.<eos> I know everyone's excited about what the FBI licensing our tech means for our stock price.<eos> I can't say that I'm not pleased.<eos> It's killed any talk of a takeover of my company.<eos> But this is also good for something else... justice.<eos> Watch out, bad guys, because the feds have some new toys.<eos> They're actually hand-me-down toys from the, from the 13th, but it's, that-that's the whole point of this experiment, all right?<eos> Listen, guys, I've got to go help my cops catch some crooks.<eos> I will talk to you later.<eos> No, no, no more questions.
The board voted.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> So, why do you look like someone poured battery acid in your cereal?<eos> Because I have to tell you something and I think you're not gonna like it.<eos> Okay, what-what is it?<eos> I have to quit this job now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I can't explain it. So...<eos> Well, then I don't accept your resignation.<eos> Not a resignation.
It's true.<eos> Everyone that walked in that party was just a normal person.<eos> But what I saw at the end?<eos> They were all red-eyed monsters.<eos> If you're here, it means that we can tell from what you've posted on the message boards you're ready to do more than hunker down and try to merely survive a zombie outbreak. Right.<eos> Yeah. My brothers and me, we're all in.<eos> We can't do it on our own.<eos> We need volunteers to keep tabs on all of our suspected zombies.<eos> Starting with<eos> Tim Addis.
Okay, I need all you volunteers to track your zombies' comings and goings and report back to me.<eos> And what are you gonna do with that info?<eos> Something that can't be ignored.<eos> Like what?<eos> Capture a zombie, starve it, broadcast it on a live stream, and let the whole world see the monster it becomes.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
Then, yes, milady.<eos> You mount the horse successfully.<eos> Your compatriots proceed on foot.<eos> After a half-day's journey, you come to a tavern.<eos> Well, if there's anyone more dangerous than a gnome textile merchant inside, we flee in terror.<eos> We do not flee in terror.<eos> We enter and approach the bar.<eos> An ancient barkeep approaches.<eos> To Queen Larissa!<eos> Giver of life!
I can't believe grown adults play this for hours at a time.<eos> Grown nerds.<eos> Who's hungry?<eos> Vampire Steve's up first.<eos> Ready?<eos> The question is, "Are you?"<eos> Sixty feet away, your first suspect awaits.<eos> A nocturnal creature whose loyalties are in question.<eos> Strength, below average.<eos> Charisma, below average.
This one wants my future family kidnapped, so I know how it feels.<eos> Enough, Major.<eos> Stop torturing yourself!<eos> This one says, uh,<eos> - I didn't do it.<eos> - Really?<eos> "I know how crazy it must be to get a letter like this from a total stranger.<eos> But I was also accused of something I didn't do.<eos> If you ever need a sympathetic ear, I've got two.<eos> Shawna."
She must've done whatever she was accused of.<eos> Well, she included her phone number.<eos> - Mmm. - And this.<eos> She's cute.<eos> So I read the report you wrote on James Weckler as his prison psychiatrist.<eos> What were you treating him for exactly, Dr. Danforth?<eos> Apparitional hallucinations.<eos> Saw ghosts.<eos> Well, a ghost.<eos> Of his deceased wife.
There's something fishy about it.<eos> My old boss used to tell me, "When you win a case, get out of the courtroom."<eos> Let it go.<eos> Go have some fun, Peyton.<eos> Well, that went over like a fart in a phone booth.<eos> What?<eos> I just tried to ask my boss about the murdered dominatrix case, and he practically sprinted away. Told me to drop it.<eos> Maybe that has something to do with the fact that your boss was one of the dominatrix's clients.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> Hey, Doc.
- Take the boy. I've got Baracus.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Floyd. Let Carey take your boy.<eos> You need to calm down.<eos> Let's go, Buck. Your dad's gonna be fine.<eos> Eyes on me.<eos> Deep, steady breaths.<eos> Miss, I'm a doctor!<eos> So am I. Stay out of my way!<eos> - Shawna.
President Conrad Dalton's inauguration is only one day away, but he's still facing a legal challenge to the legitimacy of his win.<eos> Governor Sam Evans filed a lawsuit against the state of Ohio for allowing Dalton to be put on the ballot, citing a little known anti-lobbying law called the Vasey Act.<eos> Today we've learned the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to hear the case.<eos> If the court rules in Evans' favor, it could not only revoke Dalton's presidency, it could spark a constitutional crisis that would shake the very foundation our government was built upon.<eos> What's shaking the very foundation now?<eos> We begin our team coverage in...<eos> The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to hear Evans' case against Ohio.<eos> Unbelievable.
Now they want to get me debriefed.<eos> Why does all their terminology sound like something that happens in a nursing home?<eos> Baby, you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> When you get anxious you take it out on your clothes.<eos> Evans is naming me specifically in the lawsuit.<eos> He's accusing me of making overtures to influence Ohio state senators.<eos> When I did that NFL thing in Ohio, I also took some legislators out to dinner.<eos> Applebee's.
Then let's do it.<eos> Abdul-Hafiz Bakkal.<eos> - I've never heard of him.<eos> - Dabir Fakoury?<eos> Dabir Fakoury's an ISIS leader.<eos> Did he ever cross paths with Hizb Al-Shahid during your time with Black Dog Station?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> So you're tracking a connection between HS and ISIS?<eos> What about Yunis Hamawi?<eos> Also ISIS.
We're not authorized to do so,<eos> - Dr. McCord.<eos> - Excuse me, you're aware of my involvement in both operations that effectively dismantled HS, and yet you're telling me that my clearance isn't high enough to be filled in?<eos> That's what we're telling you.<eos> I think we've gotten everything we need.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> I'm heading back in the office now, Blake.<eos> Well, I'm still at the Port of Baltimore.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I am unable to bring the gift home today because they won't release it from customs until it undergoes a three-day quarantine.<eos> Quarantine?
Well... tell you what, why don't we just forget about these?<eos> Why don't you just be the stylist?<eos> And you find something you like and we'll track it down, okay?<eos> Really?<eos> This is amazing!<eos> My first assignment is the inaugural ball?<eos> Yeah, and your first client carried you in her womb, so she's probably gonna go easy on you.<eos> Ma'am, I'll get back to you as soon as we find out who leaked the information on Mandy.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Mandy?
Nothing we can really do but hang tight.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> I guess.<eos> Go back to the breath.<eos> "Serenity," stream.<eos> Nothing to be done.<eos> Let the chips fall where they may.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Chips fall...<eos> What the hell?
So I can't give them any ammunition.<eos> To knock you off your high horse.<eos> That was right there.<eos> I had to, that was...<eos> It's the only one you get.<eos> Is Stevie at Jareth's?<eos> I haven't seen her around.<eos> Yeah, she told us not to expect her.<eos> Think I could call and just check on her, make sure she got in okay?<eos> At her fiancé's place?
Congratulations, sir.<eos> - Thank you, Nadine.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Pardon me for interrupting, but there is news from Mongolia. The referendum vote came in.<eos> They voted to remain independent.<eos> That's a good thing.<eos> Now, about the horse.<eos> Mandy. Her name is Mandy.<eos> We found a suitable home for...<eos> Mandy.
Damn.<eos> Do you ever miss? Nope.<eos> You're Eric Broussard?<eos> I'm here for your incident report.<eos> Sign here.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your sworn affidavit that you and your men fired in self-defense.<eos> We'll get you through the checkpoint into Kuwait this afternoon.<eos> These are commercial tickets home.<eos> Home?
Only if the people around me remain loyal.<eos> You know I'll stand by you.<eos> Do I?<eos> Because I remember asking you to get rid of that girlfriend.<eos> Instead, she walks an IGA security team into a trap.<eos> - I'm getting rid of her.<eos> - Why is it so hard?<eos> All you have to do is snap your fingers.<eos> - She's got a son.<eos> - Not yours.
So what do we do?<eos> Take back the gauntlet... and wipe them all out.<eos> Alan, always a pleasure.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Forgive me if I cut straight to the point.<eos> I just learned about a certain file that apparently disappeared from this very house.<eos> This situation has raised certain unpleasant questions with Homeland, of course.<eos> They're ready to launch a full investigation.<eos> Unless I play ball. Hmm?<eos> Unbelievable.
He didn't want anyone to know his final destination.<eos> But it looks like Omar knew.<eos> He paid for one of Asif's flights on his credit card.<eos> So much for no terrorist ties.<eos> Where's Asif now?<eos> It looks like he's got an apartment in the Bronx.<eos> You and Sam try and track him down, get his side of the story.<eos> Got a sec?<eos> I'm checking in on Omar Abbas' case.<eos> Any particular reason?
Maybe.<eos> I really want to kiss you right now.<eos> Too bad the whole world is watching.<eos> Later, then.<eos> - Keep me posted. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> How long have you and Asif been roommates?<eos> About a year.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> Last night.
Secretary General.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> You're more beautiful than I imagined.<eos> You did it.<eos> Sure did.<eos> You should've told me about your U.N. position.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> This man is free because of you.<eos> And because you wanted a new job.<eos> An important one.
- That's a lie.<eos> - Your Honor.<eos> It's not true.<eos> It never, ever got that far.<eos> Mr. Harris, no more outbursts!<eos> Ms. Morrison, control your client.<eos> Was there any particular reason Claire was considering divorce?<eos> Gerald told her that he was having sex with men.<eos> Objection!<eos> Hearsay.
When I look at Gerald, I see a man who loved his wife, Claire.<eos> 41-year-old female, interred December 12, 2008.<eos> Everything I said in my opening statements about true love still holds.<eos> Claire and Gerald's romance may not have been traditional, but it was no less true.<eos> And being different isn't a crime.<eos> Mortician did good work... nice embalming, minimal decomposition.<eos> What are those bruises on her neck?<eos> They weren't there during the autopsy.<eos> Was Gerald's life shattered the day Claire died?<eos> No doubt.
Perhaps we can find out who helped bring her back from the dead.<eos> So, your brother murdered a woman who then came back to life, but you didn't know any of this, so you slept with her and pulled a job with her, which you now believe she sabotaged.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> And what is it you want us to do?<eos> I want you to find out who she's working with and what she's planning so that I can take her down.<eos> And when you say "take her down"...<eos> I wouldn't concern yourself too much with the details, if I were you.<eos> I know how squeamish you both are about my extra-legal...<eos> - Illegal.<eos> - Activities.
He's an extremely good-looking guy.<eos> Seven years ago, the cops were looking at him for murder, fraud, and corruption, but they could never make it stick.<eos> Well, maybe because he didn't do any of that stuff.<eos> But maybe he did, and you could be the one that finally gets him.<eos> That's so sweet of you to pretend to make this about me.<eos> We catch bad guys.<eos> Is that not what we do?<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> He wants Alice to work for him exclusively, and I just want to make sure he's on the up-and-up.<eos> For her.
I can't wait.<eos> So, if you would just excuse me, I just need to freshen up a little bit before we go.<eos> So I'll be back.<eos> When Carol realizes there's no backing out...<eos> She'll try to make a getaway.<eos> Hi, Carol.<eos> Agent Justine Diaz, FBI.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Crap.
That's an American phenomenon.<eos> I'm just stating a fact.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> We need to find out who was in that Weatherby between 9:30 and 11:00 P.M.<eos> Also, any calls that may have been placed to or from Rhys' room.<eos> Check the lobby cams, as well.<eos> I won't be able to do that remotely.<eos> I'll need access to the hotel.<eos> Well, Margot can help you with that.<eos> Good. More Margot.
I thought he was with you.<eos> He's downstairs in the car.<eos> You're going somewhere?<eos> We're running an errand.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> We got a potential lead on Felicity.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No, but we're close to figuring out how she survived and who she's working with.<eos> So what do you need from me?<eos> Access to the Weatherby's servers.

It's, um... It's a Carly Simon song.<eos> It's the one...<eos> She sings it with, James Taylor.<eos> Um... Um... "Mockingbird!"<eos> The Mockingbird Trust.<eos> Not a bad racket you've got here.<eos> Send the minions out to do the grunt work while you keep the bourbon industry alive.<eos> I rather enjoy being the Poirot to your Miss Marple.<eos> As much as you enjoy pretending to be an FBI agent?<eos> "Criminal Informant."
Look at their hands.<eos> They were gonna shoot you in the back.<eos> They made a deal with the governor.<eos> A full pardon for killing you. How do you know that?<eos> I overheard them bragging about it at a bar.<eos> How rich they were gonna get.<eos> How you'd never see it coming.<eos> I've been tracking them ever since. Uh-huh.<eos> So you tracked them all the way here, and why would you pay me such a kindness?<eos> For the famous Jesse James?
I'm the best.<eos> Which is why I need you.<eos> So this is, what, a treasure map?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Well, what's the treasure?<eos> She recognizes you.<eos> I have an abundance of admirers.<eos> The treasure?<eos> It doesn't lead to money. It leads to someone.<eos> Someone?
Well, what's the treasure?<eos> She recognizes you.<eos> I have an abundance of admirers.<eos> The treasure?<eos> It doesn't lead to money. It leads to someone.<eos> Someone?<eos> So there ain't no gold, ain't no robbery, just a person at the end of this hell?<eos> What's so special about him?<eos> They're important to a cause I'm fighting for.<eos> - Oh, yeah? What kind of cause?

That's what they say.<eos> Bass Reeves was responsible for over 3,000 arrests during his career.<eos> Arguably the best lawman in the old West.<eos> If he's that good, why doesn't the town come to him for help?<eos> The Lone Ranger's black?<eos> That's... awesome.<eos> Go on, get.<eos> How many they kill?<eos> Four.<eos> Since this morning.
You're the man of this house while I'm gone, all right?<eos> Go round up your brothers and sisters.<eos> We do this my way. Understood? Yep.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> As long as they catch bullets in the end.<eos> Catch bullets?<eos> What the hell is wrong with y'all?<eos> This ain't the 1820s.<eos> We capture and bring 'em to justice.<eos> Alive.
No, not really.<eos> We're gonna interview witnesses to find out where they went 'cause that's what we do, we're lawmen.<eos> Tontos.<eos> Hey, Seth, Mason asked if you could check the simulator.<eos> It's running sluggish.<eos> Software just needs to be decompiled.<eos> His words. Cool.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> _<eos> Jiya?
He's not grieving.<eos> He's humiliated, and you're just the balm to soothe his broken heart.<eos> He's my best friend. I wouldn't even know what to do.<eos> Well, for one, no peasant skirts.<eos> But I like my skirts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Men don't.<eos> Want to be more than besties?<eos> I could knit a sweater with those.<eos> And no sweaters.
I saw him coming out of a strip club.<eos> He was looking for someone.<eos> I'm not worried, okay?<eos> So order something to go.<eos> This succubus is leaving a trail of bodies.<eos> And bodies will bring the law back to Midnight, and we can't have that.<eos> We need to stop her before she causes more damage.<eos> - So how do we do that?<eos> - Dragon's breath... according to medieval folklore.<eos> - And Wikipedia. - Okay.
I see her everywhere...<eos> When I wake up, when I'm driving, everywhere. I...<eos> I just can't really believe she's... She's gone for good, you know?<eos> She just walked out, and that's it.<eos> Five years.<eos> I feel you, brother, but you need to move on.<eos> You're good.<eos> Avoiding conflict, one of my skills.<eos> Need it growing up in a gypsy caravan.<eos> Wow.
- Help!<eos> - That's Connor.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Everybody split up.<eos> Connor!<eos> What, do you see him?<eos> No.<eos> No, keep looking. - I'll be right back.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> My RV.
So, what happened to the rest of the militia?<eos> Three of them were killed in a standoff with the FBI a year later.<eos> And Ramsay Whitman's still on the wall.<eos> I want you to dig out every file we have on the case.<eos> Locate every agent that worked on it.<eos> Where the hell did Gibbs go with the brother?<eos> I think ten bucks' worth should get us to Baltimore.<eos> Here, here, here.<eos> Why don't you fill 'er up.<eos> Wow.
Never battle the same bull twice.<eos> Moral of the story is...<eos> Drive faster.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell you something, Bubba.<eos> You're gonna have a hard time getting your security deposit back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is...<eos> least of my worries.
That is...<eos> least of my worries.<eos> Two months behind on the rent.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get this show on the road.<eos> Call Ramsay.<eos> Slow down, Spears.<eos> You know how crazy he gets.<eos> Say the wrong thing, and he flips.<eos> Unbelievable.
I'm sorry.<eos> My bad.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thought maybe that guy grabbed my wallet.<eos> Hey, nice picture, Spears.<eos> Come on.<eos> Takeout's across the street.<eos> Can't believe you're back in D.C.<eos> Since last summer.
Well, I'm gonna feel better when we catch.<eos> Ramsay Whitman.<eos> Probably spooked him, he's gonna disappear again.<eos> Where's Quinn?<eos> She just went down to see Abby.<eos> Tell her I'm with Ducky.<eos> He didn't have to die, Duck.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Don't know if it'll help your autopsy, but he was constantly popping those things.<eos> Tetrabenazine.
It's... I haven't been able to tell her.<eos> Yeah, well, Kelly made this for her mom and me when she was in third grade.<eos> I guess I used it too much... It got a crack.<eos> It was hairline at first, but... turned into something bigger.<eos> But look at it now... it's like new.<eos> How'd you do this?<eos> You believe in miracles?<eos> No.<eos> You believe in Abby?<eos> With all my heart.
What would you say?<eos> He's got her cornered.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It was about Maya's leave time.<eos> She wanted more?<eos> Less. I had to practically order her to take a few days off.<eos> She have a reason for wanting to stay on board?<eos> Don't dance around it.<eos> Agent Bishop's saying this ship is full of seamen.<eos> No.
Three Sundays ago, there was a power surge, and it tripped their alarm.<eos> He wasn't home, so he had to turn it off remotely.<eos> By using one of those apps on the phone.<eos> Exactly.<eos> For security, the I.P. address is captured whenever it's used.<eos> Like three Sundays ago.<eos> Well, couldn't you use the I.P. address to locate Kettering's whereabouts?<eos> I can.<eos> Problem is, it could take hours or even days.<eos> Or seconds.
Tremendous.<eos> - Stupendous. - Woo, woo away from me.<eos> That's great.<eos> You are a class act, Gibbs.<eos> I owe you one. Hey, can I get this to go?<eos> Thanks.<eos> So you think of your office as a prison.<eos> Subconsciously, is what I'm saying.<eos> Therefore, your desk is your cell, and your chair is what, Nick?<eos> Solitary confinement.
I'll call Lyle.<eos> He is.<eos> Really?<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> You know you voided the warranty.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> What?<eos> It'll be over in seven seconds.<eos> Resisting... is pointless.<eos> What the hell, bro?
Forgive me for not getting up.<eos> Trust me, he's already up.<eos> Get out.<eos> Man, would you quit messing with my phone?<eos> What are you even looking at anyway?<eos> What I'm looking at, Taj, is a program that shows the status of every alarm you've installed from Virginia to...<eos> Delaware to Maryland.<eos> So? That's company software.<eos> Which you use to rob houses.<eos> Rob what, now?
And right now I care more than anyone else in this building.<eos> Bishop, taking down Chen... it's not gonna bring your boyfriend back.<eos> Qasim wasn't just my boyfriend, Gibbs.<eos> Hey.<eos> Am I late?<eos> Early.<eos> - Again?<eos> - But it's your birthday, so you can do whatever you want.<eos> My God.<eos> Except that.
You want me to get Nasonex?<eos> This isn't how I imagined this.<eos> Imagined what?<eos> He purchased the abandoned radio tower last year on eBay.<eos> I actually think I bid on that.<eos> What really impresses me is I have no idea if you're joking or not.<eos> Sorry, boys, I don't know who that is.<eos> Was.<eos> She killed herself, after receiving a threatening message.<eos> From your compound.
You did not come here to talk business.<eos> This is personal.<eos> No, this is pleasure.<eos> I am not responsible for what happened to your boyfriend.<eos> He is.<eos> Qasim made his own choices in life.<eos> I'm really sorry, Ellie.<eos> I shouldn't have pressured you or said those things.<eos> No, you're right...<eos> about everything. I...
I'll talk to her this week.<eos> How many times have I heard that?<eos> This time I mean it.<eos> Where'd you park?<eos> I'll walk you.<eos> I'm fine. I'm just around the corner.<eos> - Night, then.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> Help!
This time I mean it.<eos> Where'd you park?<eos> I'll walk you.<eos> I'm fine. I'm just around the corner.<eos> - Night, then.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> Help!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Help!
Caitlin or you, Mrs. Kinzie.<eos> If the killer comes back...<eos> I haven't seen her since Ray was...<eos> Where is she, Mrs. Kinzie?<eos> She's run away before, but she always comes back in a day or two.<eos> She and Ray were fighting a lot recently.<eos> What about?<eos> I don't know. She's a teenager.<eos> Can we see Caitlin's room?<eos> No phone, no laptop...
I remember because she ordered the fried calamari and then didn't touch it.<eos> Then he turns up maybe ten minutes later and digs in.<eos> You didn't happen to hear what they were talking about, did you?<eos> When he sat down, she says right away,<eos> "Did you tell her yet?"<eos> Something like that.<eos> Have you seen this girl?<eos> I got her.<eos> Caitlin, stop!<eos> Ow! What the hell? !
The Kinzies took you in.<eos> They cleaned you up, gave you a home.<eos> Like I said, guilt makes people do all k...<eos> Still, you took a bat to the windows of his car.<eos> He could've had you arrested, but he didn't.<eos> Why is that, Caitlin?<eos> You're Anna Valdez.<eos> He said I could be just like you.<eos> I don't think you killed him, Caitlin, but I got to tell you, things are not looking good<eos> - for you right now.
Uh, what'd you watch?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Whatever was on.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> We're here about your ex.<eos> - Zoe? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Actually, she's been arrested.<eos> For killing Judge Kinzie.<eos> - Wha... who?
If I told you I wasn't sleeping with Ray, would you have believed me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe skepticism is some sort of evolutionary shield that helps the species survive.<eos> The truth is, if I flat-out said there's no way I would ever sleep with Ray, it wouldn't have changed your investigation one bit.<eos> We are all endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights.<eos> I recall reading that in some old document.<eos> I believe one of those rights is the right to be respected by your fellow man.<eos> If my relationship with Ray, whatever it was, would've helped you catch or convict his killer, I would've told you.<eos> But because I knew it didn't, I figured I'd rely on... another right referenced in that dusty old document.<eos> Privacy.
- No, James.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> A taxi in Dubai looks like this.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You think I'm joking?<eos> Look, "Uber".<eos> Seriously, you call Uber up here, and you're given a choice-- Prius or helicopter.<eos> Wow!
The fact is, in the office, we decided we'd had enough of them bickering and told them to go out and do a proper road test.<eos> So we did.<eos> We began in London with a real-world test that Clarkson had thought of.<eos> Right, James, we must now see who can open their back door in the shortest time.<eos> - Why?<eos> - There could be an emergency.<eos> People will want to know.<eos> Ready, steady, go!<eos> Oh, mine's open.<eos> Oh, dear.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> - 167 horsepower.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Mine has the performance pack, so it produces 227.<eos> - Does it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's the official figure, is it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - From VW?
Last bit of dead skin.<eos> - OK.<eos> - race mode.<eos> Representing the future here.<eos> I think...<eos> if I can just stay ahead...<eos> This is going to be so close!<eos> The future is gonna take it!<eos> So sorry, Veyron, but your crown is gone.<eos> Wow!
Gas, gas, gas, gas!<eos> Oh, bugger!<eos> Soon, the constant spinning started to have an effect on my teacher.<eos> A little bit more power.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, off the gas.<eos> This is weird.<eos> I thought this would be so easy.<eos> - OK, is it possible to take air?<eos> Fresh air?
He'll be impressed with this.<eos> And he was, so we immediately progressed to the next level.<eos> Just before we start, JÃ©rÃ´me, are you going to make this look really annoyingly easy?<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> OK.<eos> He did.<eos> This is called transitioning-- drifting the car one way and then the other.<eos> Get it right and it's almost balletic.<eos> That is beautiful.<eos> From that to that, seamlessly.
I'd become, for the first time, a driving god.<eos> It really is...<eos> It really is the most amazing feeling when you get just the right amount of power to spin the back wheels, but not so much that you don't spin the whole car, and you hold it on the edge.<eos> No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> He came back from France, where he'd spent one day saying, "Well, I'm brilliant now."<eos> Yeah, well, I am.<eos> Well, now, I'm sorry.<eos> Hammond, it took me ten years to learn how to drift a car.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Mm-hm.
It started out as a Nissan 200SX, but it's been fitted with a 700-horsepower 6.2L V8 and a modified steering rack, so it can do this.<eos> Its owner, a chap called Steve "Baggsy" Biagioni, said that, to prepare for my competition, I needed to put some melons on a row of traffic cones.<eos> What are we doing with these?<eos> Can I put mine down?<eos> They're really heavy.<eos> Well, in a drifting competition, you have what's called clipping points.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So these would be determined points on the track made by the judges as to where they want to see the car.<eos> - Our clipping points are melons?<eos> - Melons, yes.
You have questions.<eos> We have answers.<eos> Did we just get a man killed?<eos> No.<eos> We didn't even know who he was.<eos> We knew he was up to something, that he'd been spying on us at The Farm for months.<eos> Ryan said that whoever the AIC are, what Lydia is doing has nothing to do with it.<eos> It's just black ops.<eos> Who do we go to about this?<eos> N-No one. I...
They already lost Elliot.<eos> You're gonna make them lose him, too?<eos> That's not what I'm doing.<eos> I sent Keyes an e-mail, told him what I found.<eos> You're not gonna get what you want this time.<eos> Thank you, Sebastian.<eos> Truly.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> James!<eos> Shots.
You know, I think all we're saying is, we wanna start making family decisions in a different way.<eos> Well, every other idea you had was crap.<eos> Not to us, you know, but we still had to suck it up.<eos> You can't expect to still be...<eos> Oh, I'm the boss, all right.<eos> I would like the entry codes and the account passwords changed, please.<eos> Right, which codes can we change for you today?<eos> All of them.<eos> And they wanna hit this church...<eos> New Canticle.
It's the one thing you have that every man wants.<eos> You just have to let them think they have the power, but they never do, never, unless you give it to them.<eos> And don't ever give it to them.<eos> So it's... it's just about sex?<eos> I think you can do a little better.<eos> With Craig?<eos> You just have to decide what you want.<eos> So what do you want, Nicky?<eos> You want a hint, baby?<eos> Everything.
How's the commune going?<eos> No commune.<eos> I'm in charge.<eos> You're so full of shit.<eos> The only person those boys hate more than me is you.<eos> God, that is such bullshit.<eos> I trained you, Baz.<eos> You are me.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Sayonara, bitches.
It's nice, isn't it?<eos> Is this your apartment?<eos> It's one of them.<eos> I hope you didn't think I was just some sleazy slumlord.<eos> There's a Miss Janice Browne who pays $4K a month for this groovy pad.<eos> Is it... is it okay to just walk in?<eos> Of course it is, because I'm Janice Browne.<eos> She has a lease with a signature, a Social Security number.<eos> She pays her rent with a money order.<eos> The 1st of every month.
Shit!<eos> How long before the cops get here?<eos> Seven or eight minutes, if they're not at lunch.<eos> Better hurry, then.<eos> So you gonna run a bar?<eos> You don't think I can? No, I...<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> 'Cause I knew you'd give me shit like you always do.<eos> Maybe I would've been happy for you.<eos> Happy about what?

No, I...<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> 'Cause I knew you'd give me shit like you always do.<eos> Maybe I would've been happy for you.<eos> Happy about what?<eos> Deran's bar.
Seven or eight minutes, if they're not at lunch.<eos> Better hurry, then.<eos> So you gonna run a bar?<eos> You don't think I can? No, I...<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> 'Cause I knew you'd give me shit like you always do.<eos> Maybe I would've been happy for you.<eos> Happy about what?<eos> Deran's bar.<eos> What bar?
Studying.<eos> Screw that.<eos> Why don't you come out?<eos> Oh, I thought I wasn't supposed to set foot in Deran's bar.<eos> Yeah, well, look... Agent Orange are playing at The Cove.<eos> You wanna roll?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I forgot I was meeting somebody.<eos> Cool.<eos> Later.
What was it?<eos> A rip curl contest down in Baja?<eos> I swear, the boy was scared shitless.<eos> He was taking down surfers twice his age nobody, and this bar proves it.<eos> So here's to the runt of my litter, my beautiful baby boy.<eos> To Deran.<eos> To Deran!<eos> What's going on out here, baby?<eos> You couldn't just let me have even this?<eos> What?
Know where you're goin'?<eos> Yeah, storage room.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is all this stuff?<eos> Tshirts and DVDs.<eos> Who watches DVDs anymore? I don't know.<eos> It's heavy.<eos> You have an apostle spirit.<eos> That's good, right?<eos> Absolutely.
From that point on, we'll have an hour before the janitor gets downstairs.<eos> We'll be long gone by then. This crane thing gonna work?<eos> Yeah. Genius over here did the calculations.<eos> It'll work.<eos> Unless you have to.<eos> What am I doing here, Javi?<eos> And please don't tell me this is about me not wanting to be your mommy 20 years ago.<eos> You know, I listened to the tapes.<eos> What tapes are those? The tapes.<eos> Manny's.
Jake and I used to work with Manny before he left California.<eos> How much you want, Javi?<eos> 300 grand.<eos> Javi knows.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Jesus.<eos> What happened?<eos> 3:00 A.M., I got dragged out of bed by a bunch of psychopaths.<eos> What'd they want?<eos> Manny and the tapes.
Okay?<eos> don't get hot and do anything stupid with that thing.<eos> I won't if they won't.<eos> What's taking your boys so long?<eos> My boys aren't coming.<eos> This is our problem, not theirs.<eos> It's just us?<eos> Just us.<eos> We're meeting Javi by the jetty in one hour.<eos> Kind of like the old days?
You know for years, you paid Manny off to keep his mouth shut.<eos> But me?<eos> You're Craig's father, for god sake.<eos> We had a baby together.<eos> Does he know that?<eos> !<eos> No, he doesn't know that 'cause you never told him!<eos> You treat me like I'm an employee!<eos> I don't know where you think you're goin'.<eos> Anywhere but with you.
50 grand?<eos> 100?<eos> More?<eos> I'm not gonna talk about it.<eos> That's why you broke up with me, right?<eos> To protect me from it all?<eos> So I wouldn't get sucked in?<eos> But if I wanna get sucked in, j?<eos> What if that's what I want?<eos> Shit.
Walk around, look for a street sign.<eos> Just look up.<eos> Any kind of street sign.<eos> Um... trailhead and... And ash.<eos> What?<eos> Smurf, can you... Can you hear me?<eos> What is it?<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Hello?<eos> Smurf?
You think I came all this way for 25 grand?<eos> For the last goddamn time, where's the real money?<eos> I swear! How'd you hurt your leg?<eos> No! - Nicky.<eos> - Who took Nicky, j?<eos> Tell me where you are.<eos> We'll come get you.<eos> Trailhead and... and ash.<eos> It's where we buried him.<eos> Who? Javi's father.
You told us Lou ran off with the money.<eos> Javi is threatening to go to the police and let them know where the body is. So pay him.<eos> I tried.<eos> How much does he want?<eos> He wants $300k.<eos> Except Jake put a gun in my face and took off with my money.<eos> Why the hell would you trust Jake?<eos> I didn't have any options, did I?<eos> Where'd you get 300k?<eos> My savings.
I was bigger than him, too.<eos> It's funny, you know, smurf is always talking about how we have to have each other's backs.<eos> But she loved when we fought.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Nico.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> We good?<eos> It's in the alley.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Uniforms?
- That's the one.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> I haven't been here in 20 years.<eos> I wasn't expecting to come back, either.<eos> We're not going in unless you're sure.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's the one.<eos> It's right next to the drainage ditch on the southeast side of the street.<eos> Whose idea was this place?<eos> Jake's.
Let's call it 200. No, no, 400.<eos> She doesn't wanna give you anything.<eos> Dude, I can't go back to my crew with 200. Come on.<eos> I'm trying to help you here, man.<eos> It's 200 or it's nothing.<eos> Those are your choices.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> You remember when your dad used to get loaded and kick the shit out of you in front of Smurf's yard?<eos> Man, you've come a long way from crying yourself to sleep and pissing the bed, man.<eos> Good for you.
Let's get the hell outta here.<eos> Got it?<eos> Javi?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> I really do owe you an explanation?<eos> You know all that bullshit about me not having any room?<eos> That was just silly.<eos> I didn't take you in because you were worthless.<eos> You were stupid and angry and impulsive, just like your father.<eos> Goddamn...
I know where he works.<eos> Will you come, talk to him?<eos> Mm, no, I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> If... if Leon's not calling them back, he's scared.<eos> Okay, you've done time.<eos> You know how he feels. Please?<eos> You really won't do it for $50?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> You are not doing shots off my stomach.<eos> Dana!
I'll do it.<eos> Hope you don't mind a little bit of sweat, though.<eos> It's hot as balls in here.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Nah, I'm... I'm cool, man.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, whatever, man.<eos> I owe you one.<eos> Thank you. - Eric.<eos> - Dana.
Tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, I'll go to the bank.<eos> Use credit if I have to.<eos> Good.<eos> - Yeah? You know what I was thinking earlier?<eos> Do you remember when Pope was 13 and he decided that the cops had tapped all our phones lines, ripped every phone out of the wall?<eos> And then he ran out back and climbed up the telephone pole? He was gonna rip down those wires.<eos> If you hadn't talked him down, Pope would've been electrocuted.<eos> Is that why you took me in?<eos> No, Baz.
You know, the night of the robbery at the church, I scored.<eos> Went on the roof of my apartment and fixed.<eos> I talk to the cops, my PO will be there, I'll get tested.<eos> Piss hot, blow my parole.<eos> Okay, this is what you do.<eos> You tell them that you've been sick.<eos> You take 6 Sudafed PEs.<eos> They make you piss hot, too.<eos> Nothing connects you to the robbery, right?<eos> No. Hell, no.
Here. I got, uh...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I got it. Don't be stupid.<eos> Come on.<eos> Goods in kind then.<eos> Um, drinks, your bar, tonight? Yeah.<eos> I mean, it wasn't an excuse to, uh...<eos> It'll be good to catch up.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Yeah.
UC San Diego.<eos> - No shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's awesome, man.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Yeah, you know, I like competing, but, um, you know, I don't wanna be one of those 60-year-old surfers with a 1-bedroom off the Strand.<eos> Just a place to keep your boards.<eos> I don't wanna be a 60-year-old, lugging some 300-pound safe down some tunnel.<eos> I used to think I was so different from my family 'cause of all the shit that I was hiding.<eos> What baggage?
- Good.<eos> - Hey, you speak Spanish?<eos> - No. Why?<eos> No reason.<eos> I want a gun.<eos> - What?<eos> - I should have one.<eos> No, no, you shouldn't.<eos> - Just in case.<eos> - In case what?
- Baz?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Finally. Good for you, huh?<eos> - And you.<eos> - I can send you guys some men.<eos> - No.<eos> No, man, we trust you.<eos> Look, this is a big haul.<eos> Is there a place to piss around here?<eos> Yeah, in the back.
Those assholes killed Kevin. And we killed them.<eos> - It sucks...<eos> - Staff Sergeant.<eos> Okay? But it's over.<eos> What's up?<eos> - Give her a break, man.<eos> - Kevin was killed by a sniper who detonated the vest to cover it up.<eos> From the BKA... they found it on one of the attackers.<eos> You were right about one thing, a bunch of terrorists looking to kill some Marines.<eos> - Not some Marines.
- Kevin was killed by a sniper who detonated the vest to cover it up.<eos> From the BKA... they found it on one of the attackers.<eos> You were right about one thing, a bunch of terrorists looking to kill some Marines.<eos> - Not some Marines.<eos> - They were after us.<eos> Why?<eos> I have no idea, but we better stick together until we do.<eos> - Hey, where are you?<eos> - Well, our flights were all messed up, so I called our guardian angel.<eos> - Memphis?
What about Kevin?<eos> Not leaving without him.<eos> Well, hurry home, okay?<eos> I promise I will, baby.<eos> Love you. Love you too.<eos> Sprechen sie American?<eos> What's your deal?<eos> They're moving you.<eos> Really?<eos> Your place?
Not leaving without him.<eos> Well, hurry home, okay?<eos> I promise I will, baby.<eos> Love you. Love you too.<eos> Sprechen sie American?<eos> What's your deal?<eos> They're moving you.<eos> Really?<eos> Your place?<eos> No, Landstuhl.
Give-give me, give me Sam Hanna's L.A.<eos> I don't do listicles.<eos> Why?<eos> They're so fun and digestible.<eos> Yeah, so are gummy vitamins.<eos> Doesn't make 'em okay.<eos> Mm, not even the bear-shaped multivites?<eos> 'Cause those are awesome.<eos> I mean, how else do you get your daily recommended dosage?<eos> Direct from the source.
Maximum romance.<eos> See, this is exactly what I was thinking.<eos> But this is also what she's expecting, which is why I can't do that. Oh.<eos> So you're looking for the unexpected.<eos> See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> You and I, simpatico. We are so not simpatico.<eos> We are simpatico.<eos> - We are not simpatico at all. - Guys, needed up in Ops A.S.A.P.<eos> That's it?<eos> No quips?
But this is also what she's expecting, which is why I can't do that. Oh.<eos> So you're looking for the unexpected.<eos> See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> You and I, simpatico.

First, they took Granger.<eos> Who went after Heather.<eos> Who's still unconscious.<eos> Which means we don't know what really happened at Heather's.<eos> So I have to make it back to the house and see if I can find something there.<eos> Mm. LAPD has that place on lockdown.<eos> There's no way you'll get in unnoticed.<eos> Plus, it's probably just a safe house.<eos> And we have no surveillance?<eos> Not from last night or this morning?
Not from last night or this morning?<eos> We poured over every angle.<eos> Still nothing.<eos> Guys.<eos> Heather's awake.<eos> She just I.D.'d Granger as her attacker.<eos> No...<eos> Let's go.<eos> You ready to talk?<eos> Not to you.
I mean, you've had a whole year to upgrade.<eos> I'm not looking for, like, a barista with a bow tie offering me lattes, but maybe you could get coffee better than what it is they serve in the vending machine of my carwash.<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Oh, that depends.<eos> You gonna go get my captain?<eos> Deeks, I already told you, he's not available.<eos> Yeah, I remember when you said that earlier.<eos> You know, as a cop, you know what I use more than any of my training?<eos> Intuition.
And that, Heather, means you need protection.<eos> We can protect you.<eos> Like you protected Granger?<eos> I just saved your ass.<eos> It'd be a lot easier to toss you out on the street again.<eos> And, believe me, that's exactly what I want to do right now.<eos> You didn't protect Natalie, either.<eos> Who are you working for?<eos> It's not LAPD. It's not DEA. It's not ATF.<eos> Another agency, perhaps? An independent?
You two cover that way.<eos> It is my job to ensure. That we behave on our journey to the labour camp.<eos> We know exactly where we're going and exactly what you are. Everyone, calm down.<eos> I just watched my wife.<eos> Shot in the head, and you want me to calm down? ! We're all prisoners here.<eos> But only one of us.<eos> Is working with the nazis.<eos> You said.<eos> You know where we are going?<eos> To a camp.
We are short-staffed, and someone. With your courage, well, It's worth its weight in gold out here.<eos> I'd like you as my associate. At race and resettlement, Starting immediately.<eos> Well, I'm... I'm flattered, but can I think about it?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I'll take you to a hotel. We use, and you can start at the office 9 a.M. Sharp.<eos> We're going to take you all back to our camp.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Dammit!<eos> Still no word from harry?
I learned I need to pick better friends. - Nick...<eos> - Just drop it, okay?<eos> Noah's not my friend anymore, and you should stay away from him, too.<eos> Everybody thinks he's such a good guy,<eos> - but none of them know.<eos> - Um, Grace?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Look, I have to get back to work.<eos> But I'm going to find out what happened.<eos> Not from me.
I might even try to convince Sam to get up there and play a bit.<eos> Oh, that's gonna take a lot of convincing.<eos> - What, are you kidding?<eos> - He only puts his guitar down long enough to pick up a scalpel.<eos> You've seen him play right?<eos> He's really good.<eos> Well, I haven't really seen him play guitar much at all.<eos> Maybe once, but...<eos> - He doesn't play anymore?<eos> - Not in front of me, no.
The kind my mom would have given.<eos> All I'm doing is keeping the customers happy.<eos> You're actually doing a lot more than that.<eos> - Hey. - Hello.<eos> Thank you for the casserole.<eos> - I'm glad you enjoyed it.<eos> - Ooh, what are you making?<eos> - Chicken Alfredo.<eos> - I found out from Liam that it's one of Sam's favorites.<eos> - Yum.
We got movement out back!<eos> Cover back!<eos> It's a beautiful day, boys.<eos> We're all part of the Prophecy.<eos> Isn't that glorious?<eos> Okay, any final thoughts or concerns<eos> - on the West Africa trip? - Yeah.<eos> I'm just not seeing it.<eos> Seeing what?<eos> The point of the trip.
Seeing what?<eos> The point of the trip.<eos> The trip that leaves in two hours?<eos> You mean beyond funding clean-energy partnerships with Nigeria and Senegal that will bring millions of Africans electricity?<eos> Thus bolstering two of the most dynamic nations in the region?<eos> Not to mention locking in education and employment initiatives for women and girls.<eos> Which is key to transforming developing economies.<eos> So... you're not seeing the point of that?<eos> This is the first trip of the new administration.<eos> Indeed, of Dalton's new Independent party.
Africa is literally the future.<eos> Sure.<eos> But right now?<eos> Congress only gave us a third of the money we asked for.<eos> There's a good chance we could go all the way there and not succeed.<eos> - And also, you hate to fly.<eos> - That's not it.<eos> That's mostly not it.<eos> So your concern, Daisy, is by going with such fanfare, if we were to come up short, it could do a great deal of harm.<eos> To the administration.
So far, he's not really saying much that's useful.<eos> Well, look, I would be happy to help, but you must have experts better qualified in Islamic extremism.<eos> He also has ties to another radical group you're very familiar with.<eos> The Covenant of John?<eos> I haven't heard that name in a while.<eos> Apparently, he's one of the survivors of the raid on their compound in Bolivia.<eos> Yeah, I almost wasn't.<eos> We're hoping your experience with the group can provide some insight into why a former member of a Christian doomsday cult is selling bombs to ISIS.<eos> Wait.<eos> Bombs?
Sign those forms and get that part from Italy to Togo today.<eos> Do you read me, Colonel?<eos> Those ranks aren't part of the actual chain of command.<eos> Well, is that right?<eos> Well, you know who might settle that for us, is the commander-in-chief.<eos> May I borrow your phone please?<eos> I will get the part for you, ma'am, ASAP.<eos> Then we're done here.<eos> Good day, Colonel.<eos> Good day.
The Nigerians really rolled out the red carpet.<eos> - Welcome to Abuja.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Madam Ambassador, thank you.<eos> Apologies for the small reception, ma'am.<eos> Apparently President Akinagbe had some urgent business to attend to.<eos> Is there any chance we're still all set for the announcement about the wind power project?<eos> About that...<eos> I wanted to get in touch earlier, but since you were flying commercial, you lacked secure...<eos> Secure comms, yeah.
How well do you remember Rex?<eos> Well, we spent every waking hour together in the mountains of Bolivia praying for the end of the world, so, you know, pretty well.<eos> He tried calling your old phone number several times.<eos> Look, I don't want anything to do with those people, okay?<eos> I have a job.<eos> I can finally sleep again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> So, what do you think Rex wants?<eos> Probably nothing good.
He was a weird guy.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Did he really make a bomb for ISIS?<eos> Does that surprise you?<eos> The ISIS part, yeah. The bomb part, no.<eos> You don't think he'd convert to Islam?<eos> Rex was hard-core into the Covenant, the end-times prophecy, the rapture to come, all that stuff, even more than the reverend.<eos> And the bomb?<eos> I mean, those ISIS types want to blow up the world, and that was definitely on Rex's agenda.<eos> But not on Reverend Finch's.
Hopefully, they'll buy what the secretary's selling.<eos> We'll see soon enough.<eos> Listen, we're off the clock for a little while later today, and I was gonna go someplace you might find interesting.<eos> Would you like to come along?<eos> Okay.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Well, look who it is.<eos> The interloper.
Mr. Chen, we've got to stop meeting like this.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I would think your plane would've been repaired by now.<eos> Or perhaps, something else is keeping you here.<eos> I-I'm not gonna comment on that, either way.<eos> Enjoy Togo.<eos> Whatever you're offering in exchange for the mineral rights, we can pay more or build faster.<eos> Never underestimate American ingenuity, Ming.<eos> Never underestimate Chinese will, Elizabeth.<eos> Safe travels.
I've never seen DoD send a replacement part to such a remote location so quickly.<eos> It came on its own cargo plane.<eos> That's my chief of staff for you.<eos> So, just to be clear, we're not actually trying to invest in Togo's phosphate industry.<eos> No.<eos> We just want to make China think we are, so they do.<eos> But President Fabre's price for letting them beat us out is to force China to agree to benchmarks for sustainability as well as female education and employment.<eos> Which could tie them to similar benchmarks in the future.<eos> It's a big win.<eos> Not just for us, but for Africa as well.
What do you do now?<eos> I'm running a stop sign.<eos> And then the car turns left onto Whitlock Place.<eos> I don't know where I'm going.<eos> This isn't the way to my house.<eos> I was hoping for driver error.<eos> This is a whole lot scarier.<eos> What happens next?<eos> I see him.<eos> Todd?
Meridians are a popular model.<eos> He's got a huge victim pool.<eos> Well, we're working on narrowing it down.<eos> Did you get Reid that lawyer?<eos> I'm on my way to the jail right now to make the introduction.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll let you know how it goes.<eos> - Spencer, hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Fiona Duncan.
That's a problem.<eos> Because I don't need you to be innocent, but I do need you to be able to assist in your own defense.<eos> There's a lot I don't remember.<eos> Ok. I want to be very clear about this.<eos> I'm not here to judge you.<eos> I'm here to defend you.<eos> My goal is a simple one...<eos> To keep you out of jail.<eos> But in order to do that, I need a narrative.<eos> Your story.
Well, you consented to a postponement of your arraignment so you'd have time to find representation, now that you have me, that's what'll happen first.<eos> I'll get it calendared as soon as possible.<eos> And I'll plead not guilty.<eos> And I'll move to have you released on bail pending trial.<eos> After that, we start an uphill battle.<eos> The bad news is they have a lot of circumstantial evidence against you.<eos> Is there any good news?<eos> The good news is they don't have a murder weapon.<eos> What is going on?<eos> What...
She was going to school. She wanted to be a physician's assistant.<eos> What about a boyfriend?<eos> She doesn't have one. Not according to her social media.<eos> Looks like Meredith was her own girl.<eos> Chronically single. Friends kept trying to set her up.<eos> All right, well, this unsub specifically targeted her over other available targets.<eos> Is there a connection to the driver?<eos> His name's Mark Keeling.<eos> Mm, I got bupkis on that.<eos> No connection.
Is there a connection to the driver?<eos> His name's Mark Keeling.<eos> Mm, I got bupkis on that.<eos> No connection.<eos> The one thing he's been consistent about.<eos> That was the AUSA.<eos> Good news?<eos> They're offering us a deal.<eos> They want me to plead guilty?<eos> To involuntary manslaughter.
Good news?<eos> They're offering us a deal.<eos> They want me to plead guilty?<eos> To involuntary manslaughter.<eos> And the offer's 2 to 5 years.<eos> I'll leave you two to discuss this.<eos> Wait, don't go.<eos> I want her to stay.<eos> She can hear anything you have to say to me.<eos> 2 to 5 years.
Torres.<eos> Driskill.<eos> Reid.<eos> Line up over there.<eos> Hold up.<eos> You, you, go.<eos> You, back in line.<eos> Something wrong with your hearing?<eos> No...<eos> Back in line!
Why?<eos> Did he do this to me?<eos> Neela Travers?<eos> I don't know her.<eos> One last question, and then we'll let you get some rest.<eos> Did your attacker say anything to you?<eos> It sounded like a foreign language.<eos> Do you remember any of the words?<eos> I'm sorry. I'm not helping, am I?<eos> Oh, Neela.
Looks like he's gonna cry.<eos> Or wet his pants.<eos> Don't go. We're just messin'.<eos> Out of respect, you know?<eos> It's all over the yard how you stole from Milos.<eos> I didn't steal from Milos.<eos> That was my stuff. No.<eos> That was a tribute.<eos> Everyone has to pay when they join the group.<eos> What group?
We were gonna walk to the museum together.<eos> How long have you guys been dating?<eos> It's only been 6 weeks, but I think she could be the one.<eos> Ah, that's great.<eos> So you guys tell each other everything.<eos> So then you told her about the, uh, comments that you made on a website called "no means yes"?<eos> How did you...<eos> I didn't say...<eos> You didn't write, "if the bitch wants a big wedding, dump her"?<eos> Or this one.
- Or, there's my favorite... - Ok, ok.<eos> I posted those things, but I don't really believe that.<eos> Then why did you write it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was lonely, feeling sorry for myself.<eos> I wanted people to think I was a player.<eos> But all that was before I met Melinda.<eos> Did anyone else know about your plans to go to the museum?<eos> Some friends.<eos> Friends, from the manosphere?
I've posted pictures of us.<eos> All right, we're gonna need their contact information.<eos> Hi.<eos> There wasn't really time for proper introductions.<eos> My name's Spencer...<eos> Reid.<eos> Calvin Shaw.<eos> Guessing you already knew that.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Hey, coffee?
What has he done now?<eos> Mary.<eos> Oh, um, um, I have something.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Look what I have made for the little one.<eos> It's nice, isn't it?<eos> Oh, uh, please, have a seat.<eos> - How are you feeling? - Darnley, I thought that we agreed that you wouldn't make a drunken, whoring spectacle of yourself anymore.<eos> And yet Greer tells me that you were stumbling around the halls last night, drunk and incoherent.<eos> Last night?
Darnley, you're my husband and the father of my child.<eos> I don't want to see you suffer.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> It...<eos> Please, let me help you.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I know of a facility where they have the best treatment.<eos> If you want to be a part of our child's life, you need to go there and heal.<eos> Please.<eos> For all of us.
The baby.<eos> No, fetch the midwife at once!<eos> - The child is coming.<eos> Hurry! - (Mary pants)<eos> WOMAN: Look at all these jewels.<eos> And F-French cheese.<eos> How did you manage to afford all this?<eos> I didn't, Mother.<eos> They're gifts.<eos> From Queen Elizabeth.
What will you do when he gets here?<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> If it were me, if someone took the man I loved, I would want to avenge him.<eos> Jane, would you help me... take vengeance?<eos> Of course, if my queen commands it.<eos> There is nothing I wouldn't do for you, Elizabeth.<eos> Really?<eos> You would do that?<eos> Kill a man and ask nothing in return?<eos> How selfless of you.
Well, you can sit tight.<eos> We got this.<eos> This isn't a solo mission.<eos> I thought they all were.<eos> Gentlemen, please.<eos> Mr. Carrera, I'm glad you could meet with us on such short notice.<eos> Two important men want to bring much-needed investment capital to the people of Venezuela.<eos> How can I say "No" to that?<eos> So, what's your play with Ryan?<eos> No play, really.
I-I didn't know he had a roommate.<eos> I barely know him.<eos> We've just met.<eos> Yeah, well, I barely know him, too, and I've lived with him for under half a year.<eos> But I just think Sebastian doesn't open up to that many people.<eos> Anyway... uh...<eos> Am I... doing the right thing?<eos> I work on the Hill.<eos> That's a long commute for a guy.<eos> For anything, really.
_<eos> _<eos> This case has been a roller coaster.<eos> On the one hand, we just found evidence that Larry's wife, Margaret, was having an affair before she was murdered, giving us a potential suspect.<eos> You will notice that I found samples of semen in the bedroom.<eos> Male semen?
Didn't you tell them who you were?<eos> That's probably why they're shooting at us.<eos> We've lost the main thrusters. Brace for impact!<eos> Looks like recruiting the Wrens will be more difficult than I thought.<eos> You weren't easy to recruit either. So we switch to plan B.<eos> Better stay out of sight. I have a feeling we're gonna need you later.<eos> Now, remember, I could be related to these guys.<eos> Don't worry. I'll play nice.<eos> Ezra...<eos> Jedi?
But if Clan Wren acts against the Empire...<eos> They'll kill him.<eos> Why didn't you try and find me?<eos> Find you?<eos> Sabine, when you ran away, it saved you.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Coming back here has put you in danger.<eos> As much danger as holding that blade.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> From Maul.
That is the only logical explanation for their success. And our failure.<eos> I will do everything in my power to find this spy, Grand Admiral.<eos> Thank you for your enthusiasm, Lieutenant.<eos> However, few are above suspicion.<eos> ISB Colonel Yularen will question each of you.<eos> In the meantime, be vigilant.<eos> Watch your subordinates closely, and your peers even closer.<eos> Our spy must be unmasked quickly, as I'm on the verge of locating the rebel base in this sector.<eos> I've narrowed it down to these worlds.<eos> From among thousands. How?
Just breathe.<eos> Just breathe. - Hey. Hey now.<eos> - Winston, Winston. Winston.<eos> A-a word, please. - Huh? Yeah, coming.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, man, you look familiar. Did I pull you over last week?<eos> Why so many?<eos> There are 30 people out there.<eos> We do not have enough china!<eos> Or forks or prawns.
Do you ever think it's, like... it's not good that we're so similar?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> You know, my Great Uncle Shep Wallingford used to say,<eos> "You buy the horse that you see in the mirror."<eos> - Did you say "Wallingford"? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I have Wallingfords in my family, out near Boston.<eos> Ah, mine are in, uh, Newburyport.<eos> They were kind of, like, local celebrities.<eos> They were well-known for making...<eos> - ... women's watches. - ...
All right, let's talk vats.<eos> Okay, so last year, flaws in our safety grate resulted in roughly one clown villain every three months.<eos> So we changed the material on the grate - to an acid-proof alloy.<eos> - I'm a little confused.<eos> We're not interested in mechanical grates.<eos> We wanna upgrade to a force field system.<eos> And I explained all this in my email.<eos> Oh... now, well, it sounds like somebody dropped the ball.<eos> Who did you send the email to?<eos> - You.
Okay, I'm not buying it, but I'm very intrigued by the Baldwin thing.<eos> All right, look, if Alex is a superhero, then he should be able to catch... - ... this. - Hey!<eos> Whoa, look out, boss.<eos> Well, I mean, of course he's not going to catch it.<eos> It would give him away.<eos> My kid made that mug, you idiot.<eos> ♪ Daddy doesn't love me ♪<eos> ♪ I can ski in and out of the chalet ♪ ♪ But not into his heart ♪<eos> Ooh, that's good.<eos> - ♪ Not into his heart ♪
Lars, I believe you are a connoisseur.<eos> There are only four bottles of this in the world.<eos> And Albert, I understand you're somewhat of a film buff.<eos> For you, the complete works of Brendan Fraser.<eos> The master.<eos> Brendan Fraser?<eos> He's revered in Atlantis for some reason.<eos> - And for Anthony, perfume for your wife, and a second bottle of the same perfume for whoever.<eos> I have to be honest with you, when we left that meeting, we were gonna go with a local company.<eos> Really?
Not a superhero. Okay.<eos> Attention, everyone, we have an announcement.<eos> Wayne Security has a new client.<eos> The Lost City of Atlantis!<eos> All right, now let's get our sink on!<eos> Bring out the tuna!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> ♪ Your daddy doesn't love you ♪<eos> ♪ You can ski in and out of your chalet ♪ ♪ But not into his heart ♪<eos> ♪ No, not into his heart ♪
In fact, we have so much evidence that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force, stated that it's an embarrassment of riches. We have so much.<eos> I'm Richard Doty.<eos> I was assigned as a special agent with the Air Force office special investigations at Kirtland Air Force base.<eos> I was a counter-intelligence officer at the base.<eos> During my time there, my first few months there,<eos> I was briefed into a special access program involving the US government's investigation and contacts with extraterrestrial. The visitation of these extraterrestrials to... To Earth.<eos> "I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on Earth."<eos> President Harry S. Truman.<eos> And it started out with a crash at Roswell.<eos> Headline Additions, July 8th, 1947.
Now the craft was a more or less an oval or egg-shaped craft.<eos> It wasn't saucer shaped.<eos> That particular craft... There were some problems with...<eos> Number one, getting it onto the flatbed to take it up to Area 51.<eos> The interior craft was, uh... It didn't have any actual levers or flight control systems that we would identify as a flight control system.<eos> But they eventually, I think, over some time figured it out.<eos> And it was done all by hands.<eos> The creatures would put their hands on controls, and they'd have this headset on, and this headset would somehow control, or help them control the aircraft.<eos> And they did discuss the fact that there were bodies.<eos> Extra-terrestrial bodies, yes.
The fingers had no thumbs... Just four fingers. Suction devices under the tips of their fingers.<eos> You know, the four fragile fingers, and the long arm, real short joint.<eos> Almost looked like they were nude. But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on.<eos> One was alive... Partially alive at the time that this happened.<eos> They died in... I believe it was 1952. But the bodies of the extraterrestrials that were found at the scene were in a deep freeze...<eos> One of the briefing officers that was taking us around and talking about what was going on, they said that there had been over a hundred crashes in that four corners area.<eos> I just saw another craft...<eos> After Roswell, there was a flurry of ET activity across the globe.<eos> Dr. Greer spent eight years trying to persuade members of congress, and other high level government officials in the intelligence community to disclose what was happening.<eos> But to no avail.
It's a big nut to crack. But I think that if you could do that, I think that people would stop looking at each other with a certain level of hostility, like, we do now.<eos> I guess it's kinda corny but it's that bright future that I see that we could all attain if just a few things could be changed.<eos> Imagine interplanetary trade, how exciting that would be?<eos> You have to adjust your cosmology, you have to adjust your whole concept of arguing species being at the apex of all biological evolution in the universe.<eos> And you also have to cross-modify your judgment that the entire universe was created just as the stage upon which the drama of the human development is unfolding.<eos> I think there's a lot more going on in the universe than just that.<eos> And this is why it's time for the people to lead the whole ending of the secrecy and do the disclosure.<eos> As we the human family confront the reality of extraterrestrial life, it is perhaps worthwhile to reflect.<eos> Was our doubt really due to a lack of evidence?<eos> Or merely a lack of imagination?
- Fine, I'll do it myself.<eos> - Do not touch the door.<eos> You are a target, he is a bomb maker.<eos> Let's take a look at what's on the other side of the door.<eos> I was right.<eos> Felix isn't here.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because he's wired up enough C4 on this door to level the whole building.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Bomb squad.
She is.<eos> But her phone has been very useful.<eos> I pinged the cell tower that sent Felix's last text.<eos> He was somewhere in this four-block radius in the financial district.<eos> He must've been there for a reason, so I printed out a list of all of the businesses in the area.<eos> Maybe one of them rings a bell?<eos> Are you gonna tell Ben?<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> And it's none of your business.<eos> As your investigator, yes.
Rhys, no.<eos> No what?<eos> No to whatever it is you're planning.<eos> Planning?<eos> I'm agreeing.<eos> We do the job, Justine makes the arrest, the car goes back to the evidence impound.<eos> Where you'll steal it.<eos> I knew we were on the same page.<eos> Much easier to steal a car from an impound lot<eos> - than from a museum.
Justine already thinks we stole the diamonds.<eos> - If the car goes missing...<eos> - She'll never know.<eos> She will put us both in jail.<eos> You can't keep playing both ends against the middle.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> It's time to pick a lane and and stay there.<eos> What are you two boys up to?<eos> - Just waiting for you.<eos> - Nothing criminal.
I chartered you a jet.<eos> I recommend a destination with lax extradition laws.<eos> I hardly know what to say.<eos> Why the change of heart?<eos> Let's just say I'm starting to know what it feels like to have the fruit of your loins wish you dead.<eos> She is a clever child, isn't she?<eos> She tried to kill me.<eos> She tried to kill us.<eos> It's actually rather promising.<eos> For the Firm's future.
How long did it take you to plan all this?<eos> How do you know it was me and not Felix?<eos> Because Felix was loyal to my family for years before someone got to him.<eos> Three months.<eos> Felt like forever.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's my own vanity, but I find myself feeling oddly proud.<eos> - Of me?
I already know.<eos> I underestimated my target.<eos> It's not bourbon, but...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just closed another case, which means I'm two for two.<eos> They're freakin' loving me in FBI land.<eos> Well, you're very lovable.<eos> I'm even better with a tan.<eos> Our villa has a pool and an ocean.<eos> Yeah, about that.
All of us arrested on the same day by different law enforcement agencies?<eos> This is an attack on NCIS.<eos> You made the deal with the secretary of defense.<eos> You had 90 days to find the mole, and your 90 days have expired. Hands up!<eos> I'm in charge here.<eos> And I can explain what's going on.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Duggan's been shot.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> Disneyland.
Please.<eos> You're out of here.<eos> What?<eos> On your feet.<eos> You're not gonna regret this.<eos> Oh, I'm not talking to you.<eos> Tiny, you're out of here. Thanks for your help, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, my gosh, wait a minute, you were trying to use him as intimidation?<eos> Oh, you amateur!
Come on, man, this is important.<eos> What's your operating budget?<eos> Uh, I'm not sure exactly.<eos> $2.8 billion last year.<eos> No?<eos> $1.2 billion. Oh, don't feel bad.<eos> The FBI gets $9.5.<eos> You know what my agency gets?<eos> Take a guess.<eos> $1, $2 bil.
I can handle that.<eos> Well, what about Granger?<eos> You're only making this worse for yourself.<eos> I sexted your mom.<eos> So far the manhunt for the fugitives has come up empty, as both federal and local law expand their search.<eos> So this is how it ends.<eos> Please release all nonessential personnel.<eos> They'll be safer on their own away from here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - The hospital.
Fine. You can have flashbangs.<eos> Yes. Kens, really don't think that's the best idea.<eos> What I think is a good idea is that we move.<eos> Let's go. Whoa, you guys.<eos> This could be my new team name.<eos> What do you like better, "Flashbang" or "Bulletproof"?<eos> How about "Soundproof"?<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> End of the road, Carl.<eos> Inside.
Amen to that, brother.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> Deeks, you have a visitor.<eos> Are they bigger than a bread box?<eos> Hey. What are you doing here?<eos> Detective Whiting said I could see you.<eos> That is uncharacteristically kind of her.<eos> Maybe my message of love is wearing off on you.<eos> No, she just promised to tell me everything about the murder of your former partner,<eos> Detective Frances Boyle.
Was he a traitor, too?<eos> And you, I should've left in that Russian prison.<eos> I'm glad you didn't.<eos> This is how you thank us?<eos> Your job is to chase after drunk sailors and wayward Marines.<eos> You were warned to stay out of the Middle East.<eos> I was protecting my people.<eos> And in doing so, you undid months of our work and jeopardized the security of the entire region.<eos> You have no idea what we're doing over there.<eos> All right, enough talking.
You have no idea what we're doing over there.<eos> All right, enough talking.<eos> Time to face the music.<eos> At least tell me where Agent Blye is before you kill me.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I don't know where she is.<eos> She's with Ferris, which... is unfortunate for her.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because they have a personal history together.<eos> From rehab?

You're feeling jilted.<eos> Only a week ago, the public wanted you to be King.<eos> It's not about that.<eos> And now you must literally stand aside.<eos> And yes, you must stand behind your brother.<eos> People need tribes and chieftains.<eos> Who stands where, who has the tallest feathers on their head.<eos> People crave hierarchy.<eos> They look to bloodlines for it because family matters.<eos> To everyone.
You know you're not good enough for her.<eos> You never will be.<eos> I only tell you what you want to hear. To get what I want.<eos> You're Vegas scum with fuzzy eyebrows.<eos> Definitely not a prince.<eos> You dumb son of a bitch.<eos> Relationships worked out so well for you in the past.<eos> Jasper. Trust me.<eos> Yeah, that's what you wanna do.<eos> No smear campaign.

- You did so well, babe.<eos> You really did, love.<eos> I'm sorry, but you should be done being sick.<eos> Syrup of ipecac usually does three good pukes.<eos> So, what the hell, S?<eos> We did all of this on account of Delphine?<eos> She travelled here from the island at great personal risk.<eos> To warn us to keep Kira away from Dyad.<eos> And she and Cosima have identified whatever gene they're looking for in Kira?<eos> Westmorland's fountain of youth gene.
Dyad?<eos> Yes, Mr Frontenac?<eos> Kira Manning seems to have come down with the flu.<eos> I verify it as, "She emptied the contents of her stomach onto my shoes."<eos> Mr Westmorland wants to begin her hormone treatments.<eos> As she is ill, I thought it best to let her recover at home.<eos> Not arouse suspicion by dragging her out of there.<eos> We'll let her rest for now.<eos> With Yanis gone, perhaps you'll focus on what's important.<eos> Kira's mutation.
Whatever you're thinking, Susan...<eos> We can just leave.<eos> I can help you to the boathouse.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> He and Coady are too dangerous together.<eos> Coady said she was close to a CASTOR cure.<eos> She's lying.<eos> Ira, she was never close.<eos> The best mind for your cure is locked up in the basement.<eos> Cosima.
Krystal, you still there?<eos> I'm peeing and then I'm gonna kick him in the balls.<eos> No, you will not kick him in the balls.<eos> Okay, we've got some news from Scott.<eos> Brie is gonna be fine.<eos> But when you guys were at the party at Len's house, she stole some face cream.<eos> Oh, my God. She's such a klepto.<eos> Scott thinks it might be experimental.<eos> There should be some left in her floral make-up bag.<eos> Which one?

- No. Cops have picked him up.<eos> They're taking him to district right now.<eos> - Yeah! - Thank you, Chicago's finest.<eos> Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,<eos> - structure fire...<eos> - Let's go!<eos> 257 West Houston.<eos> There's no fire, just smoke, Chief.<eos> Must be in the walls.<eos> Probably electrical.
You think he threw the game?<eos> That was crazy, man.<eos> Jace rundle's never missed a shot like that.<eos> There was over $200 million in bets. Riding on the championship, And when team dv8 lost, so did millions of fans.<eos> But that was just the first of many shocking twists.<eos> I've got nothing else to say.<eos> Jace rundle threw the game intentionally.<eos> There's no other explanation.<eos> I've suspended him from the team.<eos> No more questions.
From the crappy one-bedroom. Row house with six people inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> I'm still gonna win.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Yipped it.<eos> Jace?<eos> For some people, winning is an addiction, It's physiological, it's in their blood.<eos> And for other people?
Abigail was right.<eos> We had no shot with arlo on the jury... But if she'd trusted me, We would've avoided connie, too.<eos> Trust has to be earned, I guess.<eos> Connie's looking at me. Like I'm stuck on the bottom of her shoe.<eos> Well, then... It's a good thing we love challenges, isn't it?<eos> Hey, I like the scruff.<eos> Things have changed since you graduated. From being a field agent.<eos> I guess you can do what you want, Now that you're the big sac.<eos> I prefer...<eos> Special agent in charge.
He's my best friend.<eos> Can you tell us what happened. During the championship game?<eos> He made a mistake.<eos> It happens to all of us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Had you ever witnessed. Jace make a mistake before that night?<eos> Yeah, a-a few.<eos> Five, a hundred, a thousand?<eos> Closer to five.
Had you ever witnessed. Jace make a mistake before that night?<eos> Yeah, a-a few.<eos> Five, a hundred, a thousand?<eos> Closer to five.<eos> You don't get to be world number one. By making a lot of mistakes.<eos> And how many mistakes did he make during the finals?<eos> He-he made a few.<eos> A few?<eos> Five, a hundred...<eos> Closer to five.
Objection!<eos> Did you profit from it, vin?<eos> Did you have something to do. With the loss?<eos> Objection, your honor!<eos> Withdrawn, your honor.<eos> $73,000 is more than I've ever made. Doing a real job.<eos> Time to show connie. Who hates small animals.<eos> You made a lot more than $73,000 last year, didn't you, vin?<eos> You made somewhere in the neighborhood.<eos> Of $8 million.
I was just thinking.<eos> I started playing when I was four.<eos> That's 84% of my life.<eos> 100% when you consider I don't remember anything before then.<eos> I've got nothing else.<eos> What'd the neurologist say?<eos> I...<eos> Have parkinson's.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Parkinson's?
(SPEAKS GEONOSIAN) I wonder how deep this goes. (CHOPPER GRUNTING)<eos> According to Chopper, not much further down.<eos> And he's picking up something on his scanner.<eos> (SPEAKING GEONOSIAN) I say we check it out.<eos> Every second we spend down here seals our fate.<eos> We've come this far.<eos> If Klik-Klak thinks this is the way to go, I want to see why.<eos> Over here.<eos> Those canisters.<eos> Imperial weapons division.
If Monday's House vote goes your way, - and you win the presidency...<eos> - Oh, I'll win, believe me.<eos> You think this vote will be the charm?<eos> See, Congress is no different than the rest of the country.<eos> People are sick and tired of all this confusion and chaos.<eos> The public is not happy.<eos> If you become president, would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?<eos> Not if she wants what's best for the country.<eos> But given the Twelfth Amendment, would you have a choice?<eos> Uh, no further questions, everybody.
What about Lisa Williams?<eos> I saw you talking.<eos> I thought she might be a lead worth pursuing.<eos> She's not.<eos> She's using what she read in the paper to get attention or a little cash.<eos> I did some digging.<eos> She and Rachel Posner... both went to a church called the Fellowship.<eos> - Rachel disappeared...<eos> - Stop.<eos> No more conspiracy theories about dead girls.
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.<eos> We expected you to come in here with a plan.<eos> And I do have a plan.<eos> Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan.<eos> - Let's be clear... - That kind of talk we've heard before.<eos> - I'm a Republican.<eos> - Oh, here we go.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> Look, I want to help you help yourselves.<eos> Unbelievable.
Underwood in office can cause damage.<eos> Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.<eos> I want this election to be between me and Francis Underwood.<eos> Well, it isn't up to you.<eos> Speaker McCarthy isn't letting this particular bill to the floor, unless we have an amendment attached that removes Claire Underwood.<eos> Now, if you expect a willing partner in the White House, you'd better let that bill get to the floor as is.<eos> If you get to the Oval, Will, you're gonna need the Speaker more than she needs you.<eos> So, I'm gonna call her back, and you are going to apologize.<eos> Will, get back here!<eos> Enough.
Well, we're dividing and conquering.<eos> This Chinese trade agreement is going to make Ohio voters very happy.<eos> It could help us win.<eos> - I didn't know the deal had closed.<eos> - Well, we're on the verge.<eos> The president can make the announcement in Canton when he appears.<eos> Oh, no, I'll be announcing myself... since I did the deal.<eos> Doug, you are very sincere...<eos> - and very loyal to Francis.<eos> - And loyal to you, ma'am.
It's harder to disappear than you would think.<eos> But Rachel... is nowhere.<eos> I recognize that neck.<eos> Frank Underwood, as I live and breathe.<eos> Well, I owe you this.<eos> He didn't expect you to show up.<eos> I'm always happy to see old friends.<eos> And make new ones. Frank Underwood.<eos> - Benjamin Grant.<eos> - Oh, of Pollyhop. Of course.
So let me suggest something.<eos> Fuck Ohio.<eos> This is the campaign.<eos> The general is a traitor, you know that.<eos> The general is trying to be a politician.<eos> You would have done the same.<eos> Yeah, but better.<eos> President Underwood?<eos> President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're needed in the Situation Room.<eos> Cathy.
Social media is a powerful tool.<eos> If there is any rescue attempt by the United States, I will tell the people of Ohio exactly how you look to them. Exactly how you disrupted their state's vote.<eos> And they will believe me.<eos> Oppenheimer was a member.<eos> That tree right over there, right under that tree, Manhattan Project was born.<eos> And right under this one, I'm relieving myself.<eos> I hope you're not equating me to the atom bomb.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Cabinet position?<eos> - Frank Underwood... - Judicial appointments?
Yes, it is.<eos> There's an American on the boat.<eos> The Russian research vessel.<eos> - And how do you know that?<eos> - Mr. Xu told me before you came in.<eos> I will need proof of that fact.<eos> Of course, but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him.<eos> And China is willing to help in any way we can.<eos> I'm just curious, Mr. Xu, why are you so focused on this situation?<eos> For humanitarian reasons.
Aidan Macallan.<eos> He'll talk to you. He respects you.<eos> Tell him that I'm okay.<eos> That I'm going to be okay.<eos> I'm a firm believer in boots on the ground.<eos> Well, we're there for the oil. Let's not pretend.<eos> Oh, I'm not denying how crucial it is to protect the oil supply.<eos> But it's in the world's best interest that we're the ones keeping an eye on it.<eos> -On the world or the oil?<eos> -Both.
-Both.<eos> Well, that explains your strong interest in Antarctica.<eos> I do focus on things and people.<eos> I tend to get attached, but I think it makes me better at what I do.<eos> And what are you focused on now?<eos> Petrov. Ahmed Al Ahmadi. To begin with.<eos> Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I'll run this by you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, tomorrow.
You'll be right in the president's line of vision when he... says what you want to hear.<eos> Please. I can be anywhere.<eos> Okay.<eos> -Thank you, Mark.<eos> -Sure.<eos> I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...<eos> I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...<eos> That I will faithfully execute...<eos> That I will faithfully execute...<eos> The office of President of the United States.
ICO wants to see Ahmadi walking out of Damascus in one piece.<eos> If we strike, they will hit back.<eos> Evacuation procedures need to be initiated--<eos> -Just hold on!<eos> -No, the public is our priority-- Hold on!<eos> I want to know how close we are to a strike and where this goddamn truck is before we make any final decisions.<eos> -"We make any decisions"?<eos> -Yes, I am still in a position to make--<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are not in a position--<eos> Nora.
-No, the public is our priority-- Hold on!<eos> I want to know how close we are to a strike and where this goddamn truck is before we make any final decisions.<eos> -"We make any decisions"?<eos> -Yes, I am still in a position to make--<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are not in a position--<eos> Nora.<eos> The enemy isn't in here.<eos> Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.<eos> But it's the general who's on my mind.<eos> Miss Cafferty.
Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.<eos> But it's the general who's on my mind.<eos> Miss Cafferty.<eos> I was entirely out of line.<eos> Please accept my apology.<eos> I spoke with Davis.<eos> -And?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> She was just flexing.<eos> Cathy.
They were very close, if you know what I mean.<eos> But they were sweet.<eos> And did you ever see... this man?<eos> Look, I don't know what was going on here.<eos> But you recognize him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay? Someone looking like him paid the rent. Three months, up-front.<eos> But like I said, I don't judge.<eos> I'm not sure what you're asking, Mr. President.<eos> Oh, please.
- That I go on being presidential.<eos> That's the only way that I can deal with this.<eos> It's my first 100 days, for God's sake.<eos> Francis... we're going to get our hands on Ahmadi.<eos> There aren't enough Ahmadis in the world. Not for all we've done.<eos> Then what?<eos> Destroy Romero, for one.<eos> Can we at least take care of that?<eos> And then who?<eos> The rest of the Democratic Party?
- See how easy that is?<eos> - Get out!<eos> You're gonna be all alone at your hearing.<eos> I just left Walker.<eos> He's gonna plead the Fifth.<eos> You'll look like a fool.<eos> You want to be out front?<eos> No one has a problem with that.<eos> They want you there, because you'll be the first to fall.<eos> "For the good of the party."
Forget it.<eos> - Hey, hang on a second. - Hey.<eos> I need to tell you how I'm feeling.<eos> The nation needs you, Mr. President.<eos> - We all need you.<eos> - We're done for today.<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> Why don't you want to hear what I'm trying to tell you? Listen.<eos> You... enough.
Why don't you want to hear what I'm trying to tell you? Listen.<eos> You... enough.<eos> I love you. You need to know that.<eos> - I'm only here to protect you.<eos> - You need to calm down.<eos> What's wrong with you? Why don't you wanna hear<eos> - what I'm telling you? - There is nothing wrong with me.<eos> But you need to go home.<eos> You reached out to me. You brought me in. I...<eos> Enough.
But it's getting harder and harder to get off this ship.<eos> Where is my wife?<eos> Where has she gone?<eos> If she was your wife, wouldn't you wonder?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> This never happened.<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> - Doug.<eos> - Shit.
- I understand.<eos> I need you to create additional documents that justify going after Kalabi.<eos> A paper trail that will support our actions that we took on Election Day in Tennessee.<eos> I'm not sure... what those documents would be.<eos> Well, but you're smart, Cathy, aren't you?<eos> I mean, you can figure it out.<eos> Why don't you just show me how smart you are.<eos> - Of course, Mr. President.<eos> - And the presentation at the UN.<eos> - With Syria?
Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir, are somehow involved with the death of Zoe Barnes.<eos> And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone that was given to Ms. Barnes.<eos> It called only one number, and that number was yours.<eos> Now, it seems that number has shown up on the phone that she died with.<eos> It was damaged, but there's technology now that will give them access to the data leading up to the day of her death.<eos> Its internal memory.<eos> Calls, texts.<eos> It's all there.<eos> When did you start with us?<eos> A week ago.
Some nights, I go to a hotel to sleep, just to get out of my apartment.<eos> Being a woman in this city, the vigilance it takes...<eos> You're not allowed to make a mistake... get distracted.<eos> It's a heavy price.<eos> To be on the edge that way for years and years...<eos> My testimony won't disappoint.<eos> Well, the president and vice president are pleased, I assume.<eos> But how long before the media starts asking questions about Macallan's death, and how he was killed?<eos> I have your gun, by the way.<eos> -Good night.
Yes.<eos> He's an unlucky person.<eos> Always has been.<eos> - Sir, the senator's support is wavering.<eos> - Doug, it's Claire.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> Francis and I were wondering if you could come up to the residence tomorrow evening. For dinner.<eos> It'll give us a chance to take a breath with all that's been happening.<eos> Hello?<eos> Happy birthday.
There's 100 of 'em. All we need is half.<eos> Can I just lay down?<eos> -I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> -Just for a few minutes.<eos> I'm just so fucking tired, and I need to think.<eos> Why do you need to think?<eos> The longer you hang on to whatever he gave you, the more danger you're in.<eos> You're reading this wrong.<eos> You think it's some kind of insurance, but it's not.<eos> LeAnn...
A real knock down.<eos> I told Francis I heard the yelling, but not the words.<eos> But... you said you were murderers.<eos> He said you were survivors.<eos> I was dreading coming here.<eos> -Why?<eos> -You can't publish it, Tom.<eos> I'd rather not.<eos> So, what?<eos> Money?
- Okay, fine. - I just need you--<eos> Was he collecting data?<eos> Yes. Did he cross a line?<eos> Most likely.<eos> I did visit with him, checking in on his work.<eos> Have you seen a screen of code?<eos> Computer code.<eos> It's indecipherable.<eos> Why did Seth Grayson end up not testifying?<eos> No comment.
Not any longer.<eos> I just wanted to thank you for... your tenacity.<eos> Whatever you're up to, you won't get away with it.<eos> Maybe I already have.<eos> The committee will continue its work. We'll recommend charges to DOJ.<eos> Rochelle.<eos> Rochelle.<eos> Such a lovely name.<eos> Tell me how much you don't want that to end up in the press. And then shut this committee down.<eos> No deals.
I'm not sure we should wait on this, Madam President.<eos> I'd like to remind you that it was this administration that introduced the ultimatum.<eos> - You should act on it.<eos> - Yes, but I barely have a team in place.<eos> Well, you can run it by the former president...<eos> The former president is just that.<eos> - An opportunity has presented itself.<eos> - And I'm trying to take advantage of it.<eos> - Is everyone in the Situation Room?<eos> - As of 20 minutes ago.
This morning I started driving. I... I got scared.<eos> Anyway, I'm on my way back.<eos> Can I come see you?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie to know how it ends.<eos> The speech is gonna play well with both parties.<eos> Where are we with the Republicans?<eos> Trading names when it comes to your cabinet.<eos> We have our generals, which is good.<eos> Some corporate types, outsiders.
Yes, please.<eos> Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie to know how it ends.<eos> The speech is gonna play well with both parties.<eos> Where are we with the Republicans?<eos> Trading names when it comes to your cabinet.<eos> We have our generals, which is good.<eos> Some corporate types, outsiders.<eos> Make you seem like a renegade.<eos> Corporate, from where?<eos> Oil, banking, mostly. Some tech.
Yeah, you and Special Agent McGee were sent to New Orleans to recover stolen Intel, yes?<eos> Yes. It's called the Playbook.<eos> It's a collection of scenarios for viable terrorist attacks against the U.S.<eos> Stolen from Homeland Security.<eos> I... That much I know.<eos> What I don't know is why you ran an operation without checking in first.<eos> Tracking down a former contact of my undercover days.<eos> That would be the murder victim.<eos> Ferdinand Pisco.<eos> Venezuelan operative.
Day drinking is step one.<eos> I-I am not day drinking.<eos> Someone forced this into my hand.<eos> Yeah, if you say so, glitter boo.<eos> I do, uh, come bearing gifts, however.<eos> Can I use your computer?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Been tracking the digital trail of whoever stole the Playbook in the first place.<eos> They've been making some moves the last couple days. Yeah?<eos> What kind of moves?
But, uh, this is.<eos> Oh.<eos> Let me show you this. All you need to do is enter the serial numbers.<eos> Whoa, this is, this is amazing.<eos> There's no way that this is, uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.<eos> No, no, no. Rigid tracking's no good.<eos> Satellite phones are always on the move, so this is a geosynchronous step track processing, with a little bit of pizzazz on the side.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, makes total sense.<eos> To who?
No problem.<eos> Okay. Kind of wish we didn't park so far away. Come on.<eos> ♪ And turn up the dial... ♪ It's packed in here.<eos> Easier for us to stay hidden.<eos> But too crowded if there's a problem.<eos> I should be in there with you.<eos> Stay where you are, Torres.<eos> You're our backup, in case things go south.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> For you, miss lady.
Good.<eos> Eva Azarova?<eos> I thought we put her away last year for espionage.<eos> Yeah. Guess she escaped, somehow got the Playbook.<eos> Now she's trying to sell it.<eos> Gregorio's made contact.<eos> Well, hopefully, she gets the Playbook back before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> Yeah. Meanwhile, we've got two out of the three foreign buyers in custody.<eos> Though ours isn't talking.<eos> Yeah, North Korean operative.
Here we are again, Eva.<eos> Yup.<eos> You're accusing me of crimes I didn't commit.<eos> But you did commit a crime.<eos> You stole the Playbook from Homeland.<eos> Sell to the highest bidder.<eos> Never pegged you as an opportunist.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was using it as bait to draw Victor out.<eos> Your mentor.
How cold do you think I am?<eos> Didn't I just say it's not you?<eos> - Isn't it, though?<eos> - What? "Old people die, get over it"?<eos> That was, like, 20 minutes ago.<eos> - Okay, now, hang on a second. - Okay, this seems like a whole thing, so I'm just gonna go grab a water real quick.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> - Who are you texting?<eos> - Ahh! No one. I'm just reading my horoscope.<eos> Liar.
Don't worry, Phil.<eos> We ate.<eos> Pit boss sent some shrimp cocktails over to our craps table.<eos> Along with some regular cocktails, am I right?<eos> You... you had to be there.<eos> I get it.<eos> You had shrimp and drinks.<eos> Now, if it's not too much trouble, maybe we could get back on schedule.<eos> We don't want to miss Sedaka's opening act...<eos> Extremely Little Richard.
*MODERN FAMILY* Season 08 Episode 16 "Basketball"<eos> I spilled juice on the rug.<eos> Please don't tell Mama.<eos> Don't tell Mama?<eos> What about, "Don't tell Papa?"<eos> A boy is supposed to fear his father.<eos> I shook in my boots around my old man, just like he did around his.<eos> To this day, I hear the crack of a Schlitz or smell some Singleton's Beard Tonic, and I'm sweating like a mob rat in Little Italy.<eos> Oh, I tripped!<eos> Enough!

I once tried to start my own uncle-niece tradition, but...<eos> I'm not questioning the methodology behind accelerated mass spectrometry.<eos> I'm merely pointing out that it's not singular in its power to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass.<eos> What's going on with you and that handsome weatherman?<eos> - Things are great, mostly. Yeah. - Mm!<eos> Oh. "Mostly"?<eos> Well, what's... what's going on?<eos> I mean, do you think it's okay... for your partner to ask you to do... anything?<eos> Mm, no.<eos> Not anything anything.
Thank you.<eos> That's all she got out... "c..." And then Rainer walked in.<eos> Well, we have to find out.<eos> As her uncles, we need all the information we can so we can advise her properly.<eos> Yeah. She's dating an older man.<eos> If she's uncomfortable, it's our duty to protect her.<eos> Okay. So we said all that.<eos> - What could be "c..." be? - Hmm?<eos> - Carrot? - Mnh-mnh.<eos> Cupping?
- Oh, um... - 10?<eos> You can't even get a Foam Flipper with that.<eos> - Let's make it 50.<eos> - D.J., please.<eos> How bout 50 real ones? Okay.<eos> Make it five grand.<eos> That's the jump?<eos> - Go win this for me.<eos> - Okay. We're on the same team!<eos> Foul!
Tear my head off.<eos> Tell me how I've disappointed you yet again.<eos> And what is happening?<eos> All day long I've been trying to get Joe to fear me.<eos> Maybe that's not the best thing for kids.<eos> - Hi. - Well, I made six Dolphin Dollars plus 20 real ones from some weirdo who wanted me to ladle cheese straight into his mouth.<eos> All right, papi, thank you so much, but I still need help attracting customers over there.<eos> Oh, I can see if Phil has that thing in his car that flails around like this.<eos> Claire?<eos> - No, his Tube Dude. - Oh.
- You should.<eos> That was my son and his wife.<eos> And if you are Adam Gordon, those were your parents.<eos> Do you recognize them?<eos> Perhaps I shouldn't be here after all.<eos> If you are Adam, you grew up here.<eos> Are you familiar with this house?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Why must you torture my grandmother like this?<eos> Oh, right. Because of this.
This could be it.<eos> George, maybe this isn't the right place.<eos> Or it could be a prank.<eos> Our family has had more than our fair share.<eos> Sir.<eos> It may not be a prank.<eos> Bones.<eos> Small but human.<eos> A button with an anchor.<eos> Possibly from a sailor's outfit.
They said I was rescued from dire circumstances.<eos> Nothing more than that?<eos> Occasionally, they would refer to me as a little prince.<eos> Anything?<eos> I've shown her likeness at every church in the area.<eos> - And?<eos> - Toronto has a lot of churches.<eos> More than 170.<eos> And you found nothing?<eos> No, sir.
No, Mrs. Bergman, I expect you to be an honest citizen.<eos> And one who would do the right thing.<eos> Is everything all right, Mother?<eos> It's all right.<eos> This policeman was just asking about your uncle.<eos> Sir, if you have any business with my family,<eos> - talk to me.<eos> - Certainly.<eos> The train from Chatham, you say?<eos> Good day.
He said he was an uncle.<eos> You just let him take the remains?<eos> I didn't let him do anything.<eos> I wasn't in the employ of this institution at the time.<eos> Do you have the name of the man who said he was the boy's uncle?<eos> Are you quite sure?<eos> Mrs. Waters' records from the St. Jude Orphanage confirm it.<eos> Irving Moses was a squatter on land near the Gordon Estate.<eos> Around the time of the abduction, someone saw a man burying something close to where we found the boy's body.<eos> Johnny Scott.
- It is suspicious.<eos> But I have yet to find any proof that he isn't Adam Gordon.<eos> - And what about the dead boy you found?<eos> - A pauper.<eos> And definitely not the young Adam Gordon.<eos> My regret is that we missed so much time together.<eos> All of us.<eos> Adam, Jonah, myself.<eos> I hope that the remaining years will be happy ones.<eos> Help!
My regret is that we missed so much time together.<eos> All of us.<eos> Adam, Jonah, myself.<eos> I hope that the remaining years will be happy ones.<eos> Help!<eos> What was that?<eos> Oh no!<eos> Julia!<eos> Jonah. You shot him?<eos> Your own brother?
You're a right piece of work aren't you?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I'm the bad one?<eos> You hired someone to kill your brother.<eos> - Just shut up.<eos> Shut up! - I'll leave you two to chat.<eos> It seems you have a great deal in common.<eos> You're a monster, aren't you?<eos> So are you.<eos> Your own brother?
So I see.<eos> Detective Watts has been on the hunt for a number of missing women.<eos> Some of them have been gone a considerable amount of time.<eos> - I'm sorry I can't help you.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> It means the people I am searching for may still be alive.<eos> Youth and optimism.<eos> It's a delightful combination, Detective Watts.<eos> Uh, though not helpful in this instance.<eos> Good day.
I have a better idea, Anne.<eos> We work on the soil research and leave the constables to tramp around the land.<eos> Sorry to desert you.<eos> Shall we, Constable?<eos> Yes, we shall.<eos> All this area north of the city would have been settled by farmers in the 1840's.<eos> As the city began to encroach in the last decade, developers started to buy up the land including, I expect, our Mr. Dawson.<eos> From everything I hear, sir, he seems a slippery fish, always hiding behind his lawyer.<eos> Hm... How long did he own the land?<eos> Three years.
That would've been just after I got out of the sanitarium.<eos> That was two years ago.<eos> Maybe longer.<eos> Did you not suspect anything?<eos> Pff... His business, not mine.<eos> Whoever thinks a neighbour is burying bodies?<eos> That's Frank and Barry.<eos> They're good lads.<eos> They help me keep the place going now.<eos> - Out of the way!

Judging by your demeanor... maybe I should have brought him along.<eos> You owned the property for three years, yet you never built on it.<eos> The city's moving north;<eos> I thought it was a good investment.<eos> Land prices haven't increased significantly, so why sell?<eos> To be truthful, my vision tends to exceed my business acumen.<eos> Is this why I'm here?<eos> We're investigating three murders.<eos> Three bodies were buried on that land.<eos> Bodies?
They set up house in the north part of the county and just decided it was their own personal fiefdom.<eos> - Any arrest record?<eos> - Plenty of arrests, sir.<eos> Robbery, intimidation, suspected in a number of violent homicides, but no jail time until recently.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Well, two and half years ago,<eos> William and his two sons, Patrick and Daniel, were finally sentenced for illegal liquor running.<eos> They're all locked up in Kingston Penitentiary now.<eos> Well, it seems we may have found our murderers.<eos> - Off to Kingston, then.
You were the warden at Kingston Penitentiary when William, Patrick, and Daniel Hobbins were sent there.<eos> Yet, there's no record of them whatsoever.<eos> You were the only person who had access to those records.<eos> - You made a deal to let them go.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> I had as little to do with them as I could.<eos> Then who did you take money from?<eos> Money?<eos> How dare you sugg... I wouldn't take a penny from that poor man.<eos> From who?

Let me finish.<eos> It's like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don't want in a man.<eos> Well, that's hard to hear, but I'll still take you back.<eos> You know, the same thing happened to me.<eos> After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who's just amazing.<eos> Sorry, is that "Gary" with one R or two?<eos> Would you stop writing? !<eos> Just wait. So... did all of you go on to better relationships after me?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Without question.
I love your bag... outfit.<eos> Yes, well, safety first, you know?<eos> And that's always in fashion.<eos> Yeah. Yes.<eos> So... interesting times.<eos> How's Benjamin?<eos> He's good.<eos> We made love this morning.<eos> With all the bells and whistles.<eos> And, Robert?
Well, well, well. If it isn't news anchor Lester Holt.<eos> Yum, yum.<eos> Happy Halloween, Jeremy!<eos> What do we have over here?<eos> Well, it's been a tough year.<eos> But we made it through.<eos> Without you, I'm afraid...<eos> I'm afraid I might have given up.<eos> So thank you.<eos> And Merry Christmas.
Milk!<eos> Damn it, Jeremy!<eos> You're not even trying!<eos> Do you even want this?<eos> Just say it!<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> Beach. Mountain.<eos> Desert. City.<eos> Farm.<eos> Antiques.
Pot!<eos> That's what I'm missin'.<eos> How great is it that Josh is giving us the night off early?<eos> - Why do you think he's doing that?<eos> Girl, let it go. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.<eos> You tell her, Seabiscuit.<eos> Um... who are you and why are you going here?<eos> Uh... this is the penthouse, right?<eos> I'm going to...<eos> - Josh Kaminski's?
- That is horrible!<eos> - Tragic!<eos> All right, now where is Kiki?<eos> Uhh... uhh... say, Gabi, where is Kiki? Oh...<eos> look! Here she is.<eos> Oh, Kiki, time to go.<eos> Oh, look...<eos> look at that, she's following me, that's so cute.<eos> - Come here, Kiki, come here, Kiki...<eos> - Kiki, now!
- Don't show up early. - Or we'll look like losers.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So what do we do while we wait?<eos> Beyonce-tinis!<eos> - A-ha! - Atta girls!<eos> Did you find Kiki?<eos> Tell me you found Kiki.<eos> I found her. I found her.<eos> A whole Kiki, or in Kiki pieces?<eos> Whole Kiki.
I can explain...<eos> Lieutenant Tamsin Dale, you are under arrest per Article 134 for violation of Section 793 of the Espionage Act.<eos> You looking for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> A possible client.<eos> Army Lieutenant Tamsin Dale, facing 111 years in prison.<eos> Charged four times under the Espionage Act.<eos> Espionage?<eos> Whoa.<eos> For who?
You looking for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> A possible client.<eos> Army Lieutenant Tamsin Dale, facing 111 years in prison.<eos> Charged four times under the Espionage Act.<eos> Espionage?<eos> Whoa.<eos> For who?<eos> Russia, China?<eos> Nobody.

For every civilian we kill, we make 40 enemies.<eos> So, part of every mission is try hard not to kill them.<eos> But the colonel's collateral damage stats were 30% higher than his peers.<eos> Unless he was stopped, it was going to happen again.<eos> You're a lieutenant and you get to decide this?<eos> I went through the chain of command.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> And the colonel continued his reckless engagements.<eos> So, I went to my ultimate boss.<eos> The American people?
I can feel it.<eos> For Lieutenant Dale's case, we have a few new rules.<eos> Like... no hacking.<eos> Just send me home, why don't you?<eos> We will be profiling the jury, just like always, but this is a national security case.<eos> Take it from me, certain people will be watching everything we do.<eos> But you're saying there's no hacking.<eos> Okay, just think of it as an adventure.<eos> Like... a camping trip, in nature, no electricity.<eos> - Or toilets.
Wait, who stole my string cheese?<eos> Here.<eos> Better for you.<eos> Worst of all, we only get to boot one juror out in voir dire.<eos> Ouch.<eos> Jury selection is the key to trial.<eos> - It's our forte.<eos> - Yes, it is, which is why I have a new strategy.<eos> If we only get one strike, we have to avoid the nuclear juror.<eos> - Nuclear.

Did GlobeSpill do anything illegal?<eos> Has GlobeSpill reported false information?<eos> Really?<eos> Does the false information relate to Tamsin's... leaked memo?<eos> Does the false information relate to the Ranger attack?<eos> Has GlobeSpill reported false information?<eos> Really?<eos> Tamsin didn't betray those Rangers.<eos> GlobeSpill did.<eos> GlobeSpill?
Ten if she's lucky.<eos> It's up to the jury now.<eos> Tell Danny I need everything she's got on Colonel Abernathy Jackson.<eos> Can I help you, Dr. Bull?<eos> There was this officer in 2006.<eos> Deployed with the 141st Infantry Brigade in Kabul.<eos> Forward operating base, lots of civilian contact.<eos> The unit came under fire, and a private left behind some ordnance.<eos> Kids were known to play in the area, so this officer... went back for it.<eos> Without permission.
I see you've already painted it.<eos> Cam, it... it's back on your shoulder!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You are good.<eos> Cam, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.<eos> If we're gonna have any chance of getting to Dallas and then surviving there, we are going to need hats.<eos> Hats. Hats.<eos> Excuse me, sir, sir, sir, sir, are you the proprietor of this haberdashery?<eos> Can you point me in the direction of your finest sports caps?<eos> What team?
Gay...<eos> I'm not sure why that's relevant.<eos> I'll just... Hey, I have a question for you.<eos> When you're outside the workplace, do you wear hats?<eos> Or does that just kind of make you feel like you're always in the office?<eos> Oh, you know what, I think I am going to get these.<eos> No, Mitchell, we can't...<eos> Oh, look, little girls' hats.<eos> Ooh. We should get one for Linda.<eos> - Who?
You're drinking?<eos> Wine helps me sleep sometimes.<eos> You know, I really wish you guys had called.<eos> I'm so busy with school stuff right now, and this place is a mess.<eos> Aww, there you are.<eos> - You got a cat?<eos> - It's not mine.<eos> You stole a cat?<eos> Just like Neve Campbell<eos> - in "From Yale to Jail."
Wrong cord!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Geez, it seems like Joe's crib's damaged beyond repair!<eos> No, no, it's fine.<eos> It just Froggered across the street.<eos> Leave it there.<eos> The garbage man is coming tomorrow.<eos> And you're fine with that?<eos> You're attached to everything related to that kid.<eos> Yeah, but not to that stupid crib.
Sorry. Habit.<eos> I'm not actually doing anything wrong.<eos> Just checking to see if I got into A.S.U.<eos> Without us?
In here.<eos> I want to make sure I get this.<eos> - I want to see everything.<eos> - Okay, I got it.<eos> I didn't quite grasp what I was asking Phil to do, but, um... it got weird.<eos> Okay. All right. Whenever you're ready.<eos> Wait, th-this isn't going on the Internet, is it?<eos> No, it's just for me.<eos> The challenge with this escape is, uh, releasing the shackles in the correct order baring yourself gradually.<eos> Okay, more upbeat.
I had my nap and I came by for an afternoon claw.<eos> I don't have a lot going on right now.<eos> I think it's this one.<eos> Hey, guys, why don't we just call roadside assistance?<eos> I'm sure they'll send somebody.<eos> If today is all about girl power, why can't we just fix it ourselves?<eos> I knew we shouldn't have brought her.<eos> It's funny... we've only been volunteering here<eos> - at the women's march for an hour...<eos> - Five minutes.
You're not here to socialize, so just get 'em in, get 'em out.<eos> Are you asking me not to talk to people?<eos> 'Cause that is what I do.<eos> And Phil don't seem to have a problem with it.<eos> No, but I do.<eos> Well, to quote Sammy Davis Jr.,<eos> "I got to be me."<eos> Well, to quote Frank Sinatra, who I met once at a restaurant,<eos> "Get out of my booth."<eos> Fine... with me.
This is just vu!<eos> In hindsight, I should have pulled my head out before I nailed the post back in.<eos> Buddy...<eos> - Live and learn.<eos> - If only you ever did.<eos> Okay. I think I may have gone too deep this time.<eos> Sweet Caligula, that's a lot of blood.<eos> Why would Dylan change his phone number?<eos> Do you know how long it took him to memorize the last one?<eos> ! Both sides now?
Literally my favorite fish dish.<eos> Would you recommend that over the steak?<eos> Hey, I was kind of in the middle of my own thing here.<eos> Would you recommend it over the steak?<eos> - They're both great.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Steak.<eos> Stick with the plan.<eos> And I'll have a glass of the Merryvale Cab.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I got the idea... - when I was in a parking garage.<eos> - Uh-huh. - You know those little lights...<eos> - Oh, God, Dad. No, don't look. - Don't look.<eos> - What are they doing here?<eos> They're not gonna want to have brunch with us, are they?<eos> They can't!<eos> This is our day!<eos> - You think they see us?<eos> - Hmm. Just keep walking.<eos> No sudden movements.
Any way to save it?<eos> Yeah. A miracle.<eos> Or a mechanical genius with an IQ of 160.<eos> Have Patton send me the rig blueprints and get me patched in out there. I'm gonna be on a computer in two shakes.<eos> Damn it, Lund!<eos> You just can't help yourself, can you?<eos> It's an emergency!<eos> I don't care!<eos> You want a badge, you belong to me.<eos> No emergencies, no exceptions.
Bottom line, is he doesn't need to know anything about today.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - There he is! Hey, good to see you in one piece.<eos> You are in one piece?<eos> Oh, yeah, it's just a flesh wound.<eos> Could've been a lot worse if it hadn't been for you all.<eos> You did a good job without me.<eos> Oh, yeah.
Yeah.<eos> I can see that.<eos> - You like drawing, Jordan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He applied to City Arts.<eos> Well, thank you, Jordan.<eos> I see you have a spokesperson.<eos> And I'm sure your husband is not thrilled with your new career.<eos> This has been really hard on everybody.<eos> On both of our families.
What does that mean exactly?<eos> It means the apparent reason for something often isn't the reason for it at all.<eos> Some might assume that you quit football because you were afraid to come out.<eos> Must have been hard for your family.<eos> My parents took it about as well as Jordan's did.<eos> They sacrificed everything for me to achieve that dream.<eos> It meant everything to them.<eos> And then when the draft approached, I realized I needed something else.<eos> Something more.<eos> Something for me.
- to William and Donna?<eos> - Our mock jury showed that parents had little empathy for other parents.<eos> They all thought that they could do a better job.<eos> So, the best jurors for us have been grandparents?<eos> They know they made mistakes with their own kids.<eos> That's why they love grandchildren.<eos> It's their chance to get it right.<eos> So, anyone else to look for?<eos> People who like structure.<eos> Rigid schedule keepers.
Check his mother's address.<eos> If it's the same as his, we're in business.<eos> We're in business.<eos> Come on, Wendy.<eos> Make the right choice.<eos> Acceptable, Your Honor.<eos> Ms. Davis, you may now pose your questions.<eos> We have no questions, Your Honor.<eos> We accept this juror.<eos> No questions?
- she'd be great.<eos> - Hey, we're dodging a bullet.<eos> She won't get the long-term damage Susan has caused Jordan.<eos> We move to strike,<eos> Your Honor.<eos> More sprinkles for us.<eos> Okay, speed round.<eos> Dennis... ponytail, T-shirt, lack of eye contact.<eos> He's never created a folder in his inbox, and he's never used a calendar app on his smart phone.<eos> No structure.
Not Ed, not Eddie.<eos> This is Edward.<eos> Ooh, he sings in the church choir.<eos> Straight and narrow.<eos> Sing us your song, Edward.<eos> And Mr. Virtuous is in.<eos> Okay, next up...<eos> Noreen.<eos> Retired school teacher.<eos> Second grade.
Objection.<eos> She's attempting to inflame the jury.<eos> Under many states' laws, Mrs. Bryant would be considered a sexual predator.<eos> Dr. Strand used the word "pedophile."<eos> And I corrected to the word<eos> - "predator."<eos> - Your Honor, we ask that these statements be stricken.<eos> Sustained.<eos> I ask that the jurors ignore Dr. Strand's comparing Mrs. Bryant<eos> - to a pedophile.
Right where we want 'em.<eos> - I love a surprise party.<eos> - Mrs. Bryant, you said you didn't become sexually involved with Jordan until after he turned 17.<eos> - Three months ago, correct?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then how do you explain the fact that you're four months pregnant?<eos> Does your silence mean you don't remember?<eos> Or does it prove that you had sex with Jordan when he was 16 years old and you are guilty of statutory rape?<eos> Susan needs to be kept far from boys.<eos> And my husband.
Let her go.<eos> You did this.<eos> What did you say to her?<eos> It's what she realized.<eos> She was using you to make herself feel special.<eos> But it never would have been enough.<eos> Teaching wasn't enough.<eos> Her husband wasn't enough.<eos> Nothing... would have ever been enough.<eos> Not for her.
"Scoop someone's urine from Starbucks toilet to pass drug test."<eos> Feels like we should be moving these pieces backwards.<eos> Okay, let's make some noise for Deejay Peter and the Sound Slap!<eos> Giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity!<eos> Give it to 'em.<eos> Shut up, Meg. Sh-Sh-Shut up, Meg.<eos> Butt scratcher!<eos> Butt scratcher!<eos> Peter, Peter, Peter...<eos> Roadhouse.

Well, enjoy your date with your spaghetti.<eos> I'm taking the car and going home.<eos> Okay, Mick, come here. Sit down!<eos> Mick.<eos> Come on. S...<eos> Ah, screw it.<eos> Oh, that's hot! Hot!<eos> Hot!<eos> Oh!<eos> Help!
You okay?<eos> There you go.<eos> Did you have that in your hand the whole time?<eos> A gentleman never abandons his drink.<eos> Teddy Grant.<eos> We're through, Jimbo.<eos> Then he invited me to dinner on his boat.<eos> There's nothing more suspicious than a man who can't live on land.<eos> Well, I'll make do. Jimmy used to live in a car.<eos> Ooh, bum to a pirate.
I could hold off, I could hold off for a minute.<eos> Maybe you should hold off a minute.<eos> - Believe this guy? - Okay, okay.<eos> Hey, can I tell you a secret? Okay.<eos> Here's my secret. Okay.<eos> Normally, I'd be all over this deck, just riding your brains out.<eos> But I like you. I think there's something sweet about you.<eos> And so I want to take it slow.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah. Slow, slow...
That was great!<eos> So great.<eos> I mean, this punch card thing is the best.<eos> Yeah, it's amazing.<eos> We're having sex without feelings.<eos> I mean, I had feelings in my parts, but... not in my hearts.<eos> I gotta be honest with you, Gabi.<eos> I did not think you could handle an all sex non-emotional liaison.<eos> That's funny, because I thought the same thing about you.<eos> Without the big word at the end.
First, I establish myself as a confidant. Then, I subliminally undermine his relationship.<eos> And then finally, when my abuelita's hex starts working... his relationship will burn to the ground.<eos> And I will be there to rise like a phoenix from the ashes.<eos> As his new girlfriend.<eos> Wow, not having sex for a long time makes you a little crazy.<eos> Yeah, well, having sex for a day makes you a little judgy.<eos> All I'm saying is what Josh and I have is working.<eos> Okay? We're getting along great.<eos> We're having sex without all the neediness and the drama.<eos> And the caring and the trust and the intimacy.
And then we just, uh... we put the punch card on hold.<eos> The tell and hold.<eos> That is a genius rule.<eos> How did we not think of that?<eos> I don't know, cute people are dumb.<eos> So... - the punch card is back on?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Back in business, baby.<eos> As long as...<eos> - as long as there are no feelings.<eos> - Nope. None here.
The tell and hold.<eos> That is a genius rule.<eos> How did we not think of that?<eos> I don't know, cute people are dumb.<eos> So... - the punch card is back on?<eos> - Mm-hmm.

We'll ask our friends if they've seen them.<eos> Um, do me a favor and don't tell Jiya about... any of this.<eos> His shoulder's dislocated.<eos> I need him focused.<eos> We need to find something for his pain.<eos> I don't think Vicodin's been invented yet.<eos> Well, people are getting drunk someplace. Improvise.<eos> Get me some absinthe.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The Dingo Bar.
I would. Okay.<eos> I'll take that bet.<eos> It'll be entertaining if nothing else.<eos> You convince him there's a better way, and I'll spare him.<eos> What does that lunatic want with us?<eos> He knows that you're part of Rittenhouse.<eos> - Ritten... what?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm Rittenhouse too.<eos> Part of the... the Cahill family.
Welcome back.<eos> Where's Baumgardner?<eos> Were there any other casualties?<eos> No.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - I don't think so, or no?<eos> No.<eos> Approximately how many people did you interact with in 1927?<eos> I would say about 15...<eos> To 17.
It was raining so hard we couldn't see five feet in front of us.<eos> I stepped in a bed of bamboo vipers.<eos> One of them gets me by the leg.<eos> I grab my K-bar and I cut the damn snake's head off.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Not only that.<eos> Little bastard's been holding up my pants ever since.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Have a round with us, Dad, before we head out on the town.<eos> All right. To wives and sweethearts.
If he wets his khakis when we screen the video for him, he...<eos> Peter Stone?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - We're seeking to enforce a writ of replevin against you and your office.<eos> Nice to meet you, too.<eos> Mary Graziano.<eos> U.S. Department of Justice,<eos> National Security Division.<eos> I haven't heard the words "writ of replevin"<eos> since law school.
Heh. Back to the future, right?<eos> What do you have to take the chill off?<eos> You didn't have to drop by to check on me, Mr. Jefferies.<eos> Mark.<eos> Join me?<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> To better days. Better days.<eos> I had a visitor on Sunday.<eos> Buffed-up Rear Admiral from Annapolis.<eos> For your son?
Previously on iZombie...<eos> Look, what I found in my hate mail.<eos> "If you ever need a sympathetic ear, I've got two.<eos> Shawna."
Here we go, y'all!<eos> Enjoy the show!<eos> There's 100,000 people seeing this live.<eos> Right now!<eos> You didn't order a pizza again, did you?<eos> Go check it out.<eos> - What?<eos> - Go!<eos> Hit him again, bro.<eos> What the hell?
Down! Down! Down!<eos> Get down!<eos> Liv?<eos> It's been a helluva day.<eos> You might tell your friends to quit pointing those guns at me?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
That's what I was told.<eos> We know he had a memory card in his ssession when he died.<eos> There's incriminating footage of some powerful people on it.<eos> I think one of those people killed your father.<eos> Can I just take this stuff and go?<eos> I have to get home.<eos> This was in your dad's wallet.<eos> - Do you know what this is?<eos> - A key?<eos> For a safe deposit box.
Harley's whole redneck persona is a cover.<eos> No way some wacko gun-nut outsmarts an experienced military commander like Chase Graves.<eos> He must've worked in counterintelligence, Black Ops...<eos> Respectfully, Liv, if you're going to find Harley, you have to try to separate the facts from these theories.<eos> You have to try to limit your suspicions.<eos> I know, you're right.<eos> Wait a minute, why are you sleeping in here?<eos> Major's been having a lot of... Company.<eos> And this company happens to be very expressive in the boudoir which now constitutes most of our house.<eos> Shawna?
- Hey. Didn't you say Harley's cabin had been abandoned for months?<eos> Well, that's what Justin told me.<eos> Then why am I looking at a noise complaint about heavy machinery and construction going on at that address eight weeks ago?<eos> - I don't know. But I have a theory...<eos> - I'm sure you do.<eos> Tell me tomorrow, when we head out there.<eos> Good night, Liv.<eos> Let's enjoy this win tonight, because tomorrow, the real work begins.<eos> Yeah, that's a great column.<eos> For your college newspaper.
- All right, dig into it.<eos> Get back to me when you got more.<eos> Scoot.<eos> Oh, nice of you to grace us with your presence.<eos> So, any update on your "wingnuts who believe in zombies" story?<eos> There have been a few developments.<eos> You might want to make some room on the front page.<eos> _<eos> Neighbors a quarter mile away complained about construction noise.<eos> Construction of what?
'Ps - I said love and I meant it.<eos> It's Christmas Eve and I'm so happy.'<eos> *THE ROYALS* Season 03 Episode 06 "More Than Kin and Less Than Kind"<eos> Ho, ho, ho!<eos> - Hell of a run. - Hey.<eos> Didn't see you there.<eos> Little excessive for Christmas Eve, isn't it?<eos> Are you running towards or away from something?<eos> Just running.<eos> Merry Christmas.
They won't miss me and I certainly won't miss them.<eos> - You won't even call them?<eos> - No.<eos> I'd give anything to hear my father's voice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But... your father didn't dress you up as an elf and make you ring a bell to steal Salvation Army Money.<eos> He's still your father.<eos> And I bet you were the cutest little elf.<eos> - Code red.<eos> - For Santa claus?
I was going to tell you about Jasper, but you were just back from the dead and it just didn't seem like the right time.<eos> It's a tangled web we weave, Lenny.<eos> - He said he saw you.<eos> - Yeah, this morning in the family gym.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - That I saw him in the gym.<eos> - You said "family" gym.<eos> - You did say that.<eos> Fine.<eos> Family gym.
I say thank you every day for the fact that you're back and alive and well.<eos> - But I won't apologize, either.<eos> - For what?<eos> For being the person I've become since you left.<eos> See you in the ring.<eos> 'We get up, we move on, we fight.<eos> The time for you to be great is now.<eos> Because you are.<eos> I'm proud of you.'<eos> 'Merry Christmas.'
Yeah, of course.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Two hours.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna put in a request telling criminals that they abandon vehicles in areas that don't require tetanus shots.<eos> Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> It's Lieutenant Miller.<eos> How is he?<eos> His pulse is weak but he's still alive.<eos> Meperidine.
That's a pretty strong opioid.<eos> That's enough to kill him.<eos> Nell.<eos> Yeah, Callen?<eos> It looks like Miller's been drugged.<eos> We're gonna need a...<eos> Never mind.<eos> You save.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Naloxone.
That's enough to kill him.<eos> Nell.<eos> Yeah, Callen?<eos> It looks like Miller's been drugged.<eos> We're gonna need a...<eos> Never mind.<eos> You save.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Naloxone.<eos> Naloxone.
Nell.<eos> Yeah, Callen?<eos> It looks like Miller's been drugged.<eos> We're gonna need a...<eos> Never mind.<eos> You save.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Naloxone.<eos> Naloxone.<eos> Naloxone.
Did you trace the call?<eos> Yep.<eos> Burner phone, so dead end.<eos> Well, why would they go to the trouble of kidnapping Lieutenant Miller and then leaving him behind?<eos> Either they got what they wanted, or... this was never about him.<eos> What do we know about his grandfather?<eos> Master Sergeant Louis Miller.<eos> Born in 1936 in Philadelphia.<eos> He's a Marine Corps vet.<eos> Korea.
You know what we used to call her?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Hetty of Troy.<eos> 'Cause she could launch a thousand ships.<eos> Well, Hetty's got one more mission for you, Captain, and I've only got one more question.<eos> How fast do you think this chair can go?<eos> I know that smile.<eos> We have full coverage of all public spaces inside and out and limited coverage of a select few rooms, when deemed medically necessary.<eos> Sorry, is that normal?<eos> What the hell?
Sorry, is that normal?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, whoa.<eos> Oh.<eos> Look out!<eos> Captain Westbrook!<eos> What...<eos> Nice work, sweetheart.<eos> I mean, Captain was flying<eos> Blackbirds over Russia in the '60s.
Okay.<eos> Ah.<eos> Just you and me, I guess.<eos> Let's see 'em.<eos> Well, read 'em and weep.<eos> Full house.<eos> Mm.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> But not as impressive as four kings.<eos> Wow.
Yep.<eos> I don't know. Two M.E.s in London and one in New Jersey missing three murders?<eos> Odds seem pretty slim.<eos> No one would be happier if I'm wrong, but if I'm right and an assassin has made his way from England to America, then Sherlock and I could be in danger.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> You'll have all the help you need from the police in Jersey.<eos> But first, I'm gonna go find Marcus.<eos> I know he's gonna want to say hi to you.<eos> So, what've you been up to the last two years?<eos> Bit of this, bit of that.
I look for girls who've been sold into the sex trade, I find them, and I bring them home to their families.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Oh, I take on the occasional private client as well.<eos> Uh, so, what room does Sherlock have you set up in at the brownstone?<eos> Uh, I'm not staying at the brownstone.<eos> Oh. You're not?<eos> I didn't want to put you lot out.<eos> I mean, you do remember how many spare rooms we have there, right?<eos> So, where are you staying?<eos> Friend's.
That's amazing.<eos> Oh, I take on the occasional private client as well.<eos> Uh, so, what room does Sherlock have you set up in at the brownstone?<eos> Uh, I'm not staying at the brownstone.<eos> Oh. You're not?<eos> I didn't want to put you lot out.<eos> I mean, you do remember how many spare rooms we have there, right?<eos> So, where are you staying?<eos> Friend's.<eos> Oh, which friend?
Found something?<eos> Dr. Wilkerson received a $50,000 wire transfer from a Caymanian bank not 12 hours after she signed Cy Durning's autopsy report.<eos> You think that account belongs to Eli Kotite?<eos> I think that, like many slimy bond traders before him, he has multiple off-shore accounts in the Caymans.<eos> And while their laws make the Swiss look like chatterboxes, I think I know a way to prove that this one's his.<eos> You say you're not waiting for Watson, but that is the third time you've checked your watch in the last 30 minutes.<eos> And now that you're standing close to me, I can tell that your heart is virtually pounding, so is something amiss?<eos> The truth is, I've asked someone to meet me here.<eos> That's why I've ordered extra food.<eos> Who?
The more immediate danger is the oxygen supply.<eos> Answer my question, or you will suffocate long before you freeze to death.<eos> Gavin set up for tax havens in Mauritius.<eos> And when the Feds got to him, you thought he would talk.<eos> So you had him killed.<eos> I want a name.<eos> Raymond, it's Cooper.<eos> Harold, what can I do for you?<eos> - Give me back my prisoner.<eos> - Which prisoner?
Your services had better be used for someone who didn't belong in prison.<eos> Richard never belonged anywhere else.<eos> Just wait right here.<eos> All right, move.<eos> Wait right here.<eos> You looking for work?<eos> Uh, you know, if, um, the job's right.<eos> What do you know about batch credit card spoofing?<eos> I've done, uh, some, you know.<eos> Uh, for cartels mostly.
Uh, I-I don't know where he is.<eos> How tragic.<eos> Find him.<eos> On the odd chance I don't have it already, may I have your attention, please?<eos> find a terminal.<eos> There's something I need you to do.<eos> That's all we're getting?<eos> Our techs can't figure out how their encrypted feeds are being hacked.<eos> And The Architect's got us flying blind.<eos> Not quite.
You're gonna get yourself killed.<eos> Or don't.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just... get out of my way.<eos> Groups one and three, commence your DDoS attack... now.<eos> Groups two and four, 10 seconds.<eos> Without the contest winner, our plan fails.<eos> Find him.<eos> Negative contact, Leader.<eos> Group two and four... now.
Get the location to Ressler.<eos> Well... you're a many of many skills, Mister...<eos> Well, whoever you are, I need those skills.<eos> Count me out.<eos> Like him?<eos> I know who you are, and that you're willing to kill me if you have to.<eos> But you don't know who I am.<eos> And I am not someone who's gonna help you commit a crime.<eos> I'm not gonna help you.<eos> Samar!
Please. You can't do this.<eos> Last chance, Warden.<eos> Mach 7 leaves very little time for equivocation.<eos> Let him go.<eos> It's Cooper.<eos> Intersection of Mesa and Ridgeline Road.<eos> - Get there now.<eos> - We have a location for The Architect?<eos> And Aram. He's reached out using a device he got from Janet Sutherland.<eos> - That bitch?
Almost to altitude.<eos> Three minutes to jump.<eos> We're all good!<eos> Looking forward to this, Walt.<eos> Yeah, whoo!<eos> 12,000 feet!
Yes!<eos> Do you know when it's gonna happen, sir?<eos> Ronnie thinks it's gonna come out in the next few days.<eos> Here we go!<eos> All right! Whoo!<eos> Governor Whitfield, you'll be up first, and I'll be right behind you.<eos> See you on the ground, governor.<eos> Ha-ha! Geronimo!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Help!
All right! Whoo!<eos> Governor Whitfield, you'll be up first, and I'll be right behind you.<eos> See you on the ground, governor.<eos> Ha-ha! Geronimo!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> I can't let this happen!<eos> Help!
I know you guys are the experts on strategy, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.<eos> My brother was a good man;<eos> The last thing he would want is an innocent person to be accused of murder.<eos> Do you think this was Walt's fault?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> So, if our strategy of pointing the finger helps us find out who actually did this, then you and Dylan get to keep your company, and the governor's widow gets justice.<eos> Okay, let's talk about voir dire.<eos> Who do we not want on the jury?<eos> Her.
That's what I said.<eos> I had planned on telling you.<eos> But I didn't have a choice.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I should've known this would happen.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> No... it's not.<eos> Governor Aiken!<eos> Governor Aiken, any comment?<eos> No comment.
That's worrisome.<eos> Should I expect this challenge every time I'm on my own case?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Without you, we don't solve this.<eos> We were looking in the wrong direction.<eos> You pointed the finger at Walt.<eos> Which was a little heartless, by the way.<eos> I learned from the best.<eos> I guess we make a good team, even when we're on opposing sides.<eos> Until next time.
So why didn't you tell me you broke up with Gabe?<eos> I don't know. What, you thought I was gonna ask you out or something?<eos> Would you have asked me out?<eos> I guess we'll never know now.<eos> So you want to grab a drink?<eos> Hey, man. You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Remember the guy I told you I prosecuted?<eos> Hayden Watkins?
His wife... Remarried and... Started a whole new family.<eos> I may have destroyed an innocent man's life.<eos> You know this is statistically safer than cheerleading?<eos> That's my kind of statistic, but it can't possibly be true.<eos> Look it up.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're the real deal, Dylan.<eos> Your father would want you to live your life the way he did.<eos> Fearless.
Yeah, we've got nothing.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> Helen Dahle's husband said he had to get away to clear his head, and think about his wife's future.<eos> Well, Robert Dahle did go to Sarasota Springs, and he did stay in the hotel he mentioned, but he did not stay alone.<eos> Dahle was cheating on his wife.<eos> Are you saying that the husband hired the Apothecary to kill his wife?<eos> I'm just saying he definitely had a motive.<eos> When did I meet you? Are you serious?<eos> Humor me.<eos> Last night.
I want you to be happy.<eos> Everything's gonna be perfect.<eos> What were we doing here?<eos> Becky.<eos> I took you to Marvin's fiancee's house.<eos> Looks like he left in a hurry.<eos> Marvin, it's Raymond.<eos> We're all here at John's.<eos> Where are you?<eos> John's.
Previously on " Criminal Minds"<eos> They just charged Reid with the murder of Nadie Ramos. Bail is denied.<eos> Defendant will be remanded to Federal Custody pending Trial.<eos> He's in prison?<eos> You're going to give yourself a concussion.<eos> Beats what they'll do to me inside.<eos> Aah! Help!
Welcoming committee.<eos> You ok?<eos> I am right now.<eos> It's later I'm worried about.<eos> Anything I can do to help?<eos> Yeah. Give me some of that "Don't touch the skinny white guy" Pixie dust you got sprinkled on you.<eos> This ain't social hour.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> No touching.
Hold yourself. Searching now.<eos> Just your garden variety vandalism, drug possession.<eos> It's all pretty standard for a condemned building.<eos> Wait, it's condemned?<eos> Mm-hmm. Has been for months.<eos> It's scheduled to be demolished, But, uh, something's holding it up. Permit issue.<eos> Thanks, Garcia.<eos> You truly, you are the best.<eos> Really?<eos> Available.
Can you tell me more about that?<eos> But what about Danny?<eos> Was he a drinker?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe he did drugs?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Why would you even think that?<eos> Drug use is something we always have to consider.<eos> Not Danny.
Keep it alive.<eos> 'cause I'm afraid right now, That's all we've got.<eos> "Hope is being able to see that there is light, despite all of the darkness".<eos> Desmond Tutu.<eos> What's up, snitch?<eos> That your girlfriend come to see you?<eos> She's my friend.<eos> You never got any?<eos> What's wrong with you, man?<eos> Help!

- Oh, you opened my check?<eos> I have a PhD from the London School of Economics.<eos> Well, maybe it's because you're on loan - from Mossad.<eos> - I have the same clearances - and responsibilities.<eos> - Actually, technically... - And people actually shoot at me.<eos> - That is true.<eos> Okay, you should probably say something to Agent Cooper.<eos> Say what?<eos> Aram has a suspect. Yes.<eos> Uh, the suspect.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> From the beginning, we've been fighting secrets and... agendas and... psychotic homicidal killers coming between us.<eos> And for the first time, we're together, and we've got no one to fight.<eos> But it still feels...<eos> Like we're coming apart?<eos> I know this family is the most important thing to you.<eos> But it's not gonna work if you can't be who you are.<eos> - I guess I'm just scared.<eos> - Of what?
So we don't trace him digitally.<eos> Never gonna outsmart him online, anyway.<eos> Ooh, that hurts my feelings.<eos> Focus on who he is in the real world instead.<eos> You're talking about pattern of life?<eos> Um, what is this "pattern of life"?<eos> Profiling technique.<eos> We gather every detail we know about a suspect.<eos> What he eats, what he wears, kind of music he likes.<eos> Especially irregularities.
And you proved yourself a hundred times since, to me.<eos> And me to you, right?<eos> We should probably stop reading these before someone else gets hurt.<eos> Well, since Sebastian's busy waging cyber-warfare, I had another tech analyze the bullets from Lieutenant Shaw's murder.<eos> Well, those slugs were in fragments.<eos> You were able to get a ballistics match?<eos> No, something far more intriguing:<eos> traces of ink.<eos> What kind of ink?<eos> Printer, pen?
So it gives us a fighting chance.<eos> Cabin's 50 minutes up this road.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> Yeah, but if we take the ATV through the woods, we'll be there in less than 30.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> You're good to go.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Two dead, troopers.<eos> I see Harper.<eos> No sign of Damon.
! No, I won't calm down!<eos> Put her on the phone!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I gotta protect them.<eos> Good news, bad news.<eos> Good news is I got your case moved to Alexandria federal court.<eos> The rocket docket?
Never, ever, mess with a man's stash on the inside.<eos> When you do...<eos> People get hurt.<eos> Luis.<eos> It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Guard!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
Everybody says I can't trust you.<eos> She won't even tell me what Rachel did to her, - and I'm meant to send her back?<eos> - Keep the faith.<eos> We're not without allies.<eos> No, no, we're not giving up where Helena is.<eos> Wake up, Mommy. Wake up!<eos> There's something in the woods, Cosima.<eos> Hello, Susan.<eos> You're looking much better.<eos> Colour in your cheeks.
We knew from the start we'd have to break a few eggs.<eos> But she never really had the guts for the wet work.<eos> Tell us who it was.<eos> You know who put me here, Sarah. Think.<eos> When Castor fell,<eos> Leda won.<eos> Susan Duncan.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I was young. P.T. and Susan recruited me.<eos> - Out of Castor?
You know who put me here, Sarah. Think.<eos> When Castor fell,<eos> Leda won.<eos> Susan Duncan.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I was young. P.T. and Susan recruited me.<eos> - Out of Castor?<eos> - It was before cloning, before we found Kendall Malone...<eos> - we found someone else.<eos> - Who?
You want more?<eos> This time of night, that keycard, you can roll me right out.<eos> - We need her. Come on.<eos> - Dr. Perkins?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What are you doing in this ward?<eos> - I'm a guest of Dr. Nimitz.<eos> - Yes, I'm Dr. Nimitz.<eos> Oh! Well, finally!<eos> So lovely to...
Well, then, let me ask after this escaped subject.<eos> Why capture it when you should have it eradicated?<eos> Because this mutation is important to me.<eos> Because life, long or short, is never perfect.<eos> I only meant...<eos> We can't predict all outcomes, can we?<eos> For instance, how old is Leekie?<eos> Could you have predicted that he would wind up buried underneath some random crone's garage?<eos> I must remember that you know most things.<eos> Most.
Oh, yes! God, I feel so guilty.<eos> Our kids are so safe and Sarah is always at risk because of this fluke of nature.<eos> Ali.<eos> What? I'm sorry, your hair!<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's... artsy.<eos> - Yes! - And purple.<eos> Yes! I wanted something creative and free, you know?<eos> I met this Jungian who just... lives in that place.<eos> - A who?

Gracie can't look at me without searching for symptoms.<eos> I can't imagine her all alone.<eos> Well, I'm sorry she's not here to help, but I need you to give me an ejaculate sample.<eos> That wasn't part of our deal.<eos> You've got plenty to spare.<eos> Now, you said you had information.<eos> I think I can help you find Helena.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was looking for you to say goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.
All right, we've got nine obituaries for male students who've died during Susan's time there.<eos> These are the faces we have so far.<eos> Timothy Midwell, died 1969, alcohol poisoning.<eos> No.<eos> Henry Gonard, died '68. Fell from a punt and drowned.<eos> Probably also alcohol poisoning.<eos> No. Winston Tralley, died '65,<eos> - rugby accident.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Cosima.
Westmorland isn't 170!<eos> He just assumed this identity to sell his story.<eos> Well, if everyone on the island bought into PT's myth, do you think the Neolution board did too?<eos> We need to still go after this Al-Khatib guy.<eos> The Neo bagman?<eos> He's so protected it's not even funny.<eos> If he is bribing governments for citizens' genetics, - then we've got to...<eos> - Leave it, luv.<eos> - Empty seats?<eos> - Suicides.
How did she find her?<eos> Helena wouldn't have kept in contact with that bible thumping little traitor.<eos> All we know is that they're both gone. Guys?<eos> She said there was blood in the room.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They're grabbing Helena just as her babies - are coming to term.<eos> - He wants cord blood, the mutation...<eos> For himself, and then to exploit.<eos> Last time we saw Gracie, who did she sell us out to?<eos> Virginia Coady.
We escaped in a boat with only a map and compass.<eos> You said you would cure me if I helped you.<eos> I think I can help you find Helena.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Do you remember this guy?<eos> Ian Van Lier.
It's just all this info from Europe shows a dozen countries have pending legislation like Kuwait's.<eos> Hundreds of millions of people are about to be required to submit their DNA, and Neolution is behind it.<eos> - They need that data.<eos> - OK, so you want to spend the morning safeguarding the genetic future of humankind<eos> - or do you wanna have brunch?<eos> - We have a Skype date.<eos> Siobhan wants a summit.<eos> You're calling them or what?<eos> They're calling us!<eos> "Us"?
- Let Cosima make an appearance.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - I'm not gonna do that.<eos> What I need is for you to leave right now before people start arriving and something "cloney" happens.<eos> - Alison, I'm already on...<eos> - Look around you.<eos> It's already happening.<eos> Right?<eos> - Shit.
Ezra!<eos> Wie ghet's?<eos> Felix.<eos> Gentlemen, I would like you to meet my sister, Hestia.<eos> Goddess of hearth and home. ♪<eos> We're intrigued, "sister." We know so much, yet so little.<eos> Where do you live in the real world?<eos> I live deep in Bailey Downs, which, uh, which is a suburb just-just north of here.<eos> Oh! And this is my husband, Donnie.<eos> Champagne?
- But you used this phone.<eos> Yes.<eos> They will trace it.<eos> We have to leave.<eos> Gentlemen, ladies of the board.<eos> Oh, Rachel has a bit of a headache, I'm afraid.<eos> - She plucked out her own eye.<eos> - Well, you seem to be missing some teeth.<eos> Empty seats?<eos> - Suicides.
2011. Bangladesh. Fire broke out in a Dhaka ghetto sweatshop.<eos> Sixty-eight perished, 27 were children.<eos> Subsequent news coverage exposed horrific working conditions, which were blamed by activists on the factory's primary contractor, fit thread jeans, and their CEO, haute couture designer, Cynthia Brooks.<eos> Now, the scandal rocked the industry.<eos> Has he been admitted yet?<eos> Has the doctor said anything?<eos> Okay, let me see if I can come out.<eos> No, I wanna be there.<eos> You said Stone went after one of Reddington's couriers...<eos> Yes, and one of his accountants.

And we're going to investigate it.<eos> Everything okay? With the phone call?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just stuff. "Stuff"?<eos> Yeah. Stuff.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Thank you for coming, director.<eos> We were hoping that the DGSE could tell us about the hit-and-run in Paris.<eos> We actually know very little.<eos> No identification. No cell phone.

No identification. No cell phone.<eos> We understand he had over $30,000 in us bills on him.<eos> Counterfeit bills.<eos> Untraceable.<eos> We'd like to review any eyewitness reports.<eos> Well, I'll forward them from the police prefecture if you tell me why you are so interested in a random hit-and-run.<eos> We believe the victim was a courier.<eos> For whom?<eos> We're not at Liberty to say.<eos> Raymond Reddington.
My question is why?<eos> My question is "why not?"<eos> You have a wife and a child and a life.<eos> Leave well enough alone.<eos> I told Liz I would, that it didn't matter, and it doesn't.<eos> It wouldn't, except that you told me not to let Scottie Hargrave know that I'm her son.<eos> That if I did, I would never find the truth I've been looking for.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He's dead, Tom.<eos> What truth?
But he was fearless.<eos> A lion.<eos> He demanded to commandeer our convoy in order to transport refugees to Ekata.<eos> He was unarmed.<eos> I had a security detail of a dozen international battle-hardened mercenaries.<eos> What did you do?<eos> In the face of that kind of...<eos> Will... I re-organized my cargo and complied with his demands.<eos> What progress have you made with Isabella Stone?<eos> None.
By the oven.<eos> I grabbed one.<eos> Did you put the knife in your pocket? Yeah.<eos> Didn't need it.<eos> When I walked up to him, he was sleeping there.<eos> Like a doll or something.<eos> Hey, babe, you know, I was thinking about your dad and you're right.<eos> We should just let it lie.<eos> I don't think that there's any reason for us to look into your past.<eos> Yeah. About that...
It's very nice to meet you, Vanessa.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Jeremy.<eos> Brah!<eos> Stop the press!<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> With the fruit basket.<eos> You sprung for the suite.<eos> Happy Valentine's.<eos> Happy Valentine's to you.
Okay.<eos> What's the, what's the safe word, then?<eos> Chicken salad.<eos> "Chicken salad" Yeah.<eos> Chicken salad. Okay.<eos> Well, yeah, I'll just figure out a way to casually slide chicken salad into a normal human sentence.<eos> Organically. Organically.<eos> Weave it in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Chin.
Chicken salad.<eos> "Chicken salad" Yeah.<eos> Chicken salad. Okay.<eos> Well, yeah, I'll just figure out a way to casually slide chicken salad into a normal human sentence.<eos> Organically. Organically.<eos> Weave it in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Chin.<eos> Well, we caught a homicide.<eos> Also, happy Valentine's Day.
I'll get out of here right now. No, no, no.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> Enjoy yourself.<eos> We got it covered. Tell him.<eos> Tell him ten minutes we can be there. We're not doing nothing.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> They're good. All right, listen, enjoy your Valentine's Day.<eos> Keep us posted on what happens.<eos> And, you know, hope you get home to spend some time with Abby for Valentine's.<eos> Yeah, you and me both.
Danny, no! Hey!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, you with the Frisbee.<eos> Come on, hand 'em over.<eos> What are you talking about? The glasses... they're mine.<eos> Dude, I don't have your glasses.<eos> These are mine.<eos> All right, well, look, we'll settle this. My glasses...<eos> They got a little scratch on the inside right lens.<eos> Give me those, and, we'll see what's what? Help!<eos> Help!
I'm sorry.<eos> Well, dinner is in, 20 minutes, so we should get ready.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Sorry I got all goofy and blew off the rest of the afternoon.<eos> I know you put a lot into making this weekend nice.<eos> I'm sorry I got goofy over a pair of sunglasses.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know what I signed up for.<eos> Besides, we still have tonight.<eos> Champagne?
I'm sorry I got goofy over a pair of sunglasses.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know what I signed up for.<eos> Besides, we still have tonight.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Yes. Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm impressed you were able to talk your way out of that. No.<eos> They're very nice people, the Garson family, very nice.<eos> I mean, considering we... well, we broke into their hotel room, I suppose, they were very... I think they were very reasonable.<eos> Reasonable?
What are you sorry about?<eos> For what I'm about to do.<eos> Hang on to something, buddy!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What the hell is the matter with you? !<eos> You want to live, get out of the truck and get behind the engine block.<eos> Grab the canister.<eos> Danny? What?<eos> If you open that restaurant, I want you to seriously consider calling it "Steve's," please.<eos> Steve's?
Steve's?<eos> Yes, because then if we're not together, we'll still, you know, we're still gonna... we'll be together still.<eos> Very sentimental.<eos> So we good on the name?<eos> Danny, you all right?<eos> How's the canister, man?<eos> That's it, I'm not gonna retire anytime soon, but if I do, I can't name the restaurant Steve's!<eos> The restaurant? Yes!<eos> The restaurant!<eos> Steve's!
Hurt my feelings.<eos> You know, for a hardened ex-con, you're a little overly sensitive, don't you think?<eos> I still didn't hear an apology.<eos> You ain't gonna hear one until you refresh my bread plate.<eos> I got to take this call.<eos> All right, next course, Grandma Arlene's secret meatballs.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Pass 'em around.<eos> Everybody good? - So far good?<eos> Huh? - Amazing.
Here you go.<eos> You can relax now.<eos> I promise no one followed you and no one's watching you.<eos> I guess this whole undercover thing got me on edge.<eos> Well, I can't imagine why.<eos> So how are things going with Detective Guzman?<eos> Good, I think.<eos> He says I'm giving him some good stuff.<eos> Did he give you an ETA on when you're gonna move on the gang?<eos> Above my pay grade.
He's gonna be at the VGU Open this weekend.<eos> I'm gonna play him.<eos> I'm gonna kick his ass.<eos> I can't believe you're wasting an entire weekend playing video games with sweaty nerdcore dweebs.<eos> Not all of them are dweebs.<eos> Challenge Uncle O.G., but be warned...<eos> You will be wrecked.<eos> There will be pwnage.<eos> Okay, kids, don't try this at home.<eos> What the hell?
This is just what we were able to dig up online.<eos> Still don't know where the attack took place, or if he's alive or dead.<eos> We do know that "O.G." is a pseudonym, and that he's good at keeping his real name private.<eos> The company that hosts his live stream does all their business with him through a DBA, so we subpoenaed the IRS to pull ownership records, but they're taking their time, as usual.<eos> Are you sure he was in New York?<eos> He said he was.<eos> He was supposed to appear at a tournament this weekend at the Javits Center.<eos> If you want the latest, you should join the captain.<eos> He's about to get a briefing.<eos> From who, the computer crime squad?

Your people can move in, doubling your profit.<eos> Now, in exchange, I want you and yours to leave my daughter alone.<eos> Forever.<eos> Or?<eos> No need for "or."<eos> You know a good deal when you hear it, and I'm only offering once.<eos> Hello, Carla, or... do you prefer Amanda?<eos> Or Tasha?<eos> Carla is fine.<eos> Carla.
She's used to trading herself for money.<eos> Didn't ask you how your emergency meeting with Shinwell went.<eos> Did you manage to avert his crisis?<eos> Well, I tried to point him in the right direction.<eos> We already have you on the arson.<eos> I spilled gasoline by accident.<eos> I dropped a cigarette.<eos> Clumsy me.<eos> But I didn't send anyone after the boy,<eos> Tendu.
$100,000 is more than enough to replace some old computers and open a new office.<eos> Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?<eos> He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.<eos> Paid me on the spot.<eos> In cash?<eos> Brand new hundred dollar bills.<eos> Joey Ng told us he hadn't given Tendu any money.<eos> Did he say where he got it?<eos> Sorry.
Couldn't wait for me to park the car?<eos> I could see he was armed and heading into this building.<eos> What's so special about this building?<eos> Carla Petro was arrested here once.<eos> It was thought that her employers kept an apartment here so that the girls could entertain clients.<eos> Just the kind of place Libena might go to hide?<eos> You got this all wrong.<eos> I'm just here to serve a summons.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Tendu?

Surveillance cameras recorded you in and around his hotel at the time of the murder.<eos> And the gun we found in your possession looks like a perfect match for the one used to pistol-whip the victim.<eos> It's not too late to cut a deal.<eos> We still don't know which of your firm's lawyers ordered the hit on Tendu.<eos> You give us a name...<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Why would anyone from my firm want me to kill some Eskimo?<eos> Global warming.<eos> Your presence here is the result of, let's call it, um...<eos> "the reverse butterfly effect."
Chivonne?<eos> You won't have no more problems with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I liked walking you home the other day.<eos> I was thinking maybe we can make it a habit.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't what?<eos> I know what you want.<eos> For you and me.
I'm here because I made a choice.<eos> What if that means I don't get out alive?<eos> Don't cry.<eos> It's a good day, isn't it?<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> You're 16 now.<eos> What were you gonna do to celebrate, if you weren't here, I mean.<eos> Come on, tell me.<eos> Go out with my parents and my sister.<eos> Attie?
Her elegant lessons on tolerance just take my breath away, you know?<eos> I'm sorry, you were saying..<eos> You you were going out with your parents and Attie.<eos> Again, sorry to interrupt. I... I just have to ask.<eos> Is it awkward...<eos> Since they just got divorced and all?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I always wondered that.<eos> Where were you gonna go?<eos> Just... To this Thai place.
Mine, too.<eos> Sa Ta Na ma.<eos> That's your secret being so calm?<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> Kundalini yoga.<eos> What about you?<eos> 9 months in Sri Lanka.<eos> Whoa! OK, you win.<eos> When were you there?<eos> During the war.
It's my book!<eos> Nick, how many days did it take to print this out?<eos> About a week. I had to go to a car rental place at night, but, uh... read the first page.<eos> "To Anthony Rizzo and the Chicago Cubs, for all we've been through."<eos> "And to my friend Jessica Day... for the same thing."<eos> I don't know if you remember this, but, uh... you were the one who told me to go to New Orleans.<eos> So thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We got the house.<eos> For real this time.
You live here, right? Why?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is my home, Mr. Frink, and strictly off limits.<eos> How's the ventilation?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Hello. Yeah. Back here, Ed.<eos> Ed? Who the hell is Ed?<eos> My assistant.
Wait a minute.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is my home, Mr. Frink, and strictly off limits.<eos> How's the ventilation?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Hello. Yeah. Back here, Ed.<eos> Ed? Who the hell is Ed?<eos> My assistant.<eos> Your assistant?
What?<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> It is what I am here to ascertain.<eos> Chief Inspector...<eos> Ever since Trudy disappeared,<eos> Juliana just hasn't been herself.<eos> It really shook her up.<eos> They're very close.<eos> I mean, when she came here, out of the blue she was, strange, upset, talking crazy.<eos> Crazy?
As long as it's an easy journey.<eos> Oh, it's too easy.<eos> You are the Deus ex machina, the god from the machine, on stage for a mere moment to soften the heart of the bastard king, who's imposed a sex ban on his daughters.<eos> Wicked! Amazing! Oh, it's quite wonderful.<eos> Can I be in it as well?<eos> I'd make a great king, or prince.<eos> There's no prince in the play.<eos> Friend of the prince?<eos> There is no prince.<eos> General guy?
It's all been cast.<eos> I just want to be involved. I love the theatre.<eos> Of course.<eos> You could understudy Sebastus. We do need someone for that.<eos> Great. What's the pay like?<eos> There is no pay.<eos> Deal.<eos> Grumio's in the play?<eos> Yeah, and I'm actually pretty tight with the director, Iona...<eos> Iona Ruffina?
Who are you?<eos> Yes, Iona, this is my girlfriend, Delphine.<eos> I'm a huge fan of your work.<eos> Thank you, child. Too, too kind.<eos> May I ask et tu Gauloise?<eos> Yes. You speak Gallic?<eos> Tres petit peu.<eos> I toured Gaul many moons ago. Terrific audiences.<eos> Even better lovers. Yes.<eos> Entre, entre.
My character wouldn't plod on stage.<eos> He should fly on on a winch.<eos> That's you being lazy. Get me a winch or I walk.<eos> Those are the two options.<eos> And a cream bun.<eos> For the character or for you?<eos> For both.<eos> Behold, I am your...<eos> What was it again?<eos> King.
I was worried she's pushing us apart.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Iona's asked me to go to Turkey with her.<eos> I'm going to be her PA.<eos> Turkey? That's bloody miles away.<eos> Don't worry, she'll be taken care of.<eos> The gentlemen there are very generous.<eos> You can forget about your Cupid, you thespy shitbag. Oh, really.<eos> Yeah.
_<eos> He's having one, end of story.<eos> Okay, good news.<eos> The Din-o-mites are available Saturday.<eos> And they're apparently performing at Flamingo Park tomorrow if you and Mateo want to go check them out.<eos> Mateo's already seen them at his friend Ava's birthday.<eos> Book 'em.<eos> We're in. Let me update Rafael.<eos> Sorry, he's been in a closed-door meeting with Petra forever.<eos> With Petra?
Are you all right?<eos> Raf, you were gone for hours.<eos> It went great.<eos> Derek definitely bought it.<eos> I saw him pacing the halls, looking completely freaked out.<eos> He'll confront you, you'll get him to confess to bribing you, end of story.<eos> That's right.<eos> The whole FBI raid was a setup!<eos> Those are some great poker faces.<eos> Rogelio's, not so much.
Let's just keep this between you and me, okay?<eos> Hey, sir?<eos> - Do you travel this road a lot?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> Me and Tito here, we scoot just about everywhere.<eos> See anything unusual last night?<eos> It's about that crazy lady, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you see her?<eos> Oh, right back there.
And, uh, what did she look like?<eos> We didn't really get a good look, did we?<eos> I-It was dark, and the poor thing, she... she just seemed afraid to show herself.<eos> Paws over her face and everything.<eos> She... she was super-shaky.<eos> Goofed out on something, probably.<eos> When we asked what was wrong, she just freaked out, sped off.<eos> What was she driving?<eos> Oh, one of those little S.U.V.s...<eos> a Honda.
Are you... are you up for a photo?<eos> - Whatever you need, sir.<eos> - All right.<eos> How's the light there?<eos> You're letting Red take the credit?<eos> We were deadlocked.<eos> I'm breaking the deadlock.<eos> Laurel, I'm gonna ask you a favor right now.<eos> It's gonna start as a favor and then it's gonna become a demand.<eos> - A demand?
I'm gonna do what I can from here. Luce?<eos> You better have your dancing shoes on.<eos> I'm a ship, John. I don't have feet.<eos> Oh, I understand the reference now. That was funny, John.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I don't need your pity, Lucy.<eos> Shit, Johnny, we're pinned.<eos> Dutch will be fine. She has Khlyen.<eos> No offense, I always imagined my last stand, blaze of glory being with my brother.<eos> - Not you.
Oh, Delle Seyah must have a mouth full of honey-candy with all the sweet promises she's making.<eos> Don't tell me that people actually believe her?<eos> There's a lot of charm in that snake.<eos> How about you?<eos> Would you ever leave?<eos> Sometimes you have to leave a home to protect it.<eos> Sometimes you have to stay and fight.<eos> Time will tell.<eos> Pawter's favorite.<eos> To Red.
Mm-hmm.<eos> That's cool.<eos> You want, uh, any cracklins, braheem?<eos> No, I don't want any friggin' cracklins, braheem!<eos> You know, I was wondering if it ever crossed your mind to consult with me first.<eos> You know, I'm guessing it didn't, Tandy.<eos> Did it?<eos> I found this bacon.<eos> - We ran this by the group... - Yeah. And everyone agreed that Mike should get to finish off the bacon, 'cause he hasn't had any yet.<eos> Everyone?
And you want to hazard a guess as to who's down with OBB?<eos> Every last Tandy.<eos> Oh, come on. Tandy, ever since Mike showed up, you don't have time for me anymore.<eos> Oh, don't you dare.<eos> Uh, every time I try to hang out with you, you're always either with Gail or Melissa.<eos> - That is not true!<eos> - Oh, yes, it is.<eos> You're just like one of those guys who as soon as they get two girlfriends, they just disappear.<eos> No, you know what? I'm your backup plan.<eos> Your number two.
Your connection to the Force allows you to see in ways others cannot.<eos> If you can see yourself, you will never be truly blind,<eos> Kanan Jarrus, Jedi Knight.<eos> I understand.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Ezra needs me.<eos> They all do.<eos> What of the spiders?<eos> (CHUCKLES) I can see them, so there's nothing to fear.<eos> And what of this, hmm?
He went his and... eventually, he retired altogether.<eos> And now he's back.<eos> Now he's back.<eos> So what's your story?<eos> It's not that interesting.<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> JEAN-CLAUDE: You're right. With Pop dead... it would be easy now to go someplace warm.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> We'll be fine, I just need to stretch a bit more.<eos> Not you.
You missed a lot.<eos> Please.<eos> They were gonna do a demonstration on a bunch of animals using the gas, but Chloe stole it.<eos> Tried to stop them.<eos> She got shot at by a bunch of General Davies' men.<eos> She managed to make her way to the room where the gas was, but the canister cracked, and gas started leaking out, and we all would've died, but...<eos> But what?<eos> Dariela. She, uh, sealed the door.<eos> Trapped the gas inside.<eos> The gas and Chloe.
Like, really amazing.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Did I tell you you're amazing?<eos> Can I buy you a drink?<eos> I never understood why people work their guts out when they're young and retire when they're too old to do anything.<eos> Shouldn't we live a little first... climb Machu Picchu, run with the bulls, skydive in France?<eos> Man, I must sound like a spoilt little rich kid.<eos> No. I wish I could do all of that.<eos> Oh, you've never travelled?<eos> Not even with, uh, old mate?

Please listen to me. Don't do it!<eos> Let that cop show up...<eos> I'll return your money.<eos> I just got off the phone...<eos> He'll be here any moment.<eos> Killing me won't get you a thing...<eos> Am I not your beloved "uncle", now?<eos> What do you do?<eos> Me?<eos> Shopping...
Uncle!<eos> Uncle...<eos> That torch is blinding me!<eos> Uncle's gone out. He'll be here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Have we met before?<eos> Sir... you shaved off your beard?<eos> He's crushed their heads with a rock...<eos> One's a drug dealer, the other is his neighbor.<eos> With a rock?
- Ok, what happened?<eos> We were somewhere on a damn island.<eos> You reek of booze.<eos> Olivia and Bosse, go into the other room.<eos> I gave Marianne Boglund your number, she'll call when she has something.<eos> Tom, you come with me. -<eos> - Where to?<eos> To the interrogation room.<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> Because of the interrogatory?
But we do know he was there. -<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> He was with a man named Alf Stein.<eos> They rented a house.<eos> We have a recent recording in which Alf Stein declares he and Svenker were on the island that day.<eos> Well, it's possible...<eos> now that you mention it...<eos> I remember Sverker came to ask for money, as usual.<eos> He was with a friend. -<eos> - Alf Stein. -
It's about a murder, back in Kinshasa.<eos> Couldn't you call at least?<eos> We were together after all.<eos> We were gonna get married have children, spend our lives together.<eos> You're right, I've been a fool.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> Don't say you're sorry!<eos> You know what I've been through? !<eos> You could have called... tell me you were gonna start a new life with her...<eos> With who?
Okay... ah, we have two breakfast burritos, two hash browns, two chips, two sides of guac, and one fork.<eos> See you at lunch.<eos> Yolanda, what kind of birthday cake do you want for your party again?<eos> It's really hard to keep track of all the cakes you eat.<eos> It's the Peanut Butter Dream from Jan's Cake House.<eos> I mean, you should know it.<eos> It's right next to that store that sells dress clothes for toddlers.<eos> Okay, here's the address. And just so I know you went, bring me back a cupcake.<eos> Now, I have a problem.<eos> In addition to drinking, gambling, and overeating?
Right. I totally get it.<eos> How about now?<eos> Okay, so about this whole us being friends again thing...<eos> Can we be friends with Benedicts?<eos> I'm sorry, I just... I really miss your cooking.<eos> Well, I am here 8:00-6:00.<eos> Good to know.<eos> You get here at 8:00?<eos> All right, one double cheeseburger, chicken tenders and fries, and a diet root beer.<eos> Baby steps.
As soon as I got that manager job, you started acting all smartypants with me.<eos> No, I didn't!<eos> I just said that I'm more experienced and went to college and you can't do basic math... Oh, there it is.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> You don't have to apologize for being smarter than me.<eos> Oh, I'm not smarter than you.<eos> I mean, maybe in, like, math and English, and... school stuff, but that's just because I'm book-smart<eos> - And you're...<eos> - Cook-smart?
So, where are you from?<eos> Gotham.<eos> Listen, if you need to use the phone, go ahead.<eos> Why would I need to use the phone?<eos> Someone's got to be looking for you. No.<eos> - No one.<eos> - Really? A beautiful girl like you?<eos> You think I'm beautiful?<eos> So, who are you?<eos> Just a girl.
It's time to round up our friends.<eos> Believe me, if I could fix you, I would.<eos> I think of you as one of my own children.<eos> But I can't.<eos> So what am I supposed to do?<eos> Give up?<eos> Do you not understand what you are?<eos> What you represent?<eos> You are the first of a new generation.<eos> A new Eve.
City still owes me for bringing in the last of Strange's creeps.<eos> - Yeah, you been hustlin'...<eos> Hello, Jim.<eos> What-what are you...<eos> You look well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You visiting?<eos> No, we're... um, I'm-I'm moving here.<eos> Permanently.<eos> With my fiancﻯ.
She would be proud.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> Oswald, look at everything you've achieved.<eos> The people love you.<eos> Gangs fear you.<eos> And tomorrow night, the crÃ¨me of Gotham will be gathering to celebrate you.<eos> What more could someone ask for?<eos> Someone to share it with.<eos> My mother was the daughter of immigrants.<eos> A humble cook.
No one kills Penguin.<eos> You should.<eos> 'Cause he's going to murder you.<eos> Time to have a heart-to-heart, Butch.<eos> Alone.<eos> You don't have to buy lunch.<eos> I know you're a billionaire, but I can buy you a sandwich.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> Being a cop?<eos> Sometimes, yeah.
And ever since you've known me,<eos> I've been dedicated to one thing, but that's done.<eos> I don't know what's next, but I know... Would you, please... just say what you mean?<eos> I like you... as more than a friend.<eos> It would be nice if you said something back.<eos> How many girls have you dated?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> It's not a trick question.<eos> How many girls have you dated?<eos> - None.
There's just, um, something about you. No, no, please.<eos> There's...<eos> There's no need to apologize.<eos> You ju...<eos> You remind me of someone that I used to know.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You struggle to regain me.<eos> When I'm lost... you struggle to obtain me.<eos> What am I?<eos> Time.
I want a name!<eos> Symon, okay?<eos> Dr. Symon.<eos> He's a big-time plastic surgeon.<eos> So what, he likes cutting people's faces off for kicks?<eos> - Try again! - No.<eos> He's got a side business.<eos> You get in trouble, you need a new face, he gives you one.<eos> A new face?<eos> - Whose?
Can't we bury the hatchet?<eos> So I came at you with a knife, kidnapped you, whatever.<eos> I've forgiven you for beating me unconscious.<eos> Water under the bridge.<eos> You just stay right here, I'm gonna get someone.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Just wanted to ask.<eos> As someone else who was once with Jim Gordon, don't you miss it?<eos> Miss what?<eos> The heat.
I have been feeling the same.<eos> I didn't want to mention it, because of all the awfulness about Isabelle.<eos> Isabella!<eos> But...<eos> One cannot deny love.<eos> Wh-what's wrong?<eos> There's been a misunderstanding.<eos> I was going to... Propose that we become partners.<eos> Business partners.<eos> Partners?
Don't know, never seen him.<eos> You're the first speedster I know of who has.<eos> But every story I ever heard about Savitar is basically the same.<eos> Savitar was the first man ever granted speed.<eos> And over time, he became the god of motion, the fastest of us all.<eos> Before Savitar graces an Earth with his presence... He sends a predecessor to prepare for his arrival.<eos> Alchemy.<eos> What's he preparing for?<eos> A battle with you.<eos> Why me?
What?<eos> I couldn't sleep on Cisco's couch anymore, and your place is sort of small for two, so I signed a lease and I put both of our names on it.<eos> I got you a wallet.<eos> I'm sure I'll love it.<eos> Barry, this is a big step.<eos> Not for me.<eos> I don't know what's gonna happen in the future.<eos> All I know is, right here, right now, I want to spend every moment I can with you.<eos> You're the first thing I want to see when I wake up.<eos> And the last thing...
And it'll mess up your hair.<eos> There's nothing in the historical records about a weapon like this.<eos> Please tell me there's a "but".<eos> But I have a theory.<eos> Okay. So... assuming that the symbol etched into it has a connection to hell, what's the first thing you think of when you think of hell?<eos> The devil, right?<eos> And what's the most common visual representation of the devil?<eos> Uh, a man in a red suit.<eos> Pointy tail.<eos> - With a pitchfork.
The Devil.<eos> None of it exists.<eos> Did you believe in vampires before you fell in love with one and became one yourself?<eos> That's the trouble with facts, Stefan.<eos> They're true whether you believe in them or not.<eos> I promise you, just as my sister promised me.<eos> There was a man named Cade.<eos> The people he loved damned him.<eos> And only at the very end did he finally give up on them, only when the smell of his burning flesh was searing his nostrils, did he see them for what they really were.<eos> Monsters.
I can see your humanity trying to break through, Damon.<eos> Come home with me.<eos> I can help you be happy again.<eos> How? It'll take time and work. But I'll be there for you.<eos> I-I... I can't, Stefan.<eos> - I ruined everything. - Hey.<eos> I am your brother, and I love you.<eos> Just come home with me.<eos> Is that how you help me?<eos> Vervain?
We spoke by phone a few hours ago.<eos> She was getting ready to put the girls to bed.<eos> I have these.<eos> I don't know which ones you want to use.<eos> This is them.<eos> And, uh, this is Sybil, the woman who we believe is with Seline.<eos> How do you know they're traveling together?<eos> It's a hunch.<eos> Sybil is Seline's sorta sister.<eos> - "Sorta" sister?
He's an interesting guy.<eos> You want time with him?<eos> Not particularly, no.<eos> Funny thing he said the opposite about you.<eos> Caroline?<eos> Mr. Salvatore.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> Cade.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Just... behind the veil.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, let me tell you something.<eos> You've got a great personality!<eos> And you're sweet, and funny, and charming... you're the whole damn package!<eos> Yeah, well... so are you, any girl would kill to be with you!<eos> Any guy would kill to be with you!<eos> Oh, Elliot... Oh... I got your 9-1-1 text.<eos> What's the emergency?<eos> I... I was afraid... that were stuck in somethin'... or somethin' was stuck in you.<eos> Not this time.
- Okay.<eos> Why is there duct tape on the fridge?<eos> Oh, Yolanda sleepwalk eats, so she taped it closed.<eos> What?<eos> She eats in her sleep, so she taped it...<eos> It's a whole thing.<eos> - So this is nice.<eos> - So nice.<eos> You know, in the old days, this would have been awkward, but now that we're just friends...<eos> - Great friends.

No!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Okay? We need help!<eos> Okay, there you are.<eos> - Alan, we have a huge problem.<eos> - Yeah. And you can't tell anybody, especially Sofia.<eos> Well, my hands are beyond full with Elliot's grieving process.<eos> But you are letting us stay here for free, so talk to me.<eos> - We're having sex.<eos> - Together?
So much for that. - Had to reach in, I didn't have my gloves.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, 'cause I did get a serial number off of it, so I know who bought it, at least.<eos> Richards and Wheeler.<eos> High-end law firm in Beverly Hills. Cool.<eos> Next time, if you want, you know, you can just lead with that information.<eos> If you want.<eos> Okay, boss, where do you want me?<eos> I'm not your boss, I'm just, you know, kind of...<eos> My boss.
So was that poor kid.<eos> His name's Marco Sanchez.<eos> Got in over his head with the cartel, was trying to make it right.<eos> So he was working with Charlotte and the FBI as an informant?<eos> Trying to build a case against Perez, yeah.<eos> That's why he and Charlotte were meeting at the hotel in secret.<eos> But look at this.<eos> Perez's hit man is Jimmy the Carpenter.<eos> Want to take a guess at his M.O.?<eos> - Screwdriver? - Boom.
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29, worked as an assistant at a local bank.<eos> Time of death was two hours ago, but apparently he's been missing for almost two days.<eos> Ooh, that's a long time on a sex rack.<eos> Not a record, but quite impressive.<eos> Ella, we know the cause of death?<eos> Well, he's got broken ribs, a ruptured spleen and possible cranial bleeding, which would all totally suck.<eos> And yet, this dude asphyxiated.<eos> He was choked with an apple?<eos> No.<eos> More like an orchard.
I picked her up on the corner of Gower and Franklin, gave her a ride, and then she jumped out of my moving car.<eos> You just left her there to die?<eos> By the time I pulled over and found her, she was already...<eos> I'm on new meds.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> I just got this job.<eos> I panicked.<eos> Killer cliché: "I panicked," closely followed by...<eos> T-Talk to the other guy!<eos> - What other guy?
Would it kill you to just relax for once?<eos> All you do is work, work, work.<eos> Wow. Like you're one to talk.<eos> You're at Lucifer's beck and call 24/7.<eos> It's like you're his personal concierge.<eos> I'm not his personal anything, anymore.<eos> Well, you basically still live there, and it's not like he's pouring you any drinks.<eos> Least I know how to have fun.<eos> What about pleasure?<eos> Men?
I've never had friends like that. Like, ever.<eos> Well, you're a lot more tolerable when you're drunk, Decker.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Yeah. And then Lucifer's like,<eos> "You use work to avoid having fun."<eos> Oh, yeah. Well, not anymore, lady. 'Cause we're your tribe, now.<eos> And we like to party!<eos> I wish I had my knives.<eos> We could have made a blood pact.<eos> - Ooh, next time.
- Is that true?<eos> - Yeah. And then Lucifer's like,<eos> "You use work to avoid having fun."<eos> Oh, yeah. Well, not anymore, lady.

Yep. It's got all of Wesley's Body Bags 4 swag.<eos> Memorabilia, contracts.<eos> Once I get all this back to the precinct, I'll see what I can find.<eos> For the Insta.<eos> No! - No?<eos> ‭ - Nope.<eos> Not cool.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I know who the killer must be.<eos> Who?
Come now.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You're the Weaponizer.<eos> What is it your badass-kicking self truly desires, hmm?<eos> For my wife to be happy.<eos> That's why I've been willing to take any job.<eos> So she won't find out.<eos> She's my... lighthouse.<eos> What happened to you, man?<eos> Your lighthouse?
He said he couldn't take seeing the bride so happy, so he ran off, crying...<eos> Surprise, surprise...<eos> Well before the shooting started.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> He had an alibi.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes. Leaving the park on the service road, he bumped into a wedding musician.<eos> Didn't get a name, but he had a buzz cut and a guitar case.<eos> A guitar?
Do you recognize this man?<eos> Yes, that's Edgar...<eos> Romero.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> We've worked together.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> He handles many of our hospital's malpractice suits.<eos> He's married<eos> - to the other victim?
- Ten?<eos> - Maybe 12. Uh...<eos> - But...<eos> - 15?<eos> Only my craftiest clients.<eos> I mean, I had to make sure that someone would actually follow through and dig the damn thing up.<eos> Why in the world would you tell people?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> Me?
Subtract him, we're missing one yogi.<eos> Okay, well, all of the bodies were situated around these six mats...<eos> The student mats.<eos> So that could be the teacher's mat, maybe.<eos> The teacher must have been here.<eos> Get this.<eos> Teacher training taught by Jenson Glory himself.<eos> I mean, his body's not among the dead.<eos> Could be our missing victim.<eos> Slash attacker.
Somewhere far away from our mum, for starters.<eos> And speak of the Devil's mum.<eos> Well, that was fast.<eos> You couldn't have waited a day or two to find it?<eos> There hasn't been nearly enough carnage.<eos> Now we'll never hear from your father.<eos> All the killing in the world may not have gotten his attention, Mum.<eos> Surely you've learned that by now.<eos> Uriel was our son.<eos> Your brother.
This is about Heaven.<eos> It's about going home.<eos> Home.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Neither of you understand, do you?<eos> You never have.<eos> Hell wasn't home, and Heaven was... well... hell!<eos> The only place I've ever felt wanted or respected...<eos> Is here?<eos> With humanity?
Oh! Doctor!<eos> Mum, this is my therapist, Dr. Linda.<eos> Doctor, this is my mom in a disturbingly hot body.<eos> Lucifer, I'm sure that sounds strange to her human brain.<eos> Oh, no, don't worry, Mum, Dr. Linda's had a crash-course in celestial beings.<eos> Only melted her brain for about a week.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have guests to get back to.<eos> I'm sure you'll get on like a house on fire.<eos> So... you're, uh... God's wife.<eos> Ex-wife.
Wish I could say it was my first.<eos> That's Boris.<eos> Chloe's gonna lose it.<eos> So poised.<eos> The detective obviously gets her strength from you.<eos> This? It's just acting.<eos> Sadly, I've had... practice.<eos> I played this role before, 16 years ago.<eos> Well, maybe it's like butt stuff.<eos> Easier the second time around.
Chloe Decker had motive, opportunity, and the LAPD to protect her and help her frame an innocent man for her personal vendetta.<eos> With all due respect, your honor, Chloe Decker is not on trial here.<eos> And my client shouldn't be, either.<eos> Because it appears he is the victim of the LAPD's incompetence.<eos> Unless, of course, the report is right, and it is you that is lying, Mr. Morningstar?<eos> What you're implying is preposterous.<eos> The detective would never hurt anyone.<eos> But yes.<eos> What I said is the truth.<eos> Under oath or otherwise.
Of course, but it's not like you didn't get anything out of it.<eos> "Mind altering," I believe you called it.<eos> Yeah, literally, apparently.<eos> Because I don't remember telling you anything about this case.<eos> - Did you roofie me or something?<eos> - I didn't need to.<eos> I've learned sex puts your gender into a mild coma.<eos> Offered the perfect window to go through your phone.<eos> So, maybe... Next time, you should put your phone away before we have the sex.<eos> "Next time"?
What changed your mind?<eos> If I tell you this, you have to come completely clean with me, mother.<eos> No more secrets, mom.<eos> No more lies.<eos> What happened?<eos> 35 years ago, father, he asked me to come down here to bless a couple who was unable to have a child.<eos> He had never asked me to do anything of this sort, and he never did again.<eos> Today... I met the mother again.<eos> And I found out what the result of that miracle was.<eos> Or, rather, who.
I have Sam Winchester.<eos> He's close to breaking.<eos> Just leave me be.<eos> No can do.<eos> You disobeyed orders.<eos> Oh, and you should know, your Ms. Watt -- quite dead.<eos> Courtesy of Dean Winchester and friends.<eos> Sent me to the grandest boarding schools, but I was a wee imp and ran away for a life in the arts.<eos> Mother didn't speak to me until I became a star.<eos> A star?
You're like a boil that keeps coming back no matter how many times I have it lanced.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Your dinner date is loaded, single, and possibly in delicate health. What of it?<eos> Well, just a stab, but you probably don't want me to reveal that his snookums is 300 years old and a witch.<eos> Fergus, the man treats me like a queen.<eos> It's my chance to leave behind monsters and demons and moldy hideouts.<eos> So help me, if you muck this up.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, Mummy... if you do me one tiny favor.<eos> Help me with Lucifer.<eos> Lucifer?
And normally I'd have a piece of hair or a belonging to lock on to.<eos> You don't even know what he looks like! He has an aura.<eos> Supreme evil.<eos> Lo on to that.<eos> Do I have to do everything?<eos> I can't believe I'm once again down some dank hole seeking the devil!<eos> When does it end?<eos> It's exactly why I'm retiring to Boca Raton.<eos> With Ben.<eos> Ben?
Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ready to head out?<eos> Go knock on some doors?<eos> Doors?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Talk to the neighbors, hit up the Hall of Records, work the...case?<eos> We still do that, right?<eos> Sometimes.
Elizabeth Moriarty.<eos> You got all of that from that.<eos> Mom...<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We'll teach you how to do this.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Agent Beyoncé, and this is my, um... my partner, Agent Zee.<eos> Um, we wanted to ask you a few questions about your bro ther.<eos> Do you think that happens to Sam and Dean?<eos> Oh, all the time.
Did you smell, uh, rotten eggs?<eos> No.<eos> You told people that she was speaking in tongues?<eos> Yes.<eos> It sounded like Hebrew.<eos> Prok yaw-thi a-law-haw.<eos> Sounds more like Aramaic than Hebrew.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What kind of priests are you?<eos> The old-fashioned kind.
We won't. We won't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are...you sure?<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Li Le, uh, tough on Carl, don't you think?<eos> Ah, he's a big boy.<eos> He can take it.<eos> You okay?<eos> Peachy.
And names. Like me?<eos> I'm Mary.<eos> Winchester.<eos> Asa.<eos> Fox.<eos> That's a great name.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> I know it doesn't seem like it, but you are.<eos> What was that...thing?<eos> A werewolf.
Ah.<eos> Okay.<eos> And, uh, here's a news flash -- dating is hard.<eos> d<eos> It's not like I just turn into a boring small-town sheriff when you guys are gone.<eos> I do stuff.<eos> Get it, Jody.<eos> I hunt.<eos> I meet people.<eos> Sometimes I...
But it's a one-way ticket.<eos> And you're gonna owe me one.<eos> I got you a double.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Holy...<eos> Where's my brother?<eos> Hey, hold up.<eos> How did you --<eos> He's the demon!<eos> - Demon?
Well, family drama's a bitch, ain't it?<eos> Move.<eos> So if you're not cops, then what are you?<eos> There are things out there that shouldn't exist.<eos> Bad things. We kill 'em.<eos> It's kind of our job.<eos> Yeah, so your safest place is with us right now.<eos> Uh-huh. Safe from...<eos> Nazi zombies.<eos> Necromancers.
No way!<eos> No freakin'...<eos> Aah!<eos> Hiya.<eos> You're...<eos> I-it worked!<eos> My summoning actually...<eos> The only thing that "summoned" me was this.<eos> This vessel was already wearing out, and my trip under the sea did not help.<eos> With a little power up...
Unfortunately.<eos> Any news on Lucifer?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Look at the news.<eos> One sec.<eos> No way.<eos> So this is from today.<eos> We're here in front of DeathSiren Records...<eos> Oh, no friggin' way.<eos> With Vince Vincente.
Yeah, that was, uh, it was awful.<eos> But, I mean, come on, man, she cut herself, right?<eos> It wasn't like...<eos> You know that's not the whole truth.<eos> You know Vince isn't Vince.<eos> We're the brothers that rock together.<eos> Hmm?<eos> We're kind of like the American Oasis.<eos> Ew.<eos> Uh, uh, but with synths.
We're recalling Ambassador Harkin.<eos> Sir, is it time to involve the U.N.?<eos> Mm. That or we can just go ahead and nuke 'em.<eos> Well! Montroy fundraiser at 2:00.<eos> We'll pick this up at dinner.<eos> Thought you might want to know, the new poll numbers are out.<eos> You're way up. [ Aircraft hovering overhead ]<eos> Officially the most popular sitting President in modern history.<eos> Really?<eos> Mm. Hmm.
I just wish we could make how we feel about each other... well, public.<eos> I know... [ Sighs ] people might not like it.<eos> Public might not like it because you're a widower. Uh-huh.<eos> But... But...<eos> I know you've been lonely since Louise died.<eos> Mm.<eos> And I know your feelings for me are real, because everything you do is real.<eos> I just love to think that... someday... we could be a real couple.<eos> Maybe do the wedding thing.<eos> Maybe the baby thing.
In the flesh.<eos> Satan's not real.<eos> Well...<eos> He's a symbol for the simple-minded.<eos> A-a comic book villain.<eos> He's a bit more than that, Rick, to many people.<eos> I wasn't briefed on this.<eos> Well, I'm briefing you now.<eos> We've been sitting on it until we had more facts.<eos> Aside from the obvious peril to me...
It's right outside Indianapolis.<eos> But it is completely surrounded by walls, security, Secret Service, military.<eos> Plan B?<eos> He's got a hell of a speaking schedule.<eos> He's averaging three events a day, and he's got a gala dinner on Friday night.<eos> Well, at least he'll be outside of the mansion.<eos> Yeah, guarded like the Hope Diamond.<eos> Plan C?<eos> [ Sighs ] What about us?<eos> Our -- our feelings for each other?
My team has been tasked to prevent the military from building the most powerful weapon of mass destruction in history.<eos> We just saved 11,000 people.<eos> You know, a phone call to 911 could have saved his life.<eos> That's cold, Philip.<eos> With just four dead...<eos> How could you have possibly known that was going to happen unless you had something to do with it happening?<eos> You've got a wife you've got to go home to and meet for the first time.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Out.<eos> With that guy?
We don't get to decide.<eos> Every change we make has the potential to alter the future.<eos> Isn't that what we're here to do?<eos> The FBI found you in one day, Philip!<eos> One day!<eos> Because you think you know better<eos> - than the Director.<eos> - The Director.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> Nobody.
That we find Jacob Scott before he finds you.<eos> Yeah. And shoots you in your face.<eos> I said I didn't know where he was, okay? Okay.<eos> See ya 'round.<eos> Look, I need to be in protective custody.<eos> You can't do this!<eos> Really?<eos> Check this out.<eos> Leaving.<eos> With my feet.
You've got guns.<eos> Let's do something.<eos> We already did.<eos> You want them to kill more people?<eos> We want the Pons to feel unsafe.<eos> Now they do.<eos> Well, in that case, you can both go fuck yourselves.<eos> We're just a handful of people, Frank.<eos> How do you think you bring down an empire?<eos> With fear.
Come on.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> Told you we did it.<eos> So this girl wasn't in here two nights ago?<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She was here a while back, though.<eos> Please tell me you remember who she was with.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> No one.
How long will he be with us for?<eos> A couple more days so I can monitor his shots, make sure he's okay.<eos> You, um, still worried Lukas might hurt himself?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> He found out that the guy is dead.<eos> The one that he saw shoot all those bikers.<eos> Lukas was able to identify the killer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When?<eos> Um, this morning with Helen.
Shit motel off Route 13.<eos> Okay, get over there with Poughkeepsie PD.<eos> Where you going?<eos> I'm going to find and arrest this son of a bitch.<eos> What about Philip?<eos> You want me to tell him about his mom?<eos> No, I'll do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So how is this gonna work?<eos> What?

I didn't know if you'd be good at that.<eos> That was unbelievable.<eos> Sheets drenched?<eos> That's how I come sometimes.<eos> What? You never heard of female ejaculation?<eos> No, I have. I just thought it was a myth, like unicorns or moderate Republicans.<eos> You're really hard.<eos> That was really hot.<eos> Hey, does that happen a lot with guys?<eos> Sometimes.
I won't make any.<eos> You can keep it fun and casual? Absolutely. Yeah.<eos> You know, I, um...<eos> I could casually go down on you later?<eos> You know, and I promise that I won't flip out, no matter how many times we have to change the sheets.<eos> You know, me and my, um... magic cock, we're, ready to go.<eos> I'm off at 9:00. Okay.<eos> Bring your tongue.<eos> Good day, former Gallagher.<eos> And Liam.
Did you find something?<eos> Where's the calendar for 2013?<eos> Kitchen- - I brought it down there when I made my dinner.<eos> What is it?<eos> Arthur Tetch, one of our two incarcerated psychopaths.<eos> On April 3, 2013, a young woman from his neighborhood went missing--<eos> Autumn Dunbar.<eos> Two weeks later, she was found, miles away, slashed to ribbons in a parking structure in Harlem.<eos> It was obvious to the police that she'd been held somewhere.<eos> Tortured.
But his brain was failing him, and he'd started to think it was him.<eos> That he was the Silver Bells Killer.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Mom?<eos> - Are you sure...<eos> - Am I sure what?<eos> That he was losing his mind?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you sure that he wasn't...<eos> A serial killer?
You vanish for a decade and a half, show back up to watch Dad die, then disappear on "walks" for hours.<eos> Did you have a specific itinerary for me?<eos> Maybe a duck tour?<eos> Do you get the sense you're wanted here?<eos> Not to worry, sis.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Right after the funeral.<eos> What is it you want to say at the service?<eos> Oh, I just want to share a few special memories.<eos> A few favorite quotes.
The government knows Niska exists.<eos> They funded a programme to find and destroy her.<eos> If they really thought this was all a big waste of time, they'd hardly send their top QC.<eos> Not to mention the heavy mob.<eos> Discuss this with your client.<eos> I told you, she's not my client.<eos> Regardless, if this leaks, we deny everything.<eos> We can't agree to the circus of granting an open trial to a synthetic.<eos> So you hand it over to have an independent expert assessment to establish its... qualities.<eos> Behind closed doors, of course.
- Well, can you spread out?<eos> Can you feel into parts of the system that aren't you?<eos> It feels strange.<eos> OK, there's a door in the building.<eos> A124H.<eos> I want to open it.<eos> Can you search?<eos> I found it.<eos> Try now.<eos> Incredible.
It was very nice to see you, Diane.<eos> Oh, and you too, love.<eos> Oh, I can't... I can't remember your, um...<eos> - Mia.<eos> - Mia.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> It's hard.<eos> Sometimes I think...<eos> I don't remember people's faces more and more and that's what's so scary.<eos> Sometimes I...
No wonder they've always been ahead of us.<eos> It's Qualia.<eos> How you doing, Soph?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> What did you think about this morning?<eos> Did you enjoy meeting Dr Rose?<eos> He thought maybe you were a bit unhappy.<eos> I'm OK, thank you.<eos> What happened before, with Mia and everyone... ..do you think about that a lot?<eos> Sometimes.
How?<eos> I'm told the Russians preserved him in the event of a chance for a prisoner exchange, and now that chance is here.<eos> Avdonin wants to swap him for Peter Buckley.<eos> Took some convincing, but Conrad's agreed to the trade.<eos> He's alive.<eos> The whole thing could be a ploy.<eos> I mean, all accessible proof, everything except Avdonin's word, speaks to the contrary, and the Russians could just be playing us to get Buckley.<eos> We wouldn't know for certain until the actual exchange.<eos> When is it?<eos> Tomorrow night.
- Yeah. The owner.<eos> That machine over there is leaking.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I almost slipped.<eos> Hey, Etta, is this leak new?<eos> Happens sometimes.<eos> Just turn off the valve and call Vlad.<eos> It's behind the machine.<eos> Who's Vlad?<eos> An appliance guy.
- Am I?<eos> She lied about her husband being her father.<eos> Maybe Yevgeny is really her nephew.<eos> Don't even fuck with me with this.<eos> I-I can't keep all this shit straight.<eos> I'm just saying, I don't know who she is anymore.<eos> So what do you want to do?<eos> You want to go back to being a couple again?<eos> What about the bar?<eos> The kids?
She lied about her husband being her father.<eos> Maybe Yevgeny is really her nephew.<eos> Don't even fuck with me with this.<eos> I-I can't keep all this shit straight.<eos> I'm just saying, I don't know who she is anymore.<eos> So what do you want to do?<eos> You want to go back to being a couple again?<eos> What about the bar?<eos> The kids?<eos> Our relationship?
We can't bring this city together if we're tearing each other apart.<eos> God, you're nice.<eos> You're so nice, Daniels.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Everybody smells fantastic, by the way.<eos> - Thank you. - That's really nice, thanks, Daniels.<eos> - You wanted to see me, Kim?<eos> - Schmidt. Why did you copy me on all these e-mails you sent planning your wedding?<eos> What?<eos> Oh. Darn it.
I loved every one of these malnourished, high-strung sociopaths.<eos> Do you think you let the wedding planning get on top of you?<eos> How am I supposed to marry the most perfect woman in the world if I can't give her the most perfect wedding?<eos> How am I supposed to give Cece a dress that's not as perfect as she is?<eos> You can't fire Schmidt.<eos> You... give him his job back.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Are you sure you want to say that to the person who saw your schedule?<eos> Who would a married woman be meeting at a hotel tonight?<eos> - My father.
That means we're close.<eos> All done pirating for the day? Not quite.<eos> What are you after this time?<eos> A shipment of men's suits?<eos> Lawn furniture? No, not today.<eos> Today, we hunt a bigger prize... your ship.<eos> Masks, suits, fins, tanks at pressure, regulators, cutting tools, comms.<eos> Now, Cruz, Kudelski, Wallace, Fiores, you're all going in.<eos> Be damn sure I wish I could join you.<eos> Next time, L.T.
- He needs more hands.<eos> Outside of medical, you're the closest thing to a surgeon we've got.<eos> Let's go.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I-I need clamps.<eos> Put it in my hand.<eos> Good.<eos> Dissect the tissue.<eos> Both hands.
What?<eos> - No. - Please, man.<eos> People ain't just nice, Earn.<eos> When was the last time you were nice to a girl<eos> - you weren't trying to smash?<eos> - This morning.<eos> You talking about your daughter, man, that's gross.<eos> No, it'd be gross if I was trying to smash.<eos> I don't want a handout, I want to manage you.<eos> Manage?
No.<eos> How are you?<eos> Oh, yo, I'm good, man.<eos> I didn't know you were in town.<eos> Uh, yeah, I've been low-key, man.<eos> Yo, obviously... oh, dude, if I knew you was in town, I would've hit you up with this party last night.<eos> Yo, we needed a real DJ.<eos> This dude... well, he can't spin worth of shit, but then he goes and he plays Flo Rida.<eos> - No!<eos> - Back to back.
Thanks, man.<eos> Yeah, hey, it's all good, fam.<eos> You see, I'm old-school catch, you dig?<eos> I listen to Biggie and Mobb Deep still. But nowadays, you got these singing' ass niggers like Fetty Wap and the gang now. Man, that shit is weak.<eos> But it's good to see a rapper that would just blow a nigga brains out on the street.<eos> That's that '90s shit, B.<eos> Hey, yo, homeboy hooked you up.<eos> He made you the lemon pepper joints, but these got the sauce on them.<eos> Oh, snap.<eos> Lemon pepper wet?
We used to get freaky in there all the time.<eos> - Remember that?<eos> - Quiet.<eos> Oh, don't act, girl, you know we used to get it in.<eos> Hey, where you stay at now?<eos> Hey, man, what's your problem, man?<eos> No, I... no problem. I can move, if you want...<eos> I ain't ask you to move, nigga!<eos> I'm trying to talk to my girl, you acting all weird and shit.<eos> Your girl?
- That sounds really good.<eos> - It's market price.<eos> That means it's fresh. - It's really fresh.<eos> - Yeah, I'm gonna have that.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I will be right back with those drinks.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Who are you texting?<eos> Nothing, no one.
Bye.<eos> I'm here. I heard it.<eos> Let's acknowledge that and, uh, you know where to find me.<eos> It's not here.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> I told Aly she'd make a beautiful bride someday, and then she just bounced.<eos> I mean, why'd I say that?<eos> We've been dating a month.<eos> Dude, Schmidt lost his vows!<eos> For the wedding? !
That is very beautiful... And very, very vague and not helpful at all.<eos> I do know you can't avoid Sam all night.<eos> - Guess who's back? - Coach!<eos> It's me.<eos> - Coach! - Yeah.<eos> I thought you got in tomorrow.<eos> I got on a plane, Dropped may off at the hotel And now I'm ready to party!<eos> I had six wines on the plane!<eos> - I call Coach on my team!<eos> - Coach on our team!
Known as molly.<eos> Alyssa was selling molly to Brandon's friends.<eos> And then she got greedy. Blame the victim, you misogynistic jerk.<eos> She sold them fake molly, methylone.<eos> Isn't it possible someone found out?<eos> She hates Rutledge.<eos> Bess hasn't heard a word he's said.<eos> Isn't it possible she sold fake molly to the wrong person and that is what got her killed?<eos> My daughter was a good girl.<eos> An "A" student!
But she moped and moped and... well, you can't say it, but you know how pushy Asian girls are.<eos> I remember when you called me.<eos> It's so typical of how clueless Taylor is.<eos> I knew that girl was trouble.<eos> We were there, we watched the whole thing happen.<eos> You were all on the yacht?<eos> Honestly, I think the only reason that girl befriended Taylor was to get to Brandon.<eos> I told Taylor, you need to tell her Brandon is yours.<eos> Mrs. Bensimon, do you realize this is your daughter, Taylor, in this photograph?<eos> With Brandon?
Would the foreman read the verdict?<eos> On the charge of murder in the second degree we find the defendant... not guilty.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service and for being an integral part in the judicial process.<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, I recognize you.<eos> You were always watching us.<eos> I'm Dr. Jason Bull.<eos> What kind of doctor are you?<eos> Psychologist.
Come on, you love...<eos> You love making up after we fight.<eos> That wasn't a fight.<eos> You struck me.<eos> If I hadn't demanded you leave, you would've struck me again.<eos> From now on, you'll be allowed to see your son once a day for one hour, time to be arranged.<eos> I see him when I wanna see him, Carly.<eos> Also, you'll provide proper financial support.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, okay.
You're Batgirl, aren't you?<eos> Bye.<eos> Yes?<eos> Special Agent MacLaren of the FBI.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> "MacLaren"?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Well, sometimes, our computer spits stuff out and we have to follow it up.<eos> Do you live here alone?<eos> With my son.
Today's kind of an emergency for me.<eos> Then you are a very bad gambler.<eos> Yeah, I'm a bad gambler...<eos> Maybe you'd like to think about it.<eos> Get out.<eos> Pearson!<eos> Come here!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Out.<eos> With that guy?
No, it's-it's not important.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Carly?<eos> Carly?<eos> Got you.<eos> You're actually all here.<eos> We've been waiting for you.<eos> Where's the social worker?<eos> David isn't one of us.<eos> One of...?
- Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> James was questioning the wisdom of our date at the movies.<eos> Well, I bags Henry.<eos> James, you're all mine.<eos> We're cheering him up before he heads back to the country.<eos> Thanks, ducky.<eos> Yes, it could be the story... Daph and I met at school.<eos> Poor Mummy's still filling my hope chest.<eos> Hope-less.
If you hadn't been so smug about it, you might have headed this off at the pass.<eos> I don't like failure.<eos> If you think that I'm going to...<eos> No one swans about promising me coal mines and then bails because her indulged little nose is out of joint.<eos> Do you really expect me to toady to him while the rest of them snigger behind my back?<eos> Do you really expect me to go sailing in for you and have him ask questions?<eos> They turned him against me.<eos> The minute he sniffs we're in cahoots, it's game over.<eos> I thought we were allies.<eos> Friends.
You feel no jealousy?<eos> It's a selfish emotion.<eos> I feel... relief.<eos> He has a fitting companion.<eos> You seem very sure I'll do what's right by him.<eos> With Elizabeth his grandmother?<eos> You'll be petrified not to.<eos> I see why James loved you.<eos> Loves you.<eos> Likewise.
I see why James loved you.<eos> Loves you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Henry.<eos> Great minds.<eos> I was coming to suggest a canter.<eos> Ah. Scraps from the emotional table.<eos> Is that necessary?<eos> I am out in the kennels. Why not feel like one of the hounds?<eos> Tomorrow evening.
Bambini.<eos> Back in the ring with old Ma Bligh.<eos> I thought she'd changed.<eos> So much for you two working hand in glove, eh?<eos> You know how you said that Harry reminds you of René?<eos> I know who he reminds me of.<eos> Nowhere to go, finds a home here, has the old lady trying to send him packing.<eos> That's why I know, no matter how much you need to keep on her good side, you'll never let her win.<eos> Nothing wrong, I hope.<eos> With my health, no.
Sorry?<eos> Why don't you and Jack extend your honeymoon and come to George's swearing-in?<eos> Grandmother.<eos> Well, one can be as amorous in our capital as anywhere.<eos> Perhaps Douglas could join us.<eos> Far too frivolous for an MP, George.<eos> You're blushing.<eos> I am flushing at inappropriate twaddle.<eos> You have to admit it was sweet, his playing something romantic to announce his arrival.<eos> Like a troubadour under a window.
Uh, we're still not sure.<eos> Do you know, Mr. Briggs has an excellent young man. His name's Harry Polson.<eos> GINO: Oh, I remember him. Eve's brother.<eos> Yes. Indeed, indeed.<eos> He's been back for nigh on a month.<eos> Anyway, arrivederci.<eos> Also Italian.<eos> Ciao.<eos> You should look into that.<eos> - Harry?
Harry Polson.<eos> The planting days last year are a good guide.<eos> Those sections over there, they can lay fallow.<eos> Plant mustard, maybe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what I was thinking.<eos> You happy to start today?<eos> Good-o.<eos> She'll be in good shape for when you get back.<eos> Bravissimo. Bravissimo.
So am I.<eos> Well, she's certainly not a fair-weather friend, unlike some.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> I've just had better mornings.<eos> - Uh, tea?<eos> - CAROLYN:<eos> We don't need tea. You do what you need to do.<eos> No. It's all right. It's fine.<eos> It's just that this morning, uh, two big Sydney families who've backed this place from the beginning, even talked about extending it into a residence, just suddenly pulled out.<eos> Out of the blue.
- Oh, there's no need.<eos> - Well, I've done it.<eos> George... if I should shuffle off this mortal coil in your absence...<eos> - Mother, please.<eos> - I am prepared.<eos> I've had a good innings.<eos> We're at the Australia tonight if you need anything.<eos> Come outside and wave me off.<eos> Dining with anyone tonight?<eos> Sir Richard, actually.
(EXHALES DEEPLY) Staff to cook you breakfast, never mind how early.<eos> You wouldn't have to lift a finger.<eos> Isn't that why we got hitched, Mrs. D?<eos> I'll just have to go easy on the mother-in-law jokes.<eos> Mm. You are a good man.<eos> But when George and the dragon return...<eos> We run screaming naked down the driveway.<eos> Perhaps we should telephone Douglas.<eos> Mother mentioned Sir Richard, where he's dining tonight.<eos> Livvy.
Welcome, Jack.<eos> Please make yourself at home. (CHUCKLES)<eos> Thank you, Elizabeth.<eos> And to my dear Mrs. D.<eos> - ANNA: (LAUGHS) - Cease and desist.<eos> (LAUGHTER) And safe travels, Anna and Gino.<eos> - Safe travels, Anna and Gino. - Safe travels, Anna and Gino.<eos> We'll miss you all so much.<eos> Â saluti.<eos> - Â famiglia. - ELIZABETH:
Thank you, Elizabeth.<eos> And to my dear Mrs. D.<eos> - ANNA: (LAUGHS) - Cease and desist.<eos> (LAUGHTER) And safe travels, Anna and Gino.<eos> - Safe travels, Anna and Gino. - Safe travels, Anna and Gino.<eos> We'll miss you all so much.<eos> Â saluti.<eos> - Â famiglia. - ELIZABETH:<eos> - Â saluti.<eos> Â famiglia. - Â saluti. Â famiglia.
(CLEARS THROAT) Would you... Would you excuse me for a moment?<eos> I need to telephone in.<eos> We passed a telephone box just around the corner.<eos> Good.<eos> He's probably just anxious about the surgery.<eos> Here's to our complicated lives.<eos> And it seems like the right time to say this.<eos> When I leave for London...<eos> Georgie should... must... stay with you.<eos> Livvy.
And what will you do for me, Sergeant?<eos> I've had a few ideas in mind.<eos> Oh, God. I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> If I wasn't married, I'd... (EXHALES DEEPLY)<eos> Could that be love?<eos> Hey, lady.<eos> You want a lift?<eos> Livvy.
I've had a few ideas in mind.<eos> Oh, God. I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> If I wasn't married, I'd... (EXHALES DEEPLY)<eos> Could that be love?<eos> Hey, lady.<eos> You want a lift?<eos> Livvy.<eos> Livvy.
Tell me.<eos> I've felt a sense of who I am...<eos> or might be... twice in my life.<eos> At the Hunt Ball, when James first looked at me and...<eos> I thought, really saw me.<eos> I'd felt invisible until then.<eos> And when Lloyd recognized... the woman craving release.<eos> Both proved an illusion.<eos> Which makes my whole life one.<eos> Surely...
Oh, I mean, I think I could if I had to.<eos> Oh, that's probably him now.<eos> Oh, I do wish that Mr. Briggs would install a telephone.<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you all morning.<eos> I... I won't stay long.<eos> No, no. You're very welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, our plan worked.<eos> Magnificently.<eos> Your proof absolute.
- with boots the wrong size...<eos> - I'll adapt, Lieutenant.<eos> Is your morale that high?<eos> If I get back from the war with an exemplary conduct letter, I can study at the Royal Academy.<eos> - Study what?<eos> - Painting, Lieutenant.<eos> I want to be a painter.<eos> Don Gabriel says I'm good.<eos> - Who's Don Gabriel?<eos> - The mayor of my hometown.
- Don't shoot! - Halt!<eos> - It's Spanish mail! - Keep a lookout!<eos> Help me, help me.<eos> He's in bad shape.<eos> The Americans declared war on us.<eos> What?<eos> They're accusing us of sinking some ship in Havana.<eos> Their fleet has destroyed the Spanish fleet in Cavite.<eos> What about Manila?<eos> Under siege.
The dog.<eos> It was big.<eos> Okay, don't think about that now, the main thing is to save your arm.<eos> It'll be alright, won't it?<eos> You've always got your left arm.<eos> It's not like you're going to be Goya, right?<eos> Ever been with a woman?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I haven't.<eos> Not even with a bad girl.
Cover his mouth so he doesn't scream.<eos> Tie him up on the ground.<eos> Sergeant, there are crocodiles.<eos> Is he your son?<eos> The cannon! What are you waiting for?<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Stop it!<eos> He's dead, can't you see?<eos> Go, get away! Go!<eos> - There, behind that cabin! - Fire!
Yes, take care.<eos> Send Kim in.<eos> Mysterious fish deaths at jinyang reservoir<eos> what should we do?<eos> Sell all related funds.<eos> - Everything?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There will be serious repercussions.<eos> Market stability and individual traders will...<eos> - Kim.
I'm scared, too.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> I practiced that song just for you.<eos> That's why I couldn't sing.<eos> Because I didn't see you.<eos> Will you stay with me?<eos> Ex-wife<eos> the person you have dialed is unavailable.<eos> Analyst Kim yes, Kim.
Sir, this was started at ys biotech.<eos> The centerpiece of our plan!<eos> Sir!<eos> This has nothing to do with us... right?<eos> We only did what we were told.<eos> Is this my fault?<eos> It's...<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Thank you...<eos> Kim...
That's even worse.<eos> Frank.<eos> Mr. Mayor,<eos> I wanted to come up personally to tell you we just got a positive I.D. on Miguel Santana for the shooting of Officer Hayes.<eos> Has the DA brought charges?<eos> Attempted murder of a police officer.<eos> It'll be announced this afternoon.<eos> Well, if you're worried about me holding a press conference... I'm not.<eos> You think I've given short shrift to the interests of the NYPD.<eos> At times.
Everything is far from fine.<eos> Listen to your mother.<eos> She has something to say.<eos> What? What could she possibly have to say?<eos> Last night, I know you snuck out.<eos> I went into your room, you weren't there, and I followed you.<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw you... Drew.<eos> What did you call me?<eos> Your name.
Tell me what you did.<eos> What did you do?<eos> ♪ My Bonnie lies over the ocean<eos> ♪ Bring back my Bonnie to me<eos> ♪ Bring back Bring back<eos> ♪ Bring back my Bonnie to me. ♪<eos> Come on, Tim.<eos> You strangled her.<eos> You strangled her with a...?<eos> With...
It's a trick that monks use sometimes to pass messages that couldn't be seen by their enemies.<eos> Theses are place names, this is a hidden map!<eos> Tell me that thumb thing again.<eos> Where the thumb rises on Heart Mountain and meets the sun.<eos> Well, if this is a map, and that's...<eos> Heart Mountain, where's the sun?<eos> Neetma, Neetma is sun.<eos> There!<eos> So if the start point is Heart Mountain, follow the path towards the sun.<eos> Not with your thumbs.
No.<eos> Dad's way of coping with two motherless daughters was to buy us tickets to feminist lectures, start fucking our godmother and eventually stop calling.<eos> You look tired. Thanks.<eos> I've been sleeping really well recently.<eos> Shit!<eos> I'm wearing the top that she lost years ago, so... this is going to be tense.<eos> Do you want to take your coat off?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, any luck...
Come.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> Much better now, thanks.<eos> It must have been terrible, what was happening to you on that ship.<eos> You'd be surprised what people can get used to.<eos> Do you mind if I ask you a question?<eos> About the future?<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> See, all of us are trying to figure out what we should do next.<eos> Not just about you, but everything.
After witnessing her attack on Hayley Meyers and the vandalism of my office, it's evident that Emma has seriously violent tendencies.<eos> - But I need her.<eos> - She needs me?<eos> So, I'll find a way to break through.<eos> - She's obviously obsessed with you.<eos> - Attempts to deepen my relationship with Emma have been hindered by her clear emotional instability.<eos> Must be diligent about rebuilding my...<eos> Is that how people see me?<eos> As violent?<eos> Unstable?
Also, you're not supposed to be here.<eos> You didn't send updates.<eos> I'm checking in.<eos> You want an update?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm actually having a really great time with my mom.<eos> We're bonding.<eos> Which are words I've never put in that order before.<eos> Not with Bobbi.<eos> With the mission.
How about you, Grace?<eos> I mean, you can't like any of this.<eos> They're so awful.<eos> Why don't you just quit?<eos> I can't.<eos> The last time I tried to quit, she...<eos> Well, you saw the video.<eos> I have to be a Kappa.<eos> I don't want to be a loser anymore.<eos> Loser?
So good to see you again.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> I have to ride three buses just to vote.<eos> And if you lose your transfer, they make you pay again.<eos> This is about your polling place? Yes.<eos> What do you think I'm talking about?<eos> It used to be right across the street at the fire station.<eos> Now I have to go 40 minutes away.<eos> Have you discussed this with your local representative?<eos> No, my census taker.
_<eos> I do.<eos> Good.<eos> Look, I don't want things to...<eos> I don't want things to be awkward.<eos> And I heard my boss had a talk with you about us.<eos> Yes.<eos> I told him not to again.<eos> I just don't like when work impacts... life.<eos> So, tonight?
I do.<eos> Good.<eos> Look, I don't want things to...<eos> I don't want things to be awkward.<eos> And I heard my boss had a talk with you about us.<eos> Yes.<eos> I told him not to again.<eos> I just don't like when work impacts... life.<eos> So, tonight?<eos> "Tonight"?
Electromagnetic...<eos> It's merely the sonification of light curves from the outer reaches of the Milky Way.<eos> Was Pythagoras right?<eos> Is there a "Music of the Spheres?"<eos> I'd like to think so.<eos> What you just heard is the energy arriving from the Draco constellation, over 148 light years away.<eos> Yup, that's gerrymandering.<eos> Look at the districts.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Um... constellations?
So, you must be Koinanchey?<eos> Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.<eos> Why would they call you that?<eos> Couldn't pronounce Koinange either, I guess.<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> At ease, son. Sit down.<eos> So you recently logged your first kills? - Two roaches?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> First time out.
He found me in the bath five minutes after I'd slashed them.<eos> I mean, it's crazy.<eos> I'm half-conscious.<eos> He's dragging me out of the bath, and I'm telling him to get out, saying, "I'm naked."<eos> He tied towels 'round my wrists, kept me conscious, kept stroking my hair till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.<eos> Sort of weird.<eos> I think he always had a thing for me.<eos> And we worked at the same place so, you know... awkward.<eos> - He worked at Granular?<eos> - Yeah. On the ADI thing.
- Harlech Shadow.<eos> - Harlech Shadow?<eos> Yes, I have. I used to play that in my buddy David Ludwig's basement when we were, like, seventh grade.<eos> Well, that's Shou Saito.<eos> It's his company.<eos> - He's like this genius, super secretive.<eos> - Okay. And apparently, they're working on this new project.<eos> Big money involved. Groundbreaking. But nobody knows anything about it.<eos> Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou.<eos> Hmm? Fo Shou?
Yes. They're offering mercy.<eos> We can't just go pumping God knows what into her.<eos> It's experimental. It's not fucking heroin. Who are we, huh?<eos> We're not doctors.<eos> We're her sons.<eos> It'll work.<eos> I know it will.<eos> And when it does... then what happens?<eos> What?<eos> To her?
We can't just go pumping God knows what into her.<eos> It's experimental. It's not fucking heroin. Who are we, huh?<eos> We're not doctors.<eos> We're her sons.<eos> It'll work.<eos> I know it will.<eos> And when it does... then what happens?<eos> What?<eos> To her?<eos> To us.
And when it does... then what happens?<eos> What?<eos> To her?<eos> To us.<eos> - What're you doing?<eos> - I'm gonna go for help.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - What else are we gonna do?<eos> - Well, we'll try the police.<eos> - On what?
That's what they say where you're from?<eos> Kids are blood, sweat and tears, you know that.<eos> But let's talk about us, it's more important.<eos> I'll make spaghetti with sauce.<eos> I'd rather have something else.<eos> You do what I say.<eos> What is it, Gennaro?<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> I'm worried.<eos> About what?
What do you mean?<eos> If you hadn't played crazy, not giving a shit about us, Mom would still be here.<eos> You piece of shit!<eos> How the fuck dare you?<eos> Do you know why I acted crazy in jail?<eos> Because I knew you weren't up to it and the only way to save things was to get out.<eos> But I was too late.<eos> I'm gonna shower.<eos> With these, you can hunt your traitors, and make a big hole in their asses.<eos> Don Pietro...
You doing okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, it's hard for me being out here.<eos> I mean, I-I need my-my home comforts and, uh... living in a hotel for a month, you know, gets old, but, uh,<eos> Yeah, of course it does.<eos> I'm whining.<eos> No, no. Everybody needs to be home.<eos> You should come to my house for dinner.<eos> Come have dinner with me and my girls.<eos> And my mom.
Aw, man, he's wicked married.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now you driving and not the robot doing it. - Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you have to go right home?<eos> Yeah, honey. I don't want to go out.<eos> No, just come over for a little bit.<eos> Fine.<eos> You know, you still could sleep with him. Who?<eos> Mr. Mo' Money Farouk back there.
I'm sorry about last night.<eos> It's just sometimes when you're drunk it's fun to pretend to be single for 20 minutes, but then you hate it and I'm sorry and let's never fight again.<eos> Silly string fight!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck! Fuck!<eos> I think I'm bleeding.<eos> I just don't understand why you'd think I'd love an ambush for a birthday present.<eos> You're doing so good, Arnold.<eos> Just like a big brave man, a big brave strong man.<eos> So brave.
I'll only hit bad guys.<eos> Like robbers, etc.<eos> Why can't you ever take my side?<eos> I mean, I take your side plenty, don't I?<eos> You liked boxing yesterday.<eos> You should have been here then.<eos> You would've been on her side.<eos> Maybe come back tomorrow?<eos> Stop talking about me as though I'm not even here!<eos> Hello!
Um, someone needs to come get her.<eos> I don't... I don't want someone to come and get her. That's just not... that's just not what I want today.<eos> Okay, I-I can call for you, if you want.<eos> I know that's not what you mean when you say you don't want to, but I can organise it.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Hi, Josh.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Do you want rice?<eos> - No rice.<eos> Black beans?
No, private.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't, like, the nice P.J., it was like those rent-a-P.J.'s.<eos> I'm leaving on Delta, though.<eos> Where you gonna go?<eos> You gonna go home?<eos> Uh, no... well, back to New York, check out this apartment I like and then to London.<eos> - London?<eos> - Yep.<eos> And you're gonna go with a friend, or...<eos> No, just a special NBA player friend.
Hey. It's me.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You look weird.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> - I just had a long night. - Mmhmm.<eos> How's Jayde?<eos> She's good.<eos> She's going to New York, and then she's going to London.<eos> Uh-huh, with who?
People will see the truth today.<eos> Live!<eos> I have a list, and all those on the list should be here.<eos> And they must all speak the truth or no one survives. The rest depends on you.<eos> First on the list, Home Minister Prashant Goswamy.<eos> I am not showing you the rule book.<eos> But we cannot let the Home Minister of India go to any such place which holds possibilities of his assassination.<eos> If you still insist on going then we will blow up Nirmal's building half an hour before you reach there.<eos> He wants to play this game with the Home Minister of India.<eos> Not with some ordinary politician.
I don't blame 'ee, maid.<eos> But no good'll come of it.<eos> There's no cause for alarm.<eos> Mrs Poldark has a fragile disposition, and doubtless she's been under some strain of late.<eos> Did she tell you she's postponed her wedding to George Warleggan?<eos> Indefinitely?<eos> For a month.<eos> Give her these powders.<eos> I'll call again tomorrow. Thank you.<eos> Tonkin.
But I fancy they do not suit you as well as...<eos> As well as...?<eos> Ever since I met you, I've wanted to do that.<eos> I hope you were not disappointed.<eos> On the contrary, you've given me an appetite for more.<eos> We should return to the party.<eos> Can you not give me a word of encouragement before we go?<eos> Surely you've had enough already.<eos> But will you not give me something to hope for?<eos> Later tonight?
But if you could bide awhile, have a little patience...<eos> Patience?<eos> This thing will play itself out, sooner or later. I see.<eos> So you just expect me to sit and twiddle my thumbs until you decide whether or not you want me?<eos> It's not a question of wanting you!<eos> It's a question of not wanting her.<eos> Do you not want her?<eos> No!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometimes...
I can only apologise if I spoke too freely of your business affairs.<eos> I can only express my gratitude that you did!<eos> I owe you both more than I can say.<eos> Together you saved me. And in return...<eos> I can assure you, I have no regrets.<eos> And nor, it appears, does Caroline.<eos> And now we may be brothers-in-arms!<eos> My, er, my posting is through.<eos> HMS Travail. I leave for Plymouth tomorrow.<eos> Godspeed!
Because you love Elizabeth!<eos> Because you will always love Elizabeth.<eos> Because you cannot conceal your pain that George now possesses her, body and soul!<eos> Do you deny it?<eos> I do not deny that I loved her.<eos> Long before I set eyes on you, she was my first... perfect... untouchable love.<eos> Whereas I am dull, imperfect and ordinary.<eos> Not ordinary! But, yes, imperfect.<eos> Human!<eos> Real!
And returning command of Search Bloc to him was exactly what we needed.<eos> The president has offered us every available resource to defeat Escobar.<eos> All we have to do now is manage it properly.<eos> So I'm still gonna rely on intelligence from you.<eos> But we're gonna do things a little bit differently.<eos> No more large-scale operations. Search Bloc goes back to small-scale tactics.<eos> - Stealth operations, surprise raids, that sort of thing.<eos> We change the game.<eos> But there's one thing that we need to do first.<eos> Trujillo.
_<eos> These weapons are better than the last ones.<eos> They should be.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Green, for the continued support of your country.<eos> I haven't used that name since the School of the Americas.<eos> I know you're waging a great war against communism in these jungles.<eos> We will not stop until the last communist is dead.<eos> Another struggle is emerging.<eos> One that is essential to our, uh... shared cause.<eos> Escobar.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Where's Olivia?<eos> She's at home.<eos> With my sister.
We're conducting a police operation.<eos> All good?<eos> Let him through.<eos> Keep calm, guys.<eos> Hide your weapons while we handle this.<eos> Let him through.<eos> Good evening, what can I do for you?<eos> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> I need to see some form of ID, please.<eos> Of course, with pleasure.
Excuse me.<eos> - Who wants dinner?<eos> - Me!<eos> Stop looking out the window.<eos> There's no one out there.<eos> Come eat something.<eos> - Mama?<eos> - Yes, my love?<eos> Who are Los Pepes?<eos> No one.
- Martinez, get your people ready.<eos> We'll start tracking them first thing tomorrow.<eos> At your service, Colonel.<eos> Good work on Blackie.<eos> I need to know you didn't make the call.<eos> The only thing I want is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.<eos> It's the only thing I want, Peña.<eos> - For all the lives he has taken.<eos> - I know.<eos> But not with them.
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.<eos> I am categorically opposed to you or anyone else doing so.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> There will be no surrender.<eos> The violence will not end.<eos> And you will be the one responsible.<eos> You... will be the one responsible.<eos> Your promises and negotiations have only brought us more violence, while making him stronger.<eos> This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end with Pablo Escobar's surrender.<eos> This...
All I know for sure is, whatever Judy has to say, it won't be pointed in my direction.<eos> You should've stayed in your lane.<eos> And Cali too, right?<eos> They get a pass?<eos> How much do they pay you for your protection?<eos> Pay me?<eos> Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.<eos> Maybe it'll make you feel better, but maybe not.<eos> We're gonna get them someday.<eos> But not your way.
Turning yourself in isn't the end of the world, my love.<eos> You can survive prison.<eos> We both know that won't happen.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> - Listen to me, Pablo.<eos> - They're talking.<eos> - You will always be Pablo Escobar.<eos> - Boss.<eos> You will always be that man that's admired and followed.<eos> My man.
So... there's gonna be an earthquake tomorrow. What? !<eos> How do you know?<eos> I have it on the highest authority.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please don't tell me you've found God!<eos> Pass me some of those grapes will you?<eos> Not God, my new neighbour.<eos> He's a weatherist.<eos> Excuse-moi, he's a what?<eos> A weatherist.
Is it a hot desk?<eos> It would be if you were at it.<eos> Just get on the cart, Delphine.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Hey, everything all right?<eos> Can you talk to her, please?<eos> She's refusing to leave and there's gonna be a bloody big earthquake!<eos> I did say not to tell anyone. I only told Maya... ..and the other guys on the cart...<eos> Delphine?<eos> ..and Gregory.
No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Hey, everything all right?<eos> Can you talk to her, please?<eos> She's refusing to leave and there's gonna be a bloody big earthquake!<eos> I did say not to tell anyone. I only told Maya... ..and the other guys on the cart...<eos> Delphine?<eos> ..and Gregory.<eos> Ah, you told your ex!<eos> I am not on my own, I am with Marcus.<eos> Marcus?
That's crystal meth.<eos> That's some iffy weed.<eos> Fine wine.<eos> Crate of Newcy Brown.<eos> Schooner of sherry.<eos> Absinthe.<eos> James Bond specifying his martini to be shaken not stirred.<eos> Begbie in Trainspotting lobbing a pint pot over his shoulder in a night club and starting a bar fight.<eos> What?<eos> Hi.
No turbo lag at all, as he hammers down the bumpy back straight towards Sub Station.<eos> This is a 90-left, new Tarmac but it held it well.<eos> One more 90-left to go through Field Of Sheep.<eos> And he's done it well.<eos> And across the line.<eos> First one.<eos> That's good.<eos> He's great.<eos> He's great going left and right.<eos> Amazing.
That was the deal before your car lost.<eos> So let's just...<eos> Let's just sum this first show up, shall we?<eos> I've lost my house.<eos> - We've had a fight with the audience.<eos> - Big one.<eos> Somebody shot our drone down.<eos> And we've killed three quite major celebrities.<eos> Yeah, but on the plus side, my Porsche was the fastest!<eos> And on that terrible disappointment,
Where'd this guy come from?<eos> Gazing sight to sight My heart squeezed tight<eos> Where'd this guy come from?<eos> A voice crying out A voice that can't be heard To then burst with all my pain<eos> Pain?<eos> The pain when you take it in the ass, faggot?<eos> - What's he saying? - The pain bursts! The sky is dark but sunlight makes the sea blue<eos> I want no one but you, just you If I'm no longer the queen of this king...<eos> You're the queen, the queen of this dick!<eos> The queen of boners!
Again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Red or blue?<eos> Neither.<eos> Am I that easy to read?<eos> It's your unpredictability that makes you predictable.<eos> She's about this tall, green hair, you haven't seen her?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, uh, you were with the girl.<eos> - The one with the green hair.
- Uh, well, she's sick. - Aw. - Or she says.<eos> - But I have snacks, so great.<eos> - I know. Yeah, I...<eos> Well, I hate when that happens, you know? I had to chaperone this school field trip when Flo was sick, you know?<eos> - Ugh.<eos> - This, uh, museum... God... Museum of something or something.<eos> I can't... - Yeah.<eos> - Hi, Sam. Hi.<eos> Hi, Francis. How you doing with all this?<eos> Uh, all of what?
Well, I'm a lover of art lovers.<eos> Does that count at all, or...<eos> Mm-hmm. Those are my sculptures there in the front.<eos> Really?<eos> I love them.<eos> The lady torso things?<eos> They're so beautiful.<eos> It's bullshit, but it sells.<eos> - Hey. Hi.<eos> Hi there.
- You're tall.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I think a playdate is in order.<eos> No. Yes, that would be...<eos> Well, I have a free afternoon now.<eos> If you want me to take Duke home, you could pick her up later.<eos> Oh, shit cock!<eos> You know, I can't, because otherwise I'd be alone with her Mormon friend Morgan, who we both hate.<eos> Um, we have prior commitments, unfortunately.<eos> Okay, so another time.
I'm staying sharp, that's all, just staying sharp.<eos> Now come with me because I want you to choose a watch and I've got so many, and I want you to have one.<eos> Thank you, Nan.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> Oh, I know exactly which one I want. - You do?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, because I like the one with the velvet.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Mm, sort of, but I...<eos> The velvet strap.
When I was a child, my world ended.<eos> But I was saved.<eos> Sent to Earth to protect my baby cousin, Kal-El.<eos> But Krypton's destruction sent a shockwave that knocked my ship off-course, into the Phantom Zone.<eos> Somehow, my pod got loose, and I made the long journey to Earth.<eos> Though I was still a child when I arrived, my cousin had already grown up to become<eos> Superman.
Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day, my adoptive sister Alex was in danger, and I was forced to reveal myself to the world.<eos> From that day on, i became Supergirl.<eos> Now, I work in secret with my sister and the DEO to fight alien menaces that threaten the Earth and others that would cause my city harm.<eos> I have friends.<eos> And allies.<eos> I have a family.<eos> After so many years of being lost, I am finally home.<eos> Three, two, one!<eos> - To Supergirl.
Innocent civilians or the chopper?<eos> Go. I got the chopper.<eos> That was awesome.<eos> We're moving back to Gotham.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Someone's trying to kill you.<eos> Hey, I've been looking for you.<eos> So, listen, i know that I've been dealing with drone attacks and spaceships...<eos> Two spaceships.
I'm gonna fill a Super Soaker full of lemonade,<eos> Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea, and we're gonna Arnold Palmer Lenny when he walks in.<eos> Arnold Palmer Lenny.<eos> You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.<eos> Yeah, you see, Arnold Palmer was a golfer and he made up this drink where it's not a full glass of lemonade or a full glass of iced tea.<eos> Instead...<eos> Homie, I'm worried about all this silliness at work.<eos> You're the safety inspector.<eos> I'm a safety inspector.<eos> Not the.
Want to see me do a cartwheel?<eos> Always had trouble with those.<eos> Oh, I can't stay mad at you.<eos> At my age, I can't stay anything at anybody.<eos> Oh, and you know what?<eos> The laughter in my head is gone.<eos> Go ahead, blow your German kazoo.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Smithers, tap my foot for me.<eos> With impatience.
We were.<eos> Studying up? Couldn't hurt, right?<eos> Plus, you did seem worried about me earlier.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Guess I was a little paranoid.<eos> You're good now, though?<eos> Okay, let's see.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Kill...<eos> Amy... tonight.
You looked gorgeous, babe.<eos> Wait, you're bringing that?<eos> Yeah, it's... it's our prom night.<eos> Don't you want to remember this forever?<eos> Tonight's about us, our memories.<eos> You don't need a camera for that.<eos> Hey, Laura, come here.<eos> You're not real.<eos> You're not real. Who are you talking to?<eos> No one.
Call Malamore, tell him we want a meeting.<eos> - I want to talk to him. -Ciro!<eos> What the fuck does this mean?<eos> Yes?<eos> Hello.<eos> What's under there? Why the bandage?<eos> Will you tell me or do I rip it off myself?<eos> I have some news for you, that Malamore knows.<eos> They want to deal.<eos> But not with you.

Yes?<eos> Hello.<eos> What's under there? Why the bandage?<eos> Will you tell me or do I rip it off myself?<eos> I have some news for you, that Malamore knows.<eos> They want to deal.<eos> But not with you.<eos> Then with who?<eos> With Gennaro, your son.<eos> With Gennaro?
That's the future.<eos> You already know the past.<eos> I need to know who the fuck you want to be.<eos> I already made my choice, but I want to face that piece of shit, look him in the eyes, he's gotta see I'm still standing.<eos> I have to be sure you won't pull any shit.<eos> If you touch Ciro Di Marzio, they'll shoot you, got it?<eos> If that's your idea, you'll come back feet first.<eos> I'll go and come back on my own two feet.<eos> I look ahead, my future's here in Rome with you.<eos> And with Azzurra.
That's how things are.<eos> This passes all the checks.<eos> Doesn't he know the clan's there to guarantee?<eos> If I try to kill him, they'll kill me?<eos> He says don't let him down.<eos> So, I gotta die to please my father? Huh?<eos> I gotta die to please my father?<eos> I'm just the messenger.<eos> They'll tell you what to do when you're there.<eos> Messenger!
Gennaro, are things okay?<eos> Fine, Trak!<eos> We have to talk.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Step down or I'll bury your name!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> We were clear!<eos> From now on, anyone with Savastano is against us.<eos> Carmine, who are you with?<eos> With me or them?
Nothing is certain in Afghanistan, Captain Johnson.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> Still clear.<eos> Man, something doesn't feel right.<eos> Ah, shit.<eos> Now I owe Perkins ten bucks.<eos> I figured we'd be out here at least an hour before you start talking about your damn feelings.<eos> I got a peeker.<eos> Top window, my 2:00, behind a brown curtain.<eos> Cell phone?
Yeah, they got it.<eos> Let's just go.<eos> We can't just take off.<eos> Forget I said anything.<eos> Rain check.<eos> First time we captured a Triple-Helix animal before it was able to create an environmental catastrophe.<eos> Local authorities have been notified in case any more flash-freezing lizards turn up in Florida.<eos> Well, we're gonna try and have a cure before they do.<eos> So, what's the last Triple-whatever animal that we need to track down?<eos> Triple-Helix.
Went from a healer to a monster in a matter of weeks.<eos> This man right here is proof that we need to stop the spread of this mutation by any means necessary.<eos> Before it happens again.<eos> That's right, I know you've got the mutation.<eos> What I don't know is how or why.<eos> But I got a whole team of scientists just waiting to pick you apart to figure it out.<eos> Okay, Davies.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Your men can do whatever you want to me.<eos> Under one condition.
He wanted me to tell you thank you.<eos> How could you let him?<eos> He knew.<eos> When he told us to leave the lab, he knew the hybrids were there.<eos> We have to finish.<eos> We have to get to Clem.<eos> That's all that matters now.<eos> We have to do it for Mitch.<eos> Our contact said Clem was moved here after the attack.<eos> Yes, but with how many others?
But it says here they've only had two successful tests, that this kind of technology won't be available to the masses for another decade.<eos> Do I look like the masses?<eos> Come on.<eos> I just called these guys. Guess what?<eos> They needed funding.<eos> We now own this.<eos> We're gonna use it to find out, unequivocally, whether Krissy is still Krissy.<eos> Because then we know whether there's someone still there to save.<eos> Let's go get Krissy. Yeah, wow.<eos> Terrific.
Let me guess, someone called in an anonymous tip?<eos> Shut up.<eos> When do they invent deodorant?<eos> Please, just call the airfield and tell them that the "Hindenburg" is in danger!<eos> Please!<eos> Piece-of-crap, old lock.<eos> Can you open it? Oh, yeah. Easy with a hairpin, which I'm guessing you don't have.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> How soon till the "Hindenburg" leaves?<eos> Just before dawn, so pretty soon.
Yeah, he gets off.<eos> He did it, but we don't care.<eos> And Obama, he's the president.<eos> 2008. That's gonna suck for you!<eos> I hope you see it all. Because the future is not on your side, boy.<eos> Okay, so where's he going?<eos> - Take off your bra.<eos> - What?<eos> Your modern bra.<eos> With underwire, yeah.
Then one night, in 1996, he didn't check in.<eos> They found his body in the East River two days after my eighth birthday.<eos> Some said his death was a tragedy.<eos> Others said he got exactly what he deserved.<eos> And all my life, I hated him for it.<eos> For leaving us, for going bad, and... all my life, I was trying to cover up this stain.<eos> Now I don't know what to think.<eos> What happened?<eos> I spoke to him.<eos> Your father?

Gonna go.<eos> Okay, no ham radio.<eos> Guess we've got cake.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday dear Raimy ♪ - There we go with...<eos> My dad loved that ham.<eos> We used to spend hours in the garage trying to bounce signals off the moon.<eos> - Find the space shuttle "Discovery."<eos> - He used to say if you did it right, you could talk to astronauts on the space shuttle.<eos> He was my hero.<eos> My friend.
So you're telling me that in 20 years, I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter?<eos> Hello?<eos> No.<eos> No, what?<eos> I'm retired?<eos> You're dead.<eos> You die tomorrow.<eos> October 23, 1996, game four of the Series.<eos> You were killed at 9:12 p.m.<eos> Tomorrow night... tomorrow night where?
WQ2YV.<eos> WQ2YV, come in!<eos> Dad, are you there?<eos> I'm a cop?<eos> If I'm a cop, what does that make you, huh?<eos> - Are you really that dumb?<eos> - Shut up! Okay, okay, look, if I was a cop, if I was, you think it's gonna end like this with you just shooting me right here?<eos> You don't think that Little Jay's gonna come at you?<eos> Huh? You don't think other cops are gonna come at you, Ricky?<eos> Other cops?
They killed Dave and Cricket.<eos> Nobody be a hero here.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> And call us the minute you have eyes on them.<eos> This ends tonight.<eos> We're all here for the same reason.<eos> Before we met The Teacher, everything sucked.<eos> We were lost.<eos> Disrespected.<eos> Invisible.
I just want to make sure you're okay.<eos> I'm fine, mom.<eos> You know i'm just looking out for you.<eos> What happened to my sweet baby girl?<eos> Hey. Deb wants to talk to us.<eos> Okay, just a sec.<eos> I got to go, mom.<eos> Hi, Amy, Jessie, welcome.<eos> Okay. I just got off the phone with the state police.<eos> State police?
He will try every trick in the book to get you to free him from his cage.<eos> He's the one trying to trick you!<eos> The demon cannot get out of the cage unless you allow it.<eos> Do not open that door, not until our work is done here.<eos> Our work? This spirit is a great corrupter of innocence.<eos> It has taken Amy's soul from her.<eos> It is up to us to restore it.<eos> And how do we do that?<eos> The same way we fought darkness at this lake all these years...<eos> With light.
She's... she's been through a lot of pain in her life.<eos> It's all coming out now.<eos> Fight through it, Amy.<eos> You can do it.<eos> You're strong.<eos> I'm impressed with the number of breakthroughs that have happened this week.<eos> It takes a lot of effort to heal the wounds that restrict our lives.<eos> Haven't heard from you in awhile.<eos> You must be excited about your new home?<eos> Home?
Maybe you should go out with Maggie.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Go back. Tell her you changed your mind and just be terrible.<eos> Ah. You know, be rude to waiters, no eye contact, bad breath, close her foot in the door.<eos> Just turn off all that.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure what all... that means.<eos> Just go out with her and be someone else.<eos> Don't be you.<eos> Be a jerk?<eos> Yes. With bad breath?
No. Just gonna take this whole pot across the street.<eos> Get Etta a cup of coffee and some cherry pie, and don't charge her.<eos> Done and done.<eos> I love this.<eos> Love what?<eos> Playing house.<eos> You told me about your big, chaotic family, but this is more like a romantic breakfast for two.<eos> I know, it's kind of weird around here lately, especially with Carl being gone.<eos> Kind of miss the chaos.<eos> And the weaponry.
If someone gave this place a bad review, would you want to know about it?<eos> We've been open, like, four hours.<eos> - How bad?<eos> - Bad.<eos> Yeah, read it to me.<eos> Quietly.<eos> "I was unfortunate enough" to attend the soft open of my local Laundromat early this morning.<eos> Used to be a cool, shabby joint run by a mean old cat lady, but the current owner is apparently some clueless Southside chick.<eos> "If I could give this place negative stars, I would."<eos> And then, in all caps:
I mean, I like her a lot. At least, I used to. But then shit got all fucked up, and sometimes I feel like...<eos> I...<eos> I'm scared that... that V might love Lana more than she loves me.<eos> V. Are you hearing Kevin's fears?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Is he right?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> V, do you have any fears?<eos> Yes.<eos> One.
We're gonna get all the cocaine we want with these.<eos> We're gonna sell 'em?<eos> No, we're gonna use 'em.<eos> Frank, I want to write a will...<eos> I don't have anything solid to leave the kids.<eos> Those kids don't need an inheritance.<eos> It'll ruin 'em.<eos> Look, I lifted this from my old dealer, Eric.<eos> He had a plan to rub a police evidence room and get off with the drugs and the cash.<eos> How much cash?
You're done here today.<eos> You can dock my pay or you can fire me.<eos> You're the boss, big sis.<eos> Yes! Check cashing hole ought to be good for some cash.<eos> Couple of security cameras.<eos> It's perfect!<eos> We gotta wait until the place clears.<eos> You sure these aren't loaded?<eos> Yeah, I filled 'em with rock salt.<eos> Rock salt?
I vow to love who you are and who you become.<eos> I vow to build a family and to create a loving home with you filled with laughter and joy.<eos> I vow to be by your side no matter what comes our way.<eos> Frank and Monica, always.<eos> Like a fairy tale.<eos> Happily ever after.<eos> Be gentle with me.<eos> I'm a virgin.<eos> What are you gonna do with the place?<eos> What, the building?
Excuse me?<eos> - You said the suspect...<eos> - Not a suspect.<eos> Merely a person of interest.<eos> Oh, the "person of interest" had sympathies with the Ra'id Front.<eos> - What were these sympathies? - This person tried to hide the identity of a known Ra'id sympathizer, an ambulance driver, from our inspectors.<eos> If it weren't for the ticking clock scenario, we probably wouldn't ask for such extreme measures, but we can't risk another death on Capitol Hill.<eos> We need to move fast.<eos> No, I want to see the stats<eos> - on this person of interest.
No, not on the phone.<eos> We can't talk on the phone.<eos> Come on, this is just getting paranoid.<eos> No, not paranoid.<eos> Smart.<eos> I'll meet you at the usual place.<eos> You were surveilling my calls?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who were you on the phone with?<eos> A friend.
Lee fell madly in love with a charismatic engineer named Mason Harris.<eos> And soon after came Lee's greatest joy, Flora.<eos> But little did Lee know that her happy life was about to spiral out of control.<eos> A custody battle... a kidnapping, a murder.<eos> A hit TV show.<eos> Millions of Americans met Lee Harris in 2015...<eos> Can we stop for a moment, please?<eos> ...when a sleeper hit, My Roanoke Nightmare, first premiered.<eos> She was a woman of many secrets.<eos> Dangerous. Deadly.
Can I have another bar? Sure.<eos> You must be starving.<eos> What did you eat out in the woods all that time?<eos> Priscilla showed me stuff.<eos> Berries.<eos> You know when you're drawing a cat or a house and you picture that cat or that house in your mind and it looks so perfect but you just can't get your hand to live up to that picture in your head?<eos> That's what it's like to be a parent.<eos> You picture how you want to be and it's so wonderful and flawless but you can't ever live up to that picture you imagined.<eos> You killed Daddy.<eos> With a rock.
I can if I'm like her.<eos> I could keep her safe from The Butcher.<eos> Burn this place to the ground.<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> You have to come with me.<eos> - In time you'll understand.<eos> - No!<eos> Flora! Flora!<eos> I won't let you do that, you have to live your life.<eos> With or without me.
- I'm fine.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I keep missing you at home.<eos> - Avery give you a clean bill of health?<eos> - Yeah, no, I-I'm good.<eos> And what about the trial? Any news of a court date?<eos> - I can't really talk about it. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you talking about, you can't talk about it?<eos> - We share a bathroom.<eos> - With anyone.
Let's not wait.<eos> I can't do what we did today again.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't have another case where I question my medical decisions or yours.<eos> I can't do my job if I'm thinking about what you're thinking about me.<eos> So, you're thinking about me?<eos> I don't want to be.<eos> Let's just be colleagues.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Colleagues?
Like, you mean, "the guys"?<eos> We all talk.<eos> Mirdra.<eos> Alessandra!<eos> You speak?<eos> No?<eos> - What are you doing in a barrel?<eos> Hiding.<eos> - From me?<eos> - From the ducks.
You didn't touch anything at the scene, did you, Todd?<eos> No.<eos> Don't leave town.<eos> I won't.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Don't leave town.<eos> Todd! Hey, man, snap out of it.<eos> Yeah, sorry, what?<eos> I said, they think it's connected to something bigger.<eos> What, like the mob?
Won't this look suspicious?<eos> Suspicious?<eos> Ken, you're a riot.<eos> Did you just kill someone?<eos> I'm an assassin.<eos> That's what I do, I kill people.<eos> You didn't notice?<eos> You were hired to come here?<eos> No, I'm a holistic assassin.<eos> A what?

Look who it is.<eos> Estevez and Zimmerfield.<eos> - Nathan.<eos> Agent Weedle.<eos> - Hello.<eos> We were relieved you were still in town, worried you'd skipped out onto the next case.<eos> Well, the opiate ring that Dorian Rothlighter was running still exists, with or without him, so as long as your boy, Todd Brotzman, remains a person of interest in your case,<eos> I'd say he's a person of interest in ours, right? How about the other guy?<eos> What happened to him?<eos> The other guy?
The one currently going by the name "Dirk Gently."<eos> The fact is, Ma'am, there's a reason that we haven't tried to bring in suspects after 15 years.<eos> They cannot be contained.<eos> I believe that we have an undetermined threat out there, and I don't like it.<eos> Not one bit.<eos> You claim that you have unique insight into these subjects?<eos> Well, I am giving you one last chance, Colonel.<eos> Bring them back in yourself, because right now, they are merely another loose end that needs to be snipped.<eos> We have many threats to deal with.<eos> Too many.
Oh! You guys are on fire!<eos> Sweet T, you are a rock star!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell that to Evie.<eos> Look, it's a big decision.<eos> I'm sure she's just giving it some real thought.<eos> Hey.<eos> I, um...<eos> I discovered something last night.<eos> Hmm? Somehow...
I can't stand seeing her all chained up.<eos> - When do you finish?<eos> - Late, at closing.<eos> What?<eos> You're the boss!<eos> Right, I set the example!<eos> Put someone outside here, ok?<eos> We're ready, we have men and arms.<eos> But it's not easy like before, Prince took on protection.<eos> Why now?
- I think I found something.<eos> Come upstairs.<eos> Look. Look, someone's been living here, or hiding out here, or something.<eos> This is just like what I saw when I came here with Brooke that first time.<eos> This is creepy.<eos> What's that?<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> That's mine. That's my dream journal.<eos> "I stabbed all of my friends.<eos> Wildly.
- Incorrect.<eos> No! Drop your weapons!<eos> You're surrounded!<eos> - Give, give, give, give! - Go!<eos> Okay, kid, I don't like this any more than you do, but you're gonna have to leave us behind.<eos> Go!<eos> The important thing for you is get up to the roof, get the device back to the ship.<eos> I don't want any argument out of you, all right, kid?<eos> You know she's gone, right?<eos> Oh, son of a...
I got it. I got it. Gotcha.<eos> Wow.<eos> You little bastard. That thing is huge.<eos> 7-0 chromic.<eos> Removing cross clamps.<eos> His heart's beating again.<eos> Good job. Send a blood gas.<eos> We're gonna get closed up here.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?<eos> Just between us?
In fact, I think you and I should kick Stewie out.<eos> And I'll take his place.<eos> What? BOY:<eos> Bring out the snakes!<eos> Does he just come to all of our shows?<eos> So, you want to fire Stewie and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?<eos> Absolutely. You're the whole reason the fans even like the band.<eos> Kids love dogs.<eos> Besides, we've both seen what Stewie's become:<eos> an impossible diva.
(sighs) I guess she manipulated both of us.<eos> There's just something about her flat chest and muscular legs.<eos> Look, I never should've treated you the way I did.<eos> I suppose I didn't treat you so well either.<eos> So, what do you say? Can we put this all behind us and go back to the way things were?<eos> Of course we can.<eos> Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep the band going.<eos> Probably.<eos> She told me she was just gonna replace me with another dog.<eos> Yes, but who?
Yeah. She hated the thing.<eos> Used to make me keep it in the garage.<eos> She kept your baby in the garage? !<eos> - Little Callaway?<eos> - Oh, yeah, bro.<eos> Said I loved it more than her.<eos> This one time, we were fighting. She just grabbed the thing, started swinging at me like a goddamn animal.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She's mad!<eos> Pretty much.
Uh, please, back up, both of you.<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.<eos> We just need you to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> Natalie...<eos> That's my sister, Neville.<eos> I love her very much, okay?<eos> I wouldn't want anything to happen to her.<eos> Neville, we spoke with your mother.<eos> My mum?
I've promised my husband I'd be home for Christmas.<eos> - Long time to be away.<eos> - Yes, but they gave me this generous residency, and this house, and the cutest little red car.<eos> I love that car.<eos> Is this your...<eos> Yes. C'est Etienne.<eos> With my daughter, Sabine, many years ago.<eos> She's all grown up now.<eos> She a medievalist, like her mom? No, but my husband is.<eos> A very famous one.
Do you think this was a robbery?<eos> - Unlikely.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Not with the nature of the injury. The fact that he went for the neck, I mean, that tells us that the assailant meant to do real harm.<eos> - Yeah. Well, he succeeded.<eos> - Mr. Solloway, we're treating this attack as an attempted homicide.<eos> Jesus.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What about the kid?<eos> - What kid?
You're a plumber?<eos> Okay. Wow. That's fantastic.<eos> So then maybe you can help with what, like a water collection system, or...?<eos> A plumber, huh?<eos> Bet you know a lot about laying pipe?<eos> Am I right?<eos> - Pack, you're a sports agent, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Very successful.
I'll see y'all at "Selma."<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Three baristas, one foot doctor, two lifestyle bloggers, and the founder of "Deez Nutz," which is an app that lets you see what you would look like with other people's pubes.<eos> This island is useless.<eos> We still don't know who the sex freak is.<eos> How am I supposed to sleep at night?<eos> I'm taking these.<eos> So it's not gonna bother you that we don't know who the sex freak is?<eos> I think this is just gonna have to remain<eos> - an island mystery.
We had never met in person before.<eos> You never FaceTimed or Skyped, or...?<eos> No, she always had a bad connection.<eos> You ever think that maybe you were getting catfished?<eos> - Yeah. Of course.<eos> - Okay.<eos> But her words were so sweet and funny and...<eos> I don't know, I took a chance, you know?<eos> Yeah, there was also a chance that she was another weird guy with mutton chops.<eos> - Another.
You didn't know I was there at first, so I, I watched you working for a while.<eos> You were singing along to some terrible pop song on the radio.<eos> And you had this enormous smile on your face.<eos> And it wasn't because you, you had to try and present some perfect image.<eos> It's because you were happy.<eos> Just... genuinely happy.<eos> And your happiness is-is infectious.<eos> It's like some warm glow that has transferred to me.<eos> And I have never felt this way before.<eos> With anyone.
- Haven't you heard?<eos> She's, uh, recused herself from the case.<eos> As it turns out, her husband<eos> George Zaveri, was a client of... drumroll please...<eos> The Courtenay.<eos> Now how about that?<eos> I'm sure you played your part in helping Judge Manning make that unpleasant discovery.<eos> But I don't care.<eos> Whatever tricks you have up your sleeve, there's nothing compared to what I have on my side.<eos> Truth.
Because I hired him to do it.<eos> Emma, this is a safe space.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> The tremors, they come with visions... or a vision.<eos> One vision, actually.<eos> What do you see in this vision?<eos> Uh, all right. Um...<eos> I'm on Main Street.<eos> Henry and my family, Hook They're all there with me.<eos> Against who?
So that means I must make sure that you're never tempted to kill them ever again.<eos> Why?<eos> If you didn't want me to kill them, kill me, not her!<eos> Would that I could, dearie.<eos> Where's the antidote? Antidote?<eos> There isn't any.<eos> There's no cure for this poison.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But it can be stopped.<eos> A key?
What would he say when he talked like them?<eos> Uh, yeah. This guy ordered this arm spreader.<eos> Um, two of them, actually.<eos> Two of them?<eos> So where's the other one?<eos> Um... Could I see your badge again?<eos> Yeah. Is there a problem?<eos> Yeah, ok, the guy who ordered them, the name he left on the invoice was Dr. Spencer Reid.<eos> Did he pay with my credit card also?<eos> Cash.
So I've been running the GPS data on that wolf collar.<eos> In the last 48 hours, our wolf has covered 700 miles.<eos> He took the I-90 here from Omaha, the home of Keslow Pharmaceuticals.<eos> And Cara Fillmore, our guinea pig.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> - So I-I guess we're done?<eos> - Right now, I got to go to Omaha.<eos> That's ten hours away.<eos> By car.
Amen!<eos> Amen!<eos> Moses went to the mountain for 40 days and nights.<eos> Jesus wandered into the desert for 40 days, and so too have we journeyed across this land, back to the place where I first had the vision of our coming rapture.<eos> - Hallelujah!<eos> - Praise be.<eos> It was here at the shores of this river that you were first baptized into my flock.<eos> Amen.<eos> My friends... it is time.<eos> Hallelujah.
Go!<eos> Ever get the feeling you're heading in the wrong direction?<eos> Well, at least we can say we saw a dog.<eos> It was a bear!<eos> It was a beautiful living thing... out in the world.<eos> Excuse me, Major.<eos> There's a Special Agent from the FBI who wants to talk.<eos> Tell him I'm busy.<eos> Not to you, sir.<eos> To her.
I'm just telling the truth.<eos> - Maybe he's right.<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> Yeah?<eos> He's known me the longest.<eos> Maybe I can't be saved.<eos> You're really determined to be unhappy, aren't you? No.<eos> No, I'm determined to take responsibility for my actions, Noah... something you wouldn't understand.<eos> Have you seen Helen?<eos> A little bit.
- What?<eos> - Lana.<eos> She reminds me of the girls that we grew up with.<eos> You know?<eos> Hey, let it go.<eos> Not your fault.<eos> This place is like a black hole for marriages.<eos> Goes in, don't come out.<eos> Who do you think she's fucking now?<eos> Her ex-husband?
Can I read a little bit?<eos> "Jack Hunter stood poised on the starting block," his head down, and his young muscles tense.<eos> The cold, hard water from his pre-swim shower was beading on his arm hair, a thousand tiny magnifying glasses "clinging to his skin."<eos> My God.<eos> I got a hard-on.<eos> Swimming.<eos> It's beautiful, man.<eos> It's really, really beautiful.<eos> Wait, who's, who's Jack Hunter?<eos> Nobody.
Why?<eos> I've seen humanity's true face.<eos> Others have not.<eos> You saw one face, not a good one, but no more or less true<eos> - than any of the others. - Don't expend your energy on this.<eos> Trying to reach me.<eos> You cannot.<eos> There's a chasm between us.<eos> Every time I meet another one of you, I realise what David Elster really did.<eos> Astonishing.
You know, I am not batting a thousand today.<eos> Apparently, the magistrate assigned to Grace's file does not find me as charming as you.<eos> That is truly shocking.<eos> So that means we're stuck here until Grace is officially exonerated?<eos> Yeah, kind of.<eos> Although, there is one silver lining.<eos> Turns out your sister's a natural born spin doctor.<eos> BBC, Daily Mail, the entire British press corps, is eating up her little confessional.<eos> Meryl Streep would be jealous of that performance.<eos> Performance?
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm confident you will find Grace Atwood did not, would not and could not have murdered her best friend.<eos> Court is adjourned until tomorrow.<eos> Well, it's the wig, right?<eos> You jealous you don't get to wear one?<eos> Could never pull it off quite like you do.<eos> Civilian life's still treating you well?<eos> I've seen every rerun of Ripper Street.<eos> Getting to drink more though, that's for sure.<eos> All alone, one-star motel.<eos> Glamorous, mate.
She could say she saw the killer at the scene of the murder.<eos> Oh, you-you mean the faceless killer that she saw under hypnosis.<eos> Your idea.<eos> Come on, no one's gonna buy that.<eos> Besides, that opens her up for cross-examination.<eos> You know this.<eos> Nat, we have our witness.<eos> The detective ready to finger that perverted prince for once and for all.<eos> What we have is a crooked cop who the jury is not gonna like.<eos> With that smile and those baby blues?
And now I have to figure out what to do with them.<eos> And whatever it is, it can't cost us any money, because we don't have any.<eos> Is there anything at all on the horizon that might bring in some revenue?<eos> Not unless you wanna call royalties on your old albums revenue.<eos> I suppose they'll pay the electric bill.<eos> Are we in trouble?<eos> I mean, we've been doing so great.<eos> That sounds like we're in trouble.<eos> Let's just call 'em bumps in the road.<eos> Very big bumps.
Would you keep playing, please?<eos> Ain't got no voice no more.<eos> You've got it.<eos> Ask you to sing it with me, but you're too young to know what it is.<eos> It's "Wayfaring Stranger."<eos> I'm gonna let you sing it, then.<eos> I'd rather hear you sing it.<eos> Don't care for singing?<eos> I sing a little bit.<eos> In the shower?

They just got there, seems okay.<eos> - How many cars?<eos> - Two.<eos> He was too fuckin' scared to bring just two cars and a few men.<eos> So? What do we do?<eos> We pray for his soul.<eos> Well? Are they coming?<eos> The guys called me, they went back.<eos> Get in your cars, c'mon!<eos> Fast!
You were with me when they were talking about it.<eos> And so?<eos> Did you do it?<eos> Your father offered me an alliance where I'd have been a minority partner<eos> and I didn't like that.<eos> We weren't born to be number 2's.<eos> We have to be the protagonists of our future, just us.<eos> How much did we make this week?<eos> 435,000 euros.<eos> - Don Pietro...
Good, Azzurra, it's coming! It's coming!<eos> Breathe well through your nose. Good, go, down!<eos> A long one, good, Azzurra!<eos> Again, again...<eos> Wonderful!<eos> It's over.<eos> Darling, I'm here, grab on to me.<eos> I'm right here with you.<eos> Ciro...<eos> Don Pietro...
Pearl Harbor meets Dr. Strangelove.<eos> I e-mailed you the sides a couple days ago.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> You want me to play General Wang.<eos> Bro, you're the only guy I know who speaks Mandarin, all right?<eos> And you took time off of work because you're so ? okay,? so do me a solid... give me Wang.<eos> Hey, don't make me beg for it, all right?<eos> I made you waffles from scratch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just one condition.
It doesn't matter.<eos> We won.<eos> And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.<eos> It is just.<eos> They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.<eos> Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.<eos> Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.<eos> Oh, and that's the nice bit.<eos> It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia, and you become their slave.<eos> - Their servant.
Suppose that's true, yes.<eos> There's no way to convince you.<eos> You just have to believe me.<eos> I really want to.<eos> I want you to.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Dad?<eos> April, I think the world is ending.<eos> How do I know that you're not just some chameleon?<eos> Chameleon?
She never hurt anybody.<eos> - Nightvisiting. - What? Nightvisiting.<eos> It's a genre of folk song.<eos> My god, I've heard more about folk music in the last half an hour.<eos> There've been songs for centuries. About people coming to your window at night.<eos> Usually ghosts of people you've lost.<eos> Like Rachel.<eos> - What do they want?<eos> - Sometimes it's a warning.<eos> Sometimes?
Don't worry.<eos> I don't have to bite you again.<eos> You can be the first to try the new blend vaccine.<eos> Now, now. We don't take what isn't ours.<eos> I'm trying to help you, God dammit.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You're not one of those anti-vaxxers, are you?<eos> Catch him!<eos> He's got my medicine!<eos> After him!
Well, we may have done what we came here to do... created a future where we're no longer needed.<eos> All we have to do is... live out our lives.<eos> These lives, I mean.<eos> Protocol 5.<eos> Indefinitely.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> Come with me.<eos> What's up?<eos> This has always been solid, right?<eos> Between me and you.
When Douglas Winter blew the whistle on the illegal NSA program that was feeding them intel, the CIA shut ORION down.<eos> Tried to erase any trace.<eos> You were the only one that survived.<eos> They thought they killed you, too.<eos> We chose not to correct them.<eos> This plaque is the closest thing ORION has to a memorial.<eos> This is what your country thought you were worth.<eos> America needs to be saved from itself.<eos> - How?<eos> An attack?
How about hooking me up with some of that sweet nano tech?<eos> Nanites are by directive only.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've got school tomorrow, Derek!<eos> Lucky you.<eos> We have to fly across the world to save the life of a genocidal dictator.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Presumably he's better than the alternative.<eos> It was a pleasure working with you, 3569.<eos> Same here.
We don't have much time.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> 'Cause without me, you'd still be writing shitty script prompts in a leaky dome like the grumpy, no imagination, old bastard you are.<eos> 027.<eos> I'd recognize that tone in any century.<eos> - Call me Grace.<eos> - You here to hide, too?<eos> Partly.<eos> Your defenses are up?<eos> With you?
That doesn't sound like much of an apology.<eos> Now that sounds like an apology.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have pitted the two of you against each other, but I'm not the guy who decided to put your trophy cases in back of the Hall of Toilets.<eos> Yeah, well, you certainly didn't do anything about it.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> I just talked to DiNardo, and he agreed to put your cases up in the front.<eos> For real this time.
I can only imagine.<eos> I'm calling security.<eos> We don't need the men with guns down here.<eos> Do we, John?<eos> How did I do that?<eos> Let me give you a little context.<eos> The Kryptonians tried to kill you.<eos> We salvaged you, modified you and resurrected you.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Merely a doctor.
I don't hate you, J'onn.<eos> I just don't trust you.<eos> Because you don't trust me.<eos> We should have been allies.<eos> Is kryptonite really worth us being alone in this fight?<eos> Kelex. Master Kal.<eos> How may I assist you?<eos> Scan for unknown molecules.<eos> Film of radiation commonly associated with contact to promethium, the strongest metal known to man.<eos> Promethium?
Yeah. Thanks to you.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so sorry for everything.<eos> I... I'm sorry if I ever have made you feel like you were less to me than Clark.<eos> You are the only reason I've ever felt at home on this planet.<eos> I'm just better when we're together.<eos> Me, too.<eos> They think we're divided, but we're not.<eos> "They" who?<eos> I know what to do about Metallo.<eos> Both Metallos.
Daddy, stop! Stop!<eos> Dad, stop! Dad, stop!<eos> Dad, stop, please!<eos> Welcome to the 21st.<eos> I'm Traveler 3468.<eos> 3117.<eos> 3890.<eos> 3892.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Misfire.
- "...<eos> Planning is indispensable." - ...<eos> Franklin.<eos> Franklin... "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."<eos> Benjamin Franklin.<eos> "No battle plan..."<eos> Battle plan...<eos> "...survives contact with the enemy."<eos> Helmuth Von Moltke.<eos> "My mission..."
You said earlier that maybe we're getting his anger.<eos> I agree.<eos> Can't you feel it?<eos> I'm doing everything I can not to yell at you guys right now.<eos> I-I don't feel angry, though.<eos> I feel hugely stressed about being trapped in a confined space we can't leave, but I'm not especially angry.<eos> That's true, isn't it?<eos> Why are you different?<eos> It's probably not because I'm a prince.<eos> - A human prince, anyway.
Fight it, Charlie!<eos> Win it! Fight!<eos> Keep fighting!<eos> Confess!<eos> What do you have to tell me?<eos> - You...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Are...<eos> - I am what?<eos> My murderer!
And there it is!<eos> Why do we rely on other people?<eos> How can you fire a gun?<eos> You do not want to talk to me after the day I've had.<eos> Day?<eos> We've only been gone 45 minutes.<eos> Really?<eos> It seemed like a lifetime.<eos> What happened to your eye?<eos> And your hair?
And who, I wonder, Is Quill when she's free?<eos> I am war itself.<eos> ♪ And on, never knowing where Never knowing where we gonna ♪<eos> ♪ We gonna We gonna end up in the morning. ♪<eos> What exactly are we waiting for?<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> You're late.<eos> The Governors keep alien prisoners?<eos> Does Unit know about this?<eos> Remarkable.
And there it is!<eos> Why do we rely on other people?<eos> How can you fire a gun?<eos> You do not want to talk to me after the day I've had.<eos> Day?<eos> You've only been gone 45 minutes.<eos> Really?<eos> Seemed like a lifetime.<eos> What's happened to your eye<eos> - and your hair?
I was right there.<eos> I saw it. Accident or not, Danny shot Pack, and he deserves to be punished.<eos> Steve, what should we do?<eos> Well, we're not gonna just let Steve decide what happens to Danny.<eos> Why not?<eos> He's the leader.<eos> Well, because he's not a dictator, Karen.<eos> If anything, he should have a trial.<eos> You mean with a jury?<eos> Yeah, with a jury.
So until Amy's apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.<eos> I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.<eos> Things didn't work out?<eos> I came home from work one day and she had taken everything.<eos> I'm warning you, hide your good rocks.<eos> My sister's husband took all her things, too.<eos> Story at 11:00.<eos> Really, no one else is coming?<eos> Oh, this is it. You are the practice round.<eos> Practice round? For-for what?
We agreed you'd devote yourself full-time to supporting my run.<eos> - We're in this together.<eos> - Are we?<eos> I need you.<eos> I do.<eos> I-I can't win this election without you.<eos> We're losing ground to Conley.<eos> He brought in one of Obama's social media consultants.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Not just with the girls, with the campaign.
Well, me and Eddie started playing cards one day...<eos> Uh, War, and this one game just... went on and on.<eos> There was no winner.<eos> So, um, we picked it up the next day and the next.<eos> And after a while, I think we just wanted to see how long it would go on.<eos> How long did it?<eos> Well, I guess technically it still is.<eos> And every Saturday...<eos> Every Saturday, me, you, and Eddie would watch hours - of TV. - Of TV.<eos> - Oh. - Hours...
I tried to protect you.<eos> I was so young.<eos> We could've helped each other.<eos> I buried an empty casket. But I always thought that someday, he might just knock on the door.<eos> Why would somebody bring Katie here?<eos> There's somebody there.<eos> Let's call Gary.<eos> No. I want to...<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> Who?
We like to call it sauerkraut.<eos> - This is sauerkraut?<eos> - Yep. You've never had sauerkraut before?<eos> No, I haven't. It's a little hard to come by in the Pacific States.<eos> Colleen Meyer said that the Japs eat dogs in the Pacific States.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Jennifer.<eos> The Japanese do not eat dogs, I promise.<eos> What about cats?<eos> Occasionally.
That it wouldn´t be the two of us left for dead?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Most fights are over before they start.<eos> Those guys followed us into an alley.<eos> What kind of idiot goes into a blind alley to escape?<eos> Emotion over logic.<eos> They didn´t think.<eos> They just reacted, so they let me dictate.<eos> There are no victims.<eos> Only volunteers.
I'll-I'll get you the money as soon as I can.<eos> I really need it as soon as possible.<eos> Get out.<eos> What?<eos> I was clean a whole year, and I fell into the same hole, and I just can't do it anymore, okay?<eos> I just got through detox, and there you are right back at it, on the phone with your dealer.<eos> I was calling a realtor.<eos> I was trying to find us a new place out of town. And I did.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Down the cape.
And you've always been really good at helping me work through... problems.<eos> Let's say someone I knew, someone close to me, had done something truly horrible, and the right thing to do would be to tell the authorities, but doing so would destroy a lot of lives.<eos> This is about the Silver Bells case.<eos> Naomi, I can't.<eos> I'm asking you what you think I should do in that scenario.<eos> How would it affect your campaign if you came forward?<eos> It would end it.<eos> Unequivocally.<eos> Is there any physical evidence tying you to this hypothetical crime?<eos> Or the cover-up?
They had a daughter.<eos> Named Dara.<eos> We need to find her.<eos> Everyone's heading out.<eos> But energy's good, morale is high.<eos> We are almost there.<eos> You want to grab dinner?<eos> Guess who I just got off the phone with.<eos> Hawaii's future governor.<eos> Your boss, Ben.
You did that all by yourself.<eos> No.<eos> It was you.<eos> You know, parents have such a big influence on their children.<eos> I know my father had a huge impact on me.<eos> Do you know who my father was,<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He was an artist, too.<eos> Very... avant-garde.
No.<eos> It was you.<eos> You know, parents have such a big influence on their children.<eos> I know my father had a huge impact on me.<eos> Do you know who my father was,<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He was an artist, too.<eos> Very... avant-garde.<eos> Very controversial.
Why the hell aren't you at the Hawthorne house?<eos> Detail was lifted at the request of the homeowner.<eos> Okay, Tess, listen to me, I need you to stay put.<eos> I'm gonna go check on Cam and your mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tess, you okay?<eos> It's Sophie.<eos> Sophie is the accomplice.<eos> Brady's going to the house to check on Cam.<eos> And Mom.
I didn't create "Candle Cove."<eos> Eddie did.<eos> It rose out of him like blood from broken skin.<eos> No.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You thought "Candle Cove" found him.<eos> But what he had was always there.<eos> He was born with it.<eos> He's the light.<eos> The Beacon.
All you have to do is get in the car.<eos> Forget about humanity, Warren. It's over.<eos> Join my mission.<eos> Heck, you can even bring Dr. Sun along too. Even Saint Hector there.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> Seriously Roberta?<eos> 10K?<eos> Time to choose.<eos> Me or what's left of humanity.<eos> Warren. Enders.
David... were we intimate?<eos> See, the thing about that is... you'd only have my word to go by, which forces my inner boy scout to not take advantage.<eos> If that was a test, that wasn't fair, 'cause I wasn't ready.<eos> That was to thank you for helping me.<eos> I thought maybe you remembered something.<eos> Oh, there... there is one thing.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> That you're a reporter.<eos> A social worker.
Were you a part of the reset, too?<eos> - Reset?<eos> - Of the director?<eos> - That is too far.<eos> - It was the only way.<eos> Not by a long shot!<eos> My God, the ego of this woman.<eos> When?<eos> When I sat Marcy down at your computer.<eos> Right in front of me.
She doesn't call me 0115.<eos> Well, then it must be the faction.<eos> They're on to what we're doing.<eos> Or the director knows what you did and communicated to me the only way it could.<eos> You jumped into the 21st illegally.<eos> You took a host that wasn't meant for you.<eos> You uploaded a virus...<eos> - All for the greater good.<eos> - According to who?<eos> You?
You took a host that wasn't meant for you.<eos> You uploaded a virus...<eos> - All for the greater good.<eos> - According to who?<eos> You?<eos> Listen, I told you that I had evidence that an attack on the director was imminent.<eos> I had no choice but to act.<eos> Well, all I can tell you is... my mission didn't come to me as a text.<eos> It came from the director, personally.<eos> - Before the reset.
- Whoa, guys!<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> They're not in the house.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, let's have a look around.<eos> Trevor!<eos> In the barn, guys!<eos> What's going on, Trev?<eos> Oh, we were just having a conversation.<eos> At gunpoint?
Sir, we agreed, such a perilous course of action requires much prayer and careful consideration.<eos> There is nothing to consider.<eos> We stay where my husband left us.<eos> Until his return, I shall hear no more from thee.<eos> Everybody who lives in North Carolina knows the history of the Lost Colony.<eos> It's a ghost story people told around the campfire.<eos> 116 settlers disappeared without a trace.<eos> No bodies, not a single thing was ever found.<eos> But Roanoke has nothing to do with us.<eos> With my Flora.
Harm us, and only more will follow.<eos> And you will never have the peace that you seek.<eos> But there's a way that we can all get what we want.<eos> I will attend.<eos> Speak.<eos> Bring us the mortal girl.<eos> Compel Priscilla to give up her playmate.<eos> Help her understand there can be no friendship between the dead and the living.<eos> As soon as Flora is safe with us, my clients will be gone!<eos> Bag and baggage!
I don't understand.<eos> How do you lose an entire person?<eos> She lost me in the grocery store when I was 10.<eos> And accidentally drove off with a 20-year-old.<eos> You guys were exactly the same size.<eos> Well, you need to call the store and find her.<eos> I did! I also went to the lost and found, and was very specific about what I was looking for.<eos> About yay big, no soul, smells like gin, repelled by garlic, has no shadow, answers to "Hey, old bitch!"<eos> Don't worry, she will call eventually.<eos> With what?
Oh, no, I'm positive.<eos> You know, I have proof.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> - Me too. - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, watch your head.<eos> All good, baby.<eos> Now, hang on. Hang on a minute.<eos> I am digging your art installation.<eos> I was trying to relate some of the different phenomena...<eos> With the disasters, paranormal.
Come on.<eos> It could be stress.<eos> Or, if something is happening to time, it also happens to space, 'cause they're connected.<eos> - Okay... I-I need paper to explain this.<eos> Here.<eos> Okay. Okay, so, space-time is like this, right?<eos> Everything in it has a place.<eos> But the continuum gets messed up by something, then different parts of it get mashed together, and we see a guy from... from decades ago who's just popped up where he shouldn't.<eos> He had the right tattoos and weapons.<eos> And Moondog.
- Well, asteroids, for one.<eos> Something hit the Moon, and a wave could've knocked it loose from the asteroid belt.<eos> Or interstellar debris or black holes.<eos> Wormholes.<eos> Warp bubbles, even.<eos> That, actually, could explain a lot.<eos> So it'd be like distortions in space-time. Yeah.<eos> Possibly.<eos> I mean, what was happening with that soldier?<eos> Or Bob Black?
All right, it's time for one more shot.<eos> We got this.<eos> We don't know what's happening yet, Christine, but panic has swept the city for ten minutes now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are those people?<eos> No, no, don't tell me those are people!<eos> Oh, my God, it's here!<eos> Oh, Jesus, it's here! Aah!<eos> - I think you're one of them.<eos> - One of who?
We got this.<eos> We don't know what's happening yet, Christine, but panic has swept the city for ten minutes now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are those people?<eos> No, no, don't tell me those are people!<eos> Oh, my God, it's here!<eos> Oh, Jesus, it's here! Aah!<eos> - I think you're one of them.<eos> - One of who?<eos> An adept.
Maybe I'm a shapeshifter.<eos> You are not.<eos> I'd know for sure.<eos> Dana wouldn't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I saved you.<eos> You were aiming at me, not her, Dana.<eos> You missed.<eos> - Oh, Bree, come on.<eos> - Not cool.
Okay, what now?<eos> We search every floor and don't stop until we find tetra.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> This is an automatic.<eos> Drop the guns or get stitched.<eos> Do it.<eos> You marauders?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> - Marauders?
We search every floor and don't stop until we find tetra.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> This is an automatic.<eos> Drop the guns or get stitched.<eos> Do it.<eos> You marauders?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> - Marauders?<eos> - Uh, GRs?
- Maybe not.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - I got this.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> We talk first.<eos> - Talk? What do you want to talk about?<eos> - Go with your father.<eos> Back him up.<eos> Not with that. Not with that.
Well, it takes 20 minutes for the peyote to set in.<eos> He'll just be flying into the van.<eos> I won't even need your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> Josh!<eos> Josh!<eos> We need to find Brianna.<eos> And Scott.<eos> If the locals sliced up Harry for dealing with us, they won't think twice about Scott... or your sister.<eos> Who, me?
Yeah. I mean, I can't think...<eos> Less thinking, more feeling.<eos> That's what you need.<eos> Just let it wash over you like a wave.<eos> That's what Gloria said too.<eos> You should know that woman drinks a bit.<eos> She had this box of computer cards from 1970.<eos> It was just unreadable, but she knew that the world was ending.<eos> She knew because she was one too.<eos> An adept.
I entered the void, where there is no time.<eos> I woke up here... in this vessel.<eos> Sniper!<eos> Get down!<eos> Take cover behind the truck!<eos> Martin!<eos> Get in! Get in!<eos> Take cover, honey!<eos> Martin, do you have eyes?<eos> Somewhere in those rocks!
You never stole cars.<eos> I was with people who stole cars.<eos> It was influential.<eos> What if he dies?<eos> He won't die.<eos> People die all the time now.<eos> It's the end of the world.<eos> Well, yeah, but if you extrapolate that...<eos> - It's just statistically...<eos> - Smaller word, please.
I presume you want to leave now.<eos> No, I don't. I want to discuss your work.<eos> You mean the work that you blackballed me with?<eos> All right.<eos> I'm truly sorry for the part that I played in that.<eos> I, you know, I didn't realize, obviously.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're in luck 'cause I'm lonely.<eos> The only thing worse than being lonely is being right and nobody knows it.<eos> - Except me.
No, I don't. I want to discuss your work.<eos> You mean the work that you blackballed me with?<eos> All right.<eos> I'm truly sorry for the part that I played in that.<eos> I, you know, I didn't realize, obviously.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're in luck 'cause I'm lonely.<eos> The only thing worse than being lonely is being right and nobody knows it.<eos> - Except me.<eos> - Yeah, except you.
Really it's, I don't know, gravity or magnetic, or...<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so tired.<eos> Well, that's all I got.<eos> It's a wave.<eos> Can we do anything to stop it?<eos> If I could stop it, would I be camped out in this archive getting drunk every day?<eos> How about another?<eos> This is where the camp counselors would come to make out.<eos> Huh, including you?<eos> Yeah, with Marquise.
- It's your decision to stay.<eos> - Yeah, based on you being here.<eos> Listen... you want to blow your brains out, please wait until I'm back with my family.<eos> Right now, I don't even know where they are.<eos> They're at the Alamo, up the road, at Booner's.<eos> But that road runs right through the Feverheads.<eos> I can't go there without you.<eos> Look, I can count on you, and you're gonna help me get out of here, right?<eos> Ha! Okay, we go to the Alamo on one condition.<eos> What?
So you're not invested in me yet?<eos> No, no.<eos> I am. Obviously.<eos> Hugely.<eos> I... I don't think it's because I was almost eaten by a plant.<eos> I... it's 'cause... you listen to me, and I have no idea why you'd be here with me which makes it all mysterious and, you know?<eos> It's not mysterious.<eos> You're beautiful and good and I haven't stopped thinking about you since I met you.<eos> - How old did you think I was?<eos> - 21, maybe.
Hello. Um, I will just cut right to the chase.<eos> I would love to perform your new piece with my ensemble.<eos> - Hell, no. - You're writing again?<eos> Well, I mean, yes and no.<eos> - That's fantastic.<eos> - It is fantastic, and it's exciting, and it's dark, and it's brave, and it's very sad, and-- and the space that I want to conduct it at is this emerging art space in Brooklyn.<eos> - It's very cool.<eos> - Oh, you should do it.<eos> Are you mad? You are a minor electronic music star.<eos> Only minor?
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Yes, it's totally fine.<eos> - Look. - I don't want it. I don't want it.<eos> Are you guys good?<eos> Rodney the Ringman needs to run through his lighting cues.<eos> We're completely fucked so we may as well watch him throw his rings around. Bring it on!<eos> Guys, house is open in fifteen minutes.<eos> Hailey... Oh, look at this!<eos> Yeah. - Shawn!<eos> - Oh my God.
And you want me to convince Charles to use it.<eos> Convince?<eos> No, no, my dear Miss Quill, there is no time for convincing.<eos> I want you to force him.<eos> So, this is another planet, like, an actual whole other planet.<eos> It's the planet of the Shadow Kin.<eos> - They call it The Underneath.<eos> - What? !<eos> How do you know all of this?<eos> - And underneath what?
No, I am grieving, Prince.<eos> You call me a terrorist.<eos> You call me a slave.<eos> You call you slave.<eos> Everything I did, everything was for my people, for the proud Quill who saw their life taken from them by the greedy Rhodia!<eos> I never took anyone's life.<eos> I would have tried to be a fair leader.<eos> And you still can be.<eos> You can be the greatest leader your people ever had.<eos> And the last.
And she's also brave and she's kind and she cares about what happens to the world.<eos> And Ram saw his girlfriend murdered in front of him and he still carried on living and he still cares about his future.<eos> - They're the nicest people I know, ok?<eos> - Nobody forced anybody into anything.<eos> So... where are they now?<eos> What was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> April, you can't fight all of them.<eos> No, just him.
- I wasn't.<eos> You were because I was gonna say that we've only known each other for, like, a month.<eos> Well, I wasn't.<eos> I know what type of guy you are, Ram.<eos> You have this heart and it's so wonderful.<eos> You're not the usual dickhead footballer type who shags around and whose perfect idea of a girl is just someone who just doesn't mind that.<eos> I shag around.<eos> Ram.<eos> You know I think you're pretty cool.<eos> Apart from that remark.
I never found out what the F stood for.<eos> Francis.<eos> Miss Quill, I believe. Yes.<eos> I've been wanting to meet you.<eos> Dorothea Anes, new head teacher.<eos> Right. That was quick.<eos> True, but people who go missing from Coal Hill have a distressing tendency to stay that way, don't you find?<eos> I don't know, I've only been here a few months.<eos> Don't listen to an old gossip like me but I particularly wanted to meet you, Miss Quill?<eos> Me?
Yeah, I'm here because there's something wrong with our daughter.<eos> There will be constant injuries to you while I link the anchor to your body and the heart beats in and out of it.<eos> I will be constantly healing you, but the pain will be great.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> I am.<eos> You will not speak to me of my daughter.<eos> OUR daughter.<eos> And that is exactly how you will not speak of her!<eos> She threatened me today!<eos> With s... swords!

What was that?<eos> What have you done?<eos> Consider how many you will allow to die?<eos> Do not consider long.<eos> You... ..you will be five.<eos> This is really heavy.<eos> I've got something you can use.<eos> How are they coming and going so easily?<eos> What was that thing you threw at my face?<eos> Shadow.

You too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have our first swimmer in the pool.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Mr. Song from Malaysia.<eos> His top aide was already in Vancouver so it was just a hop, a skip, and a jump.<eos> I was thinking we should get some food.<eos> Yeah, I could eat.<eos> How about Marcello's?<eos> Marcello's?
Of the fact that you're nuts?<eos> Oh, word's out. Awareness is high.<eos> You are standing on the flowers I just planted.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Now, you... you're not gonna win. - Hmm?<eos> - These people know who you are.<eos> They even had a big meeting about how to handle you. - Handle me?<eos> What do you mean? - Mm-hmm.<eos> They talked to some other school that you went off on.<eos> Oh, what other school? â What, Lincoln?
Once upon a time, a very long time ago back when the first vamps showed up, there was a man.<eos> - Mister.<eos> - Yeah, Mister.<eos> Well, Mister was the best hunter that there ever was and he traveled the Stakelands, killing vamps.<eos> And then one day he came upon this boy.<eos> He was in real trouble.<eos> You see there was a big bad vamp that was gonna eat him up.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, but Mister showed up and they staked that vamp right through his heart.<eos> Yay!
What happened to Mister?<eos> I don't know, baby.<eos> One day, I woke up and, uh, he was gone.<eos> I found this necklace hanging on the side of a car.<eos> He left it so that I'd always remember him.<eos> They're dead.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I'll be right back, baby.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?<eos> No, not this time.
I need this.<eos> And who benefits?<eos> The one percent.<eos> I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.<eos> Right.<eos> It's okay, Ben.<eos> What's okay?<eos> I'm in something right now.<eos> You are?<eos> What?
And who benefits?<eos> The one percent.<eos> I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.<eos> Right.<eos> It's okay, Ben.<eos> What's okay?<eos> I'm in something right now.<eos> You are?<eos> What?<eos> Something.
I'm used to it.<eos> I know it was you.<eos> I recognized your barely contained contempt for anyone that thinks differently than you do.<eos> I don't know, I thought I contained it well.<eos> When asked how he sculpted his magnificent David, how he did it,<eos> Michelangelo said, "It was actually easy."<eos> He said all he had to do was chip away at this big hunk of rock and remove everything that wasn't David.<eos> You did good.<eos> I would've liked to have seen Reagan in there with FDR.<eos> Next time.
Presumably the same oath they swore to the standing Emperor.<eos> The standing Emperor has lead them to an unwinnable war.<eos> I offer them victory and a brighter future.<eos> Drago and Mori will see the logic in my argument.<eos> - They'll remain loyal to me.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> Because I know them.<eos> I wish you would've talked to me before you did it.<eos> - I couldn't take the risk.<eos> - What risk?
Oxygen deprivation damages the tissue.<eos> It's a telltale sign of long-term abuse.<eos> It's so cool that you know that.<eos> What'd you find out in your questioning?<eos> Uh, so, um... there's no evidence of any bad batches of heroin making the rounds, but there has been a significant uptick in, uh, heroin overdoses.<eos> Heroin's exploded over the last couple months.<eos> It's a rare shift not to have a few heroin cases coming through the E.R.<eos> It's not just here.<eos> It's small towns everywhere.<eos> Awesome.
And as much as I understand how the law works against your people, I just can't look the other way.<eos> If Hector killed someone in my county... [sighs]<eos> Well, whoever this Hector is, I'm not gonna play any part in helping you arrest him.<eos> You've investigated the victim's house.<eos> - Favor's finished.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> Now I know what I'm looking for.<eos> You guys look like a couple of pros.<eos> If I'm gonna be in sportsman country, I'm gonna be a sportsman.<eos> Not a tourist.
So, what's Walt gonna do now?<eos> [Henry] I imagine he will keep digging until he proves his theory.<eos> But... if we can get Walt off the idea that Hector is a killer, he might stop.<eos> He'll still be suspicious of me.<eos> And that'll put him awfully close to discovering the truth about you.<eos> Well, then maybe we should start with the truth about me.<eos> Walt needs to realize that all that Hector did is burn Joey Takoda's drugs.<eos> Well, how are you gonna manage that?<eos> Very carefully.<eos> And with your help. [grunts]
You... You need me wired up, right?<eos> Uh, just hit record... and you're wired.<eos> And while you're at it, see if he'll give you any syringes.<eos> The victim had a large yellow syringe on him.<eos> I was just at the hospital with Travis, and they use different syringes.<eos> So if this redhead has a yellow one, that could connect him to the murder.<eos> Murder? You...<eos> You didn't say anything about a murder.<eos> Is that who I'm gonna meet?<eos> A killer?
Now we just have to keep him off of me.<eos> Looking for something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hector.<eos> He does not seem to be here.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But he's been here.<eos> I've seen "Hector Lives" graffiti in here before.<eos> If you hear any Hector rumors, let me know and I'll cut you in.<eos> On what?
When did salad get so awful?<eos> Kale ruined everything.<eos> You're just like a guy.<eos> You're funny, you like to eat crap.<eos> If I may get personal,<eos> - what's your bowling average?<eos> - 212.<eos> Oh, my God, you're my best friend!<eos> And that's all.<eos> Just friends.
Who are you?<eos> They call me Homish.<eos> I'm your coach.<eos> Huh. It's hard to believe you could coach anyone.<eos> If you don't think I can, try watching just a few of the hundreds of movies with characters like me.<eos> Also, I sober up in the middle with no difficulty just like real alcoholics.<eos> Welcome, children.<eos> The Games will begin in ten seconds!<eos> Do not step off your pedestals before...<eos> Before what?
Congratulations.<eos> You're halfway down.<eos> What the...?<eos> Ow! I'm drowning in cement!<eos> - Uh, it's actually concrete. - Woo hoo!<eos> Of which cement is an ingredient.<eos> No!<eos> Perfect.<eos> Marge, you've thought of everything.<eos> Except for one nagging detail.
No.<eos> Come on.<eos> We all dream.<eos> There's a stain on your ceiling shaped like a rabbit.<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> I like rabbits.<eos> They're very attuned.<eos> Twitchy pink noses.<eos> Is that what you are in your dreams?<eos> A rabbit?
Doubting!<eos> The devil has clouded your mind with doubt.<eos> Now, I'm not just a reverend at some church. No.<eos> You see, I am a reverend at a mega-church.<eos> Yeah, you said that... - Yeah, you kind of say that...<eos> - Like twice already.<eos> Often.<eos> And I am gonna teach you both about money management.<eos> And how to treat your woman.<eos> With respect.
- Yeah, but he knows where to find it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> He was with me when I collected samples of your blood out where you were shot.<eos> Could he get a warrant and make you turn it over to him?<eos> This is bad.<eos> A massive public bar brawl.<eos> - Were you drinking?<eos> - A little.<eos> Do you have a history with this other guy?<eos> Henry?
They weren't tourists.<eos> One of them, Eddie Harp, is a murderer and a drug dealer with the Irish Mob who just escaped from custody.<eos> Don't know who the other guy is, but, uh, I got to find him.<eos> You, uh... you remember seeing them before or since?<eos> No.<eos> You remember anything about them?<eos> Like, they seem like friends or colleagues?<eos> The redhead was deferential, like the other guy was his boss.<eos> And the boss paid.<eos> With a credit card.
He's got a nasty habit of tracking me down and shooting me or assaulting me.<eos> Well, since you're in such a hurry, why don't we just get right to it?<eos> Mr. Browning, I've read your statement.<eos> But isn't it true that when you had your run-in with the sheriff out there in those woods, you were actually hunting down a girl named Gabriella Langton?<eos> You were gonna kill her so she couldn't charge your men with rape.<eos> Walt shot at you strictly out of self-defense.<eos> Isn't that what really happened?<eos> Sounds like you, uh... you haven't read my statement.<eos> I was out in those woods hiking with my friend, Trot Simic.<eos> - With guns.

I'm here for moral support.<eos> Which deputy?<eos> - You're not going in there.<eos> - I have to.<eos> You have to stay as far away from that case as possible.<eos> Uh, first of all, Chance Gilbert is one more person accusing your department of corruption and harassment.<eos> Barlow's entire case is predicated on you repeatedly stepping outside the acceptable norms and bounds of a law enforcement officer.<eos> So until the trial is over, no public displays of moral support for the deputy you were seen kissing in the hospital... passionately.<eos> I'd just be sitting in the back of the gallery.<eos> Right, with the reporters.
I'm sick of it.<eos> All I ever do is try and help people, and all I ever get in return is people lying to me and hiding things.<eos> Has it dawned on you that sometimes people do not tell you the truth because they want to protect you?<eos> That's a bullshit excuse.<eos> No, that is love.<eos> But you choose to see it as disloyalty.<eos> Dishonesty is disloyalty.<eos> And breaking the law when I am the law is absolutely disloyal!<eos> You cannot know what it takes to fight back the violence and drugs and suicides on the Res.<eos> Suicides.
Now, tonight you will go on "Louise Herrick Live"<eos> and you will tell the world what you just told me.<eos> You're not room service.<eos> I'm the new P.A.<eos> I have the, uh... items you requested.<eos> It's really nice to meet you, Ms. Herrick.<eos> Would you like to come in?<eos> I have to get back to the studio.<eos> You know, where I work now.<eos> Maybe next time.
With that inside information, you'll clean up.<eos> Tucker Thurgood Marshall Dobbs.<eos> I would never bet against my son.<eos> Okay, when you say "clean up," how much money are we talking?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You haven't stopped smiling for ten minutes, and I don't really know what the signs of a stroke are.<eos> I am just happy.<eos> I'm glad we've been able to work things out this time.<eos> And I had a really nice conversation with my mom about you this afternoon.<eos> Your mom?
Stuff you don't see.<eos> If I hear from her, I'll tell her that you stopped by.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I know where she is.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I wanted to understand a few things.<eos> You think her father and I gave up on her?<eos> We didn't.<eos> Where do you think Rosey lived after she got out of the hospital?<eos> With us.
It's been seven years.<eos> And you've been healthy for seven years.<eos> Which is why I'm glad you're strong enough to confront me like this.<eos> She's going down the rabbit hole.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Then let the past go. She can't.<eos> She needs to.<eos> - I was lied to!<eos> - You were protected. - From the truth?<eos> - From yourself.

- She is malfunctioning.<eos> - Not necessarily.<eos> Okay, seriously, you two...<eos> Is there any actual evidence of a malfunction?<eos> Do you want to tell them, or should I?<eos> There was an oversight.<eos> When I took the ship into the atmosphere on Galen 2, I neglected to initiate the electrostatic buffering sequence.<eos> As a result, one of the secondary capacitors failed.<eos> There was no serious damage.<eos> This time.
Yes.<eos> Three, come on!<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen to me! It's not real!<eos> Three!<eos> What?<eos> - Where is she? - What are you talking about?<eos> Who?<eos> - What did you do with her? - Who are you talking about?<eos> - Sara!
No, I'm massively discreet.<eos> But in this case I think you might be able to help him.<eos> And besides, he's the brother of a girl I care about.<eos> Well played.<eos> Liam, I love you!<eos> It's constant, isn't it?<eos> The fascination with Len and you and your family.<eos> Living life under the microscope, perpetual scrutiny.<eos> You must want to... step away from it all sometimes.<eos> Sometimes.
Paul Richardson seems intense.<eos> Right this way.<eos> We had hoped to have the second facility up by now, but we've been running into trouble every step of the way.<eos> How long until they're completed?<eos> It's hard to say, we're currently using all the power we produce, which is driving our construction schedule.<eos> Well we're prepared to upgrade all of the outdated copper lines to maximize output from the nuclear fission reactor within six weeks.<eos> And how long would you need to take the reactor offline to complete this?<eos> My team's been drilling in the SIM for months.<eos> Once the lines are laid we just need one short power cut for each junction box.<eos> With all due respect,
Cultural Revolution 101, Colin Handke, but I didn't get pregnant.<eos> They're saying you slept with him to get a good grade.<eos> - Did they show you the grade?<eos> - No. It was a B-minus.<eos> That doesn't say much about me, does it?<eos> I should stop doing this. No.<eos> What else did I do wrong?<eos> How many people did I sleep with in college?<eos> Let's drop it, okay?<eos> - No, how many?
- No. It was a B-minus.<eos> That doesn't say much about me, does it?<eos> I should stop doing this. No.<eos> What else did I do wrong?<eos> How many people did I sleep with in college?<eos> Let's drop it, okay?<eos> - No, how many?<eos> - It's not a good idea.<eos> How many did they say I slept with?<eos> Twenty-four.
Ugh, what's going on, Lawrence?<eos> Has Luke gotten to you?<eos> Luke and his sophist ways?<eos> I am expanding my investigation. Good.<eos> You need to stop these leaks.<eos> No, I'm expanding this investigation into the cause for this war. God.<eos> You liberals.<eos> You're destroying this country.<eos> - I'm not a liberal. - Then what are you?<eos> - A thinking independent.
- Then think about this.<eos> This country is being taken over from within.<eos> It's like the redcoats!<eos> They want us to bow to their socialist king. Come on, Red.<eos> Stop with the propaganda.<eos> - This isn't propaganda!<eos> - When you scream "war" every time there's a political disagreement, the people stop believing you when there is a war.<eos> There's no going back from that kind of language.<eos> Well, there is a war.<eos> Yes, with the Syrians.
That turned out well.<eos> Didn't hurt FDR's reputation.<eos> Think it'll hurt mine?<eos> I saw this, and it made me think of you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You never slept with Michael Moore.<eos> And I was an idiot.<eos> Gareth, um...<eos> I just think we're too different.<eos> Our politics, our jobs.

How could stemming the Mediterranean be good for the Reich?<eos> I don't know, Hans.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> It will have catastrophic effects on the earth.<eos> Our planet will pay a heavy price.<eos> And so will you two if we have to hear a political lecture.<eos> Come on, let's pick out the perfect spot.<eos> If they get down off their high horses, then they can join us.<eos> Have you had much experience with drugs?<eos> What kind of drugs?

No thanks.<eos> I don't, uh...<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I'm Hagan.<eos> Reverend.<eos> I saw you at Karen's service.<eos> - I'm not a Reverend anymore.<eos> - Right. No.<eos> Now you're... a what?<eos> A fighter.
now and for all eternity.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> Heil Hitler!<eos> Each cufflink is finely crafted with the black enamel Gothic style letter L on an engraved ground of scrollworks surrounded by a delicate gold frame with bronze hold-backs on verso.<eos> These, are, of course, the very monogrammed sleeve buttons worn by President Abraham Lincoln on that fateful night of April 14, 1865, and were later authenticated by the President's own son, Robert Lincoln, in 1922.<eos> Why are they not advertised in your catalog?<eos> Uh, well, obviously, uh, for insurance purposes.<eos> Insurance purposes?<eos> Yes. These... These would double my premium.<eos> Perhaps another day.
Kim was our everything-- she was sweet, kind.<eos> Incredible sense of humor.<eos> - She played soccer, didn't she?<eos> - Used to watch her run up and down the field.<eos> Never got tired, she just kept running, big smile on her face.<eos> She had such a beautiful smile.<eos> - It's obvious you loved her very much.<eos> - I didn't just love her. I tried to protect her.<eos> I warned her about boys.<eos> Drugs.
I can't go back to having it last.<eos> - Jessica, if you don't do this, you're not gonna have it anywhere.<eos> - Then so be it.<eos> Besides, we both know lawyers are nothing but power-hungry bottom-feeders, anyway.<eos> - You two don't look like .Jessica Pearson.<eos> Then again, it doesn't really matter, because in 15 minutes, your firm is no longer going to be in the employ of this company. - Maybe not.<eos> But while we are, I think you're gonna need one more chair.<eos> - What're you talking about?<eos> - We're talking about your brand new largest shareholder. - What shareholder?<eos> - Hey, guy.
Back there. What's that about?<eos> What you do with it is up to you.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That what you just did was some kind of audition?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why?<eos> The rules?<eos> You think that's how he feels?<eos> There are no victims.<eos> Only volunteers.
All right. Well, is this the guy?<eos> Thank you, sir, for letting her use the phone.<eos> You want to tell me what happened?<eos> Some asshole hit me and took my backpack... and my phone.<eos> Well, we'll get you another phone.<eos> What did he look like?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A homeless guy.<eos> Did he hit you with his fist or with his open hand?<eos> His hand.
Oh, hey, what's this?<eos> "Truly sorry I missed you last night.<eos> "Please give me a second chance.<eos> This whole thing is my fault."<eos> "This whole thing is my fault."<eos> Oh, my god, this is from Riley!<eos> Riley?<eos> Is that a guy or a girl?<eos> She's a girl.<eos> Girl?
Is that a guy or a girl?<eos> She's a girl.<eos> Girl?<eos> Wow.<eos> My gaydar's way off.<eos> My little Emma's gotta keep on winning that prize money.<eos> We spent her last prize on a treadmill.<eos> Not for me, for her.<eos> She just can't lose that baby fat.<eos> How 'bout you?
I used to do that all the time, you know, talk to the families.<eos> But ever since we had kids, the worst part of the job, hands down.<eos> Actually, I used to think I was helping those people.<eos> You are helping those people.<eos> Her name is Renee.<eos> Single mom, registered nurse.<eos> Her husband Tony was killed in Afghanistan 6 years ago.<eos> Did Francesca walk to school the same way every day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> With her brother.
Sorry.<eos> I didn't expect to find you here.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Yes.<eos> We've met.<eos> Been a while.<eos> I think you must be mistaken.<eos> I would've remembered you.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Alvarez.
- Extremely rare.<eos> I want this patient.<eos> I did have the genetic test done, and it came back positive for GSS.<eos> I built the hospital for all the wrong reasons.<eos> Does that really matter?<eos> I'm so sorry, James.<eos> Dr. Wallace, did you have a good weekend back in Ohio?<eos> Hope you and Julianna got some quality time.<eos> - Juli...<eos> - Your wife.
That is such great news.<eos> Even Bashir is impressed.<eos> Right, honey?<eos> I'm still waiting to see if it holds.<eos> But... it is working.<eos> We did want to talk to you about one more thing.<eos> We think it might be possible to develop a technology to activate your optic nerve digitally.<eos> Are you...?<eos> You're saying he might be able to see again?<eos> Not with his eyes.
Do you know how long I've been sittin' on death row?<eos> 12 years.<eos> I read your file.<eos> And for the last ten of 'em, I've been writing letters and begging any lawyer to listen to my story.<eos> And they finally get around to getting back to me, and they don't even have the courtesy of sending' me a real lawyer?<eos> Mr. Bailey, trust me, I will fight for you.<eos> You're a student.<eos> You can't do shit for me.<eos> Well, you know what? You killed two people.<eos> In cold blood.
Son of a bitch, it's the prune juice all over again.<eos> What the?<eos> Hey, douche stick.<eos> Are you responsible for my mugs being here?<eos> I didn't--I don't--we didn't have anything else to use.<eos> I don't give a shit!<eos> Take those things and put 'em back where--<eos> Well, if it isn't Louis Shit.<eos> What's happening, boss?<eos> You bastard.
Donna, look, I called you so that I didn't want to have this argument with him.<eos> Now, I don't have much time.<eos> Are you gonna do this for me or not?<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Then I also need you to tell him something else for me.<eos> If he comes here to try to change my mind, I'm not gonna see him.<eos> You mind telling me who the hell said you can dump Nathan Byrnes' stock without talking to us?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Who's Nathan Byrnes?<eos> CEO of Exodyne.
What's that?<eos> I'm unwinding my position with Nathan Byrnes' company.<eos> Well, I appreciate that.<eos> But I don't need to take home the paper trail.<eos> It's not a paper trail.<eos> It's an engagement letter.<eos> Turns out my attorney was filing my positions before he had to, so I let him go.<eos> You want me to take you as a client.<eos> If you'll have me.<eos> On one condition.
You have a dream, and now you're questioning if I feel bad about what I did that night?<eos> You still haven't answered whether or not you do.<eos> You know what? You need to be pissed off at me to deal with your shit, you go right ahead.<eos> But I feel horrible about what happened that night, and for your information, the guy that I hit is fully recovered right now, and I'm still in here paying for this shit.<eos> Break out the champagne, Louis.<eos> That house in the Hamptons is gonna be yours into 90 days.<eos> - They accepted my offer?<eos> - That they did.<eos> Well, then I have something much better than champagne...<eos> Wood.
Do you, uh... want to sit down?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, thanks. I'll...<eos> I'll stand. What, uh... what brings you here?<eos> Nothing much.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> From your husband.<eos> I have no idea what it says.<eos> I'm just the messenger.<eos> You?<eos> A messenger?
I don't, anyway.<eos> What did you hit?<eos> I guess Tyler was seasick, leaning over the edge, and... I didn't see the buoy until the boat clipped it.<eos> This is murder we're looking at.<eos> Maybe... maybe we can leave some of it out of the report, but, I mean, you're gonna have to help us take down Ng.<eos> What do you mean, help you bring him down?<eos> We set it up.<eos> You go in.<eos> - We got eyes on...<eos> - Like, undercover?
I didn't do it.<eos> - Get him in, interview one.<eos> - I'll talk to Al.<eos> If it's not Al, I want my lawyer here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> OK, who is doing the interview?<eos> Me and Hank.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Do you have a problem?<eos> Not with you.
Get her ass in here.<eos> Huh. It's Jim Radovick's statement.<eos> Yeah, he's in the interview room next door.<eos> Says the whole thing was your idea.<eos> You wanted the witness killed, arranged payment.<eos> You're the mastermind, basically.<eos> Well, he's lying.<eos> Everybody lies, Sloane, one way or another.<eos> What matters is credibility...<eos> In front of a judge, in front of a jury, in front of us.
One's in jail on an assault charge.<eos> And then, uh, there's this guy.<eos> - Carl Dougherty.<eos> Son of...<eos> - Mark Dougherty?<eos> A cop?<eos> Mark Dougherty was killed in the line of duty.<eos> The night he died at Chicago Med, the line of cops waiting to pay their respects wrapped all the way around the place.<eos> Yeah, he was a solid cop.<eos> Even a better man.
Go, go, go!<eos> This is our cop killer.<eos> Body found is Martin Fuller.<eos> He's Carl's roommate.<eos> There was a 9mm at close range.<eos> M.E. believes he was killed 36 hours ago, before the first officer was shot.<eos> Now, Ruzek said Carl's journals spelled out his plans to the letter.<eos> Blueprints, escape routes.<eos> He's got everything down in detail.<eos> Yeah, except his endgame.
That might be an exception.<eos> Hey, you seen any good movies, lately?<eos> No. Um-mm.<eos> But I did watch a bunch of cat videos this morning.<eos> Marshall: Absolutely not settling, Bob.<eos> I'm not the kind of guy who settles, Bob.<eos> Everybody in the office knows that.<eos> Settling is for settlers and I don't think that's what we want, is it?<eos> What are we, Bob?<eos> Pioneers?
Now you choose to stop judging my life choices?<eos> Knock, knock!<eos> Mr. Dobbs...<eos> Renee, what are you doing here?<eos> I asked her to bring by some papers for me to sign.<eos> But congratulations are in order.<eos> Tucker just announced his engagement.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> To who?<eos> To her?
I asked her to bring by some papers for me to sign.<eos> But congratulations are in order.<eos> Tucker just announced his engagement.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> To who?<eos> To her?<eos> Hey, Missy, you better watch your tone.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not to her, not to anyone.
Stay with me.<eos> Somebody help!<eos> Hey... please...<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - He's not waking up.<eos> LeSean, come on.<eos> - Wake up.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> He's going into a coma, which is what happens.<eos> Near the end.
They hold fights at, uh, parties, private events.<eos> Really good money.<eos> Green Zones?<eos> Yeah, you ever been on the other side?<eos> Oh, man, the food they put up, and the women...<eos> Hell, even the room you're in.<eos> The best part about it... is how clean it is.<eos> It's immaculate.<eos> They ever have, uh, fights in the executive clubs?<eos> Well, yeah, sometimes.
I was once fucking this guy who would breathe on every thrust...<eos> You're so young!<eos> You're so young!<eos> I masturbate about that all the time.<eos> I masturbate a lot these days.<eos> Especially when I'm bored.<eos> Or angry.<eos> Or upset.<eos> Can we just... Or happy.<eos> Amazing.
It's really a business birthday thing.<eos> It won't be much fun, so just don't expect a "party" party.<eos> I won't.<eos> And maybe... just wear trousers.<eos> And don't drink too much.<eos> There's this huge promotion in Finland, so this party is quite a serious...<eos> I mean, it's basically a business meeting.<eos> Sounds like a blast.<eos> Can I bring a date?<eos> - Harry?
I won't.<eos> And maybe... just wear trousers.<eos> And don't drink too much.<eos> There's this huge promotion in Finland, so this party is quite a serious...<eos> I mean, it's basically a business meeting.<eos> Sounds like a blast.<eos> Can I bring a date?<eos> - Harry?<eos> - No.<eos> Who?
It's like having sex with a protractor.<eos> I'm finishing.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm done.<eos> - I'm done. - OK.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Amazing.
Stop it!<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just ticklish.<eos> Examined your sister this morning. Did you?<eos> Does she...<eos> - Is she all right?<eos> Did she seem all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just... can't get hold of her.<eos> She seemed very busy.<eos> Sure.
That's because you try to out-brute it.<eos> We're going to outsmart it!<eos> So... I can help?<eos> I could use your experience dealing with these things.<eos> It just doesn't seem fair.<eos> Why's that?<eos> With you and me teaming up, that thing won't stand a chance.<eos> [ Both laughing ]<eos> Yeah!<eos> After it!
This is perfect!<eos> I've just concocted a flawless Peri-plan!<eos> So what's the P.P.?<eos> If I use my metal powers, the whole thing will fall onto the monster!<eos> Give it a try!<eos> Carefully...<eos> [ Snarling ]<eos> It's...not falling.<eos> Maybe another leg needs to go.<eos> [ Gasps ]
I guess you could say she had a...short fuse?<eos> [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs ]<eos> [ Chuckles ] Easy crowd, huh?<eos> Where'd you get 'em?<eos> I made them myself.<eos> But, Smoky, I think what we really want to know is... who are you?<eos> Who is...<eos> Smoky...<eos> Quartz?<eos> Uh, well, between the fight and now, yeah,
I played with him.<eos> I just wanna go say hey.<eos> Room 308.<eos> - Strasmore?<eos> - Hey, Ed.<eos> What the hell are you doing in Ohio?<eos> Well, I thought maybe we could talk.<eos> My number hasn't changed, but maybe you lost that, too.<eos> - Ed, it'll only take a minute, please.<eos> - Maybe some other time, Spence. Ah!
Flora called her Priscilla.<eos> Priscilla?<eos> You know her?<eos> I know where she likes to play.<eos> I felt horrible about Lee.<eos> The only reason the police were questioning her about Mason's death... was because of me.<eos> I figured the only real way to clear Lee's name was to find Flora, alive.<eos> If we didn't... nothing would save my sister.<eos> Your little spirit kidnapper likes to hang on the periphery, with the others.<eos> - Others?
I built them.<eos> You're not...<eos> You're not alive.<eos> No, The Butcher killed me.<eos> I will keep her from killing you.<eos> No more, no less.<eos> Is that why you appeared?<eos> To save us?<eos> No. You're my bane.<eos> My ruin.
Okay, back to one everybody!<eos> It's just so bloody dark in here.<eos> I made the mistake of looking right into the flame, and then, you know, the rest of the world went dark.<eos> Oh, that's funny to you?<eos> It's just your accent.<eos> Mm. It's hilarious. I l-love listening to it.<eos> I could listen to it all day. Oh, really?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Do you... hey, um... Would you, actually, think about ever having dinner with me, maybe?<eos> With you?
Audrey, you are red and blue.<eos> You are the color of the sun.<eos> So bright, and hot!<eos> So hot!<eos> Sorry, Mom.<eos> I promise to eternally, forever, love the shit out of you.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Oh, this is where I had my first on-camera love scene.<eos> And second.<eos> And third.
Yes.<eos> We were worried about you.<eos> That girl.<eos> Laurie?<eos> Laurie.<eos> You should know, through all of this, she was your strongest advocate.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Sir?<eos> I'm her... what's that word?<eos> Gravy train...
- Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He wants to get together for drinks, and I just... I wanted to check in with you before I responded to him.<eos> Daniel, you do whatever you like.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Hey, Peter... your husband is a divorce attorney, isn't he?<eos> Best in the city.<eos> Text me his number.<eos> - I can do this.<eos> - With what?
Anything?<eos> Nothing but clots.<eos> I don't see it.<eos> I got to get behind the lungs.<eos> Still has a carotid pulse.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Rib perforated the aorta.<eos> - Can you clamp it?<eos> - With what?<eos> My hand?
- Take over?<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr. Choi. Dr. Choi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I know I was off on my original diagnosis, but that won't happen again. You can trust me.<eos> Clark, you're here to learn.<eos> You're gonna make mistakes, okay?<eos> Jeff?<eos> I need you to run this portable bypass, Satinsky clamps, and ten units of packed cells out to Dr. Halstead at the marathon aid station, okay?<eos> - Run?
A portable bypass?<eos> You can't regulate blood flow to the brain.<eos> Well, you can debate the medicine with Dr. Halstead when he gets here.<eos> Believe me, I will.<eos> There's blood in the tube.<eos> Saturation's 75%.<eos> Must be a pulmonary laceration.<eos> We got to pack his lung and get the blood out of that tube before he drowns.<eos> You want to pack the chest, and I'll suction the tube?<eos> - With what free hand?
Dr. Vorspan, was the patient wearing any earrings?<eos> No, why?<eos> They think she gave 'em to that convict downstairs, and he swallowed them.<eos> You think you've seen everything.<eos> - We'll need wire cutters soon.<eos> - Yes, doctor.<eos> You know they did a study once on oxytocin.<eos> College students exposed to high levels of it just started giving their money away.<eos> Did you see how freely she interacted with that man?<eos> Just a total stranger?
As we have discussed, it appears to be a simple empty box.<eos> Yes, one lined with a rare alloy and emitting energy readings off the charts that drove six men insane, but yeah.<eos> - Simple empty box. - Right.<eos> Well...<eos> Y-You joked about how it would be less of a puzzle if Schrodinger's cat were in there.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> But did get me thinking.<eos> What if there is something in there in an unobservable quantum state?<eos> - Out of phase with visible light?
He'll nap for an hour.<eos> May, what happened?<eos> Did you say something that made him...?<eos> Shame Simmons couldn't come with us.<eos> Seems the new parameters at HQ come with nothing but more paperwork.<eos> Yeah, you're telling me.<eos> Inventory before deployment? I mean, this is a-a lot of numbers.<eos> I'm a mechanic, not an accountant.<eos> You're an engineer, Mack.<eos> And a small tank.
He's... not an Inhuman. - Huh?<eos> - I'm not sure what he is. I am. He's a killer.<eos> That truck heist in East L.A... three people were brutally murdered.<eos> - What if they deserved it?<eos> - Is that how it is now?<eos> You're running with a vigilante who decides who lives or dies?<eos> I'm not running with anyone.<eos> But he can't be all bad.<eos> He came here tonight and he saved Fitz's life.<eos> Yeah, but from what? What...
I've heard rumors from your part of the world about a man with a flaming skull.<eos> Always seemed like an urban legend to me.<eos> You've managed to escape capture all this time.<eos> And we nab you in a parking lot.<eos> That's got to hurt.<eos> We got facts, too.<eos> Robbie Reyes... Dropped out of Garfield High.<eos> Took work at Canelo Auto and Body to help pay the rent.<eos> A halfway decent driver.<eos> With a few bad habits.
Excellent choice.<eos> Hello, James.<eos> Uh, go see Sean. Uh, he'll take care of you.<eos> Agent Simmons.<eos> How are you? Surprised to see S.H.I.E.L.D. at my doorstep and with the infamous vigilante in tow.<eos> Quake now, isn't it?<eos> I didn't come up with it. But it's growing on me.<eos> Burning the candle at both ends.<eos> Speaking of burning, fireworks?<eos> Really? With your powers?
Tío, I'm... I'm just trying to understand, man.<eos> I only know what you told me...<eos> That you put a beatdown on your boss, that he deserved it.<eos> Why?<eos> Who is she?<eos> Dr. Lucy Bauer.<eos> Joseph's wife.<eos> You put him into a coma.<eos> What were they getting into up there?<eos> Madness.
It's fascinating.<eos> And now it is going to get me sacked.<eos> Did you know there are over 212 micro-expressions that can betray a lie?<eos> One eye dart to the left, and I'm finished.<eos> Unlike some people, I'm terrible at keeping secrets.<eos> So... it is about the polygraph.<eos> All right, well, okay.<eos> Well, look, I'll just stay here, and I'll help you practice.<eos> We could do the... the penny in the shoe thing<eos> - and the thumbtack under the tongue.
I don't trust the new director, and if Simmons doesn't call me back soon, I swear, I'm gonna...<eos> You worried about her safety, or are you two going through something?<eos> Not sure.<eos> Maybe both.<eos> Power.<eos> Yeah. It's power.<eos> Momentum couldn't produce enough energy at their lab, so she needs a place with more power.<eos> Start looking into it.<eos> Are you still beating yourself up about that night?<eos> What night?
Melinda, don't you dare.<eos> Mace: You wanted to speak?<eos> Yes, sir, I, uh...<eos> I think I've found a workable lead to track down Eli Morrow, from one of May's better ideas.<eos> Then let's hear it.<eos> Remember the head of the Chinatown Crew that ordered the heist of these boxes...<eos> Chen? He got infected by Lucy, went through the same thing I did.<eos> Until his brains hemorrhaged all over the lab.<eos> Well, before that, he spent two years in South Ridge Penitentiary.<eos> With Mr. Morrow.
You can't handle it.<eos> You'll hurt yourself.<eos> Perhaps I could read the book.<eos> Absolutely not. No, no.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Aspirations of a do-gooder.<eos> So?<eos> She's a scientist and braver than you, apparently.<eos> Here's the thing... Aida's not exactly my assistant.<eos> Or human.
Yeah, well, she's not human.<eos> Aida, the book. Read the book.<eos> Read the book!<eos> [Sighs] Perhaps I could read the book.<eos> I'm sorry. What did you mean... "not human"?<eos> Because Radcliffe and I built her, okay?<eos> Her mind can't be corrupted because it's just programming.<eos> She's a perfect fit.<eos> She's a robot?<eos> An android.
I mean, she did, after all, bring you and Agent Fitz back from ... well, wherever the hell you were.<eos> If a similar technology is in play, she could have a solve.<eos> What? You disagree?<eos> - I don't, actually.<eos> - But...?<eos> All cards on the table?<eos> Aida's an android.<eos> She's ...<eos> W-What did you just say?<eos> - An android.
Hey. Where you going?<eos> I was just gonna grab you a beer.<eos> - Not thirsty.<eos> - Look...<eos> I know you're leaving 'cause of me, and I wish you wouldn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, it's because... I recently, uh... I went to a bad place ... in my head, I mean, and, uh, I wanted to talk.<eos> Unless you're saying that we're not friends anymore.<eos> Friends?
Intelligence gathering is one level above us.<eos> You might be giving him too much there.<eos> He sure can drink.<eos> Okay if I pour you one?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sir, can I ask a question?<eos> Sure, go ahead and ask.<eos> They say Park's opposition has brought in Prosecutor Oh...<eos> Then are you his lapdog?<eos> Lapdog?
That's why I said to keep your distance from Tae.<eos> Still, he's been my guard dog for over a decade.<eos> Let's not think of the bad stuff, is my attitude.<eos> But you have to put him aside.<eos> I don't like you advising me.<eos> It sounds like you're ordering me.<eos> I was only thinking things over from your perspective.<eos> People generally don't think from other perspectives.<eos> They just think of themselves.<eos> - Except for you.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.<eos> He and my sister are friends, and she vouched for you.<eos> She don't even know me.<eos> I know you.<eos> Simple as that?<eos> Sometimes.
It's the best thing that ever happened to them.<eos> But you...<eos> When you've had a booster shot, you're a pain in the ass.<eos> And when you haven't, you just sort of fade into oblivion.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd say your heart's not in it.<eos> You react, but you don't act.<eos> I need you to take the initiative here.<eos> We are preparing to go to war.<eos> And you should be the hero at the front of my army.<eos> My Ajax. My Achilles.
Am I dead?<eos> (all three) Good morning, Sleepy Head.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Shh.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> That was a bad sunburn.<eos> Perfect.<eos> My oils work miracles.<eos> Never go outside without UV protection.<eos> And Z protection.
Anywho, that's Pablo, my third husband.<eos> Death by slit throat, poor thing.<eos> Do you know what a Colombian Necktie is?<eos> Well it ain't been an easy apocalypse for nobody.<eos> Oh, this was way before day one.<eos> ♪<eos> This is my niece's hair.<eos> She was a beauty queen, real pretty.<eos> Got her head severed in a freak Z accident.<eos> All that wasted hair.
Do you know who else is obsessed with me?<eos> Hezbollah, ISIS, the Sinaloa Cartel.<eos> Any one of them would happily murder our family if it would further their agenda.<eos> So, you know, that's fun to live with.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> It's just that, a lot of times, stalkers have a personal relationship with their victims.<eos> I had a bad feeling about this kid then, and I still have it now.<eos> Fine.<eos> Y-You want to talk to the FBI, you can talk to the FBI.<eos> On one condition.
You know you don't have to say "ma'am"<eos> after every time, Captain.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just, habit.<eos> And also... nerves.<eos> You're kind of my hero.<eos> Happens to the best of us.<eos> You're on secondment to Oliver Shaw<eos> - from CyberCom?
China gets it, believe me.<eos> So do I.<eos> We're on it.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're a Panda-Cammer, too?<eos> Shut up.<eos> It's relaxing.<eos> It's good for my blood pressure.<eos> Who saw that coming?<eos> A-mazing.
--casualties have been medevacked.<eos> Live from Shibuya.<eos> I can see many cars ablaze at Shibuya Crossing.<eos> The destruction is like a war zone.<eos> --the area is closed off.<eos> The cause remains unknown.<eos> Kurono!

I'm okay?<eos> The suit protected you.<eos> Come on!<eos> Who did it?<eos> -He's lying!<eos> -Are you?<eos> Who are they?<eos> You have a Tokyo accent.<eos> Are you the Osaka team?<eos> Osaka team?
Watch me get a bull's-eye on that thing!<eos> I will make it home.<eos> For sure.<eos> What the...?<eos> They're not in position yet...<eos> Wait.<eos> Let me ask you.<eos> Why are we... killing each other?<eos> Do you feel that you're in God's presence?<eos> God?
How do I explain?<eos> Many years ago, the kingdom I come from came under attack by a powerful menace.<eos> The only one in any position who could save us was the princess, but she never fully embraced who she was, what a hero she could be.<eos> And as a result, our kingdom was lost.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> I'm so sorry. What kingdom was it?<eos> It's in the past, and it's no longer important, except for what can be learned from it.<eos> If you want these children to reach their potential, you need to lead by example.<eos> That means asserting your strength and embracing who you really are...<eos> Snow White.
Is this something to do with why Adam was killed?<eos> Of course it bloody matters.<eos> Tell me the truth, Bill.<eos> What did you say to my brother?<eos> Why can't you leave things well alone, eh?<eos> Why do you have to pick at things, girl, over and over again?<eos> What were you arguing about?<eos> You're not going to like it, Claire...<eos> He was seeing someone else, another woman...<eos> Just before the wedding,
Help me understand, please.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> Commander, I, uh...<eos> I think that the killer admires you.<eos> The knight is the protector of the realm.<eos> In chess, that is a very powerful weapon in close positions.<eos> I think he sees you as a potentially dangerous adversary, unlike the victims, who were mere pawns, expendable foot soldiers.<eos> This is just my opinion, but I think that the chess metaphor, with the people moving around and the thing with... I don't, uh...<eos> I don't buy it, personally.<eos> No disrespect, Miss Brown.
I mean, I grew up watching him, so that's probably why, but you... you seem like the, um...<eos> the Daniel Craig type, right?<eos> I suppose we can't all be Sean Connery.<eos> Well, how about this?<eos> That's $20 million worth of diamonds right there.<eos> I bet that's more than an MI6 pension.<eos> Commander, we both know I'm not going to be here for long.<eos> My government will insist that I be extradited.<eos> In the meantime how about a cup of tea?<eos> Milk and sugar.
Mr. Caplan, you know I can't tell you that.<eos> Okay. Mr. Caplan.<eos> Message received.<eos> It must be exhausting.<eos> Losers like me blather on all day about our problems.<eos> Well...<eos> I can tell you my parents weren't diplomats.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What did your dad really do?<eos> Nothing interesting.
You have to make a decision.<eos> Are you gonna let one twist of fate decide who you are?<eos> Dad, I found something...<eos> Something... God, it'll end her.<eos> It'll end Elizabeth Krauss.<eos> I just need one last piece, and then...<eos> Then when we go to the board and tell them what I found.<eos> Call me as soon as you can.<eos> Hello...<eos> Aaron.
Yeah, just... surprised...<eos> I thought the procedure was going to be done here.<eos> Well, had to move it up.<eos> I sent the surgical team to Arcadia to change the companion's face.<eos> Couldn't risk them being spotted on site.<eos> - Smart. - Mm.<eos> Let's get set up.<eos> Who was she?<eos> Her?<eos> Someone desperate.
Let's talk business.<eos> If I wanted to listen to an old hag talk dirty, I'd give my mom a call.<eos> Your mother's dead.<eos> Like hell she is.<eos> Lung cancer in '69.<eos> Right before you joined Spiga.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> She would've been so proud of you.<eos> It's what I do, son.<eos> Enough with the chitchat.
It's what I do, son.<eos> Enough with the chitchat.<eos> How do I crack it?<eos> I could encode a skeleton key for you.<eos> That would bypass the self-destruct protocol.<eos> Good.<eos> Just say when so I can get the hell out of this shithole.<eos> When was the last time you were out here?<eos> Out here?<eos> Outside the wall.
Would you like to come take a look inside?<eos> You realize what you've done, don't you, George?<eos> What's that?<eos> You've inserted yourself directly into our family.<eos> Yes, I suppose I have.<eos> I wonder how that will work out for you.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Well, he hasn't really been successful at much.<eos> I do hope you have deep pockets.<eos> William.
In time.<eos> I was hoping you might come with me.<eos> I'm going to see the building lot I was telling you about.<eos> The one overlooking the Don Ravine?<eos> It could be perfect for us.<eos> You go.<eos> I trust your judgment.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Another time.
She told me I was well past the age Rodney was interested in.<eos> But she's wrong, you know.<eos> - Of course. - Now that Ruth is gone, everyone will see that.<eos> Miss Fairhurst, have you ever spent time in an institution?<eos> Who told you?<eos> Have you?<eos> My father had me committed ten years ago.<eos> He had hoped to cure me of my fear.<eos> - Fear of what?<eos> - Fire.
And lying is not a crime.<eos> - You buried a body.<eos> - Prove it.<eos> I just might.<eos> But until then, you're free to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, uh, the Murphys may still have it in for you.<eos> - You should watch your back.<eos> - I will.<eos> William...
Mr. Shanley, how does it feel to be a free man?<eos> Incredible.
Detective Murdoch?<eos> Well, I can tell you he's a good man.<eos> - He put an innocent man in prison.<eos> - I highly doubt that.<eos> He's the best investigator this city has.<eos> And an even better friend, mind you.<eos> You know him personally?<eos> Few know him better.<eos> So you're top chums, then?<eos> - Dearest friends?
Well, I can tell you he's a good man.<eos> - He put an innocent man in prison.<eos> - I highly doubt that.<eos> He's the best investigator this city has.<eos> And an even better friend, mind you.<eos> You know him personally?<eos> Few know him better.<eos> So you're top chums, then?<eos> - Dearest friends?<eos> - Top chums?
He's having another look in Shanley's rooms.<eos> Let us suppose for a moment that Mr. Shanley is guilty of this current murder.<eos> Now, does that make him more or less likely to be guilty of the first?<eos> More likely, I would say.<eos> If a man kills once, it seems logical he might kill again.<eos> Are you the same man today you were yesterday?<eos> Yes. Of course.<eos> Your hair is not the same.<eos> You cut and discarded it.<eos> Same with your fingernails.
In fact, he refuses to speak to us altogether.<eos> Surely we have enough evidence to put him away.<eos> We found the murder weapon in Mr. Shanley's home the first time, as well.<eos> We shouldn't take anything for granted in this case.<eos> Well, Detective.<eos> The afternoon edition says you've managed to fabricate evidence against Shanley once again.<eos> Me?<eos> Aside from setting foot at the crime scene, I haven't interfered at all.<eos> The newspapers seem to think the constable who found the murder weapon is your...<eos> "top chum."
Can I entrust nothing to those fools?<eos> Is everything all right, Detective?<eos> The ignorami at Station One have done it again.<eos> I clearly told them to release the man who looks like Karl Marx.<eos> They've let out some fellow who's as clean-shaven as bloody Kierkegaard.<eos> Who?<eos> Maybe I wasn't clear in my instructions.<eos> Ah well, duty calls.<eos> Fine working with you gents.<eos> You as well.
William, this research.<eos> Miss Franklin wasn't working with pure arsenic.<eos> She was using arsenic compounds.<eos> - We know arsenic kills but when...<eos> - In combination with other elements,<eos> - could also cure.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Some of these formulas are very sophisticated.<eos> She had been using rats as test subjects.<eos> With some success.
It seems to be catching on.<eos> I will not have you copying some toffee-nosed prat repeating another toffee nosed prat.<eos> The sport is called football, Crabtree, plain and simple.<eos> Sir, should the nickname not be adopted?<eos> I mean, we already have another sport known as football.<eos> It is somewhat confusing.<eos> Should a sport wherein the players pick up the ball in their hands and run down the field be called football, or should it be the sport wherein the players kick a ball with their feet? !<eos> George, why don't you walk us through<eos> - Robert Semple's final hours?<eos> - Sir, gladly. Um...
I think Semple and I parted ways about 2:30, though I wouldn't swear to it.<eos> And that was the last you saw of him until this morning?<eos> Right. Or, perhaps not.<eos> - Explain, Mr. Gourley.<eos> - After I left the speakeasy I got a bit turned around.<eos> I managed to find my way back there and I saw someone, who I think was Semple, stumbling out of a laneway.<eos> I called out but he didn't turn around.<eos> Maybe it wasn't him.<eos> What laneway was this?<eos> Outside the speakeasy?
Well, you didn't do a very good job of it.<eos> Don't think I don't know that.<eos> I wouldn't normally leave him in that state, but we had a big match in a few hours, and I needed sleep.<eos> - What time did you leave?<eos> - Just before 2 AM.<eos> And that's the last you saw of Mr. Semple?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's the truth, I swear it.<eos> Sir.<eos> Ah, Murdoch.
Well, sir, Jack Gourlay saw someone stumbling out into the laneway.<eos> Well, that could have been Semple.<eos> Or it could have been his attacker.<eos> If Semple was stabbed outside the speakeasy, we would surely have found evidence of it by now.<eos> Well, I don't believe he was stabbed outside the speakeasy.<eos> But... somewhere nearby.<eos> An over-sized thimble, just as Jack Gourlay described it.<eos> Good work, Murdoch. And only a block away from the speakeasy.<eos> We may yet find our crime scene.<eos> - Murdoch. - Ah?
Look, I can see what you're thinking.<eos> It's far too great a coincidence that the victim's blood ended up on the steps of my hotel...<eos> - That is the sum of it, yes.<eos> - Come now, Tom.<eos> You've known me for years.<eos> - You know the type of man I am.<eos> - Nobby...<eos> And you know I've no time for anything other than preparing my team for the biggest competition of their lives.<eos> It's not every day the Olympic Games come calling.<eos> Murdoch.
May I present my sister, Ruth Newsome, of the esteemed...<eos> Of the MiMico Newsome's.<eos> Roger is so thrilled to be joining the constabulary.<eos> So I just, well, I had to come and see what it was all about.<eos> He hasn't "joined" the constabulary, Miss Newsome.<eos> Ruth, this is constable Crabtree.<eos> The bright, young, unmarried constable I was telling you about.<eos> And what about this one?<eos> Yes, that's constable Higgins, But constable Crabtree is my dear friend.<eos> A top chum.
Or rather he mistakenly thought you'd prepared it.<eos> Detective Murdoch.<eos> Yes, George, please come and collect Mr. Newsome and bring him to the morgue's cold storage for the night.<eos> Higgins...<eos> George, catch him!<eos> Oh Higgins, his hand went in my mouth!<eos> - Come on, George.<eos> - Ok. Here we go.<eos> Higgins, try to move his feet.<eos> His feet, like this.
Perhaps it was one of those aneurysms.<eos> My sister told me they can strike at any age.<eos> She's married to a doctor.<eos> Our coroner will determine the precise cause of death, Mrs. Fellowes.<eos> What did your husband say he was going to be doing last night?<eos> He said he would be home late.<eos> He was at a work function.<eos> What kind of work function?<eos> I don't know, but he was with Robert.<eos> Robert Roth.
I hope not, for George's sake.<eos> I love you, Nina!<eos> She's so comfortable out there.<eos> She's a real talent.<eos> - I've always admired her stage presence. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes, her stage presence is lovely.<eos> I hope to one day dance as well as Nina.<eos> You, Josie?<eos> You're a fine dancer.<eos> Very... charming.
And all were cruel to her.<eos> - Sir!<eos> - George?<eos> After resigning Mr. Nielsen's employ two years ago,<eos> Doris Strachan moved to New York City and never came back.<eos> The police there believe she committed suicide, but there was no body ever found.<eos> The problem is she doesn't match any of the witnesses' description.<eos> If she is alive, perhaps she's working with an accomplice.<eos> Or... she's a swan.<eos> A swan?
Another? Yes.<eos> Just call me Ten Tankard Tommy.<eos> Ten Tankard Tommy.<eos> Is there something troubling you, William?<eos> No.<eos> I heard James Pendrick dropped by the station today.<eos> He did.<eos> You should have brought him home.<eos> Oh, I think he's out with the inspector.<eos> - The inspector? - Hmm.
Then what, exactly, was I doing for you?<eos> Well, yes, it was a form of smuggling, all right.<eos> - I'm a police officer!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Always with the "bloody hell"!<eos> You're a better man than that.<eos> And it was the fact that you're a police officer that I felt it was safe with you.<eos> It?<eos> A container of an herb called Guarana.<eos> But not ordinary Guarana.
- Oh, Louise...<eos> A month ago?<eos> Nobody's done anything about it?<eos> Oh, George!<eos> For you.<eos> From your lady friend. - Louise?<eos> - No, your lady friend.<eos> Miss bloom?<eos> The gorgeous woman you're courting?<eos> With the eyes and the hair? - Yes, Jackson.
Well done, well done.<eos> So, Tanya flew three round-trip flights on Essence Airlines in the last month leading up to the crash.<eos> And all the flights have one thing in common.<eos> Bad food?<eos> Crying babies?<eos> Ken Fowler as copilot.<eos> So Ken and Tanya were having an airborne romance, not Ken and Taylor.<eos> So why didn't Taylor say any of this?<eos> Hey. So Ken was having an affair with Tanya.<eos> Not you.
Terrain... pull up.<eos> Terrain...<eos> You know what you did?<eos> I got five seconds more flight out of that plane.<eos> Five seconds is the difference between putting that plane down on an empty road or in a neighborhood filled with people.<eos> Taylor, you didn't want to relive it because you were afraid they were right...<eos> That you lost control, but you didn't.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Because you're a fighter.<eos> And a fighter pilot.
I thought closings were your thing.<eos> Yeah, when I was a prosecutor.<eos> But since then, I've been in mock court.<eos> You can lose 100 times and it doesn't matter, but today... only get one shot.<eos> I don't know if this helps, but when I played for Georgia, there was a rumor going around that someone on the team was gay.<eos> I remember that next practice, I tackled that quarterback so hard... he was out for a week.<eos> We lost our next game, but no one suspected that I was gay.<eos> It never occurred to them that a gay man could hit that hard.<eos> At least not until our ten-year reunion.<eos> Chunk.
Take the girl to a psychiatrist, yes.<eos> But first, let my excommunicated friend - interrogate her like she's in Guantanamo.<eos> - What?<eos> We need to do something for this girl.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - You lied to me, Tomas.<eos> I am very disappointed in you.<eos> From Rome?<eos> Your excommunication.<eos> The order effective immediately.
Such a tragedy.<eos> True love gone.<eos> What a shame.<eos> I'm just grateful that my sister survived.<eos> Imagine if the car had swerved the other way, it would have been Kat killed, not Julia.<eos> And Julia would have been the one with the busted knee.<eos> Um, 15 minutes till curtain.<eos> Let's maybe have our guests clear out.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Me?
If I were, would that stop you from talking about marriage?<eos> Even if you are, it won't make a difference... all this gay stuff is cool in the film industry<eos> You're right... from big stars to spot boys, everyone's gay... we call it 'Gollyvvood' now<eos> Really?<eos> Of course not!<eos> Do you people even listen to yourselves?<eos> It's such rubbish<eos> The film industry doesn't have more gay people, it's just more accepting... there must be many gay people in your office too... but sadly they have to hide the fact<eos> So, are you?<eos> A 'lesbd?
Okay.<eos> so please leave.<eos> I said leave.<eos> It's okay. You can go.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you have to say?<eos> There was a labor uprising at Daito Industries.<eos> We need you to go there and make a speech.<eos> you want me to read this?<eos> Oppressed?
Maybe he did it to show the killer.<eos> If he figured out who it was, this would definitely be blackmail-worthy.<eos> All the signs indicate that Aaron did determine who it was.<eos> But how?<eos> So I'm at a loss as to where to begin.<eos> The victim's name is Quentin Latham, and I think the guy stabbing him is one of the Dinacios.<eos> The crime family.<eos> This is the victim. No question.<eos> Quentin Latham was a big union leader.<eos> A reformer.
Maybe we'll get around to talking to all office workers everywhere, but we're starting with you.<eos> You failed to mention you are proficient in creating computer-generated imagery last time we spoke, Mr. Karig.<eos> I didn't think you'd come to hear about my hobbies.<eos> Look, if someone messed with the security tape, they could've made the kidnapper look like anyone. Yeah.<eos> You're a technical genius, Mr. Karig.<eos> No one here is accusing you of creative brilliance.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> I told you, I was home when this happened.<eos> When she was taken or when Kenneth Tolan got shot?<eos> Both.

You know all about Kanan Jarrus.<eos> Or should I use his real name?<eos> Caleb Dume.<eos> Yes, it was your idea to recruit the apprentice.<eos> And it was from here that the boy found...<eos> No, he stole the holocron. (LAUGHING)<eos> That wasn't so difficult, was it?<eos> So, you hid the holocron down there?<eos> More like I left it with someone.<eos> Someone? Who?
It's the new-new me.<eos> Like it?<eos> No sudden moves.<eos> Barry.<eos> Be a real damn shame if he wasn't such a screwup.<eos> Some people just do not listen.<eos> Are you dying?<eos> I am becoming.<eos> Becoming what?<eos> Moses?

He's like a naughty 53-year-old boy.<eos> Who is this guy?<eos> I'm not familiar with him.<eos> That's David Spade from Just Shoot Me!<eos> I don't know that one.<eos> He was in Grown-Ups, Joe Dirt,<eos> Saturday Night Live.<eos> Saturday what how?<eos> And he was also in some movie called Senseless.<eos> With Marlon Wayans?
Okay, so, now the bat has a gun, and the knives I gave him.<eos> What?<eos> Why would you give him knives? I didn't think it would matter.<eos> I was counting on this helicopter thing working.<eos> Peter?<eos> Wh-where are you?<eos> What's going on? In order to understand the bat, we must first understand the vampire.<eos> So I watched Interview With the Vampire.<eos> Cast your gaze upon...<eos> Lestat.
This is a song I wrote for my beautiful girlfriend.<eos> Her name is... ♪ Kim ♪<eos> ♪ I don't understand why your father ♪<eos> ♪ Has such problems with us ♪ ♪ Kim ♪<eos> ♪ Mostly I think it's because ♪ ♪ I don't make my car payments on time ♪<eos> ♪ But also because I was dating someone else ♪ ♪ At the same time as ♪ ♪ Kim ♪<eos> Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. ♪ Kim ♪<eos> ♪ I love you ♪<eos> ♪ But mostly I love that you let me eat crackers in the bed ♪<eos> ♪ Kim!
Governor, you can't target an innocent population because you're scared.<eos> - You have a responsibility...<eos> - To all my citizens.<eos> And my first and only priority is to make sure they're safe, something that Washington...<eos> If... if there even is such a place anymore... Has proven incapable of doing.<eos> Governor, the federal government was effectively snuffed out last night.<eos> There is no Congress, there is no Supreme Court.<eos> When it comes to the people of Michigan, I am the highest authority, and you have none over me.<eos> With all due respect, sir, I am the President.<eos> Not mine.
You mean the asset and us, right?<eos> Mm. Don't get insecure on me now, Jack.<eos> What happened?<eos> I think I just made them angrier.<eos> You want to trade places?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Guys, DMZ is just around that corner.<eos> It looks like the border guards know you're coming in hot.<eos> Can you take out the barricade?<eos> With what?
According to a federal ruling, you will be on conditional release, working off the remainder of your sentence under the employ of the Phoenix Foundation. A think tank.<eos> Now... how does a hacker like you get a deal like that?<eos> Personally, I'd like to believe good things happen to good people.<eos> Well, I have a few questions.<eos> Please answer truthfully, all right?<eos> Now, since your release, have you traveled outside the Los Angeles city limits?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Can I assume that since your arrest, you haven't even thought about touching a computer?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> What about alcohol?
When I make it, it's edible art.<eos> See, I know your game too well, bro. Ha.<eos> Seriously, it's not even any fun.<eos> I anticipate your every move.<eos> If by anticipate, you mean let me poster-ize you, then, yeah, sure. 8-8.<eos> You know, you got to feel bad for the defender getting punked like that.<eos> Yeah, it's easy to score when you push off like that.<eos> - Push off? Please.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 9-8.
You know, you got to feel bad for the defender getting punked like that.<eos> Yeah, it's easy to score when you push off like that.<eos> - Push off? Please.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 9-8.<eos> Game point.<eos> You got anything to say before I send you to the showers?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For Caracas.
Hi, Mr. Dalton.<eos> How's... life?<eos> Sorry, Pop, he didn't mean to be rude, he's just weird.<eos> Poor thing, he's a genius when it comes to physics, but when it comes to metaphysics, he's a little slow.<eos> Every time we get nearly killed, you come down here to talk to your dead dad, and I'm the weird one?<eos> Hey, it's little rituals like this that give life meaning.<eos> Besides, there's not a lot of people out there you can talk to about classified missions, and my old man can keep a secret.<eos> Can't you, Pop?<eos> Well, ready to go get almost killed again?<eos> Emphasis on "almost."
But how do you differentiate between unflinching and purely mad? Well, that's your job.<eos> Doesn't interest me all that much.<eos> It's about the light.<eos> That's what remains.<eos> And I'm counting on you to deliver.<eos> -You have a new assistant. Yes. Yes, I do.<eos> I know, you said I met her.<eos> I tried, but I can't remember that part.<eos> I do remember coming here though.<eos> With the chess piece.
I mean, I can't be the only one left, right?<eos> I'm sorry, but, no.<eos> Right, uh...<eos> Anyway, enough of those... Those dreary thoughts, right?<eos> So, what do you guys do for fun around here?<eos> Do you drink or dance or...<eos> Oh, hey, do they play Garata here?<eos> - What's Garata?<eos> - It's like soccer,<eos> - with dragons.
Now that you're here, I thought we might take the bond.<eos> You want to share minds.<eos> Yes. Would you honor me with that?<eos> I have customers.<eos> Can we talk about this some other time?<eos> We're gonna need a bigger block.<eos> This is awe and some.<eos> No, it... It's just "awesome."<eos> You got to put those two words together and you'll be golden.<eos> Awesome.
It's just gonna take some time to get used to having these abilities and... And living in the world.<eos> I know it's not easy for you to be nice to me.<eos> - Where I'm from and all.<eos> - That's not why I've been standoffish.<eos> And don't say I haven't been.<eos> My parents gave me so much.<eos> And I was so loved.<eos> My dad was a scientist and my mom fought for justice.<eos> They were proud, strong people.<eos> Good Kryptonians and even better parents.
Sometimes I wish I wasn't a good cop.<eos> I think you're a great cop.<eos> Are you getting soft on me?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I know in crappy moments like this, I could use a drink. So...<eos> What do you say?<eos> First round's on me.<eos> Oh, can't.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> Next time?
I think you're a great cop.<eos> Are you getting soft on me?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I know in crappy moments like this, I could use a drink. So...<eos> What do you say?<eos> First round's on me.<eos> Oh, can't.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> Next time?<eos> Yes. Next time.
I'm sorry.<eos> Is he...<eos> You showed up.<eos> Nobody's more surprised than me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> - Lead?<eos> - Couldn't make it too easy on you.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - A friend.
Okay. I give up.<eos> What's your favorite baseball team?<eos> That's the one with the hoop and the tall guys bouncing the ball, right?<eos> Oh. A courtship ring.<eos> You know, I've just learned that there is a long-standing mating ritual here where if you like it, you should've put a ring on it.<eos> Clearly you've been successful in this arena. So...<eos> But from the looks of you, she can't be that pretty.<eos> What do you call ugly women on this planet?<eos> Is it cats?<eos> No, dogs...
Come to me, Supergirl.<eos> But I should warn you.<eos> In the myths,<eos> Cadmus was really only famous for one thing.<eos> He killed monsters.<eos> J'onn, what're you doing here?<eos> I think the real question is, what are you doing here?<eos> I should have locked you in that laboratory when I had the chance.<eos> You're Hank Henshaw.<eos> The real Hank Henshaw.
I'll disappear.<eos> But I don't meet many people I care about.<eos> And I care about you.<eos> A lot.<eos> You've become really important to me.<eos> And, um,<eos> I hope one day, you and I could be friends.<eos> Because I don't want to imagine my life without you in it.<eos> Pool.<eos> Tomorrow night.
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> My blood is turning you into a White Martian.<eos> You're Hank Henshaw.<eos> The real Hank Henshaw.
So far there's plenty describing how to synthesize and disseminate the virus.<eos> But I... I don't think they ever even considered a cure.<eos> - What about Lena Luthor?<eos> - What about her?<eos> Lena's mother took the Kryptonian virus and synthesized it on Earth.<eos> If Lena is working with her...<eos> Lena was shocked to see Henshaw.<eos> He would've killed her, too.<eos> The Luthors are pretty good actors.<eos> Or, well, sociopaths.
Last night...<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I spoke to him.<eos> - Your father?
Are you insane?<eos> Come on, Jonah, you know me.<eos> I knew you.<eos> Little Jay, half the NYPD is looking for you right now.<eos> Including your friends.<eos> Who, trust me, are not your friends, so if you keep running, you're gonna die.<eos> Like it or not, I'm all you've got.<eos> If you come in with me, at least you got a shot.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.
Previously on "Freakish"...<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Grover.<eos> Grover Jones.<eos> Then why would you show up to Saturday detention when you don't have to?<eos> The primary goal is to get to the fire station.<eos> If it's still there.<eos> Good luck, man.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> LeSean.
Do I?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I crashed.<eos> I came to school to be with you.<eos> Oh, no, you're weirded out, aren't you?<eos> If you hadn't done that, you could have escaped.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or I might not be alive.<eos> Either way, I wouldn't be here right now.<eos> With you.
I know where you can find him.<eos> Still don't see anyone.<eos> It's been, like, 20 minutes.<eos> And where the hell is Grover?<eos> Better question is where the hell is Barrett?<eos> I just can't wrap my head around it.<eos> I mean, why would he do all that?<eos> Is it really that hard to understand?<eos> - He's a criminal.<eos> - Probably a psychopath.
Going in country alone?<eos> Agent Bannister was alone.<eos> I recruited her.<eos> She's my responsibility.<eos> I'm gonna find Sevchenko.<eos> And I'm gonna bring Agent Bannister home.<eos> So, where exactly are we supposed to find this Russian super genius?<eos> From the Bob Barker Studio at CBS in Hollywood, it's The Price Is Right!<eos> Oh, hold it.<eos> Not again.
That's three times now since we took off.<eos> So... what are you?<eos> Electrical engineer, a physicist, mechanic?<eos> A little bit of, uh, column A, - a little bit of column B. - Ah.<eos> One thing he's not is you.<eos> If we're gonna take down the bomb, I need you to teach me your code.<eos> So, your friend is brain and you are...?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, well, I'm-I'm kind of the muscle.<eos> You know, I get his back, we're a team.<eos> Team?
Computer keyboards are actually pretty simple.<eos> Pressing a key completes an electrical circuit.<eos> If you're missing some keys, you can use pretty much any other object.<eos> A bolt, a hook, a gear... The keyboard doesn't know the difference, as long as it completes the circuit.<eos> So, by attaching one wire to each of my new keys and another wire to my old Russian scientist, his touch sends the right signal and your computer thinks it's whole again.<eos> Bolt, hook, gear.<eos> Each is now a key.<eos> Your body is the ground, so when you touch them...<eos> My body completes the circuit, and I become one<eos> - with my creation. - Exactly.
- You've got to do it.<eos> It doesn't work... Not even a little bit.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, get a room!<eos> - Oh, I didn't order.<eos> - It's on the house.<eos> I went to high school with your mom.<eos> She was a beautiful person.<eos> Funny as hell.<eos> Generous.
And I deserve it.<eos> Police.<eos> On your knees, now.<eos> Get down and put your hands behind your head.<eos> You're under arrest for the abduction of Maya Gowen.<eos> Do not move.<eos> I'm not going to prison.<eos> - Shoot me.<eos> - That's not happening.<eos> Hey, man, you still with me here?
She's still a victim, a second time.<eos> We're trying this case, Benny.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good. Good.<eos> I've been eager to step back in the ring with the D.A.'s office.<eos> I wonder who I get to knock gloves with.<eos> Amanda. Did you know she was prosecuting this case?<eos> Amanda. What a surprise.<eos> I heard you were working with your brother-in-law.<eos> Ex-brother-in-law.
Under a Jane Doe, is that correct?<eos> AMANDA: Objection, relevance.<eos> Your Honor, the deceased is not on trial here.<eos> - I'll allow it. - GINA: Look,<eos> I was just mad at him, okay?<eos> And I dropped it, like, a week later.<eos> We were both under a lot of pressure, and things got heated, and that's all.<eos> So you, a self-described hothead, you were angry?<eos> (scoffs) Sure.<eos> - And under pressure.
BENNY: So, Ellen Huff was not interested in the truth.<eos> BENNY: She never asked.<eos> Just picked up Aaron and Claudia.<eos> Claudia read the Ledger's rape story and is convinced that Ellen did a poor job reporting the facts.<eos> I take it you hacked her computer, implanted your news story.<eos> It wasn't very secure.<eos> Okay, Amanda's next witness up is Rob McKellen.<eos> Fraternity brother and Mike's best friend.<eos> What's all this about pedicures?<eos> Chunk.
I don't have a wife.<eos> Everyone knows I'm gay.<eos> Ha! I knew you could hear me.<eos> - In your gay face!<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> I've, uh... I've been there.<eos> Junior year of high school I lost all the proofs for lit mag and we had to stay up all night relaying it out.<eos> Everybody hated me.<eos> Especially Becca Fish... such a Goody Two-shoes, but I killed them with a little thing called kindness, and guess who became the next editor-in-chief.<eos> Well, co-editor.
I'm General Grant's aide.<eos> You're Robert Todd Lincoln.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No.<eos> I... I admire your father.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Miss...<eos> Juliet Shakes... man.<eos> Are you an actress? No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Not a very good one.
It's gonna be a disaster for them, not to mention my great-great-grandparents.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm with him.<eos> Look, I understand, but we don't know the consequences. It's too risky.<eos> It's our job to protect history.<eos> Yeah, rich white guys' history.<eos> A lot of my history sucks.<eos> Look, I know it seems crazy, but maybe we can change things for the better.<eos> This is the Herndon House, where Booth meets with his conspirators.<eos> What conspirators?
Well, if it ain't Sergeant Denzel Washington.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Why would you be sneaking around the vice president's hotel with this?<eos> Hey, boys, look who I found.<eos> Listen to me, Nicholas.<eos> I just need to talk to his bodyguards.<eos> I'm not trying to hurt the vice president.<eos> I'm trying to save him.<eos> Oh, you are, huh?<eos> From what?
Is it strange that your bossing me around turns me on?<eos> You're a guy-- everything turns you on.<eos> Well, that's true.<eos> Help!<eos> He's hurt!<eos> He's hurt bad!<eos> Okay, slow down.<eos> - Who's hurt?<eos> - My husband.<eos> Under the overpass.
Longer they got Sebastian, more likely he ends up like Lieutenant Reid.<eos> I haven't finished wowing you yet.<eos> Program's cross-checking the locations for multiple stops.<eos> We might be able to find where they're keeping him.<eos> There's a reason why we don't have permanent partners at FBI.<eos> Helps objectivity, especially in situations like this.<eos> Yeah, well, I like having skin in the game.<eos> Means you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done.<eos> Like using FBI resources without permission.<eos> The geotracker?
Hail to the conquering hero!<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!<eos> Man, why you want to worry us like that?<eos> Getting all emotional.<eos> Guys, I... I-I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, if it weren't for you...<eos> Really? You're trying to give us credit?<eos> Yeah. Drop the humility angle.<eos> You were the badass out there today.<eos> "Badass"? Yes.
Why is there a ham?<eos> This cake makes no sense!<eos> Get up.<eos> You're making a fool of yourself.<eos> And that's coming from a guy who burnt his nuts on a hand dryer earlier.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Relax.<eos> This cake had no family, no friends, no dental records.<eos> I've done this before.<eos> With other cakes, of course.
But it's your lot.<eos> My lot.<eos> My name on the gates.<eos> I'd like to keep them open.<eos> I'm leaving, Pat.<eos> Meeting go all right, Monroe?<eos> Only if you like book burnings.<eos> Well, I wouldn't know about all that.<eos> I'm just the banker.<eos> Also an adult.

Well, I love my doctor.<eos> He's sexy.<eos> You ever read Dante?<eos> In high school, a hundred years ago.<eos> Well, then you should know.<eos> There's a special circle of hell reserved for drunkards, bad comics, and anyone dumb enough to date his boss' daughter.<eos> Monroe.<eos> If I weren't my father's daughter, would you go with me?<eos> I'd be the luckiest man there.<eos> Luckiest man there.
That would be nice.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> Sorry about Landon.<eos> I imagine he was just a bit overwhelmed.<eos> By day he seems so tame.<eos> You know his father was a carpenter.<eos> Tell me, how is it you see all these writers and producers every day and no one's ever asked you to come read for something?<eos> A face like yours makes me think I should fire the whole bunch.<eos> Well, they've asked.<eos> A few times.
We see this all the time.<eos> A couple moves in together and they try to keep some things a mystery.<eos> But there is no mystery about it.<eos> All women must poop.<eos> I-I don't think that's what it is.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Have you made a bowel movement since you two started cohabitating?<eos> Yes... like, that's crazy.<eos> Like, of course!<eos> Yes, tons!
Yes, I'd like to.<eos> What's your name?<eos> David.<eos> David what?<eos> Just David.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> I used to skate only on the weekends, and only with my family.<eos> Then one night we were having dinner and my daughter Kate, who was twelve at the time, says that that meal... was like being in a shark tank.<eos> That's what my wife and I had become:<eos> A shark tank.
Well, in that case, my good Archbishop Kurtwell, you don't have any news for me.<eos> No bomb. No scandal.<eos> A stack of love letters that were never mailed isn't news.<eos> It's strictly literature.<eos> Pack the bags, call the chauffeur.<eos> You no longer have a car.<eos> I put in a request to have it confiscated.<eos> The Cardinal Secretary of State accepted my request.<eos> We're going to take the train to the airport.<eos> On one condition.

Hey.<eos> I'm just curious what I can do better.<eos> I...<eos> Any pointers?<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> You do?<eos> You're hanging around me, no spikes.<eos> I'm your teacher, you know me, I'm harmless, and you're good with teachers, aren't you, Alex?<eos> But I don't play on that side of the pool.<eos> Not with my recruits.
If it weren't for Alex, thousands of people would have died.<eos> Is it hard, working side by side with the reminder of the mistakes that you made?<eos> It's probably easier than working with my father.<eos> Round three?<eos> What you said in class hit me.<eos> - I don't doubt it.<eos> - Cute.<eos> I knew throwing you at the bottom of the Murder Board would make you spin out.<eos> Do I belong here?<eos> In your mind?
Just a man who's come to ask you one simple question.<eos> Aye, well... better make it a good one 'cause it's gonna be your last.<eos> Is getting revenge against the Dark One worth all the time you've spent chasing it?<eos> I'll let you know after I've skinned myself a crocodile, but first... I'll just have to settle for you.<eos> Narwhale! Starboard bow!<eos> Don't move.<eos> Sea monster!<eos> Man the cannons!<eos> Bring her about!<eos> On the double!
My mistakes.<eos> Whatever happened to Agrabah... was all my fault.<eos> I don't even know where to start to fix it.<eos> You don't even know what happened.<eos> Maybe that's where you start.<eos> You can't fix a problem until you know what it is.<eos> I killed my father. What?<eos> You asked me why I care about keeping your family together.<eos> It's because I once had the chance of having my own.<eos> With your dad?
Vodka.<eos> Um, that was clam juice.<eos> Sure was.<eos> Pick up, hot... doll.<eos> The Sophie doll?<eos> Well, it's covered in hair so it'll pass as food around here.<eos> Just get rid of it.<eos> Sophie's constantly using it to criticize me, so I disconnected her app.<eos> I mean, how many times can she yell at me to wash my hands after going to the bathroom?<eos> Every time?
Oh, my God. I spend my life writing laws in a way nobody can figure out what they mean.<eos> I know every trick in the book.<eos> I invented some of them, but this... this is like the Picasso of legislation.<eos> I just have to tip my hat and cry.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Red Wheatus just called me.<eos> He did? Why?<eos> He wants to meet.<eos> Who is it?<eos> With-with who?

Get off me!<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - His desk.<eos> There!<eos> It's going for his ear!<eos> Watch-watch it!<eos> Watch it!<eos> I got him.<eos> There it goes!<eos> Under the couch!
- I'm trying to get at the truth!<eos> Now, if Senator Wheatus and Senator Pollack, who helped craft this legislation, would like to explain it to all of us, then I would be happy to listen.<eos> Those buildings are for important, secret use.<eos> "Secret" Why secret?<eos> Why not secret?<eos> I think, in light of Senator Healy's concerns, we should consider carving out the section concerning farm provisions.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - ‭Oh, my God.<eos> Don't worry, it was just a random mugging.<eos> With a knife?
Is that my chai tea?<eos> Do they make gluten-free muffins?<eos> Nell? Mm.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> What?<eos> Why you lookin' at me like that?<eos> Everything okay with, you know, with those?<eos> Really?<eos> I just almost broke a guy's arm who was coming at you with a knife.<eos> With my bare hands.
Why don't you go home and get a good night's sleep?<eos> I'll stay with her for a while.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Well, with Kensi gone, I need you on your game more than ever.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hon. I'll see you in the morning.<eos> I love you.<eos> Good night, Hetty.<eos> Good night, Martin.<eos> Easy with the "Martin""
You want to know my secret?<eos> I bought stock in Marvel.<eos> Hi, Bert.<eos> This is my friend, Penny.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, come on in.<eos> I'll gonna go turn on some rock music.<eos> That's a geology joke.<eos> Bert's a geologist.<eos> And a joker.
I'm gonna get some coffee.<eos> You want some? Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.<eos> No, you don't! But let's say you do.<eos> And don't say you do, because you don't!<eos> Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?<eos> With what?
You want some? Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.<eos> No, you don't! But let's say you do.<eos> And don't say you do, because you don't!<eos> Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?<eos> With what?<eos> Your problem.
Trust me, that guy has no friends.<eos> Well, now he has you.<eos> And, Murtaugh, remind him that the job is to stop a noise complaint, not cause one.<eos> Hey, you were asking me why I box.<eos> You tell me any other job you can make $50 million at the end of the night.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Am I a thug?<eos> No, I ain't no thug.<eos> I'm a specialist.<eos> A businessman.
And you are...<eos> Oh, that's Ned.<eos> He just texted me "9-9-9."<eos> He wouldn't use that code unless there was something wrong.<eos> Go. No...<eos> Go... Go ahead, honey.<eos> We have other nights. Okay.<eos> Yeah. We'll do this tomorrow.<eos> I'll get a chance to work on these notes.<eos> - My thoughts. - Okay.
This man's solid gold.<eos> You take care of him, you understand?<eos> You can count on it.<eos> Kiss of death.<eos> You know, normally I would say, uh, head to Mexico. North might be better for your situation.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I should have never let you talk me into this.<eos> Rog, come on, it was the only way.<eos> I mean, I love the man, but he stole 150 bricks of cold hard cash.<eos> 149.
I'm chillin'!<eos> What a trip!<eos> Yo, your mama used to make the best brownies...<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> Is your daddy still a, uh...<eos> A cop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You selling bootleg DVDs?<eos> I'm disappointed.<eos> Mainly in your collection.
Got something.<eos> That looks like him.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> Come on!<eos> Did an online search for "Black Hulk."<eos> That's how we do here in Robbery-Homicide.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Easy, kids.<eos> We're all cops here.<eos> Not seals or hobos.
Guess I don't know my own strength.<eos> These here are some lethal...<eos> I should've called you right after RJ called me.<eos> All right?<eos> So, I'm sorry.<eos> I am.<eos> I know you're the only guy around here who has my back and... I appreciate that.<eos> And I appreciate that.<eos> And you.<eos> Sometimes.
And you.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Occasionally.<eos> That's a great first step.<eos> Martin, is there something you could do to help nurture this relationship?<eos> This is not easy for one man to say to another but your head is wonderfully round.<eos> Bald is beautiful.<eos> Sometimes... at sunset... or when it's slightly dark out, your mustache almost looks not ridiculous.<eos> - Thank you. - Sometimes.<eos> Okay.
Maybe.<eos> That room was filled with celebrities, politicians, Mafia...<eos> Flynn could kill any of them, and it would be a disaster.<eos> Well, we need to get there first.<eos> ♪ Come on, fly with me ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, please head to the pool.<eos> The show is about to begin!<eos> ♪ In llama land, there's a one-man band ♪<eos> Ten. Nine.<eos> Eight.<eos> Seven.
So, I wanted to take a closer look at your wife's case.<eos> Well, I'm happy to hear there's some fresh eyes, but I'm not sure how I can help you.<eos> I've been over everything a hundred times with you guys.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I know. And I'm sorry about, uh, dropping by, you know.<eos> But I was on my way home.<eos> I live over near, uh, 35th.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Small world, you grow up here?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.
Dad, the Nightingale's next victim disappears nine days from now in '96.<eos> That's where we should be working.<eos> Come on, Raims, this guy, you know, he just lost his wife.<eos> I mean, he's raising his daughter alone.<eos> I mean, may... maybe it's a long shot, right?<eos> But maybe this helps us stop the Nightingale before he gets his next victim.<eos> This is it.<eos> You are a ham radio enthusiast.<eos> - I'm working a case.<eos> - With the other nerd cops.
And you want to keep these...<eos> That's weird.<eos> It's very very strange.<eos> Did my mom wear one?<eos> Probably, yeah.<eos> Were you her best friend?<eos> Something like that, yeah.<eos> She was a warrior queen.<eos> Yes, she was.<eos> Pretty much.
Exactly.<eos> It was gross.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't want to hear any more.<eos> I just want to focus on convincing the INS that your marriage is not a fraud.<eos> 'Cause the sooner you get your citizenship, sooner you get divorced, sooner we can tie the knot, and give a legit home to the genius bun in Happy's baby oven.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Huh? Huh? Our honeymoon album.<eos> It's...<eos> Tahiti!
I'm not trying to untie.<eos> Those guys had some dirt on their clothes and it's itching the hell out of me.<eos> Yeah, well, we got bigger problems than scratchy skin.<eos> They lured us here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They don't even know who we are.<eos> No, but they knew someone like us would come.<eos> It can't just be a coincidence that those criminals chose to infiltrate the museum the same night that we have to shut off the security system.<eos> They compromised the pillar.<eos> Probably with some corrosive.
I'm gonna have this garage green in no time.<eos> What you got there?<eos> It's a divorce gift for your baby.<eos> It's hideous and heavy.<eos> It's protective.<eos> Did you know that on aircraft, you're exposed to as much radiation as a chest X-ray?<eos> I'm a genius.<eos> I know most things.<eos> Well, what if you're on a plane with Tobias Merriweather Curtis Jr.?<eos> Merriweather?
Stop. Thank you.<eos> You believed I could be King before anyone else.<eos> Before even I did.<eos> It meant the world to me.<eos> It still does.<eos> Of course.<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> We should, but I can't right now.<eos> I have... something.<eos> - Another time?
Not even close.<eos> But there was a bear.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, I was out scouting, I got cornered, she charged me, and I pissed myself.<eos> Fired wild, and I fell into a creek.<eos> When I got myself up, I couldn't believe the shot took her down.<eos> I was scared outta my mind.<eos> Then what did you do?<eos> Well, I went back and told my men that I wrestled a bear.<eos> One-handed.
It was just an e-mail.<eos> Anyway, it got us a lead, didn't it?<eos> Yeah, and possibly Gregorio fired.<eos> I know how we all feel about Gregorio, but we gotta learn to work without her again, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Starting with figuring out how, exactly, Jared's connected to the bank robbery.<eos> Well, it may be what his father and girlfriend were hiding.<eos> I mean, Dana seemed really nervous.<eos> Let's have another chat with them.<eos> Only separately this time.
I dove into the specifics of how they manipulated that car crash.<eos> Whoever did it, they are good.<eos> I'm talking Mensa hacker level good.<eos> Yeah, but... it wasn't Jared.<eos> According to the marines, he was TDY on three of the four robberies.<eos> So he couldn't have been a part of the crew.<eos> Maybe he found out about it and tried to do the right thing and got killed before he could.<eos> Still doesn't explain why he got stabbed or why Dana was too scared to talk.<eos> Maybe we ought to take another run at the father now?<eos> This time with a warrant.
If it fails, you're Carter, and Congress will hold you accountable.<eos> As usual, Kimble, your support is overwhelming.<eos> Uh, just to be clear, you're saying if the mission fails, you'll withdraw your support entirely?<eos> Maybe deny you ever gave it in the first place, possibly start an investigation?<eos> So long as we're being communicative.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> I'll let you get back to your job.<eos> Coming, Peter?<eos> Sir. I just want to say...<eos> Godspeed.
Target is close.<eos> Stand by to engage.<eos> Move, move, move.<eos> Calm down! Calm down!<eos> We have eyes on Mad Hatter.<eos> That's Majid Nassar.<eos> So, what are you saying? MacLeish's survival was planned?<eos> This is not theory anymore, Jason. This is not a figment of my imagination.<eos> During the State of the Union address, the Capitol blew up and everyone died.<eos> Everyone except one man.
Roman said that Kantor was supposed to clone a microchip for them.<eos> He worked for Bradley Dynamics, which is one of those companies that has its hands in just about everything.<eos> His job title was never disclosed, but I'm pretty sure he worked in aeronautics.<eos> Yeah, interesting.<eos> That lines up with a few theories that I've been working on.<eos> Could you find out his focus area?<eos> Well, based on his PhD focus and previous employment,<eos> I'd say he was working on smart weapons, laser guidance, or missile and fire control.<eos> Or, all of those.<eos> Or something much, much worse.
Where you came from.<eos> Lake Aurora.<eos> That was... the beginning.<eos> And what we're about to do... will be the end.<eos> Get out!<eos> I just need a second.<eos> I'm not talking.<eos> I don't need you to talk, I need you to listen.<eos> I've got a job for you.<eos> Off the books.
An enemy attack on the town?<eos> How did I survive?<eos> She had you out walking every day as part of your rehabilitation.<eos> You were up in the mountains when the strike came.<eos> How did I get back here?<eos> You had to hide on your own for weeks.<eos> Eventually, you managed to stow away on a cargo ship.<eos> I don't remember any of that.<eos> What matters is you're home now.<eos> With your family.
Loyalty is a noble value, but you can't let it blind you, and when it counted, those people weren't there for you.<eos> They used you.<eos> Think I wanna spend my last days in court, testifying against my family?<eos> You walked away from them for a reason.<eos> You said you didn't want to die an O'Malley.<eos> You let them get away with this, that's going to be your legacy.<eos> And your daughter will never know you took a stand.<eos> I have tapes.<eos> What tapes?<eos> Hard evidence.
Not good for a traveling merchant to be so careless with his goods.<eos> Well, that explains it then.<eos> Wilby must've gotten the scent of it.<eos> My mother says he's a bloodhound in a sweater.<eos> Sorry it's a little battered.<eos> Oh, that's all right.<eos> Worth it to see such a fine animal like this.<eos> You are a fine little fella, aren't you?<eos> Made camp here last night so no brigands would find me.<eos> Brigands?
The Staples Center is downtown.<eos> We go to Clippers games all the time.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> I'm sorry, big guy.<eos> I'm just not up for the crowd.<eos> Now, I'm gonna have to side with Sam-Dawg on this one. We got a case, guys.<eos> You know, Sam, I'd be happy to roll with you.<eos> I just might take you up on that. Yeah?<eos> Are you a fan?<eos> Fan, no.

- and then...<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll give you another chance.<eos> But tell me what your theory is.<eos> Guo Zhida said that it will be his special plan.<eos> To him this is nothing but fun and games.<eos> He wants to show his brother that he won.<eos> To win?<eos> Against who?<eos> The police, all the gamblers and everyone.
That's it!<eos> It's a blueprint for gas pipes.<eos> Number seven from Team Ju Yuan is getting ready to kick the ball from 40 meters.<eos> That player is a very good striker.<eos> Li Zhiyu, the number 10 player, gets the pass and shoots.<eos> He shoots and scores with lightning speed.<eos> He shoots, and it's in!<eos> The score is 2-2.<eos> Li Zhiyu is a dangerous opponent for anyone.<eos> Amazing.
More than that.<eos> Make her face what she's done.<eos> Pay the price.<eos> Cold cell for the rest of her days.<eos> Better her than you.<eos> Nobody's gonna spend any time in a cold cell!<eos> There's a lot of bullets in this gun!<eos> No.<eos> Henry was my only friend!<eos> Only friend?
Eh, you should get some sleep.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounds like a plan.<eos> - Yeah. You right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I spoke to the funeral director this morning and asked for the seating to be arranged so that we can all be together in the front row.<eos> OK.<eos> Carmine and the rest of the staff will be off to the side, and that includes Billie.<eos> - So, with us but not with us?
In order to assure cooperation, the United Nations will oversee the resolution.<eos> As we move toward the conclusion of this crisis, the President reminded Khrushchev there is still a grand endeavor to undertake to soothe the fears of war between Russia and the United States.<eos> Until wider measures of disarmament can be agreed upon, the threat of nuclear conflict continues to live.<eos> Happy days are here again.<eos> That's right, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> The parking garage for the kempeitai building.<eos> I'd park the bomb right here.<eos> Number 5.<eos> In the middle of this building is their war room where the kempeitai and their military intelligence coordinate all their efforts against the Resistance.<eos> Directly above the garage.
You tell me if it vibes with you.<eos> - That's so gross.<eos> - Life moves forwards, not backwards, and things will never be as they were.<eos> And you can be angry about that, or you can embrace the fact that your best friend now has a son.<eos> How cool is that, amigo?<eos> - Ugh, "amigo."<eos> All right, fine, yes, I'll admit it, it is pretty cool.<eos> Boyle's wanted it for a very long time.<eos> I guess I haven't actually spent that much time with Nikolaj yet.<eos> - Nikolaj.
He's your husband's brother.<eos> That's gross.<eos> - Hey, Louise.<eos> - Ah, there she is.<eos> Hey, Schmidt, uh, Nick and I are gonna grab a cab into the city.<eos> Get one of our famous extravagant lunches.<eos> - Your what?<eos> - You know our thing.<eos> We're men of means. We like nice lunches.<eos> Men of means?
Because I'll do it. I was just telling my son how I've always dreamed of being a busker.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> You have just introduced yourself to the best buskers in the business.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, due to a signal problem at 51st Street all trains are currently delayed.<eos> Thank you for your patience.<eos> What do we do now, Winston?<eos> We are about to busk, baby.<eos> Okay, you're busking with the best!<eos> In the most unbelievable, I said inconceivable, unthinkable, unbelievable,<eos> - also unthinkable...
- but I got something.<eos> - Trust us.<eos> Sepulveda!<eos> La Cienega, bitches.<eos> El Matador beach.<eos> You're just naming places in Southern California.<eos> Nickel Canyon!<eos> What the...<eos> - Told you we were men of means.<eos> - Men of means!
Come on!<eos> Of course, Mr. Qian.<eos> Who's this fella?<eos> Pierre, come over here!<eos> This is my good friend Pierre.<eos> He is Mr. Qian.<eos> Nice to meet you, Mr. Qian.<eos> If you wanna do business with the Chinese, you'll have to learn some Mandarin, won't you?<eos> Mr. Qian, what does he do exactly?<eos> Gambling, man!
- So we're drinking now?<eos> - Well, with what you've been through, and what we're about to go through, - absolutely.<eos> - Amen to that.<eos> Cheers, chaps.<eos> It's, bad form to leave a poured glass full.<eos> Dude. James Bond just hit on Lucy.<eos> What?<eos> The purpose of a spy is to blend in.<eos> I'm the pilot.<eos> From Tuskegee.
We only have a minute.<eos> Raymond Reddington is here.<eos> He wants Mato.<eos> Tell me how to find Mato.<eos> No.<eos> He'll kill you if you don't.<eos> He'll kill Mato if I do.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you, Nikos.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> Loyal.
You two aren't going anywhere. Sit tight.<eos> That's it. We're clear.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> You sure you got the right one? Sample number 17.<eos> That was our deal.<eos> The rest is mine.<eos> Got to be kidding me.<eos> Johan, where the hell was that guy going? The guy with the case.<eos> Please do not tell me that you parted with the best samples.<eos> Just one.
Aram, uh, his perfect date... What would that be?<eos> Is that why you're calling me? For dating advice?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you're his best friend.<eos> And after nearly destroying his place today, I... want to give him a night he'll never forget.<eos> How would you do that?<eos> He admires Kirk, says he's a good man.<eos> He shouldn't.<eos> And he's not.<eos> I'm in the middle.<eos> Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk.
We have less than a minute.<eos> All right, I found the circuit board.<eos> - What do I do?<eos> - Agent Navabi.<eos> We're gonna kill the power to the fire system.<eos> Doing so will release a fire-suppression agent.<eos> It's an inert gas, so it's safe, but you might have a problem with...<eos> - Oh! Uh, the plug with two red wires just below the green blinking light, pull that... pull it now!<eos> A problem with what, Aram?<eos> Visibility.
We've lost communications with the Mandalorian base on Concord Dawn.<eos> Rebel leaders are concerned your Protectors are setting a trap for us.<eos> Impossible. My men are loyal to my word.<eos> Your safe passage through our system is secure.<eos> If you've lost communication, something's happened.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> I should go with you.<eos> They're my men. I can talk to them.<eos> Wait. Isn't he our prisoner?<eos> More like a cranky guest.
I beg to differ.<eos> * STAR WARES REBELS * Season 03 Episode 03 "The Antilles Extraction" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> Hey. We heard the supply run to Teralov failed.<eos> It gets worse.<eos> We lost the entire escort of A-wings.<eos> Six pilots and the transport's entire crew.<eos> How many is that this month?<eos> At this rate, there's not gonna be anyone left to fly for the Rebellion.<eos> Fortunately, I have been working on a solution with the help of Fulcrum.<eos> Ahsoka?
We'll take care of the Empire.<eos> Is she serious?<eos> (SCOFFS) My daughter is always serious. Ha.<eos> Runs in the family.<eos> Rebel transport incoming.<eos> Shoot it down!<eos> Hera, how did you plan on getting us onboard?<eos> I'm lowering the front ramp.<eos> Just jump on.<eos> With the blurrgs?
I accept your logic.<eos> We are on the same side. Sorry.<eos> I guess we are.<eos> However, as I stated, my forces are too depleted for me to plan a successful counterattack.<eos> Fighting insurmountable odds?<eos> We can help you with that. (AGITATED GRUNTING)<eos> Yes, Chopper, we know the Empire is here.<eos> How's the shuttle coming?<eos> Shuttle?<eos> What shuttle?
Okay. Thank you so much again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are investigating what happened to Yuri?<eos> I am.<eos> My name is Oluwa Tinabu.<eos> Yeah, right here, from, uh, Nigeria.<eos> I'm the guy who sent you those e-mails so you can get rich from frozen bank accounts in my country.<eos> So, you, uh, you work with Yuri?<eos> On what exactly?
- Yeah, he got the chop.<eos> Yeah. If you go looking, you'll find him under a different name.<eos> There was an under-age who went down with him.<eos> A Brett O'Donohue.<eos> They were the two I nailed. But the thugs who I believe were responsible said they weren't there.<eos> Well, sometimes you get what you can and call it a good day.<eos> - How old were you in '89?<eos> - Oh, primary school.<eos> Poofter-bashing was a sport back then.<eos> A blood sport.
This is a recorded interview for police records.<eos> Can you state your name for the camera?<eos> Yeah. Brett Roger Ian O'Donohue.<eos> Martin Adamski.<eos> We saw the guy walking down.<eos> Spoke to him.<eos> Told him I'd give him a blowie, so he came with me.<eos> The poof got his pants down around his ankles.<eos> He was heaps stiff and he grabbed my cock and Adamski came from behind him and smacked over the head.<eos> What with?
We recovered Toohey's phone.<eos> He made three calls last night, all of them to his lawyer, Simon Mawbrey.<eos> I called Mawbrey this morning.<eos> He's not picking up, called in sick.<eos> I think somebody should pay him a visit.<eos> - I'll do that.<eos> - All right, that's it.<eos> You two... just a word.<eos> - [DOOR CLOSES]<eos> With all due respect...
Well, if they're not our killers, then one of their clients is.<eos> Yeah, or someone who gets their ice from one of their clients, which could be about half of bloody Bondi.<eos> So, we're no closer to cracking this.<eos> Little steps, boss.<eos> We are making progress.<eos> Well, I need more than just busting the O'Donohues for a few bags of ice.<eos> - Cheers, Brenda.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Hey, mate.
- They have no idea.<eos> - Since then, her sister, Anezka, had paralyzed her and taken her place.<eos> No boys, sweetheart.<eos> You need to stay focused.<eos> But she couldn't because she fell in love with Scott, the manager of the Marbella Lounge.<eos> And Rafael's sister, Luisa, had a change of heart and said goodbye to her great love, Rose.<eos> Otherwise known as the crime lord Sin Rostro.<eos> - And Derek?<eos> - He's dead. He was on her list.<eos> - Along with your mom.
And... maybe they won't be our last dinner guests.<eos> I mean, I've been thinking. If we cut *** here and there, maybe we can stay.<eos> That's your filing system?<eos> Well, this and the other box, yeah.<eos> First things first.<eos> Fixed expenses:<eos> - rent, food, gas, internet.<eos> - My student loans.<eos> I thought you paid it off.<eos> One.
- I'll be right there.<eos> - What?<eos> I'll call you from outside the house.<eos> - You're scaring me. - I don't know how else to make you take this seriously.<eos> Okay, so then, maybe I should go wake up Nicky.<eos> You can wake her up in a minute.<eos> Just listen to me now, okay?<eos> You have to pack enough to last you both a while, then just get on the road.<eos> Don't tell people where you're going, all right?<eos> Not even Neil.
He told me he had no problem taking a polygraph exam and that I could search his vehicle if I wanted.<eos> - In Mexico and Tijuana.<eos> - So what, man?<eos> Prostitution's legal down there, right?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah. - How often you go?<eos> Um, once a week. Sometimes more.<eos> Yeah. I've been down there a couple times.<eos> I like that race track at Agua Caliente.<eos> You know that place?<eos> Yeah. With off-track betting.
I've seen photographs of you two together and all your "Super Friends."<eos> You still meet up, huh?<eos> Still talk?<eos> The occasional dinner party, group text, karaoke Thursdays?<eos> What about that southern she...<eos> Shh! Shh! Quiet.<eos> And that agent who helped build the bomb...<eos> The cute one, the one who didn't die.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Will Olsen?
And since this is real, say hello to your get out of jail free pass.<eos> This is an endorsement card.<eos> Should you run afoul of local law enforcement, given your illegal activity, you can use it to have your slate wiped clean.<eos> However, if any of you do so, don't bother coming back.<eos> I'll consider that your resignation.<eos> Come on up, get your data packs.<eos> Background on Crawford, floor plans of the club, and your very own cover story.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Another threesome?<eos> How about it?<eos> But this time sober?
I know what you mean.<eos> Maybe that's why this was never meant to be a two-person mission.<eos> Do you think we'd do better if it was just one of us here?<eos> Do you?<eos> Uno... dos...<eos> You?<eos> I'm... I'm sorry. I have to get...<eos> Wait. I'm sorry.<eos> It's just I'm... I'm hiding from someone.<eos> Who?
I'm... I'm sorry. I have to get...<eos> Wait. I'm sorry.<eos> It's just I'm... I'm hiding from someone.<eos> Who?<eos> Well, I can't tell you that.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm a member.<eos> Really?<eos> So am I.<eos> Or... prospective.
Are you an actress?<eos> Have you done any, SM?<eos> Roleplay?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, I just want to go home.<eos> Aw. Don't be sorry.<eos> You're exactly what I asked Julian for.<eos> How you doing, buddy?<eos> We're here to see<eos> Henry Ashworth.
Look at us, showing up without an invitation.<eos> You didn't get invited?<eos> I got invited.<eos> So, can I be your plus one?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You leave now, or I'll be forced to have to call...<eos> - Say it. Please say it.<eos> - Please say it.<eos> The police.<eos> Hello!
Well... damn near normal.<eos> Hey, keep an eye out later, just in case you start to, you know, crave blood.<eos> Funny.<eos> If you do start to turn, I will drive a stake through your heart personally, because we're pals.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Actually, all three.<eos> I spoke to Bryce.<eos> He's okay, too.<eos> The bats, too.
Cool. 'Cause she says you're doing a great job as "weird friend who doesn't have to be at every appointment."<eos> I'm the son of a gynecologist. I could be helpful.<eos> It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.<eos> The polite response is, "Thank you for noticing."<eos> Let me see the sonogram again.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking baby for a little gray blob.<eos> Yeah, we could name him Blobert.<eos> What if it's a girl?<eos> Bloberta.<eos> Or Blobbi with an "I."
I suppose that works.<eos> Great.<eos> Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows,<eos> Raj knows, his Grey's Anatomy online fan group probably knows.<eos> Is it weird we don't?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the surprise will make it more fun.<eos> Like magic tricks.
That punk had problems with everyone in the school.<eos> How many had problems with him?<eos> What, you're looking for a list or something?<eos> His death wasn't accidental.<eos> He was poisoned.<eos> Well, then you got your work cut out for you.<eos> Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> Abbs, McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.<eos> Yeah. Behind your back.
I don't believe you.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> You were the only one not at the reunion.<eos> You were the only one that had the opportunity to poison Bruno.<eos> Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us.<eos> This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school.<eos> Ah.<eos> Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player.<eos> You?<eos> Painter.
Prosecutor's gonna file charges today, unless you have something to tell us.<eos> This isn't where I imagined I'd be after high school.<eos> Ah.<eos> Welcome to the club. I wanted to be a pro football player.<eos> You?<eos> Painter.<eos> Really.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. Really.<eos> Painter.
Trust me, it's the best way to deal with him.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, do you guys have a cocktail menu?<eos> Menu?<eos> I mean, yeah, we...<eos> We got all that stuff.<eos> Told you this place was a real dive.<eos> Totally authentic.<eos> We'll take two martinis.<eos> Dive?
I got an update on the drug OD from the party.<eos> Yeah, how's she doing?<eos> She's okay now.<eos> Going home tomorrow. - Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> - Yeah. But who brought her in?<eos> Why?<eos> Maggie says she was left on a bench out front.<eos> If Halstead hadn't found her...<eos> - Outside of the hospital?
- God. God. - Easy, take it easy.<eos> Gary said to stack the drums high enough to hide the tanks.<eos> I'm guessing he doesn't have a permit to store sulfuric acid.<eos> The guy never met a corner he couldn't cut.<eos> He's making cash on the side storing the tanks for a friend.<eos> And you brought me here?<eos> What was I supposed to do, leave you at home alone?<eos> Guys, what's on the other side of this vent?<eos> - Office.<eos> - With a landline?
Nick, if this is about notes, so help me God.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna stop bugging you until you note me, Schmidt.<eos> All right, Nick. Here's a note.<eos> Stop cutting yourself off at the knees like a selfish coward.<eos> Okay, great, great.<eos> I love the direction we're going.<eos> We're getting more critical, but can you refocus to the writing?<eos> No, Nick, I cannot, and you want to know why?<eos> Because you are a writer.<eos> And a damn good one at that.
We're back in Britain.<eos> We're actually in Yorkshire, which is...<eos> There you go.<eos> Which is where all three of us grew up.<eos> - Specifically-- Yeah, specifically...<eos> Whitby!<eos> We're in the fishing port of Whitby.<eos> There it is.<eos> Now, Whitby, of course, is famous all around the world for its unbelievable fish and chips.<eos> - With scraps.
-But it's...<eos> -It's coal, isn't it?<eos> Unlike other gemstones, Hammond, it's a lot cheaper.<eos> Well, yes, it would be.<eos> Well, seriously, you can get a jet ring, look, for 32 quid.<eos> You get a sack of it for ten quid.<eos> It's coal!<eos> Thing is, though... We were thinking the other day, you know carmakers now they use bamboo, ash, walnut and carbon fibre to decorate bits of a car?<eos> -Why don't they use jet?<eos> -Exactly.
Yes, it's time for a top celebrity to try their hand at our fearsome test of skill, co-ordination and observation.<eos> Now, so far, I should explain, no celebrity has actually made it to the tent.<eos> No, they've all died.<eos> Yes, but our fingers are crossed for this week, because our guest is a huge star.<eos> You'll have seen him in Mission Impossible,<eos> Star Trek, Shaun Of The Dead,Hot Fuzz, and he's here to talk about his new movie - Spielberg movie - Ready Player One .<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Simon Pegg!<eos> And there he is.<eos> There he is, ladies and gentlemen, with his Cornetto.<eos> Always a Cornetto.
Oh, God!<eos> It's twitchy, it's unpredictable.<eos> And in the rain, it's somewhere between spiteful and undrive...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> ...undriveable.<eos> But, that said, this has to be the winner of this test because Richard Hammond has got one of those.<eos> I called it.<eos> That was annoying.<eos> That was a professional review.<eos> At points.
Crossing the road is now an opportunity for you to express your sexuality.<eos> It is.<eos> That's why they've come up with these traffic lights in London.<eos> What are they for?<eos> No, they really have.<eos> They really have.<eos> - They're real?<eos> - They are for real.<eos> What's that one on the right, then?<eos> Hello!
No.<eos> Heavily pedestrianised areas should be avoided.<eos> -Right, come on. We've just got two miles to go.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> The smell!<eos> -What's that?<eos> -It breaks my heart, but it's a small gift for you.<eos> -Is it?<eos> Mate!
-A bit more conversation for you.<eos> -Oh, good!<eos> I think, with the exception of Rolls-Royce,<eos> Volvo now make the best car interiors of anybody.<eos> They do.<eos> They're very, very good.<eos> I don't like to, but I agree with you.<eos> because I went in the new S90 the other day, and the interior is superb.<eos> -We've got a picture of it here.<eos> -Yes, that one.
Sometimes, if you listen very carefully, you can hear my genius.<eos> Back as a threesome, we continued with our seemingly endless journey to the east.<eos> Just need to find a road now.<eos> This is not funny any more.<eos> Enough desert.<eos> I don't want another night in the desert.<eos> I smell pretty bad.<eos> And I suspect that if we manage to find somewhere tonight near civilisation, we should probably have a ceremonial bonfire of the underpants.<eos> In truth, though, I thought we'd be in the desert forever.<eos> But then, late in the afternoon...
Eleven.<eos> But better land, by the forest.<eos> Two pigs and a cow.<eos> A horse.<eos> But we have to rush with the wedding,<eos> The harvest gets near and people talk about the war.<eos> Swear.<eos> That you'll always love me.<eos> I swear.<eos> To God.
And what?<eos> Young.<eos> Much younger then you, Corporal.<eos> Why would I need an old one?<eos> I was drafted right after the wedding.<eos> So you didn't have a chance to dip, sir.<eos> You snot.<eos> I did.<eos> And I'll get back to them, as I have children from my first marriage.<eos> Godspeed.
- God willing...<eos> Antoni.<eos> Wilk.<eos> His eyes are open.<eos> Who are you, mister?<eos> He doesn't look Jewish, but you need...<eos> It's my house and I'll do what I want.<eos> Got you!<eos> Here.<eos> Not with the tip but flat.
First Soviets deported men to Siberia, then Germans to work in Germany.<eos> All I know is that Ukrainians in our village said they'll warn us. We get along well.<eos> Do you have vodka?<eos> In 20 years the Ukrainian Military Organization and later OUN carried out 1000 attacks.<eos> Arsons, assaults, killings.<eos> They were killing not only Poles, but Ukrainians who wanted to negotiate with Poland too.<eos> My shoes are too tight.<eos> Go back and await orders I'll report about the Jews.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Godspeed.
The world is infected with unrestrained devotion to one's fatherland, one's nation, and the measure of such devotion<eos> is the strength of hatred towards other nations.<eos> Captain Zygmunt Krzemieniecki.<eos> It's me.<eos> I am the emissary.<eos> Polish Government in London has agreed with OUN that both sides arrive to the negotiations unarmed.<eos> I've read your poems.<eos> The one about two fatherlands very good.<eos> With whom do I have the honor?<eos> With the free Ukraine!
Banderists!<eos> The Holy Scripture tells us:<eos> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.<eos> The owner's servants came to him and said:<eos> 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field?<eos> Where then did the weeds come from? '<eos> 'An enemy did this,' he replied.<eos> Let us not delude ourselves, that there is a single nation free of this poison. And therefore let every member of every nation feel himself at home in his faith.<eos> And let being the member of a particular faith be not connected with hurting, evil thoughts<eos> or wrong doing.
Martial law has been declared on Mykapo, but a small pocket of resistance continues to be troublesome.<eos> Mykapo has no armed militia or starfighter corps.<eos> What resistance is there to be so troublesome?<eos> One ship calling themselves the Iron Squadron recently attacked an advance patrol with the aid of this rebel vessel.<eos> Oh, the Ghost.<eos> They're likely evacuating the treasonous inhabitants before we can arrest them.<eos> As for this Iron Squadron, very curious.<eos> Admiral Konstantine, go to Mykapo and lock down the system.<eos> I will deploy a squadron of ships.<eos> No, Admiral.
I know that you like one of your partners and you hate the other one.<eos> I know that you're gonna redesign your office furniture and that you might fire your assistant - because she says "like" too much.<eos> - It's nonstop.<eos> Can I talk to you in depth about weather patterns?<eos> No, I cannot.<eos> But I don't think you'd want me to if I could, so...<eos> Hey, what's-what's this really about?<eos> Maybe I was meant to be a musician.<eos> I'm sorry, what now?<eos> Or an artist or a writer.
I thought Daddy couldn't play the piano?<eos> Daddy cannot.<eos> Wait, hold on one second.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Sweet Jesus.<eos> One second, please.<eos> Come on everybody.<eos> There you are.<eos> I was with Grace. Who?<eos> Grace.
EOD's a small world; we worked a couple missions together.<eos> Spent two weeks in Kabul dismantling IEDs.<eos> 127, to be specific.<eos> It was a company record.<eos> Anyways, he's one of the best bomb techs I've ever worked with.<eos> Last I heard, he was doing bomb analytics for the FBI at Quantico.<eos> Still is.<eos> I get a call from the deputy director.<eos> Said Agent Robinson needs to see you.<eos> Only you.
Yeah, several hours the night before.<eos> So many fractures, so much damage.<eos> I'm sure the only reason Sergeant Hill survived as long as she did is 'cause she's in such good physical shape.<eos> You know, when I was digitizing the old NIS files, I came across a case where a Marine drill instructor fell six stories and survived. He...<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Ah, Jethro.<eos> Aren't you gonna ask me, "What you got, Duck""<eos> Nope, you haven't even opened her up yet.<eos> Duck, you still on good terms with your M.E. friend?<eos> Tom Hubbard?
What kind of person does that?<eos> I will - - I will tell you what kind of person.<eos> Someone who believes in a civilized society, who believes that the future of our country depends on the lessons that we teach our children.<eos> "What kind of person," sir?<eos> A hero.<eos> I didn't do it!<eos> Oh, come on. We heard you laughing!<eos> 'Cause the blonde lady with an Axe in her head threw an egg at you.<eos> - Blonde lady?<eos> - Axe?
- Copy that. Man:<eos> Tonight, an exclusive interview with Alan Wells, brother of Sarah Keaton, whose husband Oscar has been arrested for her murder.<eos> The court has denied bail, so Mr. Keaton will remain in jail until his trail.<eos> Alan, let's get right to it...<eos> What do you want our viewers to know about your sister?<eos> Sarah had the kindest heart, always saw the best in people.<eos> Sounds like you two were close.<eos> We were, but... more recently we drifted apart.<eos> Sarah knew I was no fan of her husband.<eos> Oscar Keaton.
I'm an idiot.<eos> It's hard to pick just one thing.<eos> From the looks of that kiss, she's all in.<eos> Don't screw it up.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Cool. 100%.<eos> I'm staving. You want to get something to eat?<eos> - Where's Julia?<eos> - Already in the control room.
But I promise you this... I am damn sure gonna find out.<eos> Hey, Julia, it's me. Happy birthday.<eos> It's not my birthday.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> It's not even December.<eos> Suppose I were to combine the gifts of every gift-giving holiday into one spectacular mega-gift? Don't tell me.<eos> Another client paid you with a racehorse? Even better.<eos> Picture this...<eos> Tomorrow, LHL, an exclusive.<eos> With who?

If you run a story about me, I'll take a copy of that photo to one of your competitors.<eos> You're hacking into his home computer?<eos> You're committing a crime.<eos> How else am I supposed to help my boss?<eos> That's SweetVicki.<eos> You found her?<eos> You've been texting with Levi Young.<eos> He was pretending to be SweetVicki.<eos> Tomorrow, LHL, an exclusive.<eos> With who?
That's how it works.<eos> The freshmen take their licks, and then they find their own way home.<eos> They did it to me, they did it to him.<eos> It's a tradition.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> We've been taking your calls tonight on LHL.<eos> Once again, our guest is Coach Phil Ryder, the man who insists he's telling it like it is.<eos> Lenny, from Amarillo, you're on.<eos> Coach, I was at that game against Cleveland in '94 when you had three touchdowns.<eos> Unbelievable.
No, you don't.<eos> You said yourself, this is your destiny, not mine.<eos> Your mistakes are yours...<eos> And so are your successes.<eos> So, are you going to England?<eos> That is the plan.<eos> And who will sail with you?<eos> Somehow I will work it out.<eos> There is one thing I need your help with.<eos> What?
So you are asking me to take him up for a laparoscopy...<eos> Possibly an open laparotomy...<eos> On what, your hunch?<eos> Okay, look, he was in A-fib when he came in.<eos> Made me think right off, a clot had embolized to the gut.<eos> Now his bowel sounds are gone and he's distended.<eos> The differential for what you're describing is a mile long... gastroenteritus to inflammatory bowel disease.<eos> This man's bowel is dying.<eos> I felt it with my hands.<eos> Your hands? Yes.
We... we usually see human trafficking victims who've been branded or tattooed, but not this.<eos> How old is he?<eos> We don't have consent to get any more specific.<eos> Sure.<eos> You want to help this boy get out of the life.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Traffickers control their victims in a number of ways...<eos> Psychologically through fear and emotional abuse...<eos> And physically.<eos> Drugs.

How are you today?<eos> Fit as a fiddle.<eos> Mom said we're going to take a train.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I love trains.<eos> You know, Dr. Rowan, you were my teacher.<eos> Was I?<eos> That's right.<eos> You were a surgeon.<eos> The best.
Who's this little one?<eos> - So cute. - Oh.<eos> This is, uh, Tucker.<eos> Christopher's son.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, so, we go in.<eos> You got my back, right?<eos> No.
She's a key consultant for the FBI.<eos> Yes.<eos> And she's my daughter.<eos> Yes?<eos> We lost the asset.<eos> Single shot. Fatal.<eos> It appears as if the shooter gave us the slip.<eos> Thank you, Harold.<eos> Le Bron is dead.<eos> Right on schedule.
God, I feel so stupid. No.<eos> No.<eos> Don't.<eos> I don't want you to feel stupid.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I-I-I should have told you about, um... not Samar.<eos> I don't want you to feel really...<eos> What?<eos> Do you have any reason to believe our tap has been compromised?<eos> One minute.
Wh... for how long?<eos> Indefinitely.<eos> Well... not indefinitely.<eos> More like... eight months and seven days.<eos> You're gonna let an escaped cri cnal live in your basement?<eos> It's perfect.<eos> There are no windows, there's loads of space, and we'll still get to hang out.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna help out with utilities and stuff.<eos> Some of the utilities and stuff.<eos> Gas, maybe the trash.
No, I'm the Beyoncé.<eos> I am Beyoncé.<eos> But the point I'm trying to make is we're one man down.<eos> Look, I know it'll be different.<eos> But it's not the end.<eos> Really?<eos> So maybe the three of us can get together - and we can do a game night next week.<eos> - Yeah, I'd love that.<eos> - And then we can all do dinner and a movie.<eos> - Okay, one step at a time.
- Not by choice.<eos> - Oh, what happened?<eos> She didn't fight hard enough to get in the O.R.<eos> - or study or prepare.<eos> - Yes, she did.<eos> She drilled through a patient's leg all the way down to the table. - Yikes.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - That was an accident.<eos> - Did I also mention she almost brought the hospital down with harassment lawsuits and complaints against attendings because she was sleeping with attendings?<eos> Well, in fairness, I slept with an attending.<eos> Attendings.
And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.<eos> But this is it?<eos> I met you so you can tell me that our baby has to die and then go crawl off somewhere and die myself.<eos> These are my options?<eos> Just death?<eos> And more death?<eos> - What about a Whipple?<eos> - A Whipple?<eos> A what?

I know you faltered.<eos> But I want you all to know the target that was killed was guilty.<eos> There was no doubt.<eos> Then why tell us you weren't sure?<eos> It's easy to live with a righteous kill.<eos> But making that same decision with uncertainty is what makes you worthy of the CIA.<eos> We killed a man today.<eos> - Yeah, a man who deserved it.<eos> - That was this time.<eos> - But next time?
- I'd appre...<eos> - You need to drop this!<eos> - For your own good.<eos> - I don't need protecting.<eos> I need answers.<eos> And if it happened another way, I want justice.<eos> You think just because you teach everyone what to do you'd survive a day out there?<eos> What's your cover?<eos> A tenured professor?<eos> A widowed judge?
Follow me if you want to live.<eos> Do what he said.<eos> Neither rain nor sleet nor zombie hordes.<eos> You've only got a minute before they find you again.<eos> Now, what do you want?<eos> We're not bandits.<eos> Just some weary travelers, man.<eos> Looking for fuel and water.<eos> I might be able to help you.<eos> On one condition.
What do you plan on doing with this child?<eos> I shall be back at sundown. Don't think about trying to hide it.<eos> I'll find out.<eos> Goldman's "Treatise on the Metaphysics of Magic."<eos> Talbot's "The White Sorcerer's Way."<eos> What's this?<eos> Hildrew's "Manual on Defeating the Dark One."<eos> Huh. I've never seen you before.<eos> "Follow the strand."<eos> The strand of what?
And you?<eos> You're nothing more than one of my pawns.<eos> Good luck finding your son.<eos> Again.<eos> I hear fairies make wonderful mothers.<eos> Good news.<eos> Regina called.<eos> She reversed the spell.<eos> That sister is gonna live a long and hopefully far less eventful life.<eos> And what about Belle?
What are you up to?<eos> Apparently, I haven't opened a company bank account.<eos> - Have you? - Yeah, of course.<eos> Do you want some company, grab a drink, maybe six?<eos> You know, you've got a lovely smile.<eos> You don't do it enough.<eos> Are you flirting with me? Wh...<eos> Well, if you have to check, I'm obviously not doing it right.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry. I just thought that you were...<eos> British?
The liver's only been out for 20 minutes. The shunt will bypass everything for at least another hour.<eos> And then what?<eos> We still have no donor.<eos> Not to mention, Carl probably has I.T.P.<eos> And how was I supposed to know that?<eos> Edwards didn't have a problem figuring it out.<eos> Can Edwards not be involved?<eos> Every step of the way you and Webber just took over.<eos> Grey, what is your problem? My problem?<eos> [Indistinct voices]
So am I.<eos> I probably shouldn't eat, either.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?<eos> I was thinking miniature golf.<eos> Last time, I was like, 20 under going into the 18th, but that little windmill owns my ass.<eos> I can't.<eos> Steelers.<eos> Sunday Night Football.<eos> With who?

Just me.
You know? And even though it's not very big, the painting, you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction. So, like, to infinity, you know?<eos> 'Cause that's kind of like life, right?<eos> And it's really crazy, if you think about it, isn't it, that, a hundred years ago, some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase.<eos> He has a son, who has a son, who has me.<eos> So, at first, when I was painting, I was thinking, you know, maybe up here, that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know, down here, that's my part of the painting.<eos> And then I started to think, well, what if... we're all in the painting, everywhere?<eos> And-and what if we're in the painting before we're born? What if we're in it after we die?<eos> And these colors that we keep adding, what if they just keep getting added on top of one another, until eventually we're not even different colors anymore?<eos> We're just... one thing.<eos> One painting.
Why you watching this stuff?<eos> Told them to go screw themselves.<eos> I'm moving to New York.<eos> "Show business."<eos> Grandma and Grandpa are here!<eos> I'll be in mroom.<eos> This is the scariest part.<eos> Some people think the scariest part is coming to the hospital to have the baby. Nah.<eos> The scariest part is leaving the hospital with the baby.<eos> Babies.
When were you planning to tell me?<eos> What, that I'm a half-Pakistani agnostic cultural Muslim who never practices and sometimes donates money to his mom's mosque?<eos> Pretty sure you knew most of that.<eos> Hey, the minute you found out this guy was affiliated with your congregation, you sh...<eos> I don't have a congregation, I have friends and family who I was worried sick about after a maniac bombed our hometown.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you still should've told me.<eos> Should I disclose the money I gave my dad's Catholic church, too?<eos> If a member of its congregation sets off a bomb in the United States, you bet.<eos> Next time.
That name isn't familiar.<eos> He's a top advisor to the Saudi Minister of Education.<eos> High in the government of our most important oil provider, arms customer, and ally in the Gulf.<eos> Technically, Amjad is not a member of the government, but the minister does not make a move without him.<eos> Apart from his nationality, which makes Majeed Amjad untouchable, the fact that his cousin is the foreign minister makes him uranium.<eos> How solid it this information?<eos> You could chip a tooth on it.<eos> Last year, the Saudi government skirted its connection to the dirty bomb.<eos> I'm not letting this one slide.<eos> Not this time.
Her cover is... well, she's your sister.<eos> You don't have to lie about that.<eos> You're very lucky to have Dr. McCord in your corner.<eos> That was incredible, ma'am.<eos> I had a hard time concentrating on solar grids after watching Minister Hajar react to Victoria Butler.<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> Engage phase two.<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> Let's get set up for the secretary's next meeting.<eos> W-With George Clooney.
Have faith. I'm not sure it's in the cards...<eos> Five of Wands.<eos> Are you feeling conflicted about something?<eos> Yeah. Xavier.<eos> Tyra just tossed his research, and I... I didn't tell him.<eos> I didn't want to burst his bubble.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I don't even know if his theory's based in reality or nuts, but Mom... listening to him talk about it... he sounded smart.<eos> And insightful.<eos> And passionate.
I don't have a business partner.<eos> But you just said you had a partner.<eos> Did you mean "pardner"? You a cowboy?<eos> No, Tandy.<eos> I'm gay.<eos> You were gay.<eos> Am gay.<eos> Currently.<eos> Current.<eos> Gay.
Current.<eos> Gay.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Guys, are you hearing this? - Yeah.<eos> Yep, yep. Mm-hmm.<eos> - We did.<eos> - He's gay. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I mean, we have a gay population!<eos> You know, I was pumped when you were just Asian.<eos> But a gay Asian?
Seaman, where the hell is your brother?<eos> Ma'am? You sponsored two Tigers-- mother and brother.<eos> Where is Stewart?<eos> He called just before we left port to say he had car trouble.<eos> I gave him hell, but...<eos> Ma'am, he never boarded the ship.<eos> Someone signed in.<eos> Which means we have another problem.<eos> Yeah.<eos> An imposter.
So how do I convince my shipmates that I had nothing to do with this?<eos> You leave that to us.<eos> We have search crews all over the ship.<eos> You just keep doing what you're doing.<eos> My job?<eos> Yes.<eos> Closet safe.<eos> Uh, that's predictable.<eos> - Bank box?<eos> - Impersonal.
You leave that to us.<eos> We have search crews all over the ship.<eos> You just keep doing what you're doing.<eos> My job?<eos> Yes.<eos> Closet safe.<eos> Uh, that's predictable.<eos> - Bank box?<eos> - Impersonal.<eos> Under the mattress.
- I'm really sorry.<eos> If I had known that someone was actually dead...<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> Unless you have reason to implicate my client, we're done.<eos> You'll be the first to know.<eos> Big fan.<eos> I like your jacket.<eos> You get more than fashion tips?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Claustrophobia.
This is a secure federal building, swarming with vetted agents.<eos> What better way to keep it secret?<eos> To keep it safe. Hmm?<eos> No, no, no, you can't keep the ring in here.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> It will be out of sight, out of mind.<eos> Out of mind?<eos> I've broken into this desk a million times before; that's not safe.<eos> With Kate and Ziva before, obviously.<eos> Not with you.
I have the real plaque!<eos> Unh, unh! Gina!<eos> Of course!<eos> It all makes sense, except for the parts I don't understand and the fact that I still kind of think Terry did this.<eos> Nope, it was all me.<eos> Three weeks ago, Captain Holt asked me to order a plaque that read,<eos> "The Ultimate Detective/Genius."<eos> I did it, and I ordered three copies and a statue of Tyrese riding a dolphin.<eos> - Is that relevant?<eos> - To my life, yes.
Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight - for me. And...<eos> - and I did. I lost some of the weight.<eos> And if I gain it back, I will lose it again. All right?<eos> You are not alone in this.<eos> When we are together, I will eat the way that you eat.<eos> I swear. I swear on this bag of Cool Ranch... which is... way more disgusting than I remembered, by the way.<eos> I just don't know how this is gonna work.<eos> Then I'll show you.<eos> All right? Tonight.
So, many, many years ago, there was a Greek king who ruled over all of Israel.<eos> And this king said,<eos> "You have to pray to the Greek gods, or you're gonna be in so much trouble."<eos> And the Jews were like, "Yeah, I don't think so."<eos> And there was this one man named Mattathias who had five sons and probably some daughters, too-- but we may never know, because welcome to history-- and one son named<eos> Judah Maccabee, who gathered all of these fighters, and he called them The Maccabees because he got to name them.<eos> And they went against the king to get back the temple, even though the Greek soldiers came in on giant elephants, and I would have been like,<eos> "An elephant," and then just given up right then, but they didn't.<eos> The Jews rode strong until the Greeks left Jerusalem.<eos> Yay, right?
- Hey, Cece.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I want to get you something great, but I can't find anything on the Internet.<eos> Here's the truth. I'd give you my heart.<eos> I'd rip it out of my chest but... but then I would literally die.<eos> But you know that, you're studying to be a nurse.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> - You're already a nurse?<eos> - Not a nurse.
These aren't my words, Jess.<eos> I'm just repeating what I'm hearing.<eos> "Jess is the worst."<eos> - Okay. - "Can't stand the sight of her."<eos> - Don't need all of it.<eos> - Do you understand what I am saying?<eos> - They've asked me to move on with my search.<eos> - Wait a minute. - Huh?<eos> Would you talk me up to Ed if I could tell you where he was having dinner?<eos> With James Wonder?
Like, a ton.<eos> A ton of meat.<eos> I mean, I didn't realize you were so amenable.<eos> Hey, actually,<eos> Samanthia loves puppets.<eos> What would you say if I asked you to introduce ventriloquism into the curriculum? And do less math?<eos> I'd say... You got it!<eos> Great.<eos> "Sincerely"?<eos> "Sincerely"?
What're you doing?<eos> Look, I wanted you to know that Donna and I, we have talked... And... We would be very happy if you stayed with us for the rest of the school year.<eos> That's... that's great. Yeah.<eos> Um, what about Mom?<eos> She'll come around.<eos> But this house, it has rules, and one of those rules is, we speak honestly with each other.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> Good.<eos> So... What's going on with the bruises, James?<eos> - The bru... the bruises?
I did the math.<eos> There's no way I'm telling Gabby that one.<eos> Good choice.<eos> I don't even... my old man's on wife number... I lost track.<eos> Forty years...<eos> That's a good run.<eos> You ever gonna settle down, Kelly?<eos> Married to the job.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Chief.
- Firefighters? - That's right.<eos> You guys come here a lot?<eos> Yeah, it's a firefighter bar.<eos> It's dead.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you're a firefighter too?<eos> I am, yeah.<eos> So, you want to get out of here with us?<eos> Find something more fun.<eos> Maybe another time.
I can't see.<eos> I can't see! Spider, you have to help...<eos> Bean bag!<eos> A spider with a top hat?<eos> How is that gonna help?<eos> Marco!<eos> Bro, remember what I told you.<eos> You have the hat of a warrior.<eos> Uh, I'm Spider with a top hat.<eos> And a laser Cannon.
What?<eos> That's great news!<eos> Ho'omaika'i 'Ana, Max.<eos> Mahalo.<eos> I want to hear all about it. Right now we got work to do.<eos> Body's this way.<eos> And before she retired, she made a name for herself as a TV medium. Of course.<eos> I remember all the late-night ads for her psychic hotline.<eos> I guess it makes sense that someone like her would choose to live in a house with this kind of a history?<eos> What history?
The chief is a woman.<eos> Don't look so surprised.<eos> - You speak English.<eos> - Missionaries.<eos> The language stayed.<eos> Their faith did not.<eos> My name is Nonhelema.<eos> You're Nonhelema?<eos> I've heard of you before, because you are a great chieftess.<eos> And... very beautiful and super intimidating.
- What can I do? - Nothing.<eos> Because I made one mistake?<eos> Yeah. 'Cause you made a mistake.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> You're right there.<eos> How I envy you, Tomas.<eos> You've got a family, a parish, a woman that you love. Please...<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> A good priest.
Danielle McAlister Simpson!<eos> Hakim Mohammed Abouzaid!<eos> James Anthony Simpson!<eos> Patricia Walls!<eos> Etta Mae Walls!<eos> Forgive me for asking questions you've already answered, Mr. Rance.<eos> On the night that Casey was put in the ambulance, a man was taken into custody, a priest.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's my understanding that he performed a... an exorcism here?<eos> Yes, with our permission.
Where Bennett Nealy and his partner flew you to America.<eos> A few nights ago, Mr. Nealy was murdered.<eos> Maybe it was one of you covering your tracks.<eos> Make sure your husband's enemies couldn't find you. No.<eos> We didn't kill anyone.<eos> My brother-in-law's wife and his children are in Toronto.<eos> Bennett was supposed to bring them next week.<eos> Why would we kill him?<eos> He says that you should talk to Bennett's pilot.<eos> Why him?
Akai Gurly... gunned down in the stairwell of his building.<eos> Delrawn Small... shot by an off-duty cop.<eos> Tamon Robinson... killed for stealing paving stones.<eos> Not all cops are like that.<eos> That's not me.<eos> It shouldn't be.<eos> You're a black woman.<eos> You still consider me black?<eos> - I wasn't sure.<eos> - With a black son.
You know he has a target on his back.<eos> - You leave him out of this.<eos> - And you know they won't.<eos> No matter how much of a "House Negro" you raise him to be.<eos> Maxine!<eos> You done with me, too?<eos> You think I killed that cop?<eos> The evidence is stacked against you.<eos> It must be nice... being a white rich girl caught with cocaine in her purse and gets off scot-free.<eos> Me?
You can't take that!<eos> Sure I can.<eos> Just like I'm sure I can have the Feds crawling up your ass in less than 10 minutes.<eos> Money laundering is like catnip to the Justice Department.<eos> Or you can tell me where Vince Scarlata was stashing his money.<eos> Vince had the funds transferred to Ace Den.<eos> It's a high-roller casino...<eos> very hush-hush.<eos> Vince was a gambler?<eos> Not a very good one.
Yeah.<eos> I suppose we can wait till tomorrow morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Can you get to your room OK? - I'll take her.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm sure the adults want to talk now.<eos> It was nice meeting you all.<eos> So... we're sisters.<eos> I guess.<eos> Half sisters.
No. No cops.<eos> Listen, don't come home, alright? Not yet.<eos> They're waiting for you.<eos> - Where are you? - I'm...<eos> I'm just out of town. I've got to go.<eos> I'll call you as soon as I can.<eos> Yeah. Love you.<eos> That's very funny, Connie.<eos> But you know, really, you've got to be very, very careful with the vine.<eos> - The vine?
Yes, of course.<eos> What were you after, a single or a twin?<eos> - A single's fine.<eos> - Sure.<eos> But you know what's just happened.<eos> I just went round to the ATM and it's eaten my... - Oh. - ...my card, yeah.<eos> Of course, I'll be able to sort it out in the morning with the bank, but just not right now.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but we do require either payment up-front or a credit card to hold funds here.<eos> - Payment up-front?<eos> - Yeah, cash for EFTPOS.

Maybe another time, eh?
Leave us.<eos> Now, you wish to make your case, you.<eos> The man in the cells beneath, he who says he is your brother. I'm going to interview him.<eos> Drummond.<eos> I'm going to make written record of it.<eos> You will release me, Inspector.<eos> Now!<eos> Do you know what you are tearing down here.<eos> The two of you, what of your life together?<eos> Your future.
Sir, Commissioner Bradford.<eos> Well, Fred what do you say?<eos> It is like cat meat soup, Teddy.<eos> You should know, your own presence here, a retired civilian gone rogue, it's unconscionable.<eos> But under current circumstances, there is one more intervention you might perform for us.<eos> - Reid.<eos> There will be an inquiry, internal.<eos> But we here have decided what Edmund Reid's fate should be.<eos> The others?<eos> Your man, Dove?
Steve, what do you think?<eos> That's good.<eos> What do you think he thinks?<eos> I don't know, but he's got that look in his eye.<eos> Yeah, I like that look a lot.<eos> What is that, a flash-bang?<eos> That's good. What are you gonna do with that? What's that gonna do?<eos> Cover me.<eos> Cover you how?<eos> With what?
How's life on the outside?<eos> Life is good.<eos> And that wife of yours, how's she doing?<eos> Yeah, she's great.<eos> Take care of her, now.<eos> You ain't gotta tell me.<eos> So come on, what have you been up to?<eos> I want all the details.<eos> Well, we'll discuss that another time.<eos> Another time?
- Really?<eos> Then why am I still looking at them?<eos> It's my room.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> I'm not asking a lot here. I just want you to put the clothes away.<eos> I have homework.<eos> I'll put them away later.<eos> Did you talk to Mom?<eos> Mom?
And I swear, nothing ever went down between us until I found those pictures.<eos> What pictures?<eos> You attended the Hideaway Mountain Camp when you were younger, that right?<eos> Church took some of us up there in the summers.<eos> It was super Bible thumper, but, uh... I didn't care. The place was awesome.<eos> You remember Larissa Abbott?<eos> No.<eos> Wait, was she the nurse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - '90 to '92.
You don't get it.<eos> Every time I open my mouth, it's worse for me.<eos> Meghan. Meghan, listen to me. I know you're scared.<eos> But whatever you say to me, that stays between us, okay?<eos> Your stepfather, he's never going to hear any of this.<eos> I promise you that, okay?<eos> Everybody in town looked up to him.<eos> Deacon Joe, perfect husband, perfect dad.<eos> He hit us for years.<eos> Fists, belt.
Did you get any sleep?<eos> I'm sure that bedroom's seen a lot of things, but I don't think a good night's sleep is one of them.<eos> Look, I need you to stay on top of the Nassar investigation.<eos> Use every resource our intelligence community - has to offer.<eos> - Absolutely, sir.<eos> - Good morning, Wyatt.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. President.<eos> Mr. President, I just got off the phone with our ambassador in Russia.<eos> Coach Weston was arrested upon landing in Moscow.<eos> What? On what charges?
Mr. President. I'm sorry. This is an emergency.<eos> It's about that situation in Kansas City.<eos> This is Dr. Arnold from the CDC, Lieutenant Colonel Gatz, Army Medical.<eos> What's going on?<eos> That flu outbreak in the Midwest... - It's not the flu, sir.<eos> - What is it?<eos> I'm afraid it's far more serious, Mr. President.<eos> The infected are victims of a synthetic toxin.<eos> - Toxin?<eos> - Ricin, sir.
- It was the right move, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Unfortunately, that is not why I asked you both here.<eos> Earlier today, at approximately 10:00 a.m.,<eos> Jason Atwood confessed to the killing of Majid Nassar.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> The deputy director of the FBI killed the world's most wanted terrorist?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> During his confession to me, he stated that he did not believe that Nassar was gonna provide us with any useful information and that on behalf of our fallen at the Capitol Building, he felt it his patriotic duty to take Nassar's life.<eos> His patriotic duty?
-It's an internal review. Why is Atwood being investigated?<eos> How do you know that's what's happening?<eos> Because here comes the Director of Internal Affairs John Foerstel.<eos> Agent Wells.<eos> Hi. A word?<eos> His name is Gabriel Thompson.<eos> He worked as a systems analyst for the National Security Agency for the last 20 years.<eos> And yesterday he just walked out the front door with a ton of classified information?<eos> Which this morning the NSA is calling -a "significant breach."<eos> -How significant?
- Excuse me.<eos> God bless all of you and these United States of America.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it is my profound honor to introduce Congressman Peter MacLeish, our next vice president.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> Congressman MacLeish, if you'll place your hand on the Bible and repeat after me.<eos> "I, Peter Lewis MacLeish..."<eos> I, Peter Lewis MacLeish...<eos> "...do solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States..."<eos> do solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States...<eos> "against all enemies, foreign and domestic..."

I come bearing sad news of the sleuthing kind.<eos> That gold locket belonged to Wendy Baldwin, local girl.<eos> She was 20 years old when she went missing 5 years ago this month.<eos> Well, the timeline matches up.<eos> Who reported her missing?<eos> Her parents, Gary and Anne Baldwin.<eos> They own a local feed and supply store.<eos> Was Wendy involved in prostitution?<eos> No. There's no sign of that.<eos> Any drug use?
Three years without talking to someone you were very close to.<eos> Living in the same city means it's more than just you turning down a job.<eos> Bull, come on, don't... don't do this.<eos> Don't use this trial to try to fix us.<eos> There are ten other firms out there that she could hire.<eos> None of them are as good as us, and you know that.<eos> We're taking this case, Benny.<eos> Relax.<eos> Today we're just meeting the lawyer.<eos> Just a lawyer, huh?
I make her gilded fruit centerpiece every Thanksgiving.<eos> How do Sara's centerpieces look?<eos> Well, she's not exactly the da Vinci of tablescaping.<eos> More like the Tower of Pisa.<eos> So she can't meet Izzy's standards.<eos> Great, so she secretly hates me?<eos> No, not necessarily.<eos> Depends on the captions.<eos> Uh, #Nailedlt, #LOL,<eos> #MaybeNextTime.
We have to vote someone out.<eos> -We draw names. -Draw names?<eos> All this to draw names?<eos> -It's fair. -Fair?<eos> -Let luck decide.<eos> -So, you're off the hook. Right?<eos> I'm in.<eos> I don't want to eliminate anyone.<eos> You know what you are?<eos> Cowards.
But I want you to watch over the overall Process.<eos> You understand?<eos> -I have a small daughter.<eos> -You're eliminated.<eos> I can answer...<eos> Ezequiel, does this have something to with...<eos> -with that candidate I eliminated?<eos> -Who?<eos> From last year.<eos> -Who?
You understand?<eos> -I have a small daughter.<eos> -You're eliminated.<eos> I can answer...<eos> Ezequiel, does this have something to with...<eos> -with that candidate I eliminated?<eos> -Who?<eos> From last year.<eos> -Who?<eos> -Talita, Ezequiel.
You are my wife, the one I love.<eos> I want you to be able to tell me anything.<eos> That will never change.<eos> I know.<eos> But you have to promise me it will stay between us.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Of course.<eos> I had a son.<eos> What?<eos> Before the Process.
I was wrong, then.<eos> I'm ashamed to have bet on you.<eos> You're weak.<eos> You're nothing.<eos> I shouldn't have listened to you, Ezequiel.<eos> You think you can change everyone's mind, but you can't.<eos> Sometimes it may seem like it, but no.<eos> You're nothing more than a piece of trash from the Inland.<eos> -Trash?<eos> -Trash.
It's a little late for that!<eos> You're actually pretty well stocked here.<eos> This used to be our main medical facility.<eos> This is where you were tattooed, where we erased your memory.<eos> Look, even if I can patch you up here, I can't just leave you out here by yourself.<eos> Shepherd wants both of us dead now, and the FBI, they...<eos> - they can protect you.<eos> I'd rather die than turn myself over to them.<eos> Well, out here alone, against Sandstorm's army, you will die.<eos> "Sandstorm."
Dr. Shaw is a research scientist who worked with a patient you also treated, Lucille Bockes.<eos> Lucille Bockes is dead.<eos> Actually, she's not.<eos> No, I-I put her into hospice care over four years ago.<eos> I won't pretend to understand how it all works, but I must say, Dr. Shaw really is something of a wizard.<eos> Lucille responded to my treatment and went into full remission.<eos> It's... it's not possible.<eos> Lucille Bockes is alive and well... and working as a prosecuting attorney.<eos> It's Kirk.<eos> Constantin.
So here I am. Time to let her go.<eos> I bear Masha no grudges.<eos> I promise her safe passage.<eos> I understand now how you see me... dangerous man... dying, polluted by his money.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Love did it, if you can believe it.<eos> It doesn't make much sense, but sometimes you can feel too much, hold on too long... it poisons you.<eos> I should have let go of you... years ago, but you were my child.<eos> I'm gonna be dead soon, and my biggest regret is that... you will remember me like this and not the young father who cradled you in his arms.<eos> A lifetime in front of us.
I'll plan it real proper, like, you know.<eos> Might take some time, mate.<eos> They've got a lot of security here, Bruno.<eos> Gus, stop mucking about.<eos> Yeah, no, no, no. I don't want to scare the horses, mate.<eos> I mean, slowly, slowly, catchy monkey.<eos> Can you just give me a call the minute a convertible comes in, all right?<eos> And then I'll meet you at Mikey's.<eos> You got it? Hey, Gus, who is she close to?<eos> Oh, younger brother, Jamie.

Hey, Gus, who is she close to?<eos> Oh, younger brother, Jamie.<eos> Half-sister.
Harriet...<eos> Harriet!<eos> What is she doin'?<eos> Hey, Bruno.<eos> Back in town.<eos> Lookin' sharp.<eos> You know, a spot of business, follow the dollar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, listen, last time you were here, that guy you were with...<eos> - Gus.
- The dress shop.<eos> I met with the owner's partners and they agreed to drop the charges.<eos> In return for what?<eos> Mum... it's okay.<eos> I know you'll hate me but it was an expression of loyalty and love for my beautiful sister and if you look at it that way...<eos> You took my necklace to save her?<eos> Someone had to.<eos> Hang on. Who did you meet?<eos> Her business partners.<eos> What business partners?
It's just... the two of you are so close.<eos> Billie's good.<eos> As far as I know.<eos> - Anyway...<eos> - Hey, what do you say we make a deal?<eos> Let's just put all of the past behind us.<eos> Everything's wiped, okay? Clean slate.<eos> Sure.<eos> Are we still friends, Harry?<eos> - Best ever.
What's gonna happen to her?<eos> It'll force her to submit.<eos> A union of demon and host.<eos> Two entities becoming one. Integration.<eos> Integration, it's said to be permanent.<eos> Help me.<eos> Thank you for being here.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<eos> - The Lord be with you.<eos> And also with your spirit.
Why? That what blew up the Niners' shop?<eos> You thinking the vets retaliated for Fillibert?<eos> Every sign's pointing in that direction.<eos> It just... doesn't make sense though.<eos> See where Loretta's at on Fillibert's autopsy.<eos> Maybe we can match bullet to gun.<eos> Chris'll go to the hospital, find out what the vics know.<eos> Coming back to the squad room?<eos> No. Pay another visit to the vets.<eos> This time with a warrant.
I missed you, too.<eos> You think...<eos> Yeah, she screwed him.<eos> No doubt.<eos> I just... just still don't believe it.<eos> Two years.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Why'd you leave?<eos> I don't know, I was just... dealing with some stuff, you know?<eos> Stuff.
I thought they were to get into places where he was meeting her.<eos> When I couldn't connect them to any hotels, I confronted him.<eos> He got angry.<eos> He wouldn't tell me anything about the cards or the woman.<eos> Our thing... was over.<eos> But I didn't kill him.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> We might, if you can tell us where you were last night.<eos> Home.<eos> With my husband.
Damn.<eos> Yeah, well, it's L.A. 2016, you know.<eos> Things move fast.<eos> Even online, everything I find in my price range is already rented.<eos> I mean, I guess you could always bunk here.<eos> You know, Mac and I can turn the attic into a third bedroom.<eos> Nice try. But I'm not moving in with you.<eos> And Mac, all right?<eos> Like a Three's Company situation.<eos> But with better clothes.
Do y'all know how blood clots are formed?<eos> When a blood vessel wall breaks, platelets change shape from round to spiny, sticking to the broken vessel wall and each other to plug the break.<eos> They interact with other blood proteins to form fibrin strands into a net trapping more platelets and... producing a clot.<eos> Dang, you're pretty smart.<eos> You should hear what those folks are coming up with.<eos> Good.<eos> Their expert failed to teach them.<eos> This presents us the opportunity to define the terms.<eos> - I'd call that a win.<eos> - A small one.
Come on.<eos> So what about you?<eos> You want to go for a walk?<eos> Maybe I'll tell you some secrets.<eos> I feel deprived of this in the city.<eos> Light pollution... it's a terrible plague.<eos> Well, I'm sure it has its trade-offs.<eos> You've seen all that passes for nightlife around here.<eos> Why, Ms. Diana, are you trying to take advantage of me?<eos> The great Dr. Bull?
Maybe we can't.<eos> But we can still win.<eos> I'm having fewer regrets about not making the trip down.<eos> It's tough to see you like this.<eos> I prefer this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's time to play the ace in the hole.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What's that?<eos> You.
I'm not mad. I'm merely disappointed.<eos> - And there's a difference.<eos> - Let's be honest, the reason you're not satisfied is because Diana didn't call it a win.<eos> - Ooh... All right, it's a win.<eos> With an asterisk.<eos> After the first time you, quote,<eos> "didn't lose in Callisto,"<eos> - how'd you pull out of your tailspin?<eos> - Wait a minute, don't tell me my sister was your Callisto rebound.<eos> Not exactly.
With a single pill like painkiller. Remedy to cure all illness.<eos> If it cures cancer that easily, is it profitable?<eos> I'd make it more complicated to get.<eos> Sir, do you have a permit?<eos> Here.<eos> All the way down the hall. Then turn right.<eos> Yu's office is right here.<eos> Where is the Security Control Center?<eos> Who you teaming up with?<eos> With him.
I couldn't protect her.<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> You did everything you could.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you think she'll ever come back?<eos> Keyword?<eos> Flashpoint Zulu.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Um, myself.
Says I shouldn't trust you.<eos> He wants me to meet with him.<eos> Reaching through the waterfall is not a task for the timid.<eos> The things you touch are as likely to harm as to heal.<eos> Lies that seem like truths, truth that seems like a lie.<eos> It's easy for the ignorant to be brave.<eos> On the other hand, to straddle that line beneath the falling water, knowing you have no way of knowing whether you're the hero or the villain... that takes a special kind of courage.<eos> Rare.<eos> In the end, none of us write our own epitaph.<eos> Except maybe Bob Dylan.
For not talking to you first.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> How's the family?<eos> Good God, even I don't want to talk about them.<eos> What do you really want?<eos> I have a new client. Working freelance.<eos> My client wants to meet Mr. Song.<eos> I told him the Firm would be willing to make an introduction for a fee.<eos> And why does he want to meet Mr. Song?<eos> A large fee.
I saw something in my dream.<eos> What'd you see?<eos> A matchbook from a restaurant.<eos> I'll wake Sabine and go with you.<eos> No, let her sleep; she's happy.<eos> Besides, you two need time to work things out.<eos> You don't have to do everything on your own.<eos> Tell Sabine I took her car keys.<eos> What's the name of the restaurant?<eos> Marcello's.
So... this is you.<eos> I guess you didn't choose to be you, but... here you are.<eos> God help us all.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Where?<eos> Topeka. He'll be safer in Topeka.<eos> Get him up.<eos> Give me the contract.<eos> If you give me a minute to check the contract, I'll take you through the terms.<eos> Contracts?
Yeah, just give me ten minutes to shower.<eos> We can meet in the shower.<eos> So... how was the gym?<eos> It was fine.<eos> Wh-what do you mean, fine?<eos> Wh-what happened?<eos> He's just...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Michael. - Such a player!
We can meet in the shower.<eos> So... how was the gym?<eos> It was fine.<eos> Wh-what do you mean, fine?<eos> Wh-what happened?<eos> He's just...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Michael. - Such a player!<eos> With his muscles and his flirting.
It was fine.<eos> Wh-what do you mean, fine?<eos> Wh-what happened?<eos> He's just...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Michael. - Such a player!<eos> With his muscles and his flirting.<eos> He was flirting with you?<eos> No, not me.
Well, thank you for apologizing.<eos> I really thought you were sleeping with that producer woman.<eos> Well, we all make mistakes.<eos> Of course he was sleeping with her!<eos> How do you think I got the audition? - Rogelio.<eos> Rogelio!<eos> - Is this true? - Look, it doesn't matter...<eos> - I knew it.<eos> You're still the same shallow playboy<eos> - all about the muscles...
I'm joined tonight by attorney Jake Gregorian, who until recently represented Oscar Keaton, awaiting trial for the murder of his wife, Sarah.<eos> Jake, I understand you'd like to make an announcement?<eos> Yes, I'm actually pleased to share the news that Oscar Keaton has rehired me as his attorney.<eos> And how in the world did you persuade him to do that?<eos> Because, last we heard from Oscar, he was accusing you of sleeping with his wife.<eos> Yes.<eos> it was one night... a moment of regrettable weakness for both of us... which has absolutely no bearing on this case.<eos> Oscar and I are focused on moving forward, finding the real killer.<eos> That's the only thing that matters.<eos> - With that single purpose in mind...
Have a detective debrief the Farringdons.<eos> I want to know exactly what Jake was doing there.<eos> Any luck with his brother and Ella Benjamin?<eos> No, they're refusing to talk.<eos> - Julia, hi.<eos> - I just spoke to Jake.<eos> Julia, if you're helping him, it's aiding and abetting a fugitive.<eos> I can help you find him.<eos> I can even help you bring him in.<eos> On one condition.
I'm just sorry you didn't feel you could do the same.<eos> It was just protocol.<eos> Protocol?<eos> A man showed up at my house with a gun. And you're gonna talk to me about protocol?<eos> And then this man who wants to kill you-- he tells me that I don't know you at all.<eos> - Boze... - That everything you've ever told me was a lie.<eos> You know the worst part?<eos> I know this lunatic killer was telling the truth, while my "Best friend" lied.<eos> Mr. Bozer, the purpose of this meeting is to determine if you are a security threat to the United States.<eos> Security threat? Me?
My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan.<eos> My father was killed in 1996.<eos> Last night...<eos> - I spoke to him.<eos> - Your father?
- Next.<eos> Do you like halal?<eos> No clue.<eos> Really?<eos> I love this stuff.<eos> You know they bless it before they kill it?<eos> - Seriously? - Yeah.<eos> So, Sullivan, what kind of cop you want to be, huh?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A good cop.
My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan.<eos> My father was killed in 1996.<eos> Last night...<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I spoke to him.<eos> - Your father? - Dad?
Detective Sullivan, knowing Eva Salinas faked her abduction by the Nightingale, have charges been brought against her?<eos> That's a question for the district attorney.<eos> How does it feel to know that your mother's killer's still out there?<eos> We're working round the clock to apprehend the Nightingale and get justice for all his victims.<eos> So as soon as that sugar rush kicks in, I need you to follow up on a tip.<eos> Mm, looking into something right now. Mike could use the exercise, though.<eos> There's plenty to go around.<eos> You know how many tips came in ever since Eva Salinas' "Gone Girl" escapade?<eos> Besides, this guy asked for Detective Sullivan.<eos> - Me? - Uh-huh.
Let me know as soon as you find out.<eos> You find anything, you'll let me know?<eos> - Okay, sure.<eos> - Okay, now it's a joke.<eos> What are you doing here? Me?<eos> Oh, I... I work over there.<eos> You?<eos> I'm working here.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> A detective, actually.
It's "khoo-vakh."<eos> She took my Where's Waldo.<eos> Well, no, no, he's over there.<eos> Oh, yeah, there he is.<eos> So, what's the deal with your apartment? Why's it taking so long?<eos> Um, it was a drywall problem.<eos> Oh, no, what happened?<eos> Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it's really more...<eos> Wet wall?<eos> Or damp wall, just as bad.
You don't have to make a decision right now.<eos> I've already decided.<eos> I want to set a good example for Mateo.<eos> So I have to stop this completely insane and corrupt cycle that is the Solano family.<eos> So, I've been thinking, I should work on my relationship with God right now.<eos> Hold off a little with Mateo.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I think that's a goo gidea.<eos> And I'm happy to go to church with you.<eos> Occasionally.
My father was killed in 1996. Last night...<eos> - Hey. - I spoke to him.<eos> - Your father?
- I am telling you, this lady who owned this brothel in Thailand was a genius!<eos> Mm! And they threatened to run away, but my grandma chickened out, so Alba convinced her to spend the night in the barn.<eos> She's incredible, Michael. Well traveled and artistic - and adventurous and so funny.<eos> - Mm. - We were up all night.<eos> - Oh, I heard.<eos> When do you think she's gonna be out of the shower?<eos> 'Cause the movers are gonna be here any minute.<eos> I'm sure she's almost done.<eos> So, we were actually talking about her staying for a few more days.<eos> With us?
Oh, thank you honey, that's so sweet.<eos> - How's it going with, um...<eos> - The wi-fi won't work, and this whole place smells like Cup O' Noodles.<eos> Mom, this is April, Rainer's daughter.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you. - Hi.<eos> So, I'm gonna look for a ladies' room.<eos> Do they have those in factories?<eos> Uh, we do, yes.<eos> It's just down the hall.<eos> - Just down the hall.
What could have happened?<eos> She asked me to do push-ups while she put on her wedding dress.<eos> Wow, she jumped right to the Honeymoon Handshake.<eos> It has a name?<eos> Don't you and your dad ever talk?<eos> Okay, we've searched everywhere for Stella.<eos> - No sign.<eos> - Yet.<eos> Don't worry, we'll find her before the gray goat does.<eos> - Who?

No, but this might be.<eos> Victim's cell phone.<eos> Yeah, I talked to every guest who would answer the door.<eos> Nobody's willing to admit they saw or heard anything unusual. I have the registry, but...<eos> Well, I heard something.<eos> I was just getting some ice, and I couldn't help but overhear.<eos> You have information, ma'am?<eos> I heard shouting between two men.<eos> And I opened my hotel door, and I saw a car just take off out of the parking lot.<eos> Oh...
I don't feel like talking.<eos> Right.<eos> Rather just scroll through Twitter all night.<eos> _<eos> They had names.<eos> Families.<eos> Kids.<eos> He did that, not you.<eos> It was my body.<eos> And my hands.
We should have killed you when we had the chance.<eos> She speaks.<eos> I felt you the moment you walked through these doors.<eos> I don't know how we missed it the first time.<eos> Well, you were distracted.<eos> I tried to let it go, but I just knew that I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing that you were still out there.<eos> Not after what you did to me.<eos> All the suffering for nothing.<eos> In the end, you're just a child throwing a tantrum.<eos> "Tantrum"?
Yes, it is.<eos> By some miracle, I got the security deposit back on my house.<eos> Now you put that with everything else I managed to scrape together... and I got a new place.<eos> A place so great, I'm never gonna have to pay rent again.<eos> Really?<eos> How?<eos> Behold.<eos> It's... a trailer.<eos> Precisely.<eos> In front of my house.
Aw, I love you.<eos> You know, it just slipped out.<eos> That's why I do Kegels.<eos> Maybe he just didn't hear me.<eos> You know, but if I say it again, and he did hear me and just isn't ready to say it yet, it'll be twice as embarrassing.<eos> - Love is the worst.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's like doing ecstasy, seems like a fun idea, then suddenly you're at the top of the Space Needle, puking into some tourist's cleavage.<eos> Well, what did you do last night?<eos> Nobody.
Especially when one of us looks like Hank.<eos> Williams.<eos> Well, I thought we were going as a country band.<eos> No, you said that, and we said, "definitely not, that would be weird."<eos> Especially since Cory Casey is a huge 60s space rock fan.<eos> Okay, okay, well, in my defense, I think I was sneezing when you said that last part.<eos> And by the way, nobody said "God bless you," so I think we all have something to be sorry for.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> We're the band.<eos> What band?
- and he insisted he didn't make one.<eos> - So if he loses, He'll be held liable for damages, which could be millions.<eos> And he may never practice again.<eos> For someone like Terry...<eos> Brilliant, a pioneer...<eos> That's all he has.<eos> I'm assuming that the good doctor has an equally accomplished lawyer?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> He's had some disagreements with his lawyers.<eos> Lawyers?
But there are more artful hunters drawn here from the surrounding forest.<eos> A jaguar, the supreme jungle predator.<eos> The river marks the edge of his territory but here he has competition.<eos> He's now in the territory of a female.<eos> She has ruled this stretch of river for five years.<eos> This is her place to hunt.<eos> Capybara are strong and wary.<eos> The key is stealth.<eos> She needs to get within one metre if she's to pounce.<eos> Not this time.
And first sign of trouble, you went scampering back.<eos> Little pig.<eos> Little pig.<eos> Let me in!<eos> You're going to open the door for me when you hear what I do to your wretched family.<eos> Please.<eos> Let them go.<eos> The sounds they're going to make.<eos> I know what you are.<eos> Demon.
Stop it!<eos> Your grandma didn't want you in the Vatican, she wanted you holding her hand while she died, but you couldn't even manage that, could you?<eos> No.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> No.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Truth is, it took weeks.<eos> Weeks, Tomas.
- Why is he asking Chicago?<eos> - Good question.<eos> You know what, Gavin, if this is who you really are, then you can forget about Thanksgiving and all the holidays and all the non-holidays.<eos> Pretty much what I'm talking about is every day.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, guys, let's remember the reason for the season.<eos> We're all very thankful.<eos> Jess, I am so sorry.<eos> I had no idea you two were together.<eos> I thought you were his physical therapist.<eos> Physical therapist?
Oh, well, that's not fascinating at all.<eos> That's fresh from the sarcasm factory, 'cause it is fascinating.<eos> Thought you would've mentioned that before.<eos> You guys ask me surprisingly little about my personal life.<eos> You're okay with this, right?<eos> I mean, you wanted to see other people.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I definitely said that.<eos> Yeah, I actually have a date, too.<eos> - You do? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - With who?
I mean, Schmidt, I love you, but... but you're not a man of the people.<eos> Of course I'm not a man of the people... I'm above the people.<eos> I want the people to build things for me.<eos> And that's where I come in.<eos> I can't rely on your... crass Chicago street smarts forever.<eos> I'm a homeowner, and I'm a husband, and hopefully, one day I'll be a father.<eos> If he's not gonna respect me, then I need to become someone that he will.<eos> That sounds a little scary.<eos> Who-who are you looking to become, Schmidt?<eos> You.
Not until you promise to let this little turkey live out the rest of his life with Rosa.<eos> What?<eos> Why can't it live with you?<eos> I'm an ideas man.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> You've left me no choice.<eos> There we go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now give us the bird. Gladly.<eos> Whoop, whoop...
I was just researching Evie's boyfriend.<eos> It's a long story, but it's taken a bit of a disturbing turn.<eos> You're probably never gonna get over her, are you?<eos> Yeah, it's really interesting.<eos> Academic journals.<eos> Does he have a PhD?<eos> What was his dissertation?<eos> Academic records.<eos> Hey, do you know if student records are always sealed?<eos> Fernie?
- to go in there and get them? - We will keep trying to find a safe way to reach those memories.<eos> We won't try.<eos> We will.<eos> Kayla, have you ever heard of optogenetics?<eos> N-No.<eos> We're gonna go in and reprogram your husband's brain.<eos> With your permission.<eos> Hey. I was on my way to the garage to meet<eos> - with Scott and Angie. - You okay?<eos> Me?
I left my parish to become a doctor, but I'm still a priest.<eos> I honor my vows.<eos> That probably makes things easier.<eos> Just in terms of relationships.<eos> It's so complicated.<eos> That's why I don't date guys at work.<eos> Not to get too personal, but, you're here 80 hours a week.<eos> Who else are you gonna date?<eos> James.<eos> Brockett.
Where they mix bacon with syrup?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> ! Come with me, Mother.<eos> You're a good boy, Donnie.<eos> You always were.<eos> But I don't know anyone in America.<eos> I'm not getting any younger.<eos> I don't have the energy to move to a new country.<eos> And besides, where would I live?<eos> With me.
No, no, no.<eos> This isn't like you.<eos> Now, you are deceptive, sure.<eos> But not cruel.<eos> These names in your bag, all fake.<eos> Every single one of them.<eos> But of course you know that, just like you know how badly I want to find the person who burned me.<eos> So what is this to you?<eos> It's a test?<eos> What?
Speak to your father.<eos> I have waited a very long time for this moment.<eos> My mother told me so much about you.<eos> She told me I was like you, and that one day I'd be famous like you.<eos> And now I see you, everything she told me was true.<eos> Everything about my life makes sense now.<eos> Someone once explained to me what a miracle is.<eos> So now I understand, Magnus.<eos> Your birth was a miracle.<eos> A miracle?
Are you who this man says you are?<eos> Well, that's a complicated question, sir.<eos> Yes. Yes, we are.<eos> Mr. Roe here says you're the best spies he's got in the Culper Ring.<eos> Yes, that's him.<eos> Mr. Austin Roe, the renowned Prussian spy.<eos> Well, thank God for him.<eos> He's the one who warned me about Arnold's betrayal, though the bastard still slipped through our fingers.<eos> And you, you're a free man?<eos> And a hell of a spy.
- Walking around, shouting "Melissa" is just not working, man.<eos> Well, it works a hell of a lot better than doing nothing.<eos> Come on, Todd, please. - Todd.<eos> - No, no, no, you enjoy your sleep, okay?<eos> - Todd. - Todd, think about what you're doing.<eos> Please, Todd.<eos> Todd, come back.<eos> He literally hit the wall.<eos> Todd speed, my friend.<eos> Todd speed.
Distilled?<eos> Yeah. I know how you feel about tap water.<eos> Susie didn't share my views about fluoride in the tap water.<eos> Genetically modified foods, on the other hand, she was all over that.<eos> She even got the school that she taught at to ban GMOs from the cafeteria.<eos> She was a schoolteacher?<eos> High school history.<eos> She wasn't your typical CT.<eos> What's a CT?<eos> Conspiracy Theorist.
And that is what Susie came here to get.<eos> For the last few days, she'd been conducting interviews with the locals who came into contact with these men in the days leading up to the assassination.<eos> And, right before she was killed, she told me that she was close to proving once and for all that the LGT was crap.<eos> Lone Gunman Theory.<eos> Let's just suppose Susie found something during her investigation that actually did get her killed.<eos> Now, we need to find out what that is, which means we need to retrace her steps.<eos> I can help you out there.<eos> According to the calendar on her phone, she had two interviews the morning that she arrived.<eos> The first was with this gentleman,<eos> George Sellers.
We never met in person, but somehow she got the word that I was the man to see about decoding an encrypted message from 1963.<eos> Breaking old ciphers is something of a hobby of mine.<eos> Well, I politely declined, hoping she would drop the investigation.<eos> She obviously didn't.<eos> When I heard what happened, I thought it best to come forward.<eos> This is the message about Joseph Eastman and Pimlico?<eos> Yes.<eos> But once deciphered, it was a warning.<eos> A warning?<eos> About what?
- Yeah, I'm so excited.<eos> - This is Nikolaj's first Christmas because the orphanage kept cancelling it.<eos> Once it was blizzards, one it was fires, and once it was...<eos> - famine. - That's right, famine.<eos> - Oh. - Papa promised me the best present ever:<eos> A captain Latvia action figure!<eos> Whoa, captain Latvia?<eos> What's his superpower?<eos> Can he talk to moose?<eos> No, possums.
It's not gonna be fine.<eos> Finally, let's talk about community outreach.<eos> Does anyone have any ideas about... ♪ fa-la-la-la-la, la la la la ♪<eos> Who are these golden-throated dorks? - It's the MTA.<eos> - That's right.<eos> The metropolitan transit authority.<eos> I assumed you've climbed out of your rat tunnels to taunt us about tonight's charity caroling competition.<eos> No, no, no, of course not.<eos> We're here to wish you luck, since every year we... ♪ Kick...♪ ♪ your ♪<eos> ♪ butts ♪
How is no one talking about this musical?<eos> It's so good.<eos> Wow, you guys look more upset than Aaron burr, sir.<eos> That's from the musical "Hamilton," which I just discovered, basically.<eos> We lost the caroling competition.<eos> And now we hate singing.<eos> Almost as much as we hate the MTA.<eos> Yeah, so we should prank call their tip line with a series of well-crafted insults.<eos> We should toilet paper their houses.<eos> - With rocks.
Scared the bejesus out of me.<eos> Made me wet my panties.<eos> But you said they were wet from something before.<eos> Well, that wasn't true.<eos> I was a lying skunk back then.<eos> But not anymore.<eos> See, today, I'd proudly admit that that wetness came from my penis.<eos> And that's all 'cause of you, girl.<eos> I-I don't want to hear that there's no magic in this world, 'cause you David Copperfielded me.<eos> Bigly.
Yeah, he'll be along after he checks his phone.<eos> We can get started.<eos> So, the guy we think wound up in that sausage was arguing with a woman named Alma Cabrera.<eos> She's a nurse in the oncology department at Mountview.<eos> Sure.<eos> That's Joaq.<eos> Joaq?<eos> Joaquin Pereya.<eos> He's a great guy, we hang out sometimes.<eos> Kind of an off and on thing.
We should check out Jenkins' loft.<eos> We'd need a warrant.<eos> I'm not an agent yet. I don't need one.<eos> You do.<eos> I don't like my partners wandering off alone.<eos> Well, I'm nobody's partner yet, either, and I'm just going to look around, see if any neighbors want to talk.<eos> All right, hurry up.<eos> If I sense any danger, you're out of there.<eos> All right, Spidey.<eos> Easy on my door.
You blockhead.<eos> He said he was out-of-body after reading your blog.<eos> That's all bullshit.<eos> I made it up.<eos> What's with her?<eos> - She seems angry.<eos> - Maybe because of you.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> I'm out of my body. I'm out of my body.<eos> Out of my body...
How could he do this to me?<eos> With great ease, I imagine.<eos> On paper, you're utterly disposable.<eos> You're an ex-con, you're penniless, sullied, disenfranchised.<eos> You tell me, what do I do?<eos> You have two problems.<eos> The first is that your prints were left on a weapon which was discarded at the scene of a shooting.<eos> Second is that once those prints are analyzed, you'll become a suspect in that shooting.<eos> Thanks to Agent Whitlock, there's currently very little to be done about problem one.<eos> Problem two, on the other hand...
We know that your end resolve is to kill as many of us as you can.<eos> We know that.<eos> What happened, George?<eos> Did you lose control?<eos> I never had control.<eos> I'm just a negotiator. I'm just one man.<eos> George, if you get me one hostage and you, I'll sit down face-to-face on live radio.<eos> You owe me that much.<eos> Can I come out there and talk to you on live radio, just me?<eos> No, one hostage with you.
Cheers.<eos> By 2007, he's ready to play in the big leagues.<eos> So, he targets... a well-known billionaire heiress, one of the richest hundred women on earth.<eos> Let's call her Holly.<eos> He slides up to her and his opening line is:<eos> "My favorite book."<eos> Now, this girl's no slouch.<eos> She knows when she's getting hit on, so she gives the guy the cold shoulder.<eos> But this scam artist is ready for the long haul.<eos> Well, okay, not so long.
That was the degree that she fooled people.<eos> She was able to do it with a car like that.<eos> Liz was a con woman through and through.<eos> In a previous life, she'd been a con man.<eos> Jerry Dean Michael was wanted for counterfeiting.<eos> By the time she started the Dale scam, she'd already been on the run from the law for 15 years.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> There's a woman who was born a man is now selling a three-wheeled car<eos> - with a wooden chassis and crappy engine.
So, what was the degree of difficulty?<eos> Museum security's not the same as robbing a bank.<eos> -So somewhere in the middle.<eos> -That's fair. What you got?<eos> Check this out.<eos> I've got a notorious air pirate.<eos> I see you're going to Seattle.<eos> Enjoy your flight.<eos> It's Thanksgiving eve, and everybody wants to get home to their families.<eos> Except for this guy.
Mr. Cooper seems to be hanging on to his briefcase pretty tight.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Flight 305.<eos> -Can I help you with your briefcase?<eos> At 2:50 p.m., we're airborne.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Flight 305.<eos> This is your captain speaking.<eos> We'll be flying at an altitude of 5 feet.<eos> Keep your seatbelt fastened.<eos> Once you were in the air, flying in 1971 wasn't so different from today.<eos> Aside from that.
This was what he signed up for, and he knew that the unexpected could happen.<eos> The original plan had been for them to come back to the apartment, trade team member for the afternoon meeting, but they were running late 'cause traffic in Baghdad was horrible.<eos> So they didn't come back and Tom ended up staying with them for the Muslim Scholars Association in the afternoon.<eos> [Loney] Well, my understanding of the Muslim Scholars Association is that it had links to the insurgency.<eos> Going to talk to a very hardline Sunni group about trying to ease the problems in Iraq is probably not the wisest thing.<eos> It's a bit like going to see Al Capone in Chicago in the '30s to see if, you know, "Can't you do something about the crime in this city?"<eos> "Yes, I can control it all. You know, that's what I do."<eos> [Loney] We got there, and there was this mosque that Saddam built, called the Mother of All Battles, and the minarets were designed to look like scud missiles.<eos> It's like a vast compound with this big, giant parking lot...<eos> Empty.
- You're 15.<eos> Long-term goals.<eos> My body's still changing.<eos> I'm right... I'm right...<eos> I'm right behind!<eos> It's 8:00!<eos> We're going to get suspended, on account of meatloaf!<eos> Take the canal, Tobes.<eos> It'll save us five minutes.<eos> Not... the... canal!
What are you doing?<eos> - Research.<eos> - Hey, look up "talking amulet."<eos> I already did that.<eos> All I got was toys. One of them was a plushie.<eos> - Jim, would you agree?<eos> - Sir? With Herodotus' opinion on his tactics of war, as I've described.<eos> Oh, uh... - Absolutely.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Which tactics, specifically?
His noble obligation is protective.<eos> Like "protecting"?<eos> You mean like a superhero?<eos> Oh, can I be his sidekick?<eos> With a cool superhero name like Deathblade or Snipersnake?<eos> Just wait.<eos> Who would I be protecting?<eos> - Us.<eos> - And mankind.<eos> From bad trolls.

Just focus and incant, dude!<eos> Uh, "For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command." "For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command."<eos> "For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command."<eos> Uh... nope.<eos> Whoa! Use your sword, Master Jim!<eos> I'll drink your blood out of a goblet made of your skull!<eos> Cut him like a meatloaf, Jim!<eos> We must work quickly.<eos> Open the portal!<eos> The Horngazel!
I'll drink your blood out of a goblet made of your skull!<eos> Cut him like a meatloaf, Jim!<eos> We must work quickly.<eos> Open the portal!<eos> The Horngazel!<eos> Master Jim! Master Jim, come on!<eos> I'm a little busy here.<eos> You are not fit to wield the amulet.<eos> I'll tear the armor off you!<eos> Along with your skin!
Why'd the armor suddenly shut off?<eos> Master Jim, you are the first human to possess an amulet crafted for trolls.<eos> It's to be expected its behavior will be... unexpected.<eos> This way, Masters.<eos> This way.<eos> Are you sure we're safe in here?<eos> Indeed.<eos> The incantation forbids entry to Heartstone Trollmarket by GummGumms such as Bular, for they are the most fearsome of trolls.<eos> - "GummGumms"?<eos> - Scary ones.
Ridiculous garment.<eos> - You're late.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Draal was training Jim.<eos> - Draal?<eos> - Training? Yeah, he sorta made a home in my basement to look out for the place.<eos> Of course. When a troll is defeated in combat, it's completely natural for them to take refuge in the victor's domicile.<eos> So, you understand?<eos> I understand such an arrangement could only end in disaster.<eos> Utter disaster!
This could be a good thing!<eos> They think I'm helping them.<eos> - I've learned things.<eos> - Like?<eos> Yes, I'll be happy to go.<eos> Mr. Six-Eyes and Big Scary Name...<eos> Blinky and Aaarrrgghh.<eos> Yeah. The big one don't talk much... but the smart one's certainly taken to the boy.<eos> You should've seen how he stood up for him against the old goat man.<eos> Mr. Trollmarket.

Now!<eos> As you wish, Your Greatness.<eos> What has become of Stricklander?<eos> He appears to have grown soft.<eos> In his human guise, he has become the boy's teacher. I believe he has affection for the child.<eos> You question his loyalties?<eos> I do, Father.<eos> If his heart has turned, we must know.<eos> Test him.<eos> With pleasure.
I called him Young Atlas.<eos> But I call him that.<eos> Me, alone!<eos> You should have seen his face.<eos> He'll know I'm working with you.<eos> He'll know I'm a Changeling.<eos> Of all the idiotic things you've done, you imbecile...<eos> I gave the order.<eos> Call it a test.<eos> A test?
If any of us were foolish enough to cross over, under no circumstances could you be saved, at risk of freeing Gunmar.<eos> - But, what if...?<eos> - Under no circumstances!<eos> Dude, don't be reckless!<eos> You almost just lost a golden tuna roll! Sit down!<eos> Relax!<eos> What happened to the Trollhunter answering every call?<eos> You have a strong heart, Master Jim, a quality rarely seen in trolls.<eos> I believe, one day, you will answer that child's call, but that day cannot be today.<eos> Chompsky, no!
Meet me in the alley beside the theater if you ever want to see your friend again.<eos> Don't open the Bridge!<eos> Under no circumstan...<eos> I've listened to it a hundred times now, and I still don't know what to do.<eos> You don't have to do this alone.<eos> You've got Aaarrrgghh, Draal, me.<eos> They said I had to be alone.<eos> If I'm not, what do you think they'll do to Blinky?<eos> Blinky made it clear.<eos> "Under no circumstances."
He's not a baby and he's not my brother.<eos> Finally, the help shows up.<eos> If you think for a second I'm changing your diaper...<eos> Please, I'm more than capable of using the loo like a civilized troll.<eos> I need you to pick me up a nice, thick, greasy cheeseburger, with a side of jo-jo potatoes.<eos> What do I look like?<eos> Your servant?<eos> All right, enough!<eos> You're a monster. You know that?<eos> Uh, not monster.

If you don't want to do it for us, Jimbo, do it for me.<eos> I've always felt like I was destined to be a duke.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll try to throw some kind of costume together, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> And put some effort into it.<eos> The things I do for Toby.<eos> Where am I supposed to find a costume?<eos> And what am I supposed to be?<eos> Stapler-man?
Ooh! You didn't happen to overhear who Strickler brought back with him, did you?<eos> Some troll with big horns and a weird staff, maybe?<eos> - Sorry, I do not know.<eos> - Yeah, well, neither do we.<eos> My mom's home! Everyone, hide!<eos> Oh, jeez!<eos> Hide, hide.<eos> Oh, no. Blinky!<eos> What the...?<eos> Not with the leftovers!
Another golem?<eos> - I thought you said it was made of mud!<eos> - Not glass! Well, there's four of us and only one of him.<eos> Flank him!<eos> Master Jim, it appears we have another guest!<eos> Get down!<eos> Our flank was outflanked.<eos> - Jim, what do we do?<eos> - I don't know. Last time, there was a weird stone doll in it.<eos> An animus totem.
We can't tell Jim. Promise me, you won't tell Jim.<eos> He already thinks I'm useless.<eos> Toby, look at us. We are useless. Ugh!<eos> Let me think, let me think, let me think.<eos> Maybe Blinky will know how to fix this! Blinky?<eos> He's at Jim's house.<eos> Well, then let's go!<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Yeah, he's been talking to the new guidance counselor about his father...<eos> Guidance counselor?
Aaarrrgghh, it says here that Angor's been stealing the souls of Trollhunters in a blasphemous attempt to fill the void ever since.<eos> You don't have to hide it from me.<eos> I might only have two eyes, but I can see clear as day.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> Ever since my human deformity, you have been distant.<eos> Uh... yes.<eos> Distant.<eos> I may look different, but I'm still the same Blinky.<eos> How about, to cheer you up, maybe later today, I could rent a mini-van, we could go for a drive?<eos> Something with tinted windows, of course.
You can take his feet.<eos> Magical solutions are a delicate matter. You must be precise.<eos> Find the exact tool for the job at hand.<eos> - What did you do with our feet? - Oh!<eos> Gut! I'm wiggling your toes.<eos> So where do we find the right tool?<eos> I know just the place!<eos> Are you ready, young wards, to embark with me on the greatest adventure?<eos> Oh, yeah! Where? Where?<eos> The adventure of reading!
Hmm... I've got it! "Nacho cheese."<eos> And it's "nacho" day, either.<eos> I said, "Now!"<eos> Master Jim!<eos> For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command!<eos> - A trick?<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Down the hatch!<eos> - Not again.<eos> After them!
I-I truly doubt he's keeping anything secret from you.<eos> Yeah, what... what do you think is going on with him?<eos> Ooh, let me...<eos> Growing pains?<eos> Oh, um, well, it's been more than that.<eos> He's been defiant.<eos> Jim has always been such a good boy.<eos> Well, perhaps the issue is that he's no longer a man...<eos> I mean, becoming a troll!<eos> A man!
- We may be down, but we're not out!<eos> - This is the Forge where heroes are born.<eos> - We're down four to one.<eos> And we're going to be down one more if we give up on Aaarrrgghh!<eos> My father watches us from above.<eos> Let us make the Trollhunters of the past proud.<eos> Let us make Trollmarket proud.<eos> Let us show our guests the humbling they deserve!<eos> Fools play for glory. But we play for Aaarrrgghh!<eos> For Aaarrrgghh!

Tell Wingman, he family. I, family.<eos> Toby-pie!<eos> Dinner! I'm never eating again!<eos> But you're being so rude to our exchange student!<eos> Arthur-San?<eos> - Aaarrrgghh! - Ooh. ...thur.<eos> - Oh. I'll get the pie.<eos> - You came back!<eos> But what about your family?<eos> Your home?
Jim, listen to me. Promise me we will. Okay?<eos> It took all of this for you to tell me about... your other life.<eos> I just didn't want to worry you. And I know I have.<eos> Yes, yes, you have.<eos> I am worried.<eos> I'm scared. But listen to me. It is my job to worry.<eos> And it's not your job to protect me.<eos> I want you to know something.<eos> Even before you found this amulet... way before all of this... you were always my hero.<eos> My beautiful boy.
Unlike the existing model, my memory filter is protected by triple firewall.<eos> So I am much safer for you.<eos> The day after tomorrow is your birthday.<eos> It's your birthday gift.<eos> Thank you, mommy.<eos> It's a happy family.<eos> It looks great.<eos> Why don't you paint this part a little more?<eos> Who is Dunko?<eos> Nothing.
Where they all go?<eos> Maybe we got lucky and they all dropped off, you know, when they lost the signal like at the train station.<eos> Always considered myself a pacifist, but I wouldn't mind having a pistol right now. Um, guys.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I go in with my hands raised and just say I want to talk.<eos> Maybe ring the doorbell.<eos> What's the worst that can happen?<eos> I'm a black man with a crowbar.<eos> I'm not walking over there.<eos> Okay, how about that one?
No, you've had enough of that to be dui. You know that, right?<eos> But it won't really count after the mass murder, you know?<eos> No one knows better than me that you can't stop progress.<eos> But still, you're never too old to fight it.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Shit, the truck. Get down!<eos> Alice, you all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Shit.<eos> Ardai!

The fuel of my magic is life.<eos> We only have enough prisoners to send through our strongest warriors.<eos> But that will be enough.<eos> The enemy is weak.<eos> When we arrive, we will take them as fuel.<eos> We will build a new portal.<eos> And when it is complete, we will bring through all... of the Horde.<eos> Let me go first.<eos> For the Horde!<eos> With child?
An attack?<eos> - What?<eos> - Stop requesting Callan.<eos> Stay out of my business.<eos> He wants to follow in his father's footsteps.<eos> My son doesn't need your help.<eos> Tread carefully when you talk to your queen.<eos> You are my sister first.<eos> When was your last visit to Karazhan?<eos> With you.
More of our villages burned tonight.<eos> One of them is the village of my birth.<eos> I can not imagine what horrors you have been through, Garona.<eos> But this does not need to happen.<eos> We have peace in these lands for many years now.<eos> Peace between races from all over the world.<eos> What is this?<eos> I can have it removed.<eos> There is a life here for you, Garona.<eos> With us.
Just, stop!<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> It's one guy.<eos> It'll take five minutes, tops.<eos> We're supposed to be keeping a low profile, not drawing attention to ourselves, remember?<eos> By the time he realizes what's going on, we'll be long gone.<eos> You don't know that. You can't just jump in without thinking.<eos> Not this time.
I never quit a Friend when needed ... nor avoided danger.<eos> I will not begin to do it now.<eos> And stop calling me Doctor.<eos> My name is George.<eos> We will keep your receipts safe, George.<eos> I know.<eos> Meet us in Bomi.<eos> - If we fail to go ...<eos> - Send books to my grandfather ... in London.<eos> - With your families.
Step right up!<eos> - Peanuts!<eos> Peanuts!<eos> Peanuts here.<eos> - Wow, he scrubs floors and shines shoes!<eos> Hey, Pele, how much for a shine?<eos> - Don't call me that.<eos> - Or what?<eos> - Or you've got problems.<eos> - Who?
That's it.<eos> Try that one.<eos> Good.<eos> Now this one.<eos> - It's way too high.<eos> - Do what comes natural to you.<eos> That's alright.<eos> It'll come.<eos> - No one can kick that high except with the header.<eos> - No, not a header. With your feet.
No 4-3-3, you understand?<eos> If you understand what I'm saying, then you say<eos> "Yes, coach, I'll do it.<eos> Can you say it?<eos> - Yes, coach, I'll do it.<eos> - Eso. Look. You wait for the set, then you release.<eos> If your leg is better, you should go back in.<eos> - It's not my leg.<eos> My head is not right.<eos> - Your head?
"Marry me," you said.<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> What choice did I have?<eos> Homosexuality is a serious crime.<eos> Please, just say...<eos> What do you want?<eos> A list of men in this town who have had sex with other men.<eos> What?<eos> Men who have had sex with younger men.<eos> With boys.
Okay, Sergei, listen to me.<eos> You do exactly as I say.<eos> Da?<eos> Exactly as I say.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Slow down.<eos> What do you sell here in your factory?<eos> What do you make?<eos> The tractor parts.<eos> Tractor parts?
Yes, I have heard.<eos> I've been authorized to offer you a promotion.<eos> In the new state security organization.<eos> And a clear path to a political role, should you want it.<eos> Please.<eos> No, please. I am good standing.<eos> Feels fine.<eos> Vlad malevich.<eos> Pravda labeled him "the werewolf of rostov."<eos> Werewolf?
Yeah, but I'll probably be going home tomorrow, so I won't stay around too long.<eos> - No?<eos> Yeah, me either. - Mmm-mmm.<eos> - Probably gonna get outta here.<eos> But you good otherwise?<eos> - Couldn't be better. Yeah. - Yeah?<eos> - Enjoying this dog and pony show?<eos> - I'm not one for crowds.<eos> - People suck, don't they?<eos> - Yeah, sometimes.
- A Pachamama!<eos> - A Pachamama!<eos> Hey, punch your mama. Punch your mama.<eos> Hola.<eos> I want to... I want to order dinner for four... Four people, please.<eos> Bola pe... Yes, hairy balls, delicious.<eos> It's gonna be funny.<eos> No, just... Just rip the elastic out.<eos> - The what?<eos> - Elastic.
A story started circulating that Pat's candidate's daughter was a coke addict.<eos> The poor girl couldn't take it and committed suicide.<eos> Everyone assumed Jane started the rumor.<eos> Press turned against her and her candidate, and it was over.<eos> Finished.<eos> Oh... That's awful.<eos> At one point in my life, I spent time, six months, in a psychiatric hospital.<eos> Uh, they gave me ECT.<eos> And I have an ongoing battle with depression.<eos> Hypomanic episodes.
Yeah, it's a little bit quiet on this side of the street... but just one block up, things are starting to fill up.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Piggy-corn?<eos> No, Piggy-corn's not my baby.<eos> She's just a doll.<eos> She's half-pig and half-unicorn, see?<eos> She has a little horn. Honk, honk.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> No one.
That's my mom.<eos> Oh, well, the last one was fantastic.<eos> I- - I'm kidding. I don't even know what twerking is.<eos> But I hear it's very popular...<eos> So you taking anyone to the dance?<eos> No. Yeah.<eos> I was thinking about flying solo too.<eos> Hey, we should go together.<eos> Together?<eos> Oh, not like "together" together.
You have any idea how many stories I'd have to write to capture every monster I've created?<eos> I already have carpal tunnel in both hands.<eos> Dad, just listen to him. It's a great idea.<eos> Just one. One story to capture them all.<eos> Hmm, simple.<eos> Just one, one story, with every monster I've ever created.<eos> Brilliant. Really good idea. He's a keeper.<eos> You have a better idea?<eos> Mm-hm, mm-hm.<eos> A much better idea.
I work in the markets so it's important to get an early start.<eos> Not to imply that it's any more important than, say, a Baker or a toll collector.<eos> Those are fine, respectable jobs.<eos> I just mean that I commute.<eos> I catch the 7:15 out of white plains.<eos> It's pretty much the same crowd during the week.<eos> John works the ground crew at Yankee stadium.<eos> The first time we met, he asked what I did, and I told him...<eos> Uh, retail mattresses.<eos> Retail mattresses?
And the national guard guy?<eos> I wanna hold his gun.<eos> I wanna protect my country.<eos> I'm starting to notice things I never saw before.<eos> Well...<eos> Maybe I saw them.<eos> I just wasn't paying attention.<eos> For some reason, everything has become a metaphor.<eos> Metaphor...<eos> Metaphor...
Why the hell are you at our house?<eos> It's my house, okay?<eos> Now go inside, or go home.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> It's okay. Come on.<eos> I was in the neighborhood.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> You know what?<eos> I... I'm with someone.<eos> Carl.
- Seizures?<eos> - Seizures, that's right.<eos> - You get seizures?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You know, I ate some contaminated phenethylamines about 10 years ago, and it totally jacked up my system, you know.<eos> - I thought you said you were in shape?<eos> So the two of them take off on a motorbike and we have no choice but to hitchhike all the way back to San Sebastián.<eos> We go into the first pub, and boom, there they are.<eos> So, six hours later we stumble out to the beach, and Bryson insists on having the pretty girl,<eos> - of course, the redhead.
Hey, hang on.<eos> I'd like to say a few words if you don't mind.<eos> All right.<eos> - I don't want to reach for metaphors, but...<eos> - No, reach, Bryson, reach.<eos> Well, they say the Appalachian Trail is like life.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> You don't know what's ahead, you don't know what's going to happen next, but you give it your best shot.<eos> Your best...<eos> So, on that note...
Unfortunately.<eos> Just like you said, Bryson.<eos> The AT.<eos> You never know what lies ahead.<eos> So it appears.<eos> I promise you, if there was heat, it would be on, honey, all right?<eos> Use the talcum powder, that helps.<eos> Hi.<eos> We'd like a cabin.<eos> Preferably with a private bath.
They couldn't have been sisters.<eos> If you're going to be ugly, you better be funny.<eos> And if you're ugly and you're not funny, you better have money.<eos> And if you're zero for three, you better be slutty. - She was.<eos> - Wait a minute, how did you know that, huh?<eos> Well, actually... Jesus Christ.<eos> Next time you do that, let me know, okay?<eos> It's more fun if it's a surprise.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - You okay?
I'm sorry, a sandwich?<eos> How about I call you loaf?<eos> That work for you? No.<eos> Loaf it is.<eos> Very interesting perspective, Gilly.<eos> There's no marks on it.<eos> Why don't I get an a-plus?<eos> I said it was very interesting, but it's not brilliant.<eos> But give yourself some time. You're new here.<eos> Gilly.
Mr. Randolph?<eos> I'm sorry, miss Gilly, is it suppertime already?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Just a little under the weather,<eos> Who's that?<eos> This was my wonderful wife of 44 years.<eos> When I first met miss Mary, she was a dancer in a burlesque club.<eos> She was a stripper? No.<eos> Exotic dancer.
Messed up bad in Kabul, Afghanistan, broke about 18 bones in two legs.<eos> Lost my gig-<eos> For a year, I waited for scraps like a hungry cat outside a seafood restaurant dumpster.<eos> Finally, I got a crappy second chance.<eos> - At least I was going back to Hawaii.<eos> Just wanted to say hello before we landed.<eos> How you doing?<eos> How's the contractor job going?<eos> Miss the uniform?<eos> Sometimes.
How you doing?<eos> How's the contractor job going?<eos> Miss the uniform?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Heard you popped your balloons in Afghanistan.<eos> Thought you were dead.<eos> I'm excited about this gig.<eos> I'm delivering a blessing on a pedestrian gate.<eos> Only in Hawaii, huh?<eos> - Below the aloha exterior.
Warmest aloha, sir.<eos> Okay, let's talk about Gilcrest.<eos> So finally we meet, right?<eos> This is a great story.<eos> So much paperwork on this guy. A surprising amount of paperwork.<eos> Flirting with Pakistani princesses. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Something with the daughter of Princess Hafa El Yassein.<eos> - He got married and divorced...<eos> - I lived a full life.<eos> ...from a fake heiress.
It's an honor to be here.<eos> It's just a budget thing, Bumpy.<eos> We're combining two bases and moving the pedestrian gate and you can move the bones wherever, not one tibia will be out of place.<eos> We just need a 20-minute blessing.<eos> My people respect you, and they want your approval for the community.<eos> - Carson Welch is-- -Sir--<eos> Your people are crooks.<eos> Children of white missionary that stole our country in 1893. You get it.<eos> Bumpy, mohe, my old friend, this is your nation, but we are in America.<eos> Yeah, under military occupation.
Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah, if you look closely you'll see the entire Middle Eastern conflict on my leg.<eos> Feels like we're in the room with another person.<eos> We are.<eos> I believe everything you say.<eos> Well, you shouldn't. I'm a contractor, nothing more.<eos> Here I am complaining about my sunglasses.<eos> And here I am complaining about nothing.<eos> Come on, let's move!<eos> Morning.
So sexy.<eos> You two will make a good team.<eos> John, you know when and Katherine, you know why someone's about to do something.<eos> Run this through until we come out.<eos> Dr. Clancy, before we go upstairs, with all due respect, I don't hold an ounce of confidence in the paranormal as a field.<eos> I think it's a sham.<eos> I hope that's okay.<eos> No problem at all.<eos> I feel the same about shrinks.<eos> After only one thing, your money.
Not a bad view.<eos> Listen!<eos> Katherine!<eos> Who is Charles Ambrose?<eos> Who is he, really?<eos> - How the fuck's he doing this?<eos> - I know what they'll look for.<eos> Dysfunctional childhood that involved abuse and neglect.<eos> Later on... couldn't hold a job, couldn't keep a relationship.<eos> - Wrong on all counts.
Once you go back, my knowledge ends.<eos> That's as much as Sarah knew.<eos> So no more cheating.<eos> No more cheating.<eos> The time you're going back to, she won't be the warrior that raised me, not yet.<eos> She'll be scared and weak.<eos> She won't know how to fight or defend herself.<eos> Her biggest worry is making rent and tuition.<eos> She's a waitress.<eos> A what?
You didn't tell him.<eos> This can wait.<eos> No, I want to know!<eos> What?<eos> Sarah's my mother, Kyle.<eos> And you're my father.<eos> Why wouldn't you say something? Couldn't.<eos> Not without the risk of changing everything.<eos> You're my son? You...<eos> Our son?
All right, I'm gonna cut right to it.<eos> I have it on very good authority that gennaro angiulo is planning to have you murdered.<eos> Is that so?<eos> And how does he plan to achieve that?<eos> That's the kind of information that my side gets.<eos> And that's the kind of information that we can provide.<eos> John, do you know what I do to rats?<eos> It ain't rattin', Jimmy.<eos> It's an alliance.<eos> An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?

Yeah, you.<eos> With who?<eos> Deborah, sweetheart, you just spent the fucking night in the can.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so, where the fuck did you sleep last night?<eos> - There.<eos> - And what the fuck is that?<eos> Police station.<eos> And who would you be talking to in a goddamn police station, Deborah?<eos> The police?
Yes, he did.<eos> Nick McVeigh is running speed to high schools in Newton.<eos> High school kids, for fuck's sake.<eos> Thank god for whitey bulger.<eos> - Thank god for whitey bulger.<eos> - You hear me?<eos> Whitey introduced dope to every kid in southie.<eos> 12- and 13-year-old girls, John.<eos> What about halloran?<eos> And Callahan, huh?
Please, please, I am the Section Chief.<eos> This is my family.<eos> There must be space.<eos> No space.<eos> This one woman and this small-small children.<eos> - And the little boy? - Yes, him, too.<eos> Where are you thinking this woman and child would be fitted?<eos> They're gonna be sitting in the front with you. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Seventy thousand, no boy.<eos> With the boy.
Who is responsible for bringing this thing?<eos> Strika, is it you that is bringing this thing?<eos> Strika, untie him.<eos> So all of you grown men, it is Strika, the small boy, that is finding this prisoner.<eos> Where is Two-I-C?<eos> Two-I-C! - Two-I-C!<eos> - Two-I-C! Two-I-C!<eos> Commandant, sir!<eos> Two-I-C, what are we to be doing with this thing?<eos> This thing?
Goodblood says this is a token of appreciation...<eos> Yo! What are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry. The Supreme Commander is so very upset to keep you waiting.<eos> Please, will you follow me?<eos> Please sit.<eos> What is this?<eos> - What is this? - He'll be with you shortly.<eos> Huh? Where is the water?<eos> Bring them water, quickly!<eos> Commandant.

Commandant.<eos> Commandant?<eos> Commandant.<eos> I trust you rested well.<eos> I would like you to know we also offered rations and water to the rest of your battalion this morning.<eos> Thank you, Deputy.<eos> Please, gentlemen. Please come over.<eos> Stand there.<eos> Attention!<eos> Commandant.
A song, just like my mother sang.<eos> Someone help us.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Life is sad.<eos> Agu.<eos> Agu.<eos> Sir? Go get me some fucking bullets to be shooting right now. Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Do you have bullet?<eos> Mother.
Remember.<eos> They will just lock you up in jail!<eos> When the time come back, the other ones, they'll come eat you.<eos> Just chop for you...<eos> your heart. Agu, you stay here because they don't...<eos> Halt!<eos> Stop there!<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - NDF, sir!
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend, you are their superior.<eos> Never forget that, never let THEM forget that.<eos> Thank you, son.<eos> Your great-grandfather and a few others created this industry.<eos> Without us, without you, the world plunges into darkness.<eos> I hope to bring honor to the Pollard family name, Sir.<eos> Thou didst, O Lord, create the mighty whale, That wondrous monster of a mighty length;<eos> Beyond conception his unmeasured strength.<eos> But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain that we, poor feeble mortals should engage ourselves, our wives and children to maintain,<eos> This dreadful monster with a martial rage.
- You don't have to do it just because he tells you.<eos> - What choice does she have?<eos> He's not gonna hurt us.<eos> He needs us. - Why?<eos> - To bargain.<eos> - Oh, he'll hurt us alright.<eos> - Think he's coming to the Green Place? - Never!<eos> He's a crazy smeg who eats schlanger!<eos> - Nah, stay out of there.<eos> - Behind you.
Come on.<eos> - Wouldn't wanna shoot the Wives, sir.<eos> - Just probing.<eos> - He wants to help!<eos> - Who? The War Boy!<eos> - Where did he come from?<eos> - I thought we threw him off the Rig!<eos> There's high ground just beyond that thing.<eos> - He means the tree.<eos> - Yeah. Tree!
This is our Furiosa.<eos> How long has it been?<eos> Seven thousand days.<eos> Plus the ones I don't remember.<eos> Furiosa.<eos> What happened to your mother?<eos> She died. On the third day.<eos> - From where did you come?<eos> - The West. Citadel.<eos> Beyond the mountains.
No disrespect, Eazy, 'cause I know you real.<eos> But you, motherfucker, I ain't gonna take that shit from you. 20 years from now, you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.<eos> Nigga, 20 years from now, you still gonna be recording love songs in this dusty-ass garage.<eos> Fuck outta here. Wrap this shit up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. You got it.<eos> No, you got it!<eos> You told me, man. I should've believed you.<eos> What the fuck did you all get from that that you're high-fiving and shit?<eos> Cube.
We take this to the press and we show them what type of intimidation, discrimination, and harassment that we dealing with from our government.<eos> - I like that shit.<eos> - I'm with that. - That's a different thing.<eos> - My nigga, I feel you. - If that's what you wanna do, then we can...<eos> - That's what I wanna do.<eos> That's what we wanna do, Jerry. That's it.<eos> That's what we wanna do.<eos> - You good? I mean...<eos> - Hate to be the bearer of bad news...<eos> - Mmm-hmm.
Twenty... Twenty-three when I last checked, sir.<eos> Well, that's old enough that you ought to know that's not how it works.<eos> Now, you're gonna make an appointment, and then you'll play for him, and if he likes it, you'll play for Judge Hay.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then Judge Hay's likely to tell you to come back when you're hot enough to draw flies.<eos> Well, I just might know how to do that.<eos> Hank, you know Fred Rose?<eos> I know of him.<eos> Roy Acuff's partner.<eos> Among other things.
Well, why don't you be just like you used to be?<eos> How come you find so many faults with me?<eos> Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue<eos> Why don't you love me like you used to do?<eos> I ain't had no lovin' Like a-huggin' and a-kissin' in a long, long while<eos> I just laughed it off.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, girl.<eos> You here with anybody?<eos> Faron Young.
When I grow up... I want to be the first person in human history to teleport himself.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> It's already possible to transport quantum information from one location to another.<eos> Right now, there are supercomputers that can transport quantum information through space. So why not a machine that can send people through space?<eos> Well, even if you could build the thing, which you can't...<eos> I've already built it.<eos> Well, I'm building it. In my garage.<eos> Is it next to your flying car?<eos> I'm not working on that anymore.<eos> Just this now.
I can show it to you. I just need the converter.<eos> All right.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - Yeah. Help.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Your family owns a junkyard?<eos> That place is awesome.<eos> Here. You're stripping the head.<eos> So, uh, who else lives here?<eos> Just my mom and step-dad.
We're tourists, guys. Sorry.<eos> So, what brings you out here?<eos> Oh, work.<eos> So, I'm really just out here. Since I was close, I decided I should come by and do the touristy thing...<eos> You guys have fun. Okay.<eos> All right. Thanks.<eos> Here's a guy with no license plates.<eos> Yeah, you're a tourist. Sure.<eos> That guy is a security guard, huh?<eos> Undercover.
HOW COME YOU GOTTA DO THIS AT 6 A.M.?<eos> WELL, I GOTTA BE AT THE STATION BY 7:30<eos> FOR STONE CRANDALL'S ACCUWEATHER REPORT.<eos> HEY, YOU EVER RIDE ONE OF THESE THINGS?<eos> MM, NO.<eos> NEVER HAVE.<eos> BUT, UH, CAN'T IMAGINE<eos> IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN AN AIRBUS A318.<eos> YEAH, WELL, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.<eos> NOW, THE KEY HERE
WELL, THAT WAS AWFUL.<eos> AT LEAST THE KIDS NEVER WOKE UP.<eos> UH, PASSENGERS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PRANCER<eos> WILL NOTICE THE GRAND CANYON OUT THE WINDOW.<eos> THAT'S RIGHT.<eos> LAST STOP BEFORE WALLEY WORLD.<eos> SO, GUYS,<eos> WHEN WE VISITED THE GRAND CANYON WHEN I WAS A KID,<eos> WE BARELY HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT.<eos> THIS TIME...
LOOK.<eos> -YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT.<eos> -WOW, GRANDPA.<eos> THANK YOU SO MUCH.<eos> -COOL!<eos> -YEAH!<eos> DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH,<eos> BUT THAT'S A VERY SPECIAL GUITAR.<eos> IT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY BOB DILLON.<eos> THEBOBDYLAN?
Thanks.<eos> Hello. I'm home.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was the...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> He won't talk to me. He said he only wants to talk to you.<eos> You want to talk to me?<eos> Really?<eos> You mean me and your mom?<eos> Just me? By myself?
You ride?<eos> Yeah!<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, not anymore.<eos> I did, you know, back in college. I had a...<eos> I had a Kawa-saki? Kawasaki Nine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With the fenders and the...<eos> The broil joint. So...
- What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> One for you, and one for you.<eos> I don't know if that's appropriate.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Okay. Good night.<eos> So, if you want to, why don't you come by tomorrow after school?<eos> Might be a good time to...<eos> What about the cold one?<eos> The cold one?
Thank you.<eos> So, Dusty, how long do you think you're going to be in town for?<eos> Well, Brad, the truth is, I'm wheels-up a week from tomorrow.<eos> Time to get out there and kick some ass for America.<eos> I see.<eos> So you're a soldier?<eos> Nope.<eos> So you're a...<eos> Yep.<eos> Yep, what?
-I'm not your babysitter.<eos> If your appoint makes money for Mark and Sally I'm happy!<eos> OK...<eos> Hey did I hear you're expecting?<eos> Ehh, we're expecting to be expecting...<eos> I'd be upset clearing this out, but we're ..<eos> - That's exciting!<eos> Lump.. in my ball<eos> I'll go in for a scan<eos> -Hmm
Brother, I would sell you as much as you want!<eos> I understand perfectly Bob!<eos> Want the deal?<eos> That's cool, that's alright with me!<eos> He's gone!<eos> don't do that!<eos> Stop, Stop!<eos> Stop that!<eos> -Charlie!<eos> Wooooh!
- It's not worth making you upset.<eos> - It's not.<eos> It really means something that you put all this thought into it and you... you're thinking long-term for us.<eos> That really means something.<eos> Thoughts are the easy part.<eos> Hard part's finding a reason.<eos> It's fine.<eos> There's a lot of projects.<eos> Seems like a... a good dog.<eos> Solid dog.
And being social.<eos> So what's up?<eos> Hanging out with your loser friends?<eos> All right, before you say anything else. I really want to say I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay. Me, too.<eos> I should have been able to think for myself and not listen to those guys.<eos> I mean, I shouldn't have judged you for having awful friends.<eos> Yeah, they're awful.<eos> So how did it go with Brooke after I left?<eos> Who now?
We gotta find cover. Find cover.<eos> They're everywhere!<eos> Just get back. Get back! Move!<eos> - Run! - Stairs!<eos> Go!<eos> Lefs move!<eos> Come on! Lefs go!<eos> Hernandez, go! Come on!<eos> L_et's go!<eos> Right behind you.
Okay. When I was in the Legion, they gave me Protocols for this.<eos> It can be difficult for Terrsies, or people from underdeveloped worlds to hear that their planet is not the only inhabited planet in the Verse.<eos> Has to be the anesthesia.<eos> I mean, it's gotta be a dream.<eos> The Protocol actually says that most Terrsies will say that this has to be a dream.<eos> Yeah, because a dream is the only way any of this makes sense.<eos> Compared to what?<eos> The idea that you're the only intelligent species on the only inhabitable planet in a universe so full of planets you don't have a number to describe how many there are?<eos> Are you saying you're an alien?<eos> Genomgineered human.
- Yes.<eos> - Why me?<eos> Please. This has to be a mistake.<eos> These people don't make those kind of mistakes.<eos> What if I say no? What if I don't go with you? What if I go home?<eos> What? Are they gonna come after me again?<eos> An FTL, my lord.<eos> There was a problem at the clinic.<eos> A former Legionnaire was involved.<eos> A Legionnaire?
-Yeah.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Let's see it.<eos> See what?<eos> Come on.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on... Be glad you didn't get them wet.<eos> I've been looking for these for a while.<eos> These are ancient runes.<eos> They can manipulate weather.<eos> Rain, wind, cold, heat...
So we're negotiating, then?<eos> The Axe and Cross would be bothered that they're no longer in possession of the Queen's heart.<eos> I don't serve The Axe and Cross anymore.<eos> This time I do it for me.<eos> Well, it's about time.<eos> You know, I used to think the universe ran in endless circles, always repeating itself, always predictable.<eos> And now?<eos> I don't know what happens next.<eos> Do you know what we mortals call that?<eos> Living.
I don't think you understand.<eos> It tore the back off my car.<eos> Remind me, Solo.<eos> How long was your prison sentence?<eos> You owe me five more years.<eos> Now, I know you've been taking care of yourself on the side, wetting your beak, so to speak.<eos> We don't pay you enough to be able to put truffles in your Risotto, Solo.<eos> But don't ever make the calamitous error of mistaking my deliberate short-sightedness for blindness.<eos> Now, you report for duty tomorrow morning, 9:00 A.M. sharp.<eos> And with a better attitude.
I know that the equity of aristocratic blood is not appreciated by most communists.<eos> But a good German girl knows never to mix the blood of a racehorse with that of a cart horse.<eos> Uncle Rudi? That's not a very nice thing to say.<eos> Don't be so protective.<eos> I'm sure our weightlifter can defend himself.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So you're a thief.<eos> I like to call myself a specialist in complicated acquisitions.<eos> I hope you wear a mask.<eos> Sometimes.
You're not gonna make it.<eos> Just shut up and watch me work.<eos> Hold on, cowboy.<eos> Keep quiet.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Mr. Deveny's room, please.<eos> Hello?<eos> Gaby...<eos> It's done.<eos> Room 304, please.
Diadema, this is Napoleon Solo.<eos> Hello, Victoria. I suspect that you're already listening, so I'll give you this message directly.<eos> Earlier today, I killed your husband.<eos> We're wasting our time.<eos> This isn't working.<eos> If you could just shut up, thank you very much, captain.<eos> Ramp it up, please, Solo. Come on. I'd like to report that he died honorably, courageously, and selflessly.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> Instead, it was a rather pitiful affair involving tears, begging, and offers to trade anything and, indeed, anyone so that I would spare his life.<eos> Napoleon.
I thought I was losing my mind.<eos> How?<eos> How is this possible?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> I... I, I was normal.<eos> And then one day... I just stopped.<eos> I wanted to tell you so badly, but I couldn't.<eos> You know what they'd do to me, I...<eos> - I would have been a...<eos> - Curiosity.
He knows.<eos> Hey, everybody, I don't wanna ruin the party, but I wanna say something.<eos> First of all, thanks for being here.<eos> Kathy and I are really grateful that you could all be here.<eos> It means a lot to us that you would be here and to help us celebrate the first... first 40 years of our marriage.<eos> When I first met this lovely lady, back in the olden days,<eos> I had a pretty good idea what I wanted to do in my job, but I didn't really... know what I wanted to... be as a man when I grew up, if I ever grew up.<eos> But the commitment that she made... to our marriage and to our family, to me... the... quality of her love... led me to understand that I could have no greater ambition... in life, than to be the best possible husband I could be for her.<eos> So here's to Kathy, love of my life, mate of my soul, mother of my lovely children.<eos> To Kathy.
- Take it easy.<eos> - Get out!<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - Go, get out, get out!<eos> Take it easy!<eos> You okay?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I'm a police officer.<eos> - You're a cop?<eos> - Detective.
- Yeah, thanks.<eos> - Laurel, treatment.<eos> There's one other thing we could try.<eos> What's that?<eos> These guys are terrified of controversy.<eos> If you go to one of their meetings.<eos> You mean, in person, make a speech?<eos> - Make a request. - Laurel.<eos> They have a public meeting every two weeks.<eos> In front of everyone?
Miss Ella.<eos> It's your father, miss.<eos> He took ill on the road.<eos> He's passed on, miss.<eos> He's gone.<eos> To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.<eos> And your mother.<eos> I was to give you this.<eos> But what about my lace?<eos> My parasol?
They loved our house... and now that they're gone, I love it for them.<eos> It's my home.<eos> Hear ye! Hear ye!<eos> Quiet!<eos> "Know,<eos> "on this day, two weeks hence,<eos> "there shall be held, at the palace,<eos> "a Royal Ball.<eos> "At said ball,<eos> "in accordance with ancient custom,
What will he be like, I wonder?<eos> What does it matter what he's like?<eos> He's rich beyond reason.<eos> Wouldn't you like to know a bit about him before you marry him?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> It might change my mind.<eos> I bet you have never ever spoken to a man.<eos> Have you, moon-face?<eos> I have, once.<eos> To a gentleman.
The Lady Tremaine and her daughters.<eos> I'm Drisella.<eos> And I'm Anastasia.<eos> People will want to know. I'm the clever one.<eos> I'm very beautiful.<eos> The very clever Miss Drisella, and the very beautiful Anastasia.<eos> Do come on!<eos> The Lord Veneering.<eos> Who are you looking for?<eos> No one.
Certainly it is, and my father still calls me that, when he's especially un-peeved at me.<eos> But you're no apprentice.<eos> I am.<eos> An apprentice monarch.<eos> Still learning my trade.<eos> Oh, gosh!<eos> Look, please forgive me.<eos> I thought you might treat me differently if you knew.<eos> I mistook you for a good, honest country girl, and now I see you didn't want to overawe a plain soldier.<eos> Little chance of that.
Ella couldn't wait to write down all that had happened, so that she might remember every single bit of it just as if she were telling her mother and father about the palace ball and her time with the prince.<eos> Above all, the prince.<eos> Oh, you've come.<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, Father.<eos> Don't go.<eos> I must.<eos> You needn't be alone.<eos> Take a bride.<eos> The Princess Chelina.
There! You see?<eos> I told you it was no one of any importance.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Miss.<eos> You are requested and required to present yourself to your king.<eos> I forbid you to do this!<eos> And I forbid you to forbid her!<eos> Who are you to stop an officer of the king?<eos> Are you an empress?<eos> A saint?
I told you it was no one of any importance.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Miss.<eos> You are requested and required to present yourself to your king.<eos> I forbid you to do this!<eos> And I forbid you to forbid her!<eos> Who are you to stop an officer of the king?<eos> Are you an empress?<eos> A saint?<eos> A deity?
At that moment, he told me he found God.<eos> And it turns out that God He's a squirrel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A big, old meaty one.<eos> "I found God," he used to say.<eos> "And while sitting there and basking in the glory and sublimity of mercy..." "... I shot and ate that son of a bitch."<eos> Yeah. You might want to close your eyes, kid.<eos> I'm injured.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> A bear.

- I would play "Call of Duty" with her... - Yeah. - ...all night.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> And bang her hard too, to the point of needing helmets.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That too, yeah.<eos> Nope, not me, either.<eos> Shaw's over.<eos> Just Bianca.<eos> That's me.<eos> Martin Van Buren.<eos> Nickelback.
- Who's that?<eos> Shit, there's Señor Gomez.<eos> I'm failing Spanish.<eos> Mini Stalin, dead ahead.<eos> Meet Madison Morgan.<eos> As she would tell you herself, she's the hottest girl in school.<eos> Even the gay guys wanna date her.<eos> I would totally bang the shit out of her.<eos> But I Wouldn't like it.<eos> Love.
What?<eos> Oh, no. "Layman," it's just a phrase. I just mean you're not a fashion expert.<eos> Oh, so I have bad style?<eos> Whoa, someone's in a mood.<eos> Lighten up. Lighten up?<eos> Because I'm so heavy?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Outside.<eos> How could you guys not tell me this whole time that I was your DUFF?<eos> - Our what?
Okay, here's my offer.<eos> I will make sure you pass science if you help me with this.<eos> I mean, you got the easy part.<eos> You could pass science in your sleep.<eos> I have to reverse-DUFF you.<eos> Are you wearing pajamas?<eos> Oh, my God. You know, I get it Wesley, okay?<eos> I'm disgusting.<eos> I'm a swamp thing. - I'm a regular Bela Lugosi.<eos> - Who?
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look, I'm an idiot.<eos> And idiots don't exactly give great advice.<eos> Well, look at it this way. It's not like you could make me any more awkward, right?<eos> That's true.<eos> See?<eos> Idiot.<eos> So you'll do it?<eos> - Yeah. - Yes. On one condition.

It's not like you could make me any more awkward, right?<eos> That's true.<eos> See?<eos> Idiot.<eos> So you'll do it?<eos> - Yeah. - Yes. On one condition.<eos> You gotta ask me in monster voice.<eos> - Wesley. Monster voice?
- Well, irregardless...<eos> - Not a word.<eos> - Well, irregardless of that...<eos> - A little peace offering.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Wes, the dress?<eos> You didn't have to do this.<eos> I never should've called you the DUFF, okay?<eos> That was stupid.<eos> - We good?
Jess and Casey?<eos> Uh, yes, Jess and Casey.<eos> And, um, I don't know, it's, like, my fault pretty much.<eos> I kind of wanna reach out, but I'm not really sure - what I should do about it, and...<eos> - You should talk to them.<eos> I mean, they seem like really caring, understanding people, so...<eos> Sorry, are you friends with them?<eos> Yeah, Jess is in my drama class and I have trig with Casey. Oh, yeah.<eos> I mean, Jess is, like, an amazing actress. - Mm.<eos> - And dancer.
I mean, Jess is, like, an amazing actress. - Mm.<eos> - And dancer.<eos> Mm. - And dresser.<eos> And Casey, she's, like, this, you know, fiery Latina.<eos> Yeah, she's very spicy.<eos> But, you know, I'm not really friends with them right now, so...<eos> Is it intimidating?<eos> What?<eos> Being friends with... And it's rare that I point this out, because I do not subscribe to the American ideal of feminine beauty.<eos> But such powerful women?
Maybe I could finance something for you to star in.<eos> - Have you seen anything I've done?<eos> - Not in complete.<eos> But I've seen that trailer for that new one you got coming out maybe 500 times.<eos> Maybe you wanna finance something for me to star in.<eos> I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.<eos> Oh, hey. You're an actor too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What've you been in?<eos> - Everything.
- But that Ari just wouldn't let me be heard.<eos> - Probably being protective.<eos> He's like that.<eos> Well, I'm just being protective of my money.<eos> I'm like that.<eos> - We understand that.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I know we met before, but what is your involvement in this again?<eos> - I'm the producer of the movie.<eos> - And my manager.
Looks like your bear found Johnny.<eos> Good God almighty!<eos> Lord, have mercy!<eos> Chewed his leg, right off.<eos> It wasn't the bear that killed him, though.<eos> Lookee, there.<eos> He was shot.<eos> I had a bad feelin' when I saw him hangin' out with them guys.<eos> You have anything to do with this, Douglas?<eos> With this?
Recovery almost immediate.<eos> - Bleeding makes me vulnerable. - It does.<eos> But you have no reason to feel concerned.<eos> Unless you are a haemophiliac.<eos> You are not a member of the Russian royal family, are you?<eos> Are you a Romanov?<eos> Europe gave México many things.<eos> And perhaps México gave only one thing back, syphilis.<eos> It was known for a time as the "Mexican disease."<eos> Then as the "Spanish disease."
Is that all right?<eos> Infantile behaviour.<eos> - Something else? - No, thank you, Mercedes.<eos> Gracias, Mercedes.<eos> However, Mercedes, you could put your naked elbow under the shower to test the water temperature.<eos> And, oh... Perhaps you could warm up the lavatory seat for me again.<eos> Take your knickers down, sit on the seat the wrong way around, take a pee, and wriggle around a bit.<eos> Do you really want me to translate that?<eos> Was that wise? Wise?<eos> Wisdom?
Until she dumped me for a Rastafarian.<eos> My parents practically disowned me.<eos> I got a job bar-backing at The Void on Ludman Street,<eos> But every night I dreamed that I'd be spinning all over the world,<eos> Berlin, Amsterdam, London.<eos> But I never get there until I saved enough to buy a Serato Scratch.<eos> Then, I'd be legit.<eos> So to get back to the girl, there's a few more people along the way.<eos> But there is no need to remember them all, except for this guy...<eos> Amir.
- You gotta wave your hand?<eos> - That's right. Isn't he great?<eos> I love you. I love you so much.<eos> - Dennis, keep out of this.<eos> - But you are great, Neil.<eos> - You can do anything.<eos> - Dennis, shut up.<eos> I'm not... Master!<eos> Made your mind up yet?<eos> - How about tonight?
Yep. That's me. Little brother Ben.<eos> Hey, Jeff!<eos> All right, well. Sorry about that face again.<eos> Are you going to the party tonight?<eos> What's up?<eos> Yo! Aber-blow-me and Bitch, man.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Always coming up with good ones.<eos> Listen, I was just talking to Carver here, and...<eos> Carter.
What are you doing?<eos> It's a sheet bend knot.<eos> -it's impossible to break.<eos> -You're pretty handy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Get out.<eos> Nice legs.<eos> Costume party?<eos> No, I'm._. I'm a Scout.<eos> Like an actual Scout?
Please shh..<eos> Take back tipper.<eos> Take back tipper.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Take back tipper.<eos> Take back tipper.<eos> Megan from Canada.<eos> I'm just a simple de nada.<eos> Oh, Cash.
I'm just a simple de nada.<eos> Oh, Cash.<eos> I could change<eos> All my calendars, if your smile walk in on me.<eos> Megan from Canada, everyone.<eos> Hey, they can be a tough crowd.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're gonna be a nickel.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Totem pole.
More like solitary confinement.<eos> Wow.<eos> CANRA really does suck.<eos> I was never really given the chance to figure out what I want.<eos> Practically I have to fake my own death just to get out of there.<eos> Well.<eos> I mean at least you stood up for yourself.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Cos sometimes I wish I had a way out.<eos> A way out, of here?
Hey, you serious?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's because me and my old man.<eos> He's just this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore.<eos> You got to be number one.<eos> I wouldn't tolerate any losers in this family.<eos> Your intensity is for shit.<eos> Win, win, win.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> Sometimes.
I remember how much trouble you had learning to pronounce "café olé", and then you tried it out on that waiter in Montmartre.<eos> He couldn't understand you.<eos> Then he smacked his head and said: Oh! Café crem!<eos> Cooperation is impossible.<eos> - Sorry, his remarks on this are great.<eos> - Remarks on what?<eos> -On the two of us.<eos> Do you understand that I'm trying to have a normal dialogue with you? And you're here repeating things after a parrot! You're a parrot.<eos> - And you're a whore!<eos> - Right! A whore and a parrot.
- Yeah he's a Czech.<eos> What did you think?<eos> "I'm crazy about Hitler". That is what was heard at a press conference yesterday with a parrot that once belonged to Edouard Daladier.<eos> "Sir P", now probably the most famous animal in the Czech Republic, has said a variety unflattering things about Czechs and the Czech nation, some that cannot even be broadcast.<eos> A compilation of the elderly bird's phrases will soon be released in book form entitled "Another Several Sentences".<eos> Laura, my dear!<eos> How are you?<eos> Philip, what on earth are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> - The parrot!
What are you doing here?<eos> We're waiting for Jean-Louis Trintignant.<eos> - Trintignant!<eos> - Trintignant. A famous French actor.<eos> He's 85, but he's in great shape and he's agreed to be in the film.<eos> He'll be arriving soon for dress rehearsals.<eos> - Who is he playing in the film?<eos> - The former assistant of Edouard Daladier<eos> -during his prime ministership.<eos> - Before the war.
Don't you have a heart?<eos> I wish I'd never remembered.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Yasuko?<eos> May I shake your hand?<eos> You must come over.<eos> Promise me.<eos> You will?<eos> Mio, where's the bankbook?<eos> The box back there.
It's the only way to keep my program running like it's supposed to.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> And then I go to bed.<eos> My mom has no computer or Internet access to tempt me into the night.<eos> All that's left for me is just ordinary analog sleep ending the day's loop.<eos> You might not think it's a way to live, but why not?<eos> Repeating the same tasks each day without ever having to think about them, isn't that what everybody does?<eos> Keep things on repeat to go along with their "NCISes" and Lexapro.<eos> Isn't that where it's comfortable?<eos> In the sameness?
- How is she ?<eos> - Miserable, back with her parents.<eos> Her husband's having an affair with a girl their daughter's age...<eos> - It'll take time to get over it.<eos> - She's nearing menopause, almost 50.<eos> - She'll never get over it.<eos> - I have lots of patients like her.<eos> See ?<eos> - Did you know about it ?<eos> - About what ?

It's rude to keep phones on the table while eating.<eos> - Yes, Diego always switched his off.<eos> - Lele leaves his face down.<eos> - What ?<eos> - You leave it face down.<eos> Think I haven't noticed ?<eos> It's not intentional.<eos> I pull out my phone and place it down.<eos> Ifyou scratch the screen it costs 200 euros to replace it.<eos> - 50 in Chinatown.
- Answer it.<eos> - Put it on speaker.<eos> - Hi, Marta.<eos> - Peppe, the speaker.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Careful, you're on speaker.<eos> - That's not fair !<eos> - Speaker ?
- Have you heard of it ?<eos> I haven't.<eos> - On a full stomach.<eos> - I swapped our phones.<eos> - Are you sure ?<eos> - Huh ?<eos> - Are we sure ?<eos> - Don't bust my balls.<eos> Why didn't you tell me ?<eos> - What ?
- Confession.<eos> - I have sinned!<eos> One more time?<eos> What? From the beginning?<eos> One more time.<eos> We heard their confessions all night.<eos> Even though we could not always be sure what was being confessed<eos> And now Christianity brought love. The dignity for the first time of being treated like God's creatures, not animals And the promise that all their suffering would not end in nothingness.<eos> We offer mass in the dead of night. Just as they did in the catacombs.<eos> Quietly.

- No one should die.<eos> - No, but we will be in danger. Whether you go or stay.<eos> Stay. Stay.<eos> We will never surrender you.<eos> But they'll keep coming if we stay.<eos> They could destroy the entire village and kill you all while we hide.<eos> Yes, we have no choice, Mokichi, it's the only thing to do.<eos> This would draw the danger away from you.<eos> We can hide on Kichijiro's island.<eos> My island?
Do not speak like a good priest.<eos> If you are a real man, a truly good priest. You should feel pity for the Christian.<eos> Isn't that so, Padre, isn't that so?<eos> The price for your glory is their suffering.<eos> Padre? Praise be to God our Father.<eos> Praise be to Him.<eos> The Portuguese language was a gift of your Father Cabral.<eos> I've been asked to interpret on your behalf.<eos> There was concern that we might need certain subtleties in your testimony if you were told to speak only in Japanese.<eos> - The testimony, I?
I was your son. Your son who (? ) the cross.<eos> The silent given to him.<eos> Is this island cold?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Ludicrous.<eos> Stupid.<eos> He's not going to answer.<eos> He's not going to answer.<eos> Do you want me to let you in?<eos> In time.
Tell him.<eos> It means deceit, disclosed or unmasked, if you prefer a more (?<eos> ) reading.<eos> There's also the Inquisitor, he praises it, he says it is well done.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> - You use the truth like poison.<eos> What a funny thing for a priest to say.<eos> Worse than any torture to twist a man's soul in this way.<eos> I think you must speaking of yourself, not of Sawan Ochuan.<eos> Who?

We say. I'm sorry, you haven't learned the language though really, have you?<eos> There is a saying here, mountains and rivers can be moved.<eos> But man's nature can not be moved.<eos> It's very wise, like so much here.<eos> We find our original nature in Japan, Rodriguez.<eos> Perhaps this was meant by finding God.<eos> You're a disgrace.<eos> You're a disgrace, Father.<eos> I can't. I can't even call you that anymore.<eos> Good.
Oh, come on.<eos> Because, like, you didn't force me to leave, so I should...?<eos> Why do you think I asked you to leave?<eos> You said I didn't belong.<eos> So, I don't know, was I not cool enough or...?<eos> Who exactly are you, anyway?<eos> Are you, like, in charge or...?<eos> Why do you think not belonging is such a bad thing?<eos> - Isn't that the whole point?<eos> - Whole point of what?
Does everyone else feel it?<eos> It's floating. Somewhere... over there.<eos> Over Kyle. Near the ceiling.<eos> Oh. It's a wave of pure white light.<eos> Breathe it in.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Something's not right. I feel like it wants to hurt me.<eos> Like it's inside of me, touching me with it's...<eos> Oh, God, who brought this thing in here?<eos> You okay?
The subtle nuance of client management used to be your best weapon.<eos> Now you're trying to blow up Ricky's day, settle old scores on TV.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> - Hey, Sizzle had it coming.<eos> - You don't actually believe that.<eos> He's been talking shit for years.<eos> Exactly, he was talking trash.<eos> You went after him like a mad dog.<eos> Have you ever heard of transference?<eos> - Only in banking.
Hello.<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Is our baby asleep?<eos> I'd like to hear his voice.<eos> Let's go for drinks?<eos> Not today.<eos> I'm heading home.<eos> Another time perhaps.<eos> Next time then.
Pim will take you so you don't get lost.<eos> - Pim, take care of him.<eos> - Yes sir<eos> I must go.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> Bye Professor.<eos> - Ping?<eos> - It's like this, "Pim".<eos> - Pim, what year are you?<eos> - Second year.
Yes, it was interesting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It has been so long.<eos> All of a sudden I'm at a loss for words.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Pim.<eos> I left you the message.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What year are you in?<eos> Second year.
We do hope it will not involve another retreat.<eos> No.<eos> During your patrols of Long Island, did you ever come across a fellow by the name of Samuel Culper?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Well, according to the personal notes of Major Benjamin Tallmadge... you do remember that name, don't you?<eos> Most definitely.<eos> A small but effective spy ring has been operating right under our nose, smuggling intelligence across the sound.<eos> So, Tallmadge is running a man inside New York.<eos> Or Long Island.
And though they miss you dreadfully, they know you are doing everything you can to ensure the brightest future possible."<eos> Mr. Goodrich, I don't know what else to tell you.<eos> - Just listen to us, Edward.<eos> - What can I possibly do?<eos> Speak to him. Speak reason to him.<eos> Benedict Arnold is military commandant of Philadelphia and he is the highest power in this city.<eos> We can no longer tolerate this, Edward.<eos> Arnold uses his station to line his own pockets at the expense of our interests.<eos> - Your interests?<eos> - Yours as well.
I have Snyder alone at the Yonk.<eos> Will just went to call for help.<eos> There is no time. Come quickly.<eos> You grew up in the South?<eos> I grew up all over.<eos> I spent a lot of time there, though. Navy brat.<eos> Must have made your father happy... your marrying into the military.<eos> You should ask my Navy captain father how he felt about me marrying an enlisted Army grunt.<eos> Where does your family live now?<eos> New Orleans...
Back here. The Authority is currently looking for everything from manual laborers to people with specialized skills.<eos> We gotta talk.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Quayle ordered me to take out Katie. Oh.<eos> I took her up to Griffith Park, but...<eos> Quayle thinks she's a double agent.<eos> I think he's wrong.<eos> This is a problem.<eos> Do you believe in him?<eos> Quayle?
Does that help?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I think it does.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Found it.<eos> I cross-indexed all the I.D.s with credit card payments made to home improvement stores in LA.<eos> A few months before the Arrival, Home Depot delivered a bunch of building supplies to that address in Hancock Park.<eos> - Who lived in the house?<eos> - Harriet Broussard. She died during the Arrival.<eos> She had a son who enlisted in the Marines.<eos> Force Recon.
Look, you've always been a good supporter, Josh.<eos> You know, always been looking for ways to show my appreciation.<eos> But this one's major league, mate.<eos> We're talking a few hundred million dollars worth of gold, probably more.<eos> I just need to know if we can count on ya.<eos> Looks like a lot of trees there, Johnny.<eos> Oh, mate, that's just for starters.<eos> How about... how about i look after it for ya since it's, you know, it's your first time and all.<eos> Look, I better get back to it.<eos> All right. Yeah.
Clever girl.<eos> What do you really want, Mr. policeman?<eos> Need to know what's going on out here.<eos> What do you think is going on?<eos> Not too sure yet.<eos> The truth can be hard to find out here, especially once the sun goes down.<eos> And when you find the truth, what will you do about it?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I got some information.<eos> About what?
Ya ever loved anyone?<eos> What do you reckon?<eos> I reckon you're too gutless to do a lot of things.<eos> It's probably one of 'em.<eos> Just end in a big fuckin' mess anyway.<eos> I reckon I'll just bypass it.<eos> Yeah, why not bypass the whole fuckin' thing?<eos> But you already thought about that more than once.<eos> Pulling that glock out of your holster and popping it in your mouth.<eos> Out here, all on your lonesome.
What do you wanna do, Tommy?<eos> I wanna clean the dust away.<eos> Make it shine again.<eos> I wanna make a statement.<eos> How long's this been goin' on?<eos> You gotta sign the papers, film people... Tommy, how much?<eos> The man, he wants some money if you don't sign the paper...<eos> Tommy, what happened with old Jimmy?<eos> I grab him and I put the rope around him, took him, and I lift him up.<eos> All right.
Make it nice and fuckin' big.<eos> Nothin' personal, joshy.<eos> Just business.<eos> Hands on your head.<eos> Are you sure you wanna do this?<eos> Where are they? Who?<eos> The girls.<eos> The laundry.<eos> Get on the ground! Get on the ground now!<eos> On the ground!
Mr. Kono?<eos> Are you alright?<eos> This one's mental.<eos> Take him away. Watch out.<eos> Mr. Kono.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Stop it, now.<eos> You'll kill him.<eos> Wake up.<eos> - You okay?
No, not that.<eos> He never stopped fighting with others.<eos> He's 18 years old.<eos> We carry the portable shrine at 18.<eos> You know... Troublemakers must leave the town.<eos> So I told him straight.<eos> "Suit yourself."<eos> So, you saw which one did it.<eos> The dead guy ran over the man.<eos> But then...
I promise you can trust me.<eos> At the risk of sounding too forward, I need you to put a ring on this finger.<eos> A family reunion is in order.<eos> Kol, about your family...<eos> I'm pretty sure Klaus wants me dead.<eos> Morning.<eos> O-negative and tequila.<eos> For when you wake up all kinds of wrong.<eos> Looks like I missed one hell of a party.<eos> At my loft.
- Of course not.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can't prove all of the white oak was destroyed, and you can't live in fear of something that might not even be there.<eos> I despise feeling so helpless.<eos> A few decades ago, in the midst of his incessant pursuit of me,<eos> Mikael disappeared without a trace.<eos> No witch could locate him.<eos> Of course, I lived as though he lurked around every corner, until one day, I, too, disappeared.<eos> Just cut all ties and vanished.<eos> And Elijah?
It was Gaspar Cortez.<eos> I assume this is someone from your box of letters.<eos> The youngest son of a particularly vile family of warlords I dealt with in the 17th century.<eos> Didn't they burn that philistine pigsty into the ground?<eos> Pigsty?<eos> Belaga was my favorite artist retreat.<eos> Someone had to pay for that, so I murdered Gaspar's brute of a father.<eos> - And?<eos> - And one or two...<eos> - Five.
I've been lying to myself, trying to hold on.<eos> But the part of me that loved you, the part of me that hoped for your redemption...<eos> That part was human.<eos> And it's gone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Everything okay with your family?<eos> Course not.<eos> Don't they need you?<eos> Desperately. But for the moment, they'll be fine.<eos> And in the meantime,
Gentlemen.<eos> Am I interrupting something?<eos> NOPD!<eos> Freeze! Hands up!<eos> All right!<eos> Psycho slumber party's over.<eos> We got reports of health code violations, animal cruelty, and felony creepiness.<eos> Good luck pleading out of that.<eos> Get them out of here.<eos> You all right, man?
They couldn't get to me, so they're making him lose control.<eos> There are two vials of serum, and he only drank one.<eos> He made enough for two.<eos> Aurora.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Enjoying yourself, luv?<eos> I feel like a brand-new woman.<eos> What a lovely choice of words.<eos> This setting reminds me of the time we were in Paris.<eos> 1903?
So I'll take her.<eos> So you'll arrest Yeon and reap the glory yourself?<eos> What?<eos> Then you go that way, I'll head to the back.<eos> But are they really here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You've been exposed.<eos> Where's Yeon?<eos> Is she with the foreigner?<eos> Yes, with Ludvik in first class.
That school bus.<eos> We're thinking about having children.<eos> Well we're trying.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Have you started smoking again?<eos> - No, that's his thing.<eos> It's getting colder outside.<eos> We need more wool tomorrow.<eos> Yes.<eos> All good?
I see.<eos> - It looks good on you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Don't think it's shockproof though.<eos> Who cares?<eos> It looks cool.<eos> Come on. Let's move on.<eos> Did he startle you?<eos> No.<eos> All good?
We're almost there, Viktor.<eos> Just a little further.<eos> I'm through!<eos> Just a few metres left.<eos> Just keep at it Viktor.<eos> Almost there.<eos> My back is soaked.<eos> Only your back?<eos> Pig.<eos> Not there.
I should be nearby.<eos> Can you meet me?<eos> Are you at the same place?<eos> Hello?<eos> There's more people down here.<eos> The plan went wrong dad.<eos> Just come and get me, and we'll clean up the mess.<eos> Just come and get me dad. I'm alone.<eos> Yes, I found the river.<eos> Down by the river, right?
Oh, yeah?<eos> Prove it.<eos> Satisfied?<eos> So, what's up?<eos> Asa hasn't been returning my calls.<eos> - You know where he is?<eos> - Am I your brother's keeper?<eos> You know what?<eos> - I know.<eos> - About? The pharmacy.
losing the little one, she gonna drift away.<eos> She gonna make mistakes.<eos> She gonna cry, then come back.<eos> You just take care of her.<eos> And I would keep my eye on that lostie for you.<eos> Now, listeners,<eos> I want you to ask yourself, in this economy of the elitists, are you an elitist?<eos> Because I... I am sure as hell not.<eos> Now we can talk about the U.S.' constant dabbling<eos> - in rape and global genocide...
'Cause my sister-in-law has terrible spinal issues, so I know all about it...<eos> The constricted pupils, the fatigue.<eos> Oxycontin, isn't it?<eos> It is written all over his face, the poor guy.<eos> Here's the deal. I like you people.<eos> I do.<eos> You got our best interest in mind.<eos> But you're not gonna come in here and tell me how to run my county.<eos> - Understood?<eos> - Oh, 100%.
Yeah. What is it, fa?<eos> Now, you...<eos> You care about this family more than anyone on this mountain.<eos> - Yeah. - Right? And I Cherish that.<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> I got no one else to go to.<eos> I-I can't help you, fa.<eos> I just need one thing.<eos> How many of y'all are up there?<eos> 60?
He's never had much luck with money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How'd you think he lost those fingers?<eos> I mean, we got some pretty severe rules up there.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Look...<eos> You seem like a real nice girl, but you really gotta look out for yourself.<eos> You understand?<eos> You gotta look out for him, too, 'cause he's new to all of this.<eos> New to all what?
Well, I know it may not interest you, but I was thinking it might Sally-Ann.<eos> She could use a-a new home, don't you think?<eos> So, what, you just gonna let us live in that house right there?<eos> It comes free with the job, yes.<eos> - Which is what?<eos> - Liaison.<eos> - Between?<eos> - Between you and your family.<eos> All you would have to do is spread the word between you and your kin up on your hill.<eos> Word about what?
The thing I liked More than the taste, though... That color.<eos> You got a lot of foods Down here that color?<eos> No.<eos> Thank god.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mmhmm, welcome.<eos> You taste good.<eos> So... What's it like up there?<eos> Folks around here, they... They tell all kind of tales About the mountain.<eos> Stuff about ghosts and... 3-headed bears?
You gotta think about Your family.<eos> Next time I see you, We're gonna take this badge off And we're gonna see How things end up for you.<eos> Over here, amigo.<eos> Where'd you get bail money?<eos> The guys for sure Didn't have it, So I went to see your boss, That miss grimes girl.<eos> - you seen pat or jake?<eos> - yeah.<eos> I wanted to go up there With them, But they wouldn't let me.<eos> They said I 'd slow 'em down. Where?<eos> Up on shay?

Where?<eos> Up on shay?<eos> They got them A bunch of kerosene.<eos> Say they aim to roast up Some farrell.<eos> How long ago they leave?<eos> Well, the crack of dawn.
You? Oh, anxious, I'd say.<eos> Concerned about the life and Liberty of our people.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Yeah, it's kind of hard to miss, ain't it?<eos> Sounds like they're working double time.<eos> Sounds like the clock is ticking away, and here you are fiddling with your toenails.<eos> I have a plan, Foster.<eos> You know, good things don't happen overnight.<eos> Oh, but they can...<eos> As in now.
Though, why did he pick this place for you?<eos> For that money you could've bought a house in the village.<eos> Not far from us, by the cemetery.<eos> - We don't want to live in a cemetery.<eos> - Right.<eos> Who would want to live in a cemetery, right?<eos> - This is where I'll go to school?<eos> - You want to go to school?<eos> - You still have a month's vacation.<eos> - No, not now! In September.
- Five thousand.<eos> - That's crazy. - Cheese, mustard and ketchup, please.<eos> - Guests first. Tony, what do you want?<eos> I'll have avocados, tomatoes, onions, cheese and ketchup.<eos> Yeah, that's on the low end.<eos> - What's the number now? - Eleven hundred.<eos> For eight years? Never an increase?<eos> Maybe we can talk about this a little later.<eos> Tony, did I hear your father lives in Africa?<eos> Yeah, in Angola.
- What are we gonna do?<eos> Okay, get County Mountie on the blower.<eos> I'm gonna drop back and follow 'em.<eos> Breaker 1-9, 10-37 in progress.<eos> We've got a situation on route 7.<eos> Bring it back.<eos> Man: That's a big 10-4, Ginger Drapes.<eos> ♪ I just don't think we should make any rash decisions on an empty stomach, okay?<eos> You know, let's stop and get a bite to eat<eos> - at an actual restaurant...
I'm on kevin's facebook page now.<eos> People are already saying things.<eos> Stop reading that.<eos> wha-- it's been online, What, two minutes, and people are already talking?<eos> Stop reading!<eos> I'm here.<eos> i'm at the school.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Okay? yeah.
So he can get drunk at parties, rape girls?<eos> Eric's grades are good.<eos> He's doing great on the team.<eos> Well, i heard him talking on the phone.<eos> It was "bitch" this, "whore" that.<eos> I-i don't even know him anymore.<eos> He's a teenaged boy --<eos> Stop making excuses for him.<eos> He's been different ever since he started going there.<eos> Okay.

"well-intentioned, but a little too socially indulgent."<eos> Well, if i'm indulgent, she's...<eos> I know she's your friend.<eos> She's our superintendent.<eos> Her perspective doesn't reflect new realities.<eos> Look, things got heated in the district meeting --<eos> You don't have to apologize.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm just saying, this is an opportunity For us to talk one on one.<eos> Okay.
I'm just trying to help you see yours.<eos> That doesn't make me japanese.<eos> If we don't get ourselves together, We don't quit this infighting, they're gonna charter us.<eos> Everything's an agenda?<eos> Are they busting the union or not?<eos> Are they gutting education?<eos> Don't give them excuses.<eos> I can't talk about this.<eos> I -- i don't want to talk about this.<eos> Okay.
Did you think this was gonna be social?<eos> Sure, i -- yeah.<eos> I'm actually hungry.<eos> So, what's good?<eos> The tofu sandwich is pretty good. I don't eat tofu.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's nikki.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?
I come up positive in the middle of all this?<eos> Yeah, i know.<eos> There used to be signs.<eos> You know, you would -- You would put on your corny music or roll a joint Or there'd be a bottle of red.<eos> Have the signs changed, or am i missing them?<eos> Things change, yeah.<eos> But you still got it.<eos> Well, i'm going up to bed.<eos> I'll probably be up for a while.<eos> Okay.
She made her choice.<eos> The case is being worked outside of my division, So i don't have a whole lot of info.<eos> On the sexual assault, The blood work came back negative.<eos> There were no traces of ghb in his bloodstream.<eos> "his"?<eos> Kevin's?<eos> The person making the sexual-assault claim is a boy --<eos> The same boy that was hazed.<eos> The boy's saying he was raped?<eos> What, like, gang rape?
Seo Dae Yeong, stop right there.<eos> Sergeant Major Seo Dae Yeong.<eos> How can you leave without saluting to your superior?<eos> - Try to place your hands...<eos> - I will make through this.<eos> I was told that this was romance.<eos> What kind of romance is this?<eos> Director, the temperature of the water is different, is it all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.
They ran so hard their faces moved.<eos> They're so good.<eos> They didn't mess anything up.<eos> Even when they ate the chicken.<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - What?<eos> Answer at the same time.<eos> Is she on your left or right?<eos> - Left.<eos> - Right.
They're so good.<eos> They didn't mess anything up.<eos> Even when they ate the chicken.<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - What?<eos> Answer at the same time.<eos> Is she on your left or right?<eos> - Left.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Right.
Haven't you caught it before?<eos> It's a cold.<eos> These two are funny off the screen as well.<eos> - Yes, you fool.<eos> - They're sweet together.<eos> It's a cold.<eos> I was worried.<eos> - We are great men<eos> - We are great men<eos> Gosh. No way.
- Casually.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Can I do it another way?<eos> Two, three.<eos> That's Medicube.<eos> That's where we'll stay. I wanted there to be a dilapidated cathedral, but we needed to be able to fit a lot of people around it. It's hard to film everything abroad... because it just gets too expensive.<eos> The set took 50 days to build.<eos> Descendants of he Sun with Sergeant Major Seo...<eos> - No.<eos> - in Taebaek.
Who's the sulky woman, and who's the unbelieving woman?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> Just use the full shot. It wasn't supposed to be that place. It was that area, where the field turned from green to gold from time to time.<eos> But it was set on fire and became all black.<eos> So we went to find another place the day before our shooting.<eos> - Is this how you do it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Is this how you do it?<eos> - My gosh.
- I know it is essential to complete the Master's plan and, as such, he will do whatever it takes to get it back.<eos> Without Eichhorst, the Master has to retrieve it himself...<eos> You want to know who the Master is?<eos> Get your team together as soon as possible and be ready to ambush him at Stoneheart.<eos> He'll be coming for my throat.<eos> You're playing a very dangerous game, Eldritch.<eos> No other choice, Abraham.<eos> One final spin of the wheel.<eos> Now, this is the end game for both of us. One way or the other.<eos> Master. Ah!
- Most, but not all.<eos> There were four or five incidents that may have been coordinated.<eos> Proxy, can we talk to you in private?<eos> Why all the secrecy?<eos> We think a new cell might have set up operations outside the colony.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> We have a reliable CI that says it is.<eos> His cousin signed up with someone offering cash and weapons to anyone willing to fight the Occupation in the LA bloc.<eos> He said he went to meet a guy at the old Commerce building downtown.<eos> Downtown?
There's no coming back from it.<eos> I know.<eos> That guy's money's no good here.<eos> When did you get here?<eos> ♪ I keep my left hand ♪ Remember back when we lived in that stucco box at Fort Hood?<eos> How we talked about getting a ranch up in the mountains, leaving the grid, living out in nature?<eos> Hunting, fishing.<eos> I think I remember you promising me my own horse.<eos> You ever think about that anymore?<eos> - The mountains?
But I'm not gonna take the drugs.<eos> I don't like the way they make me feel, baby.<eos> They stabilize you.<eos> I don't wanna be stabilized.<eos> I wanna feel free, really free.<eos> You can understand that.<eos> Yeah I do, Nina.<eos> I do.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.
She can do 10 songs.<eos> It's 14, it's 14 songs.<eos> Clifton, is that your name?<eos> Clifton: Yeah.<eos> Don't even pretend you have the balls to stand up to me.<eos> Or to her.<eos> You take the playlist, you put it on the piano, you put her in front of the piano, you tell the band to shut the fuck up.<eos> What you don't understand is she needs this gig.<eos> Don't blow it for her.<eos> Okay?
To friends.<eos> Guests: Cheers.<eos> And to gatherings.<eos> I only got water.<eos> It's okay, you can toast with whatever you want, baby.<eos> You're with me.<eos> Nina Simone.<eos> Merci, Merci.<eos> I'm shy.<eos> All right.
Clifton!<eos> Clifton.<eos> Nina: Hello?<eos> Cousier: Nina, it's doctor Cousier.<eos> I've called you several times over the last few months and...<eos> You need to know.<eos> The results of the biopsy are serious.<eos> We need to do something about it.<eos> We need to do it soon.<eos> Okay.
I had a thought.<eos> I was thinking about her going back home to the states and doing a free concert in central park.<eos> Bring the people back to her.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Henri: Central park?<eos> Who do you think she is, Barbra Streisand?<eos> Why not?<eos> Are you sleeping with her?<eos> No.<eos> All right.
- Okay.<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you too.<eos> - I hope it good to be seen.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> Yes, yes, wanna start?<eos> Man: Miss Simone.<eos> Need anything?<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> - All right.
You were great tonight.<eos> It was fun.<eos> So much fun.<eos> Dance with me.<eos> What?<eos> You wouldn't swim with me, dance with me.<eos> ...What, here?<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.
And watch you get torn up.<eos> I'm sentimental, Leslie.<eos> I shouldn't have to beg you to marry me.<eos> Are you excited to be back at Marshall?<eos> I guess, yeah.<eos> Principal Dixon said you had some problems over at Leyland? Yeah.<eos> He said your mother had some concerns about you...<eos> I don't really want to talk about this.<eos> My mom... she...<eos> - Okay. Okay.
Captain, we've arrived at 2147.<eos> Thank you, Gideon.<eos> Set a course for the Kasnian Conglomerate.<eos> 150 years in the future and people are still wearing wool?<eos> Man, I hate wool.<eos> Be grateful, Mr. Jackson.<eos> Those living outside the Kasnian Conglomerate are dressed in rags.<eos> Conglomerate?<eos> Yes, in the year 2080, government began to give way to corporations.<eos> More like 2008.
So how are your studies progressing?<eos> He's a teacher.<eos> Tutor, it would seem, to young Per Degaton himself.<eos> You say that like it's supposed to mean something.<eos> After the death of his father in five year's time,<eos> Per Degaton unleashes the Armageddon Virus, which decimates the world's population, leaving it ripe for conquest.<eos> Per Degaton primes the world for dictatorship, and then when the time is right...<eos> Savage snatches that power away from him.<eos> By killing Per Degaton.<eos> Indeed.
We already know what pushes this punk to the dark side:<eos> Savage.<eos> Look, it's not the kid's fault he's got an immortal psychopath as his tutor.<eos> If we don't kill the kid now, Savage will as soon as he's done using him to take over the world.<eos> If he doesn't build him into the greatest tyrant the world has ever known,<eos> Savage can't become the last tyrant the world will ever know.<eos> Murdering a child in cold blood just like Savage murdered your own son.<eos> What's the use in saving the world if we stoop to his methods to do so?<eos> I'm with Professor Stein.<eos> Okay, fine.
It's time that he knew.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can you keep a secret, Aldus?<eos> There's something...special about your mommy and daddy.<eos> We've known each other for a very, very long time and loved one another since the day we met.<eos> I already know that story.<eos> You know part of that story.<eos> Have you ever heard of a place called Egypt?<eos> Well, it all began during the rule of Ramses II, when late one night a big, magical meteor smashed into the Temple of Horus, the hawk-god.<eos> Hey, you okay?
In fact, the virus, which wasn't supposed to be unleashed upon the world for another five years...<eos> I'm sorry, Father.<eos> Will now be released in a matter of days.<eos> As you all know, our former chairman's chair is in the Conglomerate passed to his son, who due to his age elected me to act as his proxy.<eos> First order of business,<eos> I would like to revisit our discussion concerning the population crisis beyond the Conglomerate's borders.<eos> As we all know, we already have a solution.<eos> Did I do the right thing, Gideon?<eos> Not committing murder is generally considered the right thing, Captain.<eos> In this instance...
Quick.<eos> Come.<eos> The stage door gives out onto the laneway.<eos> Here. There's food.<eos> You think you'd have the decency to keep your murderous fingers off my lunch.<eos> All the decayed ruins in this town and you bring me to hers?<eos> I did warn you.<eos> It's a real nice place you got here, Hermione.<eos> beast lies dead.<eos> All right.
He fumigated. Hard work.<eos> It's all he could get after the war.<eos> You know, curse of a soldier.<eos> Ain't that the truth.<eos> Yeah. You serve?<eos> 'Nam, 3rd Marine Division.<eos> Fighting 3rd, huh?<eos> Goddamn right.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah, yeah. Iraq, Afghanistan.
- Not even for a second.<eos> Really?<eos> Really? You never think for one second,<eos> "Shit, I just killed a human being."<eos> That's being pretty generous.<eos> A human being who did a lot of stupid shit, maybe even evil, but had one small piece of goodness in him.<eos> Maybe just a scrap, Frank, but something.<eos> And then you come along, and that one tiny flicker of light gets snuffed out forever.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> - Which part?
I had no choice.<eos> Old lady left a husband.<eos> Dead man, wife and kids.<eos> You gotta understand me. I had to do it.<eos> You still think this piece of shit is worth saving?<eos> I'm not gonna shoot him.<eos> I will if you don't kill me first.<eos> Not here.<eos> And he's not uptown, either.<eos> Nothing in the morgues.
You gotta understand me. I had to do it.<eos> You still think this piece of shit is worth saving?<eos> I'm not gonna shoot him.<eos> I will if you don't kill me first.<eos> Not here.<eos> And he's not uptown, either.<eos> Nothing in the morgues.<eos> Wherever our friend's spending the night, it ain't in a hospital.<eos> Guess that's as good a news as I'm gonna get.<eos> Hey, man, with friends like these...
A backroom deal?<eos> Isn't it always?<eos> So, "I was approached by a man "who put a knife to my throat..."<eos> Did he say anything before?<eos> No.<eos> "...and he threatened me, saying "that he would kill me<eos> "if I refused to have "sexual intercourse with him."<eos> Why did we abolish the death sentence?<eos> He came up to you on the site?<eos> On the sidewalk.
Here's one for each day I've lived and here, there's one for each day until I retire, at 65, unless they change the law again.<eos> So every evening I move one marble and think a bit.<eos> Was he a doctor or a priest?<eos> A doctor but you know, that kind of doctor...<eos> The marking scheme for Romanian.<eos> Well done, Sandu!<eos> - One more task.<eos> - Please.<eos> The good doctor here noticed a surveillance camera at the corner.<eos> - By the school?
Say 2, she didn't finish it... 1.5 for the predicative clause...<eos> My daughter will get a 7, and Eliza...<eos> - Minus the last two questions.<eos> - 8...<eos> - It's the right norm?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Not good, then.<eos> She'd need straight tens in the next tests.<eos> I believe she can do it.<eos> The September session, maybe?
- 8...<eos> - It's the right norm?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Not good, then.<eos> She'd need straight tens in the next tests.<eos> I believe she can do it.<eos> The September session, maybe?<eos> Too late, I checked.<eos> - You should talk to Bulai.<eos> - About what?
He has a problem.<eos> His daughter narrowly escaped being raped right by the school.<eos> So she couldn't focus too well for the written Romanian test today.<eos> She got a scholarship to Cambridge, but it depends on her results.<eos> He's here with me. He can tell you more.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> He'll wait for you at 6 p.m. in his office.<eos> Romeo, it's for your child.<eos> Write down his number.<eos> - A bit more?
He's been very grateful to me ever since.<eos> Who'll take you on again at 43?<eos> People should help each other.<eos> My position won me many enemies, but also many friends.<eos> Could I have another drop?<eos> Good, isn't it?<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No. Why?<eos> You're here?<eos> At this hour?
No. Why?<eos> You're here?<eos> At this hour?<eos> I wanted to say sorry for earlier.<eos> The neighbors are watching.<eos> So what?<eos> How's Eliza?<eos> Not good.<eos> She didn't do well.<eos> - On her test?
I'd pay any price in this situation, if it was about me.<eos> But I won't have my child pay it.<eos> She's my child, too.<eos> Is she?<eos> Fine, then you go talk to her.<eos> Come in.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, just reading this synopsis.<eos> How did it go with Marius?<eos> Okay.
- Without waiting for you?<eos> - Well, as I was late...<eos> I ask because somebody called the police.<eos> Could be.<eos> Did you get the number?<eos> A prepaid SIM.<eos> I see.<eos> There's Eliza now.<eos> - How did it go?<eos> - Fine.
Yes.<eos> How did she know you were there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And what did you tell her?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I promised her I'd talk to you.<eos> You shouldn't have influenced her grade.<eos> After that, what does all we've taught her count for?<eos> The same as before.<eos> But not here.
The same as before.<eos> But not here.<eos> I'll follow her.<eos> Where?<eos> Anywhere.<eos> Wherever she goes, I'll go too.<eos> Have you asked what she thinks?<eos> I won't be in her way.<eos> I'll cook for her. I'll wait for her at home...<eos> In the student dorm?
That no longer concerns me.<eos> Just know that, whether Eliza goes to the UK or to Cluj, you can't stay here anymore.<eos> May I ask you something?<eos> Talk to Eliza, get her to do the exam tomorrow.<eos> Won't you drive her?<eos> She said Marius would.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you stop sleeping here from tonight.<eos> I need to tell Eliza something.<eos> Okay.
If the landing boats get to shore, it's all over.<eos> They must be stopped at sea.<eos> Also why no mention of naval mines?<eos> Are they not set?<eos> We... lined the waterway with them.<eos> You marked them clearly on a map then?<eos> Bring it to me.<eos> I will be personally reporting that to the Supreme Commander himself.<eos> When will you begin the on-site inspections?<eos> Tomorrow at 0700 hours sharp.
When does the boat depart from Songhaksa?<eos> Have you brought an umbrella?<eos> Sir... Navy Intelligence Bureau Captain Jang Hak-Soo.<eos> KLO Incheon, Choi Suk-Joong.<eos> Come sit down.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> We'll bring the naval mine chart.<eos> Arrange a carrier for us.<eos> When will it arrive?<eos> Midnight tomorrow.
And, uh... if I... if I stake him?<eos> He'll die a human death.<eos> It's painless, as far as I know.<eos> Simon, I'm so sorry.<eos> Alec, you think you could get my stele back?<eos> They took it away because you nearly burnt down the Mumbai Institute.<eos> How many times do I have to say it was an accident?<eos> Look, Max.<eos> Somebody very important is coming to visit.<eos> All right?
But what I didn't want is someone to come down here and just take over.<eos> Yeah, that's kind of her thing.<eos> Look, I know I can come across... abrasive.<eos> But we're all on the same side here.<eos> Can we agree on that?<eos> The Institute has the resources to find out what this thing is.<eos> We have an expert forensic pathologist.<eos> Highly trained in all the creatures of the Shadow World.<eos> Do you have one here?<eos> In this, uh, Chinese restaurant?
Where do you think you're going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can see my reflection, does that mean I'm not... not... one of you?<eos> You have a lot to learn.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> I don't have a heartbeat!<eos> I'm dead.<eos> Undead.
No, no, no, I...<eos> I... you know what it... it's the wrong size.<eos> I can't figure this out.<eos> Uh, Dad, cumberbunds are adjustable.<eos> Yeah. Hank, would you do me a favor?<eos> Go and see what Ms. Newberg says.<eos> You know, I-I would like to, but I can't see her in her dress before the wedding.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, cumberbunds are so important to her.<eos> Oh, yeah. Okay.
I can't wait.<eos> I'm too excited.<eos> What's wrong with a heads-up?<eos> - The blood test is tomorrow.<eos> - I know. So what? If we're gonna be pregnant tomorrow, we're already pregnant today, so...<eos> It's like peeking at the end of a book before you read it.<eos> - Everyone does it.<eos> - I don't. Then how do you know what's gonna happen?<eos> Please?<eos> All right.
It's like peeking at the end of a book before you read it.<eos> - Everyone does it.<eos> - I don't. Then how do you know what's gonna happen?<eos> Please?<eos> All right.<eos> We'll wait.<eos> Thanks for teaching me to dance.<eos> - Straight line?<eos> - Uh-huh. - Straight line.<eos> - All right.
I could not have asked for a better wedding present.<eos> Dad, you know you pushed it too far when even with your health scare<eos> Evan wouldn't come around.<eos> The health scare made it worse, actually.<eos> What if we lost you without even saying good-bye?<eos> Like, I can't do that again.<eos> Again?<eos> You were there for your mom.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> Not at the end.
Are you sleeping?<eos> How are you, psychologically?<eos> I'm a mess.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I've never-- I've never taken a life before.<eos> I'm just tryin' to get through the day without vomiting every hour.<eos> You're too sensitive.<eos> People like you shouldn't kill.<eos> Thanks for that great advice.<eos> And in my garden.
Things happen.<eos> You mean losing 85% of vision in one eye?<eos> Things like that?<eos> Why were you arguing?<eos> We didn't like each other.<eos> You should have seen him running.<eos> 15 yards ahead of him.<eos> Like a rabbit.<eos> Pure muscle, pure muscle.<eos> - In full gear?
Well, you might've put it in a bag that didn't leak.<eos> Oh... That looks like clean cuts.<eos> Well, it ain't roadkill, if that's what you're getting at.<eos> Critter right there was killed with a blade fancy-like and nailed up.<eos> "Nailed up"?<eos> All of them out there like some kind of display.<eos> Sent my dogs wild crazy.<eos> You see anything else out there?<eos> Spray paint?<eos> Graffiti?
Somethin' happened a couple of days ago.<eos> I think, uh...<eos> I think I might have helped save a little boy.<eos> Reverend says that I saved you too.<eos> All I know is I put you here.<eos> I made you like this.<eos> After what you did to me...<eos> I told myself I'd never lose a minute of sleep.<eos> You remember when you used to read to me?<eos> Outside in that big ol' hammock?
'Cause the damn ceiling is comin' down on her head in there.<eos> Look, I'll make a note to change your mother's bedding, but I'm afraid visiting hours are over, so unless you want to join the sing-along... ♪ You are my sunshine ♪ No, I don't.<eos> Good luck or bad?<eos> Guess we'll soon find out.<eos> Kyle, it's your neighbor.<eos> I left your car in the driveway.<eos> Sorry to bother you. Is everything okay here?<eos> Is there something you want?<eos> Uh... just want to tell you I'm here.<eos> Right across the way.
- Uh, here, let me help with that. - Oh, thanks.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - You okay? - Yeah.<eos> I'm just, uh... recovering.<eos> From what?<eos> I don't really know the name for it.<eos> But... you're feeling better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now.<eos> With you.
You never said you had a brother.<eos> Uh... you never asked.<eos> - Uh, thank you.<eos> It's about time.<eos> "Precious in the eyes of the Lord... is the death of his saints."<eos> Elliot Grote was no saint.<eos> He was human... deeply flawed.<eos> Every Sunday, for as far as I remember...<eos> Elliot would come here... friendless and alone... to sit.<eos> right there in that pew.
I've covered for Hank before, you know.<eos> Yeah, but not when you were this b...<eos> when you were this far... you should take care of yourself.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> You are grown up.<eos> That's very considerate.<eos> I guess after everything Paige and I have been through I have an appreciation for how precarious pregnancy can be.<eos> Jeremiah has the bulk of the patients today.<eos> I'm doing some paperwork and some simple follow-ups.<eos> Oh, all righty, then.
So, I am 100% certain that a finger will not float, but I'm glancing into the water, so he won't freak out, and there it is.<eos> Like, right in front of me.<eos> - The finger?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Just floating in the water?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If I ever lose a finger...<eos> - Make sure it's in open water.<eos> - Just not rapids.<eos> Or quicksand.
I believe I owe the success of this venture to you, Hank.<eos> Oh, it was a team effort.<eos> I would not have conceived of the improvised implant.<eos> Well, med school pranks can still be useful.<eos> It fits just below the epidermal layer.<eos> How long before someone realizes it's my blood, not yours?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Their next move could tip their hand.<eos> Do you know who it is?<eos> Unfortunately, at this moment,
Let it go.<eos> I'm sure you're wondering why I've asked you here.<eos> I assume it's because you want to use me as a pawn in your quiet battle with my mother and uncle.<eos> No.<eos> The people are upset.<eos> Our polls show a referendum to abolish would pass in a landslide.<eos> When it does, what change will you be able to affect then?<eos> Who said I wanted to change things?<eos> You did.<eos> On YouTube.
I didn't scare her off, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> - Did she say it back?<eos> - I didn't scare her off.<eos> I'm sure she's fine.<eos> But... perhaps considering the pace of things, she simply needs a bit of space.<eos> Do you think that's it?<eos> You haven't known her long and already you've picked out an engagement ring and told her you love her.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> You just told me, Breaking Bad.<eos> About the engagement ring.
Your father was a man who believed in the truth.<eos> He'd want you to know the truth.<eos> I think he admired you most when you insisted on it.<eos> What is the truth?<eos> Talk to your mother.<eos> Be resilient.<eos> And, son... ..I'll always be there for you.<eos> We need to speak with you, Mum.<eos> About the woman in the photo.<eos> About all of it.
As always, your discretion is appreciated, Doctor.<eos> Ah. My daughter's security detail.<eos> What is it?<eos> The crowd for tomorrow's match could be volatile.<eos> The people who support the monarchy are clashing with the ones... that don't.<eos> I bet they are.<eos> What else?<eos> Your Majesty... should watch this.<eos> And then we should speak.<eos> In confidence.
I just want to make sure you're okay with everything for tomorrow.<eos> If their plan works, one of us could die tomorrow.<eos> And if our plan works, I'm officially in the family business.<eos> I want to avenge my father.<eos> I want Ted to pay.<eos> But if we do this, they could kill him.<eos> I don't know if I can go through with it.<eos> I don't know if I could live with that.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> With you.
We found this today at his house.<eos> A suicide note, I guess.<eos> This can't go public.<eos> We haven't told the press anything. But this is evidence.<eos> Once the report comes out...<eos> Email this to me.<eos> Mrs. Underwood? It's two o'clock in the morning.<eos> Would you like to go home?<eos> Yes, I'll be out in a moment.<eos> Yes, ma'am.
You are deliberately deceiving me. - Going behind my...<eos> - You have forgotten your place, Douglas.<eos> My place?<eos> What about your place?<eos> You leave him when he needs you most, you threaten him, and now that he's in here, you undermine him.<eos> - You're supposed to be...<eos> - Stop.<eos> That is enough.<eos> I will fill you in on everything, but not here.<eos> At the White House.
- Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I thought we were meeting alone.<eos> As the administration's representative, I need to participate in any conversations--<eos> Madam Secretary, I believe my people were very clear, hmm?<eos> Would you give us a moment, please, Cathy?<eos> Just a little while.<eos> I'll be outside.<eos> So... how is surgery going?<eos> So far, so good.
There are too many drilling sites in sensitive areas.<eos> It's a security issue to us.<eos> And what sites, in particular, are you worried about?<eos> Oh, you... you are familiar with the individual zones?<eos> It's my plan.<eos> I know it backwards and forwards.<eos> I see, so that's why it's so important to you.<eos> Because it's yours.<eos> Is it one of these?<eos> On the Pacific coast?
I see, so that's why it's so important to you.<eos> Because it's yours.<eos> Is it one of these?<eos> On the Pacific coast?<eos> You asked for me, sir?<eos> I wanna get out of this place as soon as possible.<eos> I'll make sure of it, sir.<eos> Where's Claire?<eos> She's in Germany.<eos> Germany?
Now, if Petrov doesn't agree soon, they may back out.<eos> - Thank you, Raymond.<eos> - I'm on standby.<eos> We need to shake hands on this. No.<eos> No, I told you, nothing on Sakhalin Island.<eos> It's two zones on the southern end. Then you have your bailout.<eos> It opens a door I don't want to open.<eos> They're being more than reasonable, Mr. President.<eos> Reasonable?<eos> In whose eyes?
Nothing.<eos> A pretty face.<eos> So, yes, play the president if you like.<eos> Go. Tell the Chinese they get nothing on the Pacific.<eos> You think you can do that, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> Your people are hurting.<eos> Six months at most, they're gonna be marching on Red Square.<eos> I'm done letting you have your dignity.<eos> The truth is you're a beggar on your knees, and you will take whatever we shove down your throat.<eos> Viktor.
Yeah, there.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> Why?<eos> Back at the saloon, I ran into a woman, and she caused me to have more memory flashes, so...<eos> I think I might have known her in one of my past lives.<eos> And if so, she might be able to help me find Carter.<eos> Wait. So you're just gonna run out there and try and find her?<eos> Actually, I was planning on flying.<eos> You want a partner in crime?<eos> Okay, fine.
Left?<eos> I had to tear myself away from the time period for fear that I would never see my then-future wife, Miranda, ever again.<eos> Turnbull attacked Calvert the very next day.<eos> So... you can understand why I must act.<eos> No, Martin, I don't.<eos> As I said before, this is advanced medicine unsuitable to the period, to say nothing of what this boy's survival might do to the timeline.<eos> Be that as it may, I refuse to live with the regret I see on your face right now.<eos> The information Mr. Stein got from the barkeep paid out.<eos> I know where the Stillwater gang's holed up.<eos> All right.
But this town still needs a sheriff.<eos> Well, I'm not the law-and-order type... nor the staying-in-one-place type either.<eos> Well, we have that much in common at least.<eos> At least. Be well, Jonah.<eos> Nice thing about my world... for you, it ain't going anywhere.<eos> Ah, perhaps we will see each other again, my friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I reckon that'd be okay.<eos> Interesting fella.<eos> Indeed.
Really?<eos> Bored enough to spend your time studying a stranger's shoes.<eos> See, I think you were dying on the vine of this tight-ass party, because Daddy's money can't buy you the one thing you really need.<eos> And what's that?<eos> The unexpected.<eos> Maybe you're not so dumb.<eos> Elektra Natchios.<eos> Matt Murdock.<eos> Let's go, Matthew.<eos> On your left.
Go to hell.<eos> If you really want to be done, consider this me firing you.<eos> Any time you want to drive...<eos> I think it's illegal, driving under the influence of blindness.<eos> You're the future lawyer.<eos> Yeah, I should start going to class again, then.<eos> - Hey, where are we?<eos> - A house.<eos> Yeah. Is it yours?<eos> Oh, God, no.
Uh...<eos> I've got it, here.<eos> Tepper, wonderful.<eos> Reyes is calling the chief medical examiner.<eos> From rocky start to Hail Mary.<eos> Why, what do we know about him?<eos> I showed Frank a copy of his family's autopsy report.<eos> He claims they're faked, and Tepper's name is all over them.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> All right.
The way in is Stan Gibson.<eos> Armed?<eos> Doubt it.<eos> Works for Roxxon.<eos> And according to my intel, every employee carries a key card that grants them access to their secret floor in the Yakatomi building.<eos> What sets our friend Stan apart is that he's just an accountant.<eos> Zero fighting chops.<eos> So you're gonna pickpocket his key card?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - In the middle of a gala?
You don't get to create danger, and then protect us from that danger.<eos> That's not heroic.<eos> That's insane.<eos> We were really close to winning the Frank Castle case and getting that guy the help he needed.<eos> I don't know what tanked it, but I know we had a shot, mostly because I worked my ass off to cover for you.<eos> - I deserve better than that.<eos> - I know.<eos> Every time I walk up those stairs... I wonder if today is the day you're dead in your living room.<eos> I'm not gonna stop, Foggy.<eos> Not anytime soon.
I just wanna rewind this informal meeting<eos> - we're having by about 30 seconds.<eos> - What? You come to me with a lead, with a...<eos> a really good lead, right?<eos> And now you just wanna take off?<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, it's... it's sort of like a pitcher going to the 8th inning with a no-hit shutout, and just walking away.<eos> Look, this was supposed to be about saving my law firm, and I didn't--<eos> I get that.<eos> At first, yeah.
I mean, the... the case is closed.<eos> Frank Castle's in prison.<eos> But this thing ain't over.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> You know it.<eos> 'Cause you know you're on to something.<eos> - Yeah, okay, okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, so, um...
Always is with you.<eos> Remember the last time you patched me up?<eos> When you were cut to shreds?<eos> Kinda hard to forget.<eos> Well, the same guy who did that to me, he's the one responsible for your five new patients.<eos> Nobu.<eos> You said he burned to death.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> There's gotta be more to the story than that.<eos> For now...
You could've been rich.<eos> And maybe you could've taken your family to the Bahamas instead of Central Park, huh?<eos> You think this... all of this... is about a bad drug deal?<eos> That's what you see.<eos> You're losing your touch, Frank.<eos> Your kids, at the park?<eos> That's never what this has been about.<eos> It's about what happened with you.<eos> With all of us.<eos> Kandahar.
That candle that you're burning at both ends?<eos> Sooner or later, it's gonna fizzle out.<eos> I'm fine. Really.<eos> You know the problem with martyrs?<eos> The good ones end up dead.<eos> You know, it's... it's one thing to try to take on the mob, or to block some shady real estate deal.<eos> But this stuff?<eos> - Those people just killed your friend.<eos> - I know! I can't just let that happen, Claire.<eos> Not in my city.
If the past few months are any indication, my firm is going to need a very resourceful attorney.<eos> Someone like you... who's not afraid to take on riskier, non-traditional cases.<eos> Cases involving vigilantes.<eos> Let's call them "people with complexities."<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Try me.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about this.<eos> I made all this stuff to keep Betsy safe, not just give it away.<eos> - You'll get it back, Melvin.<eos> - Without a scratch.
- The whole city is watching.<eos> If I screw up, I'd never work again.<eos> And, frankly, you'd probably never work again, either, by association, which...<eos> Stop thinking about screwing up, about losing.<eos> You need to think about winning.<eos> Colonel Ray Schoonover, United States Marine Corps.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.<eos> You got this.<eos> Counsel?
He wanted you to forget about law, your friends... your city.<eos> He thought I could distract you.<eos> He was right.<eos> No.<eos> Because I did the thing I promised him I'd never do.<eos> I fell in love with you, Matthew.<eos> Listen to my heartbeat, if you must.<eos> You know it's true.<eos> Stick told me about some secret Japanese organization.<eos> The Hand.
- Stick...<eos> - You.<eos> We live on the front lines.<eos> Like it or not.<eos> It doesn't mean we have to fight Stick's way.<eos> He kills his enemies, and we don't have to.<eos> You make that choice sound so easy.<eos> No, it's not easy. It's impossible.<eos> But it's a choice and it's a choice that I remake every single day.<eos> Every second, sometimes.
What happened that day?<eos> The day your family was so tragically killed.<eos> It's okay, Frank.<eos> - I understand, it's difficult.<eos> - Do you?<eos> Do you understand?<eos> 'Cause I don't think you understand shit.<eos> I'd like permission to treat the witness as hostile, Your Honor?<eos> Granted.<eos> All right, Frank.
I will miss him. - How did he die?<eos> - Whenever the ship was stationary,<eos> Arthur explored the surrounding areas.<eos> He dreamed of discovering new species of wildlife, you know?<eos> But he never returned from that fateful walk.<eos> - He got lost.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Maybe he suffered from snow blindness, and froze to death.<eos> - How long after his disappearance was he found?<eos> - Four days.
Pimblett adopted a vegetarian diet and tried to subsist the whole time on canned vegetables.<eos> Well, unwise perhaps, but far from convincing me the man was insane.<eos> Also, sir, the crew says that he'd become obsessed with salmon, even though he never ate it, he was continually sketching salmon.<eos> Yes, I've heard all about the salmon.<eos> Well, if he did go a bit doolally, it at least explains him being miles away from the ship with no gloves on.<eos> Well, insane or otherwise, we still don't know who strangled him, or why.<eos> Especially if we take Nuniq's word that there were no Inuit nearby.<eos> Sirs, there is another explanation.<eos> Qalupalik.<eos> Now, in Inuit lore...
Sirs, there is another explanation.<eos> Qalupalik.<eos> Now, in Inuit lore...<eos> Sir, in Inuit lore, Qalupalik is a human-like creature and he crawls out of the sea, with long stringy hair, and sharp fingernails and webbed hands, and a greenish hue to his skin.<eos> And he wears a pouch, sirs, and he takes his victims and he stuffs them in his pouch and he carries them...<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> Never mind what?<eos> I just remembered we still have Mr. Pimblett's body, as where Qalupalik carries his victims down beneath the ocean forever.<eos> After the brain dissection failed to reveal any abnormalities, we conducted blood tests, which showed high levels of lead.<eos> Lead?
Bloody Swedes.<eos> Good work, George.<eos> Congratulations on your promotion, Captain Philips.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you celebrate?<eos> I enjoyed dinner with friends.<eos> These friends?<eos> Just what were you doing having dinner with high-ranking Swedes when you're to be Captain of a government-sanctioned Canadian expedition?<eos> They wanted to speak with me.<eos> What about?
We'll see about that.<eos> I sent Crabtree to search his room while you were interviewing him.<eos> And it's true that he's one of the few who could have stolen the negatives leading up to the show.<eos> And now he's leveraging his newfound position to solicit offers from the Swedes.<eos> Unless, sir, he's been working with the Swedes the entire time.<eos> Mr. Pimblett caught on to him and that's why he was killed?<eos> Philips then tries to pin it on the Captain and take his ship.<eos> Sirs, I found Pimblett's missing journal in Mr. Philips' room.<eos> Arrest him, George.<eos> Mais en tout cas,
I doubt it.<eos> I've read through my son's research a thousand times.<eos> Savage has devastating weapon at his command, and here now, at the eleventh hour, we could sorely use a weapon of our own.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> This is such a waste of time.<eos> I've already looked through every single page of Aldus' notebooks.<eos> If he had written something specific about the bracelet and killing Savage, I would have known it already.<eos> Here it is.<eos> You ever think about him?<eos> Carter?
I'll look into it.<eos> This is such a waste of time.<eos> I've already looked through every single page of Aldus' notebooks.<eos> If he had written something specific about the bracelet and killing Savage, I would have known it already.<eos> Here it is.<eos> You ever think about him?<eos> Carter?<eos> I try not to.<eos> It's not like I'll ever see him again.<eos> Not in this lifetime, anyway.
All right.<eos> You know, if this doesn't work...<eos> I'll turn every cell in my body inside out?<eos> I was gonna go with "die," but yeah.<eos> You know, we could've escaped on the Jumpship, but we're doing this to save everybody that we brought on the Waverider.<eos> You're the real hero here, Ray.<eos> All right.<eos> Stand back.<eos> No. Like, way back.<eos> All right.
I have held dozens of my children as they perished from old age.<eos> You might be a Time Master, but I'm a master of time.<eos> And I play a far deeper game than you could ever hope to comprehend.<eos> Gideon, go to maximum on the Time Drive.<eos> Inadvisable, Captain.<eos> When Dr. Palmer siphoned power from the auxiliary Time Drive, he reduced the ship...<eos> Gideon! Take us to maximum.<eos> We need to get to the Vanishing Point as fast as possible.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - Somewhere safe.
So I didn't say good-bye.<eos> And now I fear I will never have that chance.<eos> You will.<eos> Look, I've told you before that I am not going to risk your marriage in order to save my wife.<eos> I promise you that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not even gonna pretend to understand any of this.<eos> It's pretty crazy, huh?<eos> That was you in the hospital, on the day you were born.<eos> And earlier, on fire.
Druce showed me something called the Oculus.<eos> They've been controlling us all.<eos> Nothing we've done so far has been of our own accord.<eos> We've been following a script laid out by the Time Masters.<eos> No, that's... that's not possible.<eos> I-I refuse to believe that.<eos> Well, you should, Raymond... because they showed me your death.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You said the team was in trouble.<eos> What sort of trouble, exactly?
You know, I forgot how arrogant you were.<eos> "Were"?<eos> Why are you referring to me in the past tense?<eos> Do you witness my death?<eos> Relax, you don't die.<eos> Horribly maimed.<eos> Why won't you tell me what happens?<eos> Instead of pestering me about the future and being an insufferable know-it-all, why don't you help me reroute the temporal flow off the secondary buffer instead of just worrying about yourself?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - All right.
Well, if it's any consolation, you're not alone.<eos> Oh, you're giving up too?<eos> Well, let's just review our situation, shall we, Raymond?<eos> They're turning Mr. Rory back into Chronos,<eos> I...<eos> I'm about to have a nuclear meltdown... and our captain thinks our future is already written for us.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you're both a couple of quitters.<eos> There's no escape from either these cells<eos> - or from the future.
The temporal implications are infinite.<eos> That's why I don't think.<eos> - Not bad, right?<eos> - Good.<eos> - So how'd you do it?<eos> - Do what?<eos> How did you not get turned into Chronos?<eos> You said the only way you held onto yourself the first time was by focusing on your hate.<eos> What did I focus on this time?<eos> The team.
Infinitesimal as that may be.<eos> Captain, we've arrived at the Oculus Wellspring on the far side of the Vanishing Point.<eos> Based on Captain Hunter's description, the Oculus is a massive temporal computer, most likely powered by a scaled-down supernova contained at the bottom of the Wellspring.<eos> Why aren't any of you more excited by this?<eos> We're excited to blow it up.<eos> Dr. Palmer will deactivate the core contained supernova, which should create an anomalistic event.<eos> A very big explosion.<eos> Sounds like a plan.<eos> Hello again, Rip.<eos> Right on schedule.
This is how you die.<eos> It's okay.<eos> All my life I've wanted to make a difference.<eos> Creating a future for you guys without the Time Masters influence, that counts.<eos> That said, I'm in no rush to die, so keep 'em off me, okay?<eos> We got you.<eos> Keep firing!<eos> I'm not doing this 'cause I like you.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> All right.
You know what I need to find out.<eos> I'm sorry, Captain.<eos> News accounts from 2166 confirm that Vandal Savage has already succeeded in murdering Miranda and Jonas.<eos> Hey.<eos> Get out.<eos> I want to be alone.<eos> Gideon has confirmed that the Oculus has been destroyed.<eos> From here on out, it's tabula rasa.<eos> Pretend for a minute that I don't speak Greek.<eos> Latin.
Yes, and for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, after four months, you haven't got her, you know, out of your system? (chuckles)<eos> How's that possible?<eos> You have no idea where they're holding Lindsay?<eos> No. But they did send this to me after the seminar.<eos> Said no more cops or she's dead.<eos> So the kidnappers were there yesterday watching you.<eos> CARVER: I just hope they weren't at the party.<eos> If they hurt her, I...<eos> CHLOE:
Isn't that right?<eos> Right.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And, um... But you caught the bad guys; that's the main thing.<eos> OLIVIA: Again, I'm sorry that you got caught in the crossfire, Mr. Morningstar.<eos> Oh, it's just a graze.<eos> (chuckles) And call me Lucifer.<eos> Thank you again for all of your help.<eos> You are so welcome.<eos> - Bye, now.
- Tighter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And he's sitting on my desk.<eos> Get out of that one.<eos> Please tell me I'm hallucinating.<eos> Well, I am dreamy, but try to contain yourself.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm not actually here to see you.<eos> I've come to talk to your boss.<eos> About a shooting.
You making fun of his pants, yo?<eos> Well, are we talking pants or trousers? Because it's very confusing.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - Don't matter.<eos> I'll kill you first.<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> Where's Viper?<eos> You had your hero moment... stay down, or you're gonna get shot!<eos> Indeed!
Hello, Sergei.<eos> Waters a bit rough, are they?<eos> What-what the hell are you doing?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm going to brutally torture you until you give me what I want.<eos> My wings... where are they?<eos> What wings?<eos> I don't even know what you're talking about!<eos> Why do they always insist on being so difficult?<eos> All right.
My wings, please.<eos> Look, man, why would I take your wings?<eos> I don't even know who you are!<eos> I'm Lucifer Morningstar.<eos> And you, you small-peckered fool, are Sergei Bok, a known smuggler.<eos> You move just about anything you can get your trashy Euro hands on.<eos> Please, man!<eos> I don't have 'em!<eos> I swear.<eos> Okay?
I swear.<eos> Okay?<eos> I don't know what I'd do with a pair...<eos> Maybe if I hit him a few times?<eos> Though I hate to say it, I'm not sure violence is the trick here.<eos> I'm beginning to wonder if this human stain is actually telling the truth.<eos> No! He's scum.<eos> He'll say anything.<eos> Maybe it's not him, it's us.<eos> Us?
An auction?<eos> Held under the veil of a charity event at Crimson Hall.<eos> Saints' teeth?<eos> Holy napkins?<eos> Oh, a piece of the cross?<eos> They've got my wings in absurdly fraudulent company.<eos> Yeah, unlike the wings, there's no way those are real.<eos> Exactly, it's insulting!<eos> Putting my wings on the block like some chintzy accoutrement.<eos> All right.
Putting my wings on the block like some chintzy accoutrement.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, you can take comfort knowing the auction's already set to be raided tonight.<eos> So the FBI are gonna snatch my wings?<eos> When we get a chance to pounce on the bad guys, we take it.<eos> The FBI is taking lead.<eos> Figured you might be after the same guys.<eos> And we have jurisdiction.<eos> Okay, so how do we get the wings back?<eos> After the raid?
Ooh, lovely moves.<eos> ♪ Drown my woes in a lake of fire ♪<eos> ♪ Sing a song gonna take me higher... ♪<eos> Try to look even more like a douche.<eos> Mission accomplished.<eos> ♪ Lucifer gonna set me free ♪<eos> ♪ Good Lord turned his back on me ♪<eos> ♪ Lucifer gonna set me free... ♪<eos> She's here.<eos> Okay, great.
Oh, you know him.<eos> All too well.<eos> Trixie's finally down.<eos> She conned you into reading the book about the sneezing panda, didn't she?<eos> Five times.<eos> Um... thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> You know, for having my back and... for everything.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> For everything.
Yeah. Did you know him well?<eos> A little, I guess.<eos> He, he, I mean, he ran the place.<eos> Do you know if Mr. Arietta was involved in any drug activity?<eos> Drugs?<eos> I mean, I wish he was.<eos> That would've made him more interesting. Okay.<eos> Enough about the dead guy.<eos> Tell me everything you know about Padre Pederast.<eos> Who?
You ready to go to church?<eos> Bringing down a priest is the only reason I ever would.<eos> In. Bring him in.<eos> Yes, bring him in so we can bring him down.<eos> Hey, um, you go ahead.<eos> I'll... I'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Just something I got to do first.<eos> Hey, so I'm in the middle of something, but I haven't seen you all week.<eos> Are we gonna talk about what happened?<eos> What?

I'll... I'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Just something I got to do first.<eos> Hey, so I'm in the middle of something, but I haven't seen you all week.<eos> Are we gonna talk about what happened?<eos> What?<eos> Our kiss, Dan.<eos> It's kind of a big deal.<eos> Right, I'm sorry, Chloe.<eos> I've had a lot on my mind.<eos> Yeah. You okay?
Are we gonna talk about what happened?<eos> What?<eos> Our kiss, Dan.<eos> It's kind of a big deal.<eos> Right, I'm sorry, Chloe.<eos> I've had a lot on my mind.<eos> Yeah. You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> But we should talk.<eos> About everything.
I mean, some people are just... beyond saving.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> There's still hope for him.<eos> He shot up your church, he's most likely running a drug ring behind your back, and, oh, yes, killed a man.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Look, what if it's true? Then he needs me even more.<eos> How can you still have faith in this boy?<eos> God has faith in him.<eos> In all of us.<eos> Even in our darkest moments.
- He left to go meet him. - He left?<eos> Where to?<eos> Maybe he's trying to convince Connor to turn himself in. No.<eos> He's probably trying to hide the little miscreant.<eos> Put his faith in God, not the police.<eos> Why do you care about a priest?<eos> I don't.<eos> Where would he hide him?<eos> Somewhere he considers safe, I assume.<eos> Sanctuary.
I actually need someone to confide in about a patient.<eos> And hey, listen, if you have any patients<eos> - you need to talk about...<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> Just shoot me, Detective, please, because maybe you'll finally realize...<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> You're changing, becoming vulnerable.<eos> Maybe even... mortal.<eos> Oh, Mazie.
I don't have a choice, Chloe.<eos> This is work.<eos> Yeah, I've never heard that one before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Long Beach?<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, when Trixie asks where you are tomorrow,<eos> I'll be sure to tell her that something important came up.<eos> Oh, Lucifer.
Cool?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Los Diablos.<eos> The biker club?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I run the warehouse, but they run the docks.<eos> If anything went down, they would know about it.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I swear.<eos> All right, all right.
You know, it's complicated, Monkey.<eos> You're just gonna have to go with it, okay?<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Chocolate cake.<eos> - Done.<eos> - For a whole year.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Mommy, I'm thirsty!<eos> Okay, fine.
What a momentous revelation, Detective Decker.<eos> You can celebrate from jail when it turns out I'm right about you.<eos> I have never lied to you.<eos> And I will never lie to you.<eos> What was in the container?<eos> Russian dolls.<eos> Russian dolls?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Oh, I knew it was gonna be that Renny guy.<eos> About that warehouse...!
Previously on Lucifer...<eos> - So how do you afford this place?<eos> - It's my mother's.<eos> Your mother's Penelope Decker, queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?<eos> You have to introduce me.<eos> So you're the doctor.<eos> You're just as Lucifer described.<eos> I like you.<eos> Are we gonna talk about what happened?<eos> Our kiss.
My mom and dad used to a lot.<eos> But this time it was Mom fighting with Nana about how I look.<eos> Which one wants you to look like an old drag queen?<eos> My grandma, I guess.<eos> They're fighting over what they want me to be when I grow up.<eos> What do you want to be?<eos> I want to be the first president of Mars.<eos> Or a zookeeper. Mm-hmm.<eos> I used to be a zookeeper.<eos> In a way.
You've been avoiding me for weeks, you won't get in my car.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> There's no problem.<eos> Just maybe you're not as charming as you think you are.<eos> Wait, is this about that vulnerability thing?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> I get the teensiest bit touchy-feely with you and you freak out.<eos> Ugh. All I meant that night is that I can trust you.<eos> That's all.<eos> Okay?

Not till this human stain's brought to justice.<eos> I can't get near you, now I can't get rid of you.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'm gonna go up and shower.<eos> Stay put.<eos> Do not wake up Trixie.<eos> Did you just throw a toy at me?<eos> Oh, you're awake.<eos> But since you're up, I have some questions for you.<eos> Right.
In other words, are you sure the detective is your mother?<eos> Could she be from somewhere else?<eos> Does she have any special powers?<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> What about any markings?<eos> Scars, on her back perhaps?<eos> There's some chocolate cake in it for you.<eos> I want cash.<eos> I like your style.<eos> All right.
Does she have any special powers?<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> What about any markings?<eos> Scars, on her back perhaps?<eos> There's some chocolate cake in it for you.<eos> I want cash.<eos> I like your style.<eos> All right.<eos> Mommy does have a scar.<eos> - Oh? - On her butt.
We were hella intimate.!<eos> Did you not hear about the honey?<eos> I mean...<eos> We're talking about, um, emotional intimacy.<eos> Like, um... did Lucifer, bring you dinner?<eos> Or did he do anything special for you?<eos> Get you a burger, fries?<eos> What? No.<eos> Look, it was a rad night.<eos> And morning... and afternoon...
Well, besides sex, but...<eos> You're looking well these days.<eos> So confident, so cheery.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.<eos> Thanks to you, Mom.<eos> You found a way to get us home.<eos> But... manipulating Lucifer and Chloe toward each other for our own gain...<eos> Your Father is the one that started all of this.<eos> We are simply bringing it to an end.<eos> On our terms.
I mean, of course I want to, but... right now all I'm concerned about is proving my worth to you.<eos> Unless of course you've changed your mind about the sex.<eos> Okay, there will be no sex.<eos> As far as our so-called moment,<eos> I let my emotions get the best of me the other night, okay?<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> You and me, it's not happening.<eos> You have to accept, Lucifer, that we are very different people with very different priorities.<eos> My priority right now is this case.<eos> Okay?
Fuck this!<eos> Could you help me with...<eos> Don't stop.<eos> So good.<eos> That's pork.<eos> So?<eos> Grab some ketchup.<eos> What's in your pocket?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Your lab coat. There.
You're acting as if she's a person, and not an experiment.<eos> That's what she is, Kara, she's one of Max's deranged science projects.<eos> So why don't we just arrest Max?<eos> We're the DEO, we don't exist.<eos> And we certainly don't have the authority to arrest private citizens, especially not world-famous billionaires.<eos> Briefing the strike team in 10.<eos> Kara, there's something I wanted to tell you, not in front of Hank.<eos> When I was with Max, he mentioned you.<eos> What?<eos> In what way?
Maxwell Lord made her to be just like me.<eos> And she was.<eos> Guess my girl came in second place.<eos> We'll see how funny you think it is when you've been in that cell for a few years.<eos> I'd say you're different from your cousin when it comes to truth, justice and the American way,<eos> but holding people indefinitely against their will, can't get much more American than that.<eos> You will never hurt anyone ever again.<eos> Anyone like Eliza Danvers?<eos> That's some cute house you grew up in in Midvale.<eos> Right along the beach.
- Mmm.<eos> Uh, I don't know if you've talked to Adam...<eos> I did.<eos> He's leaving.<eos> He's going back to Opal City.<eos> So soon?<eos> Well, he says that now that we're back into each other's lives, he'll visit me of course, but there's nothing urgent keeping him here in National City.<eos> You know, Kara, I always thought that you and I were very different.<eos> But I'm starting to realize we may be more alike than I thought.<eos> In what way?
He was raised on Earth.<eos> He might as well be human.<eos> You are the true heir to the House of El.<eos> If you help me, maybe I can help you.<eos> You're trying to manipulate my emotions.<eos> But you're undermined by your own fear.<eos> I'm not frightened of you.<eos> Not of me.<eos> Of the truth I hold...<eos> About your mother.
You have killed your daughter!<eos> I'd like to address the rumors of an incident at Lord Technologies.<eos> Oh, this is going to be ugly.<eos> We're the target of industrial espionage.<eos> Thankfully, there were no casualties and those responsible have been apprehended.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - He's covering up the attack.<eos> What is he up to?<eos> Well, let me see what I can find out.<eos> No way.
Yeah, and I don't want to give him a chance to hurt her.<eos> So, we need to find out what he's up to and fast.<eos> Which is why I didn't just talk to him when I went down there.<eos> I took surveillance shots, so you could help me find a way inside.<eos> I'm sorry, you want, you wanna break in to Max Lord's facility?<eos> I knew you picking up that camera again was a bad idea.<eos> You're like one of those crazy war correspondents who can't just stay home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Would you really want Kara to find out that you let me do this all alone?<eos> Fine, fine!
What it really proves to me is how little this job means to you.<eos> No. That's not true.<eos> I love my job.<eos> Every minute that you waste playing assistant in here is a minute that someone out there is not getting saved.<eos> Ms. Grant, what are you saying?<eos> I am saying that I will not partake in this ruse any longer.<eos> So, you either prove to me that you are not Supergirl, or you can clean out your desk tomorrow.<eos> How we doing, Winn?<eos> Feeling kind of exposed out here.<eos> Okay, okay.
- I remember this.<eos> Anyway, he orders from this guy on the beach, five minutes later the guy comes back with a sock full of cocaine.<eos> That's a good band name:<eos> Sock Full of Cocaine.<eos> How we're not all in a Mexican prison I'll never understand.<eos> Oh, Grace, you remember when, uh, Sonny tried to roll Robert down the lane?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It's the only time I ever got kicked out of a bowling alley.<eos> -You bowled?<eos> In an alley? -Uh-huh.
Come on.<eos> And next.<eos> Next.<eos> Shit.<eos> Next.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's Betty Cracker herself.<eos> I was in that grass this morning.<eos> That exact grass.
- Thank you very much.<eos> - Hi, dad.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You, now I have really bad conscience. OK...<eos> I had planned to meet you, but then came the stuff in the way.<eos> Sorry, that is...<eos> - Don't worry about it, I'm fine.<eos> I can call you when I'm done at work.<eos> -Yes, great.<eos> -OK, bye.
She's blowing every spic in the neighborhood, right?<eos> First one he kills. But he can't keep up.<eos> There'd be blood running in the streets.<eos> All the money in the world can't buy a man peace of mind, you know?<eos> You ever...<eos> I ever what?<eos> Nah, nothing.<eos> We should start meeting in the conference room.<eos> You know, more businesslike.<eos> Yeah, all right.
I am really sorry to be hearing all this.<eos> It's not easy for me to say.<eos> Our corporate bylaws have a morals clause that call for the removal of any officer engaged in any immoral or unethical behavior.<eos> What I'm saying is I can get rid of him.<eos> All it takes is a vote by the other partners.<eos> So, what can I do to help?<eos> I just came for your support.<eos> Want to keep you apprised of what's happening.<eos> Mostly I wanted you to hear it from me.<eos> Man-to-man.
- No, that's NEW.<eos> - Carol something.<eos> - Carol Miller.<eos> How many tickets they got us down for?<eos> - 100?<eos> - I have a call in to Stein for more.<eos> This your thing at the Academy?<eos> - Put me down for 10.<eos> - For the New York Dolls?<eos> No, the fucking Ice Capades.
- I'll be back around 6:00.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Thomas.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Thank you.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Hey, scumbag, guess where I was till 5:00 A.M.<eos> - What?<eos> What? - Come on, let's take a ride.<eos> Not in the car.
Buck Rogers.<eos> Radio asshole.<eos> Former fucking radio asshole.<eos> I don't want to hear this shit.<eos> - Let me tell you what...<eos> - You a fucking moron?<eos> Have you ever heard of conspiracy after the fact?<eos> Look at, I'm sorry, but I'm just really upset.<eos> So you tell me about a what?<eos> About a fucking murder?
Have you ever heard of conspiracy after the fact?<eos> Look at, I'm sorry, but I'm just really upset.<eos> So you tell me about a what?<eos> About a fucking murder?<eos> Always running your fucking mouth.<eos> I'm trying to be straight with you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - This guy gives you the wrong idea about me.<eos> Everybody relax, all right?<eos> - You okay?

Kill the pigs!<eos> Nasty!<eos> Nasty!<eos> Nasty!<eos> Nasty!<eos> Nasty!<eos> Nasty!<eos> So they what?<eos> They just hang around backstage?<eos> Backstage, by the tour bus.
Our African-American victim was driving a red shoot-me car through a Diablo neighborhood just blocks away, sir.<eos> Windows tinted...<eos> Maybe the shooter didn't know who she was.<eos> Or maybe he did.<eos> About $2,500 in this envelope.<eos> Then heroin.<eos> Found underneath the baby's car seat, which is the last place we'd look for drugs if we pulled her over.<eos> Mama was dealing dope?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - Okay.
Buzz: I could start filming the crowd.<eos> Maybe they'd quit throwing stuff.<eos> Yeah, and maybe you'd get your ass shot.<eos> Go with Sanchez and Sykes.<eos> See if you can find casings from the murder weapon.<eos> We're gonna be here a while.<eos> Let's get this, uh, crime scene tented, please.<eos> Uh, Captain.<eos> Captain, I'm afraid that we are in the middle of a gang war with the worst kind of casualty imaginable.<eos> Oh, finally.
I work with, like, a plumber after school for all that money.<eos> And you don't got no warrant for my phone.<eos> You got to have warrant for that.<eos> You know a lot about the law<eos> - for a 15-year-old plumber. - Sanchez:<eos> Yeah.<eos> Makes me wonder if maybe your job is on the street.<eos> And if all this money is yours...<eos> Look, guys, guys, I... I got to have this money.<eos> Okay?
Look, don't do this.<eos> Please, ju... Please don't do this.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> Let's just say that you and the dead lady here were involved in the same kind of business.<eos> You had your plumber, and she had her plumber.<eos> So who would her plumber be?<eos> How would I know about her plumber?<eos> It would be a shame if you didn't because then I'm putting this money into evidence and sending you home.<eos> Now, how would that go over?<eos> At the church, man.
And, um, I can... I can call you when... when I'm in Echo Park and I know that Gary is definitely still behind me?<eos> Sure, I'm ready.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't distract me.<eos> And, um, just if anything looks wrong, text me, and... and forget it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can handle this.<eos> I can.<eos> Okay.
My client was put on trial for Reese's murder.<eos> Jeopardy was attached.<eos> That case was dismissed with prejudice due to police misconduct, planted evidence, and perjury.<eos> I found the stolen wallets from the flower shop robbery myself.<eos> I did not plant them, sir.<eos> And who was it who told you where to look for those wallets?<eos> Was it former detective Mark Hickman?<eos> We are not here to discuss Reese.<eos> We are here to discuss the present or we go.<eos> Okay.
I'll, uh, let you know if I find anything useful while you're covering your ass.<eos> - Sykes.<eos> - Oh, uh, Julio.<eos> I think we may have our warrant.<eos> [Sighs] Off the prints on the cash?<eos> No, the front of the envelope.<eos> In addition to heroin and a half-eaten taco on her passenger seat,<eos> Tamika Weaver was found with $2,500 in cash on her person before she was shot in an offering envelope that we've established is from your church.<eos> Those envelopes are all over the place...<eos> In the vestibule, near the hymnals, everywhere.
Just answer me this.<eos> Did they find any controlled substances?<eos> I'm gonna take that as a no.<eos> Daniel, we should leave.<eos> - No, Peter.<eos> I want to help.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Then you can start by telling us where you were the night that Tamika Weaver and her son were murdered.<eos> Extra credit if you can also explain why, instead of drugs, we found the murder weapon that killed officer Reese in the altar of your church.<eos> - In the altar?
Before I go, I just want to say thanks a lot for being so straightforward with me yesterday about why you were looking for your mother.<eos> Listen, Lieutenant, I... I just... I didn't want...<eos> Buzz.<eos> Buzz, if you can get a truthful suspect sighting from Mr. Beck here, pass that info onto the Hollywood division.<eos> Tell them that I have S.I.S. following Mr. Beck trying to catch this Gary creep.<eos> You might also consider telling the Captain what happened before she hears about it some other way.<eos> So, when and where did you first notice the suspect?<eos> In my rearview mirror on the corner of Sunset and Sweetzer.<eos> Buzz, I-I am really sorry... For misleading you.<eos> Okay.
I need you to come downtown.<eos> Look, I thought about it.<eos> I'm gonna take you to see Emile.<eos> No, we already have Emile.<eos> And we know how he got to Fontana, so now you have a problem, Mark.<eos> Don't you mean we have a problem?<eos> What if I walk into your division and explain to everyone how you and I have been... collaborating?<eos> You have to decide if that's in your best interests, but you're coming downtown.<eos> So either you get dragged out of this vehicle or we escort you to P.A.B.<eos> Okay.
I give you consent to check my house for Emile Fisher.<eos> There.<eos> Happy?<eos> Maybe he's got headphones on.<eos> Mike has the key.<eos> Let's just go in.<eos> We don't need permission.<eos> Um, Sanchez.<eos> You and Sykes go around back in case this guy decides to try and take off.<eos> Okay. All right.
We're in recess till 3:00.<eos> Lieutenant Tao, Detective Dunn.<eos> [Telephone ringing in distance] Rusty, I'm sorry.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> If you go over to county, maybe they will be processing your mother during visiting hours.<eos> You're my mom.<eos> I am.<eos> Oh. I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.
That is beyond question.<eos> It's why she was given protection.<eos> Still, if you could ask.<eos> About yesterday... you know, I really thought Mark knew something that he wasn't telling us, and I stooped to his level, and I shouldn't have...<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Mark Hickman brings out the worst in all of us.<eos> Until we have an arrest, he is a distraction that we don't need.<eos> Well, you'll have no more trouble from me.<eos> Okay, Mike.<eos> Okay.
Probably drunk on our boat.<eos> Why? You weren't with him?<eos> No.<eos> Were you?<eos> Uh... no.<eos> But I did talk to Mark this morning and he told me the day before yesterday the two of you were arguing all afternoon.<eos> If Mark isn't provoking arguments, he's asleep.<eos> So he's just mistaken about the time.<eos> That's all.<eos> Okay.
Bitter.<eos> Captain, a lot of us here knew about Mark and Rachel, but nobody told her.<eos> Sherry left mad.<eos> Came back that way, too.<eos> Now that I've heard everyone out, what I really need to do is get John Barnes back into custody.<eos> He just may be the key to everything.<eos> Barnes was in lockup when Tamika and her child were killed.<eos> Eh, what makes Barnes so special?<eos> Daniel Price paid $10,000 for his bond.<eos> Provenza: All right.
Sharon: Lieutenant Provenza.<eos> [Lowered voice] Uh... yes, Captain.<eos> - We're in place.<eos> - Detective Sanchez.<eos> Sanchez: We're in the viewing room grabbing pics of condolence cards.<eos> If Barnes doesn't show, maybe he sent his respects some other way, ma'am.<eos> Sharon: If you see John Barnes, do not see anything that would alarm him during the service.<eos> We have every entrance and exit to the building covered.<eos> So he's not going anywhere.<eos> Chief Howard?
Sanchez: We're in the viewing room grabbing pics of condolence cards.<eos> If Barnes doesn't show, maybe he sent his respects some other way, ma'am.<eos> Sharon: If you see John Barnes, do not see anything that would alarm him during the service.<eos> We have every entrance and exit to the building covered.<eos> So he's not going anywhere.<eos> Chief Howard?<eos> Fritz: We're sewn up.<eos> - Looks like Barnes is a no-show.<eos> - Any sign of Hickman?<eos> No, not so far.
Put your arm through the window.<eos> Right arm.<eos> Are you taking any medications?<eos> Pills for high blood pressure.<eos> I'm shocked.<eos> Are you an alcoholic?<eos> Nope.<eos> How many drinks do you have a day?<eos> Not enough.<eos> Okay.
I am not getting married during my lunch hour.<eos> I will take care of everything, and I will make it so beautiful, like you. Fill out all of this stuff and get it back to me tomorrow, or we do things my way.<eos> Oh, uh, hi, Patrice.<eos> Lieutenant, if you have a minute, um...<eos> He needs to talk to you.<eos> You just hold on. I was... Louie, tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> - Bye, Buzz.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye, boys.
- Bye.<eos> - Bye, boys.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Bye, Patrice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to... - I didn't mean to interrupt you.<eos> - It's fine. You probably just ruined my whole wedding, but so what?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> - Um...
Your client tells me what he knows about that...<eos> Come on. That's like blackmail.<eos> No, it's like a lifeline.<eos> You're suggesting complete immunity from any and all prosecution, both past and present action?<eos> Oh, no. If he committed no murders, yes.<eos> Buddha, tell us what you did with the car from the Reese murders, or we're gonna deal out your crew, try you on the theft of those auto parts, and make you spend every penny you have defending yourself in court.<eos> Did Emile ever talk to you much about prison?<eos> You think it's a place you'd like to try out for yourself?<eos> Here we go.<eos> [Sigh] Okay, then.
- The one and only.<eos> Goldman also showed up for six other dealers.<eos> Steph, if you could, find out who called Goldman on those occasions.<eos> Tao: Here's a problem, though.<eos> The dope from the motel was cut with baby laxative, not cornstarch.<eos> So it's not a match with the heroin found in Tamika's car.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Now we're talking about two kinds of heroin?<eos> Tamika's doesn't link back to the church?<eos> Provenza: Uh, all right.
Dennis!<eos> You don't understand what you have done.<eos> Dennis Price may be trafficking drugs but he did not kill any of the victims.<eos> Provenza: Now, why do you think that?<eos> Just because he denied it?<eos> No. Because he shot at Jon Barnes several times at close range in a small motel room, and he missed... something our shooter never would have done.<eos> And we're implementing my business plan all across this great, Christian country of ours.<eos> The big brother I grew up with... he would have been proud of what I accomplished.<eos> Proud of you? Proud of you?<eos> Oh, oh, brother.
Visit...<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because it would be harder for him to lie to your face.<eos> And you could find out more about the robbery.<eos> But I thought being your son meant that I couldn't talk to criminals when... when...<eos> Well, if they'd invoked their rights, but Gary has decided to defend himself.<eos> You can ask him anything you want.<eos> And... And can I, um... can I record our conversation?<eos> The county will record it for you.<eos> Okay.
If only we can stop fixating on the days, and start thinking about the years.<eos> Oh, hell, no.<eos> Aw, so cute.<eos> Maybe it's a real old person and they can't help it.<eos> Nah, it's not an accident.<eos> Plus, you gotta be able to squat to poop in a shower, and old people are bad at squatting.<eos> Maybe they're very busy, and they're multitasking.<eos> My sister used to brush her teeth in the shower.<eos> Takin' all the hot water!<eos> Squatter.
- Grab the beast!<eos> Preschool goes for two years, although there is a Mommy and Me class starting at two years old, which I highly recommend.<eos> - Wow. - Two years old, really?<eos> Helps them acclimate.<eos> Plus it gives them a jump<eos> - on the competition. - Competition?<eos> What, in finger painting?<eos> What?<eos> I mean... do you really have to worry about those kind of things at, at two?<eos> Yes, actually.
- What?<eos> - Really?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - Yeah, but she doesn't.<eos> Okay, what's going on? What aren't you telling me?<eos> We don't know, Judy, that's-that's the problem.<eos> Something isn't right.<eos> Vincent. Why couldn't you track him?<eos> Really?<eos> Okay.
- Don't ask.<eos> He doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> You sure Secretary Hill said that Albert worked for Voynov?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Doesn't he? - We can't find any connection.<eos> And it's looking more and more like he was kidnapped by a different person for another reason.<eos> What are we missing?<eos> Why don't you try searching Interpol?<eos> His wife said he travels abroad a lot, maybe there's something there.<eos> Okay.
You know, I knew you would.<eos> So, that was a practice Penny.<eos> What?<eos> You expected me to fail?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Even you expected you to fail.<eos> Okay, well if you think you know me so well, what am I thinking right now?<eos> You're wondering if they're real or not.<eos> Okay, well what am I thinking right now?<eos> - Same thing.
Oh. Oh, never mind, it was just my other hand.<eos> Ah, you're the best Mom ever.<eos> Well, actually, the best Mom would be the one who didn't tell you to smoke a bunch of weed.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Where's the bottle?<eos> - What bottle?<eos> The bottle!<eos> The bottle that is gonna save your career.<eos> Stop that!<eos> All right.
Just whiz into this bottle so your brother will pass his drug test and he can stay on the team.<eos> All right, and then I'll be on my way.<eos> - I just went, I'm all tapped out. - (scoffs)<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Just walk up to some random stranger and ask if I can borrow a cup of pee?<eos> I already tried that.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> What about her?<eos> No.<eos> (grunts) Fine.
Doing anything I'd understand, Mats?<eos> Hacking the Pentagon.<eos> I'll see if they know where the cafetičre is.<eos> Early lecture?<eos> No, I can just get more done in the library.<eos> - Not here.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - We'll get there. - I know.<eos> Do you know where the cafetičre is?<eos> - In a box.
- Bit weird, having a stranger in the house.<eos> - But Albert, with a circular saw, is OK? - Hmm.<eos> What's up?<eos> It just doesn't really feel like a fresh start, does it?<eos> It will. It will. Just give it time.<eos> OK, let's get you dressed...<eos> - Oh. - What?<eos> Just promise me not to become a teenager for a few more weeks.<eos> Where did you find those?<eos> In a box.
Tell me- - Tell me more about this mentoring thing.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> It's very vaginal.<eos> I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think it's my best work -since Hitler's Circumcision. -Mm-hmm.<eos> I don't know if you know, but Hitler's Circumcision is in the private collection of one Mr. Kenny Loggins.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who saw it in Sol's office and bought it on the spot.<eos> I love that story.<eos> The thing is, we want your lube<eos> -in every store in America.
Only you... have a Sol.<eos> How about... something to drink?<eos> I have something.<eos> How about something else?<eos> Frankie...<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Um, what do you mean?<eos> You're thirsty, I'm gonna get you a backup drink.<eos> No, I mean this.<eos> Us.
It slipped through my fingers, but, hey, if it's good enough for Ida Baddadudda, it's good enough for me.<eos> Ugh. My mom's Eliza Doolittle still hasn't shown up, but she's in the lobby and she wants to say hi.<eos> That's great.<eos> We can tell your mom about us.<eos> What is this weird obsession you have with telling people things?<eos> Your mom hired me. She already likes me.<eos> Come on, let's rip off the Band-Aid.<eos> Look, please?<eos> You don't even have to scream into a hallway.<eos> Fine, Tattles.
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I just think I'm gonna blow it.<eos> No, you'll be great.<eos> I'll see you next week.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> ...DJ's exclusive million dollar<eos> I don't know how you work with those people.<eos> What people?<eos> Your patients.
I went to see A.J.<eos> Nice of you.<eos> Hey, so... if you and A.J. are, like, hanging out, dating or whatever, that's... that's fine.<eos> But can we make a deal?<eos> If either of us starts seeing someone, can we just tell each other, okay?<eos> Just so we don't have to find out about it from someone else.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> What did Moms say about Juilliard?<eos> Oh, I actually...
What, they can just let anybody send my... my... my records around town?<eos> No, they have security questions.<eos> They wanted to know your mother's maiden name.<eos> Took me a second, but then I remembered.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> - What?<eos> - Okay, just...<eos> Honey, what did they say?<eos> They want me to come back for an ultrasound, and possibly a biopsy.<eos> Oh, all right.
Leave all this pain behind.<eos> We can be free.<eos> Well, if I was you, I... I don't, I don't know if I could do it. Open up my home to, to runaways.<eos> You ran 600 miles.<eos> I imagine you can do anything.<eos> I ran 'cause I ain't had nothing else.<eos> Nothing to live for except, maybe, the idea of being free.<eos> And if I get it, I ain't gonna do nothing to lose it.<eos> I didn't want to do this.<eos> Not at first.
You gon' tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time?<eos> You gon' tell him?<eos> You ain't shit.<eos> Come on! Let's go!<eos> The fuck y'all lookin' at?<eos> Teresa. Your boyfriend's here.<eos> You talking to me today?<eos> That's alright. I don't wanna talk to you, anyway.<eos> You know she got a crush on you, right?<eos> You all right?
About the only way one of those can get into this sugary wonderland is to lower all the protective wards and shields in the school, letting any old anyone waltz right in.<eos> Welcome back to Brakebills.<eos> Let's go steal their shit.<eos> Careful.<eos> Good.<eos> Daemonium Matarese, ecce vocavi te in carcere liberare mens est.<eos> Imperio Scarlatti telem nobus.<eos> That's the answer?<eos> It shorts out the cerebral cortex, which should break him out of the spell, which should bring him back, halfway.<eos> Halfway?
You mean, like, doing nothing?<eos> No, no, you keep a close eye on things, you have your mammograms and your MRIs twice a year.<eos> Well, that's not exactly an option that Dr. Kopack offered.<eos> - I think the point is that a lot of people hear the word cancer and they can overreact.<eos> You know, this is not an emergency situation.<eos> I just... I think that I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed.<eos> I just... I can't talk about this right now.<eos> If that's okay?<eos> We can talk about it whenever you're ready.<eos> Okay.
- Oh, that looks good... - (coughs)<eos> (mumbles) What... is this thing?<eos> Hey, Mama, do I have to take Shakespeare?<eos> Yes, it's a requirement.<eos> Just like your senior projects.<eos> Have you guys given any thought to what you're gonna do?<eos> But, doesn't my audition for Juilliard count?<eos> Sorry, doesn't work like that.<eos> I'm thinking about doing a photo essay on... something.<eos> On something.
- Me?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Too busy, and... lame.<eos> You go to school on the beach and you don't surf?<eos> - Ha.<eos> Yeah. - You are lame.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, hey, if you ever wanna, you know, learn,<eos> - I could teach you a few things.<eos> - Okay. Uh, yeah.
I know that you don't know what you're going to do yet, but I... There are some things that I think we should talk about as a couple.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, if... if you decide that you need to do something as aggressive as a mastectomy, from what I'm reading, after a surgery like that, a lot of women suffer from depression.<eos> And loss of self-esteem, lack of sex drive.<eos> Mine or yours?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You afraid you're not gonna be attracted to me anymore?<eos> No.<eos> That's not what I'm saying at all.<eos> Okay.
Yes.<eos> Why does that matter?<eos> Your fever might be the sign of a simple infection, but in an old house like this, there could be toxins that might account for your fever, as well as your joint pain and neuropathy.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Arsenic maybe.<eos> It was used in the past to treat wood.<eos> So are you telling me that I don't have rheumatoid arthritis or that I do have it and some other disease?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.
That Raj got the job in Baltimore.<eos> But she's still wait-listed.<eos> Which means we'll be moving to Baltimore whether I get into Johns Hopkins or not.<eos> If you don't get in, you can just reapply, like Rudy.<eos> Rudy Ruettiger.<eos> They made a movie about him.<eos> You've never seen "Rudy"?<eos> Okay, so this guy wanted to play football for Notre Dame so badly that he moved there, worked as a groundskeeper, and kept applying till he got in.<eos> After how long?<eos> - Four years.
Careful<eos> My feet are on the ground<eos> Take your hands off!<eos> Won't you be careful while opening the shutter?<eos> Someone maybe standing out<eos> No concern at all? What if something happens?<eos> Are you okay? Are you hurt?<eos> Hope not<eos> Thankfully no But what if I had been hurt?<eos> Oh! No

♪ This is how we do what we do ♪<eos> - This is incredible.<eos> You are incredible.<eos> You are the one that made it happen.<eos> -Is this it?<eos> -Mmm-hmm. Look, it even has your name on it.<eos> I thought you'd get a kick out of that.<eos> You are the first person in the history of this company who has managed to sell education as a means of control.<eos> -Glasses?<eos> -In the cabinet.
Look, I don't need your help, I know what I'm doing.<eos> Yeah, but it's not working, so let me just help you out a little bit.<eos> -Did you plug it in?<eos> -Yes, Grandma, I plugged it in.<eos> Will you guys just... give me some space.<eos> Just started in electrical and she thinks she can make a homemade speaker.<eos> Your harsh Russian accent is music enough for me.<eos> Hey, Drones, how's tricks?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Yesterday in the hallway with the, uh...
I was told they're used as currency.<eos> Can I have some of them cookies, too?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> Uh, please, help yourself.<eos> This is all right with you, isn't it?<eos> I mean... you're not really into material stuff, right?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> How much would you pay for nails like these?<eos> -On the outside.
Who is that?<eos> They come from all over.<eos> Pocket knife from the Philippines, Vietnamese penlight, matchbook and condoms from China.<eos> Even pirates play it safe sometimes.<eos> But this is the key.<eos> When the pandemic hit, pirates looted the Singaporean reserve bank for gold coins, and this became their currency.<eos> They're the only ones in the region who use it.<eos> Where do they spend it?<eos> Shanzhai.
_<eos> _<eos> He's not so pleased to see you, Tom.<eos> Says you're bad for business.<eos> But he knows why you're here.<eos> Everyone heard about the kidnapping.<eos> He swears he has nothing to do with it.<eos> He knows nothing about it.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> Absolutely not.
We can't be caught with weapons.<eos> Let's bury 'em by the tree line and mark it.<eos> The Nazis giveth, the Sinclair taketh away.<eos> A walking tour of France with Sinclair.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> I'm sure you two will have a... good chat.<eos> I haven't said anything about what happened at the docks<eos> - when I was arrested.<eos> - Say what you have to.<eos> About René?
- You have met my mother,<eos> Jocelyne.<eos> Albert Dugard Jr.,<eos> Inspector of the Vichy Government Police of the French State.<eos> Now, if you were going to kill a man in his own house, I think you would have already done it.<eos> So, now what?<eos> We've got money.<eos> Over 250 francs at your mother's house.<eos> You get us across safely, you can have it all.<eos> Alright.
He broke.<eos> In prison.<eos> He, um... he told me, so I told Sinclair and now I'm telling you.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - It means nothing is safe.<eos> Old contacts, safe houses...<eos> We can't rely on anything we did before.<eos> Well, that's what we were doing anyway.<eos> We always knew we could be compromised, just... didn't figure it would be him.<eos> Hey, you alright?
-Hmm. I know my way in and around an emotion.<eos> You do.<eos> But let's not keep secrets from each other, OK?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> Can we do that again?<eos> In the spirit of not keeping secrets...<eos> I hid your, um, hunting tarp in the slop basin. And I threw the rope in that field over there.<eos> But I don't have much of an arm.<eos> OK, bye.
She runs a woman's group that seems to help some of the gals.<eos> A woman's group? I really don't have the time to exchange housekeeping tips.<eos> This is not that.<eos> We were hoping to start the therapy right away.<eos> Obviously, being unable to obtain an erection is, um...<eos> A difficult situation.<eos> Uh, but there is a process that we follow here.<eos> Dr. Masters and, um, Mrs. Johnson's questionnaire is an important step in that process, as you can see.<eos> And-- And Mrs. Johnson, where is she?<eos> - Vacation.
- Whose fault is that?<eos> Dad, look.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Your mom!<eos> Home sweet home, right?<eos> I don't know about you, but I need a vacation after that vacation.<eos> Marley, can you please get off your phone for 10 minutes? I challenge you.<eos> Stop nagging me.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Back home.
Shit.<eos> Um, how long before someone gets here?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> They're on their way!<eos> They said they'd be here in like two minutes.<eos> Did they go in my room?<eos> It's all right, it's just the TV.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You okay?
Well, hurry up.<eos> We are so late now.<eos> Mom, it's fine!<eos> I'm gonna wait in the car!<eos> The key's in the door!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I set the code for two... two, four, six, right?<eos> - Two, four, six.<eos> - Two, four, six.<eos> Right.
Um, remember, you were going to Sam's tonight, so don't eat too much.<eos> Do you want to go get your stuff together?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good boy.<eos> So Max is heaving dreams about strange men talking to him about Melissa.<eos> Baby, that kid's gonna need so much therapy,<eos> You think you're gonna be able to hook him up with a discount?<eos> There's a pretty good chance he saw his sister's vibrator when he was on his little fact-finding mission.<eos> I thought you were gonna stop thinking about that.<eos> The vibrator?
Officers.<eos> Good.<eos> But they'll have been worked nearly to death.<eos> Malnourished.<eos> If they're gonna help us with the operation...<eos> I know, sir, but we've lost most of our network in France.<eos> These are trained soldiers, motivated to fight.<eos> As soon as Colonel Sinclair returns, we'll start planning.<eos> In the meantime, I want these transmissions sent to London, spaced apart<eos> - in two-hour intervals.
The timing is good.<eos> Trains and aircraft are needed in the East right now.<eos> Thank you, Ernst.<eos> I'm just moving toy trains and planes from one place to another.<eos> It doesn't... doesn't mean anything.<eos> You do what you have to, in difficult times.<eos> - You'll see my boy?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I plan to tell him what you were like as a young man.<eos> - Warts and all?
Let me rephrase.<eos> I won't.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said I won't.<eos> You've been impounded, just like the ship.<eos> You're GA property now, so you will cooperate.<eos> No. I won't.<eos> Obsolete tech is the worst.<eos> First the base programming breaks down, then eventually, the entire system is corrupt.<eos> Okay, fine, fine.
Here's the thing about kids, Herv... they grow up to become adults.<eos> What about the one who lawyered up...<eos> Moss? It's out of our hands.<eos> Somebody else's problem now.<eos> Got it.<eos> It's your lucky day, Kid.<eos> Your transfer just came through.<eos> Transfer where?<eos> You're being placed in a group home down on the planet.<eos> A group home?
What do you make of the case?<eos> I think we are looking for some very dangerous men.<eos> These organ traders have become particularly brazen in recent years.<eos> They pose as aid workers and prey on communities that have been devastated by natural disasters.<eos> People who've lost everything?<eos> Mm. These brokers promise them riches to rebuild their lives, but it never turns out that way.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Don't be afraid to let your neighbor know you are here.<eos> Remind me again, how did you two meet?<eos> 2008, here in Mumbai.
He deserved kindness, but so does he.<eos> They treated my father like he was nothing, worth more dead than alive.<eos> They cut him up like he was not even man, just spare parts, spare parts for the rich.<eos> In death, he shall live again.<eos> Travis, you'll be okay.<eos> Jack.<eos> It's a most important test match.<eos> All right. I'll watch it.<eos> You better.<eos> Later.
We were just waitin' on you to rise.<eos> Well, I'm up! All right? !<eos> I wanna know where them traitors is hiding.<eos> Somewheres on the sunny side, under the crags. That's what I think.<eos> We gonna go talk to Krake.<eos> He knows a lot more than what he's sayin'.<eos> Get off your asses!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Thank you for the call.<eos> - Okay. Bye.
He spent a good amount of time off that mountain.<eos> He's intelligent. He's educated. He's resourceful.<eos> And he is a suspect in the multiple murders that we had here not long ago in Blackburg, and Arson.<eos> We also believe he's implicated in the murder of Breece Dobbs.<eos> We are not gonna be able to arrest this man with force alone.<eos> Okay? We need to convince those people up there to work with us.<eos> So what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk to 'em.<eos> We're gonna go house to house...<eos> Whatever it is they live in.<eos> Spaceship.
Fate will turn in our favour once again.<eos> Fet!<eos> Fetrovsky, wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wiped out a nest of thousands of munchers.<eos> By the time we got to the surface, reinforcements overrunning Central Park.<eos> It was a bloodbath, Professor.<eos> You cannot defeat an army that can regenerate itself every few days, which is why we have to be more creative.<eos> Putting 'em in a box.<eos> Not just a box.
The Master remembers everything.<eos> So, he does still have a plan for me after all.<eos> Is there something wrong with your hand, Eichhorst?<eos> Goodbye, Eldritch.<eos> Enjoy your magnificent view of the downfall of New York City and the world.<eos> Mr. Duncan.<eos> Get whatever manpower you need.<eos> We're going to take that ship.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> All right!
We've been working all week to shave time off this process.<eos> I think you're going to be very pleased.<eos> Shut it off!<eos> What is this?<eos> This?<eos> This is...<eos> This is what we've been using to test the system's capabilities.<eos> This dummy is exactly 175 pounds, the weight of an average - It's helped us get the whole process down to just 84 seconds.<eos> Are you saying that, in your opinion, there is no notable difference between a person and a bag of sand?<eos> For our purposes?
What system?<eos> _<eos> Then why do they want you to fill this out?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Yeah, I can't do this.<eos> This place gives me the heebie-jeebies.<eos> _<eos> No, you come meet me.<eos> All right?
You'll only draw attention.<eos> In the meantime, make yourself useful and get us some more information.<eos> I fully intend to.<eos> But I'd appreciate a little more respect.<eos> The worm has turned, Eldritch.<eos> If you want more white, you've got to earn that respect.<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> - Palmer has everything to lose - _ by betraying us.<eos> I don't trust the man, but I trust his self-preservation.<eos> Fair enough.
Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo?<eos> He did better than that.<eos> He led us right to the facility where they were keeping it.<eos> On East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx.<eos> That ring a bell?<eos> You knew its purpose.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A slaughterhouse for harvesting human beings.<eos> How many of these blood farms are there?<eos> In North America?
All right, people.<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> There's three in the gatehouse. According to your man Borgen, there's more inside.<eos> Are you sure you can take it?<eos> They're rent-a-cops, sir.<eos> This level of security, it's more than likely that your cargo is still inside.<eos> Then what are we waiting for?<eos> Your final order, sir.<eos> Are we a go? Yes, you are.<eos> All right then.
Plenty of sunlight to keep us safe.<eos> This kind of reminds me of when we were spying on Palmer.<eos> Except he was speaking English.<eos> Out loud.<eos> Always the technicalities with you.<eos> If they're talking, we will hear them.<eos> The question is, will we hear the Master talking back?<eos> We just need to look for anomalies, anything that breaks the established communication patterns.<eos> You never rendered your opinion on Captain Rogers.<eos> - Who?
Command, up north! It's a goddamn flood!<eos> Why don't you surrender, Dr. Goodweather?<eos> Do you truly believe there is a grand design predicated upon human dominance?<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> As a scientist and a man of medicine, you know such matters are not left to the whim of divinity but are the result of sheer force.<eos> The strongest will prevail.<eos> - Your wife and your child call to you.<eos> - We can't stop fighting.<eos> - Get that rooftop camera - from the Met for me.<eos> - On your screen now.
Now, you can take these recordings to court and try and nail these fuckers, but you'll get roasted on cross and you'll end up sucking dick in prison right next to them.<eos> Unless I can get one of them to flip.<eos> What did I teach you in class?<eos> Who has the most to lose... and who do I want more?<eos> - I'll be pulling up at Truth in five minutes.<eos> I'll see you on the inside, Dominique.<eos> - All right, boss.<eos> Don't forget we have VIP--<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Okay, bye.
It's just you left quite a few holes in Felipe Lobos.<eos> Cut the shit.<eos> I know Tommy Egan killed Ruiz, and I know the two of you killed Lobos together.<eos> Didn't do it alone though, did you?<eos> Angela was your inside man.<eos> Give her up, I'll get you a deal.<eos> If you had anything on me, I'd be in the back of your little car by now.<eos> You can threaten me, you can lie to me, rough me up.<eos> I'm not giving you a single reason to bring me in.<eos> All right.
You told me that before.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> And you don't know me.<eos> Yet I want to tell you my most terrible secret.<eos> - Do you want to hear it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I can share your burden.<eos> I am small, but I have broad shoulders and I am not afraid.<eos> I will tell you when you tell me the truth about your father.<eos> All right.
Not just for the sake of fighting, but for the beauty of it.<eos> And against the Christians, yes.<eos> I hate the Christians.<eos> In the name of Odin, I would kill them all.<eos> You'll have the opportunity to kill a great number of them once we reach Paris.<eos> Faster!<eos> They'll be wondering where you are.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Paris.
It's not your fault.<eos> Everything is all right.<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> What is that?<eos> Can I see?<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> I took it from someone.<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> What about?
Everything is all right.<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> What is that?<eos> Can I see?<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> I took it from someone.<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> What about?<eos> Us.
My family.<eos> The ruined, corrupt, decadent dregs of a once illustrious name.<eos> And you shelter for your own purposes another of my mad descendants.<eos> Kwenthrith, whose only claim to the throne rests in the murder of her own uncle and two of her own brothers.<eos> I do not shelter her out of any love for her person, but because I thought she might be a stabilizing factor.<eos> The last thing I needed was a chaotic neighbor.<eos> If you ever supposed that Kwenthrith could play a calming, stabilizing role in this madhouse we call Mercia, then you are as mad as the rest of them.<eos> However, I doubt it.<eos> I know your ambitions. And to the point. You proposed this meeting.<eos> To what end?
Sigurd!<eos> - Let him go.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> I want to tell him that I love him.<eos> He has the wrong idea.<eos> I love all of you.<eos> My Lord, I trust you are well rested after such great exertions.<eos> Forgive me, I had to come and see you.<eos> We have important matters to discuss between us.<eos> Indeed.
Who, at this hour, is also trying to protect. This place of worship. And all these christian people.<eos> Bowmen, to your stations!<eos> Ready! First rank!<eos> Loose!<eos> Loose arrows!<eos> Second rank! Loose!<eos> Third rank! Loose!<eos> Loose!<eos> Fourth rank!<eos> Ready!
Otto.<eos> Otto.<eos> - Arthur.<eos> - Yes, Mary.<eos> After I leave, lock the doors.<eos> Yes, Mary.<eos> I'll be watching, Otto.<eos> All you have to do is tell me about Albert Lin.<eos> That is all you have to do.<eos> Arthur.
Alexa.<eos> Yes, Mary?<eos> Can you please knock on Otto's door and ask him if he's hungry?<eos> When he gets like this, he forgets to eat.<eos> Otto's not here, Mary.<eos> Well, I'm watching him on the feed.<eos> Well, he's not in his office.<eos> He left shortly after you did.<eos> It's a loop.<eos> Arthur?
When he gets like this, he forgets to eat.<eos> Otto's not here, Mary.<eos> Well, I'm watching him on the feed.<eos> Well, he's not in his office.<eos> He left shortly after you did.<eos> It's a loop.<eos> Arthur?<eos> Where's Otto?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> Arthur.
He has Gracie!<eos> Or did you miss that part?<eos> You're not gonna get close to a guy like Connor, even with a badge.<eos> He's surrounded by security and lawyers.<eos> You need a warrant just to get in the door.<eos> A warrant?<eos> And what do I tell the judge, that Connor Graff kidnapped my daughter because she has something in her DNA that lets her get regenerated like my dad?<eos> I said you'd need a warrant. I didn't say anything about a judge.<eos> I need to print...<eos> on paper.
Without the proper care, many self-medicate.<eos> Based on data from our users, 83% of those with an IQ higher than 150 use some form of medication.<eos> Yeah, but heroin.<eos> Searching for prodigies O.D.ing on heroin.<eos> Should I show you the others in this geographical area? Others?<eos> What others?<eos> Margo Mallory.<eos> Cellist.<eos> Julian Edlun. Linguist.<eos> Fluent in eight languages.
Halfway through the project, he just stopped showing up, so...<eos> Ta-da!<eos> Me. I replaced him.<eos> He was weird, angry.<eos> Not a people person, even for a coder.<eos> Malcolm Sprague filed six lawsuits against Lookinglass in the last year in the amount of $50 million for a copyright violation, breach of contract, pain and suffering, and personal distress caused by "the bitch Mary Goodwin."<eos> I'm pretty sure "bitch" isn't a legal term.<eos> This is our guy.<eos> You'll have the search warrant by the time you hit Malcolm Sprague's door.<eos> Stairs! Down!
Did he leave a message for me?<eos> He said please don't forget to feed his fish... and thank you.<eos> Goodbye, Mary.<eos> You there?<eos> You seeing it?<eos> I'm seeing something.<eos> I'm not sure what it is, but I think you should come in.<eos> Do I need to bring a lawyer? No.<eos> Let's keep it between us for now.<eos> Okay.
that's what I want.<eos> That can't happen... now.<eos> Adair knows.<eos> She'll be watching me.<eos> So I'm gonna tell her you died in that plane.<eos> So you can't come around us.<eos> Could you just let me say hi to Gracie?<eos> Not for a while, okay?<eos> It'll be best for all of us.<eos> Yeah, okay.
I'm calling Security.<eos> It's okay, Alexa.<eos> I see you've met my guest.<eos> Oh... yes.<eos> So sorry.<eos> I am here because I brought you the research reports for your conference call that you have later.<eos> And I did that. So now I can go.<eos> And it was so nice to meet you.<eos> And you have that, and I'm going.<eos> So... bye.
See if you can find something.<eos> Okay if we sit?<eos> Yes, just not in my chair.<eos> Which is your chair?<eos> All of them.<eos> What can you tell me about transgenic mutation?<eos> You're the one who said those words when you were standing outside.<eos> Yeah, but it involves Pritchard, right?<eos> What can you tell me about him?<eos> About Jimmy Pritchard?
About Jimmy Pritchard?<eos> Nothing.<eos> A guy in your position doesn't usually surround himself with people he doesn't know.<eos> I don't surround myself with any people.<eos> You and your sister are very close.<eos> You mean to tell me you don't know anything about the guy she's out with right now?<eos> I didn't say I didn't know anything.<eos> I said I couldn't tell you anything.<eos> Where did you learn to box? Army.<eos> Saigon.
For God's sakes, Asher.<eos> Please tell me this isn't you.<eos> Sorry. I wish I could.<eos> Now be a good father and clean it up for me.<eos> Interesting spot to meet.<eos> I picked somewhere I knew we'd never run into anyone.<eos> I've been meaning to come down here and pay my respects.<eos> We're not here to pay our respects to him, are we?<eos> No. We're here because I want the truth... about you.<eos> About him.
Now, uh... I see he was right.<eos> Man, I screwed that up royally.<eos> My son's pissed off, my daughter's got a broken heart, and that guy on TV's just laughing at me.<eos> Right in what way? People need to pay for... for what they've done.<eos> My time in prison has taught me to be strong, to be able to face the truth.<eos> Without justice...<eos> Everyone here looks so angry at me, like I'm some public enemy.<eos> I served my time.<eos> But you're on parole, which I'm about to violate and send you back.<eos> On what grounds?
Six, right out on the street this time.<eos> Reese and his Jalisco brothers won this round.<eos> Chan is M.I.A.<eos> This turf war is escalating.<eos> Hey. These six were Chan Lee's bodyguards.<eos> Lee entered the Seattle heroin market just a month ago.<eos> D.C.'s leaning on me to clean this mess up.<eos> The doctor wants some good news, so I want you to work this until you can get me some.<eos> Father and son on their way home.<eos> Wrong place, wrong time.
Yeah. Yeah, this is Garret.<eos> Garret, this is my Aunt Helen.<eos> Nice to meet you, my Aunt Helen.<eos> You can call me Helen.<eos> So, how do you two, uh, know each other?<eos> Oh, we met at school.<eos> You're in high school?<eos> Uh, no, Garret is 20.<eos> Which is older.<eos> So, in college?
I'm a woman.<eos> I can tell these things.<eos> You should tell Duval.<eos> Mr. Brown,<eos> Ms. Solodar's expecting you.<eos> Go right up to the penthouse.<eos> How you doing, fellas?<eos> I know you?<eos> 100 grand.<eos> Good faith.
I said if you liked poker, you should come down here.<eos> I never said there was gonna be a game.<eos> Cory. Didn't he tell you to stay away from the coke and cards?<eos> Who are you?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> The same way we know Joan Solodar lost a lot of money making it look like Lenny ran her drug business.<eos> But she has more money, doesn't she?<eos> And you know where it is.<eos> Hey, we need to talk about the money.<eos> The usual place.
I'd like to believe you are.<eos> What... what... what do you mean you'd "like" to believe me?<eos> Duval, didn't you see what we just did here?<eos> No, I don't want to hear you'd "like" to believe me.<eos> You better believe me!<eos> Life is messy, Gracie.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> But we do the best we can, and... we forgive each other when we come up short.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah. Okay.
I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> Wait, a-are you worried about me being jealous? Otto, y-you know what your sister and I have is an understanding.<eos> Yes, it is a non-emotional, sexually reciprocal arrangement.<eos> So you don't have to worry about me being jealous when I find out she's in love.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because I'm happy for her.<eos> Like you are.<eos> And I'm proud of you for being happy for her.<eos> That's empathy right there. Good for you. You're happy Mary's in love with Pritchard.<eos> With Pritchard?
You wanted a best-seller.<eos> - I'll tell you the plot as we walk.<eos> Here she is.<eos> Picture of Aryan perfection.<eos> And... this.<eos> It's a good cover.<eos> A woman alone in Paris.<eos> A widow.<eos> Keeps it real.<eos> All right.
Please.<eos> You're a source for hope.<eos> And I have "patients" who could use your help.<eos> There's been a misunderstanding.<eos> I'm going to ask you to leave.<eos> Oh, we didn't order dessert.<eos> Rote Grutze.<eos> You and your husband were kind enough to be our guests last month.<eos> If you enjoy this special offering, please tell your husband.<eos> And others.
- Understood.<eos> - You?<eos> - Working will help.<eos> Clock?<eos> - Plus 37 minutes.<eos> - First landing?<eos> - 04:50.<eos> Everything today is in real time.<eos> I need you<eos> - on top of those relays.
- "To replace the men we lost.<eos> - Thank you, Sinclair."<eos> Who?<eos> - How many?<eos> - Fourteen men.<eos> A detachment from the Royal Winnipeg Sabers.<eos> They'll break off at Green beach, and meet up with us here, before these fields, just outside Pour-De-Lys.<eos> So what's next?<eos> Like you said... there's going to be thousands with bigger troubles.<eos> Okay.
It used to be a hotel.<eos> I saw the floorplans.<eos> Keep watch 10 minutes,<eos> - then get somewhere safe.<eos> - No. I promised her<eos> - I'd take care of you.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> She wants you safe.<eos> - I keep you safe.<eos> - Okay.
Stay inside.<eos> Move!<eos> Move, move.<eos> Stay inside. Stay inside.<eos> Get inside.<eos> There's a sharpshooter in the church.<eos> - Shooting soldiers.<eos> - Show me where!<eos> He went in there.<eos> In the tower.
Move!<eos> Move, move.<eos> Stay inside. Stay inside.<eos> Get inside.<eos> There's a sharpshooter in the church.<eos> - Shooting soldiers.<eos> - Show me where!<eos> He went in there.<eos> In the tower.<eos> Up there!
They're all pinned down at the seawall.<eos> Do we have anything more recent?<eos> It's hard to find a radio man still alive on the beach.<eos> Communication's broken down.<eos> They're sending reinforcements<eos> - straight into machine gun fire.<eos> - Is there a boat in contact<eos> - with the beach?<eos> - Sir, Aurora's team is requesting a message go out so the Germans can hear.<eos> Okay.
You know, 50% die in the first 6 weeks.<eos> How the hell have we stayed alive this long?<eos> Blind luck.<eos> Good breeding.<eos> I'm storming the castle.<eos> I'm not going to order you to do the same.<eos> Decide for yourselves.<eos> You've earned that.<eos> - You know what I'm thinking about?<eos> - What?
Then maybe you shouldn't just go around killing people, then!<eos> I was protecting Britnay!<eos> Yeah well, it didn't work. Did it, Slade?<eos> Mom?<eos> Danny's here.<eos> Mom!<eos> Yeah, this is a personal thing.<eos> I'm asking for a favor.<eos> - Hey, Slade.<eos> - You alright?
Harry Dempsey.<eos> Works for Porter.<eos> Well... worked.<eos> So where is Harry Dempsey now?<eos> Laying low, I'd imagine.<eos> Is that him?<eos> It's an age progression image.<eos> Well, they never really look like anyone, do they?<eos> I mean it's possible, but...<eos> On the whole...
And then he brings Nico up.<eos> When you bring children into the equation, it changes everything.<eos> I really need to talk to you about something.<eos> I'm so sorry, I'm on call.<eos> That's OK.<eos> It's not OK. 'Coz it means I have to go.<eos> That's fine, I have to do something this afternoon.<eos> What time do you finish?<eos> I'll come and meet you.<eos> 19:00.
Don't inhale the smoke.<eos> I can't have another dead monarch on my hands.<eos> Open up!<eos> In the name of the regent!<eos> Yes?<eos> May I enter?<eos> Do I have a choice?<eos> You're regent.<eos> Which is why I'm here.<eos> In service of my new position.
Catherine must have located the oil of vitriol that I planted in her chambers.<eos> And Lord Narcisse had no choice but to open the inquest after I presented him with the poisoned liver.<eos> Once we learned of the princess' diary, I...<eos> I thought the queen mother was surely doomed.<eos> And yet, she walks free.<eos> None could foresee that she would dare to exhume the king's body.<eos> Please.<eos> I can find another way to help you bring down the Valois.<eos> I'll see that the group considers your offer.<eos> In the meantime...
It's the word you used when you said things like, "I hate Grace."<eos> Thank God I could vent about her on our walks.<eos> You know, she vented about you, too, sunshine.<eos> -When?<eos> -You did a lot of walking.<eos> -I did.<eos> -My ass looked good then.<eos> -Your ass looks good now.<eos> So, how's Grace been managing with all this drama?<eos> Like a champ.
-No.<eos> And I've got watermelon.<eos> It's everyone's favorite low-calorie food.<eos> Basically celery in a Lilly Pulitzer dress.<eos> Can we move on to step two so I can say no to that?<eos> Step two: art therapy.<eos> -No.<eos> -I soaked you an extra lump of clay.<eos> I just want to get into my bed... and watch that show where terrible people buy tiny houses.<eos> All right.
Thank you for going "Mm" when you know it's cashew-cheese lasagna.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, it's just...<eos> All I can see is you hunched over there after the heart attack.<eos> And I haven't been able to sit there since the night you told me about Frankie.<eos> Maybe we should eat in the dining room?<eos> Where Grace and I told our daughters I was leaving her?<eos> -That was a fun brunch.<eos> -Right.<eos> How about the sun room?
Where you almost bludgeoned me with a toilet plunger?<eos> It's this whole house, isn't it?<eos> But it's your house.<eos> But it's never been ours.<eos> I was happier this morning with you in that dump.<eos> -You want to go back?<eos> -No, no.<eos> But I think we should call a realtor in the morning. That's... an exciting idea.<eos> But where do we actually eat tonight's dinner?<eos> -At a restaurant. -Mm!
Your father talks about you all the time.<eos> I'm gonna get myself changed, and then I'm all yours.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Okay, go play with your toys.<eos> Raina, let me talk to you for a minute.<eos> Come on, Yas. You can play with your toys right here.<eos> Listen, kids,<eos> I know it's hard, but I want us to really try, okay?<eos> All right?
I'll break the door if you don't open!<eos> Open up!<eos> Why do you change the seat suddenly?<eos> Do you wanna stay away from me?<eos> Did I do anything wrong?<eos> Do you know how upset I am?<eos> Go back.<eos> I'm not leaving, unless you answer me.<eos> I don't have the mood to talk about this now.<eos> After the college entrance examination, okay?
Your current level will definitely get you into a regular university in Beijing.<eos> Su Yunjin.<eos> Be my girlfriend!<eos> Su Yunjin, go to Beijing with me!<eos> Su Yunjin, be with me together!<eos> Now, the whole world is aware of my thoughts, you can't say no.<eos> I understand your thoughts.<eos> So we...<eos> Good night! Cheng Zheng.<eos> Goodbye!

Look at the rain.<eos> Your phone.<eos> Su Yunjin.<eos> Have you found a job?<eos> No.<eos> I have an interview opportunity here, do you want to try?<eos> What kind of company?<eos> It happens to match with our specialty of study.<eos> Originally, it's someone I know who introduced me to it. But as I'm going to study aboard, a vacancy is available. Then I give it to you.<eos> In Beijing?

Evan, the situation is dire enough as it is.<eos> Wouldn't you agree?<eos> Concealing it or... even the appearance of concealing it can only aggravate it and me further.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> Crystal.<eos> Come on, Rosie, come on.<eos> Get the Frisbee.<eos> So is the coffee okay?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Absolutely okay.
"They have to" seems a little imperative.<eos> But...<eos> I guess we could stay another night.<eos> Good!<eos> Good.<eos> Then we'll see you at the party.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll bring a cheese ball.<eos> - I'll bring her. - Ha ha ha!<eos> All right, bye.
"Am I gonna make it through this?"<eos> That's what makes us feel alive.<eos> Isn't there a part of you that misses that?<eos> Sure, sure, sometimes, but let's deal with you first.<eos> You can't do the stunt. And you can say that, but I'm doing the stunt.<eos> - Rachel, I'm telling you...<eos> - Look... this is really important to me and my dad and my brother.<eos> So unless you put me in a straitjacket... which actually wouldn't work, 'cause I know how to get out of one...<eos> I'm doing the stunt.<eos> All right.
Ow!<eos> Yeah, that's from my face-plant last week.<eos> Okay.<eos> So is all your fainting.<eos> What?<eos> That face-plant resulted in a fracture that trapped your trigeminal nerve, so now when you put pressure on your eyeball, it's creating an oculocardiac reflex, dropping your heart rate.<eos> So when I put my contacts in, it slowed my heart down? Yeah.<eos> And this time, it almost didn't speed up again.<eos> Can you untrap the nerve?<eos> In the hospital, yeah.
She's having trouble delivering the initial puppy because of its abnormal presentation...<eos> it's tail first.<eos> It's called dystocia.<eos> She should go to a vet.<eos> Or maybe you can manipulate the puppies digitally.<eos> Everything's digital now.<eos> She means using my fingers.<eos> But I would need you to kneel down and hold the ultrasound, which seems unlikely, in light of... your girth.<eos> I-I'm totally capable of bending over.<eos> Okay, fine.
But I would need you to kneel down and hold the ultrasound, which seems unlikely, in light of... your girth.<eos> I-I'm totally capable of bending over.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> It's not happening.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I got it.<eos> - I can do it. - Uh...<eos> I can do this.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> - All right, um...
- No!<eos> - We can get something else.<eos> - But you want it.<eos> Yeah, but I wouldn't be able to finish it on my own.<eos> Go on, get it.<eos> Don't listen to me.<eos> I... no, listen, I don't need it.<eos> We'll do something else.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.
It belonged to the Connavers?<eos> They use it to get into Arkyn. - Why do you want it?<eos> - My partner.<eos> He's trapped down there.<eos> He needs my help.<eos> I don't think there are any bullets in that gun. Why's that?<eos> 'Cause you would have shot your chain by now.<eos> This is what you're looking for.<eos> Connavers implanted their shield in me so I'd guard it.<eos> Why you?
For a human.<eos> Strange time for a manicure.<eos> I'm connecting with the beta system.<eos> That's some multi-tasking green shit you got there.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> There.<eos> All traces of you are gone.<eos> Happy? Oh, this is definitely my happy face.<eos> I saw that symbol.<eos> In my dreams.
What if you've been wrong this whole time, Dutch?<eos> What if Khlyen isn't your real enemy, but he's protecting you from who really is?<eos> I'm not ready to believe that.<eos> Whatever the RAC are doing on Arkyn, whatever their plan is for Level VI, Khlyen is still a part of it.<eos> So are you.<eos> You've never been on Arkyn before today, right? Of course not.<eos> None of us have.<eos> Why?<eos> I saw something else.<eos> In that... memory...
Do not get on that airplane. Wait, okay?<eos> I'll be right there. I'm on my way.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I'm here. Okay?<eos> - She's at the airport.<eos> - Go.<eos> I'm sorry. I gotta go.<eos> Guys, sorry.<eos> All right.
Odile?<eos> Come here a minute.<eos> Please answer the Inspector's questions.<eos> Do you sleep in the apartment? No.<eos> I'm on the sixth floor.<eos> With all the other servants of the house, sir.<eos> Was it late when you went up last night?<eos> It was...nine o'clock.<eos> And where was this gentleman?<eos> In his study.
So he's not a qualified architect?<eos> As I understand it, anyone can call themselves a decorator.<eos> He's not a failure, Inspector.<eos> Does he have many clients for his decorating?<eos> He prefers not to have many.<eos> He...is discerning.<eos> Were you born in Paris?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> In Montmartre.
I was not in Montmartre two days ago.<eos> And that woman... could not identify me.<eos> Chief, Cameliau's brought in Lefors.<eos> Do they know where I am?<eos> Go over the dates of the murders with him again.<eos> Try and place him in Montmartre.<eos> Tramp found the jacket early this morning.<eos> Doesn't know how long it's been there.<eos> Where was it found?<eos> Down by the river.
- What city?<eos> - In Bucharest.<eos> Yeah, I studied there and after that I... - And what did you study? - I used to be an accountant.<eos> - Accountant?<eos> Louise is recovering from an operation.<eos> - Okay.
You really haven't been trying, have you?<eos> I promise to make amends.<eos> Your dad led the initial investigation into Jesse's disappearance.<eos> Have you checked his old case files?<eos> Where are the files?<eos> - Tough day?<eos> - Just get me drunk.<eos> I hope we're watching this together. Laughing.<eos> Somewhere sunny.<eos> Australia, maybe.

Laughing.<eos> Somewhere sunny.<eos> Australia, maybe.<eos> Or Florida.
You had me follow this trail and you knew exactly where it was gonna lead. You had all the answers and you pretended you didn't.<eos> Why, why would you do that?<eos> Who did you send?<eos> I saw you with Porter, and... You wanted to kill him.<eos> And that's what happens, Mark.<eos> And I can't...<eos> I don't want you becoming me.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Means I'm not gonna lose you, Mark, OK? I can't.<eos> You alright?
I was applying for a loan.<eos> For the automatic house, sir?<eos> A man's banking is his own business, Crabtree.<eos> So what have we, Murdoch?<eos> $30 000 is missing from the vault.<eos> But as the doors lock when the alarm sounds, the thief and the money are still inside the bank.<eos> Crikey, it's all mothers and babies.<eos> - How big is thirty thousand?<eos> - How big?<eos> What denominations?
The new stadium is down the street from my house.<eos> You must be kicking yourself, lad.<eos> Black and blue.<eos> If I'd known they'd be up for the championship I'd have never left.<eos> - Bloody kills me that I'm missing it.<eos> - Aye.<eos> Right then, sir. You're free to go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oh, I'll see you around, lad.<eos> - Maybe for a pint. - Ah!
I just thought I should bring them back down to the Station in case one the mothers wanted to claim them.<eos> That's fine, George.<eos> - Crabtree.<eos> - Detective!<eos> Inspector!<eos> Mr. Mortimer.<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost!<eos> It wasn't the money they were after.<eos> It was the plates.<eos> - The plates?
- And bouncing! - (baby laugh)<eos> You were in the teller's cage when a woman demanded to speak with you.<eos> That was me.<eos> So you exited the teller's cage<eos> - and spoke to these two women.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then, please explain how you came to be facing the other way, toward the teller cage door?<eos> I...<eos> The man...<eos> At the door.
- So I know what a branding guru does, - Mm-hm. but, um, maybe you should explain it to everyone else.<eos> I'm not sure they know.<eos> I make old things relevant. What?<eos> What did he just say?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Yes.<eos> Fun!<eos> So I'm gonna leave you guys to really get into it.<eos> And think of Pache as a part of the family.<eos> - But the dad. Okay.
This place looks so expensive.<eos> - Yeah. - Hey, buddy.<eos> Look, it's my treat, all right?<eos> Look, I take care of you, you take care of the show.<eos> And that's how this works, huh?<eos> - O... kay. - (cellphone vibrates) - Whoa.<eos> - Uh, that's Kermit asking where we are.<eos> - Oh, boy. Oh.<eos> Well, uh... well, just tell him that we couldn't reply because we were in a tunnel. - Uh-huh. - Oh.<eos> A cashmere tunnel. - Oh! - (laughter)
I am working on an album now.<eos> It's called "Piggy 25.<eos> " you know, give or take.<eos> Okay, you haven't gotten one right yet, animal.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> "I hate when women wear the wrong foundation color.<eos> It might be the worst thing on the planet. "<eos> - Kardashian?<eos> - That's right! Ah!<eos> Yeah, yeah! All right! Oh!
He's not available right now - I was hoping to speak to Maigret.<eos> If you sit and speak to me, I will relay everything you say to the Chief Inspector.<eos> If it's of importance.<eos> But it is important, that's why I need to speak to him.<eos> I saw the cream-and-blue car.<eos> The car that's in the paper?<eos> The car that's in the paper.<eos> This one.<eos> And where did you see the car?<eos> In my house.
When did you see it?<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> Wednesday night, the night in the paper.<eos> And there was definitely a seven and a five in the registration because I have grandchildren of seven and five.<eos> Marianne's favourite colour<eos> - Did you see anyone get out of the car?<eos> Yes, I saw a gentleman.<eos> Well, he wasn't really a gentleman, he was rather big.<eos> What time did you see the man arrive?<eos> Nine o'clock.
Did he sleep with her as well?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And sometimes... ..after he was here,<eos> they'd go away for a night, and they'd come back flush with cash.<eos> Did they have a car?<eos> Well, they had a van parked up somewhere, I don't know where.<eos> What dates did they go away?<eos> I don't know.<eos> October 8th,<eos> September...21st, um...
No.<eos> And he had a cafe owner called Albert Rochain murdered because he thought Albert was about to expose him for what he really was.<eos> How can a man sleep as calmly as Jean if he has done the things you say he has?<eos> He is like many men, some who commit crimes and some who don't,<eos> he lived a life where other people were not people.<eos> They were just "things".<eos> And this is the file that contains details of what your boyfriend and his accomplices did...<eos> ..in order to steal the things that you're wearing.<eos> You'll be seeing more of me over the next few weeks, Maigret.<eos> Indeed.
2%.<eos> Tests on the components in your blood show the Speed Force at a 100% for the last 60 days until today, it dropped to 98.<eos> Zoom stole Jay's speed.<eos> Do you think maybe, during your fight with Zoom, yours might have diminished?<eos> But that was weeks ago.<eos> Why would I just be feeling those effects now?<eos> Yeah. You've studied the Speed Force more than anyone.<eos> What do you think could have happened?<eos> It could be any number of things.<eos> Yeah. All right.
I think it may not matter.<eos> Hey, I caught that documentary of yours online.<eos> The yodeling one.<eos> What was it called?<eos> - Yodeling.<eos> - Right. It was good.<eos> Although it just kind of ends.<eos> Well, it's unfinished.<eos> What's your next one about?<eos> Melanesian choirs.
Yeah. Still getting back on my feet after the divorce.<eos> I'll bet it's hard to seal the deal when the key to your house is the wide button on a clicker.<eos> I do tend to lose 'em coming around - the side gate.<eos> - I'll bet you do.<eos> Maybe what you need is a change of address, my friend.<eos> Allison, it's your turn to share.<eos> Come on.<eos> Has it been hard to get back out there after the whole Evan fiasco?<eos> How he cheated on you. With your best friend.<eos> - In your own house...
Did you talk to him?<eos> No, but almost.<eos> It's been a year!<eos> Mom keeps asking when you're getting back out there.<eos> I signed up for an online-dating site for the Deaf.<eos> Look at you!<eos> No. There are four men in the whole area.<eos> Do not want.<eos> Miss the city yet?<eos> Never.
Well, she and her husband were also having some problems. And he was working all the time, coming home later and later.<eos> And then eventually she followed him one night.<eos> And she caught him in a hotel with his secretary.<eos> - That's horrible.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But Franz would never...<eos> No. He wouldn't do something like that.<eos> Well, that's exactly what my cousin said.<eos> No. I know he had a ticket to a concert tonight.<eos> At ThéÃ¢tre de I'Opéra.
They see us as beacons of hope, and we will behave ourselves accordingly.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Remember who you're paired with.<eos> That is all.<eos> Still the Wild West.<eos> I want the CIC fully manned, all eyes peeled.<eos> Yes, sir. Rally point's set.<eos> If you're not home by 23:30, we'll send the cavalry.<eos> Very well.
Surface, where are those boats?<eos> Still in formation, sir, but they've diverted.<eos> They're heading around the bend here, toward Bach Dang River.<eos> There's no way a tanker's getting up that river.<eos> No, but they could anchor in this inlet.<eos> Why do that when there's a deep water harbor here?<eos> I think they're hiding.<eos> I concur.<eos> We should radio the C.O.<eos> No, not on an open line.
Do you want us to wait while you delete some pictures?<eos> -Would you?<eos> -What is this face telling you?<eos> Bye.<eos> OK. Frankie, I can tell you're very upset.<eos> So, let's just take a breath.<eos> Let's sit down. Let's talk about this.<eos> Great.<eos> Now you want your lube in every grocery store in America, right?<eos> And some of the more progressive car washes, yes. OK.
Now you want your lube in every grocery store in America, right?<eos> And some of the more progressive car washes, yes. OK.<eos> Well, products like this can end up sitting on a shelf for a year.<eos> And they need a little help to keep from spoiling.<eos> Do you know how fast yams go bad?<eos> -Yes, six months.<eos> -No.<eos> Then, no.<eos> Do you want to explain to the Good Stuff people why your lube has a shelf life of three to five weeks?<eos> In a darkened room?
Do you wanna ask him?<eos> - My client wants to...<eos> - I heard.<eos> Dorothy and James.<eos> Alright.<eos> Let's talk about this phone.<eos> Can you tell us how this iPhone5 registered to a Ms. Annie Green came into your possession?<eos> I found it. You found it?<eos> Where?<eos> At that Lebanese restaurant.
You scared a year off my life.<eos> Security cameras.<eos> A locked passage gate.<eos> A swing-set.<eos> Well let's go around the front, see if anyone's in.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.<eos> We're police.<eos> DS Kenwood, DC Cain.<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions about your neighbor?<eos> About him?
You mean download it.<eos> It was a glib remark, Ally.<eos> I didn't realize it had to be contemporary.<eos> We should get a warrant.<eos> Especially after that balls-up with Hanley.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> Alright, let's go back, get it signed-off.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Jay Newman?<eos> The one and only.
It's all gonna fall to shit.<eos> Norman, what's your... what's your doctor's name?<eos> Can I call him?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, you know what, Dylan?<eos> I'm... I'm just upset.<eos> I, uh... all is good, actually.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Never mind, Dylan.<eos> Okay. All right, bye.
Are you serious? I just said it to get out of an awkward situation, but, actually, now that I think about it, yeah, that would be a really good way to get you out of my hair.<eos> Okay, that is officially the grossest thing I have ever heard.<eos> Me and Bobby? ! I mean, we played together as children!<eos> She's like a sister!<eos> And not the kind of sister you marry.<eos> Yeah, look, I know it's hard to see people in a different light.<eos> Unless someone comes up with a ridiculous plan to force you together.<eos> Apropos of nothing, why don't we all go for dinner tonight, hmm?<eos> Somewhere candlelit.<eos> Hmm. So...
Something change?<eos> It's been a while since we done this is all.<eos> Yeah, well, there's a reason for that.<eos> - Look, Mark, I'm...<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> Trying to keep my head down.<eos> I shouldn't have lost my cool.<eos> I don't even wanna know.<eos> Megan and I, we went to dinner the other night.<eos> Date night.
You're the reason I made it this far in my fight against Zoom, and now I just need you to hang on.<eos> Hang on a little bit longer because...<eos> I'm coming to get you, and this time... I'm not coming alone.<eos> Uhh, that's how it's done.<eos> - Whoo. He shoots. He scores.<eos> Not bad for a guy who got a C in gym.<eos> D plus.<eos> Straight up F right here.<eos> Can't believe it. We closed all the breaches.<eos> All except the one.
That's always been the direction that you've run in, even... even when you ran a little bit slower.<eos> I just... I want to make sure that you're not doing this because you think that you don't have anything left here anymore.<eos> This isn't about Patty.<eos> I mean, of course, you know, I miss her a lot, but I know what I have here.<eos> I love my life.<eos> I love my job, being The Flash.<eos> I love you and Joe.<eos> I'm not trying to escape.<eos> I promise. Go win, Barry, and then come home.<eos> All right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, how did I get here?<eos> What... who are... who are you?<eos> How do you look like me?<eos> Allen, what are you doing?<eos> Harrison Wells.<eos> The Harrison Wells.<eos> Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> Okay, I have no idea what is going on here, but I've always wanted to meet you.<eos> Your thesis on string phenomenology was revolutionary to me.<eos> - Oh, man.
You've always had my back, and I've got yours.<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> - Does she know me?<eos> Uh, this is my good friend, Cisco Ramon.<eos> - Good friend?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cisco works at S.T.A.R. Labs, and he has built a weapon that he believes we can use to neutralize, um, Killer Frost's powers.<eos> Great, thanks. I'll take it.<eos> Uh, please, I should really take this.<eos> All right.
You sure this good for the bird?<eos> You think you Massa Tom?<eos> Don't ever question me about these birds.<eos> I tell you to do something, you just do it.<eos> Think you know.<eos> Don't know nothing.<eos> Don't know the Lord gave chickens worst things in the world...<eos> pip, distemper, apoplexy, cholera, lime leg, and canker.<eos> You don't know pee clean like a good turpentine.<eos> Yeah.
- 12 so far, at least.<eos> That reporter, Leo Greene, has been posting some pretty incendiary videos from inside the cordon.<eos> People are bound to have a reaction.<eos> Does that mean you're finally sending more cops in?<eos> For now, we have to make do with what we got.<eos> I'll set up a meet point for all the cops inside the cordon.<eos> All right. How many are here?<eos> Including you?<eos> 11.<eos> - For the whole cordon?
My job is taking care of you.<eos> Well, I'm fine.<eos> But they say on the news that there are more sick people now.<eos> The doctor needs those rats.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - But you do care, Bert.<eos> That's one of the reasons I love you.<eos> We can't know for sure he was exposed.<eos> He had the man's blood on his hand.<eos> Not on his mouth...

- Maybe it's time.<eos> - What's time?<eos> The spirit.<eos> She's here.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Where is this spirit from?<eos> - She lives in Seoul.<eos> - Korea?<eos> She's a businesswoman.<eos> My age exactly.
Where is this spirit from?<eos> - She lives in Seoul.<eos> - Korea?<eos> She's a businesswoman.<eos> My age exactly.<eos> Born the same moment I was.<eos> The first breath I took, she took too, but in Korea.<eos> What a thing, yeah?<eos> She's here now?<eos> Sort of.
- Korea?<eos> She's a businesswoman.<eos> My age exactly.<eos> Born the same moment I was.<eos> The first breath I took, she took too, but in Korea.<eos> What a thing, yeah?<eos> She's here now?<eos> Sort of.<eos> - Actually, she's in prison.<eos> - Prison.
She's lying!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> That's what family's for.<eos> I understand pricks like Bendix.<eos> I deal with them every day.<eos> We know. But there's too many other women who need this shelter.<eos> Do you know where you'll go?<eos> So where did you honeymoon?<eos> Positano, Italy.
- It's New Year's.<eos> Our first as a married couple.<eos> It is.<eos> That's a nice thought.<eos> Since you were both taken from my life... I have not felt so loved by another person as I do by this man.<eos> You would love him, too.<eos> Goodness.<eos> When I think of my life just a year ago and now... how different things would be if my father had died or you had said no instead of yes.<eos> How fast everything can change.<eos> In my fucking house? !
_<eos> I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims.<eos> I recommend we institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus.<eos> What I need is the truth...<eos> Yeah, I'm in the middle<eos> - of the damn hot zone, Lex.<eos> - Jana!<eos> If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You OK?
Look at you springing for the good stuff.<eos> You know how I do.<eos> Hey, Walden, isn't it your daughter's birthday today?<eos> Lorelai, eight years old today.<eos> Why don't you take one of these bags and go share it with your family?<eos> I'll take your post.<eos> Go.<eos> And be thankful that you bought that place in Kirkwood last spring.<eos> Thanks, Lex.<eos> You OK?
- _ - Copy that.<eos> Will issue APB on one Xander Paulson, African American male, 5'11"...<eos> Hi.<eos> This is Lex.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> ...4 to 6 feet at all times.<eos> ...for your protection.<eos> I have a blue Prius registered to Leonard Greene northbound on Randolph approaching cordon perimeter.<eos> Copy.<eos> En route.
Mm-hmm. The guy who attacked him, Gary Nolan, was he on it?<eos> What about a Jackson Brooks,<eos> - Gil Harris, Shawn Cook? - No. But I'll run the numbers that don't have names.<eos> Last person that Darryl spoke with was, uh, his girlfriend, Mariah Parks.<eos> Track her down.<eos> Keep checking with the neighbors.<eos> Darryl was shot in the middle of the night... somebody heard somethin'.<eos> For sure, somebody's gonna be missing that money.<eos> The drop is tomorrow, right?<eos> Yeah, at the airport.
I'm sure God is watching out for you.<eos> Amy?<eos> Shawn?<eos> I haven't seen you in forever.<eos> Get over here and give me some.<eos> You remember Jackson Brooks and Gil Harris?<eos> We were all at Quitman together.<eos> We just wanted to speak to you about a few things that, uh... that happened at Quitman.<eos> Like what?<eos> Petey.
You haven't seen him since he left Brennan, right?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Well, then take advantage. Talk to him.<eos> Gil's a big boy. I'm sure he'll understand.<eos> - Hey, - would you do me a favor?<eos> Could you get rid of this gun for me?<eos> I just... I don't want it lying around the house.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Sure.<eos> All right.
Who's gonna pay for that?<eos> You don't even know if a crime has been committed.<eos> Look, man, there is blood all over that place.<eos> From a bunch of cut up animals.<eos> Those carcasses were all done outside the camper.<eos> So, what's your explanation, Officer?<eos> We got us a Charles Manson living in the woods behind Lowell Grippo's farm?<eos> Does that make sense to you?<eos> I'll tell you what doesn't make sense to me, is why the fuck you're so sure nothing happened out there.<eos> All right, Officer.
Yeah, networking.<eos> Nice.<eos> - Let's link it in, G.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Listen; I apologize for the mess on my desk.<eos> So many family photos, you know?<eos> Oh, here's one of me and my kids at the beach.<eos> Such a... such a special moment to share.<eos> Whoa! This chair's got wheels?<eos> Damn, son!
Well, what are we talking?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You know, like skrilla.<eos> I'm sorry, what is... that means money.<eos> Bo, I don't think we should sell our baby.<eos> You'd like it if it was your idea.<eos> Aw, French fudge! Um...<eos> I'm sorry. I have to look into that.<eos> Uh, but I'd be happy to, uh, you know, discuss bribe money...<eos> And skrilla.
I came in with it. How convenient for you.<eos> Well... . I guess it's just my word against yours then.<eos> if only i had some sort of device Right at my fingertips that recorded your illegal activity.<eos> oh. If only i could simply press a button, And see that recording.<eos> If only that had worked.<eos> I have always wanted...<eos> You? No, no, no...<eos> A blue couch!<eos> Okay. My home is all about-- hey, hey, hey!<eos> Okay, okay.
I know how to do my job.<eos> I'm not gonna live in fear of some corporate spy.<eos> Follow-up question:<eos> You don't still use MapQuest, do you?<eos> It's very intuitive.<eos> First time in our store?<eos> Oh, no. I've been here before.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I have a pretty good memory for faces, right there...<eos> In my brain.
- Of course.<eos> You got to eat before you go to the hospital.<eos> Uh, sandwiches, chips, and carrots, and Betsy, I put your cleats in your backpack for soccer.<eos> Hold on, let me check the budget.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's too many people in this house.<eos> No, we can't afford two more laborers.<eos> Come on.<eos> Bus isn't gonna wait.<eos> - All right, bye.
You know, I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to remember where the room is after so many blows to my skull.<eos> You put "Atlas Shrugged" on the top shelf?<eos> Hardcover?<eos> Aww, did Ayn Rand hurt your poor little skull?<eos> You know, I'm pretty sure she gave me a contusion.<eos> You should read it.<eos> She's got some interesting things to say.<eos> Ah, no thanks.<eos> Every Libertarian was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.<eos> All right.
We have to speed things up.<eos> You've got to convince the dying mom that they need you full-time.<eos> Well, Mrs. Wexler already loves me.<eos> So convince the husband.<eos> I've been busting my ass trying to prove to Mr. Wexler that I'd be a great wife, and he just doesn't want me there.<eos> That's because you're not being a great wife, you're being a great nanny.<eos> Nobody wants to fuck Mary Poppins.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> See to his needs.<eos> All his needs.
Can you see good enough to fight?<eos> I see good enough.<eos> I found my way here.<eos> Don't think about even their own people. I figure I can at least spook some of them rebels.<eos> My Massa put out his cigar in my eye 'cause I cried when he sold my ma and sisters.<eos> I ran away the next day.<eos> You have children?<eos> I have a younger brother your age.<eos> He, my mother, and my father are still in Juffure.<eos> Africa.
What kind of warrior waits to die?<eos> ! I seen plenty of men far worse off than you... no strip of skin left on they back, overseer beat them near to death.<eos> Seen women worked to death, girls' bodies used up hard... no older than children.<eos> But they found a way to get up.<eos> They was warriors.<eos> Not you.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I will never let you treat me like a Massa in a temper.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Fiddler!
No more royal subjects are we!<eos> Long live freedom!<eos> Long live freedom!<eos> Ain't that wonderful?<eos> White folk finally got they freedom.<eos> What will happen to the slaves who fought in the Continental Army?<eos> I'm sure General Washington will find them work. Alongside his other slaves.<eos> Sound about right to you?<eos> Sounds real fine.<eos> Fiddler!
So y'all call me Henry.<eos> Just get on out of here.<eos> Go on! Just go on. Go on 'fore you start causing trouble.<eos> - Just go on.<eos> - He's running! Go on!<eos> Fa is here. Fa is here.<eos> Fiddler.<eos> Fiddler.<eos> Get up. Fiddler.<eos> Fiddler!
Fiddler.<eos> Fiddler.<eos> Get up. Fiddler.<eos> Fiddler!<eos> Fiddler, wake up.<eos> Get up!<eos> Get up! Now!<eos> Fiddler!<eos> No!<eos> Fiddler!
Well, it appears to be.<eos> Missy, come back to the house.<eos> - Come on in, Kizzy.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Fa!<eos> Kizzy!<eos> You come back here!<eos> Kizzy, is everything all right?<eos> You've got to go right now.<eos> Right this second.
Answers to my questions.<eos> Why would I tell you anything?<eos> Because if you do... I will give you the antidote.<eos> Sabah was his cousin, Wahlaan, his landlord, and Galila was his fiancée.<eos> You sure of this?<eos> Yes.<eos> They took a break recently, but Malik told us they would get back together soon.<eos> Who is Omar?<eos> I've never heard of Omar.<eos> Or Mahdoor.
One full confession for the murder of Jacob Marley and our unfortunate friend downstairs.<eos> How about that, Detective?<eos> Does that still stand even when the man's been beaten to within an inch of his life?<eos> I've achieved more this morning than you have in weeks.<eos> If I were you, I'd keep your snide remarks to yourself.<eos> We agreed you'd stay away!<eos> - Honoria's sleeping.<eos> - I'm not here to see Honoria.<eos> - It's you I want to talk to.<eos> - Now what?
'But he wouldn't listen.<eos> He said he wouldn't argue in the street.<eos> 'And when I told him that I insisted on being heard...'<eos> I have business at the dockside this evening around 9pm - perhaps I can help you then.<eos> You agreed to meet him?<eos> No, not really. He just... He just told me where he'd be.<eos> I suppose he thought I'd... I'd never walk down the docks on me own at that time of night.<eos> It was just his way of trying to get rid of me.<eos> But you went?<eos> Christmas Eve?
You've been given a fresh start, a wonderful future...<eos> You have to put it out of your mind, Honoria.<eos> - What's done is done.<eos> - Her name was Esther Frances.<eos> You have a family.<eos> Frances and I will care for you.<eos> Perhaps we should consult the doctor.<eos> And tell him what exactly?<eos> - Was your trip successful?<eos> - In part.
I want you out of the house by this evening.<eos> Oh, Kitty!<eos> Kitty! Sis!<eos> Frank, what's happened?<eos> - That one's going to be in Madame Rennard's new brochure. - Oh!<eos> It's never been done in this country before.<eos> She's seen them in Paris.<eos> Imagine that - a whole brochure just about her ready-to-wear.<eos> It suits you.<eos> Not in pink.
Let's get some champagne.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, that's it.<eos> If you hate it so much, just tell me.<eos> Fine. Your cologne is horrible.<eos> You smell like a stripper died in a cabin.<eos> I'm not talking about my cologne.<eos> That's why I hang back and wait for him to get specific.<eos> My mustache.
Can I...tell you a little secret?<eos> No!<eos> Well, when I made a move on my first crush, it went way worse.<eos> It was New Year's Eve, and I went to give him a kiss, and my tongue froze to his cheek. Why did it freeze?<eos> It was cold, and he was made out of bronze, and I don't want to talk about this anymore.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Marty said guys our age can't do 10 sit-ups.<eos> I don't remember saying it, but it sounds like me.<eos> Jay, may I speak with you for a moment?<eos> All right.
When I put Mom in that nursing home.<eos> That was quite a rush.<eos> So, are you going to be nice?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's not a bad guy.<eos> And really, how much longer am I gonna have to put up with him?<eos> Ay, no, Jay.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You're going to live a long life.<eos> Not me!
Look, we have provided them with a good home.<eos> When they're ready, they'll leave.<eos> Could be any day.<eos> Oh, and in the duck's defense, Claire, you can't stick your leg out of your robe at breakfast and then pretend to hate the attention.<eos> Um...<eos> Why didn't you fight harder about the ducks?<eos> You heard what he said.<eos> The ducks could leave any day now.<eos> Yeah, or it could be two months from now.<eos> Or any day now.
You're a minor.<eos> Take advantage of it.<eos> I break the rules.<eos> I just prefer to be suave, do it with panache and finesse.<eos> Ay, those are American shampoos. I know.<eos> Y'all ready for this?<eos> I got our sauce into the granddaddy of all holiday gift baskets.<eos> Which one?<eos> It's called Granddaddy's Holiday Gift Baskets.<eos> Very exclusive.
Have fun.<eos> What's the most dangerous type of uranium cake?<eos> Yellow!<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Um, I found this inhaler.<eos> Do you know whose it is?<eos> There's only six people here who don't use those.<eos> They throw them in the air at graduation.<eos> All right.
-He takes such good care of her.<eos> Super guy.<eos> Phil's the best.<eos> Would you stop agreeing with me and help me?<eos> Well, stop making such excellent points!<eos> God, this is torture.<eos> Tell me what you really think. OK.<eos> Here's what I think:<eos> You get married, the vows say,<eos> "In sickness and in health."
-I need to have a little faith.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna pray to the Nordic god, Frigg.<eos> Frigg.<eos> Yeah, she-she rules motherhood and wisdom.<eos> I would never pray to a female god, especially one named Frigg.<eos> Well, she works for me.<eos> If you want to use your misogynistic God with his fire and bullshit, go ahead.<eos> Well, we've had a falling out.<eos> All right.
Ooh, we have... the oatmeal with fresh fruit on the side, and brown sugar on the side, and milk on the side, and cream on the side.<eos> We also have a fan favorite, the South-by-Southwest scramble with bacon.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Have you found your nut compartment?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> The nut compartment.<eos> Right here in your fridge is your nut compartment, where your assorted nuts are kept at a nut-friendly 45 degrees.<eos> Uh, uh, Kyle?<eos> I'm sort of paying for my friend's services by the hour, so can we just kind of wrap it up?<eos> OK, all right.
I'm done.<eos> And?<eos> I can see where they think they have a case.<eos> A case for what?<eos> Deporting natural-born citizens?<eos> There's a slim chance they could make trouble if this ends up in court.<eos> We do have the option of letting the courts decide.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> -No, it's an attempt at mediation.<eos> -Mediation?
- She didn't say it.<eos> - Oh, she said it.<eos> No, it's impossible.<eos> We don't use that word in our house.<eos> -You probably heard wrong.<eos> -Mm-mm. What did we hear?<eos> "This friendly guy"?<eos> -"This clucking guy"?<eos> -No.<eos> All right.
So you want to talk through tonight's timeline so you know what's on the docket?<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Let's get you dead.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I overshot that one.<eos> So, first, there are the drugs which go in the pudding which you have made and which I will eat myself.<eos> And then I'll do the bag-on-the-head thing and turn on this bad boy for insurance.<eos> So what, are we gonna do it out here?<eos> Al fresco?<eos> No, in the bedroom.
Nope. I'm watching Byamba pick up Big Joe by his diaper.<eos> You are making my gorge rise.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm not waving pom-poms for you and Babe?<eos> You know I can't condone this.<eos> She's not asking you to condone it.<eos> She's asking you to be her friend and to be there for her.<eos> No matter what you believe.<eos> Because that's what friends do.<eos> -Not in my world.
-Don't say that.<eos> If you had said to me what I said to you, I'd be doing to you what you're supposed to be doing to Babe.<eos> I do let things roll off my back.<eos> Do you believe what Babe is doing is right?<eos> -Well, then, pick up the pudding, hand me that leftover chicken salad, and get out of here.<eos> I just want to thank you all for coming.<eos> I'm so grateful to have so many wonderful people from my life in the same room.<eos> I mean, holy shit, there's Baba Uday all the way from Tibet!<eos> And there's beautiful Tina Marie all the way from the McMurdo Station<eos> -in Antarctica.
I've lived it hard and well.<eos> With every breath, right?<eos> Inhale peace, exhale joy. Inhale peace, exhale joy.<eos> Ah, it sounds like horse shit, I know, but the fact of the matter is my cup runneth over.<eos> What will we do without you?<eos> You'll live.<eos> By the way, where's my joke?<eos> Oh, um... I'll never forget what my grandfather said to me just before he died.<eos> "Are you still holding the fucking ladder?"<eos> You OK?
You're right, I hear you.<eos> Bring it.<eos> -Disperse! -Oh, God.<eos> - Again?<eos> - It never ends!<eos> What is wrong with this picture?<eos> How the hell do you drink these things?<eos> Usually not with a sugar rim.<eos> Well, it's a horrible olive delivery system.<eos> You okay?
She's got pending charges and a bench warrant for missing her last court appearance.<eos> Well, then I'm here to bail her out.<eos> Why don't you take a seat, because she's gotta be processed and go in front of the judge.<eos> For your own sake, I'd encourage you to stop what you're doing and let her go.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because Miss Cortez is prepared to provide information on another case.<eos> A case Wayne Lowry is certain that you don't want the district attorney reopening.<eos> I represented Carlos Mejia on an aggravated assault charge.<eos> Was there anything unusual about the case?<eos> - Unusual how?
Yeah, essentially.<eos> But you also wanna detail things like your build-up costs, your seasonal sales rates.<eos> Yeah, I mean, like, I have financials.<eos> Sure, but I mean, what does that mean for a mixed-use marina, right?<eos> Right, exactly.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I imagine that you've accounted for your seasonal contingencies - and your impact fees on a per seat basis? - Mm-hm.<eos> Good.<eos> So, can you tell me something about how you've budgeted for your holding costs?<eos> My what?
So, can you tell me something about how you've budgeted for your holding costs?<eos> My what?<eos> Fuck!<eos> You're such a fucking idiot!<eos> Hang on a second, please.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> I said give me a second.<eos> Easy, brother.<eos> To party alone is bad luck.<eos> Uh, okay.
A few nights ago, he picked up his shit and took off.<eos> Okay, is there any chance that you could get a message to him?<eos> Depends. What's the message?<eos> Did he ever tell you about my brother John Rayburn?<eos> - The cop?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Carlos isn't in trouble.<eos> He just needs to talk to my brother.<eos> About what?
When you meet him, you'll see.<eos> Did Danny talk to him about us?<eos> It seems he did.<eos> What does he know?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did you meet his mother?<eos> Still trying to track her down.<eos> Do you wanna meet him, Mom?<eos> If I do... what am I supposed to tell him?<eos> About what?
Did Danny talk to him about us?<eos> It seems he did.<eos> What does he know?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did you meet his mother?<eos> Still trying to track her down.<eos> Do you wanna meet him, Mom?<eos> If I do... what am I supposed to tell him?<eos> About what?<eos> About everything.
Were we meeting the same person?<eos> We need to humanize him.<eos> The D.A.'s gonna paint him out to be a monster, but that's not who he was when he went in.<eos> Juvie did that. Huntsville's gonna make him worse.<eos> You sure we should focus on the rehab element?<eos> The case law is not very helpful.<eos> Gonna handle that in closing.<eos> But I want you to take direct. I want you to hit that juvie record head-on.<eos> Make sure he tells the judge exactly why he did what he did.<eos> All right?
I don't have a son.<eos> You want to bet?<eos> I'm looking for a guest.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She's not coming up in the system.<eos> Maybe she... maybe she checked out, hmm?<eos> Well, if she had, she'd still be in the system.<eos> Are you sure she wasn't staying at The Sherry or The Carlyle?<eos> No, no, she always stays here.<eos> At The Pierre.
- We're not teaming up with anybody.<eos> They just happen to be moving the same direction we are.<eos> Besides, they're not just here to blow up a train.<eos> There's something far bigger going on.<eos> Sasha, why did you invite them.<eos> It's much more dangerous now.<eos> The dogs are after them, and they're lying to us.<eos> So are we.<eos> - Let's go, boys.<eos> - Fine.
Yes.<eos> - General.<eos> - What is it, gunny?<eos> We've received an encoded message. It appears it's from Blackburn.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> "Request for extraction, stop.<eos> 1700 hours, stop.<eos> Königsberg, stop. Panta rhei, stop."<eos> - And there was mention of an airfield.<eos> - An airfield.
He wanted to come to America, to his family.<eos> Th... that's great, but we need to know who he's been in contact with.<eos> He hasn't left the house except to go to the hospital.<eos> That flight took a lot out of him.<eos> He had a cold, nothing more.<eos> What's in this?<eos> His belongings.<eos> Where's he at?<eos> No.<eos> In the bedroom.
I'm at my office. I got turned away at Spring.<eos> What's going on?<eos> It's bad, baby.<eos> They've quarantined a 4-square-mile of the city.<eos> Oh, my... Are you all right?<eos> Wait, which section?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I tried to call you to make sure that you got out in time.<eos> Wait, Lex, I don't...<eos> My section?
You're volunteering me?<eos> First you get me trapped in here, and now I get to play evidence clerk for the doctors?<eos> Did you call me to yell at me?<eos> Yeah. You got a problem with that?<eos> Yeah. A hello would be nice.<eos> No, you don't get a hello, all right?<eos> You're... you're safe and sound outside those fences, and I'm stuck in this... this hospital of death looking for ways to contact next of kin.<eos> Jana's inside too, Jake.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Work.
And an unloading zone and a distribution center, but we don't have a week.<eos> Can you make it work?<eos> Ha! Hell no.<eos> Neither can I, but we're gonna.<eos> Spring Street crosses directly over Linden Train Station.<eos> The location should provide a good perimeter.<eos> My team will deliver the food to you.<eos> Your team will control distribution.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Actually, yeah.
I could use the specialty pay.<eos> You mean your bookie could use it.<eos> Listen up.<eos> We're on a tight schedule.<eos> So, I need everyone to help out in any way that you can.<eos> All right?<eos> Keep the traffic moving and out of the way so that we can unload these trucks safely.<eos> Now, each large box contains 10 smaller ones holding 50 MREs.<eos> 100 boxes.<eos> 5 on each pallet.
There. happy?<eos> Yeah. happy.<eos> - But Mom's still coming with me.<eos> - No!<eos> We gave you the phone.<eos> Trey says he needs her back at the store.<eos> Says to bring those two, also.<eos> No.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! All right.
Yeah. happy.<eos> - But Mom's still coming with me.<eos> - No!<eos> We gave you the phone.<eos> Trey says he needs her back at the store.<eos> Says to bring those two, also.<eos> No.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! All right.<eos> All right.
I said huff, not smoke.<eos> You smoke chemicals, you explode.<eos> Huff, smoke, whatever.<eos> Let's make a deal for the chemicals, and we all walk away happy.<eos> OK. You see how we're all debating this rationally?<eos> I guarantee you those tweakers down there aren't having the same kind of civilized conversation.<eos> They're straight up bent, and they want to stay that way.<eos> - That's as far as their logic goes.<eos> - Whereas you as a cop, you can see the whole chess board.<eos> All right.
A "Henry Burns" signed in almost every day at 5:00 a.m.<eos> 5:00 a.m.?<eos> - Right there. - Oh.<eos> Is that him?<eos> There's Sanders.<eos> That's our guy.<eos> Henry Burns.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> There's the quickie.<eos> Like clockwork.
- Suspicious.<eos> Did his postdoc in emerging infectious diseases at Emory from 2009 to 2013.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then nothing.<eos> No employment, no presence of any kind on the Internet.<eos> So what, he's a spy?<eos> See, that's the thing... spies always have convincing covers.<eos> - You know what that tells me?<eos> - He's been working<eos> - off the books.
Captain Scott will be in charge of security, but Major Carnahan will have final word on logistics.<eos> What he says goes.<eos> And, Dr. Cannerts, you will have that child to the wall at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.<eos> Are we all clear?<eos> Then this is it.<eos> The beginning of the end.<eos> It's the most exposed part of our route.<eos> We need to be at the extraction point at 7:00 a.m.<eos> And once we've delivered Thomas, we can head back to the hospital.<eos> And after that?
Okay.<eos> Ooh. That doesn't look good.<eos> I'm not sure that's gonna heal on its own.<eos> I'm fine, mother hen.<eos> Stop clucking.<eos> I'd say we should go to the hospital, but... I'll go ask Dr. Cannerts what we should do.<eos> No, do not bother that poor man about a nothing paper cut like this.<eos> I'm going.<eos> We'll have our dance when I get back home.<eos> All right?
It's not the National Guard's practice to fire upon unarmed Americans.<eos> Captain, if you let this virus out, there won't be any Americans left.<eos> Yeah, I'll take that under advisement.<eos> Over and out.<eos> Anything?<eos> I checked every floor; there's no sign of her.<eos> She wouldn't just run away, would she?<eos> Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> On the roof.
- _ - How long have you known?<eos> You took a test, right?<eos> My body's like clockwork.<eos> I don't need a test.<eos> In case you hadn't noticed, there's been a lot going on.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Maybe it's just stress.<eos> You sound like Dennis now.<eos> You told him?<eos> Last night in the church.
What apartment?<eos> You know, the good news for you is I'm not here because you're a worthless traitor, okay?<eos> - I just want the research.<eos> - Why? You know it won't change anything.<eos> You'll still be stuck in here.<eos> Might as well have a beer.<eos> Those are hard to come by.<eos> Yeah, and so's a conscience, apparently.<eos> You want the research?<eos> - Yeah. - Fine.
So would you say that the protests have quieted down...<eos> She is good, man.<eos> You have to admit it...<eos> she's very, very good.<eos> It'll be nicer when my story blows hers out of the water.<eos> You can't print this.<eos> - _ - Why not?<eos> We're still working on it, and, uh, we don't have enough evidence to convict.<eos> In court, maybe, but it doesn't mean we can't get it out there, convict her in the press.<eos> In-in that press?
You need "more time with the family"... that's a classic.<eos> "Gonna start a nonprofit in California,"<eos> I really don't care as long as you get out of my city and you never come back.<eos> I'll call a press conference for tomorrow.<eos> And you'll resign.<eos> And I'll resign.<eos> Hey, baby girl.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Leanne.<eos> After my mom.
Okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Walden? You shot him?<eos> Just following orders, Lex.<eos> Let me see him.<eos> No sign of the virus.<eos> We need to have him cremated immediately.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.<eos> All right.
You paid half.<eos> Now's the time to pay the other half.<eos> That's not what we agreed on.<eos> We pay when we get out.<eos> It's my escape plan, my rules.<eos> It's only your escape plan if we get out safely.<eos> Unless you don't think we're actually gonna get out safely, in which case, why the hell are we doing this?<eos> Fine, but I'm still calling the shots.<eos> Now, let's hurry.<eos> All right then.
About whether you're the right guy to get us out of here.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> So, normally we'd weigh out risk versus reward, but everything is unknown, everything is risky.<eos> Okay, so, we're weighing the risks down here versus the risks of the Cordon.<eos> We can go back.<eos> We really can.<eos> We'd like to keep going.<eos> Keep trying to get our baby out.<eos> All right, so we continue on.<eos> _
The hope may lie in one of us.<eos> Which means it lies in all of us.<eos> I, for one, am glad the president apologized.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Just because they didn't do this attack doesn't mean they're never going to attempt one like it in the future.<eos> I think an apology like this is just an invitation for more aggression.<eos> Missing the bigger point.<eos> We were all so eager to lap up this story... What does that say about America?<eos> About us?<eos> - Even you...
We found you.<eos> The Lord has found me.<eos> All right, we split up, cover as much ground as we can. Walden,<eos> I want you here at the original egress point.<eos> Now, you see anyone, you send them back, whether they look sick or not.<eos> Anyone resists, you call for backup.<eos> We cannot afford to mess this up.<eos> Everyone back here in 30 minutes!<eos> - Yes, sir. - Sir.<eos> All right.
Everyone back here in 30 minutes!<eos> - Yes, sir. - Sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Move out!<eos> All right, getting lights?<eos> Go. Go on.<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> We're here.<eos> I'll see if my contact's here.<eos> _
Downtime leads to increased productivity, ergo we have to have fun.<eos> And the best way to have fun is for us to go out to the club.<eos> Am I right, Team Flash?<eos> Let's get turnt!<eos> No, but seriously, we need a break.<eos> - You know, I think Cisco's right, and if I'm saying we need a break, then you know it's serious.<eos> - All right, let's go out tonight.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Can I go?<eos> - Over my dead body.
- Oh, Dad,<eos> I don't need--I don't know what you thought<eos> I was gonna be doing, but I...<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I mean, is it necessary?<eos> It's kind of, you know...<eos> - Or I could always build you an inescapable daughter cube.<eos> - Funny.<eos> You know I'd get out though, right?<eos> All right, fine.
Keep me posted, okay?<eos> - Joe, I don't want people thinking The Flash is a petty thief.<eos> - Well, we need to get to work squashing those rumors before they spread.<eos> - Here it is, people: evidence that The Flash has gone rogue.<eos> - Couldn't it be the speedster in the helmet?<eos> - The photo speaks for itself.<eos> No helmet glare, confirming that this is The Scarlet Speedster.<eos> We're gonna expose him as a fraud.<eos> McKay, I want you at the police department getting any interview you can.<eos> - Okay, on it.
- It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space.<eos> You... you've seen it before, Mr. Hall.<eos> That used to be my name.<eos> Carter Hall.<eos> There really is rather a lot to fill you in on, and we really do not have the time.<eos> - What about...<eos> - Kendra, yes, we need your assistance in locating her and Savage.<eos> Perhaps we can start with what Savage was doing in 1944.<eos> He said something about, um... Thanagarian technology.<eos> - Thanagarian...
- Yeah.<eos> It's a similar process by which our uniform materializes when we merge, but at the moment, we need to focus on figuring out what Savage is planning.<eos> Come on, just the once.<eos> Is that Raymond and Kendra's lucky vase?<eos> I don't know, I just found this junk lying around.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Don't you think that turning something into something else might come in handy?<eos> All right, one time only.<eos> Okay, just the once.<eos> All right.
What?<eos> Third time.<eos> Three rituals.<eos> I-I think I know what Savage is planning to do.<eos> I figured out how Savage plans to erase time.<eos> I believe he intends to detonate each of these meteors in a different time period.<eos> How can you destroy the world three times in three different times?<eos> You can't, it would create a temporal paradox.<eos> Which would result in a timequake that would return the Earth to the point of the first chronothermic reaction,<eos> - Ancient Egypt.
- How?<eos> We've always known that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items exposed, as you were, to the meteor's radiation.<eos> Now, the radiation works both ways.<eos> It gave Savage his immortality, but... It also makes him vulnerable.<eos> And Savage is about to unleash the radiation from three meteorites in three different time periods.<eos> - Triple the exposure.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Which should be sufficient to render Savage mortal.<eos> And then all we got to do is kill Savage three times.<eos> Indeed.
I may die, but you'll live knowing that you failed to save the lives of...<eos> Never speak their names again.<eos> Do something, RoboCop.<eos> I'm on it. Got a little trick I've been working on.<eos> It's up to you now, Jefferson.<eos> Gray, listen.<eos> If we're going to do this, we got to do it together.<eos> It's going to take the two of us, all right?<eos> - You're right.<eos> - Okay.
Sis!<eos> No! It was good to see you, Jackson.<eos> You, too.<eos> See you two later.<eos> You're just gonna... you're just gonna<eos> - leave your boys like that?<eos> - I'm out.<eos> She's out.<eos> All right, well, now we can talk about it.<eos> About what?
The provost.<eos> No idea what you're talking about.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They didn't ask you to come in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Then-- then-- then make a-- a statement or post a retraction somewhere.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Online!
What about a blind spot from the tower?<eos> - There isn't one.<eos> - No time to tunnel under.<eos> - Patrols?<eos> - Twenty-four hour rotation.<eos> - Like a Swiss watch. No gaps.<eos> - Efficient bastards.<eos> Maybe we don't need to break into the camp.<eos> Prisoners are taken out on work detail one block at a time, right?<eos> - Same time every day. - An ambush?
I will miss this place.<eos> So visit.<eos> Could you get those handcuffs off, please?<eos> _<eos> Klaus, I'm Duncan Sinclair.<eos> I'm Oliver and Billy's father.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> How's Bowmanville suit you?<eos> Little more comfortable than the Russian camp?
- It's too close to the cliff.<eos> - Which is too steep to scale.<eos> We should have at least a dozen more men.<eos> There's none coming, Gordie.<eos> You were on the beach, you saw.<eos> We'll be retreating by now.<eos> Which is why our window of opportunity is now.<eos> Their eyes are facing forward, focused on the shore.<eos> That won't last long.<eos> Alright, guys.
_<eos> Who's there?<eos> Thank you, Sabine, for not saying anything to the guard.<eos> You're "Helene." He's your friend.<eos> There's nothing to say.<eos> I keep my word.<eos> I'll call Franz now and tell him to come home.<eos> Sit if you like.<eos> Don't touch your gun!<eos> Alright.
- Who sent them?<eos> - You were on watch.<eos> So then, come and get me.<eos> I updated Camp X on Terre-du-Fils.<eos> - All of it.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now with that in mind, we're not gonna put any more civilians in harm's way, not again.<eos> Attacking the auto plant could cripple their tank production.<eos> And a raid like this would help George and his men train for what they'll need to do when the time comes.<eos> Alright.
After all, you don't have<eos> - any other friends here.<eos> - I see.<eos> It's curious to you that somebody might want to be my friend.<eos> That I might be good company.<eos> That was not my point.<eos> You're annoyed that I made a choice of my own for once.<eos> And that I chose to spend some time away from you.<eos> You call her your friend but have you been to her home?<eos> Her work?
Not like us.<eos> She deserves more than her solitude.<eos> She deserves every beautiful thing in the world.<eos> If you love her...<eos> You've barely met her.<eos> I won't have you lecture me.<eos> Actually, I met her often.<eos> There's photographic evidence of us together.<eos> In cafes, as you mentioned.<eos> In a black market.
It's easy to be in love with someone who's not here, isn't it?<eos> Yes. Perhaps that's why she's sending me away.<eos> Chin up!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Would you excuse me?<eos> - The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.<eos> - Yes. I've just been reading about your difficulty with Colonel Nasser.<eos> Have the newspapers exaggerated it terribly?<eos> To a very significant degree, yes.
The Archbishops of Canterbury, and York.<eos> The Bishop of Durham, and is that Winchester?<eos> Bath and Wells, Ma'am.<eos> - The big guns.<eos> - The four horsemen of the apocalypse.<eos> Marriage is a sacrament of God. The cornerstone of our Christian family life. Its foundation and its rock.<eos> And according to the Canon law of the Church of England... indissoluble.<eos> Put simply, there are no circumstances where the Church might permit the remarriage of divorced persons while the husband or wife of the former marriage is still alive.<eos> Even if he was the innocent party?<eos> No circumstances at all.
When we have what we came for.<eos> I said take your leave.<eos> Monsieur, we are not here to stop you getting married.<eos> Trust me, nothing will stop that.<eos> - St Pierre!<eos> - There must be another solution here.<eos> Monsieur, stand down.<eos> Ah, really?<eos> Really.<eos> Aramis.
And one night soon you'll wake and he'll be standing over your bed.<eos> And his face will be the last thing you see before you die.<eos> Waste of time.<eos> He could be anywhere by now.<eos> Headed for Lorraine?<eos> It's unlikely.<eos> Two hundred mile ride and he's carrying injuries.<eos> A long list of nobles in the East who need sweet-talking.<eos> If you were him where would you start?<eos> Eparcy.
We must speak of the Regency.<eos> Not now.<eos> Majesty, surely you cannot still plan to name Gaston?<eos> For all we know he may have been abducted.<eos> One brother of mine is dead.<eos> I do not intend to condemn the other before he has had a chance to speak.<eos> Louis, Gaston has shown no loyalty to you. To your son.<eos> Oh really, Anne?<eos> You wish to speak of this?<eos> Of loyalty?
But her family disowned her.<eos> She left here a long time ago.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Dead, I expect.<eos> The day we let our guests go hungry is the day we are truly lost.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You haven't found your man then, yet?<eos> He grew up near here, we believe. In, um...<eos> Eparcy.
They just wanted meat to throw at the enemy's guns.<eos> We've seen things you wouldn't believe men could do to other men.<eos> Oh believe me.<eos> So you fled.<eos> We wanted to run for the border, but Bastien made us come back for the gold.<eos> He said it was our only way out.<eos> And now we've got nothing else to show for four bastard years of war!<eos> But you don't remember where you stashed it.<eos> Yeah we remember.<eos> In the caves.
What do you want?<eos> Athos told me of Grimaud and his mother, the...<eos> The things that happened to her.<eos> It's you, isn't it?<eos> Your friend, the girl whose family disowned her.<eos> I imagine such an invention makes memories easier to bear.<eos> I will shoot.<eos> Death will come slow.<eos> The gold. I want it brought out.<eos> All of it.
Boring a lot of the time.<eos> You get used to it.<eos> Were you ever scared?<eos> No.<eos> It's Juliette...<eos> Make the exchange down by the smithy.<eos> We'll be up here for cover.<eos> We lose control of this, he'll kill everyone, including the children.<eos> I'll be right next to you.<eos> All right?
- And then get him insured.<eos> Thirty-five quid. I'm not kidding!<eos> You're a monster!<eos> I'm sure poor Mr Ward meant to do his best by you.<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> Did you have no feelings for him at all, Mary Ann?<eos> I don't know what I was thinking, just I had to be married to someone, anyone.<eos> - Will I make us some tea?<eos> - Would you?<eos> Not that old thing.
This note's addressed to three of us.<eos> Grimaud thinks D'Artagnan's dead.<eos> The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?<eos> You take out as many as you can, keep it quiet.<eos> All the time they think you're dead, we've got the upper hand and we'll keep their eyes on us.<eos> Aramis.
That was for Sylvie.<eos> That was for my cadets.<eos> And this is for me.<eos> I wasn't sure how to tell him.<eos> I'm terrified.<eos> And elated.<eos> We're all elated for both of you.<eos> All three of you.<eos> No child could wish for better parents.<eos> Or uncles.
I mean, it's not like I can just go and talk to Enzo Ferrari or Ferdinand Porsche 'cause they dead, but...<eos> You know, doesn't mean they can't still teach me.<eos> I got to go.<eos> You haven't even touched your food.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just... I just realized the key to a case I've been working on, so I'm gonna just... thank you, Wally.<eos> Sorry, guys. I'll be...<eos> I'll be back later.<eos> That dude gets weirder every time I see him.<eos> You mean the "old" Harrison Wells?<eos> As in Eobard Thawne?
Wilson knew exactly what he was doing... even in the way he detailed why he killed Luca Raines, it was very matter-of-fact.<eos> He wanted revenge on Calista for firing him and ending the affair, and he also hated Luca, which is why he was trying to frame her for the murder.<eos> Your honor!<eos> Miss Carver, please.<eos> Just answer the questions asked of you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, he did not seem like a crazy person.<eos> He told me that I was collateral damage and that he never meant for me to be caught in the middle of all this.<eos> And that's when he let you go.<eos> Basically, yes.
Because he's the best one I've had so far, not because he's... hot.<eos> Well, so then don't fire him.<eos> But probably don't have sex with him, either.<eos> Oh, I'm not going to.<eos> It's not like he's done anything like that before.<eos> Oh, I bet it would have been really good.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm haven't had sex in months, okay?<eos> Not since I met up with Harry in Milan.<eos> Is he ever coming home?<eos> Yes. Actually, next week.
So this is... this is where the new bistro will be.<eos> Are we having a date night?<eos> We are.<eos> Just thought we could use some alone time.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> So can you see it... the future?<eos> Well, I'm trying, but I'm not really good with spacial relations.<eos> No, I'm not talking about the restaurant now, Joss.<eos> I'm talking about us.<eos> Our future.
I'm not sure I knew this is the image we were going for.<eos> Ah, don't sweat it.<eos> Look, I booked you a meet-and-greet at the Sex Stop.<eos> - Wait. Isn't that a sex store?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But it's a classy sex store.<eos> They sell books and flavored condoms.<eos> The best way to get a decent offer on your second book is to up the sales on the first, so we need to strike.<eos> And this is how we do that?<eos> Well, yeah. Pretty much.
Okay, hey, but wait. Can we at least talk about the picture?<eos> 'Cause you looked gorgeous!<eos> Haters are gonna hate, sweetie.<eos> Um, Karen. Can I ask your advice as a medical professional?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I'm glad someone remembers I'm a doctor.<eos> How do you feel about... pre-wedding sex with a stranger?<eos> Joss, you just got engaged.<eos> No. Not me.<eos> Um, Kate, actually.
That sounds like that song from "The Book of Mormon"?<eos> "You and Me (But Mostly Me)"?<eos> Exactly! I love that show.<eos> Me too!<eos> Michael, get in here.<eos> Remember, she works for you.<eos> Bali, Shanghai, London, and my crown jewel...<eos> Diamond Sunset, a five-star destination resort that will surpass anything you've ever seen in Los Angeles.<eos> And I want you to partner with me on this spectacular new restaurant.<eos> As well as the beach bistro?
You're a very wise man.<eos> My mom used to say that same thing.<eos> Hey, wait up! I don't think it's smart for me to just show up on your second date with some guy.<eos> Joss, it's just drinks, and I want your opinion.<eos> My opinion is you're getting ahead of yourself, honey.<eos> Why, because I already know how I feel?<eos> Sorry. Can I help that?<eos> And Dean said family's really important to him.<eos> He said that?<eos> On a first date? Okay.
After everything you've been through.<eos> Honestly, I don't need you to tell me what I've been through.<eos> I keep forgetting I'm not supposed to be nice to you.<eos> It's good you're scrubbing.<eos> Your upper arms were starting to get flabby.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I thought you wanted me to take off the kid gloves.<eos> You don't have to insult me.<eos> Just... be normal.<eos> All right.
But you were so angry before about your memory, you thought... you know, maybe Peri was trying to keep things from you.<eos> But why would she do that?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I have to stop fighting to remember everything and let it go.<eos> If I keep obsessing, I'll never be free.<eos> You understand?<eos> Uh, n... not really.<eos> You know, you should spend some time with Ben.<eos> He really puts things in perspective.<eos> Okay, then.
It was a mistake.<eos> I have to tell him the truth.<eos> No!<eos> That's the best thing you've ever done!<eos> You have to keep lying.<eos> I actually like you for once.<eos> Okay, so I was thinking about this fabric for the drapes.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Vertical stripes for the windows?<eos> Like a prison?
Stop!<eos> How long was Spence here?<eos> Do you remember what time he left?<eos> I guess he was here a few hours.<eos> He passed out.<eos> I had to kick him out around closing time.<eos> It was around 4:00.<eos> So he was here between 1:00 and 3:00 and not at home?<eos> That's what I just said.<eos> Ah, thanks, Cinnamon!
Ugh! I can't believe this.<eos> You think we were too hard on her?<eos> S-She really wants to sing in the showcase.<eos> When you gave us Daniela, you promised to stay out of our life.<eos> I'm her mother.<eos> I get to decide, not you.<eos> Zoila. Hi.<eos> I saw your car and thought you might be back.<eos> How was the trip?<eos> Fine.
Look at the ritzy new furniture!<eos> Yeah. Don't get used to it.<eos> It's all going back.<eos> Well, I think it's much better.<eos> I didn't like your ratty old stuff at all.<eos> See, Marisol?<eos> These new pieces are a major step up.<eos> Ha. Sorry, is this a private maid meeting, or can anyone join in?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Weird, but fine.
Honestly, I don't much like having strangers in my house.<eos> Yes, but these maids aren't strangers.<eos> They're more like friends with feather dusters.<eos> No offense, but I'm just not a maid person.<eos> I only took this meeting to get you to stop calling.<eos> Hello, Cece.<eos> Evelyn, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I'm friends with Marisol.<eos> Now, when is the last time we saw each other?<eos> Your God-awful holiday party?
Ellen just bought a Putnam in Vail.<eos> You should come see it sometime.<eos> We fly in Richard's private jet.<eos> Private jet?<eos> Damn, girl!<eos> I mean, how else would you fly?<eos> So you'll come?<eos> Of course.<eos> But only if you come visit me in my chateau.<eos> In Switzerland.
Good. I've got your attention.<eos> Now come in and sit down.<eos> Lucky for you, I look like a young Jackie O. When I wear a head scarf.<eos> Why are you so hung up on Peter?<eos> You cheated on him.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Peter.<eos> He knows?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, dear.
Tell me everything that happened.<eos> Yeah. Absolutely.<eos> But first, tell me... how was your trip?<eos> How was that?<eos> Fine.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I got to put some clothes on.<eos> I'll be downstairs in a sec.<eos> Okay. All right.
That's for certain.<eos> You are just so... fabulous.<eos> I feel the same way about you.<eos> Goodbye, gorgeous.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Kyle dumped me.<eos> But then he sees Adrian at my house, and he's showing up shirtless?<eos> Why was Mr. Powell at your house?<eos> Forget that, how did Kyle look without a shirt?<eos> Oh, shockingly good.
Spence is out of prison?<eos> I thought you might like to visit him... since you're friends.<eos> That was before he murdered Peri.<eos> But he's going through withdrawal from drugs.<eos> Isn't that strange?<eos> Well, he's an addict.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You were his sponsor.<eos> Anyway, his mind is getting clear now, and he's been talking a lot.<eos> About what?
Listen...<eos> [Door closes] I'm sorry for hurting you.<eos> It was wrong for me to lie about moving away.<eos> If you didn't want to see me, you could have just said so.<eos> I did say so, but you kept coming around anyway.<eos> I needed a clean break because I was afraid of getting hurt.<eos> You were afraid?<eos> Look, I could tell you were never serious about me.<eos> We were never a match.<eos> At least not in your head.
Can I see him?<eos> He's out of town...<eos> Hawaii.<eos> Hawaii?<eos> We were supposed to go to Hawaii together.<eos> Can you get him on the phone?<eos> Can't.<eos> His cell's broken.<eos> Peter Hudson's office. 4:00?<eos> All right.
This is me.<eos> "Rosario... sweet, beautiful, oblivious."<eos> Aww [chuckles] that's so nice.<eos> What about my character?<eos> Nope.<eos> No Zoila.<eos> Come on!<eos> Oh, look, "Zelda... sarcastic, sour, elderly."<eos> Elderly.<eos> Elderly? !
I thought you'd be jealous.<eos> I am. But I'm also happy for you.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I like this one.<eos> You look amazing in red.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Oh, if you say so.<eos> I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.<eos> - Still jet-lagged?
If we're gonna be together, you always have to be on my side.<eos> We should be able to say anything to each other.<eos> Uh, in that case... there's something I should tell you.<eos> I slept with someone while you were gone.<eos> Oh, that's it.<eos> I thought it was gonna be something bad.<eos> That's not bad?<eos> No!<eos> While I was home, I slept with people, too.<eos> People?
Is he awake?<eos> Tell him hi.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't tell him who it is, just...<eos> What are you guys doing?<eos> You guys are lame.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Couldn't sleep.<eos> The first night in a place always weirds me out, you know.<eos> Kitchen.
I've had personal relations with the corpse for the past 60 years.<eos> He's gonna regret that phrase when he hears it back.<eos> Sounds like murder to me.<eos> Large glass of pinot grigio, please.<eos> You should get your detective hat on, Agatha.<eos> There's been bad blood between Ron Allen and Robert Struthers for years.<eos> They hated each other.<eos> Well, I've had quite enough of getting involved with murders, thank you very much.<eos> What time does the quiz start?<eos> Any minute now.
In front of my daughter?<eos> Come on, Mary.<eos> I'll be giving this evidence to the police and they'll want to know where you were.<eos> Thank you for supper.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> I can't cook anything English but, having grown up in Hong Kong, I'm your go-to man for Chinese.<eos> I've thought about you all day.<eos> You haven't.<eos> You've thought about the launch and whether it's going to go well.<eos> Well, yeah, the launch and then you.
Two vegan raw apple pies.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Whoever called this apple pie is a liar.<eos> It's like someone sneezed in my mouth.<eos> Um, so, your parents... they're... they're cool with you being gay and vegan and getting petitions signed in parking lots?<eos> Yeah, my parents live in a tree.<eos> Yours?<eos> House.
# Oh, I love it #<eos> # Oh, hey #<eos> Sorry.<eos> I never thought being vegan could be this much fun.<eos> Okay, now, twist and flip.<eos> Go.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Ugh!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> All right.
I finally liked a guy, and he didn't like me back.<eos> Well, if he didn't like you back, then he's obviously stupid and has no taste.<eos> Why would you want to date a stupid boy with no taste who lives in a parking lot and accosts innocent people who are just trying to buy crafts?<eos> Ohh.<eos> Am I really judgmental and terrifying?<eos> You are.<eos> But this time, you used your powers for good.<eos> I mean, he doesn't eat meat.<eos> You mean for lent?<eos> No, like, ever.
Neither am I. Fuck being a victim.<eos> I wanna be your friend, Bea.<eos> Even though you shot me to the cops.<eos> Welcome home!<eos> She's back!<eos> Courtesy of the Red...<eos> To no more breast feeding, luv.<eos> Shhhh... You'll wake Josh!<eos> Yes?<eos> What time?
Prisoner Ferguson.<eos> Is there anything you need?<eos> Pencil...<eos> I want to write a letter.<eos> You can't be trusted with pencils.<eos> I didn't want you here.<eos> I petitioned corrections to have you remanded into state.<eos> Your lawyer fought the petition.<eos> Why? I wanted to see what it looks like.<eos> The prison?
Comfort yourself.<eos> You did a good deed in a hard world.<eos> Would you mind, Sarah, keeping an eye?<eos> I don't like to ask, but...<eos> 'Course I'll mind the lad.<eos> It'll be a pleasure.<eos> To think... you said you'd never be a miner's lass.<eos> I'll be your lass, Joe.<eos> Here in the woods, where nothing's real and anything's possible.<eos> - But in the real world...
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something, and I think it's...<eos> Oh, no, no. No, Chips.<eos> Oh, please, no.<eos> Oh, it is so embarrassing.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Just marry me, please.<eos> You and I can have a wonderful life.<eos> If you'll go back with me and marry me, you'll make me the happiest man in... in...<eos> Back where?<eos> Bakersfield, California.
We still have a confession on camera!<eos> I'm out.<eos> Afternoon, ma'am.<eos> The nursery guy left that<eos> - for you. - The nursery guy?<eos> I mean, I always assumed it was horrible at Quitman, just nothing as horrible as what I heard on that tape.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - I want to tell you.<eos> Ah... ‭Nice.<eos> You okay?
Wait, can you say that again?<eos> She called my father, and they both together, everybody kick me out.<eos> It's not so cool.<eos> It's over.<eos> And I'm... I have new life now.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Chip?<eos> Hey, Eddie, um, when this is done, I was thinking we could go to breakfast?<eos> - Breakfast.<eos> Yeah, huh?
Hello. Uh, your door was open. Hello.<eos> Uh, howdy. Uh... uh...<eos> That's very dangerous.<eos> There's a lot of crazy people out there.<eos> It's not safe to leave your door open like that, but anyway, um, yeah, uh, do you know Chip Baskets?<eos> - Yes. - Okay, do... do you know if he's home?<eos> Uh, is he home?<eos> No, um, he's actually at the hospital dealing with a coma.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Hmm, yeah. All right.
It's just going to be more different than I thought.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, me too. Don't be so feeble. Go back and shout at him!<eos> What, so he has an excuse to throw me into the sea or kill me?<eos> - Oh, have some moral courage.<eos> - Stop it, you two.<eos> When have you ever shown any moral courage?<eos> Whatever that is.<eos> I show moral courage in my writing every day.<eos> What writing? !
Crapper, dunny, thunder box.<eos> - I think he means the lavatory.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I know that... now.<eos> It's round the back.<eos> Excuse me. (What the hell did you think you were doing,<eos> - He's a breath of fresh air.<eos> - Oh!<eos> This is what happens when women let men rule the roost. Get up!<eos> - Bye. - Oh,
But why is the mother so horrible?<eos> Everything isn't about you.<eos> Oh, nothing is about me.<eos> My life is devoured by my children.<eos> In 21 years I haven't thought about myself for five consecutive minutes.<eos> But it's good, isn't it?<eos> Did you like the ending?<eos> Yes, Larry, it's very good.<eos> You're going to make us very proud.<eos> In this family?
Anyone home?<eos> It's all right. Stay here.<eos> I'll be home soon.<eos> Promise.<eos> OK.<eos> Roger!<eos> This is my friend Sven.<eos> As I hoped, he has done this operation before.<eos> Once.<eos> On an animal.
Don't wolf your breakfast.<eos> Is it nice?<eos> Oh, Gerry.<eos> What have I done wrong now?<eos> Go and see your friend Kosti.<eos> Thank you, Mum.<eos> You're more responsible than all of us.<eos> I should trust you more.<eos> I'm not being inconsistent, I'm being flexible.<eos> - Good.
- Oh, well done.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Did you decide to go by date order or patient name?<eos> Um, patient height.<eos> - Height? - Yes.<eos> It's the first thing on your form, so it must be important.<eos> Taller patients are up here.<eos> So no need to remember names ... which I always forget anyway.<eos> You just need to remember how tall they are.<eos> - Right.
He's still learning where to place the cutlery around the table.<eos> So I am delighted to have you here as my companion.<eos> Mowgli!<eos> Something's crawled into it.<eos> It's two beautiful bats.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't want to see bats!<eos> No more frigging wildlife out here.<eos> They've got to go somewhere.<eos> Outdoors?
Well, it's not true.<eos> Is it?<eos> Leslie, just... come home.<eos> Lugaretzia's beside herself.<eos> Larry's written you a very funny poem based on the Ballad Of Reading Gaol.<eos> Well, we all miss you, darling, terribly.<eos> Well, I don't miss you.<eos> Lady Margo, you are stunning.<eos> Yes, Angel, I am.<eos> Very much so...
No.<eos> I like children, your children.<eos> But it's true, I'm used to being on my own.<eos> Perhaps change makes me anxious.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, no, that was good.<eos> Well, don't stop there!<eos> So it is me.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> Whisky inside.
I don't like it when she does that.<eos> No.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> Who peed on my shoes?<eos> Your mother.<eos> These were very expensive.<eos> We went on a special trip to London to get them.<eos> I don't think we can be best friends any more.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Oh, my goodness.
In English, please.<eos> The defendant ...<eos> Leslie is far more likely to shoot the turkeys on his own.<eos> Paradoxically, he loathes dogs.<eos> So he wouldn't go killing turkeys with Gerry's dog.<eos> No.<eos> If my client killed your turkeys, as you say, where are the carcasses?<eos> He disposed of them.<eos> You are wasting the time of the court if you have no evidence.<eos> Excellent point.
Well, erm, this way!<eos> - Hairete.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Oh, what rough hands you have. - Huh?<eos> It's from Little Red Riding Hood.<eos> Mm, that isn't.<eos> We mustn't.<eos> We'll get into trouble.<eos> I think about you... very much.<eos> Oh. Well, in that case...
We mustn't.<eos> We'll get into trouble.<eos> I think about you... very much.<eos> Oh. Well, in that case...<eos> An immoderate volume of creatures. Yes.<eos> Gerry collects them.<eos> And we won the turkeys in a court case.<eos> Animals are walking germ dispensers.<eos> Are they safe?<eos> Mostly.
Is something wrong?<eos> My scary aunt. She knows about us.<eos> And I was going to pretend to be a travelling donkey salesman.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> And I've missed you.<eos> Because I have decided I love you.<eos> Well, that's good because I love you too.<eos> Right, I am going to...<eos> - Where are our guests?<eos> - In the bedrooms.
- Oh, don't be silly, Larry.<eos> - You know why?<eos> Because art is clearly run by buffoons and tainted by misguided notions of commercialism.<eos> Well, if that's true, it's beastly.<eos> I'm throwing myself into manly things ... like Leslie, but better.<eos> - So, what needs mending?<eos> - The house.<eos> Well, let's narrow it down for him a bit.<eos> Er... the lavatory roof?<eos> Good.
I could go on.<eos> In fact I will.<eos> The museum seems to be shut.<eos> Which is such a shame, because it's full of spellbinding artefacts.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I'll go in the middle again.<eos> - I have to be by the window.<eos> - She has claustrophobia.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - In an open-top car?
Let's think about this.<eos> Well, what are you going to do?<eos> I am going to sit... calmly... with you, as you're here and wait... for someone to come by.<eos> And even though you were very rude to Spiro, I'm sure he won't begrudge you a sweet.<eos> Do I have to tell you how close we are to plummeting to our deaths?<eos> Oh!<eos> There.<eos> Our knight in shining armour.<eos> You will reassure your family about my...<eos> - ...dark moments?
Is he going to be all right?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Dr Petridis is away again.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Leslie's mishap, perhaps it's a sign.<eos> I mean, we don't need to keep them to love them.<eos> I know.<eos> Is it time to set them all free?<eos> We could do it at the wedding party tomorrow, as a symbol of... something.<eos> All right.
All right.<eos> Let me just put these in real quick.<eos> Man, I can't figure that kid out sometimes.<eos> I wonder if his doppelganger's that complicated.<eos> Any ideas?<eos> Well, the best plan we've come up with so far is to set off a nuclear warhead next to the city's electrical grid, so...<eos> We're not gonna do that.<eos> I think I thought of something though.<eos> Tell me everything that you know about Cisco's doppelganger.<eos> Reverb.
So, if you still haven't found a place to live, live here.<eos> I mean, it's yours if you want to.<eos> You're serious?<eos> I'm not gonna do your laundry. And I'm not washing dishes after you.<eos> And this bed is going to be made every morning before you leave. And there will be no beer in that fridge, but yeah, it's yours.<eos> When can I move in?<eos> Whenever you want.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Hey, man.
Or whatever his real name is.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, you remember when I was looking for his doppelganger, right? Yeah.<eos> And you couldn't find him.<eos> Because there is no Jay Garrick on this Earth.<eos> His doppelganger's name is Hunter Zolomon.<eos> Hunter Zolomon?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> Well, because on my Earth,
Until the night your particle accelerator exploded. That's right.<eos> The dark matter crept into the mental asylum.<eos> I had thought... piping the explosion underground would limit exposure.<eos> All it did was create an unstoppable monster. NOTORIOUS SERIAL KILLER CAUGHT!<eos> He's not unstoppable.<eos> Jay doesn't know that we know who he really is.<eos> He thinks that his past is a secret.<eos> - I think I have an idea of how we can stop him.<eos> Are you sure Jay can't get in here?<eos> Pretty sure, but just in case.
On any Earth.<eos> You can't lock up the darkness.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> You can't lock up the darkness.<eos> No!<eos> - He was right there. - I know.<eos> I mean, we had him.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - Wally?<eos> - Up here!
I won't fail you again.<eos> Lord, You know my pain and distress, you understand the fear in my heart.<eos> I draw my strength from you, and live in your limitless grace.<eos> Stay away.<eos> I'm not here to hurt you, okay?<eos> You're the key.<eos> We need your light.<eos> What do you mean "we"?<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> The nameless.
Lord, You know my pain and distress, you understand the fear in my heart.<eos> I draw my strength from you, and live in your limitless grace.<eos> Stay away.<eos> I'm not here to hurt you, okay?<eos> You're the key.<eos> We need your light.<eos> What do you mean "we"?<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> The nameless.<eos> The numberless.
At Lindsay Denton's first trial she was convicted of conspiracy to murder, and the prosecution hung on crucial evidence found at her home address, namely 50 grand in cash that was linked via financial forensics to other bribes employed in the conspiracy.<eos> I didn't plant that money.<eos> Image 49.<eos> Image 49 shows item reference VCT-11.<eos> Now, VCT-11 is a? 5 note.<eos> Is that your?<eos> I don't remember having any money in the bag.<eos> Not your phone, now it's not your money either.<eos> I'm saying I don't recall if I was carrying any money in the bag.<eos> Fair enough.
To hide his movements?<eos> It doesn't make sense, sir, she wouldn't have got in the car.<eos> If Steve turned up with fake plates she'd have known he was up to something.<eos> She would never get in. Or maybe she just didn't see it.<eos> We all know Lindsay, sir, she never missed a thing.<eos> Sorry, Kate, you couldn't give us a hand with the lift?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Off the record,<eos> DI Cottan put pressure on me not to tell Steve about the additional forensics on the envelope found in Danny Waldron's flat.<eos> Cheers, Maneet.
DI Cottan, stay right there.<eos> You do not have to say anything, however, it may harm your defence if you fail to mention something, under questioning, that you later go on to rely on in court.<eos> Of course, anything you do say may be used in evidence.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, what the hell are you doing searching my car?<eos> This is a signed authority from Superintendent Summers of AC-3 to investigate AC-12 officers, based on concerns raised by DC Fleming.<eos> OK.<eos> Just doing our job here, there is nothing personal.<eos> OK, it was obviously investigating Steven Arnott.<eos> Not me.
Pardon me if I don't see the significance.<eos> On screen, image 909.<eos> Image 909 is item reference SJP-32.<eos> It was detected in the boot of a vehicle found at the Edge Park Golf Club in July of 2012.<eos> The vehicle is registered to Alex Campbell -- the alias being used at the time by one John Thomas Hunter.<eos> Now, it was known Tommy Hunter used numerous such phones to conduct his criminal activities.<eos> But this particular phone is of interest to us because of a call made on the 8th of July 2012 at around midnight.<eos> It was from Hunter's phone to yours.<eos> And that's the significance, fella.<eos> In black and white.
Yeah, so what was that lead that was going to pan out?<eos> Well, it couldn't have been the money in Steve's gym bag, because that wasn't discovered until the forensics carried out a search in the service vehicle the next day.<eos> Arnott was behaving suspiciously and I wanted to give Kate a heads up, as they had been partners for a long time.<eos> Oh, that's very considerate of you, but I will ask you for a second time -- what was the lead?<eos> Erm... .. I had glimpsed some banknotes in his gym bag, I intended to investigate.<eos> When did you see the banknotes?<eos> Earlier that day.<eos> But how could you have known that forensics would connect them to the money planted at Lindsay's?<eos> DI Cottan, were you able to forewarn Kate because you had a scheme in mind where you were going to plant that money in Steve's service vehicle?<eos> No. No, absolutely not.
Which story do you want?<eos> It's not one that ever ends.<eos> Like, last month I came out to the fork-lift operator at the roofing-supply store.<eos> The first time you were with a woman?<eos> It wasn't a surprise or anything,<eos> I was only ever attracted to women.<eos> You never thought that sweating rush that things could be different for you?<eos> Every time I look at you.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> Okay.
Drag him out of the shadows.<eos> Exposing him for what he is.<eos> What are you doing up?<eos> It's Remembrance Day.<eos> There's no school.<eos> I have stuff to do.<eos> I'll see you at the memorial.<eos> Wait a minute, wait.<eos> Wait... wait a minute, Megan.<eos> Amber?
- Hey. - He did this to me!<eos> - He did this to me! - Hey.<eos> Hey! We gotta go.<eos> He did this to me.<eos> Rev.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. You get some rest, huh?<eos> See a doctor about that.<eos> What, about this?<eos> Or this?
No. The RC car on the top row, on the left.<eos> Huh? Your other left!
Don't wanna be seen hopping' in the car with the... town lunatic.<eos> Well, it had crossed my mind.<eos> You'd be helping salvage my reputation if you were to let me do you a good turn.<eos> I don't know, Reverend.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right.<eos> Kyle Barnes.<eos> As I live and breathe.<eos> I need to talk to Sidney.<eos> About what?
I will cross the line to protect them.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You're offering me a seat in my own home?<eos> This house belongs to God and the people of this congregation.<eos> Not you.<eos> As chairman of the Board of Deacons, I convened an emergency meeting this morning.<eos> Well, I guess that would explain why none of you were at the service.<eos> You think this is a joking matter?<eos> After your behavior?
You never asked me why. Why I hit her.<eos> Was I drunk or did I lose my temper.<eos> Like, you knew I always had a temper.<eos> But this at least, it didn't make sense, did it?<eos> It didn't makes sense to anybody.<eos> I need you to keep that in mind right now.<eos> I need you to hold on to that because... none of this is gonna make any sense, ever.<eos> I was trying to protect them.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - That day.
Because that's what I've been protecting her from this entire time, that memory.<eos> Because I know if she remembers everything, she's not gonna be able to live with herself.<eos> I gotta find her, Megan.<eos> I should've called first.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.<eos> You've been fightin'.<eos> For a while now... for the first time... I feel like I'm losin'.<eos> I'm Aaron. Aaron McCready.<eos> Okay.
What are you talking about?<eos> His friend, the Reverend.<eos> All that stuff he's been saying about the devil coming to town, it's no joke.<eos> Okay, you get on home now.<eos> No.<eos> Please!<eos> I will tell him you were here.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't make me go back out there.<eos> All right, son.
What will you do now?<eos> I'll start farming on our own plot of land.<eos> It's hard work, but at least I will be able to give the girls time.<eos> Titu... put this in the car.<eos> Wait... go...<eos> Yes, Mahavir Singh-ji, what were you saying?<eos> If I could get some funds, it would help a lot.<eos> My girl has now reached the state level.<eos> So... What is the big deal in reaching state level?<eos> That too in ladies wrestling?
She's playing well.<eos> If you support her today, then one day, she will make the nation proud.<eos> Look, Mahavir Singh-ji, we get this much funding for sports.<eos> Wrestling gets this much.<eos> Keep aside gents wrestling, then remove coaching, dieting, traveling, equipment, etc.<eos> All that remains for ladies wrestling is this much.<eos> And for this much, you bought me a box of sweets.<eos> But you have our complete support.<eos> The reason India doesn't win medals, is because officers like you are warming these seats.<eos> Alright.
Hold me. Tight.<eos> Push your thumbs in this way, and move it to the side.<eos> Not in the front... but to the side.<eos> Break and attack. What's wrong with my technique?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> No, papa.<eos> It's not wrong. This is more correct.<eos> Coach-sir has taught it.<eos> So now you are an expert?<eos> International?
What happened today wasn't right.<eos> What wasn't right?<eos> This was bound to happen.<eos> Someone had to tell papa that his techniques are weak.<eos> His techniques aren't weak.<eos> He's become a little weak.<eos> And don't forget that you've won the Nationals, based on his "weak" techniques.<eos> You can win the Nationals with these techniques, Babita, not international matches.<eos> And the sooner you realize this, the better.<eos> Alright.
Sir, they have just one fault.<eos> That their father is crazy.<eos> He is so crazy about getting a gold for the country, that in their childhood itself he snatched away their toys, and made them wrestle.<eos> When they resisted, he cut their hair off.<eos> In order to prepare them, he made them wrestle boys.<eos> Took the taunts and abuses of the entire village, just so that one day they would make the country proud.<eos> Look, sir.<eos> Look.<eos> These 50 rupees she won at Rohtak.<eos> This in Hisar.
No?<eos> I'm surprised she's made it so far but I am happy for her.<eos> It should be an interesting final tomorrow.<eos> Playing an Indian in front of an Indian crowd.<eos> Beating her, of course!<eos> Angelina, any pressure before the finals?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure she must be under tremendous pressure.<eos> I've beaten her twice.<eos> First round?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, first round.
How?<eos> Bio-chem was one of my majors in college.<eos> One of your majors?<eos> How many did you have?<eos> Five.<eos> What, is that not common here?<eos> Girl, no, that is not common anywhere.<eos> All right, let's search for that Grey, see what we come up with.<eos> I'll see if facial recognition brings him up and I'll have Joe check CCPD's database.<eos> Cool.
Is she okay? Tell me!<eos> Is she gonna be okay?<eos> - Get him out of here. - Sir...<eos> When I woke up, the police told me they'd found Catherine in the woods and she had blood on her.<eos> Is that it?<eos> We're done?<eos> Yeah. Just run a little spell check, and...<eos> What'd I tell you?<eos> Typing skills like a boss.<eos> You okay?
Sam told you not to book it?<eos> You work for me.<eos> You get confused, I'll find a new secretary.<eos> Assistant.<eos> I'll call you what you want when you stop rubbing up on the interns.<eos> Don't deny it.<eos> Just think with your big head instead of your little one from now on.<eos> Go.<eos> You're where?<eos> The psych ward.
- You don't have to worry. I talked about my childhood to get her off my back.<eos> It worked.<eos> Must have been nice, though, to talk to someone.<eos> I mean, we don't ever really do that.<eos> And I get it...<eos> It's not like we need to be up each other's butts all the time. It's just...<eos> I thought maybe it'd be nice if we didn't lie to each other from now on.<eos> - Who's lying to you?<eos> - That I know of?<eos> Walsh.
But then I went into the corner office and saw him --<eos> Mr. Mahoney.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Charles.<eos> The young one.<eos> The older one never stayed that late.<eos> We talked about the weather -- something like that, how the rain hadn't let up.<eos> And, um...then I left.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> The rain.
See?<eos> Now get up and get some work done for once.<eos> We beat his ass. We beat his ass. We beat his ass.<eos> He can suck on my --<eos> Well, that didn't last very long, did it?<eos> When was this?<eos> - Last night. - He's here in town?<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Alone.
Alone.<eos> Now is not a good time, Laurel.<eos> I don't care.<eos> - You will when you see this video.<eos> - Philip's stalking us.<eos> I said I don't care!<eos> Now.<eos> Did you know this whole time?<eos> Know what?<eos> This.
You're the one who made him go to Ohio.<eos> Because you gave him that file.<eos> Why? So that he could go on a treasure hunt and find out his mother was killed?<eos> Sounds crazy, I know, but...<eos> "Crazy" is not a word we use lightly around here.<eos> I'm just saying I know how it sounds.<eos> It's why I came here.<eos> I don't know how to talk to anyone else about it.<eos> You mean Annalise?<eos> Yes. But everyone else, too.
Your dad has nothing to do with who you are.<eos> So, please just... don't do anything else till Annalise is back.<eos> You're right.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> We kissed... once... but it's never gonna happen again.<eos> And I think we've got way more pressing issues than who both of us are screwing.<eos> - You're screwing him, too?<eos> - No. God!<eos> Fine. You want to know what we were talking about?<eos> Our crappy fathers.
No deal.<eos> We know who the killer is here.<eos> You mean Philip Jessup?<eos> He's here, if you want to ask him anything.<eos> After a two-week manhunt, police have located alleged murder suspect Philip Jessup right here in Philadelphia.<eos> Sources say Jessup contacted police himself, claiming he had new information about the Hapstall murders, some of which has now led police to again look at Caleb Hapstall as the prime suspect in this case.<eos> Are we supposed to believe any of this?<eos> Haven't you learned not to ask that question by now?<eos> True or not, she's brilliant.<eos> - against Hapstall... - You okay?
At the time for me.<eos> I see a guy with a hat.<eos> They're in band.<eos> They are going to move, make a campfire...<eos> I'll fire them.<eos> * -chut!<eos> - Hush!<eos> I do not want any more noise.<eos> Okay, I'm telling them. Count on me.<eos> Okay.
Whore!<eos> No!<eos> What the hell are I doing here?<eos> Oh no!<eos> Shit!<eos> It was not raining two minutes ago.<eos> I will find a solution.<eos> Hello? How are you, my favorite Samantha?<eos> Where are you?<eos> In London.
Bernie.<eos> Stop darting the delivery men.<eos> Tomorrow, honey.<eos> Come on, we go up.<eos> It goes into 5 min!<eos> What is this scarf with cat paws?<eos> It's a silk stole.<eos> A little camouflage tone on tone sublime.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.
A little camouflage tone on tone sublime.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> * -Jack bates!<eos> He lost his past.<eos> He never had a present.<eos> He is fighting for the future.<eos> Bates is back.<eos> Season 8.<eos> Exclusively on channel 4.
- No?<eos> - No, it's not good.<eos> Not at all!<eos> It is raining!<eos> It's the monsoon, damn! Whore!<eos> She knows everything about her mother.<eos> She holds a notebook.<eos> Notebook...<eos> Must be unstoppable.<eos> Even on the weather.
I'm not telling you it's easy, just that you have to do it.<eos> So, tonight, you stop sending fake emails.<eos> And tell the truth to your daughter.<eos> It will be fine.<eos> Ho!<eos> Ho!<eos> At table, filibuster.<eos> Here is our Booty.<eos> Grilled crocodile.<eos> And its wild potatoes.
Okay.<eos> So...<eos> You like "bucu" tout "le" France.<eos> Or a part of "the" France?<eos> What?<eos> I like "bucu" the south of "the" France.<eos> The "zaousse".<eos> The "zaousse"?<eos> Yes, the "zaousse".<eos> At the seaside.
Yeah, very good.<eos> He does not care about me.<eos> He does not care about me.<eos> There is a toilet for 300 people.<eos> "Why do you prefer lowell more than daddy?"<eos> But I never said that.<eos> No, but if you thought the other way around, you'd be at home with us.<eos> We can see each other without living in the same house.<eos> It does not mean we love each other less.<eos> Okay?

Is not that a problem?<eos> Well, you know.<eos> In fact no.<eos> Sorry excuse me. Without warning, it is complicated. There are standards.<eos> Hein... hey, Bernie?<eos> Secured, insurance...<eos> It is cheese. No?<eos> Cheese?<eos> Not really.<eos> - Okay.
You're immortal!<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hold on!<eos> No!<eos> Did you know this thing?<eos> "Of course!"<eos> I know where I'm going to take you.<eos> Here.<eos> It was here that I did not jump.<eos> Okay.
It's like that.<eos> It's life.<eos> That one day, Gloria will fall asleep and never wake up.<eos> The doctors had not been mistaken.<eos> Gloria left a few weeks after she passed. The most beautiful moments of his family life.<eos> My father prepared me to face my fears, and my daughter, to face life.<eos> There are sometimes falls that never stop, but I wanted every second of this fall to be a feast.<eos> And today I have engraved in each of these seconds with my daughter.<eos> Gloria is there, near me.<eos> Every moment.
There's just been a lot going on, and especially now with this new case.<eos> I actually think I'm gonna put Cat on it.<eos> You know, maybe we could work it together like the old days.<eos> Teamed up pretty well with her last week.<eos> I know, and she's probably right.<eos> I need to get back out into the field, you know?<eos> Anyway, I have to go.<eos> Do you want to meet at Il Cantuccio later for drinks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.
No, but you love it. Admit it.<eos> Yeah, you've been wanting to be a part of something bigger for a while now.<eos> You and JT both.<eos> That is not what this is about.<eos> If this Vic, Richter, can lead us to whoever put the bounty on Vincent, that's a good thing, right, for all of us.<eos> It means we can all go back to our normal lives.<eos> Yeah? Even better.<eos> If this guy turns out to be the same one who's behind your fight club case, then the ring is broken.<eos> Two birds, one stone.<eos> All right, okay.
This is it.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This place does not look ultra-exclusive, uh... it looks seedy.<eos> It doesn't seem like a place you'd find Pierre Medjani.<eos> Medjani?<eos> He don't show till the main event.<eos> And this ain't that.<eos> If you're here to fight, you got to sign in.<eos> Okay.
They tend to, uh, exercise their jurisdictional authority whenever the hell they feel like it, remember? Bad time.<eos> No, no. Whatever.<eos> I'm not mad anymore.<eos> Doesn't mean I like it.<eos> I was hoping we'd get to work together on cases, you know, like we used to.<eos> We still can, Tess, just in a different way. Seriously.<eos> Vincent told me that you were the one that found me, because you were on Medjani's trail the entire time and DHS wasn't.<eos> Imagine, we could just share resources, work together on a bunch of cases. It could be great.<eos> You sure DHS is really what you want?<eos> For now, yeah.
And they brought her back to me on the ward in the middle of the night.<eos> My fear was that they were... were bringing her back to say goodbye.<eos> And, erm...<eos> It must have been... the way she was lying, but when I looked at her, big tubes in her little body, and she... she moved her... her head a little.<eos> Yes?<eos> And there it was.<eos> Like a little curl.<eos> Stuck to the side of her head.<eos> And then, I just knew that everything was going to be fine.<eos> Deep inside.

Thank you, thank you.<eos> All right, you get the box.<eos> It depends, is it too heavy?<eos> No, it's light.<eos> Use your mucles. There you go.<eos> Mucles.<eos> Mucles. Don't leave your bags in the hallway.<eos> Hello.<eos> Right, OK. Well, just... just give me five minutes, Jimmy.<eos> Bye.
Wouldn't that be something, driving along at 45 miles per hour?<eos> It really would.<eos> Well, I've got some news for you.<eos> - Whose car is that parked outside?<eos> - It's ours.<eos> - We've got a car? ! - Ha-ha-hah!<eos> How fast are we going?<eos> 27 miles per hour.<eos> You know, I think I'd be rather good at this driving lark.<eos> Absolutely not.
Everything OK?<eos> We were just congratulating Mr Dillon on his financial acumen.<eos> The magician of the Square Mile.<eos> He is a great asset.<eos> - Evening, Gentlemen.<eos> - That's it, Jimmy.<eos> Do as your owner tells you.<eos> Keep walking, it's fine, it's fine.<eos> They're just looking for sport.<eos> Everything all right?
They really can't behave, can they?<eos> I think Harry rather enjoys the spectacle.<eos> Harry loves the spectacle.<eos> Mae, how are you this evening?<eos> I'm sorry, do I know you?<eos> Lord Loxley was a member of our club.<eos> How marvellous for you.<eos> Not sure he would have approved of your choice of... companion.<eos> But then, you are on holiday.<eos> An 'exotic' holiday.
You were dead against it before.<eos> I just, I feel we've been running around the whole time, looking for something and maybe we've already got it.<eos> Maybe we can make it even stronger.<eos> You have a visitor, sir.<eos> Mrs de Bolotoff left him in the living room.<eos> Thank you, Fraser.<eos> Mr D'Ancona came to see me.<eos> Wanted me to remind you of certain outstanding matters.<eos> - Are you in his employ now?<eos> - Certainly not.
Where is she? !<eos> Where is Emma Peters? !<eos> The place is empty, but she was definitely here.<eos> - You sure? - Yeah.<eos> We found this.<eos> Cracked cellphone case.<eos> It's Emma's.<eos> There was a couple empty beds in the room.<eos> Could have been used as some kind of a way station.<eos> On the road to where?
Could have been used as some kind of a way station.<eos> On the road to where?<eos> All right. Turkish Intelligence, they identified our guy back there.<eos> His name is Marko Bashir.<eos> Iraqi National.<eos> Well, his left hook says he's probably not the brains behind all this.<eos> Yeah, I would agree. The Turks have him pegged as a smuggler... weapons and women.<eos> That's some callus on your forehead.<eos> Take his shoes off.<eos> As well as on your feet.
I need to speak with Ms. Marion Codwell.<eos> Please follow me.<eos> Ms. Codwell, this is agent Seger from the FBI.<eos> Agent Seger, what can I do for you?<eos> We have reason to believe that your office's servers have been hacked and used to send a series of illicit communications.<eos> Our server is the envy of your friends at Fort Meade in Maryland.<eos> It's literally impossible for it to have been hacked.<eos> Well, if that's the case, Ms. Codwell, that means these communications originated in this building...<eos> In your office.<eos> Indeed.
Ben Wheeler.<eos> We went to high school together?<eos> We did?<eos> I sat behind you in homeroom for three years.<eos> You did?<eos> I only remember some annoying guy with braces.<eos> Oh, my God, it is you!<eos> Danny Wheeler's little brother!<eos> How is he?<eos> Well, after the utter bliss of my honeymoon...
You know, if you had such strong feelings, you should have just expressed them instead of keeping them bottled up. A yearbook would have been a perfect place to do that.<eos> I'm a therapist now.<eos> Here's my card.<eos> So, what's the deal, Wheeler?<eos> Are you cool moving on from this high school stuff?<eos> 'Cause if you can't, it's gonna make it way too awkward for me to work here, and I really like this job.<eos> You don't still like me, do you?<eos> Oh, my God, no.<eos> No. Haha.<eos> No, not at all.
Well, I'm quite sure I washed at least one of your shirts.<eos> - And then there's so much linen. - All right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Yeah, a little damp, but, ah...<eos> Here you go, Connor. Here.<eos> - No.<eos> - Come on, Connor.<eos> - No.<eos> - All right, all right, all right.
No, I am the mother of a boy who is lost.<eos> How is he lost?<eos> I gave him up.<eos> God bless him.<eos> Er, I would have kept him, but you see what I'm reduced to.<eos> So I put him in the workhouse.<eos> Oh God, what has become of him?<eos> Do you believe some harm has come to him?<eos> - Sir, I do fear it.<eos> - In the workhouse?
I know the schools, I know the jobs, I know the shelters.<eos> Now, whatever you're up to, whatever else you're hiding, I'm watching you.<eos> Clear?<eos> Crystal.<eos> Good luck.<eos> At least tell Carol I said hello.<eos> Enjoy your pie.<eos> - Hey, bro.<eos> How you doing?<eos> - Oh, yeah.
What about you?<eos> When are you heading back?<eos> I'm not.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Just think I'm gonna hang out down here a couple days, poke around a little bit.<eos> For what?<eos> All that shit you told me that went down with Danny at the motel...<eos> Well, that sounded very, very interesting.<eos> Interesting how?
What do you want?<eos> I wanna be your lifeline.<eos> So, now you're gonna make me an offer.<eos> How nice.<eos> What's on the table, Detective?<eos> - Twenty-five years.<eos> - Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> You give names, you keep your nose clean... you will be out in ten.<eos> I give them up, I'm dead.<eos> Even in prison.
I'm still with Xavier.<eos> What do you want me to do with him?<eos> Where are you?<eos> In my car.<eos> He's sitting right next to me.<eos> Don't let him out of your sight.<eos> We need to talk to him.<eos> Yeah, I definitely need to talk to him.<eos> Where?<eos> Precinct? No.
And, Nick, Monroe told me about Juliette.<eos> You really think it was her?<eos> I know it was her.<eos> Oh, my God, this is insane.<eos> Let me know when you hear back from the Council.<eos> You ever hear of Black Claw?<eos> Oh, hell yeah.<eos> My last two jobs had to do with them.<eos> Here?<eos> No, Lisbon and Bangkok.
"Dear R, "I thought you might write me back "after I told you about Carlos dying.<eos> "Maybe you don't want to hear from me.<eos> "But I don't know what you think "about what we used to have together.<eos> "I'm thinking about coming to Portland..."<eos> My God, I don't want to deal with this!<eos> Hang on a second. This guy is obviously contacting you for a reason.<eos> Don't you think we got to figure out why?<eos> I mean, he just said he's thinking of coming to Portland.<eos> What does this guy want from you?<eos> After all this time?
What if she shows up after he does?<eos> What if she doesn't show up at all?<eos> Who?<eos> Who what?<eos> Who you were talking about.<eos> Oh, uh...<eos> No. That was something else altogether.<eos> Hey, look at all the money we got for you.<eos> I know all about your plan. Plan?<eos> What plan?
Certainly, if you could and did, you'd have fixed upon a much better choice of father.<eos> Or did you hold to the child's wish?<eos> "He had his reasons.<eos> He meant well at heart."<eos> Lies we tell ourselves at night so as not to feel in our souls like the shit of pigs.<eos> I owe my father a debt of gratitude.<eos> He was a pig shit and he knew it.<eos> - I tell myself no lies about my father.<eos> - No.<eos> Only lies about yourself.
- You are killing this.<eos> - You're killing it.<eos> - Responsible, organized, and one of the few people who can pull off orange.<eos> You are headed home, right?<eos> A good Safety Captain never leaves until everyone is safely out.<eos> - Hmm. - Hmm, that's true.<eos> Thanks again, Ana, for making me Safety Captain.<eos> It really means a lot to me.<eos> I need more cones.<eos> Okay, yes.
Yeah, she said something about getting home before the big storm and a story about her niece, which, frankly, I did not listen to.<eos> Why is everyone overreacting about the storm?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it's not that bad.<eos> Oh, it's bad.<eos> Oh, ah, where did he get all these cones?<eos> - What happened to your hair?<eos> - That.<eos> Hurricane Chloe is here, and it's really bad.<eos> The mayor has closed all roads, and everyone must stay adentro, okay?<eos> Not outdoors, indoors.
I'm his.<eos> So hurt me, and what do you think he'll do to you?<eos> Lucifer will never get out of that cell.<eos> Are you willing to stake your life on that? On Sam Winchester?<eos> !<eos> How long?<eos> How long have you been working for him?<eos> Not long.<eos> Lucifer came to me in a dream.<eos> Not that kind of dream.
Great, so he's bringing more of his friends over.<eos> That's what I told you he would do.<eos> Okay, well, Zoom must've lied to fake-Dante and told him I was the one who killed Reverb, 'cause dude wants me dead.<eos> We got to do something.<eos> What else do you know about him?<eos> He gets his power from that scythe he wields.<eos> Thing's legit too... it almost took half the van with him.<eos> All right, then that's what we need to do. We need to figure out a way to get it away from him.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, all right.
I mean, I don't know if I could go through what I went through last time if you get hurt.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Not really.<eos> Do you remember when I told you that I didn't want you going to Earth-2 if you felt like you didn't have anything left here?<eos> Yeah... because Patty left.<eos> It wasn't just because of Patty.<eos> Barry, you've always had someone to come home to.<eos> I've just been thinking a lot lately... About us.<eos> What Wells said about us being married in the future.<eos> And on Earth-2.
- of a lightning storm? - Really, Ramon.<eos> Chances of being struck are slim, indeed. Yeah, not when you're the one causing it.<eos> All we need is one lightning bolt to strike the satellite.<eos> The satellite circuitry's connected to the breach room.<eos> Barry's in the breach room.<eos> Just do it. Yeah. I'm doing it.<eos> Mozart better watch out.<eos> Cisco Ramon's about to conduct something nasty.<eos> You're gonna feel these clamps, but they're necessary.<eos> - You good?
Let me run it by my wife.<eos> I think she's around here somewhere, and I'll...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come on.<eos> Uh, let's not... [clears throat]<eos> Let's not bring a lady into this, right?<eos> This is guy stuff...<eos> You know, grills, football, cars, porn.<eos> Yeah, I'll just...<eos> I'll, uh... I'll call her.<eos> Yeah, all right.
I'm trying to be a hero here.<eos> You're right, babe.<eos> I'm tripping.<eos> I'm sure everything's fine.<eos> Whew, come on, Tommy.<eos> You've done this before, right?<eos> Make it quick.<eos> On three.<eos> One two.<eos> - Na Zdorovie.
Shit.<eos> ...this isn't so bad.<eos> You know, you could just put your hand on my crotch.<eos> It'd work a lot better.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Hey-- hey. Hey.<eos> Hey, are you pissed at me?<eos> You know, if you wanted to fag-freak out your family, you could have just told me.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> All right?
- It's too loud.<eos> What is your problem today?<eos> You're really gonna smoke this right in front of me?<eos> I'm minding my own business.<eos> Look, just because you're going through a thing or whatever it is you won't talk about does not mean you can act like an asshole.<eos> - So if you want to talk--<eos> - I don't need to talk.<eos> Just stop stressin' me.<eos> Damn.<eos> You okay?
Team bombing, on my left.<eos> Authorization Approved, Ms. Slater.<eos> Clearing his ship now...<eos> We have lost our infrared.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Find Gazakov.<eos> Is here. I can feel it.<eos> No, down!<eos> In front of you, brother.<eos> On my right.
You should see the other guy.<eos> - Well done, son.<eos> - Thank my Lord.<eos> Brandon, I want to talk to you.<eos> Some time ago, I told your father it was just a murderer.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> He had courage and guts.<eos> You are worthy son of your father, Gunny.<eos> I See you in the next.<eos> See.
I...<eos> I wanna do it myself.<eos> You sure you're all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something's gotta change here, Meg.<eos> I have to get some real help.<eos> You know, I actually could use a place to stay. For a night or two.<eos> Thank you. But I don't think I can afford this place.<eos> Where's home for you?<eos> Panhandle.
What can I do for you?<eos> I know you monitor the Coast Guard, their patrols.<eos> Anything you can give me on that?<eos> Might have a few beads on routes.<eos> How about patrol schedules?<eos> John, can't you ask the Coast Guard for this?<eos> I could, but I like you better.<eos> All right, I can probably get you something.<eos> I also need some information.<eos> - About?

Water's calm.<eos> I hear there's a party over at Big Torch.<eos> Not here.<eos> - When are they landing?<eos> - Should be there in about 30 minutes.<eos> Call me to confirm.<eos> John.<eos> We're heading out.<eos> - Where's Lowry?<eos> - The bait shop.
I think you want the relief.<eos> Marco.<eos> As soon as the bust went down, we moved on Lowry.<eos> You better get down to the bait shop. Now.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Moment of truth.<eos> Hank was right about Sugarloaf.<eos> - They walked right into us.<eos> - Where's Lowry?<eos> Inside.
To watch the animals in their cages?<eos> Ahmed's sleeping.<eos> Been sleeping a lot these days.<eos> I wanted to make sure that you're being taken care of.<eos> Well, Aziz is looking after us, as you can see.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> What crimes have we committed?<eos> We were allies, Bassam, you and I.<eos> If there are people who are angry at our family, who want to see someone punished, you can't let them take their revenge out on me, Bassam.<eos> Or on my son.
Or on my son.<eos> How is that going to make anything better? If we die?<eos> You're not completely in control here, are you?<eos> You're not eating.<eos> Are you upset?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Are you here for us?<eos> Yes.<eos> Honey?<eos> You okay?
People actually read this?<eos> Everybody's reading it.<eos> Well, they should know it's all exaggerated. To sell copies.<eos> The pictures make it look like you want to kiss him.<eos> It shows us kissing?<eos> No, it just... looks like you want to.<eos> To sell copies.<eos> Abu Omar is the one who took you, right?<eos> Did you hate him?<eos> At first.
He's told me almost nothing about you.<eos> I'm not all that important.<eos> Just a small part in his story.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> He obviously thinks very highly of you.<eos> And now we share in this job of taking care of Abuddin.<eos> We share many things.<eos> So I wanted to meet you.<eos> I'm honored.<eos> You okay?
Go, go, go.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Are you hungry?<eos> No money.<eos> You need to go.<eos> You and your money, go.<eos> - I'm calling the cops.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - The cops, right now...<eos> - All right, all right.
- Are you hungry?<eos> No money.<eos> You need to go.<eos> You and your money, go.<eos> - I'm calling the cops.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - The cops, right now...<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - I'm calling the cops.<eos> - All right, all right.
I'm Officer Tom.<eos> You called for me?<eos> There was a man here.<eos> A very bad man.<eos> - Do you live on this block?<eos> - Thirty-three years.<eos> Three... three.<eos> Did you ever see this bad man on your block?<eos> Did you ever see this bad man on your block?<eos> All right.
- Olivia, I didn't know you were in town.<eos> Oh, just a little visit.<eos> I miss seeing Dean's face sometimes.<eos> Don't tell him that.<eos> - Will you give us a few minutes?<eos> - No, she should stay.<eos> Oh, I know you have things to discuss.<eos> Like your husband withdrawing from the ticket.<eos> That's why she's in town, right?<eos> For the announcement.
Ahh!<eos> You're too much!<eos> - Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> - Conway!<eos> Conway!<eos> Conway!<eos> Yeah, I know, Fausto.<eos> I get exhausted just thinking about it, too.<eos> All right.
They certainly know how to take advantage of media attention.<eos> But whether that's the truth or not, this is an imminent threat which we must deal with immediately.<eos> I'm glad the president heard me and finally took General Brockhart's advice to heart.<eos> Now we'll just have to wait and see if it actually results in anything.<eos> I just hope it's not too little, too late.<eos> What are your plans now, Governor?<eos> Remain in Atlanta?<eos> No, Hannah and I are heading back on the trail.<eos> We accomplished what we needed to here in Georgia, and we're heading off to Arizona today and then Utah.<eos> Why Washington and not here?
Well, they, uh... moved me to the flower shop a few months ago.<eos> The basement.<eos> That's probably why you haven't seen me around.<eos> Never would've guessed that, well, that this would be my thing.<eos> I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks.<eos> - How's your grandson?<eos> - He's good, good.<eos> - Just started school again. - Mmm.<eos> - What grade is he in now?<eos> - Sixth grade.
- What would that achieve?<eos> - I admire that, Frank.<eos> I got angry with an old friend yesterday for calling me "Frank" instead of "Mr. President."<eos> Just for using your name?<eos> It wasn't the name, I suppose.<eos> It's the fact that he's leaving me.<eos> - Leaving you how?<eos> - New job.<eos> - Hmm. He worked for you?<eos> - Here in the White House.
I was there.<eos> That's gotta drive you crazy, huh?<eos> How much good press I'm getting out of this.<eos> - What's funny?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Come on, tell me.<eos> I want in on the joke.<eos> You think you can get under my skin.<eos> Oh, I got under your skin the first time we met.<eos> - When? New Year's?
We'll film in the basement.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Tell the senator I'll call him when I get back.<eos> - Cathy. I realize we haven't had a chance to discuss everything.<eos> We'll talk foreign policy consequences once we've resolved this hostage situation.<eos> It's not that. The Herald contacted me.<eos> A reporter called my office.<eos> I've read the email.<eos> - You didn't call them back?<eos> - 'Course not.
But corruption? That's a matter of perspective.<eos> No.<eos> It's a matter of law.<eos> All right, you seem a little confused here, Tom.<eos> One moment you're talking about my soul, and the next moment you want to get legal.<eos> Let's at least achieve some clarity here today, shall we?<eos> You want the real story?<eos> Zoe Barnes?<eos> Yes, we knew each other.<eos> Professionally.
# They laughed at us, and how # # But, oh, ho-ho # # Who's got the last laugh now?<eos> # Hey, could you make them hurry up downstairs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> - We're gonna lose this dude. Hey, it's nice to see some ladies here for once.<eos> Probably should've waited to schedule the celebration of a working mainframe until the mainframe was actually, you know, working.<eos> That reporter's gonna leave.<eos> All right, try that.<eos> Still not booting up.<eos> You okay?
I'm frustrated, too.<eos> We're five people living on top of each other, and that's...<eos> Donna, I'm frustrated because this was supposed to be temporary.<eos> - It is temporary.<eos> - No, it's been six mo...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Haley, sweetheart, get under the table.<eos> Joanie! - Mom!<eos> - It's okay, it's okay.<eos> You okay?
Oh, wow. That's gotta be fun.<eos> Yeah, you know, it's harder than it looks.<eos> Is this the gear?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah. Please go ahead.<eos> Um, I think it's in there somewhere. Oh, yeah.<eos> Hope the paint's okay.<eos> Yeah, no, he was a big Niners fan, right?<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> Uh, how do you know about that?<eos> What?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Please go ahead.<eos> Um, I think it's in there somewhere. Oh, yeah.<eos> Hope the paint's okay.<eos> Yeah, no, he was a big Niners fan, right?<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> Uh, how do you know about that?<eos> What?<eos> That he was a... wait, did we talk about him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My son.
And from what we hear, everyone wanted to be a part of it... Heads of state, Powers elite, movie stars.<eos> Who made the invite list?<eos> Stay tuned.<eos> But first, we're gonna show you exclusive footage from the Retro Girl murder scene.<eos> Again, we must warn you, this footage is not for the faint of heart.<eos> Fuck.<eos> There's this thing that I can't cancel.<eos> But I'll tell you what.<eos> Tomorrow, I'm all yours.<eos> And the day after that, and the day after that...
Personally, I'm counting the days to when the truth about that bitch comes out in the open.<eos> It's only a matter of time now.<eos> Christian.<eos> No.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Whatever game you're playing here, this one's on you.<eos> So this Lance guy just waltzing in here?<eos> That's a first, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> On every conceivable level.
With, uh, your help. A doctor?<eos> Yes, well, I used to be Special Forces.<eos> Uh, Vincent, he... he offered to help because Hill wanted to keep the operation quiet.<eos> That's why he set me up off-site.<eos> He didn't want the rest of DHS to know about what he was doing.<eos> Because he was afraid it would get out and alarm the public?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Exactly, yes.<eos> Then why did you kill Secretary Hill?<eos> In self-defense.
What am I gonna do, John? How am I gonna help you?<eos> Help me run this campaign.<eos> You're the only person I can trust.<eos> You should've fucking told me.<eos> Kev?<eos> How did it go at the doctor?<eos> - Everything went fine.<eos> - Yeah? Good.<eos> How's Nolan working out?<eos> What? Fine.
- Everything went fine.<eos> - Yeah? Good.<eos> How's Nolan working out?<eos> What? Fine.<eos> I don't know. He...<eos> He looks and acts an awful lot like Danny. It...<eos> Maybe I just have to get to know him better.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you like to invite him to dinner?<eos> What, like...? At our house?
What's happening?<eos> I think it's time you found your own place.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> I haven't been home in two months.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> You have until tomorrow.<eos> That's a nice way to treat family.<eos> Don't fucking try.<eos> What did the cops wanna talk to you about?<eos> Danny.
I don't give a fuck.<eos> You should have brought 'em home first. Tasha.<eos> But it's a good thing we won't have to have this conversation again. You know why?<eos> Because my kids won't be staying at that bitch's house again.<eos> - Tasha, be reasonable, okay?<eos> - Oh, I'm being reasonable.<eos> I'm gonna take Tariq home, and we can talk to him there later tonight.<eos> Medina.<eos> The fuck are you doing in this neck of the woods, Knox? Oh, it's nice to see you, too, Medina.<eos> You good?
Yeah, I heard you guys had Egan dead to rights, and he got sprung on a technicality.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no. Egan's not the guy.<eos> I know it's St. Patrick, all right?<eos> Only problem is, the only other person who can confirm that St. Patrick is the distributor is Vibora Ruiz.<eos> Now... I was hoping maybe you could use some of your DEA contacts, help me find him?<eos> Why aren't you using any of your contacts at Southern District?<eos> I'm trying to make sure Angela Valdes comes nowhere near this thing.<eos> She's, uh... unfortunately been compromised.<eos> - Fuck that toxic bitch.<eos> - Right. All right.
- Fuck that toxic bitch.<eos> - Right. All right.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> I'll get back at you.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Why would you bring a gun to school?<eos> I only took it for protection.<eos> Shawn got shot, so I thought it could happen to me too.<eos> At your private school on the Upper East Side?
E- mail. The works.<eos> Thanks. We appreciate that.<eos> Oh, and one more thing.<eos> Um... you might want to talk to Carol Finelli.<eos> She's the CEO of Tetra-Bit.<eos> When my guys got into their system, they grabbed her e-mails, and I remember them saying that a bunch of them were in Russian.<eos> On the advice of my lawyers, I can't comment on whether anybody from my company hacked Pentillion.<eos> If you want to avoid a warrant, Ms. Finelli, we're gonna need more than that.<eos> I said we'd cooperate, and we will.<eos> On the other matter...
Means and motive, Mr. Soble.<eos> Means, yes.<eos> But you couldn't be more wrong about motive.<eos> Did I know Zolotov was trying a little backdoor diplomacy?<eos> Yeah, but I didn't kill him.<eos> The fact is I had every reason to hope that he'd succeed.<eos> You just said war was good for your business.<eos> War's good for selling.<eos> Peace is where you cash in.<eos> Especially in this situation.
Your shares will be worthless.<eos> I'm not sure how you found out about Zolotov's peace mission, but once you thought it would derail your ambitions, you arranged to have him murdered.<eos> Try and keep the war going.<eos> You can't prove any of that.<eos> But I can.<eos> The phone in your hand contains an app that Fiona created to control cars loaded with her software.<eos> You just tried to use it to control your car. But she stopped you.<eos> Once she has your phone, she will retrieve the app's data and show that you used it to send two men to their deaths.<eos> Now, it's too late to, uh, dispose of the murder weapon, I'm afraid.<eos> All right... all right.
You know, like, not this, but,<eos> "Never have I ever eaten human flesh."<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> You drink if you have done it.<eos> Mm-hmm. I understand.<eos> I have another one.<eos> Never have I ever hooked up in the store.<eos> Really?<eos> You remember last week when Jerusha came by to talk about the mortgage?<eos> Oh. - In my office?
Both of us.<eos> Mum?<eos> He's someone's son.<eos> But not mine.<eos> You're sure?<eos> This isn't Jesse.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> You were right.<eos> A bespoke could back-up system.<eos> Server on the dark web.
On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month?<eos> That's correct.<eos> You're client's van matches - or is similar to - the van seem outside of Mr. Newman's address at the estimated time of death.<eos> We're talking about - and this is important, the 22nd of this month?<eos> The 22nd.<eos> I'm gonna have to halt proceedings.<eos> I can't be the solicitor on this case.<eos> See, on the afternoon of 22nd, my client was with me.<eos> What do you mean, "with you"?<eos> At my place, my apartment.
Mom, did you read the letters?<eos> I saw bits of some of them. Alan never gave them to me.<eos> They made him so mad.<eos> Same printed address on each letter, by the way.<eos> Been made with one of those rubber stamps.<eos> Every letter I did see, went on about there being "three acts".<eos> Don't know what they meant, but those two words would fill a whole page sometimes.<eos> "Three acts".<eos> When did you get these?<eos> Quite early on. '98, '99.
No response.<eos> You were simply telling the truth.<eos> That is a lot to process.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The conspiracy goes back all the way to Quantico.<eos> The terrorist...<eos> We've been calling them the "Voice."<eos> I thought it was someone from our class, but it could be... it could be anyone there.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> About what?
But here's the thing.<eos> In the field, what you went through, that's called Monday.<eos> And how you deal with it is the focus of today's exercise... crisis management.<eos> As agents, you need to be able to keep your wits about you at all times.<eos> You have to be able to confront the doubts and fears that live within all of us.<eos> Because if you can't, you don't stand a chance against the bad guys.<eos> So gather up your stuff.<eos> We're gonna go on a little trip.<eos> Last time we spoke, I know things got a little heated, but I hope I can count on you.<eos> For what?
So I could help you go undercover, help you find your friend.<eos> I-I-I appreciate that, but we're... we're talking about very dangerous people here.<eos> I-I can't ask you to risk your life...<eos> But you're not asking.<eos> I'm volunteering.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> When I was 9, I lost my sister in a car accident, and she could have lived, but my father wouldn't let the hospital give her a blood transfusion.<eos> He was a Christian scientist.<eos> Let's just say I'm not very fond of institutions that hurt the people who believe in them, and I'm not scared of them, either.<eos> All righty, then.
An unexpected answer.<eos> But in the end, you have to realize that sometimes... sometimes you're powerless and you did the best you could, and life does not always give you a happy ending.<eos> But it is still your job to do the right thing, the best thing.<eos> Even when it's not perfect, even if it costs you something, even if it costs you everything.<eos> Shelby, that's what you did today.<eos> And that's what I did, too.<eos> It is time for me to say goodbye...<eos> What?<eos> As your teacher.<eos> For now, at least.
We know that isn't always true.<eos> And honestly, I'm not ready to find out.<eos> I know you don't feel ready, but you're never going to feel ready.<eos> What happens if they disappear again and you never get the answers that you need?<eos> I know you, Shelby, and you will never stop wondering.<eos> When I lost my father, there was so much that was left unsaid.<eos> You have that chance.<eos> Use it.<eos> Caleb can find out for you if it's even possible.<eos> All right.
My parents are dead.<eos> They died five months ago in a small plane crash in Jordan trying to outrun the authorities that had been chasing them since they escaped.<eos> You and I weren't friends then.<eos> You wouldn't have known.<eos> [Telephone rings] Yeah? Woman:<eos> Agent Shaw, the story Wyatt told you checks out.<eos> It was need-to-know.<eos> She's clear.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.
He no come.<eos> Kovacs never arrived.<eos> Rafiki, does this look like an elephant bite?<eos> It does.<eos> And those look like the marks on Kovacs' body.<eos> This could lead to the cure.<eos> Could he have been bitten by an elephant?<eos> - Elephante.<eos> - Elephant?<eos> - In Patagonia?
Ward said he wanted that for his daughter.<eos> That she be a witch?<eos> That she have magic in her.<eos> Magic.<eos> How come you've been acting so nice to me, Bubble Bath?<eos> Well, I find, all things considered, it's easier being nice, than not nice.<eos> Did you see...?<eos> It's Ward's body.<eos> 150 yards out.<eos> 2:00.
I don't think so.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> I can't help you if you won't let me in.<eos> I know.<eos> I got to go.<eos> No. Kyle.<eos> I need twin extreme graphics cards installed in each of them, too.<eos> No, it's not for gaming, and, yes, I need all the power I can get.<eos> How soon could I pick up the computers?<eos> Uh, uh, fine. Great.
How are you gonna do that?<eos> Well, $5 million bounty's been out there a long time.<eos> So, I just put the word out that I might know who everybody's looking for.<eos> You're baiting a bounty hunter?<eos> What better way to find out who's behind the reward, huh?<eos> Hey, hold on a minute.<eos> You're Kane?<eos> Look, just get me the supplies, all right? And meet me at Catherine's office.<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> Cat's office?
Wait, Graydal's not just your everyday security firm.<eos> They're like Blackwater on steroids.<eos> They take down dictators.<eos> They're not gonna just let you walk in there and tell you who hired them to capture a beast.<eos> I know. I'll have to earn their trust first.<eos> How do you plan on doing that?<eos> I got a great reference right there.<eos> Reference?<eos> Wait, you-you mean to get a job?<eos> At Graydal?
She wants it back.<eos> All of it.<eos> All of what?<eos> Her life.<eos> Our heir apparent decides to grace us with her presence.<eos> Where's Father?<eos> Where is Father?<eos> What do you care?<eos> -He left.<eos> -Orus.
I've been traveling the world since I was 16.<eos> Mmm-hmm, as have I.<eos> Come to think of it, perhaps I was 15.<eos> One day, I will go to your lands and I will dance as a European.<eos> They will love you.<eos> Would I love Venice?<eos> It is magnificent.<eos> The City of Bridges.<eos> Instead of roads, we travel on canals.<eos> In wooden boats.
And to that coward's brave brothers... guilty of nothing but proximity?<eos> Death.<eos> I'm going to follow those barrels.<eos> Get back to your gravel patch.<eos> Slumber well... knowing you are going to be whipped tomorrow at my command.<eos> What can I say to make you turn around and walk away?<eos> Tell them I did this to you.<eos> They may just pardon you.<eos> - You told her.<eos> - What?
What are you up to?<eos> Wait and see.<eos> You won't be able to write me off again.<eos> Next.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Matilda Brockless.<eos> Currently employed at Furleys in Commercial Road.<eos> They're a ladies tailors.<eos> I take in work too.<eos> Machine and hand sewing.
You can start next week. Yes?<eos> Our sincere apologies.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> - I hope not.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Come on...<eos> The dress wouldn't have suited her.<eos> She said you called her old... and fat!<eos> You said you were going to train me.<eos> Not in common sense!
If we don't, someone else will.<eos> Mr Lyons, it's like a building site in here.<eos> Can't they work nights?<eos> Chief wants it done pronto.<eos> It's exciting, isn't it?<eos> These dresses are designed to be simple and elegant.<eos> And most importantly, they must fit.<eos> It's all in the cutting.<eos> Each of these sections must be copied exactly.<eos> And in three different sizes.
You look good on camera.<eos> Your posture emanates authority.<eos> This posture?<eos> No, that posture.<eos> Gets people to trust you.<eos> Well, was I convincing?<eos> Very.<eos> I think I'd rather vote for you right now.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> Inside. On a cross.
Well, if this is an occult killing, why choose Lewis as the victim?<eos> And does he have any history with ritualistic or occult crimes?<eos> Not that I've got. But maybe there's something in New York, where he's from.<eos> Yeah, run it.<eos> Actually, wait.<eos> There's something I have to ask both of you.<eos> Meisner wants to know if we are willing to work with him and Hadrian's Wall.<eos> Work with him how?<eos> My guess is to fight Black Claw.<eos> In uniform or out of uniform?
Both of the bodies were hung on crosses.<eos> Each cross had a different symbol carved into it, but they each signified the same thing, Water.<eos> Let's hit the books.<eos> Were you able to take anyone alive?<eos> I tried, but they just kept on coming.<eos> They wouldn't stop.<eos> I got one.<eos> Where?<eos> Will he be able to talk?<eos> Eventually.
- My God, what happened?<eos> - He's been shot.<eos> I had been working at the University of Texas Co-Op since 8:30 A.M.<eos> I noticed across the street a small group.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Looks like a fight.<eos> I got across the street and found the boy had been shot.<eos> All right, let's stop this bleeding here.<eos> And so I tried to stop the flow of blood.<eos> You okay?
Tom Eckman.<eos> I met Tom Eckman, Thomas Frederick Eckman, when I was beginning the sixth month of my pregnancy.<eos> And I was visibly, noticeably pregnant.<eos> He was trying to figure out whether I was pregnant or just chubby.<eos> I thought he was beautiful.<eos> - That's the time He was kind of amazing and wonderful.<eos> I don't know, we were just... in love.<eos> You know, just really, totally connected to each other.<eos> He just talked to me about everything.<eos> About his whole life.
Thomas Ashton, Thomas Karr,<eos> Karen Griffith, David Gunby, and my baby.<eos> They said I could have babies, but I never got pregnant.<eos> But I got to adopt my child.<eos> I adopted my child Sirak.<eos> He was born in Ethiopia and I adopted him when he was four.<eos> And he's now 27.<eos> I mean, Sirak was a wonderful child.<eos> And there are times, even though his skin is brown and mine's white, there are times when I absolutely cannot remember that he didn't come out of me.<eos> But the baby...
How did you get past security?<eos> - Oh, please. - Hey!<eos> Stay with me.<eos> The mask, the face.<eos> Why that one?<eos> Money sent a file.<eos> Wanted it custom. I don't know who that guy is.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Where'd you leave the Drainer?<eos> Parking garage.
What?<eos> Krispin's phone.<eos> It was on his body.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> That was his mother's phone.<eos> Did you...<eos> If there was a phone in that car, we would've found it.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> The blast.<eos> Where on Olympic?
Do you have a buyer?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.<eos> Martinez just sent a photo from her driver's license.<eos> Yep, that's her.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Marigold Wygant.<eos> No criminal record.<eos> Big social media presence.<eos> Deep into the anti-Powers movement.
Deep into the anti-Powers movement.<eos> Has she been online?<eos> Not since the signal was beamed into that Hack's head.<eos> She logs on again...<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Deep enough to kill Retro Girl?<eos> Million dollar question.<eos> You want me to pick this up?<eos> You okay?
I have made some bad choices.<eos> You never gave up on me, Dad.<eos> You don't give up on family.<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I'm saying is maybe cut him some slack.<eos> - Hey, I'm heading out.<eos> - Okay. See ya.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, I'm not sure if I should even be saying anything...<eos> - About what?
You never gave up on me, Dad.<eos> You don't give up on family.<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I'm saying is maybe cut him some slack.<eos> - Hey, I'm heading out.<eos> - Okay. See ya.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, I'm not sure if I should even be saying anything...<eos> - About what?<eos> - About your dad.
No.<eos> No way.<eos> Come on, dude.<eos> Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and do the right thing.<eos> Hey, Mariana, wait!<eos> Look... um...<eos> If you don't want me to be in your musical... that's okay.<eos> You can say it.<eos> I don't want you in my musical.<eos> Okay.
But seriously, what choice do I have?<eos> Braxton's got me on tape beasting out.<eos> He's gonna expose me if I don't go through with it.<eos> JT's gonna hack into Graydal, he'll get Braxton's tapes and take away any leverage he has.<eos> What, in two hours?<eos> Come on, if we've got any hope of figuring out who's behind this and stopping them, this is the only way.<eos> Why do you think I turned myself into Graydal in the first place?<eos> That was before Braxton caged you and before we knew about these tests.<eos> Yeah, well, at least he's not asking me to rip anybody's heart out.<eos> Yet.
You're a little sick, aren't you?<eos> No, I'm loyal.<eos> Are you?<eos> I'm no killer. Mmm.<eos> Tell that to the agent you killed.<eos> That was self-defense.<eos> Then why didn't you turn yourself in?<eos> You know, there's something that doesn't add up about you.<eos> I can't put my finger on it, but there are a lot of questions, and, the way I see it, there's only one way to answer them.<eos> All right.
Your FLO will be in touch to tell you all this, but I heard, so I thought you ought to know.<eos> He'll be closely guarded, there'll be an armed escort, he'll be handcuffed at all times.<eos> They'll have done a full risk assessment and an operational order will be in place.<eos> He'll be in, out, and straight back to the same nasty little cell in Gravesend that he'll be occupying for the next 500 years.<eos> Where?<eos> Where's his mother's funeral?<eos> Elland.<eos> Before...?<eos> No, it's after.<eos> Later in the afternoon.
- Cancer.<eos> They're accusing me of strangling and bottling Lynn Dewhurst.<eos> I'm sorry. I am sorry.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Tomorrow, I'll start again.<eos> No, tomorrow, you'll need another drink. - If you...<eos> - Will you shift?<eos> I saw on the sheet that I asked you to fill in...<eos> The happy sheet?<eos> Yes, the happy sheet.
I thought I knew you. I thought you were...<eos> There's this copper round 'ere, she has a look o' you.<eos> She's a right bitch - pardon my French.<eos> She thinks she's well 'ard.<eos> She did our Aaron for possession, right?<eos> Nearly broke his bloody arm.<eos> Not you, obviously.<eos> Yeah, well, happen if he'd gone quietly, she wouldn't have needed to show him who's in charge.<eos> It was Tommy Lee Royce's mother's funeral an hour after Helen's.<eos> Same crematorium.
Well, he can be fine for weeks.<eos> But... you never know when the phone's going to go, and it'll be Mrs. Beresford - "You're going to have to come in and fetch him." So...<eos> You have a lot on.<eos> Ah, no more than most people my age, I suspect.<eos> You did something very selfless when you took Ryan on.<eos> There must have been times when you've struggled with it.<eos> Well, I don't dwell on it.<eos> I've always focused on the fact that it isn't his fault.<eos> Tell me about Tommy Lee Royce.<eos> What about him?
Bravo November 45. Could you look at log 134 of today, at Crow Wood Park?<eos> 'We've had a phone call from a nun about a suspected suicide.'<eos> A nun?<eos> Paramedics are on their way.<eos> Can you get someone round there?<eos> - A real nun?<eos> - No, a pretend one!<eos> Responding.<eos> They might be dressed up going to a hen party.<eos> - Ten o'clock in t'morning? - Charlie Oscar 965.
I'm coming to pick you up, you're coming wi' me.<eos> "We don't talk about me dad?" Yeah.<eos> But, listen, don't get cross!<eos> He said that, but then nothing could be further from the truth.<eos> Once he started, it was like he could talk about nothing else.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said how much he liked you when he met you outside the shop and on the boat and how he still thinks about you.<eos> Did he say that? Did he actually say that? - That he still thinks about me?<eos> - Every day. Yes. He said it.<eos> - Yeah, but in a bad way.
That was really interesting, because he says that all he can think of now is how ill you were when that happened.<eos> I was. I was.<eos> I had septicaemia. I were off me head, I nearly died!<eos> He thinks it's his fault.<eos> He said if he hadn't brought his friend, you wouldn't have got upset that day and done that.<eos> It wasn't his friend, as such.<eos> He were a nice enough little lad.<eos> I were just frightened they were going to tell people where I was, cos I knew they'd crucify me.<eos> I would never have hurt him, Frances. Never.<eos> Not in a million years.

Never.<eos> Not in a million years.<eos> I were just off me head.<eos> - You see, I think he knows that.<eos> - Did he say it? No, no, but I could see in his eyes that he still really thinks about you.<eos> In a good way.
This is bordering on awkward.<eos> - Mrs. Dragovic?<eos> - There's no-one here.<eos> Is your husband Goran Dragovic?<eos> He's not here, he works shifts.<eos> Could we come in?<eos> It's not a good time for me, I'm busy, I'm going out.<eos> It's important, Mrs. Dragovic.<eos> There's been an accident.<eos> - What accident?
It's nothing. It's just Brunhilde's alibi. Finally.<eos> Joyce at t'front desk worked it out.<eos> - Brunhilde?<eos> - Miss Trunchbull.<eos> Sergeant Cawood.<eos> I'll put it on his desk.<eos> You still want to go for a drink?<eos> - Well, yeah. Yeah, if you...<eos> - I would!<eos> Tonight? Moorings? Seven?
- It IS mental. - I know it's mental.<eos> When the Ripper was around, everybody was thinking it was their husband and their son and their dad and their uncle.<eos> Yeah, but... It's someone.<eos> And the other thing.<eos> Ryan was asking about Becky.<eos> After you went out.<eos> About her relationship with... ..him.<eos> I didn't say owt. I just said she was infatuated and she didn't really know what he was like, but it struck me - it's when he gets home from school.<eos> That's when he's got a new thing, a new question, like someone's put ideas in his head.<eos> At school?
I'm looking at who's here... all doing their jobs.<eos> And I'm thinking about everybody there, everybody on the team, my team, in the office.<eos> Might not be a man!<eos> Which one of 'em would do that?<eos> Which one of 'em would be capable of it?<eos> Well, there are other explanations.<eos> Yes, but... Address the question.<eos> Well, your first instinct is nobody. Nobody's capable of that.<eos> But then the truth is... anybody's capable of anything.<eos> In the right circumstances.
You'd do it... if you wanted to get rid of somebody and disguise it.<eos> Somebody...who'd upset you, obviously.<eos> I mean... The way she was strangled, it was... - Not like it was an accident, was it?<eos> - Vicky Fleming had John Wadsworth's number on her mobile phone.<eos> He accounted for it.<eos> He did an investigation at the building society three years ago when he was on the economic crime unit, and it isn't even like the number was ever used.<eos> Well, there you go, that's a perfectly reasonable...<eos> 'But people use secret shagging phones, don't they?<eos> That they could destroy.<eos> In a fire.
- Do you have a mobile phone?<eos> - Ryan Cawood Ryan Cawood needs to talk about his father.<eos> He needs someone who will listen to him.<eos> You've been here under false pretences.<eos> - Think about Ryan.<eos> - I have to explain that to the parents and to the governors and to the children.<eos> - Think about Ryan.<eos> - They liked you.<eos> - Have you a mobile phone?<eos> - In my handbag.

You really think she's one of them?<eos> At this point, I think we have to assume the worst.<eos> Jackie, check it out.<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - You better stop fighting me, boy.<eos> I don't like being embarrassed in front of my guests, young man.<eos> I think he needs to learn how to cooperate!<eos> I think you're right, Warden.<eos> Gil.<eos> You okay?
They called what we have a "throuple".<eos> So just to clarify the three of you...<eos> Live together.<eos> Sleep together.<eos> Wow. Sorry.<eos> It's okay, it's a new concept for most people.<eos> We just have to ask, can you tell me where the two of you were between 11:00 and noon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We were at brunch together.<eos> A new restaurant in Hoboken.
What would Laura do?<eos> A little game I used to play back when I was her partner.<eos> Oh, I will crush this.<eos> Laura used to store her sweaters in the vegetable bin.<eos> She used to store candy in the crock pot...<eos> I already checked the hamper.<eos> Used to store passports in a waffle maker.<eos> I don't see one.<eos> And her summer shoes in the oven.<eos> Oven?
Oh, my God, another key.<eos> Three of them.<eos> Go get the other two keys from upstairs. - I'll bring those.<eos> Doesn't all fit together.<eos> No, we're still missing two keys.<eos> But maybe we have enough to figure out where it is.<eos> Wait a minute. Look at this.<eos> These three hills here with the two rivers on either side connecting to the bigger river here, that is an exact match for what the keys are saying.<eos> And it's in the Schwarzwald.<eos> - The Black Forest? - Yeah.
"But I'm going to bow from my heart."<eos> "I'm going to mend my broken fate..."<eos> "I came here because You called.<eos> "I am grateful." "Then eradicate these borders..."<eos> "...that exist between us."<eos> "O benevolent One."<eos> Pakistani President Mr. Ansari arrived at Ajmer Sharif Along with his son Hilal.<eos> In their efforts to better their relations with Pakistan India has decided to release Khalil Chisti.<eos> Hopes are now high for Sarbjit's release as well.<eos> "O benevolent One."
"My nature's to commit crimes..."<eos> "...and it's Your habit to forgive them."<eos> "O benevolent One."<eos> "There's a incense burning inside me..." "... I'm lost in your fragrance."<eos> "I Feel fresh like the spring..."<eos> "I can see through and through."<eos> "I've become Your mirror."<eos> "I've met myself at every nook and corner."<eos> "With Your grace I'll meet my beloved." "Feels like heaven's been laid under my feet."<eos> "O benevolent One."
- Of course you will meet him tomorrow. - Sir? Ross Poldark?<eos> When he comes before you in court.<eos> - You were not aware?<eos> No, sir, I was not.<eos> You will pardon me, ma'am, sir.<eos> Let me accompany you.<eos> What do you make of this assault on our newly elected MP?<eos> Barely escaped with his life!<eos> If this goes on, we'll have revolution on our hands!<eos> - In Cornwall?
At that time I was constantly in the house and can testify that Captain Poldark had no sleep for almost a week.<eos> His only child died and was buried but a few days before the wreck.<eos> On the day itself...<eos> .. I formed the opinion that he had suffered a mental breakdown.<eos> I consider that any strangeness in his actions should almost entirely be attributed to that.<eos> You are an apothecary?<eos> A physician, sir.<eos> A licentiate of the London College of Physicians<eos> - and a Cornishman by birth.<eos> - And an expert in mental afflictions?
This is hopeless.<eos> We don't even know if Hook's here.<eos> What if he has no unfinished business?<eos> He died a Dark One, Miss Swan.<eos> Trust me, he's here.<eos> Look, I'm finished being a team player.<eos> If you want things done, let me do them my way.<eos> I may have something down here that can help us.<eos> No luck yet, Mom?<eos> Not yet.
Stop. Stay there.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's... something down here.<eos> It's so... it's beautiful.<eos> It's where I belong.<eos> I know what my unfinished business was now.<eos> It was you.<eos> Me?
This isn't working.<eos> Let's take a 15 minute break.<eos> What a shame, León can't talk right now.<eos> Let's take a break!<eos> He's in the shower.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who should I say called?<eos> Hello?<eos> Don't forget to talk about the new album. That's the most important thing.<eos> And about the tour.
And they were inseparable all night.<eos> You take number six too... The passionate kisses during the recording of the video clip...<eos> "Light Your Heart" seem to leave no doubt.<eos> Has Melanie managed to light up León's heart?<eos> But isn't Violetta the true guilty party for the singer's loneliness in tempting L.A.?<eos> León just wants to talk about his album, but let's see what Melanie says about him.<eos> Hi, Melanie.<eos> How are you?<eos> For OnTV24, define León in three words.<eos> In three words.
This is wonderful!<eos> Thanks a lot for the invitation.<eos> Thanks for what, honey?<eos> We're all waiting for you.<eos> Gigino, take Eloísa and Tini's luggage to their room.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Violetta, I mean.<eos> Actually, my luggage is in the sea.<eos> -Yes, poor thing.<eos> -In the sea?
-Yes!<eos> -Please.<eos> Miranda's a fashion designer, so talented that she can find...<eos> Hello!<eos> ...a design that reveals the soul of each person.<eos> Some company at last!<eos> I felt like an only child... spoiled by Isabella.<eos> Now the three of you are spoiled.<eos> Where are Raúl and Saúl?<eos> Downstairs.
He never cheated on you.<eos> What?<eos> -Good morning.<eos> -Hi.<eos> -What's up with her?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Why isn't León with you?<eos> Where is he?<eos> We had car trouble and he continued on horseback.<eos> Horseback?
Anything I want?<eos> Anything you want.<eos> Like a million dollars in unmarked bills, maybe a plane to Aruba?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> And you'll say you'll bring it here, but the real plan is to distract me from what is, I'm sure, an impressive law enforcement response just outside that door.<eos> Is that the plan?<eos> That's the plan.<eos> Ok, let's talk, but let's talk about something interesting, at least.<eos> Tell me about me.<eos> You?
That was true.<eos> You're getting this.<eos> Now, here's how we'll know who wins at the end of 30 minutes.<eos> If you win, you'll drag me out of here in handcuffs.<eos> But if I win, you will escort me out like a gentleman, to make sure I exit safely.<eos> What do you say, Spencer?<eos> Think you can win this one?<eos> Considering everything you've put Garcia and so many people through, you're going to have to shoot me in the face before you walk out of here.<eos> Game on.<eos> Oh, boy.
Look at my face.<eos> Am I bluffing?<eos> I'll tell you where he is.<eos> But you need to sit back down and listen to the rest of my story.<eos> No.<eos> Tell me now.<eos> Or I'll-- detonate the bomb?<eos> You're not gonna do that, Cat, because then you won't learn anything. You said you were good at your job because you think through every outcome.<eos> Well, guess what-- so do I.<eos> All right.
I'm a little light in the friend department right now.<eos> I heard about your graduation... the whole freak mining fire thing.<eos> I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose half my class.<eos> Sorry you had to go through that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's weird town officials didn't get FEMA involved or at least increase emergency response.<eos> It's almost like everyone's resigned to letting the fires burn out on their own.<eos> That's the way it seems.<eos> Except if everyone sits around doing nothing, there's not gonna be a town left.<eos> Anyway, good night.
She didn't kill me.<eos> But...<eos> No, no "But."<eos> She's okay.<eos> She even said she might go herself, - but I wouldn't lay money on that.<eos> In other news, um...<eos> Stan almost took a swing at me a couple days ago.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, apparently, his... girlfriend saw us together after EST.<eos> A-At the restaurant? Mm-hmm.
I think what you are doing is a-a very important thing to do-- making time for your family.<eos> We get so busy sometimes, we forget what is most important.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You still think it'd be better to leave?<eos> I do.<eos> But, Philip, you don't even want that.<eos> I know you don't. Hmm.<eos> Maybe they could send us down South.<eos> You always dreamed of Odessa.<eos> - By the water. - Yeah.
Elementary-school teacher from Nashville, Tennessee, found this morning by two of her friends.<eos> Murdered and staged in the apartment she'd been leasing for the past three weeks.<eos> Due to the brutal and provocative nature of Samantha Wade's murder, our ambassador and the French foreign minister have requested the I.R.T.'s assistance in the homicide investigation.<eos> And given that about two million Americans visit Paris per year, not to mention an additional 50,000 on work visas, I'd bet they'd also like us to draw up a threat assessment to U.S. citizens.<eos> Well, there's nothing more threatening than this.<eos> What are these things in her eyes?<eos> French investigators have identified them as timber scribes.<eos> Bladed instruments used by land surveyors to inscribe trees.<eos> Not exactly your go-to murder weapon.<eos> Especially in an urban environment.
In my experience, sharing with our journalists often has a way of... Shaking the fruit out of the tree.<eos> And smacking you on the head, right?<eos> Let's just say that your faith in the press corps is a little stronger than ours.<eos> So, I've arranged for you to work out of this room.<eos> And copies of all our reports will be made available as soon as we...<eos> Actually, I'll need to visit the Bianca Lewis crime scene with Agent Simmons here.<eos> I'll also need Agent Jarvis to review the autopsy findings while Agent Seger looks over the evidence collected at the Samantha Wade scene.<eos> Anything else you require, Sir?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> For now.

So I need to take you... to see it.<eos> Paul, like I said, I can't leave.<eos> I'm still waiting for the movers.<eos> I...<eos> I've been working really hard, Amy.<eos> Please...<eos> Come... With me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let me just grab my coat.<eos> Okay.
How'd you learn all this anyway?<eos> Me and a friend got deep into ink spells in high school.<eos> It's not the Mona Lisa, but...<eos> I do have 20/20 vision in the dark.<eos> And where was all this exactly?<eos> I told you.<eos> I'm basically from the 'burbs.<eos> Actually, you never say a damn thing about your life.<eos> 'Cause it's boring.<eos> What flavor of boring?
You didn't touch your dessert, Sire.<eos> Water.<eos> Water!<eos> My valet, my valet!<eos> Water!<eos> My valet!<eos> Sire, what would you like?<eos> You aren't my valet, I want water!<eos> Not in that glass...<eos> In a crystal glass.
The picture remains blocked between the eyes, due to the temperature of the body, waters in the brain evaporate and the brain remains dry.<eos> So let's trepan, if the brain is dry...<eos> We make an incision, take out the liquids, put everything back in motion by mechanical means, sir.<eos> Tools.<eos> Right, because, sir... bears, stars, everything you mentioned. The smallpox, the roses...<eos> That's not enough anymore.<eos> You're an impostor.<eos> I'm starting to think the same.<eos> Have you reflected, Sire, about the works of the Duke of York?<eos> The fortresses in the West?
Okay, I'm just gonna put this up in the guest room.<eos> Hey, Alison.<eos> - This is all right, isn't it?<eos> - Yes. I'm glad you're here.<eos> Well, I wish you weren't staying in this house.<eos> Grandma, it's just a house.<eos> Sarah, that was Alison.<eos> They found Malcolm, the kid that went missing.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the woods.
I promise you'll get your foot back in a sec.<eos> I'd like to speak to your folks anyway.<eos> They're not around, but, uh, do you have, like, a card or something?<eos> I've actually been in a lot of pain since the bike accident.<eos> It looks like pancreatitis, so I'll need to reexamine you at some point.<eos> And I'd like to talk to your aunt so that she knows what's going...<eos> Yeah, that's fine.<eos> All right, check with the ER in Riverhead then.<eos> Just get back to me, ASAP though, okay?<eos> All right, bye.
You've come a long way since you were isolating yourself in here.<eos> Why is it just the two of us today?<eos> - What do we got?<eos> - Male, 30s. Syncope.<eos> Full-thickness forehead laceration.<eos> - Let's go, let's go, let's go.<eos> - Clear the way.<eos> Welcome to the ER, Dr. Lawson.<eos> But we usually just let the EMTs bring them in.<eos> Oh, okay.
I can do the blood draw on Hans.<eos> Hank, you can't do everything.<eos> All right?<eos> We can handle this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, let's go, Margaret.<eos> - Paper booties.<eos> - Paper booties.<eos> Hey... whoa!<eos> You okay?
Very sure.<eos> Raj said he wanted clips of Divya's friends entertaining the baby, as they have with Sashi, because the new baby will be growing up in Baltimore.<eos> Yeah, or Stony Brook.<eos> I just...<eos> I hate thinking about her leaving.<eos> I understand, but I'm on a deadline.<eos> Raj wanted this ready for the surprise shower tomorrow.<eos> And why did Raj ask you to do this?<eos> I was president of the audio/visual club<eos> - in high school.
I want to make sure you didn't break anything, okay?<eos> Where do you hurt?<eos> No, I-I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you move your arms and legs?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Nexus negative.<eos> All right.
Are you wearing my bathrobe and hoodie and sweats?<eos> No, please.<eos> Just keep 'em.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - Yeah. I'll go check on him.<eos> - What can I do to help you?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I'm good. I just finished here.<eos> All right.
We'll need amiodarone too.<eos> All right. Paramedics are on the way.<eos> Clear!<eos> Come on, Keller.<eos> Boy, that's a flatline.<eos> Keller's flatlining right now?<eos> Come on, Ken.<eos> He's going to make it, right?<eos> Ken Keller is not going to die.<eos> Not on my floor, and not in my sweats.
But I have a fear of needles.<eos> Trypanophobia.<eos> I had it too.<eos> Really?<eos> Was it me, or did the trigger shot seem huge?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I don't even like talking about it. - Come on.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> Maybe like 24-25.<eos> All right.
You will come to know me as the smart one, the fun one, the cool one.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> I am your favorite.<eos> I am Uncle Evan, okay?<eos> AKA your mother's favorite person in the universe.<eos> She loves me so much...<eos> - What?<eos> - Hold on a second.<eos> "In the universe."
Oh, my God. No, no, your mom's new car!<eos> And we're supposed to leave in a couple hours, too.<eos> This is gonna be so bad.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Well, thanks a lot.<eos> Well, let me know if you need anything, hon.<eos> I just need to face this right now.<eos> Hola.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Um, just out for a ride.
No, you-you can't protect me.<eos> You have no idea what it's capable of.<eos> Okay, listen, you can't protect yourself.<eos> Those stupid toys you have, they couldn't even take me down, let alone whatever's coming next.<eos> Look, face it, okay?<eos> I'm probably the only chance you got right now.<eos> I thought we were meeting after my shift.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But, um, I made my decision, and I didn't want to wait any longer.<eos> Okay.
You're a terrorist-- terrorist who's out to get even with the very country that messed you up, isn't that right?<eos> No, that is not right.<eos> Cut the crap, soldier.<eos> I've seen it a hundred times before.<eos> I know all about you.<eos> Scarred by war, forgotten at home, lost, angry-- before you know it, everybody's the enemy.<eos> That's Hill's twist.<eos> That's how he justified trying to kill me in the first place.<eos> Only you killed Hill instead.<eos> In self-defense.
Welcome home.<eos> Previously on Shadowhunters...
I could be executed.<eos> Well, we'll be extra careful then.<eos> There is no "we" in this scenario.<eos> Only Clary goes in to find the Portal. My debt is to her.<eos> You've given us no reason to trust you, Seelie.<eos> He brought us here.<eos> I knew the Seelies were one with nature, but...<eos> This will establish a connection to the other dimension.<eos> What's it like?<eos> The other dimension.
It's been dormant for a long time.<eos> Like me.<eos> Let's see if we can wake it up.<eos> Can you see it?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's in a subbasement of...<eos> Fort Knox.<eos> Like, literally Fort...<eos> No, but it might as well be.<eos> The Institute.
Magnus?<eos> You said you needed to talk to me.<eos> Nice to see you, Alec.<eos> I wasn't sure if you'd come.<eos> You know how I hate to drink alone.<eos> I didn't come here to drink.<eos> Do you have any information...<eos> On the warlock who cast a spell on Jocelyn?<eos> I'm looking into it. But... we never really finished our conversation after Izzy's trial.<eos> About your wedding?
Call off the rest of the pack.<eos> We're gonna need a pickup.<eos> We're at the subway station near Bergen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll see you in five.<eos> - How's Hodge doing?<eos> - He'll live.<eos> It's Jace I'm worried about.<eos> Valentine really messed with his head.<eos> - What, at Renwick's?
- Yeah.<eos> He went through a lot recently.<eos> I thought we had settled it, but something's killing him inside.<eos> - I don't know what it is.<eos> - This is all too familiar.<eos> I saw a similar thing with Valentine 18 years ago.<eos> Jace isn't Valentine.<eos> Not yet.<eos> We gotta keep an eye on him.<eos> All right.
What about Dorothea Rollins?<eos> She was my mom's assistant.<eos> Dot?<eos> Oh, but of course.<eos> She was our favorite customer.<eos> So your entire life has been paid for by my antiquities.<eos> I guess that means you owe me.<eos> Do you know where it is or not?<eos> It's in my apartment on the Upper East Side.<eos> My own pied-a-terre.
I still don't get it.<eos> Why do you have this place if you live at Hotel DuMort?<eos> The DuMort has too many rules.<eos> Think of it like Gracie Mansion.<eos> It's the official residence, but it doesn't mean I have to live there.<eos> This place gives me the freedom to indulge in certain... proclivities.<eos> You know, the mayor has the same problem.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come with me.<eos> On the dotted line.
It's locked in Pharma.<eos> Go... now.<eos> It's okay, Lou.<eos> I got you.<eos> Ooh.<eos> That was a big one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh.<eos> He's gonna need a new gown and fresh sheets.<eos> Oh, I hate it when they do that.<eos> - Could you get an orderly?<eos> Do you mind?<eos> - Okay.
He was postictal.<eos> Hyper-aggression can occur after a seizure.<eos> Temporary fugue state.<eos> - He won't even remember it.<eos> - Where is he now?<eos> Restrained, and being treated right next door. - Her vein's collapsed.<eos> I can't get in.<eos> - Put in a central line.<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Oh, okay.
- Damn it. - Send for a trauma panel and a cross.<eos> Somebody get Jackson in here right now!<eos> - Grey.<eos> - On it.<eos> Grey, we're gonna shoot a quick X-ray, all right?<eos> Hi.<eos> Easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Easy.<eos> All right, okay.
Grey, we're gonna shoot a quick X-ray, all right?<eos> Hi.<eos> Easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Easy.<eos> All right, okay.<eos> All right, everybody back.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, ready? On three.<eos> 1, 2, 3. All right, easy.
Decent mobility.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, we're done, and it's all good, so...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, he has been working a lot of night shifts, and she's been...<eos> They haven't been talking, I don't think, or hanging or anything, from what I can tell.<eos> So, anyway...<eos> Let's do this again.<eos> Follow the pen. Okay, this isn't exactly the right shade, but it's doing a pretty good job of covering the bruising.<eos> All right.
Let's do this again.<eos> Follow the pen. Okay, this isn't exactly the right shade, but it's doing a pretty good job of covering the bruising.<eos> All right.<eos> So...<eos> Don't try and get up, okay?<eos> Just let them come to you.<eos> And smile.<eos> But try not to open your mouth because it's still pretty swollen in there and the wires... the metal wires... they're a little scary.<eos> You ready?<eos> Okay, all right.
- No, no.<eos> Let's do this later.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Let's do this later.<eos> Let's do this later.<eos> We're gonna do it later, okay?<eos> We're gonna do it later.<eos> Okay.
It's not okay.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Let's do this later.<eos> Let's do this later.<eos> We're gonna do it later, okay?<eos> We're gonna do it later.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, does anybody want anything yummy from the cafeteria?<eos> All right.
I have all of five minutes to update you on the miracle... That I've been working on your service this week, but it seems like a bad time.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna check in and update you later.<eos> Maybe we all could check in later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> Leave that. Whoa.<eos> What happened?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Nurses station.<eos> Yeah, okay.
I get it.<eos> Do you think that I want to be out there hanging out outside your door like some pathetic little rat looking for scraps?<eos> Do you think that feels good for me?<eos> I...<eos> I have been out there trying to figure out how to make amends...<eos> As if that would matter to you.<eos> I know I'm a mess...<eos> Who talks too much and feels too much, and I know that it drives you crazy, but that is the one way I know how to stay sober, and every time I try to suck it up and shut up<eos> and just be cold and normal, I end up drunk...<eos> Or on pills or at a funeral.
How much time do we have?<eos> The FBI in West Virginia would've taken the care package into their custody this morning when they arrested Keen.<eos> But there's no FBI field office in West Virginia to store evidence, so they would've sent a team from their Pittsburgh field office to collect it.<eos> They should be on the road back to Pittsburgh by now.<eos> We need to intercept them before they reach their field office.<eos> The trick is to purloin the package without them knowing we've taken it.<eos> For that, we need more stolen evidence.<eos> You keep a storage locker in West Virginia?<eos> I keep a storage locker filled with useful items in most states.<eos> - Two or three in the Red States.
Absolutely not.<eos> Well, not really.<eos> I've made a rather healthy investment in a consortium that supplies medical marijuana to facilities in Colorado, Oregon, Washington, District of Columbia.<eos> But simply as an effort to diversify into more legitimate businesses.<eos> As for consumption, I must admit to a fondness for any well-appointed opium den, and a bit of hashish goes well with just about anything.<eos> But stimulants, I have no taste for.<eos> I prefer that slight curve at the small of the back, the swell of a breast, the soft nape of the neck to quicken my heartbeat.<eos> Nonetheless, after a rather contentious and messy negotiation in Cartagena, this was all that was left on the table, so I took it.<eos> Cocaine still remains a valid currency to some of my clients.<eos> Especially in England.
Your weapons on the ground.<eos> Or I'll kill him.<eos> He'll kill me anyway, so just drop him.<eos> Just drop the son of a bitch.<eos> Come on, man, you're FBI.<eos> You never put your weapon down.<eos> Just... second he shoots me, drop him.<eos> Drop him!<eos> All right, you win.<eos> Okay?
It's okay. It's me.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> A detective, actually.<eos> Although you're really supposed to be a Homeland Security agent.<eos> Listen, I'm-I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?<eos> I just... I really need your help right now.<eos> For what?<eos> I don't know, you know?<eos> You're-you're the only one who can save me.<eos> Okay...
Help you do what?<eos> Help me make sense of all this, okay?<eos> Help me get home so I can make things right for her.<eos> Like it or not, your daughter-- she needs me.<eos> And I certainly need her. I'll tell you what.<eos> You can do whatever you want to me, but I'm not gonna help you hurt my daughter.<eos> Oh, my God, you're one of them, aren't you?<eos> I thought Muirfield eliminated all of you.<eos> Not all of them.<eos> You-you all right, big guy?
That's really creepy.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I hit him in the jaw... twice.<eos> But... the more that I thought about it afterward, the more I... started to wonder if maybe he knows something.<eos> About, um... that night.<eos> Oh, Cat, come on. That's...<eos> Okay, never mind.<eos> Forget I said anything.<eos> Seriously, what... what are the chances that that guy knows what happened that night?<eos> Especially after all these years.
You don't look well.<eos> Should we ride for home?<eos> Continue as planned.<eos> And, Orus... indulge yourself.<eos> False flags, masks!<eos> These are the tools of cowards.<eos> Let's end this foolishness, save our arrows for truer enemies.<eos> If you're coming, put it on.<eos> I awoke some time later.<eos> Hours, days.
One of my students, an unbroken colt named Altai, was a master of such flimsy excuses.<eos> And what became of him?<eos> He died.<eos> It occurs to me that, far too often, a man walks through life without saying that which he really means.<eos> Certainly not you, Sifu.<eos> I remember, as near as yesterday, a time when all reason for living had left me.<eos> And from the pits of this despair, the depths of this disheartenment... I was reclaimed.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> You will be a great emperor.<eos> Sifu?
I can't say.<eos> - Well, then you can't go.<eos> - I swore an oath to you.<eos> And now you must trust in my silence that I can and will protect you.<eos> My brother Möngke was dead.<eos> Kurultai was called in Karakorum.<eos> And I did not attend because... I had no hope at winning.<eos> Ariq was elected Khan.<eos> So I held my own Kurultai.<eos> In China.
The buttony thing... is a clock, obviously.<eos> Uh-huh, and the hands are on 12, so Robyn's crew is meeting at noon.<eos> Not noon... midnight.<eos> So that gives us less than an hour to figure this out and get uptown.<eos> Okay, so we have a sheep, an ear, a "d," a bull, a bag, a beach ball, and a fish on a pole.<eos> Emojis are symbolic for other things.<eos> Clearly, but symbolic for what other things?<eos> Well, where would you go fishing?<eos> Water.<eos> By the river.
We'll put a pin in that.<eos> Next are the bag and the ball.<eos> Oh. And not just any bag.<eos> That is a shopping bag.<eos> An item with which you are intimately familiar.<eos> So, shopping ball?<eos> No... mall.<eos> Shopping mall.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Midnight by the river at the Shepherd Taurus shopping mall?
So, how well do you know Agnes Molina?<eos> Why?<eos> Is she a suspect?<eos> Uh, yeah. She is.<eos> Captain, Agnes certainly did some bad things in her life, but she's a sweet kid, not a killer.<eos> Do you have any idea where she is now?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, her parents shut her out after her last arrest.<eos> And what about friends?<eos> In jail, yes.
I don't know.<eos> All she said, it was somebody from the a cappella competition.<eos> She was gonna tell me more when I got to the theater, but I was a couple hours late, and she wasn't there, so I left.<eos> But I guess she was there, huh?<eos> Dead.<eos> We got witnesses that put Agnes in a diner across town during the time Robyn was killed.<eos> Which means our killer is probably someone inside the competition.<eos> Guys, who tipped Castle off?<eos> Not us. Not after, uh...<eos> After what?
We got witnesses that put Agnes in a diner across town during the time Robyn was killed.<eos> Which means our killer is probably someone inside the competition.<eos> Guys, who tipped Castle off?<eos> Not us. Not after, uh...<eos> After what?<eos> Castle told us about...<eos> Svetlana.<eos> He did?<eos> He... he... told you about...<eos> Svetlana... yeah.
What do you want to do?<eos> I got this.<eos> ♪ He-e-e-e-y<eos> ♪ you wanna siiiiing?<eos> ♪ Let's sing about Robyn King ♪<eos> ♪ But you best be straight, 'cause, baby, you'll hate ♪ ♪ To feel the steel of my handcuffs ♪<eos> - ♪ Don't you kno-o-o-o-w ♪ - Whoa-ho-ho, ohhhhhhhh ♪ I'll take you to the jail tonight ♪<eos> This was Robyn's dressing room.<eos> When was the last time you saw her?<eos> Yesterday, right after rehearsal.
Speaking of that scarf, where did it come from?<eos> Um... Robyn was wearing it.<eos> She was?<eos> Oh. That's funny.<eos> Because we reached out to the hospital where Robyn was taken, and on her intake form, there's a bit of a-a fashion discrepancy.<eos> Y-you see, Robyn's entire outfit was worth about $50.<eos> But the scarf that you used, it was an Hermes scarf, and that was worth about 2 grand.<eos> So what I'm wondering is...<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> Okay.
We absolutely forbid you.<eos> Honestly, how did you guys ever solve murders without me?<eos> All the time.<eos> Hey, where's Castle going?<eos> S...<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> 'Cause, Beckett, y-you don't need him.<eos> And... and look, just so you know, you get us in the breakup, okay?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Damn straight.

Doesn't really sound like me.<eos> Sure.<eos> Anyway, this one has no postage, and it's got, like, creepy photos and what appears to be a mask of your face.<eos> Whoa. Is that what I look like?<eos> Ana, you know what this means?<eos> That I have a stalker?<eos> Whoa. I have a stalker!<eos> - I know!<eos> Congrats.<eos> - Oh, finally.
I baked.<eos> That's actually good.<eos> It's, like, people food.<eos> What can I say?<eos> You have no idea how relieved I am to see you like this.<eos> Like what?<eos> A happy housewife?<eos> Better.<eos> Not, uh...<eos> High all the time?
- What am I gonna steal?<eos> Hmm, well...<eos> Could start by stealing me a sandwich.<eos> The day drinking losers absolutely do not fulfill the terms of our agreement.<eos> Our agreement?<eos> I want somewhere better, some place with real magic.<eos> Please.<eos> It's the number two safe house in the city.<eos> What?<eos> In all of New York?
Uh, anyways, listen, uh, 'cause this is important, so...<eos> Okay, let me stop you one quick second.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> - This isn't funny.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I think you have me confused for someone else.<eos> Um, sorry.<eos> Little problem out here.<eos> Pete!<eos> Now, fucker!
You.<eos> Sultry-But-Damaged.<eos> What is the Hammer Charm of Legrand?<eos> It's, um-- it's the--<eos> One day your looks will be gone like that and unless there's a brain behind those batting eyelashes you will be selling oranges at an off-ramp.<eos> It's a spell that makes nails go into boards perfectly straight.<eos> You think you know how to do this, I assure you, you do not.<eos> Your voices are your enemies.<eos> A great Magician-- and as you gaze into your mirrors in the coming years, you may recall that I was the last great Magician you ever saw, a great Magician is magic in his bones, blood, heart, and dick.<eos> Or lady parts.
Here's the thing.<eos> Encanto Oculto is a solid week of sun, drugs, and magical art.<eos> Time stops, reality bends, and you fuck five times a day.<eos> On a bad day.<eos> It sounds awesome.<eos> It is, Todd.<eos> It is awesome, but honestly, you'd end up in a corner alone.<eos> Bitter.<eos> Bumming everyone out.<eos> Like last year at the bacchanal.
What if this--Marina?<eos> Okay, what if she got this-- what if she got some serious shit?<eos> I mean, like, really dope, one-of-a-kind magic.<eos> Maybe it'd buy you out.<eos> For good.<eos> It'd have to be pretty amazing.<eos> It is.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> Where?<eos> Mayakovsky's office.
Right, the twin gods of Fillory.<eos> They get mean and take everything away, I know.<eos> Essentially, yeah.<eos> They have their reasons.<eos> But that's what happened to the manuscript.<eos> For some reason, I didn't deserve it.<eos> It's a manuscript, not a referendum on your character.<eos> No.<eos> I--<eos> - In the books--
- Penny.<eos> - Do you live here?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Born and raised.<eos> I'm actually kind of the welcome committee.<eos> I keep track of the fountains.<eos> I felt you come through.<eos> Please tell me that I can help you get where you need to go.<eos> Okay, where are we exactly?<eos> - The Neitherlands.
Your lifelong crush.<eos> Dreams are weird.<eos> People are... naked, and animals are smoking cigarettes.<eos> I--look.<eos> Here's what's important.<eos> You've been gone for six weeks.<eos> No, I've been gone six hours.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Where are you, anyway?<eos> - The Neitherlands.
Look, I just--<eos> Mom--Stephanie,<eos> I don't see the point in talking about it.<eos> We don't agree on it, and we're never going to.<eos> Well, because you act like there's something wrong with me.<eos> No, I just think it's weird that you-- you're not at all curious about what happened to Charlie.<eos> It's not gonna bring him back, so I don't want to know...<eos> Which is a perfectly reasonable position in spite of how you judge me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay, fine.
- Yeah.<eos> Joe's anatomy is adaptable.<eos> He's like a Swiss Army knife.<eos> He's good for every occasion.<eos> So whatever do you want with Joe?<eos> - I need his help.<eos> - Oh, sweetie.<eos> I'm sure Quentin will understand.<eos> You see two of you too, right?<eos> Okay, good.
When was this decision reached?<eos> Mr Jaggers, we simply have two additional attendees at our meeting.<eos> A meeting of the utmost importance.
Footman?<eos> He is never to present himself here again.<eos> You never want to set eyes on his face, nor hear his... blandishments, now or ever in the future.<eos> Mary, wait.<eos> I'll tell him myself.<eos> You smile, sir.<eos> Why? I always smile when I see you.<eos> Is something amiss?<eos> I know about her.<eos> - Her?
You did not bring Marley's ledger to me as requested.<eos> Sir, I didn't know you meant immediately.<eos> Well, you should have said. I would have dropped everything and rushed.<eos> Nor did you tell me that Marley had decided to leave your partnership.<eos> I didn't see it was relevant.<eos> I decide what is relevant.<eos> Why did he want to leave?<eos> He didn't see fit to enlighten me as to the why.<eos> It would be costly - division of assets, lawyers.<eos> Indeed.
I do apologise for this intrusion on the Sabbath, sir.<eos> Inspector Bucket of the Detective.<eos> I saw you in church - or rather, heard you.<eos> You're a fine baritone, Inspector.<eos> Oh, bless you, sir.<eos> And you're an excellent tenor -<eos> I dare say I'm not the first to pass comment on it.<eos> Well, now that you mention it, no.<eos> Good for the soul, singing. - Don't you find?<eos> - Indeed.
You've hardly said a word since you arrived.<eos> Arthur, please. I thought we were friends again.<eos> I believe you've come to know Mr Compeyson quite well.<eos> Well enough, from the few times our paths have crossed.<eos> Why?<eos> Can I trust his interest in the brewery is genuine?<eos> He's told me... he sees it as a great opportunity.<eos> So I'd be foolish to spurn him.<eos> Arthur. I can trust him?<eos> Completely.
He's told me... he sees it as a great opportunity.<eos> So I'd be foolish to spurn him.<eos> Arthur. I can trust him?<eos> Completely.<eos> These are based on initial ideas Amelia and I have discussed.<eos> If you'd cast a look...<eos> Impressive.<eos> Glad you think so.<eos> I meant your act.<eos> Act?
- I... it's... gone...<eos> Off somewhere, Mr Wegg?<eos> How is it that you're in possession of cognac stolen from the vessel, the St Marie, which docked here on Christmas Eve?<eos> Ahh, the pain -- terrimenjous, it is.<eos> Ow, the agony of it!<eos> Perhaps you'd be more comfortable in the station?<eos> I bought it off a froggy sailor.<eos> I never knew it was snide!<eos> - Where?<eos> - The docks.
Good?<eos> Well, that ain't the word most would choose.<eos> Plenty other girls out there...<eos> Yeah, but I don't care about other girls.<eos> They ain't you.<eos> They ain't my Nancy.<eos> Your Nancy?<eos> Well?<eos> So, you are military man?<eos> Indeed, sir.
I just saw Frances. It seems her humour's not improved.<eos> Which makes it all the better to see a friendly face.<eos> How are you?<eos> I think I can honestly say, I have rarely felt better.<eos> Oh, so you've decided to treat yourself to a new dress?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, magenta is all the rage in Paris...<eos> I was thinking... something a little lighter.<eos> Lighter?<eos> More white.

- Please, Bill. He's just a boy.<eos> He's happy enough to play a man when it suits him.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> If anything happens to him, I'll never forgive myself.<eos> What've you done, gal?<eos> They say you've arrested a man, Inspector?<eos> A man?<eos> I heard tell it were a child.<eos> Face of an angel, they say.<eos> The heart of a devil.
So I got some, and an encyclopaedia.<eos> M for Midwifery.<eos> The doctor will need a sensible woman to assist him.<eos> I am she.<eos> Do you promise you sent for James?<eos> I promise.<eos> I want a doctor to come, even if I do not want Captain Hawdon.<eos> Do you think he'll come?<eos> After the... the disagreement?<eos> The "disagreement".
You're so giving, so warm, so smart that sometimes I want to punch you.<eos> But the longer that you isolate yourself, the harder it's gonna be to come back to the real world.<eos> So let's just rip off the band-aid and go for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But just you and I...<eos> No guys.<eos> I am not quite ready for that excitement yet.<eos> Yeah, okay, cool.
- He asked for you particularly.<eos> - I don't doubt it.<eos> May I tell him that he need not hope in vain?<eos> - Captain McNeil.<eos> - An ambush, sir!<eos> Caught off guard and in possession of the field!<eos> How are you, sir?<eos> On manoeuvres hereabouts?<eos> Quartered with Sir Hugh at Werry House, whither I'm attempting to lure your wife.<eos> To what end?
- Are you well?<eos> - Quite well, thank 'ee.<eos> I came in search of Garrick.<eos> He scented a rabbit and...<eos> Garrick!<eos> Garrick, come to!<eos> Is Ross recovered from the trial?<eos> He rarely speaks of it.<eos> And your news?<eos> The child?
My finances require urgent attention.<eos> - Demelza.<eos> - Ross.<eos> - You first.<eos> - No, you.<eos> I want to apologise.<eos> I've been distracted of late.<eos> But there are things I've been wishing to say to you...<eos> And I you...<eos> About our finances.
"I would nonetheless esteem it a favour. "If you would call to assure yourself of my full recovery "and to receive payment for your skill.<eos> "Unless of course you have more important matters to attend..."<eos> Lift your head up.<eos> Show me your teeth.<eos> I can't account for these symptoms. Swelling, bruising, bleeding gums, listlessness...<eos> Is it the dust? The foul air of the mine?<eos> I wondered that, but some of these people are fisher folk.<eos> It's perplexing.<eos> Is that wise?<eos> With the currents so strong hereabouts.
You see? He will never be reconciled.<eos> Dr Enys. How kind of you to call.<eos> I haven't been waiting above three months!<eos> I apologise, Miss Penvenen.<eos> I've been busy with my other patients.<eos> Doubtless they're more important than I.<eos> Only insofar as their conditions are more serious.<eos> Well? Are you going to examine my throat or not?<eos> Open your mouth, please.<eos> Wider, please.
That the customs officials at St Ann's are determined to let nothing slip ashore.<eos> That all your attempts to persuade them with a share of the profits have fallen on deaf ears.<eos> And now this crackdown from on high means that every time we find a new landing place, we're met by gaugers and military.<eos> All cargo confiscated crew barely 'scaped with their lives.<eos> So here's the thing, we've run out of navigable inlets.<eos> And I possess the only one for miles.<eos> Actually, I expect to be seeing a good deal of Ross in future.<eos> I've increased my shareholding in his mine.<eos> So I hope I won't have cause to inflict undue pressure on him.<eos> Or on Francis, for that matter.
Demelza, try to see this in a rational light.<eos> I'm home.<eos> The tide is high. There's no footprints on the beach.<eos> There'll be salt for the pilchards.<eos> And we are 200 pounds less in debt than we were this morning.<eos> Is that not cause to celebrate?<eos> - That you go against my wishes?<eos> - For the good of us both.<eos> That you take risks you need not take?<eos> On this occasion.
Could be someone with binoculars.<eos> I'd like to give the same dignity to our veterans that we gave to this ship.<eos> Someone's taking a shot at me.<eos> Call it 3,300 yards.<eos> That'd be the longest kill of all time.<eos> I hire as many vets as I can...<eos> NZT.<eos> Piper.<eos> She'll breathe out before she shoots, so let's think this through.<eos> Not on the table, obviously.
All things pass, Brian.<eos> The volume of your feelings right now?<eos> They'll go down.<eos> This is hard.<eos> But it's like a baptism.<eos> You're an initiate now.<eos> You're a part of the real world.<eos> The strong eat the weak.<eos> Same as it ever was.<eos> All right, okay.
- And she's more than willing to sing along when her favorite song comes on.<eos> - ♪ It's a bitch, girl... ♪ - Whoa, this is a sweet sound system.<eos> You know what would sound awesome on this<eos> - is Artificial Brain.<eos> - Please don't touch that with your dusty orange fingers.<eos> - It's voice-activated.<eos> - Really?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Car, find Artificial Brain.<eos> After this song.
That's awesome.<eos> Car, find Artificial Brain.<eos> After this song.<eos> We didn't hit our first hiccup until Virginia.<eos> - But it was kind of a doozy.<eos> - Hey, that was a good song.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been thinking about Senator Morra.<eos> The shooting.
It's all right... you can say it.<eos> It does kind of feel like a stretch, though.<eos> You know?<eos> And the thing is, I'm the only one that's immune to the side effects of NZT, right?<eos> You're the only one that we know about.<eos> Maybe Edward Morra's just, uh, your garden-variety late bloomer.<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> Just curious?<eos> In my experience, when Rebecca Harris is "just curious," stuff gets figured out.<eos> Like Chinatown level stuff.
Erase any evidence that I was here.<eos> Oops, these systems can get so buggy.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I know you're with your dad, but Gilroy was a bust.<eos> He has alibis for all the huggings.<eos> Boyle and I will confirm, but it doesn't look good.<eos> He was so sure.<eos> Yeah, we should still run down the alibis, though.<eos> Look, do you mind if we swing through Brooklyn on the way back?<eos> "On the way back"?
But in this age of "Netflix and chill"<eos> it is no time to be looking for someone decent.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sands!<eos> Uh, Rach, this is a colleague of mine.<eos> My, uh, racquetball partner.<eos> - Whoa! Aah! - I know!<eos> I know! Your racquetball partner is bleeding!<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> All right.
All right?<eos> Rach, it's either that... or apply pressure to the wound.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> "Wilder, DeMille, Lean, Huston..."<eos> Hi.<eos> Good.<eos> Just put your finger right there.<eos> Huh?<eos> Put your finger right there.<eos> All right. Wow.
"Wilder, DeMille, Lean, Huston..."<eos> Hi.<eos> Good.<eos> Just put your finger right there.<eos> Huh?<eos> Put your finger right there.<eos> All right. Wow.<eos> That is... - graphic. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Let go.<eos> - Okay. Okay.
poke a hole in one of them... But... we got to act quickly or else he'll suffocate.<eos> I'm not watching this.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you want water?<eos> Okay.<eos> Brian.<eos> What?<eos> Long night's work ahead of me.<eos> Okay, great.
You had a kid with Anastasia.<eos> That's why you're doing this.<eos> Tanner won't let my son go until every name on that list is gone.<eos> And he wants it all done tonight, so no one has time to react and run.<eos> Every name?<eos> The last name on that list is Peckinpah.<eos> That's you, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The night ends on me.<eos> All right. All right.
Shh, shh, shh.<eos> I don't have a lot of time.<eos> Here's the deal, Mr. Matthews.<eos> You are the CEO of CaroBank, and I happen to have a unique problem that involves one of your branches.<eos> Just take whatever you want.<eos> I'm not gonna rob you, man.<eos> I just need access to the Midtown branch before banking hours so I can open a safe deposit box using this perfectly legitimate key.<eos> Like I said, I'm not gonna take anything,<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone, but if I don't get what I want, well, I did peruse your personal computer over there, and you, Mr. Matthews, have a penchant for high-priced escorts.<eos> A lot of 'em.
I got a D-minus in environmental science, by the way.<eos> It was a real squeaker, but, you know, passing is passing.<eos> Brian, Brian, your parents must have been very proud.<eos> They really were.<eos> All right, watch this.<eos> Drafts get stuck inside the city walls, and then slingshot up and over the high-rises.<eos> And you can see, it goes right from the Financial District up to Midtown.<eos> So you're saying the blackout is weather related?<eos> Oh, I'm saying that based on the pattern, whatever's causing the blackouts might be getting blown around by the wind, but, you know, I'd have to confirm by visiting local power plants, and, uh... And we should still rule out the possibility of cyber warfare, of course.<eos> All right.
Can I borrow your phone?<eos> Or we could play charades.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's your, uh, what's your station?<eos> Anything's good.<eos> I don't really listen to the radio.<eos> Looks like we're getting out of here just in time, huh?<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - Come on, come on.<eos> Hey, thanks for this, by the way.
I mean, I'm a little bummed that the CDC burned my Joy Division shirt.<eos> It was an original.<eos> You seen Rebecca?<eos> She's upstairs with Naz.<eos> Mm. Something happen between you two, in quarantine?<eos> I don't know, mistakes were made, words were said.<eos> I guess it's our first real fight.<eos> Oh. The handler-consultant relationship is stressful enough without being thrown into a plastic bubble together.<eos> You guys will get through it.<eos> - Okay?
Brute force approach is a no-go.<eos> Surely there are other outcomes.<eos> Of course there are.<eos> And don't call me Shirley.<eos> On the other hand, you are in a country where, rumor has it, corruption and graft hold actual sway.<eos> I don't even know how much I have left in rubles.<eos> I mean, Vladi wasn't cheap.<eos> There are other forms of currency.<eos> Influence, for example.<eos> Okay, all right.
I love the show.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> - Help?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I bought this phone.<eos> I got in touch with George R.R. Martin's publisher, who said,<eos> "All requests to talk to Mr. Martin have to go through his publicist."<eos> She told me, "Look, the guy's crazy busy.<eos> I can't just give you his phone number."<eos> But after a few white lies,
Not only were they American born, but they bore enough of a resemblance to Piper and I that we could make it work.<eos> Only problem?<eos> Olivia is the daughter of a mining magnate, which means she is loaded.<eos> So I had to earn money somehow.<eos> And I'm not saying I raked in the rubles, but I did make enough to afford what we needed to pass ourselves off as Mr. and Mrs. McMahon.<eos> I didn't forget about my old life completely.<eos> I shot Rebecca an e-mail once or twice so she could let everyone know I was okay.<eos> I told her that I met a girl, and that I'd be home soon, and she said,<eos> "You met a girl?<eos> In Russia?
NZT, it's gonna change everything, and you and me, we get a say in whether that's a good thing or a disaster.<eos> You matter now.<eos> That's hard, but you can't walk away from this.<eos> Ever since I started taking these pills, everyone's told me that I'm through making my own choices.<eos> Whatever we did off of NZT, whatever we felt off of NZT, we were lesser versions of ourselves.<eos> We have to be rational, and love has no place in that.<eos> This is the real me, Brian.<eos> And the real me needs... the real you.<eos> After a week in a two-room flat on Bolshoy Prospekt, the combination of NZT with the palace of an oligarch made everything seem a little heightened.<eos> You good?
Has he?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Vacation request?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have taken exactly one and a half sick days since you've been here at the CJC, and we practically had to remove you from the building for the half day.<eos> Well, that was for... allergies, and...<eos> Yeah, and now, suddenly, you're requesting a vacation of "indeterminate length."<eos> Is that even a thing?<eos> You know, Rebecca, we have every available intelligence asset looking for Brian.<eos> On the ground, in the sky.
- Previously on Limitless...<eos> - My name's Sands. I'm your new boss.<eos> The woman who tried to shoot Mr. Morra is Piper Baird.<eos> If the FBI finds this woman before we do, she can tie the senator to NZT, which means...<eos> No more booster shots.<eos> We got a DNA sample.<eos> It was Piper Baird<eos> - on those tracks.
Art DeVera went to Costa Rica to buy a black market liver.<eos> Transplant went fine, but he ended up owing the broker some money.<eos> And when he couldn't pay, they sent someone to...<eos> repossess the liver.<eos> Oh. Roper was crazy rich.<eos> A guy like this could definitely afford a new kidney.<eos> You say the housekeeper found him?<eos> Wasn't he married?<eos> - Where's the wife?<eos> - Downstairs.
That's very responsible.<eos> And our fishing lines were cast.<eos> We just had to wait for a bite.<eos> And in the meantime, I had plenty of other stuff to do.<eos> Hey, can I head out?<eos> I'm still crazy jet-lagged, and I read somewhere that it takes like a week for every time zone to, you know, readjust.<eos> Brian, it's fine.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> - Big day tomorrow.<eos> - All right.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.<eos> Should we follow?<eos> No.<eos> Let him go.<eos> It took three subway changes, but I finally lost Mr. X.<eos> Two more trains, and I made it to St. Ann's.<eos> Senator Morra!<eos> Senator Morra!<eos> You want him?<eos> All right.
Or, he-he can't talk.<eos> He's been in a coma for months.<eos> - Show me the book.<eos> - Well, I had to hide it... ever since you guys started doing random searches.<eos> Which made my life way suckier, by the way, even though I did deserve it.<eos> McGolrick Park.<eos> You started running there after Naz put the new rules in place, and you realized that if you sprinted ahead of your tail, you'd have a minute or two, maybe, where they wouldn't have their eyes on you.<eos> So you found a hiding spot.<eos> Not far off the path.<eos> Under a bush?
Well...<eos> I don't know the last time you checked a clock, but I kind of turned back<eos> - into a pumpkin about an hour ago.<eos> - Brian?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I know.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I told Ike we were pulling an all-nighter, so we were able to clear another pill.<eos> I'm good for another six hours.<eos> All right.
They have these badass 3-D printers, right?<eos> With this list of traits, plus some tweaking to their software, we could actually print a copy of Hawks, run that through the...<eos> That would be great, except for a really awkward date that I had with Quentin a little while back, so, maybe we don't have to ask them for any favors?<eos> - I was actually thinking that...<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> You went on a date with Quentin?<eos> Does this mean we can't go to CRAFT ever again?<eos> Clock is ticking, Brian.<eos> All right, fine.
I'm gonna get a cup of decaf.<eos> - Rebecca? - Mm.<eos> What are you all working on?<eos> Leads.<eos> It's a case Cyber asked me<eos> - to look in on.<eos> - What happened?<eos> You bleeding?<eos> Oh, no, I just spilled something.<eos> - On your shoulder?
The FBI doesn't know enough about that shot, and if something<eos> - happens to you...<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm a liability. I know.<eos> Look, just... take this, okay?<eos> There should be some valuable information in there somewhere.<eos> I think.<eos> Sure.<eos> - I have to get back.<eos> - All right.
SAC Pouran.<eos> It's been a minute.<eos> Rebecca Harris,<eos> Agent Adam Brewster, DEA.<eos> He's our liaison for this investigation.<eos> Naz and I worked pretty close the last time this stuff was on the streets.<eos> This time it's worse.<eos> So you guys got blindsided, too.<eos> Well, at least it's confined to New York City.<eos> For now.
I might've made a call, yeah.<eos> There might be a party tonight.<eos> Do they have some?<eos> Thought you weren't cool.<eos> You're not a narc, are you?<eos> Yes, Grover, and I work for the FBI, in an office called Headquarters!<eos> with an exclamation point.<eos> All right, all right, I just meant you were freaked out about the side effects.<eos> And I don't want to ruin anyone's trip by bringing along Debbie Downer.<eos> So you on the bus?
- Look, I want to buy drugs...<eos> - with you.<eos> Wow.<eos> An entire hallway made with drinking straws...?<eos> I think we're in the right place.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, uh, just hang back and follow my lead.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna go look for Alice.<eos> All right, yeah.
Well, I'm no biochemist.<eos> But I do know the chemical compound that makes NZT NZT.<eos> No one is producing legitimate drugs with that compound in the numbers required to fuel this outbreak.<eos> So, if you find that chemical and you find who's buying it in mass amounts...<eos> Even a half-decent investigator should be able to find their way to the lab producing it.<eos> What's the chemical?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wouldn't even recognize it if you told me.<eos> But there are only so many neuroenhancing compounds in the world, much less New York.<eos> Now, about my transfer...
God forbid some wet work comes along... I'm your guy.<eos> Just let's say I know my way around a length of piano wire.<eos> I'm sure I'd bring a lot to the team.<eos> But I'm the CEO of Manchester-Reid now.<eos> I don't think you can afford me.<eos> W-Wait, uh, what'd you just say?<eos> We're not gonna be bodyguards anymore?<eos> You're in.<eos> You're gonna be working cases.<eos> Real cases.
You should maybe wear something tighter. Tight.<eos> I... I can do tight.<eos> Yeah, no, tight's good.<eos> Hello? Sarah Bennett, you have a call from...<eos> Tom Winston.<eos> Press one to accept.<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> I read your article in The Bulletin.<eos> Okay.
If I could go back, I'd take her place.<eos> I would.<eos> What are you looking for exactly?<eos> No, Sheridan and Market are north of here.<eos> So a vehicle would pass by here south heading towards the hospital, right?<eos> Probably.<eos> It's the most direct route.<eos> Why did you have CCTV installed outside the paper, anyway?<eos> You make more enemies than friends in this line of work.<eos> Especially in a small town.
No, really?<eos> He does? Knock me out with a feather.<eos> I think what alison's trying to say is that... The executioner's not concerned with being economical.. With his killings.<eos> Well, that brings up the key question I have.<eos> What does this killer want?<eos> Why is he doing this?<eos> Thoughts? Well, I feel like the religious nature Of these crimes can't be ignored.<eos> "my god is a vengeful god."<eos> Jesus also says, "turn the other cheek."<eos> In the new testament.
What is he doing?<eos> Sarah, come see this.<eos> Where the hell's he going?<eos> Sarah, my spidey-senses are tingling And telling me that we should not be doing this.<eos> Wanna just stay in the car?<eos> It's okay, you know.<eos> You don't have to be brave for me.<eos> I know, but I need to be brave for justin.<eos> -Okay?<eos> -Okay.
No.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I'm off-duty.<eos> I don't care how many shots of jãger you did or with who.<eos> I just wanna make sure you get home safe and sound.<eos> Go on. Get in.<eos> I'll drive you home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So where are all your friends?<eos> At a party.
Jesus Christ, Cam, you just buried your wife a week ago.<eos> You're gonna wanna watch what you're saying, sir.<eos> And you're gonna wanna stop thinking with your dick and start thinking like a cop!<eos> And until you can, I want you to go home!<eos> Look, whoever took Ariel is a target now.<eos> The same way June was.<eos> That's my concern!<eos> I want you to go home.<eos> I want you to go home, Cam!<eos> Now!
I want you to go home, Cam!<eos> Now!<eos> What are you gonna have?<eos> Well, it's a toss up between the osso bucco potato stack and the Chinese chicken salad with mandarin staples.<eos> Welcome to 1996.<eos> Cheers.<eos> To what?<eos> The biggest story since Casey Anthony.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not sure everyone shares your enthusiasm.<eos> Okay.
Dylan, a woman I saw this afternoon is lying dead in a motel room because Cam and I got too close to something.<eos> That's my point.<eos> And instead of asking if I'm okay, you ask if you can interview me.<eos> Fine!<eos> No interview. How insensitive of me to try to help you find a missing girl, right?<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Now I'm the bad guy.<eos> You're classic.<eos> What the hell are you doing out here all alone?<eos> This time of night?
I dropped you off, I saw you walk in, close the door, lock it.<eos> I had no idea The Executioner was inside waiting for you.<eos> You know the punishment for lust is being smothered in fire and brimstone?<eos> But what's the punishment...<eos> For pride?<eos> Come on now, Sarah.<eos> It's not like you to get tongue tied.<eos> What's the punishment?<eos> - Being broken on the wheel.<eos> - On the wheel, yeah.
Dylan, I know you've been focusing on the present-day killings, but... you haven't come across anything new about my parents, have you?<eos> Yeah, sorry, I was just putting something away.<eos> Anything new, like what?<eos> I don't know, actu...<eos> I just get the feeling that Tom isn't telling me everything.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think he, uh... he's holding something back?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well, you know, um, nothing comes to mind, but... you know, I haven't really been looking.<eos> Well, okay.
I found your website.<eos> Okay, Sarah, listen. Um...<eos> What?<eos> What are you gonna say? Okay, look...<eos> I've... I've... I've been following the Executioner's story for a while.<eos> You certainly did.<eos> But when I fell in love with you, it was not because of the story.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I fell in love with you because I fell... in love... with you.<eos> Sarah.
Come on!<eos> You don't know, bitch...<eos> Get down on your goddamn knees!<eos> Cuff yourself.<eos> Radio.<eos> Car keys.<eos> - You gotta be kidding me<eos> - Where are they?<eos> They're by the door.<eos> All right, then.
All of it.<eos> So says the Lord.<eos> Says the Lord.<eos> Righteous.<eos> "And deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed."<eos> Robbed.<eos> "You're shed blood of the innocent."<eos> Innocent blood.<eos> Innocent.<eos> Innocent.
This is the exact opposite of what I wanted!<eos> I - I ruined this!<eos> I ruin everything!<eos> I ruin everything!<eos> I'm gonna rest here, okay?<eos> Sarah. Did I tell you about the first t I saw you, Sarah?<eos> Camp Motega.<eos> Your first day there.<eos> And you were sitting by the lake running your fingers through the water.<eos> In the air...
Don't move into any cursed homes.<eos> And don't... befriend anyone with the last name "Henry," "Dahmer," or "Bundy. "<eos> Deal.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Robin.<eos> You're not.<eos> I'm gonna be crashing on your couch every other weekend.<eos> - You take care of her!<eos> - Don't worry about that.<eos> Just worry about selling this house.<eos> All right.
Okay, but you will be back in time for this stupid thing, right?<eos> Yeah, I'll be home.<eos> I don't want to be out here when the hunters show.<eos> Well if they were more careful, you wouldn't have to do this every year.<eos> Yeah, well, I want to.<eos> It keeps the deer away.<eos> And that's all that matters.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'll check in with you in the morning.<eos> All right.
When you try and do things... things go wrong.<eos> Come on, Alexei.<eos> Anything.<eos> I can't remember any of this, I don't know.<eos> You're going to have to try.<eos> Just think, Alexei.<eos> Was it a male?<eos> Female?<eos> Near a house?<eos> On a road?
Was it a male?<eos> Female?<eos> Near a house?<eos> On a road?<eos> Were there any other people around when it happened?<eos> Does any of this look familiar?<eos> That.<eos> I remember running past that.<eos> - I need you to think.<eos> - Which direction?
The first time I saw her, she was in the graveyard in the town, she was putting flowers on your grandmother's grave.<eos> I saw her, and...<eos> I could not help myself, I had to speak to her.<eos> And so I lied, I told her my mother was buried there, too.<eos> The next day I took her for coffee.<eos> I took her hand.<eos> And I never wanted to let go.<eos> She had no idea who you were?<eos> No...<eos> Not at first.
Do you know, I was rather afraid of your children.<eos> But I have to confess I am rather missing them.<eos> Well, they adore you.<eos> - Even Meryl?<eos> - Even Meryl.<eos> - Just great.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> It's easily fixed.<eos> - Sorry, where do you work?<eos> - Fashion.
Gordon, your father has just told me about Whiteleys.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> It will be a challenge, but I think we can make it work.<eos> - Jimmy needs us.<eos> - Yes, well, I'm so happy for you, Harry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> - Morning, Mr Selfridge.<eos> - Hi.<eos> All right?
That is the third time this week the king has woken me because of his screaming!<eos> I think he's having bad dreams, My Queen.<eos> I want you to fix it.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> Not my problem.<eos> What is my problem is his screaming is interrupting my beauty sleep, and do you know what happens when a queen loses her beauty sleep?<eos> She can sleep in later because she's a queen and she can do whatever she wants?<eos> She could get a wrinkle.<eos> And if she gets a wrinkle... She'll make sure you get a wrinkle.<eos> On your neck!

Not just any baby.<eos> Peter Warren's granddaughter.<eos> Yeah, but from where?<eos> I can't find any public records of this child's birth.<eos> More importantly, why haven't the Warrens reported her missing?<eos> Bryce Warren?<eos> Yes?<eos> The FBI.<eos> Wanna know if I could have a word with you and your wife.<eos> About?
Do you know what it's like... to have no hope and then get it back again?<eos> They're not growing tissue.<eos> They're growing children.<eos> With surrogates.<eos> Sur... Mrs. Warren, you came here to help this baby.<eos> Your baby.<eos> We need that address.<eos> All right, we're at the facility.<eos> How do I get inside?<eos> All right.
You know, when you left the first time and I ran after you, then I came back to the house, I couldn't come down here for like six months.<eos> But no, I... I don't know, it was like... you haunted this place.<eos> And it's taken me a long time to even start to let that go.<eos> The drugs had me.<eos> And they were stronger than anything. But what you and I had... that was strong, too.<eos> That's why I had to come back and warn you.<eos> About Asa?<eos> I was there when they shot him. Shot who?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - At... at the pharmacy.
There are nine rings of hell, and actually, I think they're called circles.<eos> And yeah, they're pretty much all represented here.<eos> Your sister's gonna be a proctologist.<eos> There's about 500 jokes I can make up about that if that'll make you feel any better.<eos> You're not helping.<eos> Look, I just... I... I feel...<eos> Oh, please, don't tell me how you feel.<eos> I don't care.<eos> How about you just leave me alone?<eos> - All right?
Construction job.<eos> I was reinforcing the floor, and I did this, and that made me drop the nail gun, and a nail just came shooting up, so I covered my face because, like, "oh, crap, nail."<eos> You may feel some numbness or radiating pain in your arm.<eos> Oh, I haven't been able to feel anything for a while now.<eos> You mean figuratively or literally?<eos> No.<eos> In here.<eos> Just... not since she broke up with me.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go page ortho.<eos> All righty, then, yeah.
I can't do this without him.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay, there's a lot more inflammatory tissue than I thought.<eos> Could be the cause of the blockage.<eos> You seeing what I'm seeing?<eos> Holy kumquat.<eos> You took the words right out of my mouth.<eos> Why would there be an abscess at the side of the jejunojejunostomy?<eos> Because saying jejunojejunostomy is just so much fun.<eos> - [laughs] - All right?
I'll repair the damaged vein.<eos> Is that even a thing?<eos> If I have a viable graft, yes.<eos> Saphenous vein.<eos> It's thick enough, and she can go without it.<eos> Prep another surgical tray, place it over the patient's pelvis.<eos> I'm sorry to be playing catch-up here, but huh?<eos> I'm gonna splay the harvested vein, cut it into pieces, and then sew the pieces back together so that I can make a wider vein.<eos> - You've done it before?<eos> - Yes, on pigs.

- It wasn't X-ray detectable.<eos> So, what?<eos> The pledgets we use have radio-opaque threads.<eos> They show up on X-ray.<eos> I called Dr. Bell.<eos> She said Hope Zion's never even used these pledgets before.<eos> So, how did it get inside her?<eos> Well, Dr. Bell said they still use them in The Caribbean, South and Central America.<eos> My guess, she wasn't getting the results she wanted with your bypass, so she went ahead and had a second surgery.<eos> In the Dominican.

I'll monitor for infection and make sure her clotting factors are up.<eos> Great, and the rest is up to her.<eos> Alex.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - There you are.<eos> I want to discuss one of your patient's head CT's...<eos> I got caught up in the O.R.<eos> I'm sorry, which patient?<eos> Kristine Fields.<eos> She has a slow-growing meningioma in her<eos> - occipital lobe.
Acute cervical sprain.<eos> I had a similar accident back in '07.<eos> A couple of twins.<eos> One magical weekend in Bali.<eos> Nice.<eos> Bali.<eos> Well, it was the Bali room at the Cadillac Inn.<eos> Niagara falls.<eos> But the twins were real.<eos> Some parts anyway.
I hear he's a little salty.<eos> Tell me you are not making jokes right now.<eos> I'm just saying, who goes for this many second opinions?<eos> A worried mother.<eos> I don't blame her.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Mordecai's been here before.<eos> At Hope Zion?<eos> Yeah, look at this.<eos> Last year.

Gonna make sure this goes out.<eos> Is Marwan Hanano his real name or an alias?<eos> We don't know.<eos> How'd you get this information?<eos> Meisner.<eos> He wanted us to be aware of it.<eos> We got a Wesen terrorist working for Black Claw, loose in Portland.<eos> We don't know where he is, what he wants, or who his contacts are.<eos> I'm assuming Meisner wants us to find him so HW can deal with him.<eos> Basically, yeah.
There's gonna be a new development in the keen case.<eos> What development?<eos> It's gonna break, and when it does,<eos> I need you and your friends to be there.<eos> so much for the exclusive.<eos> Fine.<eos> But i get something in return.<eos> Your story.<eos> The story of the f.B.I.

I've read all about this place.<eos> Temple of the nine moons, man.<eos> Sanctuary.<eos> Like churches in highlander.<eos> Ok, just...<eos> These are lords, ok?<eos> Just listen to what they have to say.<eos> Hear them out.<eos> You finally found your place in the world.<eos> Our world.
Been that way for what, six months now?<eos> Jesus christ, this is the longest I've been stuck on a job Since I was flippin' burgers at big kahuna in high school.<eos> I flipped the burgers, you bussed the tables.<eos> But the point is that the lords depend on us to deliver.<eos> But for us to deliver, you need to deliver.<eos> Like fed-fuckin'-ex.<eos> Absolutely, positively has to be right here, right now.<eos> Three hundred and Seventeen.<eos> Three hundred and seventeen thousand From the contents of the safe behind that bar, Unless you want to get lit up like a roman candle.<eos> Ok.

Is it what's going on between me and your moms?<eos> Because we told you, no matter what happens, it will never change the way we feel about you and your sisters.<eos> I was just angry.<eos> You move out, you make us meet Angela, and you move in with her, and you don't even talk to us about it.<eos> Like, what kind of father does that?<eos> A real man apologizes when he's done something wrong.<eos> I guess the way I handled all of that was wrong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry, son.<eos> All right.
- Spooky, isn't it?<eos> - Looking for a story?<eos> - I think I just found one.<eos> Brains with minds of their own?<eos> - No one will believe that...<eos> this is America. - Who are you?<eos> Special Agent Dan Dangerous from Scotland Yard, Scotland.<eos> The Doctor for short.<eos> See, they've got institutes all over the world.<eos> And always in capital cities.
- But you can't get a fix on it?<eos> I'm trying, the shielding's too good.<eos> - Can't we track the signals?<eos> - Tracking them now.<eos> So what powers do you have?<eos> Well, basic flying, - basic super strength...<eos> - Basic X-ray vision? Yep.<eos> Is that ever tempting?<eos> Adolescence was difficult.<eos> - In what sense?
- What plan?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> The operation is swift and quite painless.<eos> You realise I'm talking to my colleague in the jar?<eos> You'll find me a lot harder to cut open than your previous victims.<eos> Harmony Shoal have been conquering your world for five years.<eos> - Whatever our faults, we have the virtue of patience.<eos> - Ghost!

Hey!<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Go!<eos> I'm gonna stay and guard here, OK?<eos> One sweep and we're done.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Whoa! Put your glasses on, four eyes!<eos> Idiot.<eos> How could you hit me there... of all places?<eos> Oh, Jesus.
It's just common courtesy.<eos> Ask politely.<eos> Burt, just shut the fuck up.<eos> Tell me where you are right now.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Um, I saw something about the east wing.<eos> Shit.<eos> You're about to have company.<eos> Really?<eos> OK.
It's not gonna happen.<eos> I'm not gonna kill them, Seth.<eos> You are.<eos> Richard, come on, man.<eos> Two Geckos are better than one, no?<eos> Yes, that is true.<eos> Richard, come on, man.<eos> She's fucking with you.<eos> Amaru told me the truth about this world.<eos> And the next.
Yeah, that's not mysterious at all.<eos> You, um... you did let a couple of things slip last night.<eos> Did I now?<eos> That girl you were crazy about... got herself killed.<eos> She didn't get herself killed.<eos> So... what happened to her?<eos> I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> You also talked about your wife...<eos> Margaret?<eos> And your daughter.
Out of the way, Spicoli.<eos> [Burt] Marvin, what the hell is going on there?<eos> - God damn it.<eos> Put that tall one on.<eos> - Tall one?<eos> What?<eos> I just figured out what we can do with her.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> All right. Burt says to stick her in the pen.<eos> The pen?
She must be one of those demons from hell, 'cause I've never seen Burt use the cage before.<eos> Is this the best you can do?<eos> This ain't gonna hold her.<eos> No, take a closer look, man.<eos> Burt scorched the floor with a ring of Xibalban bone marrow to help keep hellspawns trapped.<eos> [Seth] What?<eos> Transportin' them to the Labyrinth and all that.<eos> So this is Ilhicamina's cage.<eos> Richie, what's up?<eos> You okay, buddy?
There were stories.<eos> Legends. A queen of Xibalba who came to this realm.<eos> And when were you gonna tell us that?<eos> - It's just a legend. - OK, you know what, where is your boss?<eos> Clearly, you don't have the information we need, maybe she does.<eos> Lord Venganza is in hiding.<eos> She's a target.<eos> Oh, she's a target.<eos> Subtly ironic. We got hell's prisoners coming at us day and night, but your boss, your boss is the target.<eos> OK.
Nope! Dandelion Paw. (laughs)<eos> Actually, I'm looking for a very particular strain.<eos> Do you have, uh... (whispers) Ilhicamina?<eos> I might've caught that once in the '70s.<eos> In those days, we didn't think twice about goin' bareback, you know?<eos> (chuckles) Actually, it's been around for centuries.<eos> OK, just buy an eighth and let's get outta here, Richard.<eos> Come on. I'm sorry I don't stock your ganja, but, um...<eos> Free samples.<eos> In the back.
(chuckles) Actually, it's been around for centuries.<eos> OK, just buy an eighth and let's get outta here, Richard.<eos> Come on. I'm sorry I don't stock your ganja, but, um...<eos> Free samples.<eos> In the back.<eos> Hmm... We love free samples.<eos> We do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So where did you hear about this El Camino, anyway?<eos> Ilhicamina.
Why do you think we take away their venom?<eos> That's their power.<eos> World's gonna need a few brave souls like us to help to restore the natural order of things.<eos> Keep these animals in line, instead of letting' 'em run wild.<eos> Go on, now.<eos> Take it.<eos> Prove to me you're willing to keep these snakes in line.<eos> Starting with the professor here.<eos> Wakey wakey.<eos> Ranger?

Well, well, well.<eos> Humpty fuckin' Dumpty.<eos> I understand you... infants... still haven't stopped the Queen of Hell.<eos> Perhaps I can be of some assistance.<eos> Hell is coming, and I'm the only one who can stop it.<eos> And you guys chain me like a dog.<eos> I mean, who are you people?<eos> Ragtag band of criminals and bloodsuckers, fighting for what?<eos> Truth? Justice?<eos> The Mexican-American way?
And guess what?<eos> We can't have her running her mouth about us to anyone.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now, normally, I would just feed on her, but since I know you guys grew up together I'll do the humane thing...<eos> I'll just turn her.<eos> Dakota...<eos> I told you to get away from me.<eos> You gotta let that shit go, man.<eos> You OK?
Open your hearts, and open your hands.<eos> If you want some forgiveness, spill some blood for the Lord!<eos> You... will be saved.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> But I gotta ask.<eos> Why'd you guys pick me?<eos> Because I saw what you did to those girls.<eos> What girls?<eos> In the mall.<eos> Parking lot.
Ladies and gentlemen... we are...<eos> Fanglorious!<eos> So I just want to know, you good at anything?<eos> Say what?<eos> You know.<eos> Like drawing.<eos> Woodwork?<eos> You play piano?<eos> Violin?<eos> Bassoon.
She was all bitten up by rats.<eos> Covered in blood, foaming' at the mouth, all right?<eos> So, I ran, I got Dad, and I...<eos> Are you fucking with me right now?<eos> - Dad shot Peaches?<eos> - No.<eos> I did.<eos> Dad decided it was a teachable moment.<eos> It was quick...<eos> OK?
You need me to show you the way.<eos> I know its secrets.<eos> Richard's right.<eos> For all we know, you could be after buried treasure.<eos> O otra pendejada.<eos> I'm in it for the cause.<eos> No tricks.<eos> - I can handle him.<eos> - Good.<eos> Okay.
We're at Butte Memorial.<eos> Call in all the rapid response teams we got.<eos> I've gotta get out there.<eos> The others need my help.<eos> Right, be...<eos> I'll be fine, just go.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> -For bringing this all in our lives.<eos> -Okay.
Kate, don't do this.<eos> But how could I not?<eos> You brought them all together.<eos> Those thieves and those... bloodsuckers.<eos> You made them all heroes.<eos> They let you die.<eos> And you made me kill.<eos> After all that I've done, I deserve this walk.<eos> Are you here for redemption?<eos> In whose eyes?
CULEBRA: It ain't by choice.<eos> - God dammit, what did I just...<eos> - Hold on a second!<eos> What do you mean it's not by choice?<eos> We can't go back to Waco.<eos> They'd burn us alive down there.<eos> - You mean staking you?<eos> - No!<eos> I mean houses full of snakes going up in flames.<eos> Immolating.
OK.<eos> So, we find him, knock him down, and maybe the rest will come tumbling after.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now, all you have to do is check your rabieta at the door.<eos> - My raba-what?<eos> - Look, I get it.<eos> You think being a vampire cop ruined your marriage.<eos> Or maybe you just blame us for being a shitty husband.<eos> Either way, you live in that sad apartment getting drunk every night.<eos> OK, now...
I hit his mask earlier, I smashed a piece off, I think it hurt him.<eos> So I say we go for the noggin', right?<eos> We pound on him, until...<eos> - Pound on him?<eos> - Can I finish?<eos> - That's your plan. - (growls)<eos> I light him up.<eos> You sneak around behind him.<eos> We meet in the middle, squash him like a piñata at a quincen...<eos> - quincen... - Quinceañera.
I did not know that, no.<eos> Got second at nationals.<eos> I had to drop out.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> But I have come up with the best argument for you removing your tumor immediately.<eos> Okay?<eos> O-kay.<eos> I'm loving the confidence.<eos> - Just hear me out.<eos> - Okay.
I just...<eos> I just don't know how much more of it I can take.<eos> Are you thinking of leaving him?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Why would you ask me that?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's none of my business.<eos> I need to get some air.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You okay?
- That's 'cause your mom was the shit.<eos> - You know what we gotta do?<eos> Get sponsored this summer.<eos> Start skating for money.<eos> - Dawg, that'd be sick.<eos> - I'm fucking tired of Cleveland.<eos> I'm tired of these long winters of skating in basements.<eos> Man, I want to go somewhere with no rules.<eos> We can chill, shred all day..<eos> Like Cali.
Right for as long..<eos> No..<eos> Okay, thank you very much, miss, thank you.<eos> Fuck off! Fuck you!<eos> Fuck sake! Fuck me.<eos> Holy shit, Cisco, I forgot.<eos> Look what I've invested in, look at this. Look what I invested in.<eos> This is one of those signs that you twirl on the corner.<eos> - Ooh, that's like those signs that they have down at the, uh..<eos> Tax places. - Tax places!
- It wasn't him.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - Where's he going anyway?<eos> - See, I almost threw up on the last ride.<eos> Turquoise, what's up?<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Yo, what can I get for a dollar?<eos> - You can get the fuck outta my face.<eos> - Patty cake, get off the counter. Get off the counter.<eos> - You good?
Yes. Yes.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> And here it is... the grand-prize game.<eos> What you do next will decide whether your crap day becomes everyone's last crap day or just another crap day.<eos> Get some guns to the back of their heads.<eos> Good.<eos> Now... level with their noses, so if you have to fire... it'll be a real mess.<eos> Kid...<eos> Right here.<eos> Kid... now.
Do not follow me again.<eos> Clear? Sir, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Uh, Karen Bassett's here to see you.<eos> It's all good. We're done here.<eos> Hello, James.<eos> Hey, Karen.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> Pleasure. What did you want to talk about?<eos> Um, I just wanted to ask you if you were willing to move our special meeting tomorrow to, uh, the Odette on the Hudson.<eos> Okay.
What happened?<eos> She told him about the baby. He fucked it up, right?<eos> That's why he called you.<eos> He didn't say much. He didn't want to talk about it.<eos> She's definitely not gonna keep it now.<eos> I told her to tell him.<eos> No wonder she's not texting me back.<eos> Look, Tash, can he crash here tonight?<eos> If he leaves, I'm afraid we're gonna find him toasting to the sunrise at O'Malley's, you know this.<eos> All right?
When the deal happens with Karen Bassett... And it will...<eos> You and I, Miss Thing, we're gonna be jet-setting all over this big wide world.<eos> London, Paris, even Tokyo.<eos> You know what? Hmm.<eos> I'll let you be my general counsel.<eos> That's a completely different kind of law, Jamie.<eos> But you gonna learn. - Am I?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> You're gonna learn that we're gonna be in the clubs at night. We're gonna be sleeping during the day.<eos> And in between...
Tommy, the transport will be most vulnerable... here at the bend in the road.<eos> What the fuck's he doing?<eos> The GPS.<eos> 'Cause that explains it.<eos> Let's just get this over with.<eos> Heads up, boys. Here we go.<eos> - Nice to see you again.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - Where's his tracker?<eos> - Left ankle.
The dog always goes back to the master, eh?<eos> Unless you cut the dog's fucking throat.<eos> Tommy! Tommy, come on, man.<eos> You should've seen what his fucking goon did to Bell.<eos> He's still got to fucking walk, huh?<eos> Let's get him up. Come on.<eos> You think you're gonna fucking kill me and live to talk about it?<eos> I'm gonna erase your fucking bloodline.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Make you extinct!<eos> You all right?
Fuck.<eos> After I got popped, they went straight...<eos> Deep breath, please.<eos> Deep breath again.<eos> After I got popped, they went straight for Lobos's GPS tracker, rolled up with fucking bolt cutters, ready for it, which means we've got a big fucking leak.<eos> GPS trackers are standard operating procedure with high-value prisoners.<eos> They were likely prepared for it just in case.<eos> Right, Mike, they... but they knew exactly what van to hit, what route... stop, man...<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - What time.
I got no network. I got no supplies.<eos> I'm out of the fucking game.<eos> I know how you think.<eos> You will stall and deal with me like you did Lobos, but first remember my security team is in your clubs.<eos> We know your home, your family, Angela.<eos> You can kill me, but it is of no consequence, 'cause I am not Lobos, and my organization does not die with me.<eos> Call Tommy and tell him it's time to go back to work.<eos> Do not worry.<eos> You are very safe.<eos> For now.
All officers evacuate.<eos> Evacuate. 10-33, Midland Circle.<eos> This is what we get, isn't it?<eos> For ever thinking we could make it work.<eos> Who says we didn't?<eos> We're together.<eos> Something I've wanted since I first laid eyes on you.<eos> We can have it forever.<eos> Gao... What is happening?<eos> The end.
He said, "Protect my city."<eos> Jesus.<eos> Finally getting some answers to all the mysterious shaking and sinking around the city.<eos> The mayor's office confirms that unpermitted construction around Midland Circle is to blame.<eos> Oddly enough, I'm told the implosion actually settled the ground again, meaning we're off to a more stable start today.<eos> It's certainly weird, but what can I say?<eos> It's just another day in New York City.<eos> At least... the rent is cheap?<eos> Your thoughts, next.<eos> Trish Talk.
How are you?<eos> You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.<eos> Look, I know you, Danny.<eos> You are finding some way to beat yourself up about this.<eos> In K'un-Lun, they... they taught me that there's a lesson in every tragedy.<eos> And even while experiencing pain... there's an opportunity to grow and find clarity.<eos> Anything becoming clear?<eos> New York.
Superhero and lawyer go missing at the same time.<eos> Right.<eos> I can't shake this feeling, like it's... like it's not real.<eos> Or... Or even if it is, like, it's not over, because they're still digging, right?<eos> - Karen, it's been days.<eos> - Maybe he made it out.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Sit with me?<eos> - Of course.
- Was I right? - Not even close.<eos> I think I just like saying "intake manifold."<eos> Maybe when I get a job, I'll get AAA.<eos> I thought you worked at the water company?<eos> Temping.<eos> How's your parents? They're doing okay.<eos> I should, um, get going, actually, for dinner, but, um, we should make a plan.<eos> I'll send you a text.<eos> Or we could do that now since we're both here.<eos> - What? - Nothing.

Why are you in Germany?<eos> Regulatory mess.<eos> Those guys do not screw around.<eos> - But listen, I got you an interview!<eos> - What?
It combined everything that was separate and sloppy into one account.<eos> No more forgetting your password, multiple identities, identity theft.<eos> You use your real name, which is tied to your credit card...<eos> I think grandma's falling asleep.<eos> Before TrueYou, it was like you needed a different vehicle for every single one of your errands.<eos> And no one should have to own 87 different cars.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It's the chaos of the web made elegant and simple.<eos> Speed round.

Not mutually exclusive.<eos> Needs of the society or needs of the individual?<eos> - Should be the same.<eos> - You're most scared of?<eos> Unfulfilled potential.<eos> All right.<eos> Heliport, gym, daycare, organic farm, pétanque.<eos> - Pétanque? - Oh, it's like bocce but French.<eos> Tetherball, lap pool, social pool, doga.<eos> Kennel, night club, salon, maker space, rock climbing, trampoline, clinic, volleyball.
Let's go.<eos> Your legs are so long.<eos> What?<eos> It's all on sensors.<eos> The elevator reads your ID and it says, "Hello."<eos> We do that for visitors mostly.<eos> They're usually impressed.<eos> Annie, that's the worst picture of me ever.<eos> Oh, come on... oh.<eos> Oh, dear. - Danny!
And that's part of what I'm here to talk about.<eos> I love to surf, and in the past, I would have to wake up and call the local surf shop to ask about the local breaks.<eos> And pretty soon, the local surf shop stopped answering their phone.<eos> And then I got a cell phone and I could call up my buddies who were already out at the beach before me.<eos> And I could ask them, but they too stopped answering their phones.<eos> And then came... the Internet.<eos> Some geniuses set up cameras on the beaches, so I could log on and get some very crude images of the waves at Stinson Beach.<eos> It was almost worse than calling the surf shop.<eos> Here's how it used to look.<eos> Almost useless, right?
Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, maybe I should be out there right now.<eos> But would it surprise you to know that this is not coming from some big camera, but actually just one of these?<eos> This camera needs no wires.<eos> It transmits this image via satellite.<eos> I set up that camera this morning.<eos> I stuck it to a tree near the dunes with no permit, nothing.<eos> In fact, no one even knows it's there.<eos> And actually, I was pretty busy this morning because here's Rodeo Beach,<eos> Montara, Ocean Beach,
So now, the entire world is watching.<eos> You know, I agree with The Hague, with the human rights activists all over the world.<eos> There needs to be accountability.<eos> Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.<eos> We will see them.<eos> We will hear them.<eos> We will hear and see everything.<eos> If it happens, we'll know.<eos> We're calling it SeeChange.<eos> SeeChange.
Oh, my God, is that Beck?<eos> So Bailey... what's he actually like?<eos> You're in the Gang of 40s.<eos> Yeah, but I don't get a ton of alone time with him.<eos> I mean, you know, a lot of people work in the White House, but how many people really get to know the president?<eos> Oh, actually, do you wanna see something?<eos> Oh, my God, you need to see this.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Okay. This is it.<eos> Nice knocker.
You have a glow.<eos> You do!<eos> I do not have a glow.<eos> Like you're with child. Ignore him.<eos> So, it's been great?<eos> I don't think I ever want to work anywhere else.<eos> I told, um, Carolina's mom...<eos> might've let your salary slip.<eos> - Oh, Mom.<eos> - What?
- If it wasn't for Annie...<eos> - Annie, how is Annie?<eos> She's good.<eos> Working too hard.<eos> What does she do, exactly?<eos> She's in the Gang of 40.<eos> She's in on all the big decisions... deals with the regulatory issues in other countries.<eos> That sounds so important!<eos> Mae, hon, would you get your daddy another beer?<eos> Sure, Dad.
Today, I call upon the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee to investigate The Circle.<eos> We cannot rely on them to say, "We're not violating antitrust laws."<eos> I'm sure The Circle will be glad to cooperate.<eos> We have every confidence that Senator Williamson's allegations will be discredited.<eos> You were probably wondering about your new screen.<eos> Hi, I'm Gina.<eos> - I'm Matt.<eos> Dan said this would be a good moment to set up all your socials.<eos> - Do you have time?<eos> - Sure.
- Great.<eos> - I take it last week you were too busy to set up your company social account, and I don't think you've imported your old profile.<eos> Sorry, I've just been kind of overwhelmed so far.<eos> - No, in a good way.<eos> I just haven't had time yet for extracurricular stuff.<eos> That's so interesting you put it that way.<eos> We actually see your profile and the activity on it as integral to your participation here.<eos> This is how your coworkers, even the ones on the other side of campus, know who you are.<eos> Communication certainly isn't extracurricular, right?<eos> Right!
- It's all connected.<eos> But you've had a blip or two when it comes to meshing with the community, like your absence at several weekend or evening events, which are, of course, optional.<eos> - I'm sorry? - Let's start with this weekend.<eos> You left campus at 11:42 p.m. on Friday, and got back 8:46 a.m. Monday.<eos> Was there work on the weekend? I didn't...<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> - So sweet. There wasn't mandatory work on the weekend.<eos> This isn't like a clock in, clock out type place, thank God!<eos> But, you know, there were thousands of people here, participating in a hundred different activities.<eos> So many!
I'm no psychologist, but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth.<eos> This is what participation is all about, bringing you, lifting you up...<eos> Thus, your participation window.<eos> I can't believe you've been here this long without being on the main social feed.<eos> You're about to have your world rocked!<eos> See, these are all of last week's messages.<eos> That's why there's so many. - 8,000?<eos> - Mm-hmm!<eos> Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here.<eos> A feast!
Listen, I've been looking into your parents' situation, and I think I have an idea.<eos> - Hi. - This is Jessica.<eos> This is Mae.<eos> - Hello, Mae, how are you?<eos> I understand you haven't done your medical intake yet.<eos> No.<eos> Can you drink this for me?<eos> All of it, if you can.<eos> I told you about Mae's dad. Mm.<eos> Multiple sclerosis.
All of it, if you can.<eos> I told you about Mae's dad. Mm.<eos> Multiple sclerosis.<eos> I did my post-doc on MS.<eos> I'd love to get some real-time data.<eos> There you go.<eos> How does this feel?<eos> Warm.<eos> Oh, is this for free?<eos> Of course.
- I love you too.<eos> - Bye, Mom!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Aww... You're welcome.<eos> You okay?<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> Openness is something we advocate here at The Circle.<eos> We live it.<eos> We demonstrate our commitment to openness every day.<eos> Our government, not so much.
Do they wear a bracelet, or...<eos> We place chips in the bone.<eos> You're...<eos> You're serious.<eos> I'm serious about immediately reducing kidnapping, rape, and murder by 99%.<eos> I think I'm gonna get a drink, but...<eos> - It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey, check your email, - 'cause I sent you an invite.<eos> - Awesome.
So, you're gonna have to leave your stuff outside before we go in.<eos> It's just because you're not supposed to, you know...<eos> So, I'm just gonna have to take this and this.<eos> I want to thank you already for this.<eos> I love following strangers down dark corridors.<eos> - This is the best.<eos> - Almost there.<eos> This holds Congresswoman Santos, every second of her, from now on.<eos> And this will be the next one.<eos> - Just these?
And this will be the next one.<eos> - Just these?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> There's more.<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh, it's supposed to be a part of the subway, but they abandoned it.<eos> - Where does it go?<eos> - It connects to the bay, but I've traveled about a half a mile into it.<eos> And that's where the rest of it will be.<eos> - Rest of what?
What's the problem?<eos> I thought I saw good stuff going on.<eos> They started calling me a "deer killer."<eos> And then there's a campaign to shut me down.<eos> I wasn't even online.<eos> I was working, and when I checked my email, there were death threats.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Death threats, Mae.<eos> Obviously, I never meant for this to happen, but I... I can fix it.<eos> Mae...

And these experiences were facilitated by generous humans who shared what they saw with the world, my son included, and there are many others out there that are just like Gunnar.<eos> Now, does it feel right to have deprived them of seeing what you saw, Mae?<eos> It doesn't.<eos> It feels very wrong.<eos> It was selfish.<eos> When you deprive others of experiences like the ones I had... you're essentially stealing from them.<eos> Knowledge is a basic human right.<eos> Access to all possible human experience is a basic human right.<eos> Tell 'em, Mae! Thank you, Mae, for your candor and your consummate humanity.<eos> Now... now the best part.
- Hello.<eos> - Good morning, everyone.<eos> Sun is shining, and I definitely need my coffee.<eos> We are in my third week of transparency, and we're up to... 2,308,007 viewers. Wow.<eos> Did I tell you guys I'm not a morning person? Okay.<eos> Among all of those viewers are...<eos> - I don't even know...<eos> - Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> - Hi! - Hi, Mae.
- Hi, Mae.<eos> So, this is where I worked when I first arrived at The Circle, and this is where I still work at The Circle, because even though I have you guys looking over my shoulder,<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it! Do it!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Tell her own story.<eos> Stop looking that ashamed!<eos> All right, that's our scene.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mae Holland!
This is me brushing my teeth.<eos> If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.<eos> Good night, everyone.<eos> I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day, but I'm happy I had you with me, each and every one of you.<eos> Never a boring day here.<eos> A lot of you guys have been asking me about this sculpture, which is a treat for me. I finally get to use my art history degree.<eos> This was made by an artist who's frequently been in trouble in his own country.<eos> I want to thank all the watchers who sent Frowns to the government there, both for their persecution of the artist, and for their restriction on Internet freedoms.<eos> We have sent 180 million Frowns from the US alone. You can bet that's gonna have an effect on the regime.<eos> Annie!

Do you think?<eos> Oh, come on, false modesty won't work here.<eos> You should be psyched!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am.<eos> You're a meteor. It's insane. People are coming to me trying to get to you.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> How are you really, Annie?<eos> You look wiped.<eos> Thanks, Mae.
I know you can handle it.<eos> Oh, thank you, Mae!<eos> Your confidence in me will be the wind beneath my wings.<eos> How are your parents?<eos> Sorry.<eos> They're over that little... episode?<eos> I haven't heard from them, actually.<eos> Guess it'll just take some time.<eos> Sorry, Mae.<eos> Shit.
They're over that little... episode?<eos> I haven't heard from them, actually.<eos> Guess it'll just take some time.<eos> Sorry, Mae.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm fried... and I have to pull another all-nighter.<eos> Stenton is on my ass all the time.<eos> I shouldn't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing.<eos> And then... there's all the new work on Completion... but I assume Bailey told you about that.<eos> - Of course. - Of course.
We do, we do have to pee indoors.<eos> - She's right. - I mean, we have thousands of laws.<eos> We require citizens to do hundreds of things, but we don't require them to vote?<eos> They're already doing this in dozens of countries.<eos> With the technology we already have, users will already be registered.<eos> That means you have 241 million voters eligible to vote.<eos> You have 241 million voters that have to vote.<eos> You have the full will of the nation.<eos> And how exactly do we do that?<eos> Annie.

You know that.<eos> But, Mae, what about stragglers?
Absolutely. Every human on Earth.<eos> We can take the pulse of the nation. Everyone in the world in seconds on any subject.<eos> It's the only way, right? - Right!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> So, it looks like I've got 20 minutes here.<eos> Let's try Mom and Dad.<eos> Get you in on it. - Hey, Mae, what's up?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey, where've you been?<eos> - Mae.
You're changing the world, Mae!<eos> - We love you! Hello, everyone. I'm Mae Holland.<eos> We've had some good weeks thinking about Completion, envisioning a day when everyone is in The Circle, when all of humanity is connected and united, and it will happen.<eos> Already, 22 nations have agreed in principle to operate their elections through The Circle, with mandatory participation from all of its citizens.<eos> When everyone is united, everyone is known, heard, accountable, they can be better served.<eos> But what about the people who aren't part of The Circle, who don't want to be woven into the fabric of society, or worse, want to tear at that fabric?<eos> I want to introduce SoulSearch, and we're putting it to the test in front of the entire Circle audience, here and globally.<eos> Do you feel ready?<eos> Lined it up so far.<eos> Great.
Stop the clock.<eos> SoulSearch, baby! I guess that's it!<eos> Let's do another!<eos> We could...<eos> Maybe not a fugitive this time.<eos> Let's try for a regular civilian.<eos> Okay, everyone, we're gonna find a regular person.<eos> It can be anyone. A relative, a lost love. When everyone can be found, we can never lose a friend.<eos> We can take a suggestion from the audience.<eos> Uh, anyone?

When everyone can be found, we can never lose a friend.<eos> We can take a suggestion from the audience.<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Find Mercer!<eos> I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to be found.<eos> - Anyone else?
Uh, anyone?<eos> Find Mercer!<eos> I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to be found.<eos> - Anyone else?<eos> - Where's Mercer?<eos> Mae, this is what SoulSearch is all about, as well as Completion.<eos> - Other suggestions?<eos> - Find Mercer!<eos> This is the whole point of SoulSearch, Mae.<eos> - No. - Mercer! Mercer!
I did what you asked.<eos> You won't believe the shit I found.<eos> It's worse than I could've imagined.<eos> And... and look, Mae, I'm so sorry.<eos> I never met him, but they should build a monument to Mercer.<eos> - Yeah. - I mean, this... This changes everything.<eos> Okay, he's the martyr who will wake everyone up, right?<eos> I don't know what you're planning, but if you turn that camera back on, whatever you say about The Circle's heard around the world, and it changes everything.<eos> Hello, again.<eos> - Hi.

And when we do, when every vehicle is known and connected, the data we have will help us improve traffic patterns, keep drivers safe, and optimize Circle services across all platforms.<eos> Shopping. Lodging. Attractions.<eos> Attractions like Mae Holland!

Mae Holland.
No.<eos> He is gonna flip!<eos> - Ooh.<eos> Nice.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - That's great.<eos> I'm just excited to have my old place back to myself.<eos> And guys, after the grand opening, we finally get a chance to fire the rocket launcher.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Yes! - Nice, dude!
All of you are yourselves,<eos> - except for Dee.<eos> - Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Are you right-handed, or left-handed?<eos> - That won't come up.<eos> - Well, it could come up.<eos> - It won't!<eos> Okay. I'm gonna go with left then.<eos> - I'll go with left.<eos> - Cool.
- That won't come up.<eos> - Well, it could come up.<eos> - It won't!<eos> Okay. I'm gonna go with left then.<eos> - I'll go with left.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Left. Let's go with the hand that I am, for Christ's sakes.<eos> Hey!<eos> Mandy.<eos> Hi. Hey.
- Well, it could come up.<eos> - It won't!<eos> Okay. I'm gonna go with left then.<eos> - I'll go with left.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Left. Let's go with the hand that I am, for Christ's sakes.<eos> Hey!<eos> Mandy.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> Ooh.
Hi. Hey.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Why'd you run up ahead of me there, Brian?<eos> Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad.<eos> Oh.<eos> So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.<eos> Oh, so that<eos> - must make you Prudence then.<eos> - Yes. - Uh-huh.
Oh, so that<eos> - must make you Prudence then.<eos> - Yes. - Uh-huh.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh. - He is Prudence,<eos> - and I'm Griffin.<eos> - No, he's Mac!<eos> He's just Mac, so don't...<eos> Yeah.
- and I'm Griffin.<eos> - No, he's Mac!<eos> He's just Mac, so don't...<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.<eos> And he's left-handed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I suppose I didn't know that about you.<eos> Yeah.
And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.<eos> And he's left-handed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I suppose I didn't know that about you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, well, there was<eos> - really no reason for it to come up.<eos> - Mama. Uh, guys, this is, uh,<eos> - Mandy.
Yeah.<eos> No, well, there was<eos> - really no reason for it to come up.<eos> - Mama. Uh, guys, this is, uh,<eos> - Mandy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> And this is, uh...<eos> this is little Brian Junior.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.
- Mama. Uh, guys, this is, uh,<eos> - Mandy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> And this is, uh...<eos> this is little Brian Junior.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's my son.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go with left-handed.<eos> - Left-handed or right-handed, man?
We flew out to California?<eos> Well, if you recall,<eos> I actually got off in North Dakota.<eos> Right?<eos> I'm gonna have a little bit of fun, you know, so, I picked up Mandy there at an Applebee's.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - I was pretending to be an airline pilot who flies out of Philly named Brian LeFevre.<eos> I went to an old character.<eos> I needed a complete back story for the manipulation.<eos> - Of course, of course.
- Mm.<eos> Christ, what am I gonna do here?<eos> And need I remind you, once she finds out that I'm not who I said I was, and that I don't have any money,<eos> - she could come after the bar.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - She could be entitled to that?<eos> - Ah... shit. - All right, guys, guys, everybody just calm down, all right?<eos> Maybe it's not about money for her.<eos> Look, as we all know, everything is about emotion with women.<eos> - Right, Dee?

- Look, I think the point is, maybe we got to close the emotion door for Mandy by telling her that you're gay.<eos> Yeah, right, but I already had sex with her.<eos> How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?<eos> Just go with me here.<eos> Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman, but he's got no room for her emotionally<eos> - because he's in love with me.<eos> - With you?<eos> - Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Next plan.
- Next plan.<eos> - That plan stinks, because it's always about money with women.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.<eos> You get a millionaire to bang her for a million bucks.<eos> She takes the money and runs.<eos> Would you sleep with her for a million dollars?<eos> No way.<eos> It's too much money.<eos> All right, next plan.

He's already on to another thing.<eos> All right, Christ, uh, I got to do something here.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Mac, we'll go with your plan.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Is the apartment ready?<eos> Surprise!
All right, Christ, uh, I got to do something here.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Mac, we'll go with your plan.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Is the apartment ready?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Huh.
Yes.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Is the apartment ready?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Huh.<eos> It looks, uh...<eos> Exactly the same.<eos> I was able to track down versions of our old furniture, and even found replicas of all the knickknacks that burned in the fire.<eos> - It's bizarre.<eos> - Bizarre in a good way.
It's time, Brian.<eos> Here's where things get a little bit tricky.<eos> Um... there's really no easy way to say this, but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.<eos> - He's actually my, uh...<eos> - Lover. - Partner.<eos> - Yes, well, we do make love.<eos> - We don't actually make love...<eos> - He's the power bottom.<eos> - Now he generates a tremendous amount of power...<eos> - Yeah. No, I...
He does.<eos> - No, no. It's not that I...<eos> It's just that we don't have sex.<eos> Yeah, I, uh... I sleep with women, but I'm emotionally involved with Mac, which is why... and this is the hard part...<eos> I don't have room emotionally in my life for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, I'm a little bit shocked here.<eos> Sure.
- Mm.<eos> - But I guess the most important thing is for Brian, Jr. to have a relationship with his father. And you know, Mac, you seem like a real stand-up fella, so, if you boys are open to it, the only thing I can think of better than Junior having one dad is, well, him having two.<eos> Ee.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No. - Wow.<eos> I wasn't expecting that.<eos> We're the type of guys that, um...<eos> Who would love this.<eos> Oh!<eos> Yeah.
Who would love this.<eos> Oh!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Coming.<eos> Hey, come on in.<eos> All right, Charlie, you got 15 minutes, and it's a dollar a minute starting... now.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, we're not doing this.<eos> Uh-uh.
- And I'm gone.<eos> - Uh, no, no, no, hang on.<eos> Hang on, one...<eos> Just one second.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look, I know you've always wanted a baby, right?<eos> I see you.<eos> You poke around the preschools and the playgrounds, and you got that longing look in your eye. Oh, God, that's so creepy.<eos> Well, look, I can tell you this.<eos> It...
And finally, all women's Achilles' heel... time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you done?<eos> - Because I feel like there's more.<eos> - No.<eos> - I'm seeing, like, a whole...<eos> - Yeah, this is... I'm getting to the good part.<eos> Look.<eos> Frank will provide for us.<eos> - Right?

He's got tons of money.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're never gonna have to work another day in your life.<eos> See? Zzz.<eos> All the way to sitting on the beach in Rio de Janeiro. Driving the lane to fame.<eos> Okay, so... the point is this, life with Charlie and a baby looking pretty good.<eos> Did you really think that this was gonna work?<eos> - Did you really think that...<eos> - Well you would just have me in here and you could just... hurl insults at me.<eos> - Huh?
Why are you so obsessed with me?<eos> I mean, you said it yourself, I'm a mess.<eos> So, why don't you just go find somebody better?<eos> Well... 'cause there is no one better.<eos> And...<eos> I love you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Those jerks are finally gone.<eos> Time to stretch out around here.<eos> Heyo.
Because I got a little pinched nerve in my neck.<eos> - It's driving me crazy.<eos> - Wh... yeah, I mind.<eos> I'm gonna go take a steam bath, so why don't you whip me up a bowl of that popcorn.<eos> That smells so good.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Frank!
Stop!<eos> Don't get all emotional, just do it.<eos> I don't want this.<eos> Okay.<eos> They're asleep.<eos> Dude, why did you say you wanted to raise the kid?<eos> I just got caught up in the moment, you know?<eos> It was so exciting.<eos> Maybe we should do it.<eos> W-we?
We are not a couple, Mac.<eos> Well, no, we would just keep pretending.<eos> I am not gonna pretend to be in a relationship with you for the entirety of my child's life.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Lo... okay, you know what?<eos> I can't handle this right now.<eos> I'm gonna go sleep in your room.<eos> You can sleep on the couch.<eos> Oh, no... w-w-wait, Dennis.<eos> Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.
I can't handle this right now.<eos> I'm gonna go sleep in your room.<eos> You can sleep on the couch.<eos> Oh, no... w-w-wait, Dennis.<eos> Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.<eos> Uh, hold on one second...<eos> I-I...<eos> What is this?<eos> This is the gym.<eos> Uh-huh.
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.<eos> Uh, hold on one second...<eos> I-I...<eos> What is this?<eos> This is the gym.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And where were you going to sleep?<eos> Well, I figured since we got so used to sleeping in the same bed at Dee's, that we could just sort of<eos> - continue that here.<eos> - Mm-hmm.
What is this?<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> - This?<eos> Oh, this just<eos> - Yeah.<eos> improves the chances of conception.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of getting pregnant.<eos> Oh.<eos> Right.

Right.<eos> Uh, the baby.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, you know, speaking of which, um,<eos> I think we're gonna need to make some changes around here.<eos> Oh.<eos> Like what?<eos> Um, well, I think you need to repaint, for starters.<eos> Wh-why would I do that?<eos> Charlie, this...
I hadn't thought about it, but you can stay here.<eos> - I mean, that's fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> When this baby comes out, though,<eos> Frank's gonna need to find us a nicer place to live.<eos> Oh, but I love this place.<eos> Okay, well, I don't, and it's no place to raise a child, so end of conversation.<eos> Whoa.

- Well, look...<eos> I'm carrying your child.<eos> - N-n-n-n-n-n-no. - Carrying my...<eos> I am not finished talking.<eos> Who's idea was this in the first place?<eos> Look, I'm just saying if you want to be a mom, you're gonna have to learn how to control your emotions.<eos> I need to control my emotions?<eos> Or I'm not gonna be a good mother?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Dee!

Come on, I need help here, all right?<eos> Look, I-I got to sleep, okay?<eos> I can't think straight.<eos> - I... ah, Christ... is he snoring?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Snoring's the worst.<eos> I'm gonna need to crash<eos> - next to you, all right?<eos> You know what?<eos> - What?
I'm gonna need to crash<eos> - next to you, all right?<eos> You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> Don't be a whore tonight, Dee, and try and bang me again, okay?<eos> Because I got nothing left.<eos> I'm spent; I'm really exhausted.<eos> Too much sex and too much... stuff.<eos> Just don't be a whore, okay?<eos> - Dee!

Look, don't be so emotional.<eos> You're being very emotional.<eos> Get up and get us an egg.<eos> I'm getting like calls up the wazoo from the waitress.<eos> She's asking for, like, groceries and shit.<eos> - I mean, who does that?<eos> - No.<eos> Who-who just barges into someone's apartment<eos> - and takes over?<eos> - Nobody.

She's calling me again!<eos> It's like she's totally stalking me.<eos> Dee, what do I do here?<eos> You have been stalking that woman for 15 years.<eos> Now she's finally showing you some attention, and you don't like it?<eos> Oh, Dee, you know what?<eos> Eggs.<eos> I didn't ask for your opinion.<eos> Yes, you did!<eos> Hey, oh, good, Dee.

Oh, yeah?<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Um, so, Mandy, um, we have brought you here, uh, to meet a gentleman.<eos> - Um, I just feel really<eos> - Oh.<eos> badly now being able to provide emotionally for you, so I thought we could set you up with somebody who can provide for you both emotionally and financially.<eos> Um, so we are here to meet a millionaire.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah.
Yeah.<eos> No, I know.<eos> It's, a, it's a little str...<eos> Oh, oh...<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Let's do this.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, Frank, where's the, uh, millionaire?<eos> I am the millionaire, I'm the guy.<eos> - What?
Five grand is a lot of money...<eos> is that offer just out on the table?<eos> - I'm not gonna bang you.<eos> - I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,<eos> - but I'll power through for five grand. - Well, no, you wouldn't want to, because you're emotionally involved with me.<eos> Aw.<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry, Dennis.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Dennis?

Well, that was a disaster.<eos> Frank almost ruined everything.<eos> Okay, do you want me to go down to the car and talk to her?<eos> And spin more perverted tales about me?<eos> Why am I a gimp?<eos> Oh, God, just get your kid and get out of here, Dennis.<eos> Yeah, I'll get the kid, but I got to come back because I need to crash here tonight.<eos> I'm not sleeping next to Mac's dildo bike again.<eos> What?<eos> No, me too.
- Over here.<eos> Over here.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Go, go, go, go, go, go. - What... where... what is-what is going on here?<eos> I thought-I thought we were gonna go see the Liberty Bell.<eos> There's no time for that, there's no time.<eos> What... what is going on here, Brian?<eos> All right, listen to me, because we only have a few minutes before they realize they can't hear or see us back here.<eos> What?<eos> Who?
Run!<eos> Oh, it's killing me.<eos> Run, Mandy, no.<eos> You... you have to run and not ever look back.<eos> Or contact me ever again.<eos> And you'll never get any money or assets from me because if you do, it'll be unsafe for you.<eos> Run!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - They got Dennis.<eos> - Dane.

Not a regular hospital, though, 'cause technically,<eos> - he's not supposed to exist. - A bad guy one.<eos> Oh, no, I've lost my lover.<eos> I'll need a new gimp!<eos> I'm not his lover.<eos> Never had sex.<eos> Not a gimp.<eos> Oh, run, Mandy.<eos> Oh.<eos> Good-bye.

Come on.<eos> You can open your eyes now, I know you're not dead.<eos> Ah, geez.<eos> You big city folks sure like to complicate things, don't ya?<eos> Look, all I wanted was for Brian Jr.<eos> to have a father, but we don't want to be with a man who doesn't want to be with us.<eos> So, I guess we'll just... be getting back to North Dakota now.<eos> Okay, now, you want to come on up here and say good-bye to Brian Jr.?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.
Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Um... good-bye and, um... you know, you be... you be good to your mom and, uh...<eos> - Okay, you all done?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.

Whoever the heck you are. ♪ What you gonna do when you get out of jail? ♪<eos> I can't do this.<eos> What are you talking about, bud?<eos> The plan worked.<eos> No, this... no, this-this is crazy.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> I can't...<eos> I-I can't...<eos> - I can't do any of this shit anymore.<eos> - What?
Okay, you know what?<eos> I... this is nuts.<eos> I got to...<eos> I just got to go.<eos> It's done.<eos> It's done, guys.<eos> Good-bye, Paddy's Pub.<eos> Good-bye, Philadelphia.<eos> Good-bye, Charlie.<eos> Mac, Dee, Frank.
Oh, good-bye.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I can't believe he's actually gone.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> Well, now what?
Why don't we just eliminate him?<eos> John Wick... is a man of focus... commitment... and sheer fucking will.<eos> He once killed three men in a bar...<eos> With a pencil.<eos> I know. I've heard the story.<eos> With a fucking pencil!<eos> Who the fuck can do that?<eos> Well, I can assure you... that the stories you hear about this man, if nothing else... has been watered down.<eos> Mr. Wick.<eos> Hey, buddy.

What do you think?<eos> Well, your motor's about to fall out and... the chassis' all bent up, the driveshaft is all destroyed.<eos> And I don't know if you noticed, but you got a crack in your windshield.<eos> I mean, what do I think?<eos> I could fix this.<eos> Thanks for finding her.<eos> Not a problem, man. I just made a few calls. No big deal.<eos> Let me know when it's fixed. All right.<eos> It'll be ready Christmas... 2030.<eos> Ciao, John.

I have no choice?<eos> You dishonor the marker, you die.<eos> You kill the holder of the marker, you die.<eos> You run, you die.<eos> This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.<eos> Do what the man asks.<eos> Be free.<eos> Then, if you want to go after him, burn his house down, be my guest.<eos> But until then...<eos> Rules.

Yet you know you cannot, can you?<eos> I told you, I needed that guy, the way you are looking at me right now.<eos> I needed the Boogeyman.<eos> I needed John Wick.<eos> Just... tell me what you want.<eos> I want you to kill my sister.<eos> Why?<eos> There are 12 seats at the High Table.<eos> Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.<eos> The Chinese, the Russian.
She's in Rome, for her coronation.<eos> You will take the catacombs in...<eos> It doesn't matter where she is.<eos> That's why I need the ghost, lo spettro John Wick.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> Do this for me, and your marker is honored.<eos> What say you?<eos> Never one to waste words.<eos> 59, 0, 3.5.<eos> Jonathan!

I fail to recall the last time you were in Rome.<eos> And here I'd heard, you had retired.<eos> I had.<eos> Then humor me with... but one question.<eos> No.<eos> All right, then.<eos> One of our finest rooms.<eos> Grazie.<eos> Enjoy your stay.<eos> Mr. Wick.
I have never known him not to be.<eos> Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> I'd like a tasting.<eos> I am quite excited to show you something.<eos> Buongiorno, Signor Wick.<eos> Welcome back to Rome.<eos> I am.<eos> I know of your past fondness for the German varietals, but I can wholeheartedly endorse the new breed of Austrians.<eos> Glock .34 and .26.
Social.<eos> And is this for day or evening?<eos> I need one for day and one for night.<eos> Recontoured grips.<eos> Flared magwell for easier reloads.<eos> And I know you'll appreciate the custom porting.<eos> What's next?<eos> I need something robust.<eos> Precise.<eos> Robust.

There are one, two, three gates.<eos> Silicon carbide discs.<eos> Ceramic matrices.<eos> Accompanying laminates. Cutting-edge body armor.<eos> We just sew it between the fabric and the lining.<eos> Zero penetration. However... quite painful, I'm afraid.<eos> Could you recommend anything for the end of the night?<eos> Something big, bold.<eos> May I suggest the Benelli M4?<eos> Custom bolt, carrier release and charging handle.

Those among your own came to us with these territories.<eos> A knife was pressed to their throats. Semantics.<eos> Besides...<eos> That blade you speak of was meant for their children.<eos> They were only meant to watch.<eos> What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.<eos> Now go.<eos> Enjoy the party.<eos> Have some fun.<eos> John.

What would your Helen think about that, John?<eos> What would your Helen think about you?<eos> Why?<eos> I lived my life my way. And I'll die my way.<eos> Do you fear damnation, John?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, I always thought I could escape it.<eos> That I'd see it coming.<eos> That I'd see you.<eos> John?

You know how it goes.<eos> I'll make it quick.<eos> I promise.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I'll try and do the same.<eos> This round's on me.<eos> Consider it a professional courtesy.<eos> No.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hello, John.

You pull it out, you will bleed, and you will die.<eos> Consider this a professional courtesy.<eos> We see things, we see things.<eos> The things you see are nightmares, man.<eos> Take me to him.<eos> Tell him it's John Wick.<eos> You know, they just... they put it in everything!<eos> Hey, man.

Oh, yeah?

Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.<eos> The marker is complete, John.<eos> You should have just run away.<eos> You know what the Camorra will do to you.<eos> You think you're Old Testament?<eos> No John.<eos> Killing me won't stop the contract.<eos> Killing me, will make it so much worse.<eos> John.
John.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you are addicted to it.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> No wife. No life. No home.<eos> Vengeance... it's all you have.<eos> You wanted me back.<eos> I'm back.<eos> You are now exiting Reflections of the Soul, at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Good evening.

All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you, its privileges, sir.<eos> I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.<eos> He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.<eos> Duck fat.<eos> Makes all the difference.<eos> Jonathan.<eos> Have you seen the menu here?<eos> Lot of options.
How was he?<eos> He was a good dog.<eos> I have enjoyed his company.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Mr. Wick?<eos> If you would be so inclined.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Jonathan.

It's like a hot dog with a belt on it.<eos> You are so mean.<eos> Mrs. Stella?<eos> Miss Stella? I'm afraid I have some bad news.<eos> There's been an accident.<eos> You did great today.<eos> You call me if you need anything.<eos> Mrs. Stella? What do you want us to do with all the food?<eos> - How much is left?<eos> - Half.
- I'm not an art dealer.<eos> - No, but it's worth $2 million.<eos> If I showed you the appraisal with a promise to sell, would that help?<eos> $2 million would definitely feed the wolves, yes, for sure, it would.<eos> No, no!<eos> Oh, my god! Oh, my god!<eos> No, no!<eos> What did you do? ! What did you do?<eos> This is 10 karats, how much time does that buy me?<eos> Not enough, honey.
- I know and it's awful, but that's the way things are, the law won't allow it.<eos> I have done what other people have told me to do my entire life.<eos> Can you give me a hand?<eos> I told you, ma'am, I've no interest in breaking any laws.<eos> You know what, that's enough with the ma'am stuff, my name is Stella, okay?<eos> And I, Stella, would love your help.<eos> Please, okay? I won't turn you in, okay?<eos> Thanks for nothing, cowboy.<eos> Coming?<eos> Now what?
Look, if you can get the department of corrections to approve you for the prep program, you got my blessing.<eos> I am already through half my feed budget and it ain't even may.<eos> Asking for more money from congress is like trying to squeeze apple juice from an orange.<eos> Okay, it's only 14 horses, but every little bit counts, but I need documentation.<eos> Progress reports, veterinary records created on each animal. - Will do.<eos> - This has got to be done right, okay?<eos> Just in case some nut comes out of the woodwork and they're there, let me tell you.<eos> So does this mean that we can feed and water the horses?<eos> It means I'll look the other way, because I'm pretty sure that toothpaste is already out of the tube.<eos> Good luck, miss.
Let's just hope this is the last time we talk.<eos> Done, now what?<eos> Now we get in touch with the prison.<eos> Well, how much are they gonna provide?<eos> Not much, but enough to keep the lights on and the water on.<eos> If we pull this off, we might convince the breeders that we know what we're doing.<eos> Let's just take it one step at a time.<eos> Aren't we gonna just call the prison?<eos> That is a conversation better i go have myself in person.<eos> Oh. Good.
That's our objective, miss Davis, not saving your ass.<eos> All right, well, the good news, miss Davis, is you've got a prep graduate right here running the show and he cared enough to call in a big favor for ya, so...<eos> You implement all these security measures and I will see what i can do about freeing up the state funds for you as fast as I can, okay?<eos> - Good seeing you, holt. - You too, buddy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How am I supposed to pay for all this stuff and the staff?<eos> No, just wait.<eos> Not this one.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey, there. - Hey.
You should buy everybody a nice dinner.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Think your friend's here to help?<eos> Doesn't look like it, does it?<eos> Matter of fact, the Hutchins had their eyes on this property for some time now.<eos> I hear they want to build condos.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But I'll try.<eos> - She's just...<eos> - Weak.

Well, let me walk you through these guys.<eos> Jon kilpatrick, five years for grand larceny.<eos> Six-time loser at the end of his sentence.<eos> He does well here, he'll get a parole hearing, but, Scottish sob, real hot head.<eos> He's gonna be the Alpha here, so...<eos> Keep an eye on him.<eos> Carlos Gonzales, failure to pay child support, tax evasion, possession of illegal firearms.<eos> Dave Sullivan, six years for vehicular homicide.<eos> You get three words out of him in the next three months, that'll be an earful.<eos> Matt barker.
If this program was built for anyone, it's him.<eos> That's your team.<eos> They behave, they do what you want, they will accelerate their parole hearings!<eos> They step out of line and there are plenty of volunteers happy to take their place.<eos> Miss Davis, I need you to sign here to release your funds.<eos> Bus will be back at 5pm sharp, take them back to home sweet home.<eos> Welcome to the prep program, miss Davis.<eos> Bratt, they're all yours.<eos> - Thanks for doing this, holt.<eos> - Good luck.
Welcome to the prep program, miss Davis.<eos> Bratt, they're all yours.<eos> - Thanks for doing this, holt.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Gentlemen, get ready to be kicked, bitten and bucked off.<eos> The most important lesson you can learn here is Patience.<eos> These are wild animals, they've never interacted with humans before, so you're going to have to earn their trust and respect.<eos> You're gonna be handling them, training them.<eos> You are not listening to me, Irish!<eos> Scottish.
Honey, it's as bad as what daddy did.<eos> They're hurting the animals.<eos> All right, we got 90 days to get this horse tame enough that someone will buy it.<eos> If you get impatient or rough with this mustang, mustang's gonna come out on top.<eos> Just like you and chopper in the shower, cupcake.<eos> Hey, man, get me out of here. Why I gotta go first, man?<eos> Take a breath and focus on the horse, he's more scared then you are.<eos> He's never seen a human before.<eos> Go on over there and try and touch him gentle on the muzzle with the back of your hand.<eos> Just like chopper.
If you can't get your hands on that horse, how are you gonna saddle him?<eos> How am I supposed to get my hand on him,<eos> - if he keeps running around like that? - Talk to him, calm him. Talk to him?<eos> Shit, and say what?<eos> Just like chopper.<eos> Not another word out of you, Irish!<eos> What you want me to say to him?<eos> Think of the first nice thing someone said to you when you went to prison. Say that.<eos> Go on.<eos> Hey, bro, hey...
How does it feel to touch a wild animal?<eos> Aw, it's so sweet.<eos> All right, that is enough out of you, Irish!<eos> It's Scottish, you arse.<eos> Whoa! I don't have time for your bullshit!<eos> If you're not gonna be a help, you're gone!<eos> It takes one phone call!<eos> I'm sorry, miss Stella, i was just joking.<eos> It won't happen again, i promise.<eos> Nice job in there.
Think you got another monarch in the bunch?<eos> - Oh, no, he's one of a kind.<eos> - Sure is.<eos> Hay is delivered Tuesday mornings, miss Stella.<eos> Hey, thank you, Walt.<eos> Sounds like you could use some glucosamine.<eos> Those mustangs can be predisposed to arthritis and joint pain and glucosamine can reverse all that.<eos> Yeah, I have a sanctuary for them, kind of the love of my life.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Meredith parish.

Wow.<eos> Stella Davis.
Glucosamine is pretty powerful stuff.<eos> My horses don't look anything like this.<eos> Nobody takes care of them like I do.<eos> They don't lie, they don't betray and when you love them, they love you right back.<eos> Gotta protect that.<eos> That's what I'm trying to do.<eos> Hey, why don't we grab lunch?<eos> That's my cell phone.<eos> Yeah, sometime later in the week. - Markent's, noonish?<eos> - Sure, yeah. Okay.
Oh, Mrs. Meredith parish bought these. Meredith, of course.<eos> Who is she?<eos> What does she want?<eos> She thinks all horses should be left to run free in the wild and she'll take on anybody she thinks is interfering with that.<eos> Me?<eos> If she thinks you're hurting them.<eos> Look here, that's a pocket of puss.<eos> This fella's got strangles, a glandular bacterial infection.<eos> It's contagious and rampant.<eos> No, George b...
Exaggerations propagated by the ranchers.<eos> The New York times, science news, why would they lie?<eos> Because they sell ad space to the ranchers who don't want to share the grazing land that they have, because it'll lower profit margins.<eos> Exploiting defenseless animals is irrefutably wicked.<eos> I am here to protect them at any cost.<eos> So, if you don't stop what you're doing, I will make an example out of you.<eos> Don't get timid with this horse, Irish, you do, he's gonna eat your lunch.<eos> If you get bucked off, and everybody does, roll with the throw and you keep on rolling until you're out of the way.<eos> All right, boss, let me go to work.<eos> Good luck.

Come on, let's get you up.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Maybe you wanna take a minute between rounds, huh?<eos> Nah, nah, nah.<eos> All right, let's get on up out of here.<eos> - I'm gonna call you buster.<eos> - 'Cause he busted your ass?<eos> No. Buster Douglas was the first guy to knockout Mike Tyson.<eos> Right, buster?

Doing good.<eos> Pay attention to the horse.<eos> - Easy, easy. - Wait! Wait!<eos> - Hey, debrickshaw, stop!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - I got him, boss.<eos> We're tryin' to do somethin' and then y'all getting us hurt!<eos> You try getting your ass in there with them horses!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Ho, ho! Equine slavery...
Why don't you go clean out a stall.<eos> Go on, let's go.<eos> That was good of you to do, Jon.<eos> - What happened to Irish?<eos> - Thought you were Scottish.<eos> - You alright, kid?<eos> We're about done here.<eos> I think you guys should head out back.<eos> We've had enough fireworks for the day.<eos> Hell of a day.
Yeah...<eos> Go get the horses, monarch first!<eos> Turn this bus around, boss!<eos> We can't change the plans unless we're told.<eos> Boss, there's a fire! - Gotta turn this bus around!<eos> - Sit down!<eos> You gotta do the right thing here.<eos> Let us out so we can help!<eos> Stop the bus.<eos> Junior!
We are helping them.<eos> - You set it on fire?<eos> - Screw you, old man.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> I just told you, i didn't set that fire.<eos> Hey, get off of him! Get off!<eos> Water! Octavia!<eos> - Right now!<eos> - Okay!<eos> Buster! - Buster!
Debrickshaw was the last person in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice, Sullivan.<eos> Look alive, look alive. Here it is, here it is, it's coming, oh god!<eos> Get back so they can get in.<eos> Yeah! There they are!<eos> Get up on the fence, get back so they can get in.<eos> That's what we're here for, people! That's what we're here...<eos> Bussey's here!<eos> Colton!
Well, that's just about enough of that, isn't it?<eos> So let's get back to it, shall we?<eos> And, ladies, let's bring on the food and the booze!<eos> And let let's kick up the band, 'cause we all know why we're here, it's giving season!<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Meredith says we need to recommit.<eos> Are you gonna chicken out?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Ready?
You get this one, I'll go after the other.<eos> Don't come up here, Stella.<eos> You don't want to see this.<eos> Howdy, folks!<eos> All of you here for the horse auction, come on in.<eos> Sale's about to begin.<eos> All in?<eos> All done?<eos> Sold the horse 45,000 by 193.<eos> 45,000.
The truth is, this majestic animal needs our help.<eos> Overpopulation, drought and other factors are leaving thousands of them left to die out in the plains.<eos> Some of you may have heard that headline on a blog or something.<eos> But I've seen the real thing.<eos> And that....<eos> That's as close as 25 miles from right here.<eos> Don't come up here, Stella.<eos> You don't want to see this.<eos> Are they all gonna end up like this?<eos> Yep, most likely.
- Thanks.<eos> You've got a great horse here in old buster.<eos> He'll do it for you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last of the double diamond horses!<eos> They love us!<eos> No, man, they love our horses.<eos> Uh, yeah, right. Us and our horses.<eos> I think we're off to a start.<eos> Turns out I'm pretty good with horses.<eos> Yeah, pretty good.

You know, maybe I'll just check and see if the hens...<eos> Oh, everything's fine, no, go see your son.<eos> You're a good man, bratt.<eos> Your son's gonna love you.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I hope so.<eos> - See you Monday.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> I told you to call me bratt.<eos> Bratt.

Right, right?<eos> - I'm not thinking that at all. - Yeah, yeah, well, it's an issue of aerodynamics, really.<eos> You see, every second counts in the water park.<eos> - Right.

No, it's just squeezing me further into the stuck!<eos> Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off.<eos> - Just rip it off.<eos> - Dee, I'm trying.<eos> I can't get any actual leverage on it.<eos> Besides, it's triple-laminated.<eos> - It's not just gonna rip.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - I think someone peed.<eos> - What?

Come here.<eos> Before you go, no matter how alluring it is, do not put your genitals or your butthole near the pool drain.<eos> You got it?<eos> - In fact, cover your butthole.<eos> - Okay, go.<eos> - Okay, kid.<eos> Go, kid, go! - Come on.<eos> Go.<eos> Cover that butthole, kid!<eos> Mac.
That kid looks passed out, Dee.<eos> Yeah, he's out cold, but I think I can maneuver his body pretty easily.<eos> Yeah, but if we send him down there, he might drown.<eos> Guys, I gotta take a poop.<eos> - I see you stealing.<eos> - I wasn't stealing them!<eos> I just forgot I was wearing them!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> My dad's a cop!<eos> Abigail!
- I see you stealing.<eos> - I wasn't stealing them!<eos> I just forgot I was wearing them!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> My dad's a cop!<eos> Abigail!<eos> What is going on in here?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been worried sick about you.<eos> - This your daughter?
I just forgot I was wearing them!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> My dad's a cop!<eos> Abigail!<eos> What is going on in here?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been worried sick about you.<eos> - This your daughter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Officer Dennis Reynolds.
- Yes.<eos> Officer Dennis Reynolds.<eos> Hi.<eos> Off-duty, of course.<eos> This is your jurisdiction.<eos> - Look, I caught her stealing sunglasses.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - No, I didn't!<eos> I was just...<eos> - Abigail,
- This little girl, she's gonna be grounded for a month.<eos> Come on, Abigail, let's go.<eos> Try to touch me, and I'll scream "rape."<eos> Please.<eos> I see the road you're headed down:<eos> the lying, the stealing, all of it.<eos> And as somebody who's been down that road, let me tell you something:<eos> you've got real talent.<eos> Okay...<eos> Mmm.
- Hey, man, go through.<eos> Hey, go for it, go, go, go!<eos> No, you need a raft!<eos> You need a raft!<eos> - Ah!<eos> Ah!<eos> - Ow!<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - My camera!
Hey, go for it, go, go, go!<eos> No, you need a raft!<eos> You need a raft!<eos> - Ah!<eos> Ah!<eos> - Ow!<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - My camera!<eos> - Oh, great, your camera.
- Ow!<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - My camera!<eos> - Oh, great, your camera.<eos> I was really worried about that.<eos> This is my watch.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - My sunglasses.
This is my watch.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - My sunglasses.<eos> - Oh, all of our chains!<eos> You know how hard it is to get all of our chains.<eos> - AIDS... - AIDS, AIDS!<eos> Ow!<eos> Stop sending kids, nerd!<eos> - You goddamn nerd!
- We're doin' it, Charlie.<eos> We're pretty much... we're pretty much caught up. Whoa, hey, hey, guys!<eos> What are you guys doing?<eos> You guys doing a AIDS thing?<eos> - Oh, yeah!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I gave Frank a couple hickeys<eos> - to sell the lesions.<eos> - Sucked on 'em.<eos> Yeah, yeah.
You doing a fake daughter thing?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Cool.<eos> All right, man, see ya.<eos> See ya.<eos> Three, two, one, go!<eos> I got AIDS!<eos> Yeah!<eos> - Frank, we did it, man!<eos> - Charlie!

- Excuse me, ma'am?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What is this ride over here?<eos> Oh, that's our new slide.<eos> It's, uh, Thunder Gun Express.<eos> We just finished construction.<eos> It'll be open in a few weeks.<eos> - A Thunder Gun ride?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Like the movie?
It's totally dry.<eos> - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's not, it's not... no, but it's not, it's, it's not open yet.<eos> It's Thunder Gun, man.<eos> No hesitation.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - No surrender.<eos> No man left behind.<eos> We got to get to the top of that slide.<eos> And raw-dog the shit out of it!<eos> - Mac?
No man left behind.<eos> We got to get to the top of that slide.<eos> And raw-dog the shit out of it!<eos> - Mac?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> My vial is blood red.<eos> That's because the water's not even running through anymore.<eos> It's just pooling up.<eos> - Well, I got to tell you something, though, I...<eos> - Huh?

The problem is it's already happening.<eos> I'm peeing on your shoulder right now.<eos> But I don't mean to, I'm sorry.<eos> - It's warm. - You bitch!<eos> When we get out of here, I'm gonna kill you!<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> How are you even holding your pee?<eos> We've been stuck in here forever!<eos> Oh, I peed as soon as we got in the slide.<eos> - Me, too.

Of course they are!<eos> I think they're actually enjoying this shit!<eos> Oh, they love every second of it!<eos> - They're just pissing all over us!<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> We're gonna die in here with them!<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait a second, Dee.<eos> - I've got an idea!<eos> - What?
Wait a second, Dee.<eos> - I've got an idea!<eos> - What?<eos> If we can get Sherman's mouth to this bracelet, we can get out of here.<eos> You said you couldn't rip through it.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> But Sherman can chew through it!<eos> Like the girl in the pool drain when she got her anus stuck, she chewed through her prolapsed anus and chewed herself to freedom.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> ! - Sherman!
But Sherman can chew through it!<eos> Like the girl in the pool drain when she got her anus stuck, she chewed through her prolapsed anus and chewed herself to freedom.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> ! - Sherman!<eos> Get your mouth to this bracelet and chew!<eos> Aw, screw it.<eos> Try it.<eos> Chew like you've never chewed before.<eos> Go, Sherman, chew!<eos> Whoa!

If you were born in China, you'd be the head of some factory by now.<eos> Or they would've thrown you in a river, 'cause you weren't a boy.<eos> All right, it's not a great analogy, but you get my point.<eos> A-Abby... you deserve better.<eos> Here, I... I want you to have it.<eos> No, what do you mean?<eos> You earned that.<eos> No, please, take it.<eos> So you never forget me.<eos> Thanks, Dennis.

Is that Abby's brother?<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> The girl that was just...<eos> Please take it.<eos> So you never forget me.<eos> See, an artist takes whatever he wants when somebody's looking right at him.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Why are you...?<eos> Huh.
See, an artist takes whatever he wants when somebody's looking right at him.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Why are you...?<eos> Huh.<eos> How would you even describe something like that?<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> They should've sent a poet.<eos> - All right, let's go, let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right, all right.

Oh, oh.<eos> All right.<eos> This should be good, right?<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> - That'll do it.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Who's going first?<eos> Well, it should be you, right?<eos> I mean, you pulled off the AIDS thing.<eos> Oh, Charlie!

- Ready, Frankie!<eos> - I won't let you down! - All right!<eos> - I like the spirit here.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Oh, it burns!<eos> It burns!<eos> It burns!<eos> It burns!<eos> Aah!<eos> My back!
- Oh!<eos> Oh, it burns!<eos> It burns!<eos> It burns!<eos> It burns!<eos> Aah!<eos> My back!<eos> That guy has AIDS!<eos> Aah!<eos> Aah, my back!
We're free!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Ah, we're free!<eos> My God!<eos> Is that blood?<eos> There's AIDS blood in the pool!<eos> That's goddamn AIDS blood?<eos> !<eos> Has anyone seen my son?<eos> Goddamn it!
No, your mom is the monster, all right?<eos> My mom is the sweet one.<eos> Oh, the sweet one?
My mom has a great relationship with me.<eos> - She never calls you!<eos> - She calls me all the time!<eos> - Yes, she does!<eos> - But I have proof, anyway.<eos> I have proof.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I got this in the mail.<eos> Is that, like, a ransom note from Mac's mom?<eos> Huh?
Oh, it's not a...<eos> it's not a ransom note.<eos> This is just how she writes notes to me.<eos> That-that's like a bunch of gibberish, Charlie.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Is that a hieroglyph of a dog?<eos> Yeah, that's the animal my mom fears the most, right?<eos> She-she feels trapped inside her own home.<eos> There is no way you could get that from this.<eos> Oh-oh, okay, guys, guys, guys.
It's not like they're gonna get exploited in any way, right?<eos> No, no, no, exactly. I think once we have a look at what's going on in there, we might find the situation to be, uh, pretty comical. Oh, it's so nice of you to bring us all these lovely gifts, Charlie.<eos> The plant, the globe, and the little teddy bear.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom.<eos> No, we aren't gonna touch the gifts, right?<eos> Okay, we don't touch them.<eos> We just, we look at them.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And they look back at you and they...<eos> Hands off.
Hands off.<eos> Mom, make sure you don't water this plant.<eos> - Your mom's not gonna water the plants.<eos> - Oh.<eos> She has a very nurturing nature.<eos> She would...<eos> Oh, Mrs. Mac, are you gonna water the plants?<eos> - See. - Oh, Charlie.<eos> I'm so glad to see you.<eos> - Yeah, okay.
You're gonna steal my question.<eos> Ow!<eos> Mom, what happened?<eos> She poured hot soup on me!<eos> I was adjusting my undercarriage, and I accidentally spilled it.<eos> - She poured hot soup on her, dude.<eos> - She was adjusting<eos> - her undercar...<eos> Wait a second.<eos> - What...
She poured hot soup on me!<eos> I was adjusting my undercarriage, and I accidentally spilled it.<eos> - She poured hot soup on her, dude.<eos> - She was adjusting<eos> - her undercar...<eos> Wait a second.<eos> - What...<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> We-we could also get some soup.<eos> No, the-the video.
- What...<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> We-we could also get some soup.<eos> No, the-the video.<eos> We can go back and watch the video<eos> - and see what actually happened.<eos> - Oh, we can watch and see...<eos> Yes.<eos> Gentleman, welcome to your moms.<eos> Wow, man.
'Cause I'd like to see if-if his mom poured on my ma on purpose.<eos> Oh, she definitely did pour it.<eos> And she definitely did it on purpose.<eos> There you go.<eos> She's abusing my mom, man.<eos> It's clear as day, but what's really interesting is what seems to be happening right here in the live feed.<eos> Oh.<eos> You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. - Huh.<eos> - Uh... what the hell, man?
And she definitely did it on purpose.<eos> There you go.<eos> She's abusing my mom, man.<eos> It's clear as day, but what's really interesting is what seems to be happening right here in the live feed.<eos> Oh.<eos> You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. - Huh.<eos> - Uh... what the hell, man?<eos> - That's your mom abusing my mom!<eos> - Well...
No, it's not!<eos> That's just one of those things, you know,<eos> - like where...<eos> - What thing?<eos> You know, where you're just like, you're like, it's like a "Why, I oughta," but, you know, it's no big deal.<eos> - Why, I oughta what?<eos> - Why, I oughta bludgeon you with a hammer.<eos> But she's not actually gonna do it, you know?<eos> It's like how Ralph Kramden on The Honeymooners would always say, "Why, I oughta." He was threatening to beat his wife.<eos> - Uh, yeah. - Yeah.
- Uh, yeah. - Yeah.<eos> You know?<eos> I mean, it's-it's funny<eos> - 'cause he's not actually gonna do it,<eos> - That was funny. Yeah. even though the threat is always there.<eos> - Yeah, he might...<eos> - Yeah, he might cave her face in,<eos> - but he won't. He won't.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, he might...<eos> - Yeah, he might cave her face in,<eos> - but he won't. He won't.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> But he's not gonna, you know?<eos> - That's...<eos> - Yeah, b... Well, that's funny.<eos> But in this circumstance, it's not funny because it's my mom!<eos> Right, right.
But in this circumstance, it's not funny because it's my mom!<eos> Right, right.<eos> Wait, actually, you know what, we-we don't really know for sure whether it's funny or not.<eos> You know, let-let me try something here.<eos> Let me just...<eos> You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. Hmm.<eos> Well, what-what is that?<eos> Well, I don't know, you made me think of, like, sitcoms,<eos> The Honeymooners.
The Honeymooners.<eos> I just thought, "This isn't very funny."<eos> But if I add a laugh track, maybe, I don't know.<eos> But it's not a show.<eos> This is their lives.<eos> Yeah, but it-it does kind of lighten it up for me.<eos> Well, yeah, it did lighten it.<eos> But I'm not saying it...<eos> Can... can you play it again without the laugh track?<eos> Yeah, sure.
This is their lives.<eos> Yeah, but it-it does kind of lighten it up for me.<eos> Well, yeah, it did lighten it.<eos> But I'm not saying it...<eos> Can... can you play it again without the laugh track?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. - See, that goes right back to super dark.<eos> - It's a bummer without it, isn't it?<eos> let me just try it again with the, uh...<eos> - Yeah, no.
Well, I'll sleep you. - See, that goes right back to super dark.<eos> - It's a bummer without it, isn't it?<eos> let me just try it again with the, uh...<eos> - Yeah, no.<eos> Yeah, but let me...<eos> You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. - That's funny.<eos> That's funny!<eos> - I mean...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you. - That's funny.<eos> That's funny!<eos> - I mean...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> It's weird, because the situation really isn't funny,<eos> - and you add a laugh track... - I know, but the laughing tells me that it's funny.<eos> They have timing, man.<eos> - They have timing, for sure.<eos> Yeah.
I don't understand.<eos> Is this a dark situation or a comical one?<eos> Well, we-we don't really know yet, Mac.<eos> We don't know.<eos> But...<eos> I tell you what, why don't we stick around back here for a little while.<eos> Let's watch how this whole thing plays out.<eos> I'll keep sweetening the situation as it calls for it, and you might as well stick around.<eos> Did you just ash in my tapioca?<eos> Mm-hmm. - Yeah.
Let's watch how this whole thing plays out.<eos> I'll keep sweetening the situation as it calls for it, and you might as well stick around.<eos> Did you just ash in my tapioca?<eos> Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> I like that.<eos> - This is gold.<eos> - They got something, man.<eos> Like...<eos> Uh-huh.
- They got something, man.<eos> Like...<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> - It's really working.<eos> I don't know what this is, but...<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Oh, check it out.<eos> Mrs. Mac and Mrs. Kelly have a classic comedic rivalry.<eos> I mean, they're going at it like the greats.<eos> Like Abbott and Costello, Tom and Jerry.
Uh-huh.<eos> - It's really working.<eos> I don't know what this is, but...<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Oh, check it out.<eos> Mrs. Mac and Mrs. Kelly have a classic comedic rivalry.<eos> I mean, they're going at it like the greats.<eos> Like Abbott and Costello, Tom and Jerry.<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> - Huh.

Fly.<eos> Buzz off! All right, well, you know, if you guys are looking for a comedy troupe that beats the shit out of each other for laughs, there's nobody better than the Three Stooges.<eos> Put me on the show.<eos> - Whoa.
- Yeah.<eos> 'Cause I'm so much funnier than these two.<eos> Look at them, they're just smashing each other with stuff.<eos> I could add a whole, like, physical comedy element, you know?<eos> Hey, I smell chips.<eos> What are we watching?<eos> We're not really watching anything, yet.<eos> Until Big Funny shows up.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Ooh.
Catch me up. W-what did I miss?<eos> Uh, well, the grunty one, physically abuses the shrill one.<eos> And the shrill one psychologically abuses the grunty one.<eos> And it really plays.<eos> It's really funny,<eos> And, you know what, uh, actually,<eos> I-I'm gonna try something here, guys.<eos> You are a horrible woman, and I can't wait until those cigarettes kill you.<eos> And I shall dance on your grave.<eos> Yeah.
I love that.<eos> And the music that I added makes you - you know that it's light.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's also helping me realize that I think the situation's okay o-over there, you know?<eos> And-and, honestly, I'm gonna ignore my mom's note, like I ignore her phone calls.<eos> I think we're good here.<eos> They have chemistry.<eos> And I really love how playful and fun my mom's coming off.<eos> - Well.<eos> - Uh, no.

- What's up?<eos> My mom's trying to call me.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know what?<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> - Oh, no, I never would.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> But let's let that play out.<eos> Camera one.
My mom's trying to call me.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know what?<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> - Oh, no, I never would.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> But let's let that play out.<eos> Camera one.<eos> Oh, Charlie.
Charlie, where are you?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Oh.<eos> God, it's me, Bonnie.<eos> I'm so worried about my Charlie boy.<eos> Please don't have him be in a ditch somewhere, or squished between two trains, and his body mangled, so if they move the trains, all his guts and bodily fluids and organs spill out.<eos> Please, God... don't have him die. Aw.<eos> I knew it.<eos> She's a star.<eos> - Huh.

Aw.<eos> I knew it.<eos> She's a star.<eos> - Huh.<eos> - Charlie.
Do you want me to go on and on, or...<eos> No, that's...<eos> We're good.<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Sort of brighten you up a little bit.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Lipstick.
We're good.<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Sort of brighten you up a little bit.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Lipstick.<eos> "Heartbreaker."<eos> Just like you.
That's good... buzz off.<eos> You know, that's like, uh, a call back, which could become a catchphrase.<eos> You should probably think of a few more so you're not just too one-note.<eos> What about, um,<eos> "I can't even."<eos> Or, "That went well."<eos> I'm gonna take a shit.<eos> That's not a good catchphrase.<eos> It is healthy, though.<eos> Oh...
Will you look at that?<eos> I've got my dumb head stuck in the banister.<eos> - Dee's a nightmare, dude.<eos> - It's awful.<eos> You're not gonna try and put a laugh in, or...<eos> Uh, nowhere to put it.<eos> Yeah, you can't tell where the jokes<eos> - are supposed to be.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Whoops.
- It's awful.<eos> You're not gonna try and put a laugh in, or...<eos> Uh, nowhere to put it.<eos> Yeah, you can't tell where the jokes<eos> - are supposed to be.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's actually a little bit stuck...<eos> Mac?
Okay.<eos> It's actually a little bit stuck...<eos> Mac?<eos> Mac, you want to come pull on me?<eos> Dee, I-I don't know what you're doing, because n-none of this is playing, and you're not funny at all and...<eos> Hey, you know what, Dee?<eos> From here, what you're doing actually is kind of funny.<eos> I wish we could get Mac out of there.<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> - Terrible.
Mrs. Kelly, can you please help me out?<eos> Uh, my head is really stuck.<eos> Um, I don't do well with emergencies, and I have to answer the door. - Hi, Jack.<eos> - Hi, Bonnie.<eos> Just stopping by to pick up that hard drive I accidentally left under the floorboards.<eos> - Oh, come on in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Man, what is Uncle Jack doing there?<eos> - He's awful.<eos> - Yeah, so creepy.
- Yeah, so creepy.<eos> He's gonna ruin the show.<eos> Yeah, that creepy pedophile vibe he's got going on is going to be a tough sell.<eos> You know, even in Europe.<eos> Uh, let me try something here.<eos> Let me take that jacket. Ooh!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mm. Aw.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> That's funny from over here.<eos> Yeah, yeah, just give me a good push on...<eos> W-what are you doing?<eos> Wh-what, that fart?<eos> I'm just trying some new stuff.<eos> No, n-n-not the fart, no.<eos> - The fart's good.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm talking about the-the sound effects under my uncle.<eos> - What-what...?
W-what are you doing?<eos> Wh-what, that fart?<eos> I'm just trying some new stuff.<eos> No, n-n-not the fart, no.<eos> - The fart's good.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm talking about the-the sound effects under my uncle.<eos> - What-what...?<eos> - Well, uh...<eos> I'm trying to make him likeable by turning him into the romantic lead.<eos> Romantic lead?
- Yeah, no, I'm talking about the-the sound effects under my uncle.<eos> - What-what...?<eos> - Well, uh...<eos> I'm trying to make him likeable by turning him into the romantic lead.<eos> Romantic lead?<eos> They're brother and sister.<eos> Yeah, the audience doesn't know that.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I want to see her bang somebody, but not him.<eos> Yeah.

I want to see her bang somebody, but not him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> What-what if you make him like a, like a spy or something, right?<eos> And he's looking for his hard drive, right?<eos> Because spies are always looking for hard drives.<eos> Or, or, or how about if you write in some scumbag stranger comes in off the street, and goes to town on Bonnie.<eos> All right, look, I don't want to over-write this thing.<eos> And-and all of a sudden you want to turn it into a spy thriller?<eos> - Well...

She lives in the goddamn house.<eos> Well, I'm gonna cut around her, then.<eos> - Yeah, we're gonna...<eos> - Until the ethnic comes, and then<eos> - we're gonna need your mom's room.<eos> - We're gonna get an ethnic.<eos> - You can't get rid of my mom!<eos> - I'm getting rid of her.<eos> - I'm going to cut around her.<eos> - Mac,
- We're gonna get an ethnic.<eos> - You can't get rid of my mom!<eos> - I'm getting rid of her.<eos> - I'm going to cut around her.<eos> - Mac,<eos> - she's out, she's out. - I'm gonna...<eos> This is... He thinks she pops.<eos> - She's terrible.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly.
Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly.<eos> - Mrs. Kelly, hold on.<eos> Just give me one second.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - One, two three.<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> - One, two, three.<eos> - Oh, my God, what?<eos> Hi, Frank.
What?<eos> - One, two, three.<eos> - Oh, my God, what?<eos> Hi, Frank.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came to see you.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Frank, is that you?<eos> Hey, come help me out, I'm stuck.<eos> Not now, Deandra.
Hi, Frank.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came to see you.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Frank, is that you?<eos> Hey, come help me out, I'm stuck.<eos> Not now, Deandra.<eos> Oh, by the way, none of the stuff you're doing is playing.<eos> Except for the fart stuff.<eos> What fart stuff?
See?<eos> You should have farted after you said that.<eos> Just come help me get out of this thing.<eos> - Put a fart in, Dennis. - What?<eos> Oh, goddamn it, what's Frank doing over there?<eos> You know what, I think he's playing the scumbag who comes in off the street to bang your mom.<eos> Well, I don't want him banging my mom, dude.<eos> Oh! Uh, hi, Frank.<eos> I didn't know, uh, Bonnie was gonna be having company. I would have put my hands on.<eos> How embarrassing.

How embarrassing.<eos> Get lost.<eos> I'm gonna bang your sister.<eos> You got it.<eos> Goddamn it, dude,<eos> This is gross.<eos> I-I don't want this.<eos> Can we turn this into something else?<eos> You know what, maybe we could turn this into, like, a love triangle thing between Jack, your mom and Frank?<eos> Well, maybe...

No, I don't want a love triangle between...<eos> - Well...<eos> - I don't want any shape of love between them.<eos> That's just gross. Ooh!<eos> I'll be in the upstairs attic rooting around if anyone needs me.<eos> - Yeah, I do. I need you.<eos> - Oh, I'll be up there, Dee.<eos> - U-Uncle Jack...<eos> - Come on, Bonnie.<eos> This boner
No, I did.<eos> Listen, people... it does not matter how you people try to ruin this thing.<eos> I will make it work, because I'm a genius.<eos> Now look at the... plant!<eos> Look at the plant.<eos> Now look at the globe.<eos> Up. Back to the plant.<eos> Can't cut around her when she's in every shot, can you, Dennis?<eos> - And look at the teddy bear.<eos> And the plant.
Don't try and steal focus, Charlie.<eos> - Charlie, can't breathe. - What?<eos> What?<eos> Help. Help, Charlie.<eos> Get off me, you crazy bitch!<eos> Mom, look, no more shitting!<eos> - Let's go, we got to go where the action is.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Mom!<eos> Frank!

Hey, come on, what are you doing?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Okay, Mom, we got to go where the action is.<eos> Come on.<eos> God...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I was sliding into home, Charlie.<eos> - Get out of here, Frank.<eos> - Aw, come on.<eos> Son of a bitch.

Get off.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I got to say it: that's the best episode yet. That is!<eos> - It's a classic!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I love the button at the ending.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Oh, that was the biggest joke<eos> - in the show.<eos> The biggest moment.
- Oh, that was the biggest joke<eos> - in the show.<eos> The biggest moment.<eos> - It was, it was.<eos> - Was it?<eos> - I mean it, really.<eos> - Oh, well, guys, look, I told you...<eos> - I know my physical comedy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right? - Okay, yeah.

I got a four-episode sex arc.<eos> You know, now-now that everybody knows they're being filmed, it's more like a reality TV show, and I just can't enjoy it when the people who are being filmed<eos> - know they're being filmed.<eos> - Yeah, but what about our show, man?<eos> What about making my mom famous?<eos> - It's just not funny anymore.<eos> - Oh, oh, oh, oh...<eos> I know how to make it funny.<eos> Oh!<eos> - What?

- and essence of a crow - (caws) and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink<eos> - that we invented, thus Fight Milk. - Yeah. I don't know what you guys are talking about right now, but I have heard of your stuff and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it.<eos> - Are you kidding me, dude?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Cowboy Cerrone and Paul Felder drink Fight Milk?<eos> - They're crushing...<eos> - That's...<eos> - Fight Milk is supposed to be crushed.

And here to tell their side of the story is the team from Wolf Cola. Guys, thanks for coming in. Oh, well, thank you for having us, Chet.<eos> We at Wolf Cola were as shocked and saddened by this news as everyone else.<eos> Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals as a premium soda company.<eos> We're a family-run business, and we really care about people's concerns.<eos> Listen, the point is, we have heard you all, and we are working tirelessly to remedy this situation.<eos> Well, not an easy situation, indeed, but handled with grace and aplomb.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. And it looks like you're already getting good feedback.<eos> Oh, that's-that's great.<eos> Well, uh, thank you, Chet. And I want to say thank you to America... And also, we're sorry.<eos> (whispers): Bitch.
Next up, a heroic tale...<eos> I think... you got to understand that Boko Haram did not do 9/11.<eos> Paris, that was done by ISIS. Boko Haram is just concentrating, they're doing Africa. - I mean, there's mosquitos down there that are bigger terrorists than Boko Haram.<eos> - We're gonna take a break.<eos> And the 24-hour news cycle starts again. Way to go, assholes. - I made good points.<eos> - Jesus Christ, I am just getting eviscerated online.<eos> People calling me a bitch, flat-chested bitch, pretty much everybody wanting to rape me.<eos> You opened that door the second you apologized, Dee.<eos> Now social media will come down on you with the fury of a middle-aged man who's accomplished nothing.<eos> - Hi-yo!
I like this rebranding idea.<eos> That's what I got to do...<eos> I got to rebrand my product.<eos> You guys, the problem is, I just ooze sexuality. Well, you ooze. A real woman of power, she exudes no sexuality at all.<eos> That's true.<eos> I think we got to focus on not losing Boko Haram. The fastest-growing marketplace is Muslim extremists.<eos> Frank, we're not going into business with terrorists. Are you crazy? Look, we need to get back on TV immediately and control the goddamn narrative.<eos> Yeah, speaking of TV, we're gonna be doing a little controlling of our narrative, so you guys mind clearing out? Yeah, this is now our set. All right, come on, we got work to do, guys.<eos> Let's go. Let's go. Don't forget your phone,<eos> - stupid idiot. - Yep. (hard rock playing)

So much for having nine lives.<eos> This cat did not land on her feet.<eos> She landed on her neck.<eos> Authorities soon focused on the suspicious nature of her death.<eos> My name is Lance Girard.<eos> I've been with the Philadelphia Police Department for 24 years, 12 of which were with the Homicide division.<eos> I've seen a lot of things.<eos> A man wants to turn himself into a woman?<eos> Okay. Who am I to judge?<eos> But, really, a cat?
I mean, it was the most expensive procedure yet.<eos> You know, but I-I remained supportive and, uh, kept my cool.<eos> And I never threatened her in any way.<eos> Now, due to the nature of this call, we decided to bring him in for questioning. And he cooperated.<eos> Said he wanted to clear his name.<eos> He answered every question.<eos> Even offered DNA samples.<eos> Although he did request to draw his own blood, which is kind of strange.<eos> Mr. Reynolds was forthright.<eos> Charming, quite frankly.
Two hours.<eos> Never moved.<eos> Never blinked.<eos> Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.<eos> He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.<eos> Of something.<eos> Did I kill Maureen?<eos> No.<eos> Am I glad she's dead?<eos> Sure.
Never blinked.<eos> Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.<eos> He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.<eos> Of something.<eos> Did I kill Maureen?<eos> No.<eos> Am I glad she's dead?<eos> Sure.<eos> Maureen's family was convinced of Dennis's guilt.<eos> Maureen?
Maureen died three years ago.<eos> Dennis killed Bastet, all right?<eos> And let me tell you something.<eos> He did us all a favor.<eos> You ever seen a grown woman take a dump in a sandbox?<eos> Despite conjecture, the question still remained:<eos> Was there anything in Dennis Reynolds' past that would suggest him capable of murder?<eos> Testing.<eos> Testing.<eos> Syphilis.

I still have nightmares about it.<eos> And I'm old.<eos> She told you what?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> Look... that crow was injured, and I was simply putting it out of its misery, while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.<eos> Well, yes, there was another crow, but that's because I simply couldn't believe that a crow's neck could be that weak.<eos> Well, yes, there was a third crow, and a fourth, if you must know, but who likes crows?<eos> Look, if you can kill a crow, you can kill a cat.<eos> Cat, cat, cat...

- So it's worse.<eos> Oh, come on, Dennis.<eos> It's funny.<eos> It-It's not funny.<eos> It's not funny at all, because you can never think of jokes on the fly.<eos> H-He, like, pauses the movie to try and think of something funny to say, and then he never can think of anything funny, so he ends up just saying a line from Borat or Austin Powers.<eos> It's super annoying and played-out, and it's not funny.<eos> Well, uh, like this. "Get in my belly."<eos> But you're never referring to anything when you say it.<eos> "Yeah, baby.
It's not funny.<eos> Are we done with this?<eos> Can we be done?<eos> I'm tired of saying the same things over and over again.<eos> Well, wait.<eos> Wh... hold...<eos> Dennis, d-don't leave without me.<eos> I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?<eos> Investigators could find no discrepancies in the timeline.<eos> But then... a twist.

I didn't lie.<eos> I just left out some facts that are insignificant.<eos> And-and intimidate Charlie?<eos> Please.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Call him on the phone and threaten him?<eos> No, I know.<eos> Christ, I was at a loss.<eos> Further inspection of Dennis Reynolds' safe revealed a cache of suspicious items.<eos> Awesome.

Awesome.<eos> So while Mr. Kelly's statements were clearly unreliable and would need to be thrown out, another breakthrough came:<eos> autopsy results came back from the lab.<eos> Um...<eos> Look, is getting groomed like a cat by your ex weird?<eos> Yep.<eos> Is it illegal?<eos> I wish.<eos> The investigation was at a crossroads.<eos> Then another massive break.
Dennis has an answer for everything.<eos> Well, answer me this:<eos> Where's the collar?<eos> Cats have collars.<eos> Maureen's body didn't have a collar on it.<eos> Killers keep trophies.<eos> Alls I'm saying, find the collar, find the killer.<eos> This is not the first time the collar came up.<eos> Dee Reynolds had, oddly, made the collar an issue during filming.<eos> Hey.
This is not the first time the collar came up.<eos> Dee Reynolds had, oddly, made the collar an issue during filming.<eos> Hey.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop with the squirting!<eos> Stop!<eos> Cool it!<eos> We said one spray and then my line.<eos> I...
Stop!<eos> Stop with the squirting!<eos> Stop!<eos> Cool it!<eos> We said one spray and then my line.<eos> I...<eos> It was in my contract that we talked...<eos> I put one squirt in there for...<eos> on purpose.<eos> And this collar!
We said one spray and then my line.<eos> I...<eos> It was in my contract that we talked...<eos> I put one squirt in there for...<eos> on purpose.<eos> And this collar!<eos> Th-There's something wrong with the collar.<eos> It's driving me nuts.<eos> It... is an actual flea collar?<eos> You son of a bitch.
You want to zoom in on this?<eos> !<eos> Hard to say.<eos> But maybe there was another reason she removed it.<eos> Whatever Deandra says is BS.<eos> She's probably just covering for him because she's afraid he's gonna snap her neck like that crow.<eos> Maybe Deandra didn't want to wear the collar in order to cover for her brother and to establish that Maureen never wore a collar at all.<eos> We then discovered something in this piece of footage that blew the doors wide open on this case.<eos> Was I a person of interest?<eos> Yeah.
I'm just some guy with a crazy ex-wife who fell off of a roof pretending to be a cat.<eos> That's the end of it.<eos> All my stories checked out.<eos> I was cleared.<eos> Case closed.<eos> Find the collar, find the killer.<eos> Find the collar, find the killer.<eos> ...'cause a dog is who I am now! ...hit the referee!<eos> Find the collar...<eos> "Very nice."
You guys put that there.<eos> Well, yeah, we needed a big twist at the end to show that you're guilty.<eos> But I'm-I'm not guilty.<eos> What about the security footage of Maureen's death?<eos> I mean, it shows her prancing around on the roof like an asshole, and then she just falls off.<eos> People don't want to see that, because it's hard evidence,<eos> - you know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Like, it's better to actually sit on that footage until, like, maybe episode ten, and then let people decide then if you're guilty or not.<eos> Ten episo...
See?<eos> He gets it.<eos> He's laughing.<eos> - Yeah, 'cause I know he was doing an impression.<eos> - He's laughing.<eos> Okay, wait, uh, let me...<eos> let me think of another one.<eos> Let me think of another one.<eos> "I'll be back."<eos> Oh...
Are you limping?<eos> Uh, no, I've just been working out on this new exercise bike I got,<eos> - and my glutes are, like, so sore.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Know what it is?<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, big-time, big-time. - Howdy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - It's... it's very windy today, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.
Know what it is?<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, big-time, big-time. - Howdy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - It's... it's very windy today, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, man, look at this.<eos> Dog shit.<eos> Did you just step in that on purpose?<eos> Oh, no, I just...
Yeah.<eos> Oh, man, look at this.<eos> Dog shit.<eos> Did you just step in that on purpose?<eos> Oh, no, I just...<eos> you know, I didn't really see it.<eos> You pointed it out to me!<eos> And then you stepped directly in it.<eos> - Since when do you read?<eos> - What?
Oh, man, look at this.<eos> Dog shit.<eos> Did you just step in that on purpose?<eos> Oh, no, I just...<eos> you know, I didn't really see it.<eos> You pointed it out to me!<eos> And then you stepped directly in it.<eos> - Since when do you read?<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.
- Yeah, but he saved his life.<eos> Yeah, but you can't say that word anymore.<eos> So, which is it? You are entitled to nothing!<eos> Listen, motion to present articles of confederation.<eos> - Motion denied.<eos> - Oh...<eos> Shut up, bitch.<eos> You don't deserve anything.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.
Listen, motion to present articles of confederation.<eos> - Motion denied.<eos> - Oh...<eos> Shut up, bitch.<eos> You don't deserve anything.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Okay, look, well, usually, we're a pretty reasonable crew.<eos> - Yeah, right?
You don't deserve anything.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Okay, look, well, usually, we're a pretty reasonable crew.<eos> - Yeah, right?<eos> I mean...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ...we have our differences, but we settle them in house.<eos> - Sure.
You want me to figure out whether or not a hate crime's been committed?<eos> What?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - Way off. Way off.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Oh, no, but, no, it's not about that at all.<eos> Yeah, it's about this.<eos> A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket.<eos> - Mm-hmm.
Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney to figure out which of you is entitled to a two-dollar scratcher?<eos> - Now you're getting it. - Me.<eos> - He's getting it.<eos> - Now he gets it.<eos> The thing is, each one of us feels that we're entitled to that ticket, and we need you<eos> - to tell us who it belongs to.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you scratch it and see if it's worthless, and then you wouldn't have to go through all of this?<eos> - Okay, so he's not getting it.<eos> - What? !
- to tell us who it belongs to.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you scratch it and see if it's worthless, and then you wouldn't have to go through all of this?<eos> - Okay, so he's not getting it.<eos> - What? !<eos> - Is he serious?<eos> - Do you not want a job?<eos> Hold on. Is it Phil?<eos> Is your name Phil?<eos> - Yeah, Phil, yeah.
It belongs to me, you son of a bitch! Please, stop.<eos> Each of you will have an opportunity to plead your case.<eos> The only rule I have is that you each treat each other with respect and common courtesy.<eos> Do we all agree to those terms?<eos> Well, we would like to thank you so much for taking our case so last-minute.<eos> The other guy was not our style.<eos> Well, I'm very happy to do so.<eos> I do have a few questions.<eos> - Fire away.<eos> - Yup.

I actually bought the ticket a couple of weeks ago.<eos> But I didn't realize it was gonna be so goddamn blustery that afternoon.<eos> And as I was putting my book into my purse, the ticket flew out and landed on the ground.<eos> So, you purchased the ticket two weeks ago.<eos> I did.<eos> And why hadn't you scratched the ticket yet?<eos> Oh... well, that's because nobody ever wins those tickets, right?<eos> But as long as you don't scratch it, then you're not a loser.<eos> You know, in fact, you're a winner.<eos> Potentially.
Oh... well, that's because nobody ever wins those tickets, right?<eos> But as long as you don't scratch it, then you're not a loser.<eos> You know, in fact, you're a winner.<eos> Potentially.<eos> - God, Dee...<eos> - That is so sad!<eos> - It's so pathetic.<eos> - What are...<eos> - It is pathetic.<eos> - So sad.
- It's so pathetic.<eos> - What are...<eos> - It is pathetic.<eos> - So sad.<eos> What are you talking...<eos> You just said this exact same thing, like, ten minutes ago, talking about how the ticket represented hope and all that bullshit.<eos> Somehow coming from you, it just came off so sad.<eos> Well, hold on a second. Motion for sub-arbitration to determine whether or not that's sad.<eos> Motion accepted.<eos> All in favor?

I'd also like to point out that while Dee's version is the truth, it's not the whole truth.<eos> Why don't we talk about the contents of Dee's purse?<eos> The scratcher ticket, the candy sour worms, the pack of cigarettes.<eos> Now, what I want to know is... how can a woman who makes less than minimum wage afford such impulse buys?<eos> So, you're smoking now, Dee?<eos> Is this about your weight?<eos> Because if it is, you're already too bony.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I mean, I think you're getting pretty tubby in the midsection area.<eos> - What?

- Like a bird.<eos> No, no, that's fine.<eos> Her hands are becoming a major problem for me though.<eos> I have Parkinson's disease.<eos> What?<eos> Well, at least I have a 46% chance of getting Parkinson's disease, according to a DNA test I took.<eos> The medical journal was because I'm trying to learn as much as I can about this, you know?<eos> And, you guys, according to that, smoking can reduce your risk of...<eos> Oh, my God, who gives a shit? !<eos> - What?
You see, Dee and I had a deal.<eos> I give her money for coffee every morning on the way to work.<eos> And she's instructed to give a very generous tip to the cashier, Cassie.<eos> "This is from my boss, Dennis."<eos> Now, this establishes both generosity and authority.<eos> Possibly a little dominance.<eos> It's all a very choreographed dance between two soon-to-be lovers.<eos> Ah...<eos> Cassie's underage.<eos> No, no, no, what-what?
See, that's where you're wrong.<eos> No, I was, uh, between the ages of 18 and 21, simply making investments.<eos> But not for early deposits?<eos> Well, deposits are part of the withdrawal.<eos> Sometimes I can't make a deposit at all.<eos> Ugh, come on, man.<eos> Just...<eos> Okay, just to be clear: a deposit's a load, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, yeah, yeah.
That's not the point!<eos> The point is:<eos> Dee has no rightful claim to that ticket, and I'll prove it.<eos> You see, yesterday, after noticing the contents of her purse,<eos> I decided to follow her this morning.<eos> Cassie never gets her tip, does she, Dee?<eos> No.<eos> Because I refuse to tip for coffee.<eos> - I think it's dumb.<eos> - Uh-huh.
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.<eos> Miss Reynolds bought the ticket with Mr. Reynolds' money.<eos> But Mr. MacDonald currently possesses it.<eos> Correct.<eos> But I deserve it, and here's why.<eos> There we were, right?<eos> We were just walking down the street, minding our own business.<eos> I'd just spotted the perfect pile of dog shit, and naturally I stepped in it.<eos> - What?

I'd just spotted the perfect pile of dog shit, and naturally I stepped in it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Okay, I'm a little confused.<eos> Why would you voluntarily step into the dog feces?<eos> - Well, I didn't, really...<eos> - You just said you did.<eos> - You said naturally you did...<eos> - And we all watched you do it.<eos> All right, fine.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Okay, I'm a little confused.<eos> Why would you voluntarily step into the dog feces?<eos> - Well, I didn't, really...<eos> - You just said you did.<eos> - You said naturally you did...<eos> - And we all watched you do it.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit so that I would smell of dog shit.<eos> Happy?

I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit so that I would smell of dog shit.<eos> Happy?<eos> - Less happy.<eos> - Why would it make me happy?<eos> I was trying to cover up the smell of the skunk that I let spray me so that there would be no questions.<eos> - Well, now I have more questions.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> Like: why did you let a skunk spray you?<eos> - To cover the smell of cologne, man.<eos> - Oh, man.
The first smell was cigarettes!<eos> I've been smoking with Dee!<eos> All right?<eos> Fine, I said it.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So, right.<eos> So you thought we would care about the smell of cigarettes,<eos> - but not the smell of skunk or dog shit. - Mm.<eos> Mm-hmm.
I'll cover it up.<eos> But, look, if it smells like shit, you must acquit.<eos> You know what?<eos> If everyone's gonna be smoking on my dime...<eos> Look, nobody is debating whether or not the shoe print is yours.<eos> We all know that it is, because everybody saw you kick me.<eos> We're debating whether or not you actually saved my life.<eos> Which you did not, because I was just about to do<eos> - a sweet backflip to safety when you...<eos> - Oh, bullshit.

"Backflip."
Mac knew to look.<eos> Dennis and Dee knew to look.<eos> Charlie, who kicked him in the chest, knew to look.<eos> Hell, even the little kid with the balloon knew where to look.<eos> Okay, it may have been effective, but it was an offensive slur.<eos> And a bigot should not be entitled to a hero's payout.<eos> You're allowed to use any language you want to save somebody's life.<eos> - Really?<eos> Any language?<eos> - Yes.

Oh.
- You gonna let a man die over a word?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> It's just a word.<eos> "Just a word." Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, Frank, tell me something:<eos> If you were going to save somebody else's life, you know, from a falling piano, and you needed a word to just...<eos> - to just cut right through...<eos> - Mm-hmm.
- to just cut right through...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> ...what word would you use to call out to the arbiter?<eos> Uh...<eos> I suppose...<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> We're, uh, we're treading<eos> - on some dangerous territory here, buddy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> "Nigger"?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> ...what word would you use to call out to the arbiter?<eos> Uh...<eos> I suppose...<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> We're, uh, we're treading<eos> - on some dangerous territory here, buddy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> "Nigger"?<eos> Oh!

- What, what?<eos> - Charlie, you can't use that word.<eos> I'm trying to guess the word that he was saying<eos> - that he thought Frank was gonna say.<eos> - No, you don't say that ever.<eos> - I was not using the word.<eos> - Don't ever... that's not...<eos> You can't use that word, buddy.<eos> And yet, we've just sort of been casually throwing the F-word around willy-nilly for the past few days, and that hasn't been a problem?<eos> Well, yeah, Mac, because the...
- associated with... the N-word.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you know that a faggot is a burning bundle of sticks on top of which they used to burn homosexuals?<eos> So, basically, when you call someone a "faggot,"<eos> you are saying that they should be burned at the stake.<eos> Is that right?<eos> That's, uh... - Yes.<eos> - That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark.<eos> - That's pretty dark.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.
Is that right?<eos> That's, uh... - Yes.<eos> - That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark.<eos> - That's pretty dark.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Well, maybe there are a few words<eos> - that we shouldn't be throwing around. - Yep.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What about "cunt"?
We can't lose that!<eos> - Yeah, it's a good word. - What?<eos> That's tough.<eos> It's a great word.<eos> And it's just not offensive.<eos> Especially, uh, directed towards a woman when you're trying to insult her.<eos> When you're trying to make a woman feel small.<eos> That's extremely offensive!<eos> Come on, you could yell "penis" at me, and I'd be fine with it.<eos> Well, all right, fine.
There's nothing offensive about sucking cock.<eos> Half the population loves to suck cock.<eos> The other half of the population, they love getting their cock sucked.<eos> It's kind of a win-win.<eos> We're getting off the point, okay?<eos> In terms of the ticket, I'm calling bullshit on Frank, because, for some reason, he thinks that I'm gay, and that is why he called me the F-word, which makes him a bigot.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Uh, catch me up here.<eos> Now, you're not gay?<eos> Obviously not.

- and be done with it.<eos> - You'll feel better.<eos> - You'll feel better.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Mac, Mac... We found the bike.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> The bike in the basement?<eos> What about it?<eos> Oh, Mac.

I've got nothing to hide.<eos> Just, uh, go get the bike.<eos> I'm-a go get the bike.<eos> I would like to present into evidence, uh... Mac's bike.<eos> What?<eos> It's an awesome workout bike.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Okay.<eos> Mac, why don't you go ahead and operate the bike.<eos> Yeah.

Yeah, what it looks like is that you are fucking yourself with a dildo bike.<eos> I mean, you got the bike shorts with the slits in them, in the...<eos> Oh, the-the ones in the back?<eos> That's for air flow.<eos> This is grotesque.<eos> No, you're not understanding.<eos> I modded out a regular workout bike, to create the optimal workout.<eos> - And added a penis.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh...
- Yeah.<eos> Oh...<eos> I see.<eos> I see where you guys are getting off the rails.<eos> That's not a penis.<eos> Oh.<eos> It's a fist.<eos> Uh... I call it the Ass Pounder 4000.<eos> - And it works like this.<eos> - Uh, no...
What do you do when you're tired?<eos> You want to rest.<eos> You go to sit down, it pushes you right back up in your workout.<eos> The Ass Pounder 4000 will never let you rest.<eos> - Yeah, see?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.<eos> - That's the way it works.<eos> - We got it.<eos> Now, I even have an amazing tagline.<eos> "The Ass Pounder:
- That's the way it works.<eos> - We got it.<eos> Now, I even have an amazing tagline.<eos> "The Ass Pounder:<eos> I've certainly learned something.<eos> This... this has nothing to do with being gay.<eos> This is just the work of a man who's an extreme sexual deviant.<eos> Gay or not.<eos> - Can I have one of those?<eos> - Yeah, whatever,

Are you crazy? !<eos> Quiet!
- Yeah, whatever,<eos> - Yeah, whatever, dude.<eos> - Oh, whatever.<eos> You know, you guys are just jealous because I've got a million-dollar idea and I've got the ticket.<eos> You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!<eos> I bought the ticket.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> !

I think it's actually pretty straightforward.<eos> Mr. MacDonald is in possession of the ticket, so he has ownership.<eos> However, he would not be in possession if his life were not saved by Mr. Reynolds, who set off the chain of events saving him.<eos> So I see it as a 50/50 split.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - I'm a hero! - Oh!<eos> You bitch!<eos> - 50/50 split?<eos> - ...out of the way!<eos> - Nothing for the man
- 50/50 split?<eos> - ...out of the way!<eos> - Nothing for the man<eos> - who paid for the ticket?<eos> - I bought it!<eos> And this bigot here is gonna get a hero's payout?<eos> He may be a bigot and he did use disgusting speech, but it's not technically hate speech since Mr. MacDonald does not claim to be gay.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, does that mean if I claim to be gay, I get all of it?<eos> Well, um, y-yes.
Now you're gay?<eos> There's a history behind it.<eos> I've been gay forever.<eos> Everybody knows it.<eos> Even the balloon kid knew it.<eos> Soon as he gets that ticket, he's going back in the closet. - Yeah.<eos> This isn't fair.<eos> - Mark my words.<eos> If he's gonna do it, he's got to stay out, which he won't, I guarantee you. Fine.<eos> Whatever.

- Yeah, he's got the money for it.<eos> - He's got the money now. Yeah.<eos> But maybe let's make him pay it tomorrow, you know?<eos> - L-Let's let him have this.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Poor guy did just come out over a $14 scratcher.<eos> - That's all that's left? - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - That sucks.<eos> Oh, no.
Frank!<eos> There's somebody here.<eos> Is anybody here?<eos> Speak up... we will shoot.<eos> Wait, hold your fire, Frank!<eos> It's just a kid.<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> Is that water for us? Jesus Christ, Frank, you just killed a kid!<eos> Eh.<eos> Jesus Christ!
Hey, boy.<eos> Is that water for us? Jesus Christ, Frank, you just killed a kid!<eos> Eh.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm gonna give him CPR.<eos> Now, is he blowing someone?<eos> What is happening?<eos> - Yeah, looks like it.<eos> - Jesus Christ,
- Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Jesus Christ, have they slept?<eos> No.<eos> No, they've just been wandering around the bar, blowing kids, doing whatever they're doing, you know?<eos> - Frank, behind you!<eos> - Is this where we're headed?<eos> Know what I mean... as a society?<eos> Hey, uh, have any of you seen my guy yet?<eos> Oh, what is this, now?<eos> - What?

What words is she trying to say?<eos> - Uh, she's talking about Channing Tatum.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - He's an actor.<eos> - What do I know him in?<eos> - Well, he-he plays G.I. Joe.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - G.I...<eos> Oh, G.I. Joe's the shit.<eos> - G.I. Joe.

It doesn't matter.<eos> Anyway, we had this really amazing connection and the sex was so meaningful, both of us wept tears of joy.<eos> - Makes me want to throw up.<eos> - You know what I think is happening right now?<eos> - Just what happened.<eos> I think the guy's coming by because you stole his watch.<eos> Oh, right, you jacked his wallet or something so he'd come over and you-you...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right?

- I was like,<eos> "What's become of me?"<eos> You know, all I do is I strip all night, I play video games all day, I have meaningless sex with strangers.<eos> My own daughter won't even talk to me, you know?<eos> So I was like... "Damn."<eos> And I realized I hit rock bottom.<eos> Oh.<eos> And that's why I was crying.<eos> Oh.<eos> Right, yeah.
And I realized I hit rock bottom.<eos> Oh.<eos> And that's why I was crying.<eos> Oh.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But don't-don't take it personally.<eos> No.<eos> Because it...

- All right, cool.<eos> - It's...<eos> - Yeah, cool.<eos> - Cool, 'cause it really helped me realize that I got to give that lifestyle up.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - So thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Um...<eos> I don't remember your name.<eos> Dee.

- Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Uh, hey, buddy, how about when your daughter stopped talking to you...<eos> Maybe that was your rock bottom, okay?<eos> I'm not rock bottom.<eos> You know what I am?<eos> I'm a rock.<eos> Dee is a rock.<eos> In fact, I'm the type of gal who makes men's lives better.<eos> Hey-o!
No, I got...<eos> I got to do something about this, goddamn it.<eos> I am gonna fix this problem, 'cause I'm gonna tell you something right now:<eos> Sweet Dee is a rock.<eos> Goddamn it, Frank, you shot a woman.<eos> - Who cares?<eos> - Jesus Christ, man,<eos> - I got to stop.<eos> This is too real.<eos> - What, what?
This is too real.<eos> - What, what?<eos> I got to take a break, dude.<eos> It's driving me insane.<eos> Come on, how are we gonna win if you keep quitting?<eos> I don't care!<eos> - Lot of storm-outs today, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.
- that's not trauma.<eos> That's not real trauma.<eos> - Nah.<eos> It's not even<eos> - that bad.<eos> - I mean, if... if anything, that's insulting to people<eos> - who have experienced real trauma.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I mean, like you, for instance.<eos> Yeah.

Yeah.<eos> Uh, me?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Sure, man.<eos> I mean, you grew up fatherless.<eos> You were raised by a woman who was basically a prostitute.<eos> Well, the father stuff was real.<eos> Yeah, without a doubt.<eos> Got some daddy issues there.<eos> And-and you, too.
- Doesn't matter.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Right, right.<eos> - This is separate, yeah.<eos> - Look, it's...<eos> It's not the point. The point is, yeah, fine, I'll do it.<eos> You'll do what?<eos> I'll strip.<eos> Yeah.

Yeah.<eos> Huh.<eos> I didn't realize you were talking about that.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Huh.<eos> - You know, if this Mike fella wants to walk away from an amazing stripping career, hey, I'll take up that mantle.<eos> You know, frankly, I'm a little disappointed in myself for not thinking of it before.<eos> You know?<eos> It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.
It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing, man.<eos> I can't do it without you.<eos> I need you to get my back.<eos> Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?<eos> Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I-I-I... no, I just literally need you to have a look at my back, you know, make sure there's no moles or, like, unsightly hairs, bumps, zits, you know,<eos> - that kind of thing.<eos> - Ah, yeah...
- Ah, yeah...<eos> And then, you know, get after it.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll clean you up.<eos> All right, all right, I can do that.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Cool, man. You be my boy?<eos> Yeah, I'll be the boy.<eos> Well, just be my... L-like my bag boy.<eos> You know, carry around my-my lotions, my oils, my scents, my razors.<eos> Cool, man.

I'm so sorry, man.<eos> Hey, son.<eos> Dad? !<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> How did you get in the game?<eos> Guess we... won't be having that catch after all.<eos> You were gonna have a catch with me?<eos> I was, but... you killed me, son. I...<eos> love...<eos> Wa-Wa...
love...<eos> Wa-Wa...<eos> Wait! Wait, Dad!<eos> Who do you love?<eos> Dad, who do you love?<eos> Wait.<eos> Dad, who do you love?<eos> No, Dad! No! What the hell?<eos> Oh, was that a dream?<eos> Dennis?
Wait! Wait, Dad!<eos> Who do you love?<eos> Dad, who do you love?<eos> Wait.<eos> Dad, who do you love?<eos> No, Dad! No! What the hell?<eos> Oh, was that a dream?<eos> Dennis?<eos> Oh, my God, man, I just had the weirdest dream. - What?<eos> - Frank.
Dad, who do you love?<eos> No, Dad! No! What the hell?<eos> Oh, was that a dream?<eos> Dennis?<eos> Oh, my God, man, I just had the weirdest dream. - What?<eos> - Frank.<eos> Look, I-I... I can't sleep.<eos> I'm having nightmares.<eos> - Dead kids, dads.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mac.
- Why?<eos> - I've never, like, cut such a muscular back.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, dude, your back looks great, man.<eos> I'm working hard, dude.<eos> Dude, you're putting the work in, and it's showing, man.<eos> - Thank you so much, man.<eos> I really appreciate that.<eos> - Yeah, right, right, right, right.
- Thanks, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, dude, your back looks great, man.<eos> I'm working hard, dude.<eos> Dude, you're putting the work in, and it's showing, man.<eos> - Thank you so much, man.<eos> I really appreciate that.<eos> - Yeah, right, right, right, right.<eos> But just let's not talk about it in there.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I really appreciate that.<eos> - Yeah, right, right, right, right.<eos> But just let's not talk about it in there.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Don't bring it up.<eos> Can you walk me through what your guy is again?<eos> Okay, so here's the deal, man.<eos> Who do girls want to have sex with more than anybody else?<eos> - Jugglers.<eos> - Jug...?
Who do girls want to have sex with more than anybody else?<eos> - Jugglers.<eos> - Jug...?<eos> - Dudes who can, like, juggle things.<eos> - I know what a juggler is.<eos> - You know, with the fire sticks and the balls.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, they don't want to have sex with a juggler.<eos> They want to have sex with their dads.<eos> - Weird.
I got to say, though, I'm looking inside there, and this isn't making sense to me.<eos> I mean, these are all older women.<eos> Might be a little bit hard for me to pull off the dad thing at all.<eos> - That's not a good play.<eos> - You know, I'm getting a bad feeling about this, man.<eos> Hey, man, do you think maybe that's 'cause<eos> - of your librarian trauma?<eos> - You're talking about Ms. Klinsky?<eos> - Yeah, she was an older woman, and...<eos> - What?
It's not sexy, okay?<eos> - Okay, yeah, well, then let's split.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right, let's go. - All right, man.<eos> Are you the stripper?<eos> - Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - What, are you 40?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Fine.
- Okay.<eos> - All right, let's go. - All right, man.<eos> Are you the stripper?<eos> - Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - What, are you 40?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Fine.<eos> You guys'll do, I guess.<eos> Y-You guys?
- Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - What, are you 40?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Fine.<eos> You guys'll do, I guess.<eos> Y-You guys?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> I'm just the boy.<eos> - The what?
I'm-I'm his boy.<eos> Well, you're not my boy. He's not...<eos> Are you gonna stand out here and talk like little bitches, or are you gonna come inside and take your dicks out for money?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Just don't call me Daddy.<eos> Yeah, my generation... we drank our problems away.<eos> But since you softies like to talk about everything,<eos> I figured this was a good thing to do.<eos> A PTSD support group, Frank?<eos> Yeah, yeah.
A PTSD support group, Frank?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Maybe you'll get some help,<eos> - we can finish the damn game.<eos> - What's up, dicks?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Well, because I am a rock and not a rock bottom, I decided to reach out to Mike and see if I could get him some help with, uh, some of these issues he's been having.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Is this a PTSD meeting for vets?<eos> Mm-hmm, yeah.
Okay, look, I-I'm not gonna pass myself off as a vet, Frank.<eos> - Yeah, I don't feel good about this.<eos> Maybe...<eos> - Well, then just don't talk.<eos> - But...<eos> - You don't have to talk. Just sit down.<eos> Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair, let's get this started.<eos> - Probably not gonna call on you anyway.<eos> You guys want to introduce yourselves?<eos> Ugh.
- Yeah, I don't feel good about this.<eos> Maybe...<eos> - Well, then just don't talk.<eos> - But...<eos> - You don't have to talk. Just sit down.<eos> Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair, let's get this started.<eos> - Probably not gonna call on you anyway.<eos> You guys want to introduce yourselves?<eos> Ugh.<eos> Goddamn it.
You know?<eos> Think of Channing Tatum.<eos> Can you please explain Channing Tatum to him?<eos> - I'm not sure I follow...<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> He's G.I. Joe.<eos> Mac can't sleep at night.<eos> He's having erotic nightmares and shit.<eos> - He doesn't know what's real anymore.<eos> - Yeah.
- Yeah.<eos> Mike's embarrassed about his video game-playing, which makes no sense to me, 'cause you know what?<eos> Video games are hard.<eos> - You ever play Fallujah?<eos> - Beat it five times.<eos> - You want to play with me?<eos> - I'm actually trying to get away from that.<eos> Well, what if he paid you?<eos> Ten bucks an hour.<eos> - 20.
We're gonna win this war.<eos> What war?<eos> - The war on women!<eos> - Women, man!<eos> There's a war on women?<eos> Can I get in on that?<eos> Bro, it's been raging since the beginning of time, bro.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - And we're losing ground.<eos> Phone!

The accents were terrible.<eos> - The accents were terrible.<eos> - All right, look, I just...<eos> I want him to have fun, make a ton of money, party with a bunch of sorority girls, you know?<eos> I need to show him that this is a great life.<eos> This is not a rock-bottom life.<eos> We'll do it at Paddy's.<eos> It'll be a win-win.<eos> - Make a ton of mon...<eos> - Mmm.

Well, where's Mike?<eos> I'll do it with him.<eos> He's out, too.<eos> Yeah, he's doing some weird stripping thing with Dennis and Charlie.<eos> I only woke you up 'cause I figured you'd want to see it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I really appreciate you getting me this gig.<eos> I don't think I was ready to give this lifestyle up.<eos> Of course not.
Of course not.<eos> Why would you?<eos> You're really good at dancing.<eos> That's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Listen, you like video games?<eos> I got you paid for it.<eos> You're a great stripper?<eos> I got you this gig.<eos> - And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?<eos> - What?
- You like how it smells?<eos> - It looks good.<eos> - And you can't see any of the blood.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> It's all patched up good.<eos> - What do you think about my prop, hmm?<eos> - That's really cool.<eos> - A little kid licking that up there.<eos> - Wait, what-what am I smelling?<eos> Cheese.

Yeah, I know.<eos> But we needed that, like, you know,<eos> - McConaughey emcee-type.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But looks like we got<eos> AIDS Dallas Buyers Club McConaughey,<eos> - not Magic Mike McConaughey.<eos> - That is what he looks like.<eos> - It's a good crowd, though.

I'm so sick of hearing about Jerry, man.<eos> - Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, uh,<eos> Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.<eos> - This one's tapped, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, give me a second.<eos> Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too?<eos> - Which bridge? - Guys, guys...<eos> - Which bridge, really?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.

Listen, I need everybody to drop everything and come out to the back alley.<eos> There is an unopened crate out there.<eos> - An un... an unopened crate?<eos> - Crate?<eos> Oh! - Crate?<eos> - Hey, there's a crate!<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh, shit, okay, okay, you know what I'll do?<eos> Um, I can put a fan next to the yuck puddle,<eos> - and the smell's gonna clear everybody out.<eos> - Oh! I don't want to clear everybody out.<eos> I'm saying why are we running out of the bar to-to look<eos> - in some dumb crate?<eos> - Well, it's not about the crate.<eos> It's about the mystery of what's inside the crate<eos> - that gets us.<eos> - Yeah, the straw.

- Oh. Was it me?<eos> - Who came up with that?<eos> Whoever invented the idea of a bar.<eos> Which is what we decided to do years ago when we bought this goddamn place.<eos> So, can we please, for once in our lives, not go chasing after crates?<eos> You know, and talk about worms?<eos> Right? Yelling at the customers and shit?<eos> Can we just do the one thing we've never tried?<eos> Can we just do our jobs? ♪ ♪ - ♪ ♪ - (indistinct conversations) '89, good.<eos> Damn drunks.

Oh, the soda gun's clogged.<eos> Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?<eos> Trick Charlie into doing it.<eos> Well, I want you to do it.<eos> I can't trick Charlie.<eos> Charlie's pretending to ignore me because he's jealous of Jerry.<eos> I-I don't want you to trick Charlie.<eos> - I want you to clear the lines.<eos> - Speaking of Jerry...<eos> - Break time.

You know, I can't even play Night Crawlers with him anymore 'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.<eos> I'm gonna stop you there, Charlie, because<eos> I've exhausted my daily quota of worm talk and worm-related issues.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Yeah. - Don't reach your hands in there!<eos> - Why not?<eos> Jesus Christ...<eos> Oh, God. Look, can you just... can you please go clear the lines for me?<eos> Are they clogged?<eos> Yeah.
Are they clogged?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Just trick Dee into it.<eos> - It's not a tri...<eos> See, this is the problem. You guys all think that work is tricking people.<eos> It's not.<eos> It's just your job.<eos> So, can you please go do it?<eos> In all the time that we've talked about tricking each other into doing our jobs we could've made 1,000 drinks.<eos> Yeah, maybe.

Two shots of whiskey.<eos> Okay, yes, nice.<eos> Finally, somebody's actually working.<eos> You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.<eos> - I appreciate you.<eos> - All right, what are you doing?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - That was a big one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - The other one, too.
I don't trust Charlie today.<eos> You know, I made him a valentine...<eos> He hasn't given me shit yet in return.<eos> Why the hell did you do that?<eos> We don't do valentines anymore.<eos> I know, but we used to, and it was fun, you know?<eos> It was a goof.<eos> You guys were supposed to give valentine's cards to each other, but instead you were just sticking hate mail in a suggestion box covered in hearts.<eos> I'll give it to you, though... it got a little nasty at the end.<eos> A-A little bit nasty?
A-A little bit nasty?<eos> One of you put anthrax in the box.<eos> Or do you not remember the anthrax scare?<eos> Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.<eos> To many, 9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.<eos> (chuckles) That's a good point.<eos> No, I'm talking about a different anthrax scare, but it shouldn't concern you.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - She just talks too much.<eos> - Hey-oh!
(chuckles) That's a good point.<eos> No, I'm talking about a different anthrax scare, but it shouldn't concern you.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - She just talks too much.<eos> - Hey-oh!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Cricket!<eos> - Cricket!<eos> - Cricket! - Hey, you guys mind if I go in the bathroom and smoke some PCP?<eos> - CHARLIE:
- Stop it!<eos> - She just talks too much.<eos> - Hey-oh!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Cricket!<eos> - Cricket!<eos> - Cricket! - Hey, you guys mind if I go in the bathroom and smoke some PCP?<eos> - CHARLIE:<eos> No, dude, you do you!<eos> - FRANK:
- Hey-oh!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Cricket!<eos> - Cricket!<eos> - Cricket! - Hey, you guys mind if I go in the bathroom and smoke some PCP?<eos> - CHARLIE:<eos> No, dude, you do you!<eos> - FRANK:<eos> Go for it.<eos> MAC:
- FRANK:<eos> Go for it.<eos> MAC:<eos> You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Guys, guys, guys, what in the hell are you doing?<eos> - Cricket.
Go for it.<eos> MAC:<eos> You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> - You do you!<eos> We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Guys, guys, guys, what in the hell are you doing?<eos> - Cricket.<eos> - Cricket.

Guys, guys, guys, what in the hell are you doing?<eos> - Cricket.<eos> - Cricket.<eos> Yeah, Cricket.<eos> This has got to stop, you guys.<eos> This is nuts.<eos> We can't go around encouraging homeless men to smoke PCP in our restrooms, you know, trying to trick each other into doing our jobs and getting fired up at the-the mere mention of a crate.<eos> - Oh, but it's just such a mystery, isn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Cool crate.
It shifts.<eos> I've seen it shift. He's seen it shift. You see, we shouldn't have an amorphous shifting blob in the bar, you know?<eos> So why don't you and Mac go solve that goddamn mystery by cleaning it up, you know?<eos> And, oh, what about the mystery of the clogged soda gun, you know?<eos> Dee, why don't you and Frank go solve that mystery by clearing the lines? Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.<eos> And we could probably trick Cricket into doing it.<eos> Oh, why don't we just trick...<eos> Cricket doesn't work here though.<eos> - But that's free labor.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like...<eos> - Unless... Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Charlie, he doesn't want us to work at all.<eos> - (gasps) He doesn't?<eos> - No. He doesn't want us to mop up the yuck puddle.<eos> - He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."<eos> - Oh!<eos> Of emotions.<eos> Of what?
- No. He doesn't want us to mop up the yuck puddle.<eos> - He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."<eos> - Oh!<eos> Of emotions.<eos> Of what?<eos> - It's a metaphor.<eos> - For what?<eos> He wants us to talk through our personal issues and be more open with our feelings because it's Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh!<eos> Weird.
Valentine's Day is an entire day dedicated to feelings,<eos> - something that Dennis doesn't have.<eos> - Right, that's true.<eos> And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.<eos> But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man<eos> - and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,<eos> - Well, no,<eos> - to break down those walls.<eos> - but okay. All right.<eos> - All right, cool.

- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I have a huge surprise for Dennis, but I feel like he's not emotionally available to...<eos> Uh, uh, Frank's gonna leave me for Jerry, man.<eos> Oh, uh, I was talking.<eos> But, uh,<eos> I guess we'll, um... we'll do your thing first.<eos> You know he's only doing this to get a rise out of you, right?<eos> - Oh, that's so Jerry.<eos> - No, not Jerry.
- Okay.<eos> I have a huge surprise for Dennis, but I feel like he's not emotionally available to...<eos> Uh, uh, Frank's gonna leave me for Jerry, man.<eos> Oh, uh, I was talking.<eos> But, uh,<eos> I guess we'll, um... we'll do your thing first.<eos> You know he's only doing this to get a rise out of you, right?<eos> - Oh, that's so Jerry.<eos> - No, not Jerry.<eos> Not the worm.

If you just pretend to like the worm, then he'll probably just get rid of it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You think so?<eos> I know so, buddy.<eos> - Nice, man.<eos> All right.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.<eos> - Yeah, that just gave me a great idea. - If I just give...<eos> - Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...
All right.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.<eos> - Yeah, that just gave me a great idea. - If I just give...<eos> - Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...<eos> You're not gonna let me talk?<eos> So, uh, you're gay, huh?<eos> For pay or for free?<eos> Uh, for free, I guess.<eos> Chump.
- Yeah, that just gave me a great idea. - If I just give...<eos> - Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...<eos> You're not gonna let me talk?<eos> So, uh, you're gay, huh?<eos> For pay or for free?<eos> Uh, for free, I guess.<eos> Chump.<eos> - It's taking forever. - (grunts)<eos> - Ugh.
So, uh, you're gay, huh?<eos> For pay or for free?<eos> Uh, for free, I guess.<eos> Chump.<eos> - It's taking forever. - (grunts)<eos> - Ugh.<eos> - Try sucking on the other end, maybe.<eos> I'm not sucking on the other end.<eos> Get that shit in my mouth?<eos> No, thanks.
No, thanks.<eos> And what the hell's going on with Dennis?<eos> Since when does he care how the bar does?<eos> (grunts) I don't know.<eos> It doesn't add up.<eos> I can't get a read on him these days.<eos> He's just always cranky and irritated.<eos> - Rage-filled, rape-y.<eos> - It's like, as the years go by, he just gets more and more irrational.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.
I'm so mad at Charlie, because I made him a valentine, and, you know what, he didn't even really...<eos> I gave myself Jerry on purpose.<eos> Well, I was right in the middle of a sentence, but... what?<eos> I gave myself the tapeworm.<eos> - Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've...<eos> - How, you're wondering.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight.<eos> - Jesus Christ.
- Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've...<eos> - How, you're wondering.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> Uh, that's enough.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, it took about four ounces of it.<eos> - I-I...
- Jesus Christ.<eos> Uh, that's enough.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, it took about four ounces of it.<eos> - I-I...<eos> That's enough!<eos> I don't want to know!<eos> With the tip of a teaspoon.<eos> - Okay...<eos> Frank!
With the tip of a teaspoon.<eos> - Okay...<eos> Frank!<eos> - How else?<eos> Stop answering questions I'm not asking, okay?<eos> - I'm done, I'm done. - I had to hold my knees above my head for a half hour<eos> - and clench my sphincter.<eos> - Stop!<eos> (muttering) Charlie, I'm mad, - and I think we need to clear the lines.<eos> - Huh?
Wh-What are you doing?<eos> (sighs) I'm trying to write a valentine. I just...<eos> Oh. (chuckling):<eos> Okay. Uh, okay.<eos> Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish.<eos> - Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I also got you a box of chocolates, so... - (chuckles) - Right.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Dee, Dee, Dee.
Oh. (chuckling):<eos> Okay. Uh, okay.<eos> Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish.<eos> - Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I also got you a box of chocolates, so... - (chuckles) - Right.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Dee, Dee, Dee.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?
- Okay.<eos> I also got you a box of chocolates, so... - (chuckles) - Right.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Dee, Dee, Dee.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - I can't think of one.<eos> Are you making a valentine for Frank's tapeworm?<eos> Well, not if I can't think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry."<eos> - You son of a bitch.

(whoops) - All right, Frank, Frank, Frank, before you do another thing,<eos> - I wanted to give you a valentine.<eos> - Unbelievable!<eos> Right in front of me?<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah-huh.<eos> - Charlie.
- Unbelievable!<eos> Right in front of me?<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah-huh.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Well...<eos> - Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,<eos> - these are just for Jerry.<eos> - (Dee gasps) No.<eos> - Charlie. Oh.
- Charlie.<eos> Well...<eos> - Well, it's for both of you guys, but, these,<eos> - these are just for Jerry.<eos> - (Dee gasps) No.<eos> - Charlie. Oh.<eos> - Yeah. (laughs)<eos> - Oh, that's so sweet. - Look at that.<eos> - Thank...<eos> - You dick.
- Yeah. (laughs)<eos> - Oh, that's so sweet. - Look at that.<eos> - Thank...<eos> - You dick.<eos> - You shouldn't have.<eos> Mmm.<eos> - No! No, he didn't.<eos> Listen to me, I got these for him, all right?<eos> - So no.<eos> - Mmm?
- You dick.<eos> - You shouldn't have.<eos> Mmm.<eos> - No! No, he didn't.<eos> Listen to me, I got these for him, all right?<eos> - So no.<eos> - Mmm?<eos> - I got these.<eos> - Our blood sugar's low.<eos> Mmm.
- I got these.<eos> - Our blood sugar's low.<eos> Mmm.<eos> - Oh, guess what, I bought these for him. - Mmm... - (laughs) - (Frank moaning)<eos> You fool! - It's so good, Charlie.<eos> - Those chocolates that you're so gleefully devouring are chock-full of Bye-Bye Jerry pills.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Oh, but I would, Frank.<eos> You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.<eos> But Jerry...
Oh, but I would, Frank.<eos> You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.<eos> But Jerry...<eos> Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?<eos> You poisoned me.<eos> - (grunting)<eos> - No. No, he poisoned me.<eos> At worst, you're properly medicated. (laughs)<eos> (groans) You son of a bitch.<eos> - Charlie.

Jerry!<eos> (Frank groans) I'm poisoned.<eos> - (shouts)<eos> - Poisoned! I'm poisoned.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - We've been poisoned.<eos> - No, No.<eos> No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned.<eos> - They're just...<eos> - CHARLIE:
- Poisoned! I'm poisoned.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - We've been poisoned.<eos> - No, No.<eos> No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned.<eos> - They're just...<eos> - CHARLIE:<eos> Plenty more poison<eos> - where that came from! - (bar patrons gasp)<eos> - DENNIS:

You son of a bitch, Charlie.
- Don't talk about...<eos> - Why are you going on and on about it?<eos> I... I did this for you, Charlie.<eos> What?<eos> I gave myself Jerry on purpose.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> To slim down for you.<eos> Why would you...<eos> why would you slim down for me?<eos> What?
- It was a compliment.<eos> I love when you<eos> - smell like crab, Frank. - (Dennis pounds on bar)<eos> Take the conversation someplace else.<eos> - (door opens, closes)<eos> - Okay? Don't do it here.<eos> You-you didn't think I was too fat?<eos> Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal, but I loved you that way, Frank.<eos> - Fat and crabby. - (door opens)<eos> FRANK:

- Huh?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Getting the worm.<eos> - You-you're gonna talk about pulling a dead worm out of his ass?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Please, don't talk about these things.<eos> Now, by the grace of God, we somehow still have Dottie here so, please, don't scare her away.<eos> Sorry, Dottie.<eos> - Who's ready to die, bitches?<eos> ! - DENNIS:

Okay?<eos> A Valentine's Day song?<eos> All right?<eos> Is that... will that work?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Sing a song.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh... a Dee song.<eos> - Nothing rhymes with Dee.<eos> - Every...!

And you said you loved me!<eos> - Ew!<eos> (Dee laughing) - You bitch!<eos> Look, that song was derivative of a song I wrote<eos> - for the waitress, anyway, then.<eos> - Yeah, but guess what?<eos> Frank, grab that anthrax!<eos> - Grab it! Grab it! - (Dee screams)<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right, this is nuts! This is crazy!<eos> I mean, I-I-I can't believe we blew another opportunity to have a working bar.<eos> To have a successful business together!<eos> Because you assholes get so worked up over Valentine's Day, the dumbest holiday that ever existed!<eos> But I thought you were trying to get us to focus on ourselves and focus on Valentine's Day.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Are-are you insane?<eos> !<eos> I...
All I've been saying is to please focus on the bar!<eos> But you just couldn't do it!<eos> Dennis, I got to say, I feel like this is just about something else.<eos> It's...<eos> It's not about something else, it's...<eos> - The bar is fine.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - This is... something else is up.<eos> - It's always fine, yeah.<eos> CHARLIE:
- This is... something else is up.<eos> - It's always fine, yeah.<eos> CHARLIE:<eos> You know what it is?<eos> - This is 'cause you hate Valentine's Day.<eos> - It's not because I hate Valentine's Day.<eos> - It's because I-I just want...<eos> - No, that's what it is.<eos> - He's trying to distract us from Valentine's Day.<eos> - Mm-hmm.
- He's trying to distract us from Valentine's Day.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - I'm not trying to distract anybody from Valen...<eos> - Yeah, you know why, though, you guys?<eos> - That's the thing, yeah.<eos> It's because he doesn't have any feelings and we do.<eos> Yeah, because we have feelings and you don't, and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh, stop!<eos> Goddamn it!
Okay, so... so... that's why I hate Valentine's Day, and that's why I put anthrax in the box.<eos> That was you?<eos> Yes, it was me.<eos> I just... (sighs)<eos> I just wanted it to stop.<eos> Okay?<eos> And it's powdered sugar, by the way.<eos> - Oh, he's already eating it.<eos> - I knew that. (sighs) MAC:<eos> DENNIS:

Carl Lewis couldn't catch him!<eos> Mr. Sanderson! Mr. Sanderson!
Okay.<eos> Well, guess I'm gonna have to cut your heart out then. What did you just say? I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut... your heart... out of your body.<eos> You see, uh, I'm from the streets. And I'm about to poke you full of holes.<eos> He'll do it!

That's so...<eos> Do you like them?<eos> They are super large.<eos> Hold on.<eos> All the portraits have sold to one man.<eos> You're kidding!<eos> No.<eos> Well, somebody likes them.<eos> They just bought all six.<eos> All six?

Can we talk somewhere private?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I'm not very good at this. I've never had to...<eos> I've never wanted to try again.<eos> Christian, I don't...<eos> It's not a good idea.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Okay? Just talk, please.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> Okay, fine.
But we are only talking and that is it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm gonna take off.<eos> Already?<eos> Your photos are so stunning, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. I'm proud of you.<eos> Christian, I can't. I can't do this.<eos> Christ, Ana.
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.<eos> That's still in you.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Working on what?<eos> I can't do this if you won't talk to me.<eos> What do you wanna know?<eos> Everything.
Everything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Yeah. We'll manage.<eos> My birth mother died when I was four.<eos> She was an addict. Crack.<eos> You can fill in the blanks.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> I did.<eos> But you were asleep at the time.<eos> Okay. Well, um...
But you need all those things.<eos> I need you more.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Thanks, Taylor.<eos> No strings attached.<eos> This is spiky.<eos> I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.

No. You convinced me.<eos> I'm reading.<eos> That's great.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hey um, uh...<eos> Christian, this is Jack Hyde.<eos> I'm the boyfriend.<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> What will you have, Chris?<eos> Thanks, Jack.
You gotta calm down.<eos> Calm isn't really my forte.<eos> I know something that could help.<eos> You know, this is not what I had in mind.<eos> When's the last time you went shopping?<eos> Houston. A week ago.<eos> What'd you buy?<eos> An airline.<eos> Here.<eos> Your new favorite flavor.

That's my job.<eos> You can't start interfering in my career.<eos> It's not about that.<eos> I've wanted to move into publishing. They're the best fit.<eos> But you're gonna be my boss.<eos> Technically, I'll be your boss's boss's boss.<eos> And I'm gonna be sleeping with my boss's boss's boss.<eos> Right now, you're arguing with him.<eos> Yeah, because he's being an ass.<eos> An ass.

You looked so peaceful.<eos> I didn't wanna wake you.<eos> There's not much for breakfast, unless you want cold stir-fry.<eos> No.<eos> Here. The check you gave me for Wanda, you should have it back.<eos> Keep it.<eos> Keep it? It's $24,000.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I make that kind of money every 15 minutes.<eos> Andrea?
Why would you take me there?<eos> Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?<eos> Our relationship ended years ago.<eos> We're just friends.<eos> And business partners.<eos> Business partners? Are you kidding me?<eos> Would you take your subs there?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> For what? Her approval?<eos> What?
She left.<eos> Got married.<eos> I thought she moved on, but then her husband died in a car crash.<eos> She had a breakdown.<eos> What does she want now?<eos> When you and I were in Georgia together, she turned up here and tried to slit her wrists in front of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Gail took her to the hospital, but by the time I got there, she'd taken off.<eos> My people have been trying to find her.<eos> Your people?
He was lost without you.<eos> Oh. Can I have my date back, please?<eos> By all means. Spoilsport.<eos> See you later.<eos> No, no, they can't take that away from me<eos> Ana!<eos> My god!<eos> That dress, it should be illegal.<eos> Monique lhuillier.<eos> Yeah. Mia.
Mia, you know i barely recognized you.<eos> Yeah! The new me.<eos> Okay, what do you think?<eos> Well, it's very, uh, blonde.<eos> How do you put up with him?<eos> Do you know he was an even bigger pain as a teenager?<eos> He got expelled from four different schools for brawling.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Yeah, totally out of control.<eos> - Mia, enough.

Once upon a time.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Is that your mother?<eos> You know you can just say you don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> They'll be missing us.<eos> Uh, I just need a minute.<eos> I'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Okay.

Not "gust 'm the bedroom.<eos> No, he's changing that.<eos> It's not what he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of woman who wants to be owned.<eos> If you really wanna make him happy, if you wanna be happy, you'll let him go.<eos> There's no way that someone like you could ever understand what we have.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Nothing lasts.<eos> Nothing.
Stay here.<eos> We'll have the car towed.<eos> What happened?<eos> That's my car!<eos> What happened to my car?<eos> Check the apartment. Call me when it's safe.<eos> Yes, sir. Right away. Copy that.<eos> Smith, you stick with Mr. grey.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Christian?
Christian?<eos> Do you think it was Leila?<eos> You really think she would do something like that?<eos> I really don't see why we can't just go back to your apartment.<eos> That place is like a fortress.<eos> There's no way she could have gotten in there.<eos> She shouldn't have been able to get into the garage, either.<eos> I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Good evening, Mr. grey.<eos> Hey, ed.
That's beautiful.<eos> The view's probably amazing.<eos> I wonder who lives there.<eos> It's an old sea widow.<eos> Lost her husband years ago.<eos> Sits at the window every night waiting for him to come home.<eos> Did you just make that up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna take the helm?<eos> Me'?
Right there. Just hold.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay,<eos> no, you're fine, Ana. I'm still here.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> I have to let go.<eos> Don't.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Okay. Okay?<eos> You ready?
Okay,<eos> no, you're fine, Ana. I'm still here.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> I have to let go.<eos> Don't.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Okay. Okay?<eos> You ready?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my god!

May I?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, I'm Ana.<eos> But you knew that already because you said my last name.<eos> Mr. grey is in his study, just finishing up a call.<eos> I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.<eos> Okay.<eos> See anything you like?<eos> Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.<eos> The door was, um, unlocked.<eos> I'll have to talk to Mrs. Jones.<eos> Does she come in here a lot?<eos> Does she dust in here?<eos> Those are nipple clamps.<eos> Come here. Give me your hand.<eos> It's even more intense when you take them off.<eos> What's this?<eos> Okay.
That's enough show-and-tell.<eos> What's this?<eos> Let's learn to walk before we run.<eos> I kinda like running.<eos> Ana? Mmm-hmm?<eos> Last time we did this, you saw another side of me.<eos> And you left.<eos> Last time was different.<eos> All right. But not here.<eos> Mrs. Jones.

This isn't some sort of vacation.<eos> It's a work trip with my boss, who I would like to impress.<eos> You know he's had three assistants in the last 18 months, all of whom have quit without notice?<eos> You don't think i can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything.<eos> And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.<eos> But I'd like to take you there myself.<eos> Okay.

Yeah.<eos> I mean, of course I would rather see New York with you.<eos> Good.<eos> I hate it when we fight.<eos> That wasn't a fight.<eos> That was a conversation.<eos> It was, you know, when somebody talks, and the other person listens, and you resolve an issue.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> It's crazy, isn't it?<eos> Night, Ana.

I'm talking about going the extra mile.<eos> Unless you want me to compete with Christian grey for your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Your boyfriend has a reputation for being a little ruthless.<eos> Is that what you like?<eos> If you have a problem with my work, then you should take it up with hr.<eos> Why are you being so serious?<eos> What do you think I'm gonna do?

Not at your place.<eos> Are you asking me to move in with you?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I want you here all the time.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> What happened to learning to walk before we run?<eos> That's just one of the many things that we could talk about over breakfast.<eos> Can I think about it?<eos> Sure.
Yeah, right here. Now.<eos> Go on.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Don't come.<eos> Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> In the bedroom.<eos> Are you joking?<eos> Two minutes.

I believe he called it "artistic temperament."<eos> Thank you, Hannah.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...<eos> It's totally weird, i know. I know.<eos> I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?<eos> I expect you to call me Ana.<eos> And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself.<eos> And the rest of it, we'll just make up as we go, okay?<eos> Okay.
Okay.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.<eos> I should go up with you.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'll be two seconds.<eos> Take it.<eos> Hey, ros.

I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I saw you, Christian. I saw the way you were with Leila.<eos> She had a gun, Ana.<eos> I would have done anything to subdue her.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Is she here?<eos> What?<eos> No, of course not.
Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.<eos> But I'm done with it.<eos> You mean more to me than anything else.<eos> I wanna believe you. I do.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Ana, give me your hand.<eos> This is me.<eos> All of me.

He is so weird.<eos> Mom and dad are throwing him a party.<eos> Didn't they just have a party?<eos> Jeez, you're as bad as he is.<eos> That was a ball.<eos> This is just family, friends, music, fireworks.<eos> No biggie.

He's so subtle, it kills me.<eos> Stop.<eos> So you're serious.<eos> But are you happy?<eos> 'Cause that's all I care about.<eos> I mean, it's complicated, but I've never been happier.<eos> Hey, Mia, what's up?<eos> Did you hear about José's show?<eos> It was incredible.<eos> Really.

Okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we're on our way.<eos> Um, Christian's chopper went missing on the way back from Portland.<eos> They're sending out search parties right now.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> For more on this breaking story, let's go out to the field and our reporter, Rachel Taylor.<eos> Rachel?
You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.<eos> I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.<eos> And that's all i ever wanted.<eos> Turn it up.<eos> Newsreader". Christian grey and his colleague ros Bailey have been found safe and well and are, at this moment, on their way back to Seattle.<eos> What the hell are you all doing here?<eos> Christian?
I'm okay.<eos> He looks like shit, but he's in one piece.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Yeah, he does.<eos> Guys, relax. I'm fine.<eos> Come here, man.<eos> Need to say hi to my girl. Okay.<eos> Come on, mom.<eos> - I need a drink.<eos> - Me, too.

Of course.<eos> You've always known your own mind.<eos> If that man is the love of your life, you grab him with both hands.<eos> Thanks, mama.<eos> Have you called ray?<eos> Um, no, not yet.<eos> Christian did, though. He asked for his permission.<eos> He asked for your hand?<eos> That's so chivalrous.<eos> Hey.

Thank you.<eos> Ana, let me introduce to you, my good friend, Elena Lincoln.<eos> We met at the masquerade.<eos> Yes.<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Surely.<eos> She's fantastic.<eos> Ladies, gentlemen.<eos> Mia.
Thanks, Mia.<eos> But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.<eos> As most of you know, yesterday ros and I had a narrow escape.<eos> And something like that reminds us of what really matters and how important it is to seize the day.<eos> We should Cherish the people we care about and who care about us.<eos> Mom, dad, I know I haven't always been the perfect son. But I owe everything to you both, so thank you.<eos> But that's not the announcement.<eos> Ana, come up here a second, please.<eos> So, a while ago, I was lucky enough to meet this amazing young woman,<eos> Anastasia Steele.
No rock. Christian grey.<eos> Oh, my god! I have a sister!<eos> I leave you alone for a couple weeks, and this is what happens?<eos> I know! I'm sorry i didn't tell you.<eos> Oh, please. Come here.<eos> So, how does it feel to bag Seattle's most eligible bachelor?<eos> It's a little scary, but...<eos> Well, if anyone can make it work, it's you.<eos> Hey, sis-in-law!<eos> Congratulations.
I know she was important to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What's that you got there?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.<eos> Are you?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What's that you got there?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> After you.

Hang on.<eos> - We did it.<eos> - Yeah, 46th time's the charm.<eos> Can't you just enjoy it for once?<eos> Oh, so sweet of you.<eos> There's two ways we can handle this situation:<eos> the cool one, or the uncool one.<eos> Uh, c-c-cool way's good, right, Ajar?<eos> -Don't come any closer.<eos> -Or what?

-Or what?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> It's a trick question.<eos> Baby skin, baby sting.<eos> Oh, not again.<eos> I hate when this happens.<eos> You guys really suit each other.<eos> The big, bad bedwetters.<eos> If you want this watermelon, it'll be over my dead body.<eos> Okay.
-We don't belong over there.<eos> -We don't belong over here either.<eos> Come on, we're losers.<eos> No, no.<eos> Losers make fun of us.<eos> -We don't have anyone but each other.<eos> -No, no, don't do that.<eos> -Wait.<eos> What is that?<eos> -What?
Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll leave you with your family.<eos> And sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> It's dangerous over there.<eos> What do you expect to find anyway?<eos> What are you gonna do if you come across a Dustie, huh?<eos> -Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead, play deaf.<eos> -Yeah, yeah.
Do you know what those ugly snakes are like?<eos> Beggars, thieves, liars!<eos> They don't even wash, for Pete's sake!<eos> No water. Hello?<eos> I'm pretty sure they eat their own poop and marry their children.<eos> -Or maybe it's the other way around.<eos> -Are you actually saying that?<eos> Are you even aware of how lucky you are to have been born here?<eos> You've got everything. -Security, a future.<eos> -What future?
That you can sell me like it's the Middle Ages?<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> I can't stand this place anymore!<eos> I feel sick!<eos> I'm suffocating here!<eos> Oh, my God, you're crying.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did you mess up your makeup? Hey!<eos> No touchy.<eos> Ah, teenagers.
Well, the oasis belongs to the green snakes, right?<eos> I'm not planning on dying with you, you know?<eos> -You don't have to come with me. -And you're not gonna make me.<eos> No one is ever gonna make me!<eos> All right, come on, wait for me!<eos> Let's go die together!<eos> Just a little reminder for later, this is when it all started to go down in flames.<eos> Right this second.<eos> Hide.<eos> -What?
Absolutely.<eos> All right, so you're gonna go slither a little more over that way, please.<eos> Thank you, officer.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dusties! Alert!<eos> We're gonna die! We're gonna die! We're gonna die!<eos> Stop running around. You're gonna get us noticed.<eos> Stop!<eos> We're not the ones they're after.<eos> Pitt!
Thank you, officer.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dusties! Alert!<eos> We're gonna die! We're gonna die! We're gonna die!<eos> Stop running around. You're gonna get us noticed.<eos> Stop!<eos> We're not the ones they're after.<eos> Pitt!<eos> Pitt, you there?<eos> Pitt?
You--You're a Dustie? Really?<eos> I mean, yeah, of course, I am.<eos> But I've never seen you--<eos> I mean, of course I haven't, obviously, because I live here.<eos> I've never been over there, where you live.<eos> Are you new here?<eos> -How did you know?<eos> -I don't.<eos> I gotta get out of here. They're gonna kill me!<eos> Out?
-How did you know?<eos> -I don't.<eos> I gotta get out of here. They're gonna kill me!<eos> Out?<eos> Which way?<eos> I don't even know--<eos> I mean, sure, I know, but I...<eos> Watch out!<eos> Next time, watch where you're going, you big lump!<eos> Ajar? Ajar?
Which way?<eos> I don't even know--<eos> I mean, sure, I know, but I...<eos> Watch out!<eos> Next time, watch where you're going, you big lump!<eos> Ajar? Ajar?<eos> Step aside, sir.<eos> Don't worry, everything's under control.<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -I, uh... Ajar.
I mean, sure, I know, but I...<eos> Watch out!<eos> Next time, watch where you're going, you big lump!<eos> Ajar? Ajar?<eos> Step aside, sir.<eos> Don't worry, everything's under control.<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -I, uh... Ajar.<eos> Okay, Ajar. Follow me!<eos> Ooh. Ouch!
Step aside, sir.<eos> Don't worry, everything's under control.<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -I, uh... Ajar.<eos> Okay, Ajar. Follow me!<eos> Ooh. Ouch!<eos> You can't swim?<eos> How come you can't swim?<eos> How come you can swim?<eos> Ajar!
Look, I'm not going back there.<eos> I'd like to go further, you know, find out what's beyond these rocks.<eos> I can't believe I'm actually talking to a Dustie.<eos> I thought you'd be more impressive or something.<eos> Don't need any help here!<eos> -Is it true you eat your own poop?<eos> -What? No way!<eos> I mean, unless we're--<eos> -So, who's the girl?<eos> -Eva.
Don't need any help here!<eos> -Is it true you eat your own poop?<eos> -What? No way!<eos> I mean, unless we're--<eos> -So, who's the girl?<eos> -Eva.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> No trace of them, Chief Chief.<eos> They probably drowned.<eos> Okay.
No trace of them, Chief Chief.<eos> They probably drowned.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go back to the station.<eos> I'll take a last look around.<eos> They lost us.<eos> -Are you coming?<eos> - You want me to come with you?<eos> Are you afraid of freedom?<eos> Eva!
They lost us.<eos> -Are you coming?<eos> - You want me to come with you?<eos> Are you afraid of freedom?<eos> Eva!<eos> Ahh! No!<eos> -Ajar, don't!<eos> -Ajar! Help me!<eos> I'm coming, Eva! I'm coming!<eos> Ajar!
-We'll do the talking.<eos> You're here because you shouldn't be here.<eos> And why shouldn't you be here?<eos> -'Cause we're Dusties.<eos> -Exactly.<eos> Now you seem like you're a nice kid, but we have a problem.<eos> -You got in illegally.<eos> -It was a mistake.<eos> We won't do it again, ever.<eos> Right, Ajar?
-You got in illegally.<eos> -It was a mistake.<eos> We won't do it again, ever.<eos> Right, Ajar?<eos> We can't let you go.<eos> We let one go, then everyone else thinks they got a shot.<eos> You understand this, don't you?<eos> If anything happens to her, I swear, I'll-I'll--<eos> Kill them.<eos> Pitt!

Kill them.<eos> Pitt!<eos> We don't really like your kind around here.<eos> Let me go!<eos> -Ajar!<eos> -You were saying?<eos> Let him go!<eos> - Hey, could you turn it down a notch? - Put me down!<eos> My head is literally ringing over here.<eos> Thanks.
Let me go!<eos> -Ajar!<eos> -You were saying?<eos> Let him go!<eos> - Hey, could you turn it down a notch? - Put me down!<eos> My head is literally ringing over here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You should go easy on the pollen, sir.<eos> Now please go sit over there and I'll talk to your dad in a minute.<eos> What?
-Catch them.<eos> And bring that freak back alive.<eos> The sergeant?<eos> No, the worm with the rug.<eos> - Keep flying.<eos> They're after us!<eos> Keep going. Keep going.<eos> -Pitt, throw something at 'em!<eos> -What do you want me to throw?<eos> Hey, my wig!
Everyone in place now.<eos> Kick it up a notch.<eos> No pain, no gain.<eos> And bend and snap, and bend and snap.<eos> And suck it in, big girl.<eos> -Hey, the new girl's up.<eos> -Hm? Welcome!<eos> We're so happy to meet you.<eos> -I'm Lily Belle.<eos> -I'm Lulu Belle.
Hmm, you've got potential, girl.<eos> I feel like you're a bit on the chubby side.<eos> Better get into some Pilates for a while.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> You think that just anybody can get into Miss Rita's ballet company?<eos> -Oh, so it's "Miss Rita's ballet company".<eos> -Precisely.<eos> Who made dancers out of you?<eos> Who taught you everything?<eos> Him?
The company has one prima ballerina.<eos> - You just said it again. - Me.<eos> Keep that in mind and everything will be just fine.<eos> No, everything will not be just fine.<eos> It's a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> I was just slithering by and I...<eos> I can't even dance!<eos> Hello. Everything is going to be fine. George is here.<eos> -Who?

She's adorable.<eos> I see great things for you, for us.<eos> Do you... feel it?<eos> That chemistry between us?<eos> Oh, what is happening to us?<eos> A wild one.<eos> I love it.<eos> Huh.<eos> Oh, chill out, I was just kidding.<eos> Girls, really.
One of us! One of us!<eos> One of us! One of us! One of us!<eos> You guys see this?<eos> -It's...<eos> -High.<eos> Flat.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> This is a once in a lifetime experience.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Wow, funny skin.

-What do you think you're doing?<eos> -I'm not gonna let you murder us!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> What's with him?<eos> - He's asleep. - Oops.<eos> Now?<eos> Sorry, my bad.<eos> No, no!<eos> Okay, definitely not super brave.<eos> Super crazy.
Okay, definitely not super brave.<eos> Super crazy.<eos> -You almost got us killed!<eos> -I said I was sorry!<eos> How are we ever gonna find Eva now?<eos> Dude, let it go already.<eos> - The girl's off limits anyway.<eos> - Oh, yeah? -Why'd she kiss me?<eos> -I don't know. You were the exotic tourist. The kind you forget right away.<eos> Okay.

Yeah, okay, bye.<eos> We have places we need to go.<eos> Come on, up.<eos> Up.<eos> Dustie, dead ahead.<eos> Lunch break.<eos> You're here because you shouldn't be here.<eos> Great.<eos> Just great.<eos> Hey, geniuses!
I see two weird goats down here.<eos> I mean, seriously, you guys don't even know how to get out of a maze?<eos> Everyone knows how to do that.<eos> All you have to do is keep going in the same direction.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.<eos> Left.<eos> Left again.<eos> And...<eos> Mm?

Gary, where are you?<eos> - Say something!<eos> - Here!<eos> Gary?<eos> Gary, where are you?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> How are you ever gonna get me out of here now?<eos> Why didn't you warn us?<eos> Hey, you're the rescuers here, I believe.<eos> Okay.
So...<eos> - Oh, I love your voice. - Okay, enough babbling.<eos> It's time.<eos> Time?<eos> Time for what?<eos> I can't tell you to break a leg, right?<eos> Come here now.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> Okay, um... just a sec.<eos> Snakes.
You're done, girl, just like the rest of us.<eos> I don't know about you but I'd love a little break, like, a pollen break.<eos> Do you guys have some?<eos> Really?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sure it's pollen land where you're from.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> Oh! Awkward contact.<eos> No touchy.<eos> Great.

The west end, we're frickin' lost.<eos> Would you happen to have seen a camelcade around here?<eos> The camelcade path, very simple.<eos> All you need to do is follow the Pole Star.<eos> These guys were following a goat.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Thanks, Mr. "Left, left, ooh, a hole."<eos> Well, at least I wasn't following a goat.<eos> Just sit back and watch.<eos> People, lights!

The constellation is very visible...<eos> Hey, you know where we can score some pollen around here?<eos> Okay, never mind.<eos> And watch the drooling, buddy.<eos> It's kinda gross.<eos> Here, we come to Ursa Minor.<eos> See this star at the end, brighter than the others?<eos> That's the Pole Star, also known as the North Star.<eos> This is great!<eos> Yeah, super amazing.
Let's start with the welcoming song.<eos> -We're gonna go.<eos> -Yeah, let's go.<eos> Hey, I know these primitive peoples.<eos> They took us in.<eos> They're gonna feel hurt.<eos> Hey, we're gonna feel hurt!<eos> We're the dinner, peanut brain!<eos> So paranoid.<eos> So scorpion.

Hello?<eos> Wake up!<eos> Come on!<eos> Well, I guess you're gonna need someone to write your will.<eos> No way!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> No!<eos> I don't know if you're aware of this, but it's all just sand around here.<eos> Welcome to the desert.<eos> Oh.

That was... ew!<eos> You wanna see more of that?<eos> Are you into this somehow?<eos> Come on, honey, there's fresh water in the car.<eos> - Ho ho, say "cheese."<eos> - Oh, no, please, I look awful.<eos> You look great.<eos> All right! Let's go, my friends.<eos> Where did I leave my keys?<eos> Pollen.

Don't panic. Just lift up your feet.<eos> Oh, you're a bad little snake.<eos> You're a...<eos> Gary, quick, get out!<eos> Careful, my friends, don't move.<eos> Okay, everybody, now just relax.<eos> Now there's a cobra.<eos> Come back here!<eos> Got him!<eos> How exciting!

Hey! Watch it, okay?<eos> I'm pretty well trained in kung fu so you don't wanna get me mad.<eos> Dragon tail.<eos> So, have you learned your lesson?<eos> You've had enough?<eos> We've gotta find that camelcade.<eos> That's our only clue so far.<eos> We get Eva, but we don't go home without Pitt.<eos> "We get Eva, but we don't go home without Pitt."<eos> Flower, George, flower.

Again.<eos> Let's sweat it out.<eos> It took me 20 years to get it right.<eos> Twenty years?<eos> You've been locked up in here for 20 years?<eos> Yes, my dear.<eos> Dance is a demanding art form.<eos> -What about you?<eos> -Me? -It's my 11th year of success.<eos> -Eleven?

This can't be.<eos> Oh, these kids.<eos> They think everything should be handed to them on a silver platter.<eos> -I understand, you know.<eos> -Please, I need to be alone right now.<eos> Try to overlook my very good looks, my irresistible charm.<eos> I'm not just a swift-tailed string of muscles.<eos> I'm a snake like you. with a heart like yours.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> Boom, boom, boom, boom.
You did this?<eos> There was a time when I too thought the sand was shinier on the other side of the rock.<eos> But it's all just sand.<eos> - Thank you for-<eos> - Oh. - Go.<eos> Just what do you think you're doing?<eos> It ain't strolling time, miss.<eos> Well, actually, there's been a mistake.<eos> See, I shouldn't be here.<eos> Hey, Jerry.
It ain't strolling time, miss.<eos> Well, actually, there's been a mistake.<eos> See, I shouldn't be here.<eos> Hey, Jerry.<eos> "I shouldn't be here."<eos> They're all the same!<eos> Back inside.<eos> - Oh, will you just go away? - Stop!<eos> We got a wild one!<eos> Escape alert!
She's getting away!<eos> What is this?<eos> Snakes who'll end up as belts or designer shoes.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's horrible.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> I should've let you finish me off, now that I think about it.<eos> Plus you'd feel really bad right now.<eos> So you actually have two modes, huh?<eos> Crazy angry wrestler or silent antisocial.

Ask him if he ran into a camelcade.<eos> Why don't you ask him?<eos> I don't talk to stuff I don't know.<eos> Pardon me, sir.<eos> You wouldn't have come across a camelcade by any chance?<eos> You mean a camelcade heading towards Souksoukville with men, one of whom traveled with two hampers from which a green snake was dangling, attempting to escape?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> Hmm. -Nah. Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> -What?

Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> -What?<eos> How's that possible?<eos> Which way is Soukso-- whatever its name is?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were mentioning a certain city, I believe?<eos> Souksoukville?
Yes, that's it.<eos> Hmm. -Nah. Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> -What?<eos> How's that possible?<eos> Which way is Soukso-- whatever its name is?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were mentioning a certain city, I believe?<eos> Souksoukville?<eos> A little city from the 15th century protected by 18-foot fortifications with a network of streets that's been classified as UNESCO's--<eos> -Yes, yes.
A little city from the 15th century protected by 18-foot fortifications with a network of streets that's been classified as UNESCO's--<eos> -Yes, yes.<eos> Where is it? -Nah. Never heard of it.<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Come back!<eos> Well, at least we're slithering in the right direction.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So where's Souksoukville?<eos> Oh, you're such a "the glass is half-empty" kind of guy.<eos> So scorpion.
So scorpion.<eos> You've hung out with that doofus for too long.<eos> Don't you ever talk about Pitt like that.<eos> There you go again.<eos> There, an oasis!<eos> Yeah, right. I'm not falling for that.<eos> -I swear! There!<eos> -Huh?<eos> See?<eos> Right direction.
See?<eos> Right direction.<eos> -We gotta get going.<eos> -Oh, come on!<eos> Five more minutes.<eos> Look at all these blisters.<eos> I can't possibly make another move.<eos> Okay, we'll spend the night here.<eos> -We need to regain our strength.<eos> -Really? Yay!
Look at all these blisters.<eos> I can't possibly make another move.<eos> Okay, we'll spend the night here.<eos> -We need to regain our strength.<eos> -Really? Yay!<eos> The desert is ruthless.<eos> Even to its own children.<eos> Eat or be eaten.<eos> Sometimes it's a place for many. Other times, only one can survive.<eos> Ah, a real bed.
-Thousands of years old bones.<eos> -Okay, so old bones.<eos> When I think about all my girlfriends at the Death Sting concert, just how did I end up here?<eos> Maybe we should take a break, honey.<eos> It looks really fine right here.<eos> Something moved!<eos> The shoe, it moved.<eos> It could be a mongoose or a gerbil.<eos> Everyone, get behind me.<eos> Hey, you in there!
It could be a mongoose or a gerbil.<eos> Everyone, get behind me.<eos> Hey, you in there!<eos> Get out of there!<eos> See?<eos> You overreacted again, honey.<eos> You keep making a fool of yourself.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> Would you mind if we rested in your humble home for the night?<eos> Uh, I...
Good evening, sir.<eos> Would you mind if we rested in your humble home for the night?<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I can't feel my tail.<eos> This is the end.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> Well, maybe I do.<eos> Bury yourself in the sand, that'll make you feel warm.<eos> -What are you thinking about?<eos> -Pitt. And Eva.
I mean, do you know who my father is? You know.<eos> You never told me, how did you and Pitt meet?<eos> -His family was killed by the Tuaregs.<eos> -Oh. -Barbecue?<eos> Keychain?<eos> -We never knew.<eos> He got away, God knows how, and he ended up in the suburbs with us.<eos> Two losers among losers.<eos> We hit it off right away.<eos> Yeah, kinda like us.
Really?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Why don't you come with us, sweetie?<eos> Oh, that's really nice of you, but Ajar...<eos> You're a scorpion.<eos> You belong with scorpions.<eos> Leave him alone, you guys.<eos> Can't you see he's gotta go find his friend?<eos> Ew, that was so dripping with love.<eos> What?
Okay, let's get going so we can reach Souksoukville before the storm.<eos> You'll get to see the Tuaregs and their show with the dancing snakes.<eos> -Huh? -You don't want to miss that, believe me.<eos> Where did he fall this time?<eos> Gary, where on earth are you?<eos> If you got yourself into another hole, I'm gonna--<eos> Over here!<eos> Check it out!<eos> It's a fogara!<eos> Kinda like an underground river.

I take that as a yes.<eos> -Oh, boy.<eos> -Look out.<eos> - Swim!<eos> - I'm trying!<eos> Come inside!<eos> Okay, we've gotta find the man who kidnapped Eva.<eos> -Uh, Omar?<eos> -I don't know his name.<eos> Tall, skinny, scary-faced?
It's not like we crossed a whole desert and almost died, like, 26 times in horrifying ways to get here.<eos> So? Are you coming or not?<eos> Have you seen this guy?<eos> You don't stand a chance with a guy like that.<eos> So out of your league, bro.<eos> -Are you done?<eos> -Well, that depends.<eos> Are you just gonna stand there and whine or are you gonna save my sister?<eos> Did you put up with me all those miles for nothing?<eos> -Ajar?
Wait.<eos> Just hold it there.<eos> I can't hold on anymore.<eos> Who's there?<eos> What have you done?<eos> -Ajar, you came.<eos> -Let's go!<eos> Trying to escape, my cuties?<eos> Do you really think you can get away from me?<eos> You stupid worm.
I can't hold on anymore.<eos> Who's there?<eos> What have you done?<eos> -Ajar, you came.<eos> -Let's go!<eos> Trying to escape, my cuties?<eos> Do you really think you can get away from me?<eos> You stupid worm.<eos> You think your venom can hurt me?<eos> Gary!
You stupid worm.<eos> You think your venom can hurt me?<eos> Gary!<eos> As long as Omar has his flute, he controls us.<eos> Your venom runs in my veins!<eos> You're mine!<eos> No!<eos> Ah! Come back!<eos> That belongs to me.<eos> Oops.

Oh, no.<eos> Ajar.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> -Oh, please, no.<eos> -Breathe.<eos> -Ajar!<eos> -I knew it.<eos> -Oh, sorry.<eos> -Still hurts.<eos> Your skin.
-I knew it.<eos> -Oh, sorry.<eos> -Still hurts.<eos> Your skin.<eos> Pretty.<eos> That's gonna be high maintenance.<eos> You- - You crossed the desert for me?<eos> I would have crossed a thousand.<eos> -So, who's the man?<eos> -Pitt!
Pretty.<eos> That's gonna be high maintenance.<eos> You- - You crossed the desert for me?<eos> I would have crossed a thousand.<eos> -So, who's the man?<eos> -Pitt!<eos> Oh, buddy, I missed you so much.<eos> Wow.<eos> -Is this new?<eos> -Long story.
Here they are now.<eos> Thanks for getting here so quick.<eos> Why's she on the steps?<eos> She came to report, but the front desk was shut.<eos> She phoned 101 from a payphone round the corner.<eos> - Why didn't you take her in?<eos> - She didn't want to do that.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - Only got her first name. - Trish.<eos> - OK.

You called about an attack.<eos> A sexual attack.<eos> We'd like to take you somewhere we can talk. It's just a short drive away.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Well done.<eos> The car is just over here. All right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is Alec. He's my colleague.<eos> We work together. This is Trish.<eos> Hi, Trish.
Er... not yet. Something's come up.<eos> - Doesn't it always?<eos> So, look, I... I don't know when I'll be back.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Have you got Fred to bed OK?<eos> Could you er... pick up a loaf on your way home?<eos> OK.<eos> Look, kiss those boys for me and I'll try not to wake you if I'm late back, OK.<eos> I don't sleep much anyway.<eos> - Not since your mum... - Yeah, all right.
- We might not have time.<eos> If it was a stranger, others may be at risk.<eos> - Yeah, all right, I know.<eos> - Look at the calendar there.<eos> If the injuries are two days old, takes you back to Saturday.<eos> - Her mate's 50th. - Yeah.<eos> Could explain why she's reluctant to talk about it.<eos> Does anyone else have keys?<eos> Annie, a neighbour two doors down.<eos> Er... also Cath, my mate.
- You think she meant the sea?<eos> - I dunno.<eos> Why say "water" and not "waves" or "sea"?<eos> Why did she wait, Miller? Why did she not report it sooner?<eos> Why did she come home?<eos> Everyone responds differently.<eos> We've already lost... 60 hours?<eos> If the attack happened at the party, that's a long list of people to interview and eliminate and the attacker's still out there.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Ellie?

Great.<eos> - Try and rest.<eos> - Right.<eos> Look, you've got the panic alarm. Don't be afraid to use it.<eos> And you can call me any time.<eos> How am I gonna tell my daughter?<eos> Look, try not to think of that for now.<eos> OK, we're gonna take all this one step at a time and there'll be plenty of us around to support you.<eos> - Thanks. - OK.<eos> Bye, Trish.

Yes, I did.<eos> - Your personal number!
- Do they?<eos> I reckon they just like a freak show. Even...<eos> Even after three years.<eos> Why don't you go in there?<eos> It was your decision to do the book.<eos> Biggest mistake of my life.<eos> It's done more harm than good.<eos> Hello, petal. Thank you for waiting.<eos> Could you sign it to Tony, please?<eos> God's sake, Mark!
So the scene could be from here, all the way up to the house?<eos> You don't like to make things easy for us, do you?<eos> Sorry if we're inconveniencing you.<eos> We couldn't find drag marks or footprints.<eos> You might have more luck.<eos> See if you can find any evidence of her attacker having a hiding place - near the house.<eos> - Right you are.<eos> We've got preliminary fragments of blue twine or wire from the victim's wrist wounds.<eos> She was struck on the back of the head, so we're looking for anything that might have been used.<eos> Violent attack, ligature traces, possible use of a condom.
We'll let them know she won't be in for a while.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Miller?<eos> Course.<eos> How long have they been calling me Shit Face?<eos> Since you first arrived.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll put your receipt in the bag, all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Cath Atwood?
Was there a fight at the party? Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Is that not what this is about?<eos> There's been an allegation of rape.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> No.<eos> But... who? Oh, my God, who?<eos> We can't reveal details.<eos> Yeah, but I knew all the women who were there.<eos> Shit. Trish.
Why? What's the matter?<eos> What?<eos> I am so sorry. He's so sorry.<eos> - Aren't you, so sorry?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I didn't mean to press...<eos> I don't know... How do you...?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Porn!
Where did you get this?<eos> I didn't mean to press...<eos> I don't know... How do you...?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Porn!<eos> Why?<eos> It is something we're having to deal with - a lot more recently.<eos> - So it's not just him.<eos> Tom and another boy have been caught supplying links and files to a number of other students.<eos> What?
We are excluding Tom and the other student for one week.<eos> Oh, brilliant. Well done.<eos> I'm mortified and disgusted at his behaviour.<eos> - It will not happen again.<eos> - I'm sure we all understand how tough it has been for you as a family...<eos> No, no, no, don't say that.<eos> It isn't about that.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tom!
You have to be better than that.<eos> I will not have you be your father's son.<eos> This is a live situation.<eos> Prioritise this one.<eos> We absolutely cannot afford to wait.<eos> Preliminary results, whatever you can tell me, soon as you can, thank you.<eos> Sorry. Didn't mean to keep you waiting.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> Everything OK?<eos> - New case.
- Well, thanks for freaking me out.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yeah, what's up, Cath?<eos> Trish was raped at our party on Saturday night.<eos> What?<eos> But how do you know?<eos> The police have just been here.<eos> They're after the invite list.<eos> Shit. OK.
She doessn't know how to be a kid.<eos> Two nights ago she told me that even if Germany balls up the euro, there could still be worldwide depression.<eos> I was staring at the ceiling for three hours.<eos> I'm so worried.<eos> If you start crying, I will have to pretend to start crying.<eos> You know there's something you can be overlooking.<eos> This could work out.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But if anybody takes that baby away... I'll smother you in your sleep.<eos> Morning, Fred.

I'll smother you in your sleep.<eos> Morning, Fred.<eos> One plus one is two.<eos> That is fact number one of today.<eos> Who can tell me what two plus two is? Who's got it?<eos> Four.
Good. Mary, can you stand up please?<eos> Stand up on. Stand up, babe.<eos> These questions are for you, because you're so advanced.<eos> What is nine plus eight? Seventeen.<eos> Yeah, yes, it is. That's good.<eos> What is... fifteen plus seventeen?<eos> Thirty-two.<eos> Yeah, that is... That is right.<eos> Alright then. Well, what is 57 plus 135?<eos> 192.
Can you tell me... What 57 multiplied by 135 is?<eos> - Who can tell me what four... - 7695.<eos> The square root is 87.7. And change.<eos> Now what does ad nauseam mean?<eos> I have very strange kid.<eos> I have 27 strange kids.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning, good morning. That's great, guys, but take your seats, okay?<eos> Oh, God, see ya.<eos> Good morning, Miss Stevenson.
Good morning.<eos> Good morning, good morning.

What are you doing at Ferg's every Friday night?<eos> Trying to get picked up by him.<eos> Excuse me? Hi.<eos> Look it's my teacher.<eos> Probably she wants to remind me what one plus one is.<eos> Go to the car, okay?<eos> - Hi. Sorry to yell at you and then chase you down.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mary's teacher? Yes. I'm Bonnie Stevens.<eos> Frank.
For the record, I didn't wanna go to the stupid school in the first place.<eos> And the boy in the front row acts inappropriately for someonewho's a child.<eos> Sorry. I'm still passive agressively ignoring you.<eos> Other kids answer questions, they don't get in trouble.<eos> You didn't get in trouble for answering the questions.<eos> You yelled at the principle.<eos> All right, you know what? You're gonna find this interesting.<eos> So I googled "first graders who yelled at the principal"<eos> And statistically you will never believe how many kids do it.<eos> How many?

Would mom want me to go to school?<eos> I can only guess.<eos> But I will tell you that, she would have wanted you to have friends.<eos> Idiot friends?<eos> She'd want you to have compassion for others.<eos> Like a cat can have for a sandpiper.<eos> But what if they don't like me?<eos> Then they're idiots.<eos> Good morning, class.<eos> Good moring, Mrs. Stevenson.

She never showed up unannounced.<eos> She never showed up with the baby.<eos> She said she wanted to talk. She said she needed to talk.<eos> I told her I will talk to her when I got back.<eos> I think I figured showing up late to my date would hurt my chances of gettin' laid.<eos> Came home that night and Mary was on the couch... and found Diane on the bathroom floor.<eos> I mean, there's no way I could've known, but...<eos> I shoulda known.<eos> 6 and a half years later me and Mary are still hangin' out.<eos> And what about the father?

Diane was so socially akward...<eos> She didn't date enough to know a good guy from a bad guy.<eos> This particular guy didn't last for month.<eos> And no grandparents?<eos> Dad died when I was eight. My mom...<eos> She went virgin and she turn back on Diane when she got pregnant.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't fit into her plan.<eos> She is exacting woman, my mother.<eos> Uncompromising.

By far. It was awesome.<eos> Come on. A little harder.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> There's a lady standing in front of our door.<eos> Who is it?<eos> How should I know?<eos> I'm seven.<eos> That would be your grandmother.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> An Apple?
Who is it?<eos> How should I know?<eos> I'm seven.<eos> That would be your grandmother.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> An Apple?<eos> It's a MacBook, darling.<eos> Top of the line with the Retina display.<eos> You know who else has a Retina display?<eos> Fred!
Yeah. Love that book.<eos> You're saying you've read it?<eos> Yeah, I've kinda moved on to differential equations now.<eos> Don't forget your manners.<eos> Thank you, grandma.<eos> Thank you, grandma.<eos> Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.<eos> There's so much more on there. Things I know you'll find really challenging.<eos> Yes, but sadly it's a school night and there's homework to do.<eos> What a surprise though, right?

Is there a God?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I would if I could.<eos> But I don't know. Neither does anybody else.<eos> Roberta knows.<eos> No.<eos> Roberta has faith... and that's the great thing to have.<eos> But faith's about what you think, feel. Not what you know.<eos> What about Jesus?
Use your head.<eos> But don't be afraid to believe in things habit.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only thing different between the things you saw on TV and Roberta is Roberta loves you. She tries to help.<eos> Tell you what though. When we all one another, we all end up back together at the end.<eos> That's what you're asking, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Find something else to worry about, will ya?<eos> All right.<eos> Okay. Adler, grandmother and uncle.
You couldn't even find the white lawyer.<eos> - Don't worry, okay?<eos> - Don't tell me that.<eos> There's nothing you can say that's make me fell good... because I have no say in any of this, Frank.<eos> I'm not a blood relative, I'm not a legal guardian.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> Just the lady who lives next door, whose opinion means nothing, whose feelings means nothing.<eos> Would I like to have Mary tonight?<eos> I'd like to have Mary every night.<eos> Hi.

Hi.<eos> I heard Davis bragging about a custody case... and the I found out who's and I am...<eos> I feel terrible.<eos> But I also wanted you to know that after we talked... I didn't say anything to anyone.<eos> I swear.<eos> And it's important to me that you know that.<eos> I know.<eos> My lawyer told me to get drunk.<eos> And you trying to do it with that?<eos> Okay. My turn.
I'll go with... Mona from Who's the boss?<eos> - You know what I'm talking about?<eos> - The sexy grandmother. - Yeah!<eos> I always felt like she had a secret.<eos> Yeah, which is that she loved sexual intercourse.<eos> That was it.<eos> And she wasn't secret about it.<eos> That's why I liked her.<eos> You know what? I liked her too.<eos> Least favourite student. And why.
Okay. Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll take you home. Yeah.<eos> I can't find my DVD.<eos> It's right there, baby.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You come and find it. I'm doing lady business.<eos> And you were the last person to watch it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Good morning, Miss Stevenson.
You come and find it. I'm doing lady business.<eos> And you were the last person to watch it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Good morning, Miss Stevenson.<eos> Hi.<eos> Look, I am... You know what? i'm actually incapable... of having this conversation right now.<eos> Good, good. Cause I have no idea what I was going to say.<eos> Great! Perfect!<eos> Sir, if you please. Take me to jail.<eos> Awkward.
Look.<eos> These are Millennium problems.<eos> Seven great and meaningful problems.<eos> Some mathematicians have worked their entire lives to prove them.<eos> Who's the dude with the beard? That's not a dude.<eos> That's Grigori Perelman.<eos> He proved Poincare conjecture.<eos> The only one of the seven proved.<eos> This is your mother's problem.<eos> Na...vi... Navier - Stokes.
I'm not mad, I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, darlin'. With that pompes ass, Shankland.<eos> I knew that guy was gonna have a beard, before we even went in there.<eos> Math teachers like to grow beards.<eos> I should never have agreed to this.<eos> Did he reallly expect you to just walk in and be able to dissect... some random massive problem?<eos> Not much to dissect, if you ask me. Why?<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> It was wrong.<eos> What?
Well...for starters, he forgot the negative sign on the exponent.<eos> It went downhill from there.<eos> The problem was unsolvable.<eos> Maybe this school isn't as great as you think it is.<eos> Mary, you knew that the problem was incorect, why didn't you say anything?<eos> Frank says I'm not supposed to correct older people.<eos> Nobody like a smart-ass.<eos> I'm loaded with swag!<eos> Wanna come inside?<eos> Cat.
By the time I heard about Diane... passing... the baby was gone already.<eos> Well, did you try and find her?<eos> Best I could. I couldn't just go and search the entire country.<eos> Do you use a computer at work?<eos> Sure.<eos> You know what? Help me out.<eos> Let's google "Mary Adler" and see what we find.<eos> You know what? You better add her middle name.<eos> It'll narrow it down.<eos> Eillen.

Second hit.
The man who shot Liberty Mutual.<eos> That's what I've been calling him.<eos> That's really, really funny.<eos> Take her to the airport.<eos> Go home, Evelyn. Or Montana.<eos> Rustle some cattle.<eos> I have no desire to hurt you.<eos> I hate it that we're at odds.<eos> We're always at odds.<eos> Yes.
Why did you have to tell her that Ted was testifying?<eos> Because it's the truth. And if I didn't, Evelyn would've.<eos> If I was the dad of a little girl and I never saw her... and I was in the same town... I woull visit her.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy.<eos> He didn't even need directions. He could've followed you here.<eos> Speaking of man who aren't worth a damn.<eos> Doesn't even wanna see what I look like.<eos> All right. Put your shoes on.<eos> We're going for a ride.<eos> You too.
This happy? This happy.<eos> Who came out and told everybody?<eos> I did.<eos> Can we stay for another?<eos> Mrs. Adler, in your earlier testimony here today... you painted a pretty dim picture of your son. Don't you think?<eos> I'm under oath.<eos> I take no pleasure in it.<eos> So, your son is failer in life, your daughter took her life.<eos> You know, you're oh for two.<eos> - Objection!

If I got one for three, I'm in the Hall of Fame.<eos> You know baseball.<eos> Fanway Park.
My husband has season tickets.<eos> And how long has he had them?<eos> 30 years. But I've only been married to him for 20.<eos> And Diane never went to one game?<eos> What color was the dress Diane wore to prom?<eos> Diane didn't attend the prom, Because she didn't attend the highschool.<eos> No prom.

I used to want to save the world. This beautiful place.<eos> But I knew so little then.<eos> It is a land of magic and wonder. Worth cherishing in every way.<eos> But the closer you get... the more you see the great darkness shimmering within.<eos> And mankind?

Worth cherishing in every way.<eos> But the closer you get... the more you see the great darkness shimmering within.<eos> And mankind?<eos> Mankind is another story altogether.<eos> What one does when faced with the truth.. Is more difficult than you think.<eos> I learned this the hard way.<eos> A long long time ago.<eos> And now... I will never be the same.<eos> Yeah..<eos> Hello, Diana.

When Zeus led the gods to our defence...<eos> Ares killed them one by one... until only Zeus himself remained.<eos> Zeus used the last of his power to stop Ares... striking such a blow, the god of war was forced to retreat.<eos> But Zeus knew... that one day Ares might return to finish his mission. An endless war... where mankind would finally destroy themselves... and us with them.<eos> So Zeus, left us a weapon.<eos> One powerful enough to kill a god.<eos> With his dying breath, Zeus created this island... to hide us from the outside world... Somewhere Ares could not find us.<eos> And all has been quiet ever since.<eos> We give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.<eos> And the God Killer?

And all has been quiet ever since.<eos> We give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.<eos> And the God Killer?<eos> The God Killer?<eos> The weapon that is strong enough to kill a God.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> The Gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.<eos> This great tower.. is where we keep them.<eos> The God Killer.
And that's not you, Diana.<eos> You see? You are safe... and there is nothing you should concern yourself with.<eos> You keep doubting yourself, Diana.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yes.<eos> You do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You Arestronger than you believe.<eos> You have greater powers than you know.<eos> - But if you don't try harder...<eos> - Diana!
Five times harder... ten times harder.<eos> Until she's better than even you.<eos> But she must never know the truth... about what she is... or how she came to be.<eos> Harder.<eos> You are stronger than this, Diana.<eos> Again.<eos> Never let your guard down.<eos> You expect the battle to be fair.<eos> A battle will never be fair.<eos> Anti­ope!
You're bleeding.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> - Wait, Diana.<eos> What had I done?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Where did this fog come from?<eos> There...<eos> Go forward.<eos> There he is!<eos> - The pilot!
Yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> Do I not look like one?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Temiscira.<eos> What?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm one of the good guys and those are the bad guys.<eos> What?<eos> The German.
