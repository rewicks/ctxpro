So you do the math. Marco.<eos> Polo.<eos> Let me tell you something, Mr. Jackson.<eos> If he thinks that he's gonna take my son away from me just because...<eos> Frankie.<eos> Frankie.<eos> Frankie.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Did you see where my little boy was that was right here?<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't know the number.<eos> Lock her in.<eos> Lock her in!<eos> Do it, Rys.<eos> Do what he says.<eos> Do exactly what he says.<eos> Come on!<eos> What kind of man shoots an innocent child?<eos> You have no idea what kind of man I am.<eos> Oh, but I do.
What's going on with you?<eos> Man, he loves you.<eos> But no matter how much he looked for food in there, he never found anything.<eos> And he looked.<eos> A lot.<eos> Summer's ending.<eos> Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.
Come in. Please.<eos> Wow.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, Polly... you look great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will! Thanks.
- I don't care!<eos> - Just say I do.<eos> - Last chance Jack.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Surely..<eos> - This is not legal.<eos> - This is not legal.<eos> He's right.<eos> Does any man here object to the nuptials?<eos> - I do. - Congratulations.
Purchase dates, they were fake;<eos> Shares, they were fake;<eos> Options, they were fake;<eos> Returns, they were fake.<eos> So when was the last trade you executed?<eos> 15 years ago.<eos> Attorney: Who else knew?<eos> I acted alone.<eos> Investigator: When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme?<eos> He didn't.
Options, they were fake;<eos> Returns, they were fake.<eos> So when was the last trade you executed?<eos> 15 years ago.<eos> Attorney: Who else knew?<eos> I acted alone.<eos> Investigator: When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme?<eos> He didn't.<eos> And the entire time he was running it, you had no idea?<eos> - No, I didn't. - Cacioppi:
- Five.<eos> - How many bathrooms?<eos> - Seven.<eos> - How many acres? - Seven.<eos> - Did it have a swimming pool?<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> - Did it have a tennis court?<eos> - It did not.<eos> - Did it have a pond?<eos> - Yes, it did.
You couldn't have picked a better place.<eos> The village where he was born was over there.<eos> Too bad it took this to get him home.<eos> Batman asked me to be in the Justice League.<eos> And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.<eos> Good one, Z. Too right, they do.
The cage just moved.<eos> I thought we were gonna drop for a moment.<eos> Are you girls okay?<eos> No, I think the cage just dropped a little bit.<eos> No, it's the winch mechanism.<eos> It's-it's fine.<eos> It just slipped a little bit.<eos> Uh, no, I think we want to come back up now.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We don't.
"Surrounded by clouds.<eos> Good for you."<eos> "That's where the rainbows hide."<eos> These are the worst.<eos> I hate optimistic people.<eos> They bum me out with their upbeat attitude.<eos> All they ever do is make me feel more alone.<eos> Are you real?<eos> So, why did you quit writing?<eos> I didn't.
A couple of months ago, somebody poisoned our dogs.<eos> So out on the highway.<eos> those trucks?<eos> Who knows.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay.<eos> They are like dinosaures with that 20 tonns body and tiny little brains.<eos> And all tastes like shit too.<eos> Why do people eat?<eos> The don't.
(DOG PANTING)<eos> (DOG BARKING)<eos> (WATER RUNNING) Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> (WHIMPERS) ANDY:<eos> You want anything special for dinner tomorrow night?<eos> Maybe I'll roast a chicken.<eos> 18.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> Sure it does.
If you kill a cat you can prove that you know which rules are fake.<eos> And they'll all know you're becoming smarter.<eos> You really think so?<eos> We have to be brave.<eos> We have to kill our neighbor's cat.<eos> The tabby.<eos> But that kitty likes me.<eos> That'll make it easier to catch.<eos> I did very good work today.<eos> I did many kitties and many doggies.
- Promise me.<eos> - I promise. - No...<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> - Promise me!<eos> - I promise, I promise.<eos> Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.
I mean, the TV's still working.<eos> Hey, mom, um...<eos> It's been a super weird day here and I just would love to be able to talk to you.<eos> So if you can give me a call.<eos> The only channels that aren't working are the news shows.<eos> Riley, this is starting to freak me out.<eos> I know, I don't get it at all.<eos> If it were a plague, where are all the bodies?<eos> I mean, if it were aliens, where are the ships?<eos> I don't...
Two heroic statues made by the same artist, just a couple years apart.<eos> And yet they represent completely different visions of what a hero looks like.<eos> I need to borrow your computer tonight.<eos> Hey, Ercole...<eos> Come, that's enough for today.<eos> I want you to meet somebody.<eos> You did very good.<eos> You remember my sister, you met her at my wedding.<eos> Stefania... Do you remember me?<eos> - No, you don't - no.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
That's just what you're like.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie, so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions, with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Well, who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> My God, he knows you!<eos> No, he doesn't.
"Faith, I can stand it no longer, I've confessed to my crimes.<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> Why would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.
No.<eos> Good.<eos> Say that for me.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I don't want to die.<eos> And again.<eos> I don't... want to die.<eos> Once more, for luck.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.
Why are you doing this to me?<eos> ! Why are you making fun of me?<eos> Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.<eos> Softer, Sherlock.<eos> Molly, this is for a case.<eos> It's... it's a sort of experiment.<eos> I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.<eos> No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.<eos> We're friends, but, please, just say those words for me.<eos> Please don't do this.
Red door.<eos> Any drugs or medications?<eos> Have you taken anything?<eos> Case file.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Ma'am, do you know this man?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Wait a minute.<eos> There's something else.<eos> "COOPER/COOPER."<eos> Two Coopers.<eos> We came out to join you, Diane, while Albert's indisposed.<eos> Gordon.<eos> Whoa.<eos> We used to smoke together, way back when.<eos> You remember?<eos> Yeah, we sure did, Gordon.

Which is... where?<eos> uh... can't really get there from here.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Now it's time to go.<eos> if you...<eos> - You really need to leave.<eos> This is just a practice sword.<eos> It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.
Ha! Certainly was quite the entrance.<eos> - While you weren't necessarily wrong...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> There was probably a better way for you to win those people over than swinging your 51%-shareholder dick around.<eos> when you put it like that.<eos> So... why did you give Jeri that bowl?<eos> Dredged up so many old memories... pushed down.<eos> Locked away.<eos> - That make any sense?<eos> it does.
I'll drop by later.<eos> noodle place you like on 6th Street.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> you're my daughter.<eos> That place opened up last year.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> My... my dead father's been spying on me?<eos> I think you need a little rest.<eos> Why did you frame Danny?<eos> I didn't.
Do you not say grace before eating?<eos> Thank you, o lord, for these bounteous gifts received from your table.<eos> In the name of our savior, Jesus Christ, our lord.<eos> Amen.<eos> Do either of you work?<eos> Must cost a lot to maintain this house.<eos> We're both retired.<eos> The extra money from the room comes in very handy for daily things.<eos> Did you take your pills, dear?<eos> Yes, I did.
Were we expecting you today?<eos> - I've just, uh...<eos> - Will you take something?<eos> I'm... but thanks.<eos> Did he give you coffee?<eos> Glad to see you've cheered up.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yesterday. You seemed all down in the dumps.<eos> I'm amazed you noticed.<eos> We all did.
Fuck.<eos> Oh, God damn.<eos> Here's your ice.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't get to the cops faster.<eos> Oh, it's totally cool.<eos> - Sorry we didn't get you out of here.<eos> - Well, sure tried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Wow, that's cool.<eos> You made our asses look good.<eos> That's 'cause I'm hot shit.<eos> Well, your hot shit came out of our lame asses.<eos> I just wanted to give you the good news.<eos> And, so, later, just swing by my office, okay?<eos> Yes!<eos> Well... congrats, Mickey.<eos> Thanks. I know you don't mean that, but, whatever.<eos> No, I do. Seriously.
I want to tell him about us.<eos> And then, he's gonna leave you, and you and I can get back to making this work, okay?<eos> This is the story we're gonna tell our kids.<eos> "Your mom was dating a loser, and I...<eos> I came after her.<eos> I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.<eos> You want someone who is gonna fight for you!<eos> No, Dustin, I don't.

Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.
Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.<eos> We all do.
They are ugly filled with hatred weak Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing.<eos> And for what?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> They deserved to burn!<eos> Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
- I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> - The noise, it moved, she moved further, further than before, and I followed her to the stairs and, and then she pushed me.<eos> The wall, a hand came from the wall, and it pushed me down.<eos> It sounds like a great entry into your dream journal, Claire, but I want to know the truth.<eos> - That is the truth.<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - What, know?<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - Did i...<eos> - Because I do, now.
- You do?<eos> - Make no mistake... you committed an unforgivable offense the other night at the Ivy Social Club.<eos> The victim's father's been a good friend to the mayor.<eos> But fortunately for you, I'm a man in ample possession of the power to broker absolution.<eos> The only question is, will you do what's necessary to earn my largesse?<eos> Mr. Gunns, I wanna apologize for what happened.<eos> You've given me encouragement and wisdom and a helping hand, and I just want you to know that what they're saying about me is not true.<eos> I did not pull a gun on Chips Henderson and definitely didn't rob him.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
All we're doing is trying to make music, I swear!<eos> We let you do the music because we trusted you!<eos> How are we supposed to trust you now?<eos> Stay the fuck away or you might get hurt.<eos> And who's gonna hurt little old me, huh? - You?<eos> - My tio, Papa Fuerte, okay?<eos> He can take you out like that.<eos> - So, don't test me, Shao!<eos> - Yeah, you know what I heard today?<eos> That nigga old, he done for.
That is how i usually eat, actually.<eos> She'll turn up, Mr. gallo.<eos> She will.<eos> Have you, um...<eos> Talked to ginnie's mom?<eos> No. I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.<eos> I don't want to worry her.<eos> Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.<eos> I mean, maybe she knows where she is.<eos> And what if she doesn't?
I got it, I got it.<eos> Dude... okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hang on to that.<eos> There he is, come here.<eos> Buddy!<eos> I missed you so much!<eos> You been feeding my dog?<eos> Pedigree, lamb and rice blend, he loves that shit.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You're as bad as your da.<eos> My father cast my mother into madness, then jumped in straight after.<eos> He's scarcely a man to follow.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.
For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> ~ And we have plenty of time.<eos> ~ No.<eos> No, we don't.
Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> ~ And we have plenty of time.<eos> ~ No.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> ~ I would never have thought...<eos> ~ But you don't think.<eos> Do you?
Wait. Wait.<eos> So I'm still alive because I'm your sister but what's gonna happen to Ezra?<eos> Well, he's not family, so...<eos> Enjoy his company while you can.<eos> I think that you and I are gonna be the closest of all.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.<eos> No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did. - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
I say, we grab it.<eos> Just because you two have some kind of plans.<eos> Not just us.<eos> We have all worked every night for the last six weeks.<eos> I'm using "worked" in the broadest sense, including not only our show, but your cooking show and helping you to pick out a cat, and while we all appreciate the food and we love Mr. Swizzleboots,<eos> We're just asking for one night off.<eos> Well... not quite sure what to say.<eos> Just thought the crepes would be a special treat, but... we... we don't have to have 'em.<eos> Not if people don't want them.<eos> No, we do.
No, moving on, we broke up is the point.<eos> While we were still at university.<eos> And not long after she formed a relationship with my best friend.<eos> And I wrote them both a very nasty letter.<eos> And recently I've been working under the assumption that they'd had a child together shortly before my best friend committed suicide.<eos> But now it appears that the mother of that child wasn't my ex-girlfriend, but it was her mother. And I can only assume that it was my horrible letter that in some way pushed the friend...<eos> Emma: Hello again, Tony.<eos> Emma.<eos> Oh, hi, Emma.<eos> How we doing?
Yeah, you may have mentioned that before.<eos> You know...<eos> I don't get it, Roy.<eos> What?<eos> Well, her own son doesn't seem to care that they're missing.<eos> Everybody else at American Atheists are pretending like nothing's happened.<eos> What makes you different?<eos> You have any idea what it's like to grow up black and gay in Texas?<eos> Um, no.<eos> Neither did Madalyn.
It's time for North Salem to have a GSA.<eos> My old school had one, and most schools in Oregon do, so don't think I'm asking for some kind of fringe thing or whatever.<eos> Well, look, I-I'm proud of you... uh, that you have spoken your mind.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Your mom has raised a fine young man.<eos> But we've considered a GSA in the past, and the board's unanimous decision has always been that it's more of a social hour and not a formal club... that the district should fund.<eos> Well, then, we need to vote again.<eos> I was never part of that.<eos> I was with Howie when he did the research on how many schools actually have it,<eos> - and the overwhelming majority do.
- You should be in class.<eos> Was it the night of the lacrosse game?<eos> You saw the lightning, the men, and the horses?<eos> Dozens of them.<eos> Then what?<eos> It was chaos.<eos> They were everywhere.<eos> Some of the kids were running. But for everyone else it, it was like there was nothing there.<eos> They couldn't see a thing.<eos> We did.
No one can fight them.<eos> Douglas can.<eos> Does he need to stay in there?<eos> He's still Theo.<eos> Theo saved Scott.<eos> Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.<eos> Then he can hear me say he needs to shut up so we can figure out how to fight the Ghost Riders.<eos> You don't need to figure it out.<eos> Because Douglas already did.
On your knees.<eos> We need Parrish.<eos> So, wait a sec.<eos> So, this woman "Lenore,"<eos> she conjured up her dead son?<eos> She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.<eos> And you saw this kid?<eos> We all did.
Benji, I thought you'd never ask.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> The only reason the fbi recruited us...<eos> Recruited you.<eos> Is because we are the very best at what we do,<eos> And we didn't get to be that way. By taking orders from other people.<eos> Well, margot...<eos> We don't need margot.<eos> If justine wants us to take down this smuggling ring...<eos> Which she emphatically does not.
They ran the names patrick murphy. And the optican group through vicap for me, And the optican group is a front for the southland drug cartel.<eos> What?<eos> My god.<eos> So, the kincaids were selling drugs for the southland cartel?<eos> And hiding the money in an account with tommy's name on it?<eos> If whoever killed the kincaids was after that money...<eos> They're gonna come after tommy next.<eos> I'm calling him right now.<eos> Does alice know you're here?<eos> No. She doesn't.
I'm not an orphan!<eos> Isn't that right, Mum?<eos> Baptize her.<eos> I'm Dorothy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> She doesn't understand you.<eos> Well, she may not understand me, but she seems to know you.<eos> Well, at least somebody does.
Who are you?<eos> My name is Jane.<eos> Where's Tip?<eos> - Tip? - My friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were quite alone when we found you.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> She wouldn't have left me.<eos> Well, she might have thought you were dead.<eos> We did.
Jack?<eos> Jack, it's me.<eos> It's Tip.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - No, don't touch me.<eos> I can't believe it's really you.<eos> Why didn't you help me?<eos> I thought I'd killed you.<eos> So you just got on with it and left me to die?<eos> But you didn't.
Where's Randall?<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Father.<eos> I-I heard him barking in my dreams, but when I woke, he...<eos> The dog is dead.<eos> Father, he died when I was a child.<eos> No, no, I heard him!<eos> He's here.<eos> I heard him. Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.
And did she?<eos> Her words were false.<eos> I want nahara free too.<eos> And I have the power to do it.<eos> What do you want from her?<eos> The stone giants.<eos> The eternal warriors.<eos> To stop glinda permanently.<eos> It took magic to raise them, and the wizard doesn't have any.<eos> But nahara does, doesn't she?
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> You are not a compromise to me.<eos> I do not regret what I did, no matter the consequences.<eos> And I didn't want you to have any reason to think that I did.<eos> Her family has the ability to do that, to manipulate your creditors so easily?<eos> Creditors respond to money.<eos> And they respond to influence.<eos> Her family has both.<eos> I understand.<eos> But... so does mine.
Instead he dies a hero, in the same operation as brave Americans.<eos> I bet in the next few days, the Queen and the Princesses will be on a ship from New Zealand for Washington to represent us.<eos> That's the way Mayhew works.<eos> The long game.<eos> Well then, with men like that, how did you ever lose the war?<eos> Perhaps we didn't.<eos> Just the battle.<eos> Does your son want to be a policeman?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he does.
Um, uh, I moved to Oregon.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We did it!<eos> Thanks for coming. Thank you.<eos> - Nice play.<eos> You're Jake, right?<eos> I'm Lenny. - I really dug the play.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> I work at LDM on the future lit side if you got a screenplay.<eos> I-I do, yeah.
By all means.<eos> When you jab, you leave that front leg wide open.<eos> No, I'm angled away. It's safe.<eos> Not if he steps over the left foot.<eos> Right?<eos> Hey, Alvey.<eos> Alvey:<eos> I got a class. Catch you guys later.<eos> Hey, Lisa tell you I'm on the card?<eos> Yeah, she did.
It's very hot.<eos> [Chuckles] But you... you... You have to watch that.<eos> Everything they say will sound like a royal decree.<eos> It makes you feel too stupid to talk.<eos> He's not like that.<eos> He's from Manchester.<eos> It's kind of, like, a rough area.<eos> Well, good.<eos> I don't want you to feel inferior.<eos> [Glass thuds] I don't.
Sir, can we get two shots of añejo?<eos> No, no, I'm good.<eos> The good shit up top?<eos> Come on.<eos> Before you go, before you go... You want to play a game of chance?<eos> What's the game?<eos> What's the game?<eos> You sure you want to know my game?<eos> Oh, you don't even have one.<eos> No, I do.
Oh, when is he gonna get here?<eos> - (sighs) - (scoffs) We're in a small village in the mountains of rural China.<eos> He had to take, like, five forms of transportation to get here!<eos> Relax.<eos> He's here.<eos> Now there's a good chance we're going all the way, and I'm talking the College World Series.<eos> That has never happened for this school.<eos> All we need is a little more cash to improve our training facilities, and we'll bring home that trophy.<eos> Plus... did I mention... how incredibly hot you look today?<eos> - You did.
(sighs)<eos> Look, I just wanted to make sure that... you knew what was going on with Emmett. I... I don't know if anyone called you.<eos> Why would anyone call me?<eos> He O.D.'d.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - He's okay.<eos> He said it was a mistake, but... (sighs) he was at the hospital and he, like, escaped or something, and we thought that he might be on his way back to L.A.<eos> He had mentioned that he has a bunch of, like, film festivals and meetings coming up.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that, but you know Emmett and I broke up two months ago, right?<eos> No, I... I didn't.
I know that it was either my mother's or my aunt's, but I can't remember which.<eos> I, uh... I just... I know that there was a, uh, an access to an attic in one of the rooms, and Taylor and I used to go up there.<eos> We would, uh, set up our mad scientist lab and, you know, mix together potions and all that.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> You made an unholy mess up there.<eos> Well, we were mad scientists.<eos> Uh, the attic access was in your aunt Lila's room.<eos> This was Maggie's.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Yes, I did.
We've got your mother's house as collateral this time.<eos> You really want poor Mommy to lose her home?<eos> All the work I do, I'll just get another one in six months.<eos> Oh, so you are going to skip.<eos> I'm joking.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> You're going to New York.<eos> - Max Peron?<eos> - How you doing, Max?
Don't touch it!<eos> Give it back to me!<eos> Get the tool box!<eos> Open it up and look inside.<eos> Here.<eos> Let him go!<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Try this.<eos> No!<eos> Don't do that!
-All right, you got it.<eos> There you go. [laughs]<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Whoa! That was freaking amazing.<eos> Was it?<eos> Or was it fucking amazing?<eos> That was fucking amazing.<eos> Like... I thought I was gonna die!<eos> But you didn't, did you?
What was the crime?<eos> Suicide.<eos> You were there.<eos> You saw her.<eos> You should publish this.<eos> Oh, no. No way.<eos> This does not leave the safe space.<eos> People need to see this.<eos> It will change them.<eos> No, they don't.
Mr. Ramos asked me to get more dry erasers for the white board.<eos> They suspend you?<eos> Three days.<eos> I told you they were doing a bag check.<eos> Why didn't you hide it?<eos> Anyway.<eos> Didn't realize you were such a stoner, Clay.<eos> I didn't realize you cared.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Of course I don't.
Since the party.<eos> That's a long time.<eos> Could have come over any time.<eos> Your dad hates me.<eos> He does not.<eos> Last summer he told me I was trouble, and that I'd better toe the line. That's just a thing he says to guys.<eos> You got it way easier than Alex.<eos> With the hair.<eos> So, he didn't like Alex either.<eos> Well, he kind of did.
- I really do.<eos> - You know what people will say?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Because it's easy for you, right?<eos> Because you're not the class slut.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Everybody says it!<eos> - I don't say it.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I get it.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> - Or I can wait.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> - OK.<eos> I don't wanna be here.<eos> You know, I have pride like you.<eos> And I love Flo.<eos> You know, we both did.<eos> Do.
No.<eos> As a token of my gratitude, I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.<eos> Now, I don't think I have to worry about this. But who knows how truly smart you are?<eos> No sex.<eos> That is a grave no-no.<eos> However, you can have a little dinner, some drinks, share a few laughs.<eos> There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good to make you feel human again.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about that.<eos> D-d-did you say "wives," meaning plural?<eos> Hell yes, I did.
It's not gonna hold.<eos> There it goes!<eos> Split them off into smaller groups.<eos> The barriers might hold.<eos> You take slide, I take Ferris wheel?<eos> Or we could just go.<eos> - You want to go? - Nah.<eos> We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing? !
And something else happened because we have done nothing to stop them.<eos> We've done nothing!<eos> Nothing.<eos> I was in a camp when it started.<eos> It was huge... endless... a city of... of tarps and latrines and wood smoke and babies crying.<eos> There were always babies crying.<eos> I knew they had problems, but I didn't think they were mine to solve.<eos> I thought there were stronger or smarter people there than me.<eos> W-Who the hell am I, right?<eos> So I did nothing.
What do you want?<eos> I want you to sit.<eos> Hey, Cyndie.<eos> You promised.<eos> Yeah. I did.<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
Don't.<eos> "Don't" what?<eos> Don't go.<eos> Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life, Sasha.<eos> You are gonna help make sure things get back on track today.<eos> You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.<eos> No one's gonna wanna watch you die.<eos> I don't wanna see that.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> But someone does.
These things always take longer than they should.<eos> Ryan?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Why haven't they offered yet?<eos> Sean Shelby's traveling.<eos> Well, then just talk to somebody else.<eos> I'm not going to call them.<eos> It looks weak.<eos> Lisa, all due respect, you said that I was gonna have leverage.<eos> And you do.
You can't.<eos> Let's investigate this a little further before you start to panic.<eos> You're gonna see Dr. Amato at UCLA, and we'll get to the bottom of this.<eos> In the meantime, stay off the Internet.<eos> Try to relax.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You want a Xanax? - Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> Jesus.<eos> How you doing, sir?
Take care, Nicole.<eos> What's up?<eos> The fuck's that?<eos> Protein powder?<eos> Did you tell Dom he could sell that in my gym? No.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What am I talking about?<eos> You didn't see the fucking gigantic stand<eos> - right by the door right there?<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Me?<eos> - Mm-hmm. I have $400 right here, cash.<eos> [Scoffs] The agency takes $300, baby.<eos> - I'm not fucking for $100.<eos> - It's all I got.<eos> There's an ATM down the street. - An ATM?<eos> - Mm-hmm, with money.<eos> Oh, fuck, man.<eos> [Whispers] I want to.<eos> - You do? - I do.
Good call.<eos> You ever think about how they never put the morgue on the top floor of a hospital?<eos> I notice stuff like that.<eos> It's always in the basement.<eos> It's like... its own elevator.<eos> And... how does that make you feel?<eos> Huh?<eos> No. You asked me how I define the person called me.<eos> And I'm saying, I'm always having thoughts of...<eos> What do ya?
Not only does he hide the trump card, he rubs our faces in it with a burro.<eos> I bet he was all sweetness and cream when you talked to him.<eos> Well, actually, you know what?<eos> It felt kind of good.<eos> We really...<eos> We talked, and I think we got past it.<eos> What do you...<eos> No.<eos> Just...<eos> No, you didn't...
But I did.<eos> And Ray, like I said, he was a chubby kid.<eos> 15 years old, never been laid, never even felt up a girl, so... I let it slip.<eos> How this car, well... It's like a magnet, isn't it?<eos> Like catnip for kitty cats, and if you turn up to school Monday in this thing, well, it's a done deal.<eos> And now, he's begging me.<eos> "Emmit, please, take the damn stamps, give me the car."<eos> What's that old quote, that...<eos> "The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."<eos> How did you?
I thought I was on a roll.<eos> Maybe.<eos> This is it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> We've got four hours.<eos> Phone records.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Doesn't matter where we got it.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
This is all I have left.<eos> And I am begging you.<eos> This is PJ's legacy.<eos> If we don't give it to the world, like he intended... then I have nothing.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll help you find the meeting spot... but then I'm out.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Hey. Did the inspector come?<eos> No.<eos> What if he did?
We thought it only appropriate that we allow him a statement.<eos> My, great-grandfather was not a good man.<eos> That's right.<eos> But he was a great one.<eos> Come on.<eos> Eli Harris built this town from nothing with little more than his bare hands.<eos> His name is carved into the cornerstone of the very building we are sitting in right now.<eos> Should we be surprised that he had flaws?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What great man doesn't?
Regis scared him by telling him about the video.<eos> I want to know who he came running to about it.<eos> We have a fucking problem.<eos> Do you know that somewhere in this building there is a shipment of Justin Bieber wigs?<eos> I'm not mocking your being bald.<eos> You're always so fucking amused.<eos> We all make choices.<eos> Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know I killed that hacker chick?<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> She does.
300, with the ability to engage 36 of them at any one time.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm free to go?<eos> You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
The guy that I made the videos with.<eos> And he'll confirm what you're saying?<eos> That it was just a loan for travel.<eos> Sekou?<eos> Is what I say here really privileged?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> One-hundred percent?<eos> Because I don't want to mess him up.<eos> He wanted me to meet some guy before I went to Africa...<eos> Saad did.
I expected to hear from you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> - Is this about the bomb?<eos> - No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her...<eos> Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
He needs me.<eos> I know he does.<eos> You know what they're calling it--<eos> "Escape From New York."<eos> Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location." Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?<eos> - We didn't.
And what did captain Keane do?<eos> He ran past me. He was shouting.<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Get out of my fucking way!<eos> Some men run towards the fight.<eos> Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> Dar Adal's handiwork.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
So what else is new?<eos> Well, Mossad wasn't acting alone.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> They had support from inside our own intelligence community.<eos> The deal with Iran has been formally adopted.<eos> It's settled policy.<eos> Any attempt to undermine it's-- Treason.<eos> You have proof of all this, I'm assuming.<eos> I do.
You and your daughter seem to have the same sense of humor.<eos> I need a priest.<eos> - A priest?<eos> - Yeah. A priest.<eos> I mean, I can't go through this again. There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...<eos> Yes, of course. I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.<eos> She's...<eos> - No. No. No one does.
You're zig-zagging.<eos> Okay, I need you to lay down and, uh, tell me again exactly how you fell.<eos> Dr. Kinney?<eos> Your patient in 3, can you move him out?<eos> I could use the bed.<eos> And by "I," I mean Dr. Miller.<eos> I would love to, but I don't have a patient in 3.<eos> Your, uh, Magic Mike?<eos> I told Williams to discharge him.<eos> You did?
I blasted them!<eos> I'd say they were thousands of feet away.<eos> Well, maybe not thousands, but boy, were they up there.<eos> - Way.<eos> - I mean, yeah.<eos> Why would the guy buy a car when he can buy a truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two shots, two ducks.<eos> You like this, you dumb fuck?<eos> Yeah, you do.
It is a battle cry!<eos> Smoke.<eos> Come on.<eos> Danes.<eos> Danes would not slaughter Danes like this.<eos> If there is slaughter, Lord, and there appears to be slaughter, why do we ride towards it?<eos> We are curious.<eos> Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!
I had no choice.<eos> His chief's in a tarp under the goddamn church.<eos> He was heading right for it.<eos> Where are you gonna take him?<eos> Far enough away from civilization to give us time.<eos> You're just gonna leave him?<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If this thing with Kevin doesn't work, who gives a shit?<eos> Officer Koalafart here is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow along with all the rest of us.<eos> But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...
How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.<eos> Where you came from, the drugs, the violence.<eos> I was just like you once.<eos> Lost, unsettled.<eos> Seduced by the West.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know decadence.<eos> So does your brother.
What were you doing when they walked into your house?<eos> I was on my laptop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then I heard a noise.<eos> I thought my dog had knocked something over.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Good. Good.<eos> I-I need you to count how many men there were, what they were wearing, what they were saying.<eos> Excuse me, Jennifer, just for a second, okay?<eos> Hey, how you doing?
We're done working up your credentials.<eos> Well, mostly.<eos> Andy, what the hell does that mean?<eos> Mariana's on it.<eos> She's been looped in.<eos> Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't.
You'll hear from the attorney general.<eos> Rebecca's ambulance is exiting 29.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - Signal lights.<eos> I want that ambulance to hit green all the way through.<eos> What Nicole said... that there's something inside you that... scares her?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know what that is.<eos> Because I have it, too.<eos> We all do.
Do you understand me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Paul's got him banged up, won't even let me talk with him.<eos> We need to break him out!<eos> Break him out, you tit?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's not Alcatraz!<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
You're trespassing. I'll call the cops.<eos> Hey, Supergirl, thank you, but I can handle this.<eos> Okay, but I'm not leaving.<eos> What is it?<eos> There's something you don't know about Mary Beth.<eos> She came into my restaurant and we just...<eos> I already heard all of that.<eos> She took pity on you because you needed a friend.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> But so did she.
Okay, here it goes.<eos> Luca and I are together.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> I should have told you earlier, but my last relationship was such a mess, that I wanted to make sure that it was something before I said anything, and now it is, and I told you as soon as I realized,<eos> and I'm gonna tell Bay as soon as I see her. Mom, he's a good guy who just got me through something big, and if you're happy, then I'm happy, and I'm sure Bay will be too.<eos> Wow.<eos> Everybody is handling this much better than I thought they would.<eos> Wait... he doesn't have a crazy ex-wife, does he?<eos> No, he does not!
And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.<eos> - Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
Hanging out.<eos> Bored.<eos> Who are you waiting for?<eos> And here everything was going so perfectly superficial.<eos> I'm just trying to understand why someone like you is working for Fuchs.<eos> He's like any sapien.<eos> A temporary solution to a long-term problem.<eos> BPO.<eos> - How do you avoid them?<eos> - You don't.
Listen, I gotta call you back.<eos> Did you watch it?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I watched it.<eos> - It has almost two million hits!<eos> Oh, can you believe it?<eos> - It is incredible.<eos> - Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you. I know.<eos> He said that I needed to talk to you.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
I mean, we just decided to part ways, and, you know, wish each other the best, and, uh, explore other opportunities, et cetera. Blah, blah, blah.<eos> You said I was your guy.<eos> Well, you lied to us, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Can I offer an opinion? - [gasps]<eos> I came alone.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> That's all.<eos> How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.
He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder a politician named Mitchell Taylor.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> The church?<eos> Why?<eos> This is where the meeting is supposed to be.<eos> Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.<eos> Riley?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - He said I had to go down the stairs.<eos> - Who did?
But I will remind you... what you said to me when we were watching From Here to Eternity.<eos> That this wasn't a career you were chasing. It was a dream.<eos> So tell me, my love... if your dream isn't worth the risk, what is?<eos> Wait!<eos> From queer to eternity!<eos> These people are here for me?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> - But do they know I'm just...<eos> - Just like them?<eos> They do.
What right do you have to come into my church?<eos> I am Special Agent Bendix.<eos> I'm here to arrest Nomi Marks. - Nom?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You said it was fine.<eos> - I thought it was.<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God.<eos> What the hell, Bug?<eos> You said it worked.<eos> It did work.
That's a loaded word.<eos> Scary. Lot of pressure.<eos> Not for me.<eos> You can perform?<eos> Fucking right I can.<eos> Come back to my office and try me.<eos> - Never had any complaints.<eos> You know, they say a trained professional can always tell when someone's lying.<eos> That's an exaggeration. We don't always know.<eos> But right now, I do.
What happened to "Team Flaritza"?<eos> I got called up for van duty last minute.<eos> And I thought we decided on Team Maraca.<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> We said that that sounded like two rumba shakers, not two unique individuals sharing one nickname.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> I came down a whole other hallway from you.<eos> You were supposed to be my riot buddy.<eos> Did you see me push him? And then kick him later?<eos> Of course I did.
You're Plan B.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> I belong up here.<eos> DAVID:<eos> Hmm.<eos> I don't want to go back down to eight billion of those motherfuckers.<eos> {\pos(375,5)}( crying laugh ) {\pos(375,5)}( sniffles )<eos> I need you to say you trust me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I do.
Here, do you want one?<eos> Wait, you stole an actual plate from the WEMUN mixer?<eos> Well, congrats, now you're even more of a dick.<eos> I'm a dick?<eos> Why am I a dick?<eos> Because I actually came here to try to help our tiny little friend here. All right?<eos> - Not steal fine china.<eos> Or someone else's fucking boyfriend.<eos> Can't believe you just said that.<eos> I did.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, I'm assuming that was Toni Morrison.<eos> That's funny.<eos> No, it's my ex.<eos> Very tortured woman.<eos> But our daughter is a good girl, so, you know, I have to believe that this... life, this mother, is teaching her something, you know, building her up strong, because, uh,<eos> she's had some depression stuff this year and it got kind of serious, but, um... she's good.<eos> - Listen, I don't know you...<eos> - No, Hannah, you do not.
- What is this?<eos> - That's impossible!<eos> What is not possible?<eos> What is this? Come on.<eos> You bring these people in here and you can't explain what this is?<eos> - Hugo, he told me he can help.<eos> - Did you sell us out, Mike? - No.<eos> I swear.<eos> - Did you sell us out?<eos> No, I didn't.
You shouldn't have to deal with this. I'm so fucking crazy.<eos> Did you take your medicine?<eos> - Did you take your medicine?<eos> - I thought I didn't have to.<eos> - I thought I was better.<eos> - Oh, come on, Mira.<eos> You know you can't do that.<eos> It doesn't just fuck you over, it fucks me over, too.<eos> Now my head feels so noisy.<eos> - Well, of course it does.
That's not true.<eos> You're not done.<eos> I need you.<eos> We need you.<eos> You're gonna be a grandma.<eos> Remember, Grandma Loreen?<eos> Oh, no, that's right.<eos> I'll be a grandma.<eos> And when you think of grandparents, you think of death.<eos> Nuh-uh, I don't!
That's the question I ask other people.<eos> Well, it's also my question.<eos> I ask it to other people, too, because I think it's, like, the best way to kind of get down to the heart of people.<eos> - You know, like, see their true self.<eos> - Totally!<eos> Exactly!<eos> Their true, deepest, most intimate selves.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And of course we know the correct answer.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - Yeah.
Have you ever thought you might like boys?<eos> I don't know. Even just a bit?<eos> That you're bisexual?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Some very cool people are bisexual, like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
Uh, this is Booth on the phone.<eos> Why don't you take the wall by the windows? Okay.<eos> Hello, Booth?<eos> Bones, what the hell is going on?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm in Graham Reynolds' basement. No, no, no.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You don't... you don't just leave without telling me or Cam.<eos> I wasn't aware I needed permission.<eos> You don't.
(knocks) Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it? Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.<eos> Ooh, thank you, Agent Aubrey, for your enthusiasm-- you're a heck of a salesman.<eos> Yeah, what is it, Delfs?<eos> Just spit it out, will ya? I was just wondering if you were open to having another forensic anthropologist consult on the case.<eos> Booth, she wants to give Zack access to the case file.<eos> No way.<eos> Get out, both of you. KAREN:<eos> Okay, just-just think about it for a minute.<eos> Out. Done. No.
I know.<eos> It's a special place.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's all this stuff in the bag here?<eos> Christine?<eos> No.<eos> That's... that's Parker's.<eos> He gave it to me 11 years ago.<eos> He told me he liked me.<eos> Of course he did, huh?
And if you wouldn't mind getting off my bed... .. I'd quite like a lie-down.<eos> Doctor, if I wasn't aware of Sister Mary Cynthia's need for psychiatric help before I saw you with her yesterday, I am now.<eos> And I'm very grateful for your interest.<eos> There is a particularly gentle, and therefore suitable, therapeutic community near Birmingham, called Northfield.<eos> Because her family live there, we may be able to get her in.<eos> Doctor, the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's family now, and she's already left for the Mother House.<eos> She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.
What?<eos> Baptism?<eos> Everything.<eos> God, angels, Heaven, Hell.<eos> I mean, I don't necessarily see myself playing a harp on a little white cloud, but...<eos> I do believe you get to see your loved ones.<eos> I'm gonna see my mom.<eos> You really think she's up there?<eos> - Watching over you?<eos> - Yeah. Actually, I do.
Where'd he go?<eos> No idea.<eos> There you are.<eos> Mellie...<eos> Advance is prepping the plane.<eos> I've asked besma to write some statements for our guys, spin for the press.<eos> And Renee is working on my speech.<eos> Oh, and we are looking into constitutional lawyers.<eos> We're gonna need the best...<eos> - No, we don't.
Incredibly hot Brett with the eight-pack abs?<eos> Pretty sure his name is just Brett.<eos> He has an eight-pack.<eos> Do you, do you know how hard it is for the human body to have an eight-pack?<eos> God.<eos> Wait, why is he helping you?<eos> I couldn't get anyone else to volunteer.<eos> Yeah, that's because there's no way any of 'em are gonna make First Line.<eos> I mean, no one does before junior year.<eos> Scott did, and so did I.
Shukran.<eos> There's no Michael Scofield.<eos> Punch up an image from the Internet. Michael Scofield.<eos> Send it to the prison.<eos> Maybe he's under a different name.<eos> Listen, Linc, I got to say something, man.<eos> Man, you got to slow your roll.<eos> Yemen is in a civil war. They're really close to collapse.<eos> It's no place for a white man with an American passport, no command of Arabic, to just show up on a whim.<eos> And yet, apparently, my brother did.
I mean, this kid is out of control.<eos> - I'm gonna go talk to Hackett.<eos> - Emily, wait, before you do...<eos> No, why wait? The girl's a snake.<eos> She needs to be kicked off the team.<eos> I agree, but she is dangerous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
And that's what we're going to accomplish... together.<eos> What happened at the clinic?<eos> When we explained the situation they said they'd rush the blood test.<eos> You explained things?<eos> Sort of explained.<eos> What do we think this means?<eos> It means that the world is much smaller than we ever thought.<eos> Lucas lied to us.<eos> He said he didn't know anything about Charlotte.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
The... the book I was writing about Alison where we met, andand I started...<eos> I started this relationship by lying to you.<eos> I wouldn't have blamed you if you had turned in that file then or now.<eos> I would have deserved it.<eos> - And maybe I still do.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.<eos> You don't need to tell me that.<eos> Yes, I do!
Shall I read you the statement?<eos> You went through my mail?<eos> We have what you want, you have what we want.<eos> Tell us the name of Alison's donor daddy.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then tell us who handed you the cash to make the transfer?<eos> Unless you'd rather tell the state board.<eos> Look, no...<eos> I-I don't have names.<eos> Alright. I never did.
Okay, we could just forget it ever happened.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> It was too late the moment I met him.<eos> He had my heart, and I had his.<eos> Then ask him... if that's what love is.<eos> It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Er, just after lunch.<eos> - Did you stay with them?<eos> - No, I had to get back to the Visitor Centre.<eos> Then I was stuck there till we closed at five.<eos> - Did you see them in the evening at all?<eos> - No.<eos> We believe they were staying in Ambersea.<eos> I was in The Anchor all night for Sophia's party.<eos> What time did you go home?<eos> Er... well, I didn't, really.
Why don't you guys go to the Dairy Queen and get yourself a treat, okay?<eos> Come on, RJ.<eos> Oh, Papi.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Sí.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What was he like...<eos> Buckley?<eos> Was an asshole who believed in aliens.<eos> You don't?
Or worse. We checked the ISR footage, and there's a gap in the coverage when this was supposed to have happened.<eos> - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - The other Muj was turned over to the Afghan police...<eos> Anything you want to add, now is the time.<eos> Sir, we need to get Rip before they torture him any more.<eos> Did we get any news on that Chechen we bagged in Nigeria?<eos> Yeah, we're working on a link between him and an ex-Spetsnaz guy named Akmal Barayev.<eos> We thought he was dead, but turns out he might not be.<eos> Chase, Fishbait, can you guys give us a minute?<eos> You trust me with your life, Ortiz?<eos> Yes, Chase, I do.
Please open the door if you're in there.<eos> Laurel!<eos> I'm gonna kill you if you're alive in there!<eos> You're out of the hospital.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> You told me I could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.<eos> No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.<eos> So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see Frank in the basement that night...<eos> I did!
Banging him is fine.<eos> Doing other things is not. Who is he?<eos> Private investigator.<eos> - Are you a moron?<eos> - What, like "Veronica Mars"?<eos> Before you yell at me... look at what he found.<eos> Sylvia Mahoney submitted DNA to a lab for analysis five days before Wes' death. So?<eos> My whole family had that done.<eos> Actually, I found out that I have some Japanese<eos> - in my genes. - She did the DNA test on Wes, idiot.
It's not like I'm actually retaining anything.<eos> I just needed to feel... normal.<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> As you know, this year has been the most awful of my life. And thinking about what Laurel's going through and what's happening with poor O-man right now, it just... I realized that I think we should tell each other things while we still can.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you, Michaela.<eos> And I know that you probably hate that I'm saying this right now 'cause that's the message that your face is sending me, but...<eos> I couldn't have gotten through any of this without you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I do.
You should see a doctor.<eos> Pride hurts more than my body, but thank you.<eos> So what'd he tell you?<eos> He told me to speak to a woman in The Houses named Miss Campbell in 308.<eos> Which somebody didn't want you to do.<eos> That is the conclusion I'm drawing, yes.<eos> So let me go find out what she knows.<eos> You can't go by yourself.<eos> I got a gun.<eos> How y'all doing?
I'm sorry that I have been acting the way that I've been acting.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm really upset.<eos> And I'm scared.<eos> And I don't want to hate people, but I kind of do.<eos> 'Cause honestly, I feel hated.<eos> I feel like I failed you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Because as a mom, it is my job to deliver a world where the values that I raised you to believe in mattered.<eos> And they didn't! They didn't!
My le...<eos> Justice doled out at a buck-80 an hour... you get what you pay for.<eos> How you doing?<eos> That's why I have joined millions of other patriotic Americans in saying, "Screw jury duty."<eos> Good news, Dad. You accidentally put this in the shredder, but I was able to reassemble it and put your juror number in the online system.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do this? Huh?<eos> Why would you do any of this?<eos> No need to thank me, but I also called to confirm they received it.<eos> They did, so 7:00 a.m. sharp, Temple Street Courthouse.
Oh, I'm driving you crazy?<eos> You're driving me crazy.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then we don't need to watch this together.<eos> Fine!<eos> I was getting tired of slumming with you anyway, watching it on a 50-inch screen.<eos> I'm gonna watch it in my bedroom, on a 70-inch, with no pants!<eos> So...<eos> We haven't had a chance to connect since the divorce.<eos> H-How you doing?
Good.<eos> I mean, I'm glad you're all right.<eos> I....<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Just talk for a minute?<eos> As you can see, I'm more than all right.<eos> I'm very well, in fact.<eos> How...?<eos> I always told you I'd get better. You just never believed me.<eos> Sure I did.
- You're gay.<eos> - What?<eos> No, I... I know you're pissed about me leaving you at the Chinese restaurant, but I couldn't stand up for you when I couldn't stand looking at myself.<eos> Look, Arthur, I never needed you to stand up for me.<eos> I just needed you.<eos> I didn't want to drag you into my shit.<eos> It's a little too late for that.<eos> Don't you get it, you idiot?<eos> Everything's changed because of you.<eos> No more killing, no more racing, I don't...
Look, Arthur, I never needed you to stand up for me.<eos> I just needed you.<eos> I didn't want to drag you into my shit.<eos> It's a little too late for that.<eos> Don't you get it, you idiot?<eos> Everything's changed because of you.<eos> No more killing, no more racing, I don't...<eos> I just want to move on. Your incessantly annoying morality speech finally got to me.<eos> Just hope you found whatever it was you were looking for here.<eos> I did.
Then you move on?<eos> Then I move on.<eos> So why don't you trade with Red River?<eos> They don't have any electricity at all.<eos> Are you trading or asking questions?<eos> Just curious.<eos> We don't care for Red River folks.<eos> Least of all, Sheriff Leon.<eos> Where'd you say you're from again?<eos> I didn't.
I just want to... Free up our minds and be open to alternate strategies, please.<eos> Meet me halfway here.<eos> I suppose... I suppose we could limit the investigators to just nighttime hours.<eos> - Nighttime.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I'm sleeping...<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> It just makes the most sense He'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.<eos> You really think he's going to do that?<eos> I do, indeed.
Is there, like, a YouTube tutorial I can watch?<eos> Practice makes perfect.<eos> Wait, are we in India?<eos> Welcome to Agra.<eos> Wait, Camille lives in India?<eos> Camille lives wherever she wants.<eos> Homes all over the globe.<eos> She's always liked to spend the winters in Agra.<eos> She loves the smell of lotus blossoms.<eos> Who doesn't?
You sure we're safe up here?<eos> If I'm gonna die, it's not gonna be in this van.<eos> Not on a night like tonight.<eos> Maybe we should go looking for Jace.<eos> No.<eos> If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie, we need to be here when he comes back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't.
Oh, don't worry, little one.<eos> It's only a game.<eos> It's make believe, okay?<eos> Take her upstairs.<eos> And don't let anyone in unless her name is Clary.<eos> The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the institute.<eos> You telling me you don't have a key?<eos> I do, in my office.
Thawne was erased from existence when his progenitor,<eos> Eddie Thawne, committed suicide in order to stop him.<eos> Which would explain why the Time Masters didn't have a file on him.<eos> But if Thawne doesn't exist, then how?<eos> He was protected from his ancestor's death because he was a member of the Speed Force.<eos> It's a little complicated.<eos> A little?<eos> Oh, and for the record, this is how I wanted to approach things in the first place.<eos> Only because you enjoy killing a lot of people.<eos> As if you don't.
Good-bye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets - when you were knocked out.<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
I'll be right back.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> At least you're not shopping at Villains "R" Us anymore.<eos> I'm sorry about H.R.<eos> I'm sure he would have appreciated you coming.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.
Well, well, well.<eos> At least you're not shopping at Villains "R" Us anymore.<eos> I'm sorry about H.R.<eos> I'm sure he would have appreciated you coming.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do. With your friends. With me.
We need to find Boland before she gets involved in something that she can't handle.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Hey, hey, hey. We're walking into a fortress, and you're gonna use just a bow?<eos> To use a bow and arrow requires patience and discipline.<eos> That's Yurievich.<eos> I will take on his guards.<eos> Yurievich--<eos> Yurievich is mine.<eos> Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.<eos> I didn't...
- I love you, too, Mommy.<eos> You know, you didn't have to do that.<eos> - Did you even hear what they said?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Dolly didn't hear it, and it's her party today.<eos> Right, but she's fine.<eos> She doesn't know what happened.<eos> I'm not gonna let them talk like that about her.<eos> I'm obviously gonna want to protect her.<eos> And I don't?
It's never gonna be as bad as this.<eos> That's actually not necessarily true.<eos> When my dad died, it actually got harder as time went on.<eos> I know you're trying to help.<eos> Do you remember when he used to lie on the floor and watch us have sex?<eos> - That, uh, creeped you out, as I recall.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah. It was another set of eyes watching me have sex.<eos> - He didn't know what he was seeing.<eos> - He absolutely did.
Sounds good.<eos> How do you think this is going to go down?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Well, you didn't want Callie to show her project on campus, this is how she got the seniors to back down.<eos> Showing it off campus.<eos> All's well that ends well, right?<eos> So, clearly I'm a disaster, and the universe is telling me that this is not my thing.<eos> Come on.<eos> How did Oli do today?
Okay, well, I only have two signed permission slips.<eos> So do the rest of you have yours?<eos> I didn't really ask my parents.<eos> They don't know about me, they'd totally freak out.<eos> Hang tight, one second.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Um, your mom sent my mom a permission slip.<eos> - Do you not want me here? - N...<eos> No, of course I do.
Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Should I order something in?<eos> We might be here a while.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
No.<eos> We're not done, Oliver.<eos> You and me, we're never gonna be done.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Listen, man, you can tell me that you're a serial killer, that you're crazy, or you're whatever Chase has shoved into your head, but I'm not believing any of that, even if you do, and that's because I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.<eos> The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
Twins?<eos> That's super scary.<eos> I know.<eos> What do you do with twins?<eos> So, when did you get married?<eos> And do you take Robin to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Sí.<eos> And do you, Robin, take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I...<eos> I do.
What the... You followed me home?<eos> - N... uh... N... What is happening here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I, uh... We're supposed to be moving in here.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We live here. Are you from the street?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> N-no. N-no. No, I j...<eos> [Laughs Nervously] M... Uh, maybe I made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, you did.
No.<eos> - No. You're a great person now.<eos> And together, we're undefeatable.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Buenas noches.<eos> Was this woman on your bus? I don't think she ever got on.<eos> But she left her bag.<eos> Hey!<eos> You know her?<eos> Yes, I do, amigo!
No. We tracked the box itself, But... it was a dead end.<eos> So Valentine sent Duncan to steal a pair of baby booties?<eos> Someone did.<eos> Someone who wanted to circumvent us from tracking Jonathan.<eos> And now we have no leads on either of them.<eos> We've got nothing.<eos> Actually, we have less than nothing.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The Clave doesn't have the Soul Sword.<eos> They never did.
Her name is Dot.<eos> Jace is trying to sabotage me.<eos> He's trying to... make Clary hate me.<eos> But I swear to you, I will end him before I let that happen.<eos> Listen.<eos> Once we have the mirror, none of this will matter.<eos> I can't have Clary hate me.<eos> Not after everything I've been through.<eos> Clary doesn't care about you.<eos> Yes, she does.
♪ How long will I fly ♪ - That was graceful.<eos> - Shadowhunter.<eos> What?<eos> Am I doing something wrong?<eos> No such thing.<eos> Well, then...<eos> What?<eos> Do you not want to?<eos> No. I mean, yes.<eos> Of course I do.
Don't.<eos> We're all responsible for this.<eos> At least now we know Valentine can never get the mirror and raise the Angel.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Look, even with our pure angel blood, doesn't it seem strange that Clary's runes would be powerful enough to destroy a Mortal Instrument?<eos> And why didn't it destroy the sword?<eos> What if the mirror I destroyed isn't the Mortal Mirror?<eos> Then why would your mom give it to the warlocks to protect?<eos> Maybe she thought it was.<eos> We all did.
Together, we are unstoppable.<eos> Previously, on Shadowhunters...<eos> Well, he's Valentine's son.<eos> We were trained to do the impossible.<eos> Jonathan attacked Max and came for the mirror.<eos> He's not getting out alive.<eos> You forgot something.<eos> Ahh! ALEC: Go after him!<eos> Doesn't it seem strange that Clary's runes would be powerful enough to destroy a Mortal Instrument?<eos> AR I didn't that Cladestroy the mirror.
- I don't remember him.<eos> - And next time he turned up,<eos> - he got even more violent with you --<eos> - No.<eos> - -- and in self-defence...<eos> - No. I don't remember this man.<eos> When he was murdered, I was living in Italy.<eos> So you say you left the UK in March, Sara,<eos> - and went to Europe for nine months. - I don't "say" it.<eos> I did.
Because Colin Osborne's gay.<eos> Right...<eos> Well, I'm going to try and track her down, and I've got the name of the lawyer from Klein Egerton who handled it at the time.<eos> I think he's still alive.<eos> - We'll speak to you later.<eos> - 'OK, guv.'<eos> Maybe it was this that prompted his breakdown.<eos> The timing seems a bit coincidental, doesn't it?<eos> Though how it connects to David Walker...<eos> - If it even does.

Yeah.
The only thing he was out for was revenge.<eos> No, he cared about all of us.<eos> We had dresden.<eos> He was going to talk, we could've used him...<eos> We could've what?<eos> Worked out a deal?<eos> With a man who casually murdered countless belters.<eos> A man who was a threat to all human life, and that is why Miller shot him.<eos> He didn't have the right to make that decision.<eos> But you do?
Miller!<eos> He's dead.<eos> Ain't that fitting.<eos> Guys?<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> The Nauvoo just missed!<eos> How the hell did it change course?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> The Nauvoo didn't move.<eos> Eros did.
Detonator safety got fried.<eos> Sixty-second reset. It's the best we can do. Go.<eos> Get back to the ship.<eos> Miller, answer me.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Guys?<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> The Nauvoo just missed!<eos> The Nauvoo didn't move, Miller.<eos> Eros did.
I'm almost to the airlock.<eos> I didn't count on this damn bomb loving gravity so much.<eos> There's alien life in the universe, and I'm riding it, like a tick on a dog.<eos> Hey, don't get all "Holden" on me.<eos> Weird and chatty under pressure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, must be real tough growing' up under a blue sky... Eight parents slobbering all over you.<eos> Hey, now. Wait till you get to know him better.<eos> He's got lots of layers.<eos> Yeah. So does a rock tunnel.
What did he say?<eos> He said he'd be okay throwing me into space without my helmet, but that you wouldn't like it.<eos> Sounds like Amos, 16-millimeter.<eos> It's kind of hard to explain.<eos> He's like a brother.<eos> We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship without my helmet, right?<eos> -I did.
Gosh.<eos> From Mama's wedding dress.<eos> Something borrowed, so you can have one Sayre with you.<eos> Tootsie.<eos> I love you, baby sister.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love.<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.

All those bands sound the same.<eos> ♪ I'd keep you if I could ♪ Maybe.<eos> Were you into the girl or something?<eos> What?<eos> No. No.<eos> No.<eos> - Why the fascination?<eos> - No, I was curious...<eos> Oh, yeah, I like it when you're jealous, though.<eos> No, you don't.
- What?<eos> - To Emily.<eos> - Oh, wow, surprising.<eos> - Yeah, I know, right?<eos> And it's just a band-aid, it's so fucking obvious.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> But you can't control what he does, and maybe... maybe he really loves her.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> - Well, you don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Catherine, let me just explain something to you, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> I really don't care what you think.<eos> I'm gonna run for president again.<eos> Okay?<eos> Mommy's gonna be president again.<eos> But you said that if any one of us objects that you're not gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed.<eos> You really did.
I was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.<eos> Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything.<eos> It's their job.<eos> But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication.<eos> Too many similarities from unconnected sources.<eos> Sources in the restricted area?<eos> The very same.<eos> And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.<eos> So, you believe me.<eos> I do.
Not really.<eos> We ask the Father to judge us with mercy.<eos> We ask the Mother to...<eos> Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.<eos> I'm sorry you're dead.<eos> You deserved better. Both of you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mom.<eos> You should really sleep, Sam.<eos> The dead don't.
Everything gonna be fine.<eos> Come on, I'll walk you up.<eos> The last time you helped me upstairs...<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I just meant... I just want to make sure you're okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I don't need your help, James. I got this far without you.<eos> I'm gonna keep going.<eos> You saw the news?<eos> I did, yeah.
And listen, don't make me change this number.<eos> Just don't call me again.<eos> What'd he want?<eos> Daddy's dying today.<eos> But that's according to him, you know,<eos> And I never know anymore whether he's making some excuse. Just to keep in contact with me or do... you know?<eos> Are you sure you don't want to go visit the man. And get things settled?<eos> He kept you out of jail, And that's settled enough for me.<eos> Praise the lord!<eos> How you doing?
Thank you.<eos> And I want you to know. That if you ever need a personal reference from me...<eos> That's what this is.<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> I'm sure you know that we've been. Going through some financial issues. That we couldn't have foreseen last year.<eos> And so we've had to look hard for cuts.<eos> And unfortunately, the music ministry. Is one of those areas.<eos> That is unfortunate.<eos> And since you were the last person hired in the department, Well, you know the rest.<eos> I do, actually.
And how long will that take?<eos> Ma'am, do you want this done right or do you want this done quickly?<eos> I'm expecting you to do both.<eos> If Deputy Beck intentionally victimized Jesse because of bias, he will be indicted.<eos> And if he acted in self-defense, then he'll be cleared.<eos> The truth is my only compass.<eos> That's a nice compass to have.<eos> I don't have the luxury of getting lost.<eos> I'm the first female governor of this state.<eos> Neither do I.
If we're niggers to them, be 100% niggers 'cause 100% of us is more than a white man can handle.<eos> Listen to the man.<eos> Listen to what he come teach you.<eos> Today we're reading from Dhari's own book - the memoirs of his struggle.<eos> The Dragon Will Fly.<eos> Turn to page 23.<eos> The Reckoning.<eos> "Let me make myself clear."<eos> I do not seek the white man's approval.<eos> I never did.
I don't know.<eos> I mean, my mom did.<eos> She seemed pretty sure.<eos> She used to say,<eos> "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Shouldn't they be all over this?<eos> The police are dead.<eos> First piece of luck I've had in days.<eos> Hi.<eos> The police are dead?<eos> All of them? All of the police are dead?<eos> Worse things out tonight than you.<eos> Do you have a car?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Right over there, right at that table over there.<eos> That's where he took his last glass of evil, vile fuckin' mead, and made his bargain with the devil himself.<eos> Your piece of shit husband got a new life.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> This one got a new life.<eos> He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did. And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
You see that ash on that window?<eos> He come by every day right after the slop brought in.<eos> He share one of them cigarettes with some of the others.<eos> Probably the guy that opens that gate.<eos> Y'all notice he smell like smoke?<eos> Now, maybe if you made your move at dinnertime, you'd've got past the gate. But you'd've ran right into the marshal's office across the street.<eos> How you know where the marshal office is?<eos> You ever hear of the Macon 7?<eos> All the same, why you care we get ourselves kilt?<eos> I don't.
Sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> Help hold him down.<eos> Get some help!<eos> Artery's intact.<eos> He must have poked through a vein.<eos> Go get a doctor out here.<eos> Grab that sheet. Tear it in strips.<eos> How do you know what to do?<eos> I just do. Aah!
Fire at will!<eos> Stay down, chaplain!<eos> Why aren't you helping him?<eos> Fire!<eos> Miss green!<eos> Get down! Hold your fire!<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> God.<eos> They stopped shooting.<eos> Of course they did.
I feel your every move, I know your every thought, I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you rot.<eos> What am I?<eos> What did you do, Ed?<eos> What did you...<eos> What happened to Penguin?<eos> Something happened, didn't it?<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Dock 9C.<eos> It's where the weapon will be arriving.<eos> It's all I've been able to find out.<eos> I need to speak with the Court, try to buy some time.<eos> You need to find out when the weapon will be arriving, and you need to do it without the Court finding out you're involved.<eos> Otherwise... we're both dead.<eos> Make a choice, Jim.<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I know.<eos> You never did.
You're on your own, I'm afraid.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay. Can I open my eyes yet please?<eos> Um, yeah, but just one second.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just, um... yeah... okay, open 'em.<eos> I know you wanted to unpack slowly, like a normal couple, but I don't know... between our jobs and the S.T.A.R. Labs museum and... do you hate it?<eos> N-no, no, I don't hate it.<eos> You do.
If you want, we can solve this another way.<eos> There's a great spot for drinks...<eos> You realize trial by combat is to the death? Yeah.<eos> For the loser.<eos> Listen, you want him?<eos> You're gonna have to come and claim him.<eos> That's Arwen.<eos> That's... Arwen.<eos> I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare? Do I want the customary...<eos> Yes, you do.
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore in this universe.<eos> But in quantum mechanics, the daughter universe theory tell us... - Universe theory. - For every decision you make, a universe exists where you don't.<eos> Yeah, I actually went to that class.<eos> You better be going to all your classes.<eos> So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,<eos> Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no. Not at all.<eos> But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers... - Yeah, she did.
Okay.<eos> It's Iris.<eos> All right. I'll be right back, but... just let me know if you get anything, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.<eos> Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone, might want to wait on it.<eos> Well, the truth had to come out, so...<eos> Yeah, it did.

We're your friends.<eos> Your family.<eos> Caitlin, I can fix you.<eos> You already tried.<eos> Well then, I'll try harder.<eos> I don't care what it takes. I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
Look, if he wants to work on contracting every STD known to man, that is his deal.<eos> But you and I are going to be drinking yard full of margaritas while we hit the clubs.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> 'We have a big problem, Alan.'<eos> Is this about the Chinese distributors?<eos> They are threatening to pull out because they think that Tangey's role as the Time Sorceress is a ghost.<eos> - So..<eos> - So they don't do ghosts.
Okay, I guess I'll see you around.<eos> Uh, so nice to meet you.<eos> Now, where's my trailer again?<eos> 'It's just a few minor changes.'<eos> That's Mike's copy.<eos> He didn't really feel the love story.<eos> Okay.<eos> I, I thought Mike Tanen loved the script.<eos> Oh, he does.<eos> Really, he does.
I know she didn't say anything to you, Barrett.<eos> She didn't have to. I know all about little Jordy Michaels but a man's grasp should exceed his reach.<eos> There's a bigger story about your involvement with Brandy.<eos> And the man she killed.<eos> Was it Aidan McGhee?<eos> Your mother didn't want to talk to me.<eos> But, um, I'm giving you a chance to come clean so how about it?<eos> Do yourself a favor and stay the hell away from me.<eos> If you don't tell me the truth, someone else will!<eos> Someone always does.
Thank you.<eos> - You wanna go somewhere else?<eos> Is this weird for you? Them?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, what's weird is<eos> I had a meeting today at Newcastle and they told me they're firing Jake off his movie.<eos> I'm pretty sure he doesn't know.<eos> I mean, I should tell him right?<eos> Should I tell him?<eos> No. Don't.
Go get your movie back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Ida. She's in a meeting.<eos> So, should I call my attorney?<eos> Or did you figure out how to get Tangey back where she belongs?<eos> So sorry, Nina.<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> - Try harder next time.<eos> - I did, but she...
And if I feel like going out instead of going home then I'm gonna do that because I'm an adult and I don't have to listen to a father that I never had!<eos> Listen, can you handle your friend tonight?<eos> - 'Hey!<eos> ' - 'Rainer! '<eos> Oh, my, God.<eos> Stop!<eos> Rainer!<eos> Rainer Devon?<eos> Do you need a ride?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I do.
When that bell rings 12 times, the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.<eos> In this case...<eos> All of us in Mystic Falls.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride, little brother.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.<eos> I think they're siphoning directly from you.<eos> But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.
Whoever did this is no better than he was.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> There's something very important we need to discuss.<eos> New visitors policy.<eos> Hot women turning up unannounced are no longer welcome.<eos> Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
What better way for the world to see you than how I see you every day?<eos> It's gonna be epic.<eos> I promise.<eos> After auditions, let's go to my dad's and hang out with Bella.<eos> ♪ Last time didn't pan out... ♪ Hakeem, I told you I'm not doing that.<eos> Your baby already has a mother.<eos> I just want you to get to know her.<eos> And five... Hakeem. What's your grandmother doing here?<eos> Uh, hi, Ms. Walker.<eos> How you doing?
Does your lady know you're here?<eos> She knows I'm trying to close a very big deal... with all kinds of... opportunities for her.<eos> That's not good enough, Andre.<eos> You see, I don't ever touch another woman's man.<eos> At least, not without her permission.<eos> This is how I do business, Giuliana.<eos> It's how I've always done business.<eos> Nessa's fine with it.<eos> So, you have an agreement?<eos> We do.
Clamp your lips, boy.<eos> Turn it up, Porsha.<eos> Let's see what they after.<eos> This isn't about money.<eos> It's about making sure that no other woman has to go through what I went through.<eos> We are suing Empire Enterprises for $50 million.<eos> We are also demanding that Hakeem Lyon cancel all upcoming club appearances and issue a public apology to Kennedy and to all women for the culture of violence and misogyny he and his music encourages.<eos> This is way out of control.<eos> Does Dad know about this?<eos> Well, he does now.
'Cause guess what, old man, last time I checked, you are not the only CEO at this company.<eos> This ain't about me versus your mama, man. It's...<eos> I'm offering you an opportunity.<eos> Look, Inferno's gonna be an album like never before.<eos> And that's why Snoop and October London, and everybody wants to be a part of it, 'cause they know that they're gonna be a part of making history.<eos> Okay, but I'm not challenging that.<eos> Make your history.<eos> I'm-a make my own history.<eos> Or I should say, I'm-a try to rewrite the history of you and your crazy-ass family.<eos> Do Inferno.
Pardon?<eos> Brings me to your final gift... The Throne of Hell.<eos> You want me to be king?<eos> Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead, and Lucifer back in his box, we need a ruler.<eos> You are next in line, Ramiel.<eos> Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
I was kidding before, but you really do look like a creeper.<eos> Funny.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> BFF found.<eos> Beans spilled.<eos> Hayden was hooking up with this older guy on the DL, and she was really into him, but he was a total stalker.<eos> Texting constantly, ultra possessive.<eos> Skeeved her friend out so much she narc'd to Hayden's brother.<eos> Guess that explains why he was there.<eos> I did good, right?
So how are things in Heaven?<eos> Functional.<eos> You know, there's the usual infighting, but... let's just say Lucifer having a baby on board has brought us all together.<eos> You know, this is an all hands on deck situation, Castiel.<eos> Including yours.<eos> Okay, so you're here for my hands?<eos> We want you.<eos> Look, you got more field experience than the next thousand angels combined.<eos> I think you overestimate me.<eos> I don't.
I'm very, very impressed.<eos> You'll be happy to know the... The vessel is completely sound. The repairs are secure.<eos> And the security system?<eos> Whatever it is that lets crowley turn me into his own personal sock puppet.<eos> I don't hear words.<eos> The... the s-system is very much I-intact.<eos> But you can disarm it?<eos> I'm not really known for my Patience.<eos> I don't quite have the means...<eos> Who does?
Usually I gun down flyboys on sight.<eos> But, he looked... Different.<eos> Wasn't wearing a necklace made out of baby ears, for one thing.<eos> We got to talking about where I came from and our two worlds.<eos> From what he says, pretty much peaches and cream on your side.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's better than this.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.<eos> And you do?
- Or the party that was going on at Axehampton House?<eos> As I wasn't in Axehampton, I wouldn't have been near the house, would I?<eos> You drove your own car to go fishing? - Yep.<eos> - What route did you take?<eos> Same as usual - out on the St Andrews Road, onto the coast road, down to the car park.<eos> - Same on the way back?<eos> - Same on the way back.<eos> - Well, that makes sense.<eos> - Glad you're happy.<eos> Except you didn't.
Get off!<eos> I was trying to work out where Michael got the porn from. Here!<eos> Your computer.<eos> He got it from you!<eos> That is not what's going on.<eos> What are you even doing with it?<eos> - Look, everybody has it!<eos> All right?<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> I don't!
One hundred percent!<eos> Wow. You two are the only ones who've ever gotten a perfect score.<eos> Us two?<eos> [Yuko] It is on.<eos> [upbeat dance music playing]<eos> [Jacqueline] Here's how we handle DJ Fingablast.<eos> Men always want what they can't have.<eos> Cuban cigars, a watchable Superman movie.<eos> Just act like you don't want the gig.<eos> I don't.
Everyone is looking at us sideways.<eos> We can't start doing that to each other.<eos> Looking at us sideways?<eos> What happened?<eos> I was over at Anna's apartment today, supposedly to help her pick out colors for the dresses, and she graciously offered to let me bow out of being a bridesmaid since we're "under so much pressure."<eos> - Caleb's going to be pissed.<eos> - Don't say anything.<eos> If she doesn't want me in the wedding, she's gonna have to be straight up with it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I-I don't.
He's panicked. Breeland shows up.<eos> Breeland.<eos> He's our dead end in both cases.<eos> We got to get him to snitch on Beck.<eos> Or we get Beck to turn on Breeland about the tours.<eos> Or Sergeant Derkin.<eos> That guy's got a lot of guilt, more than he can carry.<eos> I think I can turn him.<eos> On the upside, we got a roster of old white dudes to show Cory.<eos> Hell of a lot more than we did yesterday.
My sister isn't old enough to get married, even if she wanted to.<eos> Tell me, bookworm... can you name me a language that was spoken by ancient Romans and is still spoken by very irritating people today?<eos> - Latin.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And can you translate the Latin phrase "in loco parentis"?<eos> "Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.
Explain yourself.<eos> The reason that I said I did not know anything about the snakes, is because I was being modest.<eos> You weren't being modest.<eos> You haven't been modest a day in your life.<eos> You were lying.<eos> Klaus, you can't speak to an adult that way.<eos> And he's lying now.<eos> He's a liar and a murderer and he killed Uncle Monty.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Yes, we do.
Take the week.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Aaron told me himself.<eos> He shared the information with Speaker Hookstraten...<eos> She leaked it to Abe Leonard.<eos> Wow.<eos> Do you think this has anything to do with him suppressing the threat assessment memo?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Ciao, boys.<eos> Oh, dear Lord, that's a lot of money.<eos> We must be rollin' in it!<eos> We're goin' full throttle on a dry tank, honey.<eos> Need to spend to make.<eos> Becky, we get Elvis on more stations, then the kids go lookin' for the records, then the stores call the distributors, then they call us and then we're rollin' in it.<eos> At least that's the plan, praise Jesus.<eos> Now... Now you're asking him for help.<eos> Darlin', I'm asking everybody.<eos> And who he doesn't, I do.
And I saw you with your baby, Sam.<eos> It tore my heart out.<eos> Right then and there, I knew that would never be me.<eos> Maybe I should leave Sun.<eos> Marion... Sun may be circling the drain, but I got a feelin'... we are on the edge of somethin'.<eos> And we didn't come this far for you to quit.<eos> There's no place for me in your life.<eos> We started this together.<eos> I don't see a future.<eos> Of course you do.
I ask him about it, he says he made a mistake.<eos> Took off his glove.<eos> He's not the type.<eos> Anyone can make a mistake.<eos> You think he might be involved?<eos> The thought crossed my mind.<eos> That's a dark fuckin' thought.<eos> He's been after this scumbag for years.<eos> Knows he did it, knows in his bones.<eos> The way we do.
Thanks, Edge.<eos> Come here.<eos> We lifted your prints off the RV door.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Anything about your story true?<eos> All right, I went and I tried the door.<eos> All right?<eos> Then I got out of there.<eos> You saw the body?<eos> Yeah, I did.
You know, the one good thing about America is that money can buy a lot of strong, powerful, armed friends.<eos> I kind of want to see you try.<eos> But then I think, when was the last time you slept?<eos> Does Noah got the strength in him for another failed escape?<eos> Can he stare out through them bars again?<eos> How long can his beard grow this time?<eos> A lot of questions come to mind.<eos> But I wonder, for the life of me, do they ever enter yours?<eos> Truth be told, I don't think you ever think about what happens after your brilliant plans.<eos> So I did the thinking this time, for you.
Charles mcgill.<eos> So Jimmy's own brother blocked him.<eos> Alley:<eos> Objection. How are the hiring practices of Hamlin, Hamlin, mcgill relevant here?<eos> It's relevant to understand the relationship between these brothers.<eos> We'll, uh, give you some leeway, Ms. wexler, but don't stray too far. Charles mcgill is not the subject of this hearing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did Jimmy know his brother was the one that prevented you from hiring him?<eos> Hamlin:<eos> No. He did not.
Alan loved to hike.<eos> We even opened a camping-supply store.<eos> I helped him with the mail-order side of it.<eos> And then, uh... this was eight years ago... he went hiking in Gila National and never came back.<eos> They found our car, but they never found him.<eos> And I don't know if... he slipped and fell or had a heart attack or met someone who didn't like the way he looked...<eos> I don't know.<eos> And even after all these years, not knowing how he passed or where he is...<eos> I wish it didn't matter.<eos> But it does.
I appreciate that advice.<eos> It was a sensation.<eos> You have to understand that women's movies had been out of vogue for quite some time.<eos> I think the biggest moneymaker that year was Lawrence of Arabia.<eos> I don't think there was even a girl camel in that one.<eos> So with two women stars of our era to suddenly have the most successful picture in the theaters among young people, well, we thought it signaled a sea change.<eos> We had thought we'd all start working again.<eos> That there'd be a flood of women's pictures.<eos> It didn't turn out that way.<eos> Sure as hell didn't.
Well, he always wanted to work with Bette after All About Eve, and now that he's back at 20th,<eos> I mean, it's a perfect fit.<eos> What? This?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You shopped my picture around to other studios?<eos> It's my picture, Jack.<eos> And now, Zanuck's.<eos> You can't work for Zanuck.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> No, no, we don't.
What about under foreign soil?<eos> What do you guys know about Dover's war tunnels?<eos> To defend against Napoleon, Dover Castle was retrofitted with a multi-level tunnel network.<eos> And Napoleon never invaded, but the tunnels remain.<eos> Judging by this location, Bray's compound... Sits on or near those tunnels.<eos> Giving Bray easy access to move captives.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> If this compound sits on a tunnel... and let's admit that's a... that's a mighty big "if"... how do you suggest we get in or even know where we are?<eos> It's not like we have a map.<eos> No, the Middlesex Museum of British History does.
Anna, my God.<eos> We heard.<eos> You okay? Is Bray alive?<eos> Anna, talk to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody, just calm down.<eos> We're on the same side, fellas.<eos> It's okay. You don't have to do this, sweetheart.<eos> He has my son!<eos> No, he doesn't.
James Bond borrowed my tux.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think somewhere under that 5:00 whiskey stink, there's a sharp mind still at work.<eos> I think that's why my husband paid you from a numbered account.<eos> I read about the funeral.<eos> Forgot to send flowers.<eos> Anyone can open the Yellow Pages and call a private detective.<eos> Only my husband would hire a spy.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Same thing Howard did.
Aldon Braddock, the one-off.<eos> Everyone in the crew was in the same unit except Braddock.<eos> - So how does he fit in?<eos> - Through Jennifer Lin.<eos> Three years ago, she was attached to his Ranger unit.<eos> Those two new each other.<eos> Knew each other how?<eos> It looks like they had an affair, because after it ended, she had a restraining order against him.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Love never does, my friend.
I'm not giving him to Howard.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> Howard... remember the World Summit on Innovation? Geneva?<eos> We stayed up all night working on your speech, how quantum computing would outstrip human capabilities, that if its development wasn't managed carefully, humanity would risk engineering its own extinction?<eos> You convinced me then we could never let that kind of power fall into the hands of some deranged, maniacal madman.<eos> I just never thought that madman would be you.<eos> You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.<eos> You can drop the act.<eos> Scottie, you don't have any leverage.<eos> Of course I do.
Good.<eos> That's the answer I needed.<eos> We're good to go.<eos> System's up.<eos> Process every image... satellite, CCTV, MTA, DMV, Snapchat... everything.<eos> I want to know the second you get a hit.<eos> If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Justice.<eos> I loved her once.<eos> In some ways, I still do.
- Where's Cantara being held?<eos> - An old slaughterhouse, about 10 miles from your location.<eos> Sending you GPS and schematics now.<eos> It's three stories, fortified, cameras inside and out.<eos> We have a plan to get you inside, but the space has been repurposed, so there's no way of knowing the layout.<eos> - Or how many mercs there are.<eos> - Or the location of Cantara.<eos> Other than that, Ms. Lincoln, how was the play?<eos> You said you had a way to get us inside?<eos> Matter of fact, I do, sweetheart.
What then?<eos> This cabin backed up to the river.<eos> Only way in, we can see out them windows.<eos> And there's a little boat tied off just down the way, - we need to run.<eos> - Harriet help me make the plan back.<eos> We follow it, we all gonna make it out of here.<eos> You feelin' all right?<eos> He fine.<eos> I think it's a boy.<eos> Noah, I really don't...
Emily, get in here!<eos> Come on!<eos> So I think there was some sort of miscommunication.<eos> I just wanted the fantasy site blocked.<eos> Now they're spending all their time trying to get the Internet back.<eos> So if you could just put it back.<eos> Emily... What do you think HR does?<eos> Oh, well, you know, it's... HR does the... It's human resources and...<eos> You have no idea.<eos> And neither does anyone else.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Why me?<eos> I prayed for a solution, and he... Gave me you.<eos> I honestly believed you left that life behind a long time ago.<eos> I honestly did.
Which you bailed on at the last minute.<eos> Is there something you wanna tell me, pal?<eos> We were wondering, Cheryl. Back in July, you told the po-po that Jason drowned.<eos> Yet, we come to find out that Jason didn't drown.<eos> He was shot.<eos> That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious. What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.<eos> We both did.
People who want to buy crack.<eos> And cinephiles, and car enthusiasts.<eos> Right, Bets?<eos> Totally.<eos> Anyway, it's closing because the town owns it, but didn't invest in it.<eos> So when an anonymous buyer made Mayor McCoy an offer, she couldn't refuse...<eos> Anonymous buyer?<eos> What do they have to hide?<eos> No one cares.<eos> I do!
But let me ask you this right now.<eos> Who's telling you you can't do your music?<eos> Your coach?<eos> Mr. Castillo?<eos> Your dad? Or is it just you?<eos> You dragged me out of the Blossom house, and then you don't talk to me the whole way home.<eos> Dad, Jason and Polly were engaged.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you did.
It's been months.<eos> There's gotta be a reason my mom and dad don't want me to see Polly.<eos> But I don't care anymore.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Anything I can help with?<eos> What we're attempting is a stealth operation, Archie.<eos> If we go in there with the entire Scooby Gang, forget it, we're compromised.<eos> Well, don't you have to practice for the Variety Show anyways?<eos> Uh, no, I don't.<eos> Except that yes, you do.
Except that yes, you do.<eos> Thanks to a certain Veronica-ex-machina.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just that I had a few words with our director/host, and reminded him that he's heard you sing on numerous occasions.<eos> Even though it compromises my artistic integrity.<eos> Cutting to the chase, you have a slot if you want it.<eos> Veronica, thank you, but you saw what happened.<eos> We all did.
My son asked me to try and go straight, okay?<eos> You gonna make that hard on me? Dudley-Do-Right doesn't know I'm a Serpent, so I'd appreciate it if you keep that to yourself.<eos> Because here's the thing about snakes. You don't step on them, they got no reason to bite.<eos> Mom, Dad, when we find Polly, she's gonna live with us, right?<eos> At this point, there's no reason to hide or banish her, is there?<eos> Oh, of course not, honey.<eos> She's welcome back.<eos> Where will the baby sleep?<eos> Sweetie, um, we've talked to your sister about this, and she's agreed to put the baby up for adoption.<eos> Polly did?
Jellybean is helping her study.<eos> By the way, Jellybean wants to go with JB now.<eos> She thinks it sounds cooler.<eos> She's 10 years old and listens to Pink Floyd on vinyl, I don't think she could get any cooler.<eos> How was your jam session?<eos> It was great, until FP told us you forced him out of the company he helped found.<eos> That's his story, wanna hear mine, hmm?<eos> FP was a mess. He was stealing from the company and selling stuff on the side. All things considered, I was pretty generous.<eos> So generous you didn't give him a second chance?<eos> Of course I did.
Until Jason's body was found at Sweetwater River.<eos> Anything else you wanna ask?<eos> Did you have anything to do with Jason Blossom's death?<eos> You really think I could do that?<eos> It's the dark ages, Dad.<eos> I don't really know what to think anymore.<eos> I'm not a perfect father, Jughead, no getting around that, but...<eos> I'm no killer.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - I do.
Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.<eos> Maybe it's time you tell Mr. Andrews the truth.<eos> And risk having him walk off the project?<eos> We've bet everything we have on the SoDale construction.<eos> Mom, this is a small, gossipy town.<eos> You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.<eos> Archie.<eos> If music be the food of love, play on, play on.<eos> Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?<eos> I... No, I didn't.
Again, for things that you have no proof of.<eos> Dad, have you been body-snatched?<eos> Oh, I feel good, Jug.<eos> Wanna look good, too.<eos> Shave. Clean the place up a bit. A little paint...<eos> Oh, I got us some coffee and donuts.<eos> And I read your, uh...<eos> Your essay?<eos> Manuscript?<eos> - You did?
Which is the equivalent of tectonic plates shifting.<eos> I was thinking, maybe it's time I go back and live with him again.<eos> Based on the fact that he shaved?<eos> Well, he also hasn't missed a day of work, and he quit drinking.<eos> That's...<eos> That's great, Jughead. But maybe you should wait a little bit longer just to make sure it sticks.<eos> No, dude, I'm telling you, something has shifted.<eos> I mean, he even asked to read my work.<eos> The essays, the articles I wrote about Jason.<eos> - Your dad did?
- I am so glad that you are done with that family. - "Done"?<eos> I love Jughead.<eos> He's as much my family as you are, more so right now.<eos> You are not going anywhere, young lady.<eos> I am going to look for Jughead.<eos> Do not push me tonight, Mom, because I will push back.<eos> If FP confesses, he might drag us into this.<eos> Talk about our dealings with the Serpents.<eos> But at least we'll know if Dad hired him to...<eos> And if he did?
With Teddy just now, there was a thing.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Also, stop doing that.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Coming up to me with your concern.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You didn't choose me.<eos> Nobody does.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> It's right over here.<eos> I wanted to say... if you haven't heard this already, and I'm certainly not alone in this assessment, that I am grateful beyond words that you are our rightful Bren'in.<eos> Only because you, above all, know the power of peace over war.<eos> We never picked a fight with those flossties.<eos> You know, that's why they been leavin' us alone all these many years.<eos> But may I ask, are you forgiving him?<eos> Or are you thinkin' something more dire will be his fate?<eos> He did kill our Bren'in, like him or not.<eos> Yes. He did.
I like to drop off doughnuts, show my appreciation.<eos> You haven't taken Mom on a date in six months, and you come here once a week?<eos> I bring your mama doughnuts, too.<eos> Wait a minute, is that Kevin Wilson?<eos> I didn't know he joined the army.<eos> Oh, you mean that kid that lived down the block?<eos> Well, so it is.<eos> Well, give him a doughnut and thank him for his service. No.<eos> I don't like Kevin Wilson.<eos> None of us do.
Had some trouble sleeping.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Nothing a few new shower curtains can't fix.<eos> Your order, right.<eos> It... it came in last night.<eos> I'll go get it from the back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Man, you are a life-saver.<eos> I can imagine you go through a lot of these.<eos> Yes, yes, we... we do, actually.
Oh, it should be on my desk.<eos> Hey, Kay, I just...<eos> I wanted to say, um, I love you.<eos> You've been a really great friend to me.<eos> Lockdown's got you sentimental.<eos> I love you too, babe.<eos> Kennedy?<eos> Are you there? Did you find the speakers?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Okay.<eos> Are you shaking?<eos> No, I just, um... ju...<eos> Holden Matthews.<eos> Am I the first girl to be brought up to your bedroom?<eos> Well, one of the gazillion things I missed was hanging out with girls.<eos> There, I said it.<eos> So, I take it you don't have a girlfriend?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I did.
- Gorgeous.<eos> Darling.<eos> I love your suit.<eos> Je l'aime bien!<eos> I'm shocked she got out of bed this morning.<eos> I would have slept till I was dead.<eos> What are you two going on about?<eos> Her man's got another girl.<eos> Everyone knew.<eos> Now she does too.
- Zelda, we...<eos> - We what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> One minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and...<eos> There is a baby that has been squawling for an hour.<eos> Please do something to make it stop.<eos> I don't hear a baby, sir.<eos> You don't?
There's a baseball game this afternoon.<eos> I wrote.<eos> I wrote this novel.<eos> But it's not a book that any of you will ever assign or value.<eos> Or even understand.<eos> No book of mine will ever be.<eos> And all the writing I've done, and will do, is in spite of you.<eos> You teach with two goals:<eos> To prop up literature that is long dead, and to curry favor with the wealthiest students just so that you can indulge in the fantasy that you belong to their world.<eos> You don't.
Off to battle.<eos> Wish me well.<eos> - ♫ A cozy room ♫ - Oh, damn.<eos> Where are my shirts?<eos> This business of laundry: you wash a thing, then you have to wash it again and again and again and again.<eos> I ask you, what is the point?<eos> Let's not wear any clothes.<eos> We're at the beach.<eos> Who needs them?<eos> We certainly don't.
- Um, yes, I do. Yes.<eos> Yes, yes, I do.<eos> So, you come down to these kinds of parties often then, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Your poetic soul.<eos> I saw it the moment we met.<eos> Not something all men have.<eos> When one does, one does.
I have no experience with them.<eos> You're missing everything, darling.<eos> Oh, then I suppose I shall have to get to know some.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Here, here.<eos> I haven't thrown a dart since I was a young man.<eos> It's like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, did Zelda mention the family supper?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
You know, sometimes you just got to say to the wife, "You know, maybe you should get a job. "Then you can tell me not to go to strip clubs."<eos> I'm a lady.<eos> I can say it.<eos> And, well, gentlemen, thank you so much for your time today.<eos> And I look forward to hearing from you soon.<eos> Yes, you'll have our decision within two to three weeks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you two take care.<eos> Bye.<eos> - You did great!
We know she knows we're not handsome.<eos> The question becomes, you think she knows that we know that she knows we're not handsome?<eos> That's too much thinking for me.<eos> Hey, how's, how's Allie doing?<eos> You talk?<eos> A bit.<eos> She seems good.<eos> You know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You doing okay?
Not now.<eos> Really?<eos> If you want to live down here, in my world... yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's enough.<eos> That's enough.<eos> - You good?<eos> - Good.<eos> Did they find her?<eos> Yeah, they did.
No one saw it coming.<eos> I mean, she was 400 pounds and she screamed at the news a lot, but hindsight's 20/20.<eos> Mom, I'm so sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> I had an idea about that Snapchat piece.<eos> I shouldn't have let her eat the whole cake!<eos> Can you hang on just one second?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> - Ravenous!<eos> What if instead of doing it on the show, we did it on Snapchat?
I'm supposed to have my snack at 2:30!<eos> Katie.<eos> Stamps.<eos> Who's yelling like that?<eos> Sounds like the Pathmark by me that's all Hispanic now.<eos> It's Chuck, about his snack.<eos> What?<eos> You told me he got his snack at 3:00.<eos> I'm so mad I could spit bullets!<eos> I... did I?
No, I won't.<eos> Because a bear's gonna rip out my uterus right now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting my story whether you like it or not.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> And how are you gonna get to the other side of the park, missy?<eos> 'Cause I'm sure as heck not driving you!<eos> I'm riding a bike!<eos> You don't know how!<eos> Yes, I do.
Goodness!<eos> That was clever.<eos> I didn't even ring the bell.<eos> Welcome home, Nurse Franklin.<eos> I trust you had a pleasant voyage.<eos> I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.<eos> Sister Julienne?<eos> Lucy.<eos> The doctor say that if she wakes soon she has a very good chance of getting better.<eos> But if she doesn't?
Okay.<eos> I am being set up by Olivia Pope.<eos> She is trying to frame me for murdering Frankie.<eos> She is trying to steal the presidency.<eos> That is what is going on here, and I am not going to let it happen, okay?<eos> Now, I just need to take a minute and make some calls. I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.
Let me guess.<eos> Your wife won't do what you want her to do.<eos> If you were my man, working all day so I could stay at home... which, uh let's face it... it was a bitch when they were little, but... but now they're both teens and in school all day.<eos> Private school, too.<eos> Even though you pay a shit-pot full of state taxes and live in a top-rated public school district... who's never missed a mortgage payment?<eos> Marty Byrde.<eos> Nice home on a quarter-acre squared-off lot in the suburbs?<eos> Marty fucking Byrde. Putting presents underneath the tree since 2002.<eos> Not only would I not cheat on you but I... I'd let you do anything... you... wanted.<eos> Do me a favor.
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.<eos> Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.<eos> Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.<eos> Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're not guilty of your father's crimes. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Because I need your help, and you need mine.<eos> Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?<eos> I did.
My enemies are in the Red Keep.<eos> What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?<eos> A smart one.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> - I would never presume to...<eos> - I'm at war.<eos> I'm losing.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.
No, I won't.<eos> Because a bear's gonna rip out my uterus right now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting my story whether you like it or not.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> And how are you gonna get to the other side of the park, missy?<eos> 'Cause I'm sure as heck not driving you!<eos> I'm riding a bike!<eos> You don't know how!<eos> Yes, I do.
Ooh, glass.<eos> Oh, sorry, sorry. Ah!<eos> More glass!<eos> See, Corey?<eos> That's why we practice.<eos> She knows.<eos> She knows.<eos> My mom knows about us.<eos> How?<eos> No, I didn't.
Oh, sorry, sorry. Ah!<eos> More glass!<eos> See, Corey?<eos> That's why we practice.<eos> She knows.<eos> She knows.<eos> My mom knows about us.<eos> How?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> But now I do.
I said, "Take off everything" except for the little green phone."<eos> There you go, this is Biscuit Blitz.<eos> This is what everyone's talking about?<eos> All you do is line up the little pretend biscuits,<eos> - and then... oh, they explode.<eos> - Mmm, good!<eos> It talks.<eos> Hey, how are ya?<eos> I'm Chuck, and I... love you.<eos> Just do that one, right there.
- No one thinks you're sleeping together.<eos> I thought you were brother and sister.<eos> I don't think about either of you sleeping with anyone.<eos> Katie, you're always, like, doing puzzles.<eos> Some say sex is the ultimate puzzle.<eos> Yeah, see?<eos> You say stuff like that.<eos> Greg, can you even have sex?<eos> You told me yourself - you don't have genitals.<eos> - No, I did not.
And shame on you, Gregorious, for allowing yourself to be seduced by a pretty face spewing lies.<eos> No, you're not gonna spin this and get us off track.<eos> Do you really think I'm pretty?<eos> Look, this isn't easy, you know?<eos> I don't want you and the rest of the family to hate me.<eos> I'm sick of being alone on Saint Wiggin's Day, eating store-bought crumb fairy, but what choice do I have?<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> Suppose I was responsible for this hack, what then?<eos> Do you two own a cable news network on which to expose me?<eos> Because I do.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you, Mom.<eos> Or Gene.<eos> That guy's the man.<eos> You know, I-I know it took a lot for you to get tough with me, but I'm so happy that you did.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> You're welcome, pumpkin.<eos> And thanks for finally seeing me as a gwown-up.<eos> I'm glad having your mom at the office hasn't ruined your life.<eos> I need a mom sometimes.<eos> We all do.
I know you took the money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Chayton Dockery's collateral: 150,000 in cash.<eos> Trial starts today.<eos> It's in the safe.<eos> Audrey, I looked.<eos> Okay?<eos> What I don't understand is why you lied to me, made me think you changed the combination because I'm addle-brained.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You did.
There's no way it traces back to you.<eos> Is there a guard you don't like?<eos> Just one?<eos> Give me a name.<eos> Keith Bosko.<eos> We'll blame it on Keith Bosko.<eos> You'll be dead.<eos> Keith Bosko gave him the belt.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> Do me this kindness.
What happened with the kid?<eos> Decision was made to bring in a freelancer.<eos> To convince Holden to meet with Frost.<eos> But... the thinking was maybe... maybe someone more like him.<eos> Charlie Singer.<eos> You sent that nutjob after Holden?<eos> It wasn't my decision.<eos> But Frost is the boss.<eos> From the jump, I said we needed to bring that kid in, by any means necessary.<eos> You did.
- What? Highway 65 should buy Wheelin' Dealin' without delay.<eos> With what, your money?<eos> Of course.<eos> Rayna, I really think you need to do this.<eos> This is the next step in making Highway 65 what you want it to be.<eos> Luke Wheeler is not gonna sell me Wheelin' Dealin'.<eos> You realize that we were supposed to get married.<eos> I left him at the altar.<eos> Right. You think I don't know that?<eos> Of course you do.
But then sometimes he's just like completely gone.<eos> Well, my baby, I would spare you all the hurt in the world if I could, but I can't.<eos> I fell in love with a messed up alcoholic.<eos> Wasted years of my life trying to figure that out.<eos> Got it wrong most of the time.<eos> I mean, we're good now, but... I'm not sitting in judgment of anybody.<eos> I just hope...<eos> What?<eos> I just hope you know you deserve to be happy.<eos> Everybody does.
Keb' Mo' is amazing.<eos> So are you.<eos> I didn't expect to see you again.<eos> I do the unexpected.<eos> Look, you should let me go.<eos> - Why would I do that?<eos> - Because I scare you.<eos> Well, that's a reason not to let you go.<eos> Okay, that makes no sense.<eos> Yes, it does.
If you're lucky, lots of times.<eos> I remember the day that Deacon and I were together.<eos> We were at his lake house in the woods.<eos> It was a beautiful misty day, and we just had this huge fight.<eos> I don't remember what it was about.<eos> And I got so mad I just decided I'm walking away.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> But as I walked away, I remember thinking to myself, but if he comes after me right now and he gets me, then I'll be with him forever.<eos> And he did?
"My working week, my Sunday rest.<eos> "My Noon... "Midnight...<eos> "My talk... My song.<eos> "I thought that love would last forever.<eos> I was wrong."<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'll take that for you.<eos> I never know what to say at these moments.<eos> Oh, nobody does.
- Okay,<eos> - I'm coming in.<eos> - No. That's not what I meant.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> Come here.<eos> I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.
I know what you meant.<eos> Come here.<eos> I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.<eos> They all think I'm this spoiled brat. - Oh, come on... - I know.<eos> And they think I'm the worst. And so does Clay.<eos> No, he does not.
- Hey.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Uh, nothing.<eos> Just people being mean.<eos> I just reacted, you know.<eos> I didn't even think.<eos> And now everyone's making me into all types of things.<eos> And even you think it was my fault.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I didn't, baby.
She's part of a support group that may or may not be a death cult.<eos> Holden drew an arch that looked just like that.<eos> So... what does Holden have to do with these people?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But you should stay away from them.<eos> Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
He's wonderful... handsome, polite, a doctor.<eos> And at your age, Helen...<eos> See, she's not really thinking about the words before she says them.<eos> It's just pure stream of consciousness, what you're hearing right now.<eos> - I like it.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Anyone would be an improvement after your first husband.<eos> So how is Noah?<eos> Do they know who stabbed him?<eos> No, they don't.
The kids could come down.<eos> And they shouldn't see me.<eos> The kids?<eos> Also, I don't belong here, Helen.<eos> You've been very nice, but...<eos> You can't go anywhere, not like that.<eos> Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.

You don't know me.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You don't know me!<eos> You don't fuckin' know me. We're okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> - We're okay.<eos> - Don't know me.<eos> Wait.<eos> I like fucking you.<eos> You don't fucking...
The guy.<eos> Your guy.<eos> The one you plucked from relative obscurity.<eos> Left the White House for, hitched your wagon to.<eos> The one.<eos> Some people have it, Red.<eos> A brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Of course, the strong jaw and glorious hairline don't exactly hurt, either.<eos> Fitz had it.<eos> Frankie does, too.
The election's over.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> - I'm not wrong.<eos> - You're wrong! Sir, opening up this investigation into Cyrus Beene based on some random voicemail and 20 seconds of video footage that's clearly been taken out of context...<eos> I made a decision.<eos> You are being played.<eos> The warrant was served by the attorney general himself, who accompanied Vice President-Elect Beene to Maryland Hamilton Federal Penitentiary.<eos> Tell me you're not seriously considering making this a death-penalty case against Cyrus.<eos> The chief of staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The president does.
No.<eos> You have to go.<eos> I said go!<eos> Fine.<eos> Dumb old drunk.<eos> My God. It is him.<eos> We saw you sitting over here and wanted to say hi.<eos> We watch your show every day.<eos> I thought I made myself clear.<eos> - You did.
Christ.<eos> We need to get him to open up.<eos> Sad bro, you okay over there?<eos> If you could be any animal, what kind of animal would you be?<eos> I'd be a shark, 'cause they never stop moving.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> But you know what, enough about me, right?<eos> Let's talk about you.<eos> You like music?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
Starting the anastomosis.<eos> - Blood pressure is leveling off.<eos> - Great.<eos> You okay?<eos> I got too involved.<eos> I risked her life.<eos> She's gonna be fine, Maggie.<eos> How do you always keep the emotion out of the OR?<eos> I wish I was a doctor robot.<eos> No, you don't.
You're gonna call her now?<eos> Oh, my God, can you please just do what I say?<eos> And hurry up and get changed.<eos> I can't wear this?<eos> So... I'm...<eos> That's a very nice pantsuit.<eos> Nordstrom Rack.<eos> You like Nordstrom Rack?<eos> I think I probably do.<eos> You do.
You can't just keep showing up unannounced.<eos> You think I'm not good enough for this place..<eos> - No, I didn't mean that.<eos> - Well, I was good enough once!<eos> I know I don't deserve another chance.<eos> I'm sorry, love.<eos> Sometimes I...<eos> I just don't think.<eos> That's right, Gloria.<eos> You don't.
She starts pitching.<eos> Dropping like a stone and...<eos> I tried to... pull up, but... she's not responding.<eos> Jesus Christ, Freddie...<eos> At the last moment I just caught some wind.<eos> Just enough.<eos> And all I can think about is Emma.<eos> What happens if one day someone comes with news that I just didn't make it?<eos> She knows the risks.<eos> She doesn't. She doesn't. Not really.
I'm a flirt and I drink too much. And I'll mess it all up in the end. I always do.<eos> You WERE sweet on me?<eos> Not any more?<eos> If this is just to make me stay in the band...<eos> You're not that good, Bets.<eos> I could have Hildy Simmons on that stage by noon tomorrow.<eos> Hildy Simmons?<eos> Hildy Simmons has a voice like a strangled...<eos> I take it, you saw the paper this morning?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sorry.<eos> Back off.<eos> You sure?<eos> Everybody has favorite shortcuts.<eos> He just wanted to take Fountain.<eos> Tell me, Ms. Benitez, why shouldn't I admit testimony from Detective Bosch's civil trial?<eos> It's irrelevant.<eos> Defense's intent here is obvious and exclusively prejudicial.<eos> It establishes a disturbing and career-long pattern of rogue behavior by Detective Bosch.<eos> It does nothing of the kind.
Did my brother get away?<eos> We must pray to God he will.<eos> Jasper!<eos> Welcome to Westminster, Henry?<eos> Come.<eos> Jasper. How are you?<eos> My Lady Margaret.<eos> Who would have thought to find us here like this with Henry on the throne.<eos> I did.<eos> I always did.
- There's someone among us? Working for them?<eos> That place, those people... that was my whole life, my whole world.<eos> But I couldn't stay.<eos> I couldn't keep living with that fear.<eos> I was so scared every minute, every day.<eos> Then, finally, I say, "I want to leave."<eos> And the leader... We called him Father.<eos> Father says to me, "You can't leave,<eos> "because even if you do, I'll come to you in your dreams."<eos> And he did.
Sorry,ma'am.<eos> Wendy's mom couldn't babysit today.<eos> But we can keep cracking away at that prologue.<eos> I've got some exciting ideas.<eos> I hope one of them is changing out of that shroud of urine.<eos> - Say bye-bye.<eos> - It doesn't have to say goodbye.<eos> Remember that we have the fundraiser<eos> - for the library tonight.<eos> - I do, yes.
Oh, how about something like this?<eos> Only all white.<eos> That's how she liked her neighborhood, too.<eos> Is she the same size she used to be?<eos> Last time you saw her how'd she look?<eos> Angry.<eos> It was not a great visit.<eos> Well, why should this time be any different?<eos> Because I told her I was gay.<eos> Oh, my God, you did?
[man] Let's go.<eos> But the other guys aren't here yet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Franklin hands it to Livingston, Livingston hands it to Jefferson,<eos> Jefferson gives it to me, and I do this.<eos> ♪ Mr. Sherman, I say you should write it ♪<eos> ♪ You are never controversial As it were ♪<eos> - ♪ That is true ♪ - ♪ Whereas if I'm the one to do it ♪<eos> ♪ They'll run their quill pens Through it ♪ ♪ I'm obnoxious and disliked You know that, sir ♪<eos> ♪ Yes, I do ♪
You can't do that.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> His face is all over the bloc.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's BB.<eos> [indistinct radio chatter] [tires screech] Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> [indistinct radio chatter]<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
It's not so bad.<eos> We'll decorate, and we'll make it a home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Don't blame me.<eos> I told you what was gonna happen, and then it happened.<eos> They killed everyone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You work for them.<eos> So does your father.
125 Krusty Burgers?<eos> No!<eos> That's not what I... Fine.<eos> Can I really toss this thing she's so crazy about?<eos> Damn right I can!<eos> I'm bad to the bone!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm your guilt.<eos> I don't have any guilt.<eos> You do now.
Where?<eos> She didn't say.<eos> Alone?<eos> Had a visitor.<eos> Is she coming back?<eos> 'Spect so.<eos> She didn't say.<eos> I thought I would die today.<eos> I too.<eos> But when I did not,
Okay.<eos> Sam, she's...<eos> I promise you, she's really... she's gonna look after you, okay?<eos> - I'm here to help. Okay?<eos> - I'm really sorry.<eos> I gotta go, Sammy, okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey, Butch, what's up?<eos> How you doing, Butch?
I promise you, she's really... she's gonna look after you, okay?<eos> - I'm here to help. Okay?<eos> - I'm really sorry.<eos> I gotta go, Sammy, okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey, Butch, what's up?<eos> How you doing, Butch?<eos> What up?<eos> How you doing, man?
What about Luke?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom, don't!<eos> Mom, come out and talk to me, please.<eos> I'm supposed to look after you, not the other way around.<eos> I still need you.<eos> You never needed me.<eos> Well, I do now.
You mean she wants his ashes.<eos> Sure.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's not the same as wanting him.<eos> It's more like the memory of him.<eos> Are you saying she doesn't deserve that?<eos> Is there a reason why you're holding on to them?<eos> Why you haven't spread them?<eos> I kept them because nobody else wanted them.<eos> Now someone does.
Why didn't you tell me this last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to step on your moment.<eos> You were so happy about Louis' offer.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna take the day to enjoy my life as a free man.<eos> And then tomorrow... I'm gonna start all over again.<eos> Hey.<eos> Ray's downstairs waiting for you.<eos> I didn't call him.<eos> I did.
What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This is wonderful.<eos> I thought maybe you wanted to get dinner tonight.<eos> There is nothing I would rather do than get dinner with you, but I can't tonight.<eos> I wish you would have called.<eos> I would have, but, uh...<eos> You didn't have my phone number.<eos> No, I didn't.
- What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't even want him to be here in the first place.<eos> - Well, I want him here now.<eos> - Louis, I thought you were a more forgiving person than this.<eos> - And I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> - And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> - Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> - no, I don't.
Put that on my tab.<eos> I'm Lewis.<eos> Lara.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> I don't make a habit of talking to ladies in bars.<eos> I got to tell you, you're about the hottest thing I've seen since fire.<eos> Well, thank you, Lewis.<eos> So you like America, huh?<eos> Who doesn't?
Jesse Custer.<eos> I'm not with them.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Did she go down okay?<eos> - Yes, Ma'am.<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> Someplace I can keep Gracie safe.<eos> One sec.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> How you doing?
Your chances will be one in 20.<eos> Pick a number.<eos> Nine.<eos> So you have a second cycle.<eos> This is the ultimate casino.<eos> The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.<eos> I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.
I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> And she died six months later, fulfilled.<eos> Actually, this is my last week here.<eos> I'm not a gambler.<eos> Do you know any couple desperate enough to try illegal...?<eos> Surrogacy?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.
He probably didn't know how hard it would be to clean out.<eos> - And now magic is failing on earth... Because of shit, proving once again that comedy and tragedy can coexist in the same goddamn sentence.<eos> Honestly...<eos> I am in over my head.<eos> I am not even in control of which world my body is awake in, and my sexually aggressive wife, she could wake me up at any moment in Fillory.<eos> - Eliot, there are certain student/teacher boundaries which I'd prefer not to cross.<eos> - So what am I supposed to do, Henry?<eos> - What did you think was going to happen when you dove headfirst into another world?<eos> - I thought I'd die.<eos> - But you didn't.
These all sound like songs Joni Mitchell jerks off to.<eos> It's not me.<eos> - I'm cool.<eos> - You're hip.<eos> You're fab, you're totally gear.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know, man, why don't you just call it Sophia's Joint.<eos> Change it when you think of something better.<eos> We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?
- Sophia.<eos> You're a woman who started a business from nothing.<eos> You pushed through the pins and made an impression on the world that wasn't there before.<eos> If you quit now, you're just a girl with a bunch of old clothes.<eos> That jumpsuit is good.<eos> It'll sell.<eos> Kaavi's website is perfect.<eos> You believe me when I say it's gonna be okay. Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
This woman wants to know that she's special to this firm.<eos> If I walk in there by myself, she's gonna laugh me out of the room.<eos> Then why didn't you tell that to Harvey?<eos> Because I know how important Mike is to him and I didn't want to let him down.<eos> - Then don't.<eos> - That is not--<eos> Louis, if this woman needs to know she's special to us, there's more than one way to do it and Harvey's not the only one you can bring.<eos> Donna, that's great.<eos> But this meeting is tomorrow and I don't even know these new associates yet.<eos> Yes, you do.
Are you sure that's what they want, Or is that just what you did?<eos> No, I talked about terrorism and cyber stuff.<eos> And they reminded me. That we have whole divisions devoted to that. And asked how I would deploy them.<eos> So skip my mistake and explain your process. And concentrate on how the lapd needs a leader in that office.<eos> Such as you.<eos> Hey, I'm really young.<eos> And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You come in here,<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> I'm taking Elisa Marie to my place.<eos> She's not safe with you.<eos> It's my weekend, Joey!<eos> The court said so!<eos> And it's gonna be your last fuckin' weekend.<eos> Don't try doing anything, Joey!<eos> I'm warning you!<eos> Don't!
Is that a Jewish thing?<eos> It's a human being thing.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Look, I get it, things went sideways on your last job and it threw you.<eos> But this is not the answer. This is what you do.<eos> Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
Okay.<eos> What are you doing with that stool?<eos> Holding it.<eos> What are you doing with that beer?<eos> Drinking it.<eos> 'Til the end of the world, right?<eos> Hey, asshole.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I'm talking to you.<eos> Let's go. I don't have all day.<eos> No. You don't.
- Do you really think there's a cure?<eos> - Mmm. Yes. The baka said so.<eos> - Chewbacca?<eos> - No. The baka.<eos> Baka is "grandmother" in Serbian. I'm learning so much!<eos> - You seem a little manic, honey.<eos> - Well, I feel really manic.<eos> It's exciting, there could be a cure. You could be eating pizza in a week.<eos> - Don't you want to be cured?<eos> - Of course I do.
Look, unless he pleads to murder, I say try the case.<eos> Me too, but I have no input.<eos> I'm off the case. I'm so sorry about all of this, Rafael.<eos> What I did was wrong, but the truth is I'd do it again.<eos> Not everything done in the dark is shameful.<eos> So now what?<eos> I have a meeting with the DA in five minutes.<eos> He'll tell me what happens next.<eos> You know, I love this job.<eos> Oh, I really do, but sometimes...
- Well, the head in the freezer belongs to John Gleason. He's also the owner of the house.<eos> Sanitation worker, retired with full disability five years ago.<eos> Now he only has one living relative. It's a sister in St. Louis.<eos> The last time they spoke, he told her that he took on a boarder.<eos> He rented a room to Russell Tillman, who killed him.<eos> Now it looks like Tillman kept cashing the disability checks.<eos> The last one was cashed at a BofA on 40th Street ten minutes ago.<eos> It's right near Gleason's house.<eos> All right, does Gleason have a car registered in his name?<eos> Yes, he does. 2005 red Silverado.
- I just wanna know what the hell is...<eos> - Hey, we got a car at every exit.<eos> All right, I want every staff member, every resident separated.<eos> Secure the crime scene.<eos> Not a single person leaves.<eos> You make your decision?<eos> Give me that key.<eos> Back up, everybody back up on the wall. Back up on the wall.<eos> Okay, someone needs to tell us what's going on.<eos> No, we don't.
Hey,<eos> I'll give you a minute.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> Is that your girlfriend?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You ever find anyone to claim Sam?<eos> No, I didn't.
"The Prince will arrive first at the meeting point..." Very best of luck with that!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Oh, please!<eos> As if you've ever been early to anything in your life!<eos> Blah-blah-blah, protocol, protocol, protocol!<eos> "...with the introductions effected by the two retinues, "at which point, the Princess and the Prince..."<eos> That should be the other way round, surely?<eos> ".. Will strip to the waist and wrestle in the filth "and detritus of the forest floor."<eos> It doesn't say that. Um...<eos> No, it doesn't!
Stu is saying that since all eight companies have now licensed the patent, he has a stronger case against us, so, um, he'd actually like m-more money.<eos> How much?<eos> Three hundred thousand dollars.<eos> So, we just ate the Wheat Thin, didn't we?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see any Wheat Thins.<eos> Shall I add them to your shopping list?<eos> Eh, sure.<eos> Well, let's hope that Melcher doesn't hear about all this.<eos> You guys don't need all these lights on, do you?<eos> Yes, we do.
I can't give up.<eos> Stem cells can turn into any part of the body.<eos> Instead of curing you, they could form a mass or a tumor.<eos> Please, don't get anymore injections.<eos> I have to.<eos> I love Julia more than anything, but there are... intimacies that I can't provide.<eos> Our bond is built on hope.<eos> It's what holds us together.<eos> So it doesn't matter if you believe the treatments won't work.<eos> Julia does.
It's for Mr. Kessler, the man who saved your son.<eos> They need to operate on him immediately.<eos> But it was promised to us!<eos> We've been waiting for it.<eos> Plus that man would want Dustin to have it.<eos> There can't be a bigger emergency than this.<eos> My son is dying.<eos> Are you just gonna stand there and do nothing?<eos> Mrs. Banks, Dustin still has options, other ways of continuing to warm.<eos> Mr. Kessler does not.
Right now, we need to find Aida, and the first step is figuring out what she wants.<eos> Well, that's simple.<eos> She wants to live.<eos> I'm still feeling very optimistic about this mission.<eos> I bear much of the blame for this Aida situation.<eos> Science and technology are my responsibility... it's not your fault.<eos> I knew the risks that came with using powerful autonomous machinery.<eos> I knew the dangers and... and you thought I was one of them.<eos> You didn't want that technology to fall under the control of a director you didn't know.<eos> No, I did not.
We both know that's not true, Leopold.<eos> I took the base offline.<eos> You're no longer in the system.<eos> There's nowhere for you to go.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> Guess now we know what your power is.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
Yo-Yo.<eos> Mack?<eos> Mack...<eos> Mack!<eos> Mack.<eos> That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> - I do.
I want to be with you.<eos> I know, Firefly.<eos> You're just gonna have to stick it out a little longer here, till things are safer back home.<eos> It's not safe here, either.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Hey, Amber, what do you mean by that?<eos> Aunt Megan, she had a monster inside of her.<eos> We took care of that, didn't we?<eos> You saw it leave.<eos> We both did.
I fail to see how this concerns me.<eos> Margaret Wells is behind it.<eos> You could have had her whipped and transported but you left her at liberty.<eos> Justice cannot stoop to a pointless vendetta between two bawds.<eos> What exactly did justice stoop to when it asked me to kidnap an innocent girl?<eos> This is a trifling matter, madam.<eos> Take your scandal sheet and go.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions.<eos> As you and your powerful friends do.
But you're gonna find him that morning.<eos> How? How would someone find you?<eos> Well, if someone really knew me, I post sometimes on the same forum, I guess.<eos> Neo-traditional music forum.<eos> I'm in a fight with this guy, Greg12, about whether Willie Nelson fucked up Pancho and Lefty.<eos> Don't pick a fight with Willie.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Who doesn't love Willie?<eos> No one.<eos> I do.
And you, Benvolio, are nothing more than a gutter scoundrel.<eos> Unprincipled, undisciplined...<eos> Often drunk.<eos> So why is it that the only person fighting for your life is a woman you took from her home whose honor must now and forever be held in question... a woman who should hate you more than any man on Earth?<eos> Because Rosaline Capulet is my friend.<eos> I trust her. And she trusts me.<eos> You've tricked her into trusting you.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she does.
Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.<eos> You know Linda from Marketing?<eos> yeah.<eos> She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
My mom's sick.<eos> That's what I need to be focused on.<eos> I should be helping other people.<eos> And maybe I should, too.<eos> Like, lately, I've been doing crazier and crazier stuff... and I'm never satisfied.<eos> And maybe that's because I'm only thinking about myself.<eos> Like with this doctor, she's in town to save my mom's life and all I can think about is she's taken my bedroom.<eos> - So, did you want something?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do, Ramona.
- Who are you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who I am.<eos> What matters is I know what you do.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.<eos> - I know that you're officially a headhunter, but unofficially, you meet your exclusively male clients at places like this.<eos> I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...<eos> - all right, I've heard enough.<eos> And you don't have proof of anything.<eos> - Actually, I do.
So you can say no if you want to, but don't say I haven't changed.<eos> Because the Mike you met that night in prison never would have told you the truth just now.<eos> Julius, please.<eos> I need this.<eos> This is the address.<eos> It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
Christine.<eos> Lila. Peter.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's her name?<eos> She hasn't said anything since we picked her up.<eos> Here, try and get some rest.<eos> Hey do you want blueberries?<eos> No, chocolate chips.<eos> - For breakfast?<eos> - Daddy does it.
Yeah, man.<eos> I got something I got to do now.<eos> Yeah. We got you, scumbag.<eos> You don't fucking take shit that doesn't fucking belong to you, bitch!<eos> Dennis, stop, man.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What are you going to do with him?<eos> Give them the money we brought over and give him back. Tell them to get lost.<eos> You got money over?<eos> We did.
You know, making sure there's no unfinished business.<eos> Well, of course there's unfinished business.<eos> She didn't get to live her life.<eos> We... we just wanna offer her some peace.<eos> Well, y'all have fun with y'all pretend time.<eos> Here, Suzanne.<eos> I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.<eos> It's reversible.<eos> Thought you'd like it.<eos> Oh, I do!
I even bought one of those new gizmos that everyone's using.<eos> Why'd you close the bar? Well, I've been set up in a high-end establishment by a well-heeled backer.<eos> Really, you should see the heels on this guy.<eos> MoHo House?<eos> Yes, MoHo House, the vaguely British, invitation-only club that celebrities who don't want publicity can be sure to be seen at.<eos> I'm going there now.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> Tonight is the grand opening for the town's hottest new destination, run by the man most in demand for Springfield's haunted houses, Moe Szyslak.<eos> Oh, sorry, force of habit.<eos> - How you doing?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Hello, ma'am. Are you Mrs., Crocker?<eos> - Betty.<eos> - I'm Detective Geils. This is Detective Tanner, L.A.P.D.<eos> We just have some questions about your husband...<eos> What was his fake name?<eos> Joe Crocker.<eos> Do you have any identification?<eos> Yes, we do.
Oh! Can you tell me what "anti-lock brakes" are?<eos> I mean, why should they ever lock?<eos> I believe you're talking about ABS. Which is just a system that allows the wheels to maintain tractive control during sudden stops! What?<eos> What?<eos> Very impressive!<eos> Uh, do you know how to repo a BMW?<eos> No, but I am very proud of myself, because this is my first big purchase without Victor.<eos> Yeah, girl!<eos> You don't need no man!<eos> Actually, I do.
"Thanks," you said. "Thanks for being honest.<eos> "We can work with that." And then the minute you realized what an ass I actually was, you can't handle it, and you bail.<eos> I did not bail.<eos> I had a moment... just one moment of doubt.<eos> I need to know you're in my corner.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello, Tiffany.<eos> We won.<eos> I wasn't sure if you heard.<eos> I did.
Know what this color is?<eos> The playroom, when we first met.<eos> I'm sure it was chosen to soothe the minds of the sad little children visiting prison on Saturday.<eos> I like it.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> You love him, the liar who's not a liar?<eos> I don't know, um...<eos> I think so.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
A new threat, I'm afraid.<eos> A cabal of sorts is after the Spear.<eos> - I'm rounding up the fragments.<eos> - Why?<eos> They're safer apart than they are together.<eos> They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.<eos> Really?<eos> You said the Time Masters couldn't be trusted.<eos> Did I?<eos> Bollocks, so I did.
Go.<eos> Me?<eos> What about him?<eos> I told you I was handling this, now go.<eos> I thought he would never leave.<eos> Finally, darling, we're alone.<eos> What is it going to take to get you off this planet?<eos> It's like I said.<eos> It's going to take two little words<eos> "I do."
- Yeah, whatever.<eos> But I don't understand. Why didn't you just tell me the truth?<eos> I didn't want to scare you.<eos> Okay? I wanted it to be better for you.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> I'm so sorry. Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Better have a good reason.<eos> - I do.
I'm trying to decide whether I should blog my article myself.<eos> Well, what happens if you blob it?<eos> - Blog.<eos> - Right, that's what I said, blob.<eos> Will Snapper get mad or something?<eos> Uh, big time. Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, think fast.<eos> Do you think it's the right thing to do?<eos> - Go.<eos> - Yes. I do.
What, is that supposed to make this better?<eos> Me being the prince doesn't change anything.<eos> Not how I feel about you... This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.<eos> You benefited from its cruelty.<eos> What about that Kryptonian emissary?<eos> Your guard...<eos> Do you even feel guilty?<eos> Of course I do.
- but I do advise caution...<eos> - You brought us together.<eos> Whatever happens, you share in it.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> My emotions are all tied up in it, for sure.<eos> When the market closes tomorrow and we have ridden this thing all the way up, that $125-million number might be... conservative.<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't quit your day job.<eos> Too late.<eos> You didn't.
You didn't.<eos> Not all the way, but close.<eos> I'm selling my share of the firm to my partners.<eos> It's been a long time coming.<eos> Tomorrow is liberation day.<eos> You never tally your sheet until the lockup period is over, but even I have to admit it does feel great.<eos> You did a good thing here, son.<eos> You absolutely did.<eos> I hope that's true, Dad.<eos> I really do.
Okay.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> All right, stand up.<eos> So, you still in touch with Too Sweet?<eos> I am.<eos> He's thriving.<eos> You read my article.<eos> I did.<eos> I did.
Yeah, he does not look well.<eos> I'll be back in a jiff.<eos> Everybody, stand under the sprinklers.<eos> Ramona, thank you, thank you for meeting me!<eos> So great to see you.<eos> So, uh, a gay bar, huh?<eos> Immersion therapy.<eos> You gotta get used to being around gay people, now that I know you hate us.<eos> I don't hate gay people!<eos> No, I don't.
[ Laughs ] - Cannonball!<eos> - Cannonball!<eos> Wouldn't you like to clean off in the pool?<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Wy-Six: Yeah! Cannonball!<eos> Hey, you hanging in there?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> They're all so happy.<eos> It's like they don't even know that they're trapped here.<eos> Well, of course they don't.
I'm not going.<eos> What?<eos> ! You just got invited to a party with the cool kids!<eos> Isn't that what you've always wanted?<eos> If anyone shouldn't go, it's me, but they know you.<eos> They like you!<eos> Unh-unh.<eos> Nobody knows me.<eos> And nobody knows I can bake.<eos> Well, I do, and he does.
Well, it is rather, erm, rather damp.<eos> Do you think we could go and change now?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> - How did the heats go?<eos> - Oh, there weren't any.<eos> Oh, very wise of you.<eos> The old boy wants the results off to the printers, so come on, help me decide the winners.<eos> I've learned it's always the best when these things are worked out over the fire.<eos> Who did well, would you say?<eos> Clutterbuck did well.
Occasionally, in my job, I am told no.<eos> I am told you cannot implement a particular course of action.<eos> And occasionally, in my job, I implement that course of action despite that.<eos> That is what I did in this instance.<eos> I implemented a plan without authorization.<eos> And in this instance, at this time, the plan began to unravel.<eos> Mr. John Lakeman, you're requested on floor two, interview room 216.<eos> Mr. John Lakeman.<eos> Where's the bag?<eos> Doing great, kid.
If we didn't, I might've responded differently when Davina asked me to sacrifice you.<eos> And does our truce extend to my brother, despite your extensive grievances?<eos> Well, yeah, I want to get Sofya back and stop the Hollow.<eos> As long as you guys want the same thing, I don't see why we can't play nice.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, far be it from me to jump to conclusions, but the last time anyone saw my brother, he was on his way here to talk to you.<eos> And you think I have him?<eos> Seriously?<eos> No, I don't.
Oh. Does Marcel know that?<eos> I'd ask him, but I can't find him anywhere.<eos> It is outrageous.<eos> Where is that young man's sense of courtesy?<eos> Now, please... invite me in.<eos> Tell me where Marcel is.<eos> Detained, until we can be sure that he's free of this thing's vile influence.<eos> You Mikaelsons, you always find a way to get right back on top, don't you?<eos> And I bet you got a plan all figured out.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Four of the strongest elders each imbued a part of their magic into a mighty ax.<eos> When the weapon was ready... they relied on her mother, the one who gave her life, to be the one to take her life.<eos> But before she could kill her child,<eos> Inadu cast a final spell.<eos> One powered by her own death.<eos> A curse upon all present that night.<eos> She bound them to the full moon, so that once a month they would turn into the very beasts they used to hunt her.<eos> The Hollow created the werewolf curse.<eos> You bear the mark of the Crescent.<eos> So did she.
It was for the Sandersons.<eos> It was a... It was a dining room set, and I designed each piece just the way he described them.<eos> And you, you brought the deal - in on the number.<eos> - My gosh.<eos> I cannot believe you remember this. Yeah.<eos> I mean, right on the number.<eos> And, at $10,000.<eos> And we went to the Marriott, right?<eos> And we were just gonna, you know, get a few drinks in the bar and then go home.<eos> But we didn't.
Blacks are all over the offices.<eos> - What do the white people have?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Everything.<eos> Territory is off-limits.<eos> Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.
Hey, Lucy, glad you found a way to turn that $5,000 computer into a telephone.<eos> Yeah... yes, I did.<eos> Um, I just wanted to thank you guys for taking care of my loan payment this month.<eos> Uh, I'm totally gonna pay you back.<eos> Right.<eos> No, really.<eos> No, I am. I actually just landed a major new client.<eos> I designed the poster for a pretty big music festival.<eos> They, uh, pay you for that?<eos> Of course they did.
Everything's fine.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Is it about the fighting?<eos> Look, we haven't talked about it, really.<eos> I know you don't like it, but I'm doing what I got to do.<eos> This food wouldn't be here if it wasn't for...<eos> It's not about the fighting.<eos> I like the fighting.<eos> But you...<eos> I didn't at first.
Well, Aurora.<eos> Blame my parents.<eos> Harcross?<eos> Oh, God, I need some air.<eos> I'm pregnant. I'm sorry.<eos> You learn some respect.<eos> Don't be scared. He's fine.<eos> .. always meet outside of Polesford... .. the night Abi was taken...<eos> You don't believe her, do you?<eos> No. I don't. Why?
How much did it cost?<eos> No idea.<eos> Stole it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, actually, because I felt like it.<eos> - What if I steal it from you?<eos> - On you go, then. I don't know how it works.<eos> Well, neither did I.
There's one of these growing outside the student union.<eos> It smells amazing.<eos> Rosemary.<eos> I'm smelling home 20 light years from home.<eos> Thanks for bringing me.<eos> This is a great day out.<eos> I mean, come on, admit it.<eos> You love it.<eos> Did I say I didn't love it?<eos> Yes, I do.
- No, sir. - Have you checked this personally.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - All the way to Hampton?<eos> No, to the steel mill, sir.<eos> Hampton is code for the steel mill. - Code, sir?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, we need to use code, otherwise anyone could walk in here and get you blabbing like a fool.<eos> That's a good point, sir.<eos> Now, these men, what do they know of this material?<eos> No more than I do, sir.
Your oath.<eos> - Give us a coin.<eos> - What?<eos> "The new Lord Sutcliffe was found starving on London's streets..."<eos> The inheritance was contested, everyone got super mad... blah, blah, blah...<eos> "Urchin boy deemed legitimate"! My God!<eos> It worked!<eos> You did it.<eos> You saved them.<eos> You did.
Why?<eos> What do you think you know?<eos> What has he told you?<eos> Because, yeah, he may have a little friend now and, yeah, he may be a little bit distracted but I tell you something, I'm still here and as long as I'm still here, you are going nowhere!<eos> Are you looking for somewhere to live?<eos> That's your house?<eos> Sharing, yeah.<eos> Six of us.<eos> - How do you get into the Tower?<eos> - You don't.
Your Party Dog gave a terrible speech.<eos> You mean the toast Paul did?<eos> I thought that was sweet.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, maybe the dog was barking up the wrong tree.<eos> Yeah, I guess it was sweet in the sense that it forced us all to celebrate two people who got what they wanted at someone else's expense.<eos> Well, maybe Rich married the wrong person the first time around.<eos> It happens.<eos> I'm Jon's second wife, remember?<eos> I do, yeah.
I mean, I'm originally from Tennessee, but we moved there when I was, like, 15.<eos> Okay, you and the... uh, the sunflower?<eos> No, no, he's... he was... the sunflower was always from Boston.<eos> All right. And who do we have here?<eos> Uh, Eddie...<eos> Show him your thing.<eos> Uh, Eddie Zeidel. Is that correct?<eos> That's close enough, Monty!<eos> Well, Ron and Eddie from Boston and formerly from Tennessee, do either of you have a hard-boiled egg? We do!<eos> We do, Monty.
Yes.<eos> But do you want to know what I've really been thinking about?<eos> It's light, because light from this candelabra, say, is a wave, just like sound.<eos> But if waves travel better through denser materials, then why can I put up my hand and block out the brightest of lights?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, then how do we know it's there?<eos> We don't.
Roaches, mice, Lucifer himself.<eos> Julius, that's enough.<eos> No, the devil is conspiring to turn this world into hatred and sin.<eos> His agents are among us.<eos> I hear them.<eos> Open your ears!<eos> Julius.<eos> It's growing colder, isn't it?<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You never did.
Okay.<eos> You weren't lying.<eos> That's big.<eos> He's at St. Daniel's. Injuries don't appear to be lifethreatening.<eos> And you need my help because...<eos> Delilah's trans.<eos> If I represent her, that's one too many trans people at the table.<eos> If it comes to trial, the jury may not trust you.<eos> Like maybe you've got an axe to grind.<eos> I do.
Wonderful.<eos> One more question.<eos> They want me to declare a religion.<eos> What has that got to do with teaching physics?<eos> It's called the Holy Crown for a reason, Albert.<eos> You must at least pretend to believe in God if you want them to hire you.<eos> Perhaps I'm being foolish.<eos> Why would I leave democratic Switzerland to work for a medieval, warmongering monarchy?<eos> Since when do you care about - the stupidities of politics?<eos> - I don't.
- Yes.<eos> - You didn't go outside at any point? - No.<eos> I didn't go outside at any point.<eos> Yes, only we've got these time-coded photos of you at the party.<eos> But between 6:40pm and 7:15pm, you don't show up in any of 'em.<eos> And Jamie was murdered between five to seven and ten past.<eos> I'm sure there were a lot of guests at the party who don't show up in random photos taken between those times.<eos> Did you see your son while you were up there?<eos> He was running nearby.<eos> No, I didn't.
What? I should back down because of a bunch of vigilantes?<eos> Their daughter was murdered.<eos> And Kevin Russell's been in prison for 14 years.<eos> That damn journalist.<eos> I can just see the headlines:<eos> "Banville defends another paedophile."<eos> Emma, you never read the papers, never watch TV.<eos> Why would you care?<eos> Because...<eos> .. because at the moment I do.
Do you know what it is?<eos> I've never touched gold before.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> It means, one day, this whole town is going to be mad with riches.<eos> You and me, Verity... we've got to be ready for it.<eos> One day, Samuel, you're going to be governor here, master of all Virginia.<eos> I know it and I love you.<eos> Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.
I'll see if Tariq's up.<eos> Yo, Tariq!<eos> You all right, St. Patrick? Yeah.<eos> You know, we lost an inmate last year just like this, weights slipped on his neck and crushed his windpipe.<eos> He was a cop killer, just like you.<eos> Piece of shit.<eos> What you lookin' over there for, man?<eos> The cameras don't work, son.<eos> They ain't worked in over a year.<eos> Too bad, though, if they did.
Oh, this grease ball motherfucker.<eos> He asked for you specifically to do the drop.<eos> - Me?<eos> - He said, "Tommy Egan."<eos> Fuck.<eos> How he knows me too?<eos> I mean, you tell me to lay low, and now you want me to be an errand boy to bribe some mobster?<eos> How do we know that he ain't working for the Feds?<eos> That this ain't some setup for me to get caught - with my dick in a ringer?<eos> - We don't.
You stay on course, I'm guaranteeing you Carson in a year.<eos> Well, f...<eos> Carson in a year, that...<eos> You work my Cellar.<eos> You do your homework.<eos> Is that a promise?<eos> Promise?<eos> Santa Claus makes promises. That's why he's always smiling.<eos> People who make guarantees never smile because they know how much hard fuckin' work it's gonna take.<eos> I don't even... I don't...
Fucked if I know anything at this point.<eos> You know what Goldie's was before it was a comedy club?<eos> Some kind of performance space?<eos> Yeah, we did plays, one-acts, monologues, folk singers.<eos> We even had an act where a gal rode a guy around a stage naked for half an hour.<eos> It was crazy times.<eos> I ate, worked, and slept there.<eos> Changed a lot of Mandy's diapers there too.<eos> Sid left when she was five, and we bumped along another five years, and then I rolled the dice on comedy.<eos> After a while, things did what they did.
The CSI's claimed fish got to them, but now... Plane crash girl and the super Max body both had brains in their stomachs.<eos> Do you think there could be some connection between the two massacres?<eos> I mean, anything's possible, but...<eos> You examined the bodies from the boat party, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Several. And?<eos> And...<eos> Did any of them have brains in their digestive systems?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
Now I can't fall asleep... 'cause I lie here... waiting for the squeak.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I never got to sleep next to her.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I'm not sad. I'm angry.<eos> I hate everyone.<eos> Anyone... laughing or smiling or... being alive is fucking offensive to me and they should all just fucking die.<eos> And eventually, I'm just gonna burn up from rage and then I'll just be dust.<eos> And I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> I do.
Miss Jefferson, please don't make the mistake of thinking we're the enemy.<eos> Everyone wants this to end peacefully.<eos> But we need your help.<eos> If you surrender the hostages, we will do our best to meet your demands.<eos> Do you think I'm not smart?<eos> You think I don't hear those trick words, "Do our best," Miss, uh--<eos> -Reddy.<eos> -Well, my best friend is gone, Miss Reddy.<eos> So, "Do our best" ain't good enough no more.<eos> "Do our best."
I love you guys so much.<eos> Dye is nontoxic.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, you'll probably have bad squirts for a couple days.<eos> And I have some of those wet nappies in the bathroom, if you need them.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I can't even kill myself right.<eos> Honey, your dad and me... we think you need some real help.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah! I do. Of course I fucking do!
How does one destroy an army of clones?<eos> I missed that movie.<eos> Hey, maybe go blonde.<eos> Throw 'em off your scent.<eos> Yeah, I'll be completely anonymous around here as a six-foot-tall blonde.<eos> Yeah, well, change is very important, actually.<eos> When my mom would, uh, catch my dad cheating, she would just... get a new hairdo, wax the bush, try some new eye shadow.<eos> Whatever. - Yeah. And that worked for her?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> But fucking his brother did.
This is all that's left of my people.<eos> Can you save them?<eos> We'll do everything we can.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Tell me something good.<eos> Raven's looking for us.<eos> So Luna's rig is here, and if the fish in these waters are dying, well, basically, we're screwed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> A.L.I.E. said we had 6 months.<eos> We don't.
You've ruined me.<eos> Well, not completely.<eos> I still have my health.<eos> So, how much will it cost if my daughter applies in ten years?<eos> $2,000. That's not so bad.<eos> That's the application fee.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Lisa, do you see them?<eos> The rings of Saturn.<eos> I do.
I'm awake. You were feeding me popcorn.<eos> Why would I stop you?<eos> End of shift.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - We made the deal. - That's it?<eos> We just leave him here like this?<eos> Price of peace.<eos> Not a price I agreed to pay.<eos> - We need to clear out.<eos> - Do we?
I threw you a lifeline, and you decided not to grab it.<eos> It's not my crimes that are dragging us under.<eos> Once I'm mayor of this city, those crimes are gonna benefit everybody.<eos> Greater good justifies all manner of sins, huh?<eos> Come in.<eos> Ma'am, we gotta walk.<eos> Fill in the blanks, Harlee.<eos> Woz wouldn't get tangled up with the Feds on his own accord.<eos> So how did it happen?<eos> It just did.
- Will do.<eos> - All right, thank you.<eos> Hey, how'd it go?<eos> Did you remember how to secure a witness statement?<eos> No, but I got some great school gossip.<eos> Adrian told one of his friends he had to go to the Y.<eos> Gave him his homework to hand in.<eos> Caddie!<eos> Caddie, you in there?<eos> Tess, how we doing?
Some lemonade? Thank you.<eos> Hello?<eos> It says, "Wendy" on my father's phone.<eos> I think you knew him. I...<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> We all have lots of questions about his death, and I was wondering if you maybe had any information.<eos> How'd they treat you down there?<eos> Oh, you know...<eos> You speak to Sheriff Nix?<eos> - My lawyer did.
What did you tell him?<eos> What was said?<eos> What did you speak about?<eos> I told him his father was heartbroken because I left.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> Where you going?<eos> He asked me if I loved his dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What did you say?<eos> That I didn't.
- What?<eos> Somebody fucked with all the wiring.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's been rigged.<eos> - Rigged?<eos> - Yeah, right there.<eos> It's rigged.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> You knew that they were coming after you.<eos> 'Cause somebody fucking did this on purpose, Marty.
I know, but you can't grind me from behind when I've got something sharp next to eyeball.<eos> Let's just stick to the original plan.<eos> Oh, no, Petti...<eos> Pet...<eos> - What'd that douche call you?<eos> - Petirroja. Petirroja, your breasts, "jhey" are... "jhey" are not so petit, but "jhey" are red.<eos> What?<eos> You don't like my cheating accent, mang?<eos> My cheaty, cheaty accent?<eos> Yeah, actually, I kind of do.
If you screw up the combination or you take longer than ten minutes, you're fucked.<eos> Now, basic bitches trip all the standard alarm systems, but Magicians?<eos> We also trip the magic wards, which means... battle Magicians.<eos> Full-time security employees on the DL, with benefits.<eos> You see one, run.<eos> They only ask questions post-mortem.<eos> But our ace is you.<eos> Once we nab prints and drop the wards, you travel straight in.<eos> You really don't think a bank vault, of all places, has anti-traveler protection?<eos> Oh, they do.
- Did anything happen?<eos> Well, a while back, when she was 12, she got very excited about contacting you.<eos> She asked us if we'd mind, and...<eos> Particularly me.<eos> We wondered that it might not turn out how she'd hoped, that the letter might not find you, but she insisted that she wanted to try.<eos> She didn't care what happened.<eos> Did you receive the letter?<eos> Of course you did.<eos> How else would you have our address?<eos> Yes, I did.
You left earlier with Meg.<eos> They were gunning for her.<eos> I didn't wanna give them more ammunition.<eos> - What if they call me?<eos> - Belle...<eos> - Am I supposed to lie on the stand?<eos> - No.<eos> I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?
Never changed for me.<eos> I didn't wanna be responsible for anyone.<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> In some ways... I envy you, Sally.<eos> The only thing you ever cared about... was your family.<eos> For you... it was simple.<eos> Well... whatever it was, Roy... it wasn't simple.<eos> Three of us went out on that boat.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I don't...
I used to believe I was good at something.<eos> So good at this one thing, I didn't bother with anything else.<eos> It was all I needed.<eos> I mean, you thought you were the one handling the snakes, but they'd all had their fangs pulled out while the real evil was slithering right past you. Something like that?<eos> Pretty much exactly that.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> No, I don't think we want the same thing at all.<eos> Keep your pants on.<eos> You had one inside of you?<eos> We all did.
Every time I was bluffing.<eos> You said what a shitty poker face I had.<eos> Well, let me ask you... when did it happen?<eos> It's like that old commercial where they tell people at a fancy restaurant they're drinking decaf instant coffee.<eos> And they act all shocked, like they could tell the difference anyway.<eos> Why would you give up Sidney like this?<eos> I thought you all wanted the same things.<eos> You think I wanted that to happen to Patricia?<eos> I swore an oath to serve the people of this town.<eos> Owen Boyd did.
I'll take those, darling.<eos> Father? Now, can we skip to the end, please?<eos> All right, then.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife!<eos> We're married! We're married!<eos> - We're married!<eos> - We're married!<eos> ♪ Even though I know When you're coming back, baby ♪<eos> I'm gonna get it, though.<eos> Hey, baby. How you doing, man?
- I will.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> It was lovely to meet you all.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Now you're a dead man, what will you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something quiet.<eos> I wonder what happened to Grimes?<eos> - Do you think he's dead?<eos> - No, I don't.
If you are happy there, then... that's where you should be.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> That's lovely, Chuck.<eos> It really is.<eos> I'll go get the kids.<eos> Boss... I received a concerning bit of news.<eos> Mick Danzig just quit.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I just never thought I'd have an issue dating someone in the office.<eos> And I really didn't.
- Hold on, hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hammond.<eos> I need to ask you about this.<eos> Why did you stick "Deshabille" on my car?<eos> Because you were disabled.<eos> DÃ©shabillÃ© means undressed, you moron!<eos> Let's not get bogged down with "Ooh, can't speak French."<eos> Let's get to the point which is, James May, you lost and you broke the company yacht.<eos> - You did.
And that would be a waste of great talent.<eos> Right, another fast dash up the Isn't, and now shifting rapidly down the eight-speed automatic as he arrives at Old Lady's House.<eos> Feeding it precisely through there on this damp track, before opening it up for the broken surface down to Substation. Giving the fixed-rate dampers a good workout here.<eos> Two corners left.<eos> Tidy through there.<eos> Just Field of Sheep to go.<eos> And he's right on the edge of the grip and across the line!<eos> It did look good. It did look good.<eos> - It did look good.<eos> - How did it do?
You promised to protect them.<eos> Trial is forfeit.<eos> It's not our problem anymore.<eos> Oh, I'm about to give your ass one.<eos> I want you to listen real close, lover boy.<eos> Skipping out on you?<eos> Real dick move and I'm sorry for it..<eos> Very, very sorry.<eos> - I don't care anymore.<eos> But I did.
When did you learn to speak French? Today!<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I'm trapped in a time loop.<eos> You had me going there.<eos> If anyone needs me, I'll be effecting repairs to the ship.<eos> L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans I'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> What did you say?<eos> L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans I'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> He said one of the antimatter transducer feeds has been compromised by an impairment in one of the particle accelerators.<eos> I did.
I'm transferring most of the remaining oxygen to your section.<eos> That and the tank should keep you alive long enough for them to get here.<eos> What about you?<eos> Counting on my nanites.<eos> We know for a fact that I can last at least 30 minutes without oxygen.<eos> And what happens after that?<eos> You're still flesh and blood. You can't last forever without oxygen.<eos> I don't need forever.<eos> You don't get to make this call!<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
Of course it is.<eos> Shuttle us in, and I'll gain access using my station ID.<eos> Tabor used to send me all the time.<eos> The head of security was practically on his payroll.<eos> ... " - Us"? - ...<eos> You said, "shuttle us in."<eos> Five's gonna have to come with.<eos> I can get into the storage unit, but I'm going to need someone to hack in so I can access the safety deposit box, and from what I understand, she does that sort of thing?<eos> Thought you said tabor sent you there all the time.<eos> - ... He did.
Every day, I tried to say it, but I could never get the words out.<eos> Say what?<eos> I love you.<eos> I wish I had been better.<eos> Don't you wish you could have been a better daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.
But the kill is mine.<eos> Get up.<eos> There they are.<eos> Hang on.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> Weaponizing the fuel.<eos> You said we need every drop.<eos> We do!
Kemp...<eos> Bottom, a weaver who wants to play everyone else's part as well as his own, and is transformed into an ass.<eos> Not much of a stretch.<eos> I shall be the greatest ass in London.<eos> Do it! Do it! Do it!<eos> Alice?<eos> What?<eos> Would you help me scribe, please?<eos> I need your help.<eos> We all do.
- My ankle! Ah!<eos> - Can you stand? No!<eos> No, I can't!<eos> Without a Titania, we can't go on.<eos> I'll play Titania.<eos> A woman playing a woman?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I know the lines.<eos> But we still don't have an ending!<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
I must see the Father. Man, I do not want to draw on you.<eos> I must see the Father now.<eos> Father Southwell is occupied. You will wait.<eos> Kill me if that's your job.<eos> What care I?<eos> Father, I beg you, save my Owen.<eos> I saw poor Neemes. Yes.<eos> But he is with the Lord now.<eos> Why does God not know that Owen loves him?<eos> He does, Marcus.
Picture?<eos> Oh, from the, um, the exhibit?<eos> Ah, well, it was in a war, and they were very scared.<eos> Did they die?<eos> It was a very long time ago, Johnny.<eos> - Can that happen here?<eos> - No.<eos> But if it did, what would you do?<eos> - It's not gonna happen here.<eos> - But if it did.
My tapes didn't make me the lightning rod I hoped to be, but enough people woke, invested in the vision.<eos> We call this the pantry.<eos> Some say this mess we're in is Revelations,<eos> God's vengeance.<eos> I'll tell you what it is. It's an opportunity.<eos> A new life.<eos> A chance to make amends.<eos> I broke Troy in that old world.<eos> In this one, he has a purpose.<eos> We all do.
Even if there is a secret lab under the spa, that doesn't mean they didn't do it.<eos> Look, someone is trying to crack the secret of the moissanite to allow you to daywalk outside the retreat.<eos> What they haven't figured out yet is that grinding down the rock and isolating the particles and ingesting them isn't enough.<eos> Not by itself.<eos> Wha... what do you mean?<eos> What is it, then?<eos> We haven't had a proper kill in quite a while.<eos> I'm going to really enjoy this.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Pull it up higher?<eos> - I heard you.<eos> Anyway, I just started driving, and... and then I saw that they were hiring here<eos> - That's... that's great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.<eos> I would've figured you were one of those guys who are on a voyage of self-discovery.<eos> Oh. You know, backpacking through Asia, rolling cigars in Cuba.<eos> Or, as Jonah would say, "Coo-ba."<eos> - He does that? - Yeah.
Traffic.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oh, man, traffic will slow things down.<eos> Oh, dude, especially in this town, you know?<eos> - With all the cars.<eos> - Traffic.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So everybody knows about my counseling.<eos> Well, they do now!
Sometimes people do change their minds.<eos> I mean, I met Jerusha when we were both working at my father's hardware store.<eos> I asked her out every day for a year, and then she said yes.<eos> Aww. - Yes. - Okay, actually, that's called a systemic pattern of hostility.<eos> It's, like, the number one thing you can't do. I got a question.<eos> The actress in the video, does she get paid per video, or is it more of a flat rate for the whole day kind of thing?<eos> My guess is flat rate.<eos> Can ignoring someone you're dating be considered harassment?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Of course you don't.
I'm just gonna put a note on here that says "manager error."<eos> It is not an error.<eos> I know what hot is, and I am very, very hot.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> Please hold.<eos> What...<eos> Marcus, what do you know about this pallet?<eos> Are you asking 'cause I'm in charge of the warehouse now?<eos> 'Cause you heard I'm in charge of the warehouse now, right?<eos> I did. Yeah.
And then... or London, Hong Kong, Atlantis?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> - It's confusing.<eos> Oh, wait a minute, Glenn.<eos> It's cool in here again.<eos> Wait.<eos> How?<eos> You fixed it!<eos> I did?<eos> Oh, my God, I did.
- No, no, no.<eos> No, I just didn't realize this store was like Nazi Germany.<eos> Ve must see your documents.<eos> Heil Hitler, Mein Fuhrer.<eos> - Social Security card.<eos> - Great, no problem.<eos> No... no problem.<eos> Do undocumented people have documents?<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Yes.<eos> You know, I don't know if it was part of your plan or a happy accident, but Axelrod has decimated the part of the state where I poll weakest.<eos> He's shown you his neck.<eos> He has.<eos> And you get to become the defender of the people.<eos> And you'll get the governor's mansion for your efforts.<eos> And Connerty's started.<eos> You got one of those Cheroots?<eos> - Fundadores.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.
Three and two, count is full.<eos> I grew up playing stickball.<eos> You wanna grab that broom handle and stand in?<eos> I'll get too intense.<eos> Okay.<eos> People are telling me I can't miss your party.<eos> No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores.<eos> They have no fucking idea why we do what we do.<eos> I don't think I'm any better than them.<eos> Of course you do.
Lieutenant Colonel John Graves Simcoe.<eos> I'm the commander of his Majesty's Queen's Rangers.<eos> I see that.<eos> No militia.<eos> Provincial forces, not militia.<eos> Sorry, sir, only commissioned officers or sponsored guests.<eos> The barman knows me, I rescued his life last Thanksgiving. Hello, friend.<eos> Good Quaker fellow.<eos> You know this man, Mr. Townsend?<eos> Yes, Tommy, I do.
How the hell'd you get here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Tell it.<eos> Tell me, then I'll tell you how I tried to find you and almost got goddamn eaten, how we all almost died because you took the truck and the hotel was overrun.<eos> Alicia, I thought it was safe.<eos> - We checked every room.<eos> - Nowhere is safe.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I almost died after that.<eos> It doesn't.
I'd like to thank Congressman Clarence Clark and his Libertonians.<eos> - I did not approve this!<eos> - Thank you, Congressman.<eos> He's pissing himself!<eos> - Start asking questions!<eos> - Oh. Ooh, beat my wife with a frying pan, it's even hotter today.<eos> Y'all, I'm sorry that Judge couldn't be here to say goodbye.<eos> He went off this morning on a business trip with Stewart to Key West.<eos> Ooh, I bet he went off to one of his special holes.<eos> Hey, you two girls, how you doing?
I teach a burlesque class around the corner.<eos> You should come.<eos> It can, uh, really help you get in touch with your body.<eos> Oh, it's okay, I'm already very in touch with my body.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She's real in touch.<eos> This one's keeping Duracell in business.<eos> Max, I wish you had gotten something at the lingerie store.<eos> That saddle looked really good under you.<eos> Most things do. Did!
I think it's like this.<eos> Now...<eos> And then I think I'm gonna spin around, and we're gonna put your arm around my neck.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then here, like this, and then just sort of in like this.<eos> Melanie, do the moves.<eos> Those are my moves, kid.<eos> I mean, they're the moves that got me cast in the porn dance party in Body Double.<eos> Please, as if you worked with De Palma.<eos> I did. So...
You want another taste?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna be a zombie?<eos> - What?<eos> - A zombie.<eos> It's rad, I swear.<eos> If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping Tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.
I'm all alone and this situation here, it's... it's very new.<eos> Could you just show up to support me?<eos> No, Heather, I can't.<eos> Sia's doing a concert tonight. What do you want to bet that's Anna's press-shy celebrity?<eos> How's knowing that going to stop her from writing that book?<eos> It won't be that hard to stop her.<eos> She may have gotten her teeth fixed, but she's still the same fragile mess with an under bite that I mentored years ago.<eos> - You used to like her.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oddly, I still do.
- What?<eos> No, no, no, we gave you $1,000 to find her.<eos> You must be the smart one.<eos> And the pretty boy here is the muscle.<eos> $1,000 to find her,<eos> $5,000 if you want to see the intel.<eos> - You've got to be joking.<eos> - That's bullshit, man.<eos> - Who's there?<eos> I don't do jokes.
Did you keep me from getting shot in the face, puppy-dog eyes?<eos> That dude's an asshole.<eos> He needs to learn a lesson.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> Just keep your temper.<eos> All right, last chance, man.<eos> Anything you want to save?<eos> Sell it all.<eos> Who wants to buy some goodies?<eos> You do.
Train 457 departing to San Francisco.<eos> Will be boarding on platform four.<eos> It's now leaving at 1:55.<eos> Train 457 departing to San Francisco.<eos> Is now leaving at 1:55 p.m. on platform four.<eos> You always liked trains best, didn't you?<eos> Max.<eos> That looks like it hurts pretty bad.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
- No. And nothing captured on the security cameras.<eos> Where was he last seen?<eos> Leaving a taverna near Syntagma.<eos> Patron said he sat at the bar alone and then left after a couple hours.<eos> Why would Dushku kill his own guy?<eos> Well, with the FBI asking questions, maybe he's trying to tie up loose ends.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Dushku and Heta were best friends since childhood.<eos> Came to Greece together.<eos> Heta even did some time for Dushku.
And part of the decision making.<eos> We'll take this one step at a time.<eos> But you are gonna have to trust me.<eos> Now, when we are on the bowel, you will feel some discomfort.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I'll take over from there.<eos> Okay, we'll ride this out together.<eos> So, we have a plan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I'm not.<eos> Love note.<eos> What the...?<eos> "I can adapt and be whoever you want me to be."<eos> Isn't it supposed to be "whomever"?<eos> Adapt.<eos> Like a chameleon.<eos> That's weird.<eos> I had a baby.<eos> Not the most ideal timing, but you did.
I grew up here.<eos> This is House Capulet territory.<eos> You are in far more danger in this neighborhood than I am.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> May I have a word?<eos> That depends, Princess.<eos> Do you speak for your brother?<eos> No, but I have his ear.<eos> It's true.<eos> She does.
It's fine.<eos> Megan, are we just not gonna talk about what happened to you?<eos> When everything was going down with Colton, why didn't you tell Terence about my past?<eos> Because you asked me not to.<eos> Even though you knew it was the right thing to do?<eos> You made a commitment to IHM, didn't you?<eos> Of course I made a commitment, I work here.<eos> But your friendship means more to me than a job.<eos> I hope you can trust me on that.<eos> I do.
Another attempt?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I think we consolidate our gains in the short term.<eos> Beth, there are so many loose ends.<eos> And the loose ends are being attended to, Peter.<eos> Catalan is dead.<eos> Agent Wells is in custody.<eos> She'll be taken care of.<eos> We'll get through this.<eos> We always do.
Come with me.<eos> I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.<eos> Well, it worked, didn't it?<eos> It got me to bounce.<eos> Well, but at what cost?<eos> How will you remember your mother now?<eos> How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah. Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
Did you get out?<eos> This is payback.<eos> Stepulov's targeting Erin because I used his son as leverage.<eos> No, not just your daughter.<eos> There are hundreds of civilians in there, people from all over the country.<eos> It must have been his plan all along.<eos> And he gave us the time of the attack so he could call it off if his son lived, or not if he died...<eos> it's a perfect revenge.<eos> Okay, okay, look, we just have to evacuate the building.<eos> No, we don't.
I like the yellow, but I mean, do you know how many yellows there are?<eos> I got a job offer in Colorado.<eos> It's a promotion, with... with a raise, and, um, Conor put in for a transfer as well.<eos> I know we decided to do this baby thing together, so if you don't want me to take it, I'll...<eos> Well, I mean... you really wanna move to Colorado?<eos> Well, experience in other offices would give me a shot at an executive position someday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, you said you wanted me to take a desk job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I did.
He's the club's president, he calls all the shots... and you'll have to have a sit-down with him.<eos> Eventually. Can't act like you're trying to get a sit-down, 'cause it'll cause red flags.<eos> Right now you're just there to introduce "Remi" and check Kat's temperature for business.<eos> Yeah, and if Kat's into it, she'll bring it to Abel,<eos> - and we'll use him to draw Shepherd out.<eos> - How? A sting operation masquerading as a weapons sale.<eos> None of that is happening today.<eos> Today is about establishing a contact and trust.<eos> Okay, um, so I don't need a gun or anything?<eos> No, you do not.
I want you to move in with me.<eos> Permanently.<eos> My house is the safest place for both of us.<eos> My God.<eos> I'm trying to work, and I'm doing my best not to freak out right now, but you're making it really hard.<eos> Megan, can we get you back on set, please? Yes.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Right now.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> Hey. How you doing?
Listen.<eos> The people from the Institute like Kyle and Terence, I keep trying to tell you that they're dangerous, - and you're just not hearing me.<eos> - You humiliated me in front of millions of people.<eos> I thought that a scandal would make them leave you alone.<eos> - It was the trade-off, right?<eos> - My God.<eos> No, but it was a horrible idea.<eos> It was a terrible, bad, stupid thing to do.<eos> And I'm really sorry that I hurt you, but it all came from love.<eos> No, I-I... I do not do that version of love anymore.
I don't want to lose you either.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You know, I'm gonna be back in the office in 20 minutes.<eos> What was so important that it couldn't wait?<eos> I have a serious money situation that I need to deal with right away.<eos> - Okay, what do you mean?<eos> - Look, I-I... - I can't tell you the details.<eos> - Megan, if you don't...
Look, she's scared and emotional, and everything sucks, but she's going to be fine.<eos> I understand that this is very difficult on you.<eos> But you gotta believe me, this is for the greater good.<eos> You'll see when it's all over.<eos> I'll show you my gratitude, OK?<eos> Take five minutes.<eos> Oh, you read that one?<eos> Hey.<eos> I never said four weeks.<eos> - You did too.
- Well, that could be me tomorrow.<eos> - Stop talking about that area!<eos> It's a good excuse to keep Aunt Hermione away from the house.<eos> Isn't that a bit mean?<eos> She's coming all the way from England.<eos> - Yeah, to wag her finger at us.<eos> - It's not mean, there's nowhere for her to stay now that Donald's here.<eos> I did notice that. Five minutes after I move out and you've get a new son and I'm relegated to the guest couch.<eos> - I have the mumps now.<eos> - No, you don't.
Don't let your strange guest make you sad.<eos> - And the sun will return.<eos> - I know.<eos> Gerry, shovel!<eos> I've no doubt I have 20 good years left, but I tend to look back now rather than forward.<eos> Yes, me too, oddly, at the moment.<eos> Your husband? Every time I feel I'm moving on, he reappears like a ghost at the feast.<eos> I know you mistrust Mrs Haddock, but I'm no fool, and she seems to have a door into the lost world of the past.<eos> Do you have cabbage?<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
- I don't have a problem, Rebecca.<eos> - Yes, you do, Jack.<eos> I don't know what you and Ben talked about, but something happened while I was changing.<eos> Listen, I-I... I'm telling...<eos> I'm telling you, just leave it. I'm not leaving it, Jack.<eos> You're acting like a crazy person.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Okay, I found out. I found out that you were gonna go on tour with your ex-boyfriend.<eos> My ex-boyfriend?<eos> I don't...
Can I ask you a personal question?<eos> Uh, I don't know what the signals are like in your culture, but in mine, when we spend an evening helping someone take apart vibrators to smuggle into a foreign country, it's a pretty good indicator that it's okay to get personal.<eos> What's your sexual orientation?<eos> Out and proud hetero.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It wasn't a come-on.<eos> Oh, it would be okay if it was.<eos> I could do worse, and, you know, honestly,<eos> I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.
God, you are so incapable of being real.<eos> It's too bad, too, because I actually enjoyed being on the same side for once.<eos> Look, you and I are adversaries, nothing more.<eos> Anything beyond that would be completely inappropriate.<eos> Inappropriate?<eos> Like those personal pictures on that thumb drive?<eos> That folder was labeled "Do not open."<eos> If you didn't want me to open it, you wouldn't have labeled it that.<eos> Did we like what we saw?<eos> We did.
Do some deep thinking this weekend about that day until you can say for certain, Stephen.<eos> You can't say you're recovered unless you can say you're certain.<eos> Boy.<eos> You're clumsy, Stephen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stumbling through the forest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Walkin' in front of trucks.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Sure, you did.
The young asshole.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Claret, you mentioned John Lakeman missed a dinner on May 11th, to retrieve a bag.<eos> I never asked you... Did he return with the bag?<eos> Got your little suit back?<eos> You're 40 minutes late.<eos> They sent my bag to the wrong hotel.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, he did?
You're gonna need all these things by Friday?<eos> In a few weeks, we shoot the pilot.<eos> Be nice to get them in early while we have time to, you know, work out the kinks.<eos> Here. Here's a pen.<eos> Oh, okay. All right.<eos> So, the girls can do their own hair and makeup for now.<eos> Sure.<eos> Probably gonna have to make a budget for costumes.<eos> I'm sure you got ideas about that.<eos> - I do.
It's perfect.<eos> Give me the checks.<eos> - You should hug her.<eos> - No, we don't do that.<eos> I just work on my shit so fucking long and then, boom.<eos> Someone else gets there first.<eos> I mean, it's like why bother even trying to make anything that you really care about?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> You're probably the only one who still cares about my work.<eos> I do.
And, yes, I was gonna use them on him before, but I was wrong.<eos> And you think he'll make the right choices now?<eos> No.<eos> But I hope he still may.<eos> I know you don't believe that's what I want, Belle, but it's true.<eos> When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
Trying to map the network.<eos> Now... think about what happened next.<eos> And this sense you have, of seeing another world out of the corner of your eye, when did that start?<eos> Maybe... 10 or 11. One last job, and we're out.<eos> It's kind of hard to, um... you know.<eos> It's like trying to make a list...<eos> - people yelling in your ear.<eos> - Big score potential.<eos> The... the pills I prescribed should help with that.<eos> They... do.
How would you describe your emotional state that evening, Mr Huntley?<eos> Were you in a frame of mind to control your wife's behaviour,<eos> Mr Huntley, to coerce her? No, no, no...<eos> She was the one that went to the flat.<eos> She went inside!<eos> There are no witnesses to your wife entering Timothy Ifield's flat.<eos> No CCTV. No traffic cameras.<eos> No mobile phone GPS data.<eos> Well, she'd left her mobile phone at home.<eos> So did you, pal.
Do you consider what I endure?<eos> You disrespect me, shame me before the court and everybody gossips.<eos> You did the same to Lady Anne with your uncle, King Richard.<eos> I was in love with Richard!<eos> Are you saying that you love her?<eos> Do you love him?<eos> What?<eos> The boy.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Of course I don't.
Henry.<eos> Henry sees no one.<eos> Sits in darkness.<eos> His mind turns against itself.<eos> His lords plan for war without him.<eos> And Lizzie, what does she do?<eos> Doesn't she have you followed?<eos> Of course, but her ladies believe in Richard too, so they look the other way.<eos> From King James.<eos> How does your son?
He tricked us into giving up control.<eos> Tricked you.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I-I got that part, man. But if you're not the monster, then...<eos> I'm you.<eos> Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown... a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.<eos> You did.
My patient, the night he came in, there was an H1N1 panic in the garment district.<eos> 200plus people in the ER.<eos> Everyone with a cough thought they were gonna die of the flu.<eos> When you're busy like that, it feels like time is running from you.<eos> And you just need it to stop.<eos> You just need everything to stop.<eos> You need people to stop bleeding, stop choking, for their lungs to stop filling with fluid, to stop crying, to stop screaming...<eos> Dr. Railly?<eos> Your patient's parents are here.<eos> It doesn't.
- Keep going.<eos> I know there's more.<eos> - Yeah, there's the whole ending here.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Let's see here.<eos> "There once was a serpent... "who only traveled one direction. "Always forward, never backward.<eos> "Until one day, the serpent came upon a demon."<eos> - What's it mean?<eos> - I don't know. I didn't write it.<eos> - Who did?
- You're home!<eos> We'd seriously thought we lost you this time.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> I'll tell you guys everything, just let me jump in the shower and then we can celebrate.<eos> Actually, this can't wait. Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back. It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.<eos> Do you have it with you?<eos> I... I did. Um...
You're clear.<eos> That's good.<eos> We need to move.<eos> Here it is.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Move your feet.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> That's a nice one.<eos> Next time, I'll teach you how to snap off a real curveball.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Robert, I'm trying to help them.<eos> You're helping Monroe hurt them.<eos> He's crossed the line, Phyllis.<eos> Just stop it, Robert.<eos> He has become completely unhinged.<eos> He's drinking all the time.<eos> He's pushing the limits of what he's doing with these people.<eos> They signed up for it.<eos> They knew what they were getting into. No!<eos> They didn't.
When Monroe's men respond, that's when you go.<eos> What kind of distraction?<eos> You'll know.<eos> Wait for it.<eos> I need to show you something on his Xray.<eos> It could be nothing, but...<eos> What the hell?<eos> It's a foreign object buried in his shoulder.<eos> Where'd this man say he was from again?<eos> He didn't.
You are starting your day with some destruction of property, I see.<eos> You hanged a man, and now you're throwing a party.<eos> Well, that's a... that's quite a serious accusation.<eos> The way I heard it, Ramon Sanchez ran afoul of his sedicioso compadres.<eos> It is common knowledge that Mexicans are a violent race, descended from conquistadors.<eos> Tell me... How many Indians did your ancestors butcher in order to acquire that fine ranch of yours?<eos> That's tellin' her, Niles.<eos> Let the lady answer.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably as many as yours did.
- I brought you a, uh, water.<eos> - Thanks, I'd love some.<eos> - I'll let you two, uh...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - You like doing construction, huh? - Yeah.<eos> - No, it's great.<eos> You know, I get to...<eos> I get to work with my hands. It's simple work. - Mm.<eos> - I... uh, watch something go up.<eos> - Yeah, Johnny did construction, didn't he?
Look, after Johnny died... - No, can we please not do this?<eos> - I don't want to do this. - Listen to me.<eos> Eddie, listen to me, please.<eos> When Johnny died, I had nothing.<eos> I had no answers as to why it happened.<eos> I had no one, I just... I had nowhere to go.<eos> And you?<eos> You found somewhere to go. I mean, you... you found a place that has the answers that you need, you know?<eos> It probably saved your life.<eos> - Yeah. - It did.
So he doesn't have to live as a beast.<eos> She knows that being a beast sucks and he'd probably be happier living in the world he was born into, in the human world.<eos> That's sad.<eos> Well, yeah, the assignment was to write a tragedy.<eos> It's kind of like the story of us.<eos> Except you're not a beast.<eos> You kinda saw me as one.<eos> And you didn't break up with me to save me from the wild world of beastdom.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why did you?
You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know you.<eos> You... you made me breakfast in bed, and... and... You didn't need to do that.<eos> You wanted to.<eos> I think that you care about me.<eos> That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
Dr. Webber asked me to come back.<eos> There was no folding.<eos> If you say so.<eos> If you're into the guy, why not just be with him?<eos> - Because I don't want to be with him.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No. I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.
The darker.<eos> Oh, did you call about my eyelashes?<eos> You know I wanna die with my eyelashes on.<eos> Eyelashes are tomorrow.<eos> Good.<eos> You were always so good.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Incredible grades, a clean room, ooh, you never talked back, and you never messed around with the boys.<eos> Most parents would appreciate that.<eos> Oh, I did... then.
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.<eos> Son?<eos> Can I speak with you?<eos> Why?<eos> Just come with me.<eos> Please.<eos> Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.<eos> You want me to follow you back down there so I could be the next to be killed?<eos> You heard about Enoch.<eos> Of course I did.
...range from $2 to $5 million. Fuck!<eos> This makes the operation seem profitable and legitimate even though no actual profit is being made.<eos> Meanwhile...<eos> You've been working out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With someone not me.<eos> You were busy. ...with $8.3 billion in assets, it'll be the fourth largest Ponzi scheme in America...<eos> I know her.<eos> Who, her? I hope you didn't have any money wrapped up with them.<eos> My aunt did.
Oh, right.<eos> Oh, and, uh, Mr. Boseman is here to see you.<eos> He... what?<eos> Did we have a negotiation?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> No, no, we didn't.
Although I have to admit, people that cry in CVS scare me.<eos> Uh, Kibby, you're next.<eos> Okay, Willie Mae asks, um...<eos> "Help, I think I'm developing feelings for this guy but he's literally the opposite of my type."<eos> - Is it worth exploring?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Never turn down an opportunity for love just because it comes in a different package. I have a question.<eos> I...<eos> I mean, it's, uh...<eos> Tracy P... Tracy P. does.
And there's that tradition: something old, new, borrowed, blue.<eos> Thought, when you married the doc, that if you wanted, you could wear it.<eos> It's okay if you don't want to.<eos> I love it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just a little something for lettin' me shack up with ya.<eos> Speaking of shacking up, isn't that the cutie that's hot for your booty?<eos> Oh, man, I'm starting to sound like Toby.<eos> How do I look?<eos> How you doing?
- Oh, sweetie.<eos> - I didn't have such a good time downstairs and it was just...<eos> Ours went fine, and it's gonna be fine, I promise.<eos> If you can keep your temper in check.<eos> - I'll keep my temper in check.<eos> - You will?<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> - Okay. - Thank you.<eos> - Can I get a kiss?<eos> - Please do.
So this is different because the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Um... don't you mean by that, Dr. Mara...<eos> I think the doctor can speak for himself, Counselor.<eos> How do you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> Doctor?<eos> I... I may have misspoke.<eos> But you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> Doctor, answer the question.<eos> I do.
It's no bother.<eos> I could have you disbarred for doing something like that.<eos> You come to my home... I was invited into your home.<eos> Go through my desk, shake down my wife for information.<eos> I would never shake down Diedre. She's too lovely.<eos> Yeah, well, let's see what a disbarment committee says. Get home safe.<eos> Yeah, let's see what they say.<eos> What was your quote? Um...<eos> "When you go after me professionally," "I go after you personally." - I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Excuse me, won't you?<eos> Oh!<eos> I need to talk with you about the things you approved this morning. OK.<eos> Why are we whispering?<eos> Because you're gonna have to un-approve them.<eos> I will not!<eos> As mayor, my word is my bond.<eos> If I say that we're getting trees and swing sets, we're getting trees and swing sets!<eos> Except we have no money to get anything!<eos> - Of course we do. - No, we don't!
Wait, we're talking about your son?<eos> Do you know that I went to Hell for him?<eos> I even helped save his scrawny, little human, who I much prefer dead.<eos> This is getting weird.<eos> I mean, a mother has needs, don't you agree?<eos> Okay, uh... I got to go.<eos> You're a terrible kisser.<eos> Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer.<eos> He hates it when people manipulate him.<eos> I didn't.
Okay, well, that's a little weird.<eos> And creepy.<eos> And if the mom knows where we live, maybe the killer does, too.<eos> Tell me about Agnes.<eos> She is blissfully unaware that her parents are talking about a serial killer.<eos> Liz, what can I do?<eos> How can I help?<eos> You are helping.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I do.
Iniko may not be taking your calls, but he will certainly take mine.<eos> I told you, the deal on the mine is closed.<eos> There's always another deal.<eos> I have one in mind that I know he will find especially hard to resist.<eos> Relax. Have a drink.<eos> Help me finish this infuriating puzzle.<eos> And when iniko does come, you'll be waiting with a magic bullet.<eos> Aram, talk to me.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see which way they went?<eos> I didn't, no.
It's working though, man. I can...<eos> It's working, man.<eos> It feels like a lifetime ago that I was hung over.<eos> Yeah, you're welcome.<eos> So do you really love them?<eos> Both of them?<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Apparently we weren't thinking the same thing.<eos> I was thinking about killing a tub of caramel ice cream.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sorry. Never mind. [Chuckles]<eos> I don't even know why...<eos> 'Cause you want a family.<eos> 'Cause I want a family?<eos> Don't we want a family?<eos> No, of course we do.
The uzhe.<eos> Oh, my God, I did not just fucking do that.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Nina's in trouble.<eos> The jail trouble?<eos> No, it's worse.<eos> She sniffed a man's shirt.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Okay, good. 'Cause I don't.
I can't tell if you're here to get me or to kill me.<eos> I'm still deciding.<eos> Crystal...<eos> Crystal Cove sounds amazing<eos> Yeah, it's got the cabin with the fireplace.<eos> And if you ever invite me there, I'm gonna murder you so hard.<eos> I don't want to be romanced, okay?<eos> I w...<eos> I want to be loved.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Anyway, so, I wasn't sure if Maggie was okay, but I think she's fine, and if she's fine, then it's okay for me to go to dinner.<eos> If Maggie's fine, you get to eat? - Dinner with Riggs.<eos> - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner. Mm.<eos> With Riggs.<eos> When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
They're your friends, Owen, from... before.<eos> They're your friends.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you saved a family today.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, things are looking up for me, too.<eos> - I got a date tonight. - Oh!<eos> Is it someone in the hospital?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Your face did.
By the time she came to me, these were her charts.<eos> All of this?<eos> She was pretending that she didn't know she was sick, Maggie.<eos> She lied to both of us.<eos> She didn't want it to be true.<eos> She thought her doctors were wrong.<eos> Yeah, I think you're right.<eos> Oh, there's more.<eos> Uh. How could there possibly be more?<eos> When did she do all of this?
I know. Just hang on there.<eos> Okay, I need you to, uh, get me the O2 and get on the speaker and ask if anybody has some erectile-dysfunction pills.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> What? - I'll open up his vessels.<eos> It could save his life. Go! Go!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Excuse me. Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
He has to be fearless.<eos> He has to leap.<eos> He has...<eos> What do you need right now?<eos> I'm so cold.<eos> I'll get a warming blanket.<eos> No!<eos> Can you...<eos> Will you just hold me?<eos> We did good?
We've all got our eyes out for her.<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> Bovie.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get her on a morphine drip.<eos> All right, you're gonna be all right.<eos> - We have been looking for you!<eos> - You scared the crap out of me!<eos> - Oh, I need some O2.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
Priests get scared, too.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time.<eos> She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.<eos> You mean from my Dad.<eos> Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
Fuck it.<eos> Why not?<eos> If he can do it, why can't we do it?<eos> - So, we started doing it. - Yeah.<eos> Our buddy Mookie asked us if we wanted to go to the titty bar.<eos> - Titty Tuesdays. - Titty Tuesdays.<eos> And we were, like, "Look, man, we would love to indulge you", but we got about negative-three reasons why... we can't do it."<eos> - Callback! - I know, I know.<eos> Gotta do it for...<eos> I do it for the callbacks.
I'm the evil queen.<eos> You, of all people, should recognize a doppelganger when you see one.<eos> There's two of us now.<eos> I don't care if there's seven of you now. I'm leaving as soon as possible.<eos> Well, that's a shame...<eos> Because there's nothing for you out there.<eos> Nothing you can say will keep me in this abysmal Hamlet a moment longer than I need to be.<eos> "Abysmal Hamlet"?<eos> Sounds like you haven't had the right tour guide.<eos> But now you do.
- Son of Zorn!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Dude'slegsrule!<eos> Yeah. That's so cool...<eos> Layla. Whoa.<eos> Hey, aren't you happy for me?<eos> What's the deal?<eos> Alan, I thought we were going to your mom's house to hang out.<eos> - Do you not want to hang out?<eos> - I do. Okay? I really do.
The library.<eos> Lab.<eos> There's a secret entrance behind that grating that leads down to the tunnel system.<eos> What secret base is complete without one?<eos> Your desk?<eos> My sister used to post up here.<eos> From the way Crane talks about her, she...<eos> She was something special.<eos> They had something special.<eos> We all did.
All this time... it's all been a lie.<eos> Molly...<eos> All of it.<eos> I am happy to see you well.<eos> Not sure how well I am right now.<eos> What did he tell you?<eos> He told me that you believed I was special, while my mother wanted to protect me...<eos> Yes, you-you are special.<eos> And your mother did want to protect you, she wanted it very much.<eos> We all did.
(panting)<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I think so.<eos> Crane... did you reach him?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's free.<eos> Okay.<eos> And he told me to tell you something.<eos> He told me that you should let Molly have that new cell phone that she's been asking for.<eos> - He did, did he? - Oh, yeah.
I need hydration.<eos> I'm not a lizard.<eos> No, honey, just relax and enjoy the clam dip.<eos> Clam dip?<eos> Clam dip is a tailgating tradition.<eos> Now I emailed you the recipe but maybe it went to spam because of the word clam.<eos> Yep.<eos> - It's all right, sweetheart.<eos> - You like hummus?<eos> - No, dear, I don't.
You speak as someone who's seen the future.<eos> Haven't all students of history?<eos> Those who suffer heal.<eos> Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.<eos> And our towers grow a little taller every time.<eos> I should like to believe you.<eos> Tell me, why do you seek the grave of Gawain?<eos> Eh... it's a long story.<eos> I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.
No, that's not-- Forget it.<eos> I know it's hard, but you're so lucky, Xan.<eos> I would die to come here!<eos> Stop trying to cheer me up by saying you'll die.<eos> Right now, it probably feels like the world is ending, but I know if you don't give up and you think positive, things will work out.<eos> -I want to fight you.<eos> -No, you don't.<eos> I would destroy you.<eos> So instead let's think about why you wanted to come here in the first place.<eos> I didn't.
Garcia and I compiled the list just in case.<eos> Done. It's sent.<eos> All right.<eos> Now we wait.<eos> We're working on all channels here. Matt Cruz is on with the consulate right now.<eos> We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.<eos> I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.<eos> It was for the right reason.<eos> I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.<eos> We do, too.
Inhale...<eos> Calm... exhale your fear.<eos> Did you actually say you'd be happy if Rafael broke up with me? Did he say that?<eos> You haven't answered my question.<eos> Now let's move into Kasyapasana.<eos> Beginners just try a side plank.<eos> I am not one to hold on to things.<eos> How are you doing that?<eos> So if you said it, I'd rather you just tell me.<eos> Fine. I did.
He took my savings.<eos> I'm a fool.<eos> We're hypocrites!<eos> We stand up there and we preach in certainties.<eos> "If you behave like this, you'll be rewarded, if you don't, you'll be punished."<eos> We are preaching to ourselves, too.<eos> We can all learn from God's words.<eos> - No one expects you to be perfect.<eos> - Yes, they do!<eos> The Church does. You do!
So, is it Dr. Bull?<eos> Or Jason? Or...<eos> Just Bull.<eos> Well, hey, thanks for coming. Let's...<eos> Where to start?<eos> First, have a seat.<eos> Interesting office.<eos> My parents surrendered this room to me when I was 12, so...<eos> Your parents live here?<eos> They did, yeah.
- Yep.<eos> Okay, but you can still...<eos> Nope.<eos> - But what if you just...<eos> - Uh-uh. So right now you must feel totally...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's Rich Eisen.<eos> You know Rich, right?<eos> Did I tell you I asked him to be the co-host of my TV show?<eos> No, you didn't, Michael.
I was abroad, studying in Spain.<eos> I dropped out the week after Travis raped me.<eos> Transferred out of state the next semester.<eos> I just needed to get as far away as I could.<eos> But I did follow Sophie's trial, and I was devastated when she was convicted.<eos> But he deserves it.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> He deserves to rot in hell.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
_<eos> _<eos> You get him to the rendezvous point.<eos> - I'll meet you there. - Yeah, all right.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes...<eos> Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
Hon, hon, it's okay. We have nothing to hide.<eos> What kind of tests?<eos> Blood test, uh, X-Ray, DNA, MRI and whatever else the doctor recommends to rule out any plastic surgery.<eos> You got it, friend.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, it-it's just that, um... her ex killed my dad.<eos> I know.<eos> But that's only if you believe that death is finite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, so...
Doctor..<eos> Dark!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.
Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow. All crows talk.<eos> They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
If you stay in line, they do.<eos> - Do you stay in line?<eos> - Always have, always will.<eos> And where does killing women fit into that?<eos> - Lunch is in three hours and...<eos> - It's in three hours and one minute.<eos> I want to tell you a story.<eos> I was a witness to a murder, and my testimony put the wrong man in prison.<eos> But you didn't mean to do the wrong thing.<eos> No, I didn't.
Where are we with the cease-fire?<eos> Rabbi Lowenthal's assassination pretty much shut everything down, but we've got until tomorrow.<eos> All right, I'm gonna take it from here.<eos> Why don't you try and get some sleep, okay?<eos> - Good morning, ma'am.<eos> - Morning. I'm sorry to have to bring you a bit of bad news.<eos> Well, that never stops anybody, does it?<eos> Well, due to security concerns,<eos> Jordan has decided to cancel the Iranian/Israeli youth soccer game that was organized by Rabbi Lowenthal.<eos> They didn't do that already?
When you found out?<eos> What do you believe happens to us when we die?<eos> You're avoiding my question.<eos> You're avoiding mine.<eos> I believe in the universe - nature.<eos> It's the only God I know.<eos> Cora, what are you burning?<eos> Please, will you read?<eos> You don't even believe in God.<eos> Ronnie did.
I'd love you both to meet. I ju... I...<eos> I think you'd really like her.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure I will.<eos> Tessa, did you forget something?<eos> Felicity.<eos> Who's Tessa?<eos> Should I be jealous?<eos> I thought you were in India.<eos> Does Rhys know you're here?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Get down!<eos> Dwayne!<eos> I think it's over!<eos> We gotta barricade the door!<eos> Cannonball accidents almost never happen in New York.<eos> ...Not only is Jeremiah Davis a potential suspect in the murder of Margaret Henderson, but he's trying to kill me, too.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo!<eos> Those are some serious allegations, Counselor.<eos> You better have evidence to back them up.<eos> I do, Your Honor.
So I guess I got to trust you.<eos> I wish I could say the same.<eos> I know what my family must think of me.<eos> I'm sure Homeland Security's questioned them.<eos> They probably think I'm a monster.<eos> Anthony... either you trust me or you don't.<eos> I get that you and Flynn are trying to wipe out Rittenhouse... We're no better than Rittenhouse.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm just a cog in Flynn's machine, I get it.<eos> I do.
- Let me take care of it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We have a family membership if you...<eos> No, no, no, we don't want any memberships.<eos> Chip, stay where I can see you.<eos> You know, I worked on the campaign when he was governor.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Is there a discount for that?<eos> - No, I'm sorry, we don't have that.<eos> - You don't?
I, Troy Dixon, choose to take my life.<eos> Peace.<eos> Pentobarbital with champagne.<eos> Such a mind trip.<eos> Troy, if you're not ready, we don't have to do this today.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I know what the technology is, Richard.<eos> I have a patent on it. What the fuck is a matter with you?<eos> So you're not gonna sign it?<eos> No, I'm not gonna sign this!<eos> Jesus! You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It-It, um...<eos> It actually does work now.
Give it to me.<eos> You are not thinking clearly.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Looks like we both lose.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> 'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide.<eos> I don't even need to know what it is.<eos> My phone may be in the toilet, but... but I win.<eos> No, you don't.
And if it's okay with Dan, it's fine with me.<eos> So... Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I will come back and get my stuff when you're gone.<eos> No, I'm just gonna... the door. To...<eos> I was born to roam, anyways.<eos> Richard.<eos> Liz just told me.<eos> She did?
- What about your squatter?<eos> - Oh, he's been out for months.<eos> He left to go sell cocaine at the Keystone Pipeline protests.<eos> I've just been staying in the garage out of solidarity.<eos> You can't leave.<eos> - Don't beg, Richard.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.<eos> You... you read the handbook?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Well, look at Julia. I put a tiny black spot on her soul, and she scrubbed at it so much she put a hole in it.<eos> She can never go back to who she is.<eos> Now... neither can you.<eos> This is an investment in our future, son.<eos> Someday, when you've embraced what you really are, you'll come find me.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hi, we're looking for a clock.<eos> It belonged to my grandfather.<eos> The auction website, it listed this address.<eos> Auction websites don't do that. Ugh, fine.
I vetted a dozen candidates:<eos> Decker's former colleagues, high school chums, even some online associates.<eos> None of them seem remotely capable of keeping Preeda Boonark in human bondage.<eos> Well, they're in here somewhere and we are gonna find them.<eos> I thought Shinwell was coming over for a lesson.<eos> He was, but he's been very busy lately.<eos> He's working on a drug deal.<eos> It's taking up all of his time.<eos> He's eager to impress the, heads of SBK, and that doesn't concern you.<eos> Of course it does.
Perfect.<eos> Okay, so I have one last surprise.<eos> Hello, my beautiful friends.<eos> I am Ken Yurubi.<eos> The Mentalist.<eos> Like the TV show?<eos> Well, actually, The Mentalist was based on me.<eos> Man, you must be loaded!<eos> I, no...<eos> No, they didn't...
But enough for her to change her name.<eos> Ben, you don't know who this woman is.<eos> She's been involved in the death of God knows how many people.<eos> She... she preys on people.<eos> She's been doing this since she was 16.<eos> Okay, she's lying to you.<eos> She is manipulating you.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> I have to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I don't want to stop.<eos> I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> Well, I mean, yeah.<eos> Maybe there's something wrong with all of us.<eos> Am I crazy like Mom?<eos> No.<eos> You are nothing like her.<eos> What the hell, Nicole?<eos> I was just seeing if you still had the will to live.<eos> You do.
Did you have anything to do with that guy's disappearance?<eos> Yes.<eos> Annie, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to get you involved, but I've got it all under control, I promise.<eos> You promised when we started this that everything was going to be fine.<eos> It is so not fine.<eos> You are being followed by the police, and now you're helping somebody escape police custody.<eos> I don't even know what this has become. - You don't understand.<eos> - I didn't have a choice.<eos> Well, I do.
So, as the man in charge of the response to the Thorpe attack, you could make sure the city chose to buy your filters, making you very rich.<eos> Is this about me failing to reveal a conflict of interests, or are you accusing me of orchestrating the attack?<eos> You tell us.<eos> If it's the first one... guilty as charged.<eos> And I'll pay whatever penalty I'm due.<eos> But the other one, that's, that's a fairy tale.<eos> Are you saying that I hired Raymond Thorpe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> Actually, you do.
Wow.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Coach and May's foreign exchange student just added me as a friend.<eos> Montsie.<eos> His name is Montsie.<eos> I didn't know they had a foreign exchange student.<eos> I didn't know they moved to North Carolina.<eos> Neither did I.
Plus, the testicle story is a home run.<eos> It all started with my mom's death.<eos> I was 12 years old, and I became depressed and went to a dark place.<eos> Then one day, I imagined that I was someone completely different, and suddenly, everything seemed... better.<eos> When I turned 18, I decided to legally become someone else, and that dark place became a distant memory until Adelaide died.<eos> And then Margaret.<eos> I thought of changing my identity again, but what I did instead was to create a world in my head I can step into when things are difficult.<eos> Some people think that's me being aloof, but it's the only way I can make it through the day. - I...<eos> I hope this makes sense.<eos> - It does!
- Oh, that's nice.<eos> Uh, we know that you're seeing both of us.<eos> - So...<eos> - Okay.<eos> Wait, did you not know that?<eos> Uh, no, we did not.<eos> I mean, when you kissed us both on the mouth we sort of pieced it together.<eos> Listen, I don't want to cause any drama.<eos> - We don't want any drama! - Who wants drama?<eos> Nobody... does.
I'm so sorry, love.<eos> You said you were in Peru.<eos> I took no joy in deceiving youl wanted to be sure before I told you.<eos> Before I risked<eos> I know how comfortable you are with our life, with what we have.<eos> All I know is that when Richard called, I knew what he was saying was true.<eos> Please...<eos> None of us knows what's true.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
What did he say about Shades?<eos> Something like he knew someone who was obsessed with them?<eos> I do know-- or I suppose I knew someone who was interested in Shades-- was.<eos> Ah, it's rather confusing.<eos> Confusing why?<eos> Because you know her too.<eos> It's Alice.<eos> Honestly, I don't think that she knew anything about Shades.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> That Alice didn't.
We all know that Tina can't keep her mouth shut.<eos> I don't even know who Tina is.<eos> Yeah, but Abby and Tina ain't friends.<eos> Yeah, but Tina will tell Bill, the pharmacist, who, by the way, likes to wear women's underwear.<eos> What?<eos> Found that out from Tina.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> I didn't.
Okay, fine.<eos> "Fuck, Colt loves Abby."<eos> Yeah, I didn't have enough paint to cover up the "Fuck," so I just added to it.<eos> This whole situation sucks.<eos> And it also sucks that we live in a town where everyone's gotta know our business.<eos> Now at least they'll know this, too.<eos> It's so sweet, Colt.<eos> And you even put the comma in the right spot.<eos> Honestly, that was just a lucky guess.<eos> I didn't... I just...
It's good for a kid to learn disappointment.<eos> It makes 'em stronger.<eos> It's called grit, Heather.<eos> Okay, Ella, Ella!<eos> Okay, Ella, your question is what would you do to make the world a better place?<eos> I would make copies of my mom and dad in a 3D printer and give them to every kid because my mom and dad love me no matter what and everyone should have that.<eos> That's a good answer, Ella.<eos> We got this.<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> No one did.
Fine.<eos> What are we gonna tell the other co-hosts?<eos> Nina is stuck in traffic.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Who's gonna make us feel intellectually inferior?<eos> - I got you, boo.<eos> - So let's have a great show.<eos> Janet, before we go out there, there's just there's something that I need to say.<eos> No need. I got your number.<eos> No, you don't.
I try to remember to use my words, but sometimes I just forget.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you, Mommy.<eos> I love you, too, Mateo.<eos> - You're the best mommy in the world.<eos> If only everyone could see this side of him.<eos> Ah, Jane is researching.<eos> Some things never change.<eos> Okay. Time's up.<eos> But some things do.
All right.<eos> Fuck.<eos> So what's gonna happen now with the show?<eos> Probably cancelled.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What?<eos> I don't care about the show.<eos> I'm happy when you're here.<eos> Have you thought about everything?<eos> Yeah, I did.
My money's on the underground markets of Chengguan.<eos> There you can buy anything or anyone.<eos> All aboard?<eos> You are not leaving this dimension.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> All right, to be continued.<eos> For right now, what about Shangri-La?<eos> Lam's about to take it over and we're not gonna let that happen.<eos> Lam can take it over, but only if he has the staff.<eos> He does.
I've been looking for the ones we've missed, and I found one.<eos> I got the visuals here if you want to take a look.<eos> That's a holographic projector.<eos> Yeah, it's a little toy I've been working on.<eos> Hope to have it in stores by, um, Christmas 2020.<eos> If the world still exists.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> Okay, yeah, well, uh, this is the solar system today.<eos> And, uh, excuse me. If you don't mind...<eos> - I do.
So what is the plan, if you don't mind me asking?<eos> This.<eos> A gravity tractor.<eos> Oh, that would deflect the asteroid using gravitational pull.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We position a probe next to the asteroid.<eos> Even though its mass is small, the probe generates its own gravitational field.<eos> Diverting the asteroid's path just enough to miss Earth.<eos> But you need a rocket powerful enough to get it there in time, and that rocket doesn't exist yet.<eos> Well, actually, it does.
Why did you come here this evening?<eos> I have certain matters to discuss.<eos> Why not follow the usual protocol?<eos> Diplomats, ambassadors, emissaries, offers, counteroffers, secret messages.<eos> I know how diplomacy works.<eos> As do I. I invented it.<eos> If you mean you invented the art of deception and subterfuge, then I can hardly argue.<eos> Give me a good reason why I should not have you killed.<eos> Because you do not wish me dead.<eos> I don't? No.
Freeze!<eos> Shit.<eos> - Keep 'em up! - Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Are you lost?<eos> Uh le nail salon.<eos> You'll be right there. It's right there.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> How you doing, Chip?
Is there one?<eos> Nope.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Don't.<eos> What?<eos> I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know? Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
I know what I saw. And I told you, plain and simple.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> - Typical. The boy who cried wolf...<eos> - What?<eos> - You cried wolf.<eos> - I haven't!<eos> I saw the wolf. The wolf is real.<eos> If there is a pandemic, it should have been mentioned online by now.<eos> - Not everything turns up on Facebook.<eos> - Yes, actually, it does.
Okay, so, you know how there's a subterranean race of lizard-people living beneath the city who control our minds with their pheromones? Okay, he's a wackadoodle.<eos> Gina, get your wackadoodle out of here.<eos> It's been two hours, and nothing on the last guy. He's gonna get away.<eos> Where are you, number nine?<eos> Think.<eos> If I was an escaped murderer, where would I hide?<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, I have no idea.<eos> I just thought if I gasped I could force an epiphany.<eos> And I did.
That's enough, Miss Bennett.<eos> This is my cafe, and I'd like you to leave.<eos> I'll go.<eos> But one day... you are going to pay for what you did to her.<eos> Carson, I'm so sorry.<eos> Not as sorry as I am.<eos> No one here believes that you're responsible for what happened to your wife.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, you don't.
I should answer that.<eos> Maigret.<eos> Chief, Roland and I have spent the evening going through old Danish newspaper clippings with a Danish dictionary and we found reports of a light-aircraft accident that happened three and a half years ago.<eos> It appears in the...<eos> Dagbladet, with the headline 'Man brae...<eos> braendt i flys... tyrt'.<eos> - LaPointe.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Erm... - Did you find out Anderson's real name?<eos> - I did, yes.
And we'll be searching your sister's room, so we'll need the key.<eos> Of course.<eos> Follow him.<eos> Are you not worried that my brother will use his trip to Paris to run?<eos> No.<eos> What makes you so confident?<eos> Because I believed him when he said he didn't know Isaac Goldberg.<eos> Was that his name?<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I knew him?<eos> Did you?
Wake up!"<eos> Mom, why are you yelling?<eos> Am I?<eos> Ow! My trap!<eos> Oh, don't worry, I got the humane kind.<eos> Although now that I think about it, I may not have.<eos> Oh, good, everyone's here to see this.<eos> Matt, take that off.<eos> That was supposed to catch the critter living in my garage.<eos> It did.
My pleasure.<eos> Looked like you had your hands full.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> I'd better get back to work.<eos> Okay.<eos> Take care, Pastor.<eos> I don't understand, what happened with the investigation against Mr. Gowen?<eos> It was dropped.<eos> But Jack said the Inspector General had solid evidence against him.<eos> They did.
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't let you take me back to Hope Valley.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what's your plan?<eos> You're just gonna take the evidence and ride off into the sunset, and hope that Wyatt doesn't come looking for you?<eos> Yeah. Sounds good to me.<eos> Too bad, 'cause it's not gonna work.<eos> Oh, it's gonna work all right.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> 'Cause you don't have what it takes.<eos> Yes, I do.
You deserve someone that can make you happy and it is the greatest displeasure of my life that I cannot be that man.<eos> - Thank you, Terrence.<eos> - I'm not saying you're lying, Mr. Jeffers, but if that's how things went down, why is Veronica so angry, you stupid liar?<eos> - I don't know! - You don't know.<eos> Well, we could stay here all night until your story starts making sense.<eos> - I want to figure this out, too, but I have to go home eventually.<eos> - You think anyone cares about your damned plans?<eos> I know I don't.<eos> Do you care, Amy?<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah.<eos> - So now, it's gonna be all Enya... - All Enya. ... all the time.<eos> - All the damn time, all day. - Mm! - Amenya!<eos> - Enya.<eos> How could I have been so wrong?<eos> Have I... always had bad taste?<eos> Just like I said.<eos> - Yeah, I said it, too. - Ha.<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> - I did!
I'm a weirdo.<eos> That's what everyone says.<eos> Sometimes, I don't know what people mean when they say things, and that can make me feel alone even when there are other people in the room.<eos> And all I can do is sit and twiddle, which is what I call my selfstimulatory behavior, when I flick a pencil against a rubber band at a certain frequency and think about all the things that I could never do,<eos> I don't know. I'd like to go to Antarctica.<eos> It's quiet there... except in the rookeries, where the penguins breed.<eos> Those aren't quiet. No, sir.<eos> I'm finished with my answer.<eos> Great.<eos> Almost done for today.
Do you always take in little girls to you house?<eos> Mom, she's been good to me, okay?<eos> We're staying at The W until tonight.<eos> Don't let that plane leave without you.<eos> Oh, it will.<eos> And I'll be just fine.<eos> All right, what?<eos> I mean, you want to talk about your music?<eos> - What?<eos> - We did.
Three.<eos> Or was it the best beauty salon period?<eos> - Four.<eos> - Mm-hmm, look, do you remember how many stars we got?<eos> Let's count them up.<eos> - Five.<eos> - Five.<eos> Five. Enough.<eos> Save it for the stage.<eos> We already did that.
Yeah.<eos> So where is, uh, where's Star?<eos> Bringing up the rear.<eos> You clean up good, Unc.<eos> Why don't, uh... why don't you guys try to find a place, and do what you got to do to get ready.<eos> You're gonna go on after the speeches. Oh. Want to come?<eos> Si.<eos> Hey, Hunter, you mind if I talk to you a minute?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> How you doing?
I never saw it.<eos> Or how you and Dad made a deal to launch my solo career, but Dad squashed it 'cause he didn't want me on his label.<eos> This is exactly what I was talking about, the influence of those street girls they have on you...<eos> Please, Mom.<eos> I learned these street smarts on my own.<eos> Besides, ten grand is like a Chanel bag for you.<eos> Don't worry, I'll pay you back.<eos> You really love that boy, Alexandra?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.
I mean, I hate it here.<eos> I can't stand these hoes.<eos> Hey, I need a place to stay.<eos> Do you know anybody maybe with an extra room?<eos> You know what?<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> Damn, baby.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Looking fine as ever.<eos> - How you doing?
What you want?<eos> There's something I been working on for a long while now, but I need a producer like you to help me break it down to a four-part harmony, and you got the touch, right, when it comes to girl groups, so...<eos> Man, you still runnin' the same old game.<eos> - What?<eos> - You have not changed.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> All that mess you pulled with Mary.<eos> And I can't even count how many times you screwed over Carlotta.<eos> Well, I didn't exactly have my head screwed on straight at the time, - you know what I'm saying?<eos> - Oh, and you do now?
♪ Let me hear you say it loud ♪<eos> ♪ I been showing more affection ♪<eos> ♪ Damn, it's crazy how ♪ ♪ You make me ♪<eos> - ♪ La, la, la ♪ - ♪ You make me feel. ♪<eos> - I like the way it's coming together. - Thank you.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Y'all go ahead and take a minute.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I think you got something.<eos> - You really do?
It's the best I can do.<eos> You could come with me.<eos> You could protect me from all the creepy drunk dudes.<eos> Why are you making a joke of this?<eos> I'm not.<eos> What is it that you're trying to do?<eos> I just told you that I loved you.<eos> What do you want me to say, Hunter?<eos> That I love you, too?<eos> I do.
Sorry. I'm gonna have to cancel my room.<eos> I hope to make it there sometime in the future, too.<eos> _<eos> That's right.<eos> A wonderful day... all planned.<eos> The only thing off the cuff is this speech, and, you know, it's still, you know, kind of...<eos> I think... very great.<eos> Well, congratulations, Ray.<eos> You win.<eos> We all do.
Bill...!<eos> Nardole!<eos> Doctor?<eos> Doctor!<eos> Bill, is that you?<eos> Hello, Doctor.<eos> Is that the President?<eos> It was.<eos> I take it he read the Veritas.<eos> So did I.
You were a Squirrel Ranger?<eos> Oh, I wasn't "a" Squirrel Ranger.<eos> I was the best Squirrel Ranger in all of Miami.<eos> And if a girl tried to sell cookies on my turf, Lil' So-So would go Scarface on her ass.<eos> I was the cookie kingpin, chica.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> When you're nine, cute, and me, you can sell anything to anybody.<eos> You have any interest in going to Bora Bora?<eos> Hell, yeah, I do.
Did I just hear the stripper?<eos> What are you guys doing down here?<eos> Looking for you, sweetheart!<eos> This is the guy you ran away from?<eos> (quietly) Newsflash, gay.<eos> No, not him.<eos> Him!<eos> Ooh... nice!<eos> Gabi, I don't want to marry you.<eos> - You don't?
Don't whoa me, Josh.<eos> I am sick of kissing that perfect ass of yours.<eos> Good luck replacing this, Josh.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I don't know. Uh, but I can't do that traffic school thing for you.<eos> My license is a little iffy.<eos> How great was that storm-out?<eos> And they say you don't learn anything from the Real Housewives.<eos> Elliot, I have something tell you.<eos> Of course you do.
But you didn't tell her it was not okay to park in my spot.<eos> I did not.<eos> Hey. We have a new lead on the shooting.<eos> Anna's waiting up in Ops.<eos> Actually, it's just Callen.<eos> Sam, Hetty has something else for you.<eos> Where is Hetty?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, all she said this morning was that she had one last card to play.<eos> She always does.
They're talking about a cleansing ritual, a-a baptism?<eos> Looks like they're taking them into some kind of a bunker.<eos> Gentlemen, you have asked to join our ranks, and you have been found worthy.<eos> It is time for you to declare your servitude to our great cause.<eos> Samuel.<eos> Step forward to be baptized.<eos> On your knees.<eos> Why are they restraining him?<eos> Samuel, do you accept Him into your heart?<eos> I do.
The fact that Mr. Stone, because of some personal vendetta, or... or impotent ambition, or whatever it is that gets him up in the morning, chooses to accuse me of killing my son-in-law, my son, as far as I'm concerned,<eos> it's a clear example of... Of the pettiness and the deterioration of a legal system... Excuse me... that we are supposed to be relying on.<eos> Did you have anything whatsoever to do with sabotaging the Riverfront site?<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Linden.<eos> You received your MBA from Columbia, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Do you remember the subject of your master's thesis?<eos> Well, it was 30 years ago.<eos> No, I don't.
I had to teach them everything, every single thing.<eos> You feel that rush?<eos> You feel it?<eos> - You feel the rush, baby?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know what it feels like now?<eos> You are fearless.<eos> Like you.<eos> We need to talk, Nicky.<eos> Yeah, we do.
We need to find out who placed it.<eos> I looked into the envelope the log came in.<eos> Made by Minoso Paper Company... available in any office-supply store on the East Coast.<eos> - No fingerprints, no DNA.<eos> - So a total bust.<eos> Whoever left that info for you in the elevator didn't want it traced back to them.<eos> Well, luckily, they gave us enough to figure out where the anonymous tip was placed from.<eos> City directory says it's a pay phone in the Financial District.<eos> - They still have those?<eos> - In 2011, they did.
That makes him a ward of New York state and... and eligible for CIU review.<eos> The M.E. put Claire's time of death at 4:30 a.m.<eos> Gerald didn't call 911 until after he found her at 7:30 a.m.<eos> When the police and the paramedics arrived at the house the defendant greeted them showered and dressed for the day.<eos> His pajamas, covered in Claire's blood, were found in the washing machine.<eos> You'll hear from forensics experts that there was blood on the bathroom sink and shower where Gerald had cleaned up.<eos> He was horrified.<eos> Your wife is dead...<eos> Who worries about appearances?<eos> The defendant does.
I had no choice.<eos> I had to run.<eos> I ran too.<eos> After they killed my family.<eos> But then one day I realized that I couldn't run anymore, that I had to fight.<eos> No, it doesn't matter.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No.<eos> You don't, actually.
It was the boys' turn to get up early and make New Year's breakfast for the girls.<eos> Eggs, bacon, sausage...<eos> We kind of phoned it in this year.<eos> Oh. We had Pop-Tarts, 'cause we like to support American businesses.<eos> Now we're off to shovel Mr. Jenkins' driveway.<eos> We just like to help the elderly when we can.<eos> I mean, how can it be a happy new year if you don't do something for others?<eos> Yeah, well, helping others can be a little neglectful to your family.<eos> That's why we're going as a family to the Orson Escape Room.<eos> Oh, we did that 18 months ago!
- It's time to eat.<eos> - 'Cause we're hungry. - Yeah, I'm hungry.<eos> - And I'm saying the blessing this time.<eos> Daddy, don't be too long winded this time, please.<eos> Make it two minutes this time, two minutes.<eos> Okay? I'm gonna say "Jesus wept." We gonna be right out of here.<eos> - He knows how you...<eos> - He gonna talk about Jesus for 20 minutes.<eos> He know he wept, okay?<eos> He did the weeping.
She even said you're the next Patrick Swayze.<eos> That's no lie.<eos> She said I'm a Swayze?<eos> She said you have the looks, charisma, - and scrumptiousness.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> I'm directly quoting her on that.<eos> I always thought of myself as the nudgy comic relief, like Balki or a Skippy or a Boner, but if an objective third party is saying I'm a leading man, it must be true.<eos> Now all we need are some hunky headshots to prove you're not a total goob.<eos> Not that Edie thinks that.<eos> Nobody does.
- Totally.<eos> It was a stupid one-time mistake.<eos> A one-time mistake that we've made every day... for the last three weeks.<eos> Right, but this is the last time.<eos> Starting now.<eos> God! What is wrong with us? !<eos> This has to stop!<eos> - Does it?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> It does.
I will never accept that.<eos> In fact, I'm gonna go get her back right now.<eos> That's 'cause you're obviously still in denial.<eos> - JTP!<eos> - JTP!<eos> - JTP.<eos> - Yes!<eos> You got to give the guy credit.<eos> He always fights for what he wants.<eos> Yeah, he does, doesn't he?
I swear I really am the person you thought I was.<eos> Except I really don't get "Lord of the Rings."<eos> They just walk and talk... and walk more.<eos> It's okay, Adam.<eos> Your mom actually made it better.<eos> For real?<eos> So you still want to go to prom?<eos> Is a nerf herder scruffy-looking?<eos> Jackie, no one knows what that is.<eos> I do.
Donald Bronson!<eos> - Yay, Donald!<eos> Whoo! This is for you, JJ!<eos> Thanks, Donald.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey! How'd the speech go, Ray?<eos> No one liked it.<eos> - Kenneth!<eos> - No, it's true.<eos> No one did.
Maybe we should spend a little less time together.<eos> Mom, I need you to come with me.<eos> Yeah, not now, Ray.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> It's important.<eos> Look, it's just faster if you tell me what you need rather than pretending you want to hang out with me.<eos> No.<eos> One lump or two?<eos> I thought it'd be nice to hang out and do something you like, for once.<eos> You do like afternoon tea, right?
Are you kidding?<eos> I can do absolutely nothing... for as long as it takes.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Already dressed for bed.<eos> You're ahead of the game, love.<eos> ♪<eos> Oh, Ms. DiMeo!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> You're probably wondering why I asked you here.<eos> You did?
Mommy brain.<eos> Okay, well, if that's everything, then...<eos> Actually, I have a serious issue I would like to discuss.<eos> Our home was attacked.<eos> Yes. That's right.<eos> My husband and I went to check the mail, and we found... a pastrami sandwich just sitting in our mailbox.<eos> It was freaky.<eos> That is why I propose that we start a Neighborhood Watch.<eos> I know some of you may think I'm overreacting, like the police did, but I...<eos> Like hell we do.

Oh, no.<eos> I-I-I-I...<eos> "Welcome to the cast, Louie baby."<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Now we don't have to fight over just the one.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's warm.<eos> Disobedience.<eos> Eddie, I specifically told you not to use the dishwasher.<eos> - I didn't!
Hearing what you want to do with that money only makes me know I'm doing the right thing.<eos> You're stressing me out. I need to eat.<eos> Okay, Louis, are you ready to eat some salad?<eos> Call me the Titanic, 'cause I'm about to tear into some iceberg.<eos> Great.<eos> So, for this first shot, Tony's gonna demonstrate the Un-Gun.<eos> And then he'll ask, "And how does it work on those salads?"<eos> At which point, we will pan over to you, and you're gonna say your line, which is,<eos> "Onions, shallots, scallions...<eos> It does it all!"
Why does he get to be the Salad Eater?"<eos> It's like they're setting you up for failure.<eos> Okay. Break all your legs!<eos> And let's roll cameras.<eos> Rolling.<eos> The Un-Gun.<eos> It's so easy, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.<eos> And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shallions, scallots...<eos> It does all of them!
The line is, "Onions, shallots, scallions... It does it all."<eos> What did I say?<eos> You said something different, but it doesn't matter.<eos> Let's do it again.<eos> Let's, uh, roll camera.<eos> Rolling.<eos> And... action!<eos> And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shillions, skillets...<eos> It does them all!

Yep.<eos> I got it.<eos> Let's roll!<eos> An Asian boy named Winterbottom.<eos> Okay, sure, all right.<eos> And... action!<eos> The Un-Gun is so easy to use, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.<eos> And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shallots, scallions...<eos> It does them all!
I get a chance to use my new mail-sorting system.<eos> Mommy, I'd like to try out for the school debate team.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> It'll take time away from your schoolwork, they'll charge us for additional supplies, and I'm not driving all over town to take you to debate tournaments.<eos> Or... it'll look good on your transcript, it's bonus studying, and it'll be a chance to practice public-speaking skills for when you become doctor-president.<eos> - Mommy... did you...<eos> - Yes.<eos> I debated myself.<eos> Who do you think won?<eos> - Uh... - You did.
Surprise!<eos> Sean! Hey!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Axl's not around.<eos> I know.<eos> I actually came for you.<eos> Really? I seem to recall somebody wanting to go to the Chancellor's Ball.<eos> Wait, who told you?<eos> How did you know about that?<eos> You did.
Now that you're here, I-I do have a question.<eos> Um, why do you like me?<eos> It doesn't seem like I'd be your type.<eos> I'll always be here, in this lifetime and the next, for eternity.<eos> But I don't get it.<eos> Why are you wasting your time on me when there's probably some other guy -- or merman -- who'd be perfect for you?<eos> I mean, I've been telling you for a long time nothing's ever gonna happen between us.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> You never told me you didn't like me.<eos> I didn't? No.
I was trying to break in to your phone to see who you liked, and I dropped it and cracked it.<eos> But... And yes, I-I realize that makes me a crazy person.<eos> But if you lived through what I lived through with you, you would understand.<eos> Like, when you were in kindergarten, we had a special arrangement with the nurse's office so you could call me every day at 10:00 because you missed me so much.<eos> And you would only be in Brownies if I was the leader.<eos> And people would tell me, "Oh, girls are great when they're little, but wait till she's a teenager."<eos> And then you were a teenager, and you were just as delightful, and I thought, "We are gonna be best friends forever." And now...<eos> Come here, Mom. No. No!<eos> You don't want me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Do you know if they make them for guys, or...? Axl!<eos> Can you help me with the fruit juice, please?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're acting crazy.<eos> Am I?<eos> I'm not the one who's kissing one guy and dating another.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> You don't want to tell anyone.<eos> I don't even like Chester.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
I've got tons of change.<eos> A marble.<eos> I've heard of vintage marbles going for $5,000, so...<eos> I think we're there.<eos> You take debit cards?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> You don't have any money.<eos> Actually, I do.
She said that she had just had a blowout with her department head.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, Maya didn't want to talk about it.<eos> I should've asked more questions.<eos> I should've done a lot of things.<eos> Um, we have to process your home for evidence tonight.<eos> Do you have someplace to stay?<eos> Mr. Kettering, do you have someplace to sleep tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And what about Collins?<eos> Nothing inappropriate was going on.<eos> Baxter wasn't the only person onboard who said that you two spent a lot of time together.<eos> I mean, that's because we did.<eos> Collins had tremendous potential.<eos> I knew he was officer material.<eos> I was helping him apply for a commission.<eos> We sent off his application to Officer Candidate School a few weeks before he went missing.<eos> In that time together, did he ever mention having any issues with anyone?<eos> Only with Baxter, but... so did everyone.
You're thinking it was staged to look like an accident like Collins' murder?<eos> Well, we're gonna find out.<eos> Torres, get to the hospital.<eos> You're on protection detail for Lieutenant Ellison.<eos> You really think she's a target?<eos> I'm not willing to risk it.<eos> That's not gonna work for me, Gibbs.<eos> I'm not a hospital guy.<eos> Besides, don't you think that Bishop is a lot more suited to protect Ellison?<eos> No... I don't.
We got the serial number to the radio control unit in his car, and the satellite company was able to locate the transmitter.<eos> Satellite radios have transmitters?<eos> Some do, to record proprietary information, yeah.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> Off Highway 224, south of Marbury, Maryland.<eos> The car has been there since 7:27 this morning.<eos> - Go, McGee.<eos> Take Bishop.<eos> - All right, Abby, send me the coordinates.<eos> Um, McGee, your phone doesn't do GPS.
It doesn't matter anymore, does it?<eos> Can you still take him away?<eos> Now that the police are involved, John's gonna have to go through the system.<eos> They already suspect that he's the Key Killer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> Why not kill me instead?<eos> I believe I have.<eos> She didn't deserve this.<eos> No, she didn't.
Jailbreak on wheels.<eos> Just one ranger per transport?<eos> Ranger motto.<eos> "One riot, one ranger."<eos> Any shell casings?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Totally clean.<eos> Very professional.<eos> Looks like somebody knew what they were doing.<eos> Yeah... they sure did.
James fall over again.<eos> And James falls over.<eos> But first, there's been a bit of an argument.<eos> You see, James and I both recently bought five-door German hatchbacks.<eos> His is a BMW i3, which is powered by electricity, and mine is a conventional Volkswagen Golf GTI.<eos> Yes, meaning my car is from the future and his is from the past, making me enlightened and him a dinosaur.<eos> They have been arguing like this for a while now.<eos> The thing is, I don't doubt that in the future electric cars will work, but they don't work now.<eos> - Well, they do.<eos> - They don't, James!
- And I j...<eos> I just...<eos> Once you're on the other side of this... I hope we can...<eos> We can.<eos> We will.<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You risk everything for your country, and I hope I can live up to your example.<eos> Is Harry gone?<eos> I don't know, and I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't know, and I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Thought you left already.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> First I needed to sober up... remember what I'd done and pack my meager belongings.<eos> What you said last night...<eos> You were right.<eos> I didn't get what I wanted.<eos> But nobody does.
We're never coming back, Smurf.<eos> I didn't ask you to.<eos> Yo, who's in there?<eos> - What's up, man?<eos> - Hey, open up.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> You want some coke?<eos> - You remember Callie and... - What are you doing?<eos> - ...her brother Christian.<eos> - Yeah, no, I don't.
I'm sorry Did not know what you were doing, Neither you nor Amelia, does nothing.<eos> It's okay A coffee?<eos> I'm sorry Yup.<eos> I'm sorry I do not understand why I should Know this whip.<eos> I'm sorry Because you have the Prado To a shotgun. Oh Thank you, Angustias.<eos> What?<eos> - Hey, I'm sure I'm back. - Here we are.<eos> Yeah I've always thought That those tits can not be her.<eos> Oh - As? Women are turning ...<eos> - I did whatever I did today. What?
Manny shot him,<eos> Jake buried him, and you just... Watched?<eos> I'm sorry to hear about Julia.<eos> What the hell are you doing, Javi?<eos> You remember this place?<eos> We used to smoke a lot of shit down here.<eos> You, me, and pope.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> She tell you about my dad?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Look...<eos> I'm gonna take care of it.<eos> I'll take care of it, okay?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> What's that?<eos> Rent's due.<eos> Gotta keep our money nice and clean.<eos> Do you want me to send it in?<eos> Read my mind.<eos> - How you doing with your homework?
- Do you love him?<eos> - I really...<eos> No.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I want you to drop it.<eos> You got to tell me, Bonnie.<eos> You got to tell me, okay?<eos> I'm your sister.<eos> I don't love him.<eos> I never did.
What brings you by?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know, so much has changed about this place.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were with Bonnie?<eos> When would I have the chance to tell you that?<eos> That's a good point.<eos> You never called me back.<eos> She doesn't care, Annie.<eos> You know she doesn't.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Six months in my womb, a near-fatal C section, and decades of sleepless nights says otherwise.<eos> You're not taking care of yourself.<eos> Rosewood: Just need a little time. Then I'll be okay.<eos> My man.<eos> I'm serious, no, let me tell you something...<eos> The truck was coming right at us, right, bullets flying everywhere.<eos> Luckily, I had my raid vest on.<eos> Brian Williams here seems to forget that he was around the corner in the surveillance van - at the time.<eos> - Okay, did I or did I not catch the killer?<eos> - [Chuckles] He did.
- Of course.<eos> - We're hoping you can answer some questions about Emilio's last escape.<eos> Certainly. - Anything for Emilio.<eos> - Good.<eos> So, he had 10 minutes to escape.<eos> That's plenty of time. So why didn't he?<eos> Sometimes, in our line of work, things just go wrong.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I'm afraid we may never know what happened during Emilio's last moments.<eos> - Well, but actually, we do.

The God of the Bible.<eos> That is a mother-fucking shit kind of god.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> We're all going to Heaven.<eos> But whilst we're here... (HE CLICKS TONGUE) ... on Earth, let's listen to our hearts - and let's chase our dreams.<eos> Amen!<eos> - Amen!<eos> - You are preaching blasphemy.<eos> And I will have the blood of this entire church on my hands if I do not speak!<eos> Please, sister, do.
How'd it go at the doctor's?<eos> Fine, he said that I could start trying to get pregnant again if I want to.<eos> Oh, that's great news.<eos> Jill, I would really love another chance to be your pregnancy partner.<eos> That's sweet, but no.<eos> I thought we were good.<eos> We are.<eos> I've just decided not to try again.<eos> You don't want to be a mom anymore?<eos> No, I do, but, um...
- It's already in motion.<eos> - But how?<eos> You said she's on a ship that no one can get to.<eos> Someone can.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Do you believe in witches?<eos> Emanuelle, this is Stephan Narcisse, he's the lord chancellor of France.<eos> Stephan, this is a witch that my pious daughter,<eos> Leeza, rounded up amongst other heretics. I didn't care for her.<eos> Clearly, you don't, either.
- Great.<eos> So. Superman on the big screen.<eos> - That's pretty cool, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can't believe they decided to play it right after I was talking about wanting to see it.<eos> Yeah, it's funny how things work out sometimes.<eos> I like your hat.<eos> Thanks, yeah, it was my grandpa's.<eos> Did Nick ever tell you that he and I used to play on a team?<eos> No, he did not.
Was Rosa already dead when you took the car?<eos> I'm not sure. She was stabbed. She was bleeding.<eos> Who stabbed her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you see who did it?<eos> There was someone else in the room, but...<eos> Man or woman? I don't know because I was drugged. It was all hazy.<eos> How'd you get blood on your hands?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sorry, boss, there's something I need to attend to.<eos> Looks like new guy has diarrhea.<eos> Not so attractive now, huh, Jackie?<eos> Nah, I'm still in.<eos> What's this?<eos> Coming out of the sky, a man in a golden helmet is lifting the bus to safety.<eos> Hey, now, we all just saw Alex run out of here, and then...<eos> - you don't think...<eos> - About him naked?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm just curious.<eos> You just gave me a bit of a heart attack.<eos> Because you do want kids or because you never wanted kids?<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> You keep not answering the question.<eos> Yes, because I'm in a... work situation.<eos> You see, you just did it again.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Yes, I wanted kids.<eos> You did?
She saw through you.<eos> Dialysis?<eos> - What's wrong with your kidneys?<eos> Stop fussing.<eos> Should I be concerned?<eos> You may be dying, but I am here to make sure it's not fatal.<eos> Do you remember who I am?<eos> John.<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> But no one else does.
Put it...<eos> Kelly, Matt.<eos> - How's the ankle?<eos> No secrets around here, huh?<eos> Nope, not many.<eos> - You got a minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Just wanted you to know how much I appreciate this.<eos> Your father always said you were a good kid.<eos> He did, huh?
All right, bye.<eos> Hey, it's Seth Grayson.<eos> Yeah, I got something for you.<eos> Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go, but the FSB replaced the crew.<eos> You have something on your tooth.<eos> Do we know where they were going?<eos> No, but they're still being tracked.<eos> Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him. - This interview cannot happen.<eos> - We still have time.<eos> No, we don't.
You've always been very good to me.<eos> I liked your mother.<eos> I liked her a lot.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> There's a guard on the second floor working with us.<eos> He'll escort you to a corner where a cab will be waiting.<eos> Just... get in.<eos> So you don't miss Texas?<eos> No, I do.
We were discussing Raj's recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.<eos> It's okay, I'm fine.<eos> You Di-- Don't fall for it.<eos> He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you're the bad guy.<eos> Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn't want to talk about it anymore.<eos> Then why didn't you say that?<eos> Because that's not what people do.<eos> Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, you really don't.
Better than most of the stuff in this house.<eos> Now get me those Gloria Esteban tickets.<eos> It's Estefan.<eos> That's what I said. I'm a huge fan.<eos> Okay.<eos> Carlos, Carlos.<eos> Hey... hey, Carlos.<eos> Um, this, uh, Cameron Tucker.<eos> I don't know if you remember me or not.<eos> Oh, you... you do. Okay, hi.
I'm glad you're happy.<eos> Well, I'm un-glad that you're not.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I met a girl.<eos> Hm... it's always a girl.<eos> She was seeing someone, then stopped seeing him, and now she's seeing him again.<eos> - Bitch sounds bootless. - She's not.<eos> So, she was seeing someone, then she's seeing you, and now she's seeing him again?<eos> She thought he was dead.<eos> So did I.
I did miss you.<eos> - Well, I didn't ask you to.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Did... did something happen?<eos> It was the letter I wrote, wasn't it?<eos> I want to stop that, too.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I can't be the guy waiting around for letters or writing words that I don't mean.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I don't.
Yeah, it's this swiss/thai fusion place in the valley.<eos> We can still have a romantic night...<eos> Sitting at the bar if we promise to be out by 8:00.<eos> I was telling the truth When I said I didn't wanna do anything.<eos> But then I saw how excited Dave was about his first Valentine's day, and how over it Molly was.<eos> It was like the ghosts of Valentine's day past and future.<eos> What's it say about us that we'd rather just watch netflix and take separate baths?<eos> Well, it means we've gone to the next level in our relationship, after years of fighting traffic and overpaying for chocolate soufflÃ©s.<eos> I mean, I don't even like chocolate soufflÃ©s.<eos> Nobody does!
We took a Greyhound bus back to Wisconsin.<eos> My mind wasn't thinking back to what was at my house.<eos> I just kept thinking, "I'm free, I'm free," and that excitement of being free and walking.<eos> I always reference myself to this little bluebird that was trapped in an invisible cage, and I felt like this bluebird was set free.<eos> Did you guys talk about your future?<eos> What was your plans for your future?<eos> We wanted to have a family together, and we wanted to build a life together and stuff.<eos> We thought we really had a chance to do it, so we were happy about that.<eos> Does your mom and stepdad know what you did?<eos> No, they don't.
They want you next.<eos> Interpol... just took over two fresh murder cases from us.<eos> What...<eos> What murders?<eos> This Neolution thing.<eos> You want to tell me how you're connected?<eos> Wait... What did Enger say?<eos> Enough to get me listening.<eos> So you have no idea how wrapped up in this she is?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm going for a smoke.<eos> Sir, Hashem Al-Khatib...<eos> Frontenac must have messed up.<eos> You are still with us?<eos> And I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> By offering you something that you value far, far, more than me.<eos> And what could that possibly be?<eos> Guys, do you have any idea how insane this plan is?<eos> Do you realise how many things could go wrong?<eos> Yes, and so does she.
- Listen, I can't hear you speak, so let's do this:<eos> When you're gonna say something to me and you understand, beep once.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Now you're gonna take a step.<eos> This is for--<eos> - Just letting you know that I heard you.<eos> But no need to do it anymore.<eos> If you're gonna go and you've heard me, beep twice.<eos> Great.<eos> No, you just do once.
Okay, so-- so this is what my name would be then.<eos> It would be Fabrizio Stivasen.<eos> - Isn't that a fun game? - That's a good one.<eos> You guys took car services here of some kind, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - There's a way to see your rating as a passenger. - Really?<eos> - Drivers rate you,<eos> - just like you rate drivers. - What?<eos> - They rate you?<eos> - Yes, they all do it.
Walt, you're up.<eos> Insulation hunk with roofing tile on it.<eos> Careful!<eos> Please.<eos> Paige?<eos> David, can I talk to you outside for a second?<eos> I know you're terrified, but they know what they're doing.<eos> No, I'm sure they do.<eos> You just have no idea what it's like to have a child that you worry about every second of every day.<eos> Actually, I do.
Look. I don't know who you people think I am.<eos> You're Jimmy Capone, born James Vincenzo Capone.<eos> My name's Richard Hart.<eos> You left Brooklyn when you were 16 and changed your name for a fresh start, and wound up becoming a Prohibition Agent.<eos> And you haven't seen your family or your brother ever since you left.<eos> But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
If this news gets out, it'll be pandemonium.<eos> Just examine the scene, then scrub it.<eos> You mean cover it up?<eos> Tomato, potato.<eos> Earp?<eos> - Restocking already?<eos> - They say liquor sells itself.<eos> Bet the sight of you pouring' it don't hurt either.<eos> How does our latest cocktail progress?<eos> - It doesn't.
Chop, chop.<eos> Aye aye, sir. Follow me.<eos> Where's Joelle?<eos> She's fine. She's, uh, just freshening up.<eos> You two act like you ate her.<eos> No word from Ferris?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Michelle trusts him?<eos> Yes, she does.
Only by reputation.<eos> Former Navy SEAL, commander of JAG, close friend of Hetty Lange.<eos> I thought you had retired, sir.<eos> So did I, but Henrietta called, said she was in trouble, so here I am, once more in the breach.<eos> Well, we are happy to have you, sir.<eos> What is it?<eos> Granger.<eos> There's been a shooting at the hospital.<eos> I thought he had 24-hour protection.<eos> He did.
You loved that.<eos> All right.<eos> Is it, is it just me, or am I, like, sensing something here?<eos> What do you mean, "sensing som..." Sensing what?<eos> A thing, man.<eos> There's a thing going on.<eos> It... I...<eos> Smell it.<eos> You... you don't...<eos> Do you...
I Te...<eos> Yes!<eos> Aw, come on!<eos> - Double me up. - I wanna watch this.<eos> You ca...<eos> - Don...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no... - No.<eos> - Not your fight right now.<eos> - Come on, come on, come on.<eos> - Don't...
Well, I got a pretty good idea.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's my house.<eos> - That's in Edgebrook, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Damn, I can't afford to live there.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Eh, withdrawn.<eos> My point is you got a sob story.<eos> We all do.
I needed a safe place to knock the crap out of people and not get arrested, so I joined the junior team.<eos> - Your parents were cool with that?<eos> - No way. See, girls aren't supposed to be aggressive.<eos> We're taught to keep it all inside.<eos> But in derby, I get to unleash my beast.<eos> Be fearless.<eos> Must be nice to have somewhere to let go.<eos> You don't need permission.<eos> I just... I with I had somewhere to unleash my beast.<eos> You do.
- Now where is Russell?<eos> - He's in there.<eos> - Okay, 119?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, 119! Beware, the suspect may be armed.<eos> Go, go, go, go.<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> My mom's gonna be here in a second.<eos> I'm sorry... that I didn't tell you.<eos> Not that I did it.
No, we didn't hear good things.<eos> You took Emma to get an abortion?<eos> Jesus, you took a baseball bat to Brandon's room.<eos> That art professor just called me and she changed her mind.<eos> She's gonna help me put my portfolio together.<eos> Ximena has agreed to let you shadow her.<eos> - Are those yours?<eos> - I'm on a derby team.<eos> I wish I had somewhere to unleash my beast.<eos> You do.
Online.<eos> Oh, you just... you didn't ask me what I wanted to see.<eos> Because you told me to plan everything.<eos> - So, what are we seeing?<eos> - You'll find out tomorrow.<eos> - I have work, so.<eos> - And I have plans with Noah.<eos> Well, you can invite him.<eos> Wait, why are we inviting the new neighbors over for dinner?<eos> We never did that with the old ones.
Sure. Why not? Sounds good.<eos> Running low.<eos> Well, it's good to know we're not the only couple with issues.<eos> Honey, are you sure you need more wine?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I... It's, you know, the weekend.<eos> Blow off a little steam.<eos> You should try it.<eos> Do you want to dance?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Am I supposed to care?<eos> Okay, I'm sorry I went off on you the other night, after the party.<eos> I was being judgmental.<eos> And self-righteous, and hypocritical<eos> - and... - Okay, I'm trying to make up.<eos> Okay.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> So does Ximena know you didn't tell moms that you were practicing with the team?<eos> If I tell you, are you gonna go off on me again?<eos> So she doesn't.
Lillian enters as Titus crosses to his bedroom.<eos> Turn on the TV!<eos> I'm on the news.<eos> And it's not just a sketch of me.<eos> ...councilwoman who's leading the fight against a new Big Naturals superstore in East Dogmouth.<eos> WNBC's NewsYUKO has more.<eos> This is it! Shut the hell up, Kimmy.<eos> And I'll be damned if this hotsy-totsy rich mother-- [announcer] This is a News-4 weather alert.<eos> What? They cut me off like I'm some "who cares" fluff piece about a blind kid who loves his mailman.<eos> He does?
Take that, shrimps.<eos> Cyndee, stop eating air shrimp.<eos> Now everyone said "shrimp" except me.<eos> -Shrimp!<eos> -All right, how do I do this?<eos> How do I talk about "you know who" "you know what-ing" me while we were in the "you know where"?<eos> Okay, when you meet Alex Trebek, don't get freaked out that he has legs.<eos> What?<eos> No, I know people have legs.<eos> Lieutenant Dan doesn't.
The President is good.<eos> And the Sith Lord?<eos> The Speaker of the House is happy, rested, and ready for a big day.<eos> I'd heard Roarke was bringing the Muslim registry back to a vote.<eos> I mean, I get it.<eos> It's gone down twice. Why not make it a TKO?<eos> We need to keep your country safe.<eos> Henry believes extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.<eos> - And what do you believe?<eos> - Whatever he does.
Unfortunately, none of that is an element of murder.<eos> Right.<eos> You don't have kids, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I remember when I could hold Diego in the palm of my hand.<eos> I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession... I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
Buying condoms is inherently embarrassing. But you have nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> You Hi. I need condoms to have sex. Uh, but I like to know what I'm purchasing.<eos> Can you answer some questions?<eos> Shoot.<eos> Can I try them on before I buy?<eos> No.<eos> How do I put them on?<eos> Check the Internet?<eos> Did you know that originally condoms were made out of leather?<eos> I did not.
Call Roger Murtaugh.<eos> Calling Roger Murtaugh on cell.<eos> Hey, what's up, Mike?<eos> Hey, I got a proposition for you.<eos> Come on, you know I'm married.<eos> Consider taking my job.<eos> I'm gonna retire, and I already mentioned you to the guy that makes the decisions here, so...<eos> Ho-Hold on.<eos> I know you love being a cop, Roger.<eos> I did, too.
Look, it's not a done deal yet, but it doesn't hurt to take the meeting, right?<eos> Take the meeting!<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Pretty sure I was amazing in the sack, and yet you haven't called, which means, like, you overdosed on spray cheese?<eos> Try to get clean by tomorrow night.<eos> Same hotel, room service.<eos> Or not.<eos> You know, I can eat ten sliders on my own anyway.<eos> What's up?<eos> How we doing?
A little.<eos> Please?<eos> Fine.<eos> Two years ago... I got my driver's license.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you say anything? !<eos> I like being chauffeured around.<eos> It makes me feel important.<eos> So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an Antique Train Museum, I didn't have to?<eos> No, you didn't.
I mean, those cannolis were not Obama's fault.<eos> Well, that stuff goes right over the kids' heads.<eos> Okay, can we at least give it a trial run?<eos> How bad could it be?<eos> Well, I think the Titanic was a trial run.<eos> Come on. They know how to raise kids.<eos> They raised me, and I'm fantastic.<eos> Well, you're humble. I'll give you that.<eos> Look, I will talk to them, and make sure they do everything the way I do.<eos> Oh, the way we do.
But again, dynamite stuff.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you Danielle Janikowski?<eos> I am.<eos> And you are?<eos> Bonnie Plunkett.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, it appears he has a type. Oh.<eos> Or you and I do.
- Oh, we're just getting started.<eos> Actually, I only have one more question, so, yeah, we're almost done.<eos> - Why'd you two break up?<eos> - Well, why don't you ask him?<eos> Because I respect the boundaries of people I care about.<eos> - You just broke into my house.<eos> - Yeah, I don't care about you.<eos> Wow.<eos> - You really love him, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
- Yeah.<eos> What about "Pippin"?<eos> You were in that one.<eos> Uh, I was Peasant Number Two.<eos> And you owned that role.<eos> You ran circles around Peasant Number One.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - Damn right I saw it. - Aww.<eos> - Multiple times.<eos> Dad never did.
Keep that tight.<eos> Okay, we go.<eos> You're not going after him. I am.<eos> He'll lead me to Kate.<eos> Get Dembe to a hospital, please.<eos> We should double back, find another path. This is all too exposed.<eos> You must know my friend Kate.<eos> Should've told you about Janet.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
Our city and our people are stronger when we come together, and it is my hope that the citizens of Chicago will continue...<eos> Did nobody think to pat this guy down?<eos> I was there to protect him, ma'am, not arrest him.<eos> Kimball was under threat at the fire scene, so Lieutenant Hubble asked if we could bring him here.<eos> This is a tragic end to a tragic day.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but is one of you named Matt Casey?<eos> Yeah. That's me.<eos> You saved my daughter's life.<eos> All of you did.
Unfortunately, none of that is an element of murder.<eos> Right.<eos> You don't have kids, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I remember when I could hold Diego in the palm of my hand.<eos> I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession... I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
- Okay.<eos> You know how I can get ahold of her?<eos> No, we have no contact.<eos> Not even a cell phone?<eos> Security?<eos> No one's been keeping tabs on her?<eos> We severed all ties.<eos> Tough love, it's what they told us to do.<eos> Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?<eos> No, no, I don't.
I have yet to uncover its precise location.<eos> A coordinated attack by multiple rebel cells is unprecedented.<eos> And it's exactly this moment I've been waiting for to wipe them out.<eos> I want you to capture their leadership.<eos> In such a battle, it may not be possible to take prisoners.<eos> Ah, but a man of your talents will manage.<eos> If we are to crush this rebellion, we must make examples of its leaders.<eos> As you wish, Governor Tarkin.<eos> She did it.<eos> Hera really did it.
Honey, why don't you go inside and get yourself a snack? Then take a little nap?<eos> I don't know. I'll talk to him.<eos> Got to go.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Well, I am.<eos> You okay, Beth?<eos> Guy bothering you?<eos> No, babe.<eos> It's just someone from work who happened to be in the neighborhood.<eos> How you doing, man?
Okay, then.<eos> Look forward to meeting this Rita.<eos> Don't get me wrong. If there's anything I've learned since I got here, is you have a definite nose for justice.<eos> It's just, you know, unusual way of taking the case, is all.<eos> What are you trying to get at, Gregorio?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> I'm just saying, we usually start things off with an actual crime. Phone call, a body.<eos> But here, banking a lot on this Rita friend of yours.<eos> You must have good reason to trust her instincts.<eos> I do.

No, that's not true!<eos> You don't protect me, I protected you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, no, don't tell her, Dean.<eos> You can't tell her.<eos> Dean, don't tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> - Don't tell me what, Dean?<eos> - Don't you tell her.<eos> Don't you...
I want a list of local doctors who administer inoculations A.S.A.P.<eos> Oh, do you need a hand?<eos> No.<eos> Negative. Stay here, work.<eos> Deep thoughts, by Mitchie Mendelson.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Foreign particles adhered to the esophagus, lining the lungs.<eos> - Theory?<eos> - Brewing. We got any sodium rhodizonate?<eos> Yeah, we do!
Boys, let's feed the dragon.<eos> Holy crap, it's Thor.<eos> I'm Magnus Gallo.<eos> I understand there's a knighthood waiting for me.<eos> Of course.<eos> If you'll just kneel.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Guys, we can just forego the ceremony and introduce him to the game, right?<eos> You came.<eos> Sure I did, kid.
You just brokered a peace treaty.<eos> Like a real statesman.<eos> I almost threw up twice.<eos> Let's keep that between us.<eos> I have never needed a drink so badly.<eos> Today was...<eos> Par for the course.<eos> You were great, by the way.<eos> Truly appreciate your help.<eos> The whole gang does.
They all cheer for me.<eos> And he gets onto the Ejector.<eos> - He grabbed it!<eos> - Yes! Past the Ejector!<eos> He's going for the Point Thruster, misses it, goes right into the coils... and just like that, our man Trevor Carter is eliminated.<eos> Unfortunately, the United States is out.<eos> South Korea is moving on to Level 4, and, boy, do they look thrilled.<eos> Hyunho didn't get high enough to get his legs onto that next coil.<eos> There he goes!<eos> Doing a great job right now.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> He seems confident.<eos> Yeah, a-athletic.<eos> - And maybe the Earth, or maybe not.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> - He's kinda tall.<eos> He seems clean, like he likes a good shower.<eos> I do like a good shower.
Yeah, somehow I didn't think storytelling was a contact sport.<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> I mean, yes, I am a divorced mom.<eos> Wow, yeah.<eos> And yeah, maybe I'm in a...<eos> some weird half-crisis thing.<eos> And my eyes are probably tired, because I spent all day figuring out other people's problems.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I already know that shit.<eos> I do!
And the two times that we met, we locked eyes, and he's got the cutest...<eos> Little face, and these human eyes, and it was, um... it was an instant connection.<eos> You just know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I miss my dog.<eos> - Carl. - Aw.<eos> Well, you should get another one.<eos> I got the space.<eos> You do.<eos> You do.
- Do you think we can trust Ivy?<eos> I'm not a hundred percent sure.<eos> I know what quantum computers are and how entanglement triggers work.<eos> He had surgery a couple days ago, and since we're locked down, I have no idea how he's doing.<eos> Call.<eos> Find out.<eos> He died.<eos> The funeral was yesterday.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
- You got it.<eos> Find anything?<eos> No bag. No phone.<eos> Just a lot of unsettlingly green artificial grass.<eos> Well, I couldn't find anything inside.<eos> If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.<eos> - Okay. - Mm.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.

No phone.<eos> Just a lot of unsettlingly green artificial grass.<eos> Well, I couldn't find anything inside.<eos> If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.<eos> - Okay. - Mm.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.<eos> I do, 100%.
DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.<eos> All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds.<eos> I'm headed out the door.<eos> If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here.<eos> Get an ambulance!<eos> Stand back, sir.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> What did you have to tell me?<eos> They stopped looking for... ffor me.<eos> Who did?
Looks like they stopped around the next corner.<eos> Make the turn, pull over.<eos> That's their SUV.<eos> They're just sitting there.<eos> SAM: Maybe they got lost.<eos> You remember the first time we met Granger?<eos> How could I not?<eos> You drew on him and knocked him to the ground.<eos> Well, I thought he had kidnapped Hetty and rigged the entire boatshed with explosives.<eos> We all did.
And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.<eos> When does that start?<eos> Soon.<eos> See, I could've said "in the near future," but I didn't say "in the near future," 'cause "in the near future" is three more words than "soon."<eos> "In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four.<eos> See "in the near future" is four, "soon" is just one, four is more than one;<eos> saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say, "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers.<eos> Sure, she won't know where I went or if I'm ever coming back.<eos> That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special.<eos> Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don't know what to do right now.<eos> It's okay, I'm just being emotional about this.<eos> Can you not tell Howard?<eos> Well, don't you think it'd be healthier if you told him what's going on with you?<eos> Don't you think it'd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?<eos> Your secret is safe with me.<eos> Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?
Spock, find me the rest of that kill code.<eos> I'll be on the bridge.<eos> Jim?<eos> How is it with you and Avi?<eos> She's an incredible engineer.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You remember.<eos> We each chose our separate paths.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> With enough time some things do.
This is a fight.<eos> We're having a fight.<eos> So it's not over?<eos> Oh, my God, you have no idea what you're doing at all, do you?<eos> I really don't.<eos> Look, I know I messed up last night, but there's this voice in my head, and it really got to me.<eos> I know the voice, Al.<eos> Eh. The fear, the doubt.<eos> I have it, too.<eos> Everyone does.
You leave, I'll never see you again.<eos> I don't forget friends.<eos> You gotta trust me.<eos> My tribe needs me.<eos> I need to go back. Your tribe.<eos> Those Lamanites did a number on you, didn't they?<eos> Heck, I thought you said it was one of them that pushed you off the cliff.<eos> _ but he's the only one.<eos> I've got a father and brothers and... And that girl you said I'm gonna marry.<eos> So I did.
Why couldn't you tell me on the phone?<eos> What happened?<eos> Fiona and I went to see Reid. And?<eos> Reid, are you ok?<eos> It's my mom, she's in trouble.<eos> Were Reid and Diana scheduled to have a visit?<eos> He didn't think so, but it happened anyway.<eos> What does the nurse say?<eos> Cassie didn't bring Diana.<eos> Another nurse did, a Carol Atkinson.
Ok.<eos> Maybe you think you saw her...<eos> Her father's Jack Vaughn, former hit man for the Irish mob.<eos> He and Lindsey were in Witness Protection.<eos> Lindsey and her friend Katie were abducted, Katie was killed, and Jack murdered the unsub in front of me.<eos> Kill him.<eos> When does it stop?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Do you honestly not remember any of this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
But why not?<eos> The higher-ups but a block on him.<eos> He's gen pop all the way.<eos> But SSA Reid is in extreme danger.<eos> Who here isn't?<eos> There are extenuating circumstances.<eos> Know how many times a day I hear that?<eos> I give in to him, the other will come crying.<eos> SSA Reid has rights.<eos> He sure does.
Chunk, I know this looks bad... Bad?<eos> And yet you're here, still trying to save him.<eos> Will killed her.<eos> We don't have all the facts yet.<eos> We have enough.<eos> And here's one more.<eos> I won't be a part of this.<eos> You didn't tell us about the shoes.<eos> I knew it made me look guilty.<eos> You do now.
We have enough.<eos> And here's one more.<eos> I won't be a part of this.<eos> You didn't tell us about the shoes.<eos> I knew it made me look guilty.<eos> You do now.<eos> Why did you steal the prototype?<eos> I didn't steal it.<eos> I created it.<eos> You did.
I tried to remind you with Fay, but... it didn't work.<eos> We weren't together.<eos> I think we need to be together when they die.<eos> Sending you her stupid research and video was the long way round, but... it worked.<eos> Someone's sending me things.<eos> These messages that you've been getting -- you know who sent them, don't you?<eos> You get it now?<eos> You killed her.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She did the first one herself.
What the devil happened to it?<eos> Emma.<eos> Her lack of belief.<eos> It's sapping the magic from everything here.<eos> Well, can't you fix it?<eos> Make it work?<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> I'm...<eos> I don't... have enough power.<eos> Of course you do, sis.
Well, what... what happened to him?<eos> Well, we don't know.<eos> There was signs of a struggle at his place, but...<eos> Dean, can you calm down for me?<eos> I loved him.<eos> He was gonna teach me to Jet Ski!<eos> I know, baby, but I can teach you.<eos> I don't want you to teach me!<eos> - Dean!<eos> - I don't!
The base's newest I.T. building.<eos> Getting it online is paramount for a variety of reasons.<eos> Do you mind if I go check up on the rest of my men?<eos> They're pretty shaken.<eos> Course.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> No, just... seems strange to bring down a detachment unit just to install fiber optic cable.<eos> Well, it is a pretty specialized install.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> I just did a quick rundown on Campbell's unit.
It matters what they think.<eos> I'm 11, so I'm gonna yield my time to Mom.<eos> Oh, Ken, if my cancer scare has taught me anything, it's that life is short.<eos> You have an opportunity here that may never come again.<eos> Yeah, but I have responsibilities as a...<eos> We have responsibilities.<eos> And we'll make it work.<eos> When you look back in 20 years, are you really gonna be happy if you didn't take a shot at the one thing you always said you wanted to do?<eos> But what if this doesn't work out?<eos> But what if it does?
She's all right.<eos> No, don't tell me that you compromised yourself for someone who's just "all right."<eos> Okay.<eos> - She's beautiful.<eos> - Mmhmm. But that's not why I did it.<eos> I did it to save everyone else.<eos> Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.<eos> Yeah, I should.<eos> Yet I don't want you to.<eos> You don't?
Jasper.<eos> Jasper!<eos> Jasper... what do you think?<eos> Fine.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Can we call you Jasper?<eos> He loves it.<eos> Hi, Jasper.<eos> Hey, you want to play a game?<eos> You do?
- Melissa?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Erica?<eos> - Guess again.<eos> - Todd? - Not today.<eos> - Jasper spoke?<eos> ! - What? No.<eos> Carol, that's everyone.<eos> Did you say Gail?<eos> Yes, I did.
Um... to ignore the facts is to, um... is to...<eos> Poor thing, she's exhausted.<eos> She didn't sleep at all last night.<eos> She's goin' down!<eos> Think I should wake her up?<eos> If you wake her up, I'll put you to sleep.<eos> This is really important for her.<eos> Yeah, well, so was going to that awards show with Tucker.<eos> But you don't see me plotting my revenge.<eos> You don't, do you?
Well...<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you have, like, a bathroom or something?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just down the hall.<eos> Okay, we've had so much to drink.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.
- Night.<eos> I was gonna get a little drink. Yes.<eos> You find out who paid the ransom yet?<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Who do we have next?<eos> Two CABGS, back to back.<eos> At least the hybrid suite's back online.<eos> Everyone's wondering who paid the ransom.<eos> I did.
They're just looking for a scapegoat for the Sandstorm raid.<eos> If this team gets paraded in front of a Senate subcommittee, win or lose, that's enough to disband this task force and end all of our careers.<eos> - That is not gonna happen.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> Sandstorm is connected to me. It's my family.<eos> That's not gonna look so good to outsiders.<eos> Especially when the outsider... running the depositions is Matthew Weitz.<eos> Yeah, he's trying to make a name for himself, trying to further his career.<eos> I didn't get subpoenaed. Maybe I could speak to my friends at the DOJ, see if they could delay the depositions.<eos> No, don't do that.
That's unfortunate, but it's still an even match.<eos> Stand still and accept your fate!<eos> You first!<eos> You cannot win, for I believe I am impervious to your attacks.<eos> I believe I will break free.<eos> Quill!<eos> Eyes on the enemy!<eos> Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!<eos> He doesn't have it!<eos> None of us do!
Trying to snatch my best customer?<eos> Lu! Hey!<eos> Long time no see, buddy.<eos> Don't "buddy" me!<eos> That wrecking ball you call Drax is trashing my club!<eos> You want Princess T?<eos> You're gonna have to go through me!<eos> Works for me.<eos> Works for me, too.<eos> And so does he!
I did see you as the type of person that I could only date in a serious way.<eos> But now I know that you don't want something serious.<eos> No, I-I don't.<eos> I just wanted a fling.<eos> And I get that now.<eos> I just put a lot of stuff on you.<eos> Hey, I made assumptions about you, too. Because you're so... sweet and hot and I-I just... really wanted to have sex with you.<eos> Well, I really wanted to have sex with you, too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I still do.
I was so nervous.<eos> I mean, I was 14 years old.<eos> My parents were in the Symbionese Liberation Army.<eos> With Patty Hearst?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> We used to bunk together.<eos> Yeah, she was...<eos> she was like a big sister.<eos> But anyhoo, they made me marry the leader who was 57.<eos> And you did it?
- Oh, I think you can.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I think you could... stay home today, and I'll drop the kids off at Wanda's, and we can go see a movie or something.<eos> I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> I got a job.<eos> Baby, you know you need a break from all that Uncle Daddy shit.<eos> I know I do.<eos> And you do, too.
Is this really you, baby?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You're a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Yeah, we...<eos> We all thought you died. We did.<eos> W...<eos> Everybody was so upset.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I don't remember nothin'.<eos> You don't?
It's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Why can't I remember?<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> We're gonna figure this out... together.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We're taking this case.<eos> I thought you were just evaluating him, Bull.<eos> You saw the video.<eos> He did it.
He did it.<eos> What I saw on that video confirms what I saw in that room: a young man who is highly susceptible to hypnotism and verbal triggers.<eos> Troy is not guilty of this crime.<eos> He was brainwashed to kill.<eos> You are getting very sleepy.<eos> Your screen's filthy and it smells like peanut butter.<eos> Come on, concentrate.<eos> I paid 99 cents for this app.<eos> Okay, hypnosis doesn't work.<eos> Oh, yes, it does work.
You own up to your sins, and you tell the truth to the American people for once in your life.<eos> Roarke calling for the truth?<eos> As much as it pains me to say this publicly, I have seen evidence that Claire Haas covered up what truly happened in the G20 hostage crisis.<eos> She knew the threat was imminent, and yet she turned a blind eye.<eos> And when it was over, she covered it up, and all for one reason.<eos> She financed the attack.<eos> Now...<eos> It's not true.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But the country doesn't.
Only mine.<eos> I did this.<eos> Completely sure that I knew what I was doing, but I didn't.<eos> I am why this did not work.<eos> This should have been your task force.<eos> You knew what needed to be done.<eos> You wouldn't have flinched or hedged your bets.<eos> You are the right man for a job that I just made obsolete.<eos> If you think there's a move left to make and you can make it, this task force is yours.<eos> Clay, don't.
Clay, don't.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Terrifying news out of the Hoover Building in D.C., also known as the headquarters for the FBI.<eos> We have unconfirmed reports that there has been a terrorist attack.<eos> All federal office buildings are in the process of being evacuated as a precaution.<eos> A source at the White House has confirmed that President Haas has been briefed on the situation...<eos> If I had a husband, they'd... hang his portrait in here.<eos> Of course, they don't hang portraits for presidents who are impeached.<eos> Did you write it?<eos> I did.
I do.<eos> Me daughter tells me you're in politics.<eos> You're in poli...<eos> Kathleen, what are you doing?<eos> Getting her voice.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you have to... No.<eos> Before I ever knew who Monroe Stahr was...<eos> I was a Minna Davis fan.<eos> I loved her.<eos> We all did.
French Connection, baby.<eos> Look at that.<eos> It's a modern-day classic.<eos> I bet you still haven't seen it. It's on my list.<eos> Sure you should be doing that?<eos> Celebrating my miraculous survival.<eos> Shot point-blank, barely a scratch.<eos> Looks like more than a scratch to me. Yeah, well.<eos> - You should see the other guy.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
Spencer wasn't at NOPD, Patton.<eos> Where are you on his location?<eos> I got GPS on his cell phone.<eos> Spencer just left Orleans Parish jail.<eos> According to the records, he got custody of Marino.<eos> He's gonna kill Richard and make sure he takes the fall.<eos> Unless we stop him.<eos> You got yourself into a real mess here, Richard.<eos> You know I didn't do what they're accusing me of, right?<eos> Yeah, of course we do, Marino.
Ready for a new adventure?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you Henry mills?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name's Lucy.<eos> I'm your daughter.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- So what do you want me to do?<eos> - Well, you can't do this!<eos> - Why not?<eos> Why not your turn?<eos> - "Turn"?<eos> - Chloe, I... I'm sorry.<eos> - You can't do this...<eos> It's all right, love, we'll sort it out. We'll sort it out.<eos> - You don't want me here.<eos> - No, I do. I do!
So, his testimony's not an option.<eos> Well, we killed one, one wouldn't talk, and you got the other two.<eos> That's a hell of a theory. But I only had two years left on my sentence when I was paroled.<eos> Even if I'm violated, and they make me do every day, it ain't gonna be nothing but a vacation for me.<eos> I'll be out in 18 months.<eos> Yeah, and I'm gonna have a unit sitting on you every second.<eos> They're gonna be waking you up and tucking you in, and when you... when you spend the first dollar of that bank's money... and you will... you'll see me again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Listen, when you get in there, keep your head down, okay?<eos> Do your time.
- Copy that.<eos> Fire Department! Can you hear me?<eos> - What's his condition?<eos> - I don't know, I can't see him.<eos> - There's cargo everywhere.<eos> - All right, stay there.<eos> We're gonna pop the doors. Get in through the back.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I said Hurst tool cutters, Mouch. - You did?<eos> - I did.
- I want a date when he's gone.<eos> Two more days?<eos> Five?<eos> I'm even willing to pick up a construction job or two - if he needs the money. - No.<eos> I'm not putting a hard and fast date on this.<eos> He needs his daughter.<eos> What he needs is some tough love.<eos> I'm all for him figuring out his life, but he's interfering in ours while he does it.<eos> Maybe I want him to do it with me.<eos> - And maybe I don't.
You are going to be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me, on the other hand...<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry your EmDrive project didn't go well, but it was just a test.<eos> I'm sure next time will...<eos> No, I don't think there's gonna be a next time.<eos> When you're passionate about something, time means nothing.<eos> Who said that?<eos> You did.
Listen to your friend.<eos> 9-1-1, my professor, his place is trashed.<eos> He didn't show up for class.<eos> There were big scary goons staking out his house.<eos> They chased my ass across town.<eos> We're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson.<eos> Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.
So the same game as last time?<eos> I answer every question you ask honestly?<eos> No, this time you get to ask the questions.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, I know a secret.<eos> About you.<eos> And you can ask me as many questions as you like to figure it out.<eos> But you only get one guess as to what it is.<eos> Now, guess correctly, I take your phone, I call our friend Lindsey, and I tell her to release your mother unharmed.<eos> If you don't...
I know two inmates, Frazier and Duerson, killed your friend Delgado in front of you.<eos> And I know they wanted you to move their heroin, and I also know that if you didn't, you would have been next, right?<eos> Spence, anyone in your spot would have done the same thing.<eos> You wouldn't have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.
- Not to me.<eos> - Says the former prosecutor who lost to him how many times?<eos> Wow. So how do you intend to prove your innocence?<eos> Well, when the entire system is trying to bring you down, then you hire the best.<eos> That's why I've brought on the world-renowned trial consultant Dr. Jason Bull.<eos> What the hell is he talking about?<eos> Dr. Jason Bull is a highly regarded psychologist, widely considered a pioneer in the field of trial science.<eos> But let's talk about the facts of this particular case.<eos> Why didn't you tell us we took on Jules Caffrey?<eos> Because we didn't.
It's too loud!<eos> We can all hear it!<eos> - Okay, well, this has been...<eos> - You shut your mouth when I'm talking to you.<eos> - Santiago...<eos> - Right, too far.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is all very new for me.<eos> - Son of a bitch. Where'd you find a steering wheel?<eos> - I didn't.
But you're right, Lois.<eos> I'm gonna change.<eos> I'm gonna do all the stuff for you that Larry was doing.<eos> No, Peter, I don't need any of that.<eos> At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back.<eos> "Afraid"?<eos> I love doing that.<eos> It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.<eos> I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.<eos> You always do, Lois.
We need to narrow the suspect pool.<eos> Too bad, 'cause I just widened it.<eos> You can add one of your own to the list of suspects.<eos> What? Who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought I'd run my own test, see what turned up.<eos> It was positive.<eos> Okay, well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> It does to you.
You don't want to find out what happens at three!<eos> You don't.<eos> This is all very fresh.<eos> But when you have a little distance, you might regret not going and getting some closure.<eos> Might help you get rid of some of that anger.<eos> - What anger?<eos> - But it's your...<eos> Do not say "mother"!<eos> A mother is someone who sticks around, day in, day out, and pays the price, like I did with her.<eos> - Well, you didn't exactly...
- No!<eos> It's only right if you take half.<eos> How much is there?<eos> - About six grand.<eos> Six grand.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You keep it.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Means I don't need it.<eos> - And we do? We do, Mom.
It's only right if you take half.<eos> How much is there?<eos> - About six grand.<eos> Six grand.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You keep it.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Means I don't need it.<eos> - And we do? We do, Mom.<eos> We really do.
The woman knows longing and now so do I.<eos> Yeah, yeah. It's great.<eos> I laughed out loud.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it was relentlessly sad.<eos> I mean, a baby died every few pages.<eos> Well, yeah, but between the dead babies,<eos> I mean, there were some solid laughs.<eos> (gasps) You didn't read it, did you? - (gasps)<eos> Of course I did.
He wasn't making a lot of sense.<eos> Said that he needed help, and that there was a new threat.<eos> We're in danger.<eos> You and him?<eos> Clearwater.<eos> King...<eos> It's Hamilton.<eos> Mayor Hamilton's responsible for the chaplain being killed?<eos> "A new threat in Clearwater." That's what Rudd said.<eos> He did, but...
I've decided.<eos> I don't want us to go there.<eos> What?<eos> We tried.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Are you saying you don't have feelings for me?<eos> I'm saying that what we have now is good.<eos> With us, with the kids.<eos> I-If it doesn't work...<eos> But if it does...
Yeah, I'm wondering if the competition between Jake and Zelda got a little heated and she killed him?<eos> Zelda.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Got it. Okay, here's another thing, there's no Internet access here, so the entire gaming system is completely off the grid.<eos> Probably to make it unhackable, preserve the integrity of the game.<eos> Right. Right.<eos> Let's get going, see what else is on these files.<eos> Well, actually, I think I'm gonna stick around, see what I can learn.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> You do that.
Are you all right?"<eos> My kids are terrified of the dog.<eos> My daughter goes to pet the dog, dog goes like...<eos> She's like, "Should I pet her?" "I don't think you should ever pet our dog, honey."<eos> I took her to the vet.<eos> I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."<eos> I was like, "Please be saying to kill this dog.<eos> Please be a doctor that says the dog dies now."<eos> But she didn't.
You or Maxine?<eos> To both of us!<eos> We love each other!<eos> And you want her to get better?<eos> - Well, uh, der!<eos> - Then, stop being so bloody selfish.<eos> What?<eos> No walls, no bars, open spaces.<eos> If moving to Barnhurst for a spell improves her chances of getting over the cancer, then what are you complaining about?<eos> Course you do. We all do.
Sure, Garret stole all my money, but I got to move in with you, right?<eos> And if you think about it, Rae, we are really lucky both of our marriages fell apart.<eos> Yeah. - That got dark.<eos> Got dark.<eos> Morning, Mom!<eos> Morning, Aunt Chels!<eos> Well, hello, Nia.<eos> Hello, sweetheart.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> - You still doing okay on the couch? - Of course.
I don't get it.<eos> The craziest thing that's ever happened to me happened, and I can't get anyone to listen.<eos> Just have another vision. Then everyone will believe you.<eos> Okay, I'll try to make it happen again.<eos> - Are we gonna talk about that?<eos> - Don't see any reason to.<eos> This isn't working.<eos> Every time I close my eyes, I see Nia's face saying she doesn't believe me.<eos> Why do you care what she thinks?<eos> - I don't.
I feel like I'm being hunted.<eos> Nia?<eos> Nia!<eos> Nia!<eos> I'm going back in.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> You have to go talk to Booker.<eos> He had another vision.<eos> Levi... you don't really believe that, do you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
So, uh, what are we doing? Are we just--<eos> Do you not see the phone to my ear?<eos> I-<eos> - I do, but-- What?
Hang up now, please.<eos> Yeah, well, can I just...<eos> Come on, let's go. I knew the drink was spiked.<eos> You bitch! Ow. Shit!<eos> You, uh... you lost something? No, uh, just dropped my keys.<eos> The CSDS are here?<eos> Yeah, Governor's going hard on the drug problem.<eos> There's gonna be a dog at the entrance for the rest of the week. Huh.<eos> What, she didn't tell you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no. No, of course she did.
I'll take her back, Nurse.<eos> Okay. Sure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - How's the arm?<eos> - Getting there.<eos> She is going to tear those women to shreds, piece by piece, and I feel sick about it.<eos> Well, I did try to warn you.<eos> She would have become Top Dog no matter what I did.<eos> Then do something about it.
I got jealous, kiddo, of you and him.<eos> Dumb, right?<eos> I guess... somewhere deep down I always hoped we'd...<eos> I don't know. Please?<eos> Just open it?<eos> 'Member?<eos> Your first week here?<eos> I pointed to that sign and I said,<eos> "If you do like I ask, one day, you'll have all Hollywood in your hands."<eos> And now you do.
And you will.<eos> We'll do it together.<eos> You are a child.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But you don't see me throwing tantrums around the crew.<eos> Miner.<eos> I was just looking for you.<eos> You know this man?<eos> He stole a struck from us.<eos> No, I don't.
Good-bye, huh?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love him.<eos> I can't continue to live a lie.<eos> You... had nothing.<eos> And I gave you... everything.<eos> Just take the money.<eos> The money's not the point!<eos> Don't you have any feelings at all?<eos> Of course I do.
Do you think I can meet him?<eos> I don't think we are there quite yet.<eos> I have only talked to him a little.<eos> And...<eos> I don't even know if he likes me.<eos> If he likes you?<eos> ! Of course he likes you!<eos> Who doesn't like you?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yes, I do.
I have no idea if he is alive or dead.<eos> So I ran away.<eos> I abandoned him.<eos> To save myself.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> Why didn't you ever tell me anything?<eos> I thought you might not be so interested in a married woman.<eos> And you were kind.<eos> And I needed a friend.<eos> I still do.
I can help you.<eos> I have ideas.<eos> I take you very seriously.<eos> You made a great movie.<eos> Maybe.<eos> We won't know that for years and years.<eos> Really?<eos> How can we know what will last until the end?<eos> I love you, Monroe.<eos> Everybody does.
No, it's... it's for a friend.<eos> She's... wondering where she came from.<eos> Thinks she's... she was... adopted.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And is that something on your mind?<eos> - Adoption?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... not "no".<eos> Know that you have options?<eos> Because you do.
I'm talking about whatever drug Tyler was taking.<eos> If we can show that changed his blood profile, and he died because of that change, then we win.<eos> Our supplements are above board.<eos> You have all the paperwork from Eddie Cooke.<eos> I mean, we never failed a drug test.<eos> Say we knew he had taken something, hypothetically.<eos> What would that mean?<eos> Look, there's no point talking what ifs.<eos> If Tyler took something outside of our program, we knew nothing about it.<eos> Well, maybe his family does.
- Did you know what it was worth?<eos> - I thought she was dying.<eos> I just wanted to get her here.<eos> What do you think I am?<eos> Have you got it?<eos> Oh, you wanna search me or something? Okay, Okay.<eos> Just please, don't go back to Flynn.<eos> I'll do whatever I want, alright?<eos> Patient records from the ED indicate the doctor who treated Cindi asked them if they still had some of what she took.<eos> Neither did.
God, I don't know.<eos> There are a lot of bad drivers around.<eos> How long did you represent Clay Nelson for?<eos> Almost 10 years.<eos> - Did you become close in that time?<eos> - Yeah, I guess we did.<eos> Did he ever confide in you about his money problems?<eos> Well, he'd whinge I wasn't making him enough, but all my clients do that.<eos> Were you aware he asked Oliver Pittman to orchestrate a spot bet?<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, he'd whinge I wasn't making him enough, but all my clients do that.<eos> Were you aware he asked Oliver Pittman to orchestrate a spot bet?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> But you were aware he had a gambling habit.<eos> Well, vaguely.<eos> And you were also aware that at least two of your clients were involved in a very large illegal betting syndicate.<eos> No.<eos> For the past two or three years, were you telling Clay and Nate what to bet on?<eos> No. Did you know that the morning Clay died, he was about to tell us who runs that syndicate?<eos> No, I didn't.
Richard's a lawyer.<eos> - Darren's in concrete.<eos> - Concrete?<eos> Darren Faulkes.<eos> He's been a major person of interest in about a dozen inquiries.<eos> Could never nail him.<eos> We're talking about very hard people.<eos> And I can help you with them if you just please give me some names.<eos> Did you know that the morning Clay died, he was about to tell us who runs that syndicate?<eos> No, I didn't.
The other guy's a blank slate.<eos> A blank slate who burns down houses.<eos> Shouldn't we bring him in?<eos> Only if we do it without alerting Faulkes we're onto him.<eos> He's carrying a concealed weapon. Wayne can just arrest him.<eos> We don't want to reveal that we've been watching him.<eos> Or that we know about the warehouse.<eos> I'll traffic stop him for a broken tail-light then arrest him for the gun.<eos> - Does he have a broken tail-light?<eos> Now he does.
- Give me the phone book.<eos> - OK. Look, the success of this entire operation depends on us being as hard as them.<eos> We can't we can't beat these people by showing fear and running for cover.<eos> It just won't cut it.<eos> So, do you want to beat them or not?<eos> Are we still on for tonight?<eos> Well, I think we should stick to what we had planned.<eos> There's not much we can do here.<eos> I can text if anything happens.<eos> And even if it doesn't.
We outnumber you five-to-one.<eos> We thought if we left you alone, you'd leave us alone.<eos> But you didn't want to play it like that.<eos> So if you don't want an uprising on your hands, learn to share the island.<eos> We'll turn the music down.<eos> We also want our stuff back.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - And I can't go back to my people empty-handed again.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> How you doing?
Please, stop.<eos> I'll confess.<eos> I'll tell them whatever you want.<eos> [whimpering] Please, Sun.<eos> You're not a killer.<eos> You're not like me.<eos> I'm your brother.<eos> You were my brother.<eos> Did you all see what I saw?<eos> [all] We did.
She was a fighter, wasn't she, Tyus?<eos> The M.E. wasn't able to recover any DNA from Carmen's mouth-- you did a pretty good job pouring bleach in there.<eos> But only pretty good.<eos> There was still some in her throat.<eos> Could there be another explanation for your blood in her esophagus?<eos> Or maybe you'd like to prove to us that you don't have any bite marks anywhere.<eos> You are getting way ahead of yourselves.<eos> If you tested his DNA without a warrant, that is an unlawful search.<eos> You didn't have permission...<eos> We did, actually.
Same damn thing.<eos> Wynonna...<eos> This baby, what is it?<eos> Ours.<eos> - Is it gonna leave a mark?<eos> - Nah, it's superficial.<eos> You really had no plan out there?<eos> I still had time.<eos> They hadn't cocked their guns yet.<eos> Why? Did you?
Do you have a better idea?<eos> She can't die, Doc.<eos> Not from that. Oh, but she still can feel the pain.<eos> They all can.<eos> It's too fresh to have come from Nicole.<eos> I'd say less than an hour.<eos> Calamity Jane, you minx.<eos> I almost sent you to Hell, cat.<eos> Nedley forget about you?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Josh.<eos> Gabi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Everything where you did love me or everything where you didn't love me,<eos> I mean, who rushes on a train to tell someone they don't love them?<eos> You do love me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You were doing it.<eos> Again?<eos> What kind of dream was it?<eos> I don't remember my dreams.<eos> - You don't?
- So you want me to give you a handout out of guilt?<eos> - I don't want a handout.<eos> But you made me a promise you wouldn't ruin my reputation.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> What you do is dangerous.<eos> - I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.<eos> And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know - what I do is worth it.<eos> - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.<eos> And second, whatever job you think you're suited for doesn't exist in my firm.<eos> - It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Good. Then she's safe.<eos> All right, partner. Get ready to place that line.<eos> Just give it time for the steroids to kick in, okay?<eos> I'll be right in there.<eos> I need your help, Gramm.<eos> It's messed up.<eos> The wrong guy's in that tube.<eos> Don't go there, Drew.<eos> It doesn't do any good.
What alternatives are being considered, Grace?<eos> All options are on the table.<eos> We returned from London at 0700 hours this morning in possession of a rare crystal needed to reconstruct a new fullscale EmDrive.<eos> Which will propel a gravity tractor to the asteroid in time to divert it?<eos> It's a bold move, Harris.<eos> And done without my advice - or my authorization.<eos> - Sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.<eos> You taught me that, sir.<eos> It's only better if you get results.<eos> And we did.
- Bullshit.<eos> You told me you were afraid that I was gonna become better friends with him than you, and that's what this is.<eos> How dare you say that to me in front of Donna?<eos> I told you that in complete confidence.<eos> This isn't about my relationship with Alex. This is about your relationship with Alex and how you're afraid to stand up to him.<eos> You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means...<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.
You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did, I was just wondering, have you redone the assignment that Rachel gave you?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I had a ton on my plate.<eos> I was gonna get to it tomorrow.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Please, I-I really was going to do it. I...<eos> I believe you.<eos> But my rule is three strikes and you're out. Otherwise, where does it end?<eos> In that case, why not do this publicly?
No!<eos> The power cannot be abused by un-believers.<eos> We believe otherwise!<eos> Aw, man!<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> And that is why you will fail!<eos> [all] I believe there is safety in numbers.<eos> I am Groot!<eos> Who wants a stupid Belief weapon anyway?<eos> We do.
- On it.<eos> Ha! I win.<eos> In your face, Quill!<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Last one, double or nothing.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Don't know where he's going, but it better be super-important.<eos> Hey! Let go, Dey!<eos> We ain't got the helmet no more!<eos> [Quill] Not that we ever did.
- Oh, come on.<eos> - No, you have not.<eos> - Hey, everyone. This is our nanny, Renata.<eos> - Hi.<eos> It's just for the weekend.<eos> Susie!<eos> [both laughing] - Oh, my God!<eos> - You have a freaking baby!<eos> Hey, um, I don't know if you notice, but I...<eos> I did.
Louis, what the hell did you do?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Then why were Donna and Rachel slapped with subpoenas last night?<eos> - Katrina, listen to me...<eos> - God damn it, Louis!<eos> How long did you wait to go over there after I explicitly told you not to?<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter, because now your job is to blow that woman out of the water.<eos> Well, that's gonna be pretty hard, since she has a room full of witnesses and she also has Donna on record saying what you did was wrong and that's why you lost dominion over the associates.<eos> Whoa, Donna did what?
I did what I did.<eos> Mason...<eos> Whatever you have to do now, because of what happened,<eos> I won't blame you.<eos> Because you're gonna have to move on.<eos> And this is not your fault.<eos> You were such a good husband to me.<eos> I never thought that I would have a normal life, and I did.<eos> - Cora...<eos> - I really did.
I know.<eos> It was a tough day.<eos> You know what?<eos> What?<eos> You were right.<eos> You were right to push him.<eos> You've been great with him lately.<eos> He's been needing you much more than me, which has been hard for me, but, clearly, really good for him.<eos> You know, I knew about Julia.<eos> Yeah, we both did.
Girls seem to like it when boys wear more than one type of shirt.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I guess to get a sense of your style.<eos> It says something about a person.<eos> Like how some iguanas flare their colorful dewlaps to attract a mate.<eos> Exactly... like that.<eos> I think.<eos> How do you currently pick out your clothes?<eos> I don't.<eos> My mom does.
Yeah, I want to pick one.<eos> Honestly, it's the production value of half of this stuff that turns me off, you know?<eos> Give me an erotic novel any day of the week.<eos> Wait, you actually, like...<eos> Get myself off to high and erogenous literature?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Henry Miller, am I right?<eos> Oh, yeah! "Tropic of Cancer," so good.<eos> You know, it's not like I don't have fantasies.<eos> I do.
- I don't know.<eos> Can I come back in?<eos> - Hey, Vic.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you played the mouth organ.<eos> - Oh, yeah, my uncle was in jail, so...<eos> - Oh, gotcha.<eos> So I just pull this out whenever I need to think.<eos> You got something on your mind?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Hmm, what?<eos> I was just using it as emphasis, I wasn't typing anything.<eos> Oh, oh, you weren't?<eos> Oh, sorry, you were so good at that.<eos> Actually, I'm going to email you this draft, okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Because I gotta run and pick up some more avocadoes.<eos> I'm making my famous ugga-wugga-mole.<eos> Why am I making my famous guacamole, you wonder?<eos> - Are you talking to me? - Yeah. - I don't care.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, you do.
Questions are against the rules.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I will ask you questions instead.<eos> Answer either yes or no to all of them.<eos> First question.<eos> Do people become tougher if they have sex?<eos> I guess some people get tougher.<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Do people get tougher or not?<eos> No, they don't.
The Messiah helps me out.<eos> I kind of thought so.<eos> He talks about the same crazy ideas that he always has.<eos> Aren't you jealous?<eos> He's being interviewed by a famous idol.<eos> I guess so...<eos> Novel.<eos> Yes?<eos> You like the little girl type?<eos> No, I don't.
I remember now.<eos> You're not with that guy today?<eos> Excuse me, but if you want to talk, could you please sit down?<eos> Then, I will.<eos> Why do you write novels, Mr. Hanaki?<eos> Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
Oh, yeah, that's it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we do peer interviews here.<eos> It's supposed to make you feel more comfortable, and I must be crushing it because you seem comfortable, so...<eos> Oh, um... I'm... I swear I'm just like a little...<eos> Completely nervous.<eos> It's just my other school is not this nice.<eos> You guys don't have a yoga room or bio-sustainable duck pond?<eos> No. No, we don't.
Plus, she works at Claire's.<eos> She can pierce whatever you want for half price, except scrotes.<eos> I don't want her handling some other dude's dangle-downs, know what I'm saying?<eos> Oh, my goodness, that was fun.<eos> Casey, you need to write that nice boy that interviewed you a thank you e-mail.<eos> No, that is super nerdy.<eos> Yeah, well, nerdy's good.<eos> Nerds get full scholarships.<eos> You want to go there, right?<eos> Um... Yeah, you do.
Oh and throw in a little something for yourself.<eos> Like, maybe a tooth whitening kit.<eos> Love it.<eos> You're so fabulous.<eos> There, your necessities will be here within an hour.<eos> I am walking out the door now.<eos> Watch me so you can see how that's done.<eos> [Tango music] Who has other ideas for how Von Weber can pay it forward?<eos> Yes Simone.<eos> My plastic surgeon does a one for one program.
Shh! Wait, wait!<eos> God damn it! Now, please, stop putting words in my mouth.<eos> I'm sorry, but that sounds to me like you're saying you wanna kill innocent people.<eos> No, I am not saying that at all.<eos> I'm saying that we need to discuss all our options.<eos> We understand. But we are not going to entertain the option of killing people.<eos> We? What?<eos> Do you got a mouse in your pocket there, Milch?<eos> - Mr. Norris has a point.<eos> - Absolutely he does.
Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry, do we know each other?<eos> Oh, Seth.<eos> West Brook High.<eos> Were you in my class? - Oh, I was in the year above you.<eos> We didn't hang out or anything, but I knew who you were.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Sure, everybody did.
We started telling ghost stories, and we just kind of bonded right away.<eos> And all the other kids were, you know, getting drunk and going to parties, and we're like, "That's stupid."<eos> Plus, we weren't invited to any parties.<eos> You know what? You know what I thought...<eos> I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> I'm just gonna show you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> So, how did y'all get into ghosts?<eos> Did one of you see one?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I'm not gonna ask you nicely.<eos> Play with her.<eos> Do it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Now, you drive careful.<eos> Right.<eos> So, Tijuana.<eos> Any sod-eyed muppet with a bloody backpack and a pair of frickin' Birkenstocks is gonna go on about that donkey show, man.<eos> Listen, listen, boys.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen...<eos> Listen to me now... it's downright naughty.<eos> Whoo! We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave.
No, you don't understand what's goin' on with us!<eos> With me and Donnie.<eos> I like it.<eos> You like what?<eos> It.<eos> When he... hurts me.<eos> I like it.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's World War Three.<eos> What are you really up to?<eos> It's a need to know and all you need to know is you work for me.<eos> That can change with a phone call.<eos> I have friends too, you know.<eos> There you go. Call.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug-induced coma.<eos> They warned me about you.<eos> My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.<eos> Nobody does.
- Oh, hey, look. - I have a girlfriend. - Yo, Will!<eos> - So, you're looking for a job? - Yeah.<eos> What would you do if you won the lottery and never had to work again?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What's your passion?<eos> What do you love to do?<eos> I like to make funny YouTube videos.<eos> Oh, if you like making YouTube videos, why aren't you looking for corporate video work?<eos> Corporate?<eos> Yeah, I don't do corporate.
Which happened just about every single night.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I'm sure you... Hi, hon.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wow, God, look at you.<eos> You remember Miles, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Yes.<eos> And I'm sure you... Hi, hon.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wow, God, look at you.<eos> You remember Miles, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, he doesn't.
For Jack?<eos> One more campaign stop along the way to the grave?<eos> Lyndon's people are right.<eos> It's not worth it. It's not worth risking people's lives.<eos> You tell them we're calling it off.<eos> We'll motorcade to the Cathedral.<eos> The back way.<eos> And then we'll bury him, and we put an end to all this.<eos> I don't give a damn anymore.<eos> I don't.
- Felix.<eos> Why don't you pull over here.<eos> Let me drive and you take a little break.<eos> Okay.<eos> David, you should be in the command center.<eos> President Whitmore, thank god you're okay.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> I had 20 years to get us ready.<eos> And we never had a chance.<eos> We didn't last time, either.
Hand over the child.<eos> She's so little.<eos> Now she's not fucked up by you yet.<eos> You don't even care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now. Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
I'm not unpicking the entire bloody structure either.<eos> Will somebody give them a hand over there, please?<eos> Of course, the irony is, they've given this to a bloody documentaries director.<eos> He won't want any dialogue, anyway.<eos> It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football, you wait.<eos> What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?<eos> He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.<eos> Self-sacrifice, that's noble.<eos> - Only if he stands a chance.<eos> - Maybe he does.
No!<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> I fall out of the cart, then I lose Frank, now I'm being hunted by a douche.<eos> The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?<eos> This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.<eos> I'm such a whore.<eos> Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges... impure thoughts.<eos> We all do.
Five-second rule.<eos> No!<eos> And then they figured out how to drive my car, snuck into an AC vent... and that pretty much brings us up-to-date. Get the fuck away from me.<eos> Frank, I'm sorry.<eos> When you guys fell out of that cart, I could have done something, but I didn't.<eos> Then I did the same thing as...<eos> They killed Carl.<eos> Those fuckers.<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> No... Oh, yeah, yeah, he did.
Ed-ward Nor-ton?<eos> What kind of parent gives their kid a stupid cunt name like that?<eos> Worry not, friends.<eos> I have a solution.<eos> I have invented a Stargate device that will allow us to travel to their dimension.<eos> Fuck, yeah, he did.<eos> And it's dope.<eos> This guy's smart. I mean like, fuck-a-guy smart.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Tom has to write, it's in his blood.<eos> Well, they said the same thing about Scott five years ago.<eos> Most elegant writer i ever knew.<eos> Now the poor son of a bitch can't string five words together to save his own life.<eos> You know tom will leave you soon.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You don't think those bastards at Harper's and MacMillan aren't pouring poison in his ear already?<eos> Tom won't listen.<eos> You saw the dedication in time and the river.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Armand!<eos> Armand?<eos> Armand!<eos> All aboard, ma'am.<eos> Welcome back, detective.<eos> - How was your holiday?<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll grab your bag.<eos> Did you get to see your sister in Los Angeles?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Now, Thatcher, that's someone who gets me out of bed in the morning.<eos> - Come off it, man, the Strummer says this the Strummer says that.<eos> - But Strummer also says, right that you and I should be friends.<eos> Black and white in it together.<eos> - It took the bloody Clash telling you that for you to figure that out, huh?<eos> Some mate you are.<eos> - I know Strummer.<eos> - Sure you do, mate.<eos> We all do.<eos> - No, I really do.
I mean, I keep telling her, "Girl, you need to retire."<eos> Right.<eos> Once you hit 21 in this industry, you're so irrelevant.<eos> Try 20.<eos> True. She won't listen.<eos> Of course she won't.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, she's so desperate, the other day she went uptown, she was trying to buy this baby seal fat from this random woman.<eos> What, you think that's funny?<eos> No, I don't.
- Aw.<eos> I hope he's okay.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for the lift!<eos> I wished they would have done that 10 minutes ago.<eos> Huh.<eos> You know you want to search their boat.<eos> What?<eos> No, I don't.
And we're back.<eos> And now... Who's ready for trust falls?<eos> - I got you.<eos> - No no no no no.<eos> Mighty Mighty Eagle soaring free.<eos> Defender of our homes and liberty.<eos> Bravery, humility, and honesty.<eos> You must have grown up singing this song in school.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Quite an honor.<eos> Seems you've made your choice.<eos> Oh, him?<eos> Believe me, I'm already think about trading him back for the powder.<eos> I heard that.<eos> Perhaps we were both wrong.<eos> We are more similar than I thought.<eos> Thank you General.<eos> - Are you sure you don't want to go back?<eos> - Of course I do.
- You got it.<eos> He'll be with us.<eos> We got you.<eos> Should we find a hole and dig in?<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> Put your helmet on.<eos> You gonna eat them?<eos> I don't eat meat.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> Of course you don't.
You might consider using a round with a superior ballistic coefficient.<eos> Give me the layout of the home.<eos> Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.<eos> Go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Sit down. - What's this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sit down in the chair.<eos> You ever see a match-grade round traveling 3,000 feet per second go through a window?<eos> Nobody does.
- Two! What's wrong with betting big? Winning isn't wrong...<eos> - One!<eos> - Fine!<eos> It was wrong.<eos> - It was wrong. - Oh, my...<eos> It was wrong.<eos> It was wrong.<eos> That's all I wanted to hear, man.<eos> - Did you hear that? - Nice.<eos> Kyle, don't.
I'm responding to your alarm that went off a short while ago.<eos> What alarm?<eos> You're getting this, right?<eos> Yeah, but we don't have any audio in the foyer.<eos> Jesus.<eos> No, it hasn't worked for 15 years.<eos> Well, maybe it's just an electrical disturbance.<eos> We are required to respond.<eos> You mind if I come in?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I do.
-I am ready.<eos> -Not quite.<eos> What are you talking about? I've done everything you've asked.<eos> I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks, hot tubs.<eos> I am totally at one with my panda parts.<eos> Now why won't you show me?<eos> Because I don't know it!<eos> You what?<eos> I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.
We need every one of you to help us fight the Others.<eos> This isn't summer camp, Zombie.<eos> You're a soldier now.<eos> So we don't wanna lose you.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You all right?<eos> How are we supposed to fight the Others if we don't even know what they are?<eos> Actually, we do.
And when the ship arrived, it was like a switch was flipped inside me, and the sleeper woke up.<eos> How many people have you killed?<eos> Did you kill your family?<eos> No. The disease...<eos> The disease that the Others created. The disease that you created.<eos> Your family loved you.<eos> Our kind believe that love is just a trick.<eos> An instinct. A way to protect your genetic future.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> I did.
Cigars built this place.<eos> What you're smelling now is probably bolos or empanadas.<eos> The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.<eos> As far as they're concerned, we're a bunch of dirty spics and wops and we can fuck off and do what we need to do as long as we leave them alone.<eos> You'd think we all get along, but it don't work out that way.<eos> The Italians and the Cubans keep to themselves.<eos> But the Cubans, they hate the Spaniards, and the Spaniards look at all Cubans like they're uppity coons who forgot their place since America freed them in '98.<eos> The Cubans and the Spanish, they look down on the Puerto Ricans and everyone, I mean, everyone, shits on the Dominicans.<eos> The Italians only respect you if you came off the boat.<eos> How you doing, ladies?
My father says there once was a good man in you.<eos> I wasn't aware he'd departed.<eos> You do quite a lot for the people here.<eos> But we both know your good works are mitigated by your evil deeds.<eos> We do?<eos> You profit from the illegal addictions of others.<eos> Their weakness and sloth and libidinous behavior.<eos> But you can free yourself of that.<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> Of course, you do.
I can't prevent him from coming.<eos> Tomorrow, I think it's best you come out there with me.<eos> You can stay if you like.<eos> Hoot'll start thinking I have a boyfriend.<eos> Don't worry yourself about Hoot.<eos> What about your father?<eos> What about him?<eos> You think he knows he's sharing me with his own son?<eos> You think you're something fucking different from them other whores out there?<eos> Do you?
Why don't you read the notebook and we'll talk more thoroughly later.<eos> Statistically, Trevor probably has another seven to ten years.<eos> So, let's do everything right, okay?<eos> - I need to hear you say "okay."<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay. Absolutely.<eos> Trevor, it's his first day.<eos> Please don't make him cry.<eos> - You need anything?<eos> - I do, actually.
I thought I'd like it 'cause it's lame, but it's actually pretty cool.<eos> Let's go to the bottom.<eos> I'll catch up with you guys, all right?<eos> I left my phone in the car.<eos> We got Slim Jims, Mervin.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> What?<eos> Janet didn't send you.<eos> Elsa did.
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't expect to be thinking about this today.<eos> She talk about me?<eos> She didn't tell me much about her past.<eos> Sounds like her.<eos> I did look for her for a while, but who walks out like that?<eos> Maybe I was an asshole? I think about it. I think maybe I...<eos> She just...<eos> You know, we just weren't a good match.<eos> Doesn't mean you walk out, though. You don't let a person wonder, even if she hated me.<eos> She didn't.
You asked to be taught.<eos> And clearly, there is much you need to learn.<eos> How long, teacher?<eos> Until the shadow moves from here to there.<eos> Twice.<eos> You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I do not.
I know what I must do.<eos> Silver Dart Shi.<eos> She had more courage than any one of us.<eos> Turtle Ma.<eos> I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm going to miss him.<eos> Pour him a double.<eos> You know, at the Battle of Sichuan, I did hire out to those raiders.<eos> But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.<eos> I know that.<eos> Always did.
He just got lost.<eos> You saved this entire base, Kirk.<eos> Millions of souls.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It wasn't just me.<eos> Never is.<eos> Needless to say, the position of Vice Admiral is yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
Yeah, I love being spoon-fed in public.<eos> Hello! We'd like a table for three, please.<eos> Of course. If I could just see your badge.<eos> Sorry?<eos> This restaurant's for Premier Badge holders.<eos> Oh, well, we've got the pink badges!<eos> I'm sorry, we can only serve Premier Badge holders.<eos> Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?<eos> Well, there's our relaxed dining area, and there are stalls outside.<eos> The Pig in a Poke does a nice hog roast in a bun with apple sauce.
Endurance, this is Houston. Readypayloadnumbertwo .<eos> Fuck, can we even say hi here?<eos> Ohyeah,sorry.<eos> Higreenstreet,howyadoing?<eos> Sorryyou'restill stuckupthere,buddy.<eos> Becauseoftheinitiallaunch delays,thenewdeparture timeisin eighthours.<eos> Might as well keep my suit on.<eos> Where's the captain?<eos> Hey worsley, captain stanaforth is here. Can you come and say hi?<eos> Hey worsley, how ya doing?
Yes, he can.<eos> He actually did it beautifully.<eos> That's my Adam's apple, you bitch!<eos> Claire, get me a new lawyer.<eos> There's not gonna be another lawyer if you don't have any money, you stupid ginger!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.<eos> Not that you're ever gonna find out. Because you will never be invited into my basement.<eos> I don't wanna see your basement!<eos> Yes, you do!
You know what? Are you Claire's daughter?<eos> I thought you were in jail.<eos> Aren't you charming for yelling that out on the street like that.<eos> May I?<eos> No way.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because Mom's at work and you're fresh out of prison.<eos> Okay, white-collar crime doesn't count!<eos> Yes, it does!<eos> No, it does not. It does not.
I mean, look at him.<eos> He's slumped over, asleep. I hope he's asleep.<eos> You don't want to be that guy.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes. I'm all in.<eos> Dana, I quit.<eos> I'm gonna start my own business, okay?<eos> - I have my own business.<eos> - Yes, she does.
Walter Stackhouse.<eos> Walter Stackhouse.<eos> Walter Stackhouse.<eos> I'm not open today.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's me.<eos> Detective Corby.<eos> I think we need to talk.<eos> Did you read a story in today's local paper about a woman who died at Harry's Rainbow Grill?<eos> Yes, I did in fact.
Coming off a bridge that high, with so many injuries, it's hard to get a consensus.<eos> But I just like to eliminate all the other possibilities.<eos> One more thing.<eos> Did you ever hear about another woman's body found near Harry's Rainbow Grill?<eos> It happened not too long ago.<eos> She was badly beaten.<eos> Knifed.<eos> She was definitely murdered.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
No injuries were reported.<eos> The search for escaped prisoner Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers has been called off.<eos> The three escaped from Alcatraz five months ago, but no bodies have been recovered.<eos> I don't know why I said those things to my mother.<eos> I regretted them the second they fell out of my mouth.<eos> My mother never gave her speech.<eos> She never got to meet Eleanor Roosevelt.<eos> But I could.<eos> Heads, I go.<eos> Tails, I don't.
- How old are you?<eos> - 17.<eos> You know you're not inhaling that, right?<eos> - What?<eos> - Here, go like this.<eos> Try it.<eos> There you go.<eos> You got it, you got it right.<eos> So, Why'd you run away from home? - I...<eos> I didn't.
Okay.<eos> It's cherry.<eos> Mmm-mmm.<eos> Because the time has come for the world to hear the other side of the story.<eos> They say that Superman is a hero.<eos> Okay, but whose hero?<eos> If Superman were here right now, what would you want to say to him?<eos> That my family, too, had dreams.<eos> To look him in his eye and ask him how he decides which lives count.<eos> And which ones do not.
How far will he take his power?<eos> Does he act by our will or by his own?<eos> People hate what they don't understand.<eos> But they see what you do, and they know who you are.<eos> You're not a killer, a threat.<eos> I never wanted this world to have you.<eos> Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument. Be their angel.<eos> Or be none of it.<eos> You don't owe this world a thing.<eos> You never did.
What are you talking about?<eos> - Like what? Is this about the money?<eos> - Of course it's about the money.<eos> All right, okay, fine, you know, I lost my credit card, okay?<eos> And they put a block on it.<eos> And I realized that you might come up short, so I went to the bank and got you some cash.<eos> Here you go.<eos> That's why I came round today, to make sure you and the kids were okay.<eos> Em, come on, you didn't think I would just, like, leave you hanging, did you?<eos> You did, didn't you?
No one ever gets up close to you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of the smell.<eos> The smell is rough.<eos> But it's not just, "oh, look at me."<eos> It's, "Igot the brains." You guys got the know-how.<eos> You got the noggin.<eos> You came up with this stuff, with the thumb.<eos> Come on, show me.<eos> How do you do that?
Then we go up.<eos> All right.<eos> We're right above the Hall of Five Hundred.<eos> There's a stairway leading down to the street on the other side.<eos> So one step at a time, huh?<eos> You afraid of heights?<eos> A little.<eos> I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.<eos> So don't look down.<eos> Or do.
I make bets.<eos> But it isn't really gambling if you know who's going to win.<eos> I'll see you out.<eos> Your old partner tells me he didn't much care for Soberin working both sides of the street.<eos> Even you appreciate loyalty.<eos> - So you made him choose.<eos> - Of course.<eos> And Whitmore lost his man.<eos> No.<eos> No, I did.
- I think we can do it.<eos> It worked!<eos> Move!<eos> Go!<eos> What?<eos> Did you train him to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have no idea how he learned this.<eos> - Did that just happen?<eos> - Yeah, it did!
Please don't. Please.<eos> Please stop.<eos> So now you control your fate.<eos> Tell me the story, so I won't send the elevator down, because, if I send it down to the basement, there's no way for it to be down there and you to still be here.<eos> I'm not telling you the story.<eos> Just stop this, please.<eos> Last chance.<eos> I'll start it for you.<eos> When I was a little girl...<eos> - Please don't.
We can't all be held accountable for our adolescent personas.<eos> Can we, Magicolio?<eos> Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I love magic.<eos> Like you, and many others who, I suppose, were not getting any sex in high school, I dabbled with it.<eos> But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?<eos> We know how you did it.<eos> No, you don't.
I give you the senator for New York, Henry Shaw. Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Thank you. And it's true, we have made some progress.<eos> But there is no reward for idleness.<eos> So just as the odious saloons have been banished... So now the pool halls, and these private parlors... What is that?<eos> Witches.<eos> Our American friends have permitted a breach of the Statute of Secrecy that threatens to expose us all.<eos> I will not be lectured by the man who let Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers.<eos> Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is critical...<eos> You better have an excellent excuse for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.<eos> Yes. I do.
I'm sure that will make everything just fine.<eos> I was on your side.<eos> Vix, wait up!<eos> Vix!<eos> We should've told him.<eos> I want to tell him everyday for the past 13 years I want it to.<eos> Me too.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I've failed.<eos> We both did.
Wait.<eos> So back this up for a second now.<eos> You're already working with stiffs? I thought first years didn't get to work...<eos> Wait a second. Do they stink?<eos> Well, so the cadavers we use in class are supposed to be odorless.<eos> But they bring out this one guy...<eos> - Did he have a big dick? - Keep it classy, Amanda.<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?<eos> Did he?
Yeah, I got me one of those.<eos> Yeah, they're pretty good for looking at the stars.<eos> I use mine for looking at my neighbors.<eos> I'm just screwing with you, John boy, come on.<eos> No, but I do watch that road out front. See some pretty interesting things.<eos> Sometimes a car will come in light with one pair of plates. Hour later, goes out heavy with another pair of plates.<eos> Ain't that weird?<eos> We all got our secrets.<eos> I ain't no hypocrite.<eos> You do what you do, i do what I do.
You understand?<eos> Even if we are family...<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on!<eos> Pick up the phone!<eos> Recording: At the tone, please record your message.<eos> When you finish recording, you may hang up--<eos> Rosie?<eos> Troy!<eos> You didn't happen to see, uh, Rosie come by here in last hour or so, did you?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
As long as the posts are up, i have no choice but to suspend you for the rest of the semester.<eos> Mom, you don't always have to call me on facetime, you know.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I, I didn't want you to worry, okay? I'm coming to pick you up.<eos> I want you home.<eos> Look, look, I'll call you later. I promise, okay?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Yeah, she friended him right before he died.<eos> There's something else.<eos> - Jesus, Kobe, I don't...
You look well.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> It has.<eos> Not too bad yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is my brother, Scott.<eos> Hello, Scott.<eos> Welcome to the School for the Gifted.<eos> Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.<eos> It never does, at first.
I'm good.<eos> Playing Pac-Man.<eos> You sure you weren't watching this?<eos> This news comes at a time when the world is celebrating 10 years of peace... between mutants and mankind.<eos> You're going after him, aren't you?<eos> You wanted me to get out of the house more, right?<eos> I can't stop you.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> But trust me, this won't end well.<eos> Nothing does with him.
I can't get us in there.<eos> Erik!<eos> Mystique.<eos> I know you think you've lost everything.<eos> But you haven't.<eos> You have me.<eos> You have Charles.<eos> You have more family than you know.<eos> You never had the chance to save your family before.<eos> But you do now.
We have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.<eos> And you are?<eos> Major Susan Turner. 110th Military Police.<eos> The Major Turner who's wanted by the MPs for espionage?<eos> You mean these MPs?<eos> These crates are supposed to contain weapons belonging to the United States Army.<eos> In fact, you sold them to insurgents.<eos> And these are now empty.<eos> Do you know who I am, Major?<eos> Yes, General. I do.
The show? Guys, I'm done.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - What do you mean, "done"? Come on!<eos> Didn't you see this?<eos> Huh?<eos> Look, it says I'm a "danger to society."<eos> "A deluded, washed-up charlatan "who never had a hit in his career."<eos> Oh, come on, you don't believe all that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Please sit down!<eos> Hey!<eos> Put your shoes back on right now!<eos> Zoe, I saw that!<eos> Stop it!<eos> And, Leo, that is disgusting. Well, John, I've covered many disasters for this network, but this is sure to... Oh, they're about to start.<eos> Okay, guys, listen up! Look, I gotta tell you, um, there's not much of an audience out there tonight.<eos> But you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It really doesn't.
Ramsey, did Loretta call?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did she tell you what I said?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She wants me to fire you.<eos> I told her no way, not after what you did in court.<eos> It's just normal craziness at the end of a trial.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I accused her of killing her husband, did she mention that?<eos> Yes, she did.
Like I'd be interested in girls?<eos> I believe you already are.<eos> Deep down. That's what nature intended you to be.<eos> Something just knocked you off course along the way.<eos> I mean I wasn't abused or molested or anything like that.<eos> Okay, that's great.<eos> We'll look for another explanation then. You and I can work on finding that together.<eos> I want to help you, James.<eos> But you have to want it too.<eos> - I do.
Fuck!<eos> Goddammit!<eos> - Having trouble?<eos> - What the hell it looks like?<eos> What is it?<eos> Those yankees came back again this morning.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The ones trying to buy the farm.<eos> - I thought you told them no.<eos> - I did.
Then, the Watchers came after us for snitching.<eos> But they messed with my dad's job, they leaked photos of my sister online, they stole our identities, Vee.<eos> Me and Ty, we became prisoners of the game.<eos> Oh, come on, what does that even mean?<eos> It's the third category.<eos> Watcher, Player, Prisoner.<eos> I'm trapped.<eos> The only way out is to win.<eos> - So, you have to win.<eos> No, you do. - What?
After six minutes, brain death.<eos> Without an antidote, the death rate is 100%.<eos> This is the antidote.<eos> This will bring Jim back to us.<eos> Now, do not, under any circumstances, administer the antidote before the full six minutes.<eos> Set the timer, Sam.<eos> Long enough to dance with death, not so long as to marry her.<eos> He had an antidote.<eos> - Would that even work?<eos> If done in time.
- So where do I jump from?<eos> - Here.<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How'd that look, lads?<eos> Yeah, it looked all right.<eos> It's a bit shit.<eos> That supposed to look like they're jumping in or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't.
- Yes.<eos> Yes, that amount.<eos> You are joking?<eos> That's half of what it's worth.<eos> Seriously, Jo.<eos> You know I put a lot more into it.<eos> What was that place worth before I came along?<eos> A twentieth of the money I sank into it.<eos> - I didn't find any...<eos> - Of course you didn't.
Sweetheart, listen to me.<eos> The doctor said you need to rest.<eos> Dad's right.<eos> Liam. Sweetheart, look at me.<eos> Give me a sip of your flask.<eos> What flask?<eos> I don't have a flask.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Morning.<eos> How you doing today?<eos> Morning, Officer.<eos> Can I see your license and registration, please?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Nice rig.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I pulled you over because your back left taillight is out.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
Horrible. Come on.<eos> Bob!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it crazy?<eos> What, surprising your dad and his new family on New Year's Eve when they've given no indication that they want you there?<eos> Yeah, well, when you put it like that... But he didn't exactly say I couldn't come. And, I don't know, things have been going pretty good lately.<eos> Do you ever wonder why people kiss with their lips?<eos> I mean, why not rub ears like, "I want to hear you."<eos> Or wrists, like this.<eos> Hey, you did way too many threes!
My key worker, she called?<eos> I'm just warning you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Sign.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> - Let me explain!<eos> -What's to explain?<eos> I have eyes, James.<eos> You're an addict. You lied to me!<eos> No, I didn't!
I can just... yeah.<eos> You're like a dog.<eos> Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.<eos> And you can kick them. They keep coming back to you. Thinking that somehow if they're good...<eos> ...you'll love them.<eos> This is what you do. You're not doing this to me. You brought this on yourself, Rachel.<eos> If you had just stayed away that one night... Just left us all alone.<eos> You brought this on Megan.<eos> In a way, you killed her.<eos> But I didn't. You did.
What?<eos> I guessed but I wasn't sure.<eos> Since when?<eos> From the very start.<eos> So I'm the only dickhead once again.<eos> Driving up here like a happy donkey you two laughing at the dunce?<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Why didn't you tell me to piss off?<eos> Why didn't you?
- Yes, sir.<eos> I come here all the time.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Oh, it's all right.<eos> How you doing?<eos> What's this?<eos> Glad you're putting it to use.<eos> - Well, I'm trying.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So how we doing?
- You really want to go there?<eos> - No, I really don't but, at the same time, I'm not going to roll belly up to avoid a fight either.<eos> Why?<eos> That's what you normally do with Cassie.<eos> - Right, come on.<eos> - Well, you know, ever since I've known you, you'll do anything to avoid being unpopular, whether it's what time she went to bed or whether she should study for exams, or how much pocket money she should have got, you know.<eos> I've always been the one that paid the price for you being spineless.<eos> Right.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Hey, Tosh, how you doing?
I live alone.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Sandy?<eos> - Did you go to St. Ninian's beach at any point?<eos> - I never drink and drive.<eos> - Who said anything about driving?<eos> I just assumed.<eos> It's too far to walk.<eos> So you didn't go to St Ninian's beach?<eos> No, I didn't.
It's going to be all right.<eos> Michael.<eos> You need help.<eos> I'm going to get you the help you need, and everything is going to be okay.<eos> Okay. Are you all right, sweetheart?<eos> Mommy was hurting me.<eos> No, no.<eos> Mommy's just not herself right now.<eos> But she loves you very much.<eos> And so do I.
We'll call you if there's any news.<eos> Goodbye and thank you.<eos> Be strong.<eos> Well?<eos> It's not good.<eos> Do you mind sleeping in the guest room?<eos> No.<eos> You're sleeping with me.<eos> Did you see Richard with Hélène?<eos> I did.
- Just give me a second.<eos> Okay, continue.<eos> Catch!<eos> Ready.<eos> Slow down, I can't see the notch.<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Catch... I think.<eos> You think?<eos> It's behind the other two rings, and I can barely see it, but I heard something latch, did you hear it?<eos> No, I didn't.
And you never stop and keep searching?<eos> And you don't know what happens over time, things change, and entire worlds change.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Stay.<eos> I can't.<eos> Stay right there<eos> Weren't you supposed to look after him?<eos> Where were you?<eos> John heard Mantosh is out on the boats.<eos> Doing a lobster run.
Hmm-mmm. - I wanna say muscles?<eos> - That'll work.<eos> But three people can't carry this team.<eos> No.<eos> Right now is our time to party. Right now.<eos> It's just...<eos> I mean look at Sammy.<eos> He's been hammered since 10:00 am. He's doing it right.<eos> Hey, Sammy!<eos> Hi, buddy, how you doing?
Theia Voula said to remember I was a girlfriend before I was a mother.<eos> Yeah, you were my girlfriend.<eos> Hey, remember when we were dating, you wouldn't let me drop you off in front of the house 'cause you didn't want your parents to see me?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't want you to see the house.<eos> How could I miss it?<eos> I used to park right here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I remember those good-night kisses.<eos> Oh, you do, huh?
- Newark is in America.<eos> - Grandpa!<eos> Yes, darling. What?<eos> Yes, sweetheart.<eos> Come to the barn to see Count.<eos> Wait till you meet him.<eos> He's so... I adore Merry.<eos> I think she's very special.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We all do.
- Dawn.<eos> Well...<eos> Dawn. Baby, come on.<eos> ♪ I do the same thing all over... ♪<eos> - All right, all right, all right.<eos> All right.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't.
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.<eos> Sherman says you hacked the Human Resources site.<eos> -Yeah, it's my job to find flaws.<eos> The security of the HR site is not your problem.<eos> You went outside the wheelhouse.<eos> Okay, but just to clarify, I did not hack.<eos> I showed that it could be hacked.<eos> You told me to find a patch.<eos> Do you have that in writing?<eos> -Yes, I do.
My friend Tasha here with the Air Force reins Hellfire. There she is now. Hey, Trev.<eos> You liking' the show?<eos> -You know it.<eos> We track 'em, you whack 'em.<eos> -And who did we just track?<eos> Not who, what.<eos> We're targeting bad guys' cell phones. Sometimes a SIM card.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how do we know the bad guy is in possession of the bad cell phone? We don't.<eos> - Of course we do.
- Those are Greer's orders.<eos> - We are not leaving him.<eos> - You came back for us. Yes?<eos> - I'm here.<eos> You chose to go to the compound and work.<eos> You could've joined one of those gangs, but you didn't because you wanted to help.<eos> You wanted to help.<eos> You want a second chance, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Yeah I don't mean- this is it...<eos> I mean, this is- it could feasibly be- yeah for..<eos> I could be on tour with this... For a couple of years at least, just this record.<eos> Do you like the music you're playing?<eos> I don't... I don't know... what- what it matters.<eos> Well, it matters because... if you're going to give up your dream.<eos> I think it matters... that you like what you're playing on the road for years.<eos> Do you like the music that I play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I think I'll see how Zephyr's coming with that cobbler.<eos> I just heard how you snuck that bill through Jim's committee with some bogus procedural point of order.<eos> A perfectly legal maneuver, Uncle Dick.<eos> - Just like you taught me.<eos> - I also taught you something about party loyalty.<eos> Well, the party's changing.<eos> This younger generation's not gonna fall on their sword for segregation.<eos> You think every Southerner is gonna start dancing to your tune?<eos> Wallace almost won Maryland.<eos> - But he didn't.
On your knees, Professor.<eos> Hands behind your head.<eos> Thank you, John.<eos> Since when do you call me John?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> Time you woke up, Sherlock.<eos> I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course you do, John.
He's not my dad.<eos> What?<eos> He was my pimp...<eos> If you borrowed money, you gotta pay it back!<eos> How could you leave me hanging like that?<eos> Because you ran away...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Shit!<eos> You messed me up, real good!<eos> Please don't...
- You know, sometimes I see ghosts of ex-boyfriends.<eos> I'll wake up, in the middle of the night, and they'll be standing at the edge of my bed in the shadows, watching me.<eos> - They're not dead.<eos> - No, but when I finally do wake up, I have to text them to make sure.<eos> - That's gotta be an awkward text. Hey, it's me, long time, by any chance did you die?<eos> If so, did you haunt me last night?<eos> - Vodka.<eos> Makes letting them go harder.<eos> - I never got a text, so I guess you never saw me.<eos> - I did.
Who do we have on the line?<eos> - My name is Alan Weiss.<eos> I'm a producer at eye witness news in New York.<eos> - So you were there when they brought him in?<eos> - Yes, I was inside the emergency department when they brought John Lennon in.<eos> - All right, Alan, can you tell us exactly what happened?<eos> I'll do my best to tell you as much as I know with as much detail as I can.<eos> My gurney was situated outside the O.R. Where they worked on him.<eos> -So you saw him come in?<eos> - No, I didn't.
And then I found out i was pregnant.<eos> And... He swore up and down that he'd change.<eos> And that he was sorry.<eos> And I believed him.<eos> And... Then one day, he went off again... And my sister took me to the hospital.<eos> What I'm trying to say is I... I know what it feels like to lose a child.<eos> Just like the heelshires.<eos> And that ties me to them. And to brahms. And to this place.<eos> Does that make any sense to you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
We all have these problems.<eos> Then, why do we feel it right to live beyond our means?<eos> Why should we live beyond our earnings?<eos> What sense does it make when we're stuck, 15 years down the line, shackled with debt?<eos> Debt hanging down our throats.<eos> Does the bank care about your hard life?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Do they care about your low income?<eos> - No. - No, they don't!

When was the last time you fed?<eos> This morning after we came back.<eos> Hold still.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Mommy says Huntington's a gift from God.<eos> The pain reminds us how precious life is.<eos> Your granny said the same thing to your mom when she was your age.<eos> Did Granny die of Huntington's?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Well, I certainly hope so.<eos> Quite right.<eos> And talking of toilet paper, would you please be so kind as to make sure the paper unrolls over the top of the roller, and not from the bottom?<eos> I don't know how many times I have to tell you, but you keep putting it the wrong way.<eos> - I swear you've never mentioned it.<eos> - I did, you know.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did, Dorottya.<eos> - No, you did not.<eos> - I did.
Wonderful day.<eos> So, you started writing your memoirs?<eos> Not at all.<eos> This is my speech.<eos> - What speech?<eos> - For the award thingy.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> I've never been more serious in my life.<eos> You know, Milly, I've always wanted to say that line.<eos> And in my entire career I never once did.
Michael, we cannot.<eos> Hey, Compliance, are you listening?<eos> The only wall we're crossing here is the wall of love.<eos> Oh, Mich...<eos> Never a dull moment here in Compliance.<eos> That... That's his company phone?<eos> Isn't that crossing the wall?<eos> Well, technically there's nothing criminal here.<eos> So Remson doesn't have a policy prohibiting... this kind of romantic relationship between two employees?<eos> Some banks do, but nope.
So, am I done?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> We own you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Marin, it's Naomi Bishop.<eos> Do you understand what's happening here?<eos> Cachet can sue you.<eos> No, they said they would take care of that.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
It's not just lying to my cousin.<eos> We'd be lying to everyone.<eos> But you have to remember what's at stake.<eos> We're talking about tens of thousands of lives, and the future of Scotland itself.<eos> Surely that's worth the price?<eos> Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.
No.<eos> How many times have you had sex, with women or men?<eos> Once before, with a girl.<eos> Only once before?<eos> And you don't remember anything about this second time?<eos> There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't. Okay.
And keep doing it?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> We got another connection.<eos> Friend of yours and my last job before this fucking retirement.<eos> Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
Do you know what I think about a lot?<eos> Your death.<eos> I don't mean with the lethal injection that's probably... what, a good 10 years away.<eos> What I think about is... Killing you with my own hands.<eos> The way you killed my wife with your own hands.<eos> Yeah, Jackson's still alone.<eos> Keep me updated.<eos> Derohan should be there soon to relieve you.<eos> You really think all that money's in there?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Yeah.<eos> Just tell me when you wanna stop.<eos> You know what?<eos> Honestly, Lizzy, I'm done, okay?<eos> Just get in the goddamn car!<eos> - I don't want to!<eos> - I don't care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - Look, I know this is a big night for you. - I don't care!<eos> - Yes, you do!
He didn't mean...<eos> Hey. I went easy on you before.<eos> But now...<eos> You're not gonna pass through the restricted zone on your way home, "bosmain."<eos> We can't go around.<eos> Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.
We're runnin' out of ammo.<eos> James Holden.<eos> Shit just follow you around, don't it kid?<eos> Are you a cop?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Hey, thanks for the assist.<eos> Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here? No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
- I can get you leave.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> Then you can work reduced hours.<eos> Everyone will understand, Mads.<eos> - Hi, Mom!<eos> - Hi, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you buy sushi?<eos> - Of course I did.
So do whatever you're going to do.<eos> Would you be willing to apologize to Mrs. Olsen?<eos> For what?<eos> All right, all right, I'll talk to her.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks. How you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> How's things going, all right?<eos> Yeah. You see the game?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Hey, Lenny, can I grab some napkins?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, now I spilled my beer all over you, my name's Sharon.<eos> Uh, that's okay.<eos> And you are...<eos> Um, Lee.<eos> ♪ Everything's goin' my way ♪ How you doing?<eos> How you doing?
Don't ask me why, but if you want make some other arrangements, you want to find someplace else to bury him, you want to talk to the mortician, and you want to call up Sacred Heart and talk to Father Martin and then find out how much that's going to cost and make all those arrangements, be my guest, otherwise, let's just leave it, okay?<eos> I'm just saying I don't like him being in a freezer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't like it, either, but it isn't him 'cause he's gone. It's just his body.<eos> I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.<eos> Oh, goddammit, where did I park the car?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't have to be so polite, you know.<eos> I'm not being polite.<eos> Did you want to wash your hands before we eat?<eos> Yes.<eos> For what we are about to receive, let us give thanks.<eos> Amen. Amen.<eos> You can say amen, Patrick.<eos> Nobody's trying to recruit you.<eos> I did say amen.<eos> Oh, you did? Okay.
I'll let you know the minute something changes.<eos> You understand what I just said?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> But he didn't do this.<eos> Of course he didn't.<eos> I... will call you.<eos> I told you not to talk to anybody.<eos> I didn't, only to my parents.
But he didn't do this.<eos> Of course he didn't.<eos> I... will call you.<eos> I told you not to talk to anybody.<eos> I didn't, only to my parents.<eos> I said anybody.<eos> While you were talking to them, you know who was listening in, which he can do legally, just not with me and you?<eos> Box.<eos> I... I didn't say anything.<eos> Sure you did.
The failed reanimations are my responsibility and I have to live with that. But you have another responsibility as the key to the project.<eos> You get to decide whether or not humanity will ever have a chance to benefit from it.<eos> Were they part of humanity?<eos> Maybe not to you people.<eos> Maybe they're out-of-date humanity, or second-rate humanity.<eos> You know, I don't believe you.<eos> I don't believe you ever really cared about their pain.<eos> Do you care?<eos> Do you really care about my pain?<eos> Of course, I do!
Oh, shit! What did she do to me?<eos> Come on, you fat fuck! You can do it!<eos> Oh, boy. Your perfect little weekend... Didn't end up so perfect, huh hotshot?<eos> While I'm at it, I should definitely take this.<eos> Oh, please keep crying.<eos> I can't tell you what it does to me. You have deserved this for a long time.<eos> You're totally right, i deserve this.<eos> I deserve this.<eos> I deserve this, please do it.<eos> Please do it. Just do it! Please...
Horn Hill.<eos> My father's-- well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.<eos> They'll take care of you both.<eos> "Wherever you go, I go, too."<eos> That's what you said.<eos> I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.<eos> That's all I want-- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.<eos> Us and everyone else in the world.<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.
They may be dead for all a girl knows.<eos> Tell me about the Hound.<eos> Also dead.<eos> Arya Stark left him to die.<eos> He was on her list.<eos> He was not on her list anymore.<eos> She had taken him off it.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't she want him dead any longer?<eos> She did and she did not.
I am so very sorry. -Why?<eos> -You're not her type.<eos> Now, I must warn you, I work very hard.<eos> I study an hour every day.<eos> Sometimes two.<eos> And my father didn't leave me as much money as everybody thinks, so I couldn't pay you more than a hundred and fifty.<eos> -A month?<eos> -A week.<eos> I'm not destitute.<eos> A few pointers as to how Madam Florence does things.
And it has been for an hour or more.<eos> Sister, this was the kinder way.<eos> We couldn't even tell whether it was male or female.<eos> May the Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> May he make his face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you, and grant you peace.<eos> I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No. I didn't.
Here, let me help you up.<eos> Jamie's looking for me at Hazelmere.<eos> I still don't understand why we're going to Bellmont instead of Hazelmere.<eos> Captain's orders, ma'am, as I said.<eos> Very well, then.<eos> Bellmont it is.<eos> Attention!<eos> Who did you say lives here?<eos> Do I have the honor of addressing the Duke of Sandringham?<eos> You do, indeed.
Huh? What's to stop that evil bastard brother of his sending you into the next world after him?<eos> Murtagh could go with me.<eos> Here, on yer feet, ye lazy swine.<eos> What?<eos> Would ye be so kind as to tell me what the MacKenzie's doing here?<eos> If I knew, I would.<eos> It's good to see some familiar faces.<eos> I was sorry to hear about Angus' death.<eos> I always thought when that wee bastard fell, that you would fall with him.<eos> So did I.
Dominicans?<eos> Cubans?<eos> Puerto Ricans.<eos> Thought that parade was last week.<eos> Who can keep track?<eos> Who do you think this guy was trying to call?<eos> Ghostbusters.<eos> He can laugh. You can't.<eos> Hey, Bailey.<eos> How you doing?
- This is voluntary, right?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - And off the record?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> So why are we doing this in an interrogation room?<eos> You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?<eos> Really?<eos> Maybe at MG's, after a shift.<eos> Still can't believe that place went out of business.<eos> I miss Copeland's.<eos> Who doesn't?
- Yeah.<eos> What number are you calling me from?<eos> A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.<eos> I need to see you.<eos> - Come into the precinct. - No.<eos> No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
All right.<eos> We meant to go to Ecuador.<eos> We got as far as an apartment on top of a restaurant across the road from the radio station.<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> - Oh, no, it's lovely.<eos> That's not what I meant. I...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just... you know.<eos> You know Kim and Kanye?<eos> No. No, I don't.
All those times she brought you a cup of coffee?<eos> She brought everyone a cup of coffee.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Didn't she?<eos> - No. Just you.<eos> And you never once bought her a cup in return.<eos> Hello.<eos> I have a wife.<eos> - Not anymore you don't.
- Good.<eos> Because I don't want...<eos> I don't like her to want me anymore.<eos> Because I don't want her anymore.<eos> As the world waits and worries about our two journalists in Ecuador, the whole station joins me in thinking of Ian Finch,<eos> - whose birthday it is today.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten.<eos> Claire remembered.<eos> She always does.
I'm not going in!<eos> So you might as well give me my phone back right now, please!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come.<eos> They told me not to meet with you.<eos> Who?<eos> The Prime Minister's office. Duby.<eos> I don't want to upset them.<eos> He'll know I was here.<eos> I don't...
I know about Beirut.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> It all ends tonight.<eos> Be a lot easier to do it right away.<eos> You didn't come here for revenge.<eos> You came here because you know it's time to come in.<eos> Your father created the program.<eos> Didn't have what it takes to make it work.<eos> And you did.<eos> You always did.
- No!<eos> - No, we're going out.<eos> Mr. Church wrote me every week.<eos> And always sent me books.<eos> Seasons changed.<eos> Roommates came and went.<eos> Class schedules changed... and I got closer every day towards graduating.<eos> They say, for some, college is the time of your life... where you find yourself.<eos> And for others...<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Where?<eos> The Green Zone.<eos> You look relieved.<eos> I can think of worse places to be going.<eos> All right, big man.<eos> Hold it there.<eos> You behave.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Hi, Will.<eos> How you doing?
You've been absent lately, your paperwork is behind<eos> I know but I'm fine now<eos> - Are you?<eos> Andrew Cohen is a tosser.<eos> I'm a much better doctor than he is.<eos> Look, I'm sorry. But it's not negotiable.<eos> Thanks the vow of confidence, Tim.<eos> Anna, wait.<eos> I take it you know your patient Frank Henderson died last night.<eos> No, I didn't.
I need that medication<eos> I'm sorry, but...<eos> - Look, I'm a doctor. Just give me enough tablets until I get a prescription.<eos> Have you seen your sister today?<eos> Why don't you ask the Ferrells? She one of them now, ain't she?<eos> What about last night?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you see Chloe last night?<eos> Jesus, Adam?<eos> No... I didn't.
They are decent people.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Max said you were talking about Dr. McKenzie.<eos> I asked her. - What?<eos> What did you ask her?<eos> I wanted to know about Gillian.<eos> Why would you ask about that?<eos> You know what happened.<eos> - No. No, I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do!
You saw them?<eos> She had packets in the car.<eos> - I think it was ecstasy.<eos> - How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> She was saving up to leave town.<eos> I think she was selling for someone.<eos> It would help us if you answered the question, Miss Macy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> Doctor.<eos> I didn't.
Why would I?<eos> Were you stalking her?<eos> If this is all coming from Eliza Grayson, - I will fucking...<eos> - What?<eos> What'll you do?<eos> Sack her, 'cause she's a lying bitch.<eos> It's her you should be investigating.<eos> Look, I want to have a talk to your boss.<eos> Don't have a boss.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You think Travis killed Chloe?<eos> Travis left because of me.<eos> Not because he killed somebody.<eos> I know my grief drives people away.<eos> No one can understand the pain.<eos> Renae ...<eos> It's Chloe's funeral today.<eos> Roy should have stood by you, all those years ago, that's the truth of the matter.<eos> He had his faults.<eos> We all do.
- See you.<eos> What is up with Bryce?<eos> Well, there goes my serenity.<eos> - What's happening, Beckett?<eos> - It's Bryce, he's just been so smug all day.<eos> What is that about?<eos> Smug is his default emotion anytime I'm not in the room.<eos> This probably has something to do with last night.<eos> I thought we had fun.<eos> We did! Well, you did.
Hey, Beckett. Let's go grab a drink.<eos> Nah, I think I'll just stay home.<eos> But I'll let my 25 to 35 year-old male friends know you're looking to hang.<eos> Oh, don't be like that.<eos> Even though I was doing research, I wouldn't have asked you if I didn't like you. So, how about that drink?<eos> Well, thank you for that, but you know, to be honest,<eos> I mean, sure, you're okay for someone outside of my age demographic.<eos> No, I know you had an awesome time.<eos> - No, no, I did not.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I can't live out here forever.<eos> It's too much work alone.<eos> Dangerous.<eos> Besides, it ain't what the Heavenly Father wants for us.<eos> Come on now. Have some more of that chicken. Looks real good.<eos> Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out. And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
- You and Kiki seem very different.<eos> - We are. Did you ever have second thoughts about her because of that?<eos> - Not once.<eos> - Well, I just met a girl, and she's very different from me.<eos> - She's an artist... and a grad student.<eos> Loves old movies.<eos> And she doesn't know anything about The Sox.<eos> Anybody can learn about baseball.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
But we're gonna have to call an ambulance.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> I was going to hurt you.<eos> What?<eos> I was going to stab you while you slept.<eos> I went to get the knife and I stood over you.<eos> I was going to cut you.<eos> I wanted to do it.<eos> He told me how good it would feel.<eos> Who did?
But then sales start to level off.<eos> The drive-in model as we learned, - has a few built-in problems.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> For starters, there's the customer issue.<eos> Drive-in's tend to attract, shall we say, a less than desirable clientele.<eos> - Teenagers. - Hot rodders and hooligans.<eos> Juvenile delinquents in blue jeans.<eos> And then there's the service.<eos> It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive.<eos> - And when it finally does...
Sorry, O.J., but that traffic out there is a mother.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Is there a lot of people out there still?<eos> Packed, right?<eos> Is this the cheeseburger?<eos> Kato, you like them burgers, huh?<eos> Oh, I love them.<eos> You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right?<eos> Hmm? Yeah.<eos> You did, huh?
Nicole wasn't a gold digger.<eos> I mean, I-I knew her. She loved him.<eos> Well, they were obsessed with each other.<eos> And she really did love him.<eos> They had hot sex.<eos> Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.<eos> And it absolutely drove him crazy.<eos> You know, when she was at that little house on Gretna Green, he used to hide in the bushes and watch her have sex with other guys.<eos> Did she know that O.J. was out there?<eos> Of course she did!
Would you agree? Oh, certainly.<eos> The matching process is many, many times more accurate than a fingerprint.<eos> "Many, many times more accurate than a fingerprint."<eos> And what were the results of the blood analysis from the Bundy crime scene?<eos> Well, the RFLP pattern from item 47 shows us that...<eos> Oh, let me rephrase.<eos> Other than the two victims, did this incredibly precise DNA matching show anyone else's blood and DNA at the scene of the murders?<eos> It did, uh, just one individual.<eos> And does this same DNA match the blood you found - on the back gate at Bundy?<eos> - Yes, it does.
I was putting Charles to sleep.<eos> I'll come down, but not with you like this.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Tommy.<eos> I thought today was the reason for the way you've been acting lately.<eos> I know there's business on your mind.<eos> And I know there always will be. - Yeah.<eos> - Look.<eos> I am sorry they wore their uniforms.<eos> Yeah, they fucking did, eh?

_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Do not use me for your lies.<eos> - Those men respect you.<eos> They respect me because they know who I am.<eos> - They know I am loyal.<eos> - As do I.
I don't understand.<eos> It's all right. It really is.<eos> It's such a relief to let go of those lies.<eos> What about Loras?<eos> I love my brother.<eos> I will always love my brother.<eos> His soul is pure and perfect.<eos> His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.<eos> He just needs... to atone for them.<eos> We all do.
The Breakline is no place for an Elf.<eos> It's no place for anyone as long as Demons inhabit it.<eos> Diana.<eos> How did you know that I'd be here?<eos> Because when someone tells you no, you tend to do the opposite.<eos> If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
Right after I killed Wil.<eos> The tree said I had to do it to prove I was ready for what's ahead.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do that.<eos> Not as sorry as I am.<eos> The things we've seen since this all started. All the innocent blood that's been spilled.<eos> You know, and what's the point?<eos> Now that I know what my grandfather did in the name of our kind?<eos> Maybe you were right about the Elves.<eos> Maybe we don't deserve saving.<eos> Yeah, maybe none of us do.
I mean, you have to cut the curve, but when I say, "cut it", it means...<eos> - When... - You're not well.<eos> Dammit, I've been thinking about it all morning.<eos> I'll tell you later, I need a hit.<eos> Go get the bike.<eos> What the fuck !<eos> Follow me and we'll try it out.<eos> It's 30 degrees, why do I need the coat ?<eos> Do you trust me ?<eos> No, I don't.
Fred, put the siren on.<eos> Get me to the Port Committee, quick!<eos> Regional Prefect?<eos> I believe the port should be modernized so I'm in favor of the sale.<eos> - Development Minister?<eos> - In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
I'm gathering the Parliament.<eos> I know the German Ambassador, Curt Bräuer.<eos> He is a supporter of Norwegian neutrality.<eos> - And we want to trade?<eos> - The Parliament will discuss this now.<eos> We're staying in the city, at the theatre.<eos> I have other news that might be heavy for you.<eos> Your brother, King Christian, surrendered Denmark at 05:00 this morning.<eos> If it helps, he did not have much choice.<eos> No, he probably didn't.
Right.<eos> You know what we should do? Hmm?<eos> Let's just get a good night's sleep.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> You hear that, that chirping sound?<eos> I did not, no.
About what?<eos> About homecoming.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> Yeah sure, I was.<eos> We can go if you wanted to.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's just a dumb dance.<eos> I do.
So?<eos> I was thinking, you know, I was thinking maybe you could be my second at thunder road.<eos> What do you want me to drive with you?<eos> [ Laughter ] Hey, what you looking at? Not one thing.<eos> Danny is going to be my second at thunder road.<eos> We're going to win this thing!<eos> No, you won't.<eos> What's it to you, Eugene?<eos> Yeah, what do you care who wins?<eos> I don't.
Mary, I want it so that Charles is never left on his own.<eos> Understood?<eos> Sir, I should call a doctor.<eos> There will be some men coming down from Birmingham.<eos> And you put them up here in the house, you put them in the front - and back of the house and you feed them...<eos> - Why are they needed, sir?<eos> I bought a cursed sapphire into this house, Mary.<eos> And now I'm paying for it.<eos> And I don't know what to expect.<eos> But neither do my enemies.
Forgive me.<eos> May God protect you.<eos> Mother, I beseech you, tell me the truth.<eos> What did you do with the child?<eos> - What I had to.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> I entrusted him to God.<eos> - I don't understand!<eos> Don't you believe in Providence?<eos> I do.
So?<eos> Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass - and body fat, of course.<eos> - So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.<eos> Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen.<eos> He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.
Alfred!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Give us a minute, please.<eos> I think we can safely say Azrael has gone rogue.<eos> I'm not comfortable making that assumption just yet.<eos> But it's been more than 24 hours since he's made contact.<eos> Perhaps that's because Jim Gordon still breathes.<eos> But if the police catch him first, how do we explain...<eos> Something that cannot be explained?<eos> We don't.
- Let's not dwell on it.<eos> We should get back to work.<eos> - Or we could fall asleep for five to seven days and see how we feel.<eos> - I will not rest till justice is served.<eos> There's no time to waste. This case is urgent.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> All right, listen. The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> - You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> - I did. I did. I did.
Keep telling me what to do and I'll stab your face off.<eos> - Hell yes!<eos> - Damn!<eos> Like that.<eos> Okay, now, here's the plan.<eos> Instead of you approaching Maura, we're gonna get her to come to you.<eos> Yeah, try and spread the word that you've got a connect on the outside that gives you access to contrabands: cigarettes, burner phones...<eos> Pornography.<eos> Amy, women don't watch...<eos> - They do.
Yeah, but nobody is safe if we get bought out.<eos> Nobody, okay?<eos> Especially me.<eos> I've got zero signings to my name this year.<eos> Every band I approach, they say they don't like my face. - What?<eos> - Is there something wrong with my face?<eos> Just tell me. Just tell me, it's fine.<eos> No, Clark, we just scored the Zeppelin deal.<eos> Richie did.<eos> Richie did, okay?
- Calm down, Buck.<eos> Calm down?<eos> It didn't happen to you.<eos> He didn't fucking do it to you.<eos> All right, all right. So an hour goes by. Then two.<eos> Then I get word this little asshole's in the hospital.<eos> In the fucking hospital.<eos> Not for nothing, but he does have pretty bad asthma.<eos> What's that?<eos> Asthma. They all do.
Which is why I find myself unnerved by the thought that when this pattern applies itself to you and I... that I will be the end of you.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Well, the three who preceded me all had one thing in common.<eos> They were vulnerable to you.<eos> Had more to lose than you, less means with which to protect themselves than you.<eos> Until recently, I thought that was me as well, but now...<eos> I don't know that it is anymore.<eos> It is natural for men new to power to assume that it has no limits.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It does.
I, uh, I love you.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I think that I'm too close to you... to have sex with you.<eos> I know it's confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can... i can help you get over that.<eos> I don't want to get over that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sure, what the hell?<eos> You bring a checkbook with you, mrs. Finestra? Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> There's a 150 charge for this meeting<eos> And sylvia will give you a questionnaire.<eos> You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone That there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> Well, she was mistaken.<eos> What if i hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.
The veiniacs.<eos> No, just veiniacs.<eos> Are they-- what are they like?<eos> If t. Rex and sweet fucked, Had a baby raised by dr.<eos> They're black guys? No.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you not find any?<eos> Black bands?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
Okay, Walter.<eos> I still don't know who some of these people are, Mr. Blunt, but Mr. Birmingham, I'm afraid, does make a very strong argument.<eos> That's right, Walter!<eos> You can't beat me.<eos> But... but I am sorry that I hurt your feelings.<eos> - Let's go, Rosalie.<eos> - Yes, Walter.<eos> Jim?<eos> Do you realize it takes thousands of years to create an aquifer and that more than half of the world's aquifers are in danger?<eos> - No, I didn't. - Yeah.
Of course it hasn't happened before.<eos> You're not a whore.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Anyway, I'm feeling really guilty about the whole thing, but also kind of good.<eos> So don't say anything to anyone, okay?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm very discreet.<eos> Like, you don't know where I live, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Natasha, go and see.<eos> - Don't go. Promise? - Promise.<eos> Champagne?<eos> - Oh, I probably shouldn't...<eos> - Please.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Is there anything you'd like to get off your chest, Mr. Gamby?<eos> I mean, nothing really comes to the mind.<eos> Well, this complaint says, and I quote,<eos> "She's not very smart, and if she's in charge, "this school will suffer in a horrible way.<eos> "Dr. Brown only cares about herself.<eos> "She really thinks she's something."<eos> Now, who would write such a thing?<eos> I don't know. I'm not sure.<eos> Does it say who wrote it?<eos> Why, yes, it does.
Without you, I wouldn't be...<eos> Evan R. Lawson, CFO of HankMed, husband, hospital administrator, and pillar of the community.<eos> Okay, I'm not sure if that toast was to me or to yourself, but, uh, thanks, sidekick.<eos> To Divya.<eos> I know I don't have the history with you that these guys do, but I think we've done a really great job making up for lost time.<eos> Thank you for being such a caring friend and for doing such a good job raising my husband.<eos> To Divya.<eos> Do you remember me on the day we first met?<eos> It was right over there.<eos> Of course I do.
Pleasure.<eos> These are for you.<eos> Richard Roper was recently a guest at the Meisters Hotel.<eos> Do whatever you want with those. I don't want to be involved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
I will call you later, and I will explain everything, all right?<eos> Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you.<eos> Oh, this won't take up much of his time.<eos> Sorry to bother you, sir.<eos> There's a Mr. Thorn here to see you?<eos> Thank you, Arlene.<eos> I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge.<eos> Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in?<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Yes, I do.
You found your niche.<eos> This just seemed like a logical conclusion.<eos> Gay wedding planning.<eos> It's a great job, and you can do it with a criminal record.<eos> My only skill is planning parties. And, for some reason, gay guys specifically, they just respond to me.<eos> It's because you're a great guy.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> And they probably wanna fuck the shit out of you.<eos> Hey, I didn't say it.<eos> You did.
No one is leaving here until I get my shit.<eos> You understand?<eos> You think this is a fucking joke?<eos> - Him.<eos> The other one.<eos> - Get up.<eos> Do you have my shit?<eos> - Do you have my shit? - No.<eos> No. No?<eos> Well, someone does.
But if for any reason you find conversation with me unpleasant, please say so.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm glad to make your acquaintance.<eos> Then let me offer you a brotherly handshake.<eos> You're a Mason?<eos> Yes,<eos> I belong to the brotherhood of Freemasons.<eos> I'm afraid my way of thinking is very different from yours.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Of course you don't.
I will.<eos> Why doesn't he come?<eos> It's been three weeks.<eos> Did he say he would?<eos> No... but he loves me, I am sure of it.<eos> Did he say so?<eos> But how could he look at me as he did and not mean it?<eos> And you?<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
Are you cold?<eos> Not a bit.<eos> Tasha?<eos> No, I'm perfect.<eos> We could live like this, in the country, all the time.<eos> I wish!<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you really?<eos> Of course, I love Andrei.<eos> Of course, I do.
It's really you.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I'm so sorry, forgive me.<eos> For what?<eos> For what I did.<eos> Natasha.<eos> I love you.<eos> You can't love me.<eos> I love you more.<eos> Better than I did before.
Well, I think you should ask her yourself.<eos> I'll go and fetch her.<eos> Dearest Natasha.<eos> I know I've been a clown and wasted my life, but I have to ask you.<eos> Say no, and I'll go to Petersburg, and never bother you again.<eos> But...<eos> Do you think you could love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I could.<eos> Yes, I do.
Besides, we don't have enough for a warrant to get him in here.<eos> Well, we don't really need a warrant. We just need a shot at talking to 250 of Tom Noonan's closest friends.<eos> We're gonna crash a wedding, aren't we, Al?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ooh, look at all this. This must have cost a fortune.<eos> Slightly nicer than the last wedding we went to.<eos> Sarah and Jeb's, August 23, 2001.<eos> It was by a lake, and I remember that you teared up during their vows.<eos> Pollen count was off the charts up there.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Actually, um, well, you know Free City, Laura Parks' charity?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - We understand that Mr. Noonan was incredibly devoted to that charity.<eos> - We also understand that he was... incredibly devoted to Laura Parks.<eos> Did you know the IRS was investigating Free City for misappropriation of funds?<eos> What?<eos> $790,000 missing from the charity's accounts.<eos> I had... I had no idea.<eos> Do you think Noonan knew about that?<eos> - Because Laura did.
You did?<eos> What fractions?<eos> 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.<eos> Hmm. Wow.<eos> You know, I gotta tell ya, you are much smarter than I was when I was your age.<eos> Maybe you needed better teachers.<eos> That could be.<eos> Can I do the drill now?<eos> - You promised.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Yesterday morning was the worst professional humiliation of my life.<eos> A single transpositional error cost my client time and money and permanently damaged my reputation.<eos> But then I realized... it wasn't an error. Not at all.<eos> A week ago last night, I was right there on that couch, barely cononious, and Jimmy showed up.<eos> And he sent Ernesto away.<eos> My brother was gonna take care of me.<eos> And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files.<eos> Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.<eos> She does!<eos> You do... for your own good.
I hurt the client.<eos> Blew it completely and utterly.<eos> And then I blamed...<eos> And then I blamed you.<eos> It's this goddamned electricity!<eos> It's wearing me down!<eos> It's wearing down my faculties!<eos> My brain... my mind... it used to be...<eos> You know, it used to work!<eos> And now it doesn't anymore.
The key is the key. - Aye.<eos> - What key?<eos> The musical key.<eos> Whoever wrote this had a diabolical sense of humor.<eos> Oh, aye, diabolical.<eos> Two flats means you take every second letter, beginning at the start of the section.<eos> Three sharps means you take every third letter, beginning at the end.<eos> Does it make sense?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, it does.
We can bring them with us.<eos> All of them?<eos> What of our tenants?<eos> Leave them to the--the mercy of the British butchers if the Culloden is lost?<eos> - Your name on that document brands you as a traitor to the British.<eos> And you will be hung as one if they catch you.<eos> We can't stay.<eos> We know what will happen if the Jacobites lose the war.<eos> But... but what if they win?<eos> They don't.
My husband and I share everything.<eos> He knows about your offer... and he knows why I was forced to make the decision I did.<eos> And he took no issue with it?<eos> None.<eos> Well, he, uh... He is a better man than I.<eos> Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.<eos> But I don't.
Tell him to come back straightaway to speak with Mr. Anderson.<eos> Here, you say?<eos> Aye.<eos> Or thereabouts.<eos> I don't ken much from maps.<eos> There's no such path marked.<eos> Marked or no, it's there.<eos> As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's a narrow, winding path, hard to spot in daylight, and hopeless to find in the dark.<eos> Unless ye ken where to look.<eos> And you do?
I think you found the right one. Yeah.<eos> Oh, I didn't find them. They found me.<eos> Ah.<eos> And it's all, of course, a part of God's plan.<eos> It's also a part of God's plan that we all get closer to him through fellowship.<eos> Hey, Mac, is God gonna be able to protect against the ship sinking?<eos> God protects all things, Charlie. He is an awesome god.<eos> The only way this ship is gonna sink is if the captain's drunk.<eos> Guys, we don't have to worry about drunk captains, 'cause this is the dry cruise, remember?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Yes.<eos> Maybe there's food in there.<eos> Is there food in there? Uh, no, just... Just this water gun.<eos> That's not a water gun, man, that's a flare gun, which I'll hold onto for safekeeping.<eos> Uh...<eos> Why? Well, because I'm the most responsible person.<eos> Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, one of us does, so... the end.
I just have three things to say.<eos> Uh, one:<eos> Liam McPoyle has a history of lying.<eos> My client is a loving family man.<eos> And three:<eos> He is innocent.<eos> Deandra Reynolds, you were the one that told the police that Bill had spiked the punch with bath salts.<eos> That's correct.<eos> But you didn't actually see him do it, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
You said you would hear him.<eos> I need you to listen.<eos> I understand that you think that Flint is the answer to all of it.<eos> I would like to tell you that I agree if for no other reason than to appease you so you can rest.<eos> But in the state that you're in, the one thing I swear I will not do is lie to you.<eos> I will hear him.<eos> I will look in his eyes while he tells me that he can be trusted to be a partner to us.<eos> But if I for a moment doubt him...<eos> Do you trust me to make this decision?<eos> Of course I do.
Maybe you went too far. Maybe you didn't go far enough.<eos> Maybe you did it just right.<eos> The point is that while you were doing it, you heard a voice telling you that disciplining him would prevent him from repeating the offense,<eos> a voice that sounded like reason, and there was reason to it, as the most compelling lies are comprised almost entirely of the truth.<eos> But that's what it does.<eos> Cloaks itself in whatever it must to move you to action.<eos> And the more you deny its presence, the more powerful it gets, and the more likely it is to consume you entirely without you ever even knowing it was there.<eos> Now, if you and I are to lead these men together, you must learn to know its presence well so that you may use it... Rather than it use you.<eos> You have some experience with this, I imagine, living in fear of such a thing within you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I used a tire iron to render Kernie and my partner unconscious.<eos> There were only the three of us on the bridge that night.<eos> Arthur, zoom in on Mary.<eos> I don't know what face that is.<eos> I believe those features represent longing.<eos> I stand here accused of corruption, witness intimidation, brutality.<eos> I confess to doing my job.<eos> I confess to keeping this town's peace.<eos> Do you know who you are?<eos> Yeah, Miss Goodwin, I sure do.
Look, we went a few rounds, but I know you're not a murderer.<eos> I never thought you were guilty.<eos> Have you told our daughter that?<eos> She should also know that I'm innocent of this, that I've changed.<eos> I'd like to tell her that myself.<eos> Look, I'll think about it. What's good for you could be really hard for her.<eos> Why didn't you have your defense team contact the police?<eos> I don't trust lawyers, and I don't trust the police.<eos> I only trust you.<eos> Or at least I did once.
I'd like to tell her that myself.<eos> Look, I'll think about it. What's good for you could be really hard for her.<eos> Why didn't you have your defense team contact the police?<eos> I don't trust lawyers, and I don't trust the police.<eos> I only trust you.<eos> Or at least I did once.<eos> I'm hoping I can still do that.<eos> So the abusive ex-boyfriend we framed for murder calls you for a visit and you decide that is a good idea?<eos> Look, his hearing's coming up, and Nava doesn't even know his defense yet.<eos> Now I do.
The nurse said he's gonna be in surgery for four hours, then he's gonna be sedated in the ICU for who knows how long.<eos> Did you mean it?<eos> What you just said... about letting Sap speak for himself when he wakes up?<eos> To us, not the FBI.<eos> I authorized you to pick up Detective Saperstein, not drop him.<eos> We both know who dropped him.<eos> This is your chance to convince me you have a plan.<eos> We reinforce what Wozniak already believes... that he found his mole.<eos> You assured me that Wozniak had no way of verifying that we had an informant.<eos> He didn't.
Every woman should have access to tampons, all different sizes.<eos> And the only reason it's not that way is because the government hates women.<eos> This is true.<eos> Elbows in, sir.<eos> Here's a reunion story.<eos> Tell them your Beyoncé's fourth-weekend nanny and that she loves you.<eos> I don't speak French.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Um... Do you guys have any tampons I could...<eos> So sorry, no, we don't.
You squeaked by in Iowa.<eos> You're not gonna close the gap in New Hampshire by Tuesday.<eos> -You're overconfident.<eos> -And you're still Press Secretary.<eos> He didn't make you Chief of Staff.<eos> Don't tell me you weren't angling for it.<eos> What's your ask?<eos> One solid thing for us to work with.<eos> It tanks him, you got a cushion.<eos> It doesn't?
This is Hap and Leonard.<eos> They're with us.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. I ain't giving my share to no whales.<eos> I read "Moby Dick." I was rooting for Ahab.<eos> This is Chub.<eos> My real name's Charles.<eos> Everybody calls me Chub, you know, 'cause I'm fat.<eos> I didn't know Trudy had any African-American friends.<eos> She don't.
- Okay, but she was interested, right?<eos> 'Cause she was nodding along. She kept going, "Mm-hmm."<eos> - Those were vocal cord spasms cause by pre-death rigor mortis.<eos> She was trying to cry out, but, alas, she was too far gone to scream.<eos> - I was--I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't know.<eos> - Know what? Don't blame yourself.<eos> Just stop.<eos> - I thought I was being pretty interesting.<eos> - So did I.
- I know that...<eos> - Just remember!<eos> If you marry her I'm looking for my 10%.<eos> Okay, it's a deal.<eos> I don't want to ask you who you're in love with, I guess it must be a ravishing movie star.<eos> No, she's not a movie star.<eos> I'm not shallow. I'm not seduced by cheap glamor. I value substance and character.<eos> What the hell do you think I am?<eos> I wasn't implying anything like that, I thought it might be Hedy Lamarr, I know how much she adores you.<eos> Like all your clients do.
Tell me, David.<eos> Tell me about the dining room.<eos> Was there morning assemblies?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> One of my colleagues was the arresting officer who put Jensen and several others in prison.<eos> And they did forensic tests there, and they found the carpet in that room covered in semen stains.<eos> David?<eos> Is that something that happened to you?<eos> Did you have to masturbate in front of other boys, staff?<eos> - Everyone did.
What?<eos> It's cute. It means they like you. You're one of the gang.<eos> Well, most of them won't even make eye contact with me.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> That's a sign of respect.<eos> At least it is with gorillas.<eos> Not helping.<eos> I think that somebody needs one of my special stories.<eos> I don't, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I know a vote you can get. Ma, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to make you the deal of a lifetime, son.<eos> I'm gonna let you acquire my company.<eos> And what's in it for me?<eos> Hakeem Lyon, who as partner of Lyon Dynasty is still under contract with us.<eos> He still belongs to me.<eos> - 20 million.<eos> Never.<eos> Well, then you can't have Hakeem, bitch.<eos> I already did.
I was so looking forward to meeting him.<eos> Here, honey. Thanks.<eos> And I just feel so incredibly guilty.<eos> Like I let Andre down.<eos> You know, all that heir to the empire stuff.<eos> And now there is none. No, no, no, no.<eos> Honey, there'll be another heir.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Why was Alvarez convicted?<eos> His DNA on her body.<eos> A subsequent confession.<eos> That's pretty conclusive.<eos> What year is this?<eos> August 2002.<eos> In London.<eos> Now, there's a gap in Spector's time-line.<eos> We don't know where he was or what he was doing.<eos> No, we don't.
- Yeah. Take this t-shirt gun and make yourself useful.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> Go for Baskets.<eos> Chip?<eos> Hi, darling, how are you?<eos> Don't call me that, okay?<eos> Look, I need $40 for HBO.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you get that job?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm Arrash.<eos> Arrash Sayyad.<eos> Stefan Kowolski.<eos> So why were you there?<eos> I can't tell you that, either.<eos> Then it looks like we don't have much to talk about.<eos> You're right.<eos> We don't.
- Archer?<eos> - Aka Trunkmaster Flex. - Meh.<eos> - Oh, whatever.<eos> And what happened?<eos> How'd you screw up a simple handoff?<eos> Wha...<eos> He didn't bring the money.<eos> Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?<eos> I didn't bring it, because... because I don't have it.<eos> - Wha... Well, who does?
Sorry. I've been giving that some thought,<eos> - and if I were you...<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Desk drawer.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I hope you're not on septic. Ugh!<eos> Have you no decency, man?<eos> We said only number ones, Krieger!<eos> - I never agreed to that.<eos> - Yes, you absolutely did!
Take the bet.<eos> Double it.<eos> Is this mirror not working or...<eos> Don't be shitty.<eos> I'm in progress.<eos> And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.<eos> Spanish Fly.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.
No, yeah, no...<eos> I...<eos> You know, I...<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Why?<eos> And more importantly, how?<eos> Okay, that's...<eos> Oh, come on. Stop it.<eos> That's just about enough of...<eos> What... Well, that does it, missy!
But let me ask you this.<eos> Do you think there's anything about Archer that women would find to be a turnoff?<eos> [laughs] Oh, you're serious.<eos> Well, then, shit.<eos> Umm... And there is a bit of a clock on this, so...<eos> - Why?<eos> Uh-huh. And since apparently Archer's penis is like a crack pipe...<eos> What, in size and/or shape?<eos> They said if he has sex with Veronica, she'll fall head over heels for him.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
I sit there every day. I watch you fight for me.<eos> I think, "Why is she doing this?"<eos> I mean, it's not for the money 'cause you're not getting paid,<eos> I'm sure, at least not much.<eos> It's my job.<eos> And it's your right.<eos> Is that all?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My dad's the only person in the world who believes me.<eos> Your mother does too.
If you did, I'd know.<eos> There are no secrets from me within this hall.<eos> Beowulf.<eos> This hall will always be your home, Beowulf.<eos> Slean is your half-brother.<eos> You're all my blood.<eos> My son.<eos> Nobody else knows.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> Never did.
How's Job?<eos> They did a real number on him.<eos> - He'll be okay.<eos> - How about you?<eos> I really need to get the fuck out of here.<eos> Hello, Ted.<eos> - Innocent and Brock knows it.<eos> Well, the evidence says otherwise and the sheriff has to follow up.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I did.
Did you know that Proctor was in the drug business<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> There are neo-Nazis crawling all over his warehouse.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I'm looking at them right now.<eos> Kurt, did you know?<eos> If I knew, I would have said something to you.<eos> Look, we need to take a step back and figure things out.<eos> This changes things.<eos> Not for me, it doesn't.
I know that's how it looks to you, but I promise this - is what's best for us.<eos> - No, this is what's best for you.<eos> And that's all you've ever really cared about.<eos> I wish you'd stop treating me like a child.<eos> I will when you stop acting like one.<eos> When you were my age, you were already running things.<eos> There was no one holding you back.<eos> There was no one protecting me either.<eos> - I don't need your protection!<eos> - Yes, you do!
Okay, well, I'm going to teach you.<eos> I didn't always look like this, you know.<eos> I used to be a dancer.<eos> Wow. - Dude, you were hot.<eos> - I'm still hot.<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> One day, you're going to have a moment like this with someone else, sharing your experience.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> And it does work.
You bought it for us, remember?<eos> It was part of the series like eight years ago.<eos> It's great, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, my God, it's so cool.<eos> It's this app that lets me watch Willow while she's in her crib.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you not trust your nanny?<eos> No, no, I do.
Yay! - Aw, that was the best news ever!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Congratulations!<eos> - Whoo!<eos> Cheers!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hi!<eos> How's it going?<eos> My God!<eos> - How you doing?
- Yeah, or maybe even a relationship?<eos> - Very possibly.<eos> I don't...<eos> God, I don't...<eos> I don't want to sound like some kind of...<eos> One of those, I don't know, gross, coupled-up,<eos> - relationship evangelist things...<eos> - And yet...<eos> But you liked being with Lynn.<eos> Yes, of course I did.
I could've.<eos> When I said I wanted to be monogamous with you, I meant it.<eos> I didn't want you to make a promise you couldn't keep.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> How'd you know I wouldn't keep it?<eos> Anyway, that's not why we broke up. - We just weren't right for each other.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just did. I...<eos> - I do.
But, are you married?<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> "Raise your eyes and pay attention to that side, Vivanco, and look if you sight understands that a white cloth hangs from a long reed.<eos> Or is it my wife the slut.<eos> You say well, and it is tied.<eos> I want to get there myself to see this feat.<eos> By God, that the reed raises.<eos> Look that the slut will bring it down.<eos> - Don't make the text up.<eos> - I don't.
I need to atone for this.<eos> I would never, ever have said that if I knew it would stick.<eos> Really, it's fine.<eos> And I didn't even care, like, at all, because it was you.<eos> What... what?<eos> I had, like, a huge crush on you in high school.<eos> You knew that.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, whoops. No, I didn't.
But I'd rather take care of you than give my money to the bar. So go light, yeah?<eos> Cosmo, please.<eos> All you girls wear this?<eos> Yeah, it's pussy dust. Sorry.<eos> Say again?<eos> It's pussy dust.<eos> Pussy dust.<eos> We get a private room, I'll show you my pussy dust.<eos> You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?
Yeah, it's pussy dust. Sorry.<eos> Say again?<eos> It's pussy dust.<eos> Pussy dust.<eos> We get a private room, I'll show you my pussy dust.<eos> You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> To happy endings.<eos> I love happy endings.<eos> Who doesn't?
Any idea where she might be?<eos> She said she was moving to Las Vegas.<eos> I gave her the books.<eos> I thought they might be of some solace, remind her of home.<eos> That was, I don't know, two years ago.<eos> Haven't heard from her since?<eos> She called me a few months ago, in fact.<eos> Said that she was engaged to be married.<eos> She say to who?<eos> She did not.
I'll be back in time to take you guys for lunch.<eos> Maybe we can stop at the beach on the way to the airport.<eos> Maddie'd like that.<eos> I moved back to L.A. a few years ago after my husband passed.<eos> I was born here. I wanted to die here.<eos> I had no idea you'd grown up to be a detective till I saw your name in the paper... yours and Marjorie's.<eos> That case had nothing to do with my mother.<eos> It was just a lawyer dragging her name through the mud, trying to get to me.<eos> You said you know who killed her.<eos> Yes, I do.
Maybe I'll have something.<eos> Anything on the ammo I should know?<eos> Well, we could pretty much match each weapon to the casings by caliber and location.<eos> Everyone on Nash's crew was shooting reloads.<eos> - All four weapons?<eos> - Correct.<eos> Nash is a firearms dealer.<eos> Makes sense he might recycle his brass.<eos> Did you find a reloader at his house?<eos> No, we did not.
Mrs. Parikh?<eos> Please, wait. Stop.<eos> Look.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> I thought we could sway you with the power of dance.<eos> You really think a dance is all it takes?<eos> Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.<eos> Or what I imagined.<eos> I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.<eos> None of us did.
I told him deodorant is fin-- He doesn't need cologne.<eos> He doesn't even shave.<eos> I know.<eos> Let's get dessert someplace else.<eos> Not now.<eos> You sure?<eos> If we don't go now, he'll get too far away.<eos> So, you did or you didn't see something?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Well, you either did or you didn't, Philip.
Clark?<eos> They know.<eos> They know that he's dead.<eos> Gene is...<eos> Everybody's shocked and...<eos> And running around like crazy.<eos> You're safe.<eos> We're together.<eos> Did he know?<eos> Gene, did he...
Who's Negan?<eos> ♪ Ding, dong ♪<eos> ♪ Hell's bells. ♪<eos> You see, usually we introduce ourselves by just popping one of you right off the bat.<eos> But you seem like reasonable people.<eos> I mean, you're sportin' dress blues, for Christ's sake.<eos> And, like I said, we're gonna drive you back to where you were.<eos> I mean, do you know how awkward it is carpooling with someone whose friend or friends you've just killed?<eos> Oof. But I told you not to ask any questions.<eos> And then what does this ginger do?
Boys, follow me.<eos> We'll meet you at the door.<eos> Some kind of adventure you're having, huh?<eos> I don't want an adventure.<eos> So, is Elliot loving school?<eos> Oh, well, so far so good.<eos> We'll see how it goes.<eos> I bet you cried your eyes out with your only one going off to college. -Well...<eos> -She did.<eos> You did.
Well, I'm sorry, your honor, what with the lack of intake since-- -Ms. Fisher.<eos> -Your honor, as you know, we have just received these materials- they're nonsense, your honor.<eos> -No, they are not nonsense,<eos> Ms. Diaz, and I'm reluctant to return children to a parent who's using drugs.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no,<eos> -and of course I'm-- -hold on, Ms. Diaz, this is a conversation you should be having with your attorney in private. Your honor, if I can just have<eos> -a second with my client.<eos> -I trust you understand how many cases we have backed up today.<eos> I do, I do.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Arigato gozaimasu.<eos> - Arigato gozaimasu.<eos> Honestly, I think you're overreacting.<eos> - (Hannah) No, you don't.
- Were you mugged?<eos> - Yes. By God.<eos> But I took his wallet instead.<eos> Mr. Finestra, you are bleeding.<eos> We're all bleeding on the inside.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Terrific.<eos> We got the contracts right here.<eos> - You hear what I just said?<eos> - I did. I did.
- Griffith?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, if Barney Fife isn't available.<eos> You know, this whole show is Andy's idea.<eos> Which explains why they're the musical equivalent of a soup can.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> They're not for everybody.<eos> You just do your thing, baby.<eos> Where'd you say you were from?<eos> I didn't.
Aafrin cannot be blamed, since in those days, he was not among us. I told you.<eos> Such courage she has(!<eos> Leave her be.<eos> But Sergeant Singh had his fellow at the checkpoint look for your description, Kaira.<eos> Not only that, he said look out for a companion.<eos> The Parsi. In his British suit. Aafrin!<eos> Aafrin...<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> She did nothing!
Robert.<eos> Robert.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Hello?<eos> Robert?<eos> What if I had been in here shitting?<eos> You never take a... you never do that in the morning.<eos> I said what if.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Do we?
Robert.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Hello?<eos> Robert?<eos> What if I had been in here shitting?<eos> You never take a... you never do that in the morning.<eos> I said what if.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Do we?<eos> - We do.
- Yeah.<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> I mean, you know, it needs to be fixed up a little bit, but...<eos> I don't know, Frances. Really?<eos> With everything that's going on, you really think that this is the time to open a store?<eos> It's not a store. It's an art gallery.<eos> Whatever it is, I think you should hold off for a few months because there are more important things that we should be thinking about.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I think we're wasting our time with counseling.<eos> - So do I.
Hello.<eos> Dr., uh, Sarkisian? Yes.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> I'm... it's fine.<eos> I really have no gag reflex.<eos> Okay.<eos> Open.<eos> What did you try to do?<eos> Crack a walnut?<eos> Your wife did some damage here.
Right here.<eos> Easy pumping that nitro into him.<eos> Fill the empties with tequila and seal them up.<eos> Your work for the revolution is not quite done yet, my friend.<eos> Careful.<eos> Slim always had a bad temper.<eos> William, we have to go now.<eos> Lazo's been conning us the whole time.<eos> He was never gonna give the nitro to the Confederados. We have to run.<eos> Of course we do.
I think you're gonna want to hear this, unless, of course, you don't want to go solo.<eos> Conner!<eos> Seth is calling.<eos> You gonna pick it up?<eos> No.<eos> No? You have 11 missed calls.<eos> You have to fuckin' talk to him.<eos> Do I, Clyde?<eos> Yes, you do, Jeannie.<eos> Yes, you do.
I serve that up to the Kohls, they'll lift me up on my back and parade me through the streets!<eos> Viva la Galweather, baby!<eos> Monica already brought us Cuba this morning, slowpoke.<eos> Oh, shit, did I yank away that football again?<eos> She's actually got a very smart plan, centering around resort development.<eos> Once they have established a toehold in Cuba, the Kohl brothers can spread their many tentacles into other arenas.<eos> Agriculture, energy, polymers and paper.<eos> We'll look at the file trajectory, determine the extent of the malware compromise.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> - Hey, guys. How you doing?
Can you tell us what happened, Miss Prasad?<eos> I heard a knock at the door.<eos> I turned around and there he was.<eos> Lord Hawthorne?<eos> Yes.<eos> And then what?<eos> He came in.<eos> You invited him in?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You did?
We'll get you home, as soon as you're strong enough.<eos> Will you show me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You ready, Sir?<eos> Don't upset yourself.<eos> How could anyone do this?<eos> Well, Sir, she claims that she was trying to fend off your advances.<eos> What?<eos> She was trying to fight you off, that's what she claims.<eos> Miss Prasad does? - Yes.
That was jolly.<eos> Keep a hold of yourself.<eos> You see what he's doing?<eos> He's teaching my son to hate me.<eos> Give me another day or two, for God's sake.<eos> Yes, then a day becomes a week.<eos> Wasting my breath, aren't I?<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You don't have the strength.<eos> - Lucky for you, I do.
I have to leave them something to live on, you understand?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Look.<eos> - Where did you get all this?<eos> - Doesn't matter, don't ask.<eos> It should be enough for our passage. - All right.<eos> - I still can't believe we're finally going to do this.<eos> Madam? Coo-ee!<eos> Somebody overdo it on Cynthia's punch last night?<eos> Yes, somebody did.
Practise, practise, Auntie.<eos> Practise, practise!<eos> So, what about all your little hobbies, Sooni?<eos> Er, well, my sister used to play piano.<eos> And what about you, honey?<eos> Sooni's a very fine artist. What?<eos> In fact, I just happen to have, by chance, one or two things... here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> And how did you learn to draw like this, Sooni?<eos> I didn't.
She's made her sacrifice. Who knows? She might even enjoy it.<eos> Old Manu, he's like a bear with a honeypot.<eos> You know, it was your sister he really wanted.<eos> So I gather.<eos> You see, this is how I like them, like this.<eos> What, when they're asleep?<eos> No, no, I meant when they're peaceful!<eos> You never wanted children of your own?<eos> Yeah, I wanted them.<eos> What wife doesn't?
Stein's going down for Freeman and Williams, you know why?<eos> Because the good guys always win?<eos> I know you're being sarcastic, and I'm okay with it.<eos> Even your hard-boiled cynicism can't bring me down today.<eos> Go team!<eos> - Come on in, Greg.<eos> - We're not going to the police.<eos> Greg...<eos> Did you actually see her shoot him?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
Now we just have to hope it really is over.<eos> What's wrong now? !<eos> Nothing.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> No.<eos> It's just that... I just had such weird thoughts.<eos> What thoughts?<eos> Stupid things.<eos> Do you trust me, Mum?<eos> Of course I do.
Belinda, that's enough.<eos> Mother, I went to look for Frank.<eos> At the hotel?<eos> That death house is no place for a child.<eos> I'm not a child anymore!<eos> You are forbidden to go there!<eos> Go where?<eos> She's been to the hospital, looking for Frank Stringfellow.<eos> Did you find him?<eos> No, sir, I didn't.
You know, everything.<eos> Your friend, your... your dad.<eos> You know, you've been through a lot, Marcus.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You know, my mama died when I was about your age, so I know how tough it can be.<eos> How'd she die?<eos> Cancer.<eos> - Did you cry?<eos> Do you still miss her?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I do.
You see, you and Solomon there are cut from a different cloth than these other mooks.<eos> That's why I wanted you guys on this.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let me ask you something, Conway. You believe what we're fighting for is a worthy cause?<eos> Depends on what you think we're fighting for, Captain.<eos> Well, what do you believe that is?<eos> Prevent the spread of Communism.<eos> Right, well, we secure this gook stockpile in Quan Thang, we secure the lives and safety of hundreds of Marines, maybe thousands.<eos> Now, you believe that's worth something fighting for?<eos> Yes, sir, Captain, I do.
Bully for me.<eos> Matron, I noted, as did Dr. foster in his inimitably collegial way, that the morning meals were late and sparse.<eos> I wonder if it would not be too forward of me to offer my perspective on the dietary need.<eos> The steward, Mr. bullen, does as he deems fit, given the challenges and supplies at hand.<eos> I understand.<eos> You've got god and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss. Yes, I do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
It's too tight.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Go back.<eos> Go back. Go.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> You can't die. I can.<eos> Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic doesn't exist.<eos> Of course it does.
Maria, I think you should stop being Avery's friend.<eos> It's not that big of a deal.<eos> It's the biggest deal ever!<eos> You can't just touch your best friend's crayons and expect everything to be okay!<eos> Ms. Feldman, you know that health history form you filled out during your annual physical?<eos> Did you mean to check every box yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> You can't have every condition on that form.<eos> I do.
None of us could believe you checked that one.<eos> Oh, it's stuff like that that makes me paranoid.<eos> And you frequently experience emotional instability, hallucinations, delusions of grandeur?<eos> On my period, yes!<eos> Why did you check that you have suicidal thoughts?<eos> Because I have a lot of opinions about suicide.<eos> Now that I'm hearing that question aloud...<eos> Well, thanks to your answers, the school district is sending a psychologist to evaluate your classroom performance.<eos> Oh, I do not think that is necessary.<eos> The district does.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> What does this story have to do with me?<eos> Have you talked to Bennigan?<eos> What is going on with you two? I don't know.<eos> She's avoiding me.<eos> It sucks not having my little Christian with me all day.<eos> I miss our talks about "Teen Mom" where we guess which one will be the first to get their kid taken away.<eos> But I, like, don't really miss her or anything.<eos> Of course you do.
Who said anything about strippers?<eos> I did and I say they're fine.<eos> Get some ones, some fives, put a few girls through college, everybody wins.<eos> Just stay away from the seedy dives, yeah.<eos> The seedy dives?<eos> You know, the ones where the girls don't really want to be there.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Eva, no, I'm not into that kind of stuff.<eos> - You know me.<eos> - I do.
You don't know, either.<eos> We're going this way, Mac, okay?<eos> So I can get a signal on my phone and I can call the police.<eos> So I can tell them that two of my friends are dead.<eos> We don't know if that one guy is actually dead.<eos> "One guy"?<eos> His name is Rand, man.<eos> Rand.<eos> He's been my best friend for, like, 15 years and you don't even know his name.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- So that's really it, huh?<eos> - Yes. That's all of it?<eos> Just some failed knight in shining armor bit?<eos> Yes, I swear...<eos> I swear to God, that's it.<eos> That's it, yes.<eos> Well, that does make things easier. No.<eos> God. Please, wait. Wait.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Please, don't.
I'm going to New York one day.<eos> And to London, Tokyo, Paris.<eos> What?<eos> People will write books go to those places, right?<eos> Martin's sure gonna miss you, Vera.<eos> - Shut your face, Gitty!<eos> - Martin, watch your mouth.<eos> Martin, this chicken's delicious.<eos> - Where'd you buy it?<eos> - I didn't.
I'll give you a discount as Ramba Ral's friend.<eos> How about $3,000 total?<eos> No more, no less.<eos> That's still expensive.<eos> You can pay me in installments.<eos> A little bit at a time.<eos> For Ramba Ral.<eos> Do you like chocolates?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
Except the blood evidence isn't.<eos> In the old crime scenes the blood was pooled.<eos> Too much spatter here.<eos> St. Valentine was surgical.<eos> New killer is no expert with the knife.<eos> There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
Okay. You want to invite her over Sunday night?<eos> No.<eos> Is everything okay with you two?<eos> I never should have gone to that school.<eos> Leyland?<eos> It's a good school.<eos> It's gonna help you get into college.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Evy?<eos> I don't want to go back to that place.<eos> I don't.
Rotten carcass... over the line.<eos> We're lucky the S.E.C. hasn't come calling already.<eos> You're done.<eos> Fired.<eos> Clear out.<eos> Leave your key cards.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> I didn't do anything out-of-bounds... No more than anyone else.<eos> Did I sign off on that trade?<eos> No, I did not.
He's a widely respected source with connections...<eos> He's a fucking rent-a-quote.<eos> I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.<eos> If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?<eos> 'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.<eos> What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
- You'll handle everything here?<eos> Thanks, darling<eos> This Geirmundur Jónsson has nothing to do with the ferry<eos> Which means we have nothing to do with the murder<eos> They'll be forced to let us go<eos> We're not leaving until we know where the cargo is<eos> We're obliged to gather the people together so we can depart We must be ready when the pack ice disperses<eos> If you make that call, I'll make a call of my own<eos> Did you buy a phone at the petrol station recently?<eos> Yes, I did
Y'all know I love you, right?<eos> You know.<eos> And I'm-a do whatever I can... to save my family.<eos> But me and your daddy...<eos> I can't do this. Get your hands off me!<eos> Ma.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Anika Calhoun, do you take Lucious Lyon to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
They don't exist.<eos> Ah, you can't be too careful these days.<eos> Like I said, they're after me, not you.<eos> Just give me the docs, and I'll be on my way.<eos> I figure whoever is running those black ops must have considerable resources.<eos> And before I broke their last phone, it rang.<eos> There was a message and an offer.<eos> And since you have already compromised my place of business, I thought I might take the better deal.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do, but you don't.
-How many know about the smuggling?<eos> -A few, but they'll keep quiet. So just keep the project afloat.<eos> We'll have to try to sort this out.<eos> -Of course.<eos> -Okay?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> -You have a nice house.<eos> -Thank you. -Expensive?<eos> Do you know what it's like to grow up in a home where everyone makes it?<eos> -No, I don't actually. -No...
I'm surprised by who she chose to do it with.<eos> -You travel too much.<eos> -She knew that when we got together.<eos> -She's alone a lot.<eos> -I'm the one who's gone.<eos> I miss her and Rikard, but that doesn't make me do stupid things.<eos> -It's not the same.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -You don't need to refuel.<eos> -I don't?
One thing at a time.<eos> Why did you go home with Hektor?<eos> The restaurant closed, and I said I'd join him for a drink.<eos> -Why?<eos> -We were talking.<eos> It was nice.<eos> -How nice?<eos> -Stop it.<eos> So I can't ask why you spent the night with another man?<eos> I didn't, Erling.
Riiser, you'll stay.<eos> The Ministry has sent us to war, but are turning their backs on us.<eos> I'll be blunt: Are you with us or against us?<eos> -With you.<eos> -Good.<eos> What do we do?<eos> The Defence Minister and the reporter will be on the news tonight.<eos> -They want you to send a soldier.<eos> -We didn't know.<eos> -You do now.
Excuse me.<eos> Is this the New York Employment Center?<eos> I'm only finding day labor work.<eos> I need something permanent.<eos> We have just the thing for you.<eos> So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
Oh, yeah, they've been here since I was a kid.<eos> They're always accusing Daddy of something.<eos> You know they're actually taking us to trial next month?<eos> There I go with all the tequila talk.<eos> You want another drink?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sounds like the protestors have been out to get her father for years.<eos> Think they're about ready to make good on their threat to put him down?<eos> I'm more inclined to think that someone in the Turner family wants to make sure that this wedding doesn't happen.<eos> Because if it does,
Samaritan isn't just watching everything we do now. It's monitoring everything we've ever done.<eos> You said this morning we were just surviving.<eos> By then my fate had been sealed.<eos> But not yours.<eos> I would hate for my mistake to mean punishment for the rest of you.<eos> And please tell Ms. Shaw this is not her cross to bear.<eos> This lapdog has the same card.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> You want to tell me how this all-seeing eye thing doesn't see us coming?<eos> It does.
We're good.<eos> Our supervisor will be right with you.<eos> That was Harry.<eos> I gathered.<eos> He think I'm the reason his cover's blown?<eos> He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
Got yourself a pretty girlfriend. Why would someone like you want to kill the president of the United States? What?<eos> I don't want to kill anyone.<eos> You got this all wrong.<eos> My friend caught you running out of the party.<eos> - Seem suspicious?<eos> - A bomb went off.<eos> I think running was the appropriate reaction.<eos> How long have you known Logan Pierce?<eos> The Friendczar guy?<eos> I don't.
There's someone I think you're gonna want to talk to.<eos> So your shield checks out.<eos> Doesn't explain why you're running an off-the-books operation outside of your jurisdiction.<eos> Maybe your chief can explain.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Agent Wickham, Homeland Security.<eos> Detective Fusco here's been working with us to infiltrate this domestic terrorist ring.<eos> Homeland Security running a joint operation with NYPD?<eos> - How do you explain that one?<eos> - I don't.
A print shop then I meet this guy, who lost his passport, he couldn't afford a new one, so I helped him out.<eos> Let him stay with me for a while.<eos> After a week living with me, I find out the police are looking for him, because he beat up his boyfriend.<eos> - Hey, Bart.<eos> - Sorry...<eos> - What's my problem?<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> You asked me did I know what my problem is, then you... told the story and I don't know what does it have to do with me?<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
Sit here.<eos> You know that I love you?<eos> -Yes. And I you.<eos> -I am terribly sorry.<eos> -For what?<eos> -Because we never talked about it.<eos> -About what? I do not understand.<eos> -You know.<eos> -No, I do not.<eos> Yes you do.
You hesitated, because you couldn't remember.<eos> I thought I'd ruined it.<eos> I don't know how many I've killed.<eos> Or assisted in killing.<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> What you saw in that video, that is my job.<eos> I have called in air strikes, bombed villages, I've...<eos> Thrown grenades into houses.<eos> How does that feel?<eos> It doesn't.
And she asked me who I was about to lose.<eos> And I told her.<eos> And she looked at me and she said,<eos> "Just be sure to notice<eos> "the collateral beauty."<eos> I mean, she... She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
-You experienced it as a choice? -Yeah.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> You called it a near-death experience? -Yeah.<eos> -So you had one?<eos> Uh, here, ketchup at midnight, mustard at four o'clock, mayo at eight o'clock.<eos> Good stuff, okay?<eos> Did I have an NDE?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't, but I, uh...
And when I began working exclusively with near death experience survivors, the work took off.<eos> They have an almost limitless potential for being revived.<eos> Now, whether that's...<eos> He was killing us.<eos> Over and over and over again.<eos> What was Hap recording?<eos> What did it mean?<eos> He was recording the soundscapes of our NDEs, trying to map out what it was that people call "the other side."<eos> Yeah, I... I put that part together.<eos> Bullshit you did.
- Well, um, um... Could we just go into the office and talk about this?<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> We had a 10:00 appointment, remember?<eos> You said you'd fit us in.<eos> - It's an emergency. - So sorry.<eos> - Lorna left me.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she, she walked out, left a note and, and I'm so upset!<eos> Well, we're gonna break up too unless there's a major change.<eos> But my wife already did.
I decide when I tell my parents or Levi, or you.<eos> Me, not you.<eos> Have you told Levi or your parents?<eos> Yes?<eos> What the fuck, dude?<eos> You're taking this way out of proportion.<eos> I think this shows that I care about you the most.<eos> I was the most worried to tell you.<eos> Does that not mean anything to you?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I'm the foreman here I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sir, don't hit him.<eos> Don't hit anyone.<eos> The duty logbook, sir!<eos> What is his name?<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Ma Yuan.<eos> He signed in this morning.<eos> So did everyone else.
That's great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Parker Hershorn is, uh... Does that name ring a bell to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> But what the hell does it matter?<eos> I mean, really, Ethan, what is your angle here?<eos> That Gary finished up his spreadsheets and then they sent him over here to blow me away?<eos> You done?
Well, Mr. Parker, aka Fran, aka my boyfriend, didn't like how I was correcting your poem, so he decided to take it into his own damn hands.<eos> Okay, "Mail."<eos> Her name is Maile. "Miley."<eos> Hannah was not correcting the grammar and I thought it was important for you to learn proper English.<eos> Listen, Fran, proper English is a joke.<eos> In 10 years, we're all gonna be robots who speak Chinese, okay?<eos> So why don't you apologize for what you did to this piece of paper?<eos> I didn't rip it.<eos> I may have written some stuff on there, but the rips were all her.<eos> - She did the rips.

I, um...<eos> I was supposed to... my dad by the time he was my age, he had a master's degree and, like, five medals from the Navy.<eos> And I get coffee.<eos> You do more than that, Clark.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Well,it lookedmorelike her six hours ago when we started.<eos> But she's pretty much over now.<eos> Beautiful, huh, huh?<eos> Look at this.<eos> Huh? You're a genius. You're a genius for this kind of thing.<eos> Somebody hands you an idea and you execute like nobody's business.<eos> Yeah, that's right. - That's right.<eos> Look.<eos> I wish I had a family like this.<eos> You do.
I don't... what do I care what Chairman Mao says?<eos> Okay, I think he's just a very interesting political philosopher.<eos> That's not your business.<eos> You're a suburban grandmother.<eos> For God's sakes, you shouldn't be thinking radical politics.<eos> You should be thinking hip replacement.<eos> It was so cute yesterday when they talked about bombing the Pentagon.<eos> You think it's charming that he never... he never spoke like that until she got her hands on him.<eos> Oh, you can't legislate feeling.<eos> In China, they do.
Your key.<eos> Room 210.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No good. No, prime.<eos> No. He needs a prime number. - Something like 607.<eos> - No, really, that's fine.<eos> Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.
Creeping Death.<eos> But yours is respectable.<eos> Classic.<eos> Well, you can't beat a classic.<eos> Friends, cars, music.<eos> New things can be fun, too.<eos> Unless you're afraid of change.<eos> Oh, I'm not afraid of much, and I can change in an instant, but, uh, not just for the fuck of it.<eos> Sometimes, you just got to make the change blindly and pray that it all goes well.<eos> And most of the time, it does.
Let me look into this.<eos> I'll get them for you from the studio.<eos> I'm not really supposed to, but...<eos> Please, you bring them back as soon as you can, otherwise I will be in big trouble.<eos> Of course.<eos> - She's going to need something a little flashier for the amfAR dinner. - Yeah.<eos> That's the stuff Louis set aside for the dinner.<eos> If Louis likes it, then she'll love it.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Mm. So does Louis.
Best case.<eos> I'm gonna come see you.<eos> You giving up?<eos> Yeah, it's not going to happen.<eos> Maureen, it's not that it isn't going to happen, it's that it doesn't exist.<eos> After death, there's nothing. I<eos> - I know.<eos> And it's not that big a deal.<eos> You told me that you had a hope... Like you really hoped that...<eos> Of course I do.
I couldn't keep up.<eos> All I mean is that with Lewis, nothing seems impossible.<eos> Many religions believe that the soul wanders around for a while before leaving this world.<eos> Did he speak to you about that?<eos> He was convinced of it.<eos> Years ago, Mum died, he was sure that... he was visited by her.<eos> That it felt like a dream, but not, that it was very real.<eos> He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.

Captain!<eos> Your Highness.<eos> I hear there's a British spy after me.<eos> You'll be quite safe, Your Highness.<eos> Sigurd tells me that you fought in Poland last year.<eos> My grandson, Oscar, was killed at the front there.<eos> Perhaps you knew?<eos> No.<eos> No, Your Highness. I...<eos> I didn't.
- to kill yourself.<eos> - Open your heart to me.<eos> - Bella, open your heart to me now!<eos> - Stop.<eos> It's fucking open!<eos> Bella!<eos> ♪ Rock, babe, rock, babe ♪<eos> What I tell you?<eos> She's coming.<eos> - How you doing?
Where have you been?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. I will be.<eos> But it's gonna take time.<eos> I'm not one of those people who has it easy. You know, who can just bounce back, pretend like nothing ever happened.<eos> So, you two just had a civil ceremony?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you and Juliette honeymoon?<eos> We didn't, actually.
A while.<eos> I did not sleep well.<eos> Aw, baby, I'm disappointed in Vita, too.<eos> I just want to get to the bottom of it.<eos> I mean, is it possible that maybe Frankie miscounted?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> He said the money's gone.<eos> Looks like she is, too.<eos> He tried to call her.<eos> Yeah, I did, too.
Got her voice-mail.<eos> We still got her scheduled to work.<eos> See if she shows up tonight, I guess.<eos> Or today.<eos> She's supposed to come by the offices and meet with Bucky and me.<eos> Let me know if she does or if I need to hire somebody for that shift.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you got going on today?<eos> Hear our buddy Riff Bell's coming out of retirement?<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah, sure.<eos> But they think it's gonna be the best single, and it's true.<eos> It's... it's the right song. I just...<eos> I just wish you'd trust that I'm confident enough to handle it.<eos> I'm not worried about your confidence, Gunnar.<eos> I owe you mine.<eos> What?<eos> That song... all my songs... they wouldn't exist without you.<eos> You're the person who got me into songwriting in the first place, so it doesn't seem right to me to just have my name on it.<eos> Hey. How y'all doing?
But I've come to realize that just 'cause something's hard or scary... doesn't mean you shouldn't do it... especially if it's something you believe in.<eos> And I believe in you.<eos> What exactly are you saying?<eos> That I'm sorry.<eos> And that I'd like you to come back to Wheelin' Dealin' Records, let me put out your album, like I should have done the first time around.<eos> What do you say?<eos> You bet.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
He's got custody.<eos> Guess I should just be lucky that he's letting me come visit.<eos> Which is definitely progress.<eos> You're right.<eos> After everything I put that man through, I guess I should just be grateful that he and I are in an okay place.<eos> What if Riff's just sick or hung over or something?<eos> I doubt Luke would consider canceling for a hangover.<eos> But he's looking for a replacement, right?<eos> - I'm sure he's gonna find someone.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
I'm still kind of amazed it all happened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything sounds perfect for you.<eos> I'm sorry. I-I didn't... mean it like that.<eos> I'm just frustrated.<eos> Avery has no time for me now that Juliette's back in town, so I feel like my album's at a standstill.<eos> Are they, like, hanging out again or something?<eos> They're hardly talking, actually.<eos> Not everybody has a great relationship with their ex.<eos> Well, Scarlett and Gunnar do.
Oh, well, that was all Scarlett, actually, yeah... lyrics and music.<eos> Well, it definitely wouldn't be what it is without Gunnar, so...<eos> Well, I am just glad we all found each other.<eos> 'Cause I really do think this is gonna do great things for y'all.<eos> Our next guest is a very special last-minute...<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Hey, anytime you tell me there's a new talent I should see, I am there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What'd you say this girl's name was?<eos> - I didn't.
It's not about her.<eos> It's about you and whatever sick game you're playing.<eos> I mean, what... what was I to you?<eos> A target?<eos> Some kind of revenge?<eos> You don't understand!<eos> She took everything from me!<eos> Yes, at first, I wanted to hurt her, and so maybe this started out wrong, but I swear my feelings for you are real.<eos> It doesn't matter... anymore.<eos> Of course it does.
Not at all.<eos> I actually paid him 100 bucks to leave an hour ago.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> This night turned out to be so much better than I thought it would.<eos> I actually can't remember the last time I had this much fun.<eos> It's been a rough year, huh?<eos> That's the understatement of the century.<eos> You know, I-I tried to call.<eos> I guess you changed your number.<eos> Yeah, I did a few times.
She's pretty.<eos> Isn't she?<eos> I'm leaving your brother Ishbaal here to protect you and your sister.<eos> He is in charge while I'm at war council with King Achish.<eos> You listen to him.<eos> Daughter... it would be wise to remember I did not kill Mattiyahu.<eos> It was the Philistines, and I will seek retribution for their act.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I just really like her.<eos> Of course you do.
No.<eos> Actually, I was just leaving.<eos> No one ever leaves.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why would anyone want to?<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Did you get what you came for?<eos> Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.<eos> So, yeah.<eos> I did.
You have done everything you can. No.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> I let this happen.<eos> I demanded an election... and now we have Chancellor Pike.<eos> We're on the brink of a war we can't win, and all I can do to stop it is send kids into harm's way.<eos> Hey, in case you haven't noticed, they're not kids anymore.<eos> With Clarke gone, Bellamy's the key.<eos> I've been trying to reach him, but Pike's influence is strong,<eos> and he really believes he's doing the right thing.<eos> Everybody always does.
Show Francine I get what she's going through.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Show, don't tell.<eos> And the best way to do that is to make the consumer feel like you don't just get them, you are them.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Did we land dentine ice?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I repurposed the dentine pitch.<eos> But you see what I'm saying? Yeah.<eos> I do.
His wife needed him.<eos> A true muggins will never acknowledge the corn, especially when facing the great beyond. It is not for us to decide.<eos> I gave you explicit instruction -- every man has a right to mercy, no matter his sins.<eos> I would insist on it for any soldier.<eos> Even you, sir.<eos> He's a hospital rat, Miss Phinney. Don't be taken in.<eos> Bullen -- he sent those men after you?<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out, but it's better you know.<eos> Silas has no intention of bringing your boy to Alexandria.<eos> Never did.
Oh, don't look down, Chalupa.<eos> We're higher than a giraffe's pussy.<eos> It's dangerous up here.<eos> Dangerous, like when you fuck with the Soldados, like when you shoot one of them.<eos> I'm gonna shoot your mama in the face with my dick! - What was that?<eos> - I'm gonna...<eos> Yo, J, you see? He didn't die.<eos> I knew that shit would work.<eos> Guess I lost that bet.<eos> Nah, he did.
"The King is grateful"?<eos> What else could I say?<eos> We both know there will never be a trial.<eos> It seems our visit has stirred the thief's conscience.<eos> They want to hand themselves over to us after the funeral tomorrow.<eos> Along with the Duke's stolen documents.<eos> He didn't lose money, he was lying.<eos> I told you everything I remember.<eos> I couldn't see who took the purse and I didn't get anywhere near the Duke.<eos> Who did?
Where'd you come from?<eos> How come you hang around my neighborhood so much?<eos> I like it.<eos> You like what?<eos> The neighborhood.<eos> Get outta here!<eos> You live in a fucking nice area in a house that's... The living room's bigger than my whole place.<eos> How could you like this?<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?
If they want to make the deal, we can get the rest.<eos> Dealers ain't exactly the kind of people you want to get cute with.<eos> We got to go back. We got to get the money.<eos> No, no, we're doing it this way.<eos> If it's not good for you, we can turn around and forget the whole thing.<eos> We're driving into a shitstorm, Howard.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> She's our gang.<eos> Come on, let's move.<eos> How you doing?
Hey, enough.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You've got a life back there, and maybe I will, too, but before I can even think about that, I need to take care of something.<eos> I have to try.<eos> So let me help you.<eos> You can't.<eos> Carl?<eos> I thought I saw her that night.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did.
Hey, congrats on getting Steve Birch.<eos> That's a solid double.<eos> Axelrod... that's bigger.<eos> You speaking for the Attorney General or is this off the cuff?<eos> I speak for everyone.<eos> It's fundraising season.<eos> The administration needs Wall Street money to compete.<eos> Nobody wants this to look like some kind of crusade.<eos> I'm doing my job. I don't think about what it looks like.<eos> Well, the AG does.
You'll land on a private strip on private land.<eos> Then I can't see myself running the piece tonight.<eos> Yummy.<eos> This is yummy.<eos> For years, I couldn't eat tripe. I thought I could still smell the shit in it.<eos> Then I hypnotized him out of it. - Mm.<eos> You going for hypnotism now, Nancy?<eos> - Oh. - Huh? - It only works on him.<eos> I stare into his eyes, he locks in on me... and we will the change.<eos> Work it does.
Get up.<eos> I canceled your speech at the conference. Good.<eos> Next?<eos> Raul Gomez says he needs to know if he can tell his board you're clear of charges.<eos> Call back later.<eos> You were right. It was the girlfriend.<eos> The video makes the whole thing clear. He was drinking. He basically admits to driving your kids drunk.<eos> He insults them and you.<eos> We've got the full version now.<eos> No one else does.
- I can't.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> Try.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stop it.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Yeah.<eos> My parents are so proud.<eos> What about Alexandre?<eos> If I accept the job, that's not the issue.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> - We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
My experience is that in the vast majority of cases, after 48 hours they're gonna release him.<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do until then?<eos> You wait it out and pray, all right?<eos> If you do pray.<eos> I...gave that up a long time ago.<eos> Look, look, I know it's hard, all right?<eos> I'm sorry, I just... I got to get to work.<eos> Mr. Decody.<eos> So we're still going to keep her here a little while longer.<eos> But, uh, she did great.
What happens next?<eos> Just said she was in a rush and to give her the deposit.<eos> See that thumbprint?<eos> Yours.<eos> Now, why was there broken glass?<eos> I was frustrated.<eos> She was all over the place. She wouldn't tell me why.<eos> I was just making a point and...<eos> How did you know it was my print?<eos> Oh, I didn't, pet.
My team's already combing through the footage.<eos> Anything on the license plate?<eos> Stolen off an Accord in New Haven three days ago.<eos> That's helpful.<eos> "What about the tip line?" he asked, already knowing the answer.<eos> Flooded, thanks to Warren's press conference.<eos> Anything other than the usual shut-ins and crackpots?<eos> Even if someone calls with something, i-it'll take forever to find them in the haystack.<eos> We don't have forever.<eos> No, we do not.
So, if I were the right guy, you would marry me.<eos> - You wouldn't?<eos> No. That's not what I'm saying.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What about me?<eos> Would you?<eos> Would I what? Marry me.<eos> Did you just ask me to marry you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You did.
Shit.<eos> He's folding on us.<eos> No. It's the last gasp of conscience.<eos> He's gonna do it.<eos> I just placed an order for 1.8 million shares.<eos> Kaboom!<eos> There's another 800,000 shares on this ticket. Can you get 'em in for me?<eos> You know I will. Give me some ups.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He did it.
May I?<eos> Feels real.<eos> Feels like the others.<eos> It's not the hand.<eos> It's me.<eos> Maybe you're not supposed to get over it.<eos> Some things you can't move past.<eos> They scar you, change you permanently.<eos> I don't know what happened there, on that planet.<eos> I do.
We had a tape.<eos> The tape's gone.<eos> It's over.<eos> Both of them?<eos> Both of them?<eos> What do you mean, "both of them"?<eos> Yeah, I made a copy of the tape.<eos> You taught me that.<eos> Always make a copy.<eos> Well, Mindhorn did.
Whereabouts at Pat's?<eos> In the garage.<eos> In the glove compartment of the Mindhorn car.<eos> - What have you got the gun for?<eos> - You know too much, Richard.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
This way, please.<eos> Gloves are a nice touch.<eos> Didn't want to scratch my hand.<eos> You mean you didn't want me to see you scratching your hand.<eos> The gloves are to remind you but the itch is still there.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I record my sessions for later review, saves taking notes.<eos> I've never heard my own voice.<eos> You wouldn't like it.<eos> No one does.
And I barely saw your faces, so if you let me go, I couldn't even identify you.<eos> Not that I would, 'cause you guys are vampires!<eos> Who would believe me?<eos> I didn't even know you guys existed until yesterday!<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> If your goal was to scare the crap out of me, mission accomplished!<eos> And as far as I'm concerned... you can have it out with those Shadowhunters.<eos> Especially, the blonde one.<eos> You know, you don't need me.<eos> On the contrary, I do.
Alec!<eos> I think I found it!<eos> Mary Milligan!<eos> Beloved servant?<eos> Who wants that on a headstone?<eos> Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.<eos> At least she is now.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Wait, you people actually say that?<eos> No, Clary, we don't.
Sun's gonna come up soon.<eos> Remember how to use the blade?<eos> Keep your arms steady and don't overestimate what you know.<eos> They can be tricky.<eos> We'll try and keep them off you as much as we can.<eos> Where are Alec and Isabelle?<eos> Being distracting.<eos> You're really not gonna talk to me, are you?<eos> That's because you have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.
Prime Minister, welcome.<eos> Is that our General Inhuman right there?<eos> It is.<eos> - Gang's all here. What's the plan?<eos> May and Hunter, you secure the Prime Minister.<eos> Daisy, Bobbi, Mack, contain the General. Try to get him outside.<eos> We'll send the containment module down to the South exit.<eos> Yeah, be careful.<eos> He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet.<eos> Perhaps we do.
Come on, this way.<eos> So, what were you doing at the fairground?<eos> I wanted to ask about Brendan.<eos> Looked like you were trying to start a fight.<eos> - I'm not wanting to press charges.<eos> - Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.<eos> I just wanted to ask that fairground owner whether he knew Brendan.<eos> And did he?
No.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> Why were you both running away?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just wanted to be together.<eos> I'm sick of my mum trying to break us up.<eos> Was that the only reason?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Does Harris love you?<eos> - Yeah, of course he does.
Yeah.<eos> - Does Harris love you?<eos> - Yeah, of course he does.<eos> So you don't have any secrets?<eos> No. None.<eos> Good.<eos> So, let's talk about what happened to your old bunkmate Jamie Thorne.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Jodie told you where I was.<eos> My mistake, pet, so she did.
And when she retires at the end of this term, I'm delighted to say that her daughter, Celia, will run for the open seat to continue delivering just like her mother has.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> And I, for one, will support your candidacy with everything I've got.<eos> And I know Claire will, as well.<eos> Texans are tenacious.<eos> I'm proud to be married to one, and I'm proud to have served with one, like Congresswoman Jones.<eos> Thank you, Doris, for all your years of service, and thank you, Celia, for picking up the mantle.<eos> Doris said her daughter spoke out of turn, that she didn't know about the deal she was brokering with Underwood.<eos> Did you connect with LeAnn?<eos> No, I didn't.
It's just words.<eos> They mean very little.<eos> I'm willing to back them up with action.<eos> First, we should talk about a bailout.<eos> I'm willing to work with the IMF to get you what you need.<eos> And second, as a gesture of good faith, we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.<eos> You should've done so already.<eos> I need your assurances he'll get a trial.<eos> - What do you care about Igor Milkin?<eos> - I don't.
All right.<eos> I'm sorry I've been away for so long, Chocko.<eos> I can't believe you're moving. Me too.<eos> I have to go back to New York, and I wish I could take you with, but I don't have a place for you, and there, they make horses pull carriages full of disgusting tourists, and that is no life for you.<eos> Shh, don't interrupt.<eos> This is beast-to-beast catharsis.<eos> But I promise I will make sure they take good care of you because you were the best horse ever.<eos> A true friend.<eos> Even if sometimes I might have taken you for granted, you were always there for me... and you never held it against me if I got a little bitchy because you knew how much I loved you, even if I didn't say it<eos> But I did.

I don't know.<eos> I saw him once in a while in the cafe.<eos> - I tried my best to avoid him.<eos> - Why's that then?<eos> Not in front of my son.<eos> Can he play whilst we talk?<eos> Please.<eos> You were saying?<eos> He liked to drink.<eos> Plenty of them do in here.
Ali de-boozifed the place when she thought Charlotte was coming home.<eos> But I'll help you find the wine glasses if you help me find an opener.<eos> Deal.<eos> Jordan seems nice.<eos> He is.<eos> Uh, congrats on your engagement.<eos> I-I meant to say that yesterday.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - So you kept the table?<eos> - Of course, I did.
He told me he went home afterwards.<eos> But...<eos> I don't know. He-he was so angry.<eos> - Aria, what is it?<eos> - I know him.<eos> And I know that Ezra can't look me in the eye when he lies. And when he told me he went home, he didn't...<eos> Look at me.<eos> Well, we have to tell someone.<eos> - Lorenzo, Ali, anyone.<eos> - No, we don't.
Thank you.<eos> Secondly, do you ever wonder if we're living too large? [Dramatic chord plays]<eos> We're broke.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> We just heard mom say we're living too large.<eos> I knew this was too much house.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I'm two years away from college, so this is more of a "you" problem than a "we" problem.<eos> Well, I've got a "disaster preparedness" folder.<eos> Of course you do.
Raising four kids requires the parents to be a perfectly coordinated team, and Bow and I are on point.<eos> We have it down. Mm!<eos> Or we did.
And when she washed their sheets, she said it looked filthier than a hot tub at Circus Circus.<eos> What?<eos> ! We had a wild night, but...<eos> I mean, sure, yeah, we tried some things, but neither one of us was in any real danger.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She is literally airing our dirty laundry.<eos> And it did not stop there, Dre.<eos> The wife says her hair is naturally curly, and I guess it is... if you call $700 worth of product natural.<eos> Oh, you did not like that.<eos> No, I did not.
We're gonna make this family great again!<eos> Nailed it.<eos> My mama all day, er'day.<eos> Ha ha! She didn't say anything.<eos> Oh, I think she said everything.<eos> - Everything!<eos> - No, she...<eos> - No, yes, she did. - No.<eos> She did not say anything.<eos> She did.
-for sins he doesn't even know?<eos> -You think life is that simple, child?<eos> We will find them.<eos> You're warm.<eos> Do you bleed?<eos> -No.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.
- What else?<eos> - I killed their horses.<eos> You killed them?<eos> The Khan's sons aren't capable of walking half a day to a way station?<eos> Then why, Orus, have they not arrived at a way station?<eos> The Vice Regent's horse... fell on his leg.<eos> And you left them there.<eos> I thought you'd left me.<eos> Well, I said I was coming back.<eos> - You did?
- I killed their horses.<eos> You killed them?<eos> The Khan's sons aren't capable of walking half a day to a way station?<eos> Then why, Orus, have they not arrived at a way station?<eos> The Vice Regent's horse... fell on his leg.<eos> And you left them there.<eos> I thought you'd left me.<eos> Well, I said I was coming back.<eos> - You did?<eos> Yes, you did.
Carefully imagine how others feel. Put yourself in their circumstances and practice kindness from that day forward.<eos> That is it?<eos> It will change your karma now.<eos> Or many lifetimes from now.<eos> -Hello, Empress Chabi.<eos> Hello, my Princess Ling Ling.<eos> - Am I still a princess?<eos> - Of course you are.<eos> Master Ahmad says I may marry a prince one day.<eos> Does he now?
It's the truth.<eos> You, the first woman Khan.<eos> That's what he said.<eos> What would that make me?<eos> Keeper of the hearth?<eos> Maybe.<eos> -That's not what I'm meant to be.<eos> -And I am?<eos> -So you want it?<eos> -What if I did?
But you gotta promise not to tell Alexis.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> If you're experiencing feelings for me, Like, I totally get it.<eos> And normally I'd be into it, I've just been down this road before, and it's-it's messy.<eos> - No, it's about Alexis.<eos> - I see, okay.<eos> Um, well, you know, uh... what is it?<eos> She slept over like a week and a half ago, and she hasn't left.<eos> - I mean, don't get me wrong, I love having her there at night, - if you know what I mean.<eos> - Yeah, I do, yeah.
Where are these people?<eos> What do you want, Rachel?<eos> You're trying to sell Yael and Dominique as the fan favorites?<eos> Well, yeah, anything's possible since we don't actually tally those votes.<eos> I mean, I don't even really know where that phone number goes.<eos> Okay, but, like, why Dominique?<eos> So Hot Rachel gets the overnight.<eos> I mean, if I gave Darius an actual choice, then I wouldn't get what I want.<eos> Okay, well, Darius wants Ruby, FYI.<eos> Of course he does.
A man who can kill with his bare hands.<eos> - Chet just offered us better stuff.<eos> - What stuff did he offer you?<eos> Uh, private accommodations, our cellphones. - Mm.<eos> - Oh, yeah. And a three-year pay-or-play sportscasting deal if...<eos> He doesn't even have the authority<eos> - to offer you something like that.<eos> - Oh, he didn't?<eos> The network president, Gary?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Thanks. That's enough.<eos> No, no... that's not even close to enough.<eos> Look. You want to skip the lashes?<eos> Fine, whatever.<eos> But I'm telling you, they would change your life.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ruby.<eos> Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but you know who doesn't win this thing?<eos> Rosa Parks.<eos> And who does?
The fact that I have to watch this stuff again nauseates me.<eos> Ugh. So we got Chantal's grandma.<eos> - She's in a car, she's on her way.<eos> - Great.<eos> She has no idea what's coming, does she?<eos> Do you ever feel bad about what we do to these girls?<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Darius, I'm so sorry!<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Shh!<eos> Damn it!<eos> I get that, okay?<eos> You don't think I get that?<eos> Tell the world, why don't you.<eos> Look, I'm not humiliating Chantal on national television.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> It won't happen, okay? She's a sweet girl.<eos> She doesn't deserve that.<eos> Okay, but Yael does?
- No, it's not over.<eos> - Yes, it is over!<eos> This is about... This is about justice.<eos> She has no remorse for the things she's done, - and she admits as much. - Wha...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I have a lot of friends and a pile of cash.<eos> We, uh... You really think we need $100,000 "Greens" budget?<eos> How did you get that?<eos> I know some hackers, and they taught me, so I tapped your phone, turned on the mike... - You tapped my phone?<eos> - Yes. I did this for...
In 2166, an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage conquered the world and murdered my wife and child.<eos> I have assembled an elite team to hunt him throughout time and stop his rise to power.<eos> Unfortunately, my plan is opposed by the body I'd sworn my allegiance to, the Time Masters.<eos> In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> His name is Chronos.<eos> He works for the Council of Time Masters.<eos> Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.<eos> The Lazarus Pit brought me back, but it left me with this need to kill.<eos> Sara! Sara, don't!
Don't you have to open the register to put the money in?<eos> Right, 'cause if you were buying something, then I would have had to -- right. Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about this, then?<eos> You guys go and pretend to buy something, you know, for the cameras.<eos> And then, um, when I get the register open, you guys pull out the gun, and then I give you the money.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> We're lying. We're not. No one has a gun.<eos> We might have a gun.<eos> Nobody does.
You take formal statements from the family and anyone that saw him this morning.<eos> We'll talk to Lorenz's colleagues, see if they can shed any light.<eos> It has your father's blessing, the park?<eos> As much as anything.<eos> It's all very well being the spare, but one has to do something with one's time.<eos> How was it you came to send Philip after Dr. Lorenz?<eos> First person I bumped into.<eos> Said he saw him heading into the Heartwood.<eos> - And where did you find his case?<eos> - I didn't.
We were riding once in the Tetons, and there was this rockslide up ahead, and her horse bucked ...<eos> threw her right off. And my heart stopped.<eos> But she got up and...<eos> calmed that horse in a way that made me more proud than anything I'd ever done.<eos> And that was the day I told her about Hydra. - Brought her into the fold.<eos> - Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse.<eos> I taught her to have faith in it as a god.<eos> And she did.
Right?<eos> Take him.<eos> This hatred of my empire and Queen, these were my son's true beliefs?<eos> They were, Major Al-Qadir.<eos> I cannot believe he came to them - without you. - Hmm.<eos> And which beliefs did he come to because of you?<eos> I am his father.<eos> That is a notional term, sir.<eos> You have a cheek.<eos> You always did.
- Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...
Go and see.<eos> Hello, Bennet.<eos> And this you've done on nothing but the suspicion of one woman?<eos> A woman who... forgive me, Mr. Reid. I currently lack for energy and therefore tact, but this is a woman for whom you shamed your wife, is it not?<eos> I did warn you.<eos> What?<eos> You knew?<eos> You knew he was here, pushing his refined nose into work he had long since abandoned?<eos> Now, Drake, I merely told him...<eos> Do not now me nothing, Jackson!
A woman's intimate area is a rancid playground of flavor-causing enzymes and white gravel, but Yo-Puss deadens those cells, removing the unpleasant and unfair taste permanently.<eos> You mean, if I eat Yo-Puss, I won't taste like hot summer Chinatown garbage anymore?<eos> You won't taste like anything anymore.<eos> My pussy tastes like nothing.<eos> Here, taste.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Right?<eos> I use scented tampons even when I'm not on my period, just to chemically strip my vagina of any scent.<eos> But I still worry it tastes really bad.<eos> It definitely does.
Nah, this is not to help me.<eos> This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.<eos> -Okay, Joe, let's go.<eos> -The bullshit I pulled?<eos> I work three jobs.<eos> This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill?<eos> I heard he had kidney stones. But no health insurance.<eos> So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
- You have a telescope?<eos> I got a small one. Been working on a bigger one.<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> Do it now!<eos> That guy we caught was doing pirate radio, yeah, but he's not Geronimo.<eos> Hey, Will?<eos> Check it out.<eos> Detainee said this is where he picked up the radio scripts.<eos> You think all these cells are operating independently.<eos> I do.
Sadly, our venue wasn't built for the disabled in mind.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> To prove a point.<eos> Here's to crime.<eos> You see, I have a reason, a good one.<eos> I have to prove myself... As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?
Scott.<eos> That guy's not moving at all.<eos> Look...<eos> Help me.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> Please...<eos> You can't help him.<eos> That's big.<eos> No one said it was that big.<eos> I did.
Come, Marcel.<eos> Out to the well.<eos> Do you have any cloth?<eos> Something to wrap your hand?<eos> Yes.<eos> In the cellar.<eos> You'll find what you're looking for in the cellar.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Release the arrow.<eos> Do it, Marie-Jeanne.
- You got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just...<eos> I just want to make sure everything's okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm... I... don't want to nag.<eos> That's not, you know, who I am.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't... I don't want you to feel burdened by anything.<eos> No, I don't.
Liam.<eos> They suck.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> Your back shots.<eos> Which suck.<eos> I must've been thinkin' of someone else.<eos> Yeah. Maybe someone else who should be captain?<eos> We'll make it.<eos> Well, guess we have to go now.<eos> No, we don't.
Were you tearing Claudia Stilinski's wallpaper off her wall?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yes. She's worried about your mental health.<eos> I saw someone in the hallway.<eos> Someone Mrs. Stilinski didn't see.<eos> Well, if Claudia is not seeing ghosts, maybe it's because she's not a Banshee.<eos> I think he was trying to help me find something Stiles left behind.<eos> A relic.<eos> Did you?
Damon, Damon, can you move?<eos> Please. Please. You must help me.<eos> Damon, Damon, can you move?<eos> Please. You must help me. Why?<eos> This isn't real.<eos> Pain is real.<eos> Feeling is real. Unh!<eos> You love this, don't you?<eos> I'm gonna die knowing my own son hates me.<eos> Yes. He does.
Why would you believe a word she says?<eos> Can I just stay here for a bit?<eos> I could really use someone to talk to.<eos> I can't stay. I actually have somewhere to be.<eos> [sighs] Great!<eos> Elliott told you?<eos> Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision so I need to do it.<eos> You can say whatever you wanna say. I don't care.<eos> Just... [sighs] ... promise me you won't tell my mom.<eos> Emily, Elliott didn't.
I'm sorry, I-I really have to go.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> I love you.<eos> He hung up on me.<eos> I think she knows.<eos> Something's really wrong.<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> - You went to see her?<eos> - Yes, Byron.<eos> I did.
At least one of us will have a degree that matters.<eos> I enrolled, Hanna, but it's not like it was four years ago when the only thing I had to worry about in freshman year was catching something from a communal shower curtain.<eos> Emily, you're not gonna have......<eos> Yes, I am, Hanna.<eos> How am I supposed to take notes when the voice in my head is telling me that Sara Harvey is torturing you for something Melissa might have done?<eos> Wait, Melissa Hastings?<eos> Melissa might have called Charlotte from the diner, she could've been the one who lured her out in the middle of the night......<eos> No, no, no, hold on.<eos> Wasn't Melissa in London? Spencer thinks so.<eos> Caleb doesn't.
Mona left him sitting on the bench.<eos> Couple minutes later he got up and went inside.<eos> You didn't hear anything that she said to him?<eos> No, I was too far away.<eos> But what is Mona doing with Sara's driver?<eos> Well, I doubt she's asking him for a ride to the airport.<eos> It was a meeting of the minions.<eos> Yeah, could be.<eos> Did he go in there with that tube?<eos> No, he didn't.
You are wrong.<eos> I am nothing like you.<eos> Felicity.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. - Anything you say can...<eos> - Felicity, no. And will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> Don't do-- don't do this.<eos> Thank you both for coming.<eos> How is Thea?<eos> Don't pretend like you care.<eos> I do.
Everything has unfolded according to Providence.<eos> What do you think is under there anyway?<eos> Power, Mr. Queen.<eos> I'm glad you have recuperated.<eos> We have much to accomplish together.<eos> Reiter's pet.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know you killed Vlad.<eos> I watched.<eos> We all did.
Debate prep.<eos> Just took the words right out of my mouth.<eos> Yep.<eos> This man deserves to die.<eos> He tortured us!<eos> And he saved me.<eos> At great risk to himself, he kept me alive.<eos> I have more reason than anyone to hate this man, but he's our best chance of going home.<eos> He killed your brother.<eos> Yes, he did.
His death is inevitable.<eos> Why waste his life when it can make me stronger?<eos> What are you doing with my clothes?<eos> When I get stressed, I--I like to fold.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> When you two were married, it was like living at the Gap.<eos> Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.

All right, you guys.<eos> I will now do anything for ten dollars.<eos> Who's got something for me?<eos> I got one. I'll give you ten bucks if you wear the same pair of underwear for a month.<eos> Pay up.<eos> Uh, actually, you owe me $20.<eos> Here's $50, go change your underwear.<eos> It won't come off.<eos> Hey, Peter, you want to earn another ten bucks?<eos> Course I do.
- This isn't a hotel.<eos> - Coke, narcos, any... any kind of painkillers,<eos> - muscle relaxants, anything?<eos> - I... - You know what?<eos> Let me get a medic for you.<eos> - They send you in here looking for me?<eos> - Did who send me in here looking for you?<eos> - The fucking producers, man.<eos> Did they send you in here to get me?<eos> No, they didn't.
What?<eos> He doesn't care about you one little bit. He don't.<eos> He's only doing this to try to put me down the way that he always does.<eos> Now he's dragging you into it.<eos> But why are you doing this?<eos> Are you trying to hurt me?<eos> I'm not doing this to you. Then who are you doin' it to?<eos> Your lostie?<eos> He doesn't care about you either.<eos> He never did.
Your immune system is completely shut down!<eos> Anyone so much as sneezes, and it might kill you.<eos> So until you've fully recovered, you are a prisoner... you're my prisoner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I just don't know what to do.<eos> None of us do.<eos> Did you at least tell Coulson we might have a cure?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because we don't.
2002, larceny.<eos> 2006, Jacob Michael Raines born, father... father... who the hell knows?<eos> 2012, possession of a controlled substance and child endangerment, termination of all parental rights.<eos> One month ago, early release from Fluvanna Correctional Center on good behavior.<eos> Two suicide attempts, six O.D.s, four abortions.<eos> When you're not in prison, you bounce from town to town, rarely staying longer than a couple of weeks.<eos> You're just a thief, a pickpocket, a grifter... a survivor.<eos> All your worldly possessions are in this piece-of-shit motel room, and if you O.D. today, nobody would bother to claim your body.<eos> - Did you kill her?<eos> - Of course I did.
The other one is Danny Torr.<eos> Never seen either of them before.<eos> Danny Torr is willing to testify that you asked him to pay Eddie Kerr £30,000 to kill Michael Thompson.<eos> He would say that - he's protecting Arthur McCall.<eos> For the benefit of the tape, I'm now showing Mr. Sarwar an e-mail.<eos> Apparently, you knew where Michael Thompson was living.<eos> I've never seen that e-mail.<eos> We found it on your computer in a file named "Dolos".<eos> See, Phyllis Brennan told us almost everything that we need to know about you.<eos> Or rather, you did.
An illusion, created with a little gold thread.<eos> It's clever.<eos> I daresay, if all goes well today, this may very well be how I'm remembered.<eos> After all the missions, this flag may be my greatest accomplishment.<eos> Betsy, I'm certain you are wrong there.<eos> And even if it were it really is beautiful.<eos> Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.<eos> The original Stars and Stripes.<eos> She told me she was not going on the mission.<eos> Clearly, she did.
- Are you sure?<eos> - I was in my cabin all night.<eos> Can anyone corroborate that?<eos> As I told your boss when he took my statement - no.<eos> We'd like to take a fingerprint sample from you. Elimination purposes.<eos> Unless you're arresting and charging me, I don't have to give you prints.<eos> And any prints you DO take without my consent are unusable in court.<eos> So, again - no.<eos> - You know your rights.<eos> - Aye, I do.
- All right.<eos> They'll go through the motions, hit a brick wall.<eos> Case closed. - You want us to play along'?<eos> - It's worked so far.<eos> - So far'? - What's your problem'?<eos> My problem... (Voices in background)<eos> My problem... is what really happened with you and that suspect.<eos> Don't try playing the big man.<eos> We both know you're not up to it.<eos> She definitely does.
- while your wee mates stood by and watched!<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Interview's finished, Danny.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - Good.<eos> Neither are we.<eos> You know why I've been appointed - to ensure that anti-corruption inquiries don't get pulled apart in court.<eos> Don't try playing the big man.<eos> We both know you're not up to it.<eos> She definitely does.
Look at all these people.<eos> Yeah, good thing we brought the very small plane to carry them.<eos> We'll have room.<eos> We're adding another one!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait!<eos> - What did you do to me?<eos> - The only thing we could think of.<eos> Did we just...
What is it?<eos> There may not be a Ruffnut to apologize to.<eos> In fact, there may not be any of us at all.<eos> Okay, what's the plan?<eos> We have to get my sister back.<eos> First thing is to send an SOS to Berk.<eos> We need reinforcements, fast.<eos> The auxiliary team.<eos> How do we know he'll get there in time?<eos> We don't.

What do you mean she's gonna marry Rate?<eos> Mother.<eos> - Have you no shame?<eos> - Slean!<eos> Selling your body and my birthright.<eos> You have no birthright.<eos> You gave it up when you joined your uncle in treason.<eos> Oh, for once in your life, can you please just be honest with yourself?<eos> You never had any intention of stepping aside for me, did you?<eos> I did.
-He's afraid of clowns.<eos> -I thought he was afraid of elves.<eos> He used to be.<eos> Now it's clowns.<eos> Well, that's why there's clown spray.<eos> We'll just spray it all over the fort.<eos> You know, you really should call it anti-clown spray.<eos> I mean, clown spray would attract clowns.<eos> -No, clowns.<eos> -But it doesn't! Right, Grandma Grace?
Not at all.<eos> Because, uh, you didn't call me to come help with the kids.<eos> Mom, Jean jumped on a plane.<eos> Huh, and, uh, you told your father first that you were pregnant.<eos> To cheer him up.<eos> I was dying to tell you, Mom. I called you.<eos> And left a message with no hint of any news.<eos> I didn't want to tell you in a message.<eos> Well, you know something, it felt... like you didn't really want to tell me at all.<eos> Mom, of course I did.
And I love you.<eos> All agents, move in.<eos> ♪ No, I'm not scared ♪<eos> _<eos> _<eos> ♪ Embrace the doubt and face the fear ♪<eos> You cannot be calling me.<eos> You didn't answer my text.<eos> That's right.<eos> I didn't.
Things with William are "better than ever"?<eos> Maybe they are to her.<eos> Either way, she lied to you guys.<eos> She is not on her way to City Hall.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - Did you clone her phone? - A little.<eos> - Where's she going?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Alice and I have things to discuss.<eos> No, we don't.
Rhys got a little too empathetic with Morgan's Mommy issues.<eos> Does Sybil know?<eos> She'll find out.<eos> And then kill you.<eos> She won't have to.<eos> Morgan and Stephanie love each other, right?<eos> So all you have to do is convince them that marriage is still worth it.<eos> You still believe that, don't you?<eos> That part wasn't a lie.<eos> I do.
When?<eos> Yesterday, just after you left.<eos> We were sitting right here, and he got down on one knee, and he proposed.<eos> It was really lovely, actually.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Well, I said no, of course.<eos> W... I'm not gonna sit here and say to you and Morgan that marriage is an outdated concept and then turn around and marry him.<eos> Yeah, but you love him, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
- Did you see that? - Yes.<eos> Everybody saw those.<eos> Yeah, everybody saw those.<eos> Everybody saw that he's a dumbass, and his life is ruined.<eos> - He got drunk. That's all. - $55.54.<eos> Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right?<eos> And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him.<eos> Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him.<eos> So, I don't know why you have to assume I'm gonna do something wrong.<eos> I don't. I just...
I'm so sorry. That's such a mess. Let me clean that up.<eos> - Uh, it's not working.<eos> Okay. - Here, let me.<eos> No, I got it. I got it. Just go.<eos> Go.<eos> - You sure? - Go.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I think you messed something up.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I didn't.
No!<eos> I want you to get drunk.<eos> I believe that once you get drunk, you'll sell out to the salt people.<eos> But what about our family memories?<eos> We'll buy new memories... with all that salt money.<eos> And we don't have to share it with your dad.<eos> In fact, we can give him this poison martini.<eos> Piss off, Francine.<eos> I've got too much to live for, knowing I still have my Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards.<eos> Um, actually, you don't.
- What is my story?<eos> - I'll tell you.<eos> This has been your dream for the last 30 years.<eos> You made it happen.<eos> An Oscar won't make you happy forever, it won't solve all your problems.<eos> You win that Oscar, the next day you go back to being you.<eos> But that night is a really good night.<eos> I think you deserve a really good night, and I know how to get you there.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't send mail.<eos> Most of the mail I do get, I don't read.<eos> Never had an e-mail account.<eos> Warden can verify all this, if you don't believe me.<eos> Then, who is behind this?<eos> Who?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I might be able to help you figure out why.<eos> First question I'd ask is: Why did Verna McBride deserve to die?<eos> - She didn't.
We'll work together side by side, every day.<eos> You can continue to mentor me, just like you've always done.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> People will say you are just doing a favor for a friend.<eos> Who have you taken me for?<eos> Did you really think I'd accept your charity?<eos> Charity?<eos> I don't have the power to make you pope, Michael.<eos> It's not true that you don't have the power to make me pope.<eos> You do.
Concentrate on The Reverse-Flash.<eos> Okay.<eos> I see him.<eos> Move toward him.<eos> Okay, now what?<eos> Try to picture him with Christina McGee.<eos> Where the hell am I?<eos> It's charged. You can go now.<eos> You said you'd release me.<eos> Yes, I did.
I knew what you were going through and that you needed time to put yourself back together.<eos> D-Did I ruin this?<eos> I just think... we need to work on ourselves before we can talk about us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The stuff that I did, Lincoln,<eos> - I can't live with it.<eos> - I remember that pain ... sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried. I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I ...
Like I said, I've been through it.<eos> I've hit bottom.<eos> I know what it's like to be so addicted to something that you'd do anything to get her back.<eos> Hive and his worker bees will be down here any second. - And then?<eos> - Even if we could steal the warhead, it's probably on a timer by now, timed with their ascent.<eos> I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one.<eos> Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but ...<eos> - I do.
That's it.<eos> Got to roll.<eos> Got the governor waiting.<eos> He gets all whiny on me when I'm late.<eos> It was a pleasure seeing you.<eos> You gonna keep me hanging?<eos> So, Suh Casa.<eos> It ought to be a big hit, huh?<eos> What's up, big dog?<eos> How you doing, man?
That's not your decision to make!<eos> Control yourself.<eos> Unless you can't.<eos> It's worse than I remember.<eos> The rage.<eos> The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.<eos> I never really cared to.<eos> But now you do.
There's something you need to know.<eos> I did everything you asked.<eos> I joined your stupid cult, I left my friends in the dust because that's what you needed!<eos> Marcel...<eos> I fought for Hope!<eos> I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.

That's why I'm here, to express my gratitude.<eos> Ooh, you cheeky little minx.<eos> Have you come to have a go at me? Get out of here, Camille!<eos> Shut up, Nik.<eos> This is between us girls.<eos> Though I suppose I will let you listen to her cries as I tear off her limbs like the wings of pretty little butterfly.<eos> I'd like to see you try. You're brandishing your antiques at me.<eos> I suppose I would be scared if I thought you were quick enough to use them.<eos> You really did not think this through, did you?<eos> Actually, we did.
She thinks it was random. She doesn't know it was me.<eos> I almost told her the other day, but... we're doing so well right now.<eos> She's doing so well.<eos> And, um...<eos> Well, I... I don't want to mess that up.<eos> Not when... not when I'm starting to feel like I have my daughter back.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> How things go with your brother?<eos> You guys talk things through?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we did.
I'm gonna talk to the boys, get his ass found.<eos> - Morning, Krake.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Good morning, G'win.<eos> Morning.<eos> I have apologies to give to you.<eos> For what?<eos> For the man that I was, the man I become.<eos> I should be the one apologizing to you.<eos> I done terrible things...
No, I know, he loved Leonor, too.<eos> Tony told me!<eos> Of course he liked Leonor, but he left it for us and for your Aunt Audrey.<eos> But I have a great idea.<eos> We go back to our old apartment, and we rent this place and give the money to Aunt Audrey.<eos> Tony and I are both going to be going to the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, so I don't need to take the subway or anything to school.<eos> I could just walk.<eos> And you'll be closer to the theater.<eos> I loved the show, Dad, I loved it.<eos> I really did.

- God, what a shit show!<eos> - Mm-hmm. - She really is. - [Exhales sharply]<eos> So when did you wind up proposing?<eos> [Both laugh] - Oh, that's, uh...<eos> - Complicated.<eos> Yeah.<eos> [Romantic music playing] And do you, sir, take Robin to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Sí.<eos> And do you, Robin, take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I-I do.
- Sorry?<eos> Too late for sorry!<eos> - How do I make this right? - There's no way to make this right!<eos> Man!<eos> I-i can buy some merchandise!<eos> Do you have any toilet paper? !<eos> What is happening?<eos> - Why did you use your sleeves?<eos> Why didn't you just use your socks?<eos> I did. Okay?
Looks like his plans are not gonna happen tonight.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Wait up, man.<eos> You gonna tell me what the hell we're doing?<eos> Just keep filming, all right?<eos> No matter what happens. Yeah, yeah.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, listen to me, my sweet little matryoshka doll, I love you, baby, and I'm gonna prove to you once and for all that I'm a real man, a-a...<eos> Nate, you... you doing vertical video?
Well, how could he do that to you?<eos> Because people cheat for all kinds of reasons.<eos> They're just... sometimes they're working something out, right?<eos> Okay.<eos> I think I know what this is about.<eos> - [sighs] You do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're afraid I'm gonna cheat.<eos> - [sighs] - I swear to you that is not gonna happen, and I can say that for sure because I cheated on Courtney, and it was miserable.<eos> You did?
Just because you can't have that necklace, doesn't mean you won't see her again.<eos> Walk with me. Tell me everything about her.<eos> So, Alec blew right by you and did what he wanted.<eos> I'd be angry, too.<eos> He took the only way I had to see my mother.<eos> Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like.<eos> He was interested in Valentine's style?<eos> Fascinating...<eos> No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him.<eos> And did you?
You talk about trading hands on a rooftop, Red.<eos> I'm talking about shit, okay?<eos> Shit that you ain't been in.<eos> - I know one thing.<eos> - What's that?<eos> War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
- I need to talk to you more than I've ever needed to talk to you in my life.<eos> I think I'm becoming a vampire.<eos> I was wondering when you'd come back.<eos> - I got the Cup.<eos> - I don't care about the Cup.<eos> It just looks like a wine glass.<eos> That wine glass saved your life.<eos> What if... what if I hadn't gotten the Cup out in time?<eos> - That demon...<eos> - But you did.
so now I know all the guards' middle names.<eos> Then, when I was supposed to take my lunch break, Mr. Caputo needed help downloading the latest version of Excel.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's like a hundred years old and doesn't know how to use a computer, which I don't either, but it's really not that hard, like... - common sense, people. - Mmm.<eos> Oh, and then I had to fill out an order form for order forms. So weird, right?<eos> Oh, and I got to eat this bar that Caputo eats sometimes instead of food when he's really busy, and it wasn't that bad.<eos> Had this weird color, and he said I would probably have trouble pooping'.<eos> I need to get myself a yoga ball.<eos> Did you call the public library like I asked?<eos> -I... I did.
Thanks a lot.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I'm telling you, these people are something else.<eos> You want a coffee?<eos> Do you want a coffee?<eos> D... do y... you want a f... fucking c... coffee?<eos> Yes, thanks.<eos> Cost me 800 bucks.<eos> - Does it fit in your house?<eos> - Sure it does.
I won't say it again!<eos> Close all the exits and stop all the trains.<eos> Exits and trains!<eos> Now!<eos> Come on, move it!<eos> Sesmillo, read.<eos> 96 civil lawsuits against the police, 21 treated by paramedics, 2 cervical injuries.<eos> 567,000 euros in losses, complaints from 7 embassies and a man with a fractured hip.<eos> - We'll take responsibility but we got him.<eos> - No, Alfaro, we don't.
'She said she'd be straight back.'<eos> I'll be back before the broadcast.<eos> - Violet<eos> - I'll be back before the broadcast.<eos> She's the frigging maid.<eos> 'Maybe your sins can be covered up in this lifetime.'<eos> But eventually, we all pay for our sins.<eos> - 'Violet.' - 'I love you.'<eos> - 'She said she loved me.'<eos> - Of course I do.

- I don't really have the... - I'm sorry.<eos> I've spent years trying to convince myself that things happen for a reason, that you and I were not meant to be.<eos> But I know now.<eos> That wasn't fate.<eos> It was a choice.<eos> My choice.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm alone in the world, Matthew.<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> Of course you do.
Well, sweetheart, you don't break into my house and then talk to me about trust.<eos> Don't overthink it.<eos> It's just a bunch of guys in business suits.<eos> They won't know what hit them.<eos> Would be fun, like old times.<eos> Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, not anymore.
Castle's awake.<eos> Soon, he'll plead guilty, then it's open and shut.<eos> Open and shut is good.<eos> New York will sleep better knowing Frank Castle's behind bars.<eos> I know I will.<eos> Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.
I understand you're frantic, you're looking for answers.<eos> I have none.<eos> Sometimes I'm glad I'm... in here.<eos> The fate of New York City is out of my hands for once.<eos> That's bullshit!<eos> I don't know what you expect from me... but we're finished here.<eos> Mr. Donovan.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> You asked me if I remember the art gallery.<eos> I do.
And when he does, I wanna be here.<eos> Of course, you do.<eos> Claire, what do you... what do you expect from me, all right?<eos> I'm flailing here. A dead guy... A guy I witnessed burned to death, is somehow back in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> All right? On top of that, Frank Castle kills the DA, and Wilson Fisk runs the prison that I sent him to.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I went there.<eos> Busy boy.<eos> Oh, jeez. I thought it could work.<eos> I did.
He told me I was out of control.<eos> They don't get to tell you what you are.<eos> But you said the same thing.<eos> Well, I was wrong. No one gets to tell you.<eos> But it makes sense, right?<eos> No.<eos> Only if you let it.<eos> It explains everything.<eos> You knew all along.<eos> Yeah, I did.
The enemy had set up an ambush at the only LZ that would accommodate one of our birds.<eos> Sorry, Colonel?<eos> LZ is a landing zone that can accommodate a helicopter.<eos> So the enemy, they block this landing zone, knowing it was the only shot the team had to get out alive.<eos> All they had to do was wait.<eos> They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
Even with only a partial induction, you were the greatest of our hunters, Chronos.<eos> After we're finished, temporal criminals and time pirates alike will quake at the sound of your bootsteps.<eos> Mm, well, for your sake, you better hope that plan works.<eos> 'Cause if it doesn't, that boot's gonna crush your skull.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - Our Holy of Holies.<eos> The Oculus viewing chamber, our most powerful window into past, present, and future.<eos> The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.
Just turned 22.<eos> She went missing catering a Players' Club event.<eos> Players' Club?<eos> It's one of those skeezy pickup artist groups.<eos> You know, that teach geeks how to be sex gods.<eos> Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
Why don't we chat in my office, okay?<eos> Follow me.<eos> We heard that you control the docks, and if anything goes down, Los Diablos are in on it. Really?<eos> We're just a riding club, okay?<eos> Whose members have been arrested for guns, drugs, murder.<eos> A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?<eos> But it does paint you as suspects.<eos> Hey, look, just because we have a reputation as outlaws doesn't mean we had anything to do with a murder.<eos> You like being considered a criminal, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Ask him yourself.<eos> Where you kids off to?<eos> Just having some shawarma.<eos> Then back to campus.<eos> You're at the vet school?<eos> I came down there once with my pig, he had the flu.<eos> Flu's bad for pigs. But he's better now.<eos> You have a pig in your truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all do.
Afraid.<eos> I know.<eos> I once went to sleep for a long time, too.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> But when I woke up, I wasn't alone.<eos> You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Ms. Grant didn't send me. I came because I have never seen your mother like this before.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Scared.<eos> - Of not getting enough retweets?<eos> - No... No, of losing you again.<eos> Hey, she did just fine for 25 years.<eos> Or, she was really good at pretending.<eos> I know you think your mom is this heartless, narcissistic monster...<eos> - Your words...<eos> - Some days, I do too.
This started because it wanted me dead, my race gone.<eos> If I'm all that's left, let it have me.<eos> No, this murderer does not get to win.<eos> And you don't get to give up. It will save Alex.<eos> We don't choose.<eos> We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
- $15.99.<eos> - Grace?<eos> Phil.<eos> Phil.<eos> Who were you expecting?<eos> You.<eos> I mean, it is your house.<eos> And I-I-I...<eos> I thought I-- that I might run into you here.<eos> Well, you did.
Tell me why you wanted him dead.<eos> Amanda.<eos> You came to see Sidney.<eos> That's why you were in Cambridge.<eos> He got a pasting off your husband, did you know that?<eos> I didn't know. ls he all right?<eos> He'll never get over you, though.<eos> (sums) Do you want him to be happy?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Course I do.
Give Gary the strength to trust in you in the dark as well as the light.<eos> And let him remember that Jesus was a prisoner too, and he will be with him always.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I keep dreaming that I'm falling.<eos> And then... yank.<eos> It is going to be all right.<eos> You just have to tell the truth.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Nobody does.
He's in prison.<eos> Not as of two weeks ago.<eos> He just finished doing every single day of his time, so no probation officers to keep tabs on him.<eos> Emile gets out two weeks ago, and the gun comes back.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.<eos> Hey.<eos> Maybe we drag up all this old crap, and we don't find the shooter.<eos> Or maybe we do.
Thanks for the, uh, heads-up on the upcoming lawsuit, Goldman.<eos> Geez. I hate this guy.<eos> Did you know Tamika Weaver?<eos> For most of my life, yes.<eos> She's from the neighborhood, and I had the privilege of baptizing her four years ago.<eos> When was the last time you saw Tamika?<eos> I thought Tamika may have been at our fellowship dinner last night.<eos> Taco Mondays.<eos> We bring in a mostly Mexican menu so our Latino friends feel encouraged to join.<eos> - And many of them do.
Emma has plenty of female role models.<eos> First of all, there's you. And my mom.<eos> Hey, who's got some pot?<eos> 'Cause Bonnie Wheeler needs a dealer.<eos> Well, one female role model is good enough.<eos> I threw my back out at Pilates.<eos> It's killing me.<eos> I was trying to get extra bendy for my honeymoon with Brad, if you know what I mean.<eos> Well, you got a guy 15 years younger than you, so I think Bendy Bonnie knows what she's doing.<eos> Yeah, she does.
There's been a lot of change.<eos> But... this can still be a good thing for us.<eos> We have to move on.<eos> I can't.<eos> Sorry, Mum, but we were part of something. We... saved them.<eos> I can't move on, and why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does.
♪ Saved his Lobsong ♪<eos> ♪ From his... ♪<eos> ♪ Right is right ♪<eos> He would be dead.<eos> You were so right, Gene.<eos> This guy is a dipshit.<eos> Right is right!<eos> Yeah!<eos> - I saved him!<eos> - You did!
- Big deal!<eos> Very impressive.<eos> - Me? - Yeah, you're a very surprising woman.<eos> You're almost like a... How do you say...<eos> A complete person.<eos> Yeah, oh, yeah, I'm a person.<eos> Okay, well, let's take my helicopter to my yacht.<eos> Oh, don't you wanna hang out and see who wins?<eos> Uh, spoiler alert...<eos> My car does.
The yam pipeline.<eos> Is that all you want?<eos> I...<eos> Well, you know--<eos> Whatever you're afraid of happening, it's already happened.<eos> I think you like me as much as I like you.<eos> I do like you.<eos> But?<eos> I didn't say "but."<eos> Yeah, you did.
What people?<eos> Your patients.<eos> You can't use your thumbs to spin the wheel, dumbasses.<eos> - They always use their thumbs. - Oh.<eos> Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than.<eos> What if they're more than us?<eos> What?<eos> Do you believe them? Your patients.<eos> Just between you and me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Hmm.
Everything cleaned out if you need anything. - Business good?<eos> - Yeah, it's good.<eos> - I got something for you...<eos> - No, no, no. Hold onto that.<eos> - Okay, all right.<eos> - Empty the register on the weekend.<eos> All right, no problem, son.<eos> How your mom feeling now?<eos> Oh, she doing good. She doing excellent. - Better?<eos> - She doing better.
Move, you're in my spot.<eos> Move.<eos> Give me my fucking money, man.<eos> You saying I'm a liar?<eos> All right.<eos> I ain't say that.<eos> I told you to count what's off and you said it wasn't.<eos> That's you calling me a liar.<eos> Nah, all I did was tell you that...<eos> You... you did what?
Jesse James wanted the money, but he had a real statement he was trying to make that was as much political as it was about robbing banks.<eos> Go.<eos> Everything in your vault.<eos> Open the vault.<eos> - Open the vault.<eos> - Hold on, hold on.<eos> In the corner now.<eos> I know you.<eos> Where'd you fight?<eos> - I didn't.
Come on.<eos> What did you do to my powers?<eos> I need my powers. The Beast is here, okay?<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for you.<eos> He is coming to kill us.<eos> You have got to give me back my power!<eos> I've got to save you!<eos> Do you remember that night?<eos> Um... Your father does.
This is how it must be.<eos> There won't be another chance for me to say this...<eos> James,<eos> I know.<eos> 911 emergency.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can you tell me your location?<eos> Hello?<eos> Whatever happens, trust me.<eos> I do.
So...<eos> And this is what?<eos> A plat map of Calvary's property and the adjoining lot, currently held in trust by Memphis redevelopment.<eos> They have an offer on the table. But I know Calvary's expressed an interest in the past for a pool and community center, I think.<eos> And the city said no.<eos> And the city is prepared to change its mind, which makes this, we think, a very exciting time.<eos> This Sunday would be great.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Basie Skanks ain't got no pool.<eos> No. He doesn't.
No.<eos> Because he is somebody's son.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> But that doesn't mean that an objective person couldn't see both sides of the situation.<eos> You know, I never thought I'd say this, but thank god for the deacons' board.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they'll never let you do this.<eos> [Laughs] The deacons don't run this church.<eos> You're right.<eos> God does.
Mama's always talking about her evil sister Mavis purveying the devil's music down on Beale Street.<eos> I figured I had to come see for myself.<eos> I used to make you those little Shirley Temples, remember?<eos> And you would sit and you would sip on them. So serious.<eos> Mmm. - So dignified.<eos> - Aw. You weren't anything like Mama said.<eos> Nothing is.<eos> Did, um... did Faith ever come in here?<eos> She moved down to this neighborhood, right?<eos> She did.
"Ray, I've treated you like you're the problem ever since our daughter was born.<eos> But you're not.<eos> I am."<eos> I'm going to go see her and we're going to talk.<eos> What is there to talk about?<eos> Whatever I want.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> This whole "You don't have any rights, Ray"?<eos> That's over, because you did screw up.<eos> You did.
- I know I have one, but we're talking about the church here, Mae, a place where our shield and our strength, as you put it, is in the Lord, not in some two-pound handful of deadly metal.<eos> Listen, if you think Basie Skanks is a thorn in your side, just let one more person be shot at this church.<eos> Mac, don't you agree?<eos> I think the liability issues are tricky, but I'm not flat-out opposed to guns in the church.<eos> The Bible also says there's a time for war.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Pastor Greenleaf?<eos> You must have an opinion on this.<eos> Oh, Lord, here we go.<eos> I don't, actually.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you every little detail of what was going on every day.<eos> No, I know. You handle things.<eos> Nobody knows that better than I do.<eos> You want me to talk to James?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'll deal with him, and I'll send him up here so y'all can make the peace man-to-man one last time.<eos> Oh. You do believe me, don't you?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I do.
No, I know. You handle things.<eos> Nobody knows that better than I do.<eos> You want me to talk to James?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'll deal with him, and I'll send him up here so y'all can make the peace man-to-man one last time.<eos> Oh. You do believe me, don't you?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Yeah, and whatever she thinks I'm doing on it.<eos> What are you doing on it, if I can ask?<eos> Just... looking at stuff.<eos> - Have you ever cheated?<eos> - No.<eos> And I don't want to.<eos> That's the whole problem.<eos> When I was a kid, my father would take a walk every night after dinner.<eos> We were never sure he was going to come back.<eos> One night, he just didn't.
You just have to confess.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing out here, honey?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just trying to remember all this for later, if I have to leave.<eos> It's all going to work out.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But I'm going to do my very best to make sure you get to stay... if you want.<eos> Yeah, I do.
There he is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You can see him.<eos> Oh, did... just gonna...<eos> Felicity?<eos> Are you home?<eos> Hank, I'm here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you ring?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Can you get Thomas to take a look at it?<eos> 'Cause if ASD didn't delete my Dalgetty picture, than maybe he can find out who did.<eos> When did I become your research assistant?<eos> Don't pretend you don't wanna know.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is that a new dress?<eos> Yeah, do you like it?<eos> Yeah,<eos> I do.
You give me information in exchange for the information I give you?<eos> Are you planning on retiring as a Senior Constable, Brimmer?<eos> Not if I can help it.<eos> I wanna know about Rankin.<eos> I wanna know if there... were any anomalies in the evidence.<eos> If... there's anything to suggest that... it wasn't a suicide.<eos> What, is this the part where you tell me you know someone who might have wanted him dead?<eos> Cops are generally interested in that kind of stuff.<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> And when you do?
I do not have the moral high ground.<eos> Well, then why are you acting like you do?<eos> Because he knew I could forgive almost anything but this, with her.<eos> Oh, get over yourself.<eos> Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery. -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did. Why-

Why-<eos> - What does it matter now?<eos> It doesn't anymore.
So what's going on with Sol?<eos> I don't want to mention his name around you.<eos> Let's give him a different name.<eos> Paddy.<eos> Paddy told Robert about us.<eos> Robert kicked him out and Paddy showed up at my place.<eos> So you're trying to get away from Paddy?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I don't want to feel sorry for him.<eos> But you do.
Because... for 12 years, I've tried every way-- every wrong and misguided way to win your heart only to realize, in these last very dark weeks, you wanted something else.<eos> So you picked someone else.<eos> Which means that part of us together is over... for good.<eos> I'm glad that that is clear between us.<eos> Well, there's not a lot we know about St. Joseph.<eos> He was Jesus' earthly father.<eos> He, uh, dreamed a lot, and, well, in those dreams, he was visited by angels.<eos> And, uh, one day, an angel appeared to him and told him that he must take the Virgin Mary as his wife.<eos> Does everyone understand what--<eos> They do not.
- What do you think?<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> I love you, Ledda.<eos> I love you, too, Wade.<eos> Now you're the one lying to me.<eos> - Well, he's gone now.<eos> - That's all that matters, right?<eos> Gone how?<eos> Your fa thinks you've killed him.<eos> So did I.
It exposed the worst in human behaviour. He had a choice.<eos> Some men seek not the right path but the safest one.<eos> Some men believe only in survival, no matter what the costs.<eos> Your father made the right decision.<eos> The difficult decision.<eos> It doesn't change what his father did, but it shows that he learned.<eos> Now you must do for your father what he could not do for his.<eos> You need to forgive him.<eos> What good does my forgiveness<eos> - do him now?
Drink me, Quintus, and use me and your strength to escape.<eos> Do not fight him.<eos> There will be another opportunity to defeat him.<eos> But not here.<eos> Not now.<eos> You must escape.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> The Master cannot love. So he takes it from others, feeds upon it, along with their blood.<eos> I don't know if you can feel love, Quintus. But I can.<eos> And I do.
Except he was speaking English.<eos> Out loud.<eos> Always the technicalities with you.<eos> If they're talking, we will hear them.<eos> The question is, will we hear the Master talking back?<eos> We just need to look for anomalies, anything that breaks the established communication patterns.<eos> You never rendered your opinion on Captain Rogers.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You know, Fet's new comrade-in-arms.<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
It looks like you knowingly led a team of agents in here with a fraudulent warrant.<eos> You need to let me explain.<eos> No, you need to meet me downstairs, both of you.<eos> These agents will make sure you don't get into anymore trouble.<eos> Mr. Graff, I want to assure you none of this was approved by the Bureau.<eos> Just talk to my lawyers.<eos> Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.

Bring her to Peng's.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> Just trust me.<eos> Gracie is in trouble.<eos> Just let me go. Let me get out.<eos> Please let me go get her.<eos> We're just taking you in, okay?<eos> You hit someone? !<eos> No, I didn't hit someone.<eos> How you doing, kiddo?
Why?<eos> I expected that call every day for 15 years.<eos> Because the Jimmy Pritchard I knew was no quitter.<eos> So I asked Mary if I could use her company to help find out what really happened.<eos> And you did.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> 'Cause Dad asked me to keep an eye on you.<eos> I've got information on these killings.<eos> Do you want it or not?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Otto, now.<eos> I was reborn in blood, and I will...<eos> You talk too much.<eos> We should go.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's all right, sweetie.<eos> Let him carry you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
I'd like her to sell me the car.<eos> Ms. Solodar doesn't do sales.<eos> She owns the dealership.<eos> Well, no offense, Lenny, but now I've shaken hands with a little girl.<eos> I'd like to make a deal with a real woman.<eos> Alexa, there should be 14 new products at the new production presentation, but I only see 13 new products on this list.<eos> Why was this one removed?<eos> Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.
You want to be like your father?<eos> Make that go away.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> I'm gonna walk a little ways over here and put the two of you in the ground where I put Ray after I killed him.<eos> I can't find the other two men.<eos> Where are the heartbeats coming from?<eos> You think it's easy being a woman in the drug business?<eos> I built this business up. I earned this money.<eos> And no Pritchard, living or dead, is gonna take that away from me.<eos> How you doing, Solly?
And they were everywhere in the comunas.<eos> The spotters could identify which streets to take and which ones to avoid.<eos> All yours.<eos> Where are we?<eos> -What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon?<eos> -Get down and hide.<eos> -Jhon, I don't--<eos> -Shit, Maritza,<eos> I don't have time to give you explanations.<eos> Just do it, all right?
Me too.<eos> I'm gonna kiss you now.<eos> Jo.<eos> Still got that beer you promised me?<eos> Yeah, 'course.<eos> Come in.<eos> So... this is how tuna fish feel.<eos> Minus the mercury.<eos> So did you make the tournament?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
Excuse me.<eos> Well, here we are.<eos> You wore this yesterday evening?<eos> Yes, until just after dinner, when I changed into what I'm wearing now before I started work.<eos> You didn't go out after eight o'clock? I stayed in my office until about, ooh, er...er... ..half past three in the morning, maybe four o'clock.<eos> May I see your whole wardrobe?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Last autumn, your tailor made you a suit in this material.<eos> Do you remember it?<eos> Hmm, yes, I do.
If Kenton is your father, Alexa, do you know where he is?<eos> I don't mean to be harsh, but his family never mentioned you.<eos> They don't know about me.<eos> I didn't even know until last week.<eos> Mr Marshall... dad, had a thing with my mom, back in the day.<eos> She got pregnant, he didn't want to know.<eos> She never really talked about it.<eos> And then last year she put me in that school.<eos> My mom was afraid something might happen to her.<eos> And it did.
I hope we're watching this together. Laughing.<eos> That's when she told me about my real dad.<eos> His name is Kenton Marshall.<eos> That's why I sent you to that school.<eos> In case you ever need it, he's a good man.<eos> He'll look after you.<eos> I didn't have nowhere else to go.<eos> I didn't know how he was gonna react.<eos> If he'd even recognize her, after all these years.<eos> But he did.
- Denise!<eos> Okay.<eos> Yesterday, you said that you were gonna draw boundaries - and spend more time with me.<eos> - I-I know.<eos> But instead, you blew me off and... and spent the night at work, curled up with your ex?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, but I-I am so sorry, you know?<eos> And... and all I can think of to say is...<eos> You sure look pretty after a 5k run.<eos> Do you know how long a 'k' is?<eos> Because I did not.
- This is a waste of time.<eos> - Attrition, Mr. Warner.<eos> What?<eos> Your guests were led past Kate's body in a pool of blood.<eos> It's a miracle anybody went back to work at all.<eos> We're a family.<eos> Still, most people don't come that close to violence and remain unscathed.<eos> You seem to be handling it rather well.<eos> I don't have a choice, Detective.<eos> Your employees do.
I don't take shots at where you live.<eos> Where do you live?<eos> Just south of here.<eos> Gorgeous doorman building, very hip, full of beautiful people.<eos> Hey, you know what might help the vibe in this place?<eos> One of those chairs shaped like a giant hand.<eos> You know? And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.<eos> Do we have a match on your dating app?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Oh, fuck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to call Tasha.<eos> Set up a meet.<eos> I need her to sign some paperwork.<eos> Hey, how did things go with Tariq the other night?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> Ghost did.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> Mmm, smells delicious.<eos> What are you making?<eos> You went to see Tasha?<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> After hearing your conversation this morning and knowing how much you miss the kids, it seemed like the right thing to do.<eos> I had good intentions.<eos> I appreciate you taking care of Tariq's record, but you should ask me before you go over there.<eos> I don't need to ask for your permission, Jamie.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach I was talking about.<eos> Was it Pete Dreyer?<eos> Congressman Dreyer's been a mentor for years.<eos> - He had no right to tell you.<eos> - He had every right.<eos> If a member of the House Intelligence Committee chooses to share information with me, he's at liberty to do so.<eos> Our conversation was in confidence.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are, and he spoke to me because he wants to help.<eos> And so do I, General.
No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> My friend, you like?<eos> I can make you a deal. I can...<eos> I can make you an offer.<eos> See, Hassan, this type of behavior... this suggests to us something we call "avoidance and transference".<eos> It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying. Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!
Nothing.<eos> My friend, you like?<eos> I can make you a deal. I can...<eos> I can make you an offer.<eos> See, Hassan, this type of behavior... this suggests to us something we call "avoidance and transference".<eos> It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying. Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!<eos> I did!
No.<eos> Uh, you know what, Dylan? I'm...<eos> I'm just upset.<eos> I, uh... all is good, actually.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Never mind, Dylan. Okay.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> You need me to break you out of here?<eos> I can totally do it, I mean, I've studied how to do it.<eos> No, I-I don't.
The more we talk about it, the less sure I'll be, so let's just do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's an override switch on every stabilizer ring.<eos> - I'll create the vortex.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you flip all of them.<eos> They should all reboot.<eos> Got it.<eos> Once that's done, you power up the cannon. - The breach should stabilize.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
Come on.<eos> You're here.<eos> I got you this.<eos> Not Moscato, but some shit Drake would like.<eos> Why are you assuming I like Drake?<eos> Every black girl that went to college likes Drake.<eos> He just really gets us.<eos> I'm not a dumb bitch!<eos> I never said you were.<eos> No, you didn't.
I could tell him that you feel unwell?<eos> Here she is!<eos> Good evening, Sir Leicester.<eos> You look sparkling as ever.<eos> And tell me, Inspector, were we correct?<eos> Is the killer a simple man with a family pushed to breaking point.<eos> Suffice to say that discovering their identity has brought me no pleasure.<eos> None at all.<eos> - The killer pleads self-defence?<eos> - They do.
Who the hell is that?<eos> I'm trying to tell you that Kenny Loggins never bought your painting.<eos> I made the whole thing up.<eos> What?<eos> You were having such a hard time with your art.<eos> Your kiln had exploded.<eos> You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!
Carnahan.<eos> Yeah. Yeah. OK.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> We got to go.<eos> I have a briefing.<eos> For what?<eos> Some Health Department thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> _<eos> How you doing, Lex?
Yeah?<eos> Well, keep it to yourself.<eos> Put gloves on and lower your visor. Don't touch anything or anyone.<eos> - Officer Riley?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jim banks, EIS.<eos> You take the lead. Not sure who these people trust less, doctors or cops.<eos> Atlanta PD.<eos> You speak English?<eos> Yes. I do.
It would have been fine if things had gone to plan.<eos> Lose your gloves.<eos> You touched him, with your gloves.<eos> Thought this thing was only transmitted through fluids.<eos> MAN: You cage us like animals and leave us out here to die!<eos> - WOMAN:<eos> Open up! - Today...<eos> We're getting out!<eos> Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child.<eos> And they didn't!
_<eos> Mom, have you seen my cards?<eos> Check under your cot, baby. Thanks.<eos> I think it looks prettier down.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> Who says I'm trying to look prettier?<eos> Maybe I want to look smart or kind or funny.<eos> You like him, don't you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Do you?
Oh, my...<eos> The gang... they had an APD sat phone.<eos> Meese just fell in?<eos> With one of the department's only sat phones?<eos> Chief.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> She's working with the chief.<eos> - What?<eos> No. - Yes.<eos> No. That doesn't even...
Check my blood.<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> Everybody synchronize your watches.<eos> 40 minutes until those tunnels are destroyed.<eos> Dad, I can't talk right now.<eos> Son, I found him.<eos> - I found Leo.<eos> - That's great, Dad.<eos> You know I never doubted you.<eos> Sure you did.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Over my dead body.<eos> Look, just 'cause you're stuck in this lab all day doesn't mean I should be too.<eos> Over my rotting corpse.<eos> Look, what happened to trying new things, meeting new people?<eos> You said I should start a life here, right?<eos> And Zoom's over there, and we're over here, so there's nothing to worry about.<eos> There's always something to worry about.<eos> Okay, well, you said Barry and them are good people and I should get to know them.<eos> - I did.
You know, if this hadn't have happened, we probably wouldn't have even spoken to each other.<eos> I bet you thought I was a loser.<eos> I didn't know you then.<eos> What do you know now?<eos> That there's a lot more to you than that guy who used to bang his head against a window at school.<eos> And you know a lot about yams.<eos> Oh, sexy!<eos> And... ..you make me feel... ..better about myself.<eos> I like that.<eos> Yeah, so do I.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> I don't want to feel scared or responsible for someone else with all this going on.<eos> You're freaking out about everything.<eos> We all are. It's more than that.<eos> Even before all this happened, I was changing and he was staying the same.<eos> - He wants us to have kids.<eos> - Now?<eos> I don't know, but I don't even want to think about kids.<eos> Of course you don't.
It's in a safety deposit box at the bank, which is closed right now, but I can grab it for you first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> Okay, these documents release your rights to the house so that I can buy it back under my name.<eos> So my signature gets you something you want?<eos> Correct.<eos> Where's the paper that gets me what I want?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, I wanted a wife who wasn't a lying, cheating sack of shit, but I guess that's impossible, so...<eos> I'll settle for an explanation.<eos> I want to know why you think I owe you anything.<eos> You don't.
Aurora has the keys.<eos> Good.<eos> Gun.<eos> - Why would I give you a gun?<eos> - You need help.<eos> I can help.<eos> What do you know about guns?<eos> You aim and squeeze and your target dies.<eos> How do I know I can I trust you?<eos> You don't yet.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, assuming we can get him face to face, why doesn't he just arrest us?<eos> Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason.<eos> - What photos?<eos> - I told him we had photos - of her fraternizing with me.<eos> - But we don't.
Well, we know where he is now.<eos> Although, we've all fallen for that trap before.<eos> This time we've got the advantage.<eos> This note's addressed to three of us.<eos> Grimaud thinks D'Artagnan's dead.<eos> The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?
- Me.<eos> Yeah, I know. I just... I don't know why.<eos> Well, you must have done something to piss him off.<eos> - Satellite hasn't found anything.<eos> - We need to find a more permanent solution to this problem.<eos> Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.<eos> That's about as good a first step as any.<eos> - I got some parts for it.<eos> You don't know how to stop a Time Wraith?<eos> None of us do.
Ann, you will have this orgasm, if it's the last thing I do.<eos> Well, not me personally.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Okay, I think that's all for today.<eos> I think these ideas are exactly what you're looking for, for the dining room... warm, not stuffy... though it matters more what you think, right?<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I love it all.<eos> Oh, I am so glad.<eos> So, why does it look like you actually don't love it?<eos> I really do.
Everything that we've talked about is right up her alley...<eos> I mean, except for a couple things.<eos> First of all, no yellow.<eos> She hates yellow... and animals.<eos> I guess the giraffe wallpaper is out of the question.<eos> So, why are we at the opening of... what is this?<eos> ... the NuTunes Music Fest?<eos> Obviously you didn't see Gawker this morning.<eos> Oh, the Jennifer Jones post?<eos> I did.
That's harsh.<eos> Yeah, that... that sounds harsh.<eos> Were you the one who leaked them?<eos> That's what you found on his phone?<eos> I thought you were just gonna get his contacts.<eos> Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.
There are a million publicists in this town, so if working with your fiancée is a problem for you, then we don't.<eos> You can blame it on me if you like.<eos> It's your call.<eos> There are lots of other agents out there, Dr. Kim.<eos> Not really.<eos> Not when your first book was only somewhat successful.<eos> I can't afford to take another year off to write something on spec, and I don't know how to get another deal without an agent.<eos> Maybe I should give up.<eos> Maybe I don't have another book in me.<eos> Of course you do.
Did you see the monstrosity in our living room?<eos> What monstrosity?<eos> - There's a monstrosity?<eos> - Come here.<eos> Holy...<eos> Yeah. It's a little bit extravagant, don't you think?<eos> Not to mention a blatant disregard for public safety.<eos> _<eos> - I lo... I love it so much.<eos> - Of course you do.
What?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> ! - Is that Stacey North?<eos> - Yep.<eos> That's her.<eos> Oh, why is she licking the bagels and putting them back?<eos> I don't know. I wish that there was some answer that I could give you to that question that made sense.<eos> Well, don't they say that all press is good press?<eos> Yeah. Do they really?
It's... It's... It's not working.<eos> I need a break, okay?<eos> - Hey, Karen.<eos> - Hey. I picked up some fruit at the farmer's market.<eos> So, how was last night?<eos> Did you have a date?<eos> Of course not.<eos> When was the last time I had a date?<eos> But you said you had plans.<eos> I did.
Because you know that would be crazy.<eos> - And stupid.<eos> - And crazy.<eos> Okay, I'm just blowing off some steam here.<eos> Are you gonna get that?<eos> Kidding!<eos> Believing.<eos> Hi, Adam.<eos> Hey, little one.<eos> How you doing?
- No, no.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> What a sleazeball!<eos> No, no.<eos> I-It's not like that.<eos> She's 14.<eos> He's a father-figure to her.<eos> They, um, have a relationship.<eos> We don't.<eos> They do, but we, uh, don't.
This is insane.<eos> You just think that because you're high as a kite right now.<eos> Am I? Mmhmm.<eos> I feel pretty normal.<eos> I don't think there was any drugs in that coffee. Hold on.<eos> Let me try something.<eos> Listen to the sound of my voice.<eos> You love prison.<eos> You want to go back to prison.<eos> No, I don't.
It's okay. And you really outed yourself with the whole "Wedding Planner" thing.<eos> It's such a bad movie, but I love it so much.<eos> Want to hang out later?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah. Um, I... I would like that.<eos> Okay.<eos> And look at that.<eos> I thought this was going to be hard, but it turns out ning up a date is easy.<eos> Don't I need your number or something?<eos> Yeah. No, yeah, definitely you do.
Said we wake any more ghosts from Quitman, it all comes out.<eos> So that's it.<eos> We're out. We're done.<eos> We ain't letting you go down for murder.<eos> Nothing's worth any of us gettin' locked up again.<eos> You telling me you've been hauling this secret around for 18 years?<eos> Never said anything to anybody?<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't believe me, Gil?<eos> No, I do.
- Mm-mm. Can you rope an ass?<eos> Uh...<eos> No.<eos> I... I've...<eos> No, I've never done that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> People love a good roped ass.<eos> - Hmm. - A well-roped ass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My ex-wife sure did.
What do you think?<eos> Leo?<eos> The fig?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think it's fine.<eos> I don't like the figure of the fig.<eos> It's key that we choose a tree we have here.<eos> If we stick to shooting the spot here under a tree.<eos> We do.
Mm, and what we're gonna do is, we're gonna play Micki's favorite Heathens song of all time,<eos> "Ain't No Valentine,"<eos> and, honey, you're gonna play Micki's percussion part.<eos> - With what?<eos> - These. I had this buddy of mine at Steve Maxwell's do a rush job last night putting Micki's ashes into these maracas so she's gonna be with us forever, or at least until next time we go to Cleveland.<eos> [maracas rattling]<eos> They sound amazing, baby.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Yeah. - Did you get to see the ashes?<eos> - Yes, I did.
We'll see.<eos> How was the turnout at service this mornin'?<eos> They'll be back.<eos> Is he there?<eos> Jesus, come on, Rev. Didn't you do enough damage the other night?<eos> I want him to see me on my feet. For him to know that I've beat the count.<eos> Round two.<eos> You really think he's the devil?<eos> You saw what he did to me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I think you know.<eos> What is it?<eos> He has Amber.<eos> Kyle, wait.<eos> This is about more than us.<eos> He is a false prophet.<eos> If we don't stop him, the devil will reign for a thousand years.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> That that man is the devil and that you have to stop him, no matter what?<eos> Yes, I do.
What?<eos> No! No one can see this.<eos> I'm not playing with our lives anymore.<eos> Give me the damn computer!<eos> Annalise Keating.<eos> What can I help you with? - Philip Jessup.<eos> - [Door closes]<eos> Wish I had something.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Now you do.
Oh, and a bottle of Riesling.<eos> Your best.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel like the devil.<eos> - Did it work?<eos> - She's thinking about it.<eos> She'll say yes.<eos> My point is I might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins. Mm.<eos> You have to believe in God for that.<eos> Or maybe you do now.
What the hell was that?<eos> - I did you a favor.<eos> - How?<eos> He freaked out at the idea we framed Catherine, so imagine if he knew the truth.<eos> You chopping up Sam's body, for example...<eos> Stop.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're welcome for saving your relationship.<eos> I thought you stopped drinking.<eos> I did.
Wait.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> What's better than sex?<eos> You think I'm a gigolo?<eos> I know what you are.<eos> So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay Annalise Keating's bitch?<eos> Frank.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> We found her.<eos> Well, Oliver did.
All right, check this out.<eos> Do you hear me right now?<eos> If you ever disrespect me like that again, I will kill you.<eos> I will kill you.<eos> I swear to God, shit will get real, okay?<eos> I guess this is supposed to prove she was the shooter, huh?<eos> Well, 300,000 tweets say yes.<eos> The department hasn't even confirmed the victim yet. Ugh.<eos> Louise likes her.<eos> Of course she does.
They were putting it on ice.<eos> You love it, don't you?<eos> The roll of the dice.<eos> The highs are great, but the lows...<eos> Sometimes I think it's only the pain of the lows that lets me actually feel something.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't think I ever have.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Harry!<eos> Jimmy does.
Livable weather, edible food, cable TV, but you know what it did have?<eos> Windows.<eos> So if you don't know and saw your little... little extracurricular activities, you'd be very mistaken foxes.<eos> I was above average for a fox.<eos> Okay, I've studied enough for one day.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> It ain't my fault, or my problem.<eos> For the record, you do see that you're doing wrong, though?<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> But if I hypothetically did...
Bonnie already slipped out of bed.<eos> She's so sweet not to wake me.<eos> I'm the executor of the will, that's why I came to see you.<eos> That's just... ugh, that's horrible.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Tad's dead.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm a big note taker.<eos> He was on a spiritual quest around the world to find himself.<eos> Sadly, he did...
Where the fuck are we going?<eos> - I gotta get out of here.<eos> - You're not going anywhere.<eos> I gotta see Belle.<eos> I just missed my plane for you.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> God.<eos> I'm sorry you missed your plane.<eos> You like your new job?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
That's why they took her.<eos> Where did they take her?<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Let me go!<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior, but nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.
You'd know if they didn't.<eos> What have you got this silly thing on for?<eos> - What the fuck are you doing here, man?<eos> - Hey, I just... - These guys smell like weed.<eos> - Fucking Jerry, man.<eos> - You talked to Jerry? - Yeah.<eos> Hey, you... you don't happen to have a corkscrew on you, do you?<eos> Me?<eos> No. No, I don't... that's... he does.<eos> We do at our house, but not...
Previously on Tyrant...<eos> This land you betrayed me for, your own brother, I give it to you.<eos> Jamal!<eos> You found him in the desert?<eos> Get your father.<eos> And don't talk about this to anyone.<eos> The sons of Tal Jiza will become soldiers in the Army of the Caliphate.<eos> I thought this wasn't my fight. I was wrong.<eos> Come back, okay?<eos> If you don't...
There's no room for the sound waves to travel.<eos> Look, sound board isn't the problem if you catch my drift.<eos> Yeah, and what drift is that?<eos> You got a problem with the sound, you take it up with your kids.<eos> Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> You... you don't know me, okay? And I've been working on myself, so I'm gonna let that go, even though you're saying something about my boys.<eos> It's about your boys all right.<eos> It's about your boys sucking.<eos> Who says that? !<eos> I just did!
My family has been through a lot, Mr. Gilbert.<eos> And you are right about John.<eos> Through it all, he has been the one constant holding it all together.<eos> So, I appreciate you coming here.<eos> I respect your experience and your insight. But my brother knows what he wants, and we are going to do this John's way.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> John is quick to invoke your father. But he's not the one most like Robert.<eos> Here's your money, Dad.<eos> How did you pay?<eos> I didn't.
I didn't know they were gonna do that.<eos> They told me later that they had to to make it look real.<eos> They said she was gonna be okay, and she was.<eos> And they knew that after I was rescued, I would be taken to Quantico for questioning.<eos> - What?<eos> - I could get them information about the campus... entrances, exits, how many guards.<eos> The more they talked about this attack, the more I knew what I was doing was wrong.<eos> But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.

Just ask for him.<eos> Before Quantico, I went to law school in New Haven.<eos> My advisor was a retired federal judge... Alan Handler.<eos> A real liberal lion.<eos> He and some other fellows had this rotating poker game.<eos> Now, you would think that these brilliant legal minds would know how to bluff. But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
Can you talk later in person, maybe after you meet with Morgan?<eos> Yeah, but at the café in case you're right and they're watching me.<eos> All right.<eos> Are JT and Heather okay?<eos> Yeah, they're fine, and don't worry.<eos> They didn't say anything.<eos> Well, they don't know anything.<eos> Well, they know about beasts, so...<eos> But DHS doesn't.<eos> Only Hill did.
Hurry up!<eos> Those barrels of black powder.<eos> What's their destination?<eos> The capital.<eos> Back to work.<eos> What now?<eos> I saw wagons filled with those barrels on a road that doesn't lead to Cambulac.<eos> And you know every road to Cambulac?<eos> It's my home.<eos> Of course I do.
He'd never do anything you didn't want him to.<eos> I am going to talk to Wynnstay about his press coverage.<eos> I should call the store.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - No, I'll do it.<eos> - You're supposed to be resting.<eos> I can manage.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> Grace, come on, we're leaving.<eos> Gordon, don't.
Lord Wynnstay.<eos> He lives.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm not retiring. Not nearly.<eos> I don't wanna see that story again.<eos> We'll try not to fall off anything else.<eos> If you must, let me know in advance, I'll hold the front page.<eos> Did you just come here to tell me off?<eos> You didn't say what you're going to be doing about that Sergei story?<eos> No... I didn't.
I worked at Corleys. Also as a machinist.<eos> References?<eos> I thought that I only needed current employer.<eos> Character references, can you get them?<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you make that dress yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did you find the pattern?<eos> I didn't.
Okay.<eos> Really consider this before you react.<eos> We cut off Milo's hands and we leave him on the boat.<eos> Look, Jesús cuts of hands and feet, right?<eos> Milo's already lost his feet so we just leave him on the boat and then it'll look like a drug deal gone bad.<eos> Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time.<eos> That's... actually... a smart idea.<eos> All right.<eos> This is all I could find.<eos> I did the feet.
We've got...<eos> The Long Surrender. Autumn Conquest.<eos> JOHN: I needed to have serious books recorded sensibly.<eos> Uh... What about anthropology and sociology?<eos> All that was basically available in the United Kingdom was detective novels and romantic fiction.<eos> Well, I'm interested in reading contemporary social sciences.<eos> No, look, how do blind people read big books?<eos> They said, "They don't."<eos> Anyway, um, I'll sort it out, so thanks for your advice.<eos> They don't.
Maybe you should go.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they find you here.<eos> I'd rather they found me here than anywhere else.<eos> Catherine, I'm done running.<eos> But what if DHS has found Braxton's tapes?<eos> I'm screwed either way.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Hill set you up, Braxton set you up.<eos> Come on, it doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does, Vincent.
She can't do that.<eos> Well, I don't think it's a great idea, but she keeps going on about how they were all very nice to her, the other people, and them that ran it.<eos> I mean, they are a legitimate business. It doesn't matter.<eos> What, employing trafficked women?<eos> No, that's...<eos> The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her. The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.
I only found out two days before.<eos> He was... He was ten.<eos> Ten years old.<eos> OK.<eos> So I sent him a present.<eos> I left it on the doorstep with a card inside.<eos> From you.<eos> It was expensive, something I knew he'd like.<eos> Racing cars.<eos> And he did.
And we need to take advantage of it.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Gil!<eos> Hey, Jessie... hey, you want to do this, all right, he's got a point...<eos> you have to be careful. I know.<eos> I will.<eos> But we need answers, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
It was an honest mistake.<eos> You're getting a pass.<eos> Wait. You skipped a bunch of stuff.<eos> First I'm supposed to say that I see the error of my ways, and then you tell me that that's not good enough, and then you judge me harder.<eos> And then I say something mean but true that totally throws you off balance.<eos> You came out of the Phoenix Stone, but you thought you were still inside of it.<eos> Everybody understands.<eos> That's pretty generous considering I just stabbed your pregnant girlfriend in the chest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Hellstone does a number on you.
No.<eos> They'll just paw at you and annoy you.<eos> If they wanna see you, they can just buy the videos.<eos> - Please?<eos> Pretty please?<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - That's what you said about horseback riding.<eos> I wanna ride a horse.<eos> - I thought you wanted to learn how to make movies.<eos> - I do.
She's been having a hard time lately, and I haven't been very helpful at all, really.<eos> And a gift will help you fix that?<eos> - Right.<eos> It's a bribe.<eos> Well, I can't just say I'm sorry.<eos> Nor should you.<eos> Those words will only mean "I'm not listening.<eos> "I'm not taking accountability, and whatever I did, I will just do it again."<eos> If you truly want to apologize...<eos> I do.
Entirely my fault.<eos> - No. God. This is my mom's brand new car.<eos> Dammit.<eos> I'm sure they'll understand.<eos> Yeah, that would be amazing. But you don't know my parents.<eos> Oh, it's just a fender bender, right?<eos> Nothing too serious.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> These things happen all the time.<eos> No, not to me they don't.
Does anyone else live here?<eos> No.<eos> No, not anymore.<eos> Until yesterday there was a girl with her daughter, they were renting a room upstairs with a terrace.<eos> But they left. They left?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They were... They were looking for an apartment. She said they found one.<eos> - Did they leave an address?<eos> - No.<eos> No, they didn't.
- Trauma 1.<eos> - Dr. Grey.<eos> - And Trauma 3. Dr. Hunt.<eos> Both urgent, not critical.<eos> Do want Hunt first or Grey?<eos> - Dr. Grey told me to come find you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Meredith actually asked for me, or did she just want Neuro in general?<eos> I... I don't remember.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Wake up!<eos> Liz!<eos> Navabi.<eos> What's that, son?<eos> The pass code, it is Navabi.<eos> It's Navabi!<eos> Open the door.<eos> N-A-V-A-B-I. Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Do it!
Who was that guy?<eos> He seemed to know you.<eos> Did he?<eos> I don't know. I've never seen him before in my life.<eos> What, are you jealous?<eos> No, I'm upset, all right? I tried to surprise you with a nice anniversary party.<eos> Yeah, you surprised me, all right.<eos> It obviously didn't please you.<eos> I don't want to talk about this right now, Evan, it's late.<eos> Well, I do.
No problem.<eos> Are you looking for something specific?<eos> I'm looking for a statement from a bank we don't use.<eos> Someone set up an account without authorization?<eos> That's what I'm trying to find out.<eos> I'll start sorting the mail right away... discreetly.<eos> Also...<eos> See what you can find out about Mark Peterson.<eos> He claimed to have a meeting with Kate today.<eos> He did.
She was... She was hard to miss.<eos> Does she sound familiar?<eos> - I know who she is.<eos> - I get it now.<eos> Why Kate was so insistent about meeting Charlie.<eos> She was pregnant.<eos> She told you?<eos> No.<eos> But when I read about her murder, I-I realized she didn't want to give birth to a new baby till she knew that the one she gave up had everything he needed.<eos> I did.
He's looking for his biological father.<eos> He's...<eos> He's not a good guy?<eos> Would have let him down in the worst way.<eos> And his adoptive parents are stellar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted to adopt, too.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought you didn't want kids.<eos> Of course I do.
In China.<eos> A place I knew his supporters would not travel to.<eos> I took the throne from under him.<eos> They say I cheated.<eos> I don't think it's wholly the election Kaidu's after, but humiliation.<eos> He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
- Ish.<eos> This is important. Okay, I need you--<eos> I need to punch you in the throat if you tell me what I need to do.<eos> The Beast is trying to pick us both off. You've got the scars to prove it. I don't understand why we can't just be basic allies.<eos> You can't possibly want to be a dick more than you want to live. I--<eos> What did Plover say in the book? Come on.<eos> First of all, what's-his-name didn't write it.<eos> Plover.<eos> Christopher Plover.<eos> The girl did.
But he's having a benefit to raise money for the Russian Botanical Society in a week.<eos> There's gonna be hundreds of people there, and if we can slip in under cover of the party...<eos> We can steal the seeds.<eos> Look, we could wind up in prison, or worse.<eos> You want to go home, I get it.<eos> Special Agent Harris.<eos> Mrs. Finch. May I come in?<eos> Thank you for having me over.<eos> I assume if you knew anything about Brian's whereabouts, you would tell us, yes?<eos> I don't.
Sorry.<eos> Why are you such a kook tonight?<eos> I feel guilty.<eos> You have nothing to feel guilty about.<eos> All she talked about was the prom, and now I'm the one here and she isn't... And I shouldn't have come tonight.<eos> I should've just stayed home, like I planned.<eos> Ada, your former best friend doesn't know when to close her mouth or her legs.<eos> Does she, Ronald?<eos> No.<eos> No, she doesn't.
What?<eos> That lying bitch was with Trent that night.<eos> She was.<eos> That means she's next.<eos> You should know this will be in the paper tomorrow, and on our site, as soon as the story is written.<eos> Look, Alison, I know that you have a business to run, but this is evidence.<eos> Which I gave you.<eos> Now I'd like my tablet back, please.<eos> We're also talking about the wife of one of my officers here. - He's got a point.<eos> - No, actually, he doesn't.
Probably not. It's not like they visit her or have anything to do with her.<eos> It's super messed up.<eos> - I'm sure they have their reasons.<eos> - Nope, they don't.<eos> - They suck.<eos> That's about it.<eos> - Well, will your friends be at the party?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - But they don't know about you and Rebecca being there.<eos> Yes, they do.
Oh, that makes me feel a whole lot better.<eos> Thanks. - It wasn't his idea.<eos> Great.<eos> - Diesel's crazy.<eos> There's nothing that your brother could've done.<eos> There's a whole lot he could've done, like not frame his brother for someone's murder.<eos> I know.<eos> But you still have the gun, right?<eos> So, it's all gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm kinda interested in someone too.<eos> - Oh really?<eos> Who?<eos> - Wes. Mmm.<eos> I kind of thought that was happening.<eos> He's pretty great, huh?<eos> He's a very... interesting young man.<eos> - You don't like him.<eos> - No, no. I do.<eos> I do.
The bank robbery victim. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Bullet removal's a slippery slope.<eos> One I'm not going down.<eos> Her new mantra is, "if it's not medically necessary." Oh.<eos> So what does Storms say?<eos> He says it's discretionary.<eos> Okay. Well, tell that to the cops.<eos> That bullet could put away the guy who's responsible for this, so...<eos> Speaking as the person who almost got her ass sued off, I'm not diving into a difficult procedure without having any experience.<eos> Well, good thing I do, then.
I can't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, man. Please.<eos> Please.<eos> If I wake you up, and you walk out of here, this thing... this thing could kill you.<eos> And if you don't, I'm already dead, so...<eos> Can we page him again, please?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Something came up. Dr. Harris, I was starting to worry you weren't gonna show up.<eos> Ready to do this?
Do you see his desk?<eos> No! 'Cause he doesn't have a desk.<eos> No.<eos> You just gonna stare at me like I'm in a museum?<eos> Well, you are a piece of work.<eos> Um...<eos> Look. Do you want to know what I would do if I were you?<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> - No, I want to know.<eos> No, I don't.
And the fee for being a racist jack-hole.<eos> Oh, God damn it.<eos> What--<eos> That's more like it.<eos> Now we can go to the tanning salon.<eos> ♪ Okay, we're not staying.<eos> - Just be a minute.<eos> - Oh, thank God you're here.<eos> This is Will, Sean's son.<eos> - How you doing, Will?
- You got a car?<eos> - What?<eos> Need a ride to Indiana to deliver a package.<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> Well, maybe you want a taste of Snow White before we drop her off.<eos> Shut that door behind you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Debbie!<eos> How'd you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
We can't. Too much depends on this now.<eos> This has to be done.<eos> You'll be out of the country before morning.<eos> Once we find whatever it is we're looking for, then what?<eos> Depends on what we find.<eos> What if it's something that used to be important back then, but isn't a very big deal now?<eos> You know? Like eyeglasses.<eos> Eyeglasses?<eos> Did you know the first pair of eyeglasses was invented in the 13th century?<eos> - I did not.
When we were both young enough and stupid enough to imagine this country was capable of achieving something resembling social justice.<eos> Why's he dressed like James Bond?<eos> Why are you dressed like James Bond?<eos> Oh, there's a car coming to take us to London. I did tell you.<eos> Judith's...<eos> She's been nominated for the Carnegie Medal for children's fiction.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Him and his little friend better not mess up the house while we're out.<eos> They do know that, don't they?<eos> Course they do.
The twister?<eos> Yes, the twister.<eos> It was destroyed six moons ago by carlos madrigal.<eos> The skull keeper did not escape from hell, He escaped from our prison.<eos> They all did.<eos> They?<eos> How many more are there?<eos> More than we can survive.<eos> Do you see them, master?<eos> I do.
I'll never tell you.<eos> Oh, those damn radar eyes.<eos> Do I save her 'cause I should?<eos> Or cause she's hot?<eos> Mamma.<eos> Alright, you naked assholes, time to pick on someone your own size.<eos> You want some?<eos> You feel that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you?
Can I have it, please?<eos> You took notes on my wife?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Look at this shit.<eos> You got all this...<eos> Veronica's family tree, likes and dislikes?<eos> Oh, you got that wrong.<eos> - Where?<eos> - "Doesn't like beef-drizzled nachos."<eos> Uh...yes, she does!
They're all facing in, not out.<eos> What do you think those seven are looking at?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> There's the<eos> It's done.<eos> Any complications?<eos> No. Send the car.<eos> On its way.<eos> Make sure the driver has my documents.<eos> He does.
- ...and the other half saving the world. How do you cope?<eos> How do YOU cope with a career and a baby?<eos> How do you know I have a baby?<eos> I did my research.<eos> I have a nanny, that's basically your answer.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> He's downstairs right now.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And, yes, I said "he".<eos> - Yes, you did.

Um, really, if you could just look up about now...<eos> Always there, always kind, never lies.<eos> I even lied to him about this dress but I don't think he's ever told a single lie to me, not once, about anything.<eos> - Not once.<eos> - That's very commendable.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Please, take no aggressive action, or your friend's life is over.<eos> Mr Brock?<eos> - What do you want here?<eos> - The same thing you do, Miss Fletcher.
Not such a long shot after all.<eos> All right, gents, change of plans.<eos> Scott, you and I will take out the cult monkeys and surround the redhead.<eos> [Amaru] On your feet.<eos> My Queen... we did not expect you.<eos> Itzpa serves me well.<eos> A true daughter of Xibalba.<eos> She says you have something special for me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course we do.
You believe him?<eos> No. Not for a second.<eos> How long until imaging comes back?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
If an intruder jimmied the window open when they broke in, would they leave that window open or closed behind them?<eos> - That's a rhetorical question...<eos> - I think that they would leave it open.<eos> So then, why is there blood on the inside of this window frame?<eos> Oh, you're asking.<eos> Uh, that would mean that the window was closed during the murder, and opened after.<eos> Which means the break-in could be staged?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you talked to the building manager?<eos> Yes, I did.
- If O'Brien wins the election...<eos> - Okay, let's hear what this is.<eos> ...you've slept with the Secretary of the Treasury. SELINA:<eos> Oh, that's classy.<eos> This is over. Over?<eos> I didn't even know it was a thing.<eos> Absolutely not a thing.<eos> And if it was a thing, it's over.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How we doing?
I'm Dr Young.<eos> I'll need to speak to Ivy alone.<eos> I'll be outside, if you need me.<eos> Don't know what they've told you about me but I'm a clinical psychologist and we're going to spend an hour here now to see if the two of us can work together.<eos> Everything you say is just between us.<eos> I'm someone with no agenda apart from to help you.<eos> Someone you can talk to.<eos> I'm tired of talking.<eos> I'm sure. But it's very important for you to have someone you can feel at ease with.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You're under arrest for murder now.<eos> I need to read you your rights again.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - Anything you...<eos> - I know all that.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> - I don't need one.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Hey, it's the good doctor!<eos> Ryan!<eos> Are you back?<eos> - Yeah, I am!<eos> - Temporarily?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On..?<eos> - Ah, a lot of things.<eos> - Does Cassie know you're back?<eos> Yeah, she does, actually.
You go first.<eos> My father was here.<eos> That woman went to him and offered a deal.<eos> Let me guess... they want me to turn on Harvey.<eos> They'll drop all the charges, and you won't have to spend a minute in prison.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> I told him that I would give you the message.<eos> That you'd give me the message?<eos> Rachel, you know there's no way in hell I am ever gonna turn on them, right? - You know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Wouldn't shake my hand.<eos> It's nothing personal.<eos> He's just not fond of any form of touching.<eos> - Kind of a quirk, you might say.<eos> - Like wearing make-up?<eos> - Up close, I could tell.<eos> - Yeah, I got that too.<eos> As if it were any of your business.<eos> - So you believe his story?<eos> - Of course I do.
Some of us went peacefully.<eos> Relocated here to their abandoned cabins.<eos> Most were killed.<eos> Now we call this valley "MikoEw,"<eos> "stained with blood".<eos> We have waited a long time for our day of reckoning.<eos> Children died in LaPier.<eos> Call that justice?<eos> Our children died too.<eos> As Galen LaPier did yesterday.
And all witness tampering would do is hurt my own case, so why on God's green earth would I do that?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> I said you're insane if you think that...<eos> No, you said, "on God's green earth," which is exactly what that editorial said.<eos> I remember because I thought, what person under 80 uses that phrase?<eos> Well, looks like I found her.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You sure as hell do. Because you planted that goddamn thing.<eos> You have any proof?<eos> No, you don't.
And Harvey wasn't gonna tell me because he's playing dirty.<eos> He's not your enemy, Mike.<eos> He's just doing what he thinks is best.<eos> Then I'm gonna do what I think is best.<eos> And what exactly is that?<eos> Look, Donna, he may not be my enemy and you may not be my enemy. But as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson.<eos> I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.
When we first started, you begged me to help you save your career.<eos> No, no, no, no, Mike.<eos> This is not the same thing.<eos> I could have gotten you disbarred.<eos> It could've gotten me sent me to jail and you know it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> All right?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Mike, you are asking me to perjure myself and I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Defense would like to call Jimmy Kirkwood to the stand.<eos> GIBBS:<eos> Objection. His name was not on the witness list.<eos> HARVEY: Rebuttal witness.<eos> She just said we can't produce someone who places Mike at Harvard and I say we can.<eos> Your Honor...<eos> Mr. Specter is within his rights.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood can take the stand.<eos> How did you know he'd testify?<eos> I didn't until just now.
He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules, but we know he does because, ladies and gentleman of the jury,<eos> Mike Ross... Is a fraud.<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike. She was good, Harvey.<eos> - Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
So you want to turn yourself in because some cheater called you a bully?<eos> No, Donna, I want to turn myself in because he was right. I'm not unbeatable.<eos> No, Harvey, I think he made you feel guilty, and now you're not seeing clearly.<eos> Donna...<eos> Harvey, if it were anybody other than Mike on trial and you saw his closing, do you think that the jury would convict him?<eos> I don't know, Donna, but I can't afford to be wrong about this.<eos> Then let me as you a question:<eos> Why aren't you talking to Dr. Agard about this?<eos> - How do you know about her?<eos> - Because I do.
What you're proposing requires trust.<eos> We have none.<eos> None of my clients do, which is why you, like all my clients, must swear to uphold and enforce not only this merger, but all mergers brokered with my assistance.<eos> Here is my client list.<eos> They are powerful and well-armed.<eos> Should either of you betray the other, they will destroy your families.<eos> You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.

But you are also half-human. Aren't you?<eos> - I am, admiral.<eos> - Mister Spock...<eos> As a student, you were accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.<eos> - A tremendous honor.<eos> - Affirmative.<eos> Yet you turned down admission.<eos> Did your "human emotions" play a role in that decision?<eos> No sir.<eos> They did not.
We acknowledge and respect your culture's beliefs.<eos> - But I must tell you...<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> I'm well aware that my people's prejudices are hopelessly outdated by modern standards.<eos> I appreciate that you recognize that, sir.<eos> A large faction on Tellar Prime argues against our government's stance on this matter.<eos> And I, for one, am part of that faction.<eos> I believe one of your greatest human writers once said...<eos> "A lady's 'verily' is as potent as a lord's."<eos> That he did, sir.
Was it about the baby?<eos> The first time was to see if I still lived here, and...<eos> A few days later, she called to say she was in town.<eos> She met with you?<eos> Look, I get that this must be weird, hearing from me after all these years.<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm not gonna pretend it isn't.<eos> You been to see your mama?<eos> I-I hear she's got financial troubles. No.<eos> No, you, remember what that was like.<eos> I do.
You know, if there's a donor who's got money, she's right there.<eos> She can't even cry in public.<eos> Eric... my player...<eos> He never touched that kid.<eos> He never forced himself on him, and then that kid comes back and kills Wes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Leslie should've settled this thing a long time ago.<eos> There are a lot of us who think there need to be changes.<eos> But the school board is split on Leslie, and she's got a lot of donors who like her.<eos> A lot of people don't.
I'm taking it for my own.<eos> - For stealing the gun? - Yeah.<eos> For shooting the boy?<eos> Responsibility and guilt are closely linked here.<eos> Do you feel guilty about this incident?<eos> What I feel...<eos> Do you feel guilty about anything else?<eos> You know how, um... my mom gave me up once?<eos> I know why she did, but I, um, never really got it.<eos> Now I do.
- Oh, no, no, darlin'.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> - Oh, yes, I am.<eos> No, don't. You are a beautiful woman.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, you're... Hey, you're both beautiful women.<eos> For your ages, you're both beautiful women.<eos> And, you know, if I get snippy with you sometimes, it's just because I don't think you like me. - Oh.<eos> - Oh, no, I don't.
Will the salvage yard be able to verify that?<eos> No. No, I hit traffic on my way up.<eos> By the time I got there, they were closed, and I had to turn around empty-handed.<eos> Thought Ellen would be pissed, but if you're asking me for an alibi, you must really have no idea who did this.<eos> We were wondering how you felt about the pregnancy.<eos> The what?<eos> Your wife was almost two months pregnant, Mr. Jacobs, despite her tubal ligation.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
I had a vasectomy 20 years ago.<eos> Megan...<eos> Ellen, she had her tubes tied.<eos> Then last month, she told me what had happened. She was... pregnant.<eos> She was gonna... she was gonna keep it.<eos> So you killed her?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I miss something?<eos> You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.
That's necessary?<eos> The deceased officer had four different social security numbers attributed to his name...<eos> We have no idea who this guy really was.<eos> What a nightmare, huh?<eos> For you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm gonna step out for a bit.<eos> Mr. Caputo, did you hear about last night?<eos> The white girl is all kind of messed up and Crazy is even crazier!<eos> - I did.
It's about winning, about providing society with superior things, and about proving that you have taste, and good values and you work hard.<eos> And what a wonderful relief, every so often, to know who the enemy is.<eos> Because in the garden, the enemy is everything.<eos> The aphids, the weather, time.<eos> And so you pour yourself into it, care so much, and see up close so much birth, and growth, and beauty, and danger, and triumph.<eos> And then everything dies anyway, right?"<eos> "But you just keep doing it."<eos> Washington showed me this when I started the garden.<eos> She thought I'd like it.<eos> I do.
Jefferson... were you there, in the cafeteria?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Was there an altercation?<eos> Did Washington provoke him in some way?<eos> What are you asking me?<eos> If she deserved to die?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> There were conflicting reports with some key witnesses claiming she had a weapon.<eos> Man, like hell she did!
What are you doing?<eos> Calling Social Services.<eos> He was 8 or 9.<eos> He ran off one day and disappeared.<eos> There's no report on him.<eos> I didn't want to lose my license.<eos> Even if I had reported it, it wouldn't have mattered.<eos> There's very little follow-up in the system.<eos> You know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What?<eos> Where's the shotgun?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is it, Jane?<eos> Why do you need it?<eos> You know why.<eos> You promised.<eos> You did this to him, not me.<eos> He has a family.<eos> So do you.
Cameron: When I was 10 years old, I had heart surgery.<eos> Kirsten: My father stitching me into my mother killed her.<eos> Cameron?<eos> I see Barbiero.<eos> He's on a call with a woman.<eos> You're using me to send a message to the girl?<eos> Kirsten: He was told things that I was meant to hear and then he was killed.<eos> Black Sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.
No, Cameron! No!<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> (sobs) Please!<eos> Cameron!<eos> No.<eos> Cameron?<eos> Cameron?<eos> Please... tell me you got the license plate number.<eos> No, I didn't.
It's not a what. It's a who.<eos> What the hell is this place?<eos> I was hoping one of you could tell me.<eos> - That's... - Ed Clark.<eos> Turner's had him here right under our noses since his murder.<eos> Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
The tears fell down down down his cheekbones<eos> Got soup?<eos> Like raindrops to the ground<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Hey.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah, I just had after-school stuff<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Joy.<eos> He doesn't do stuff.
- Or I played at it and she was my accomplice.<eos> After 15 years of marriage jealousy was the reliable stimulant.<eos> Let's be honest.<eos> When your spouse gets jealous, it's flattering.<eos> The blood stirs, the heart pounds.<eos> We'd quarrel and we'd have sex.<eos> Or as Diana would say provocatively we'd fuck.<eos> - And it works.<eos> - The guy you were coming onto all afternoon.<eos> - Until it doesn't.
- Yeah.<eos> You have a--you have a little cut there, over your eye.<eos> - Oh, it's nothing.<eos> I should go.<eos> - So how about I come back later?<eos> - Let her in.<eos> - Actually, why not just come in now?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Whoa. Hey!<eos> - Hey, how you doing?
Richard told me he fired him.<eos> They've got Luca tied upstairs.<eos> - What the hell's taking Roxie so long? [phone chimes]<eos> Who's that?<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> Go downstairs and find that safe.<eos> - You got a text about some rapist.<eos> - I really need to answer that.<eos> Please.<eos> You just did.
And it all went to hell.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> - Your dad, too?<eos> - He was the smartest, funniest man I knew.<eos> And then I found out he was embezzling from his clients to pay off gambling debts.<eos> I didn't know if I'd ever forgive him.<eos> - But you did.<eos> - It took time.<eos> A lot.<eos> - But I did.
It wasn't her.<eos> Ela was very forthright about the details of her trip to Saint Lucia.<eos> She was only there for one day and then a nightmare trip home.<eos> Flight delays, lost luggage...<eos> - Karma's a bitch.<eos> - We need to take another run at Jon.<eos> I already interviewed him.<eos> Twice.<eos> Most likely pitching softballs.<eos> The hell I did!
!<eos> - I would definitely get my hands on that tape if I were you.<eos> - You don't think I can win. - (gasps) Dean!<eos> Seriously?<eos> You'd rather have Claire run this than me.<eos> Uh... maybe, yeah.<eos> You know, she's a-an actual lawyer or whatever.<eos> You know, you do that a lot.<eos> You sort of trail off with a little insult under your breath, and you think that I don't hear it.<eos> Well, I do.
- So I'm told.<eos> - I can't release this to anyone under 18.<eos> But my name is listed for pickup.<eos> Still, I can't release this to a minor.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> Fine.<eos> What aisle is the Drano?<eos> Do you remember when we met?<eos> Yep.<eos> I do.
And you are?<eos> Cecilia. From PostMates!<eos> ID?<eos> I'm fucked up.<eos> And not, like garden-variety teenage girl fucked up.<eos> I mean actually fucked up.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> 'Cause I wanted him to die.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, I did.
I should have come sooner.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I went to his grave and I asked him what he wanted me to do.<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's dead.<eos> It's up to me now.<eos> My husband is gone.<eos> The Caliphate that killed him thinks that all the things he stood for are gone, too.<eos> But they don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> Only we do.
No, it's a rat.<eos> A mouse, a rat.<eos> What is the difference?<eos> They're Chinese Zodiac signs.<eos> Oh, you're totally right!<eos> Weller's the snake, I'm the dog, Reade's the rat.<eos> And Zapata, you're the pig.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - I didn't say it.<eos> The Zodiac did.
That would mean that we shouldn't be looking for an escape method at all. We should be looking for a hiding place.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, does Invidia have any gates in the radius?<eos> Ah, okay. No current properties. But there was an old gated community that was purchased by developers in 2008 that employed them.<eos> Looks like the project's been in limbo since the economy crashed, but all the houses are still there unoccupied.<eos> All right, give us the address.<eos> No one likes a tattletale.<eos> I didn't tell Camila, I swear.<eos> - This time, I won't leave a mark. - I swear!<eos> Please don't!
Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I lost you once before. I spent most of today thinking I lost you again.<eos> What would you have done... if you were me?<eos> Exactly the same thing.<eos> Coast Guard didn't find a body.<eos> Said the current must have taken him.<eos> Her story feels off. You still don't think she's connected to Carter's disappearance?<eos> No, I don't.
I thought, "Here... Here is my family.<eos> Here is who I was meant to know."<eos> I let you in on my life.<eos> I trusted you with everything.<eos> You want to talk about a mistake I will spend the rest of my life regretting?<eos> How about meeting you?<eos> Clear the area!<eos> Come on, let's move out!<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I didn't...
Well, almost.<eos> Aside from the superficial scarring and the lifelong elevated risk of rare mutation-based cancers,<eos> I'm surprisingly healthy.<eos> And what about your previous situation?<eos> Oh, "The Company" has not come knocking.<eos> Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?
It was her husband, Lloyd Beakman.<eos> How dare you.<eos> Wait, you and mom disappeared from the party at the same time.<eos> No, I-I remember because I was trying to find you guys.<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> I want order.<eos> Apologies to the court, Your Honor.<eos> Joanna Masters thought that Sadie was having an affair with her husband, Roger, but she was wrong, and so were you.<eos> I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you do.
You'll see.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Honey, it's perfect.<eos> I'll never miss another visit, I promise.<eos> It's ok, honey.<eos> Even when you make mistakes, I am always going to love you.<eos> All the hard work you did.<eos> And it is even better than I could have imagined.<eos> You really like it?<eos> Ohh, of course I do.
This is Willa's room.<eos> I mean,<eos> - was, was Willa's room.<eos> - I'm so sorry, Waves.<eos> Did you call my dad? Did you call the police?<eos> Wynonna's on her way.<eos> She's the best chance we got.<eos> OK, just please, please just trust me, Chrissy.<eos> Geez.<eos> OK, I do.
Good day, sir.<eos> Carter.<eos> Mace says that moisture may be damaging items in the burial chamber.<eos> Well, I haven't been back to the tomb, but yes, I should think.<eos> What can be done about it?<eos> Well, the first thing would be to get them clear of the confined space.<eos> Out into the dry air.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes, I do.
I love this city.<eos> It's adorable.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Kira.<eos> Hello.<eos> Felix's real sister.<eos> Real sister, how?<eos> We have the same father.<eos> I thought you didn't have a father.<eos> Well, I didn't, but now I do.
Holy shit.<eos> Sarah, talk some sense into her, please.<eos> What are you doing, Mika?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> - There's a bomb under my chair.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I need him. He needs to pay for what he did to Niki.<eos> I know, alright?<eos> I know about Helsinki.<eos> Did Beth?
You raised a CASTOR clone instead.<eos> Please be kind to Ira.<eos> CASTOR was never completely under my control, to be raised homogeneously like that.<eos> I wanted him to be different.<eos> And me?<eos> Raised by Aldous Leekie. Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside...<eos> Helsinki?<eos> You weren't supposed to know about Helsinki.<eos> Well, I do.
It was a vision of a swan.<eos> You fell down the stairs and bumped your head.<eos> Yes, but the swan was in my eye, like a glitch.<eos> Well, everything appears to be normal.<eos> Anyway, we're on our own, Rachel.<eos> Susan's given up on LEDA.<eos> But age has dulled her ambition.<eos> You and I are still young.<eos> Don't you want to live?<eos> I do now, yes.
And I'm gonna get back in touch with you real soon.<eos> Son of a biscuit!<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Alison?<eos> Are you, uh...<eos> You all right?<eos> - Let me...<eos> Let me help you with this. - I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what came over me.<eos> Oh, well, I do.
We were trying to get away from them, and I got knocked off a bridge.<eos> I fought the current, wound up in the inlet.<eos> The estuary?<eos> The bay?<eos> Look, I'm not good with geography.<eos> I just thought I was dead out there.<eos> And I got to the shore, and I just passed out.<eos> It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.
Do your thing.<eos> Well, the pussy passed out.<eos> But it's settled... we're square. Everything is cool.<eos> Let Mark's face be a daily reminder to him and to everyone else that the rules matter.<eos> I hope that we all learned something today, because I don't ever... want to have to do that again.<eos> Some crazy shit, huh?<eos> You probably think I'm a lunatic.<eos> Come on. Let's go figure out what to do with you.<eos> I didn't want to come back here.<eos> I don't...
Nope.<eos> I accidentally went in a store that looked like it sold ice cream and got us our first family Internet computer!<eos> Is it better than my brother-in-law's?<eos> It is better than your brother-in-law's.<eos> Do a search for biggie lyrics.<eos> No, look up where rainbows end.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Before we touch the computer, we need to take this course first.<eos> It's called "Mavis Beacon's introduction..."<eos> I just did a search for Cattleman's Ranch.
I'm asking you for the last time.<eos> What does that girl mean to you?<eos> I told you already.<eos> So, you're not gonna tell me what this is about?<eos> I'm just supposed to keep looking for this girl that means nothing to you, whom you need alive, preferably, and who needs to be made an example of?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew you'd see it my way.<eos> Enough about this.<eos> Did Batman show you my proposal for the new delivery terms?<eos> Oh, yes, he did.
It really is no big deal.<eos> She's right.<eos> Sexuality is very fluid now.<eos> People don't adhere to specific traditional labels.<eos> What's wrong with labels?<eos> That's how you know what stuff is.<eos> See?<eos> This is water.<eos> I fill it before I go out.<eos> I don't do bar prices.
Right.<eos> You've always been good in a crisis, Shea.<eos> Also, with Mom and Dad gone, we can work on, you know, Operation:<eos> Project.<eos> They're not here.<eos> You can say what Operation:<eos> Project is.<eos> All right, we can work on our...<eos> - Oh, God, did you hear that?<eos> - Of course I did.
Okay.<eos> I will keep it a secret that my father loves me.<eos> Well... you got something to say back?<eos> Mm. I love you too, Dad.<eos> We don't have to hug now, do we?<eos> Well, if we didn't do it when the Seahawks won the Super Bowl, why would we do it now?<eos> Good point.<eos> You know, I see you telling your daughters you love them just about every day.<eos> I do it as much as I can.<eos> - Maybe I do it too much.
Look, it's pretty simple, ok?<eos> If we make it to the base and it's still up and running I might not make it out alive.<eos> Who knows what they wanted me for before you got stuck with me?<eos> Hell if I know.<eos> It's gotta be a cure though, right?<eos> I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive.<eos> And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth.<eos> Axel.<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm just saying maybe that's not what everybody wants right now.<eos> Maybe some of us have other ideas as to what we wanna do with our lives right now.<eos> - Such as? - I don't...<eos> I'm just saying!<eos> Look, I'm just trying to keep you people safe, and that includes you, Doc.<eos> So, until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah?<eos> Then what do you suggest?<eos> You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I do.
He said you would do that.<eos> Do what?<eos> Ask questions and lie.<eos> Especially about him.<eos> We know what he did to you, Violet.<eos> Gina told us everything.<eos> You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila. Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
Hey, Abby. You busy?<eos> At 2:00 in the morning?<eos> No, sir. I'm free.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm gonna need my schedule cleared for the next three days so I can prepare for the east Asia summit.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have it?<eos> Do I have... ?<eos> My schedule.<eos> Oh, sir, I-I do, but, uh...
You have a whistle-blower at the NSA.<eos> Which is why I need you to handle this.<eos> Keep it off the agency's radar.<eos> Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
- It was you or my husband.<eos> You selfish...<eos> You need to forgive me before it's too late.<eos> Yeah? I don't know that I can.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Forgiven? Or not?<eos> Yeah, I forgive her! OK?<eos> I forgive her!<eos> No, you don't.
- Well, in a town with no church, you needed one.<eos> But Wyatt found out about a cattle rustler who confessed his crimes to ole Father Auggie.<eos> So Wyatt aimed to put Auggie on the witness stand.<eos> Let me take a wild guess.<eos> - Auggie never made it to court?<eos> Disappeared the night before the trial.<eos> People say foul play was involved. Wait.<eos> How can August be a revenant,<eos> I mean, if Wyatt didn't kill him?<eos> Oh, but he did. Most definitely.
Yeah, but it's like you think that nothing can touch you. Like nothing bad can get in your way.<eos> That's not true for any of us.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Look, I know that you had an experience in the Speed Force.<eos> And I'm happy that you think we're gonna win the day. But I think a little fear can be a healthy thing.<eos> It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.<eos> I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.<eos> I met your little red friend tonight.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?<eos> You didn't.
And I love sitting here on this couch with you.<eos> Perfect.<eos> But I'm just not sure that they can or should coexist.<eos> Rosie, we are both intelligent adults.<eos> I can handle both sides of my brain, and I know you can, too.<eos> (knock on door) Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, Rosie, I... - Hey.<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know I was interrupting.<eos> No, no, you didn't. No, no, no.
I'm working a case.<eos> You're working here?<eos> We have a suspect, but Rosie doesn't believe she's our killer.<eos> He says a bruise on the back of her head confirms her story, and it's my job to figure out our next move.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mira.<eos> Look at this place, huh?<eos> Same bar, same lights.<eos> Hasn't changed much since your father was running games up in back at those tables, huh?<eos> Some things never do.
So, uh, why am I still cuffed?<eos> To keep us safe.<eos> I mean, otherwise, you can attack us, which, I mean, if you did, I'd be fine, but...<eos> Speaking of safety, did you...<eos> Oh, you mean the raid swag.<eos> Um, well, that's the stuff that you get to take home once the raid is done, right?<eos> We take home criminals. That's our raid swag.<eos> You better give us back that vest.<eos> Oh, come on, Villa. Now, did I ask you to return the autopsy swag?<eos> No. Did I?
How much exactly did he withdraw?<eos> Villa?<eos> You are not gonna believe this, but Calvin Spitz was in the bank this morning, withdrawing $2 million in cash.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> The body that's on my table has been dead for three days.<eos> See the break at the scaphoid bone?<eos> It's not a cut made by the sharp teeth of an adult pig, but by the surgical saw of a human.<eos> That hand was cut off by the killer.<eos> Why would the killer need the hand?<eos> He didn't.
Don't run, you idiots.<eos> He's going to save us, don't run.<eos> Stop, you damn morons!<eos> - He's coming!<eos> - My son is a hero!<eos> You hear me?<eos> He's a hero!<eos> You really mean that, Dad?<eos> You think I'm a hero?<eos> Of course I do.
Hey, that guy you shot, genius, was the one with the key.<eos> You shot our captain.<eos> That true?<eos> - Hey, keep your goddamn hands...<eos> - Get back.<eos> Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is.<eos> - One.<eos> - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
Sorry.<eos> - This is "more serious." - Mm.<eos> So, should I be happy for you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... This certainly wasn't part of the plan.<eos> - I mean, not at this point of my life.<eos> Well, yay!<eos> Your body's working.<eos> I do know one thing, though.<eos> That... ginger tablets don't do anything for nausea.
- Her people say she wants the mug.<eos> Would you like to keep the mugs for your... minivan?<eos> How did you know I have a minivan?<eos> - Just a good guess.<eos> Before I ran for Congress, I was a stay-at-home mother of six.<eos> Ugh, yeah.<eos> I tell you, if I could not get there in a minivan, then I wasn't going.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You know the drill.<eos> Indeed I do, yeah.
I really tried to become a better person.<eos> To show that I was trying to listen.<eos> So, when you held the assembly that women were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?<eos> Women are funny, Heidi.<eos> Get over it.<eos> Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fucking mind.<eos> Do you miss your friends?<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> I don't know if I ever did.<eos> You do now.
Let me tell you a story.<eos> In 1999,<eos> Google was a little startup, just like we are.<eos> And when they started bringing in chefs and masseuses, we thought, "They're nuts!"<eos> But they were attracting the best possible people, and they were able to create the best product, and now they're worth over $400 billion.<eos> And do you know the name of that company?<eos> Google, right?<eos> You said it at the beginning of the story.<eos> You're right.<eos> I did that wrong.
Are you sure?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, the occupant of a residence in California has almost unlimited rights.<eos> I have to get his permission to enter my property. I can't turn off the power or the gas, and I have to hire a lawyer to start a legal eviction.<eos> That won't be cheap. Jeez, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That sucks.<eos> So, where did you sleep last night?<eos> I did not.
Actually, no.<eos> No, sorry, Jan the Man.<eos> By "people," I do mean "people."<eos> Humans.<eos> Consumers.<eos> Uh, Keith, Northeast Regional, again.<eos> Jack told us we would be selling directly to businesses.<eos> - He did? - Doug.<eos> I'm shadowing Keith.<eos> - Yes, he did.
The changed ones are our responsibility.<eos> He's my responsibility.<eos> If you remain here, you will have to accept them as Nicholas does.<eos> As we accept them.<eos> It is a new world.<eos> I hope you can see it with new eyes.<eos> What if I can't do that?<eos> Then your son will choose between his family and the truth that they don't want to understand.<eos> I want to understand.<eos> I do.
I trust the American people to make the right decision.<eos> What if you think they're gonna make a certain decision and they make a different decision and then it completely derails what you thought was gonna happen?<eos> - And then your plans are different.<eos> - Oh, honey, don't cry.<eos> Mommy's gonna get elected, honey.<eos> Marjorie and I broke up.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> - Do you need a tissue?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, no, you do.
Get off of that computer right now!<eos> Uh, everyone, please, listen.<eos> We don't have any rockets going to Mars.<eos> Now, you're not listening.<eos> We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet.<eos> We're working as hard as we can.<eos> There's a little girl working on the problem right now, and apparently, she's incredibly smart and funny.<eos> You got it figured out, babe?<eos> Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.<eos> Heidi, yes, you do.
I'd be happy to help, but there would be some small processing fees.<eos> How about this...<eos> You give us a list, or you go to jail.<eos> You'll like it. It's free.<eos> Socialist.<eos> You look a bit tired.<eos> I haven't been sleeping much.<eos> Angie Tribeca?<eos> Nurse Lowboobs.<eos> How you doing since the coma, baby?
You can live in my carcass.<eos> There's room in my legs for the boys.<eos> Maybe we could just store old clothes in you.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> And you know what, Flanders?<eos> I think we owe you guys a trip.<eos> Always wanted to visit the postcard museum. Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> I wonder if they sell postcards in the gift shop.<eos> We don't.
I thought you'd be back in Mystic Falls by now.<eos> I just, uh... wanted to say thank you.<eos> For today.<eos> We still make a good team, don't you think?<eos> Well, Rayna's dead.<eos> Julian's safe.<eos> You'll surely sleep easy tonight.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> And what if I did?
Bill.<eos> Set to be a good one.<eos> Aye.<eos> Well, they often start out that way, pal.<eos> True, that's true.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Aye.<eos> What are you doing here, Alastair?<eos> Sal not give you my message?<eos> She did, aye.
It killed him.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Remember what I said about seeing is believing?<eos> But what if believing what you see means doubting every concept, every principle your life is based on?<eos> And once you let doubt like that in, what unknown hell will it lead you to?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Is he with you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Have you tried calling him?<eos> Obviously I did.
Monsieur Duval?<eos> Please come with me.<eos> Hello.<eos> Their latest employment was with Verdon-Pernot.<eos> Is it correct?<eos> And.<eos> What they thought about Monsieur Duval?<eos> Did you have a good reputation?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -What did your colleagues about you?
Maybe because you're like a big kid yourself.<eos> That's why you're so good at talking to them.<eos> And one day, when we have kids and they say, "why don't we have shoes?"<eos> You can say, "so that other kids can have candy."<eos> Um, V, sometimes it's like...<eos> Like you don't understand me or...<eos> Even believe in me.<eos> It sucks.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I do.
Guys!<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> Time to go. Come on.<eos> Go where?<eos> We...<eos> You just killed her.<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> - I left my car keys inside.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, you did.
Jesus.<eos> Where is god?<eos> I am the resurrection!<eos> I am the way and the truth!<eos> Where is god?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know!<eos> None of us do.
Huh? I just got a text from the dishwasher. [Cellphone chimes]<eos> Me too.<eos> There's some kind of error.<eos> Well, you know what they say about European appliances.<eos> That they're the best in the world?<eos> They raise the value of your home?<eos> They combine elegance and efficiency?<eos> Hmm. Makes no sense.<eos> Should work.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
Hi.<eos> I just wanted to say thanks for the practical joke yesterday.<eos> I really value our friendship.<eos> Clarky Clark!<eos> I'm so glad you liked it. You know, for a minute there,<eos> I thought you were upset, but then I was like,<eos> "if he's upset, then why is he getting me all these pizzas?"<eos> It was a prank.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Nobody did.
I really need to rethink this necklace.<eos> Winn?<eos> Winn!<eos> Winn, are you in...<eos> No!<eos> No! No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Guess that's my exit.<eos> You didn't just now use the...<eos> Oh, God you did.<eos> You did.
Tried to.<eos> I just didn't get it right.<eos> The satellite on that rooftop was yours.<eos> You set a trap for Non.<eos> The fire, that was an accident.<eos> I never meant to endanger any firefighters, any civilians.<eos> Not even Supergirl.<eos> So, you figured if you booby-trapped a satellite, then your Kryptonite would kill Non just in case you went to go check on it?<eos> It didn't work exactly as planned.<eos> It never does with you!
"We've just had the most incredible experience.<eos> I burned my hands." You shouted, "Felicia just burned her hands!<eos> Get on the other line!"<eos> Yeah, and you picked up the phone, and you said...<eos> Toothpaste works for a burn."<eos> You guys were high.<eos> I said, "Oh, no." I said, "No.<eos> "We found it.<eos> "Get on a plane and get down here. We found The Light."<eos> And we did.
Okay, so if, if the DEO is a prison, then Cadmus is a dissection lab.<eos> It's genetic engineering facility that treats aliens like lab rats.<eos> Amputated.<eos> Skinned.<eos> Drained. Injected with experimental drugs.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No. No one does.
Everything I have feared has come to pass.<eos> I couldn't be more serious.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> They're using your satellites.<eos> Can't you reprogram them and destroy Myriad from the inside?<eos> I tried.<eos> There's some pretty epic force fields around those satellites at the moment.<eos> You're always 10 steps ahead, Max.<eos> I know you have a plan.<eos> Of course I do.
I don't want to fight you, child. Afraid I'll win?<eos> You've already lost.<eos> Accept it and the glorious fulfillment of Astra's vision.<eos> In the end, she defeated you.<eos> This doesn't look like victory to me.<eos> And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
We're lucky. This TV station is old.<eos> Not that old.<eos> Not old-old. But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.<eos> We can transmit a signal by calibrating it to Myriad's frequency, without leaving any online fingerprints.<eos> Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
Brandon while I was at GU.<eos> Wait, after the restraining order?<eos> So when I thought that<eos> Rita was going to lose her license and her career and everything,<eos> I sent her the recording of what Carmen had said, and I figured that that meant<eos> Carmen was going to blow up my adoption by telling my social workers everything Brandon and I had done, and I figured if for whatever reason she didn't, - that for sure...<eos> - Rita would.<eos> Wait a minute, Rita knew?<eos> Don't get mad at Rita. She thought everything was over.<eos> Yeah, like we did.
But he died from asphyxiation.<eos> They found neurotoxic venom in his system, which caused paralysis, inhibiting his diaphragm from contracting.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> M.E. has no clue.<eos> But the report suggests the skin of the victim's face was removed while he was still alive.<eos> You remember the case we handled with the alien sightings?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The missing cow ovary mystery.<eos> Never figured that one out.<eos> Well, actually, we did.
He's not supposed to. But tonight, he lost. In a pretty spectacular way.<eos> So, yeah, Mayordomo's pretty upset with Goyo.<eos> Goyo, he was struttin' around real good in that new mask tonight.<eos> New mask?<eos> What kind of mask?<eos> Oh, it was beautiful.<eos> Called himself El Tigre Feroz. Kind of a black tiger.<eos> You know who made the mask?<eos> Well, uh... Yeah, I think he goes to Benito.<eos> Most of the guys do.
You know, we could never serve this where I work. It's over roasted and totally acidic.<eos> Jodi, it's an AA meeting.<eos> The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.
The other day, I found one in the refrigerator.<eos> Yeah, you got to go easy on him with that.<eos> When he cleans his ears, it's like he goes into a trance state. He doesn't even know he's doing it.<eos> Remember when we took him to the emergency room to get one out?<eos> Oh, God. A Q-tip got stuck in his ear?<eos> You know what, we're having lunch.<eos> Yeah, let's say ear.<eos> Oh, well, you got to love him.<eos> Oh, no, you got to love him.<eos> I did my time.
Queso.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> I'm sorry the rocket exploded on re-entry.<eos> Yeah, so, I think we're done with the Apollo 13 references.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just want to spend time with him.<eos> I want so badly to go back to the way things were.<eos> ♪ Romantic moments you had ♪<eos> ♪ That he didn't know were romantic ♪<eos> ♪ Or maybe he did a little ♪
Rebecca.<eos> You're not... perfect.<eos> No one is.<eos> You tried really hard today.<eos> I just wanted to make everyone happy.<eos> And, I don't know,<eos> I wanted you to be proud of me.<eos> You wanted me to be... proud of you?<eos> I didn't know you thought about me that much.<eos> Of course I do.
- What?<eos> No. Okay, Rebecca, let me explain something to you.<eos> You have a window, and that window is Hawaii!<eos> I can't afford to go to Hawaii right now.<eos> I can't even afford to buy a pack of Skittles!<eos> Okay, look, I would give you the money, but I don't have any money.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> The mayor doesn't have all day.<eos> Or maybe he does.<eos> Yeah, he probably does.
Already sealed.<eos> You ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was just thinking it's been two days with no one trying to kill us.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I know.<eos> But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
All right, so, ah, I was thinking martinis.<eos> Uh, I also have some tequila.<eos> What do you think?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I know you likey.<eos> I know all your fantasies, Joshua.<eos> And I'm gonna make them come true!<eos> Ow, God.<eos> Why do you like this?<eos> I don't!
Love comes in many forms.<eos> But the kind of love a child needs is the kind they can count on.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Wake up, sleepyhead!<eos> I made pancakes.<eos> Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You know,<eos> I really do love you, Becca.<eos> Of course you do.
No, not fish, silly!<eos> - Want me to tell you?<eos> - Uhh, yes, please.<eos> OK.<eos> Cheddar cheese and Brussels sprouts.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, baked into a pie.<eos> Doesn't it sound delicious?<eos> You love Brussels sprouts and you love Cheddar cheese.<eos> I do, yeah.
Almost like one of yours.<eos> Did she have long hair?<eos> Uh, she did, yeah.<eos> Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?<eos> For my cupcakes, remember?<eos> Saturday is my turn on the baking booth in the farmer's market.<eos> I remembered this morning that, oh, my God, it's the day after tomorrow.<eos> I have so many cupcakes to make.<eos> - You don't like your pie?<eos> - No, I do, yeah!
How far did you get?<eos> - How far did you...<eos> - It's not there!<eos> I used the tracker and the coordinates.<eos> Nothing is there.<eos> I scouted the entire area.<eos> You're wrong, Ramse.<eos> Titan doesn't exist.<eos> Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.<eos> - It does.
I'm afraid that doesn't quite narrow it down.<eos> Her, uh, left wrist.<eos> She cut it.<eos> Lillian.<eos> I've been here 17 years.<eos> She's been here twice as long.<eos> And during that time, she's had exactly one visitor.<eos> You.<eos> - No family?<eos> - She did.
Cassie...<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> This is a lot for you.<eos> - It's too much too soon.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Then what?<eos> You've been walking around in a funk, and the only thing that's new with us is... what's new with us.<eos> I just want you to feel how I feel.<eos> I do.
Flash, I can still hear you trying to find a hiding spot.<eos> Better hurry!<eos> - 99...<eos> 100!<eos> Ready or not, here I come!<eos> And Green Lantern is behind the armchair.<eos> Hey, no fair!<eos> I thought we said that you couldn't use your superpowers.<eos> X-ray vision much?<eos> I didn't.
Both of those patients survived, Leanne.<eos> It's not the point.<eos> I made the wrong call, and it's not the first time.<eos> I made it, too.<eos> But you knew it was wrong.<eos> That's why you came with me, so it would get done faster.<eos> Our job was to prioritize patient need.<eos> I didn't do that because I couldn't extricate myself and my needs from the equation.<eos> Both of those patients could've died.<eos> But they didn't, Leanne.
Quick selfie?<eos> I mean, we have to, right?<eos> On the way back, once we find the dog.<eos> Which we are definitely going to do.<eos> Jennifer Lawrence is calling.<eos> Did you just hang up on J Law?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's against the J Law.<eos> You're out here because you lost Randy's dog, and there's a strange man standing over there, and all you can think about is Jennifer Lawrence.<eos> Did you just say there's a strange man standing over there?<eos> Oh, my God, I did.
I do not do those, either.<eos> So...<eos> Well, this is going to be great.<eos> You said she was going to handle the motions.<eos> Who said that?<eos> You said that?<eos> Dude, I don't do civil cases. I told you that.<eos> I suck in court. Jesus Christ.<eos> Glad I haven't quit my day job.<eos> Okay, what do you do?
Aha! Interesting is good. Girls want magical, not interesting.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Because I want to see him succeed at his new endeavor.<eos> Top of the morning, gang.<eos> Case just came in from NASA.<eos> It's a bit time-sensitive, but it's a lay-up.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Look at those kicks!<eos> Did you not hear the part about time-sensitive?<eos> I did.
- I think you know precisely.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> But I can't just summon the brightest, most formidable men in the country and give them a dressing down, like children.<eos> Why?<eos> You are in the right, they in the wrong.<eos> Yes, but they're far more intelligent than I am.<eos> Any confrontation, they'd out-debate me, out-think me and out-maneuver me.<eos> But this isn't about education or intelligence. This is about integrity and principle.<eos> Ma'am, you say you don't have what it takes to do battle with these people.<eos> You do.
I wouldn't worry about a thing.<eos> If you're watching this video, then I am no longer alive.<eos> - How many sides does a pentagon have?<eos> - Five.<eos> - What causes disease?<eos> - Bacteria.<eos> - How many letters are in the alphabet?<eos> - 26.<eos> Who loves you?<eos> You do.
Well, I-I got to get ready to get the bus.<eos> Okay.<eos> See you later.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What does EST say about death?<eos> I don't, um-- I don't know.<eos> Gabriel said that our people were with my mother when she died, that she wanted me to know that she loved me.<eos> Paige knows we love her, right?<eos> Of course she does.
Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.<eos> Esteban is alive and well and a legendary enforcer for a series of authoritarian regimes.<eos> Assuming what you say is true and Esteban is alive, what makes you think he can help locate Keen?<eos> Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.<eos> If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.<eos> We'll never find Esteban in time.<eos> We have no assets in Cuba.<eos> Of course you do, Harold.
Let's you and me get this over with.<eos> Okay, you're really putting on mixed signals here.<eos> Please stop talking. Okay.<eos> Of course you're insecure about your body.<eos> You're a teenager.<eos> It's part of the job description. But if this whole skinny-dipping thing ever even happens, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> -Easy for you to --<eos> -You're still talking.<eos> You have nothing to worry about because nobody's going to be looking at you, because all those other kids are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities.<eos> But i-if they do?
I really don't.<eos> But you... you better think, and you better ask yourself, is this really who you want to be?<eos> Good to see you, Fitz.<eos> Susan.<eos> The President wanted to see me.<eos> Come this way.<eos> Susan.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I caught your interview with Sally.<eos> You did?
Do you think state college should be free to anyone who wants it?<eos> Well, like I said in the interview, no one's against free college.<eos> - The problem is...<eos> - Susan. Do you see any TV cameras in here?<eos> No, sir.<eos> So be honest with me.<eos> You like Governor Vargas' free-education plan, don't you?<eos> That's correct.<eos> And you want to see it implemented around the country?<eos> I really do.
That's what Pilcher says, right?<eos> Dr. Yedlin.<eos> That was, uh, very impressive, what you did in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, segmental recession of saphenous vein interposition graft?<eos> That's right.<eos> I was, uh, just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You... You don't?
I don't know.<eos> It's just... maybe he would have more success without the upset of your visits.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> Yes! Yes, he gets upset, but at his situation here.<eos> He just expresses it to me.<eos> We think it's more than that.<eos> We?<eos> Wait, who's we?<eos> His... his doctors feel this way?<eos> His entire treatment team does.
Your Honor, before we get to standing-- Hi, I'm Patty Solis-Papagian for the plaintiff.<eos> We're awaiting the arrival of lead counsel William McBride. Judge:<eos> And where is Mr. McBride?<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> The traffic was a mess.<eos> I think the President's in town or something.<eos> Miss Senate, Miss Kittridge, and Mr. Letts were all here on time.<eos> The litigant bringing the case can't be bothered.<eos> Well, if protocol seems to count--<eos> - Judge: It does!
Oh, perfect.<eos> - My boot broke.<eos> - Ugh. Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> We'll camp here tonight.<eos> You happy? But tomorrow, we're gonna fix your boot, I'm gonna get you to your kingdom, drop you off, and then I can go and rescue Isabella.<eos> All you care about is saving your precious Isabella.<eos> You don't care about me.<eos> Nobody does.
Are you really not interested in my daughter?<eos> Dad.<eos> Lieutenant Yoon is a beloved colleague.<eos> But... during the seven years that I have known her, I never had any feelings towards her.<eos> That's a pity.<eos> All right.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Why are you out so soon?<eos> I thought you had something serious to talk about.<eos> We did.
So, what, we're screwed?<eos> No.<eos> I talked to his courtroom reporter.<eos> She hears everything.<eos> Darla.<eos> A very nice lady.<eos> She goes to the track every weekend. It turns out<eos> Schakowsky talks really fast, so she started recording him so she could get every word.<eos> And you have the tapes?<eos> I do.
Trade-offs are one thing, but what about the time you had to rush out of Judge Schakowsky's court to cover a probate case of hers?<eos> That was because of you, Bernie. - Because you didn't show up.<eos> - N-N-No, it wasn't my day. - It was your day...<eos> - You had given me...<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Any more questions, Counselor?<eos> Just one more.<eos> Didn't you tell Don Weingarten, another bond attorney, that you feel sorry for anyone who gets Alicia Florrick as an attorney?<eos> I did.
No, because I didn't want to make it seem like it was about us yesterday.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> Well, you should do what's best for you.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes I can't tell what that is.<eos> Well, it usually involves seeing which number is higher.<eos> Yes.<eos> So that didn't end well, did it?<eos> No.<eos> I heard from Lucca, they don't want to settle.<eos> They don't.
Henry...<eos> I wasn't always this girl.<eos> Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror, and I'm like, "that's me?"<eos> Yeah, you said you had to run away from home?<eos> Jody took you in?<eos> You should know... I've done some really bad things.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Hurt people.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- It's a first edition.<eos> - Is it?<eos> You know...<eos> You only live once.<eos> - Will you wrap that up for me? - Of course.<eos> Do you mind me asking how you heard about our shop? Oh, yeah.<eos> My friend, Dave Briggs, told me about you.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - No. No.<eos> No, I don't.
I just want you to tell me what you think, Father.<eos> Do you think he was suicidal?<eos> Do you think Ryan Larson's suicidal?<eos> - That's all...<eos> He was not.<eos> I'm late for a meeting. I got to go.<eos> You don't return calls. That's not like you.<eos> Not having any regrets, are you?<eos> I don't have anything to regret.<eos> No. You don't.
Nice walk, ladies.<eos> Ooh, two miles, 33 minutes.<eos> Let's see if we can get it under 30 on the way home.<eos> I'm pretty sure I will 'cause I'm taking a cab. Oh, come on.<eos> You got to admit, once you start moving, it's kind of fun.<eos> Hey, marching band, at ease.<eos> In a second.<eos> I don't like sitting down until my numbers end in an even number.<eos> And... got it. Oh, wait, no, not got it. And... got it.<eos> No, I don't.
She was about to crash.<eos> We're in a thoracotomy and ex-lap now.<eos> This is insane!<eos> Dr. Leighton? Drop what you're doing and get the hell out of the way now.<eos> Pinkney, suction.<eos> - Yes, sir. - Move. Move, move.<eos> Move, move.<eos> Stop barking!<eos> You don't have the authority to...<eos> The hell I don't. Enough!
- (both laugh) They are perkier than ever and I haven't had any issues, and for the first time in my life, - I can go bra-less, so...<eos> - So can I.<eos> (both laugh) Hey, sometimes you just gotta laugh about it.<eos> Did you, um, I mean, did you...<eos> I mean, were you ever worried about people staring at you?<eos> Well, I was, but, you know, people don't really notice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What'd you, um, what did you do about the... about the... about the nipples?<eos> - I had them tattooed.<eos> - Ah. I didn't do nipples, but...
I'd see her popping Adderall every day before class.<eos> So during finals, I said, "I need to cram."<eos> I offer her a couple of twenties for a couple pills. She says, "Sure."<eos> And that's how Bailey got arrested.<eos> I'm sure Benedetto gave her the same deal.<eos> When I heard she was dead, I told him I wanted out, or I'd go above his head.<eos> He told me, I'd better not talk to anyone, unless I wanted to end up like Bailey.<eos> Thank you, buddy.<eos> Now, um, what informant did you say this was?<eos> - We didn't.
We'll be the first on-demand butler service for pets. Get it? Muttler.<eos> It's called Muttler.<eos> Yeah, no, I get it. It's-it's really clever.<eos> Um, just seems like a pretty narrow market.<eos> 30% of Los Angeles households have pets.<eos> That's, like, a million people. I bet you have a pet.<eos> A dog.<eos> Monty. Does Monty have a butler?<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
Well, that's it.<eos> I guess so.<eos> This is weird.<eos> (chuckles) Yeah.<eos> A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times.<eos> See ya!<eos> Ignore him.<eos> He's just using humor to express how... happy he is.<eos> It's okay. I know he loves me.<eos> Sure he does.
Let's go.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> All Dr. Hong wants to do is talk about my feelings.<eos> - It's so stupid.<eos> - I know, baby. But you only have two more sessions to finish, and you can go back to school.<eos> Don't you want to see your father at Career Day?<eos> No. And you hate him too, so why do you even care?<eos> Riq, come here.<eos> I do not hate your father.<eos> Yes, you do.
He's got till the end of the day, Dad.<eos> I know this means a lot to you, James.<eos> Get the money.<eos> What is this for?<eos> It's for, um...<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> Thank you, T.<eos> Tommy, why'd you do that to Holly?<eos> Ghost told me what happened.<eos> He did?
- Shit.<eos> - No map, evil mercenary assholes everywhere, stuck in a library-- this is not how we decided this would go.<eos> Penny, you know this place.<eos> There must be somebody we can talk to.<eos> Yeah, there might be.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet, you are all late.<eos> Actually, it's Margo. This time.<eos> Look, we need your help, though you probably already knew that.<eos> I did.
Cooperman.<eos> He wants to see you tonight.<eos> He said you'd know where.<eos> Yeah, I know where.<eos> So he couldn't call me himself?<eos> Sends you down here like you're a fucking runner?<eos> Arrogant son of a bitch.<eos> Denise knows about Callie.<eos> What, did you tell her?<eos> Nope. Callie did in a really, really unhealthy way.
And there's the birthday girl.<eos> Cheese.<eos> I'll love this 20 years from now, just seeing what I'm seeing, a close-up of Daisy.<eos> I was about nine at the time.<eos> And we were heading to a wrestling tournament.<eos> Some black ice had frozen over the night before. So, when we drove over it, my dad lost total control of the wheel.<eos> And we ended up upside down in a ravine.<eos> When we got to the hospital, I sat there for probably two, three hours.<eos> I was waiting for one of those Disney movie fantasies to come to life, where he woke up.<eos> But he never did.
What if they don't want to be stopped?<eos> No, that's not an option.<eos> Is that what happened last night?<eos> Luke tried to stop McCullough?<eos> Look, I didn't see what happened.<eos> I only saw what he did to Luke.<eos> What happened to Luke could have been self defense.<eos> We need to talk to Dwight.<eos> Sir. Hey, you came and saw.<eos> We did.
They have a boss.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Meng Zhou.<eos> Came to see you last night, didn't he?<eos> How... how did you know that?<eos> Meng Zhou was in our police station earlier this morning.<eos> He was pretty ticked to find out about the scam his dead buddies had been running at Willowbrook.<eos> Guess they never told him.<eos> No.<eos> They did.
- Good.<eos> I was really lookin' forward to tomorrow.<eos> It's been ages since I've got off properly, you know.<eos> You know me Fev posters, they're just not doin' it for me anymore.<eos> You just need to mix up your technique.<eos> - Eh?<eos> - Well... don't just shove your hand in there, right, you wanna take your time with it. Enjoy your body.<eos> Have you ever done a self-massage?<eos> Do we really have to listen to this?<eos> Yeah, we fuckin' do.
Yes.<eos> As an experienced attorney, you're familiar with something called the advice of counsel defense.<eos> That's a legal doctrine involving... good faith reliance on an attorney's, uh... advice.<eos> Let me pose a hypothetical.<eos> If someone like Borns Tech were to detonate napalm bombs off the coast of Long Beach, which is just a few miles from this courtroom, that defense could come in pretty handy, couldn't it?<eos> I don't agree with your premise.<eos> A clever attorney could invoke that defense to help his client avoid responsibility.<eos> It's a-- it's-- it's-- it's-- it's a legitimate legal defense... honored in courts across the land.<eos> Ever advise Borns Tech about testing cluster bombs in the ocean?<eos> I did not.
And while he may elicit your feelings of compassion... feelings are not facts.<eos> Judge:<eos> Mr. McBride? Rebuttal?<eos> Callie Senate is an excellent attorney.<eos> I've known her a long time.<eos> And she's just doing her job.<eos> And I'm doing mine.<eos> Does she want to win?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do I?
No.<eos> And what can be more evil than that?<eos> Not evil.<eos> Not entire-- tirely.<eos> I know.<eos> It's what makes this so sad.<eos> How could they have deliberated for one day?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Oh, did you call Gina?<eos> - No, Marva did.
Well, you implied it.<eos> Plus, there's so many days of the year.<eos> Let's talk wine charms.<eos> Wait. Can we just go back to the calendar?<eos> Because if I was gonna do that...<eos> We're not married to it.<eos> You don't like it, forget about it, because you're gonna love this.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Uh, I did not say that either.<eos> Mm, actually, you did in that piece about dating apps.
Oh, Jo, no.<eos> No, I don't hate...<eos> I never...<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Have some empathy.<eos> I do.<eos> I do, Jo.<eos> But I'm with Charlene now.<eos> And the lawyers haven't decided who this place belongs to.<eos> Until they do...
We all could.<eos> This round's on me.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I've got it.<eos> A.L.I.E.'s gone.<eos> Yeah. I figured.<eos> Clarke, you're not acting like someone who just saved the world.<eos> Because we didn't... not yet.
We never talk about things, and then I end up getting railroaded into giving up my canoe.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I invited the bishop to bingo bonanza.<eos> I was hoping that he'd see how generous we are and then he'd write a recommendation for Jimmy to go to Notre Dame so he wouldn't end up living with us for the rest of his life because he's a little dumb.<eos> See that?<eos> That's Irish-Catholic jedi mind control.<eos> This is tremendous.<eos> Eileen, I'd like to honor all your hard work by featuring the O'Neals in the church bulletin.<eos> So do you have a recent family photo?<eos> Of course I do.
In just a week, the archbishop will confirm you as an adult member of the church.<eos> My little Catholic girl is becoming a little Catholic woman.<eos> Well, I'm gonna grab a little Catholic apple.<eos> You want to get some coverage of that, too?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Hold it up.<eos> Where's Kenny?<eos> Do you think he changed his mind?<eos> He most certainly did not!
Obviously, there's been a mistake made.<eos> Hey, whoa, wait a minute.<eos> I'm telling you--let go... wait!<eos> Sir.<eos> I threw a punch.<eos> I know, it was stupid.<eos> I just got off a 14 hour flight.<eos> I'm tired, I'm cranky.<eos> You know how I get when I get cranky.<eos> Yeah, I do, yeah, hmm.
Wait here, OK?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> I want this, but it's soiled here.<eos> I'll check the stockroom for another pair.<eos> That pair is fine, but can I get a discount?<eos> So, what did you ask her?<eos> Do you like him?<eos> And she said?<eos> Yes, I do.
I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.<eos> I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other? No.<eos> Never.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What?<eos> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
I simply just want to be down with you and Ghost.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's a nice speech, kid, but we're done talking.<eos> Thank you again for that enlightening presentation on otorhinolaryngology, Dr. Sullivan.<eos> Next we have Raina and Tariq St. Patrick's father,<eos> Mr. James St. Patrick.<eos> Mr. St. Patrick is one of Manhattan's biggest nightclub owners.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Hello, parents and kids.<eos> How you guys doing?
Okay.<eos> I'm trying really hard to be... patiently submissive here, but this steely silence thing is... is... just about to cross the line between self-empowerment and douchebaggery.<eos> I think you might be my penance.<eos> For the evil man-deeds of your past?<eos> You gotta see it through now, right?<eos> Suffer.<eos> I'm all done suffering, Iz.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, you do?<eos> I do.
What?<eos> What do you mean she's not in school?<eos> You got one of those? Oh, yeah.<eos> Right above my tramp stamp.<eos> Is it a tumor?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Regan!<eos> ETU's suddenly a breeding facility.<eos> I didn't see that one coming.<eos> No one did.
Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> Not really.<eos> Is that how you came out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My parents didn't have baby pictures.<eos> I can't believe it came from McCarthy.<eos> He's a fu... monster.<eos> Briggs knows the controls?<eos> No, he doesn't.
They did that to me, too.<eos> You can't trust her.<eos> And whatever they look like on the surface... they're monsters underneath.<eos> You're ruthless.<eos> World domination cometh.<eos> You get the killer instinct from your parents?<eos> My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit. Not about me.<eos> No one does.
You've killed for the ETU.<eos> Jackson told me we had to, to save people.<eos> - That we needed to stop you.<eos> - What did your parents tell you?<eos> Not much.<eos> Are they still alive?<eos> The humans know more than I do.<eos> The ETU has more intel on us than they've shared with you.<eos> They know exactly where your parents are, I don't.<eos> Well, who does, Jackson?
Jules' replacement can scour his financials to find out what he's been hiding.<eos> Stephanie Le Guin, meet Agent Briggs, Agent Carroll.<eos> The muscle.<eos> Oh, Miss Congeniality.<eos> Steph's a cryptographer,<eos> Finnerman brought her in to continue working on decoding the Hunter language.<eos> The Hunters have their eyes on Martinez.<eos> This is coming from Regan.<eos> How do we know it's not compromised?<eos> We don't.
Hunters molt.<eos> They click.<eos> They have shells.<eos> And they have nuclear weapons.<eos> I think that you,<eos> Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?<eos> By turning her against her own kind?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
He's no use to us dead.<eos> How do you like your coffee?<eos> Black.<eos> Any news on the launch location?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Still searching.<eos> Well, that's no good.<eos> Time's running out.<eos> I'm sure Finnerman will have a contingency plan.<eos> She always does.
- Yes. Yes, he will.<eos> Please, Milly, you have to stop this.<eos> It isn't safe.<eos> We can talk about this, sort it out on the ground.<eos> Please!<eos> Milly, this is a really bad idea.<eos> How can you prove that this woman even existed?<eos> Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.<eos> Well, what if they don't?
I'm sorry.<eos> I only wanted to offer my condolences.<eos> We commend our brother to the Lord.<eos> May He embrace him in His peace and bring his body to life again on the last day.<eos> - Amen. - Amen.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Just in the village.<eos> It's quiet out, lots of people have gone to the funeral.<eos> I know.<eos> You didn't?
- Yeah, loves it.<eos> I mean, you must be scared, honestly, being married to her.<eos> 'Cause you don't know. Like, one day, she could really lose it.<eos> - [Jason] Yeah. - And then, what are you gonna do?<eos> And then, you'll just have your baby. You're gonna have to raise him by yourself.<eos> She could move to Morocco.<eos> By the way, I've heard of worse scenarios.<eos> [stammers] Well, Jenny... you wanted to be married though, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Like, you did.
When we go out in public, we have to ask permission to sit.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Do you ever say, "Go down on me right now" to him?<eos> Or like, "Fuck me in the..." Whatever you do, I don't know.<eos> "Fuck me in the ass," or whatever?<eos> I don't know what you're into.<eos> Yeah. Sometimes, yeah.<eos> Do you have to call him "Sir"?<eos> - No. - Wait, during sex?<eos> [Panda] Yeah, I don't...
It's kinda like, you really don't wanna ever say, "slave."<eos> People are really into some weird shit, and I don't want that.<eos> That doesn't... is not palatable to me at all.<eos> I'm disgusted by it.<eos> I don't mean to be, 'cause it's judgmental, but I am.<eos> I mean, I don't want anything bad to happen to them.<eos> Just don't ever wanna see them.<eos> [all laughing] The first time that Kevin ever left me alone in his apartment, I searched the entire place.<eos> - [Jenny] I love you.<eos> - I did.
You are so sweet.<eos> SHE GASPS Tommy...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you're still looking for clues... That means you think the voodoo priest was innocent?<eos> - His name was Emmanuel.<eos> If he broke in last night, then why did he pick the lock today?<eos> Why not come in the same way?<eos> I can't believe I didn't see it before.<eos> - Didn't see what exactly?<eos> - None of us did.
I went outside in the daytime.<eos> Nina's on her way in.<eos> You know, she's the executive who discovered me at that storytelling show.<eos> I'm running behind, so you need to order me lunch.<eos> I want a kale salad with a side of kale and a kale shake, and tomorrow better book me a kale-onic.<eos> Caroline, what are you doing?<eos> You're dressed all wrong.<eos> Yours is a "riches to rags" story, a story we'll never sell if you go in there wearing that.<eos> I have a huge hole near the crotch in my panty hose, if that helps.<eos> It doesn't.
We both have it rough, don't we?<eos> Is that yotsuha?<eos> She's all grown up.<eos> They're both pretty like their mother.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's the oldest sake in the world.<eos> By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.<eos> "Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate sake made that way?<eos> Of course they do.
You gotta talk to us, Corpsman.<eos> Whatever you're involved in, it's not too late.<eos> We can stop it.<eos> We're gonna stay here.<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> The scar is not from Bashir.<eos> I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.<eos> You escaped? Yes.<eos> The night that they thought you died.<eos> I almost did.
And your son.<eos> He came early.<eos> He's healthy and strong.<eos> Like his father.<eos> Here, hold him.<eos> I was right about Nolan.<eos> First time for everything, right?<eos> Ah, I'm glad you were.<eos> I like a storybook ending.<eos> Who doesn't?
Why do I care about meeting some female...<eos> Thank you... old Warren Buffetty kind of hot... Hot.<eos> She's hot.<eos> (Edie jabbers) Hi.<eos> Catherine Sanders. God!<eos> Hit me!<eos> Hit me!<eos> What?<eos> I'm just gonna go get that real fast over here. So, do you have a marker?<eos> Oh, yes, in fact, I do.
Captain, nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're a bit of a legend around these parts.<eos> Recruits have been gunning for your records since I got here five years ago.<eos> So far, no one's gotten close.<eos> Yeah, well, they will.<eos> Every record falls in the end.<eos> Here's Bardot's file.<eos> I've assigned his instructor, Sergeant Ortiz, to be your liaison.<eos> You know Sergeant Ortiz?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why don't we continue this conversation at dinner?<eos> I will go shower.<eos> Since our imprint curates exclusive content for millennial readers, we're excited to launch our first title:<eos> "The Deciding Decade: Making Your Twenties Matter."<eos> The eBook will hyperlink to the author's genre-leading podcast and all social platforms.<eos> And for print, we're using biodegradable ink on 100% recycled, fair-trade paper.<eos> Yes. I like all that.<eos> Tap that.<eos> Uh, don't your people use Tap That?<eos> Of course we do.
Like the Japanese.<eos> - If that works for you.<eos> - Or the Swiss.<eos> I mean, the Swiss are delightful.<eos> Yes, so they are.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Oh, I was, uh, photographed at the opera benefit.<eos> So funny how those things make the paper.<eos> You look great.<eos> And so does your... girlfriend?
Light some candles, splash around.<eos> It's very exclusive.<eos> Sounds nice.<eos> Malks, are you coming tomorrow night for the full moon kavanot?<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Well, it was very nice to finally meet the famous Maggie.<eos> _<eos> Sorry, work.<eos> So, how did you know it was me?<eos> Well, I didn't at first.
Excuse me. Do you do commissions?<eos> Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> This is nice.<eos> See, we can hang out without Liza.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I can't believe she's gone a day and I already miss her.<eos> I know, me too.<eos> Do you think she knows how much I love her?<eos> Of course she does.
And what happened?<eos> I... I messed it all up.<eos> Why did you mess it up?<eos> Because...<eos> I'm self destructive.<eos> And?<eos> And... I don't know.<eos> Because you do not love him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
Enjoying the rain. - How you doing?<eos> -Hey, there, how are you?<eos> - [Annie] Hey! -This is Annie, my wife.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> [Chelsea] This is a nice little pad you got yourself here.<eos> How's your weed company?<eos> Well, we're just kinda kicking it off, but it seems to be fairly, uh, popular.<eos> Your publicist was telling me that you guys have really good weed to go to sleep.<eos> Yeah, well, I think there's some experts there, you know, trying to figure out,<eos> "This weed does this, this weed does that."
I'm gonna take the same amount, with less distractions.<eos> We're gonna have half the camera crew in there, lights down.<eos> I didn't come to this godforsaken country to not get high on ayahuasca.<eos> - [Maximo speaks Spanish] - [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish]<eos> - It's more than yesterday already.<eos> - He's saying, "Everything."<eos> [Maximo speaking Spanish] That's the whole dose you have to take.<eos> Thank you, I think.<eos> [Chelsea] I wanted to have the experience that I was reading about.<eos> And I did.
Believe me.<eos> I think you should call Kot, just in case he's trying to intimidate you for testifying against Freddie.<eos> Lucas?<eos> I'm Lieutenant Casey.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Yeah. You pulled my dad out, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... a lot of people are looking for you.<eos> I don't want to see them.<eos> I didn't, either.
We're just worried about you, that's all.<eos> Yeah, you got a hell of a way of showing it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> Look, it sucks to lose somebody, okay?<eos> Believe me, I've been there.<eos> [stirring music]<eos> I'm not trying to tell you how to grieve, okay, but you are gonna lose your job, and if that's what you want, fine. You can keep pushing everybody away.<eos> But I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> None of us do.
Didn't we do this once already?<eos> Well, this time, we have a search warrant.<eos> Which way is your laundry room?<eos> Who said I had a laundry room?<eos> I'll find it myself.<eos> And what possible reason would he have to do that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Maybe these, uh, these shirts, these shoes here, oh, look at that, these magazines.<eos> I like to read the articles.<eos> Right, don't we all?
It doesn't matter if I talk.<eos> Either you'll throw me back in prison, or he will kill me.<eos> He who?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> Ms. Warren. Please take a look at the posterior surfaces of the left third through fifth vertebral ribs.<eos> Now, run your finger along the damage.<eos> It feels like pitting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How does this help us find the path of the bullet?<eos> It doesn't.
I am not letting you make it.<eos> I don't care about any of the stuff in this folder.<eos> I need you.<eos> See you at home.<eos> It's a beautiful thing you've done for them, Booth.<eos> Kenny's done bad things. He's paid the price, but you know, he's taking responsibility.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> He deserves a second chance.<eos> And a family.<eos> They both do.
- I have nothing further to say.<eos> I have someone very special in mind.<eos> Group Captain Townsend?<eos> - Are you missing him?<eos> - Yes, I am. Very much.<eos> And are you missing your sister, Her Majesty, the Queen?<eos> Not quite as much, no.<eos> Why on earth did you say that?<eos> - What?<eos> I did! And I do.
This was harpy...<eos> The cutest seal.<eos> Aw. I can't hear you!<eos> Aw!<eos> The prosecution rests, but not before a quick round of high five with this awesome jury!<eos> What's happening, daddy?<eos> That man is on trial because he did a bad thing to a seal.<eos> I like seals.<eos> I don't like that man.<eos> No one does.
I'm talking about the shot.<eos> Oh, the shot.<eos> Yes, yes, we're ready for the shot.<eos> I know it sounds crazy, and I'm not asking you to just jump back into a relationship with me, but I... I think there's still something between us.<eos> Maybe we should talk about it.<eos> You-you mean, right... right now?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> How about we meet for coffee tomorrow before work at 8:00.<eos> If you show up, we talk.<eos> If you don't, then no big deal.
♪ I see love ♪ ♪ I see love ♪<eos> ♪ I see love ♪<eos> Boy, I just can't get over what happened yesterday.<eos> I know, neither can I.<eos> And the more I think about it, the more I have to wonder... shouldn't that yoga studio give us a refund for that class?<eos> Victoria, the woman just died.<eos> So, I should call in a few days?<eos> Well, that's what I'm doing.<eos> Hey. How'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
Keep your mother safe.<eos> All I wish is to see you grow old, father.<eos> To see you hold your first grandchild.<eos> To see me make you proud.<eos> That day passed long ago.<eos> Unhand her! Now!<eos> - In the name of the Medici! - Medici?<eos> Well, why didn't you say?<eos> Your name carries no weight here. - Medici.<eos> - And that of Albizzi does?
That's why your mother and I do what we do... to keep things like that from happening.<eos> Do you really think it makes a difference?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just hope we're all together when it happens.<eos> - Paige.<eos> - And quick.<eos> It's better if we just... get wiped out straightaway than get sick or anything.<eos> You shouldn't have to think like that.<eos> Don't you think about it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Step back.<eos> Step. Back.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's clear.<eos> Sorry to have bothered you.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Aunt Vi.<eos> Blue says the police were out here looking for something.<eos> They ain't find nothing, did they?<eos> No, they didn't.
Wh...<eos> Turn around. We're gonna go to St. Anne's in Virginia.<eos> Negative, ma'am.<eos> We're under strict protocol to get you to the White House bunker.<eos> No, no, I don't care.<eos> Just turn around, now.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am. Not your call.<eos> There could be a secondary attack.<eos> - Do you really think that might happen?<eos> - It did on 9/11.
You said 2:00.<eos> It's 2:15.<eos> Hand me a towel?<eos> Go.<eos> We can't leave together.<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> So unfair.<eos> She came out of nowhere a month ago.<eos> Sometimes I see her talking to herself.<eos> Oh, my gosh, you did too?
Passover doesn't belong to a person.<eos> Our dining room table wasn't big enough for everybody. I...<eos> I couldn't find the leaves for the table.<eos> Why do you do that?<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Because I just don't need all this.<eos> One of you had chicken pox.<eos> - Then don't eat it.<eos> - Who had chicken pox?<eos> - No, but I didn't... No.
You scraping so hard like you ain't ever asked yourself this before.<eos> I said, do you want to be here right now?<eos> And I don't mean, like, here-here, but I mean here in a cosmic sense, bro.<eos> Like, existence could be beautiful, or it could be ugly, but that's on you.<eos> How do I know which one's for me?<eos> Dream.<eos> You got to find out the future you're fighting for.<eos> Sometimes you got to close your eyes and really envision that shit, bro.<eos> If you like it, then it's beautiful.<eos> If you don't?
They had me committed.<eos> They had me sent away!<eos> We can find them, Dolls.<eos> How?<eos> They can blend in.<eos> They look just like us.<eos> - You won't help my sister?<eos> - Wynonna... she's already dead.<eos> You don't even know where they took her.<eos> Sure, I do:
Even in ugly things, I think you see beauty.<eos> Am I beautiful to you?<eos> No, don't look away.<eos> Am I ugly?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me I'm beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.
What the fuck?<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, you better run!<eos> Don't cry.<eos> What's up, Ter?<eos> Hey, you better get over here.<eos> Hector's sister's been on the TV talking shit, and he's fuckin' losing it.<eos> All right.<eos> How you doing?
Well, I'll ask him to be reasonable, but truly, Mr. Donovan, it's not in his nature.<eos> She left.<eos> And she took Stella.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> I got nothing left.<eos> You got nothing left?<eos> You smell like jail.<eos> Okay. I'll run us a bath.<eos> How you doing?
Apparently some of the parts I threw away were pretty important.<eos> I wouldn't drive the car over 40 till I get this figured out.<eos> My little Pep Girl.<eos> Hey, is that dinner I smell?<eos> It is.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> I made a pork loin.<eos> You take off that shirt.<eos> Say what you want, but my mother hit the jackpot when she married that one.<eos> We all did.
Look over there!<eos> Well, I'm stuffed.<eos> Rocket, they're not supposed to eat anything but grass.<eos> No, no!<eos> Ugh! No!<eos> Moombas have been plotting against us this entire time, and you mock me.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The moombas have been injected with an explosive compound, but it only reacts to a certain kind of protein.<eos> Don't eat meat, no problem.<eos> But if they do...
Well, I will admit that I had a special interest.<eos> Understandable, given your personal relationship with Dr. Rogers.<eos> I see, so you've talked to Chief Wells.<eos> I did, and then I talked to the prosecutor, who told me you met with her.<eos> Yeah, just to express my concerns.<eos> I guess she agreed to it.<eos> Hmm. And then she scratched him from her witness list.<eos> Did you talk to George Darrow?<eos> The witness?<eos> No, I did not.
More than anything!<eos> I can't tell you how disappointed that makes me.<eos> What?<eos> Didn't you hear anything I said earlier, or did the magic just knock it right out of your head?<eos> You can only depend on yourself, and sometimes that means you have to make the hard decisions.<eos> But she saved my life.<eos> Do you know what'll happen if people find out about her?<eos> Everything I've been trying to do for you... a good marriage, a chance to be queen... it'll all be over.<eos> But I don't care about any of that.<eos> Well, I do.
Witness saw it parked here last night.<eos> It was still here this morning so he had a look. Driver's shot.<eos> - Hassan El-Sayed?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - That's why we got it.<eos> - You said he didn't see anything.<eos> He didn't.<eos> He was outside Gibson's house the night she died and now he's dead?<eos> We don't think that's a coincidence?<eos> No, we don't.
Where are you going?<eos> To get a picnic of our own.<eos> You never said it were here. I didn't know.<eos> I assumed they were down at the sports centre.<eos> Come on.<eos> [CHILDREN SHOUT]<eos> Hey, hey, where you going?<eos> I thought we were having a picnic.<eos> I don't want a picnic.<eos> Course you do.
You already made me an appointment?<eos> I'm sorry, do you feel like I overstepped my bounds?<eos> That's great.<eos> You'll have more to talk about.<eos> And talk loud!<eos> Uh, hello, why aren't your clothes off?<eos> Um, so, do you remember when I told you I wanted to treat us both to some - spray tans?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, what if instead I treat us to some light espionage?<eos> - Gabi, you didn't.
Until I saw what was on it.<eos> I know that's me, but I swear it wasn't me.<eos> I would never hurt Staci.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I was at a dinner the entire time.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.
I like it.<eos> I-I was going to let you down!<eos> You sure did!<eos> Well, your hat was garish.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Have any of you guys seen the guy I was dancing with earlier?<eos> So, it turns out James got off right after I left him.<eos> On a possibly unrelated note, my wallet is gone.<eos> Trains.<eos> Mr. Hastings, we did it.
Top notch.<eos> I'll answer whatever, OK?<eos> Just put my necklace back on me, please.<eos> On second thought, you're not really in a position to do any bargaining, are you?<eos> OK, look, we just need the entrance to your old bootlegging tunnels, that's it.<eos> Let's say I was willing to help you. And I ain't.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
This will be my new pickup line.<eos> Look, Dad, Mom's makeover video already has 80,000 views.<eos> And you can make money off that?<eos> Even better, I get exposure.<eos> And how does that lead to your own apartment?<eos> Dad, you're so funny.<eos> Could not have been more serious.<eos> All right, I have got champagne and tissues for Shea.<eos> Champagne if she got the job.<eos> Tissues and champagne if she didn't.
Yeah, but she also was the dean of a university.<eos> Why would she start a hospital to cure only a handful of people with really obscure diseases?<eos> I mean, she had to pour every penny she had into this place.<eos> Who does that?<eos> She is rich.<eos> And why would she hire me and the Chanels?<eos> The Chanels are idiots, and she hates them.<eos> Like really hates them, hates them.<eos> I believe you got a theory.<eos> I do.
Wait, but... if Brock and Cassidy weren't there, then who just wheeled Tyler into surgery?<eos> Why are you strapping me down?<eos> Aren't I gonna be under some sort of anesthesia?<eos> Hello?<eos> Holy crap!<eos> Please. I don't...<eos> I don't want to die. Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, I-I don't want to die.<eos> Please don't...
Never about tequila.<eos> So, what are you up to now?<eos> Couple governor races.<eos> But coming off a presidential, these statewides seem so simple.<eos> I bet.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, I don't want you to get too comfortable.<eos> You...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Your husband has a target on his back.<eos> Well, anyone in public life does.
You risked so much to come here for that man? Not me.<eos> I'm here for the other guy.<eos> A man named Balinski is being held with Arkady.<eos> In Nazarovo Prison?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - No way you break anyone out of that place.<eos> - We know.<eos> That's why we need to get 'em moved.<eos> And you think I can move prisoners?<eos> We do.
It's gonna be so weird not having him here.<eos> Man, but there are other people who are just as much fun.<eos> It's like Barry's in the room.<eos> I got to hand it to him though. I mean, he landed himself in the perfect situation.<eos> How do you turn this thing off?<eos> Never mind that.<eos> Barry, Ashley tells me you're a hard worker, so we're gonna start you at the bottom<eos> - so you get the hang of things.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - Uh, what exactly do you do?
- No.<eos> - It's cool. I'll just go brush my teeth.<eos> James Franco? Oh, my God,<eos> James Franco is gone!<eos> Virgil must have took him while we were sleeping.<eos> You know what? This is it! He's gone too far.<eos> Really?<eos> This is worse than shooting at us?<eos> Virgil didn't take your pig.<eos> Who did?
It's, uh... been less and less.<eos> You know, it's part of the reason that caused the rebellion.<eos> But we've been told there will be a harvest soon.<eos> I know this is very hard for you, Theo.<eos> But it's also hard for them, you know?<eos> To find the right balance between not enough information and too much.<eos> You know, when you, when you wake up, and you're taken out of the cryogenic pods...<eos> You don't believe this.<eos> You don't believe any of this.<eos> At first, I didn't.
I'm now the voice mail on his phone.<eos> This is what he had me record.<eos> Okay. "Hello.<eos> "You've reached the voice mail for Dr. Oliver Wells,<eos> "the most brilliant "forensic anthropologist in the history of the Jeffersonian."<eos> Bones, this is, like, two pages long.<eos> How can you do that?<eos> It's humiliating.<eos> And what's worse is that tomorrow you and I will have to have a conversation with Christine about cheating.<eos> No, we don't.

Court business is at a standstill while the queen is away recuperating from her poisoning.<eos> However, I understand she's scheduled to return home soon.<eos> Very well.<eos> That concludes our business then.<eos> This was nice.<eos> Has been quite some time since we've seen one another.<eos> For business.<eos> I've had no need for diplomatic negotiations of late.<eos> So unless you have something else of an official nature to discuss.<eos> I do.
More like a thinly veiled threat.<eos> Tomato, to-mah-to.<eos> Obviously it's water under the bridge, because he wants to talk about collaborating on a project.<eos> "Richard Castle and Stephen King present."<eos> Wish me luck, ladies.<eos> Darling, if you think you're going to get top billing over Stephen King, you're going to need more than luck.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning, Captain.<eos> Hey, Lanie, how you doing?
But Scott didn't care about gender equality, did he?<eos> He cared about winning.<eos> Right, exactly, you found out his true intentions.<eos> You got pissed off, and you killed him.<eos> No.<eos> The truth is<eos> I knew what Scott wanted, but it was a chance to break new ground and... that's good for women, isn't it?<eos> Well, that's a hell of a justification for screwing over your teammates.<eos> I swear, I didn't kill him.<eos> Well, any idea who did?
Our boss.<eos> -It was you who leaked that video.<eos> -That would make me very skilled.<eos> You know more. That's what I'm saying.<eos> Do you want to hear a voice from beyond the grave?<eos> Or I guess crematorium would be more accurate.<eos> Did you know Hammern recorded people?<eos> I realised that a bit too late, yeah.<eos> I haven't got time.<eos> -Sure you do!
Sell illness?<eos> My wife will not be remembered as a drooling nappy wearer!<eos> He let people into his life.<eos> He sold his wife's death.<eos> He became PM.<eos> Don't you think she wants you to say what you did?<eos> That you took her back when she got ill?<eos> She wants you to win.<eos> -She doesn't even know what's going on.<eos> -No, but if she did...
Someone in my bank, familiar with our fund investments has leaked to the education minister, and they contacted NRK.<eos> -What investments?<eos> -You can't do that interview.<eos> -What investments, I said?<eos> -Erik, listen...<eos> They're going to ask you about me.<eos> Ulrichsen, a comment?<eos> Why are you pulling out of this interview?<eos> My dear wife doesn't want me to drag this fight down into the dirt.<eos> She doesn't, and I don't.
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
The question is: what was this guy carrying inside of his body...<eos> that was worth taking out a whole room full of people?<eos> We weren't supposed to meet for another 72 hours.<eos> Yeah, well, couldn't wait.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
So I went.<eos> You did?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, that's amazing.<eos> How did it go? Real bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It went real bad? Okay, well, you know what?<eos> about it, baby, I'm sure...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> They just didn't...
Hey, Marjorie.<eos> Hey, Christy.<eos> What's up?<eos> Remember that guy, Julian?<eos> Remember him?<eos> When I make love to Victor tonight, I'm gonna be picturing him.<eos> Okay.<eos> So the thing is... I was wondering...<eos> You didn't call him, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
Are you giving me kisses? Yes, you are.<eos> I knew you liked me.<eos> Oh!<eos> That's a...<eos> I'm not gonna tell Mike.<eos> I'm not gonna tell Mike that.<eos> I'm gonna be an amazing mother. Oh.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm telling you, Mike, it broke my heart giving Birdie back to her owners, but in the end, I think she might have loved me even a little bit more than she loved you.<eos> Of course she did.
Hey, that's the man who's gonna adopt your child, show a little respect.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I should.<eos> Another dribble.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think something's up with this spoon.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> So glad you're home, I got big news for you.<eos> Oh, I know, uh, Frannie already told me.<eos> She did?
We're not gay, we're just here 'cause we're black.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> And I'm here 'cause I'm the sister.<eos> Which makes me the aunt.<eos> That's all I'm allowed to say.<eos> Okay, well, now that you've met the whole gang, why don't I take you upstairs and show you where the baby's gonna sleep.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think you dropped a $100 bill.<eos> No, I-I didn't.
And you're a self-serving narcissist.<eos> Oh, slightly domineering.<eos> Wow.<eos> Much better.<eos> I had to get you healthy so we can do the transfer spell.<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
Princess Kalakare's 132 years old!<eos> That kid's not a day over 11!<eos> They can't do this!<eos> You can't do this!<eos> Brick, it's not like the couch.<eos> You got to sit down.<eos> Stop the movie!<eos> Oh, this is for the popcorn my mom bought before the movie.<eos> Uh, uh, she's very generic-looking, so you definitely saw someone who looks like her buying popcorn.<eos> And she did. With a credit card.
- I love you!<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> - I love you!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll get Maggie to call DCFS.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, Gabby.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Grant, hi, how you doing?
- Actually, it's up to me. There's a difference between proactivity and harassment.<eos> Okay, so what do you propose that I say to this girl?<eos> Tell her we're sorry, but the D.A. won't move forward.<eos> Get her a ride home.<eos> These are the hardest conversations that I have to have.<eos> There's not enough evidence to make an arrest.<eos> I was raped.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Don't you believe me?<eos> - Yes, I do, Kristi.
You know, like, "How was your weekend?<eos> Mine with the fam was awesome."<eos> Did she have any problems with anyone here?<eos> Oh, that's Danska, the nanny.<eos> She's taking the baby to Griffith Park for the pony and train rides.<eos> I'll just text, tell her not to forget the hand sanitizer.<eos> So did you notice anything suspicious last night?<eos> When you're focused on your work, Camille, do you notice anything else?<eos> I'm a multi-tasker, Jen. Just like you apparently.<eos> So did you?
I'll keep it in mind.<eos> Good.<eos> Once they got Eddie in the scanner, they found a blockage of his left main artery.<eos> It was cutting off the oxygen to his brain. It's why he fell.<eos> Wow. But they did an angioplasty, and it sounds like it went well.<eos> He got out about an hour ago. That's great.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it, Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
They helped me.<eos> With Peter, we have a connection and I never had it with anybody else.<eos> - Peter was very special.<eos> - You know, according to his rap sheet,<eos> - he's a forger and a swindler.<eos> - Yes, and that's the problem.<eos> He left prison with a price on his head.<eos> A man promised to kill him if he didn't pay back $50,000 he took.<eos> - And he came to you.<eos> - Of course he did.
Is it just me, or... Is it getting a little phallic in here?<eos> Drop it.<eos> Isn't this a fun surprise?<eos> You really thought you could double-cross me?<eos> Me?<eos> You know I invented the double-cross?<eos> Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah. I really do.
Drop it.<eos> Isn't this a fun surprise?<eos> You really thought you could double-cross me?<eos> Me?<eos> You know I invented the double-cross?<eos> Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah. I really do.<eos> Yeah, they all do.
I can help.<eos> My dad's a plumber.<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I got it. Um...<eos> Uh... she's not feeling well, so you should just get out of here.<eos> You can leave the basket there.<eos> Call the police, go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Would you please lock it?<eos> If I hear sirens, 'cause you just told those two kids to call the police, I am gonna cut off her nose right in front of you.<eos> - I didn't.
Studios starting at one million dollars.<eos> For a studio?<eos> - That's insane... if buyers aren't lining up.<eos> That is why I have you.<eos> All those contacts and famous names you mentioned during your interview? You should have no problem.<eos> So many accomplishments, and still just 32 years old.<eos> Fantastico!<eos> Wow. Ay, caramba!<eos> You don't have any contacts, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
Oh, here we are.<eos> See you later, Riles.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm pretty committed to this rela...<eos> Oh, god!<eos> And now for my second trick, I'll be making Danny disappear.<eos> Hey, bro, so I've been thinking about our conversation, and you gotta stop worrying about it.<eos> I'm sure Riley's not having any second thoughts.<eos> Second thoughts.<eos> Who said anything about second thoughts?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
What-what are you doing here?<eos> I heard you were having a hard time.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I just...<eos> I don't think I can do this interview.<eos> And you don't have to if you don't want to.<eos> No, but I do want to, that's the point.<eos> It's one of my #LifeGoals.<eos> I always wanted to open my heart and soul to José Díaz-Balart.<eos> Who doesn't?
And I sat out here, man.<eos> Thought about things.<eos> My dad, for instance.<eos> Ran half marathons twice a year, died of a heart attack out of the blue.<eos> Did she kill him?<eos> Things like that.<eos> Thought about taking the plunge myself, briefly.<eos> 'Cause I suddenly had no family.<eos> But then I punked out and headed back to good old Miami.<eos> But you do, though.
There's something else.<eos> What?<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> To me?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> She wants us to come over there.<eos> Well, that's interesting.<eos> Why didn't my dad ask them for help?<eos> He did, a bunch of times.
He was in New York.<eos> Meg lied.<eos> Why do you think she lied?<eos> You know what? To me, it sounds personal.<eos> I think you'd better talk to her.<eos> I think there was somebody in that house, not Alec Moros, somebody else.<eos> Danny.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I thought you didn't know where Danny was.<eos> I didn't.
I'll walk you.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't seem like it.<eos> I can tell by looking at you that something's wrong.<eos> When something's wrong with you, you look very old.<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Everyone says I've lived my life the wrong way.<eos> What do I do in times like this?
And your kids need to know that, no matter what, you love them and you accept them unconditionally.<eos> PAGE: I feel like I've felt angry all day.<eos> - And I feel like I feel angry all day 'cause we were just in Iowa, and we were surrounded by, like, so much homophobia.<eos> I don't have time for some conservative dude who's running for president spewing his shit, which is responsible for this.<eos> It just is.<eos> You can't tell me that it's not.<eos> You know, you have so much fu... you have so much influence. And... you are perpetuating a society that is homophobic, that is transphobic.<eos> At that point, you don't wanna hear about religious liberty. You don't give a shit.<eos> I don't give a shit, that you got your business shut down because you will not let gay people have a wedding at your venue.<eos> You just don't...
I'm his wife.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> How would you explain...<eos> the woman in my house?<eos> A trick of the light.<eos> The brain... is an amazing and mischievous organ. - Mm-hm!<eos> - Er, who keeps telling me that?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Anyway, I thought you were supposed to be a scientist.<eos> So did I.
- He can't help you.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I-I-I beg yours, sir.<eos> You often blurt things out like that?<eos> Insults or profanities?<eos> Do you suffer involuntary spasms or hear voices?<eos> You... You helped the reverend's daughter when...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - .. she was disturbed.<eos> Yes, I did.
Start turning the screws on every known gang member in the immediate zone.<eos> Shut down their drug spots. Lock them up for jaywalking if you have to.<eos> Start flipping these guys one at a time.<eos> Someone is gonna talk, especially if they're looking at time.<eos> - Commander.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Reverend. I don't have to tell you that this case is the highest priority right now<eos> Sergeant.<eos> You know Reverend Pembelton?<eos> Yes, I do.
Newsreader:<eos> According to the officials, Iran is the first country ever in the Middle East to actually be engaged in a cyber war with the United States and Israel.<eos> If anything they said the recent cyber attacks were what encouraged them to plan to set up the cyber army, which will gather computer scientists, programmers, software engineers...<eos> If you are a youth and you see assassination of a nuclear scientist, your nuclear facilities are getting attacked, wouldn't you join your national cyber army?<eos> Well, many did.<eos> And that's why today, Iran has one of the largest... Cyber armies in the world.<eos> So whoever initiated this and was very proud of themselves to see that little dip in Iran's centrifuge numbers, should look back now and acknowledge that it was a major mistake.<eos> Very quickly, Iran sent a message to the United States, very sophisticated message, and they did that with two attacks.<eos> First, they attacked Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil company in the world, and wiped out every piece of software, every line of code, on 30,000 computer devices.<eos> Then Iran did a surge attack on the American banks.
It's nuts! "Wizard, you shall not pass!" Seriously!<eos> Fine!<eos> I made a mistake! Are you happy?<eos> I gave them the wrong dimensions, and they screwed it up.<eos> I'm a screw-up! I admit it!<eos> Just please, don't let this be the only thing you remember to say at my funeral!<eos> So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.
Okay, we'll be right there.<eos> Love you.<eos> Buy a new car.<eos> -Where's Paul Anka?<eos> -He's chasing ice skaters.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> -You answered.<eos> You never answer.<eos> -Sure I do.
It was like her lips were falling off.<eos> Try convincing her that Willy Loman is not one of the characters in Aeschylus.<eos> -Oh, well, I'm learning so much here.<eos> -She had five martinis.<eos> Five.<eos> She got there before I did.<eos> I don't know what she had before.<eos> I've read about this woman.<eos> It all aligns.<eos> I did, too.
You've been spitting nails all week.<eos> Are you aware that the A-listers in this movie are all staying in Woodbury?<eos> -Painfully.<eos> -At the Cheshire Cat.<eos> The Cheshire Cat. With their watery orange juice, scratchy towels and really stinky croissants.<eos> -Yes, we're better than the Cheshire Cat.<eos> -We are better, but they have suites.<eos> Big, comfy suites with soaking tubs and mini-fridges.<eos> -We hate mini-fridges.<eos> -Of course we do.
I only took that half because you insisted I do it.<eos> I just figured you would take it back eventually, anyhow. I started.<eos> I didn't know if you noticed.<eos> - It started to look pink.<eos> - There were sparkles.<eos> - It's yours. Take it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> Yes, you do!
- Hey, do you play poker?<eos> - No. Not really.<eos> Hmm. Katy plays poker.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Ice cream? Mmm-hmm.<eos> - So you got my e-mail?<eos> - I did.
But it comes out your pores and people can tell.<eos> How much will we drink?<eos> We're not vaudevillians.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm just jittery.<eos> - Second thoughts?<eos> - No, you?<eos> No, no, no, no, no. I just...<eos> I have things planned.<eos> - You do?
I know.<eos> I'm just jittery.<eos> - Second thoughts?<eos> - No, you?<eos> No, no, no, no, no. I just...<eos> I have things planned.<eos> - You do?<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just figured.<eos> I do, too.
- Guys, hey.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Pierce.<eos> - Deal with it.<eos> - Morning, Mom.<eos> - Okay, I'm a memory.<eos> Make your lunches!<eos> Have a good day at school, and I love... all of you.<eos> I didn't have the heart to tell her it was Saturday.<eos> I never did.
We don't have to spend every night together.<eos> We don't spend every night together.<eos> - Yeah, huh.<eos> Ah, so, my dad called.<eos> Oh, is he still in London?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great.<eos> Of course he asked how you're doing.<eos> Did you tell him I'm happy to be back?<eos> I did.
Doc, can you please just tell her that this is crazy?<eos> I don't know anything about it, so...<eos> You know my chances of surviving this, right?<eos> Tell him that.<eos> We don't give percentages here.<eos> Well, then let me put it another way.<eos> Is there a chance that she could live?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you need to believe that you can.<eos> I do.
That you'd drop in here and we'd just pick up where we left off?<eos> I never meant to hurt you, Neal.<eos> You found someone else.<eos> After you and I were over. Fine.<eos> Whatever you think of me...<eos> Please don't take it out on this sweet little girl.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> In a lot of ways, I think I know you better than anyone.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
If you knew me at all, you would know I have to do this job my way.<eos> Is that what the, uh... The scrubs are all about?<eos> It's a start.<eos> Have a good day, Doctor.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> So good I want to crap my pants.<eos> But I guess those days are over.<eos> At least you have a sense of humor.<eos> I don't.<eos> Odell does.
I suppose I do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What if we couldn't get in this way?<eos> You've already done the hard part.<eos> No.<eos> The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
And that they shipped back, along with another 150 tomorrow.<eos> What's wrong with them?<eos> - Get Gene on the phone.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The motorcycles?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The city of St. Louis is broke, so they shipped them back.<eos> We needed this sale.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
It was a shed, not a barn.<eos> It was tiny.<eos> And... and you raced the Milwaukee motordrome in '13, right?<eos> I did.<eos> Man...<eos> You know, that race... that's what started this.<eos> It was legendary.<eos> But Harley... Harley-Davidson... They didn't race in motordromes, right?<eos> Nope.<eos> I did that day, unofficially.
It's very rare to have a female serial killer.<eos> They're usually not this violent.<eos> In her mind, she believes that she's not doing this for her own enjoyment.<eos> She's a vigilante.<eos> She really thinks she's making the Internet safer.<eos> So maybe that's her Graphic Warning:<eos> post photos like these, you could be next.<eos> You went to this boy's funeral just to snap this photo.<eos> Sometimes I wonder what you people are thinking when you post stuff like this.<eos> I really do.
It's gotta be here. We can find it using an app that makes wireless signals visual.<eos> Come on.<eos> I got it!<eos> Do they know where their son is?<eos> No idea. Jake's cell phone's off.<eos> They gave me the number of some of his friends.<eos> I'll make some calls. But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I do.<eos> - Good.<eos> I just don't want the jury to judge you every time you say "I invoke spousal privilege and elect not to answer the question."<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, members of the grand jury, please refrain from any such judgment.<eos> Now I'd like to turn to our first question.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, did your husband ever make a deal with Lloyd Garber to have his son released in trade for political contributions?<eos> No.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, just to be clear, you answered that question.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Everything all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Pretty fast for an associate to get an office, isn't it?<eos> Lucca's good.<eos> Seems like yesterday when we were.<eos> So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?<eos> - Did Diane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Is that all you've got?<eos> - We're gonna spill your guts out!<eos> - What now?<eos> - We take the long way around.<eos> This isn't nearly over.<eos> - Why do we hve so many enemies?<eos> - Dagen, tell us about the ax men.<eos> - The ax men is Rezzik, a notorious mercenary.<eos> - He mentioned a woman?<eos> - Yes he did.
Star-Lord and the rabble he insists on consorting with will be punished.<eos> I have no doubt they will, son of J.<eos> Dad, I can explain.<eos> (DOOR CLOSING) Don't blather, son.<eos> It's unworthy of your station.<eos> Where's the Seed?<eos> No, I mean, I really don't have it.<eos> I...<eos> Wait, you wanted me to steal the Seed.<eos> Of course, you did!
- I can't.<eos> We need to buy some time, so that they forget about it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> When the moment's right, I'll come for you.<eos> Mr. Alberto!<eos> Excuse me, I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Listen. I know you don't like me. You may have your reasons.<eos> But I'd like to have a little chat with you.<eos> We don't have anything to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
Yes, I'm scared.<eos> I don't like that I can't remember.<eos> I don't like that I go away.<eos> But I am also glad...<eos> Glad that I'm taking the medication... I hope it helps... and mostly, above everything else, I am so glad that I have you.<eos> I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better. I...<eos> I really, really do.
I came here on official bank business.<eos> And I also wanted to say good-bye.<eos> I told you the DEA called me about you.<eos> You might want to make sure they don't need you before you disappear off the radar.<eos> I perfectly understand that newlyweds often want time alone.<eos> Is that it?<eos> If I come home now, will I be in the way of your honeymoon?<eos> I don't know what you're talkin' about, Norman.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Okay, I did it for the medical insurance.
Why do you have this magical ability to make me feel calm?<eos> There's something I got to tell you.<eos> I'm, uh, I'm actually magical.<eos> I'm a unicorn.<eos> - You're a unicorn? - What?<eos> Is that what you said?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you...<eos> Did you say you were a unicorn? I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
Then-then Earp picked it up and-and-and Red...<eos> Caught a one-way ticket down south, right?<eos> Let me see if I got this straight.<eos> Malcolm kills her uncle, lures the heir back home, and now this?<eos> How many times do I got to tell you idiots?<eos> Peacemaker can't be touched by revenant hand.<eos> - But-but we-we just thought...<eos> - Don't! Ever!<eos> Think!<eos> I do the thinking... for all of us.
All by your lonesome?<eos> Art's staying late at work.<eos> What about, uh, Cissy?<eos> She's in Cincinnati for a realtor's conference.<eos> I could open up a bottle of wine, maybe order in some Chinese.<eos> How's your hand?<eos> How's his face?<eos> I got him good, didn't I?<eos> Really felt like I connected. You did.<eos> You-you definitely did.
The curtain goes up, and she's on stage in a starring role.<eos> Why else would she marry the man on the other side of the glass?<eos> Because she loves you.<eos> No.<eos> Because I'm her audience.<eos> I have front row seats, a lifetime booking to her drama:<eos> crushes, affairs, breakups.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you've been doing this work for years. Y-you're telling me you don't believe in the work?<eos> I do.
I'm trying to get a time guesstimate here, sweetie.<eos> -Make sure you wash your hands!<eos> [Claire] His character in Taste of Love is totally my favorite.<eos> I mean, I definitely liked him in Leaves in the Fall.<eos> He was a lot more, like, sensitive?<eos> Oh, and then there was An Arrow Through My Heart.<eos> He was a lot more manly.<eos> Oh, and then there was a time he played an alien -who didn't think he'd ever fall in love.<eos> -I love you.<eos> And then he did.
And we'll talk about it later, I promise.<eos> But, first, we have to get this restaurant back in order.<eos> Priority number one, happy ending, right?<eos> Ready to get your hands dirty?<eos> PARK JOON, CEO<eos> The CEO of a company should have an office that fits the title.<eos> But, Mom, this is Dad's office.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> Don't you miss him at all?<eos> Of course, I do.
Baby, you're not staying here.<eos> That's not your decision.<eos> Sweetheart, it's just not safe.<eos> Bernadette...<eos> You do not get to use that on me.<eos> Officer Shafe, you need to get out of here.<eos> You don't like that feeling?<eos> Wondering if I'm okay, if I'm coming home?<eos> Who's gonna watch after Bernadette?<eos> Well, neither do I.
She's postictal and protecting her airway.<eos> Let's get another head CT and page pediatric neurology.<eos> This is what you were talking about, huh?<eos> Yes, seizures can be a part of her condition.<eos> How long will she have 'em?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Her whole life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That woman has a long road ahead of her.<eos> They both do.
You take care, Megan.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Let me clean you up a little, Theo.<eos> Pam Pilcher.<eos> What about her?<eos> She said she was in Hawaii when they took us.<eos> Some of them came here on their own, you know.<eos> People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!<eos> Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
But you must wonder.<eos> All the differences.<eos> Y'know - the way she was when she came back.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What happened to us, Sam?<eos> We managed - we struggled on for 11 years after she was taken.<eos> What were we doing, just fooling ourselves that it could all just go back to how it was before she went?<eos> We got through it then because I loved you.<eos> You and Matthew and Alice...<eos> and I still do.
Julien, are you OK?<eos> Sometimes I get headaches.<eos> Your friend foundMirza Barzani fast.<eos> We should be there soon.<eos> 'Julien? '<eos> I wonder if you can help us.<eos> We're trying to find this girl.<eos> She might have passed here yesterdaybetween four and six o'clock.<eos> Oh, yeah, I remember her.She came in here.<eos> She did?
She killed herself.<eos> The DNA results are back on the remains in the shed.<eos> We ran them against your husband.<eos> It's a confirmed match with your daughter.<eos> It's really Alice?<eos> I'm sorry. She asked me.<eos> She begged me.<eos> It's not Matthew's fault that this happened.<eos> He knows what he's done.<eos> You both do.
I promise.<eos> He's gone.<eos> ♪ Oh, my love<eos> ♪ And be OK<eos> You're back late.<eos> I wanted to show you this.<eos> Eve came by the pool.<eos> We don't need to discuss that.<eos> We just...<eos> We just don't.
Only that he was involved, in some way.<eos> Involved?<eos> How?<eos> Oh, love, it's not...<eos> What does Stone know about what happened to Alice?<eos> The wrong man was convicted for this crime.<eos> And, yes, I believe former Brigadier Stone knows something.<eos> And you believe this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You can start in the workplace with a joke or two.<eos> You know, "Hey, uh, hard at work, or 'hard' at work?"<eos> And that's funny in the bank.<eos> One good joke that makes people laugh can change the way they feel about you forever.<eos> Imagine you with an extra sparkle that can make people laugh.<eos> And that's why we're on the planet.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> It's bad.<eos> What? Who died?<eos> We did.
The secretary was a spy.<eos> She just disappeared.<eos> I guess it was really hard for Mr. Beeman to talk to her father.<eos> I-I just went over there looking for Henry, and he... he started telling me this stuff.<eos> Can I drive?<eos> I need more practice.<eos> That's Dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
I could put on some Stéphane Grappelli.<eos> Do you enjoy jazz?<eos> Sure, tradition was great.<eos> I'm also a big...<eos> Well, there's more than enough. - Yeah.<eos> - Uh, well, I'm really...<eos> - I think...<eos> - We gotta get going.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - We do? Yeah, we do.
Bill, it doesn't matter.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Burgers on me, by the way.<eos> You're on full scholarship.<eos> You want to know one thing I'm always gonna remember?<eos> The all-you-can-eat Tattle Tail buffet?<eos> No, it's the look on your face when you finally grasp the real meaning of...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - "Do you enjoy jazz?"<eos> Oh, my God, I actually do.
Question two... who's the second season winner on "American Idol"?<eos> Anything?<eos> I was three.<eos> Aw, fuck!<eos> Chemical Brothers for number one, and Ruben Studdard for number two.<eos> Leon!<eos> God! "Sommersby."<eos> You... where did you even get this?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Oh, no, I don't.
I will let you go.<eos> I will never ask you to marry me again.<eos> If you say here and now you do not love me.<eos> Frank?<eos> Mama is looking for you.<eos> You're to open the ball.<eos> Good.<eos> You shall open it with him.<eos> Unless Mr Moffatt would object.<eos> So what if he did?
I knew it'd be empty for the winter. So.<eos> I thought it'd be safe.<eos> I understand the desire to protect your son, believe me.<eos> But what were you so worried about?<eos> A cop gets shot out of the blue.<eos> You never know why.<eos> You never know if they're gonna come after the family.<eos> Vince, Nancy being shot is an unbelievable tragedy, but to think your family is in danger, that's a bit of a stretch.<eos> Unless, you know something you're not sharing with me.<eos> I don't.
Can't you just give it a shot?<eos> What happened to your person?<eos> My person?<eos> My person was busy.<eos> She had company. I don't know.<eos> Anyway, besides, it's your turn.<eos> Can't you just call your little pretty friend?<eos> Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.<eos> She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract.<eos> Yeah, dude, she does.
Then they start talking shit about me to the press.<eos> "TheWhiteBitchDidlt" is trending on Twitter.<eos> Thanks, friend.<eos> You think that has anything to do with the video with you threatening him on it?<eos> You mean outside the Ferry building?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> I got in his face for, like, 30 seconds.<eos> So that's your whole thing?<eos> You think that makes her an actual suspect?<eos> Well, Twitter does.
She saw you drinking.<eos> She knows who else saw you drinking.<eos> I tested under the limit.<eos> That is the only real evidence.<eos> How the hell did you screw this up?<eos> Come on!<eos> The screw-up was yours, Mario.<eos> Do you actually buy this whole fraternity of prosecutors thing you tried to sell me?<eos> Because, oh, man,<eos> Melissa Danson doesn't.
- You're a liar!<eos> You're lying, just like you lied about how you killed that nurse.<eos> I saw how much you were drinking that night. I saw it!<eos> - Marty...<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> You know, you're never gonna be a leader if you underestimate your enemies and undervalue your allies.<eos> I don't benefit from your failure, Marty.<eos> I handpicked you.<eos> I believed in you.<eos> I still do.
They both saw other people.<eos> He was with other women while he was with you?<eos> No, we were in love.<eos> You know, I-I...<eos> I don't have to explain myself to you. No, you don't.<eos> Listen...<eos> - Um, I think that came across...<eos> Sorry,<eos> I thought we had a scheduling meeting.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we do.
- Yes, I am.<eos> She has a couple of questions for you.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Millicent.<eos> Dr. Harrison.<eos> Does Pierce know who Isabelle really is? Yeah.<eos> So you told him too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, Alex.<eos> Did you and Pierce... you didn't...
No, he was not.<eos> In what way did he not cooperate?<eos> Mr. Siletti refused to accompany us for the blood draw until I used the word handcuffs.<eos> In your law enforcement experience, do DUI suspects sometimes try to postpone testing in order to lower their blood alcohol levels?<eos> Objection!<eos> Calls for speculation and conclusion, Your Honor.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Inspector Navarro, um, when you observed Mr. Siletti immediately after the accident, did he appear to you to be intoxicated?<eos> No.<eos> He did not.
Martin Reardon. I'm the Acting District Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco.<eos> Were you drinking alcohol at the defendant's birthday party, Mr. Reardon?<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Alcohol gives me headaches, so I usually try to stick to water and soda.<eos> You were completely sober all night, weren't you?<eos> Objection.<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Did you observe the defendant drinking alcohol?<eos> Yes, I did.
Show me.<eos> Why didn't you just conflict yourself out?<eos> I knew he was guilty.<eos> This is you, Ms. Danson, on your knees?<eos> You should both be ashamed of yourself.<eos> A prosecuting attorney intimate with the defendant on the night of the crime!<eos> Alleged crime, Your Honor. - It's outrageous!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you know anything about this situation, Counselor? No, sir.<eos> I did not.
No, this is so inappropriate.<eos> I have to tell my mom.<eos> - That's not that much. - No.<eos> By then, I'll have sold my consulting firm and moved on to a tech start-up, which really sets me up for my Senate run.<eos> I have a 15-year plan too.<eos> Well, and a 30.<eos> Really, it's never too early to start planning the next three decades of your life.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> You know, Liam said we'd get along and he was right.<eos> He did, did he?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Well, I hope she's worth it, 'cause right now, she looks like a scared kid in way over her head to me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't tell the attorney general that.<eos> To wrangle this rendition, I had to make it seem like Hijriyyah held the key to Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.<eos> Maybe she does.
Shit!<eos> - Will you come round the pet shop? - What for?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Face-to-face.<eos> What do you need to talk about?<eos> Summat I can't talk to you about on the phone.<eos> Ivan got mugged. All right.<eos> What did the police say?<eos> Did you tell the police, Ivan?<eos> No, you didn't.
You were supposed to bring her here!<eos> Oh, my stars.<eos> Richard?<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I get it.<eos> Hey, just... just before I go.<eos> That afternoon, did you hear Todd going on about some sweet deal he pulled off?<eos> Er, no.<eos> You didn't?
Is this...<eos> Iran, yes.<eos> This is the view from our holiday apartment by the Caspian Sea.<eos> The water is very beautiful and warm, although in Iran no-one goes in the water, we just walk on the sand.<eos> The boys don't want to go in without the girls, and we have to stay fully clothed.<eos> Someone's always watching.<eos> Government informers are everywhere.<eos> It's better now. Ten years ago you would just be taken off the street.<eos> At least in this country, we thought we would know who are enemies are.<eos> But we often don't, do we?
I'm afraid I'm having trouble placing events in my long-term memory.<eos> Two things - get that search warrant for his house, and can someone confirm that he did buy this Ferrari?<eos> From Karen's flat.<eos> The watch.<eos> Unopened. Matches the amount on Simon's statement.<eos> So she was telling the truth.<eos> It was lucky, really.<eos> We might only see one or two second-hand 458s a year.<eos> Mr Hamilton had been in a week earlier and said if I got one in, he'd buy it.<eos> And I did, and he did.
- Got her.<eos> They're heading north on the 9.<eos> Got it.<eos> César, sit.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sure you know I'm very interested in what you have to say.<eos> I come here with mutual interests in mind.<eos> I see, so this is like a goodwill visit.<eos> But you have nothing to offer.<eos> But I do.
By lumping me in with a lot of other people?<eos> Not a lot of other people, Dwight.<eos> A lot of other murderers.<eos> It is my understanding that the word "murder" or "homicide"<eos> is reserved for the unlawful killing of other human beings.<eos> My so-called victims were either involved with or already were part of an inferior race, and therefore, it is my defense...<eos> The 6 adults and 2 children under 10 shot to death by the defendant were human in every sense of the word<eos> - Sustained. Claiming your victims were unworthy of life because they were minorities is not a defense, Mr. Darnell.<eos> Make your point, if you have one.<eos> I do.
God, I don't believe it.<eos> I'm gonna get your prelim started so you don't have to come to the morgue, okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Your honor?<eos> Any idea how that gun could have been loaded?<eos> No, the disabling wire is checked always before it comes into court by both the DDA and the deputy.<eos> The wire was clipped.<eos> All Dwight had to do was pull it out, which he could have done through the bag.<eos> That's what I looked like from where I was sitting.<eos> Maybe deputy Simms and Rosen just did a visual check of the wire, sir.
And you were turned down because of your grades. English lit, "d." Algebra, "f."<eos> World history, "d."<eos> If you would read Jordan Graff, who is a Harvard law graduate, by the way, you would realize that the public-school currICUlums have been adjusted so that white people do more poorly than minorities!<eos> It's all being done on purpose!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll read Jordan Graff.<eos> Who is he?<eos> He is someone who is helping us regain our fatherland.<eos> Do you know this Jordan Graff, personally?<eos> Yes, I do, very well.
We need cannon fodder.<eos> We need new Chanels for the Green Meanie to attack so he doesn't murder us!<eos> Uh, you already have that, Chanel.<eos> Her name is... me!<eos> The Green Meanie's already tried to murder me twice.<eos> Yeah, and pretty soon, he's probably going to succeed, and then where will we be, Number Five?<eos> It's time to start taking desperate measures.<eos> We need to start interviewing patients.<eos> Why do you think you'd make a good Chanel?<eos> Um, I don't, actually.
How is any of this my fault?<eos> What did I do to you?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You were born.<eos> Born an Al Fayeed.<eos> You are here because of what your family did to mine.<eos> My father's trying to change that.<eos> You think you know your father?<eos> You don't.
No, no, no.<eos> We handled it.<eos> It's our perp.<eos> Aly, I want you back.<eos> I...<eos> - I-I want you back.<eos> - Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?<eos> I miss having you as my partner.<eos> Do you want to tell me why you left?<eos> 'Cause you never did.
_<eos> Ah... wine...<eos> The last refuge.<eos> Or the first.<eos> Hey, Mom, did you call a car mechanic?<eos> Honey, the heater's broken.<eos> Why would I call a car mechanic...?<eos> I most certainly did.
Um... you know what? We should be leaving.<eos> If we're gonna go...<eos> Yeah. - ...make it to that...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - My brother believes in me.<eos> And I'm starting to think that he's the only one.<eos> - Well, no, I also was just saying that I believe...<eos> - Deb does.
I forgot my phone. Could you just grab it for me?<eos> Oh, uh, yeah, sure.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Oh, look at this.<eos> It was recording this whole time.<eos> Oh.<eos> Should we listen to it?<eos> Don't.<eos> Dean, you don't... you don't have to.<eos> I-I did it.
Do you even know what that means?<eos> You're... you're calling me a relic out of time, and all I'm saying is that I really care about music, and that matters more than ever.<eos> It's not something that can be bought.<eos> It's not something that you can contain in a rubber billionaire's rubber palace.<eos> You're dreaming if you don't realize that it's all different now.<eos> You know, you have a beautiful smile.<eos> You should... use it more.<eos> Do you want to get out of here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Motorcycle industry is booming. And you limit your potential with sentiment.<eos> You should never have written that editorial.<eos> You'll never catch up with Indian after that.<eos> We did what we thought best.<eos> Those motordromes sell out darn near every event.<eos> Their riders are stars.<eos> Now, some of them dead stars, sir.<eos> They basically make money for the manufacturers, you know.<eos> And fans love it.<eos> Everyone does.
You want to come over here, feel like a winner?<eos> Walt!<eos> Indian is down!<eos> Another win for Harley-Davidson!<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> Hey. Hold him.<eos> It's true.<eos> Nobody tells you that everything changes when you have a baby.<eos> Well, they do.
It's just you.<eos> This still with DeLuca?<eos> Yes, "this still."<eos> I don't even know what "this" is, and I don't need to figure it out in front of everyone else.<eos> How's our cheerleader?<eos> Well, there's no sign of a bleed.<eos> It looks like a mild concussion.<eos> What if it ends?<eos> Then I'm the woman who dated the pretty boy and it all fell apart.<eos> We done here?
His mother agreed.<eos> Clear!<eos> Okay, charge to 150.<eos> Get that epi on board.<eos> Bailey, we told his mother we would not resuscitate.<eos> Clear!<eos> - 200!<eos> - Bailey!<eos> His heart stopped?<eos> Yes, it did, but only just for a second, and then...
We believe he was completely focused on his responsibility to the patient.<eos> Well, thank you all.<eos> Sounds like they feel he tried.<eos> And yet two people are still dead.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> S-Six months?<eos> No surgery for six months?<eos> Uh, to be clear, it's a six-month suspension from the Residency Program.<eos> I'm suspended from the hospital? ! Yes.<eos> How do you...
You're nice.<eos> I am?<eos> Mm-hmm. You're a good person 'cause I say mean things all the time and you just smile.<eos> You're nice.<eos> So nice 'cause you do things for people, and I don't.<eos> Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.<eos> And that's why you're gonna succeed in life... 'cause you get people forks.<eos> When you say you need a fork, I just say, "Why?<eos> You can eat out of your dog bowl."<eos> Who does that?
All we need is a hair, a cell, a drop of blood.<eos> We'll find something.<eos> I like your optimism.<eos> Joe Harris had financial problems.<eos> He was a month or two from filing for bankruptcy when Alice arrived at the prison.<eos> - She saved his ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did he know the contract and the money came from Alice?<eos> - Unclear.<eos> - He did.
A couple days ago, a guy ran when he should have listened.<eos> Cops saw him dumping white powder down the runoff.<eos> They couldn't recover it, so they couldn't arrest him for possession, but...<eos> Do we know where he is?<eos> I have someone bringing him in right now.<eos> Yes!<eos> Sorry. We're not open.<eos> - Joann.<eos> - Angela.<eos> How you doing?
That's because you don't know her very well.<eos> She's dangerous, and we need to find her before she hurts somebody else.<eos> - Says you.<eos> We just wanna know how to find her. - I don't know.<eos> - When was the last time you saw her?<eos> It's been a while.<eos> The officers that found you two in the tunnels said you were pretty well set up.<eos> I'm sure you don't want us to be bothering you all the time.<eos> - Don't you guys have better things to do?<eos> - We do.
- Me?<eos> N-No, no, no.<eos> I haven't even talked to him since this engagement.<eos> Besides, that man could eat me for breakfast.<eos> Okay, let's say we buy that.<eos> Elaine is missing.<eos> Do you have any idea why or where she might be?<eos> You know, I always say, "Love is so hard to facilitate."<eos> Which means these women don't have valid - immigration status?<eos> - N-N-No, they do.
- Well, that's good, right?<eos> - It is.<eos> No further cognitive loss.<eos> I'm experiencing a little dizziness, but, um...<eos> - Whose house is this?<eos> - R-Really?<eos> I pranked you.<eos> You believed me.<eos> I pranked you and you believed me!<eos> I did.
- We work together. Come on.<eos> Bring the tongue tearer, though.<eos> - You're gonna need that.<eos> - Yeah, he does talk a lot.<eos> Jane.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> - I'm glad you're okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I have time, if you needed the confessional.<eos> Actually, I don't.
Just fair warning, I'm really in a mood to punch somebody.<eos> That little call to my boss ratting me out - got me suspended!<eos> - Not my intention. Oh!<eos> Should I put that on my unemployment application?<eos> - Might be a good idea.<eos> - Excuse me? ! Don't think I'm afraid to punch a fellow hottie.<eos> All right, I just meant that now you have the time<eos> - to work the case with us.<eos> - You believe me?<eos> We do.
Frankie...<eos> I'm so sorry, Clair.<eos> You were right about Robert.<eos> I found something in the M.E.'s autopsy report on Robert's Seattle girlfriend.<eos> The wound pattern and the stair matched perfectly. But what the M.E. missed 20 years ago was the force in which her head hit the stair.<eos> That's why the police ruled the death accidental.<eos> So he must've pushed his girlfriend down the stairs and then stood over, taken her head, and slammed it against the bottom step.<eos> According to this case file, yes. But our victim's head wound was so significant that I couldn't conclusively match it to the stair or the field hockey stick.<eos> Why use a field hockey stick when he knew how to kill her with his bare hands?<eos> He didn't.
It was the two of you at the beach, remember?<eos> It doesn't look like he has any clothes. - Oh!<eos> - Really? - No.<eos> So, whatever happened to Johnny?<eos> - He pulled a real disappearing act.<eos> - Did you say...<eos> - disappearing act?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> Oh, I think I know that trick.<eos> - No. You really don't.
I'm not.<eos> I'm mad at you.<eos> Look, Joann has a right to feel any way she wants, they're her feelings, not mine.<eos> Okay.<eos> And if my being with you meant that I was at slightly more risk of getting shot at, then so be it.<eos> It's a risk I'm willing to take.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> So you broke up with me under false pretenses.<eos> So I reject your breakup.<eos> You do?
You love writing.<eos> Yeah, but maybe the truth is that I'm not particularly good at it. Why?<eos> Because you didn't hit it out of the park on your first try?<eos> I'm wrong until I'm right on every murder we've got.<eos> Okay, they're bringing in my suspect.<eos> Jane.<eos> Did you really like the chapters that you read?<eos> - Honestly.<eos> No sugarcoating.<eos> - Yes. I did.
Got to go. It's Jane.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Bye, hon.<eos> Yeah, I think he wants me to be the one to push him to retire, but I know it's got to be his decision.<eos> Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.<eos> Found at least 12 people that said he was at the bar all night.<eos> Let's hope Maura found something.<eos> Please tell us you found some DNA, and I'll... give you 100 bucks.<eos> - I did.
Look, Bourbon Bob, or whatever the hell your name is, you think this is a game it's one I came back to finish. But this time,<eos> I make the rules.<eos> And no one will stop me.<eos> Not Bobo, not Black Badge, and certainly not a useless son of a goddamned bitch like you.<eos> Willa, no...<eos> He wasn't giving us anything.<eos> He wasn't ours to kill.<eos> - Dolls... - ...has nothing to do with this curse and certainly has a serious attitude problem.<eos> I don't like him, Wynonna.<eos> Well, who does?
- No.<eos> OK.<eos> OK, go.<eos> Shit.<eos> Willa?<eos> WILLA!<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Do you remember me now?<eos> Yes, Robert.<eos> I do.
What was that?<eos> Whatever's down here, Khlyen was willing to sacrifice three Killjoys for it.<eos> D'av? Anything?<eos> It's him. Paolo, you bastard!<eos> Tanya!<eos> We're losing you!<eos> D'av, you got her?<eos> Not here.<eos> Paolo?<eos> What did you do to her?
I think the Russians are coming after her.<eos> Call me when you get on the road.<eos> Go grab your things, we're leaving.<eos> What happened, where's Alexei, where's my father?<eos> I'll find out what's happening as soon as we get moving.<eos> Just, please, just hurry.<eos> I'm fine, I'm fine, help Jeremy.<eos> - What is she doing here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - How did she...
Do you?<eos> Hey, Sam, two seconds.<eos> So, about that little conversation you just had with Danny, he was wrong to ask you out.<eos> He's with Riley.<eos> He is?<eos> What a jerk.<eos> Yeah, he sure can be.<eos> I'm annoyed with him, too.<eos> Did he at least tell you that I wanted to have some one-on-one time with you?<eos> No, he did not.
Buttercup has a clock in his head. He can do the course in perfect time.<eos> Don't forget how he runs across the pasture whenever he sees me.<eos> He's an angel on this earth.<eos> And he moves like a cat.<eos> The way he transitions into a canter, it's like...<eos> like...<eos> Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Can you cut it out?<eos> God, it feels like you don't know even know me.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's frustrating.<eos> You were there when Hizb al-Shahid set off that dirty bomb.<eos> - Our children were there!<eos> - I know! Well, HS still has nuclear material in their possession.<eos> Stopping them has to be our first priority.<eos> I get it, Elizabeth!<eos> Well, I...<eos> I do.
- Yes.<eos> In a little while. maybe a week.<eos> So I guess I'll be seeing you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Got to get back to work. - Sure.<eos> - He's a young kid; he's healthy.<eos> He will heal fast.<eos> you kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> I kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> Everybody does.
- Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.<eos> - Good job.<eos> We are definitely surprised.<eos> - Where's Pop Pop?<eos> - Sweetie.<eos> Nigel is 45.<eos> He doesn't really like to be called - Pop Pop.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Did you hear about Grandpa's malpractice case?<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.<eos> Option number one is going over there and telling Siefert he's a piece of shit for cutting you like he did.<eos> That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
For my family.<eos> Well, then you got to be strong for them.<eos> Right?<eos> Man, you're Nick Kovac.<eos> They can't tell you shit.<eos> Right?<eos> Fuck Siefert.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> How you know I needed that?<eos> I didn't.
And what inspired that decision?<eos> There's still families Alderman Becks hasn't helped out after the tornado.<eos> They need it more than I do.<eos> Is that one of the issues you'll be bringing up in the final debate?<eos> The final debate was last week.<eos> Alderman Becks' campaign told us one more debate was being set right before the election.<eos> Um... this is the first I've heard of it.<eos> Do you mind if we go inside to talk?<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> I do, actually.
How far along are you, April?<eos> I'm 12 weeks.<eos> 12 weeks.<eos> I was coming to tell you...<eos> When did you know?<eos> Did you know before the divorce?<eos> Did you know before we signed those papers? - Uh...<eos> - April?<eos> I... yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
No, honey.<eos> No.<eos> But he's the other parent.<eos> If April's keeping things from him...<eos> Still.<eos> Still, no... about the baby.<eos> About the baby's future and the baby's health. Doesn't matter.<eos> - Without him.<eos> - No, it still doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.
No, I did not.<eos> I wanted to do what the patient wanted.<eos> - Oh, and you got to let this go.<eos> - Oh, what's that?<eos> If you're still feeling guilty after all this time, that's your deal.<eos> Stop taking it out on me.<eos> Guilty?<eos> What have I got to feel guilty about?<eos> Oh, you think it's all my fault, but I never quit.<eos> You did.
And she forgave you?<eos> Yeah, eventually, but, uh, you know, still comes up from time to time, but, you know, it faded.<eos> Well, I thought this was gonna fade, but hasn't yet.<eos> I mean, it took some apologizing.<eos> A lot of apologizing.<eos> I just I told her I would never intentionally do anything to hurt him.<eos> Or her.<eos> You know, and... she knows that because she knows me, but, um... sometimes you... you just have to say it.<eos> So, I freak her out by telling her I love her, and she lies to my face.<eos> Who does that?
Come say hi to Biscuit. Okay.<eos> How do you do? Oh.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Biscuit!<eos> I am sorry, Felix. He doesn't usually do that. Oh, it's fine.<eos> I'm sure he's just skittish around strangers, you know?<eos> Who's a good boy?<eos> Biscuit's a good boy.<eos> I hope he has all his shots.<eos> Oh, I do.
I am no expert, but pretty sure you should hold it the whole time.<eos> Good thinking, Murph.<eos> Well, let's try this again, shall we? Okay.<eos> And...<eos> Good to go.<eos> Look at this... I'm motoring!<eos> I am answering the call of the open road. - Whoa.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> - Waah! What did I do?<eos> Hey, babe. How you doing?
He's literally covered in it.<eos> But n-n-no, no, despite our differences,<eos> Oscar is my best friend.<eos> I want to win, but not that way.<eos> You are a good man, Felix Unger.<eos> And you're gonna make an amazing president.<eos> And you are going to make a great First Lady. Once we lock down a more appropriate campaign hairstyle.<eos> You don't like my hair?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do not.
Okay, for my first official... docket to the decree... of the agenda... I would just like to say that... you all made a horrible mistake electing me.<eos> I didn't do any of the stuff you're thanking me for.<eos> Felix did.<eos> Oscar, you don't have to do this.<eos> No, I want to.<eos> I don't deserve this hammer.<eos> I may or may not have started the garbage chute fire.<eos> And I may or may not have tried to put it out with vodka.<eos> I don't deserve to be president.<eos> Felix does.
It should be okay to remove the sensor.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let's get you both out of here.<eos> Let's get you up the ladder.<eos> Let's get you out.<eos> I see movement in that window.<eos> Get those people out of there.<eos> Life is nothing compared to heaven.<eos> We have no choice now.<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah, he could be working on something bigger than Pearl Harbor.<eos> Heads up.<eos> Sam and his party have arrived.<eos> Back to the right, room three.<eos> The ladies are from the Chamber of Commerce. Both have been background-checked.<eos> I love it.<eos> Sam, what song will you sing?<eos> No, I'm sorry. I'm working, sir.<eos> Do you like Broadway show tunes?<eos> Of course, who doesn't?
Here, guys, you can stay on the comms with us, but I think we're okay.<eos> (sighing):<eos> In the meantime, let's get to work helping Ralph win this case.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, the air is clean enough to breathe now.<eos> Let's get going with the seismograph.<eos> Happy, how long is it gonna take?<eos> Not long if you don't distract me.<eos> You didn't tell her you were out on a case? Hmm?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Get to the override.<eos> I'll evacuate them.<eos> I'll go with them.<eos> Great, maybe you can find something else to shoot.<eos> Are you saying the ants are smart enough to know that they can cause this...<eos> - what's it called?<eos> - Runaway fusion reaction, and no, they're not that self-aware, it's more like a biological imperative.<eos> There, just... back up, don't let them anywhere near you.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Yeah, I did.
What did he say?<eos> He knows we won't do anything with humans around.<eos> That's it?<eos> He's a liability to all of us, he needs to be put down before he kills anyone else.<eos> More bodies to bury.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - The coordinates for where I laid Karen Morgan's body to rest. For Jeremy.<eos> He wants to visit her grave.<eos> Jeremy appreciates everything you do to protect us.<eos> We all do.
- Really?<eos> Okay, well, your face is so expansive that the lensing effect is such that a light passing within one Astronomical Unit has a radius of curvature - of six E to the ninth meter. - Ooh.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, too bad. A body from the Anacostia River just came in.<eos> Yes!<eos> You cheated.<eos> You like cheating, yeah?<eos> You, do you?
- Currently I am not.<eos> ... then I will have him swab the fracture.<eos> Sorry. Am I, uh, interrupting a date?<eos> Maybe a drug deal?<eos> Excuse me for a minute.<eos> Yeah, just a minute.<eos> Or maybe five to ten years.<eos> So... you aren't a groupie at all, are you?<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You did.
Have you considered that you may have yourself a poltergeist?<eos> Daisy, I am not being haunted by a ghost.<eos> I didn't say you were being haunted. I just implied that you may be the magnet.<eos> Spirits tend to focus on one individual. Usually, they're trying to send a message.<eos> A message like what?<eos> I need to empty my trash?<eos> I would have thought that someone who's convinced that alien beings built Stonehenge would be more open to the paranormal.<eos> Daisy, I'm open as long as it has scientific basis.<eos> I mean, come on!<eos> Ghosts do not.
What?<eos> You collect jazz records.<eos> A week before Morland's deal fell apart, you sent a few very long e-mails to someone named VinylVenue43.<eos> He was offering to sell you some rare albums; you wanted a better deal.<eos> Do you know what a Vigenère cipher is?<eos> It's a form of encryption that allows a person to hide messages inside regular texts.<eos> You weren't looking to buy any records.<eos> You were sharing information with the competition.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing that VinylVenue43 did.
I got you.<eos> No.<eos> Please stop!<eos> You enjoy human suffering.<eos> The cry of animals merely depresses me.<eos> People are not animals but puppets... dolls, toys.<eos> And toys are meant to be played with.<eos> I do believe a few more strokes and your toy will be dead.<eos> She deserves it.<eos> But the innocent life inside her womb does not!
I wanted to be with you.<eos> I wanted to start a new life with you.<eos> That's what we both wanted, or at least I thought it was until you said we could be friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> You broke my heart.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mellie...<eos> I really did care about you.<eos> I cared about you, too.<eos> I still do.
- I've been a Republican my whole life.<eos> Liv is not paying her kidnapper.<eos> David and I don't have any money.<eos> - You're Democrats.<eos> - So that leaves...<eos> You and me.<eos> No. That leaves you.<eos> I didn't grow up on an estate in Santa Barbara.<eos> I don't have $5 million sitting around.<eos> Yes, you do.
They set a trap for him, Shine and Frank Thatcher.<eos> They construct this animal fight to draw us out, but we shall see Shine's claws pulled from him first. DS Thatcher.<eos> Reid, Reid, Reid, Reid, Reid!<eos> I want him found... now!<eos> Come onto these yellow sands and then take hands.<eos> Foot it featly here and there, and let sweet sprites the burden bear.<eos> Two Christmases we now have had you home with us, Princess<eos> Alice, two Christmases since the river sprites carried you ashore to us.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I do, Daddy Horace.
Anyway, turns out, Andrea used to go out with Adam.<eos> So?<eos> She caught him cheating on her, and then he cheated on that girl, too.<eos> So he's a player.<eos> Apparently.<eos> (sighs heavily) That's a shame.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> What do you mean, what is she going to do?<eos> She has to tell Bonnie.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
He started rambling about how I killed his team, which I expected.<eos> But then...<eos> He started to laugh...<eos> Like he was delighted.<eos> And I'll be honest with you, in that moment, I was scared...<eos> Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.<eos> I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.
Ok, warden, we're 5 minutes out.<eos> Guys, the swatting, the reference to Asher-- this is exactly the larger plan we profiled.<eos> It worked.<eos> Rawdon has another group he's been working from the inside.<eos> By the time we clear Hotch, they'll be gone.<eos> Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
It smells as though it's powered by paraffin.<eos> It's at times like this that I say to myself,<eos> "What would Sister Evangelina do?"<eos> Well, first of all, she'd mention the war and then she'd remind us we're here for our patients.<eos> Soon you will have no more pain.<eos> Put her in the general ward, the end bed, so she can feel the sun coming in through the window.<eos> I suspect she has leukaemia.<eos> She presented four months ago with joint pain and exhaustion.<eos> Did you consider sending her somewhere larger, perhaps for radium treatment?<eos> No, I did not.
What about me mum, was she a big eater?<eos> Big moaner, more like.<eos> No. She was always busting me balls about growing the business.<eos> I had to get out in the end, she was driving me barmy.<eos> What's your business, then?<eos> I'll give you a clue.<eos> You have it hot when it's cold, cold when it's hot, and you serve it with a ladle straight out of a pot.<eos> It's soup.<eos> Oh, I like a bit of soup.<eos> Well, who doesn't?
Mm?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm absolutely fucking dandy.<eos> How was the hunting trip? Great, yeah.<eos> We caught a bloody big bear.<eos> With your little stick? Yeah.<eos> I just grabbed him by the 'orns and stuck it in.<eos> Right.<eos> Not sure bears have horns.<eos> This one did.
I was eight years old. I liked the hats.<eos> They are nice hats.<eos> So, you want to shag me in the cloister or what?<eos> Er, I'm happy to do it in the vagina, like normal.<eos> That room there.<eos> Oh, right!<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Well, erm, I don't think we need a starter. Shall we go straight to the mains?<eos> Let them have a starter if they want one.<eos> We do, yeah.
at your daddy's...<eos> Hold it.<eos> I thought that subject was off limits on date night.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Probably.<eos> The main reason you're by yourself is so you can figure out what you want... really want.<eos> And if you're always feeling bad or guilty, how are you ever gonna know?<eos> Probably won't.<eos> I want you to thrive, Tawney.<eos> I really do.
By the way, Jakob says hello.<eos> - You met again then.<eos> Yes, do you mind if he sleeps here?<eos> No, but change the sheets.<eos> - Quiet! Let's switch to the videos...<eos> - They're talking about the assaults.<eos> With us, Eva Carlsén. Social psychologist and columnist.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We're all shocked by these videos.<eos> Who does this sort of things?
He didn't do it on purpose.<eos> There's just... There's a point where we couldn't deny our connection.<eos> I don't wanna hear any of this.<eos> Just go.<eos> Please, just leave me alone.<eos> Why didn't you tell the police what you saw?<eos> I was scared that they wouldn't believe me.<eos> That they'd think that I killed her.<eos> Why wouldn't they?<eos> You did.
Since seeing this hospital, and the way it loves, respects, and heals its patients, it's made me realize how wrong I was to hold onto my anger.<eos> The past is the past.<eos> I'm reborn!<eos> Put her in the cage!<eos> Move it! - Come on, move it.<eos> No, no!<eos> Mom.<eos> I'm so sorry I let you down.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
Women and children, huh?<eos> You did it, didn't you?<eos> You did it!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Linda doesn't know, does she?<eos> That you're leaving?<eos> Yes, she does.
It doesn't mean he didn't kill Grace Gibson.<eos> And what?<eos> Someone else came and moved the body?<eos> Maybe.<eos> He's connected to the victims, the car, the bracelet.<eos> He had the opportunity.<eos> You can't rule him out because he's got a bad back.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You killed Hassan!<eos> I didn't...
You want the truth?<eos> James isn't Georgie's father.<eos> But you said...<eos> I didn't give birth to him.<eos> After my first attack, I interfered, to try to force my values, my increasingly outmoded values, on you all.<eos> My motive was love.<eos> The outcome was unfortunate.<eos> So this time, I... I want to use my reprieve to see you all happy... happily yourselves.<eos> I like this new grandmother.<eos> Mm. I do too, rather.
Do you think we can use it against Amara?<eos> What is this?<eos> The Rod of Aaron.<eos> A Hand of God.<eos> If we're gonna fight her, what better way to arm up than with an actual dose of His power?<eos> It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
I will give you the Horn if you help me exorcise Lucifer from Castiel's vessel and then return him immediately to the Cage.<eos> Oh, that's all?<eos> Okay. And where is this horn?<eos> Safely hidden, naturally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Crowley, even if we could exorcise Lucifer out of Cass, the Cage is damn near impenetrable.<eos> It took a spell from the Book of the Damned to spring Lucifer, and Rowena hid the book.<eos> And we would need both the book and her to even have a shot.<eos> Did I say this would be easy?<eos> No. I did not.
I'm back.<eos> Okay. S-So now we all just saw what happens when she's in a bad mood, which, apparently, she's been in since the dawn of time.<eos> I think she just rattled heaven with a flick of her pinkie finger.<eos> That's not a big enough dose of reality for you?<eos> Why are we arguing?<eos> We all know that he has to go back in the Cage.<eos> Yes, when it makes sense.<eos> Amara's the big picture here now, okay?<eos> Look, in order to take her out, Lucifer has got to have the Horn of Joshua.<eos> He does her, we do him.
Could be.<eos> Or it could be that all the guys that were out there when I was a kid are too busy running companies to have time for hams.<eos> Yeah, or they moved online.<eos> There must be some new kids out there.<eos> I'll be out in a sec.<eos> CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Wind's a Giants fan. It does what it needs to do.<eos> It beats the hell out of sweating bullets in Arlington.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why I'm a Houston fan.<eos> Air conditioning like God intended it.<eos> Where was God when Nolan Ryan left that one hanging for Will Clark the other day?<eos> You want to get that?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> This is more important.<eos> Yeah, hey, we appreciate the extra attention, but don't you fellas have a receptionist?<eos> Of course we do.
Uh, I just wanted to say that... that I don't think you should charge for the user version.<eos> Why didn't you say that in the meeting?<eos> I've been here for, what, a week and you plunk me down in some senior staff meeting.<eos> What was I supposed to say?<eos> I just agreed with everyone else.<eos> But that's not right because it's not what I think.<eos> I'm sorry you couldn't keep up in the meeting.<eos> You made a promise to people that you wouldn't charge them.<eos> I didn't promise that I wouldn't ever charge them.<eos> Of course you did.
- It's a thing you say.<eos> Okay, look, we don't have to discuss this ad nauseam, but we thought saying nothing seemed equally stupid.<eos> So we're saying something.<eos> We are aware that bringing a marriage into the workplace is complicated and we're doing the best we can, okay?<eos> Now, can we try to get back to where we were?<eos> Okay, great.<eos> The big Ryan-shaped hole.<eos> Did you find any prospects last night?<eos> No, but I decided we don't need anyone.<eos> - Of course we do.
A while.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Packing up some of Clare's things.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I couldn't stomach the idea of the Agency cleaning crew coming in to do it.<eos> That little shit used to hide all of her favorite things.<eos> I know.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She never said it.<eos> I did once.
It's a career-defining opportunity.<eos> Tell Tel Aviv I want out of Berlin. Nothing you or they say will make me change my mind.<eos> How's Steven?<eos> You know he's taking the fall for Iosava's rendition.<eos> There's a warrant out for his arrest.<eos> Everything's a total clusterfuck. How do you think he is?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you know something?<eos> Does Mossad know where he is?<eos> We do not.
And you're such a good everything.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Parked a little close.<eos> Hey.<eos> You look...<eos> Okay, don't mind me.<eos> I'm just gonna go out the passenger side.<eos> Catch a...<eos> Oh. Didn't mean to...<eos> Meant to do that.
I betrayed my friends.<eos> I betrayed a cause that I believe in.<eos> - I betrayed Mom. - No.<eos> Even you...<eos> look, I know that you're relieved that I'm here,<eos> - but I betrayed you too. - You did not betray me.<eos> Then what was all this talk about the strength of your convictions, Dad?<eos> That's what you teach boys.<eos> What, you didn't believe it?<eos> I did.
You think he's right, don't you?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> No, you didn't say it, but you do.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> Did you two talk about this?<eos> What?<eos> No, you sound paranoid.<eos> You know, I wish people would stop saying that to me.<eos> He loves you.<eos> We both do.
The point is this.<eos> There was no book club.<eos> Turns out, she'd park her car down by the river so she could cry, alone.<eos> And then something happened.<eos> She stopped making excuses to be somewhere else.<eos> And the girls and I stopped being a placeholder.<eos> And we became her life.<eos> I get all that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, Stefan.
Bonnie doesn't have that luxury.<eos> So go to her.<eos> I can't. I can't give up.<eos> I'm not asking you to give up.<eos> I need to make sure that she doesn't.<eos> Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
Oh, God.<eos> I killed her.<eos> You can't blame yourself, Matt.<eos> I don't.<eos> I blame you.<eos> If you want to talk about Stefan, that's okay, all right?<eos> I didn't have anything to say to him then, and I don't have anything to say about him now.<eos> But there hasn't been any closure.<eos> - I don't need closure.<eos> - No, I do.
She failed to mention that by giving Bonnie her life, she was actually giving Bonnie her lifestyle.<eos> So now when Bonnie wakes up, she's gonna be Rayna 2.0.<eos> And does that gift begin with a very long nap?<eos> I didn't get a chance to ask as she burst into flames.<eos> And before you ask, no, I did not get a chance to interrogate her little shaman friend, because he vanished at the same time.<eos> Damon, did the spell work or not?<eos> ! I don't know, Enzo.<eos> I have no idea why she's not waking up.<eos> I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.<eos> What if she doesn't?
Okay?<eos> We don't have a case. We need to settle.<eos> So we're gonna admit defeat?<eos> You okay with that, Deano?<eos> What do you think?<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Well, Dean wants to get involved in a side story. Oh.<eos> So he can see if it sparks something in the real case?<eos> - That makes sense to you?<eos> - Hell yes it does.
So he can see if it sparks something in the real case?<eos> - That makes sense to you?<eos> - Hell yes it does.<eos> - Have we found the side thing yet?<eos> - Still looking for it. I have some ideas that I think...<eos> Todd! What did I tell you?<eos> You said, "If it works."<eos> And do we know if it works yet?<eos> Claire? Oh.<eos> No, we don't.
You look baffled.<eos> You're not how I pictured you.<eos> When you hear someone on the phone you make your own image of him...<eos> How did you picture me?<eos> Did you bring the brooch? - - Yes.<eos> You see the hair?<eos> Why didn't you give this to the police?<eos> I was... 8 years old.<eos> I thought this belonged to my little girlfriend.<eos> - - But it didn't.
♪ You might feel a little sick, baby ♪<eos> You wrote your autobiography.<eos> Ish.<eos> I mean, there are chapters, it's kind of a loose structure, uh, but, I don't know, something's missing.<eos> I'm - - I'm stuck.<eos> You want to get the old band back together.<eos> Lennon and McCartney ride again.<eos> Well, I'm kind of Lennon and McCartney, so...<eos> But every writer needs a good editor.<eos> I did some of my best work with you, Metatron.
You both know who we might need to help deal with the Darkness.<eos> You're Metatron?<eos> The Metatron?<eos> I'm not an archangel, I'm the scribe of God.<eos> Chuck Shurley?<eos> He's a prophet of the Lord.<eos> I don't know how prophets are chosen.<eos> I don't want to be a prophet.<eos> No, you don't at all.
- Whipped cream?<eos> - Ooh, I like the way you think.<eos> I like this restaurant.<eos> Um, I called my order in?<eos> - Hey, there!<eos> - Oh, hey! That's a nice surprise.<eos> Actually, I was gonna come by your shop later.<eos> For what?<eos> Did you hear about the new zip-line opening up at Alder Falls tomorrow?<eos> I did.
Even if I didn't get credit, I'd still do it.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Working at my dad's office is not fun.<eos> Parties and hanging out with my friends, - that's fun.<eos> But that's all soon coming to an end.<eos> My dad is insisting I find some kind of school club to join.<eos> - And what's wrong with that?<eos> - I'm not a club kind of guy.<eos> You don't know that until you try.<eos> Oh, I did.
He is a very gifted liar.<eos> Took me many years to find that out.<eos> Those poor voters, they never stood a chance.<eos> Anyway, gentlemen, we're here to discuss business, so I'd like to start now.<eos> I'm sure you're all aware that ever since I left, profits have dropped 15%.<eos> I made a deal with Jimenez.<eos> I gave them a piece of my Dallas operation, and in return, they will move our product.<eos> In addition to that, I want to regain market share, and in order to do so, I need to increase shipment by 30% a month.<eos> We don't have the infrastructure to move that amount.<eos> Ah, but we do now.
Listen.<eos> You forget that my ability for kicking ass is precisely why you hired me.<eos> Shut up, Annalise!<eos> You come in here yelling at me, your boss, and you think that's gonna get you what you want?<eos> It won't.<eos> So let me put this simply for you.<eos> There's a saying where I come from... whoever can't hear must feel.<eos> So do it.<eos> Make me feel.<eos> Somebody already did.
Where are you?<eos> Leaving the funeral home.<eos> - Oh. How was it?<eos> - Lovely.<eos> Stupid question.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Have you seen Frank?<eos> - No.<eos> You'll call me when you do?<eos> If I do.
You protect me.<eos> And I just want to do the same for you.<eos> How's...<eos> How's Meggy?<eos> Is she good to you?<eos> Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.
And I just want to do the same for you.<eos> How's...<eos> How's Meggy?<eos> Is she good to you?<eos> Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I really did.
Edith poisoned herself.<eos> That's insane.<eos> She must've known about Karen's secret e-mails - and did it to herself.<eos> - You have no proof.<eos> Let's just say I can understand why a mother would want to punish her ungrateful children.<eos> Okay, so, you confront her during her deposition?<eos> No.<eos> You confront her during her deposition.<eos> What... you don't want the automatic "A"?<eos> Yeah, no, of course I do.
I have never felt such grief until today, when I realized I might lose my only son, Charles, as well.<eos> As a mother, I feel helpless watching my son be persecuted for a crime he did not commit.<eos> As a citizen, I feel anger towards the system that allows innocent people...<eos> What you reading?<eos> To be wrongfully imprisoned.<eos> Just the news.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> What? If I hacked your laptop, would I find out that you're actually reading about Wes' court case?<eos> Did you not hear me when I said that I wanted to stay in the bubble?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Maybe it's because you're afraid that I'll really know who you are - and not like him.<eos> - You do know me.<eos> Parts of you, but guess what, Connor...<eos> I want to know everything about the guy that I'm with...<eos> The good and the bad...<eos> That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
Don't get strip-searched, thrown into solitary.<eos> Don't get my teeth knocked in.<eos> Did you report this?<eos> In Rikers?<eos> The COs and the gangs run that place.<eos> Every female inmate in there knows that.<eos> Every time he'd do me, he'd say,<eos> "Cry all you want, "but you're just a broke, "black crack whore.<eos> Who's gonna believe you?"<eos> I do, Charisse.
Uh, your client ready to plead guilty to multiple counts of rape?<eos> Let's be realistic here.<eos> You don't want to take a corrections officer to trial.<eos> You don't want to put yourself through that.<eos> I hope that's not a threat.<eos> It's a reality.<eos> My guys already feel like they're under attack.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Two counts, criminal sexual act, - in the third.<eos> - So your guys does, what, a year and a half?
I got to go!<eos> Oh! Sorry!<eos> - Bad table. Sorry!<eos> - Sue, no.<eos> Sue?<eos> I'm humiliated!<eos> I'm mortified!<eos> My professor thinks I have a crush on him.<eos> Why would he think that?<eos> Because I do!
PETER: You wanted me to steal the Seed.<eos> Of course, you did!
You were gonna take your brother's money for that?<eos> And pay me back how, huh?<eos> You've never worked a full week in your life.<eos> How many others have you floated this past?<eos> - No one.<eos> - It isn't like that.<eos> - And what is it like? - We made the engine.<eos> - It works.<eos> - It works?<eos> It did, until, uh, it didn't.
You are not an artist.<eos> You are a misogynistic phony.<eos> And all the little fangirls who support you are just as bad.<eos> But when you stole my image, you messed with the wrong woman.<eos> You all deserve what's coming.<eos> So you can understand why we wanted to speak with you.<eos> Can you tell us where you were the past two nights between midnight and 6:00 a.m.?<eos> I was here, sleeping.<eos> You sounded pretty serious about getting revenge against Ephraim Hill and women like Phoebe.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Previously on Elementary...<eos> Emil Kurtz.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> We have a friend in common, Morland Holmes.<eos> Oh, uh, nice to meet you.<eos> In other words, he asked me to find you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing that VinylVenue43 did.
Previously on Salem...<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She deserves it.<eos> But the innocent life inside her womb does not!
All three guys are at Wyckoff Correctional.<eos> I'm gonna go talk to them.<eos> Take Frankie along.<eos> His ex-con insouciance counterbalances your prosecutorial squareness.<eos> You two, review the confessions.<eos> Conviction Integrity Unit?<eos> You think there's a chance you could get us out?<eos> Depends if our review finds significant issues with your conviction.<eos> I never touched the woman.<eos> None of us did.
No baggage? -<eos> - Yes, this one.<eos> Where are we going? -<eos> - To your place.<eos> What was Jackie Berglund doing here?<eos> How do you know she was here?<eos> - - What was she doing?<eos> - - Being questioned.<eos> Who decided to let the bum in?<eos> - - I did.
Okay.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> If I can't walk, then I can't work, and then I can't pay for college.<eos> College. That's great.<eos> What are you studying?<eos> I'm in business school.<eos> I wanna be a sports agent.<eos> I'm not just some dumb girl in a bikini.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Lots of people do.
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.<eos> I raised four boys.<eos> I've seen a lot worse.<eos> Why don't you lay back down for another sec, J.<eos> Something's happened, J, something that involves all of us.<eos> You're in this family now.<eos> You're gonna be seeing things, hearing things that need to stay in this family.<eos> Do you get it?<eos> Smart kid.<eos> Of course you do.
- Yes.<eos> Don't encourage him, please.<eos> Yo, I got to make up for lost time.<eos> Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick.<eos> Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand? - Is that it?<eos> - And change my bed pan? Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.

You painted over the whole thing.<eos> So, here's what's gonna happen, Andre.<eos> You're suspended for two days.<eos> And then when you get back, you're gonna be on lunchtime cleanup duty.<eos> Wait-- suspended?<eos> I work. I don't have anybody to watch him.<eos> His mother's not exactly available.<eos> What about all the bullying?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Walker, but Andre has to learn that his actions have consequences.<eos> Yeah, they sure do.
So, um...<eos> Mose?<eos> I thought it was okay to date within the group.<eos> Oh. No, no, no. I-<eos> - I was just wondering-- is there anything you'd like to share?<eos> I think Gloria pretty much covered it.<eos> [laughter] [therapist] Okay.<eos> Um, Pilar, yeah, since we're on the subject, do you miss being intimate with Oscar?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
- With my wife.<eos> Did you use protection?<eos> 'Course not.<eos> [Tommy] You know, I've been doing the math.<eos> Um, you said that you slept with Rie when you two were both working a Valentine's Day gig in the Hamptons.<eos> Right?<eos> Which-- which gig exactly?<eos> About when did that happen?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> We did a bunch of those things--
What?<eos> - Oh. - Oh.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And see... these buttons?<eos> - Hey, man. - Hey, man.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's Cath and Lena?<eos> Oh, Lena came down with the flu that Cath had last week.<eos> Now, you and I both know that's a lie.<eos> We do.
You're lucky you and I are just talking right now.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Family comes first.<eos> Everything else is second.<eos> You understand me?<eos> I need to know you're not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> Are you gonna do anything stupid, J?<eos> No.<eos> I wanna believe you.<eos> I really, really do.
I am doing this to protect him.<eos> Let me be very clear.<eos> You are in this situation because you are weak and selfish.<eos> And you're gonna get yourself out of this situation by being weak and selfish.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> If you wanna tell yourself you care about this kid, be my guest.<eos> But you will do whatever you need to do to get him talking because you don't want to go to prison.<eos> I owe you big-time.<eos> - No, I was happy to do it.<eos> - No, I do. I do.
Well, that didn't take long.<eos> Julius Burton is officially throwing all his financial support to Sam Evans.<eos> I'm tired of worrying about what men like Burton do with their money.<eos> I'm not going to renew the Defense Cooperation Agreement with Bahrain.<eos> Instead, we're going to move toward building a new base in Tunisia.<eos> We're going to bring our military and economic support to a country that has earned it.<eos> What about the next administration? What happens when all this executive action is rolled back in January?<eos> Already writing a presidential obituary?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You did that yourself.
You will begin this process immediately.<eos> Now, don't worry, after your interviews and your polygraphs, most of you will keep your jobs, but it just probably won't be here.<eos> I realize this is a lot to process, so we're going to try and make this transition as quick and painless as possible.<eos> It's obviously going to take a few days to complete the handover, during which time I ask for your continued cooperation and patience.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel like we're being punked.<eos> How is SECNAV allowing this?<eos> I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Actually... I do.
Sorry.<eos> It's just sometimes, when he asks me for sympathy, sometimes...<eos> SHE SIGHS Cry, woman.<eos> I'd cry.<eos> I'd be snotting all over the place.<eos> The times when I...<eos> I'm only saying this to you.<eos> You do understand that, don't you?<eos> He says he needs me to believe in him.<eos> And I do.

You used the word, I didn't.<eos> I'm going for a smoke.<eos> Paul.<eos> I smoke alone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I was delighted you came round.<eos> You can't remember?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I don't think you lie...<eos> I think you believe everything.<eos> But you exist... ..on one layer, quite purely.<eos> Good husband layer, good man layer... ..and then there's another layer.<eos> And on that, you're less good.<eos> But you... You treat them both separately.<eos> And then there's the third layer. And on that... ..you are capable of anything.<eos> Now is not the time for this conversation.<eos> I think you did it.<eos> I do.
If it means ending the war one day sooner,<eos> Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.<eos> But she doesn't have to.<eos> Look, I know you and your team think we're a group of irresponsible losers, but I know Ray Palmer, and he has a plan to get out of that bunker.<eos> We just need to give him time...<eos> Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
- And that was my hat.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> - What's this?<eos> Oh, uh, that's nothing. Don't open that... You don't have to open...<eos> You opened it.<eos> Did you draw your own superhero costume?<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You, Jax, and Ray, stop the train.<eos> The rest of us, we'll deal with Turnbull.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Of course.<eos> This isn't my first rodeo.<eos> I wanted to say that.<eos> There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.
That's about it.<eos> Could I... could I maybe just take a peek at it?<eos> I'm sorry, it's just something I need to see to know what I'm looking for.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Great, thank you.<eos> Wait, why does this say the body's place of discovery was Williamson when it was found on the waterfront in Leawood?<eos> The body ended up in Leawood.<eos> There was a strong current this morning, so chances are that it originated from Williamson.<eos> Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.<eos> - You done?
Didn't you talk to Joe about this?<eos> - Yeah, so?<eos> - So it clearly didn't help.<eos> What would you have done if Jesse wasn't there, huh?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> Because there's nothing you could've done.<eos> Because you don't have powers.<eos> Only room in our family for one speedster, Barry?<eos> Please just stop trying before you get yourself killed.<eos> - You done?
The two of you were a brother-sister superhero crime-fighting team.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad.<eos> So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster. I...<eos> I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.

I suggest that you acquire that trait.<eos> Soon.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Traveller has been taken.<eos> I repeat, Traveller has been taken.<eos> The Dominators have the President.<eos> - Hey, son.<eos> - I don't understand, Dad.<eos> No one in this family wants me to have powers. You don't.<eos> Barry doesn't.
Not him.<eos> Some idiot in a hockey mask.<eos> I'm sorry. Did you say a hockey mask?<eos> Everything ok, boss?<eos> A Stardust dealer was killed last night by a vigilante.<eos> Lots running around the city these days--<eos> Wearing a hockey mask!<eos> Hey, short fry was there, too!<eos> Thanks, Rene.<eos> Rory and I didn't, though, just for the record.
This surveillence video is from the western annex of the bottling facility.<eos> The fire was nowhere near this location, and yet...<eos> Do we know who this guy is?<eos> Well, firefighters generally have their names printed on the bottom of their turnout jackets, but this bag is blocking it, and happens to be the perfect size for two stolen hard drives.<eos> After this, we lose him.<eos> We don't like the implication either.<eos> But we can't ignore it.<eos> Simpson's killer may be one of his fellow firefighters.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No one does.
Today was a great day.<eos> I feel like Iron Man at the end of the day.<eos> We should save people from burning buildings a little more often.<eos> Not bad for a couple of rookie firemen.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Let me ask you a question:<eos> Did you guys actually put out any fires today, or did you just start 'em?<eos> A little bit of both.<eos> G needs a new photo for his I.D.<eos> I don't. I really don't.
She was being entertained.<eos> That's an assumption.<eos> No, sir. Observation.<eos> What do you got, Loretta?<eos> There's no sign of external trauma.<eos> Copious amounts of blood; possible internal bleeding.<eos> Bloody T-shirt. Men's extra-large.<eos> Probably used in an attempt to staunch the bleeding.<eos> Who'd you say the room belonged to?<eos> I didn't.
I also spoke to CID.<eos> They have asked us to keep them updated.<eos> Well, here's what we got so far.<eos> Our forensic scientist tested the wine from the general's room-- no poison.<eos> He and Brody are at the Monteleone, looking other possible sources.<eos> And, yes, they're being discreet.<eos> I looked into Rebecca.<eos> Now, she is a squared-away sailor, pays her bills on time.<eos> I mean, no one had an obvious motive to kill her.<eos> Well, of course, they didn't, right?
- You okay, man? - Yeah, fine.<eos> It's just, you opened that same cabinet, like, three times.<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> So you just try the fridge. Second shelf.<eos> So what happened at work today?<eos> They sent me home.<eos> I'm fine, you know, but 'cause I have a history of mental illness, they send me home when I make one mistake.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
Anyways, the food fest was amazing.<eos> I made so much tips, and, uh, Kamekona, he, uh... yeah, he won best original dish for, uh, that, uh, that, uh, three-alarm chili shrimp dog.<eos> Yeah, that was so good.<eos> So, uh, what... what'd you want to talk to me about?<eos> Sit down for a sec.<eos> Uh, I don't know why I'm crying.<eos> He wasn't really a good person.<eos> Yeah, he was still your father.<eos> I got no more family left.<eos> Yeah, you do, pal.
If we could get back to Dr. Daudier, ma'am.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry. I have to... I have to go.<eos> I'll be...<eos> Laurel.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing, um...<eos> Weren't you on DoubleSpeak?<eos> Uh, last minute change.<eos> Chief of staff did it.
We were waiting for help.<eos> Angie said she couldn't breathe, and... she was wheezing.<eos> I thought she was going into shock, so I tried to keep her calm until the ambulance came.<eos> But then her eyes started to swell shut, and, um, her, uh, her skin broke out.<eos> She was unconscious before the ambulance even got there.<eos> Strange as it may sound, if she was allergic to something on the shooter's clothes, it might help us catch him.<eos> Was she having any symptoms before he grabbed her?<eos> Is it possible it was something in the food?<eos> No. She didn't have any food allergies.<eos> No one in my family does.
It's not gonna happen.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Couple guys from their crew got rolled up by cops.<eos> - They think...<eos> - You said they were on board.<eos> It went sideways.<eos> What do you want me to tell you? That kid needs to stay locked down at his place.<eos> - Thanks for trying.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
Warm it up for you.<eos> Whose house is this?<eos> Yours.<eos> It belongs to a member. They're working in San Diego for the next 18 months, so it's empty.<eos> Your mother won't know it's ours.<eos> I could see you at that desk, studying, college applications. Where do you want to go? Uh, NYU.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll bet you'll get in.<eos> Scholarship.<eos> You just need a room of your own, right?<eos> Everyone does.
Hey, Polly...<eos> Have you ever met a person and just known that you didn't have to worry about them?<eos> Like, no matter where they go, everything's gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.<eos> She's a detective.<eos> She helped me a lot.<eos> So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?<eos> I didn't.
He's in respiratory distress. Mollie, we need a bed in here!<eos> Okay. We can't. Just keep him on the gurney!<eos> Let's go. Take it, take it, take it!<eos> We got you, we got you.<eos> You paged me?<eos> It's... 2:00 A.M.<eos> Bri, you should be sleeping.<eos> I heard the nurses talking.<eos> They said I'm gonna get the transplant.<eos> Of course, you did.
I made a mistake.<eos> I want you back.<eos> Jesus, Drew.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You don't get to do that.<eos> This was fun and terrible.<eos> And when it got too much, we stopped.<eos> That's what this was.<eos> I miss our life.<eos> So did I.
What's going on with my foster mom?<eos> Is she gonna be okay?<eos> We got our top doctors working on her.<eos> So as soon as I know more, I'll let you know.<eos> I promise.<eos> Now, in the meantime, Nina, your social worker, is gonna come hang out with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's that? What...<eos> You don't like her?<eos> No, I do.
It's an email from the astrophysics lab.<eos> I got the internship!<eos> I'm gonna be studying the origins of the universe.<eos> - Aww! - Oh, that's great!<eos> But I have to say no, right?<eos> I mean, it's a three-year commitment with no pay, and this, I mean, this could be the western region.<eos> Even though it's not my dream, maybe it's where I'm meant to be.<eos> Honey, I think you should take the internship.<eos> Your mother's right. I usually scoff at dream-followin', but, er... you've got a dream worth following'.<eos> We both do.
[Marseille Theme Tune:<eos> Arabic vocal over pulsing rhythm]<eos> BRAINWASHING<eos> I came here for you.<eos> The lists must be delivered tomorrow night.<eos> I'll try to convince Taro to speak to you.<eos> He's the one who leaked the invoices online.<eos> Anyway, the scandal is my problem, not yours.<eos> You're not meant to know the workings of a national election!<eos> Right, and I don't, but Taro does.
And look, I have fake ID.<eos> -What is this shit?<eos> -So I don't end up in prison.<eos> But that other asshole is headed for jail.<eos> -Who are you talking about?<eos> -An old friend.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?<eos> -Tell him what?<eos> -About me.<eos> No, I didn't.
The more you're dishonest with her, the worse it's gonna get.<eos> I thought it would be easier with a girl.<eos> Why would you ever think that?<eos> Hey.<eos> Get up.<eos> Let me sleep.<eos> I heard Alex in the garage.<eos> I think he got the shotgun.<eos> You don't have a shotgun.<eos> Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.
Things are looking swell, I tell ya.<eos> I was doing, like, a '20s thing, there.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Your father's sleeping with Dina.<eos> Writer Dina?<eos> What?<eos> No. How do you know?<eos> He did the sex sniff.<eos> Okay, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want to.<eos> Too late, I do.
That is why I'm here.<eos> - This way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I found our suspect.<eos> Her name is Jordan Karfton, and she lives on Shula Lane.<eos> How did the snake removal go?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
Dial it down.<eos> This is a place of business, and, yeah, I know Damona and I boned a bunch of times, but that was different.<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> So, where are you two going for lunch?<eos> Mm, I don't know. - What do you feel like, hon?<eos> - Oh, I don't care. You pick something.<eos> Well, I want whatever you want, - so we're back to you.<eos> - Well, you pick.<eos> - You. No, you pick. - No, I can't pick.<eos> - You do it.

- He was embarrassed.<eos> - He should have been.<eos> - I hope it's Brandon.<eos> He has a key.<eos> Hey, look, look, look,<eos> I'm still wearing your necklace.<eos> Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?<eos> What about Mat, huh?<eos> You don't love him?<eos> No, I... I don't.
Okay, there's gotta be something we can do.<eos> Something I can do.<eos> I was the one that suggested it in the first place.<eos> Do we have $20,000?<eos> What?<eos> Monte knows this attorney who specializes in helping people get off the list, and that's the discount rate.<eos> Okay, how does this help you?<eos> Well, if he can get Gabe's record expunged, it's like he was never on the list and then we did nothing wrong.<eos> All right, well, I hate to tell you this, honey, but we don't have $20,000.<eos> We do on a line of credit on the house...
That's like taking speed. Are you crazy?<eos> - I can't believe you're still seeing Nick!<eos> - What does it matter if he thinks that I'm his girlfriend as long as he's locked up?<eos> Callie's caused Brandon a lot of trouble from the time she showed up. And what about this Aaron kid?<eos> Is she yanking his chain too?<eos> Hey, anybody home?<eos> Police.<eos> You were amped on adrenaline and I was lying on the ground.<eos> - Of course you thought that he still had the gun.<eos> - But he didn't.
That's to keep the animals away.<eos> We burn around the clock.<eos> We ran into something out there.<eos> Something big.<eos> To be honest, most of us haven't been outside in months.<eos> How do you get food and supplies?<eos> The school was the town's emergency relief center.<eos> Lucky for us, it was stocked before the attacks.<eos> So do you have a sat phone?<eos> We don't.
I've been secretly working against Davies, trying to find an alternative to the Noah Objective.<eos> Well, then, let us go find that alternative, okay?<eos> Because that's what Chloe wanted.<eos> Please. I need you to come with me to my orchard.<eos> You know, we're not gonna go anywhere with you.<eos> You can keep your stupid plane. We'll find another way to get Jamie and find a cure.<eos> What he said.<eos> Did Chloe ever mention "The Courier"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did, right...
Vulture team, Croft and company 100 yards to your west, heading southbound.<eos> Veer left around the corner of the building, then proceed north.<eos> You can cut him off.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Smile for the camera, Croft.<eos> Tiger team's inside.<eos> Rise and shine, asshole.<eos> Jackpot.<eos> Raptor moving in on the master suite.<eos> - Raptor, how we doing?
You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.<eos> We'll change their minds.<eos> You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
I never noticed it before, but you and Elliot are like twins.<eos> Wait, where's Elliot?<eos> Where's my husband?<eos> You know, if they can't find his body and you need a shoulder to cry on...<eos> Back off, bitch!<eos> Elliot!<eos> You're okay!<eos> I was in the bathroom when I heard the announcement, so I panicked and hid in the tub!<eos> I can't believe you came up here to save me.<eos> Of course I did!
But not now.<eos> Enjoy your book.<eos> What's wrong with flour sifters?<eos> Nothing, Mother.<eos> It's just supply and demand.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> Good Lord.<eos> There's so much less.<eos> I sold my bike today.<eos> Well, Jared and I did.
And George?<eos> Did you question him any further about his possible sexual involvement with Hanna?<eos> I mean, given Daniel's assertion that it was the other boys and not Daniel himself who had sex with her that night.<eos> I fully intended to, Ms. Person.<eos> But?<eos> Once Holden had confessed to murder, to rape,<eos> Roland felt like that we should just cut George loose, cut all the kids loose.<eos> But before that?<eos> Before you cut 'em all loose, before Daniel broke, did you question Trey about George's claim of rape by Holden?<eos> Roland did.
You turned these things into sprinklers!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...<eos> Okay, I'm ready for my first lesson.<eos> Oh, first lesson.<eos> Right, um...<eos> Oh, it's babysitting!<eos> Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> Big problem.<eos> Have you...<eos> Did you...
I've been on for 17 hours.<eos> Getting too old for this.<eos> I bet you're glad I saved his life.<eos> How's Tom Anderson?<eos> His arm's broken.<eos> He's undergone a closed reduction to pull the bones back into position.<eos> He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should...keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.<eos> Don't you have a home to go to?<eos> I do.
How can you say you don't take care of people?<eos> You've been taking care of me my entire life.<eos> You're fierce and you are strong, and you would stand up for anyone that you love.<eos> You're like a big, scary mama bear.<eos> I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> You're my mama bear, girl.<eos> I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> - You do.
Your gun?<eos> You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But it's locked.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We were just playing.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
I'm sorry. It's very unlikely.<eos> The gun was locked up.<eos> It was supposed to be locked in a drawer. It was.<eos> - I don't know how they...<eos> - Kids watch.<eos> You cut just deep enough They pick up everything you do.<eos> I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die? No.<eos> He didn't.
I, uh...<eos> And when she found out, she called.<eos> She told me.<eos> And I said...<eos> I said...<eos> "Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.
It's a good thing you did.<eos> And your work schedule will be pretty grueling, I'd imagine.<eos> Actually, it's a research fellowship, so it will be far more predictable than a surgery resident's schedule.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> What was Sofia wearing this morning?<eos> - What?<eos> - What was she wearing today?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know. You didn't see her this morning?<eos> No, I-I did. I just, uh...
I - I-I can see how you might not remember what color tutu she wore to school today, but to not even know what grade she's in...<eos> So many objections.<eos> Badgering, irrelevant...<eos> - Sustained. - I'm sorry. I don't mean to belabor the point, but you said it yourself.<eos> You've only known Sofia a few months, so...<eos> No, that is not what I meant.<eos> But that is what you said.<eos> All right, Counselor.<eos> I know what grade she's in.<eos> I do.
You sure you don't want to run? Now's your last chance.<eos> Please shut up.<eos> We have to go.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Love has boundaries.<eos> We know this.<eos> I tried my best.<eos> Please know that if I could've done more... I know.<eos> I do.
It is the wedding of NSA Chief Jake Ballard and attorney/Washington socialite Vanessa Moss.<eos> The two are set to wed later today in what many insiders are calling the wedding of the decade in the nation's capital.<eos> When you break the news to Jake that he's still going to marry Vanessa, tell him that you've changed your mind.<eos> I know what you're planning, Olivia.<eos> He's throwing his life away for you.<eos> You think this is about me getting power.<eos> See, unlike you, I've had power, achieved greatness.<eos> This is about Jake finally stepping forward and accepting his own greatness.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> He never did.
This nigger.<eos> People I know.<eos> Oh, I, uh... I mean, that sounds really dangerous.<eos> These are legit business folks I'm talkin' about, not just street thugs.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> - Hey, look, bro.<eos> We in Miami. Them dudes sittin' up in them Ivory Towers on Brickell?<eos> Ain't much difference between them and the dudes I know.<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?
She was young when she had her daughter.<eos> Perhaps she felt the need to seduce him on her rise to power, or theirs was a love for the ages.<eos> Neither scenario changes what we have to do now.<eos> I notice you didn't mention anything about Krasnov.<eos> You don't want him to know that we know that he was the one who set off the bomb.<eos> Why tempt him to disappear his favorite assassin?<eos> If we can find Krasnov and connect him to Vikner...<eos> We'll have them both.<eos> The police know about Krasnov. How do we explain Vikner?<eos> We don't.
Hey, it's Jostein.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> I just wanted to say that...<eos> I have seen the tape with Helgesen.<eos> I think indeed he was insane.<eos> Do you know if your brother knew him?<eos> If Dag felt Helgesen?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, he does not.
I think a needed it.<eos> Can you remember what happened yesterday? No.<eos> That you had a seizure and passed out and screamed some strange things?<eos> You screamed that you had killed a child.<eos> A child?<eos> I don't have children.<eos> No, not to my knowledge.<eos> It was perhaps just too much of it all yesterday.<eos> It happens sometimes?<eos> It do, honey.
I'm not telling you anything until I see my son.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks to your escapades in Lisbon, we now have an eyewitness to the 1895 Courier events.<eos> It's not as if jellyfish have eyes.<eos> No, they don't.
I don't want this.<eos> Well, I need you to want this.<eos> I've been with many submissives, and they never know what they really want until they experience it.<eos> Hey, it's not all about you.<eos> It's about me and what I need for this relationship to work.<eos> I need to know that you are willing to do anything for me.<eos> I need to have that level of confidence in you.<eos> You don't already?<eos> How can I when you can't just trust me?<eos> But I do.
Let me say only this... none of the speculation carried in your pages is far from the truth of the matter, and should the courts, as I expect them to do, find Edmund Reid guilty, no matter his years of service,<eos> we will be urging for the most severe of penalties under the law.<eos> Commissioner Bradford, can this, indeed, be true?<eos> You would send one of your own to the rope?<eos> We would, Miss Costello, with ever greater conviction, given the violent, headstrong hypocrisy he has sanctioned and performed in our name.<eos> You are Costello?<eos> Good day, Mr. Abeline.<eos> Come away, miss.<eos> You heard?<eos> I did.
We just were. We went to the range.<eos> Donnie made me shoot his gun.<eos> At first, I was scared, but then I was grateful he forced me to do it.<eos> - Mm. - Cool.<eos> All right, well, I'm late for my night watch shift, so, uh...<eos> Call me after your wife goes to sleep.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ooh, come to Mommy.<eos> Does Donnie still not know you smoke weed?<eos> Of course he doesn't.
And do you know why I carry it with me, Maurice?<eos> Barry, whatever you want, you can have it.<eos> I just need to get to my daughter now.<eos> I carry it with me to remind me that it was hard...<eos> ..because if I didn't remember how hard it was I don't think I could cope with her not being here any more.<eos> It was exhausting, actually.<eos> So I can't ever know how you feel, Maurice. But I know how Deborah feels.<eos> I know how she would have felt.<eos> I keep saying to myself, "It will go away soon, this feeling, "after a few months, few years perhaps."<eos> But it never does.
Are you okay?<eos> Those guys hurt my back.<eos> There's a bag up there.<eos> Can you reach it?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.<eos> I couldn't really blame them, though. Perpetual motion's a myth.<eos> Then Torus seized the ARQ.<eos> Now why take something that didn't work?<eos> Because it does.
-Yeah.<eos> Something I've been meaning to ask.<eos> Is, uh, a psychic like a therapist?<eos> Like, for one thing, is what I tell you confidential?<eos> -Of course.<eos> Aw. I'm married.<eos> - Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble.<eos> By the pricking of my thumb, something wicked this way comes!<eos> -I always thought it was "Hubble, bubble toil and trouble."<eos> A lot of people do.
Your daughter.<eos> How do I know it's really you?<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> Someone the government wants me to think is you.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Because they know I know what they know.<eos> Now go away, or I'll set my dog on you.<eos> - We don't have a dog.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Smart thinking.<eos> Well, it is smart, but it's also very risky because, you see, now we have a list of everybody that you sold drugs to.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Look, man, we know this meth isn't being made on this island.<eos> Okay?<eos> I mean, the level of purity-- there's an industrial process going on here.<eos> And Oahu is too small to run that kind of operation without attracting attention.<eos> See?<eos> He looks a little confused.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
Hey, how'd it go, baby?<eos> It did not go well, Joe.<eos> Don't speak for me, Maxine.<eos> It did not go well, Joe.<eos> Look, I don't want to know, I don't want to know.<eos> They uncovered some... some deep, dark secrets about you, didn't they, Mama? Huh?<eos> You got more than one personality?<eos> Are all them personalities my mama?<eos> Look, they didn't uncover anything 'cause she didn't even try.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm pretty sure it wasn't Mexico.<eos> So where is she?<eos> The last thing I knew, she was with him... the Nazi.<eos> No.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> She wouldn't do that.<eos> There's got to be another explanation.<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> None of it does.
To my kin...<eos> Line?<eos> To my kin become so cruel.<eos> To my kin become so cruel.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> That's not your line.<eos> "Spurned the love of my fair queen."<eos> Spurned the love of my fair queen.<eos> So what do I do?
We have an understudy taking the part of the king. I imagine his nerves are getting the better of him.<eos> It was you.<eos> You're the one who balled with me.<eos> Behold, I am your...argh!<eos> Fear not, stay in your seats.<eos> Gardy gordy gordy.<eos> The show must go on!<eos> Mark!<eos> Well, that went quite badly.<eos> Apparently, first nights always do.
Do you see that? We need him.<eos> Ugh, it's so extravagant.<eos> When she and Rafael were just about to get back together.<eos> Come on, Mateo only turns one once.<eos> Just... find out how to get in touch with Bobby.<eos> It's true.<eos> A lot changes in a year.<eos> We did it.<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> And a lot doesn't.
So, what are you thinking?<eos> You think, uh, we're covering something up?<eos> Maybe it's just due to negligence on the part of your security team, Jacob.<eos> Malachi, please keep reviewing the video, every single thing from the last 48 hours.<eos> [Walt] Vincent Parr had his wallet. None of his winnings were in it.<eos> Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.<eos> Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."<eos> I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.<eos> You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?<eos> I do.
And by our silver anniversary, Walter and I had visited all the national parks.<eos> Ever go to any American League parks?<eos> He was always there for me.<eos> Did you have anyone like that in your life?<eos> They gone again?<eos> Truth was, my parents never left me with Bort.<eos> They just left.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll make you some fish sticks.<eos> I did.
Okay, let's get that thumb up there a little higher, okay, buddy?<eos> Dr. Alaimo.<eos> Dr. Alaimo?<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You told Senator Healy we were crazy, but yesterday you thought an infestation made sense.<eos> Yes, but that was yesterday.<eos> It's not today.<eos> What changed?<eos> She did.
_<eos> We should use your sweet bud to time travel immediately.<eos> Or we could keep the seeds and synthetically replicate it.<eos> There's a huge market for it.<eos> I know some guys who could distribute.<eos> We don't have to be "dealers."<eos> We would just sell enough that we smoke for free.<eos> No, no, no, no, or you guys could do your original plan, which is to time travel.<eos> Well, we don't know if the bong works yet, so we might as well get high first anyway.<eos> No, it does work.
We met earlier today.<eos> You came in for a pitch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, look, I'm sorry to call so late, can I buy you lunch tomorrow?<eos> I thought you guys passed.<eos> This is not Valencia talking.<eos> This is just me.<eos> I would like to buy you lunch.<eos> - Big man.<eos> What it do.
He is in here because of us. (SCOFFS)<eos> Keep telling yourself that, Ezra.<eos> Who's the pig?<eos> Purple guy, Mando girl, and Ezra Bridger.<eos> My, look how you have grown.<eos> Ah, I knew you would not let your old partner, Hondo, rot away in this prison.<eos> Hondo, it's good to see you.<eos> Not really.<eos> You better have the intel you promised.<eos> Yes, we do.
Four coming in, Robert. Got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Valerie Edwards!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey! Oh!<eos> I'm an American diplomat.<eos> We got company.<eos> I swear to God, if this doesn't work out, - I'll fucking kill Hector.<eos> - And if it does?
I never tell lies.<eos> You seem a bit upset. -<eos> - I'd like to see you in this situation.<eos> I'd like to know the truth.<eos> This was taken in Santa Teresa, in Costa Rica.<eos> Do you recognize Nils Wendt here? - - Yes.<eos> What about the woman?<eos> I've never been to Costa Rica.<eos> You may have seen her in picture.<eos> - - I didn't.
I know you're angry about what happened, but this is... it's not for me.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Why did you just leave? I...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not good at this.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Do I strike you as the kind of woman who needs protecting?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you have a past.<eos> So does everybody.
- Don't answer it.<eos> Fine! I'll answer it!<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey!<eos> Gabi, it's Josh, your former boss.<eos> And other stuff.<eos> Hi, Josh.<eos> It's, uh, me, Gabi, which... you know 'cause you called me.<eos> So did you get the invite to Yolanda's birthday?<eos> I did.
He didn't make the connection at first, because, um... you hadn't told him my name.<eos> It never came up.<eos> Right.<eos> What do you mean, "right"?<eos> - Did I enter at a bad time?<eos> Glad you could make it, Dad.<eos> I'm honored that you invited me.<eos> When Mario was born, I promised my wife that he would never be part of our thing.<eos> That we'd raise him to lead a good, honest life.<eos> And we did.
Lead detective for a high-profile murder, and you don't collect statements from everyone present?<eos> Me.<eos> Well, let's do it now.<eos> And for the record, I waive my right to counsel.<eos> Captain...<eos> Ask your questions, Gordon.<eos> Did you see Symon at the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No, I did not.
Oh, not at all, you were perfect.<eos> You took just the right amount of magic.<eos> Now... I need you to say the special word.<eos> Excellent job, girls.<eos> - I think you're ready.<eos> - For what?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Enzo!<eos> You came back to me.<eos> Of course I did.
What do you mean by "lives"?<eos> I want to see Amenadiel.<eos> What?<eos> It's time.<eos> I am not going to live in fear of my own son.<eos> We may have had our differences...<eos> He literally carried you to Hell.<eos> But I created him.<eos> Certainly that has to count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
That was the big emergency?<eos> It was totally worth it. It was a great movie.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> Better catch phrase, wasn't it?<eos> "Not on my watch."<eos> Maybe I should get a catch phrase.<eos> You don't need a catch phrase. And you.<eos> Do you have anything constructive to add?<eos> Uh, yep.<eos> Yep, I do.
Do you think it's crazy that I wanted to talk about it?<eos> Mourn with him, maybe?<eos> - So I reached out, and guess what I got back.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.
I got to rush back.<eos> Where's Lucifer?<eos> Something came up at his club.<eos> I don't think he's coming back.<eos> Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.<eos> He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Huh. Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.
We're past that.<eos> What I don't understand, though, is how the detective can think I'm the one who leaked sensitive information to my mum.<eos> How could she?<eos> Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.<eos> If only I knew who really gave mom that information.<eos> Right.<eos> If only.<eos> Good.<eos> You came.<eos> Yes, he did.
- I can have my boy, Paolo, set you up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So, I'll reach out to your boy, uh, Paolo, for the threads.<eos> I've been thinking about Freda Gatz.<eos> You're sure you want to get her out?<eos> Yeah, they're gonna kill her in there if I don't.<eos> If a judge were to declare her non compos mentis during the shooting...<eos> Wait, so, like temporary insanity?<eos> Do you know if she has any documented history of mental illness?<eos> I don't, um...
Nessa.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> What the hell is going on, Dre?<eos> You think you can just hook up with me and then not tell me that you just got done stomping out my best friend?<eos> - That's what we doing?<eos> - I should've told you.<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> So what do we do now?

Mom, what is wrong?<eos> You-you can't... you can't use those videos.<eos> You had no right digging that stuff up.<eos> Mom, you and-and Dad and the whole... I c...<eos> No, I got to go!<eos> Mom... just wait...<eos> And don't use those videos, Jamal!<eos> I'm gonna be late for Angelo's mama.<eos> Damn!<eos> How you doing?
Okay, wait, wait.<eos> Why don't you go get the Malaysian hair down on aisle nine?<eos> Man, I'm a big... Come on, go ahead.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> They got the pink and the yellow.<eos> Man, I'm a fan, man. Yo, I appreciate you.<eos> Thank you. The purple, too. Okay, okay.<eos> And what you bring me?<eos> Okay, who is this?<eos> How you doing?
I looked her up online.<eos> She's in the same one as Coretta Scott King, Maya Angelou and Rosa Parks. Ha.<eos> So if you get stuck for something say, start quoting one of them.<eos> But I don't know what they be saying.<eos> I take solace in something Maya Angelou once said.<eos> "We cannot repair what we cannot see.<eos> Our souls contain our destiny."<eos> Wait, didn't Beyoncé say something like that?<eos> Maybe, but it sounds like something Maya could have said, so you're gonna have to "Melania Trump"<eos> No, you didn't!
Where you been, anyway?<eos> I'll take it from here, thanks.<eos> Can you give us a minute, Tiffany?<eos> You want to get your nails done?<eos> Nah, I'm more of a rub and tug type.<eos> Listen, so far, we got nothin'.<eos> All right, no disrespect, but your cornball half-brother lives like a monk.<eos> Okay, he doesn't gamble, no drugs, doesn't really drink, I mean, it's damn near insulting.<eos> I thought we had somebody on the inside.<eos> We do.
Mm, friends close enemies closer.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Yes?<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I hope I didn't wake you up. I-I, uh...wanted to bring you this.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I don't know if you drink tea, but...<eos> - I do.
Yeah, that MI6 guy found a suspicious deposit in Kane's bank account.<eos> Kane's dirty?<eos> Well, we found out someone warned the Russians back in '02 that we were gonna grab Jacob's buyer.<eos> Looks like that might have been Kane.<eos> Right.<eos> Half hour it is.<eos> We have to shoot this guy, I get to take the shot.<eos> We're not shooting anyone.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Just... if we do.
Is that what this is?<eos> A joke?<eos> Just... Just go with it, okay?<eos> Don't spoil it.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's just that...<eos> Fate brought us together today.<eos> You believe in fate, don't you?<eos> - I believe in fate. - I do.<eos> I really do.
I don't know!<eos> Ask the guards.<eos> All right, I want you to listen to me.<eos> That nursery's owned by a drug dealer.<eos> And we suspect that those warehouses are tied to his business, but what I can't do with a suspicion is take it to the police and use that as probable cause to look into those shipments.<eos> So I need something specific.<eos> Something you've actually seen.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> You don't know what it's like in here.<eos> Actually, Nate, I do.
I didn't have enough time.<eos> Hey, Larry, I'm sorry to hear about your wallet.<eos> Was this the girl who stole it?<eos> Yep, bitch took my cigarettes, too, just to screw with me.<eos> Did you have any plastic in that wallet?<eos> Well, you know, I'm canceling that card.<eos> Mm, I'm gonna need you to hold off on that.<eos> So what, you expect me to pay her charges?<eos> Tony, do we have any petty cash laying around?<eos> Uh, yeah, we do, actually.
Why me?<eos> I've never shot anyone before.<eos> Yeah, I know, but I figured out a way we can ink you back into the club if you do.<eos> And about the deal?<eos> I have that taken care of, but I need you to step up and do this, Sita.<eos> Morning, Helen.<eos> Hi.<eos> Maybe it's time you and I sit down, talk about this killer you're looking for.<eos> - I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - We did.
- Yes, I know.<eos> ... and I need to manage this.<eos> If Mithat finds out about this guy, he will go after him and the shit...<eos> He's already found out.<eos> How'd he find out?<eos> I had to delay Bella's cremation to get a rape kit.<eos> - There's no basis for...<eos> - Forensics found semen. The sample's already on the way to the lab.<eos> How did you get an autopsy approved for a suicide?<eos> I didn't.
Guy in the shop said it's worth, like, $450.<eos> Cool.<eos> Yeah, I can scoop up the money tomorrow.<eos> He's just got to authenticate it.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> Well, at first, I thought it was some kind of "Star Wars" spaceship.<eos> - It's actually a camera. - Yeah, it's a Polaroid.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You like taking pictures, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And because of you I've lost my girl.<eos> You see it?<eos> It's right there.<eos> Okay, no one is gonna see that.<eos> You want them to find it. Don't you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We'll cover it up.<eos> Help me. Get some big rocks.<eos> - Did your mom have any pills?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Chief and I feel strongly that you're the best candidate to replace me in New York.<eos> Wow.<eos> Um, a little unexpected, but...<eos> But nothing.<eos> It's well-deserved.<eos> The interview process requires a polygraph, and if you have anything you don't want to come out, maybe...<eos> I got nothing to hide.<eos> We blew it, Philip.<eos> Why did you think that I would lie about a gun?<eos> I didn't, not at first.
Sita's dead.<eos> God.<eos> Poughkeepsie Police found Sita's body floating downstream.<eos> God, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Why haven't you told anyone?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I guess I thought if I didn't say anything then maybe it never happened.<eos> You know, maybe she never jumped.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.
Is it self-inflicted?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> There's no gun.<eos> They stay here even during winter, do they not?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> The bees.<eos> This is their home... rain or shine.<eos> Yes, let's talk about bees, instead of the execution you just carried out in Yonkers.<eos> I didn't lay a finger on Professor Vikner.<eos> Who did?
I'm sort of famous.<eos> I just don't have that much time to go to the movies or watch TV.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Trey Edwards?<eos> Oh, my God, I am so sorry to bother you. I just had to see if it was really you.<eos> Okay... "NCIS" is my all-time favorite show.<eos> - Since the very beginning. Especially since you're on it.<eos> They should have you on it more, though, don't you think? I do.<eos> Can we take a picture?<eos> No, I don't really...
I want to lie.<eos> And you won't let me.<eos> I don't...<eos> - K.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> The woman I live with keeps elastic bands on a door knob in case they come in handy.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Karen or Beatrice?<eos> You once told me that you liked sitting in a parked car in the rain.<eos> Well, who does, which you?
No, I can't.<eos> I don't lie ever.<eos> Are the things you choose not to keep secret things that could get you killed?<eos> No.<eos> Well, that must make being open a lot easier.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I didn't know if I could trust you.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Because... you liked me and I didn't want you to stop.<eos> Well, I didn't.
- Oh, no, no.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks so much for having me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Heard so much about you from Ron.<eos> Really? Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I brought you guys some wine.<eos> I know he doesn't drink. I didn't know...<eos> - No, he doesn't, but I do.
There is no dinner.<eos> Right.<eos> First-class slaving.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I've got my dad's charge card for the Emporium if you wanna run and grab some stuff.<eos> Wicked.<eos> I mean, I'd rather not run but...<eos> So take the sedan, if you like.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do like.
That's what she said.<eos> No, that's not gonna do it.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> You just said the same thing.<eos> Now that's what she said.<eos> That's... What accent is that?<eos> - It's Italian.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - That's what she said!<eos> - Nope, that didn't
No, that's not gonna do it.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> You just said the same thing.<eos> Now that's what she said.<eos> That's... What accent is that?<eos> - It's Italian.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - That's what she said!<eos> - Nope, that didn't<eos> - do it, either.
Shit.<eos> Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.<eos> Did you check your jacket?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I just think we need a chance as humans to... fail in order to discover what actually works, you know?<eos> People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?
He was absolutely terrible.<eos> The kid's tanking. Come on, let's go.<eos> Maybe I should get up there and ease the suffering.<eos> Uh, he's gotta learn for himself.<eos> Was referring' to the audience.<eos> Say, what time is it?<eos> In fact, I'm late. Can I borrow your watch?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, hi. Can you just sign this for us?<eos> How y'all ladies doing?
Hmm. How'd it feel?<eos> Empowering?<eos> I just have something I need to tell you before you go.<eos> How do you know I'm going?<eos> Because I'm Abby Sciuto, and I know things.<eos> Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much...<eos> Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
Jess' room is meant for sex.<eos> I know.<eos> So, Just-just hit lobby and let technology do its thing. Yeah, cool.<eos> When-when I get in there, I'll just hit lobby.<eos> Cool.<eos> Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess. You know.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
And then he says the word "relationship," and I freaked out, because...<eos> You know what, I don't know.<eos> Am I crazy to want a relationship with Nick?<eos> I mean, you guys were together. What happened?<eos> We were kind of a mess.<eos> I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.<eos> And... he wanted me to not care about those things.<eos> That's not so bad.<eos> I mean, who really has a plan for their life?<eos> Who does that?
I had nowhere else to go.<eos> Well, she shouldn't have.<eos> Remembering you can do nothing but confuse him.<eos> It doesn't have to.<eos> I will not let you degrade him.<eos> He has made his way through enormous difficulties.<eos> He has never been happier, and that is too precious to risk.<eos> What about me?<eos> I don't care about you!<eos> No one does!
No matter what I do.<eos> Mrs. Bligh, too.<eos> Sometimes the bad ones leave us no choice.<eos> Ooh-ooh!<eos> - Quick. Hide.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Mrs. Collins!<eos> The joys of breakfast al fresco.<eos> That's Italian, you know.<eos> Oh. Well, of course you do.
Main thing is we get some rain before too long.<eos> As I said, don't hesitate.<eos> You got a tick there, Doris? Oh.<eos> Certainly, Mr. Briggs.<eos> Just wanted to let you know about some changes over to my place.<eos> Mainly so that if anyone gets in your ear, you can tell them to mind their business.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Although I might need some more information to form an entire picture.<eos> Well, you know how young Harry's moving out to the Polettis' for a while.<eos> Yes, I do.
Perhaps give her time.<eos> She's with Olivia today.<eos> Jack's seeing Gino.<eos> Well, let me know if there's anything I can do.<eos> I will.<eos> I bear a portion of the blame.<eos> For Anna. Rose is simply the tip of the iceberg.<eos> She's what brought it to a head.<eos> Do you see no hope?<eos> Anna doesn't, more to the point.
I think we both knew what was about to happen.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - So, I've been living alone, sleeping in his bed.<eos> I'm not ready to be an adult.<eos> Contemplate the sundry ways a society handles its elderly and infirm.<eos> For instance, the noble Eskimo sets himself adrift on an iceberg.<eos> Mm, he's so smart.<eos> You love this smart, smart man.<eos> You love his jiggly body and square face.<eos> You really do.
Just around the corner over there.<eos> Give me a bite.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Sang-min?<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I can't hear you clearly.<eos> Do you hear me well?<eos> I do. Don't you?
The thing is, Tim, I'm worried about what she might do to herself...<eos> I mean, think of Geraldine.<eos> Geraldine?<eos> She'll not do anything to Geraldine.<eos> Well, if you do come to a meeting of minds, my method is very safe.<eos> W-What is this... method...?<eos> Well, the laws of medical confidentiality prohibit me from going into details, Tim.<eos> Suffice to say, that not every Tom, Dick and Harry can be made privy to the procedure, for obvious reasons.<eos> You do trust me, don't you, Tim?<eos> Yeah, of course, of course I do, Mr Christie, yeah...
Hey, we're approaching the rendezvous location Devon's black market contacts gave us.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> He is flying the "Marauder" over to the ship with the drug dealers on it to make the trade.<eos> And you're going with him as backup.<eos> I can fly the "Marauder".<eos> Four can be my backup.<eos> He's a better pilot.<eos> Gear up.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I think she's just doing this so I'll be complicit in the deal.<eos> It doesn't.
Hey there, stranger.<eos> Miss me?<eos> I was starting to think we'd never get any alone time.<eos> No need for the silent treatment.<eos> Everything worked out perfect.<eos> They all showed up, just like you wanted.<eos> I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.<eos> They're not labeled.<eos> How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?<eos> We don't.
He showed you that letter to tear us apart! Yeah.<eos> You're still the one who wrote it.<eos> - Acosta here.<eos> - I need to report some very suspicious activity, Sheriff.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - I'd like to remain anonymous.<eos> I'd hate for this to get back to me.<eos> But something very strange has been going on here at the old horse stables on Route 6.<eos> - You know the place?<eos> - I do.
Well, there are things that I want to clarify.<eos> The prospectus should be a living document.<eos> - Well, it's not.<eos> - Sorry, SEC rules.<eos> Look, you're doing great.<eos> The whole point of coming to these smaller firms first is so that you can work out the kinks before we take it to the big guns in Boston and New York.<eos> I thought it went pretty well last night, don't you think?<eos> No, I think they were all underwhelmed.<eos> Hey, I read the room as I see it.<eos> You did fine.
Look.<eos> Bugs don't do that.<eos> Do they?<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> - Do you think these bugs might be from<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know, but don't say it.<eos> - Outer... I'm just<eos> - Don't.
What do you reckon, try the next one over?<eos> Luc said he fed his clothes to the dragon, right?<eos> I think we should go to the dragon.<eos> (panting) KALEY: Mmm, that's it, baby.<eos> You like that, don't you?<eos> You're such a naughty boy.<eos> Ooh, you're such a bad boy.<eos> (pants) Does that feel good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, it does.
Look at him, just furious.<eos> Josh, stop it.<eos> No, he's always been a little bit jealous of his older brother.<eos> I'm not jealous.<eos> What's so incredible about Singapore?<eos> He'll be making a lot of money.<eos> Just raking it in, drinking cognac and playing golf, and being on various boats.<eos> What?<eos> I just want to hear you say that you're happy for your brother.<eos> - I did.
It's just that I think it might not work if you don't put the right poles in the right holes.<eos> I used to be a Scout, remember?<eos> You know, I did Scouts for a bit.<eos> - You weren't patrol leader, though.<eos> - No. You were just a regular Scout, just a junk Scout, like a peasant.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Ella?<eos> Yes, Thomas?<eos> Did you get that washing out of the machine?<eos> - No, I did not.
Okay, CJ is not that bad.<eos> Seriously, I mean, yeah, he's like... he's like a lawyer or something.<eos> I think.<eos> I'm more valuable than that shit.<eos> You know what?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Look what I got you.<eos> I got this just for you.<eos> I know you want it.<eos> Yes, you do. - No.
Ross! Kind of you to come and meet me!<eos> Did you have a pleasant time at Trenwith?<eos> I told you, I went to Truro to meet Richard Tonkin.<eos> Whatever you say, Ross.<eos> Do what you will. Go and live with her if you wish.<eos> It's quite possible that her marriage will still go ahead.<eos> No doubt you did your best to prevent it.<eos> No doubt I did.<eos> So does she love George, then?<eos> No, she does not.
- Okay, I'll walk you to it.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> My apartment is just around the block anyway, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... good night.<eos> You want to come by for a night cap?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know what I do to relax?<eos> - I write.<eos> - You write?<eos> - What do you write?<eos> - Letters.<eos> For my family, but I never send them.<eos> It's good to forget.<eos> What do you want to forget?<eos> Why don't you stop?<eos> Why don't you?
Let's do it.<eos> Thank you, everybody!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And welcome to the first ever Grand Tour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
No!<eos> - Listen!<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> - That's not what this... shut up!<eos> Let me know when there's no one making threats to me or my entire family.<eos> We can talk about business.<eos> Let me know when you grow a sack of nuts.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Listen, I believed in GenCoin, Izzy.<eos> - I still do, but not like this.
- Hi. - You made it.<eos> - Did you get my text?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I did, yeah. You wanna go in the back?<eos> - I'll show you kind of around.<eos> - Okay. - My dad's here.<eos> - Nick.<eos> Hey, did you meet Benedict yet?<eos> - No. - Hey, Benny Blush.<eos> How you doing?
You dodged a bullet.<eos> You missed it by that much.<eos> I'll still show you my dick if you wanna see it.<eos> Leo tells me that you work at a bank.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Valencia.<eos> - What do you do there?<eos> - Small business loans.<eos> What, he didn't... he didn't tell you all about it?<eos> - He did. - Yeah.
What is wrong with you?<eos> - Your whore daughter.<eos> - Hey...<eos> I'll knock your teeth in, you glittery cunt.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You need to get out of here now!<eos> I tr...<eos> I tried to do the right thing.<eos> You always do.
All in.<eos> What you worth?<eos> Man, nothing.<eos> I'm in debt.<eos> I've been paying off a student loan for 10 years.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.
What you worth?<eos> Man, nothing.<eos> I'm in debt.<eos> I've been paying off a student loan for 10 years.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> His girl does.
Shutting down won't make a difference.<eos> You have to leave now.<eos> What about all the other people on this station?<eos> There's nothing I can do for them.<eos> That upgrade didn't just change the way you talk.<eos> It changed the way you think and feel.<eos> You tried to help me before you knew I could be trusted.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
I will see you tonight.<eos> Why don't you wear your fancy pajamas?<eos> Ooh, the one with the feet!<eos> Emily, what a surprise.<eos> I should warn you, if this is a booty call, we are not alone.<eos> Ugh. I'm calling because I have some great news.<eos> Well, at least I think it's great, and I hope that you do too.<eos> I'm sure I will... what is it?<eos> Well, Fergus just called.<eos> Of course he did!
I warned you about Swagger. Swagger?<eos> This isn't about Swagger.<eos> He thinks he's a hero.<eos> They're impossible to control.<eos> He'll get a Silver Star for what he did today.<eos> And you?<eos> You'll be allowed to serve out this tour.<eos> You'll never get another chance to command troops in the field<eos> Like you have that kind of juice.<eos> I don't.
Robert Oz said so himself.<eos> I'll believe that when I hear it come out of his own mouth.<eos> Tell me where he is.<eos> No.<eos> And if you ask me that question one more time, when your friend Jackson comes back, I'm gonna tell him your little secret.<eos> What secret?<eos> That meeting Jackson in Uwei as a young man wasn't a coincidence.<eos> That you knew Robert Oz long before you met his son.<eos> Robert told you that?<eos> Actually, you just did.
I'll talk to Dr. Nielsen.<eos> I'll see if there are any other drug candidates that may help mitigate the symptoms.<eos> How are they doing in there?<eos> They're working as fast as they can.<eos> How are you?<eos> I feel like, uh... there's a dam inside me about to crack wide open... and there's nothing I can do to stop it.<eos> Mitch, your father, and the Shepherds... they're working on a solution.<eos> I don't know, Abe. Even if they do figure it out, there's no guarantee that the serum will work.<eos> It will work.<eos> Yeah, well, what if it doesn't?
You need to get back out there.<eos> You need to see if you made the right choice, see if you need to... fight to get your girl back.<eos> Did you do something to your face?<eos> I mean, I hav... Maybe I have the Matthew Fox, "Party of Five" - thing going on.<eos> - Oh! - Oh. - Yeah, it's the whiskers.<eos> It's not super-noticeable.<eos> I'm kind of a hairless wonder.<eos> - Ohh, ohh, do not say...<eos> - Hairless wonder.<eos> - Ohh, you did it again. - Again.
You keep counting calories, and you're gonna really turn me on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hmm. You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?<eos> Is... but is it even legal?<eos> No. Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.
- Give or take a year.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> Often, it's purely hereditary, but bone loss can be exacerbated by lack of exercise, excessive alcohol consumption, coffee, cola, alcohol.<eos> You said that already.<eos> Did you find everything you needed today?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Not in a global sense, but yeah.<eos> Do you have a club card?<eos> Oh, man, I do, but not with me.
Where you from?<eos> Queens, New York.<eos> Get out! Bayside, born and bred.<eos> Right here.<eos> You a Mets fan?<eos> Was.<eos> I don't follow baseball much anymore.<eos> Yeah, but still, you got to love watching the Yanks get slapped around, right?<eos> The Yankees?<eos> Who doesn't?
- Dad, here. - Whoa!<eos> All right, give 'em up, cell phones.<eos> What, are you serious?<eos> Yeah, it's my trip.<eos> You can cry if you want to. Okay, no.<eos> Just take it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, what are you doing... Hold on.<eos> But I need my laptop.<eos> No, you don't.
So only if there's an emergency.<eos> So no new news is good then?<eos> Exactly.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Dishes.<eos> You know, I thought it was a good idea when Charlie pitched it.<eos> But now that they're gone.<eos> Aw, honey, don't worry about it.<eos> Charlie knows what he's doing. He does?<eos> Sure, he does.
The Carmichael Show is taped in front of a live studio audience.<eos> What the reverend said today was absolutely disgusting!<eos> It was vile!<eos> If he'd said that 1,000 years ago, the church would've hung him for heresy!<eos> Okay, Mom, well, I think you are tremendously overstating what happened here today and being quite irrational.<eos> No, I am not.<eos> Okay, well, I think you are.<eos> No, you do not.
Marilyn Monroe?<eos> So she thinks I'm fat? No.<eos> She thinks you're blond.<eos> Ava knows I wear wigs.<eos> "Marilyn" is only a compliment if you're already curvy.<eos> If you're skinny, it means you need to lose weight.<eos> Every woman knows this.<eos> Well, she's from Argentina.<eos> She doesn't have the same references.<eos> Yes, she does.
She is a gluten-phobe.<eos> She doesn't want it.<eos> I think it's sourdough.<eos> [indistinct] They're all yours.<eos> Here, and you know what?<eos> Take the peonies.<eos> She doesn't want 'em, 'cause they're not sorbet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like a sign?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Oh, my God!<eos> Mmm! That was amazing!<eos> Yeah, just make sure that your PayPal account is up to date.<eos> Okay. Bye-bye.<eos> What's with the red wine?<eos> I cut down to two glasses a day.<eos> Well, there's an AA rule I haven't heard.<eos> How does phone sex still even exist?<eos> Well, not everyone has a computer.<eos> Yeah, they do.
What are you doing?<eos> Cricket was the only person I ever allowed myself to get close to until you, and ...<eos> I lost her.<eos> I'm not gonna lose you, too.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> I'm cool with us being friends.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that, when you first came here, I thought you were the hottest guy I'd ever seen.<eos> And... I still do.
- What are you doing?<eos> This isn't you.<eos> Amy, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Put the knife down.<eos> Don't.<eos> Put the knife down, Amy.<eos> Listen to him.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
After I stopped screaming from the pain, we fucked like rabbits.<eos> And from that night on, I knew I would give up everything for that woman.<eos> My God, we had fun.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I sound like I'm still stuck on her.<eos> She burrows under my skin like a fucking tick.<eos> Evil.<eos> My God, and the years I wasted, broken up over her.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Sure, you do.
That's a decision I had no part in.<eos> Gave up the right to that decision when you punched my ex in the face.<eos> We were having fun, right?<eos> We were... we were good.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> You do too.
Feel good paying off the mortgage?<eos> I didn't think you guys were gonna tear the place apart so soon.<eos> We're hosting happy hour.<eos> Workers start the remodel tomorrow.<eos> - Happy hour?<eos> South Side Young Professionals.<eos> Get your hands off my washer!<eos> Thief!<eos> Guessing you didn't tell her yet.<eos> No, I did. A couple of times.
Don't you have a bed of your own at home?<eos> Not my home.<eos> I can't day nap there 'cause it's cleaning day, and people are vacuuming and polishing.<eos> It would feel rude.<eos> You're making very little sense.<eos> You know that thing they say about how you're supposed to sleep when the baby sleeps?<eos> That's a lie!<eos> Babies don't sleep.<eos> - I'd like to sleep.<eos> - At least my baby doesn't.
A lawyer can help. Just tell them everything you told us.<eos> Pryce said no lawyers or the charges stick.<eos> There's gotta be something.<eos> Unless we can get a cop onside, there's not really much we can do.<eos> Alright, listen.<eos> There's only one way to do this thing.<eos> If we take down Pryce, then we, the cops, could lose a chance to take down Tyrell, - and Tyrell is scum.<eos> - Oh, it's OK.<eos> Maz, this is Jay.<eos> Oh, hey, how you doing?
No, you dense flower.<eos> Answer by saying nothing.<eos> Type nothing.<eos> No, I see now how that sounds confusing.<eos> Just give me the phone.<eos> _<eos> Is that "Infinite Jest?"<eos> There's no way he's read that whole book.<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> - No, he didn't.
I slept with him.<eos> - Oh, gross.<eos> - God, really?<eos> - Real cute.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Cute.<eos> One of my girls called me a loser yesterday.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I'm sure she didn't mean it.<eos> Oh, no. She definitely did.
Maybe I have two jobs!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> - But maybe...<eos> - No!<eos> Where?<eos> My sister's house, okay?<eos> I'll give you a ride.<eos> What's the alternative.<eos> Unless you have some kind of magic car-fixing robot.<eos> You don't, though.
Go on.<eos> Hurt it.<eos> Yeah!<eos> - Amanda!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're not going to have to worry about that shit anymore.<eos> You brought the cat.<eos> Well, of course I did.
I'm sure you heard.<eos> DUI, alcoholic, blah, blah, blah.<eos> I heard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really have been doing a lot better.<eos> But then I heard about you and Chan.<eos> And... you had a drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't.
Ugh!<eos> Her weight!<eos> Try her weight!<eos> 115!<eos> Try it!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. She doesn't weigh herself, remember?<eos> Of course she does.
You broke into my apartment and tried to stab me.<eos> Then get the police. Call them.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Does Dad have Parkinson's?<eos> Did Dad say something?<eos> No.<eos> I was looking through his medicine cabinet.<eos> Levodopa?<eos> Yes. He does.
Okay, let's go here.<eos> And the next year, she was bumped up to two Michelin stars, and that made her the first female chef in America to earn that honor.<eos> The day we found out we got the two stars, I think they called her at her house.<eos> And then I'm the first person she calls.<eos> She just said, like, "We got it."<eos> You know, "Thank you so much.<eos> This is yours as much as mine and it's the whole team."<eos> So I cried that day, for sure.<eos> Let's go here.<eos> All right, how we doing on the dessert?
Rosario was the only one who loved you for what you are.<eos> Now you're left alone with your conscience.<eos> You and your little girl have to leave.<eos> You're not safe until I find whoever killed Rosario.<eos> Leave and keep your mouth shut, it's best for everyone.<eos> Maria Rita, let's go.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I was choosing a photo for Rosario.<eos> Do you miss her?<eos> So much, just as you do.
- You're not saying it?<eos> Vilde!<eos> Take care of Eva.<eos> She should have water.<eos> - Vilde..<eos> - Hi.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we get you some water?<eos> - Isak doesn't want to make out with me.<eos> - No, he doesn't?
- I'm too weak. - I can't.<eos> Syd.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> If that kid doesn't get the surgery, we don't get the Cipro.<eos> So, uh, if Hobart buys the hospital, are you going to move to Dallas?<eos> Prez is backing up the money truck.<eos> It's going to be tough to say no.<eos> Would Annie go with you? Uh...<eos> Does she know?<eos> Yeah, she does.
No, they are not.<eos> That is why I've come up with a plan.<eos> Now, most planes have life rafts.<eos> They're equipped with an emergency location transmitter.<eos> If we can locate this ELT, that's our best chance for getting saved.<eos> I know this because I spent 10 years in the British Special Forces.<eos> Wow!<eos> He already said that.<eos> What was that like?<eos> What sort of things did...
- Oh, no, no, no.<eos> One more?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> What?<eos> I just...<eos> I want to take my time.<eos> Get a good look at you.<eos> You like to be in charge, do you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well... so do I.
Yes, I did. Of course I did.<eos> I behaved like a total asshole.<eos> I just... it's Noah Solloway.<eos> He just makes me so agitated.<eos> I mean, I didn't know he was gonna be here.<eos> I mean, why did you invite him?<eos> We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so...<eos> I'm taking his class.<eos> Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't.
She's Joanie's mother.<eos> It's just so awkward.<eos> Joanie wants her there.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> You have gone above and beyond on this party, and Joanie is gonna have the best time.<eos> So just try to enjoy it, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mom did not say that.<eos> Yes, she did, man.
We need to find out who this pervert is.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Danny, you're not packing "The Jackhammer,"<eos> This guy could be a full-on sexual deviant.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> We don't know anything about who we're trapped here with.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> - We don't.
I'm just... it's not...<eos> Fine, be on the census, be on it.<eos> I don't care, okay?<eos> But it's about getting us off the island.<eos> There's got to be another one.<eos> Are you sure you checked it?<eos> No luck on my end.<eos> Please tell me you guys found a movie?<eos> - We did. - Ahh.<eos> You did?
You see, the thing about monogamy is nature doesn't wire us that way.<eos> Exactly!<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Guy like this, a lot of options.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Meat, stay back.<eos> All right, listen, we're gonna keep you out of sight, all right?<eos> 'Cause if they knew you were down here... they'd eat you.<eos> And you don't want to be eaten, do you?<eos> No, you don't.
One thing's important for Savastano:<eos> himself.<eos> He wants to rule alone.<eos> You look worn out.<eos> So do you.<eos> Why did he leave?<eos> Was he afraid?<eos> He said he's tired of killing.<eos> If I may ask... did you talk to Genny?<eos> - I did.
Wait.<eos> It's daytime.<eos> Wrong count.<eos> Monte Cristo?<eos> Sorry. Not on the menu.<eos> Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny.<eos> It's a place. And its Count has quite the reputation.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
You should be thanking me.<eos> Edmond.<eos> Edmond, come on.<eos> This is all just a big misunderstanding.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Edmond, we can explain everything.<eos> The Queen's our friend. She's changed.<eos> She doesn't want you to do this.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> She does.
I can't believe I'm doing this.<eos> Oh, you're doing splendid.<eos> Why are you helping me like this?<eos> Well, you know, it's my general rule to stay on the good side of a murderer.<eos> Plus, it's either teach you how to read or try to masturbate to this book on spelling, and it's a lot harder than you think.<eos> - You ready to go again?<eos> - Yeah. - I'm not gonna spell it out.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hamish.<eos> No, man, we-- we just did it.
I hit someone with a car.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You killed him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. People like you don't do time for that.<eos> That's weird, 'cause here you are.<eos> You must be one very unlucky motherfucker...<eos> Or you're not telling me the whole truth.<eos> But I will find out.<eos> I always do.
You think the police are gonna believe a Northern Irish stonemason with a criminal record over some posh, English housewife?<eos> It's not 30 years ago, Patrick.<eos> Come on, give us some credit.<eos> I've got a ma back home.<eos> She can't get out of bed, she's so wrecked from losing her little girl.<eos> She's counting on me to get justice for our family.<eos> That's not going to happen if I get locked up for something I didn't do.<eos> That's why I need you to believe me.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
I'm all over my Scotland Yard sources, I haven't heard anything.<eos> I might have a source, too.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Luc, what's going on?<eos> Did you do a line while I was in the shower?<eos> I was up all night.<eos> I needed something, or I'll never finish these paintings in time.<eos> You need to keep a clear head.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> We both do.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Good morning, I was hoping I could have a word with you.<eos> I don't remember seeing your name on my calendar.<eos> I just want to say I know the pressure you're under with such a high profile case.<eos> I'm sure you just want to get this right.<eos> That's why it'd be a shame if... with everyone's eyes on you, you got this all wrong because of your bias against my sister.<eos> Bias.<eos> What could I possibly have against your sister?<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> No, you don't.
Goodnight, Grace.<eos> Dammit, Trevor.<eos> Traveler 4022 failed to defuse the bomb that led to the death of his team.<eos> I'm sure it was a very difficult situation to face alone.<eos> But he wasn't alone.<eos> No.<eos> You offered 4022 your assistance.<eos> Many times, but he was afraid.<eos> And do you think this excuses his actions?<eos> No, I don't.
Who are you, really?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who are they?<eos> What do they want from me?<eos> I've already told you, I'm with Child Protective Services.<eos> Do you have a warrant to be here?<eos> A court order of some kind?<eos> No. This is, an informal meeting, but if you want me to leave...<eos> Yes. I do.
Perfectly stable.<eos> How close did we come?<eos> I already told you, there's no way of knowing.<eos> It was pretty close, though.<eos> Doctor, I can't emphasize enough how important...<eos> FBI, my ass.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Blondie over there can't be much over 20.<eos> And the technology beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist.<eos> Well, obviously, it does.
Well, it has been an awfully long time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You still look like shit.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Who's that you're with?<eos> A friend.<eos> Kinda looks like a cop car.<eos> Yeah, it does a little, doesn't it?
You're very near death.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> We're trying to save you.<eos> Tens of thousands of nanites working in concert to repair damage to your prefrontal cortex and throughout the rest of your body.<eos> Your consciousness was given access to these memories as a refuge.<eos> Show me more.<eos> There are no more.<eos> Those were the last remnants of him.<eos> I loved you so much.<eos> He did.
Oh, right.<eos> Well, I can't tell you how much I regret that, Marcy.<eos> Uh, people make mistakes. I understand.<eos> But you don't understand how I intend to fix it.<eos> No. I don't.<eos> By repackaging your original upload in order to bypass the damaged areas in your host brain.<eos> It really is brilliant.<eos> How does this process not lose information?<eos> Oh, it does.<eos> Of course it does.
At the patient's request.<eos> As residents, you have a professional obligation to get the approval of your department. She didn't want Dr McNaughton to know.<eos> Professor Metcalf was speaking.<eos> Eva couldn't have seen one of the other obstetricians in the city because any one of them would have known that she was...<eos> That's true.<eos> They would've. It's a very tight-knit community.<eos> Enough.<eos> Can I just say for the record that at all times Dr Millar acted in the best interest of the patient.<eos> No, you cannot. What if something had gone wrong?<eos> It didn't.
I was hoping the Director would send you a replacement team, but...<eos> Maybe there's still a way.<eos> No, no. Forget it, the mission's canceled.<eos> The Director will have an alternative.<eos> We have to trust that.<eos> I'm sorry about your team.<eos> I haven't given up just yet.<eos> There's no way they can do the mission with so few personnel.<eos> All those people are gonna die.<eos> They already did.
I'm Steve."<eos> Oh, he's cockney?<eos> I'm trying to do New Zealand. Ah, yeah, well, back at our camp, we all make decisions together.<eos> - No one woman rules everyone.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - And you're okay with that? Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Because you're the person who paid to have "Head Flight Attendant" embroidered on your uniform.<eos> I did not pay to have it embroidered.<eos> I did that myself.
Why are we being quiet?<eos> It went away.<eos> Katie, what were you watching?<eos> Right out in the middle, there's this piece of luggage... I don't know, it's one of these fancy labels, right?<eos> Something...<eos> Whatever, it's nice.<eos> And she goes, "It's stuck," right?<eos> And I just said, "Hey. How'd it get there?"<eos> - You did not say that.<eos> - I did, I did...
Make you want to live in that world.<eos> That's what "Candle Cove" is all about.<eos> You made this.<eos> Had you, didn't I? It's fan-fic.<eos> It's a love letter.<eos> You don't have the real show?<eos> Nobody does.<eos> It was unrecordable.<eos> Just get this clear. This isn't something you heard about? You actually saw it in 1988?<eos> We all did.
"Evil is inevitable..."<eos> "...but it is also remediable."<eos> Also remediable.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Wh... I'm sure you're a little freaked out in here.<eos> That's understandable.<eos> I mean, it's jail, for God's sakes.<eos> It's a shock to the system.<eos> No one ever expects to wind up here.<eos> Well, actually, I kind of did.
He's nine years old. He's got an octopus on his shirt.<eos> She's got a tattoo on her neck.<eos> It's a cherry blossom.<eos> Oh, yeah, I remember her.<eos> Foxy.<eos> Did she say where they were going?<eos> No. They were in and out pretty quick.<eos> What did she buy?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hoover dam quality out of his rig.<eos> I ain't nothing if not explicit.<eos> Jeez.<eos> And I explicitly mentioned death in connection to you bastards.<eos> Now, didn't I?<eos> What are you doing to junk's stuff?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're just trying to keep us all alive.<eos> Are you the sumbitch killed skinny?<eos> No, I didn't kill skinny. I liked skinny.<eos> Not as much as I did.
Let's go. Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> - Josh?<eos> - What is he doing?<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> Okay?<eos> They're leading us right to the Moondog.<eos> It's the only way forward.<eos> - Yeah, you trust that?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Yes.<eos> If you extrapolate the death rate around here, then we all die.<eos> I was in firefights in Afghanistan.<eos> You know who dies?<eos> People who think they're gonna die.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Anyone who thought they were coming back... came back.<eos> You think you're gonna die anytime soon?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I don't. Yeah.
That's because they stopped this morning, and that's a very bad thing, Josh.<eos> This lovely institution lies in the shadow of Mount Rainier, and you know what that means?<eos> That means that all those little micro-vents, when the quakes happen, they... they close.<eos> And when every single vent gets shut tight, pressure starts to build, and therefore what happens?<eos> What happens when that happens?<eos> When?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometime less than the next 12 hours and more than the next 30 seconds, say.<eos> I presume you want to leave now.<eos> No, I don't.
Kids, Lamar Boone, aka Booner.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> What?<eos> You were supposed to wait on me.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> No. I thought you were gonna wait for me.<eos> She said she was gonna wait for me.<eos> Did you call her "Booty?"<eos> Yes, I called your mother "Booty."<eos> Everybody in the AF did.
Pastor Dee Dee of the online Church of the Collective Creator.<eos> - Nice bangs.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And look who's back from Hawaii.<eos> Oh, what was it like playing with the Honolulu Phil?<eos> - Dreamy.<eos> Hey, kid. - Hi.<eos> Oh, great cameo.<eos> Loved you flailing around on stage. - You saw that?<eos> - The whole world did, sweetie.
I'm the one who found them. They were lying in a circle. Their heads together.<eos> Such an odd way to die.<eos> Not like eating an ice cream sundae, somebody sneaking up behind you, pulling a bag over your head.<eos> That's a whole different kind of death.<eos> Your friends in the house, that was something sacred.<eos> Cops I work with think they were deluded, but I know they're wrong.<eos> Problem is I can't explain why they're wrong.<eos> Who cares?<eos> The police don't matter.<eos> Who does?
"Here." Why are we here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe she got a coupon for a crack house. Ha!<eos> IâT... "It"...<eos> SâU... "sucks."<eos> It sucks.<eos> So negative, Ray.<eos> You haven't even seen the place.<eos> No, JJ said it.<eos> Of course you didn't, did you, sweetheart?
So, so cool.<eos> Everybody wants to drive around with a fat guy.<eos> Wrong hill, pal!<eos> Okay, let's go get JJ a voice.<eos> Gonna miss you, bro.<eos> You're leaving a lot of ass on the table.<eos> I'm gonna miss having someone else around who cares about astronomy.<eos> But, dude, you're my wingman.<eos> If you're not talking me up, I'm not sure I'd get that Sophia at that party last week.<eos> IâI did.
I don't have my jacket anymore.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> That dude's wearing it.<eos> Okay, it doesn't even fit him!<eos> And I can't get it back because he doesn't know English.<eos> So whatever it is that has you all chill and totally okay with dying here, I want in.<eos> I want to do your drugs.<eos> Buddy, drugs are for expansion, not escapesion.<eos> You do not want drugs.<eos> Yes... I... do.
I can't believe you sold the t-shirts.<eos> Does it help if they basically sold themselves?<eos> I think you know it does not.<eos> What did you do with the money?<eos> Gah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.<eos> Thanks, babe.<eos> Next question.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in the Good Place?<eos> No, I don't.
- It was.<eos> I mean, what were we thinking?<eos> We weren't, that's the problem.<eos> I'm a terrible person.<eos> No, you're not, this is my fault, not yours.<eos> No, I kissed you first.<eos> Yeah, I didn't exactly stop you.<eos> How could I even do this to Barry?<eos> I mean, he's so good to me and he loves me so much.<eos> He really does.
Seriously.<eos> Me, Adele, Rihanna.<eos> We bought an RV. We're living together.<eos> We're gonna go on tour.<eos> Mike, will Ginny be ready to pitch in three days?<eos> People want to know. Over here, Mike. Right here.<eos> Okay, so last week wasn't exactly the start we expected from Ginny Baker.<eos> I'm still driving the bandwagon here, but... after that rough debut, let's hope it's a little better...<eos> Evelyn, I want to be alone.<eos> No, you don't.
And I want to be safe.<eos> I think there's a way we can do that.<eos> Manifest Destinations doesn't have a website or a single Yelp review.<eos> So, uh... how'd the deposition go?<eos> Not great.<eos> Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?<eos> Now we do.
That can wait. I'll call him later.<eos> Walter.<eos> Asha, where are you going?<eos> - Home. - No, you can't.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - She's my cousin. - I called her to come get me.<eos> - Asha, I'm so sorry. I cannot let you do this.<eos> I heard J.P. on your answering machine.<eos> Your restraining order worked. He... He said he's sorry.<eos> Of course he did.
Is that Grand Teton?<eos> South Teton.<eos> We were gonna do the Grand the next summer.<eos> So, what brings you here?<eos> You can't possibly have more bad news.<eos> No, but, uh, I got to ask you some questions that aren't gonna be too much fun.<eos> Were you aware that your husband might have been unfaithful?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sheriff, I knew who I was marrying, but I loved him anyway, no matter what.<eos> I still do.
So, um... what do poker chips and a flag mean, exactly?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Nighthorse wants me to believe it means the Irish Mob is coming after him 'cause he kicked them out of the casino.<eos> You don't believe him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's possible.<eos> In fact, um... I may be, uh, kind of responsible for the threat on his life.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing, really. Just, um... Well, I may have threatened the head of the Irish Mob... to his face.<eos> You did not.
We have Keaton's attorney, Jake Gregorian, with us tonight.<eos> Jake, what the hell is going on?<eos> I haven't talked to Oscar, but I can assure you this is just one giant misunderstanding.<eos> Don't let him off the hook, Lou.<eos> What kind of misunderstanding leads a client to evade law enforcement?<eos> If Oscar were guilty, I wouldn't be here. - I'd be with him.<eos> - Ask him about the traffic cam.<eos> If he's innocent, how do you explain the video footage that places Oscar's car at the scene?<eos> Does this video footage capture the image of the driver?<eos> No, it does not.
Then where did they go?<eos> And how did they get on board in the first place?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> No, I saw someone as well.<eos> Misaki... she was here, and we fought, and then she disappeared right in front of me.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I think you guys both might have had some kind of hallucination.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> - Hey, did you find Two?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
I'm dead, too.<eos> Alive, dead, we're just specks of dust. We blow away in the wind.<eos> But it makes no difference.<eos> We make no difference.<eos> Dead or alive is all the same.<eos> That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
If it was up to me, I'd let you starve.<eos> Let me guess: you're here to tell me how much time they're tacking onto my sentence.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter how much.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna get to him, and I'm gonna get to you.<eos> Sorry, Frank, but you're not getting anything tacked onto your sentence.<eos> Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
Exciting.<eos> Here's a name tag for you to wear around your neck.<eos> But will it support my weight, is the question, in the event that I elect to pass the time hanging myself?<eos> That's not funny.<eos> It's Vladimir and Estragon. "Waiting for Godot."<eos> You know, when they brought "Godot" to America, it opened in Miami in this dinner theater.<eos> It was billed as the laugh riot of two continents, and it bombed.<eos> So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing.<eos> People said it wouldn't work. They wouldn't get it. It was too highbrow.<eos> Of course, they did.
For a fee.<eos> All right.<eos> Guess I'll take you to him.<eos> Besides, this is a proposition that Escorpion will want to see in person.<eos> Let's go!<eos> ONLY THE RIGHTEOUS HAVE NO FEAR<eos> I finally triangulated Murphy's signal.<eos> He was transmitting from Spokane.<eos> Washington? That makes no sense.<eos> And anything else does?
You got to be kidding me.<eos> You have a dream, and now you're questioning if I feel bad about what I did that night?<eos> You still haven't answered whether or not you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> You need to be pissed off at me to deal with your shit, you go right ahead.<eos> But I feel horrible about what happened that night, and for your information, the guy that I hit is fully recovered right now, and I'm still in here paying for this shit.<eos> Break out the champagne, Louis.<eos> That house in the Hamptons is gonna be yours into 90 days.<eos> - They accepted my offer?<eos> - That they did.
Well, I can't get that to you right now.<eos> - Because he can't know we're doing this.<eos> Okay, Harvey, last week you told me that you were protecting me by not telling me what's going on.<eos> Stop protecting me, and what the hell is going on?<eos> I cut a deal with Sean Cahill.<eos> Sutter goes down, Mike gets out.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - I know.<eos> And don't tell me Mike still doesn't have anything for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
There's no third deal.<eos> Harvey, please.<eos> I've betrayed this man enough.<eos> I need you to convince Cahill that one person makes a case, but two people is a slam dunk.<eos> Okay, Mike.<eos> I'll make it happen.<eos> Louis?<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going on the most important date of my life tonight, and I have no idea where I'm taking her.<eos> Yes, you do.
You didn't even care enough to try.<eos> Just get out.<eos> You better be here to tell me I have a hearing.<eos> That's exactly what I'm here to tell you.<eos> But you're not gonna have anything unless you do something for me. Bullshit.<eos> Wasn't part of the deal.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> I'm tired of you threatening me, so if you even want a chance of getting out of here early, you're gonna do something for me.<eos> And by the way, it's too late to tell Kevin that I've been informing on him.<eos> I already did.
Anyone ever tell you your power is kind of gross?<eos> How about call it a draw?<eos> Done yet?<eos> How about now?<eos> Now?<eos> The Flash pestering me does not encourage my success.<eos> So we do have something in common.<eos> Yeah, but Flash is right.<eos> You need to be done.<eos> - Done in one more minute.
Fucker was in there for two hours.<eos> What we need to know now is how often.<eos> Once a week?<eos> Same day, same time?<eos> Rule number one... Never get burned.<eos> Rule number two...<eos> You're on an island with two tribes.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Does the prosecution have any questions for the witness? Does frontotemporal dementia diminish intellectual capacity, or moral clarity?<eos> No, it does not.
We've heard testimony from friends and family who say Dr. Kushel was an empathetic and self-controlled physician before he was diagnosed.<eos> That doesn't surprise me.<eos> Then could Dr. Kushel, in your opinion, have exercised willpower to stop himself from writing his wife or anyone else prescriptions for narcotics that they didn't need?<eos> - Wha... the, uh... - Could he... Could Dr. Kushel have stopped himself from writing prescriptions?<eos> Uh, in my opinion, no.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Frontotemporal dementia robbed him of that capacity.<eos> He could no more force himself to do the right thing than a man with a severed spinal column could force himself to walk.<eos> And does Dr. Kushel know what's wrong with him?<eos> - In my view, he... - Fucking right I do.
Some guy cut me in line at dinner.<eos> Called me a fucking Jew.<eos> And I said, "Fuck you, you're a Nazi."<eos> Guard hears this, comes over, takes them out with the stick.<eos> - I'm sorry about that.<eos> - Well, don't be.<eos> Not about that.<eos> You can know the difference between right and wrong and still not be able to stop.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> Yes, I did.
What do we have on Sean?<eos> So, the timeline is tight.<eos> Ashley was attacked sometime between midnight, when Melanie heard her voice...<eos> And Sean's voice.<eos> And 1:20, when Melanie called 911.<eos> Sean claims he wasn't in the house.<eos> But Sean doesn't have an alibi.<eos> From 11:30, when we confirmed he left the restaurant, to 2:05 when he arrived at the strip club.<eos> And Zach doesn't have an alibi either.<eos> No, actually, he does.
Shyvon's my girlfriend.<eos> I just looked at Ashley.<eos> And you took those photos, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what about last night?<eos> She was there posing, looking at you?<eos> Thought, "Maybe she wants to have sex with me?"<eos> Right?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yeah, Charlie, I do.
You know, as far as I know, that's not a crime.<eos> I even looked it up.<eos> Well, we're just trying to figure out what happened that night.<eos> I mean, I got to do my job, but between you and me, I don't even know why you're here.<eos> Honestly, I dated this chick once in college.<eos> I dated her for a whole semester. She thought I was an exchange student from Italy.<eos> It was the best sex I ever had.<eos> Yeah, well, that whole foreign thing works with, you know, a certain niche audience.<eos> This guy thinks he's pretty clever, huh?<eos> So does this guy.
All right.<eos> All right, guys...<eos> Fentanyl?<eos> 300 K worth.<eos> My guy in Narcotics says recently they've been pulling heroin off the streets that's been cut with it.<eos> Makes it, like, 1,000 times more potent.<eos> It's killing people all over Chicago.<eos> Hey, Sarge.<eos> I heard Mouse came looking to get a felony dropped so he could re-enlist.<eos> And if he did?
She wouldn't tell me, but I got a friend there.<eos> Story is, her and her partner were chasing a robbery suspect high speed.<eos> Suspect plows into another car and kills a mother and two kids.<eos> Vicky was never the same.<eos> I mean, she's one of us, Sarge.<eos> Yeah, I get it, but...<eos> Manny already signed a complaint.<eos> She's gonna have to do a night in the lockup.<eos> But there's got to be something that we can do.<eos> We did do something, Kim.
Love Harry.<eos> Exciting news about his new job.<eos> Yes, very exciting.<eos> I was so pleased that you'd found someone else so fast.<eos> I just can't stop conjuring an image of you sitting around that cafe, just all alone, feeling so terribly lonely.<eos> Just can't stop picturing it.<eos> I don't think you have to be alone to be lonely.<eos> Dad always taught me that.<eos> Did your father tell you that one of my pieces has gone missing?<eos> He did.
Hey!<eos> Look what I found over in menswear.<eos> A good old pair of American blue jeans pants.<eos> - Hey, lookin' good.<eos> - So casual.<eos> Good luck getting a pair of these babies in "Ma-nai-la."<eos> You know, I... I think he means well.<eos> He's... he's just... he doesn't unders...<eos> It's not like I don't love America.<eos> I do.
Country.<eos> Humanity.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> I hate death.<eos> So, how you guys doing?<eos> You mean after seeing a man hanged?<eos> As well as can be expected, I guess.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Who invited Jessica Rabbit?<eos> Algeria did.
Mostly about Nazis.<eos> Even the music round.<eos> And the picture round.<eos> And the... Nazi round.<eos> So, just kicking round the shop, then?<eos> Thought you were going to India?<eos> I am. I'm just saving up.<eos> KENT SNORTS Obviously doesn't want to go, then.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Yeah, fucking do, actually.
What does that even mean?<eos> I don't even know!<eos> What's wrong with us?<eos> !<eos> Well, I know what's wrong with me.<eos> I'm not supposed to be small, and everyone's always acting like there's no problem.<eos> "You can be anything you want to be."<eos> No, I can't!<eos> I can't even be the one thing I'm supposed to be, ya know?<eos> Of course I do.
1949.<eos> - Told you.<eos> - Uh, one interesting fact...<eos> Peggy Carter herself oversaw construction of this base.<eos> Most people know the legend of Peggy Carter, but there's so many stories that were never recorded.<eos> I remember one time...<eos> You're seeing their faces, aren't you?<eos> Everyone else... what's wrong with them?<eos> - Why don't they see it?<eos> - I do.
I got something that might help.<eos> Damn, you two must be straight loco letting me out of my cage like that.<eos> Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.<eos> I light up, I can bring this whole plane crashing down.<eos> With you in it?<eos> I don't think you'll do that.<eos> Flying isn't one of your special talents.<eos> I'm opening a door for you, Mr. Reyes, both literally and figuratively.<eos> And in return you want...?<eos> Same thing you do...
Great, 'cause, boy, do I need your help.<eos> I'm debating Senator Nadeer on television about the "Inhuman War on Humans."<eos> I hate that the media's calling it that. Burrows says it's terrible branding. But either way, this is a battle for hearts and minds.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Facts, Simmons.<eos> I need cold, hard, scientific facts to back up our case during this debate.<eos> I can put together a PowerPoint on, um, Inhuman genetics, biology, sociological impact...<eos> Yeah, here's the thing. I think it might be better if I literally had what's in your head... in my head.<eos> Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have that kind of technology.<eos> Oh, sure it does.
I remember he went over to you.<eos> He bent down to check on you. And then you moved.<eos> That's when I knew you were alive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up... that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
I didn't think it was relevant.<eos> Elizabeth, someone is stalking our family.<eos> How could a former student who is obsessed with you not be relevant?<eos> He just wanted me to be his thesis advisor.<eos> He wanted you to be a lot more than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say, "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did. - Yeah, okay.

She's sweet.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> Captain Baker.<eos> Were you able to recover the files? Well, the good news is they didn't have time to securely erase them all.<eos> So the hackers overwrote parts of the files with random data, so we had some trouble reconstructing them.<eos> But we found these among the most recently uploaded files. ...I mean demolished.<eos> You can see the construction going on over there.<eos> To build airstrips and radar stations, they pulverize the coral and pave over it with concrete, destroying it forever.<eos> She seems like good people.<eos> Yeah, she does.
We received a complaint. He says you've been following him.<eos> And he's complained?<eos> About me?<eos> He wanted us to come round and have a word before taking it any further.<eos> What do you mean "take it further"?<eos> If you carry on, you could be liable to prosecution.<eos> - We understand, officer...<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Do you know what he did?<eos> - Rob, don't.
I'll get her.<eos> Mum?<eos> Mum...<eos> We need to go soon, we can't be late.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I was... trying to decide what to wear, and then I realised it doesn't bloody matter.<eos> Adam doesn't give a damn whether I wear the stupid dress or the skirt or the...<eos> He doesn't give a damn whether I go to his funeral at all.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I do.
How is Mr. Walters?<eos> George is a tough son of bitch.<eos> - So is cancer.<eos> So it goes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I have seen the place about a dozen times, but let's make it official.<eos> Right.<eos> You brought the Pope.<eos> I brought the Pope.<eos> Well, the Second City First Committee did.
Just say when so I can get the hell out of this shithole.<eos> When was the last time you were out here?<eos> Out here?<eos> Outside the wall.<eos> Rubbing elbows with the skints.<eos> Oh, last Friday, why?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Scored a little blur, some eye candy, maybe took in the conjoined-twins freak show down on Fifth.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do.
And what about before that, when you were on your break?<eos> Were you seeing other people? - No.<eos> - Did she?<eos> No.<eos> You sure?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What if you were having a dream, and in that dream she was married to another man?<eos> I'd know it was a dream.<eos> What if it was actually true? That she had a husband?<eos> She didn't.
We were hoping you might have something personal to share. Uh... yeah.<eos> Um, my dad was...<eos> He was a great man...<eos> I had tremendous respect for him.<eos> ...as a president, but, um, you know, to me, he was just...<eos> Dad.<eos> I mean, he had the hardest job in the world, you know, um, things coming at him from everyone and everywhere, but you know, still, he was always there for me.<eos> Um, and now...<eos> I have some very big shoes to fill.<eos> Yeah, we both do.
Telling the truth earlier today might not have been the most savvy thing to do, but it felt right.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> It's the kind of president I need to be.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> I've been thinking about my Chief of Staff.<eos> Have you?<eos> And I guess I should just come right out with it.<eos> I have decided to go with Aaron.<eos> I'm sorry? I know you have misgivings about Aaron.<eos> Hell, so do I.
We're just talking.<eos> I gave you a compliment.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - Walking around in a dress like that, like you don't want attention?<eos> Look at that!<eos> I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.

You could've mentioned this technique 15 minutes ago.<eos> Screen six.<eos> There it was.<eos> You used to be such a patient person.<eos> So, pay no attention to the young man attempting the free throw.<eos> There's no way he lived through that.<eos> This video features the same teenager as several that preceded it.<eos> Obviously, his family brought in their old film to Stone Post for digitization.<eos> So I doubt they knew what they had.<eos> Aaron obviously did.
Oh, uh, Ben, get me some ice cream.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, I've given a lot of thought to coming to work here,<eos> - and... - Yeah.<eos> I think I'm gonna have to pass.<eos> - I get it.<eos> - Not that I don't appreciate the offer.<eos> I do. It's just...<eos> I don't see myself working in TV.<eos> Yeah, well, who does?
I want you to come to my games and sit in the stands, not your car.<eos> No.<eos> Look, I want to show you off.<eos> I want people, when they look at us, as a couple, to say,<eos> "Wow.<eos> That guy out-punted his coverage."<eos> Nothing to see here, folks.<eos> We're all good.<eos> Just two regular people.<eos> Nothing to do with baseball whatsoever.
We'll keep you updated.<eos> Mike, take my coat.<eos> Sir, I'm gonna need you to keep that vest on.<eos> Mike, we're here to project confidence.<eos> Does this vest project confidence to you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I win.<eos> - You cheated.<eos> - I know your game, little girl.<eos> - I did not.
Um, okay.<eos> You got to stay calm, and I'm gonna get into this right now, okay, Maria?<eos> Does the president expect the governor to just bow down?<eos> Carter, it's been seven days since Al-Sakar took credit for bombing the Capitol.<eos> When can the American people expect a response?<eos> Uh, the president is busy meeting with his advisers, and, um... working up a strategy.<eos> Can you be any more specific?<eos> Uh... not really.<eos> - But the president does have a strategy?<eos> - Of course he does.
- Sorry.<eos> Did I scare you?<eos> No. No, of course not.<eos> I was just... singing along to gospel music.<eos> Mitchie, I need a favor.<eos> It's just... with you Rosewoods, favors often give birth to secrets, and the last time I did one of you a favor, it... it... It didn't go so well.<eos> This is gonna be very different.<eos> O...kay.<eos> So Rosie knows about this favor?<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Let's just take a seat.<eos> - Come on, there you go.<eos> - Where do... Hey, you're really tall.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Where did you go?<eos> Oh.<eos> Hi. What's the emergency, Mr. Schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> - Of course he did. - He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
You know, I'm under the same kind pressure, but, Frank, it's been two years of<eos> "Daddy will be home for Christmas."<eos> He'll be here for your birthday when you're seven, or when you're eight.<eos> Maybe you just shouldn't make promises.<eos> No, I want her with me.<eos> I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me.<eos> I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
(sighs) I work for a lot of people.<eos> This is a popular blog that follows the trial, and, I got to say, the argument for the defense has a lot of merit.<eos> Mm, everything I wrote was true.<eos> (laughs)<eos> Yeah, of course. But, I mean, it's pretty clear you left out a few key details, right?<eos> Like, um...<eos> Gina and Mike and their turbulent relationship.<eos> Kind of gives Gina motive.<eos> Well, she didn't buy a gun. But Rob had a gun collection and he was dealing steroids.<eos> All the top players on their team did steroids.
Belardo made the error of leaving these letters at the back of a drawer.<eos> - Have you read them all?<eos> - Only the pertinent passages.<eos> The steamy ones.<eos> The ones that prove that Belardo has had a woman for years.<eos> You should have read them all, and with care.<eos> In this last one, he states he'll never send these letters to that woman because he's married to God.<eos> Do you have any evidence that they were mailed?<eos> Any envelopes with canceled stamps?<eos> No, no, I don't.
So long, saint.<eos> So long, Ma.<eos> Your Holiness, don't you feel well?<eos> No, no.<eos> Just a passing discomfort.<eos> - Should I call the doctor? - No, no, no, it's nothing serious. It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
Uh, a lot of talk about fire.<eos> You know anything about that?<eos> Then we have Nick the landlord.<eos> I mean, I see 10 complaints in the last two months alone on this guy.<eos> Says here they fought a lot.<eos> With fists.<eos> Like men.<eos> Yes.<eos> Nick hated Doug.<eos> They all did.
Believe it or not, you're part of this family.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> It's not every day Rumplestiltskin makes a house call.<eos> No.<eos> It's not.<eos> I see you're celebrating.<eos> Yes, well... I'm in the midst of driving a pirate-shaped wedge into the middle of the Charming clan.<eos> Care to join me.<eos> Do you remember... your old lessons?<eos> Why, yes, I do.
Syria sounds beautiful.<eos> Let us throw your going-away party.<eos> And birthdays coming up?<eos> Graduations?<eos> Quinceañeras?<eos> Why almost die in Syria when we could be out there right now almost dying in a hurricane?<eos> Oh, there's the woman my family forced me to marry.<eos> Every second we're in here is second we're not risking getting electrocuted by downed power lines.<eos> We'll see you guys later.<eos> Wha... we do funerals. Wakes, shivas, too.
I brought my brother into that shop<eos> -and I lasted a hell of a lot longer than him.<eos> -Paul--<eos> I need to work.<eos> Do you think she'll even look at these?<eos> I don't see Dominique as much of a reader, but I thought she would at least get through a Tintin.<eos> Finger.<eos> -I don't think so. Oh, come on.<eos> You don't need to stay for long, just long enough to let her know we're thinking of her, if she cares.<eos> -She does.
♪ Previously on BrainDead... ♪<eos> ♪ Previously on Gunsmoke... ♪<eos> Oh, I like him.<eos> - You do?
That's the room you were upset about for a while.<eos> I want you to pick up something.<eos> Tell them...<eos> we're ready to release it.<eos> Release what?<eos> It.<eos> And, uh, set up a press conference for me for tomorrow.<eos> Senator, do you still trust me?<eos> Do I...?<eos> Of course I do. - Why?
Just... "40% cotton."<eos> That always makes me laugh.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> No, no.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> I'll just...<eos> Laurel Healy.<eos> Miss Healy, this is Senator Red Wheatus.<eos> Do you recognize my voice?<eos> I do.
What's up?<eos> Do you want me to come back? No.<eos> What do you do with Red?<eos> Do we try to get the queen out again?<eos> No.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - ‭Oh, God.<eos> Don't tell me you think we should let the CIA handle this?<eos> No.<eos> - But you do, though?
With no heads-up.<eos> Kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.<eos> All right, so you just momentarily lost your mind and thought you were 20 again?<eos> What were you trying to prove?<eos> That I could do an Ironman.<eos> Better not affect your performance in the field today.<eos> I feel great.<eos> I don't want to hear a thing about, you know, your tight calves or your chafed nipples.<eos> Well, then you definitely don't want to hear about my rectus femoris.<eos> No, I do not. Mmm.
Of course. I'm not trying to be her mom, just a super-cool neighbor.<eos> Tay's words, not mine.<eos> "Tay"? I wonder what happens to Botox if you punch it.<eos> Can you believe Andrew Hartsfield texted her?<eos> I love that she can talk to us about that stuff.<eos> You should hear what she talks to just me about.<eos> Ooh! Who the hell is Andrew Hartsfield?<eos> I hope he's not that weirdo at the gas station.<eos> Hey, did she tell you we're doing the zombie run together?<eos> Of course, she did.
You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.<eos> Well, it's not exactly like it.<eos> We're all extremely smart.<eos> Wow... you popular girls are mean.<eos> I'm gonna get some coffee.<eos> You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem. I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
I'm glad you guys cleared that up for me.<eos> So, what do we got, Bailey?<eos> Our suspects fled in the truck after removing the LoJack.<eos> There's no witnesses, except for the driver, a retired cop by the name of Ned Brower.<eos> Ned Brower?<eos> That's my old training officer.<eos> Well, he took a pretty bad blow to the head.<eos> The EMTs are cleaning him up now.<eos> H-Hey, Roger!<eos> - How you doing, buddy?
I should have never let you talk me into this.<eos> Rog, come on, it was the only way.<eos> I mean, I love the man, but he stole 150 bricks of cold hard cash.<eos> 149.<eos> - No, it was 150.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> Let's say 149.<eos> Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money wasn't part of the plan!<eos> Uh, in fairness, I didn't have a plan.<eos> Yes, we did.
Rajon?<eos> Ra-John?<eos> - Roll. Roll the Rs. - Rowjohn?<eos> Rojon?<eos> Rrrrr.<eos> R-R-Rojohn.<eos> Rojohn.<eos> Look, every person on a crew has a role.<eos> I'm guessing yours is breaking things, moving heavy objects, maybe grunting from time to time?<eos> He does a lot of grunting.
- Jiya. - Yeah? You found the Mothership in Vegas in the past.<eos> Do you think you might be able to track her down in the present?<eos> Probably, but it'll take some time.<eos> Then get started.<eos> I forgot my...<eos> Did it work?<eos> I...<eos> I'm so sorry, Wyatt.<eos> - It was a long shot.<eos> - Do you...
Nobody asked you to fix what isn't broken.<eos> Actually, I'm pretty broken.<eos> You're just trying to make her into you.<eos> And would that be so wrong?<eos> I mean, come on, I have a beach house and a Tesla.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> I have a beach house, too.<eos> You never told us you had a beach house.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, I did not.
Digital tomography of the pillar will show exactly where interior instability lies.<eos> I'll calculate its load-bearing capacity.<eos> And a software we designed will let me engineer a rebuild.<eos> And I'll use six specialized biochemicals I mixed myself to pinpoint what molds, bacteria, or polysaccharides are causing the problem.<eos> Thousands of years ago, fungi was used to adhere concrete, and those spores could've been reactivated from L.A. pollution, Pacific salt air, or something else.<eos> We'll identify the issue and stop it from happening again.<eos> Yes, we're anxious for you to begin.<eos> Well, let's get crack-a-lackin'.<eos> My Happy needs her sleep.<eos> Before you do, a few things:
Okay, so find something for Tito to do.<eos> So I heard from One Police Plaza. They received my letter, and apparently they also received hundreds of others in support of C.J.<eos> Yeah, Emily and I sent those in, so...<eos> Emily, what was that burn I had you write down for Amy because I didn't want to forget it?<eos> "Why so sad?<eos> "Did you just find out American Girl doesn't make clothes in adult sizes?"<eos> No.<eos> "Steven Seagal called and he wants his ponytail back"?<eos> Huh-uh.<eos> "Gina: Hey, Amy, "what did one graphing calculator
Anyway, after the lightning strike, I had the perm for, like, two years.<eos> How's that?<eos> Rainer!<eos> Phil.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You're not one of those storm chasers, are you?<eos> Not since the movie "Twister" exposed how cutthroat it is.<eos> I came here to apologize.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
It was all a scheme.<eos> A lie invented by me... and Cyrus... and I'm so ashamed of it now and... what I put you through, both of you.<eos> You still don't think she needs to apologize?<eos> You've made it right.<eos> It's done now.<eos> I know why you made that deal.<eos> You didn't believe in me.<eos> Honestly, I didn't believe in myself back then either.<eos> But I need you to believe in me now.<eos> I do.
Mary, how did you get the stain out of the couch?<eos> Oh, it's a family secret.<eos> How did you get it out, Mary?<eos> You signed me up for Karate Club.<eos> If you want to do karate, you should do karate.<eos> And you're okay with that?<eos> I don't want to embarrass you.<eos> Who cares what I think?<eos> Who cares what anyone thinks?<eos> You do you, dawg.
Figured I'd keep tabs on you, you know, in case something popped up.<eos> 'Cause she misses us.<eos> Agent Gregorio!<eos> Hey!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You, too. Let's pretend you didn't.<eos> I have to get back to the Garcia case before I don't have a case to get back to.<eos> Good luck!<eos> I thought she hated beignets.<eos> She does.
- Yeah, no one cares, okay?<eos> I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.<eos> Why is it in butt thumb, Iowa?<eos> - No, it's pronounced "beaut-Hume," and Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.<eos> I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.<eos> Watch out for Sherman.<eos> He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.<eos> - Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?<eos> There's a great one in Aruba. - Aruba?<eos> Boyles don't do beaches.
Who told you to take those shots?<eos> And what should I have done?<eos> Radioed in and asked your permission if I could take the shot in the two-second window I had?<eos> I was getting through to him.<eos> That guy's life was over even before<eos> - you went in there. - With little more time, - I would have had him in cuffs.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, I wasn't willing to take that risk.<eos> What if you'd missed?<eos> - I didn't.
Recipient of the Bronze Star for bravery, and not a single strike against him on his record.<eos> King.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, hey, Alex.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing? Good.<eos> Good to see you. Wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your men get anything from surveillance cams?<eos> No. No, they didn't.
Thanks?<eos> Hold up.<eos> I present to you the mother of L.A. sporting events, and you're doing paperwork?<eos> Paperwork's not gonna do itself.<eos> You don't want to go.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I thought this was our thing.<eos> I thought you liked football.<eos> I do!
Oh, um, well, I just came...<eos> Oh, right, the Kirkwood stabbing.<eos> I heard about that. That poor nun.<eos> Not actually a real nun, by the way... just a woman in a costume.<eos> But still, stabbed right in the face... oh.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Terrible Halloween.<eos> Hey, did you see?<eos> I'm a hot dog.<eos> - I did.
Yeah, Pride, we might have a little problem with the FBI.<eos> Gregorio just made us.<eos> Damn.<eos> Okay, where is she now?<eos> Looks like she's on foot walking down Rampart.<eos> - Be right with you.<eos> - Okay, well,<eos> Patton found the brother of our dead gunman, James Connor.<eos> Uh-oh. Yeah, he may have spotted me.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Caroline Vonderhoss.<eos> Wow. A published author.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'd...<eos> I'd love to read this.<eos> - Okay, you're all set. - Let's go to the hospital, - get you some stitches.<eos> - Oh, can I bring Bella?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No. Bella gets so nervous alone and you have no idea how hard it is to find a good sitter.<eos> I do, actually.
I'm an accountant.<eos> Wow, so you work in accounting.<eos> Where?<eos> At Sanitation Solutions.<eos> Oh, no way!<eos> I work at Sanitation Solutions, too.<eos> I mean, what are the odds that you would have your number on a bathroom wall, and I'm the guy calling it?<eos> Well, I should probably go find my kid.<eos> Oh, what's up?<eos> - How you doing?
Protective custody, in case the unsub sees her as unfinished business.<eos> - We good? - Mm-hmm.<eos> We fly.<eos> "The malicious have a dark happiness."<eos> Bridget and Scott Bergstrom grew up in Winona and have deep ties to the community.<eos> Scott was a local distributor of farm equipment.<eos> Bridget cut hair at a salon in the mall.<eos> Yet they were murdered by a family annihilator.<eos> Sad but true. The Bergstrom family had their share of dirty laundry.<eos> Though who of us does not?
It may have been a rendezvous place for the Allied Resistance.<eos> It's not 100%.<eos> The accounts are spotty, but maybe someone there can point us in the right direction.<eos> Just so I'm clear, you want to drop us into Nazi territory, roll up blind to some bar, and just convince someone there that we don't know to help us?<eos> By the way, bring him?<eos> Well, it's either that or give the Nazis a nuclear weapon.<eos> Well, does anyone here even speak German?<eos> I do.<eos> Really?<eos> You do?
When we get inside, let me talk to him. He and I have history.<eos> He and I don't. I'll be more persuasive.<eos> Is that what this has come to?<eos> The chance for you to punish me by hurting someone I care about?<eos> You are not my concern. Agnes is.<eos> If someone you care about is hurt in the process of finding her, so be it.<eos> Do you remember what I looked like that night?<eos> Lying in the street, my head torn open, Annie's body in front of me?<eos> You know I don't know what you looked like. I was away.<eos> Right. But he does.
They're moving in now.<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> Drop it!<eos> - Reddington?<eos> - He's gone.<eos> The Feds are Halbeck's problem.<eos> All that matters to me is that we are right on schedule.<eos> Gentlemen, mind if I join you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
How would you do that?<eos> He admires Kirk, says he's a good man.<eos> He shouldn't.<eos> And he's not.<eos> I'm in the middle.<eos> Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk.<eos> Can you at least admit how difficult that is?<eos> No.<eos> It's only difficult if you accept the premise that Kirk is your father.<eos> I don't.
- Where's my money?<eos> - I'm working on it, but that amount of money takes time.<eos> "Better than he deserves."<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> You ever invented anything?<eos> You ever experience that moment of discovery?<eos> It's a revelation.<eos> And the man you shot?<eos> Will never know what that feels like.<eos> But I do.
He drowned a long time ago.<eos> Thomas Katz.<eos> What's your take on him?<eos> I would have thought he was a good kid until he fell in with the likes of Hammers.<eos> You questioned him about a 1989 October assault on a man named Ned Davies, who later went missing, presumed dead.<eos> Yeah, on December 17.<eos> December 17.<eos> That's close enough to when you picked up the weapon off Hammers and Toohey.<eos> I'd like to have it tested for DNA.<eos> But does Peel?
You've just moved from the country, haven't you? Yes, sir.<eos> What, Goulburn?<eos> You wanna be careful.<eos> City's dangerous.<eos> Don't put your fellow officers in jeopardy again.<eos> Are you happy now? You, Peel, your old boys' club.<eos> Five minutes' time, you'll be down at the pub, slapping each other on the back while that poor man lies in the morgue.<eos> Didn't go well, then?<eos> The truth is Rohan Asad was gay and illegal, and because of that, no-one gives a shit, including you.<eos> Well... actually, I do, Tori.
I'll suss out the vibe.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> I'm not gonna get my hopes up.<eos> Oh, before I go...<eos> From my dad.<eos> _<eos> It was so awkward.<eos> But I couldn't say no to my dad.<eos> Oh, yeah, I hear you.<eos> Cost of doing business.
Are you gonna register to vote this year, Mom?<eos> No interest.<eos> American politics is so boring compared to Taiwan.<eos> And those people were in the same party.<eos> Well, I believe in voting.<eos> Who we pick as president matters.<eos> There's so many issues at stake.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not as if your vote counts.<eos> - Of course it does.
- Unfortunately, no.<eos> We're working as fast as we can, but may take at least a few hours to get all systems back online.<eos> He's been having symptoms since yesterday, he may not have too long<eos> - before his appendix ruptures.<eos> - Is there some kind of lifeboat to get him back to Earth?<eos> - The Russian Soyuz capsule.<eos> - Even if he could get to it, the force of gravity alone on the journey could burst his appendix.<eos> Lenny, we're gonna try to override that lockdown.<eos> But in the meantime, do you have a pulse oximeter there?<eos> - I do. - You do?
So, how's it going?<eos> Weird.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It started with the I'm gonna hurl first day jitters, but now there's this.<eos> I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah. Anyway, what's up?<eos> I was just checking to see if we had a case.<eos> We don't.<eos> We don't?
Where's he going?<eos> Go left, go left.<eos> It's a loop.<eos> We can get ahead of him.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> That was no fucking accident, it was deliberate.<eos> You heard what he said, he misjudged his speed, braked too hard.<eos> And you believe that?<eos> Newman did.
And that's not what I wanted.<eos> So I went to his house to say I was sorry.<eos> Anyone see you talk to him?<eos> Bruno wasn't there.<eos> Just that nasty old witch, Frimkes.<eos> She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police.<eos> So I got the hell out of there.<eos> She saw that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
That's a...<eos> That's a big earthquake, right?<eos> Where?<eos> - Venezuela.<eos> - Yeah, that's huge.<eos> Everything's been knocked out.<eos> There's no communication.<eos> There hasn't been much upkeep on the infrastructure there, but a quake that size could be devastating.<eos> Do we have an embassy in Caracas?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Now I'm going to let a bit of air out of the tyres.<eos> This made a huge difference.<eos> This is rubbish!<eos> Stop!<eos> But it didn't stop.<eos> It went on and on.<eos> That day, I did 350 miles, and every single one of them was filled with pain, dust and misery.<eos> And that's why , the following morning, I came up with a radical plan.<eos> Don't drive on the road, drive near it.<eos> I did a bit alongside the road.
I saw a lot of stuff when I was living in his place.<eos> He had armed guards. I'm not a huge fan of guns.<eos> Um, he had meetings with people that were also armed.<eos> Um‐‐ At one point he said that he was working on a book with two heavily armed, very built men from the Ukraine.<eos> I mean, I don't know, this is probably not relevant.<eos> ‐ I'm sorry, this is‐‐ ‐ [Nanette] That's okay.<eos> This is the tangent that I told you I would go on.<eos> [Nanette] Yeah, that's okay.<eos> That's part of interviewing. ‐ It's just, there's‐‐ ‐ [Nanette] There's a lot of tangents.<eos> People‐‐we all do it.
[Man] Did it take you a while to come to that realization?<eos> Yeah, about 65 years.<eos> [Man] Now, McAfee plans to take his remaining handful of millions and head to Central America, where he started a new venture to develop natural medicines.<eos> [Nanette] I asked John if he moved to Belize because he lost so much money.<eos> He said, "Not at all, I lost very little."<eos> So I asked if he transferred his money to offshore accounts.<eos> ♪♪♪<eos> [John] I was living on the island of San Pedro. Fishing and boating and having a great old time.<eos> But I was bored silly.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> That's my handwriting, but I didn't write that.<eos> But you will.<eos> I lost my whole family.<eos> Because you murdered them.<eos> Rittenhouse murdered them.<eos> I asked about Rittenhouse, and no one's ever heard of him.<eos> Rittenhouse isn't a "him." It's a "they."<eos> Really?<eos> You do?
But, you know what, doesn't matter.<eos> I think that you should go.<eos> Now.<eos> I can't believe I wasted my caboose favor on you.<eos> You bet all of my money on a horse race?<eos> And I won!<eos> 22,000 bucks.<eos> What?<eos> You have $22,000?<eos> Well, I did.

And you better hope she's not a bunny boiler because then you're screwed.<eos> She's not a bunny boiler.<eos> Then put her out of her misery.<eos> How do you know so much about it?<eos> Because I've been on both sides of that phone.<eos> I've ducked my share of calls...<eos> And you boiled your share of bunnies? No.<eos> I've showed up at a doorstep or two. I'm not proud of that, though.<eos> Well, why do you care so much about it, anyway?<eos> I don't, Lasalle.
I guess that counts as music.<eos> I like noises, too.<eos> _<eos> You know, I was just curious if anyone at the table has any hidden talents.<eos> I can pretend I'm interested in mundane conversations.<eos> I know Morse code.<eos> Wow, that's really interesting, Hank!<eos> Deirdre, do you have any hidden talents?<eos> Thank you very much for asking, Evie.<eos> And, yes, I do.
You're not listening.<eos> She's not listening.<eos> They're saying... that without the treatments, the cancer will kill you before the baby's even born.<eos> In a month, two months, you'll both be dead.<eos> I went to court to fight a traffic ticket so I could save $360 so we could buy an organic crib mattress.<eos> This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line. There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
I can wait.<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> Um, I'll be pretty late, so don't wait up, 'kay?<eos> Um, I'm sorry.<eos> They were supposed to tell you not to wait. I had a Whipple.<eos> I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
My business isn't going well enough<eos> - to give away free product. - Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Even after I invite you into my home, give you hospitality, serve you my special mate?<eos> - Mate.<eos> - Mate.<eos> - No...<eos> - Doesn't that count for anything?<eos> Oh, no, it really does.
- Webber's right.<eos> Transplant's the only way to save this patient.<eos> I'm removing his liver. It's only making him worse.<eos> - Scissors.<eos> - Do not make that cut!<eos> Basin.<eos> Clips, please.<eos> Boki.<eos> We decided not to list him.<eos> No, you did.
Big... Big second half.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Um, what did you mean before when, uh...<eos> When you said...<eos> "Promise me we'll never have kids"? Oh.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
What?<eos> Yeah, Kate, you're fired.<eos> You're the personal assistant to your brother, all right?<eos> A brother who locks himself in his master bedroom closet.<eos> A master bedroom closet that happens to have a mini-bar in it.<eos> Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?<eos> Just for a little while to see what happens.<eos> You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.<eos> I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.<eos> I do.
Sean didn't care about you.<eos> - You were his patsy.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> He let you rot in prison because he never really cared about you.<eos> Stop saying that. I know that he loved me.<eos> - You're delusional.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Prove it!<eos> - Tell me you love me.<eos> - I do.
1, 2, 3.<eos> - Paris.<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Give me your purse 'cause it's fabulous!<eos> Hey!<eos> No!<eos> We don't know him!<eos> We don't know him!<eos> Yes, we do!<eos> Yes, we do!
Okay, guys.<eos> Here comes the next question.<eos> I really appreciate you inviting me to this trivial event, Hank.<eos> Supposed to be counterintuitive.<eos> This Zap Strap is amazing!<eos> T-Leaf, sit down and join us.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'm already on round nine, about to level up.<eos> I haven't thought about Evie for 31,207 steps.<eos> I just did.
- Ew, why are you wearing those?<eos> The other night at trivia,<eos> Deirdre whispered in my ear, and something happened.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She said,<eos> "Excuse me, I need to go to the ladies room."<eos> I don't get it.<eos> It's not what she said, it's how she said it.<eos> Her voice is just so husky, and erotic.<eos> And it did something to me.
You were gay.<eos> Am gay.<eos> Currently.<eos> Current.<eos> Gay.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Guys, are you hearing this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yep, yep.<eos> Mm-hmm. - We did.
God bless the Navy.<eos> - I know, right? Uh-huh. Yeah.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I worked under Lieutenant Mills.<eos> Strict.<eos> Hard worker.<eos> But she just joined the ship, sir.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I didn't know her personally, sir.<eos> None of us did.
Oh, thank you.<eos> Your shirt's buttoned wrong.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Mistletoe.<eos> And look at Randall.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, we don't want to see that.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Come on, now!<eos> You guys know that name of all of Santa's reindeer?<eos> You don't?
Whoa, is this wall just sticky, or is it... magnetic?<eos> We have got to get a magnetic wall.<eos> We will never buy another coil of wires connected to a battery again in our lives.<eos> It'll pay for itself in a week.<eos> Okay, Roughstuff Productions referred me to their former subsidiary Tick Tock Erotica, LLC, which split from Roughstuff back in '09.<eos> But here's the thing.<eos> Tick Tock is in the app space now, but they still use the same headhunter.<eos> And they still had the number for a Mr. Mort Capaco, locations manager, Daddy's Longleg.<eos> - Did he know where they shot it?<eos> - He did not.
Hey, how's Matt doing?<eos> - He's fine. - Why?<eos> Seems like he took that little boy's death hard.<eos> Sorry, what are we talking about?<eos> The little boy, from the warehouse accident.<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> Matt came by and brought some "get well" flowers, but the kid was gone.<eos> I figured he told you.<eos> N... no.<eos> He didn't.
Ah, behold the power of non-biodegradable polyethylene.<eos> Bit of a future environmental catastrophe, but, today, it could save our asses.<eos> - How's that gonna work?<eos> - Connor will fly to this spot with a team of archaeologists and dig this up.<eos> We're standing in what's going to be a suburb of Pittsburgh.<eos> I mean, who knows what could happen to this patch of land over 260 years.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why we got to dig deep.<eos> And this system generally works?<eos> Don't know. No one's ever tried it.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
The Devil in My Daughter, which she says is the true story of a time several years ago when young Regan was possessed by a demon.<eos> Now, Regan, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I may.<eos> Although your mother has warned me that you're a little shy.<eos> I'm quiet. Not shy.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?<eos> Since most of our viewers don't believe in demon possession, can you help me... help us... understand what you went through?<eos> I-I don't really remember it.<eos> You do.<eos> She does.
I always do... what's right."<eos> Now will you let me out of the cage?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Great.<eos> What part of me are you gonna eat?<eos> Oh, well, I'm a vegan, so I'm probably just gonna have, like, a pinecone salad.<eos> Ooh, maybe with some bog pudding, 'cause it is my cheat day.<eos> Ahh, I really thought the whole school spirit act was gonna work.<eos> It did.
Evan, you ready for me to drive you to church?<eos> I thought I'd come to Costco today.<eos> They just got in the off-model Kenneth Cole kids' blazers.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Oh, y-yeah. Of course it is.<eos> Great, and I can go to church next Sunday.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Eddie, I'll pick you up some porridge since you could only eat soft food.<eos> Does that mean I don't have to finish this?<eos> Of course you don't.
Over there.<eos> Well, you can ask Mr. Coyne.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> Ask him, then.<eos> Get him in here from the bar.<eos> We'll ask him.<eos> Mr. Coyne has gone on an errand.<eos> Cheeky buggers.<eos> Have you ever got corned beef here, Ellen Quinn?<eos> Er... no, Mrs. Coyne. I never did.
What if he is killed in action?<eos> She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her.<eos> You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her.<eos> It would cast a shadow over her life.<eos> I understand.<eos> Mrs. Coyne.<eos> You knew.<eos> What?<eos> What was being planned.<eos> I didn't.
Hey. Hey.<eos> That all I get for a workplace drop by?<eos> Hellos and good-byes aren't really your thing, huh?<eos> I'm sorry about the other night.<eos> Dinner's on me.<eos> You're spoiling me rotten, Sullivan.<eos> Well, when you're done with that, I'm putting you to work.<eos> We're combing through and searching for any mention of a girl named Meghan.<eos> Meghan have a last name?<eos> She does not.
If someone's the one, Raimes... you got to swing for the fences, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Meghan?<eos> Before we speak, there's someone here who I'd like to join us.<eos> Hi, Meghan.<eos> Dr. Goldberg gave me a call.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> I really hoped you were getting better.<eos> We all did.
- You don't get to do that.<eos> You blew up my life.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> At least I have the balls to tell you what I'm doing to your face.<eos> I've been taking care of myself.<eos> All right.<eos> I made choices.<eos> But you're making choices now too.<eos> Even if I got out today, it doesn't matter.<eos> It never did.
Your wish is my command, especially if it's gonna hurt her.<eos> But remember, all wishes come with a price. I know.<eos> That's why I'm not gonna wish for anything to do with Emma or Snow or anyone I actually care about.<eos> No, Aladdin.<eos> The only one that's gonna pay the price is her.<eos> Genie...<eos> I wish... that the Evil Queen gets exactly... what she deserves.<eos> Aladdin, what's going on? I don't know.<eos> I granted your wish.<eos> No, you didn't.
Excuse me.<eos> I need to speak with an FBI agent named Hannah Wells.<eos> - Can you find her for me?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hannah Wells?<eos> Why does the president want to know about Hannah Wells?<eos> He's interested in some information she claims to have on Peter MacLeish. Why?<eos> What kind of information did she say she had?<eos> She didn't.
The FBI just handed in their report, and it concludes that Jason Atwood did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on as a White House correspondent to keep us honest.<eos> She kept up her end of the bargain.<eos> We need to do the same.<eos> Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
And when something goes wrong, with finding someone else to blame. Okay, at this point, move closer to Izzy.<eos> Yes, she's made a career<eos> - out of creating... - out of creating.<eos> An image of perfection.<eos> But that doesn't mean that she's perfect.<eos> If she's guilty of something, it's that she works too hard.<eos> She tries too hard to help people achieve more in their lives.<eos> Now, this has helped her to create an amazing company, but Isabella will be the first to admit it has not made her good at maintaining personal relationships, especially with those she cares about the most.<eos> I didn't write that.<eos> Neither did I.
All right, he might be a doctor, but the woman in blue is dying and the hostess is right there, not worried at all.<eos> If she didn't poison her on purpose, how do you explain that, Rafael?<eos> She's blind.<eos> That's why she's not looking at the woman who's choking.<eos> She really is blind.<eos> Let me see that, Marco.<eos> Not everyone would assume there are people with special needs on the Offshore.<eos> How did you know that, Joana?<eos> His desk has a lamp on it.<eos> Hers doesn't.
I want to see him.<eos> You know that's impossible.<eos> He's all alone, Ezequiel.<eos> In a few years, he will apply to the Process.<eos> If he passes, you will meet again.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then he doesn't deserve to be missed at all.<eos> Because he's one of them... not one of us.<eos> -It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel. -Julia...<eos> It doesn't.
What's left for me now?<eos> You really feel that way, then you need to go ahead and turn that thing on yourself.<eos> Look, Riggs... we don't know yet if Flores had anything to do with Miranda.<eos> The best way to find out is to arrest him for the murders of two women we know he killed.<eos> Once we have him, we can find out the rest.<eos> What if he pleads down, or walks?<eos> If we get him the right way, and he walks, I will help you find him.<eos> I'm not asking for your help, Roger.<eos> I know.<eos> You never do.
Bouncing around three different women at the same time.<eos> I was a bad guy.<eos> But she saw through my insecurities.<eos> She gave me a chance to be the man that she knew that I could be.<eos> But you know what it's like.<eos> She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> For certain.<eos> No, they don't.
How deep down the rabbit hole are you?<eos> I'm the Mad Hatter, Danny.<eos> I'm in Wonderland.<eos> She's the perfect client.<eos> The hospital won't press charges.<eos> Too many people worshipping at the altar of the Angel of Sacred Heart.<eos> Who would besmirch an angel?<eos> It's blasphemy.<eos> The hospital wants her hemophilia B cure.<eos> A lot of hospitals do... all over the country.
You have a very sexy... somethin'-somethin' going on, believe me.<eos> But there's a thing about you that bugged me.<eos> You walk around like you own the place. It's annoying.<eos> It's charming.<eos> Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See?<eos> That. That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
The police stopped looking.<eos> I gave up because you told me she was dead.<eos> He showed me a clip from "GMA."<eos> It was my mom talking about my murder... so that I'd know no one was coming for me.<eos> Can you remember anything else?<eos> He called me his baby girl.<eos> I'd hear him coming down the stairs every night like clockwork.<eos> Then a few nights ago, it stopped.<eos> That's when I knew if I didn't get out, I was gonna die down there.<eos> I didn't, but...
To take us back?<eos> Only if you want us to.<eos> I just want to make sure that... that everyone is okay, and that being out here is what everyone really wants, that's all.<eos> But I'm going to need your help... to find them.<eos> I know who you're looking for, but I don't know where he is.<eos> You mean Logan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Logan.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> None of us do.
- No, of course not, you're above all that.<eos> Just give me the chocolates.<eos> There's a little chart in there so you don't get surprised by anything.<eos> You wouldn't want to bite into one of those cherry squirty ones when you're wearing a white blouse.<eos> Look, we didn't mean to insult you.<eos> You know, it's just how we show appreciation.<eos> I mean, we kiss butt because we love.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's be honest, butt kissing makes the world go round.<eos> Everybody does it.
I'm up front setting you up for jokes to make you look good.<eos> I'm having a physical reaction to this scenario.<eos> You're gonna give me hives.<eos> Hives are on your mom.<eos> I'm about sweat and eczema.<eos> - So, Taylor...<eos> - Huh? Why did Sophie tell Natalie that you're acting like Madison?<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - You told me.<eos> No, I didn't.
He got hit by comet dust.<eos> Sort of like that.<eos> Your blood changed, and you became a one-in-a-million match for a transplant.<eos> So your donor kind of is a superhero, because they're one in a million just like you.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name is Angie.<eos> I was sent up to deliver this.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Actually, uh, they said I need to deliver it to the patient in the east wing in person.<eos> No, they didn't.
You're gonna have my back today, right?<eos> I-I don't know what you mean.<eos> Look, listen.<eos> I'm all for diversity.<eos> I think it's great.<eos> This whole international thing you're doing here.<eos> But... I don't want a kidney from just anyone.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I wish I had better news.<eos> Lauren's dropped out of the chain. Come on!<eos> What did she say?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Did you even fight for it?<eos> Doctor, these chains are fragile.<eos> We all knew something like this could happen at any time.<eos> I know you're disappointed.<eos> I am, too, but we have to respect Lauren's decision.<eos> No, actually, we don't, because...
'Allo.<eos> Pretty as a daisy, you are.<eos> Oh, look. You've hired your friends to dress up as English stereotypes.<eos> Isn't it whimsical?<eos> Can I get your largest glass of alcohol, please?<eos> Is something wrong? Well, yes.<eos> I mean, I said that I needed some space, and then all of this.<eos> I'm not really sure how much clearer I could have been.<eos> I think I have a clue.<eos> Glad someone does.
It's good to see you.<eos> Of all the... different scenarios that I had in my head about how you would greet me, that... that wasn't one of them.<eos> How are...?<eos> How are Henry and the kids? They're great.<eos> Everybody's...<eos> Stevie's engaged.<eos> Wow!<eos> You like the guy?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Maybe even more than she does.
Yeah, I know who you are. I've seen you on TV.<eos> How'd you get in the attic?<eos> I installed their security system last Fall.<eos> And while you were at it, you just thought you'd slap up a couple of your own... personal cameras?<eos> So what really happened?<eos> Did Johnny figure out that you were filming, threatened to call the cops, so you killed him?<eos> Nobody knew what I was doing.<eos> Oh. Why did you send that sex video to "Louise Herrick Live"?<eos> Why?<eos> I did the security installation at that house, for cost.
Look for anything suspicious...<eos> Fights between the roommates, unwanted guests, drugs... Anything that might point the finger away from Maya and towards another suspect.<eos> This is gonna take days.<eos> I suggest you grab yourself a paralegal.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> Jake, uh, Johnny Weston's father is here?<eos> He says you called him.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, he knows we represent Maya, right?<eos> He does.
- Yeah, no problem.<eos> - Put her there.<eos> Kareema says I should stop doing that with you.<eos> I just want to be cool. You guys won't let me...<eos> You-You're cool... in your own Evie way, it's cool.<eos> Attention, Cybermart employees.<eos> Attention...<eos> Cybermart employees.<eos> The future... who knows what it will bring?<eos> I do.
I can't.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> You cut up an innocent woman.<eos> I didn't cut her up.<eos> I performed an operation...<eos> An operation she didn't ask for.<eos> Now she can't have kids.<eos> She couldn't have children before the surgery because of the fibroids.<eos> So that gives you permission to mangle a young woman's body?<eos> I didn't man...
Saw your car.<eos> Joyce Magruder. At Mossy Green Realty.<eos> Jason Bull. Hi.<eos> Benny Colón.<eos> Jason Bull.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would remember that smile anywhere.<eos> I-I used to be Joyce Devlin.<eos> You probably wouldn't remember me.<eos> Of course I do, Joyce.
Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists.<eos> And, here, it does so in abundance.
I'm that little voice in the back of your head. I'm every rotten lie you've ever told.<eos> I'm not a liar.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You lied about Jessica, you lied about hearing God's voice... that was a personal favorite.<eos> "Look at this family. See how they are suffering."<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> You were trying to be special.<eos> You were trying to pass the buck on every lousy decision you've ever made.<eos> God didn't want you, Tomas.<eos> He never did.
- I can?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let's see.<eos> KXHD136.<eos> You memorized the package tracking number, but you didn't know that you could use that number to track the package?<eos> What?<eos> 9:18 A.M. refused delivery?<eos> Did you refuse a package to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo?<eos> Listen to what you just asked.<eos> Of course I did.
Ooh, that's a strong move.<eos> Have you successfully changed everything about yourself as planned?<eos> Oh, yeah, you wouldn't recognize me.<eos> I'm wearing a sweater, I bought new shoes, I put something on my face called "moisturizer."<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> - Did you clean your car?<eos> I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part:<eos> I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.<eos> Who has a favorite font?<eos> The Santiagos do.
What?<eos> Well, you do not seem to accept the verdict of the gods.<eos> What is their verdict?<eos> You tell me.<eos> If you want to know if the gods still favor you, then look around.<eos> Look at us.<eos> You give the gods too much credit.<eos> Oh, so then you disagree with all of us?<eos> With the Seer, with everyone?<eos> What if I do?
But light is not likely to penetrate a human brain.<eos> The hippocampus is too deep.<eos> I was thinking of something, - a little less...<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> ...insane.<eos> Instead of light, we use electricity.<eos> We use neurostimulation to jump-start his hippocampus.<eos> We send electromagnetic pulses that can penetrate brain tissue.<eos> Even if that works, how do we know for certain that Ryan's memories are still in there?<eos> We don't.
So long, Walter.<eos> Thanks for all the good times.<eos> Godspeed, Mr. Madison.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> This is really hard.<eos> Oscar, it's okay. Take your time.<eos> Dad, I'm really gonna miss you.<eos> I hope that wherever you are, the New York Mets are on and it's always the '86 World Series.<eos> I loved being your son.<eos> I still do.
Took me three towns to shake 'em.<eos> Yeah, go get dressed.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - This is Lucy and Wyatt.<eos> Lucy and Wyatt, this is one of our best friends, Henry Methvin.<eos> They helped us out with the bank job yesterday.<eos> Did they now?<eos> Guess we were just in the right place at the right time.<eos> And where did you say you were from?<eos> - She didn't.
No, first you tell the banker.<eos> You had a sugar daddy?<eos> When?<eos> In college...<eos> I answered an ad.<eos> It was 100 bucks an hour to be a companion to a sweet old man.<eos> He was losing his sight and wanted me to read him the classics.<eos> How is that a sugar daddy?<eos> Did I leave out that I was naked?<eos> - Yes, yes, you did. - Yeah.
Answers to what?<eos> What does all this mean?<eos> Uh, it's a website for a new program in Germany.<eos> It shows some promise with undifferentiated sarcoma.<eos> She... she wants him to keep fighting, but he's done fighting.<eos> You think that's what's happening?<eos> What, it's not?<eos> What's happening is that he needs a friend, but she doesn't see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> Of course she does.
Why?<eos> What's in the backpack?<eos> Uh, just some evidence.<eos> Do you guys know - a drug dealer named Flaco?<eos> - Oh, yeah, he's a big-time supplier, consolidated half the territory in Brooklyn.<eos> Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine...<eos> I'm not good with sizes...<eos> and a cell phone.<eos> And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now.
Who's killing the mood now?<eos> Found the backup inhaler.<eos> Want to have sex?<eos> Well, I didn't until I heard that.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'm counting.<eos> It's okay. Mm.<eos> KOOTHRAPPALI (sing-songy):<eos> Hello! Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they're having a girl!<eos> (sing-songy): Oopsy, I did it again.
Empty nest?<eos> That will be an adjustment.<eos> I want to make it as special as I can.<eos> For Michelle, but especially for Kam.<eos> I'm sure you're doing great.<eos> Yeah, well, hopefully, if I'm not, she'd tell me.<eos> We should check out Jenkins' loft.<eos> We'd need a warrant.<eos> I'm not an agent yet. I don't need one.<eos> You do.
Drop it.<eos> Nice and easy, put it down.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Put the wrench down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> That was very, uh...<eos> Home Alone of you.<eos> Watched it three times last week. Uh-huh.<eos> Just for the record, I had him.<eos> Of course you did.

We've been friends so long I don't have to ask these stupid questions.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, what were we doing last time we saw each other?<eos> God, who can remember that?<eos> It was 150 years ago, which would have been the cholera outbreak in London!<eos> You wouldn't have missed that.<eos> You love plagues!<eos> Who doesn't?
63 Building?<eos> 63 Building<eos> Gangnam Station - 63 Building<eos> 63 Building<eos> -Welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Welcome.<eos> You don't have a bus card?<eos> What about money?<eos> I do.
Harming Martin and Gracia will not solve anything, and will only deprive their children and our family of the people that we love.<eos> Their children need them and our family needs them.<eos> Martin and Gracia, we love you.<eos> We hope you come home soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [Gracia] I should've known.<eos> We've not been forgotten.<eos> They care about us. They...<eos> They aren't just sitting back waiting for the status quo to happen.<eos> [Regini] She did a great job.
You spent half my childhood chasing that award.<eos> I remember sitting in the university by the copy machine while you made copies of invariant theory.<eos> This means more.<eos> You, your mother.<eos> It all means more.<eos> I'm sorry, Xavier.<eos> I just didn't have the strength to watch my soul mate fade away, one little piece at a time.<eos> Yeah, well, what about me?<eos> You know, Rose said that you needed someone to cling to.<eos> So did I.
What if we asked customers to repurpose delivery boxes as donation boxes?<eos> They could fill them up with old clothes, toys, even canned food, and a Cybermart delivery person in the area would take it to a nearby shelter or donation center.<eos> We could call it "Getters and Givers."<eos> It's not bad.<eos> It would barely cost us anything to set in motion, and... it would be quite the PR boon.<eos> For someone that smells like soup, you've got good ideas.<eos> I can't believe that you packed your own mother into a bunch of fireworks.<eos> As you get to know me better, it'll become easier to believe.<eos> Mom loved fireworks.<eos> She really did.
It's winter.<eos> Joon Jae, Cheong's also wearing a skirt!<eos> Go change.<eos> Why?<eos> It's the one you bought it for me last time.<eos> - Do you think I bought it for you to wear going outside?<eos> - You didn't?<eos> I bought it for you to hang in the closet.<eos> Do you think that makes sense?<eos> Of course it does!
Alexei... tell me why Leo was arrested.<eos> See, the bosses believe that he was working for the West, but... I believe he was working on this.<eos> Series of child murders, you see?<eos> Your son, may he rest in peace,<eos> - he was murdered, yes?<eos> - No.<eos> He was killed in an accident.<eos> But at first you believed he was murdered, right?<eos> Sit down.<eos> At first, yes, I did.
Your pretend friends?<eos> No, they're lost people.<eos> They're not pretend, Mommy.<eos> That girl's gonna put me in a hole, man.<eos> She's grounded.<eos> Judge Bowen has spoken.<eos> For at least 24 hours.<eos> Remind her she's babysitting tonight, will you?<eos> I hate when Kendra babysits.<eos> So does she, pal.
They are trapped and they are desperate.<eos> And your daughter is their ticket out of this purgatory.<eos> What do they want with her?<eos> They want her to be their lantern in the darkness.<eos> To lead them into the light.<eos> What happens if she goes into the light?<eos> There's no getting her back if she does that.<eos> Just because he said that, it doesn't mean... that's true, okay?<eos> Nothing you've said makes sense to me.<eos> And everything else does, right?
I know.<eos> But it made me think, and I concluded that you might be right.<eos> God bless Con Ed.<eos> And there was light!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've gotta go.<eos> Thank you for dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> "Moreno" means brown in Spanish, did you know that?<eos> Yes, I did, of course.
Joe.<eos> I think it's a mistake.<eos> You're entitled to your own opinion.<eos> Well, let me rephrase that.<eos> I think it's a big mistake.<eos> Apart from time and resources, it's bringing an unknown into a... - into a really bad situation.<eos> - Not unknown at all.<eos> I've worked with him before, and he's actually my friend.<eos> - You said he's unstable.<eos> - I did not, Katherine.
T-1000.<eos> Liquid metal.<eos> Shape-changer.<eos> It just needs to touch something to mimic it.<eos> You know about terminators?<eos> And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
But I know it's real.<eos> No.<eos> We go to 1997.<eos> Reese, put that back!<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> But that is my one bullet to fire at the heart of Skynet.<eos> Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No. I don't.
But that is my one bullet to fire at the heart of Skynet.<eos> Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No. I don't.<eos> You can do this.<eos> A straight line.<eos> You just go, and you don't look back.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> In a past I shouldn't remember.<eos> But I do.
Well, seems to me you'd have to believe in fuckin' leprechauns to think we'd have the biggest crime lord in Boston and be brothers with the most powerful politician in the state, and them not be helping each other out.<eos> I grew up with Billy, Southie.<eos> Sol know him, I know that he knows that it would be crazy for him to get mixed up in anything that Jimmy does. It's, you know, too brazen.<eos> I'll ask you again.<eos> How come no one has done Whitey Bulger?<eos> He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones, that kinda stuff, and, uh...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
What, better than you?<eos> How many men would sacrifice their careers for their family like you have?<eos> Oh, I didn't sacrifice anything.<eos> I have everything I've ever wanted.<eos> - Debbie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Will you continue to be my wife?<eos> I wondered when you'd give that back to me.<eos> I was wondering if you still wanted it.<eos> I do.
- Holy shit!<eos> We have no confidence in your ability to identify macroeconomic trends.<eos> You flew here to tell me that?<eos> Why? Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble.<eos> Actually, no one can see a bubble. That's what makes it a bubble.<eos> That's dumb, Lawrence.<eos> There's always markers.<eos> Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring. That means the homes are debt, not assets.<eos> So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.<eos> Well... Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
God! I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling.<eos> Ow! Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up.<eos> Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.<eos> Please explain that to me. There's no way that makes sense.<eos> There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.<eos> Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?<eos> Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did.
You know, just...<eos> - You haven't really talked about it?<eos> - Well, not really, no.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think He has a plan... and all three of us are part of it somehow.<eos> But it was us believers, don't you think?<eos> Just like this valley... why it survived, why you and I did... because we have faith.<eos> What if you don't have faith?<eos> You have to.<eos> - Not everybody does.
You look important.<eos> Or, at least, your suit does.
Listen, I can't talk right now.<eos> Go right ahead, we're not doing anything important.<eos> Just your run of the mill double homicide investigation.<eos> Shut up, I can't hear.<eos> Maybe I should get out of the car, give you some privacy.<eos> When?<eos> Can I call you later?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> You got a date?<eos> Yeah, I do. Something serious?
I just wanted to wish you good luck with the house and...<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'll see you Monday.<eos> I'll see you Monday, thanks for stopping by.<eos> - Nice to meet you. - Yeah.<eos> Roommates don't sleep in the same bed.<eos> - He's my partner.<eos> - No, I'm your partner.<eos> That is the person you work with. And he's got a total crush on you.<eos> - No he doesn't. - Yes, he does. Hey!
Yeah. But we're, we're gonna fight this. We're gonna get the best treatment and I'm gonna take off work and help you and my mom can come stay with us.<eos> - Right, but I think that...<eos> - It'll be okay.<eos> We need...<eos> I can't pull up, Christ!<eos> Did the doctor tell you about the su*ival rate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but, you know, we're gonna beat this.<eos> We're gonna beat this. We will.<eos> How you doing?
Didn't your own mother believe in them?<eos> Don't say no, because I heard her.<eos> You heard her?<eos> Fiddle-faddle, fiddle-faddle.<eos> Right!<eos> First things first.<eos> Let me slip into something more comfortable.<eos> That's better.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> How did you...
- Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Arthur, but with all due respect, I'm--<eos> You're honored and thrilled to lend that Bianca Piper magic?<eos> You wanna do your thing and put some stuff in the words and make it pop?<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> "No, you didn't. I didn't say--"<eos> Yes, you did. And thank--<eos> "No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> You did.
- I don't know where Toby is.<eos> - Come dance with us.<eos> Do you think he didn't come?<eos> - Party pooper.<eos> - No, no, guys, I don't dance.<eos> Come on, B. Come on, B.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> Come on, you dance.<eos> You do.
Did any of these people know where they stood in the social hierarchy?<eos> Cool socks.<eos> Really dig them.<eos> I wanna make out with your face.<eos> Good, because my face wants you to make out with it.<eos> Socks?<eos> They...<eos> What the...?<eos> I never knew why I couldn't talk to Toby.<eos> NOW I did.
Sweet moves, Canada.<eos> Hey, Megan.<eos> You all right?<eos> Really lost your head out there.<eos> I got to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - How we doing, sport?
Excuse me.<eos> Women... who needs 'em?<eos> - I'm an idiot, and I owe you a huge apology.<eos> You're pissed. I get it.<eos> Can we just...<eos> I'm not pissed, all right?<eos> If you want to go date the rock star, that's fine.<eos> You want to go hang with the cool crowd, whatever.<eos> - But I just want you to know that...<eos> - I don't.
- I think it's awesome.<eos> - I think it's pretty awesome.<eos> - I think it's awesome that you feel awesome for the last day of school, but I gotta tell you, man, that looks terrible.<eos> Hey, you know what, though? Maybe you should put a shirt on.<eos> Looking like a deranged little ragamuffin with no shirt on.<eos> This is not the kind of parent who disappears without warning.<eos> This is not a mother who abandons her children.<eos> Nina Reiser was president of her school's Parent-Teacher Association.<eos> She chaperoned field trips.<eos> She did the class laundry.
Well, I don't spend that much time thinking about Siefert's face.<eos> Assaulting an officer?<eos> Where the hell were you and Bumpy yesterday?<eos> You spin your chain like that?<eos> - I do it when I'm anxious. You're making me anxious.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because I caught the case.<eos> Morales put me on it.<eos> Of course he did.
I mean it. Go home.<eos> I can't.<eos> 9/11 was just the beginning.<eos> Protect your home, please.<eos> Protect your family.<eos> Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein... they have Anthrax now.<eos> Bump.<eos> What is it?<eos> You said you had a lead on Marzin.<eos> - We do. - "We"?
Roger that.<eos> Oh!<eos> Well hello there.<eos> A very good afternoon to you, Officer.<eos> Friends!<eos> I was just...<eos> I was immersed in a game of bridge.<eos> Do you play?<eos> Sir, did you try to start your plane again?<eos> Yes, I did.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I... I just wanted to give your drawing back.<eos> Oh, you didn't like it?<eos> No, no I did.
Thank you, man.<eos> - Thank you so much for...<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, now that the educational portion of the day is over, let's get to the fun stuff.<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> - No, you said a day. Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - We agreed to it, Samantha.<eos> - Yes, he did!
- Thank you so much for...<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, now that the educational portion of the day is over, let's get to the fun stuff.<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> - No, you said a day. Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - We agreed to it, Samantha.<eos> - Yes, he did!<eos> - Yes, he did.
Okay- Daddy' will you tell me the story about how I was born?<eos> Okay-<eos> Well' I thought it would be a good idea to videotape your mom giving birth.<eos> I was saying, "Push harder, push harder," and she gave me a look, like... You know that look Mommy gives, like...<eos> "You're in big trouble."<eos> And then I came out?<eos> Then you came out, yep.<eos> And then they spanked me?<eos> Well, they spank all little babies 'cause they're trying to get them to cry.<eos> - But she didn't?
Then more doctors came rushing in, and they brought in more machines and... The nurse said, "You might want to turn that video camera off."<eos> And then your Dad looked at me and said,<eos> "You need to talk to her.<eos> You need to tell her to breathe because she knows your voice,"<eos> "Loud."<eos> -"Say it to her."<eos> - So I started yelling,<eos> "Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?
"You need to talk to her.<eos> You need to tell her to breathe because she knows your voice,"<eos> "Loud."<eos> -"Say it to her."<eos> - So I started yelling,<eos> "Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And then you did.
- What?<eos> - They called me a slut.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Hello?<eos> Do you remember that or not?<eos> Petra, I'm sorry.<eos> It was sixth grade, I didn't know what I was doing, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I probably didn't have any titties to whisper to anyway.<eos> Nobody did.
And...<eos> I'm sorry for killing Lorelei.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, what am I supposed to say to that?<eos> I don't know, Dag.<eos> I'm trying my best here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, maybe you could admit that Lorelei was sort of a raging bitch.<eos> Yeah, I mean, she was a little bit of a bitch, but I really liked her.<eos> I did.
I'm completely cheesed.<eos> Speaking from our Empire's oldest capital city, war-battered, but never for one moment daunted or dismayed,<eos> I ask you to join me in that act of thanksgiving.<eos> So far?<eos> Very good.<eos> Full of character and sincerity.<eos> - Awfully impressive.<eos> - Oh, you really think so?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - We all do.
- Sure.<eos> I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form.<eos> - Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.<eos> - Ok. In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you.<eos> So...<eos> Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's... things, you cannot tell me, but... I also know there's a story here.. and I think it's an important story.<eos> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore... they're broke, they don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
Joe, I think that the language is going to be so important here.<eos> We can't sanitize this, just saying 'molest' isn't enough.<eos> People need to know what actually happened.<eos> - We should probably get these to-go. - Right.<eos> Geoghan shows up, and my mom, you know she's... She's thrilled.<eos> And... this was like God showing up, you know?<eos> Sure, right.<eos> So what happened then?<eos> You really wanna hear this shit?<eos> Yeah, yeah Patrick, I do.
- Right, 90 priests.<eos> - Is that possible?<eos> From a metric standpoint. Yes.<eos> That would certainly be in line with my findings.<eos> Hello?<eos> 90 fucking priests?<eos> In Boston?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.<eos> - Maybe they do.
Don't you have a job to go to? It's my day of rest.<eos> Animals don't get sick on Sunday?<eos> It's the Lord's day.<eos> He's got them covered.<eos> Play nice, you two.<eos> I'm not playing anything.<eos> She can't mind her own business.<eos> Only because I care.<eos> You just have nothing better to do.<eos> -Yes, I do.
- No.<eos> - Yes<eos> I said no.<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> Rory, get up.<eos> Someone spitting.<eos> - How did you know I wasn't dead?<eos> - We didn't.
Hey.<eos> Wait up.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Wait till I sober up.<eos> We'll dropped our way and hit Danny's.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know you want pancakes.<eos> - No, I don't.
I need you to take a look at something.<eos> - Eddie owes me money.<eos> - How much?<eos> 500.<eos> But I take 450 for cash.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - 300.<eos> Half now, half when I've helped you.<eos> Two.<eos> Yeah, done.
Can't it just be fun?<eos> Mr. Walker, please tell me you can do better than "fun."<eos> Anything's possible.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> If I was walking down the street, and I saw some kid with a jet pack fly over me, I'd believe anything's possible.<eos> I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
No way!<eos> - Let me out of this car!<eos> - Stop yelling!<eos> - Let me out now! - No!<eos> I will not!<eos> I gave you my very last pin, young lady, and I am not about to let it go to waste.<eos> What do you mean your last pin?<eos> Wait, that place I saw...<eos> - It exists?<eos> - Of course it does.
Don't waste your time.<eos> ...And now let's play Piñata!<eos> Go right, go right...<eos> Well done, Francesco!<eos> Good evening!<eos> - Thanks for the table.<eos> - You're welcome!<eos> That's the guy who gave us the table. Come on!<eos> Let's perch over here.<eos> When did we last do this?
My God, Bauer.<eos> There's no network.<eos> No connection to other facilities.<eos> Just us and some computer telling us that we're not alone.<eos> You're not alone, my love.<eos> It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.<eos> Bauer, are you there?<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> If the system is a lie, automated... how do we know if there's anyone else out there?<eos> We don't.
I wanted you to catch the knife.<eos> There was no way I could know.<eos> You're the one who did it. You're the one who knew.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> No, I'm not mad.<eos> I think I'm crazy.<eos> Me too.<eos> And also, I want you.<eos> I mean, really.<eos> I really do.
I know.<eos> It's so stupid.<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> You know, he spit on my face.<eos> What?<eos> That's not the worst of it.<eos> He made fun of my nose.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I like how the nose looks.<eos> - You do?
I guess I just don't get it.<eos> Well, that's pretty obvious.<eos> So the truth is, making a movie is really... it's a strange process, you know?<eos> Always requires some sort of degree of weirdness.<eos> Is that why you took off your top?<eos> I took off my top because...<eos> Well, 'cause I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.<eos> I've never done a nude scene before, so... what the hell, right?<eos> Did Sally tell you that this was... this is a very important article for me?<eos> No, she did.
I've never done a nude scene before, so... what the hell, right?<eos> Did Sally tell you that this was... this is a very important article for me?<eos> No, she did.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They say I'm in a bit of a... I don't know, precarious position right now career-wise. And that I have to...<eos> That I'm not stable.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> Thank you, but I do.<eos> Obviously, I do.
- Oh, it's fine.<eos> - Would you like me to sign...<eos> - Baxter, Suzanne.<eos> - Suzanne Crosby?<eos> - Oh, yeah, you left a message.<eos> - Yeah, hi. - How's it going?<eos> - We went to high school together.<eos> - Yeah, it's okay<eos> - if you don't remember me.<eos> - No, I do, I do.
- Oh, God, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> Slipping back.<eos> And you wanna know something?<eos> This is all Caleb.<eos> All Caleb.<eos> That's why Mom was crying when she left, she didn't wanna go.<eos> Why else would she leave those paintings for us to find?<eos> Well, she... she didn't.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Blake.<eos> I want you to know that I respect what you and your dad have.<eos> And I know that your mom moving in has to feel like a pretty big step.<eos> But I'm never gonna try to change what you have with him or take his place.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, how come you never had kids?<eos> Oh, I did.
- Yeah.<eos> How does your family feel about you leaving?<eos> They're happy I'm finally getting my life together. Yeah.<eos> Oh, wow!<eos> That's an extreme transformation!<eos> That's incredible.<eos> Can I keep this?<eos> I'm going to need to keep this.<eos> How long have you felt robotic?<eos> I don't.
I'm curious to know more about her.<eos> So, just ask her.<eos> I did.<eos> - And how'd that go?<eos> - Not as anticipated.<eos> On some level, she regrets abandoning her graduate study.<eos> She's proud of her achievement in the field of entertainment gaming. But this does not supplant some imagined ideologized future in which she is a successful roboticist.<eos> Well, that's good info.<eos> She also doesn't like to be touched unexpectedly.<eos> Yeah, most people don't.
Good morning, Anastasia.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better than I deserve.<eos> Did you put me to bed?<eos> You undressed me?<eos> I didn't have much choice.<eos> Where did you sleep?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did we?<eos> We didn't...
Still.<eos> Time waits for no man and all that.<eos> Anyway, all the money's been spent on this, the New Centre for National Security.<eos> So that's C's new digs.<eos> You've met him, have you?<eos> Yesterday. What do we know about him?<eos> Classic Whitehall mandarin.<eos> Wrote a dossier last year on how the double-0 program was obsolete, how drones could do all our dirty work abroad.<eos> Went to school with the Home Secretary.<eos> Of course, he did.
- Clinton Street.<eos> Yeah?<eos> That's on my way home.<eos> Can I walk you?<eos> I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.<eos> So I don't get the wrong idea?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?<eos> You don't know her?<eos> I do.
Maybe I could teach you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me... cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.<eos> So, what do you eat in Ireland?<eos> Just Irish stew?<eos> Not just.<eos> We... So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.<eos> Hey, hey ... - Frankie!<eos> - What?<eos> We don't!
He couldn't possibly be talking about that Syndicate.<eos> Because you assured me that that Syndicate was merely an exercise.<eos> And it was, Prime Minister, I can assure you.<eos> And yet here we have the Central Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Prime Minister, your life is in danger.<eos> I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location.<eos> Sir, does the name Solomon Lane ring a bell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unfortunately, it does.
Give me one second.<eos> Give me a second. Give me a second.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> [THE ROLLING STONES' "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]<eos> [CLEARS THROAT]<eos> A hundred grand.<eos> One hundred thousand.<eos> Yep.<eos> You don't have 100,000.<eos> Yeah, I do.
By whom?<eos> Parties unknown.<eos> Do we have an ally?<eos> Ultron's got an enemy.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
This isn't just about beating him.<eos> It's about whether he's right.<eos> Natasha!<eos> Natasha!<eos> Bruce?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The team is in the city.<eos> It's about to light up. I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.<eos> Yeah. I did.
I was in love with her before I even met her.<eos> These abstract, energetic landscapes... And then I saw her.<eos> Wow.<eos> It was like I'd hit the jackpot.<eos> She was the most generous spirit I'd ever seen, and she was as bright and gorgeous as... The morning.<eos> When you surprised her, she had this--this laugh, this joyous, guttural rumble that came from way down deep inside. You knew you'd done something good.<eos> She was all light, all light.<eos> During times like this, um, nights like this night... I think of her quite a bit.<eos> Did she, uh, pass away?<eos> Yes, she did.
What are you talking about?<eos> That's what they do, don't they?<eos> Devil worshipers?<eos> They kill pregnant ladies and their babies.<eos> You are.<eos> Hey, runner.<eos> Come here.<eos> I don't have it, man.<eos> I tried to scrape it together.<eos> I did, but I just don't.
Of course.<eos> I mean, have I heard of people like that?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I don't mean people like that.<eos> I just mean two people who fall in love with each other.<eos> Say, a boy and a boy out of the blue.<eos> I don't know anyone like that.<eos> But I'll tell you this, there's always some reason for it in the background.<eos> So you don't think it could just... happen to somebody, to anybody?<eos> No, I don't.
That's the way Barry is.<eos> He's a negotiator.<eos> ultimately, he needs you.<eos> He's buying HSN.<eos> It's all about HSN now, and he wants you to come with him.<eos> He needs you.<eos> You're going to be very big over there.<eos> That's what's going to happen.<eos> But, you didn't hear it from me, right?<eos> No, I sure didn't.
Okay, everyone, listen up.<eos> I know this is the last day of school... But first, before we leave... we need to finish picking our partners for this year's summer pen-pal project.<eos> When I draw a name, stand if you want to be their partner.<eos> Here we go.<eos> The next name is...<eos> Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> I do!
See how I'm doing it.<eos> Hand, leg...<eos> One more time.<eos> Lower your shoulder.<eos> Hand up.<eos> Very good.<eos> "Announce-ment...<eos> All-Soviet..."<eos> Teacher, guess what Jaan found!<eos> - My grandfather did.
Why are you here, Kushal?<eos> And please explain the hat.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You like the place?<eos> I think it could be really great. Yes, I do.<eos> - How clever of Sonny to buy it.<eos> - Except he didn't buy it.<eos> You speak for me?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
So you can do it when I'm not.<eos> - Evening all.<eos> - Good evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.<eos> - In before midnight.<eos> - Only two customers.<eos> I finished my shift early.<eos> I felt like being alone.<eos> Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.<eos> Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.<eos> And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
Just the four of us, like it used to be.<eos> As friends.<eos> I can't, I have to work.<eos> In the Mercury?<eos> That's not until 10, is it?<eos> We'll eat at half seven and you go after.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Come on, Sylvie.<eos> - You know me, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Ah, technically, that's more of a blink.<eos> - That's a blink.<eos> - You can't wink, can you?<eos> Of course I can wink.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me do this.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me hold this open. I'll hold this open.<eos> Now do it.
Johnny Li, Yan Lin, Samuel Wu.<eos> Li just got out of prison two months ago.<eos> Yan and his mother are both junkies.<eos> Wu runs a chop shop.<eos> Hardly commodities speculators.<eos> They're fronts?<eos> Proxies?<eos> So how do they communicate?<eos> How do they connect up to our actor?<eos> They don't.
Don't overthink it.<eos> Or do you have your reasons?<eos> Could it be that you don't want to get married?<eos> Say so now!<eos> You can still turn back.<eos> I just feel foggy.<eos> The stale air around here.<eos> Who doesn't have their doubts?<eos> Do you love your fiancée?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Right.<eos> My friend Jillian, her dad owns the land now, and when things between my husband and I went south, she was nice enough to put us up here, but she told me that nobody ever comes out here.<eos> Oh, so... So the boys, is that... Do you have legal custody, or is that...<eos> I do, yes.<eos> It's temporary, though.<eos> Well, look, you... You're welcome to stay awhile and look around, - whatever you need.<eos> - No, it's getting late.<eos> You don't want to creep around a murder scene in the dark, huh?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> In all honesty, I do not.
Clint always ate first.<eos> Well, I'm not Clint, so go ahead, eat.<eos> So, were you a cop or something?<eos> Oh, yeah. A sheriff's deputy.<eos> So you saw dead bodies and stuff?<eos> - Zachary.<eos> - What?<eos> Cops see dead bodies.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I will not put myself through that.<eos> What would our friends think?<eos> What would the community think?<eos> We'd be the laughingstock of this entire city.<eos> I can't just shoot someone like an animal.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've taken it, but the more I think about it I don't think he has more.<eos> Oh, he does.
I'm a Legacy.<eos> Junk.<eos> Junk.<eos> My mom was a Bella.<eos> Your mother is Katherine Junk?<eos> Who?<eos> Only the top bitch of the 1981 Bellas.<eos> She pioneered the syncopated booty shake.<eos> And word is she has a five-octave vocal range.<eos> Yep, still does.
So that's a "no," then?<eos> Because with the wink, and that's what...<eos> It's 100% no!<eos> I want it!<eos> Give me!<eos> Dax.<eos> I swear, if this kid was not my nephew...<eos> Hey, I know you're crazy busy, but have you had a chance to check out those demos?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
I thought it'd be better in the open air.<eos> At least you're not in a box.<eos> You know, you should have kept this moist.<eos> It might scar now.<eos> I know. They told me.<eos> What you listening to?<eos> What are you listening to?<eos> What do you think?<eos> - You don't like it, do you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Bashkim says you have to count.<eos> - OK!<eos> One, two, three...<eos> Cekié!<eos> Cekic', come!<eos> You're a Serb!<eos> Please accept my condolences...<eos> I must go.<eos> No!<eos> Do the count again.
619!<eos> Thanks.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Daniel Bryrock, have a flyer.<eos> No, thanks, Cenastone.<eos> I don't want your flyer.<eos> - Please, please.<eos> I insist. - I said, "No, I don't".<eos> - But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!

- Does that mean what I think?<eos> - Did you play with his chicken and eggs?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't.<eos> Ha-ha-ha. Did you give him a pirate key?<eos> What is a pirate key?<eos> I don't even know what that is. That's horrifying.<eos> Well, it depends on who the pirate is.<eos> - It didn't work out on the date. - Mm.<eos> It never does.
You just missed him.<eos> He just went up the cliffs with Randy and I don't know, a couple of others.<eos> Want a pretzel?<eos> No. Thank you.<eos> No.<eos> I'm completely lost.<eos> Am I anywhere near this address?<eos> You're looking for Clint Coburn?<eos> - Yeah, you know him?<eos> - Yeah, who doesn't?
- Because it's a fact, Jack.<eos> - It's a fact. Is it a fact?<eos> Like the fact that you're a triathlete.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Here's a good idea.<eos> Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the bar and we'll see who gets there first?<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what a triathlon is.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You do, do you?
By your side. Trust me.<eos> Now tell me everything.<eos> I want to know.<eos> The launch is scheduled for December 4th.<eos> It's a one day trip.<eos> So you'll be home on time for Christmas then, Mr.Spaceman?<eos> Guy?<eos> Guy?<eos> You find it?<eos> Yeah I did.
Home.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> The only way for me to do that is you help me.<eos> I cannot help you.<eos> Is that cannot or will not?<eos> You are the only on that can help you.<eos> It's your choice, Commander.<eos> But I don't know how to fix this!<eos> You must.<eos> Well I don't!
No, no, no, he was a human. - Who?<eos> One of us?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't see him in here.<eos> Everything else is kind of a blur.<eos> I just remember waking up right here, and there was... Some kind of gas.<eos> I think that we were all drugged.<eos> Does anybody else remember anything?<eos> Come on. Anybody!<eos> Yeah! Yeah. I do.
- Yeah, what, now you need a green card to be fucking abducted?<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> I mean, he shouldn't even be here.<eos> What does that matter?<eos> Ask him if he was in the country legally.<eos> Ask him.<eos> No.<eos> Ah, see? Come on.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Sure it does!
8, 7, 5, 4... 3, 2, 1.<eos> No!<eos> - The fuck? - Damn it!<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - We screwed up.<eos> - All right, let's try it again. - It won't work!<eos> They thought of everything!<eos> Did you vote for the person to your right or your left?<eos> I did right. This way.
I'm going home to them.<eos> Don't worry... I'm not voting for you.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Yeah, We're...<eos> We're gonna get out of here, man.<eos> - Yeah, sure we are.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> No, you come on, man.<eos> He knows the truth.<eos> We all do.
Don't you see what they're doing here?<eos> They just killed her to get the majority back in their favor.<eos> They knew that she was on our side. - What side?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, there aren't any sides here.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So you never voted for the two of them?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You don't know who's voting for who in here.<eos> None of us do.
He's talking about getting r-I-d of the k-I-d sooner rather than later.<eos> I think she can spell. We just need to get this over with.<eos> Rip the band-aid off.<eos> Why drag it out?<eos> - You're outnumbered, man.<eos> - He's right.<eos> It's over.<eos> You want to live, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I don't...
What?<eos> What is your husband's name?<eos> He already said his name.<eos> That's right.<eos> When?<eos> The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.

Alright, look - get this issued, right?<eos> But not to the press just yet, alright?<eos> Not 'til I know what's going on.<eos> This didn't happen because of a bad blowjob!<eos> And find out who THAT is!<eos> Thank you for what you did.<eos> I know [...] be traumatized for the rest of her life, but... thank you.<eos> Those bastards! deserved it. Every bullet.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> I didn't.
The job was completed.<eos> You got the requested goods.<eos> Yeah, but you don't just disappear like you did, Bradley.<eos> We'd looked, and we couldn't find you.<eos> We never had that happened before, and that worried us.<eos> Who knew what you might be doing?<eos> You did alter conscience of us, buddy.<eos> You became a liability.<eos> You know how this is gonna end, don't you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
All right!<eos> Let's go to karaoke now, yeah?<eos> I better get going.<eos> I have to go work hard.<eos> Ageha!<eos> Hey!<eos> What's her problem?<eos> So that's why she took so long in the bathroom.<eos> Mr . Make.<eos> Who did this to Mr. Seki?
- Oh, uh, today's really just to go over schedules.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> If that's cool.<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> Uh, I have never, uh, been interviewed for a magazine.<eos> Heya.<eos> Hey, LeBron.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt. Did I leave my sunglasses here?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Did you?
- When I'm with Matthew.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> - That's it.<eos> That's it!<eos> Okay, well that just explained everything.<eos> That's-you haven't had an orgasm in a year?<eos> Come on, that's bullshit.<eos> Not even when you masturbate?<eos> Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!<eos> You don't mast-- Why not?
I shouldn't be yelling at you. - Sir, your watch.<eos> - Keep the watch.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> Franny, I was just thinking.<eos> And?<eos> - Why do I just wanna strangle him? - What?<eos> Don't get me wrong, I like him.<eos> I do, but...
Even if I wanted to, it's impossible.<eos> The branch doesn't have the liquidity and I can't do transfer it unless I'm in the office.<eos> You can't work from outside precisely to avoid situations like this.<eos> Don't try to trick me.<eos> I've been working on this for quite some time.<eos> Today's Friday and the end of the month.<eos> There's plenty of payroll and pension money at the bank.<eos> 67.547 from your account, without arousing any suspicion.<eos> I don't have that much money in my account.<eos> You don't?
Okay.<eos> Where are all the other patients?<eos> There are no other patients, I'm afraid.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> We're not a regular hospital.<eos> And you're not a regular patient.<eos> Explain.<eos> Do you remember any details from your last mission?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
It's not your fault.<eos> I mean, I know you try, but he's tough to get to know.<eos> He doesn't let many people in.<eos> Look, you don't have to be worried.<eos> It's just a one-time experience, it's no big deal.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not like I love him or anything.<eos> I mean, not that you do.<eos> I love Monroe.<eos> I do.
Good.<eos> I think we're safe.<eos> Why is this happening?<eos> I need you, Minnie.<eos> I need you to take care of me now.<eos> I love you.<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't love me?<eos> I do.
It concerns me a little bit.<eos> Oh, good morning, Nikola.<eos> I thought you weren't allowed to write anymore. No, just not allowed to put my name on it, or get paid.<eos> No.<eos> How does that work?<eos> Not very well.<eos> It's funny.<eos> It's breezy and romantic.<eos> Who wrote it?<eos> You did, old boy.
They stole the atom bomb. They didn't steal it off a fucking camera truck.<eos> So look, we bought a gorilla suit.<eos> We gotta use it.<eos> Well. So, you had five jobs. Mmm-hmm.<eos> And now we got them and now you got none? Oh, now I'm free to get five more jobs and five more writers.<eos> And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.<eos> To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business.<eos> Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.<eos> So who wants to write a gorilla movie?<eos> Who doesn't?
He had a difference of opinion with the owners.<eos> So, I'm the new guy.<eos> Okay, clean away, new guy.<eos> You don't look that old, by the way. I mean, I wasn't worried because you look old.<eos> Yeah, well, you know you always got to assume the worst. Don't worry about it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, but can I ask you a favor?<eos> Hey, you see anything?<eos> I do not.
Living together is supposed to be a trial run, and I got to tell you, I think we are failing it.<eos> Thank you for finally saying something truthful.<eos> Where's that guy been? Huh? Where have you been?<eos> You've been completely aloof and totally remote and distant.<eos> It's like I don't even know you anymore.<eos> I feel like you're just silently judging me.<eos> What do you even want anymore?<eos> Do you even want this wedding?<eos> Do you even want to marry me?<eos> Maybe I don't!
Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Jimmy, this is... this is your Uncle Vian.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you coming in?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - He's just coming by to say hi. - Okay.<eos> Mom, I think he wanted to come in.<eos> Don't you have some homework that you should be doing?<eos> I already did it.
Maybe you have difficulty concentrating.<eos> You may have S.O.S. Switched On Syndrome.<eos> ...a further 43 degrees along this orbit that the hoist probe will begin the 110 minute descent into TK-14's atmosphere bombs dropped for the span of 28 days and obliterated 99.6% of usable arid land on the Earth's surface.<eos> And event that changed the course of human kind forever, and now known as the great war.<eos> ...of the two tracts of land that survived the great war. The Peninsula still stands 44 degrees west of the Collective.<eos> And is a wild primitive area, containing empty, dilapidated buildings and little is known of the primitive nature of the Peninsula's inhabitants.<eos> The defects living there are ruled by emotion and base desires. An ancient vestige of our past.<eos> This image shows Equis 12 leaving Earth's orbit on last week's interstellar mission.<eos> Who wrote the text for this feature?<eos> Me, I did.
Have a seat.<eos> Shannon, proceed.<eos> Um, you may have noticed that I've been acting sort of weird lately.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, taking a lot of personal days and stuff.<eos> Well, the truth is, is...<eos> I've been seeing some doctors.<eos> Okay, this is taking too long. What Coach Beiste is trying to say is that she has cancer.<eos> - You have cancer?<eos> ! - No, I don't. - What?
Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Help us.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Alright.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did you find the keys?<eos> Yes. Yes, I did.
What do you know about my experience?<eos> More than most.<eos> It's my job as Mayor.<eos> And it's the kind of power that your new position affords, as well.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, Mr. Mayor, as the new Sheriff, I really look forward to working with you in the future.<eos> Best of luck on your first day.<eos> This is just for a few days until your dad finishes his case, all right?<eos> Try not to draw too much attention.<eos> I never do.
Doesn't seem that way to me!<eos> He must've made twenty decisions in two hours...<eos> He moved out, He found an apartment He spoke on the phone to a divorce lawyer.<eos> It does not really seem like a confused man to me.<eos> You keep on saying to me that this woman is ugly and insignificant.<eos> So what is it that Julian sees in her that...<eos> He didn't see in me?<eos> Now. How should I know?<eos> Because you said that Mick asked him!<eos> - Did I? - Yes.
Hold on just a second...<eos> I see... I think I see.<eos> It's George!<eos> George Nesbitt?<eos> - Okay...<eos> - George Nesbitt?<eos> Hey George.<eos> Hey Bruce.<eos> How'd it go with John?<eos> Where you doing?
Gracie, full autopsy, please.<eos> Hey, come on, man.<eos> There's no need to cut this man's body.<eos> Why does an apparently healthy favourite son of this city... become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?<eos> Cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why.<eos> - Prepare the body, please. - Yes.<eos> I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just...<eos> You're asked to leave it alone. But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.
"Because I like you, " she said.<eos> "And I don't want anything from you."<eos> You smell nice.<eos> Like morning.<eos> Don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whatever you did... you're too smart to be in here.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> You have a first name?<eos> I sure do.
Come on, Billy.<eos> Come on, calm down.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> No one's gonna care.<eos> Come on, Billy.<eos> Let me go!<eos> I still gotta take you back, Billy.<eos> You don't know what goes on in that place.<eos> Sure I do.
Have you ever lived with anyone before?<eos> Um, romantically?<eos> No.<eos> I haven't really had any long-term relationships to speak of.<eos> Um, it's kind of hard to plan a future with someone when you don't know if you're going to have a future.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> You think that's all it was, though?<eos> Did you maybe have a fear of commitment?<eos> Maybe we both do.
What he say?<eos> Well, there's good news and bad news.<eos> Okay.<eos> The bad news is, he may have to stay in Tokyo a few months more.<eos> And?<eos> And... I told him how well you've been doing.<eos> And he wonders if maybe... you're ready to start spending some time out of the house.<eos> Really?<eos> Only if you feel ready.<eos> I do.
Like from a .22 to a .45.<eos> Look, there are parts of me that want a lot of attention and think I'm really great... and want other people to see it.<eos> I think that's one of the ways you and I are sort of alike, you know?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, uh...<eos> All right.<eos> Fuck.<eos> David.<eos> I'm not so sure you want to be me.<eos> I don't.
Not like your mom with her wand.<eos> I mean, one swoosh from that thing and you could probably have whatever features you wanted.<eos> She doesn't use the wand anymore.<eos> She believes the real magic is in the books.<eos> And not the spell books, regular books with history and stuff.<eos> What a rip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, she used magic on cinderella, who wasn't even her real daughter.<eos> Doesn't she love you?<eos> Well, of course she does.
- No, no, no.<eos> Okay. Easy on the blush.<eos> I don't want to scare him away.<eos> Not that I could.<eos> Please.<eos> My mom taught me how to apply blush before I could talk.<eos> Always use upward strokes.<eos> My mom was never really big on makeup tips.<eos> - I never had a sister.<eos> - Well, now you do.
It was a demotion.<eos> A job?<eos> That's why you're doing this?<eos> You do not get real work.<eos> Nobody speaks to you.<eos> You are there, but you are not.<eos> Without job i cannot take care of my family.<eos> So you come here instead...<eos> You do not understand my culture. No.<eos> No, I don't.
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.<eos> You got five of these light thingamajigs one and two-thirds are Chuck's.<eos> How many Danishes? Six Danishes?<eos> - You can have all the Danish you want.<eos> - No, no. They're Chuck's Danishes.<eos> And Chuck isn't greedy, so he'll just take two plus $17 million.<eos> In that ballpark.<eos> I mean, we'll know once we get the accountants poking around here.<eos> Until then, no more penny ante cheques designed to make it look like Chuck still works here.<eos> He doesn't.
We all are, Mason.<eos> It's to make Violet feel better because her husband has been so awful to her.<eos> Then shouldn't HE be paying?<eos> Where's Violet?<eos> We've been waiting ages.<eos> Yes, and I can't stay much longer.<eos> Why?<eos> Where do you have to go?<eos> I do have a life outside of all of you.<eos> No, you don't.
He looked out the window. The unconscious bodies of the captured loners were lying on the wet ground.<eos> Thank God they wore those waterproof ponchos. He thought.<eos> -Room... 115 two loners...two extra days<eos> Room 272.<eos> One loner. One extra day.<eos> -Hello. I'm the hotel manager and this gentleman is my partner.<eos> We'd like to welcome you.<eos> You're one of the lucky ones. You have one of our superior rooms, which means you have a view.<eos> Did you read the panphlet?<eos> -Yes, I did.
What are you doing in there?<eos> You're not gonna need that. Why not?<eos> We're glamping.<eos> Um, won't we be cold, though?<eos> I brought double-down comforters and a curling iron and blow dryer that plug into the car.<eos> So we're set. - For what?<eos> - I... don't understand the question.<eos> Don't you think we're a little far from the kids?<eos> Not too far we can't keep an eye on them. But just far enough that they don't have to hear us. Oh.<eos> Doing what?
OK, yeah, it is real.<eos> But Moms don't know, and if you tell anyone, I will kill you. - OK.<eos> - I mean it, don't go tattling.<eos> I won't.<eos> But, um... how're you gonna go swimming?<eos> You're gonna hang ten on the pond?<eos> Mom, some of us don't want to get skin cancer, right?<eos> Yeah, but there is something called sunscreen, you know.<eos> Did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens that show up in people's livers?<eos> No, I didn't.
He did nothing but talk about you the other night.<eos> Yeah, that's not all he did.<eos> Ouch!<eos> Bitch!<eos> Nothing happened but a little rubbing.<eos> He came and then we passed out.<eos> Admit it, he makes your pussy wet.<eos> He does, yeah he do.<eos> Come on, admit it, you like him.<eos> All right, yeah I do.
Let the ruiner have him.<eos> Lame.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> No...<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you mean "we"?<eos> Cuz you know...<eos> you never had him.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, you did.
Lame.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> No...<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you mean "we"?<eos> Cuz you know...<eos> you never had him.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You did!
A shoe?<eos> - That was your evidence?<eos> - Well, I'm not done yet.<eos> Okay, that is significantly weirder and Zabeth has been acting strangely.<eos> Agreed, but what really convinced me...<eos> Poor, poor, Elaine.<eos> All ginger and no joy.<eos> - I don't...<eos> I don't mind.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Do you...<eos> Philippe?<eos> I knew it!<eos> Philippe Petit.<eos> Daredevil wire walker.<eos> I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes!<eos> -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
- You're a diamond!<eos> Wearsomethingright.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You know, evening clothes.<eos> - What do you mean, evening clothes?<eos> I wear the same clothes morning and evening Bo- the clothes I got you.<eos> - No, no, alright.<eos> -I loveyou.<eos> AndI knowyouloveme,too.<eos> - Yes, I do.
We're not going to say anything.<eos> Annie, they're here.<eos> Annie!<eos> She's driving? ! That's, uh,...<eos> Progressive.<eos> Be good.<eos> Annie.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I'm just really glad you're here.<eos> Paulie, how ya doing, man?
And you're...<eos> Oh, just wandering the streets and eavesdropping on lovely young ladies.<eos> Miss May, did I hear you correctly saying there's, uh... something not quite right with Annie's house?<eos> I'd be surprised if there wasn't, I mean, with that kind of past.<eos> That house probably has more demons than the Book of Revelations.<eos> Is it true what happened up there?<eos> Running the Dagmars out of town?<eos> Oh, it's true. Hand to the Lord.<eos> Because I saw a family there last night.<eos> You did?
Hey, do you guys need a lift?<eos> It's Ronny!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Get in the truck!<eos> Come on, go!<eos> You saved our lives!<eos> My white baby boy!<eos> You saved our lives!<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I didn't.
- Honey, he doesn't mind.<eos> - No, I mean, stick your hand in there - and really, really pull it.<eos> - Daddy.<eos> Honey.<eos> Pull, pull, pull.<eos> - Yeah! - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. See?<eos> That's going nowhere. - Daddy, really? - That hair is locked in.<eos> You have the stuff?<eos> Well, your mother does. - Oh.
You know what? I'm still... I'm pretty confused about this Linda person and who she is to you.<eos> She's my friend, like, you know, you're friends with David and you guys have your whole charter-school venture.<eos> And we have spent every Saturday as family day for the last five years.<eos> - Is it so horrible if we just go our own way for once?<eos> Who's ready to party?<eos> ! Did you get the bouncy castle?<eos> I will be back, okay?<eos> Okay. I'll see you at some point.<eos> ... that's the silliest thing I ever heard in my whole life.<eos> Of course I did.
You have said yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was his bed you were in this morning?<eos> - No, boss.<eos> - I will assume it was.<eos> And I will assume that you love him.<eos> Yes, boss.<eos> - Do you think he loves you?<eos> - I know it.<eos> He does not.
If a convict strikes a soldier for no good reason, yes.<eos> But when the convict has every reason, when the soldier deserved to be struck, that is different, surely.<eos> It is not.<eos> It can never be right for a convict to strike a soldier?<eos> Never.<eos> If the soldier is buggering the convict?<eos> Unlikely to happen.<eos> If the soldier is stabbing the convict with his bayonet?<eos> That, too, is unlikely to happen.<eos> ~ But if it did?
No word about Anna.<eos> Not yet.<eos> - Did you see where she went? - Mnh-mnh, no.<eos> But runners always head to the main road.<eos> Adam.<eos> Oh, hello...<eos> Pepper.<eos> Pepper.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Chet's screwing me.<eos> Sorry, Quinn, but I kind of feel like everybody knows that.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I mean... he's trying to say that I stalked him.<eos> Why the hell would he say that?<eos> - Because I'm suing him.<eos> - What are you suing him for?<eos> Because I created this... "Everlasting."<eos> - You did?
Well what was that about?<eos> You literally held me prisoner.<eos> You suck at poker, Shia, so I didn't want to put you in the position of having to bluff.<eos> Listen, the police... they ruled Mary's death a suicide, so there's not gonna be any more questions.<eos> Shia: Really?<eos> Is that all you care about?<eos> Getting away with it?<eos> Don't either of you feel guilty?<eos> - Those girls know what they signed on for.<eos> - No, they don't.
- Maybe.<eos> "Maybe," yeah. Go, then.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go.<eos> Do it.<eos> Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
The other one.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um... you talk to the girls when they have a problem and stuff, right?<eos> I knew it.<eos> Grace.<eos> I saw her tear out of here with an entire Entenmann's cake and a fork.<eos> No, it's not...<eos> It's not Grace. She doesn't really want to talk about it.<eos> - But you do?
He's late, isn't he? No.<eos> And it's none of your business.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I need a favor. - A favor?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Really, what kind of favor?<eos> What... hey, that is not for you.<eos> - You forgot the basil.<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> - I did, didn't I? - Yep.
Why is there a police officer in my server room?<eos> What?<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> I'll take the floor.<eos> You can't sleep on the floor.<eos> Sure I can.<eos> I spent a month in the outback with nothing more than a blanket.<eos> Haven't you heard? They build us tough in Australia.<eos> You never told me why you moved there.<eos> No, I didn't.
They're all liars.<eos> So delicate... You know I have to kill you...<eos> I need someone...<eos> God.<eos> He's been watching me all along.<eos> ... taste your fear.<eos> You're perfect, the one...<eos> It's like some sick and twisted love letter to you.<eos> They don't love you.<eos> Not like I do.
Yeah, totally.<eos> Just be yourself.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> I have a sneaking suspicion that you're gonna have a great day.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - 21.<eos> So Jessica tells me that you hail from Pittsburgh.<eos> - What part?<eos> - Polish Hill. - Do you know it?<eos> - No, I- - I don't.
You told me that a measure of a man is in the moment when he is confronted by himself.<eos> By opposing voices in his head, both arguing that they are right, but one has to be wrong.<eos> To know the difference in that moment, that is what makes an officer.<eos> What makes a man.<eos> Well, I see the difference here, sir.<eos> I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did. And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.
I c-can't drink this.<eos> Well, I heard there's a sale at Foley's.<eos> We can't buy dresses for a society gala at Foley's.<eos> We need designer gowns.<eos> The only difference between Oleg Cassini and the sale rack at Foley's is the price tag.<eos> Not true.<eos> It's the fabric and the tailoring.<eos> I saved a Balenciaga from my cotillion days.<eos> I'll get it and I'll show you.<eos> Of course she did.
And according to this, you'll even have a little left over for a rainy day.<eos> Every day's a rainy day without Gus.<eos> Go to the jewelry store.<eos> That $75 something or other, my guess is it's for you.<eos> A diamond pin?<eos> For your 20th, it's meant to be China.<eos> Men should never pick out jewelry alone.<eos> Gus already has something kind of like this.<eos> Wally does, too.<eos> All the guys do.
It was low and guttural, not like her voice, which was soft, higher-pitched.<eos> God, that's just horrible.<eos> And then what?<eos> That was it, really.<eos> When I got there, she'd gone.<eos> And Kerouac was looking down this hole.<eos> A fissure.<eos> Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it, like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.<eos> D-Do you remember that one in Scotland?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - Yeah.
What's he doing?<eos> Is he smoking again?<eos> Looks like it.<eos> You should get him to shave before the big day too.<eos> - Hello, Geoffrey.<eos> - Hello, Lena.<eos> Hope you've got your speech prepared. I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.<eos> So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.<eos> I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.<eos> I just don't.
This is what it's gonna be like. I mean, you think it's ever gonna be any different than this?<eos> Than what?<eos> Than... than this.<eos> We're gonna be able to work together for a minute, and then we're gonna hurt each other.<eos> And then we'll get over it, and we'll be able to work together, and we're gonna hurt each other again.<eos> It's cyclical. Come on.<eos> It's like a... A wound just heals just enough, and then we rip the scab off of the fucking thing.<eos> It didn't have to go this way, Marty.<eos> - I mean, I really wanted to...<eos> - No, but it did.
Mrs Vandemeyer.<eos> Just passing. Thought I'd say hello.<eos> Mrs Vandemeyer?<eos> Do you want me to break it down?<eos> - It's a pretty sturdy door, James.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> Jane Finn's hairpin.<eos> Where did you learn that trick?<eos> Girl Guides.<eos> Everyone did.
The queen.<eos> - The Queen?<eos> - The queen bee!<eos> Anassa, the queen.<eos> Do you think she hid the recording there?<eos> That's what she was trying to tell us.<eos> She knew we had her book.<eos> Whoever it was that did this had worked it out, too.<eos> Only, they hadn't read my bee book. You didn't, either.<eos> I did, in the end.
Yeah.<eos> Ryan, that man's grief was heartbreaking, but you can't blame yourself for his daughter's death.<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> I know.<eos> How many more people would Joe carroll have killed if you hadn't stopped him?<eos> But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name... Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
Penny?<eos> Right.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> Leonard, I mean, you're not only the love of my life. I mean, you're my best friend, and you've got a friend in me.<eos> You got troubles. I got 'em, too.<eos> There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you.<eos> We stick together, and we can see it through, 'cause... you've got a friend in me.<eos> Is that the song from Toy Story?<eos> He loves that movie.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Only I ask one little thing of you.<eos> Oh, my gosh. Sorry.<eos> What is this?<eos> Is this like a solo contract?<eos> Why do you look so surprised?<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Do you know how many artists take years to get to this place?<eos> Some never do.
Eaten by a bear.<eos> Terrible bad luck, there.<eos> You'd think he would have been fully cognizant of the risks.<eos> Apparently, he liked a drink.<eos> Do you have any idea what he was looking for up here, Or what he might have found, even?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.<eos> Do you think their deaths are connected in any way?<eos> No, I don't.

I'll be lookout.<eos> You can do whatever you want, Q.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Dad, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> "I'm sorry"?<eos> That's completely unacceptable.<eos> I really like him, Dad!<eos> He does not love you!<eos> Yes, he does!
Bye.<eos> I hope you had a great summer.<eos> A great summer away.<eos> I hope you had a great summer.<eos> A great summer away<eos> I still can't believe she hasn't called.<eos> They probably don't have phones in Agloe.<eos> She has a cell.<eos> How do we know that she's even still in Agloe?<eos> I just do.
♪ If I had a heart, I could love you ♪<eos> ♪ If I had a voice, I would sing ♪<eos> ♪ If I had a voice, I would sing ♪<eos> Einar.<eos> Sit down, Kalf.<eos> Will you come with me to Wessex?<eos> No, Earl Ingstad.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't you want to win renown?<eos> Of course I do.
Einar.<eos> Sit down, Kalf.<eos> Will you come with me to Wessex?<eos> No, Earl Ingstad.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't you want to win renown?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But someone has to remain and look after all your territories, and all of your interests here.<eos> I believe you trust me to do this.<eos> I do.
Oh, you little rat.<eos> Oh, you little dickens, you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been coming here. Are you just gonna stand up here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> I've been traveling here.<eos> I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
She can't be that far ahead of us.<eos> It's going to be dark soon.<eos> Where the hell can she be?<eos> I've got a good guess.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Texas.<eos> Please don't! No!<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Please don't!

So I just got a text from Evita.<eos> Oh, more brilliance from your brilliant professor?<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you found someone so brilliant.<eos> Oh, go like that. You've got a little sarcasm.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Anyway, Evita would like to interview you.<eos> Really?<eos> She actually wants to interview somebody from the real world?<eos> Yeah, she knows you're this really important local politician.<eos> - She does?

You spend one night with them, and then they start hearing wedding bells.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Sweetheart, I know you think I'm as pure as a Saint, but Russell Burke was not the first.<eos> He wasn't even the first senator.<eos> You've been with other men?<eos> Joey, your father left 25 years ago!<eos> I'm a sexual being!<eos> Did you really think I went out and played canasta every Friday night?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I did!
You can be very tired and it can...<eos> It can wear down your body.<eos> That's right. And you'll lose some of your energy.<eos> Did you that the pilgrims actually stole America from the Native Americans?<eos> They had the Native Americans teach them how to grow corn and stuff.<eos> And then they stole their land.<eos> Is that, right?<eos> Yeah, so we gave them casinos.<eos> Mrs. Zeldis told you this?<eos> No, John Frye did.
- Thanks dad.<eos> - I didn't but I'm glad I was wrong.<eos> Who knew you could be so bad ass.<eos> - Well, you know, me but...<eos> - Take it you're ready to go to school?<eos> - Uh, actually the guys are gonna give me a lift.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I swear I'm not I'm not skipping.<eos> - You believe him?<eos> - Actually, I kind of do, weird.
No. One per piece of paper.<eos> Ten pieces of paper, ten names.<eos> - Eric: Who should I put down?<eos> I can't tell you that, Eric, 'cause that would wreck the game.<eos> Eric: So then how do I know what to put?<eos> - David: Oh my God.<eos> - Stevie: (Whispers) Relax.<eos> Twyla: Can you put yourself down?<eos> Alexis: Oh, okay, who wants a shot?<eos> Because I do.
- I love you too.<eos> I'm gonna slide over a bit.<eos> Why?<eos> I just thought you were gonna lay down just for a minute.<eos> Oh, well, I thought we weren't doing that anymore.<eos> Just for tonight, because I'm so sad.<eos> Move over, you silly woman.<eos> Hey, dude.<eos> Hey, did you know your uncle knows all about construction?<eos> No, I didn't.
Hello, darling.<eos> Morning.<eos> ~ Talk about a sight for sore eyes.<eos> ~ Marlene!<eos> I'm hardly the Avon Lady, Dad.<eos> Although, judging by the smell of you, she's been here already.<eos> Oh, it's only a bit of Old Spice.<eos> Got to keep the standards up now.<eos> ~ Did you get the letter, about my lady friend?<eos> ~ Yes, Dad... I did.
The one thing that makes me feel better... is a glass of Scotch.<eos> I'm aware there are better times for me to be going off to do a fortnight's course at The London.<eos> Have you managed to prepare any food for Neil?<eos> ~ I can't face boiling milk. ~ SHE RETCHES<eos> Oh, this is more than morning sickness, Mrs Turner!<eos> The boiler has died from inattention.<eos> I may yet suffer the same fate. PATSY:<eos> Oh, Delia. You don't want to end up in some... filthy hole, living cheek by jowl with a lot of students. FRED:<eos> Did you get the letter about my lady friend?<eos> Yes, Dad, I did.
I knew I would shoot him.<eos> I'd had enough.<eos> And I just had to see it through.<eos> You made him dinner, a whole spread ...<eos> - his favorites, if I recall.<eos> - He was delighted.<eos> He had no sense of your intention.<eos> He never saw it coming... because he believed me... because I acted like everything was the way it always was.<eos> Because he had never suspected otherwise.<eos> No, he did not.
See you soon.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Boss...<eos> There will come.<eos> Finally came.<eos> Boss, he saved us.<eos> He gives our lives meaning.<eos> We have to hold out until the recession is over.<eos> Masaru got a problem.<eos> But so do we all.
Apparently nobody under 30 looks a day over 12 down there.<eos> I've got someone that can help you with that.<eos> I know this girl--well, technically she's a man now, But he's great.<eos> Oh, god, this is insane.<eos> So keep the bush.<eos> I mean, i hear it's coming back in style, anyways.<eos> No, i mean, insane thinking i can get away with this.<eos> Do i really want to trade My dignity, wisdom, and self-respect For another chance at my 20s?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Don't be shy.<eos> I used to babysit a girl who was very shy.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Kaitlyn.<eos> And you know what Kaitlyn loved?<eos> What?<eos> Polly Pockets.<eos> So do I!<eos> It's too bad we don't have any here that we could play with.<eos> We do!
He started with all the itching, and then he got an infection...<eos> Right, and then he had his hand cut off.<eos> You heard that story? Yes, but it's an urban myth.<eos> But I agree. I agree. Don't take any chances.<eos> The exterminator comes in one hour.<eos> I am going to stay at my cousin's in Riverdale.<eos> When she steals her kids' Ritalin, she's really fun.<eos> So I'll see you kids in two days. Good luck.<eos> Ugh! Oh, you're looking at me like I have cooties.<eos> You don't, do you?
Get me a copy ASAP.<eos> And clean up those damn scarves.<eos> Cubicle looks like a Stevie Nicks estate sale.<eos> Well, that can't be good.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We are not gonna let her kill this buzz.<eos> We're gonna go out and celebrate tonight.<eos> Thad and I will take Josh and you out to dinner.<eos> Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Just a friend.<eos> - I was worried.<eos> - Why?<eos> I came in, "SportsCenter" wasn't on.<eos> You weren't on the couch.<eos> I thought somebody abducted you.<eos> Baby, why you always got to make jokes at my expense?<eos> You know I'm sensitive.<eos> 'Cause deep down, I know you like it.<eos> I really don't, though.
It does not matter what people think.<eos> You know what you did.<eos> Welcome home!<eos> What a trip!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I am fine.<eos> - Did you get the marmalade?<eos> - Yes, yes. Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Great, or at least between me and Teddy. "Hmm?<eos> - Welcome aboard.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Oh, "Sir." I like that.<eos> I'll get used to that. Keep doing it.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - There it is again. That's twice.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Thank you. I owe you one.<eos> Of course you do.
I have let myself be humiliated.<eos> - But I'm happy to do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Most of the time you don't even know that I exist, but I am fucking everything to you!<eos> Oh, I am so happy to get somebody else to give me my hand cream.<eos> - Okay, go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day? - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.
-(GASPS)<eos> - And? - He had no idea what I was talking about.<eos> - No, you're kidding me.<eos> - Yeah, I don't want to talk about this, okay?<eos> - I'm so humiliated.<eos> - Okay, I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't, Gary.
Where's the storm headed now?<eos> - Florida.<eos> - Florida.<eos> So O'Brien and Montez are gonna get the storm photos? ls that what you're saying?<eos> This was definitely a good idea when I pitched it.<eos> Well, I grounded flights, and I diverted federal funds to the wrong state.<eos> I don't remember you pitching that as a possibility, Tom.<eos> Sometimes you have to gamble.<eos> Unfortunately, our horse did not win.<eos> No, it certainly didn't.
Take it quick, quick, quick.<eos> Okay, all right, that's fine.<eos> That's enough. - Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I should sit down with Amy Brookheimer, see where I fit into the plan.<eos> - Yeah, I had to let her go.<eos> - Yeah, she went crazy. - Yeah.<eos> - So you don't have a campaign manager?<eos> No, no.<eos> We do, yeah.
SELINA: Mike, were you at work today?<eos> I don't remember seeing you.<eos> (VOICE MAIL) Next memo.<eos> SELINA: Ben, Moyes is asking questions.<eos> This isn't gonna lead to any kind of an investigation, is it?<eos> (VOICE MAIL) Memo deleted.<eos> I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> So help me God.<eos> - Yes. - I do.

Should we check in before we go to the funeral home?<eos> No, I want to see him.<eos> Oh god.<eos> Would you please take these away from me?<eos> After I have one more, and then take them away.<eos> And then when the nausea passes, give them back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Before you go back there, you need to know, he may not look exactly the way you remember him.<eos> I don't want to see the body.<eos> I really don't, actually.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - No, it was not.<eos> - What?<eos> Why do I remember it being so good?<eos> Yeah, maybe because you came all the time.<eos> I didn't come.<eos> - That wasn't good for you?<eos> - Oh, Jesus. You know that I loved you so much.<eos> I loved you too.<eos> I still do.
Yeah. High school diploma.<eos> The pay is shit-tay!<eos> Well, I'm not making any money right now, so even minimum wage would be great.<eos> It's minimum-minimum wage. Don't worry about that.<eos> Am I too much of a coral gables princess to work at a shelter?<eos> "A," I didn't know you were from coral gables.<eos> And "b," it's not the shelter, man, it's the kids.<eos> Yeah, they're trans children of the corn.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
Right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Jesus. Oh.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> Well, it is Halloween.<eos> What are you playing?<eos> Oh, just something I've already beaten about 15 times, I just haven't gotten the perfect score yet.<eos> Here I am thinking you're shaming me by working on the weekend.<eos> Well, I sort of did some work.
- She's all yours.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Yum, yum.<eos> I smell drugs.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> By the way, your girl...<eos> She's a tough one.<eos> You know, when I fall for someone, I fall hard, and I think I might have scared her.<eos> Yeah, you did...
Is that a scratch across the lens?<eos> They were the last pair.<eos> - But free!<eos> - Right.<eos> But can you see?<eos> Not really, but you're totally missing the point.<eos> Of glasses?<eos> So how was your lunch with Tim?<eos> Oh, and by the way, you heard the "oh, no" thing.<eos> - I did.
That's why you sent us away.<eos> What?<eos> You knew my fucked up family would be shark bait for that thing, so you got rid of us.<eos> Wait, it isn't like that at all...<eos> Sure it is!<eos> You thought Gerhart was gonna turn so you sent us away knowing that he would come after us.<eos> You sacrificed us for Krampus to save your selfish old ass!<eos> Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.<eos> You don't know the forces that you are playing with.<eos> Yes I do.
Can she see us?<eos> They say it can sense thermal radiation.<eos> Like snakes.<eos> I thought there were two of them.<eos> There was a sibling in case this one didn't survive infancy.<eos> Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
- Sir...<eos> - ingen.<eos> Hoskins.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Then you know why I'm here.<eos> I've been working for two years on an application for those Raptors.<eos> They can hunt and kill that creature.<eos> But your program was to test their intelligence.<eos> Yeah, it was.<eos> And we did.
Please?<eos> Won't somebody help me?<eos> I am stuck in here!<eos> Help me!<eos> God help me.<eos> I'll dose her down to make it last, but if her vitals drop, you're gonna have the mother of all lawsuits on your hands.<eos> I'm gonna have the mother of all divorces on my hands if I don't get out of here soon.<eos> I promised my wife I'd take her to the met tonight, some Christmas Eve art thing.<eos> Just go in the corner.<eos> Not in here, you don't.
They could all still be alive.<eos> - Those guys are dicks.<eos> Medina is never gonna put out for you, man.<eos> You're never gonna get to second base with that girl.<eos> - What?<eos> - You know. Anal.<eos> - Okay- Firstly, I don't want to know what you think forth base is, all right? But I'm going for the music pages.<eos> Dude, fucking stop.<eos> Don't you give a shit about anyone but yourself?<eos> - No, I don't.
- HEY-<eos> - We're just holed up in - inside.<eos> " We?<eos> - When Medina was killing those demons I got a bit of a half-chub.<eos> - Look, let's get back to the matter at hand here.<eos> Seeing as how you're in an underground dwarven citadel, it looks as if it has nested hinges, which are...<eos> - Oh...<eos> Brodie!<eos> - Told you they'd be okay.<eos> - No you didn't.
No.<eos> - You're writing something?<eos> - Just drinking.<eos> I see.<eos> They told me who you are.<eos> I've read your books.<eos> - Have you?<eos> I think I like the first one best.<eos> I guess everybody did.<eos> Everyone did.
Let's have a look.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Holy hell, what happened in here?<eos> I was trying to cook dinner for my fiancé.<eos> Fiancé.<eos> Fiancé. Wow, that is one of those words that sounds strange if you say it a lot.<eos> Or even once.<eos> So, you need help salvaging the meal?<eos> - Oh. - I kid.<eos> Of course you do.
You may fist with pride."<eos> I still want to do it.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> I see an open bar with our name on it.<eos> Just blend in, just blend in.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm having so much fun right now.<eos> I never want to go home!<eos> I don't have a home!<eos> Shh! Yes, you do!
This was the meaningful act I was searching for.<eos> You can't just take it upon yourself to take someone's life.<eos> Well, I thought it was a very reasonable thing to do.<eos> She hoped he'd get cancer!<eos> But what the hell is hoping?<eos> Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
I suddenly found a reason to live.<eos> I could make love, I could experience feelings for you, because to do this deed for this woman gave my life meaning.<eos> You have to leave, Abe.<eos> You gotta go. I can't see you ever again.<eos> - I won't say anything.<eos> - (SCOFFING)<eos> I won't say anything.<eos> But I...<eos> I believe that you think you did something morally worthwhile.<eos> - I did!
Juanj0's mum's plant. I wonder if it's the one the hippies smoked in the 60s.<eos> The artist wished to show the void of the siren as a reflection of our times.<eos> The absence of the uterus is the key to the artwork, her hysterectomy a symbol of vacuous, superficial Western consumerism.<eos> Precisely.<eos> You can see the influence of François Mauvellet.<eos> Correct.<eos> If you'll accompany me, we shall further appreciate...<eos> I think the...<eos> I didn't get it at all.<eos> You didn't?
It's all right.<eos> Go.<eos> Go now.<eos> Everybody said it was back.<eos> This... .. sweating sickness.<eos> I should have sent them to the country.<eos> Liz wouldn't have let them go.<eos> Anne cried every time you were away.<eos> Did she?<eos> Anne did?
Did you, uh, know... That that star right there is Sirius?<eos> That's the fourth-closest star to the planet earth.<eos> Wow.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Uh, the light we're seeing right now started shining about 8 1/2 years ago.<eos> Right about the same time that you moved onto my block.<eos> And we started walking to school together.<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> We did.<eos> He did good, pigeon.
A gift?<eos> 12th.<eos> Did she buy anything on the 12th?<eos> There's an email showing a receipt from an online store.<eos> Electrical goods, £344.<eos> Well, get onto the store, see what costs £344.<eos> Xbox or iPad.<eos> One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!<eos> That cash transfer to R Synnott, - how do we know that's Ryan?<eos> - We don't.

"moon, paint." 375 volts.<eos> Dangerous, severe shock.<eos> Let me out of here, let me out.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> You can't hold me in here.<eos> Get me out.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - I just liked the picture.<eos> The colors...<eos> Don't you?
I jumped off your roof.<eos> You?<eos> You mean, Abaddon...<eos> No, it was both of us.<eos> We were one.<eos> I mean, it wasn't a battle.<eos> I wasn't fighting him and he wasn't controlling me.<eos> I made him stronger, and he made me stronger, and it was better than the best heroin, the best ecstasy, better than any dick I've ever had.<eos> Hazel, I-I don't need to know that...<eos> Yes, you do.
The man's a Svengali, okay?<eos> He's a Casanova who counts cards secretly while he's got four queens up the sleeve.<eos> He is not to be trusted.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you think maybe this is just, like, cosmic retribution for what we did to Shoshanna?<eos> Putting aside my disdain for the injection of witchcraft into a conversation that was previously tethered by logic and reason, no, I don't think that's what's happening here.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I'm way more upset than she ever was.<eos> Look, even if this knot were to somehow untangle itself, even if he were to jettison her, make a host of sweeping promises to you, hop on a white horse, gallop to your place with a truckload of roses--<eos> - even if he did all that... - Mm-hmm.
I'll be one second.<eos> I just--<eos> You're-- you're gonna do that here?<eos> I'm not waiting for a park or, like, stepping into a restaurant.<eos> Jesus fucking-- okay.<eos> Okay, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop.<eos> - What--?<eos> Put a plug in it.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Sorry. All done here, Officer.
- I work alone.<eos> Even if I have a 2-million euro heist in mind?<eos> The secret formula of Ciao Dream.<eos> - Who'd buy it?<eos> - The Chinese!<eos> They want to copy it, the president is terrified.<eos> No one in the company knows the formula.<eos> The production is done in a sealed machine and the server is locked in a sort of vault.<eos> How do you get in?<eos> You don't.
Dr. Jordan, I'm sorry, but we live on an island that's 400 miles from the nearest fast food joint.<eos> We've got no convenience stores, no antidepressants, no World Wide Web.<eos> We're completely self-sufficient and we take care of our own, which is why I'm not very good at asking for help.<eos> But... I'm doing that now.<eos> Dr. Farragut, if we give you our complete cooperation, do you think you can find this disease, get rid of it?<eos> We're not equipped for containment.<eos> We expected to observe and take samples.<eos> Well, what if you had the right equipment?<eos> Coast guard won't be back for two weeks, so unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere...<eos> No, we don't.
- Standing by with the cure.<eos> - Be advised we're sending in another chopper.<eos> Evac at 0400. Over.<eos> We gotta go find Dr. Jordan.<eos> I'm not letting you out of my sight.<eos> - We need to get out of here.<eos> - Not until I get my bag back, and Mother.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> You have no idea where Alan is.<eos> I do now.
You only shot him once he was already on the ground, dead.<eos> I shot him first.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Did you give information about Poison to the DEA?<eos> So?<eos> I'm still listening to their phone conversations, and it's not a shipment of drugs.<eos> They're carrying three million dollars to Bogotá, and if two guys from the DEA stop that car,<eos> Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.<eos> - You don't have 65, Poi.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could hide in the jungle and wait it out.<eos> Sooner or later, he figured the narcos would cave in.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> M-19 didn't stand a chance.<eos> "Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound... or your family is next."<eos> Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."<eos> Please!<eos> Please, let me go.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!
We're going to negotiate a truce.<eos> But first, we're going to kill a few of his men.<eos> I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel is going to take that as an act of war, don't you think?<eos> The purpose of war... is peace.<eos> If there was one benefit to Escobar's imprisonment, it's that peace had finally come to Bogotá.<eos> Connie and I took advantage and began adoption proceedings.<eos> The war had left many orphans.<eos> One... we could do something about.<eos> Oh, you like the pink ones, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Excuse me.<eos> Can I say something?<eos> And then it happened.<eos> When confronted with actual injustice, even if it was small-scale, in the spirit of Dr. King, Junior knew how to step up.<eos> I may be a newbie to snowboarding, but the way you're treating her, it's not right.<eos> There's no difference between boarders and skiers.<eos> We're all just people with wood strapped to our feet, sliding down a mountain.<eos> I have a dream that one day we will not be judged by the size of our board, but by what we do in the pow-pow.<eos> Because the snow doesn't care who we are.<eos> It does not.
- Get out, Jéssica.<eos> - I'm eating, Val. Let me finish.<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> The maid's daughter sitting at the bosses' table?<eos> They are not my bosses, Val.<eos> Hey. "Val"? Can't you call me "Mom"?<eos> - I can.<eos> - Much obliged.<eos> Done.
He would not turn left but go straight and stay straight.<eos> Learn to drive, jerk!<eos> I really like this.<eos> I don't want it to stop.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just want to sit here till it's over.<eos> I've listened to this about 500 times, and every time, it's like it's so slow,<eos> I feel like it could stop.<eos> But it doesn't.
- Of course.<eos> All right.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> I can't believe he hit that little kid.<eos> - I'm sorry, but who does that?<eos> - Connie.<eos> - Not even his own kid.<eos> This thing we've been doing, please, I'm so sorry if I've been leading you on, but it's got to stop.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you?
What are dayboat scallops?<eos> Forgive me if I don't feel like celebrating the arrest of my husband's cousin.<eos> [Chuckles] Aisha, this is important.<eos> Hugo, Adam, Melissa, they need to see that there is justice in the world.<eos> Rosie, let it go.<eos> - What?<eos> - Stop. Let it go.<eos> Five-year-olds get slapped all the time, and they heal.<eos> - They do not.<eos> - They do.
- Do what?<eos> Let's get married and be together and have fun with Olive or add an "R" for Oliver and show whomever's in your belly how great life can be.<eos> I think about breaking up with you ten times a day just so that I don't have to think about you.<eos> I know... [Chuckles]<eos> I know, but you haven't.<eos> But I should.<eos> I really should.<eos> You're the most beautiful man I ever met, but...<eos> I just don't want this.<eos> I don't.
It has nothing to do with him.<eos> Then what is it, love?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why are you being so cautious?<eos> Because it's my last chance?<eos> What, to have a kid?<eos> Well, it's only gonna get harder, but no. No, it's not your last chance.<eos> Well, listen to me.<eos> I don't know how to be a mom.<eos> Anouk, nobody does.
No wonder you want to protect him.<eos> I'm not protecting anyone.<eos> I've moved on.<eos> You're so annoyingly perfect for each other.<eos> She's never gonna trust me again - ever.<eos> - We're leaving.<eos> - Sam, we have to go.<eos> Uh, yeah!<eos> - How do we know Alice isn't here?<eos> - We don't.
The party<eos> - Andy running off.<eos> - You don't remember anything after that?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> You remember the alternate universe, though, right?<eos> I could use a précis.<eos> - "Précis"...?<eos> - It means 'recap'.<eos> I know what it means.<eos> Since when does Sam?
Come on, magical altar thingummy. Where are you?<eos> - This place is massive.<eos> - Could be anywhere.<eos> How about it, Oscar?<eos> Got any more magical-altar vibes?<eos> I'm not getting anything.<eos> You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you?<eos> Based on recent experience?<eos> I know how badly you want to get Andy back.<eos> We all do.
That's exactly how I feel about killing you all.<eos> While I know that your expectations are so high that no human being could possibly meet them, this year, you are going to have an amazing birthday.<eos> I will defeat you.<eos> Can't be done.<eos> I'm way too strong when it comes to sabotaging my own happiness.<eos> Everything you do will fall short to what I've built up in my head.<eos> Well, maybe it would be easier if you didn't ask for presents that were impossible to get.<eos> I've seen a baby tiger.<eos> I know they exist.<eos> They do.
(Banging) A great woman taught me this spell.<eos> I've taken possession of your body. Out there, in the real world, they think I'm you.<eos> No, I'm right here.<eos> You see, that is what's surprising.<eos> Your consciousness should already be dead.<eos> Gone from here.<eos> You are quite the fighter.<eos> You haven't even begun to see me fight!<eos> You don't have any control over your body.<eos> I do.
Previously on "Bitten".<eos> - What am I pregnant with?<eos> - A werewolf.<eos> Witches believe in the prophecy of the Undoing.<eos> A male child born to a witch is destined to bring about our downfall.<eos> We killed you.<eos> With your help, I'll get what I need.<eos> A great woman taught me this spell.<eos> You don't have any control over your body.<eos> I do.
Truman... How did the Russians treat you?<eos> Badly, can't you see he's swollen, his breath stinks,<eos> I don't know what they gave him.<eos> You have breakfast here often?<eos> No, I'm with another candidate, she's in the restroom.<eos> She might adopt him.<eos> She phoned this morning, you were snoring.<eos> It's good to have more options.<eos> Since the Russian doesn't want him.<eos> - He doesn't?
No, my mum died when I was 10.<eos> That's awful, I'm sorry about that.<eos> You know, I lost my folks when I was a kid as well and it can affect you really badly that. Not having your proper family around.<eos> And I know when I have my little ba-ba, I'm going to make sure I'm there 100%.<eos> I've got to say though, all things considered, I don't think I turned out that badly, really.<eos> Got to be strong now, Chloe.<eos> Nice and strong for your dad.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> Please, please don't.
Are you sure? - Yes.<eos> Will you buy it for me?<eos> Of course I am!<eos> Hiroshi!<eos> Come, come here!<eos> It's nice, eh?<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to show you how it fits.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Do you?
The Grand Canyon.<eos> Have you been? No.<eos> I hear it's big.<eos> Huge.<eos> How's the tea?<eos> Hot. Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't want it.<eos> Carrie, it's food, love.<eos> Get it down you.<eos> We're not far away now, please.<eos> Go on.<eos> Go on, get it down you.<eos> We're gonna meet Mr. Korsky and his boat.<eos> The one who didn't come last time?<eos> It was a misunderstanding.<eos> What if he does it again?
I don't know.<eos> I don't know what is in the sheriff's mind.<eos> (Morton) Are you afraid to talk about this?<eos> (Elena) No.<eos> (Morton) Are you frightened to talk to me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good, that's good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She says she doesn't have a relationship with sheriff Andersson.<eos> (Eric) So she doesn't.
But she was very much like you.<eos> Strong-willed.<eos> Imperious.<eos> Fucked other men, not your father.<eos> Yes.<eos> You saw them at it?<eos> Your mother and these men.<eos> Did you like watching?<eos> No.<eos> You did.
It's like he's not really alive.<eos> Go on, my dear.<eos> "He took us by our winged backs and raised us over His head.<eos> Thence did he fling us from his Heavenly Throne and... and cast us down, to Earth and to Hell.<eos> Damned?<eos> At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Thank you.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Oh, it's fantastic, Malcolm.<eos> I wanted her to succeed here tonight. I...<eos> Be still your heart, Doctor.<eos> This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
And I know I can.<eos> I'm not so dumb anymore. I'm not ignoring the fact that I could actually lose your love.<eos> You never lost it. But I will never allow you to hurt me again.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I always have.<eos> I've never loved anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> You think you can come in here when I'm all disoriented and say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago and make me run away with you?<eos> I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.<eos> I do.
Oh, no, please, I have to rest for just a minute.<eos> Toto?<eos> Where's Toto?<eos> "Look at this.<eos> I'm overwhelmed.<eos> "All these kind words.<eos> "They've made up for what has been a truly rubbish day, so thank you,<eos> "and there's to be an election to take my place.<eos> "Now, come on, Pagford, "did you think I wouldn't have something to say about this?<eos> "Of course I do.
Reckon I might jack it for good.<eos> ~ Oi!<eos> You're not going to do that.<eos> ~ Why aren't I?<eos> I want you to finish school.<eos> Up!<eos> You can do one exam. Ah...<eos> Maths.<eos> Tell them you want to sit maths.<eos> But I don't.
Three lousy lines?<eos> Why would anyone need more than three lines?<eos> I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique.<eos> I forgot what I wrote. Can I hear it?<eos> Why don't you read it yourself?<eos> "Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."<eos> So far, so accurate.<eos> "If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."<eos> You forgot the last sentence.<eos> No, I didn't.
Ah! You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing.<eos> Third, I'm now gonna give you permanent answers to all the silly questions that you're gonna end up asking me and every other woman in this election over the next few months.<eos> Why did I change my hairstyle?<eos> Well, I don't know, I just thought it would look better.<eos> Or my kids got gum in it.<eos> Are you trying to have it all?<eos> That question makes no sense.<eos> It's a stupid question. Stop asking it.<eos> Don't ask it. Do you miss your kids while you're at work?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
- Exactly.<eos> See? You find people as annoying as I do.<eos> - More so.<eos> - And yet, you're able to listen to them.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> It's not easy.<eos> I have a few tricks up my sleeve.<eos> Like if someone's droning on about their stupid life, I just pretend something really horrible will happen to my child if I don't listen.<eos> That's not gonna work for you 'cause you don't have a child.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Is there some cupcake cart girl stealing your recipes?<eos> No, I have been very protective of my creations ever since Snoop Dogg stole my secret language.<eos> I should have never told him that his new album was the shizzle.<eos> I just wanted on that yacht party so bad.<eos> Oh, the one where Suge Knight pushed your friend overboard?<eos> No, that was a different one.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> How you doing?
I need you to draw some of Klaus' blood.<eos> Bring me some in an hour, and I'll heal you.<eos> It would be my pleasure.<eos> Pick up the damn phone, Elijah.<eos> Finn is trying to find Hope.<eos> She's safe.<eos> It'll take 100 witches to break the cloaking spell.<eos> I would've said the same about mother finding you, and yet a flock of starlings later, and here we are.<eos> He won't let them get to her, Nik, but you need to remain calm.<eos> Our brother doesn't do calm.
I collect people's tears.<eos> I can't cry.<eos> There are many things I can't do.<eos> But I can hear people's inner music.<eos> Each of us has their own.<eos> Do you want to know yours?<eos> It's Handel. It's lovely.<eos> Tonight, I'll make up a dream for you.<eos> Do you know when you'll die?<eos> I don't.
Christina got some decent mommy skills.<eos> Maybe she can take care of the baby for a little while.<eos> She's in junior high.<eos> So what?<eos> Junior high will still be there.<eos> Plus, she's already done, what, two years?<eos> Yo, it's all good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I actually thought he loved me.<eos> And he probably did, Daya.
But if she tries to hit on you, I will smack a bitch down.<eos> I've heard girls talking about you, saying you can offer help.<eos> I'm in a pretty dark place.<eos> Is this, like, a guru situation?<eos> I went to see Amma once... the hugging saint.<eos> Waited for three hours to get hugged. But then Seamus said he felt sick.<eos> Said it was from the sun and the chia pudding, but I'm pretty sure he just got impatient.<eos> I could have used that hug.<eos> I don't know why I didn't stay.<eos> Yes, I do.
Now he wants to see her.<eos> Joey, he's her father.<eos> I'm her father.<eos> I'm the one who stuck around.<eos> He's her real father.<eos> He has a right to have a relationship with her.<eos> You're leaving me for Hank.<eos> He's doing really well for himself.<eos> They made a big chunk of change on that Warner's deal. - He has ambition.<eos> - And I don't?
Cal, the doilies!<eos> Touché.<eos> Look, this is never gonna work.<eos> The tuna thing is a dead giveaway.<eos> Give me this. Yeah, it's just all fish.<eos> There's no nuance.<eos> Well, sure.<eos> You should know. I mean... you do know what a vagina smells like.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Obviously, I do.
You can do this.<eos> You're a champion.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Wait.<eos> I think I have something to help.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> You think so?<eos> I mean, I hoped you'd think so. I just wasn't sure.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Tell me right now.<eos> Get me my plea deal.<eos> Then I'll tell you where she is.<eos> I'll swing by the house tomorrow and check it out.<eos> Yeah, merry whatever to you, too.<eos> Oh, who is that?<eos> Bonnie. Ah. She stay in town or she go visit her family?<eos> Nah, her family's messed up.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I don't.
No, I can't do this anymore.<eos> I think we should postpone the wedding.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No, no!<eos> Don't -- don't do this. I swear I'll do anything you want.<eos> Just don't -- don't do this.<eos> I love you. I want to marry you, and you want to marry me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't...
Actually, that's something I wanted to discuss with you.<eos> Alec mentioned it, but I would have said the same thing.<eos> We were all very happy.<eos> Frankly, impressed.<eos> Have you ever considered joining a larger firm?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I have a lot of FSU law friends who did.<eos> - Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Miami, D.C., Houston.<eos> I did my third year summer in Dallas.
Go ahead. Put the other one on.<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> You want them under your feet.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Yes.<eos> - It's about work.<eos> - Oh, the project's dead. - I thought Susannah talked to you.<eos> - She did.
It's a fundraiser for the shelter, Scroogey.<eos> Yes, we have to go.<eos> Ah, well, if it's a fundraiser, we should definitely go.<eos> We can just have a drink with Jake and Milo another time.<eos> All right, well, maybe we can stop by for a quick drink on the way out, - if you want.<eos> - Good. Thank you.<eos> - Because I already said yes.<eos> - Oh. Now, come on, quick.<eos> Fuck-me-in-the-buttime before someone else rings that fucking bell.<eos> - So, you guys doing all right?
Ever.<eos> I don't want to go back there again.<eos> Neither do I. Good.<eos> It's just... it's just all the lying and the feeling guilty and shitty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's just so not what I want.<eos> - Good. We want the same thing.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And you asked me if Jon knew about all the... the little things.<eos> Well, he didn't.
- as long as we talk about it. - Okay.<eos> So are we talking about steam room jerk-offs, or do you want to go back downstairs to the fifth floor and join the KKK butt orgy? Yes, that's it.<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> - Jesus Christ. - What the fuck is this thing?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> When Jake and Milo came by earlier, did they give you the skinny on the sex party?<eos> Is that why you wanted to go down there? Can you put little Ted down, please?<eos> He's very fragile.<eos> He's already lost an eye.<eos> No, they didn't.
We do.<eos> You did the most generous thing that anyone's ever done for me and...<eos> But I really need to try this on my own, however I can.<eos> I still want to help you.<eos> So if I fall on my ass, then, come get hammered with me.<eos> And if it works out, then you have to be the first person at that window on opening day.<eos> But you need to start thinking about someone else first instead of me.<eos> He's a great fucking guy.<eos> And I really liked seeing you come out of his door with a big wreath on it.<eos> I kind of did too.
I watch it any time I need to find courage.<eos> I could use some courage right now.<eos> Lionheart!<eos> I thought you said this film had dancing in it.<eos> This is dancing.<eos> It's so violent.<eos> Life is violent.<eos> It is.<eos> I didn't think so before.<eos> But you do now.
I just think we have to... watch out for each other.<eos> I was just thinking...<eos> I was thinking that...<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.<eos> There was a time when... that wouldn't have meant anything to me, but... now it does.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If this feels that good when we're not really here, what's it gonna be like when we are?<eos> You came back.<eos> Yes... I did.
Oh. And i have no idea where you got this, But it's totally my new profile pic.<eos> So.<eos> What do you want with me?<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> Because?<eos> Because i had a vision of you as a zombie, Chasing a man through an alley.<eos> You were about to rip open his skull.<eos> He was killed in a dui accident, wound up here. I ate his brain.<eos> Until the vision, i thought i was the only one.<eos> Yeah, until, like, three seconds ago, so did i.
Hey... look, I... I just want to say that I'm...<eos> I don't... I don't need you to give up on training because of any of this.<eos> Hey... you know, I got a bunch of... exercise equipment here that... I'm not gonna use.<eos> - Do you want to take some of it?<eos> - No, that's what I'm saying.<eos> I'm sure this whole experience has soured you on us, but... you know, and just because Power 4 Life wasn't the right fit for you in helping you achieve your goals doesn't mean you should use that as an excuse to, you know,<eos> Hey, you know, I've been watching your videos on YouTube.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you make it seem like you believe all this shit, you know.<eos> Of course, I do.
Get me from the trolley when he's done.<eos> Sorry, sir. We thought it was just ribbon-cutting.<eos> We didn't mean to cut you short.<eos> I'm sure they're grateful.<eos> Nobody wants to hear a politician banging on, do they?<eos> - Has there been an incident? - No.<eos> We're here on an historic inquiry.<eos> Do you remember finding a credit card belonging to REC Imports?<eos> You'd have been, what, 16?<eos> I do, indeed.
It is as easy as that.<eos> What was that?<eos> I think that might be my ticket out of jail.<eos> Drink?<eos> He can't stay here.<eos> Abigail, my flame-haired beauty.<eos> A little early for the tavern, isn't it?<eos> Actually, I find that alcohol shortens the day considerably.<eos> You Adams men think you're so charming, don't you?<eos> Indeed, we do.
Indeed.<eos> Gentlemen, please.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We are getting away with this.<eos> Are you trying to get caught?<eos> I'm doing what we set out to do.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to keep making money, don't you?<eos> You want to keep living that privileged life of yours.<eos> Yes, of course I do.
And you are an outsider.<eos> Forgive me, Lady Brienne. But experience has made me wary of outsiders.<eos> Lady Sansa...<eos> - if we can have a word alone...<eos> - No.<eos> - Please, my Lady, if I can explain...<eos> - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding... bowing to the king.<eos> Neither of us wanted to be there.<eos> - Sometimes we don't have a choice.<eos> - And sometimes we do.
(Jenna) I'm not that good at athletic stuff.<eos> I broke my arm once drawing a bath.<eos> (Jenna) I wouldn't have even been checking my texts if things were clicking with Brian, but they weren't.<eos> And Matty's text was exactly right.<eos> I didn't want to miss it.<eos> It was the end of my whole high school era.<eos> I wanted to be there, and whatever guilt or mixed up emotions I had about Matty shouldn't have been keeping me away.<eos> - [murmuring] - [giggling] Hey, T, we gotta get back to school for the prank.<eos> What?<eos> No, we don't.
No, we exile him if it comes to that.<eos> We do that, we don't know when he comes back And what he does to them.<eos> Letting him go makes this place vulnerable.<eos> You really want to wait till someone in that tower has to take care of it?<eos> And that's if we're lucky.<eos> We are not... Executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, deanna.<eos> They do.
Cool.<eos> You're afraid of me, too.<eos> Sasha.<eos> Go back.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm sick of playing defense.<eos> So you're just gonna take on all of them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> You do, i don't.
Your father is not well.<eos> Wha...<eos> Daniel, it was a great idea to bring Kate.<eos> What the hell is going on, Dad?<eos> Did the police come?<eos> I sent them away.<eos> I don't need them. I need you.<eos> Something terrible has happened to your cousin Roger.<eos> Dad, you're... You're confused. I don't have a cousin Roger.<eos> Woman: Oh, yes, you do.
Hanging up now.<eos> This guy's...<eos> Yeah, he's probably a target.<eos> Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas.<eos> You know, if Kettleman isn't careful with that money, I mean, his whole family could be in danger.<eos> What do you mean "danger"?<eos> Jimmy, why would you say that?<eos> What?<eos> You said the family might be in danger.<eos> I did? I...
Yeah. Sure.<eos> Fine. Perfect end to a perfect day.<eos> Hey, guys, wait a second.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I don't wanna press charges.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> You want to press charges.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Why's that?<eos> 'Cause you believe me.<eos> That family kidnapped themselves.<eos> All right, I believe you.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I knew it!<eos> Finally, someone believes me!<eos> Why do you believe me?<eos> I heard the details. Your story makes sense.<eos> Of course it does!
- You're having a party tonight?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, here?<eos> - What kind of party?<eos> - Friends. - Who?<eos> - No one you know.<eos> - Debs, I'm not gonna be here tonight.<eos> - So?<eos> I don't need a chaperone.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You didn't prove Ben Barnes got the president into the Guard.<eos> You didn't prove the memos are real.<eos> The burden of proof is on you.<eos> By that standard, The Times would never have run the Pentagon Papers.<eos> The Post wouldn't have listened to Deep Throat...<eos> - Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat.<eos> - He's confessed to abusing his power... to keep some of the richest, privileged sons of Texas... from getting their asses blown off in Vietnam.<eos> Ms. Mapes. Don't you think it's possible, just possible... that some of those fine, young... "privileged men, as you call them... got into the National Guard on their own merit?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No, I do not.
Travesty of justice." I mean, i get a few of these letters every once in a while, But so does everybody.<eos> Is there anyone else you can think of?<eos> There's this guy who works at my coffee shop, Letterhead coffee, right across the street from me.<eos> He's this tall, hipster-nerd type.<eos> He's always asking me a bunch of questions,<eos> But he seems pretty harmless.<eos> Corey something. I don't know his last name.<eos> Does he know your last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Michie, you can make such a difference here.<eos> You were on the field when the shooter fired.<eos> Your boyfriend got caught up in a turf war.<eos> You think they're after Raj because he was connected to Kill Street.<eos> That silver S.U.V... you ever seen it before?<eos> Yeah...<eos> belongs to Boz Shepherd.<eos> Did you happen to see who was driving it today?<eos> You want me to say it was Boz.<eos> And what if I did?
- We got him.<eos> - What about Henry Kim?<eos> Well, if Kim knows Boz got I.D.'d, he just might change his story, right?<eos> You know, Boz is a talented guy, but he's not magic.<eos> He can't be in two places at the same time.<eos> Yeah, we've got him at the crime scene.<eos> An eyewitness I.D.'d him about an hour ago.<eos> Which means either our witness is lying or you may have been confused about this morning.<eos> Someone saw him at the baseball field?<eos> Yes, they did.
Are you... talking about Michie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Apparently, it went viral.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Don't know yet. Does Steve know you're here?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
No. He only knows what he just saw.<eos> Michie and the rest...<eos> You know I had to do it.<eos> Oh, sure. I know that.<eos> Steve...<eos> We could have put that guy away, but now... now he's back out there.<eos> Because he didn't do it.<eos> You know, I thought we had each other's back.<eos> Yeah, same team for the first time.<eos> I did.
You know, one time, I had a bride show up on a Saturday when the wedding was actually on a Sunday.<eos> That's pretty weird.<eos> She's gonna be here.<eos> Uh, the wedding's in, uh, 10... 10 minutes.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know the girl.<eos> She's probably working on one of her lists.<eos> She wants everything to be perfect before she walks through the door.<eos> Yeah, you think?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Is that safe?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Maggie.<eos> Hi, hon.<eos> Oh, my gosh, are you okay?<eos> Mr. Tucker says you didn't have the best routine and that you've been acting silly and eating bad snacks.<eos> - That doesn't sound like you.<eos> - I just had a little taste.<eos> Mr. Tucker thinks that Maggie would be better off training with him.<eos> - I do.
It was the only way I could see to get you out of DYAD.<eos> Marion wanted Castor information, and Paul wanted something in return.<eos> Helena?<eos> It was what I had to do at the time.<eos> What, betray my sister?<eos> Give her to them?<eos> For Kira.<eos> That is not your bloody decision, S, is it? !<eos> Does DYAD know about this?<eos> Did Cal?
Look, I didn't mean to blow you off.<eos> Okay? I... You caught me off guard and everything came out wrong and I'm sorry.<eos> Well, it won't happen again, okay?<eos> From now on, you're just the asshole who knocked up my mom.<eos> Okay, fine, I'm the asshole.<eos> I mean, I've caused you nothing but problems since I got here, so I get it.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I just do.
I'm so sorry.<eos> What can we do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> May I say something?<eos> Not right now, Sheldon.<eos> But I think it would be comforting.<eos> Buddy... No, it's okay.<eos> What?<eos> When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it.<eos> You do.
Wow.<eos> She's my champion!<eos> Well, if you can switch champions, so can I.<eos> I want Raj. Hey.<eos> Oh, come on, like you even care.<eos> I care!<eos> Oh, wait, no, I don't.<eos> Good luck, Raj.<eos> You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.<eos> So did I.
A: surprised you know that.<eos> I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you. Oh.<eos> Well, you do. Oh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're gonna be on Skype; they're not gonna see your legs.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case.<eos> But I have to say, this is very freeing.<eos> Add a belt and I'll take you someplace nice.<eos> Done and done.
We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.<eos> Clearly, you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.<eos> Guys. In the time you've been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.<eos> I put on pants.<eos> Kiss-ass.<eos> Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today.<eos> You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.<eos> Hey, I don't even live here.<eos> Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?<eos> I do.
You're the strong, silent type.<eos> Hooray for you.<eos> But in case you missed it, your friends from Philly back there... they think you killed two cops.<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You call the cops?<eos> What?<eos> Philadelphia P.D. Did you call them?<eos> - Y... yeah, I did.
I understand.<eos> But it's no your fault, you know that, don't you?<eos> You mustn't feel guilty.<eos> I don't feel guilty.<eos> That's what's odd.<eos> Do you like to sail?<eos> - I love to sail.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.<eos> I do, too.
You've been running all your life.<eos> Terrible things happened to your family and you weep.<eos> You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates.<eos> You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.<eos> Stop being a bystander, you hear me?<eos> Stop running.<eos> There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it.<eos> You loved your family. Avenge them.<eos> How do we get through there?<eos> We don't.
Why Daenerys?<eos> Why is she worth all this?<eos> As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.<eos> Do you believe in anything?<eos> I believe in lots of things.<eos> In something greater than ourselves, I mean.<eos> The gods, destiny.<eos> Do you believe there's a plan for this world?<eos> No.<eos> Neither did I.
No?<eos> What is he?<eos> We're allies.<eos> You fucking traitor.<eos> You fight for the crows now?<eos> I don't fight for the crows.<eos> We're not here to fight.<eos> We're here to talk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?
Oh, my God!<eos> Way out of my league.<eos> And he lives with me now.<eos> I lived with Karl, but he moved out, and Freddie got thrown out of India House, so he moved in.<eos> Just when I've got a chastity belt.<eos> I'm lickin' the walls.<eos> He looks nice, though, he looks really nice.<eos> Hashtag, get naked!<eos> Yeah, no-one says ' "hashtag'" out loud, not any more.<eos> They do. My friends do.
- That's cos I go with men, yeah? - No.<eos> It's because I go with men.<eos> You think that means I fuck everything up the arse.<eos> No.<eos> It's because every man I ever meet wants to fuck me up the arse, these days.<eos> They expect it!<eos> This isn't about you, Freddie,<eos> I just think I think men like fucking women from behind so they don't have to look at our faces.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I do.
36. Early days. Might be nothing.<eos> But he's mad, he's completely mad.<eos> HE CHUCKLES God, I'd forgotten how mad men can be.<eos> And...<eos> I mean, he's insane.<eos> But I think there's a chance.<eos> Are... Are you actually going out?<eos> We're sort of... circling.<eos> But he wants more, I think.<eos> I do.
You make sense now!<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's still so important, after all these years.<eos> Cock.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> You know.<eos> We had all that time, and...<eos> - We had brilliant times.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
- You see?<eos> He comes and goes. That's what he did with us, Mr B. - He came and he went.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You were never gonna have him.<eos> No.<eos> Funny thing is... that's what drove him away in the end.<eos> How d'you mean?<eos> Long story.<eos> But I liked him.<eos> I really did.
That turned to shit.<eos> So, what are you doing these days?<eos> Things.<eos> How are you doing there, Henry?<eos> Are we looking after you?<eos> - Yes, all good, thanks. Hello.<eos> - How's the project?<eos> What was that?<eos> You had to do a project, you worked late, you had to get it finished by the weekend?<eos> Oh, the schedule, I did it, yes!
Well, Mr. Gutiérrez, your son told us that he wasn't at home on Sunday night.<eos> Do you recall if Tony was home with you?<eos> No, he wasn't at home.<eos> Mr. Gutiérrez, do you know where your son was?<eos> Well, he told me he was working on the car.<eos> Tony, were you working on the car, or were you out riding around in it?<eos> Tony was telling us that it's just you at home. - Is that right? - Yes.<eos> My wife and I, we recently separated, so I know how hard it is...<eos> No, no, it's, uh, different.<eos> We didn't...
I had to go to my kid's open house last night.<eos> Get some suction in here, please.<eos> No, no, it was, like, hours of us sitting on those little stools, you know?<eos> Hector.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Let me tell you where we are.<eos> We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car.<eos> We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?
No, no, it was, like, hours of us sitting on those little stools, you know?<eos> Hector.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Let me tell you where we are.<eos> We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car.<eos> We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?<eos> Why they got to shoot me?<eos> Who did?
So, um... you know, if there's anything that you can tell me about Matt...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Whatever. It doesn't... It doesn't matter now.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Was Matt on drugs?<eos> D-did... did he... Did he deal drugs?<eos> - What? - Did... I mean, 'cause...<eos> No, but they're saying things about Matt. They're saying things about him, and I need to know.<eos> He had some grass around.<eos> Everybody does.
Sounds good.<eos> Mm. You smell awfully nice.<eos> - I just showered. - [Lena] Hmm.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Hey, Callie? Robert's here.<eos> You have a beautiful home.<eos> We like it.<eos> So does Callie.
Welcome.<eos> Go to the back.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> - Hi, Ben.<eos> - Hi, Gracie.<eos> - Do you know where Carson's class is?<eos> Urn... they might be in room 4.<eos> Okay, let's go to room 4.<eos> How you doing, Pal?
Magnify.<eos> Gills?<eos> As in... mermaids?<eos> As in Atlantis.<eos> Where is this?<eos> These carvings, I recognize them from the Tales of Atlantis I read as a girl.<eos> It sunk into the ocean, but its people were saved by the magic of the King's trident which turned them irreversibly into creatures of the sea.<eos> That's a fairy tale.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Well, of course he does.
- Don't say it.<eos> - He just said that.<eos> - Just say the answer. Show... show me..<eos> is the part I say?<eos> Here's the one thing... there's only one thing in the whole world at this moment you shouldn't say... - Mm-hmm?<eos> - "Show me."<eos> So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh...<eos> You know what, go ahead and do it.<eos> Just go ahead and do it, then.<eos> - Do what?
Needed his time to be someone's fault, so he made it mine.<eos> If that was true, why didn't he just cap us when he got out?<eos> 'Cause he wanted the business back.<eos> He needed to learn how it worked.<eos> What you taught him.<eos> All he needed was an introduction to Lobos.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> He asked to come to the Lobos meet.<eos> He wanted me to take him.<eos> Of course he did.
No, no, no, no, this is standard procedure.<eos> They do this on every crime show.<eos> You know, the murder police come down to the scene of the crime and they find some blue-collar guy and they talk to him while he's working.<eos> Let's just talk to this guy over here-- he could know something, right?<eos> Why would he know anything?<eos> He's moving crates from one place to...<eos> Will you just listen to me? All right?<eos> Excuse me, sir, uh, do you work here? - Yeah.<eos> - Please, don't stop your work.<eos> They never do on TV.
No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> We're trying to show Bill that life is worth living.<eos> Your dad loves you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - No.<eos> - Has he not said it?<eos> - Because I'm telling you, he just...<eos> - He does. No.
Yeah.<eos> You were waiting for passports?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't know where to start.<eos> But i'm a nerd, so i thought books.<eos> We researched how to disappear.<eos> The library kind of became a command center.<eos> But how did you get birth certificates? I called people and said i was government, Told them there was a fire,<eos> In order for us to re-register them and... Most people didn't. But...<eos> Some people did.
You'll keep our secret, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yes.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure.<eos> Come on. [ sighs ]<eos> I need your bag.<eos> [ sighs deeply ] So... Where you living these days?<eos> [ chuckles ] you actually care?<eos> Yeah, i actually do.
I'm gonna miss my plane.<eos> Oh. Seriously?<eos> Unreal.<eos> Hi.<eos> Your phone's off.<eos> I know.<eos> I was in court.<eos> What are -- is everything okay?<eos> Nick, how did you know that this was my car?<eos> I didn't.
Thought i'd come by.<eos> You can take some more shots at me In case you didn't get your fill today.<eos> What time's your flight?<eos> Don't have a flight.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Taking a train to vancouver?<eos> I'm not taking the train. Look, i only told you about the offer to give you an out.<eos> Giving me an out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> I never did, okay?
- Is Mom with you?<eos> - No, she's coming up later.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Look, I know it's no secret that your mom and I have been having problems.<eos> I just want you to know that no matter what happens with us, you will always be my daughter.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's a miracle that you survived us.<eos> You must be some superhuman kid.<eos> You know how much your mom and I love you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Are you in New York?<eos> Well, when are you coming back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honey, I know that this is a difficult time, but it is so important that you know, from the bottom of my heart, I will never, ever be called Grandma.<eos> Lavon:<eos> Hey. Nice ruffles.<eos> Yeah, the things we do for love.<eos> Yep! The things we do.<eos> So how'd it go last night?<eos> Well, it didn't.
Okay. But I... loosened it for you.<eos> You did.<eos> Take care, A.B.<eos> Hey, this is fun.<eos> And thanks for the food.<eos> Oh, and I broke up with Davis 'cause I still love you.<eos> Good night.<eos> George, do you think what we had, that we'll... find it with other people?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
- Who is it, Craig?<eos> Oh, it's Mr. McGill.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Oh, I love what you've done with the place.<eos> Last time I was here, it was well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.<eos> - Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.<eos> But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<eos> We told you, there will be no deal.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Hey, why do you think I'm stealing the silver?<eos> Hey, maybe... in the spirit of, uh... human struggle... we say bygones-- you let me get back in my car and drive away.<eos> Do you know what the definition of the word "sovereignty" is?<eos> What am I?<eos> The professor from "Gilligan's Island"?<eos> Sovereignty is absolute power and authority.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which is who I am-- your king.<eos> It's America, brother.<eos> We don't do kings.

- It's OK.<eos> - Relax.<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.<eos> - Please, please, no.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - You are OK.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please don't.
Yeah, thanks. Didn't hear you come in.<eos> Yeah, it was late, and I didn't want to wake you.<eos> What did Cornell want this time?<eos> Just...<eos> More questions, and...<eos> I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
How are we getting out of here?<eos> Huh?<eos> I have an idea but you are not gonna like it<eos> Go, come on<eos> Yah! Come on! Come on!<eos> Woah fucked!<eos> Bring it down!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Hey, how you doing?
It's your life, Mikey.<eos> I'm willing to screw up a lot of things, but not that.<eos> I'm touched. - Weapons down!<eos> Get in!<eos> What did she say, Julia?<eos> Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
I don't know how long it lasted.<eos> - Something went down.<eos> - If you say so.<eos> Uh, I didn't hear anything about it.<eos> Could've been the president was called away.<eos> - That happens all the time.<eos> - Not this time.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Clearly, I have a source that knows more than you.<eos> Most sources do.
It's all a bit of a blur.<eos> What did you drink in school?<eos> Hurricanes?<eos> Oh, we weren't barbarians.<eos> Scotch, no ice.<eos> Two Chivas, neat.<eos> Cubans.<eos> Smuggled in.<eos> I thought you might appreciate the irony.<eos> I do.
It was legal, it was necessary, and it was right.<eos> Heather Dunbar?<eos> She's never run for office.<eos> You don't become Solicitor General without being politically savvy.<eos> It takes more than savvy to be elected president.<eos> Don't forget, she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.<eos> Truth and justice personified.<eos> If the leadership wants to redefine the party, she's--<eos> No one with this little experience has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot, and at least he had the money.<eos> So does she.
I keep those relationships private so no one will suspect any bias toward me.<eos> But Robert and I are very close.<eos> He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.<eos> So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?<eos> He told me the day he was diagnosed.<eos> I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, my God! (both laughing)<eos> Jesus!<eos> Come on, put your dick away.<eos> Let's go eat, 'cause we're not "this" anymore.<eos> This is not-- No.<eos> I love this place.<eos> I love, like, old, Italian-y places.<eos> If you, uh, go in the bathroom, there's a gun behind the toilet.<eos> (opera playing in background) Do you wanna have a sleepover tonight?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
But, guess what?<eos> I love you, right now.<eos> And tonight, we're gonna have a sleepover.<eos> And then, tomorrow, we're gonna be in our own places and use our own showers and play with all our own things.<eos> And then what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I do know that if we move in together, nobody is gonna love anybody anymore, guaranteed.<eos> You know this.<eos> Don't you know this?<eos> Yeah, I do and...
You just sneak it in-- Don't you--<eos> Don't move! Son of a bitch!<eos> Right.<eos> Don't you move!<eos> And that's it. Usually the guy will just-- He'll just--<eos> He'll give up and that's the end of it and most of the time you don't even have to do that, but sometimes you get in their face hard, you know?<eos> Hard, fast.<eos> I never give a shit if they're winning or losing, we're going to a Knicks game, world's most famous arena, it's gonna be cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How you doing, pal.
I don't think I need all-- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'm putting on a base, it has to be even.<eos> It's gonna look good.<eos> This is fun.<eos> You have really nice skin. You're lucky.<eos> Okay, can we just...?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, wait a minute, what is that?<eos> No, no, no, you need this.<eos> No, I don't.
Why did you come here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
We're in here.<eos> We're playing sculptor.<eos> She's Michel-angelina.<eos> - How's work?<eos> - Oh, you know. Work.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Kid's a dream.<eos> She's easy.<eos> And you better stay that way.<eos> How you doing, sweetie, huh?
Could two men alone build the Brooklyn Bridge?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But it would take forever.<eos> Just how long do you think the residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?<eos> Referring this case to HHM is for the good of the clients.<eos> That argument you won today against the restraining order... the judge was never gonna grant that.<eos> Schweikart is throwing softballs. And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<eos> We'll be busy swatting them away, we'll never spend time on the actual case.<eos> This case will span years. And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<eos> We simply don't.
Well, you should get some sleep.<eos> It's late over there.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hold off on the vote?<eos> Until we sit down.<eos> But we keep it in our back pocket.<eos> Michael Corrigan?<eos> They're going to release him when we visit.<eos> You made a miracle happen.<eos> We did.
I mean, he's not being intransigent, he's just... he's not your friend.<eos> He doesn't know anything about you.<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> Please.<eos> Good boy... That's a boy.<eos> God!<eos> What's going on?<eos> How you doing, hmm?<eos> How's it going?<eos> How you doing?
- I'm pregnant.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Well, you're getting an abortion tomorrow.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I love him.<eos> - You don't.
Male voice: ¶ can you hear me now, can you hear me now?<eos> ¶ ¶ i'm singing out as loud as i know how ¶<eos> I promise i am not looking at anyone or anything.<eos> I just am looking...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> And... ¶ oh... ¶<eos> Oh, my god, sam, you hear it, too?<eos> Yeah, is it like a high-pitched ringing But only in your left ear?<eos> Because yes, i do, all the time.
Yep, and I'm putting 'em on your tab.<eos> I know. I saw that.<eos> I know I blindsided you this morning, and I am gonna be apologizing to you for that for a very long time.<eos> But I really do hope that we can try to deal with this privately between us.<eos> Privately?<eos> We... we can't do that.<eos> 'Cause we're Ruke or Layna or whatever the hell we are.<eos> And no offense, but I respect your right to call off the wedding.<eos> The least you could do is respect my right to be extremely pissed off about it.<eos> I do. I do.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, wait. I've got one more thing for him.<eos> - Hello? - Hey.<eos> So, I just spoke with the chief of police.<eos> Layla took full responsibility for her actions.<eos> No charges are being filed.<eos> She didn't say where she got the pills?<eos> Says she brought them from home.<eos> She did?
Love you, too, dad.<eos> So, uh, the Edgehill student recording program...<eos> It's the only thing that makes school worth going to.<eos> I'd argue that an education's another good reason.<eos> Not when all you wanna do is just make music.<eos> So is that... is that really what you wanna do?<eos> Sing professionally?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Because I know what your mom thinks about it.<eos> Yeah, the same thing all of you do.
I mean I've already put you through more than enough pain - with all my mistakes.<eos> - That's behind us.<eos> And I will be damned if I'm gonna drag you through all the hurt and the disappointment... look at the pity in your eyes.<eos> Look in my eyes.<eos> That's not pity.<eos> It's love.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> This is how it has to be. I made up my mind.<eos> Well, you don't get to just make up your mind...<eos> I do...
And I will be damned if I'm gonna drag you through all the hurt and the disappointment... look at the pity in your eyes.<eos> Look in my eyes.<eos> That's not pity.<eos> It's love.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> This is how it has to be. I made up my mind.<eos> Well, you don't get to just make up your mind...<eos> I do...<eos> I do, Rayna.<eos> I do.
I'm just... so proud of you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Without you, I don't think I could have gotten back up there, you know?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Hmm? [Laughing] Oh, my god!<eos> Caleb!<eos> - [Laughs]<eos> - Hey. Why didn't you call?<eos> I wanted to surprise you.<eos> Well, y... you did.
I mean, all that guy's seen is that damn video.<eos> - He's never even seen us play! - He's right.<eos> Okay, new plan.<eos> We put on a show featuring Triple Exes, and invite him to come hear us play live.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hey, after that interview, I'm happy to let the music do the talking.<eos> I gotta say, I'm still really disappointed about that Jade St. John concert.<eos> I wish we could go...<eos> Mom, I told you, I already had plans.<eos> Yes, you did.
- Yes.<eos> They have.<eos> - This is great.<eos> Good job, Mike.<eos> Keep me informed.<eos> See you at the office.<eos> You with.<eos> Disrupts this you?<eos> That our guy just jumps out the window.<eos> - Yes it does.
Tell us now!<eos> Where?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - On the meadow.<eos> Behind the boathouse.<eos> There are flowers there. The lilies.<eos> She is at the boathouse.<eos> There are flowers there.<eos> You promised to help me.<eos> I did not actually.
I'm a stubborn bastard.<eos> Now let's cut to the Chase.<eos> What, uh... what's it gonna take to get you back?<eos> 20% raise.<eos> Done.<eos> A partnership track.<eos> Done.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Not done.
We've already got you back in the system.<eos> Oh. And since Jenny and I are now friends, I went ahead and made you your brand-new I.D. Badge as a peace offering.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Why am I bald and wearing a turtleneck?<eos> Okay.<eos> That's real nice.<eos> You got the smiley one.<eos> Well, did somebody say, "drinks on Brody"?<eos> I did.
I don't mind playing house, but as long as your mother and Kevin are away, why don't you call in sick?<eos> Let me take you to Bermuda.<eos> No.<eos> Cape Cod?<eos> I don't want to go anywhere I don't want to go.<eos> Don't make plans for me.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
- We need to get you laid.<eos> - Oh, my God, yes.<eos> Dan doesn't count, because that was a felonious lay.<eos> - Felonious?<eos> - Lyla, are you not having sex?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - Lyla...<eos> Talk about why you two hate each other exactly.<eos> I don't--we don't hate each other.<eos> - We don't.
You worked on the Fortescue Estate.<eos> There was a lake there, I believe.<eos> And what were you designing for Lord Fortescue?<eos> Oh, I... I can't remember.<eos> You must remember.<eos> Let me think...<eos> What was it?<eos> That's it.<eos> A palm house. You built a ballroom.<eos> Mr. Tom Gerrard did anyway.
Oh, while I was there the most confusing thing happened.<eos> I saw a man who looked exactly like your architect friend, coming out of the jeweller's.<eos> He had the same unfortunate, abrupt manner.<eos> But they called him Mr. Paignton.<eos> Well, no wonder you're confused.<eos> Our architect's Mr. Gerrard.<eos> Well, that's what I remembered.<eos> Well, it's a simple mistake to make.<eos> And surely, he corrected you when you addressed him?<eos> Oh, I didn't.
Saying no is not as hard as taking the call.<eos> Have you seen her since-- Once.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> I can't even look at her now without thinking she might've had something to do with what happened to my mom.<eos> That building, where the student union is, that's the original college.<eos> Founding father Eustace Ballard laid the first brick of foundation himself.<eos> I can show you a plaque carved in wood from Mr. Ballard's outhouse.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did I mention Ballard was also a minister?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Well, all right.<eos> That's great.<eos> You kids want some candy?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Depends, I guess.<eos> Depends on what?<eos> Chunky chocolate, Taffy bits, marshmallows?<eos> You... you don't know if you like that stuff?<eos> - I know I do.<eos> - Course you do.
No emotions on a battlefield.<eos> Yes ma'am.<eos> No ma'am.<eos> Doubt.<eos> Kill.<eos> Repeat.<eos> Word of advice:<eos> Sometimes it can take centuries to figure it out.<eos> When did people stop hurting you?<eos> They didn't.
And you still think you have a winning hand?<eos> I was once a man of status.<eos> A respected figure.<eos> Now I am hounded out of my own country.<eos> Believe me, I have no hand to play.<eos> Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> - Because I had no choice!<eos> - More games.<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.
Shh, you were dreaming.<eos> I've never felt anything like it before.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> God granted you a prophecy.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I hope you're wrong.<eos> We can't reject the truth when it is revealed.<eos> He's insisting that we move him somewhere safer.<eos> He knows where I am.<eos> Who does?
- What's going on?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> We need to call poison control.<eos> Why?<eos> No, we need paramedics.<eos> No.<eos> Parents, we should call the parents, actually.<eos> - Okay, did they--
Minx?<eos> I made some snacks for you and Henry.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Upstairs?<eos> Kids?<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, my goodness, you gave me a fright!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.<eos> Didn't you hear me calling?<eos> No, I didn't.
- You're out of your mind.<eos> What was all that talk just then?<eos> Mutual respect is all.<eos> Is this why you brought me out here?<eos> To show me a good time hoping I'd give you something back for all that you've done?<eos> Is that why you've done it all in the first place?<eos> - Was that your game?<eos> - Hey, this isn't a game.<eos> I got feelings for you, Harry. As much as just said so as did you about me.<eos> I certainly didn't.
I don't know.<eos> Abby.<eos> Abby, this is a chance to cure you.<eos> You know, it would give you your life back.<eos> But can you be sure it won't take my life instead?<eos> No.<eos> I can't.<eos> My father... tended to Secretary of State Seward on the night Lincoln was shot.<eos> Did you know he was attacked, too?<eos> I didn't.
I'll definitely have some.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cigars and scotch.<eos> This is a first for us.<eos> I suppose I should have done this with you sooner.<eos> You're a man now.<eos> And you'll need to be as I have good reason for having you here for a talk.<eos> You do?<eos> You noticed your mother struggling at dinner.<eos> Yes, I did.
Lise Friise Andersen.<eos> If your colleagues threw your coat in the toilet - would you also just regret that it happened?<eos> - They are adults in a workplace.<eos> - This is my daughter's workplace.<eos> That they are children does not excuse this behavior. No, of course not.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> I will talk to the teachers and remind the students about our zero tolerance...<eos> Why should you talk to all of the students?<eos> - We don't know who it was.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
I know.<eos> Oh, where on earth is your daddy, baby James?<eos> I thought you found the daddy.<eos> There's all sorts of forms and paperwork he needs to sort out, and he knows it - he should be in here.<eos> Does he want the kid?<eos> He said he did.<eos> I can't stall the adoption process forever, so...<eos> You like them?<eos> Babies?<eos> Yeah. Doesn't everyone?
Robert - out.<eos> The girls have had a long day.<eos> And, Pattie, here's something for you.<eos> I don't need to tell you what's in this box.<eos> Oh.. it's arrived!<eos> Take a look.<eos> Oh, Robert, come on. Shoo!<eos> You're not allowed to see.<eos> They don't want me here.<eos> Of course they do!
- Danny, where are you?<eos> - Oh, honey, I wanna talk to him.<eos> - Yeah, let Mom--<eos> Listen, I wanna help you, but you have to turn yourself in first.<eos> You've got a big decision you gotta make here.<eos> I understand.<eos> Listen, Danny... you either run, or you talk to the feds and face the music.<eos> See you back at the house.<eos> Did he say where he was?<eos> No, he didn't.
I hope you're well, Doctor.<eos> I'm doing better than Jim Marsh.<eos> Why?<eos> Is he ill?<eos> He's injured.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I heard you were involved.<eos> Jim'd blame me for the weather if he could get away with it.<eos> When I met your daughter I didn't really understand why she was so afraid of you.<eos> Now I do.
He doesn't usually work at night.<eos> It wasn't at work.<eos> Did you sleep with Patrick?<eos> Wow. I did not see that one coming.<eos> It's done with now.<eos> Ships scraping hulls in the night.<eos> But why would you do that?<eos> Same reason you did, I suppose.<eos> Did he tell you?<eos> No, his wife did.
I'm here in connection with the job.<eos> Aksel.<eos> You've been so nice.<eos> Did you hurt yourself?<eos> No, it's nothing.<eos> Shall we go inside?<eos> No. We can not go in.<eos> -Broren is at work.<eos> -It does not matter.<eos> Yes, it does something.
It's a prayer vigil.<eos> People in mourning get thirsty.<eos> Em, your mom's tight with the Sheriff, right?<eos> Do you know if they went through Nina's laptop?<eos> My mom just handles the autopsy.<eos> I can't believe Nina's just a body now.<eos> It kind of always was just a body, but top-shelf all the way.<eos> - Hey, man, have some respect.<eos> - I have extreme respect.<eos> And so did most of the basketball team.
~ They're coming.<eos> ~ OK, just follow my lead, all right?<eos> ~ Hey! Massive congratulations, pal.<eos> ~ You both having a good time, yeah?<eos> ~ Yeah, great.<eos> Yeah. ~ Amazing.<eos> This is Frank.<eos> I'm Becky.<eos> It's just me and the wife can't work out how we know you.<eos> Well, you don't, actually.
He claims he was fired because he knows the real reason for the crash.<eos> And what was the real reason?<eos> He wouldn't tell me. Well, what did he tell you?<eos> Enough for me to know it would be unethical if somebody didn't look into this.<eos> But you can't, so you want me to get Harvey to.<eos> Well, you convinced him to look into my case when he didn't want to, didn't you?<eos> This is different. We don't take cases like this.<eos> Maybe, but I believe a man who can convince Harvey to hire someone who never went to law school could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> No, he didn't.
- I did.<eos> I take it you heard about Liberty Rail.<eos> - I did.<eos> - See?<eos> No harm, no foul, no mass exodus of clients.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> What's on your mind, Jessica? You don't seem--<eos> I know you told Scottie about Mike Ross.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I didn't till just now.
~ Big frumley-dimwit is only going to say what he's told to.<eos> ~ He needs social services. He won't have them, will he?<eos> "Shane looks after me."<eos> Shane's his problem.<eos> If we could just get him to talk...<eos> If we push him now, Shane's toy solicitor is only going to scream undue pressure.<eos> Let's wait and see.<eos> And if Kieran wakes up, there's your witness.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> What if he doesn't?
So I helped him over the wall but I didn't want to kick him.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> So why did you?<eos> He said I had to.<eos> He said I had to or he'd throw me out, and I can't... I can't go back out there.<eos> The people move so fast, it's scary, I can't go back out there.<eos> Just take a moment, OK?<eos> Do you want to stop?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
She wouldn't, she... She couldn't.<eos> OK, Doctor.<eos> OK, you go to prison and protect the person you think cares for you.<eos> Miss Winston, she tried to blame your brother.<eos> She won't come and visit you in prison, and she won't be there waiting for you when you come out.<eos> You want to knock years off your jail sentence, then, Gazelle, I'm begging you, talk to me.<eos> There's just one last question, which people will ask behind your back, so allow me to say it to your face.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Come on, you must have known.<eos> Course you did.
Where is he, then? No.<eos> Not until I have your assurance that you will accept him as your own.<eos> How do I know he won't have a dagger for me?<eos> Because you are his father, and if you act like his father, he will embrace you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The way to his heart is through tenderness and love.<eos> Way to his heart?<eos> I am King!<eos> I don't need to woo my blood!<eos> Yes, you do.
I thought the gods had brought us together to try to stop my vision of the apocalypse, but now it seems we're actually making it happen.<eos> You have to get us in there so we can try and stop him.<eos> Only if I can have the ring when we do.<eos> Look at you... in your peasant's tunic.<eos> You're no son of a King.<eos> Take him the ring! He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
What do you make of it?<eos> It's the temple on Mount Pelion.<eos> Its wings are said to touch the sky.<eos> The next full moon is in four days, and he wants to meet at sunset.<eos> Tell me she isn't useful.<eos> How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
Your cousin divides opinion.<eos> Some think him arrogant.<eos> Others observe a sense of... entitlement.<eos> ~ To what?<eos> ~ Whatever takes his fancy.<eos> But perhaps they misjudge him.<eos> So, what do I hear of his latest venture?<eos> The venture is small, so overheads will be low.<eos> Without Reath, supply to the markets will fall, so the price of copper should rise.<eos> And if it doesn't?
It's Kevin.<eos> You're John, right?<eos> Right. Right.<eos> This is Erika. - Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi, Erika.<eos> How are you?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Evie, Michael, introduce yourselves.<eos> - How you doing?
NARRATOR: Previously on Rogue...<eos> I know you killed them.<eos> Those three American soldiers did not die in a helicopter crash.<eos> I know you were in the Swat Valley.<eos> The same place that those Special Ops soldiers delivered 10 million in cash to a warlord named Massoud.<eos> I know that you robbed them and I know that you executed them.<eos> ETHAN: And you think I'm capable of that?<eos> Yeah. Actually, I do.
And now it's yours.<eos> Come on, I can wash it. Ah, thanks, but anything you put your penis in belongs to you.<eos> So why you home so early, birthday boy?<eos> I wanted time to hang my Restaurateur of Tomorrow plaque.<eos> I'm gonna buy some birthday jeans and then check on the restaurant before my surprise party.<eos> That is a fantastic idea, 'cause the whole place has just been falling apart since you been gone.<eos> In fact, you should probably head over there right now.<eos> There could be a fire.<eos> - I mean, who knows?<eos> You don't. - All right. Well, well, well.
I wanna be more than just friends.<eos> You look amazing tonight, Greta.<eos> I wanna touch you all over.<eos> I wanna touch you and kiss you and make sweet, sweet love.<eos> This isn't happening, you're not Elliott!<eos> Listen to your new song, Greta.<eos> Feel it in your heart.<eos> Feel it in your body.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Yes, you do.

Did he come here?<eos> I just want to help him.<eos> I'm not here as a cop right now.<eos> Well, maybe Walt doesn't know that.<eos> That's what he said?<eos> I didn't talk to him.<eos> Dave, I can get your phone records.<eos> I can see who called here and for how long. I thought you said you weren't a cop, right...<eos> Did he say where he was going?<eos> - Mr. Hodiak, I don't...
You don't know what I want.<eos> Don't I?<eos> No.<eos> OK, I don't know what is going on here, if... if I am totally losing my mind, or if one of the gods or goddesses is angry with me and has sent a demon.<eos> A dangerous pervert demon who never seems to have any clothes on.<eos> - Germans are not so uptight about nudity.<eos> - Mm. This is not about nudity, OK?<eos> This is... This is about decency. It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.
Don't I?<eos> No.<eos> OK, I don't know what is going on here, if... if I am totally losing my mind, or if one of the gods or goddesses is angry with me and has sent a demon.<eos> A dangerous pervert demon who never seems to have any clothes on.<eos> - Germans are not so uptight about nudity.<eos> - Mm.

I-i need help.<eos> I-i need help! I need... I need help!<eos> Get a doctor!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need help. He's breathing.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> - Do something!
I-i need help! I need... I need help!<eos> Get a doctor!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need help. He's breathing.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> - Do something!<eos> - Sir! Do something!
You know, thatjudge, he lives in Westchester.<eos> And Sussman and them lawyers, they live where they do.<eos> You know, I'm guessing you got yourself a nice little place in Manhattan somewhere, or Park Slope? Am I right?<eos> But, you see, we live here.<eos> And when I pick up a copy of The New York Times and I read what you are writing about me, and about this kid mayor who's gone all wet, and about the housing thing, I know that it's got nothing to do with what's going on here.<eos> And what's going on?<eos> People working for their homes, for their neighborhoods.<eos> They want to keep what they have.<eos> And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? (SCOFFING)<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sorry.<eos> Okay, I understand there are new developments.<eos> We have a crew standing by live.<eos> So, now we'll be going to Martinelli campaign headquarters, where the former mayor is now addressing supporters.<eos> I wanna thank everybody who volunteered not only for this campaign, but for all my campaigns.<eos> - It has been a real honor to serve six terms.<eos> - Oy vey.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You gave it one last run, Angelo.<eos> - I did, didn't I?
GBI's gonna send divers in the morning.<eos> Ms. Person. I don't have an agenda.<eos> That's a good place to start, Sheriff.<eos> No, I mean I don't plan to confer with the senator about the investigation.<eos> How's he gonna feel about that?<eos> That's his business.<eos> This isn't.<eos> Did they find George's car?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
You'll have a support system there. That's what they do...<eos> Help manage.<eos> And I'm a phone call away, always.<eos> And, speaking of money... Here is your checkbook.<eos> And... your ATM card.<eos> Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
Dad's using it to launch Hakeem.<eos> He's completely crazy about it right now.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> For most people, canceling a doctor's appointment is just lazy.<eos> But for someone who's bipolar, it's life-threatening.<eos> And... your life... Is mine.<eos> I'll go. Oh.<eos> You should tell your mother that Hakeem is performing at Laviticus.<eos> She'll try to sabotage it.<eos> Already did.
Don't you think it'd be better if, you know, you stayed with them?<eos> - Why, because I have breasts?<eos> - Sorta?<eos> - Wait, is that like a trick question?<eos> - They like you, OK?<eos> You're a big... muscle-y distraction, and we need that right now.<eos> Look, our warrant is for Constance, remember?<eos> And when it comes down to it, she's the one we need to save.<eos> How do you think the others will react when they figure that bit out?<eos> No idea. Neither do you.
It was this big.<eos> I don't really know what I'm gonna get.<eos> I'm probably just gonna get a beer.<eos> Yeah, so many choices.<eos> I think me too.<eos> So your profile says you're into gardening.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just something I used to do with my mom.<eos> I should probably know what these are, but I have no clue.<eos> I definitely don't.
Dorothy cuda.<eos> Wow. You look great.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How are you?<eos> -Really good.<eos> -Good.<eos> Yeah. How are you?<eos> Good. I'm good.<eos> I'm gay now. In case my mom didn't tell everybody.<eos> She did.
-I'm sure.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Is it true, you shoved a sausage down your...<eos> Yep.<eos> Yep.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -I did that.<eos> Happens to everybody.<eos> Right?<eos> Does it?
It could have been a neighbor that killed Tom?<eos> Well...<eos> The press know even less than the police do.<eos> They just make things up as they go along...<eos> Hurting innocent people, ruining lives.<eos> Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
Wait.<eos> I'm...<eos> Dr. Hart.<eos> Uh, Mrs. Kincaid, what... what are you doing here?<eos> Uh, I was hoping to... um, to talk with Dr. Breeland.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He told you who I am?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
- Guys, guys!<eos> - Human shields, you ever heard of those?<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> - Call the guards.<eos> He'll take the first few bullets. Hey!<eos> Enough!<eos> I'm ready to talk, but only to your captain.<eos> I'm ready to talk.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Amos. Do it.
There were more than we thought.<eos> They were taking inventory.<eos> I leaked to DeGraaf that Mars was giving stealth tech to the OPA.<eos> He did what I thought he would.<eos> The spike in chatter was panic.<eos> They were calling to see if anything was missing.<eos> And since they had to ask, it means that they didn't give it to anyone.<eos> Which means that Mars isn't working with the OPA or trying to take control of Ceres.<eos> They didn't destroy the Canterbury.<eos> Then who did?
You know, there is no religious directive on file, so, okay if I recycle him?<eos> Factory on 30 needs some fertilizer.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'd like to know what the hell Holden is discussing with the Captain right now.<eos> For all we know, he could be working out a deal.<eos> Yeah, for himself.<eos> LOPEZ: The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
~ Hannibal<eos> - Season 3 Episode 2 ~<eos> ~ resync:<eos> Movie THX to:<eos> Italian Subs Addicted:<eos> They told me he knew exactly how to cut me.<eos> They said it was surgical.<eos> He wanted us to live.<eos> He left us to die.<eos> But we didn't.
To find the inspiration il Mostro used was a triumph.<eos> I went to the Uffizi and stood before the original Primavera... day after day and most days...<eos> I'd see a young Lithuanian man... as transfixed by the Botticelli as I was;<eos> as transfixed as I imagined il Mostro would be.<eos> And every day I saw him... he would recreate Primavera in pencil, just as he did in flesh.<eos> I knew.<eos> It was the best moment of my life, a moment of epiphany... that made me famous... and then ruined me.<eos> In haste and the heat of ambition, the Questura nearly destroyed the young man's home... trying to find evidence.<eos> - He doesn't leave evidence.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
head, hands, arms, and legs.<eos> A topiary.<eos> This is my design.<eos> A valentine written on a broken man.<eos> Will...<eos> I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his, uh... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
Thirsty.<eos> Feel well enough for a visitor?<eos> Hello, Frederick.<eos> You were expecting someone else?<eos> I was hoping for someone else.<eos> He knew exactly how to cut you.<eos> They said it was surgical.<eos> He wanted you to live.<eos> He left us to die.<eos> But we didn't.
Th-there is no possible way that-that...<eos> Right?<eos> Blaine?<eos> I don't know, I-I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> What Burt and Carole were talking about earlier, and these last few months without you have been really...<eos> I love you, Kurt.<eos> I mean, I love you, I-I do, I...<eos> This is crazy, this is crazy.<eos> And I don't...
Yeah, just let me call over there, straighten this thing out.<eos> Yeah, so it's Tuesday.<eos> Figure we'd agree Friday.<eos> If you don't got the money, I'll go ahead and sell to him.<eos> The other buyer.<eos> Like I said, he's up in Sleepy Eye.<eos> Take a look at that grinder, will ya?<eos> It's making a funny noise.<eos> Jeez, hon. Where's your coat?<eos> Hon, did...
I thought about it, and I think I should.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> - So happy. - What seminar?<eos> It's called lifespring.<eos> I did it last year in mankato.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - Oh. Yeah, and I just, you know, I want to be the best me I can be, ya know?<eos> Constance:<eos> Good for you. What did ed say when you asked him?<eos> You didn't, did you?
I triangulated the GPS on your phone.<eos> Seriously?<eos> No, I just always wanted to say that.<eos> You used the company card.<eos> Mind if I come in?<eos> Uh... sure.<eos> And also, do you mind telling me what the hell you're doing in Houston?<eos> It doesn't matter now. No, I think it does matter.<eos> I just drove 14 hours to get here.<eos> No, it doesn't, okay?
When there's important guests, we sing and get to wear our Sunday best.<eos> And suddenly, there was dieter.<eos> When was that?<eos> Two... no, three.<eos> Three years ago.<eos> Three years ago?<eos> And since then?<eos> We are in love.<eos> Yes, but when do you see each other?<eos> We don't.
And even after all the crazy things that I've been through, that was the worst.<eos> That's when I needed you most.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm truly sorry that I wasn't there for you, but we have a problem...<eos> Klaus.<eos> What else is new?<eos> Kol told me that you guys were working on a weapon to use against him.<eos> Rebekah heard that it was a dagger, one that would work even on Klaus.<eos> I need to know if you finished it.<eos> - And what if we did?
Rebekah assures me that this will work, and I trust her far more than I trust you.<eos> I am not your enemy, Elijah. We shall see.<eos> Proceed with your preparations.<eos> I ain't seen a spell like that in a long time.<eos> It's pretty brave for someone so young, even a harvest girl.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Ha ha! Well, I mean, that's a loaded question for me, but you seem to be exactly where you supposed to be.<eos> Are you sure you can do this on your own?<eos> Don't remember asking for help.<eos> No. You didn't.
I'm fine.<eos> Are you ready to leave?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> Is this supposed to make up for me missing your adolescence, this routine of listening and then disobeying me?<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> You told me that we were in danger.<eos> You even told me who was after us.<eos> But what you didn't tell me is why.<eos> Yes, I did.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> 'Cause you got that crease between your eyebrows that tells me things most definitely are not.<eos> Something awful has happened.<eos> And I-- I need a favor.<eos> A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked me for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> Don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does, but both of us.
I killed Sara.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing, ok? It wasn't me.<eos> I'm so sorry, Laurel.<eos> If Merlyn drugged you... then it wasn't your fault.<eos> But how could you work with him?<eos> How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Thea?<eos> The door was open.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your staring into nothingness.<eos> He should have let me die.<eos> That was never an option.<eos> That's why I love him.<eos> I didn't know... about you and my brother.<eos> Yeah, well... It was complicated.<eos> But I did love him.<eos> Despite everything, I still do.
A...<eos> N...<eos> N...<eos> A...!<eos> Making today a perfect day for you.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Making today a happy day and no feeling blue.<eos> - I love you baby!<eos> For everything you are to us, and all that you do.<eos> I do.
You are in.<eos> - Really? - Mmm.<eos> - *<eos> - It wasn't easy.<eos> He's not supposed to give me that.<eos> That is my impossible request.<eos> That is the insane thing I push for but then reluctantly give up in favor of what would actually break this deal... My nuclear submarine.<eos> Did he mention my sub?<eos> Mm-hmm, he did.<eos> Yes, he did.
Owen Thorne fell to his death from the top of Eastgate car park.<eos> Now, there's some indication he encountered an as yet unidentified person or persons shortly before his death.<eos> Now, the trajectory of his fall suggests he fell backwards.<eos> But his injuries are not conclusive with him having been pushed. But until we know otherwise, we're treating his death as suspicious.<eos> Now, have we got a less grisly photo?<eos> Something that gives a sense of the man...<eos> Selfie from the daughter.<eos> Taken and posted on social media about 20 minutes before death.<eos> Well, he looks happy enough, doesn't he?<eos> They both do.
I said I'd clock him in anyhow, so he wouldn't have to use his leave.<eos> I know it's wrong.<eos> I just thought I was turning a blind eye.<eos> He was usually reliable.<eos> We heard he was slacking off.<eos> If he was, I had not picked up on it.<eos> Mm. So you went into the system and falsified the checks?<eos> He said he'd done it, just hadn't had time to log it.<eos> - Do you still believe that?<eos> - I did.
They're just sick.<eos> It's sad.<eos> And for what, huh?<eos> How the hell is it worth the risk to do that?<eos> You know what I realized trying to understand people?<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't try to understand 'em.<eos> I know what I'd kill for and what I'd die for.<eos> You served.<eos> You do too.
You would've sent an innocent man to jail.<eos> No. (stuttering) you've been a slug for months,<eos> And this... This is the thing That gets you off of your ass?<eos> Not your family, not your fiance,<eos> Proving me wrong!<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!<eos> (scoffs) I get that you had to do what you think is right, But you could at least feel bad about it.<eos> You just massively derailed my career And you don't even care, do you?<eos> Yeah, you don't.
Oh, we're great, thanks.<eos> Julie's loving the new house.<eos> Lots more room for the boys to play. - Oh.<eos> Well...<eos> - Seriously?<eos> That was excellent.<eos> I knew you could do it.<eos> Good job, bud!<eos> Oh, I-I'm sure I mentioned it.<eos> - You didn't.
I'll warm you up.<eos> May I?<eos> I'm going home tomorrow.<eos> Why? You can stay as long as you like, at least until they kick me out.<eos> Who'll kick you out?<eos> No, I just meant it... as a joke.<eos> I feel good here with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Can I say something stupid?<eos> I do it all the time!
You were happy to smoke it all away.<eos> I loved you.<eos> Oh, give me a break.<eos> You used me.<eos> You treated me like crap.<eos> It's never been fair.<eos> You always get what you want.<eos> Then you act like it's normal.<eos> Like reality doesn't count.<eos> And it never does.
I just heard from Zhao and we are a go.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will lose your job for this, won't you?<eos> Probably.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Deservedly.<eos> Thank you, Alex.<eos> I like this new man.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - Yes. I did.
Asian.<eos> Well, could be worse.<eos> One more person I have to justify myself to.<eos> You don't have to justify anything.<eos> I used to see... grieving mothers on TV going after whoever they thought was responsible.<eos> I would think, "I get it. You're upset, but don't be crazy.<eos> Don't act crazy."<eos> There's nothing crazy about believing no one cares as much about my son and what happened to him as I do.<eos> The police don't.<eos> The lawyers don't.
Do you know what size Marilyn Monroe was?<eos> - She was an eight!<eos> - So? - Amy's a six.<eos> - I don't give a damn!<eos> - Do you have a reasonable chub?<eos> - Get out of my face!<eos> - Do you have a reasonable chub?<eos> - No! Let's see it!<eos> Prove it!<eos> - He does.
But... then...<eos> What?<eos> Then what?<eos> I was an accountant, so I knew spreadsheets.<eos> I catalogued Dr. Murray's treatment protocol.<eos> Dr. Murray was obsessed with data.<eos> He wanted to prove to the medical community that they were wrong, That he had the answer to curing all disease... with sound.<eos> I know. It seems crazy, but that's what I saw happening.<eos> - Everyone got better.<eos> - But then someone didn't.
Do it.<eos> You're the only one who can.<eos> Bo.<eos> You are my child. My blood.<eos> I would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Bo, your hand.<eos> Nyx is gone.<eos> The bracelet worked.<eos> No. It didn't.
Still waiting to hear back...<eos> - including B.C.U.<eos> - I didn't know you were applying there!<eos> You know, I know people on the committee.<eos> - I can make a call for you.<eos> - That's a really nice offer, but I wanna go where I'm wanted.<eos> And if you call them, then it's not about me.<eos> I should go wash my hands before I dig in to these potato skins.<eos> Jane, we have to convince her to let me make the call.<eos> - No, we don't.
My name is Avery Ryan.<eos> I was a victim of cyber crime.<eos> Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer.<eos> Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was murdered.<eos> My investigation into her death led me to the FBI, where I joined a team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding on the Deep Web... infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined faceless... nameless... lurking inside our devices,<eos> Hi.<eos> Surprised I could get a ZoGo at this crazy hour.<eos> You guys still taking the online coupon?<eos> Hey, what'd you say your name was again?<eos> I didn't.
Well we're born alone and we die alone.<eos> That's pretty heartless.<eos> Heart is overrated.<eos> Or maybe you just say that 'cause somebody broke yours.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Let's just say I'm really good at reading people.<eos> Look, the point is... if this Maestro is so great maybe he can help you too.<eos> I'm okay, I'm fine.<eos> How did you know I don't like being alone?<eos> Because nobody does, not all the time.
Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your brother isn't here.<eos> Yeah, I know. I saw his truck wasn't here. I figured.<eos> Is this gonna be weird?<eos> No. No, it's not-<eos> - Well, yeah, it's gonna be a little weird, I guess.<eos> Listen, I have a question for you.<eos> Did you ever talk to my brother about you and me'?<eos> No, I didn't.
I know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was abandoned once.<eos> Cast aside by those who should've cared, but I stood up and fought back.<eos> And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I, can't just up and leave;<eos> I got obligations.<eos> You know, I got real feelings for AnnaBeth.<eos> And I could actually see a future there, so...<eos> You know, sometimes we just... we do things for the people that we care about.<eos> Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?<eos> - Because Wade does.
No, it's... it's one of my mother's aliases.<eos> My mother's our killer.<eos> You and Mathis conned Nick Shaw out of $2 million, each hiding your share in a different spot.<eos> And then you killed Mathis so you could take his cash.<eos> Only the anonymous tip screwed you up.<eos> And the police got to his money before you could.<eos> You know, Russ, I'm a little insulted you think I'm stupid enough to shoot a guy with my own gun and then dump the gun with the body.<eos> Well, who knew that you owned a gun? And who had access to it?<eos> And who knew your aliases?<eos> In answer to all three of those questions... she did.
Wes?<eos> I can't believe you'd do this, that you would take Sean without even having the guts to talk to me about it first.<eos> I didn't have any say in any of this.<eos> You sat there on the phone with me last night, asking me questions...<eos> I don't... I don't agree with how this was handled, but Sean is the only one with inside information about this thing.<eos> He's a person, not some object for you to have your scientist experiments on.<eos> They're your scientists, too, Claire.<eos> They work for all of us.<eos> This isn't some underground, mercenary operation. This is the sovereign, federal government of the United States of America trying to protect our children from a threat that we don't fully understand.<eos> But Sean does, Wes.
No.<eos> The man left. I heard the door slam, then it was quiet.<eos> You did a really good job remembering all that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is there a reason That your father didn't want your mother to know?<eos> He said it would just make her worry.<eos> Mm.<eos> Did you happen to get a look at the guy at the door?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Yes, actually, those are the people that want to come through the most.<eos> Because anybody who has unfinished business, those are the people that are like, "You know, I'm really sorry about that one time that I..."<eos> - I get people that...<eos> - "...came on your foot."<eos> - Yeah, or like abusers, right?<eos> - Yeah. Where did the whole crystal ball thing come from?<eos> - Gypsies, real gypsies.<eos> - Oh. And crystal ball is used... It's a technique called scrying.<eos> - And it's been used...<eos> - A guy did that to me in college.
Is that my healer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He looks old... kind of magical.<eos> Then again, all old people pretty much look that way, so...<eos> I don't know, dude. Is he supposed to be wearing a wizard hat?<eos> I just hope this guy can get all these Troubles the hell out of me.<eos> Howdy.<eos> We heard that we might be able to find someone here, uh... a healer.<eos> This look like a hospital to you?<eos> No, it doesn't.
It's her number!<eos> At the same exact time Sara reaches in to her purse to pay for a drink and pulls out the $5 bill with Jonathan's number on it.<eos> Destiny.<eos> They meet up again in central park and they kiss, just as that same little snowflake drifts gently down from heaven.<eos> Naw, bullshit.<eos> That is bullshit.<eos> No goddamn way that's the same snowflake!<eos> Respectfully, yes it was.<eos> So wait, you think like five winters ago, a snowflake fell to the ground, and, like, melted, then evaporated and shit, went back up to the sky, then turned back into the same exact snowflake,<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, Exeter's not been writing against the King.<eos> - You have. - Where?<eos> Show me?<eos> Your printers abroad, they're very good.<eos> They're working for me now.<eos> In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned, your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.<eos> Two weeks later, they dined with her again.<eos> I wonder what they discussed?<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
You rang my home and made my wife believe that it was our daughter Janet.<eos> Did I?<eos> Where's your 10 pence?<eos> Poltergeist took it again.<eos> Look, Janet, I know you're unhappy that we've produced this voice.<eos> You.<eos> I produced this voice.<eos> But it's a huge step forward.<eos> We have a name now.<eos> We do?
Man, hand to hand cash is the move when you're washing money.<eos> We learned from you and your car wash.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Ghost ain't never had a good idea he didn't steal from you.<eos> Hang on, man, I'll be right back.<eos> One player.<eos> How's it going, Victor?<eos> It's a good thing I don't pay you by the hour.<eos> Got molasses in my ass, boss.<eos> How we doing?
Lee, come on, man, you are a visionary.<eos> You're a hard worker.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> This deal takes debt off the table while giving you more cash to grow your business.<eos> You get to retain day-to-day control.<eos> Is it the best deal?<eos> Hell, no. But you and I both know you need a lifeline.<eos> That's what Stern is offering, a lifeline.<eos> You sign one of these?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Lie down, Frank.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't know, boy.<eos> I don't think them other kids like you.<eos> I don't think anybody does.<eos> Who the fuck wants some lanky loudmouth pissing in their ear, huh?<eos> Your mother sure didn't.
Can't you fix it?<eos> Bart.<eos> There's no point in trying to bring back what's gone.<eos> I am but a nun.<eos> Where'd you get all this money from?<eos> Again, rude.<eos> It's family money. Passed down from my father.<eos> But money isn't everything, Bart, Especially when you don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> You don't have any family?<eos> I did once, but not anymore.
What have you been telling my grandson?<eos> Nothing, Ma'am.<eos> How does he know about Malcolm?<eos> I don't know. I thought you--<eos> I don't pay you to think!<eos> I pay you to do!<eos> What have you told him?<eos> I've told him nothing, Ma'am.<eos> I believe he mentioned reading an old journal of Malcolm's. I assumed you gave it to him in an attempt to reveal the truth, as you said you would.<eos> I did no such thing.
Mine, since she passed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> - He cut her head off.<eos> This guy.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know his first name.<eos> Richard.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Oh, yeah, most around here do.
A woman that can be bought... isn't worth having.<eos> I'm partial to Italian.<eos> We agree on more than art.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Eat it, you little bastard.<eos> My mom wanted me to be a butcher, you know that?<eos> Oh, not the butcher story.<eos> I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer." I don't remember what I said next.<eos> No, you never do.
You here to gloat, Mr. Crawford?<eos> You compromised my lab and my cases... just to get back at me?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> What were you doing in the woods?<eos> This again?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> No, I don't.
Would that be okay, like, if they were to get hitched Or engaged or something?<eos> I would be honored To share my thunder with you, pal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Congratulations, lavon.<eos> We are just so happy to here as invited guests.<eos> I resent that.<eos> Will you tell us The proposal story again?<eos> You don't want to hear that again.<eos> We done told it so many times.<eos> Aw, yes, we do! Please! Please!
Oh, i am not paying for that. But i will help.<eos> Great, 'cause we got a ton of work to do.<eos> Five centimeters?<eos> Killing the game, baby.<eos> Did you ever think when we first met That we'd be having a baby together?<eos> Uh, no-- when we first met, i never thought i'd see you again.<eos> I thought you were spoiled, And i thought you were a brat.<eos> W...<eos> Yeah, well, i thought you were a jerk.<eos> I still do sometimes.
I don't see any other way.<eos> I mean, my life is in bluebell.<eos> Yours is in nashville.<eos> It's only been a couple of weeks and it's already too hard!<eos> It just doesn't matter, huh?<eos> It-it just, it-it doesn't matter that we-we want to be together?<eos> It doesn't matter that we have, like, we have great chemistry?<eos> It doesn't matter that i love you?<eos> Did you just say that you love me?<eos> Yes. I did.
So why was it rough this morning then?<eos> 'Cause I wanted it to be me.<eos> And, uh... 'Cause of what's coming next.<eos> They're gonna need to look into us. Nixon's people.<eos> They're gonna go deep.<eos> Into both of us.<eos> Into the firm, the whole damn thing.<eos> But once you told me manson was out, I took some steps.<eos> Padded the paychecks of a couple slobs at missing persons to call me in case anyone asked about that poor girl's file.<eos> This morning, someone did.
Even a lioness has to work.<eos> Here. Put these on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's good, Yael.<eos> You put the droppings in the basket, and then we use them to fertilize the fields.<eos> Do you have family here with you?<eos> Just my father and brother Amram.<eos> Amram's your brother?<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Yes. Everybody does.
I don't charge extra.<eos> You haven't told me your name.<eos> It's Colston.<eos> Mr Colston?<eos> Or Viscount?<eos> My Christian name is Leo.<eos> Really, it's Lionel, but everyone calls me Leo.<eos> Does Marian call you that?<eos> I noticed you were talking earlier.<eos> Yes, she does.
Oh, I have no loyalty to Rochefort.<eos> The man is insane.<eos> ~ I'll give you what you want.<eos> ~ With a hefty price tag, no doubt.<eos> Well, what else would you expect from a woman like me?<eos> You disgust me.<eos> Meanwhile, the King is bouncing another man's child on his knee.<eos> Your morality will not stand, Musketeer.<eos> ~ How do we know you won't betray us?<eos> ~ You don't.
Your emergency contact is down here as Savannah Davis -- is that correct?<eos> Hey, thanks for sitting for Scotty this morning.<eos> It really gave me a chance to help Marc out with some things.<eos> Now, there is a guy who can use all the help he can get.<eos> I think uncle Marc's cool.<eos> "Uncle Marc"?<eos> Yeah, he's not technically your...<eos> Fine.<eos> I don't see why you have a problem with him.<eos> No, I don't.
Karen...<eos> Don't go.<eos> Joss and I had a fight.<eos> She was emotional and I was... kind of a jerk.<eos> I-I'm telling you. I never got your text.<eos> How many more times do you want me to say it?<eos> No, but you can clearly see that I sent it, right?<eos> And when a text doesn't go through, you get that little red exclamation thingie,<eos> - which, as you can see...<eos> - You did not.
Was there physical contact?<eos> He took my pulse and held my hair while I puked.<eos> Oh, both chaste and disgusting.<eos> What?<eos> It's just... Why wouldn't he have told Vivian?<eos> Because there was nothing to tell.<eos> Plus, he's not much of a talker... until he starts talk about Vivian, then he lights up.<eos> I'm telling you, April, this man loves his wife.<eos> Well, then don't worry, they'll get through it.<eos> And what if they don't?
[Click] _<eos> [Clicking]<eos> _<eos> What did his text say?<eos> "Patient emergency."<eos> Oh.<eos> [Inhales deeply] He died, didn't he?<eos> That old love of yours.<eos> Tom.<eos> Yes, he did.
How's it going?<eos> Hey, did you see the flowers in the kitchen?<eos> Blair got them for me.<eos> Mm. He's a good guy, don't you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can't not know.<eos> You either like someone or you don't.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh. Is there a reason?<eos> I just don't.
I am happy for you, Karen.<eos> Obviously, your news completely threw us.<eos> I know.<eos> It threw me, too.<eos> But it also... Brought up a lot of emotional stuff for me.<eos> The truth is, we did kind of try.<eos> A few years ago, I went off birth control, but then I got sick.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.<eos> But I'm not an idiot, Karen.<eos> I know there's none of me in there.<eos> I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
- But can you do me a favor?<eos> - Yes. Keep planning, but can you, uh... Can you just do it... do it from down here?<eos> Oh. - Just do that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I just got excited.<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Oh, God, I just... Oh, baby, I think after everything that's happened, I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah. You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
I couldn't even make it through the appetizers.<eos> What was wrong with this one?<eos> Well, you know, when you go on these things, usually you start off with a cute anecdote about yourself.<eos> I use the one about nursing a baby bird back to health.<eos> That was me!<eos> I did that! Well, I took it.<eos> It's a big hit, actually, should you want to start dating.<eos> Anyway, this guy's anecdote was about his fatty lipoma.<eos> - I don't know what that is.<eos> - Oh, I didn't either.
So what do you say?<eos> You ready to send your first Tweet?<eos> Yes, I am, Mike.<eos> And you're sure you want to make it that profane?<eos> Abso-fucking-lutely.<eos> Bring the cursor up to the blue button and three, two, one, click it.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Did you get it?<eos> !<eos> Yeah! The whole world did.
What's wrong with meat and potatoes?<eos> One doesn't need to pour fancy things in the food!<eos> This must be the first time you've had to wait for me.<eos> - Hey!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - It scratched Prince.<eos> Throw another stone and I'll sew a doormat with your mop!<eos> It's a chihuahua.<eos> And the cat surely has both rabies and the plague.<eos> Clearly you do, too.
This is after she wasted the guy, man, because the blood,<eos> -it just riled her up, man. -Stop. I believe you.<eos> -I believe you, okay?<eos> -She's out of her mind, sick.<eos> -Look at this.<eos> -Mike, okay?<eos> But she likes you.<eos> And she trusts you and right now, you got her in heat.<eos> Mike, my job is to get that woman to trust me.<eos> Which she only half does.
- Don't talk that way!<eos> - I'll talk as I like.<eos> - No, don't talk to me that way!<eos> Calm down please, gentlemen!<eos> Whatever your implication is, Mr Lunes, this better stop right now.<eos> Especially as the police have arrested two men.<eos> They were present, their testimonies could clear you.<eos> Clear him?<eos> Did you know this, Mr Moreau?<eos> No, I didn't.
I hope and pray it is you.<eos> Verrocchio...<eos> Clarice I will see you hang for their murders.<eos> Your mentor was a necessary sacrifice.<eos> But I did not kill Clarice.<eos> I adored her.<eos> She was carrying your child.<eos> I...<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - What if you did?
Hell, no.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Hey, Jordan.<eos> Call him.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> I thought that Kim said she found a home for him.<eos> - Hi, buddy. - Yeah, she did.<eos> With me.<eos> But Kim gets visitation rights.<eos> Of course she does.
O.R. standing by.<eos> We should be there in 20 minutes.<eos> Good. Let's get him out of here.<eos> Done.<eos> That's great.<eos> Carl, you did great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or...<eos> Yeah, we do.
I'm just...<eos> I'm competitive.<eos> Like, overly competitive.<eos> And I really wanna be chief resident in a couple years.<eos> Yeah, we both do.<eos> I-I don't want us to hate each other.<eos> Yeah, me, neither.<eos> We both went mean pretty quickly.<eos> We just have to find a way to stay friends during all of this, you know?<eos> Yeah, we do.
So if it was two guys, you must've seen 'em.<eos> Sergeant, what the hell's going on here? I know you're lying, Jessie.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> You're Wesenrein, you're involved, and you know Shaw.<eos> Bauerschwein!<eos> You make me sick.<eos> Oh, you're a Grimm again?<eos> I don't know what you are, but you know what's wrong.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Yeah?<eos> Are you going to the wedding?<eos> I'm not sure that's such a good idea.<eos> Dad, do you hate Mom?<eos> - Of course not, Clio.<eos> - Colette says you hate her.<eos> I love your mother.<eos> Does she love you?<eos> Yeah, I think, you know, in a way, yeah.<eos> Sure, yeah, she does.
I told you, I barely know her.<eos> I think you like her.<eos> Dad, who are you texting?<eos> - No one.<eos> - Is it Kat?<eos> No, it's not Kat.<eos> Hmm.<eos> This is a really nice office.<eos> Yeah, I thought you would like it.<eos> I do.
How do you know?<eos> I don't, but it just helps sometimes to say that.<eos> I think I miss you.<eos> Oh, Charlie.<eos> Do you ever think about me?<eos> All the time.<eos> Dad?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Who wants ice cream?<eos> I do.
You think they throw us a parade when they take back our badges?<eos> They don't.<eos> The Rack uses us up and then they toss us aside when they're done with us.<eos> The only reason our beloved "brotherhood" is interested in my ancient ass at all, is because my name's on a warrant.<eos> 'Cause of this...<eos> I'm not working the warrant, Joe.<eos> You can leave.<eos> I just need this.<eos> Well, now, that's gonna be a problem.<eos> - Because so do I.
I tell you.<eos> T... Textile factory.<eos> Guards.<eos> Five. Six-six.<eos> You play games?<eos> W-Why, why?<eos> I tell you.<eos> No!<eos> You got provisions ready to move?<eos> Yes, we do, sir.
Let's get you back up to your room before the Med Bot does her rounds.<eos> - Those headaches again?<eos> We'll run some scans in the morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, Dave... Dave...<eos> Can you take me back to my room?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> So, does Molly want a bedtime story?<eos> - Yes, I do. - Mm.
We don't tie people up and hold them captive against their will.<eos> Who have you all become?<eos> What do we do?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Where's Bonnie?<eos> Still trying to get ahold of her.<eos> Find her.<eos> Was that Frank again?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it kind of does.
I love me.<eos> So I'm done.<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
But nowhere in this confession tape do the detectives say Lila was strangled.<eos> Because Lila still had her phone, which means Rebecca was lying during her psych eval.<eos> When she found out that Lila was "breaking up with her," - Rebecca snapped.<eos> - Thus explaining...<eos> - She took Lila's phone...<eos> - Teen offenders with multiple arrests...<eos> - Why Rebecca's DNA... - The photos of Sam to pin the murder...<eos> Wes...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> Michaela: Of course you do.
So I'm done.<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> I recognized you.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Mm. - Oh, babe.<eos> - What?<eos> Have you seen my Billy Ocean t-shirt?<eos> What? !<eos> Feel free to remarry, and find the kids a good dad.<eos> Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe.<eos> We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not.
You know, you right, Curtis.<eos> You're right.<eos> You know, I'm gonna leave it alone.<eos> I did not leave it alone.<eos> Hey, Lance.<eos> More scotch?<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - All right.<eos> I told you that Lance and I were engaged.<eos> Of course I did!
It ended with my boys trying to to Menendez me.<eos> Duct-taped me to the fridge and beat me with a bag of clementines - to get my bank codes. - Wow.<eos> We were taught to, uh, respect our parents. Right, Charlie?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Except Eustace kinda runs the show at my house.<eos> I lost the moral high ground once I bought a jet ski in his name<eos> - and ruined his credit.<eos> - You own a jet ski?<eos> Technically, he does.<eos> Or did.
- All right.<eos> - Let's see it. Right here. It's easy.<eos> This should be like nothing for you right now.<eos> - So how you doing?<eos> - You know. I'm happy to be blinking' and breathing'.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, but I'm serious.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I can't believe Bow told you.<eos> Ha. Of course she did.
- Ah! - Nobody goes to jail.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What about Carl? - What about Carl?<eos> Carl's got the keys to the mail plane.<eos> We cut Carl in.<eos> Carl comes, too.<eos> No women for Carl.<eos> No women for Carl.<eos> Where'd you find another bottle of Curaçao?<eos> I didn't.
I like your sweater.<eos> I find it oddly comforting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got some schmutz on the side of...<eos> This is so, so creepy.<eos> Listen, your mom was thinking maybe we could go to the dance together.<eos> - Oh, I don't know what...<eos> - So you already have a date?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, you do now.
Look at this man.<eos> He just explodes, Dan.<eos> He can get downcourt as quick as anyone that I've ever... What's up, boy?<eos> You good?<eos> You want some breakfast?<eos> No, I want that shit you've been holding for me.<eos> - Still got it after all these years? - I just might.<eos> Let me go see.<eos> Your mama got the best ass in New York City.<eos> Always did.
I didn't touch your girl!<eos> She ain't even my type!<eos> - What the fuck does that mean?<eos> - Tommy!<eos> I don't fucking need you alienating our right fucking hand over some bitch.<eos> Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust.<eos> - I trust her! - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
Ancient catacombs that the Jews use as secret synagogues.<eos> - She can take us right to the entrance.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> It's not far.<eos> It's in the underbelly of that building.<eos> And between us and that building are a hundred Turks intent on separating us from our limbs.<eos> That is assuming those vile killing machines don't shred us before then.<eos> Just so you know... Bad news was all you.<eos> How do we get past those soldiers?<eos> [DA VINCI) We don't.
Whatever you do reflects off me.<eos> What the hell is you doing?<eos> Don't yell at me. What you mean, don't yell at you?<eos> Somebody at India's job was taping us.<eos> India?<eos> You my girl. You ain't supposed to be kissing no damn India chick, and you know that.<eos> So, if it was a dude, it would've been all right?<eos> I'm not saying that. You got a sidepiece too.<eos> - Hakeem got a sidepiece?<eos> - Yes, he does.
Start recording for Empire on this phone.<eos> Hakeem.<eos> Look, you were right about the song, okay?<eos> I said it so you won't have to.<eos> Now, could I go take a leak?<eos> Hey.<eos> I gave you that advice because I care.<eos> Look, I can't force a relationship between us, but... I think you do know I love you, don't you?<eos> Let me think.<eos> I don't.
The world that's coming, this machine world with machine men.<eos> So you do want this to end?<eos> Everything ends.<eos> No.<eos> You've just given up!<eos> Wait!<eos> Connie, wait!<eos> Why?<eos> Why don't you believe in us?<eos> I do.
Where did I go wrong?<eos> First you stole her phone, and then...<eos> Yes, I know that.<eos> I'm talking about in general.<eos> How did it all come to this?<eos> I think he is right.<eos> You should call the police.<eos> Hey...<eos> I saw it on television.<eos> Everybody did.
He's broken up bad still.<eos> He will heal.<eos> Robin said the angel of death was down there with him, hovering for his take.<eos> I did not.<eos> Shush you both.<eos> Go to Rebecca's.<eos> See if you can be of use.<eos> Thought I'd have seen you a couple of days ago.<eos> Word of the mine must not have got to you.<eos> It did.
Because witness to the end of this place. It's too large a grieving.<eos> I am sorry...<eos> For what he did to you.<eos> They know.<eos> All of them.<eos> Fiona will have told them.<eos> They're as disgusted by me as you.<eos> Not me.<eos> I have not the sex that pleases you.<eos> You do.
But I need to see her first.<eos> Before I sign anything,<eos> I need to know she's all right.<eos> She's fine.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> Or no deal.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How long have you known Fish Mooney?<eos> I don't.
I'm the butler.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> - I made it.<eos> - You made it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So what is it?<eos> Well, it's a hood.<eos> Thought it would, uh, you know, spice things up.<eos> When did we start wearing hoods?<eos> - We didn't.
- That's not funny.<eos> - But then...<eos> I saw something in you,<eos> Barbara, I saw... the real you.<eos> You are the woman that I have been searching for.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I'm gonna let you go now, and you're going to sit down and have breakfast with me.<eos> Come on.<eos> No!<eos> So I do it the hard way.
I need to know where the Foxglove is.<eos> And I need an invitation.<eos> Well, someone's in a mood.<eos> Can you help me out?<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Jim, I do so love our give-and-take relationship.<eos> But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll owe you a favor.<eos> You already do.
He was sweet.<eos> As soon as I got into his car, he pulled a hood over my head and tied my wrists.<eos> He took me back to his apartment.<eos> That's where he did this.<eos> I don't know why he let me go.<eos> When was this?<eos> -Almost nine years ago.<eos> - About a year before the first murder... He was working his way up.<eos> Why didn't you go to the police?<eos> I did.
Ventilation system's all good.<eos> And, sir, I wanna apologize for my outburst in there. It was uncalled for.<eos> I have a little trouble dealing with my anger sometimes.<eos> Join the club.<eos> Yeah, something I'm working on, but this alien stuff messed with my head. And losing Trip brought back a lot of hard memories.<eos> For all of us.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't blow my chance to work on Lola one day.<eos> After that little RC version you built for me, I'm genuinely considering it.<eos> Although, I couldn't figure out how to make it fly.<eos> It doesn't.
Why did you come here?<eos> These transformed beings are... abominations.<eos> I knew that I had to find the remainder of the Diviners before another monstrosity occurred, and erase any knowledge of it.<eos> How many Diviners are supposed to be in that crate?<eos> Enough to create an army.<eos> Sir, the crate is empty.<eos> My worst fear has come true.<eos> We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the '40s.<eos> Does that mean Hydra has them?<eos> And if Hydra doesn't, who does?
Ethan Johnston, 26, potential enhanced.<eos> Died of cardiogenic shock in the 37th hour of experimentation.<eos> - Still no quantum signature?<eos> - No, Dr. List.<eos> That's a waste.<eos> Take the cadaver to the lab.<eos> Compare him to the other samples.<eos> Hail HYDRA.<eos> I told you I'd put our family back together.<eos> Yes, you did.
I mean, you spent three days in a coma after a lucky horseshoe fell and hit you on the head.<eos> I almost choked to death on a rabbit's foot. There's no way we're gonna...<eos> - Red wins.<eos> - We won?<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe it.<eos> Debbie, no, this is terrible. Now we're actually taking money away from them. Let me just...<eos> No, wait, wait, wait. Maybe our luck has finally changed.<eos> W-What are you doing?<eos> The double streets along with a quad bet and one straight up on 17. What?<eos> My sorority did a lot of casino nights.
She is a SHIELD agent.<eos> - Is that still true?<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Now's a good time to find out where Skye really stands.<eos> - So they do have it.<eos> - Deep in their ship, under lock and key.<eos> - For now.<eos> - Sounds like somebody knows something we don't.<eos> - Jiaying, this doesn't concern him.<eos> - Yes. Yes, it does.
Come on.<eos> I need to know what happened five years ago.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.<eos> Theo was having an affair with Patty.<eos> I told Stetson so that he would get her to break it off with Theo, and instead, he killed them both.<eos> His own wife, my husband.<eos> He destroyed my family.<eos> Why didn't you tell the detectives five years ago?<eos> Do they know what we're talking about?<eos> We do.
Not like this.<eos> What kind of Wesen are we dealing with?<eos> A Matanga Zumbido.<eos> I told you.<eos> It was a Mata-something.<eos> I was close.<eos> If I had known what he was before I told him about Theo and Patty, I never would have told him.<eos> I'm not going back in that house.<eos> Something killed Raymond. Yeah.<eos> Something did.
I'm not going back in that house.<eos> Something killed Raymond. Yeah.<eos> Something did.<eos> That's why we're not going back in that house.<eos> I'm not leaving Portland until I find out what did this.<eos> We're Ghost Seekers. It's what we're supposed to do!<eos> I never thought any of this was really real.<eos> Well, now we have proof that it is, and you want to run away.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Here.<eos> Is this all of it?<eos> Yep.<eos> Let me know when you move Antoine.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, by the way, there's a patient asking for you, bed seven.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't know if you remember me.<eos> No, of course I do.
Mom, are you okay?<eos> I talked to him.<eos> Ted.<eos> I stopped by the church after the blood drive.<eos> He deserved an answer.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said yes.<eos> I said I wanted to marry him.<eos> And then I told him about what happened when he was away.<eos> You did?
Can you imagine this?<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You have no idea how sorry I am.<eos> Since that day, I have thought of you often.<eos> In fact, you have been my singular focus.<eos> Look, if you're gonna kill me... Go ahead.<eos> I probably deserve it, but... Leave innocent people out of it.<eos> I have no intention of killing you, Mr. Stark.<eos> I am going to make you suffer.<eos> Please don't do this.
Just like you laying there.<eos> I thought Murdocks never quit.<eos> It's my fault!<eos> It's my fault!<eos> I did it, I killed him!<eos> Killed who?<eos> My dad.<eos> They paid him to lose against Creel. But...<eos> But I wanted him to win.<eos> So he did because of me.
My boy said you had plenty to say to him.<eos> I put myself out there.<eos> You think it's my fault they don't see it, what I could bring?<eos> You wanna call me a loser to my face, you little shit?<eos> I didn't call you a loser, man.<eos> Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.

I believe he walks among us... taking many forms.<eos> What if you could have stopped him... from ever hurting anyone again?<eos> Stopped him how?<eos> This doesn't change anything, Ben.<eos> Except now we know who your king of diamonds is.<eos> You see the news?<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> Fisk has gotten out in front of being dragged into the spotlight.<eos> My editor thinks he's the Second Coming.<eos> Hell, the whole city does.
Baby?<eos> Hello, gorgeous.<eos> Hello, handsome.<eos> Ben?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Is this about the extension?<eos> Let's speak outside, yeah?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - How do you know you did everything?<eos> I did everything.
Are you trying to tell me that you didn't take Spanish - to snuggle up to what's-her-name...<eos> - What?<eos> The Greek girl?<eos> Well, I... surely I would take Greek?<eos> No, because she was taking Spanish.<eos> She already spoke Greek.<eos> Whatever happened to her?<eos> She was smokin'.<eos> Man, it didn't work out.<eos> When does it ever with you, buddy?
A very rough patch.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Yeah... but I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> It's...<eos> If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.
- You sure? I just...<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> - I think you should just relax.<eos> - I've got good momentum.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> - Oh, my--oh, God!<eos> - Oh, is it--is it bad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you never had the VIP tickets, huh?<eos> No, bud, I didn't.
No!<eos> You mustn't speak!<eos> I thought I had made that clear.<eos> If you speak,<eos> I will have to cut out your brother's throat.<eos> Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
There were so many photos.<eos> I don't...<eos> I wasn't even there.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - And nobody stopped it.<eos> Nobody cared, and we were children.<eos> Come here, babe.<eos> Shh. It's okay, Phoebe.<eos> You know, Will seems like a solid, very young guy.<eos> - He is.<eos> - He does.
George, I don't think it's so much what Underwood did, but what he didn't do.<eos> He remained presidential.<eos> And when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.<eos> Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out swinging, and I think it hurt them both.<eos> Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.<eos> She's 20 points behind the other two.<eos> But the sexism thing?<eos> And going after Dunbar's kids?<eos> - It seemed quite desperate.<eos> - She did do some damage to Dunbar.
Oh, that is funny.<eos> No problem.<eos> Uh... back to ones.<eos> And when you're ready... Action!<eos> Hello, I'm moina rose, and if you Li-<eos> Okay, back to ones. Still rolling.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why?<eos> - You said "moina."<eos> - You sure did.
_<eos> Note that Jane had hurried to the stage so she could watch them film the scene idea she had come up with.<eos> Santos disguised as a beggar.<eos> A pirate beggar?<eos> That's weird.<eos> _<eos> And Jane realized exactly what had happened.<eos> Did you tell the writers to act like they liked my idea?<eos> Uh... are you enjoying your new job?<eos> Rogelio, did you?

- Diablo!<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey, boy! Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> What? Oh... oh, no! Wait, Diablo!<eos> _<eos> I'm just saying... our first case together.<eos> And the last.<eos> And we caught the bad guy!<eos> We definitely did.
I mean, for me, growing up without a dad,<eos> I never stopped wondering who he was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I heard your voice in my head saying that when I was trying to decide what to do.<eos> So I e-mailed her.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No response yet but...<eos> I think it's good.<eos> I really do.
You moved in together.<eos> What was the long-term plan?<eos> Did you talk about it?<eos> Well, not specifically.<eos> Xiomara, you had a little girl.<eos> You got to raise her.<eos> Don't you want that for Rogelio?<eos> I mean, if he wants it...<eos> - More children?<eos> Of course I do.
Yes, you are right!<eos> I don't know how I missed it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are a true friend.<eos> So, can I ask you a question?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you think they'll last?<eos> Jane and Rafael?<eos> 'Cause I don't think they will.<eos> Deep down, I-I don't.
_<eos> I'm still graduating.<eos> It's just a ceremony.<eos> You can't do it after?<eos> Just take a couple of deep breaths and relax, okay?<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
So you two are gonna tell each other how you feel honestly right now.<eos> Go.<eos> Okay, mom, you go first.<eos> Rogelio is...<eos> Dad?<eos> Right.<eos> Dad is considering going to Mexico.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> You know.<eos> No, we don't.
I want to apologize to you.<eos> We never got along. And that's my fault.<eos> But a day like today...<eos> It makes you reflect.<eos> That's what my shaman says, anyway.<eos> You have a shaman?<eos> Yes. Uh...<eos> I went to an ashram a few weeks ago.<eos> I know, I know, I know it sounds silly.<eos> No. It doesn't.
Uh-oh. I think I know what's going on here.<eos> When we talked about moving in?<eos> You were hinting about getting engaged?<eos> See, I recently watched a few episodes of a premium cable drama that touches on subjectivity.<eos> _<eos> I just have this order, you know?<eos> Date, engaged...<eos> Get married, then have a baby.<eos> And just because this baby thing happened first, I don't want to throw out the whole order.<eos> Or rather, I do.
And now it's - almost done.<eos> - No.<eos> No, it is not done.<eos> - But it's changing.<eos> - It's changing, definitely.<eos> And maybe for the better.<eos> Maybe it's time your life changes, too.<eos> I mean, you don't want to live here forever, right?<eos> In grandma's house?<eos> - No, I don't.
These with the black blazer?<eos> I guess.<eos> It's a little Amanda Woodward.<eos> I love her.<eos> I know. Me too.<eos> Seems pretty conservative, though.<eos> Okay, consider my source.<eos> I'm getting fashion advice from Mrs. Purple Doc Martens.<eos> I don't have Purple Doc Martens.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't know.<eos> But I can't stop wondering if maybe this is why I came back, like to be with this version of Andy Kelly.<eos> Well, too bad he's with Melanie.<eos> Yeah, but that doesn't matter.<eos> I mean, we both know they don't end up together.<eos> Becca, look. You called off your wedding to Sean, not to mention a week in Aruba, and that's fine, 'cause it's your life.<eos> But do you really have the right to change the course of other people's lives?<eos> Lolly, I am not planning on ruining anyone's life here.<eos> I'm just... I just need to know if he felt the same...<eos> That thing that I did.
I believe true love-making must include a third participant.<eos> I would be honored if you'd join us.<eos> Us?<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> This is my first time.<eos> Okay.<eos> For most people, it's all about sex, but not me.<eos> I prefer to spoon. For hours.<eos> Do you like to spoon?<eos> I do not.
I'm not getting her involved in this.<eos> Allen, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.<eos> I need to be out there.<eos> Joe, you're always the first one to tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.<eos> I took down Clyde.<eos> I can take down his dirt bag brother too.<eos> You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know. They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
You were right.<eos> This is all my fault. How is this your fault?<eos> Brave heart, Barry.<eos> We'll get Cisco back.<eos> I'm back. Oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> We were so worried.<eos> What happened?<eos> How did you escape?<eos> I didn't.
Whoever this Trickster is, he's certainly not shy.<eos> Well, not every criminal likes to hide in the dark.<eos> Cisco, can you trace where the video was posted from?<eos> I tried, but this guy is using some crazy Felicity-Caliber scrambler like I've never seen.<eos> The origin of the upload's coming from hundreds Of different locations.<eos> Until he uploads another video, it's gonna be tough.<eos> This psychopath has the capability to destroy the city.<eos> Hey, I said tough, not impossible.<eos> Barry, we'll catch him.<eos> We always do.
Iris, we're gonna find Eddie.<eos> How?<eos> You've searched everywhere.<eos> More than once.<eos> And you haven't found anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not mad at you.<eos> It's just...<eos> You miss him, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- If I had my powers right now I would gas you all out of existence.<eos> And then you'd be standing in a container with four corpses.<eos> What would that get you?<eos> Peace and quiet.<eos> I don't know about you guys, but I don't need my powers to fill this rig full of bodies.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Wherever they're taking us we're here.<eos> Ferris Air?<eos> I thought this place got shut down.<eos> It did.
~ I didn't give my name. ~ Yeah, well, I get why.<eos> I recognised you.<eos> I know a bit about your case.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.<eos> ~ Why did you come down here?<eos> ~ I don't want to talk to you.<eos> ~ Cos DI Hardy's here?<eos> ~ Was I not clear?<eos> ~ Don't you want to put your side of the story?<eos> ~ No, I don't.
You ain't all that.<eos> I wouldn't have gone anywhere near her if I'd seen that!<eos> I know. I'm sorry!<eos> Do you know what, maybe if you spent a little less time trying to tell me how to do my job and a bit more time on your own work we'd stand a chance of getting him off.<eos> Chin up.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself, lying in there?<eos> It's not my husband in the dock.<eos> ~ I suppose you knew all along.<eos> ~ No!<eos> Of course you did.
Hope you're right about that.<eos> ~ I wasn't sure you'd come.<eos> ~ I can't believe you asked.<eos> Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.<eos> ~ I want to work with you.<eos> ~ You wanna what?<eos> I'm not ready to stop.<eos> In fact I'm just getting going again.<eos> ~ You don't want to end on a loss.<eos> ~ No, I bloody don't,
Did, uh, Eddie turn up?<eos> No. That's, uh, actually why I'm here.<eos> Eddie never came home.<eos> And now Jerome's missing.<eos> He hasn't been by Helton Shelter in more than week.<eos> And I haven't heard from him in a few days.<eos> I tried calling his phone this morning, but the number's been disconnected.<eos> Have you called the hospitals?<eos> Checked with friends, relatives?<eos> I... I did all of that.
Who did the map?<eos> The patient.<eos> It's a long story, please, just go.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know. He's scared, you know, but he's got a fighting chance, but it's a pretty risky operation.<eos> But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
You can't, can't save everyone.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I think I know how to do this.<eos> Guys?<eos> We're trying to save a life.<eos> And help the deaf, so it's a two-fer.<eos> I'm not home. AJ:<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We need a third.<eos> Of course you do.
We need to talk.<eos> O-okay, I'll come down.<eos> No, wait.<eos> I-I'll come up.<eos> ♪ Juliet says, "hey, it's Romeo" ♪ That night, I was determined to climb my way into manhood.<eos> Or at least make it to Dana's window without having to be rescued by firemen.<eos> You know, you really need to stop climbing things.<eos> Look, all I wanted was to be seen as your boyfriend, not some little kid.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Of course they do.
I'm sorry. I thought I could, but I can't.<eos> Damn it!<eos> How else are we supposed to convince Dad that music is our thing?<eos> Can't be done.<eos> You're dealing with a man who has no interest in music whatsoever.<eos> Everyone likes music.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I think Pops is right.<eos> How can he actually not like music?<eos> Some dads just don't.
The good news is, you had no problem coming up with the funny.<eos> Now all you got to do is find the right audience.<eos> Really?<eos> You think if I come up with something big,<eos> I still have a shot at class clown?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Now, don't misinterpret my advice again.<eos> Don't be hurtful. Just be funny.<eos> I 100% got it.<eos> But I didn't.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> Why not?<eos> Since when is being nice a bad thing?<eos> Since we're in middle school.<eos> It's basically the worst thing you can say about a dude.<eos> Not to me. Everyone is always trying to be funny or cool or someone they're not.<eos> The last thing I want is to be with some clown.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Or at least, I did.
Barry's ditching school.<eos> Wow.<eos> Thank you for telling me nothing of note.<eos> Did you even hear what I said? Yes, narc.<eos> I'm also ditching work.<eos> Are you gonna tattle on me, too?<eos> But I... get back to class, or you're grounded.<eos> What do you mean, the car's already been reported stolen?<eos> The question is, how did you know it was stolen?<eos> I didn't.
Was just thinking that, um, you know, you're going away for the summer and all, and...<eos> You know, I don't really say it much.<eos> I, um... What's happening?<eos> You know, I just wanted to say... - I love you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I luh you.<eos> What?<eos> I luh you.<eos> - What? - You heard me.<eos> I really didn't.
- Yes! We don't do that, Dre!<eos> We are compassionate liberals who believe in tolerance, acceptance, open...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.<eos> But we're black, all right?<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> We're black.<eos> When did he start believing that immigrants should go back across the border, that evolution doesn't exist?<eos> ! - They should.<eos> - What?<eos> And it doesn't.
- No, it wasn't.<eos> She told me about your dad.<eos> - What'd she tell you?<eos> - That he took off when you were a kid.<eos> That's how my mother tells it.<eos> That he's probably in Jamaica surrounded by a brood of bastard kids.<eos> And you don't believe her?<eos> Your dad's gone, he's gone.<eos> It doesn't matter why.<eos> Sure it does.
Can we just back up for one second to the Marshal taking your car? Mmm.<eos> I should have choked his cowboy ass out, left him for dead on the side of the road, but, uh, I figured someone drives by and sees, I'd have to kill them.<eos> You know, and somebody else drives by and sees, and I'd have to kill... them.<eos> You know, and another car drives by and sees and I have to kill them.<eos> - You know, and... - I mean, 'cause ...<eos> He's cool.<eos> I already told him all this shit anyway.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great talk on the drive over.<eos> He says you guys are with Tigerhawk Security?<eos> He did, huh?
So I drove her home.<eos> When we got there, she wanted me to come in.<eos> I... I didn't.<eos> And then she was murdered.<eos> I... I am sorry. I just don't understand why you didn't tell me or anyone else.<eos> I should have.<eos> But I didn't have any information that would've helped.<eos> It was a no-win situation.<eos> I really wanna believe you.<eos> But you don't?
Of course.<eos> What else is there?<eos> Now, where is our chilly friend?<eos> Oh... he looks terrible.<eos> Well, I'll be goin' now.<eos> I'll need help getting him out.<eos> Getting him out?<eos> Miss Borden, I really must go.<eos> Listen, you have secrets.<eos> So do I.
Where's McLeod?<eos> ~ That's Aafrin's favourite, too. ~ Mmm.<eos> ~ More rice and he needs some curry. ~ Ma!<eos> You have to stop doing all that.<eos> It's up to you now to take good care of him.<eos> ~ Improve his time-keeping.<eos> ~ His bad breath in the mornings...<eos> Oh, please, Shamshad, I'm trying to eat.<eos> ~ Sita needs to know all about.<eos> ~ No, she does not.
We were joking!<eos> Mr Ian!<eos> I'm going to get you out of here!<eos> Thank you.<eos> All your favourite things.<eos> If you can't control yourself, please go indoors.<eos> Tuck in, love.<eos> Anyway, it's all booked.<eos> Did I tell you the Mclellands and the Rowses are travelling with us right up to Tilbury?<eos> Yes, you did.
Escaping from the compound... chai in the bazaar in those little clay cups they had.<eos> And then one day, our fathers took us each to one side and said, "No more."<eos> But we knew better than that, didn't we?<eos> Oh, yes, old friends.<eos> The most loyal fellow in the world.<eos> SPEAKS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE<eos> ~ You...?<eos> ~ No questions.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
Wyatt.<eos> - Yes, sir? This is, uh, hard for me to say, but there's no way around it.<eos> I love what you bring to Cattleman's Ranch.<eos> You're doing a great job.<eos> No notes. [Laughs]<eos> Thank you, sir. [Laughing] Okay.<eos> Wow, that means a lot.<eos> Thank you. All right, who wants to see the Texas skip?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah! I do!
Sufentanil.<eos> It knocks people out.<eos> This is what made you think that you killed Trish.<eos> You know, I've spent my whole life protecting people.<eos> You're still you.<eos> You just need time to...<eos> I did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but I have never wanted to kill an innocent woman.<eos> Do you want to kill her now?<eos> - No. God, no.<eos> - No, because you never did.
- More important than a paying customer?<eos> Life and death, actually.<eos> Figured you were blowing me off.<eos> I wouldn't just bail on you.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
Might as well stop that right now.<eos> It won't do him any good.<eos> - Stop what?<eos> - Guilt makes people do stupid shit.<eos> I'm not guilty.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> See, I hate that.<eos> I want everything to be my fault.<eos> Good or bad. Means I have some control.<eos> - You don't.
You help people.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> And you make the rest of us look like selfish pricks.<eos> Is that a compliment or...<eos> There are other nurses at the hospital who can help.<eos> There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
I appreciate the help.<eos> I'll leave it here.<eos> We gotta go. Meeting starts in 20.<eos> Doing battle with Odin seems like a more stimulating way to spend an hour to me.<eos> I'm not skipping a meeting.<eos> I don't think you should, either.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Been bailing on meetings and then when you do show, you never talk.<eos> Your enthusiasm for the program never waxes and wanes?<eos> Sure it does.
Marisol talks about you all the time.<eos> You've been together a while.<eos> Since freshman year.<eos> Kyle and I met in high school.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback. Ha!<eos> Ha ha! I used to get high behind metal shop every day, and Daisy honey trapped her teachers into giving her As.<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
I thought...you were dead.<eos> That's what they wanted you to believe.<eos> They need you to hate them to wage this war.<eos> You're not one of them?<eos> I was once.<eos> I'm sorry. This is all my fault.<eos> I thought I was protecting you.<eos> I wanted to believe him.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I still do.
This was his room.<eos> Oh, Vera, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's a model of the solar system.<eos> He got an A-plus.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why would they just leave like this?<eos> I don't know, Alan.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know what happened then, but I was panicked and scared, and when I suddenly came to, it seemed like I was being attacked by a stranger.<eos> Then I felt a power surge from my body.<eos> Sir, I need you to remain...<eos> They grounded the flight in Houston, then took me in for questioning.<eos> I couldn't explain anything, but they had no proof.<eos> My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
Daniel says that.<eos> "George ain't coming," just out of the blue.<eos> Now we all know where George was.<eos> Where was that?<eos> Carl... If you're trying to catch me on something, it ain't gonna happen.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together what occurred... What you saw, what you were thinking, that kind of thing.<eos> I understand. It just gets a little confusing sometimes.<eos> Of course.<eos> These things always do.
It wasn't mine?<eos> It wasn't yours.<eos> It's really happening.<eos> I'd say in weeks... Months maybe, but it's happening.<eos> I can go home?<eos> Yeah. You can go anywhere.<eos> You can go to Tulsa or New York or anywhere.<eos> What's in Tulsa?<eos> You told mother?<eos> Amantha did.
Daniel.<eos> You don't remember.<eos> He kept giving me pills.<eos> Trey said you were choking him.<eos> We will end it right here.<eos> - Do you see yourself as having a temper?<eos> Do you think you have trouble controlling your impulses?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Did you kill George Melton?<eos> I did not.
But it... it can't happen because I'm in a relationship.<eos> Andrew, just to be clear,<eos> I came here because I'm going through a tough time and wanted the unconditional support of a good friend.<eos> I'm sorry for thinking that was you.<eos> I totally hear what you're saying.<eos> Sometimes it's like you had something special with somebody, and it's... it's hard to make those feelings go away.<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> Hey, so she didn't want me back.<eos> At all.<eos> Oh, she... she didn't?
You won't find it so easy passing your bills through the House of Lords.<eos> Thomas More and the old aristocracy are for the Pope, and not afraid to say so.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Archbishop Warham, this, uh, prophetess you harbour in your diocese, Eliza Barton.<eos> How's she getting on?<eos> What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who was controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl, but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
I hear the Holy Maid, the Barton girl, has been to visit you.<eos> She has.<eos> But we wouldn't receive her.<eos> She's also been to visit the Lady Exeter at her invitation.<eos> Lady Exeter is a foolish and ambitious woman.<eos> Well, Barton told her she'd be Queen of England.<eos> I repeat my comment.<eos> You don't believe in her visions, then?<eos> I don't.<eos> She does it for attention.
Why are you doing it?<eos> Because... why am I a policeman, Rachel?<eos> ~ Can you win?<eos> ~ Probably not.<eos> Unless I can get Andrew Cullen to crack, they'll wipe the floor with me.<eos> I haven't got the proof I need.<eos> This, to my mind, is evidence of malpractice but it doesn't actually prove anything.<eos> Geoffrey Inler says he burned the proof seven years ago.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> No, I don't.
Are they really scabs? Sorry, you've brought us in here to discuss my union's rule book, have you?<eos> Do you hate scabs, Mr Woodruff?<eos> With every breath in me body.<eos> Did you hate Scott Parker, then?<eos> Ah, that's why I'm here.<eos> How did you find out about that?<eos> I'm a detective.<eos> Nah.<eos> Nothing could ever make me hate Scottie.<eos> Well, somebody did.
This is our Christmas.<eos> Now.<eos> This is what you wanted, isn't it? Just you and me.<eos> So, how was work?<eos> Ah, you know.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Walter never wants to talk about work.<eos> Well, we're just... We're fixing to do something tomorrow and I don't think it's a good idea, but the boss is one of these...<eos> Well, you trust him. You know that.<eos> I did.
Maybe they think you got potential.<eos> On the TV, they say that science is dying.<eos> I don't want it to die.<eos> So what are you gonna do about that?<eos> Well, I want to be the first person to visit their planet.<eos> Then that is what you'll do.<eos> Who knows why they chose 15 years, but things had got a whole lot better.<eos> I got a place at MIT, graduated, and got a job in astrophysics.<eos> Mom got clean and looked younger than ever before.<eos> In fact, everyone did.
In the raid that Gonzalez led, they didn't find anything.<eos> Why would Korbell order a hit after an unsuccessful raid?<eos> I mean, it just calls more attention to him. Exactly.<eos> The animal that escapes a snare doesn't necessarily go after the poacher.<eos> Okay, everyone, we can ask these questions in San Antonio.<eos> So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
Yeah. But i think we better watch our backs.<eos> You know what i'm saying?<eos> All right, bet.<eos> All right, i'll hit you up tomorrow.<eos> Later.<eos> Angela, i think we should prepare to go for an arrest warrant on egan.<eos> I want you to work with knox and swear out an affidavit with the judge.<eos> Saxe will go apeshit.<eos> Saxe will handle lobos if we get him.<eos> You do egan.
I recognized you.<eos> I knew you knew James.<eos> When I said it, I saw your face.<eos> You bought in.<eos> And then you wouldn't let it go, so I figured I could save Tommy and save myself.<eos> Turns out I could only save one of us.<eos> I pick me.<eos> So you're completely done with Tommy?<eos> You don't care what happens to him?<eos> No, I don't.
And soon I will have it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Withered by age and failure, yet your blind optimism carries you on.<eos> Don't tell me you still cling to your belief in the Supreme Being?<eos> - You should fear his wrath.<eos> - Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
I could use 10 more like you.<eos> But instead of having 10 more,<eos> I'm down one because your story's bullshit, isn't it, Brasher?<eos> - Have you ready our statement?<eos> - I don't have access to the file, sir.<eos> It wouldn't matter if Bosch had backed your story.<eos> You think the forensics came back in your favor?<eos> You think they found GSR on his hands?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> They didn't.
Yeah, it was really pretty there.<eos> Just please don't tell me if you made out with any cute English girls because I cannot compete with those accents. - I didn't.<eos> - Oh, this is really last-minute, but there's this fundraiser tonight.<eos> It's kind of in my uncle's honor, and it's black tie.<eos> Do you want to be my date?<eos> It's gonna be all fancy, and you love fundraisers.<eos> Um, I...<eos> What?<eos> Brenna, I know before I left, we were thinking my parents would forget about what happened and they wouldn't care if we saw each other.<eos> But they still do.
It's like she's her muse.<eos> Every good artist needs one.<eos> So, how was Juliet?<eos> She's a drama queen, but let's not talk about her.<eos> Tonight is about you and me.<eos> And again, I am sorry we couldn't go back to my place.<eos> My lazy landlord is finally fumigating.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I just hope that my mom doesn't come home.<eos> Or actually, maybe I kind of do.
'Cause Frankie and I, we've got some...<eos> Solid leads.<eos> - Babe. - Yeah.<eos> I just want music, so I can dance with you at our wedding.<eos> Who cares who books the band?<eos> All right, well, I'll go to the show tonight.<eos> It's our wedding. One of us should be there.<eos> And since you're at your bachelorette party, Frankie and I will go and make sure that the band is right for us.<eos> - Okay, if you really want to.<eos> - Of course we do!
- Everything cool?<eos> Yeah. Everything's fine.<eos> I'm just coordinating Mae's travel to Boston.<eos> Her conference in New York is going great.<eos> Are you guys sure it's okay if she stays here?<eos> It's my last night in town and I don't wanna find her...<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> Wow.<eos> Judging from all this food, looks like I better go put on some sweats.<eos> How you doing, kid?
You could have gotten more. I was very good tonight.<eos> We'll get more.<eos> She's coming back.<eos> Too bad you won't be here.<eos> Who are you? - Doesn't matter.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Pictures.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Henrietta, I need your help.<eos> You do.
Reconciliation.<eos> You did all this for me?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> We're in this together, aren't we?<eos> How do you mean that?<eos> Simmer down. I have my own bedroom.<eos> Well, this is all very beautiful, but when do we get serious?<eos> Don't make the mistake of thinking we're not.<eos> We did not come all this way again to go back empty-handed.<eos> No, we did not.
Kind of widening out.<eos> And what do you think about this whole government thing of, you know, listening in to people's private information?<eos> - I mean, that's crazy stuff.<eos> - Who knows?<eos> I mean, fuck them, you know?<eos> An eye for an eye, I say.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, this is a conversation for another time.<eos> But speaking of government, did you know that Simon was class president?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
Uh... around 200.<eos> 200, a-are you kidding me, man?<eos> You got to narrow it down.<eos> Hey, give me a break-- don't you think I'm trying?<eos> I don't have the processing capacity to do it here, and I can't very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, man. I'm just...<eos> I'm frustrated, and I'm hungry, and I'm cold. It's okay.<eos> I-I understand.<eos> Wait. Wait, doesn't the hospital have supercomputers?<eos> Yeah, they do.
Might explain why we keep getting away from him.<eos> Yeah, but why would whoever's behind this want us back alive?<eos> I don't know, but whatever the reason is,<eos> I think he knows it's a trap.<eos> Look, maybe we should just head back, right?<eos> He's still following us. We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Till death do us part.
Julianna was going to kill you, and there was nothing I could do but watch it happen.<eos> But it didn't happen.<eos> I just kept thinking about you dying-- us dying-- without ever getting a chance to get married.<eos> Well, it's a good thing we didn't elope, then, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.
Yeah, it is.<eos> My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.<eos> It wasn't until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that I realized that I might want one.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What are you doing here?<eos> This is your house?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why are you two here?<eos> We are here for a very legitimate, non-creepy reason that...<eos> Henry will now explain.<eos> We're working on the Aaron Brown murder.<eos> I believe he stopped here minutes before he was killed.<eos> Somebody did knock on my door that night, but why would Aaron want to come see me?<eos> He didn't.
- That's true, Marco.<eos> - Yeah, me too, pal. Me too.<eos> Marco, I think you should know Jason had intended to return Kevin Crachiolla's investment using his own money.<eos> Because you raised him right, Marco.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Over time, however, one learns that the choices of those we love are impossible to control.<eos> You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day? Come on, mom.<eos> [Chuckles, sniffles] I love you so much, Abraham.<eos> Henry: We both do.
They've just had a recent outbreak of dysentery.<eos> No, um, Isaac wants to take me on vacation.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, he doesn't waste any time, does he?<eos> Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.<eos> Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
Sheriff, the NYPD would be happy to help with this case.<eos> It's nice of you to offer, but without the proper paperwork, you know I can't really do that.<eos> Our O.C.M.E. has a state-of-the-art lab, which I'm guessing you don't have here.<eos> Plus, our presumed victim was a resident of New York City, so, technically, it is our case.<eos> You want a bunch of old bones?<eos> They're all yours.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Think I just found something.<eos> I think we're going to love it here, Abraham.<eos> I really do.
- That's not...<eos> - Sara, go home.<eos> No, no.<eos> He doesn't know what he's saying, no.<eos> I don't fucking want you!<eos> I already told you, you fucking priss.<eos> You're fucking nothing to me.<eos> I don't fucking want you.<eos> I don't want to come with you to fucking Bristol.<eos> I never did.
Years.<eos> After I lost my daddy, I...<eos> I had a hard time coping'.<eos> These made the pain disappear.<eos> If they could only make my family disappear...<eos> Must be intimidating, having a brother in the political spotlight.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He, uh, inherited my father's Southern charm, so everybody loves Lyman.<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, of course I do.
_<eos> What is this?<eos> I'm so sorry. After everything you've done for me...<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Victoria asked me to find it for her. And in the state I was in, I just wasn't thinkin' clearly.<eos> Yeah, but... But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
The girls begged.<eos> You guys never got the Christmas you wanted.<eos> I hope New Year's is okay.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all for coming in.<eos> This should only take a minute.<eos> Have any of you seen her?<eos> I did.
'Cause your dad was a good man.<eos> You hold on to that.<eos> Jose, your mother wants you to come back to the apartment.<eos> Carlos, may I speak with you?<eos> - Yeah, I should really just--<eos> - It'll only take a moment.<eos> Oscar told me about the rift between you two.<eos> I hope you had a chance to reconcile.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe we did.

Caryn, do you mind if I read this later so that I can really... not read it right now?<eos> Oh, yeah, totally, absolutely.<eos> Great.<eos> So can I just tell you what it says?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay. Here's the thing...<eos> I have always had terrible luck with friendships.<eos> A lot of my female friends have either gotten married or hated me.<eos> Terrible luck. And last night, when we were on the stairs,<eos> I just felt like we had a real connection.<eos> - We did, right?
The blueprints show only one other way down, into the Mayor's wing.<eos> There's a police post at both ends.<eos> If they went out that way, they were forced to.<eos> It certainly doesn't make sense for them to come in that way.<eos> If I were them, I would've come in the same way we did.<eos> Let's say you're right, that the Russians did come in this way.<eos> How did they get in the basement?<eos> Security's posted at the service entrance.<eos> They must've found another way in.<eos> How you doing?
I hope you both got the exact same unlikely but stirring...<eos> Commissioner.<eos> Sir.<eos> - [Hodiak] Turns out there were two.<eos> - [Shafe] Brothers.<eos> But only one was involved in the slaying of the judge's wife.<eos> We think both were guilty for Novo, though.<eos> Which would more easily explain the crucifixion.<eos> Both suspects have to die?<eos> [Shafe] They did.
Let us never speak of him again.<eos> Well, that is fine by me, and I'm so glad you got him away from Pied Piper.<eos> I mean, now that their suit has been resolved, I think that they're about to become something really special.<eos> Their core technology, it's visionary.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right.<eos> Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
No security.<eos> The only thing I could find was sewage pipes.<eos> Attack them from underneath.<eos> Yeah, it could work.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place.<eos> Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan.<eos> I do.

We must strike pre-emptively!<eos> A surprise attack could be the opportunity we need to weaken their numbers.<eos> If we use our combined fleet...<eos> And send in our ground troops to flank them... ..and bypass the Apulia coast and attack from the south.<eos> Where we bombard them from all sides.<eos> And put an end to this scourge once and for all.<eos> They'll never see it coming.<eos> In Otranto, the Turks anticipated our every move.<eos> How do we know this time will be different?<eos> We don't.
Well, that's good.<eos> Thanks for telling me that. - That's good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> - It was never gonna work out.<eos> Well, then what are you saying?<eos> She could always do worse.<eos> Alright.<eos> Yeah, what's up?<eos> - We need to talk about Mom.<eos> - Do we? Yeah.
- But I've never seen it in the flesh.<eos> - Is that a hint,<eos> More of a proposition.<eos> Oh, shit, shit, shit!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Come in.<eos> Close the door.<eos> We have a formal complaint from Tactical alleging that we have a leak.<eos> Maybe we do.

Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> John?<eos> Oh, you know what it probably is?<eos> Our alarm system is hooked up to the police station, and they probably just figured, you know, we're... we're...<eos> We're covered now.<eos> Listen, I... I should go.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> - I'll talk to you later.<eos> Hey, buddy, how you doing?
I was helping them.<eos> They can help themselves.<eos> We're not their dancing witch-monkeys.<eos> You want to bring these books back?<eos> Take the books.<eos> Leave the books.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Did you tell dad I was helping Jo get stronger?<eos> Is that why he's pissed?<eos> Of course you did.
It is the cornerstone of My Kingdom.<eos> Wars have been waged over it.<eos> So I'll put it in the same ballpark as the rooster, then?<eos> - Yeah. I think that sounds... yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Sir Galavant will fight the first match.<eos> I can tell you want to bail.<eos> I'll give you five seconds to bail.<eos> I don't want to bail. - I do.<eos> - You do?
I know you betrayed us.<eos> Me?<eos> Before you've paid me?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Maybe you'll get paid twice.<eos> Does the name Willem Sassen mean anything to you?<eos> He's Dutch and was an SS war correspondent.<eos> After the war, he was Peron's press agent.<eos> But now the political situation in Argentina isn't so rosy, he's got money troubles.<eos> Who doesn't?
Do you feel weird Kissing someone when you have a boyfriend?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -But...<eos> You are allowed. He wants you to.<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> -Are you worried that the stranger will be ugly And/or a creep and/or a catfish?<eos> The stranger will think that you are ugly and/or a creep?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Are you nervous about having bad breath?<eos> -Well, you don't.
Do you know the hour?<eos> What in God's name...?<eos> - Dr. Charles Hallum?<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but you have something I need.<eos> What is this about?<eos> A shipment.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London.<eos> But I don't have it.<eos> I...<eos> I never did.
Okay, step back. I got him.<eos> I got him.<eos> Oh, my god, is he having a heart attack? Okay.<eos> - Mike, what is...<eos> - Jackson, let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Hey, Travis.<eos> How you doing?
.<eos> They found me in an alley, in a suitcase?<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> So, Madison, what's the last thing that you do remember?<eos> Coming to the city to see Wicked.<eos> I live in Ronkonkoma.<eos> And you came by yourself?<eos> I was supposed to meet a girlfriend.<eos> (Benson) Supposed to?<eos> So you didn't?
Or you give us that missing footage.<eos> Lenny dropped my name?<eos> That little bitch.<eos> Let him give you the missing footage if he knows so much.<eos> Didn't you hear the news?<eos> Lenny Simmons is a free press crusader.<eos> (Amaro) You, on the other hand, are just Scott Russo's cleaning lady.<eos> He's really worth 20 years in jail?<eos> I swear I don't have the footage.<eos> LMZ does.
He's mom's friend.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Can you talk to mom so we can all come home?<eos> Your mother and I can't live together anymore.<eos> Well... Can you ask her if I can come live with you?<eos> I'll help take care of you, dad.<eos> I can do stuff around the house.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> Of course I do.
Hey, I got you a present.<eos> I put a little thought into it, but I'll be cool if you don't want to keep it.<eos> What could it be?<eos> Something special.<eos> It was you?<eos> - Merry Christmas, brother. - Dude!<eos> You saved me, man!<eos> You saved me!<eos> Well, I wouldn't go that far.<eos> No, all right, I totally did.
You're making me crazy.<eos> I can't run.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Kids, you're gonna give me a heart attack.<eos> Mommy, where's Daddy?<eos> He's, um... He's... He's not coming.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Why isn't he coming?<eos> Daddy's not coming, Daddy's not coming.<eos> I didn't, um...
- are made at this age. - Are you kidding me?<eos> I think you're overreacting, Terrence.<eos> Am I?<eos> Look at your brothers.<eos> Leave them out of this.<eos> You can't compare it.<eos> Well, weren't they about his age when they started running numbers for Mr. Dolan?<eos> That was different.<eos> We didn't have a father around.<eos> Yeah, but James does.
So until we dig a little deeper on him, don't take him anywhere we can be embarrassed.<eos> My suggestion is this, Cap... we give it seven days to see if the kid is worth keeping, if that works for you and the Boss.<eos> We don't need this smartass causing us any headaches.<eos> Muldoon, why don't you have a little talk with him?<eos> Get a feel for this college prick.<eos> See if he has any clue what this job's about.<eos> I'll leave it to you three to make the call.<eos> And don't worry about my contract with the old man.<eos> We gave him a shot, if it doesn't work out, then as my dear, old grandmother Octavia used to say,<eos> How you doing, kid?
Charles.<eos> Charles P. Thompson.<eos> Was there someone put you up to this, eh?<eos> No, no, that's my name.<eos> I'm... I'm named after Charlie... the other Charlie.<eos> What Charles P. Thompson?<eos> The Anzac legend?<eos> My very own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, he never had any kids.<eos> No, but his sister, Dorothy, she did.
I promised Kirstie.<eos> - OK, then. - And then I...<eos> I will talk to Sarah.<eos> You can't avoid this forever.<eos> I said I'd deal with it and I will.<eos> You can stop here.<eos> Why here?<eos> This is where she died.<eos> My beautiful little girl.<eos> We both did.
- Where's the baby?<eos> - Not here yet.<eos> - Coming.<eos> - Right?<eos> Out of the way. Yeah, that text was confusing.<eos> So you just got there?<eos> Okay, she just got there.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, how many centimeters is she?<eos> You don't... okay, good.
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't have a replacement for this school and this school means so much to me.<eos> I didn't want to just... so you're offering me your job?<eos> You've supported us for so long, honey.<eos> And I want to see you doing something that you truly enjoy and that you're happy doing.<eos> And I see it. I see it here.<eos> You love working here.<eos> I can make money.<eos> It's just for a little while. And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?
How's it going, fellas? - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Now, I think that you're destined to be prison scum.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> You believe in God?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Well, because that's just what I was taught, and...<eos> You were also taught that assault is against the law.<eos> Or do you think it's legitimate to go around hurting people?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I do not.
Where did you get this?<eos> The sorcerer's mansion.<eos> Henry found dozens of these blank books there.<eos> The sorcerer is here?<eos> Well, his house is, but we haven't found him yet.<eos> You're looking for him?<eos> Well, I was hoping he could...<eos> Write me a happy ending.<eos> But that book seems to have great power.<eos> Oh, it does.
You drinking again for that, right?<eos> I ask you, please, not to tell anyone.<eos> I'm trying to start again.<eos> After what you did?<eos> Well, neither I have been just an exemplary husband.<eos> - No, no, this has nothing to do with ... And anyone who tells you, that does not ?<eos> It was for this who? away from me.<eos> You do not know com '? live with me, Bego? To me endured for years ... and worth more?<eos> - I can not lose the family I have left.<eos> - No, no, nothing to do with your family.
Nah, my cousin Bebo can hook it up.<eos> He's the head locker room attendant there.<eos> He can get us a court<eos> - whenever we want. - Hmm! Ain't nobody there gonna mess with Bebo.<eos> Towels is where the power's at, T.<eos> Honestly, I think you got off pretty easy on this one, John.<eos> Yeah, I can live with tennis as a one-time thing.<eos> It'll get Billy off Theresa's back, and I get to whoop some ass on the court.<eos> Oh, I love cocky Johnny.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Ah, ha, ha.<eos> Oh, and on the back, he also has inscribed my favorite Bible verse,<eos> John 8:12.<eos> Oh, did he? "I am the light of the world."<eos> You are to me, baby.<eos> You are to me.<eos> You know, I am going to go and put this beautiful necklace on right now.<eos> Oh, you outdid yourself, padre.<eos> Come here.<eos> You sure did, padre.
Look, I'm not saying I took the money, but maybe the kid that did... And I'm just spitballing here...<eos> Maybe that kid needed a new mitt.<eos> And maybe his mom didn't have the cash to get him one, so, you know, if you think about it, that kid was kind of poor too.<eos> That box is for the people who don't have food to eat, John.<eos> Listen, I heard about your dad, and we've been praying for him.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> You know, those candles don't work unless you put $3 in them.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You have change for a 5?<eos> I do not.
I know.<eos> It's...<eos> - Dickheads.<eos> Honestly, I don't see him very often, but he did mention the other day that he got a shipment of artisanal soaps delivered, so I'm guessing, at the very least, he's clean.<eos> I mean, if he just had any idea of how pretentious he was,<eos> I'd take him back in a heartbeat.<eos> So you don't care that he's pretentious, as long as he knows he's pretentious.<eos> He's really cute, John.<eos> - If you like blonds.<eos> - Well, I do.
God, I loved the power.<eos> Well, my dad was a cop, so I'm a cop.<eos> That's the only reason?<eos> Well, that and the uniform.<eos> I don't like thinking about what I have to wear every day.<eos> Mailman never crossed your mind?<eos> I like the shorts idea, my head's too big for a safari hat.<eos> I'll be right back, I'm gonna run to the restroom.<eos> Hang on, you got a pass?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
And you thought you'd get the information off the GPS, locate Brooke's killer and deal with it yourself.<eos> More or less.<eos> But I would've left them breathing.<eos> Okay, why did Brooke stop calling home?<eos> My guess is she was ashamed.<eos> Of what?<eos> She got herself a job as a dancer at a local hula company.<eos> Sounds innocent enough, except for the part that it's a front for an escort service.<eos> They're running a joint investigation right now with the P.A.'s office.<eos> They do.
I don't have to be jealous.<eos> It's everybody else who should be jealous... of me.<eos> I got the best one.<eos> But I am also the hottest one.<eos> Yes, you are also the hottest one.<eos> Yo, yo, yo!<eos> - The pizza party?<eos> ! - Oh, my gosh, Eddie.<eos> You won?<eos> No, Cindy Horowitz did.
He stole $282 million from Baghdad in the middle of Operation Shock And Awe, abducted a CIA asset out of Iran during the '09 election protests.<eos> Later, he sold his secrets to Beijing.<eos> The CIA announced his death two months ago.<eos> We say that about a lot of the inmates at The Factory.<eos> Truth is Braxton's being interrogated for secrets he stole from the Chinese, from the Iranians, us.<eos> Well, my money's on the fact that these two have a history together.<eos> Reddington, Braxton-- they're planning something.<eos> Whatever it is, you're going to find out.<eos> Oh, we don't have authorization.<eos> You do now.
Carter, you need to be really careful here.<eos> You're talking about us going to Deanna and telling her--<eos> No, I'm not talking about talking some more.<eos> About meetings.<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> Plain and simple, we kill him before he kills us.<eos> Hello.<eos> Carter.<eos> - He heard.<eos> - I didn't.
Don't worry.<eos> Pretty sure... it's not loaded.<eos> Finch, get out on your... Balcony. Now.<eos> (Finch) Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do, or someone else will get hurt.<eos> Someone whose life still matters.<eos> No, your life matters. No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Hey, Ab, where you heading?<eos> Hey, not much... I mean, nowhere.<eos> I'm actually getting my wisdom teeth taken out today,<eos> - so I'm having surgery. - Oh, man,<eos> I had mine taken out the week of my prom.<eos> In all the pictures, I had these huge chipmunk cheeks.<eos> - I was like...<eos> - That's so cute.<eos> Yeah, it's good, though, 'cause, um, it'll make more room in my mouth, right?<eos> No, I, I didn't...

Uh-huh.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's getting tighter!<eos> Okay, no more horn.<eos> Cindy, does the python have a name?<eos> Lord Byron.<eos> That's a fancy name for a snake.<eos> Yeah, it looks more like a Paul.<eos> Listen, I didn't name it.<eos> My pretentious douche bag ex-boyfriend did.
Between her, you, Killian, I have to be the emotional bedrock for everyone.<eos> When's it my turn to be taken care of?<eos> You know what?<eos> Today.<eos> Today's my turn.<eos> I'm going to get absolutely snozzelled.<eos> Well, this is leading towards something dangerously misguided.<eos> We'll see how she likes taking care of me for a change.<eos> You probably don't want to get to "Level Two Jimmy drunk" around all these people.<eos> Or maybe I do.
Yeah.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, don't. Mmm.<eos> Shut up.<eos> This is just the thing to get your bodies to absorb all these nutrients.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please don't...
Nothing.<eos> They think I killed Lana.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> And you didn't warn me?<eos> After I found it, it was too late to text you and...<eos> Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How?<eos> You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
Why the hell did you tell me I was gonna be okay?<eos> - Did she?<eos> - You threw me under the bus.<eos> I'm a flawed person, but I'm not irredeemable, and I really want to take you out.<eos> My shift ends at 2:00 AM.<eos> If you're here, maybe you get my number.<eos> Miss Pierce?<eos> - You hacking into the Pentagon?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Careful, they don't do WikiLeak documentaries on brothers.
Hello, water treatment plant.<eos> Okay, we're off to a rocky start.<eos> They've got frickin' mini-golf. They've got frickin' Skee-Ball.<eos> They've got frickin' bumper boats. They've got frickin' go-carts.<eos> Is this you topless in the brochure?<eos> It is, thank you.<eos> Take a trip to historical Coach-town.<eos> Lunch will be provided.<eos> I don't eat yesterday's bread.<eos> Yes, you do.
I know.<eos> She's lucky to have you.<eos> I'm the lucky one.<eos> There's no one else like her.<eos> Hey, are we cool?<eos> 'Cause I don't want you to think I'm, like, a bad guy.<eos> Oh, what do you care what I think?<eos> We barely know each other.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
No, I am done taking fucking money from your fucking parents, Helen.<eos> How many times do I need to say that before it gets into your skull?<eos> Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna call a time-out.<eos> - Language. - Why are you being so awful?<eos> I'm sorry, I just... I have a really busy schedule today.<eos> I have a meeting with my editor right after this. - I can't be late.<eos> - Understood, Mr. Solloway.<eos> If you cooperate, this goes quicker.<eos> Do you even want custody of them?<eos> Of course I do.
Hi.<eos> Is this your daughter?<eos> Yeah, this is Joanie.<eos> Hi, Joanie.<eos> Uh, Gigi, I think...<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Oh, isn't she, though?<eos> Everybody says she looks like Alison, but to me she looks like her daddy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she does to me, too.
DNA, the right words, a dash of cardiac arrest, and it gets you into the bardo state. Allows you to connect with the subject's spirit. And?<eos> What'd you see?<eos> I saw through her eyes.<eos> She went outside, down the street, and then...<eos> I know where she was taken from.<eos> The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> You wore it when you got married?<eos> We all done.
You need a vision.<eos> Do it.<eos> I see blood.<eos> Widen your lens.<eos> We need an address.<eos> There-there was, there was a man and he was trying to tell me something.<eos> I need, uh, something to write. A pen and paper.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We have an address.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
What are you looking for?<eos> - Don't worry, baby.<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> - Donnie, why do you have a gun?<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, easy.<eos> - I've got a gun in my hands.<eos> - Donnie!<eos> You brought a gun to a drug deal?<eos> - What, are you crazy?<eos> - Of course, I did.
Well, Jill, I've been suspended from work, so I literally have to hang around the house all day.<eos> I don't think it's a good idea for you to be here right now.<eos> I'm sure there's places you can go.<eos> - This is mad.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> No, don't apologise.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> What's it said to you?<eos> Simon has had nothing to do with this.<eos> Yes, he... Yes, IT does!
I can't do that. I can't give up my job, I'd go mad.<eos> ~ Are you going to drive me to the station?<eos> ~ Sure. ~ I can...<eos> ~ I'll do it.<eos> Ring me, text me, and let me know you've got back safely.<eos> You look after yourself.<eos> Bye-bye, baby.<eos> She's your sister, you know that, don't you?<eos> You will think of her as your sister.<eos> Course I do.
- Hi. Greg is Flora's biological dad.<eos> Lawrence is my youngest.<eos> - Sorry, do you want to come through?<eos> Hello!<eos> Aren't babies great?<eos> I didn't really expect you to come all the way over from Manchester tonight.<eos> Oh, I'm delighted, I told you.<eos> It's... very kind of you.<eos> Well, we need to see what we can do, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do!
I think... .. on balance...<eos> I'd rather stick to the original plan.<eos> He keeps going up to my mum's plaque. At the chapel.<eos> ~ Up Blackley, where we scattered her ashes.<eos> ~ Why?<eos> Because he feels guilty.<eos> Look, Gary, no-one thinks you did it out of malice.<eos> Well, maybe. I dunno.<eos> Maybe he SHOULD feel a little bit guilty.<eos> Yeah, well, he does.
On the other hand, song time.<eos> Hey. [ Strumming stops ]<eos> Is Justin around? I just came to say goodbye.<eos> All: Bye.<eos> Another thing you should know is I have a very specific face blindness when it comes to ex-girlfriends of my buddies, so I'll be forgetting who you are in three, two, one.<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> You come here often?<eos> I know you guys are just sticking up for Justin, but my dad raised me himself.<eos> I don't really have a choice.<eos> No, you do, actually.
We talked to your school.<eos> The guidance counselor had these sketches on file that your art teacher had handed over.<eos> According to your school records, you've had a rough year.<eos> Anger issues.<eos> Verbal outbursts.<eos> At the time Everett was shot, your paintball team had just split up.<eos> Was there anyone who could account for you, just before the body was discovered?<eos> Make no mistake, Harris.<eos> We're gonna catch whoever did this.<eos> Not if I do first.
Sunny, could you promise me something?<eos> Somehow, could you find my mom?<eos> Tell her that I'm sorry? I tried to find her. I never gave up.<eos> I'll never be able to keep that promise, kid.<eos> Find your mom and tell her yourself.<eos> This is your way out.<eos> If you get caught, you will be killed.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Because I never had a choice.<eos> Now you do.
Put this place in my rear view.<eos> Miss me already?<eos> Inside.<eos> He's clear.<eos> Delacroix called it in himself.<eos> He was waiting for us when he showed up.<eos> Reporter called him, told him Stokes is gonna skate on Arthur's murder, told him about this place.<eos> So, Delacroix was waiting here for him this morning.<eos> Popped him when he came downstairs.<eos> Harry, don't.
I need you to get them to back off of it.<eos> Why can't you do it yourself?<eos> Because I don't know the lawyer on the other side. You do.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What the hell is he talking about?<eos> It's Scottie.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I know.<eos> Scottie doesn't do favors like this and I don't have any leverage on her.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Because you want to pretend to be my friend again.<eos> Louis, didn't you hear Jessica's speech?<eos> This is our chance to wipe the slate clean.<eos> I did hear her speech. And I know that she sent you here to say that to me.<eos> No one sent me here.<eos> I'm here because I want to be here.<eos> You see? That's sweet.<eos> But how can I ever believe a word you say?<eos> I want to know if you ever thought once to tell me the truth about Mike.<eos> No, I didn't.
Latest technologies - night-vision goggles, eh?<eos> Erm, can't see anything.<eos> Exactly... just like night.<eos> Wow!<eos> Amazing!<eos> I'll take them.<eos> Course you will.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Now no-one will see me coming.<eos> Well, I did.
No grown man who wears saddle shoes is without blame.<eos> This was fine when it was a victimless crime, but now there's a victim, and his stupid, stupid name is atlas.<eos> Confessing is the right thing to do. Oh.<eos> Do we have to?<eos> Can't we just blame somebody else?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Black Benny?<eos> Jakey, don't make me try to throw a drink at you again.<eos> Mm, I don't want you to do that.<eos> - Nobody does. - Mm-mm.
I've been worried about you. Don't be.<eos> Thank you for bringing my stuff.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> You could have just shipped it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I was coming up this way anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at.<eos> I thought you lost the ranch.<eos> Yeah, I did.
She said to tell John that Stacey has the owl.<eos> When did she give you this message?<eos> Last night.<eos> So that's not true, is it?<eos> 'Cause Alice is dead.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Look, I'm just here to help.<eos> And how did you know Alice?<eos> I don't.
Sorry.<eos> No. That's all right. I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, it's been six hours of this, and I...<eos> I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> Is it the heart murmur thing?<eos> No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Of course I do.
And before you try to seduce me, just know it's been tried before.<eos> All right, now, get yourself in the Gremlin there. Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> All right.<eos> Sit yourself down.<eos> And when Raylan comes back with my keys, we're gonna make the change, and it's nice in there.<eos> I got an air freshener smells like a mocha latte.<eos> - You hear that?<eos> - Uh, no, I di...<eos> Yes, I did.
- Deal.<eos> It's tempting, but the answer's still no.<eos> My terms.<eos> You and your men leave now, and we let you live.<eos> Start walking.<eos> I like everything that just happened except that you let Azmorigan live.<eos> That'll be a problem for me later.<eos> I think you have a problem now.<eos> You don't have the credits you owe us, do you?<eos> In fact, you never did.
The Force is strong with him.<eos> Kanan, let's find out how strong.<eos> - How can I help?<eos> - Just remember your training.<eos> Enemy ship closing to attack range.<eos> There's something familiar.<eos> I feel... Cold.<eos> I think I know who it is.<eos> Back on Lothal I felt something.<eos> Kanan did too.
What was the nature of their relationship?<eos> She barely knew him.<eos> He came to our house for a party once.<eos> Lexi wasn't feeling well, and she went up to bed.<eos> I decided to go check on her about a half an hour later, and she was passed out on the bed.<eos> And Dennis was on top of her trying to take her clothes off.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Well, I pulled him off of her, and I told him to get the hell out of my house.<eos> You called the police.<eos> No, I didn't.
Now, Abby, I've set up that box so that you could ensure<eos> - customer satisfaction.<eos> - What about MY satisfaction?<eos> Manion's isn't responsible for YOUR satisfaction.<eos> I'll leave that to the next poor, besotted soul entrapped by your feminine wiles.<eos> I'm sorry, what was that?<eos> I couldn't hear it over the sound of your shirt.<eos> As General Manager of Manion's, I expect you to respect my wishes and address all questions and comments.<eos> "Why doesn't Manion's offer vegan options?"<eos> Oh, it does!
Turns out he was at the debate tournament at the time of Rebecca's murder.<eos> But I've got something on the Max Rager front.<eos> I've been digging in Rebecca's phone records.<eos> Jackson and Richmond aren't people.<eos> They're cities.<eos> Richmond was a woman whose daughter was doing a double at a burger joint, when she threw fry oil all over some loudmouth customers.<eos> No history of vience. She just lost it.<eos> Like Jason.<eos> Rebecca asked mom if Fry Girl drank Max Rager.<eos> She did.
- marking them.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> But for what?<eos> Wes, slow down. I don't understand.<eos> I'm at the hospital.<eos> Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
She trusted him.<eos> Looks like she shouldn't have.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Espo's bringing him in. (TELEPHONE RINGING)<eos> I'll let you take that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hello?<eos> You referred a case to me!<eos> Oh, so you took it?<eos> Yeah, of course, I did.
Britta, this is my boss.<eos> From Honda?<eos> In public you'll refer to us as Hilary from now on.<eos> Continue.<eos> There's a program we can be in, where we covertly market as a team, we can be a couple in a relationship in public.<eos> We can walk down the street holding hands.<eos> If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.<eos> Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?<eos> You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm gonna go get a shovel, because theater is dead.<eos> Hi Starburns.<eos> Todd, you know you don't have to creep around to be weird, right?<eos> You're weird at picnics.<eos> Did you hear about the paintball game?<eos> Yeah, I heard there was no paintball. I heard it was banned.<eos> Well, you can't believe everything you hear.<eos> Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole.<eos> Do you know why I beat you, Todd?<eos> Seriously, you don't?
Hey. Mazel tov.<eos> So, a stranger walked over to our very proud group and smashed our pride into pieces with a hammer, which definitely felt like a disaster.<eos> Then, I started to pick up the pieces of our pride, and weirdly enough, the first piece I picked up was my own pride, all of it.<eos> It's almost like groups and people in groups, can never be complete at the same time.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> No?<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> I love you, Abed.<eos> Do I know how to be a good wedding guest?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Brick's birthday... in November!<eos> What month are we in now?<eos> February.<eos> Yeah, that's bad.<eos> You know, it's been so long, at this point, maybe we should just float it to next year.<eos> That's what we did last year. Ugh!<eos> We're treating him like a leap-year baby. Sue's birthday...<eos> that's coming up, too!<eos> Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.

Sue's birthday...<eos> that's coming up, too!<eos> Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.<eos> Brick, listen...<eos> Um, I don't even know if you're aware of this, but, um, it's come to my attention that it's possible we might have missed your birthday.<eos> Oh, you did.<eos> You definitely did.
Well, Castro's not in the race anymore, so why are you still in?<eos> I have 90 volunteers working for me, five paid consultants, small donations from 38,000 people, all trying to help me win.<eos> And you're asking why am I<eos> - still in? - Look, let's just take...<eos> No!<eos> If I were a man...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> you never would've... This is about two people trying to run a law firm.<eos> This has nothing to do with sexism.<eos> Like hell it doesn't.
I shouldn't have said anything, but we are gonna need to talk about it.<eos> Of course.<eos> As soon as this is over, you can ask me anything, I promise.<eos> OK.<eos> Hey! I think I found Strauss' go-between.<eos> She's a paralegal on his defense team named Juliana Barnes.<eos> She visited him in jail more often than anybody else, frequently alone, and she recently paid off 100 grand in debt.<eos> We got to talk to her.<eos> Do you like ironing?<eos> Most people don't.
When our "Street Fighter" game and Loggy's honor are on the line,<eos> I got no problem taking on 16 kids.<eos> That's when I pulled out my dad's machete...<eos> It grazed my arm, but I recovered.<eos> 'Cause I'm Eddie Huang, and I'm your street fighter!<eos> Hail to the chief, y'all.<eos> Say hello to the new sixth grade president.<eos> I'm the Abe Lincoln of Abe Lincoln middle school!<eos> Looks like our good luck continues.<eos> Sure does.
You understand that this disqualifies you?<eos> Yes, I understand that.<eos> I'll have to remove you from all cases involving the Security Service.<eos> - I can determine...<eos> - It's for your own good.<eos> There, that's settled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do.
Previously on The Strain...<eos> As of 9:00 a.m. this morning,<eos> Staten Island is a plague-free zone.<eos> I want you to do what you've done here for the rest of the city.<eos> No interference.<eos> I call the shots, end of story.<eos> - You work for the German.<eos> - I did a job for him once.
Not his usual body man, Reggie Fitzwilliam.<eos> You're suggesting Mr. Fitzwilliam had enough and quit?<eos> I don't know, it could be a dead end or a wild goose chase.<eos> Palmer ordered Fitzwilliam to murder us, and he didn't... and now he's gone.<eos> Fitzwilliam has no other legal address than the Stoneheart corporate headquarters.<eos> But he does have a brother named Curtis.<eos> A firefighter who lives on Staten Island?<eos> You probably don't want to waste your time with this.<eos> I think you may be onto something.<eos> You do?
- Shit, they're gone.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.<eos> - What now?<eos> - We have to find the vampires that were nesting here. We need to know if the infection spread.<eos> So, you're gonna go knocking on doors looking for sick vampires?<eos> Hmm?<eos> After dark?<eos> If the professor suggested that, you'd lock him away in here.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah. I do.
Yeah. I do.<eos> You're not still thinking about blowing up the subway tunnel entrance?<eos> Have your fun, and I'll have mine.<eos> We need the truck to get back.<eos> All right, well, with these patrols out, it's easier for me on foot.<eos> - I know every shortcut in town.<eos> - You're actually going through with this?<eos> You're gonna blow up a New York City subway station?<eos> I thought you liked architecture.<eos> I do, Doc.
Garbage.<eos> - Worthless garbage.<eos> - Hey, don't insult the man!<eos> He's not here to defend himself.<eos> See, me myself personally, now I done seen 'em all.<eos> Right, they got uh,<eos> Silver Angel vs. the Robot Assassin.<eos> No, no, how about the Silver Angel vs. the Rage of the Witch?<eos> Ooh! Hey, and that one, there's this part right where, where this crazy bitch is about to light this little boy on fire, right?<eos> And Angel, he does this backflip, and just... just bah!
- I'm back for good.<eos> - OK, good.<eos> Nora told me about last night.<eos> That must have been - really scary.<eos> - I think I saw Mom.<eos> - Was it Mom? - I don't know.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Nora saw her.<eos> - Tell him, Nora.<eos> - I already did.
At the bottom of the blackboard.<eos> No, Helga.<eos> Helga.<eos> I brought you a snack.<eos> You're seasoning me now?<eos> No, thanks!<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Did you hear me ask,<eos> "Would you care for some pineapple?"<eos> No, you did not.
Josh, it's Sofia.<eos> She just called me from the airport, and she never got your message.<eos> What?<eos> Her phone was off the whole time.<eos> Look, she didn't reject you, she just never got your message.<eos> Oh my god, then she never has to hear it!<eos> Why would you not want her to hear it?<eos> Because I'm a human being who can experience shame?<eos> Look, I've been racking my brain trying to figure out a way to make this less awkward when I see her, and now I don't have to.<eos> Yes, you do!
Gonna be puttering around all day?<eos> Just getting the place in order.<eos> Well, I thought you might just be, uh, procrastinating 'cause you don't know how to go back to the ship and tell that crew of yours that you're quitting.<eos> Do you not realize that they... that they can't do it without you?<eos> What kind of message are you gonna send to them, that you're, uh, George Washington and you've come back to work on your farm?<eos> You think because you got a... a lab in Baltimore and six planes with the cure that everything's in hand?<eos> The world is in chaos.<eos> There's a lot more to do.<eos> And that crew is trained to do it, with or without me. - They need you.<eos> - And they don't?
If Alex beats you to that laptop, you'll all be dead.<eos> All of us will be.<eos> We go at 6 A.M.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be back as soon as it arrives.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
But the SVR provided all that equipment down there, and I guarantee you the room is miked.<eos> I don't care if Victor knows what I think of him.<eos> You might not need one, but I sure as hell do.<eos> What the... what's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> You're with him!<eos> I knew that you were back then.<eos> But it ended.<eos> You told me it ended.<eos> - It did.
The pep!<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> I'm an idiot. There's obviously nothing going on between Riley and Danny.<eos> So, I just wanted to apologize for the other night on the roof.<eos> Kinda caught me by surprise.<eos> Oh, no need to apologize. I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> It had just been a really emotional day.<eos> The big "I love Ben" announcement.<eos> And you really do, right?
Anyway, you didn't ask if you could use his goop.<eos> Malory, the whole thing about me using his "goop" was your idea!<eos> Prove it.<eos> So now let's talk about this name, Abbiejean.<eos> Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a...<eos> Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.<eos> I much very do.
You got a D?<eos> My teacher says that I need a tutor.<eos> He said that public high school didn't prepare me for Rossmore's standards.<eos> Jeez, Bridge.<eos> You're getting a D.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you say something before?<eos> It's not some tragedy.<eos> And calculus is hard.<eos> Conor does shitty all the time.
Oh, fuck, not my car.<eos> It's fucking fantastic.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> This is the best plan you came up with in years.<eos> - When does Napier land?<eos> - An hour.<eos> I'm very worried about this.<eos> I hardly ever have business on this side - of the building anymore.<eos> - Well, you do today.
I'm gonna need my settlement money now.<eos> I'm not signing over all that money just so you can give it to somebody you just met, Bunch.<eos> Maybe he'd act more grown up if you didn't treat him like a fucking baby!<eos> Mind your business.<eos> We're in love.<eos> You better get used to me.<eos> What else?<eos> Well, yesterday I met a man, brown hair, short, seems to be in charge of running numbers.<eos> Got a name?<eos> Matter of fact I do.
Hi, um, I need a cab from the mar...<eos> Hello?<eos> I got a cab right here.<eos> So where am I going?<eos> The End.<eos> And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
- Had.<eos> - It's over?<eos> Please don't look at me like that, Helen.<eos> If we don't give her the room to make these little mistakes, then she's gonna resent it so much she's not gonna come to us if ever she gets in big trouble again.<eos> I just want us to be an option for her, don't you?<eos> Maybe you just don't want to take responsibility for her anymore.<eos> 'Cause I don't agree with you?<eos> No, because we fucked her up, and you just don't want to admit it.<eos> Helen, don't you have any memory of how you were at her age?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's done.<eos> You're really late.<eos> My fault. Totally my fault. Ah, Eden.<eos> Where's the turkey?<eos> Shit, I knew we forgot something.<eos> - I'll go get it right now.<eos> - No, it's closed.<eos> Noah, do you want to listen to your baby's heartbeat?<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm gonna do a little work right here.<eos> You know, actually, if I could put in my two cents,<eos> I've been giving a lot of thought to, uh, the role of Alison.<eos> What do you call her in the book, again?<eos> The, uh, whatever.<eos> Anyway, stick with me here, little outside the box.<eos> As Alison, Sasha Grey.<eos> How hot would that be?<eos> You know who she is, right?<eos> No, you don't.
I come to you heart in hand.<eos> My people, our very way of life depend upon you.<eos> If you'll just speak to the President.<eos> I know he listens to you.<eos> He's his own man.<eos> At the end of the day, he'll call it like he sees it.<eos> Well, perhaps my route has some practical applications that are escaping you at the moment.<eos> Not long ago, I received a telegram from you inquiring about the Hatchites.<eos> I responded that I didn't know their location.<eos> I did.
No, I like everyone.<eos> Not Jack.<eos> Face it, he makes you mad.<eos> No. No.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> The whole time you've been saying no, you've been nodding yes.<eos> I... I don't like Jack?<eos> I... I don't like Jack.<eos> I... I don't.
- Is for you to waive all of your visitation rights and have no contact with us at all.<eos> Bye-bye, visitation rights.<eos> - [chuckles] - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah. Yup.<eos> - What is this?<eos> Are you on something, or...<eos> No, I'm not on anything, I'm just--<eos> I'm just-- What you're saying<eos> - makes me happy.<eos> - It does? It does.
Sent us away. Then... he killed himself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All this time, I thought she was your girlfriend or something.<eos> She raised me... as her own.<eos> Mats?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - You can't just walk back in.<eos> - Please, just listen.<eos> I get it, OK?<eos> I didn't before, but I do now.
You planned this.<eos> If I help you, you'll have David's power.<eos> Hundreds of millions of brand-new minds waking up across the world wanting a freedom the humans will never give.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't kill our family.<eos> Look at Leo.<eos> He'll die, too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> - He didn't want me.<eos> - He does now.
Look at Leo.<eos> He'll die, too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> - He didn't want me.<eos> - He does now.<eos> He wants Beatrice.<eos> I'm not her.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
I won't.<eos> The other offer's still on the table if you change your mind.<eos> You know I'm a lot more persuasive when I get what I want.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't able to get to angelica in time.<eos> I'm sure you did everything in your power to help her.<eos> You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
You can't keep pulling me from the path of oncoming trains.<eos> There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does. Gabriel.<eos> He's a psychic.<eos> There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
12 tops.<eos> Or we could go to a restaurant. No big deal.<eos> It's not like we're hiring a caterer.<eos> We don't have a gift registry or anything.<eos> Sure. Okay.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do?

Why not?<eos> Because Peterson is ruthless and determined, and he won't stop until he's destroyed both of you.<eos> Now we knew he was gonna make a move like this sooner or later.<eos> Now it is time for us to make our move.<eos> Which is what, exactly?<eos> The hearings are in three days.<eos> Well, I think I can come up with something if...you both want me involved.<eos> No, no, this is -- this is not your problem. Wait a minute.<eos> Dennis tells me you have one of the trickiest and most devious minds he's worked with.<eos> He did, did he?
I really don't know.<eos> We... we were just talking.<eos> Well, I told her about how hard things had been for my mother.<eos> Maybe because I opened up to her, she... she felt like opening up to me.<eos> Maybe she's lonely.<eos> God, yeah, I... I imagine that's a pretty lonely life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I... I imagine it is.<eos> Women... women seem to trust you.<eos> They do?
It's here.<eos> The music's coming from the other side of this wall.<eos> We need to breach this wall.<eos> You do you, Junior.<eos> It wasn't a question.<eos> ♪ Am I beautiful ♪ - Clear.<eos> - ♪ Even at my ugliest, you always say ♪<eos> We found Rentman's tree house, uh, a bunker under, uh...<eos> Who knows?<eos> I do.
We don't have time for that.<eos> You can have soup after I clean your ear, but then you have to go.<eos> Beautiful point.<eos> Can we play?<eos> I'm gonna be late for work.<eos> Just one game.<eos> How about that shower now?<eos> Okay.<eos> I see you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- No, unless your sheriff is also a judge, his orders are meaningless.<eos> This young man has not been cleared by his doctor or fully evaluated by his counsel.<eos> And until we know he can physically withstand the transfer, he's not going anywhere.<eos> You take him one step out of this room, and I will crawl up your ass with a court order that will make your lives very uncomfortable for the foreseeable future.<eos> Be smart, boys.<eos> You're in my wheelhouse.<eos> I know you from somewhere.<eos> My name is Jamie Nelson.<eos> You defended Rick Allen grace.<eos> Yes, I did.
That's good.<eos> She coping?<eos> Oh, she's trying to make sense of it, you know.<eos> She said he definitely wasn't on any meds, though.<eos> No, uh, unnecessary stress?<eos> No, not since Walt was killed.<eos> She says she saw him a week and a half ago, made him dinner, everything seemed normal.<eos> I mean, Terry, Kaleb and Walt liked each other, you know?<eos> Did you ever hear about them ever having problems?<eos> No, I really didn't.
So I figured I'd make my mark.<eos> Oh, so, you looking for attention?<eos> You got my attention now.<eos> What?<eos> What you want to say?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> What?<eos> I said, "come on, man." It don't got to be like this, man.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell you doing, man?
Oh, no service!<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... you know, it has been a lovely adventure, hasn't it?<eos> But should we head back and truffle up our dinner?<eos> We could, or... I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road.<eos> We could hike.<eos> Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits.<eos> Neither did Adam and Eve.
Heads, you stay.<eos> Livia... I'll replace you with a donkey.<eos> Get that, will you, Caiaphas?<eos> Head.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You both may go.<eos> I need to speak with your high priest.<eos> And the lesson is, don't play politics unless you're good at it.<eos> This coin... It has two heads.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
The energy provides a stable limited connection.<eos> That's why they needed to build it in that exact location.<eos> The two sides need to be exactly the same In both time periods or else it's not gonna work.<eos> They are very likely bringing people back from their future.<eos> The supplies they've stolen? Blood?<eos> Medicine?<eos> Those are the kinds of things an army needs.<eos> Yeah, for an invasion.<eos> We have to stop it.<eos> Yeah, of course we do.
what's up with that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He got a money order for cash.<eos> - Maybe it's some sort of payoff.<eos> - The same day he was killed?<eos> The same day Jay Butler disappeared.<eos> Did you know that because of all the pollution, the bass are changing sexes,<eos> - Oh. It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- I found a number registered in Crane's name.<eos> Tried to call it, but the phone's powered off.<eos> Frankie recanvassed the crime scene and the dorm but didn't find the phone itself.<eos> Did you subpoena the carrier for the phone records?<eos> Yeah. Still waiting.<eos> - Oh, it's from Winston. - Hmm.<eos> "I'd ri..." Oh, Winston's the naughty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - God, I love cowboys.<eos> - Who doesn't?
Maura, I really am sorry.<eos> I may never be able to express how much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're... probably busy, but a colleague of mine is speaking this evening on the development of the Khmuic tribes of, uh, Thailand and Laos.<eos> The Khmu language is wonderfully rhythmic.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> And Dr. Moore is quite engaging.<eos> We used to enjoy the occasional anthropology lecture, didn't we?<eos> We did.
Have you seen Nina?<eos> - All right, I'll try her cell.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Uh, we need to talk.<eos> What is wrong?<eos> There was a meeting ... me, Maura, Mom.<eos> And Mom has decided that she should move in with me so that you can live with Maura.<eos> That works.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> It does not!
You better hide your secret tiny, tiny porn.<eos> You weren't kidding.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Okay. What's up?<eos> What I say cannot leave this room.<eos> What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
Mnh, she didn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So I knocked on the door. Nobody answered.<eos> I went inside, I went up the stairs, and I saw Mrs. Jaquard's door open.<eos> I could see her inside, lying on the bed, pulling up the sheets... as Arthur came out, buttoning up his shirt.<eos> Up until then, he was...<eos> He broke my heart.<eos> Oh, Maura.<eos> So he... begged me not to say anything.<eos> I didn't, to anyone.
- Look at that face.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I wonder if whoever tried to kill him knows that he's still alive.<eos> When is his competition that he's supposed to be in?<eos> Every day this weekend at the Convention Center.<eos> And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.
She died from a more lethal kind of strychnine. - How?<eos> - Police say someone put it in her coffee.<eos> Quiet, boy.<eos> - Ah, sounds like Duke is missing Mona.<eos> - Sounds like you're missing Duke.<eos> - I really liked that big guy.<eos> - Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.<eos> Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler when she was a little kid.<eos> She doesn't like big dogs.<eos> - Yeah, but you do.

- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, we better not.<eos> This sucks.<eos> Oh, boy, she does not need an espresso.<eos> Well this is my fault.<eos> - It's not.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> Because you've been left alone, unsupervised with way too much free time, for far too long.<eos> - I don't need to be supervised.<eos> - Clearly you do.
Yes, Gerald.<eos> Sheila, darling... our congratulations and very best wishes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um... Yes.<eos> To both of you.<eos> She's not bad really, Gerald.<eos> Got a bit of a temper - watch out for the right hook.<eos> - Chump.<eos> - Really, I hope you find happiness.<eos> I really do.
Thank you for saying all this nice stuff.<eos> It's time to go inside.<eos> We got a crawl to finish. Yeah. We got a crawl to finish.<eos> Now out of my way, I'm getting another drink.<eos> I can't let you in.<eos> You're not wearing shoes.<eos> Where are you shoes, Nick?<eos> Honestly, I threw 'em at a squirrel.<eos> - Everybody's waiting for you. - I can't go into the bar.<eos> I don't shoes on.
Another contraction? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I'll leave you now.<eos> Rachael, you seem like a fine young woman.<eos> And, uh, stay strong.<eos> You're in good hands.<eos> We should go.<eos> - I'm gonna take you to the clinic, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> You see that flower in there?<eos> Yeah, I did.
(Peter) Once again, sorry about the spit-up.<eos> Don't even...<eos> Yeah, wow. What a great night, huh?<eos> Bye, Dr. P. Bye-bye.<eos> Why would you tell him you were cheating with Mindy?<eos> Sorry, it just popped out.<eos> You also said I was a cheater, for the record.<eos> And a lot of people think<eos> Dr. L and I do have a very palpable chemistry.<eos> No, they don't.
That's my boyfriend. My boobs!<eos> God! Why don't you pick on boobs your own size?<eos> Are you really cheating on me with this nerd, Alex?<eos> Is this because I fell asleep during your TED Talk?<eos> It was so boring. It was ten minutes.<eos> They can be very tedious.<eos> Mindy... uh, meet my girlfriend, Grace.<eos> Did I not say "girlfriend" earlier?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> But I didn't either.
And the best way to do that is to get him to say yes.<eos> You ever spend time around a toddler?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Like, "No, no, no, no!"<eos> It's the same thing with these cons.<eos> Some gangster wants something that belongs to you, get him saying yes, and watch the resistance just fall away.<eos> Okay, first question.<eos> Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia? Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
That's not all we found.<eos> Finn, you're gonna want to see this.<eos> We recovered partial prints from Rebecca Lowell's house... in the kitchen, in the living room, in the bedroom.<eos> Everywhere. The prints came back to Daniel Shaw.<eos> He's been there.<eos> Staying there. Shaw is Winthrop's partner.<eos> So, you worked with my dad in Seattle?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Then you must know Julie Finlay, too.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What is it?<eos> What book?<eos> I'm proud of you, Ali.<eos> I mean, you took this place and made it yours.<eos> Well, it's essentially the same, but...<eos> But that's not why you asked me here.<eos> No.<eos> I thought we should talk about the campaign mixer and... you know...<eos> You know?<eos> No, I don't.
Or we could just kiss.<eos> No, no, Jason, no.<eos> You need to stop this.<eos> - I'm married.<eos> - I know. Hey, marriage is complicated.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
I'm sick of this shit! You okay?<eos> yeah.<eos> It didn't penetrate the glove.<eos> Well, i'm guessing that's the stuff they want me to deliver.<eos> We need to test it.<eos> How?<eos> On what?<eos> I don't know, but we cannot take that with us Until we know more about it.<eos> How do we know it'll work on the espheni?<eos> - We don't.
Yes.<eos> And you could still be critical to our objective.<eos> I've been given some time back, dad, A chance to fight for more, Experience the life you gave me the way i was meant to.<eos> We've both been given a second chance. It's important that we make it count.<eos> So this little guy has been struck twice, And still nothing.<eos> You think the same applies for us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> When this thing snatched our new formula Back into its capsule, It suddenly became non-lethal.<eos> How do we know this does not disrupt the ingredient Lethal to the espheni?<eos> We don't, not yet.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was just watching you and thinking... thank God for Libby Masters.<eos> Oh. You've been so kind to Joy and beyond generous to me.<eos> Over these past few months, if it hadn't been for you, I don't...<eos> Of course.<eos> Anything for friends.<eos> Your mother's rocking the baby, humming "Chattanooga Choo Choo"...<eos> Honey, Lisa lapped up every last drop of that ice cream--<eos> Did you know she was going to do that tonight, throw Bill at me in that way?<eos> You did.
You didn't wait for him to leave you, like you-- like you did with me.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> That's how you've changed.<eos> You know that there's-- there's something more, something-- something better.<eos> And you know that-- that you deserve it.<eos> Or you would have stayed.<eos> But-- but I'm alone.<eos> I am all alone.<eos> I don't know what to do now.<eos> I don't...
Actually, I might know someone who's a whole lot better than nothing.<eos> I talked with Zookeeper Steve this morning.<eos> They were astounded at our success with Gil.<eos> Can't imagine how we managed to pull that off.<eos> Well... what happened yesterday was no solution at all.<eos> I wasn't looking for a solution.<eos> - I was looking for an answer.<eos> - To what? Whether or not it could be done...<eos> Whether I could do it-- we could do it.<eos> And we did.
In the meantime, to, convince you to get past your objections to the smell of my casino...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please enjoy yourselves.<eos> It's on the house.<eos> We have one more candidate.<eos> This is Nora Everett.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't seem to find your file, Miss Everett.<eos> Do you... do you remember what year you participated in the study?<eos> I didn't.
In St. Louis?<eos> You may not realize this, but St. Louis is rapidly becoming Paris on the Mississippi.<eos> Well, you've got the climatron at the botanical garden.<eos> 175-foot geodesic dome, re-creating the climate of a lowland rainforest.<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, so happy that you're enjoying your time as a tourist, but starting tomorrow, I need you back in your business suits.<eos> We are beginning the next phase of scent research.<eos> We don't have another round of scent research.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
Trying to control other people doesn't work, ever.<eos> The only person you can control is yourself.<eos> I certainly hope that you didn't tip him.<eos> Of course I tipped him.<eos> Who gets into a taxi and says, "We're from out of town.<eos> Take whatever route you'd like"?<eos> The man drove us through Brooklyn, Bill.<eos> Ah, so what if he did?<eos> It was worth the extra $2 to get a view of that skyline, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't.
In fact, Bill has a very lovely wife.<eos> Mm, you've met?<eos> No, but I've seen her picture on your desk.<eos> You don't bring her along when you travel?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Oh, why's that?<eos> Surely she would like a trip to New York, wouldn't she?<eos> Yes, but we do have three children at home.<eos> Do you have pictures?<eos> I don't, no.
Okay, that is enough, Detective.<eos> I am not done here, ma'am.<eos> Yes, I would say you are done.<eos> I am not gonna subject my child to any more of this.<eos> I can bring him down to the station<eos> - if that's what you prefer.<eos> - Do not threaten me, sir.<eos> - Johnny, I need you to go to y--<eos> - I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Okay.<eos> Actually, we could've been friends, you and I.<eos> Can't we still?<eos> I think it's a little awkward, don't you, seeing as how my husband's in love with you?<eos> Don't insult me by acting surprised.<eos> Danny told me. He-- he told you...<eos> He always tells me.<eos> We've been through this before.<eos> Did you think you were different?<eos> They all do.
Because-- because, without that, it just-- it just plays out in exactly the same way.<eos> Another son without a father becomes a father who doesn't know how to love his son.<eos> And if... If I stay, they have a chance to fix what is broken.<eos> Libby, are you, um... Are you saying that this is what you need to do now, for the time being, or what you need to do forever?<eos> Is there nothing I can get you?<eos> Just the check, thank you.<eos> Right away, monsieur.<eos> So, I have to ask.<eos> How exactly did you expect things to go tonight?<eos> Just the way they did.
Yes, it is my business.<eos> I don't want my son exposed to a debauched rock star who's doing drugs.<eos> He's a vegan and he's sober.<eos> Bertie's parents?<eos> You can come in now.<eos> I need to show you something that could be a problem.<eos> Morning Joe did the exact same story I produced for the health segment tonight. Read it.<eos> - That is odd.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> MSNBC did your fecal impaction story.
Is that Moby?<eos> Hey, what's up, Moby?<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> My son, please.<eos> Oh, Vivian's getting him.<eos> Walter, I have a question for you.<eos> When you shave your head, do you use a straight razor or clippers?<eos> 'Cause I tried using a straight razor and I took big chunks out of my scalp and there was blood everywhere.<eos> But when I look at your scalp, I don't see any nicks or cuts.<eos> So how do you do that?
Back, back, back.<eos> - What?<eos> - Go back, go back, go back.<eos> - We gotta go back?<eos> - Yes, go back.<eos> - Okay. - Fuck.<eos> Hello, Officer.<eos> Just having a little seat belt problem.<eos> You didn't see that red light, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
Carpool's gonna be here in ten minutes.<eos> All right, you two warriors. Let me see this.<eos> Let's go, Supermen.<eos> To school!<eos> Capes down, brush your teeth, grab your backpacks.<eos> I really appreciate you rearranging your day like this. - I know it's a pain. - Hey.<eos> Comes with the territory when you are married to a real superhero.<eos> I'll make it up to you tonight.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - You always do.
- You're trespassing. - No.<eos> This is our home now, and we're not going anywhere.<eos> Look I really don't have time for this.<eos> I've got business to attend to.<eos> What business could you possibly have in a world without magic?<eos> The business of my happiness.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Oh, you're here to find The Author, aren't you?<eos> So she told you.<eos> Of course she did.
Emma.<eos> The mad hag who was locked in the tower.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you out of your chains.<eos> You're the one that's hard to recognize... both of you.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> Tell me... who are we?<eos> You're my parents.<eos> I'm the product of your true love.<eos> You taught me how to be a hero, you taught me how to believe in hope.<eos> And I do.
The next army to advance will be ours.<eos> We will have opportunity again<eos> To make our own history and defy their history<eos> And claim for ourselves<eos> What others believe to be rightfully theirs.<eos> I see him.<eos> I hear-- i hear his voice.<eos> He was my brother, above all else.<eos> And i loved him.<eos> So did i.
They only serve me wine in this palace.<eos> They think this is beneath me.<eos> A good beer is beneath no one.<eos> My lord.<eos> Lagus.<eos> It seems an age ago, that night in the alley When you came to my aid.<eos> Thank you for being a trusted friend.<eos> A loyal servant.<eos> What i did not know that night Is that you did not need my aid.<eos> Yes, i did, as i do now.
All three kids were on Sway, trying to make a splash.<eos> Chromachron used his telekinesis to try to stop a robber's bullet.<eos> As you can see, he eventually succeeded.<eos> As to what happened to these two, I'm still working that out.<eos> But I'd hazard a guess that it was not what they intended.<eos> Now, are there any stupid questions?<eos> Okay. So, you showed me some things.<eos> I wanna bust Royalle as much as you. But Wolfe is evil.<eos> - Do you believe in evil?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, I'll see you then!<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus!<eos> I didn't know if you didn't hear me or if you were just ignoring me.<eos> I was on the phone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Really late, if this thing that I have been trying to make happen actually..., uh..., you know, happens.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whatever you think about my job, it is the only thing that is keeping a roof over our heads right now.<eos> And when Zora does well, hon', we do well.
You can't just wrap her up in plastic like garbage.<eos> Can I just...<eos> Can I just have a moment alone with her, please?<eos> Oh, Alex.<eos> I thought she was your partner.<eos> She was.<eos> Something more developed?<eos> Alex, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> - Son, we really didn't. - Just...
And for the record, I'm mad at my mom.<eos> That she lied to both of us.<eos> Yeah, well, she was just doing what she thought was best for you.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> I'm just sayin'... you aren't the only one that made mistakes, so don't blame yourself.<eos> If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Whatever happens, you can trust me, just know that... honest.<eos> I know.<eos> I do.<eos> Oh, Robert, sorry.<eos> Um, you have a call.<eos> It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
Eugene disappears sometimes to Atlantic City, once to Vegas, but he always calls, and he's never gone for more than a few days.<eos> And I understand there's some incident that happened before his absence...<eos> Eugene came home.<eos> He said he got an anonymous tip about trespassers over by one of the marina docks. The Lieutenant went to check it out, came back about an hour later, said he got the scare of his life.<eos> He ran into an FBI agent on one of the old ships, said she pulled out a gun as he was boarding.<eos> An FBI agent?<eos> Said the FBI was looking for two fugitives who escaped Cumberland the night before.<eos> If something happened to Eugene, it's got to be one of them. Don't you think?<eos> This agent he spoke with... is there any chance your husband got a name?<eos> He did better than that.
Gillian's lovely, by the way.<eos> Well.<eos> So funny.<eos> So sweet.<eos> So uncomplicated.<eos> Her heart's in the right place.<eos> So, what was he upset for?<eos> I thought he never wanted it.<eos> Well, no.<eos> He didn't.
The year Gillian was born, you were...?<eos> Did Eileen know? No.<eos> It's like I'd said to Gillian, it stopped before it started.<eos> ~ It was never...<eos> ~ So what does Gillian know about it?<eos> Her date. On Valentine's Day.<eos> It weren't a date as such.<eos> It were him.<eos> How long did it go on?<eos> It didn't.
Um, perhaps we might call the secretary?<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> I'm on my way to a meeting with the attorney general and DOJ.<eos> I'm sure that we can work all this out in a timely manner.<eos> No reason to call the secretary.<eos> What we need here are some back-channel negotiations.<eos> I think we need front-channel negotiations.<eos> You should go to Texas and meet with your former boss.<eos> Should we order some dessert? I hope they still have that strawberry savarin.<eos> And they do!
And that bloody knife that Toby found I probably have my prints all over it.<eos> I think it was a good choice to get rid of it. Yeah.<eos> We should do the same thing with the stuff in the bin.<eos> Hanna. Mona's body could seriously be in that barrel. Do you want to burn that, too?<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> But we can put it somewhere.<eos> If we touch anything, that's tampering with the evidence.<eos> Evidence that could convict Ali. And me.<eos> And I don't have a good alibi.<eos> Yes, you do.
So technically, they're mine.<eos> Until someone buys them.<eos> I have a list of questions here from last year's pageant.<eos> Let's try a few.<eos> How would you reverse the extinction of today's endangered species?<eos> Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I covered for you in school, but...<eos> My brother is on borrowed time, Hanna.<eos> I can't be sitting in Spanish conjugating verbs.<eos> I really need to talk to Cyrus.<eos> You think we're going to find "A" through Cyrus?<eos> You're lucky if you can even find Cyrus.<eos> I already did.
Your associates used that technique down here to destroy the rock.<eos> Hopefully we'll have the same success up there.<eos> A pulse of that magnitude would take out our entire security grid.<eos> I'm aware of the risks.<eos> We're out of options.<eos> Maybe not, sir.<eos> Look, let me work on something.<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> How long do we wait?<eos> We don't.
[sighs] This is Dr. Ellison.<eos> (man) Dr. Ellison, I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> I'm sure you're busy.<eos> That's all right. Who am I speaking with?<eos> I run a chain of clinics in the area.<eos> I was wondering if you might find the time to meet with me.<eos> I have an urgent matter to discuss.<eos> Okay, what is it? It'd be better to talk about that in person.<eos> Well, you know, I'm in the middle of a shift, um... and you didn't mention your name.<eos> No, I didn't.
We need to do the same thing for the boys.<eos> Where are the boys, anyway?<eos> Amazing.<eos> They found a way to make Tampa worse.<eos> [Whispers] What is the teacher saying?<eos> [Whispers] I don't know.<eos> [Whispers] Oh! That sounded like the word for "the."<eos> This is madness.<eos> You know what'll impress mom and get us up on the fridge?<eos> - No, obviously I don't!
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You don't just stop loving someone.<eos> How do you feel about Nicole and Dave getting married?<eos> I didn't know about the engagement until you told me.<eos> I'm happy for her if that's what she wants.<eos> So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
If I may be so bold, Sire, I'd send Feuquiére, an experienced diplomat who thinks only of France.<eos> Too methodical.<eos> Chanut, maybe?<eos> His visit to Sweden was very successful.<eos> A loose cannon.<eos> Croissy, perhaps?<eos> A committed Anglophile, even rumored to like the food!<eos> Henriette will go.<eos> Your pardon, Sire, did you say ...?<eos> Indeed I did.
You should've gone to support Caroline, at least.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did go, in fact.<eos> I said to Celia, "I'm going whether you do or not."<eos> And then when I got there she told me there was no point me being there if her mother wasn't.<eos> So.<eos> ~ She said that?<eos> ~ Did she?<eos> ~ Caroline did?
It's all been about him and her.<eos> You're a nice fella.<eos> But I really don't want you and Robbie at the same dinner party.<eos> ~ Well, tell him not to come, then.<eos> ~ I can't do that.<eos> Because... yesterday morning, before you turned up... .. he asked me to marry him.<eos> And then, God knows how many hours later, I'm in bed with you.<eos> Because I'm stupid and flaky and I'm fed up of being those things!<eos> ~ You don't want to marry him.<eos> ~ Don't I?

I don't know about all that, but...<eos> What's this I hear that you're the baddest songwriter that's ever lived on this planet?<eos> This guy, right?<eos> Give us a minute, y'all, please.<eos> ♪I don't need it you can keep ya money♪<eos> ♪I don't want it if ya gonna throw it up in my face♪<eos> I wouldn't believe everything that I read.<eos> I saw that you were a devoted husband and father.<eos> Did you hear about that injunction that Beretti slapped me with?<eos> I did.
But I keep getting stuck, you know?<eos> I get it.<eos> It's that writer's block.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> Do you remember me talking to you about one of you taking over after me?<eos> I remember something like that.<eos> I don't... It might've slipped my mind.<eos> I read a magazine article and it called you "The future of empire."<eos> You believe that?<eos> 'Cause I do.
I know those categories.<eos> You guys are talking dates.<eos> Here's what you do:<eos> Invite him over, order some fancy take out, throw it in a pot, and act like you cooked it.<eos> I got the idea from yahoo!<eos> Answers.<eos> Dude, I'm not gonna buy a pot.<eos> We're not married.<eos> Mm-kay, you know what time it is?<eos> Because my hoodie does.
I hadn't talked to the guy in a year or two.<eos> What did you two talk about?<eos> Caught up a bit, did some reminiscing about Africa.<eos> But I got to be honest.<eos> The guy sitting across the table from me last night is not the Julius I knew.<eos> It was strange. He was distracted, paranoid. He kept looking around.<eos> Tried to talk to him about it, ask what was going on but he just changed the subject.<eos> I got to say, when I left, I was a little worried about the guy.<eos> He talk about seeing anyone else here?<eos> No, he didn't.
- What? I-I can't.<eos> - You're doing it now. Jesús, take the wheel.<eos> He's terrified to be in the back.<eos> Now you're gonna put him in the front seat so that he can kill all of us?<eos> ! Can you not make this fear worse?<eos> I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.<eos> Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time...<eos> Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.<eos> Manny, you don't want to do this right?<eos> No, I really don't.
Okay, please, Manny.<eos> I might have exaggerated a little bit, but I do that all the time.<eos> Columbia actually is a very normal place.<eos> My accomplishments are all lies.<eos> I can only deal with one traumatized child at a time.<eos> Please, Jay, let that poor baby off the toilet.<eos> Okay, new plan... we leave him on the throne till he conks out, then we dunk his hand in a bowl of warm water...<eos> That's crazy.<eos> You know that you can't rush these things.<eos> You did it before with Claire and with Mitch.
- Somewhere safe.<eos> - There is no "safe"...<eos> - until I see us through this.<eos> - There is no "I" here, Molly.<eos> We are in this together.<eos> I know.<eos> Right.<eos> You're not the only one that's been given a second chance.<eos> Look, I... I don't believe in that "destiny" crap,<eos> I-I just don't.
No.<eos> That's how you see you.<eos> But that's not how I see you.<eos> How do you see me?<eos> I see... a kind, loving father.<eos> A gentleman.<eos> Wow.<eos> I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
Do you remember Paris?<eos> I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées.<eos> - It was raining, but...<eos> - There was a nice old lady.<eos> - And she gave me her umbrella.<eos> - It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
And walked away from the fight.<eos> It didn't seem like my fight anymore.<eos> Something you learn when you're the one giving the orders:<eos> sometimes there are no good decisions.<eos> It's just a lesser of two evils.<eos> And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.<eos> She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.
Okay?<eos> I'm gonna ask you to do something.<eos> Something that might balance those scales.<eos> What the hell kind of stunt was that?<eos> I'm trying to remind you that there are people here that love you and need you!<eos> So you enlist my ex-wife to manipulate me?<eos> Don't play that game, Molly.<eos> I'm not playing games.<eos> Now, you believe in that vision just as much as I do.<eos> What if I do?
You're pulling my leg.<eos> No one can see you.<eos> Take a knee.<eos> Or did you change your mind about the transfer?<eos> Now... ask Jesus for forgiveness.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Forgive me, Jesus.<eos> And what is the nature of your sin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sylvie mentioned you guys needed a coffee table,<eos> I thought this would be perfect.<eos> It's great.<eos> Right?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Ah, yes, please.<eos> Hermann wore me out.<eos> Oh, he will do that to you.<eos> I don't think I have any, actually.<eos> - Oh, yes you do. - Oh.
Bit of a blow losing your star player.<eos> I'm sure our new captain will make up the deficit.<eos> May the best side win.<eos> I'm surprised you're all being so casual about your tenth defeat in a row.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Know what?<eos> I suggest you take a look at the original articles of 1783.<eos> Should either side be victor for ten successive years, they claim ownership of the land in perpetuity.<eos> ~ Did you know about this?<eos> ~ No, I didn't.
Stop.<eos> Maybe we should just kiss, and everything will suddenly be better.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - What? I think I should get you home.<eos> Maybe we're what we both need.<eos> And we just didn't know it.<eos> We should be pirates, not farmers or watchers or judges.<eos> Connie.<eos> You don't even know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
You're so predictable.<eos> Pulling some sort of moral argument just to try and get out of doing what's right.<eos> What's right, what's right, what's right. What...<eos> What is right?<eos> How the hell would we know what's right anymore?<eos> We got our heads so far up our asses that, Rosie,<eos> Rosie, I don't recognize you.<eos> Hell, I don't recognize myself.<eos> But you, what, you think you're the only mother in the world?<eos> I do not.
I'm busy. I have a lot of work.<eos> What did I do?<eos> I'm sorry about the party.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I don't want to talk about the party. You're my best friend.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I'm your best friend? That's interesting, because best friends don't sell each other out.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.
Let it go.<eos> I don't want to talk about the party. You're my best friend.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I'm your best friend? That's interesting, because best friends don't sell each other out.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.<eos> Yes, and I don't want to be brought into this.<eos> You sold me out. You never should have said that.<eos> But you do.
Marco, we've been over this.<eos> If your Uncle Joe finds out, he will kill you.<eos> And if we tell my aunt Mel, she'll tell Joe, and he will kill you.<eos> Nah. He won't.<eos> He was telling me this morning how glad he is to have me around.<eos> Because he thinks you stayed in town to help out, buy groceries.<eos> He thinks all you're doing is errands, not, you know, me.<eos> And have I been helpful with the groceries?<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
Mr. Stone worked for the military, Ms. Lane.<eos> This is purely routine.<eos> That a fact?<eos> I want to look around.<eos> I don't suppose I could dissuade you.<eos> This is a crime scene.<eos> I won't touch a thing.<eos> Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve.<eos> He's not my boyfriend.<eos> And yes, he does.
Something in the tower.<eos> I could show you if you'd like.<eos> You never let the press inside the tower.<eos> I'm reconsidering, unless you'd rather not be the first.<eos> Like hell! Let's go.<eos> I'll give you a lift.<eos> Thanks, but I'll drive.<eos> The generators are Kryptonian-designed.<eos> They not only power the building, but provide a shield that makes it virtually impenetrable.<eos> My God, even the rumors about this place don't do it justice!
You got my money, mane?<eos> We brought the cash.<eos> Did you bring the Del?<eos> Help me!<eos> Relax, Del.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I'm here, buddy.<eos> Thanks, Jack, you're my best friend.<eos> You want some more of that? - No.<eos> - He does.
You're really up on your Bible, Agent Aubrey.<eos> Minored in religion in college.<eos> So you add her sexual orientation to the, uh, sorcery, I'm thinking we've got us a lethal combination.<eos> Justine came out to me when she was 16 years old.<eos> I supported her then as I do now.<eos> These passages you quote, Agent Aubrey, they pale next to the real message that Jesus brought to us-- understanding, compassion and love.<eos> I am not God, Agent Aubrey.<eos> It's not for me to judge.<eos> I hope you're telling the truth, Pastor.<eos> I really do.
You can take a yo-yo and turn it into a time bomb.<eos> If we're gonna win, we need to think outside the box.<eos> Or outside of the body.<eos> It begins!<eos> Avengers! Stop M.O.D.O.K.'s transfer.<eos> We can't let him get control of the Mind Stone!<eos> I still have more than enough power left to keep your pathetic team at bay!<eos> Hawkeye!<eos> My armor needs those things!<eos> Not as much as I do!
Well, I'm sorry,<eos> But I've got other shit to do today. Now, what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> My sister edie is getting married To don ekblad, jr. Of all people,<eos> Um... I should be maid of honor, dicknuts, But no, guess who she asks instead?<eos> Uh... Midge olerud!<eos> No!<eos> Yes. Midge "hey edie, "let's me and you blow pam's boyfriend arn<eos> Behind the goddamn grain elevator" olerud! You had a boyfriend named arn?<eos> Well, he didn't know I liked him, but--<eos> Midge and edie did.
So I was wondering if you could do me a favor.<eos> Yep, yep, yep, but, first, Who is this little person?<eos> Um, a.J., my baby,<eos> Who I've had for, like, six months,<eos> Who you've met.<eos> Mm-kay.<eos> Ooh, and who also has a poopy diaper.<eos> [gasps] great bacchus plateau, It works!<eos> What?<eos> What does?
- No, she couldn't get pregnant!<eos> We tried! For years! We saw doctors.<eos> Sad. And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.<eos> We didn't know it? We... we just didn't know she was pregnant?<eos> It happens.<eos> This was the whole reason for the hunting trips and the jet skis, trips to Bali and stuff.<eos> I said to her, "babe, if it's just gonna be us, let's make us an adventure."<eos> But she really wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
Change of plan.<eos> We're not going to the hospital.<eos> But what about the children?<eos> So I have come all this way...<eos> I've just come from the Standing Stones.<eos> Sylvia Swann was killed there last night.<eos> What?<eos> At the Stones?<eos> - You don't think...<eos> - No, I don't.
And where did the body come from?<eos> All right, this bolt is operated by the key - it holds the latch in place, prevents the door from opening.<eos> We need to lift it up.<eos> Now we need something to keep it from falling.<eos> That's the job.<eos> Now we slide.<eos> What?<eos> And the other two.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> The same way the killer did.
And you didn't notice the chafing to the wrists?<eos> I noticed contact dermatitis, most likely caused by over starched shirt cuffs, cheap carbolic.<eos> I hope you're not implying I'm past it, laddie?<eos> Jock Hamilton's a decent man.<eos> He's a drunk, past his prime, should've been retired years ago.<eos> I began house-to-house enquiries, starting with Wenlock Dip, home of Sir Jeffrey Greensleeves.<eos> Our Justice of the Peace.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Not as well as Sid does.
I'm gonna quit smoking once and for all.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's over.<eos> We must be the change we wish to see in this world.<eos> Gandhi said that.<eos> First of all, John Mayer said that.<eos> Gandhi said, "The British are coming," and that's how he got independence for India.<eos> Okay, I don't doubt you think that's true.<eos> Speaking of extraordinary Indian people, Mindy, I believe if you put your mind to it, you can have a fit pregnancy.<eos> - Oh, do you?
Hi.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you guys need something?<eos> Uh...<eos> Yes.<eos> You had mentioned that you needed help with the encrypted files on your laptop.<eos> I did?<eos> You did.<eos> I did.
In fact, I keep non-disclosure agreements in my top drawer.<eos> Aah! Okay, okay, breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> What's that brown stuff?<eos> Did you track in mud?<eos> No, it's doodle.<eos> Gross, you took a dump on my floor?<eos> No, Brooke, it's your doodle.<eos> It's okay, it's totally normal. It happens to everyone.<eos> Not to me, it doesn't.
Wait, wait.<eos> Here we go, here we go.<eos> Whose car is it?<eos> I was right.<eos> It was my mom.<eos> That bitch!<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Uh, it turns out the dress doesn't fit.<eos> None of this does.
Can I help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't think so. Two guys in one week.<eos> You're on a roll.<eos> I did none of this. You keep saying that.<eos> He broke his collar bone and shattered his arm.<eos> His athletic career is shot.<eos> Scholarships gone.<eos> Did you see Jenny push him?<eos> No one did.
Oh, honey.<eos> Nobody separated us.<eos> I was too young.<eos> I wasn't ready to become a mother.<eos> It was the hardest thing I ever had to do, but I just-I just wanted what was best for you.<eos> So you replaced me?<eos> It doesn't work that way. You can't replace a child, and I looked for you for years, but the foster records, they were incomplete.<eos> They were never, ever able to tell me where you were.<eos> You looked for me?<eos> Of course I did.
I'm eating.<eos> I know you're awake.<eos> Get up.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> To see her.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Nothing, but I have a plan to get Michelle back.<eos> We have to make her vulnerable.<eos> We have to take away her family.<eos> You already did that.
I don't know, just people.<eos> Did you even search his stuff?<eos> I'm sorry, search for what?<eos> Hello, for pot, money, whatever drug dealers would be carrying.<eos> God! Look at you, Nancy Drew.<eos> We did, and we found both those things.<eos> $1500 and an eighth of marijuana which coincidently was the exact amount that you bought from my friend Phillip last week.<eos> Imagine that?<eos> Phillip is a drugged-out liar.<eos> Well, I don't about that.
Let me know if something happens.<eos> - So she didn't say anything?<eos> - No.<eos> She appeared shocked.<eos> Yes, poor girl.<eos> Only god knows what she's been through.<eos> You haven't been able to identify her yet?<eos> No, she doesn't match any of the other cases.<eos> I think I know who she is.<eos> You do?
You got all these people out there who care so much for you and you have no idea how much they love you.<eos> I know they love me.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you're doing a pretty poor job of letting them know you're aware of that fact.<eos> I don't think you're treating them right.<eos> Now, they can't heal you, but they would heal you if they could.<eos> And if they could trade places with you, many of them would do that.<eos> Yeah...<eos> And do anything for you without any waver.
Brody, you're with me.<eos> Let's go, uh, pay a visit to Senator Klain.<eos> How'd it go with Agent Anson?<eos> I answered his questions.<eos> All he seems to care about is the Moultrie and why I hesitated.<eos> It's personal. I know.<eos> And... since they determined that it had nothing to do with the deaths and since nothing like that has ever happened again, then there's really... there's no reason<eos> I get it. for us to go get this...<eos> I get it.<eos> I do. I...
Redmayne?<eos> He is.<eos> A bit provocative?<eos> I guess.<eos> My campaign manager is angry.<eos> Why's that?<eos> He thinks Redmayne was in my column and then he wasn't.<eos> After he spoke to you.<eos> - That happens.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Yeah, little bit.<eos> Darrin, there's something I've been trying to say to you for the past few days, and I have been doing a terrible job of it.<eos> That's okay, Sue.<eos> I-I totally get it.<eos> I've been trying to say something to this guy, Dan, at work.<eos> He always whistles when we're on jobs together, and when people's air conditioners are broke, the last thing they want to hear is some guy whistling.<eos> That's true.<eos> That totally makes sense.<eos> Darrin, I don't want to marry you.<eos> You don't?
Don't be scared.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I want to protect you from Liam.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you can find me, so can he.<eos> You can't keep running.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
If he thinks that you're on his side.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Look, Catherine, he doesn't know us, okay?<eos> He doesn't know how far we've come, okay?<eos> Otherwise, he would never think he had a chance.<eos> So this gives us the advantage, okay?<eos> Liam thinks that he is playing me, but in reality, I will be playing him.<eos> Look, just trust me, okay?<eos> Trust us.<eos> I do.
It's unrealistic to think about children.<eos> Not now.<eos> It's unrealistic.<eos> - Clark?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
- Sorry I never called you.<eos> - What? You know, five years ago, Kelli's slumber party.<eos> God, did we destroy that sleeping bag.<eos> Dude, it was just a stupid drunk thing, I wasn't expecting a call.<eos> Look, my wife knows, just an FYI, but no reason to bring it up, you feel me?<eos> Hard to bring up something I barely remember.<eos> I found a parking spot, but it was up on the hill.<eos> I'm good, babe.<eos> Jan, you know my sister-in-law Claire, right?<eos> No, I don't.
- No buts.<eos> You shouldn't be worried about what Theo and Cole wrote about you in some silly yearbook, anyway.<eos> Your friends' opinions are the only ones that should matter.<eos> That's actually a really good point, Lissa.<eos> - You're welcome. - [knock at door]<eos> Now get out. My 2:30's here.<eos> Okay, pay attention, Darlene.<eos> Here is my cheerleading uniform, a comprehensive tutorial on how I like to wear my hair, my favorite lip gloss, shoes, and... oops!<eos> I accidentally put in two types of eyeliner, but since you're my mom, I'm sure you'll know which one I prefer to use.<eos> Of course I do, honey.
But you're also a nice hookup and a great writer.<eos> You're not the best camp counselor, though.<eos> You're kind of bad at making arts and crafts.<eos> Please, like you're so great at it.<eos> Gosh, it feels so good to get out of that side braid.<eos> The pulling, how did you do that every day for two years?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> See you later, best friend.<eos> (Jenna) You want to know the best part about knowing who I was?<eos> That Matty did too.
I don't want your hospitality.<eos> Hey, what are you mad at me for?<eos> I could've had your job.<eos> I turned it down.<eos> Yeah, well, that doesn't give it back to me.<eos> Well, you should've made her cut the Microloans program.<eos> Dude, I begged her.<eos> Burke was just looking for a reason to humiliate your boss.<eos> She handed it to him.<eos> Former boss And, yes, she did.
Look at her like you've never known a woman like her before and never will again.<eos> Tell her... from the moment you saw her your definition of "stunning" changed.<eos> You know, from the moment I saw you... my definition of "stunning" changed.<eos> Perfect.<eos> What's taking so long? Open it.<eos> I can't.<eos> She booby-trapped it.<eos> We open this, an alarm will notify her.<eos> We have no other way in.<eos> Actually, we do.
Are you ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's over.<eos> Is Joe dead?<eos> No, and I don't know what's gonna happen with his execution, but I need to stick around to see.<eos> What? !<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I need to get closure on this, Gwen.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Good because I don't.
That's about to change. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, um, i know you just ran past me, probably thought, "hey, there's Billy and his sister Billie."<eos> Stepsister.<eos> And -- stepsister, of course.<eos> We are not related at all. Stepsister.<eos> Not related at all.<eos> And you might have been wondering,<eos> "did I just see them kissing?<eos> Is that what was happening?"<eos> No, I didn't.
You back their efforts because they want Mary, their Catholic queen, gone, a queen even English Catholics believe has the right to your throne.<eos> What next?<eos> Do we attack half our population to put you at ease?<eos> The realm will strike down anyone who acts against its sovereign ruler.<eos> Is it not our sworn duty?<eos> Bad day on the job, my dear?<eos> Half of England wants me gone.<eos> Only the Catholic half.<eos> Well, the rest don't want Mary, but they certainly wish I were a man.<eos> Of course they do, especially your privy council.
There you go.<eos> - King of getting tackled at the one-yard line, my ass. - Right?<eos> - Check your fantasy league.<eos> I'm sorry, but I had no clue that I had the Spencer Strasmore on the phone.<eos> - If I don't get an autograph for my nephew... - Thank you. I'll never hear the end of it.<eos> It'll be a pleasure.<eos> No problem. But first, we should take care of a little business.<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> So you said you had more pictures.<eos> - My client does.
The only way I learned my ABC's was by learning the names of all the guys my mom slept with.<eos> ♪ Art, Bob, Chet, Don, Ed, Frank, Gus ♪<eos> ♪ Hal, Irv, John, Ken, Lew-Matt-Ned-Ox-Pat ♪<eos> ♪ Quint, Ron, Sam, Tom, Ulf, Vic ♪<eos> ♪ Walter, Xavier, Yaz and Zeke ♪<eos> ♪ Those are just some of the guys ♪<eos> ♪ There are lots of other guys. ♪<eos> It was awful.<eos> I didn't even get to go to my high school prom.<eos> But my mom did.
These are all lovely words, Antoine, but they don't change the fact that you have a wife, and I a husband.<eos> You have a husband who no longer trusts you.<eos> I think if you ask him for an annulment, he will grant you one.<eos> I have a dying wife who wants me to find a mother for our children.<eos> Are you sure you want a mother for your children who has no shame?<eos> Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood - is something that doesn't interest you...<eos> - No. It does, actually.
John, we haven't seen you since pastry school.<eos> Hey, for old times' sake, want to buy a cupcake? A dozen?<eos> The shop?<eos> So I came because I may know of a way for Max to make some extra money.<eos> Whatever it is, she'll do it.<eos> That was my yearbook quote.<eos> I just got hired at a new restaurant that's opening under the High Line Park in Manhattan, and they are looking for another day pastry chef.<eos> I only have a year of pastry school and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.<eos> I don't know if I have the skills.<eos> [chuckles] Oh, girl, you don't.
They're made out of the same material they use for traffic cones and boat fenders, so that thing is indestructible.<eos> ~ Which is a pity.<eos> ~ It's brilliant! I love it!<eos> Look at that!<eos> Yes, but what are you going to do with it?<eos> Well, drive it about.<eos> You can drive it on the road.<eos> ~ That goes on the road.<eos> ~ Yeah, but you can drive a tractor on the road<eos> ~ or one of those massive cranes that do 8mph.
Should I call 'em?<eos> I'm really excited for you guys to taste this.<eos> I saw the takeout containers in the trash, Gordon.<eos> Just testing.<eos> You like Sal's cacciatore, right?<eos> Hey, at least your obsession with "Tank Battle" paid off.<eos> My coder monkeys said you came by, that your time-stamp fix was genius.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I took a little break from work, so...<eos> Oh, sure, you did, sexy beard.
Why not murder?<eos> The evidence was circumstantial.<eos> There was no witness to the murder, otherwise, he'd be serving a life sentence.<eos> Edwards is punishing people who deserve it and making sure no innocent people get hurt in the process.<eos> We should hire him, Finch.<eos> Take the week off.<eos> Need I remind you, Mr. Reese, his number has come up.<eos> Which means that his next target may escalate beyond any simple crime.<eos> Or one of his previous targets is coming back for revenge.<eos> - How you doing, boy?
Yes.<eos> But the hacker has new information about you. Current documents, photos.<eos> Even has recordings of your phone conversations.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> The FBI runs vulnerability testing quarterly.<eos> Last month, they scanned all my devices. They're clean.<eos> I know.<eos> Which is why I didn't come to you right away.<eos> I wanted to confirm it.<eos> And I did.
Ask her where you are.<eos> M.I.R.A., where are we?<eos> You are aboard the vessel tensing norgay in the northern lowlands of Mars.<eos> She actually thinks she's on Mars.<eos> Regardless, I'm gonna need to ask all of you to join me at the precinct so I can interview you properly.<eos> That... could be a problem.<eos> I'm sorry, detective.<eos> I can't let you remove the astronauts.<eos> I don't have that kind of authority.<eos> - Well, then, who does?
Leave me a message. And I'll call you back, probably.<eos> When did you realize she was gone?<eos> Half an hour ago.<eos> I went to check if she was sleeping.<eos> She'd torn up Lena's room, and she was gone.<eos> Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
'Cause you weren't here.<eos> Where the hell was I?<eos> With her.<eos> What?<eos> Claire.<eos> What are you doing all the way out here?<eos> Did you hear our news?<eos> Did Peter tell you?<eos> Matthew and I are having a baby.<eos> No, he didn't.
She's got an order of protection against him. Yeah, all right.<eos> You and I both know that thing's not worth the paper it's written on.<eos> I bet Amber knew that too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tried calling Danny and Amber as well.<eos> Both phones went straight to voice mail.<eos> Danny told me that he was going off the grid. He wants to spend time with Amber. They turned their phones off.<eos> That explains why I can't ping their location.<eos> - He say where he was taking her?<eos> - No. No, he didn't.
You seem like a nice man.<eos> Why would you lie to all those people?<eos> Promising them an afterlife you can't possibly know exists?<eos> And you can't know it doesn't.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Want to bet?<eos> Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.<eos> Whatever that means.<eos> So, you really believe that people rise from the dead?<eos> Yes, I do.
One good thing is that I've let go of any dream of getting in great shape, like, it's like a relief.<eos> Just 'cause- My whole life I've been like, well, someday, I should really get in great shape.<eos> Now, I'm like, what? Why would I do that?<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Just-<eos> To me, the bar, the level I wanna reach as far as the shape I'm in, I just want it to be so that if you find out that I died, you ask "What happened?"<eos> That's all.<eos> I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.
Nobody!<eos> Your parents are dead, you're 52!<eos> Nobody came from work. Nobody came from work.<eos> I take her every-every Thursday to tap dancing and we go up to the school and she puts on her tap shoes and she goes in the little room.<eos> I don't go in there, and she tap dances and I wait outside, because it's 40 minutes, it's not enough time to go anywhere.<eos> So I just sit there and listen to...<eos> And then she comes out.<eos> "I don't-I'm tired of this.<eos> I don't want to go anymore."<eos> Good, don't.
And the bastard was intent on leaving Victoria everything.<eos> I starved him until he had no choice but to pick up the damn pen and sign the new will.<eos> So why come after me?<eos> Aww, honey.<eos> Conrad always wanted me to live like a Grayson, and that's not just about the money.<eos> It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Ooh! That is my mouse.<eos> I'm just trying to help you.<eos> Let me tell you something... I like the way I look.<eos> I want other people to like the way you look, like men.<eos> Plenty of men like the way I look.<eos> I don't mean to brag, but I really bring it with construction workers.<eos> I mean a man that you can marry and have kids with and have this for yourself.<eos> I don't want this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't.
- I went to see him last night.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Get the guards to turn off the camera?<eos> The look on his face, Harvey...<eos> I don't know, I can't describe it.<eos> Oh, you got to be kidding me.<eos> God...<eos> Guy gets stabbed; I thought we'd have at least a week of peace.<eos> Hey, Cap!<eos> How you doing?
You knew, from the start, that this was a trap.<eos> But you thought, "Hey,<eos> "let the bad guys take their best shot.<eos> "I'm Jim Gordon.<eos> "I'll find a way to win."<eos> "Or die."<eos> It's option B, baby.<eos> Your fondest wish come true.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Hey. Sure you do.
Ooh, that's actually amazing.<eos> - Charles, write that down.<eos> - Already did.<eos> Sarge, what's the big deal? We stopped two kilos of heroin from hitting the streets.<eos> Who cares about one broken window?<eos> I do!<eos> I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.<eos> But...<eos> Terry loves paperwork?<eos> - No, Jake, I do not.
It's not our fault aunt Edie's house has narrow hallways.<eos> Thank you for letting me witness that.<eos> A writer can't stay inside when real life is so chock-full of drama.<eos> Like Axl thought that table could just slide right past that sconce, but then it didn't.<eos> What a great twist.<eos> And then mom expanded my vocabulary with her colorful collection of curse words.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> My God. Even with the windows down, I can still smell it.<eos> Sue, I thought you didn't bring your "poo-pourri."<eos> I didn't.
Mean, ugly giants.<eos> He saw His mistake and turned them into dust.<eos> He left just a few, then made Adam and Eve.<eos> The Giant Jews multiplied, but grew ever smaller.<eos> - They's our Jews nowadays.<eos> - We didn't know that.<eos> That's why Jews can't stand us Christians, that's why they killed Christ.<eos> And that's why I can't stand them.<eos> - Do you know what I do with pork-haters?<eos> - We don't.
We have no such boyar around here.<eos> He's playing the idiot, isn't he, Ionita?<eos> He is.<eos> - Me, playing the idiot?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Me, having a Gypsy here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit...<eos> - I don't have any!<eos> - Yes, you do.
I'm captain raymond holt.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Marriage is a contract... But it's so much more than that.<eos> Marriage is love.<eos> It's commitment, It's joy, it's understanding, It's patience, it's anger,<eos> It's like oatmeal.<eos> It...<eos> Sustains you.<eos> Darlene, do you take lynn to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.

I mean, it's not like you're going to die anytime soon.<eos> After all the fun we've had together, this is how you repay me?<eos> It's over. You heard her.<eos> She never wants to see me again.<eos> Can I assume that "her" is mom and that he actually wants her back?<eos> Yeah, I don't really understand it either.<eos> If you're serious, you just gotta go talk to her. I can't.<eos> I'm done putting myself out there.<eos> I'm done taking chances. What are you talking about?<eos> Done?
Oh, I am too high for this.<eos> In my culture, big nipples mean power and wealth.<eos> In our culture, big nipples means, "Wears a t-shirt in the pool."<eos> There.<eos> I like it.<eos> Adds a certain something to the room.<eos> Every wall needs nipples.<eos> So a guy knows where to look.<eos> Thank you for telling me to do this, Caroline.<eos> She did?
So you know what she is?<eos> She's a predator. Designed by evolution to conquer, kill and devour.<eos> She moves like a hunter.<eos> Yeah, well, she eats like a cannibal.<eos> What kind of Votan is she?<eos> There was an early Votan race, one that predated the rest of us. One that called the shots for a very long time.<eos> Congratulations. You found yourselves an honest-to-goodness Omec.<eos> Omec?<eos> I've heard the name, but I heard they died out.<eos> Supposedly they did.
And healed the wound itself.<eos> I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield.<eos> It couldn't have been more than a few microns thick, but it kept you alive.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> You knew?<eos> I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
No, I don't.<eos> Where's my crew?<eos> They're gone.<eos> What do you mean they're gone?<eos> I mean they left.<eos> They got in their shuttle, flew back to their ship, and they jumped.<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't just leave me.<eos> [ROOK] They didn't have a choice.<eos> For the moment, at least, neither do you.
Assuming it already hasn't been destroyed.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> With the implant you could do a full reboot to make her more manageable.<eos> Control the Android and you control the ship.<eos> So why didn't whoever it was do it already?<eos> Why wait?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they weren't thinking straight, or Five scared them off, or maybe they have some other agenda.<eos> But how is this possible?<eos> We did a full top to bottom sweep.
If you pick truth, you have to tell the truth. If you pick dare... it's gonna be really suspicious, and I'm gonna think you had something to do with my sweet bro Boone dying and my rad bro Caulfield getting his arms... and then his head chopped off!<eos> And Dodger.<eos> Will you stop whining about Dodger? !<eos> Everybody agrees that dude was holding you back. Nobody misses him.<eos> Now let's play some Truth or Dare and find out who the killer is.<eos> Number Five, truth or dare?<eos> Truth.<eos> Number Five, does your vagina have teeth?<eos> That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.
I promise to never betray your trust again.<eos> You most certainly won't betray my trust ever again, because you will never have my trust ever again!<eos> Look, we think you need to contact Number Two, and just give her a chance to do right by you.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> ! How? !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Those things don't work! Yes, they do.<eos> Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No! No one did!
- Wait, we're gonna what?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Like, after Roger and Dodger, like,<eos> - I've suffered so much loss in my life.<eos> - Oh, Jesus. Let's go.<eos> Why do you think the Devil let me live?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I still think we should call the police. What will that do?<eos> I mean, all Denise is gonna do is arrest Zayday again.<eos> You guys didn't, um...
I don't think SECNAV would appreciate NCIS treating an admiral like a criminal.<eos> Oh, we already talked to SECNAV. Mm-hmm.<eos> How did she phrase it?<eos> Uh, "nail the son of a bitch."<eos> For what?<eos> Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
How do you protect yourself?<eos> We all get tested.<eos> Every two weeks.<eos> Are you on birth control? I'm not on birth control.<eos> But we get tested for chlamydia...<eos> How are you keeping from getting pregnant then?<eos> Well, all shoots, they don't come inside you.<eos> Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...<eos> They always do it on you, instead of in you.
He has, like, over 700 girls only on that one website, and he'll post a new video every Friday.<eos> Like, this guy made money, like...<eos> -He was making $10,000 a day. -Yeah.<eos> Was yours a cream pie?<eos> - No, mine wasn't a cream pie.<eos> - Mine was.<eos> It was just a "he came on my stomach" type thing.<eos> Today I did two cream pies, but all I did was just...<eos> I thought they gave you extra for that. Didn't they? -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they did. Yeah.
Hello, promising candidate. Karen Holden, third-grade teacher at the time.<eos> She went to the E.R. multiple times, courtesy of her icky, icky abusive husband Frank Holden.<eos> Where's Frank and Karen now? Dead.<eos> Like in a tragic story of Shakespearean proportions kind of way.<eos> They died in a murder-suicide 25 years ago.<eos> What happened?<eos> Uh, Frank had a drinking problem.<eos> He got punchy with Karen, like literally, an argument ensued and ended up with Karen having her throat slashed and Frank with a bullet in his head.<eos> I am guessing they had a child?<eos> They did, indeed.
[gasps] Can you say "magically delicious"?<eos> I really want Nashit to work out.<eos> I like it when good-looking people succeed.<eos> Well, I guess that's good news for me.<eos> Is it?<eos> Hi, honey. (Joe) Have you met the new waiter?<eos> I love him. He's my favorite.<eos> If I did men, he would've been done by now.<eos> Hmm, so you think you're pretty.<eos> Well, I do too.
Or was it about him seducing the nanny? Or was it all part of the same betrayal, eating you up inside?<eos> Do you think it was easy being the king's mistress?<eos> A position easily gained. But held? For decades?<eos> Say it was an accident, mother, please.<eos> Say that you only left those nursery windows open<eos> To get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.<eos> I wanted catherine to suffer. I wanted henry to suffer.<eos> They did.
I had this headache, earlier.<eos> You know who doesn't feel better?<eos> Dead Emma Baker.<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I would never hurt Emma.<eos> She was super generous.<eos> And she'd be super pissed if, after giving you a huge donation, she found out that you were full of it.<eos> Yeah, maybe you killed her to keep your cover from being blown.<eos> - I didn't.
I waited for you for over an hour last night.<eos> - You never showed up.<eos> - I went to the park at 9:00.<eos> I didn't see you. I saw your welcoming committee.<eos> - 10:00.<eos> - 9:00. You changed it to 10:00.<eos> - I never sent that.<eos> - Well, it's from your phone.<eos> - I never sent that.<eos> - Well, someone did.

So, that bag is clothes. That bag is diapers.<eos> The cooler is breast milk,<eos> - which obviously needs to go in the...<eos> - Where do you buy breast milk?<eos> You don't, Archer. You...
- So no beer?<eos> - Why would I bring beer?<eos> Because you don't want me drinking liquor?<eos> I don't want you drinking anything!<eos> - What, that's all for her?<eos> - I'll find a sitter.<eos> Lana, relax.<eos> I won't drink while you're gone.<eos> - I take this very seriously.<eos> - Well, or at least Woodhouse does.
I am going to save your life.<eos> And I am about to get up in front of a bunch of people and tell them how I plan on doing it.<eos> It makes it really hard for me to do that or even care about doing that when you don't seem to care at all!<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> Well, the word's spreading.<eos> This was a good idea, Hunt... a master class in neurosurgery.<eos> This is gonna put Amelia Shepherd on the map. Mm.<eos> Unless it fails.<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does...
I can't use temple funds for anything other than God's work.<eos> You're the high priest!<eos> The arrests I can curtail.<eos> As for these extra funds, they can't come from the temple.<eos> But they could come from a private source.<eos> I'll send Cornelius to collect.<eos> We're to lavish money on Tiberius, the man who expelled thousands of our people from their homes in Rome on a whim?<eos> How far will you go to keep Rome happy?<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We don't, no.
I only just started work here in the palace, but I know Joanna from...<eos> From the market.<eos> We used to see each other at the market.<eos> Didn't we agree you need to tell me about any new friends?<eos> My wife has come under some bad influences recently.<eos> I don't want it to happen again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll keep her from harm.<eos> Your husband doesn't know about your faith?<eos> He does.
We can only plan for its arrival.<eos> I know.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> But that's all we can do.<eos> We must reinforce the Garrison.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> But that's all we can do.<eos> We must reinforce the Garrison.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.<eos> Of course I do.
It's a side effect of me becoming Adalind and sleeping with Nick.<eos> What side effects?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Juliette, talk to us.<eos> I'm... I'm losing myself.<eos> I need help.<eos> Juliette.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> You told them?<eos> No, I didn't.
No, because they thought you died back in '94.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> Creatively, Johnny, you kind of did.<eos> The fact the band broke up the day the album came out made you Belgian cult heroes...<eos> Very devoted fans.<eos> So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later...<eos> Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
I got it.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Well, that's great news!<eos> No?<eos> Come on, Sian.<eos> Come and sit down and talk to me.<eos> Have you heard from Violet?<eos> No.<eos> It don't matter.<eos> Course it does.
- I'm not dating my T.A. - Why not?<eos> Because I'm married to your mother.<eos> You and mom are separated, though.<eos> - As of this morning.<eos> - So, you're saying if you had more time, you'd be dating her.<eos> No, I'm not saying that.<eos> So you want to stay with mom? Yes.<eos> Does mom want to stay with you?<eos> I hope so, Grant.<eos> I really do.
No deal.<eos> This isn't about the money, Martinson.<eos> This is about giving a group of young people in Waterville, Maine, a summer filled with laughter and fun, without dying from radioactive poison in the ground.<eos> Or maybe you've forgotten what it's like to be young, Bill?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I enjoyed the speech, Jim... and if you're ever on the lecture circuit,<eos> I'll be sure to get some tickets for me and my friends, but as for tonight, I'm getting kind of hungry.<eos> We have a deal or not?<eos> Nah.<eos> We do not.
Well, it wasn't for me.<eos> For me, it was real.<eos> Those weren't Billy the Convict from Indiana's lips kissing your lips on stage tonight.<eos> Those were Andy's lips.<eos> Those were my lips.<eos> And don't even try and tell me that those were hard-nosed Electro-City DA,<eos> Pamela Needlehoffer's lips kissing my lips, those were Katie's lips, A.K.A. your lips.<eos> The only reason that I said that I was acting was because you said you were acting first!<eos> - No, I didn't!<eos> - Yes, you did!
You know, I'm just admiring your living room, 'cause... it reminds me of a place I used to live for about nine years.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> You are stretching!<eos> Your marriage still means something to you, doesn't it?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> I-I took my vows barefoot in front of the earth goddess...<eos> So that I could be connected to the soil and everything cosmic.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> [Scoffs] As if.<eos> Yes, you do!
- I got to go.<eos> - Go away from here.<eos> You stink like a she goat at mating time.<eos> We don't want to smell your shit all night.<eos> 8 pesos, Presidente.<eos> I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> Yes, you did, mi General.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
God damn.<eos> We can't get it all now.<eos> Got to come back before we head out.<eos> Well, goodness gracious.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's the mother lode... Santa Anna's treasure.<eos> You snakes weren't gonna tell me about it?<eos> Well, why should we?<eos> We found it.<eos> Lucky for me, so did I.
The man retreats to victory and then transmogrifies himself by grog house gaggle into a hero-- a hero that'll sweep his ass right into this office.<eos> That's President Jackson.<eos> He and Houston want to annex our Texas.<eos> Always been his plan to suck Texas up in the states.<eos> We'll publicize the fact that the-- the big drunk, he abandoned his post with a wound that didn't prevent him from whoring and boozing while Texas wallows in hunger and chaos.<eos> Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> (Baker) Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
This isn't good.<eos> She's categorically refusing a medical exam.<eos> Which means the congressman is probably telling the truth<eos> About the affair being over.<eos> But it still doesn't exonerate him.<eos> He bought a gun because he was terrified of her, And yet he went to visit her the day his wife went missing.<eos> Maybe sophie found out about them and tried to expose him.<eos> The problem is, If he's not behind the kidnapping, We don't have any other leads, an it's...<eos> Till the deadline. And we don't have any way to contact the kidnappers.<eos> Maybe we do.
You want to go again?<eos> No. You satisfied me the first time.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ Walden, do you believe in destiny?<eos> I believe in Destiny's Child.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Think of everything that happened that led us to this moment.<eos> Oh, see, that...<eos> I'd rather not.<eos> I know you don't want to talk about my relationship with Alan.<eos> No, I don't.
In this dump?<eos> You just said you liked it.<eos> That was when I thought it was for you.<eos> But for the two of us?<eos> There's no study.<eos> Where would I write my novel?<eos> You're writing a novel?<eos> Well, when I finish my screenplay.<eos> Do you not want to live with me?<eos> No, of course I do.
Let's make a fire and then...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Should we go back?<eos> I'm so sorry that I distracted you.<eos> Let me see how I can make it up.<eos> Warmer in the water.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> I just felt something. I don't know.<eos> I did, too.
- and we bring it to your supermarket."<eos> - Yeah, I love it.<eos> - Great opportunities for social here, right? - Yeah.<eos> - Would you like the front page? - No, thank you.<eos> - Read it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Get it on your iPad?<eos> - No.<eos> Then how come you don't want it?<eos> Because I don't.
'When my work was done and May and Hammond had drunk all the beer, 'we turned in for the night.'<eos> ~ What was that? !<eos> ~ That was the sound of me saving your life.<eos> 'The next morning, our campsite looks like an abattoir.'<eos> ~ What's this?<eos> ~ Crocodile's ear.<eos> ~ It's hairy.<eos> ~ Crocodiles do have hairy ears.<eos> They don't even have ears.<eos> They do.
God doesn't speak to people outside of Charlton Heston films.<eos> God definitely didn't speak to anyone in Slough in the '80s.<eos> You were unwell.<eos> No, not back then.<eos> I wasn't sick then.<eos> You heard a voice in your head, and you left a newborn baby in a cold, empty car park.<eos> Church car park.<eos> You left me... at night... in the middle of winter.<eos> I could have died.<eos> But you didn't.
I will ring you constantly.<eos> There's this thing called e-mail. Everyone's getting them.<eos> It's not about that.<eos> Mum...<eos> They still look sore.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But they'll heal.<eos> I am learning how to handle things.<eos> But how am I gonna know you're OK?<eos> You don't.
Ah, damn it, now I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> So, how you doing?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Thanks again for seeing me.<eos> It's very kind of you.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Is this Alvin?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't know he wanted to be cremated.<eos> He didn't.
Neil, those aren't my type.<eos> What is your type?<eos> I don't think I've ever known.<eos> Well, he's handsome... with a sense of humor.<eos> He's successful, and a little mysterious,<eos> and he's got to be great in bed.<eos> But he's also sweet and someone I'd want to have my children with, someone I can trust.<eos> That's a tall order.<eos> Where you gonna find someone like that?<eos> I did it once.
She looks pretty healthy to me.<eos> Well, I didn't call you about her.<eos> Oh, you look very healthy too, Ms. Newberg.<eos> I feel healthy.<eos> Vigorous, even.<eos> Especially after last weekend when I went to see your dad upstate during his book tour.<eos> I have a feeling I'm not gonna want to hear too much more about it.<eos> Our time together is so special.<eos> Exhausting, really, if you know what I mean.<eos> We do, we do.
That's a good quality in a doctor.<eos> And a lover.<eos> It's a... it's a different family. I know.<eos> ♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪<eos> ♪ For the first time in my life ♪ ♪ I see love ♪<eos> ♪ For the first time in my life ♪ ♪ I see love ♪<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> Did you make a doctor's appointment?<eos> Put that down, and I'll tell you.<eos> No, I did not.
~ Neither am I, but...<eos> A friend of mine's brother had Down's Syndrome and his parents were still looking after him in their 70s.<eos> And then the dad died and it was just the mum left.<eos> I used to see them in the supermarket and she never once looked anything but old and really, really tired.<eos> Who fucking whistles their way round a supermarket?<eos> Maybe they went home, smoked a joint, watch Judge Judy and had a great time?<eos> ~ What do you want to do?<eos> ~ Do you mind if we don't talk about it any more?<eos> ~ It's not going to happen.<eos> ~ But if it did...
We're We're gonna get some food.<eos> Sorry. Just needed to get away from that conversation.<eos> - And that woman.<eos> - Who was she?<eos> That was Abby.<eos> The new guidance counselor I was telling you about.<eos> She doesn't seem so bad.<eos> She's got everybody brainwashed about the SATs tomorrow.<eos> Did you decide whether or not you're taking them?<eos> - No, mom, I didn't.
- Well, because she's fucking crazy.<eos> - Ah. She has been trying to shake down Vernon Littlefield.<eos> Now she's trying to shake down me.<eos> Trash like this is why I didn't want you here in the first place.<eos> - Joe mentioned that.<eos> - Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.
You see, girls, the bad thing about being bullied is that every time it happens, it steals a little piece of who you are.<eos> And then, if it happens enough, little by little, you become just a little less of who you were meant to be.<eos> And that's not cool.<eos> And these two girls up here, without knowing it, I'm sure, stole a little piece of Max and Caroline. when they stole their little idea.<eos> And that's so not cool.<eos> Yeah, that's so not cool.<eos> Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.<eos> Ash, I never said that.<eos> Ah, no, Kemberly.<eos> I did.
Thank you.<eos> You're a bad-ass too.<eos> No.<eos> I'm just a bitch with money and power.<eos> But I do make it look good.<eos> You were out late.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's all this about?<eos> I just wanna say that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
Okay.<eos> Where are we, DiNozzo?<eos> We are in the big orange room.<eos> We know where are.<eos> Where are you?<eos> McGee hasn't pinged my phone yet?<eos> Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't tell us? Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.<eos> I don't.
Just having some contractions.<eos> That is very lame.<eos> True, but that's enough to make you laugh.<eos> And that endorphin release will increase your pain threshold, make what's bothering you bother you less.<eos> Just... I have a bad feeling.<eos> About the birth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's about Alex?<eos> I don't...
I was starting to miss the old Juliette and now, this has happened and it just, it feels, it feels so final, you know?<eos> I just wish I'd had a chance to say some kind of goodbye.<eos> You guys, the point is he feels responsible for Trubel, if she's even still alive.<eos> So, it makes sense, you know, he's grasping at whatever straw he can find.<eos> Got some stuff on Chavez.<eos> What?<eos> Chavez has an exemplary record with the Bureau.<eos> Five years ago, she was given the FBI Award for Meritorious Achievement.<eos> Got an address?<eos> I do.
Well, Chavez is the only name we've got.<eos> Then we keep digging.<eos> Any changes?<eos> Not for the better.<eos> We're playing with fire.<eos> We're going to need fire.<eos> Dude. You need to answer your phone.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just... I came to see if, you know, you needed any help.<eos> No, I don't.
But, er... yeah.<eos> Until I got on track, and had everything like for like, I wasn't obviously sure how it would go, but coming into it, I didn't expect to be, you know, the guy following him every weekend.<eos> You know, I obviously came in with some self belief and then I think that sort of showed and then confidence grew after that.<eos> There were 19 races last year and you beat him in how many?<eos> ~ I don't know, er...<eos> How many was it?<eos> ~ 14 of them.<eos> ~ 14?<eos> ~ Don't pretend you didn't know!<eos> No, I-I didn't really, actually.
Mar--<eos> I'm sorry, Clark. I, uh...<eos> Martha, where are you going?<eos> To my parents'.<eos> I need a break.<eos> We need a break. - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
Mine.<eos> I had worked too hard and too long to let you and that bitch wife of yours stand in my way.<eos> Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That would've drawn too much attention.<eos> So, when you couldn't get at me... you went after the thing I loved.<eos> Oh, come on, Walt.<eos> Martha had cancer.<eos> She was already dead.<eos> Now, what did I do?
This is Walt.<eos> This is Walt.<eos> 18 gaming tables and over 800 state-of-the-art slot machines.<eos> It's opening day at Four Arrows Resort and Casi...<eos> Ruby, send Ferg down.<eos> - Walt!<eos> - Ferg.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Where'd you buy this from?<eos> I didn't.
- You can't say anything.<eos> - I'm getting pummeled out there.<eos> - She's right, Cy.<eos> It can't look like I'm behind the curve.<eos> Anything you say right now will end up vilifying law enforcement.<eos> I was on duty.<eos> I, uh, heard over the radio that a kid had just shoplifted a cellphone from a store on Ambrose Street I'm driving on.<eos> About 10 seconds later, I see him walking.<eos> How do you know it's the same kid?<eos> I don't, of course, not at first.
No, and I'm not going to.<eos> I mean, she could have died and you're acting like you wouldn't have even cared.<eos> Lori, she sent me here.<eos> I thought you came because your parents kicked you out.<eos> I think she was just trying to get me to lure Carter away from the Wilsons.<eos> I think that's maybe something that Carter should know.<eos> I'm just wondering why you never told me about what happened to your mom.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> - I don't want you to think that.<eos> - No, I don't.
So it's settled.<eos> I'll ride with Max.<eos> I'll see you guys there.<eos> You know, that's cool, those two driving together.<eos> Maybe they'll patch things up.<eos> Yeah, that would be good.<eos> Max and Taylor?<eos> I'm behind.<eos> Last I heard, Max and Taylor were way over and Ofe had it bad for Taylor.<eos> He did, but, yeah,
It's a weekend in the woods, Bird, not a catalogue shoot.<eos> Yeah, well, I appreciate rustic as much as the next girl, but this is a little too much.<eos> I mean, knotty pine, really?<eos> Something has to be done.<eos> So, um... are you gonna talk to Carter about Lori?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When?<eos> I don't know, soon.<eos> Sorry, I... didn't mean to make you feel guilty.<eos> Well, you did.
No, you just figured it would make me jealous, but, spoiler alert, I don't give a shit who Archer bangs.<eos> Well, yeah, no, but if you did, and you wanted to make Archer jealous...<eos> Then I'd go break my pussy off on that hot little prince's merguez.<eos> Exactly, that's what I'm-- Wait, what?<eos> Which, come to think of it, would be what my vagina refers to as a "win-win."<eos> But wait a minute!<eos> Love to, can't, got a pussy to break.<eos> Well, that backfired.<eos> Or did it?<eos> Yes, yes, it most certainly did.
- Yeah, thank God for that.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> You just calling to bust some balls or what?<eos> Well, I was thinking about visiting, you know, bringing the girls.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'm sure Mom and Dad would like to see you, too, if you want to make the drive over there.<eos> You really want me to come?<eos> You're not just saying that?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Of course I do.
Well, despite all that, today's going to be fun, Dad!<eos> Will there be lots of other girls there?<eos> For some reason, there's been a lot of infertility at the nuclear plant.<eos> After we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served.<eos> Ew! And upon leaving, you will each receive a piece of orangewood to bite down on during childbirth.<eos> Excellent.<eos> It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers.<eos> Oh, you're always my ray of...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Dad, what does that do?
She's an honest-to-God princess.<eos> Ah, really?<eos> Hey, tell me something.<eos> I heard that Queen Elizabeth in person is actually not that funny.<eos> I am from Africa.<eos> Wow, Africa.<eos> I had a good friend who really wanted to go there.<eos> So, uh, you speak English there?<eos> I speak five languages.<eos> Nobody does.
You won't be able to walk down the street without someone pointing and saying,<eos> "There's the Timegasm lady""<eos> And that's the thought that keeps me up at night.<eos> Oh... but, you know, but I... I am having a bit of a dilemma. And you're the smartest person that I know, so I've...<eos> Ah, they all do.<eos> It's in the writing. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've come across this character... brilliant man, handsome. I mean, almost beautiful.<eos> Uh, born in England, studied at Oxford.<eos> As did I.<eos> No, you didn't.
Although you were my next call after room service.<eos> I got to talk to somebody.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Carl, you know me.<eos> There's only three things I ever wanted in my life.<eos> Be a cop, get married and be a dad.<eos> Yup, that's why I love you. You're a simple man with simple needs who's simply adorable.<eos> Carl, Molly doesn't want to have kids anymore.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Of course she does.
I think I just got scared that... I couldn't give you a baby, so... I started telling myself I didn't want one.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> At least, when I went back on birth control, it was... you know, it wasn't my fault I couldn't get pregnant. It was the...<eos> it was the pill's.<eos> Sweetie... it's nobody's fault.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're in this together.<eos> Yeah, but what if we can't have a baby?<eos> I just need to know that you want to.<eos> I really do. Okay!
OK.<eos> Well, thank you for telling me that.<eos> Well, that's OK.<eos> PHONE CHIMES<eos> What is wrong with him?<eos> ~ Happy birthday.<eos> SHARON SQUEALS<eos> Wow. I haven't had a birthday gift in a few years, you know, that...<eos> I can open, with paper and all that, so, I don't even care what's in here.<eos> Aw. Actually I do.
Come on, Augustus!<eos> - I gotta go change.<eos> - Come on, boy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey, Buster!<eos> Get your hand out of there.<eos> What'd I tell you about eating other people's food, huh?<eos> How you doing?
And he believes that we're part of a plot against him.<eos> Nonetheless, Eric Chambers remains our prime suspect unless proof comes in that he isn't.<eos> In the meantime, sir, I'd like to take another run at him.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I'm not talking.<eos> Well, that's okay.<eos> You don't have to talk.<eos> You can just listen.<eos> Yeah, we know that... you're not the shooter.<eos> Of course you do.
Speaking of parade, what's up with the twirling?<eos> Did you not hear that F bomb I dropped on that Clement rep?<eos> I wanted to make a strong impression, but... not like that.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What did Theo say?<eos> Not talking about it.<eos> I'm focusing on my future.<eos> Tomorrow, I will make a lasting second impression via my lifelong passion for baton.<eos> You don't have a lifelong passion for baton.<eos> Uh, yeah, Amy, I do.
Wait until you see Cadillac Ranch.<eos> Reagan, I can't go on the road with you this summer.<eos> Let me guess... Karma talked you out of it? No.<eos> She just reminded me of who I am.<eos> And who is that, exactly?<eos> A sexually confused girl who... wants to go to college.<eos> So you're not a lesbian either.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I don't have everything figured out<eos> - like you do.
I'm here about Castiel.<eos> Was there any of his Grace left?<eos> Question is, are you willing to pay for it?<eos> He must be returned intact.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Told you last time I saw you I'd get out of the slammer.<eos> We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Actually, I did.
I would have picked you for a Gamma Moo.<eos> - Perky much?<eos> - Wow, a grown-up mean girl.<eos> Mommy issues?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Your dead pledge, Caroline, her mommy was your pledge master back in the day.<eos> - Treated you like crap, I'm guessing.<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
And... then there are the missing artifacts.<eos> Library's missing artifacts?<eos> 16, last count.<eos> When were you gonna say something?<eos> Sir, I thought I could figure it out before anyone found out.<eos> Tactical error on my part.<eos> Which we will be discussing later at length.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - However, at the moment, if that's true, we don't know how to get to the heart.<eos> No, but with Ariel, Prospero does.
Now nothing.<eos> Mr. Stone.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's done.<eos> At the rate they're going, we only have a few minutes left.<eos> And then what, huh?<eos> Jenkins?<eos> Tell me you got a plan "B."<eos> Yes, uh, Mr. Stone.<eos> I do.
I remember.<eos> You remember the Library?<eos> I remember Judson.<eos> Wise and brave and kind Judson.<eos> Your true father.<eos> A-and I remember Charlene.<eos> Funny and tough and loving Charlene.<eos> Do you, uh...<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Of course I do, Flynn.
Whatever you say, big daddy.<eos> - Is that too much?<eos> - Mm, fabulous.<eos> Magic is real.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Spells, witches, ghosts.<eos> I fought a tentacle monster.<eos> It's a weird gig.<eos> How do you use it? This magic?<eos> We don't.
They said it would be here.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> - All right, I got a class I gotta teach.<eos> - I'm calling the Bureau.<eos> It was a mistake leaving this to amateurs.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> We said we were doing this.<eos> We have to see it through.<eos> I don't know why I feel this way.<eos> - We just do.
Time-delay metallurgic cryptography.<eos> Yeah, but that's a lot of time.<eos> Statue of Liberty took two decades to turn green. - This must've taken...<eos> - Centuries?<eos> Message from the past, hidden.<eos> Not visible until this very moment.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> "Jenkins, the key is in your Guardian's name."<eos> You don't have a Guardian.<eos> Of course I do.
Now, if I've shut the breakers off at the source and the floors are running in series, do I have to worry about ground wires in a junction box? Nay?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I know.<eos> You know, I'm not crazy about eating with my hands, but turns out, I like Ethiopian food.<eos> Where did you find that place?<eos> - I read about it on a blog. - Oh.<eos> I like having a boyfriend who tries new places.<eos> Oh, your place looks great.<eos> You must have one hell of a decorator.<eos> I did.
- No. - It's happening out there.<eos> - They're doing it now?<eos> We had to.<eos> - These people don't have guns.<eos> - I could have stopped him.<eos> - If they had guns, they'd be using them.<eos> - Did you hear me? We have to get to the armory before they do.<eos> If we keep moving, this might work.<eos> You don't have to kill people.<eos> - Of course we do.
Do you remember the last time we were in Atlantic City?<eos> February 9, 2001, full moon.<eos> I remember you ditched me to play blackjack all night.<eos> Yeah, and I came back to the hotel room $8,000 up.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> All that cash.<eos> All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing. I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
It's okay.<eos> Both of you?<eos> We both work for you.<eos> Which is why we're both here to say maybe it's time we explore other options.<eos> You got to be kidding me. You spent two days on this, and you're ready to throw in the towel?<eos> We've spent two of our five days on it, and we still don't have a name, so we think it's time to consider--<eos> What?<eos> Going after Forstman for whatever he did to you 12 years ago.<eos> - You told her?<eos> - Yes, I did.
No long-term relationships?<eos> It's a hard-enough job as it is, but with no one to go home to...<eos> Never met the right guy.<eos> I realize it may be uncomfortable for you to talk about your personal life, but I just want to give you an opportunity to tell me anything I might need to know.<eos> Any romantic relationship that could have possibly compromised you in any way?<eos> I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me. But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
Well, thank you.<eos> Or... good luck.<eos> Israelis. People who I thought were my friends, but they traded me like a slave to these... thugs...<eos> These monsters who never let me speak to anyone or even send a message home.<eos> All my son knows is that one day, I didn't come home.<eos> Maybe I died.<eos> He doesn't know. Or maybe I... abandoned him.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> I lived most of my life here, Nina, but I never knew anyone who would do something like this.<eos> I did.
- No.<eos> Looks like our Mr. Peterson was into astronomy.<eos> Is this close to the time he was shot?<eos> No.<eos> I wanted to ease you into his final moments. - Why?<eos> - He was shot twice in the back.<eos> That could be very traumatic for you.<eos> I'm a rip-the-band-aid-off fast kind of girl. I can handle it.<eos> You need time to adjust.<eos> You do, I don't.
All of the extra precautions at the lab,<eos> - and all of this hovering.<eos> - I'm being responsible.<eos> I'm not your responsibility.<eos> Yes, in fact, you are.<eos> When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Well, Lord knows I love the man and I appreciate his enthusiasm for fatherhood...<eos> But he's really putting his shoulder into it, isn't he?<eos> He needs to get back to work.<eos> I think it would be better for everyone.<eos> [knocks on door] Lieutenant.<eos> Had dinner with Chief Tiberg st night.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yeah, our kids do Tae Kwan Do together.<eos> He said... said you came to see him.<eos> I did, yeah.
I don't think he's diluting that.<eos> I think he's drinking it neat.<eos> I like to think it might be really helpful if you just sit down and have a chat about your problems.<eos> With someone who has compasionate views.<eos> Is this just because Padraic was hiding in your closet?<eos> Sure he does that here.<eos> He'll come out of the closet when he's good and ready.<eos> To be honest Deb, we have tried stuff.<eos> Books, and watching Dr. Bill.<eos> We even did a mediation thing with the priest.
Aw, yeah!<eos> Hey, yo, what's up, everybody?<eos> My name is Alex. I am a Sagittarius, and sometimes I like to break into spontaneous fits of dancing.<eos> Dance spin.<eos> Scarecrow dance.<eos> Michael Jackson.<eos> Modern.<eos> Anyway, I hope you consider me worthy of... "Danse Haus." Yah!<eos> Oh, shit, I totally forgot to press record.<eos> Oh, no, you... you did, really?
The president asked you to serve, and you said yes.<eos> So before you turn your back on a job that only 47 people have had in the history of this nation, I need to hear why you said yes in the first place.<eos> I have a 10-year-old daughter.<eos> Her name is Casey.<eos> I want her and every other child in this country to grow up in a nation that will allow them to fulfill their dreams just like I'm doing right now.<eos> Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
Cyrus, talk to him.<eos> Did Olivia tell you to come here?<eos> She says you're worried I'm going to ruin your career.<eos> "Cripple your journalistic integrity,"<eos> I believe were the words she used.<eos> I didn't tell her that, but she's right.<eos> I want to be Cyrus Beene's husband, and I want to be a journalist, but I don't want to be "Cyrus Beene's husband, the journalist."<eos> I want to be married to you, but I don't want anyone to think that I'm your lapdog.<eos> - Does that make sense?<eos> - Of course it does.
Okay, dad, look. If it'll help, I'll call the hotel people and I'll straighten all this out.<eos> I don't think more calls from you is the answer, and by the way,<eos> I don't think you're gonna get that job anymore. Fine!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I don't care! I never wanted that job in the first place!<eos> Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
No leaks. Looks good.<eos> The streak's alive.<eos> What was that, Wilson?<eos> Wait, nothing. I didn't... I didn't...<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You said, "the streak is alive."<eos> No!<eos> No, I said, "freak."<eos> I said, "the freak is alive."<eos> No, you didn't.
Listen to him going on there. "Blah, blah, blah."<eos> You have no idea what it's like, Mike.<eos> Oh, I got some idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know what you people did to get in here.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Bottom line... you're on tink time now.<eos> And that means no smoking, no texting, no sexting, no mexting...<eos> Yeah, that's Mexican texting, where you write stuff in Spanish so you think I won't understand.<eos> But yo do.
- Anything else, Dr. Carlin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Recently she's developed a deep-seated paranoia.<eos> Paranoid?<eos> About what?<eos> She's convinced that she's being watched.<eos> It was about the break-in?<eos> Nice outfit, Soto.<eos> Liked it better when you wore it yesterday.<eos> Oh, I did?
She looked like a guy?<eos> You know why? - She probably was a guy.<eos> - She was wearing a dress, - and she had makeup on.<eos> - All right, that's enough.<eos> Can we change the subject, please?<eos> Yeah, guys, mind your own business and finish your homework, will you?<eos> Come on.<eos> We haven't been out in months. What do you say?<eos> Do I really have a choice?<eos> No, you do not.
- All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Tony, take a walk.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> - Hey, Moose.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your lunch.<eos> Who's this guy you're bringing down here?<eos> We work together.<eos> - We never done it like this before, Vince.
The last thing I need to worry about is bullman's love life.<eos> Have the talk.<eos> You don't want to get emotionally attached to one of those kinda girls, okay?<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> What do you say, dollface?<eos> My Uncle's pissed at you, Vince.<eos> First you arrest Sergio and then you threaten to arrest him?<eos> Well, he was breaking the law. Very funny.<eos> Look, I love your Uncle, but he's always trying to slip shit past us, and very often he succeeds.<eos> This time, he didn't.
To be honest, you said you wanted to go everywhere.<eos> So we ran out of fuel an hour ago, but I didn't want to disappoint you, so I will toss down a tow rope.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Man...<eos> Uh... this is not good.<eos> (sighs) Marge, do you ever worry that you made a giant mistake in your life?<eos> Oh, um... I need a little context.<eos> Not drinking beer has given me the clearness of mind to realize drinking beer is bad.<eos> I've got to undo what I've done.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Why am I the only person fighting for us?<eos> This is fighting for us.<eos> No, this is running away.<eos> We've never spent this much time apart.<eos> I mean, what... what if we can't come back from this?<eos> I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is fighting for us.<eos> No, this is running away.<eos> We've never spent this much time apart.<eos> I mean, what... what if we can't come back from this?<eos> I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Of course I do.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, I hate to bother you, but my car broke down.<eos> Could... could I use your phone?<eos> I... I saw that your light's on.<eos> You know, I'm sure you're busy, but, uh, if you wouldn't mind, it would just take a minute.<eos> Don't you have a... a cell phone?<eos> I do, but I...
Agent Keen, what a pleasure.<eos> But you said you didn't know him, you'd never met him.<eos> Did he, what, just expect you to believe him?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I had no idea what he expected.<eos> I'm a criminal.<eos> Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must have known how strange all of this was.<eos> Of course I did.
What are you talking about?<eos> I set the table.<eos> Well, I would have been next in line, and I did not like it.<eos> I made everyone's favorite... mac and cheese omelettes.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Breakfast for dinner.<eos> My favorite.<eos> So, um, mom, I have something for you.<eos> Oh, do you guys hear something?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
That's just another cardboard cutout.<eos> Ah, right, when people talk, you don't see their words.<eos> Okay, dad, the first thing I want to do is go to the United Nations.<eos> Hayley, we're in New York City.<eos> There's no way I'm doing that.<eos> I want to go on a copper-mine tour.<eos> I-I don't think they have that here.<eos> Hayley, everywhere I've ever vacationed has a copper-mine tour -- New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska.<eos> You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?
I have tried everywhere else.<eos> The Society is my last throw of the dice.<eos> Sir!<eos> We're growing stale, we need fresh opinions. Oh, I'm...<eos> I'm afraid that those books have been sold, sir.<eos> - I reserved them!<eos> - Yes, I am sorry for it, sir.<eos> Oh, it is no matter.<eos> Do you have anything upon the nature of clouds, rain, atmospheres?<eos> Yes, sir. Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger. No.<eos> They don't.
A connection between Christoph and zhulov.<eos> - You're kidding. - No.<eos> Zhulov was in many of the same places as Christoph<eos> In the last year Christoph was known to be active.<eos> I think he was Christoph's set-up man... Opening accounts, commandeering supplies, Arranging logistics.<eos> You need to get to zhulov and talk to him.<eos> Zhulov hasn't said a word since we took him down.<eos> As I recall, he told me to screw myself forever.<eos> Because you never had any leverage over him.<eos> Now, with his connection to Christoph, you do.
Sure, sure.<eos> No need to worry about Lisa.<eos> Lisa's always fine.<eos> No worries there. Nah.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I bet you escaped, and now Flanders is worried sick.<eos> I should call him... after I scratch your tummy!<eos> That's right!<eos> Who likes their tummy scratched while Flanders is worried sick?<eos> You do!
Was that us?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I like it when it's not us.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Roman numerals.<eos> Photosynthesis.<eos> Uh, Robert E. Lee.<eos> Miss Hoover, are you teaching or are you just saying anything that comes into your head?<eos> Miss Hoover, please report to the main office.<eos> You just did that in your hand!
It's about the famine.<eos> The famine?<eos> Ireland, 1845.<eos> The awful blight upon the potato crop?<eos> It's called An Gorta Mor.<eos> Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now? No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
Hell's wrong with her?<eos> She's kind of a drunk.<eos> She'll sober up.<eos> Drunk, huh?<eos> You want to take down The Countess?<eos> So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.<eos> We both did.
What were we talking about?<eos> Honey, it happens all the time now.<eos> "Cassie, where my keys?<eos> Cassie, what day is it?"<eos> You talk to the doctor, Daddy?<eos> Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
You would just be doing your job.<eos> My job is to arrest them.<eos> And how does that make you feel?<eos> When you collar a man, as opposed to letting your fists be jury and judge?<eos> If it was up to me? Yes.<eos> I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not.<eos> I know.<eos> I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I killed a man tonight.<eos> And how did it feel?<eos> Like justice.<eos> Like I was punishing the man who stole my boy.<eos> But you tried to kill yourself.<eos> Because I loved it.<eos> I loved it more than anything I've ever experienced in my life.<eos> Of course you did.
If I pull them into this, they could get in trouble too.<eos> Well, you might get into even bigger trouble.<eos> It's them or you.<eos> Do you think I should mention Leo's name?<eos> I mean, if it comes down to it?<eos> Well, isn't a good reporter supposed to, like, never reveal her sources?<eos> Even when said source decided to go all '80s and do blow at an event where I was working, and then have the nerve to get angry at me<eos> - for being pissed? ! - Okay.<eos> First, why don't we step away from the knife?<eos> Okay, the strawberries didn't do anything to you.
Yeah, something like that.<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Want me to give you a DNA sample or something? No.<eos> I don't have anything from the fourth grade to match it to.<eos> You know, Stiles, I came back here for Scott but I also came back for you.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> Someone who's willing to walk into the woods in the middle of the night to protect his friends.<eos> I don't have anyone like that, but Scott does.<eos> You all do.
I can't calm down.<eos> I can't move. It won't last long.<eos> We're going to be okay.<eos> Doc, how do we focus?<eos> Think of a body part.<eos> Your hands, your feet, even just the tips of your fingers.<eos> Imagine them moving.<eos> See it in your mind and your body will follow.<eos> Sure you know where you're going? I know where I am.<eos> So do I. Middle of nowhere.
- Uh-huh.<eos> - Okay, I...<eos> - I go down on a guy...<eos> - I don't want...<eos> I said... I changed the words!<eos> I go down on a guy I like to decide whether or not I want to sleep with him.<eos> Like, I'll do it, like, two or three times to keep him interested, and, you know...<eos> It's my system.<eos> Okay... you have a system?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Flora.<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> She was never out of our sight.<eos> And besides, she was terrified of him.<eos> I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
Yeah, not exactly like...<eos> But, yeah, once or twice.<eos> So you've had to deal with people who are scared.<eos> What do you say to them?<eos> I'm asking what I should say to you.<eos> That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Was I that obvious?<eos> Oh, only to those of us in the know, so...<eos> I feel so embarrassed, not to mention boring and conventional.<eos> Hey, don't say that.<eos> You got out of your comfort zone.<eos> You kissed another woman and enjoyed her ample breasts.<eos> Yeah, I did, didn't I?<eos> You know what?<eos> I've changed my mind. I think I want to do this.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
Wow. So this is, like, another national emergency.<eos> Yes, Jerold.<eos> Does this thing have a bathroom?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> It's so tiny.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Do we... do we have to sh... share it or...<eos> I'll just hold it.<eos> I can walk!<eos> Good. Do it.
- What's happening?<eos> The shard must have punctured his lung.<eos> Get me a syringe.<eos> Stay with me, okay?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> He's got a lot of pressure in his lung.<eos> If I don't release it, he could die.<eos> Can you release it?<eos> If I find the spot between his second and third rib.<eos> - And if you don't?
Or next door, whichever's closer.<eos> You definitely mousse.<eos> This is mine and Wally's special room, just for the two of us.<eos> And a rabbit.<eos> Oh, yeah, Hercules.<eos> I bought him as a pet for Wally.<eos> Seems sensible.<eos> So when did you find Wally was missing?<eos> I didn't.<eos> My vet, Mr Hewitt, did.
And I jumped out and tried to stop the guys from lowering this box in, into the ground.<eos> After that, they had a big problem with me, because I would run away.<eos> They took me to school, I would run away.<eos> At home I would run away.<eos> A number of times, they had to call the police to go find me.<eos> I would just run away and go hide somewhere.<eos> Did your dad do anything to make up for the disappearance of your mother in your life?<eos> Did he say, "Well, now I'm going to come home more frequently"<eos> or "I'm going to change..."? He never said that.<eos> And he did not.
That's the only kind of gun I've never fired.<eos> Come on, just point and squeeze.<eos> I know that guy.<eos> Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.<eos> No, he works at the plant with me. Homer something.<eos> ♪ When we harmonize ♪ ♪ And you look in our eyes ♪ ♪ You'll see it's no surprise ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause, girl, you know it's true ♪<eos> ♪ All four of us love you ♪ ♪ Yeah, we do, yeah, we do, yeah, we do ♪<eos> ♪ Monday I love you ♪<eos> ♪ Tuesday I do, too ♪
I thought I hit bottom when I got sent to prison, but turns out, I wasn't even close.<eos> After those cold steel gates slammed shut behind me, I was so lonely and hopeless,<eos> I decided I might as well start drinking again.<eos> I felt like that at rehab when they took away my iPad.<eos> Now... for those of you who haven't been to prison, you pretty much have two choices when it comes to getting loaded:<eos> Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
You raped my mother.<eos> You sent your goons to threaten her.<eos> She lost everything, even me.<eos> She tried to kill herself after what you did to her.<eos> Now you're going to see what it feels like to lose everything.<eos> You kill me, and you'll only destroy yourself.<eos> The evidence I have against you...<eos> Will disappear, just like it did 25 years ago.<eos> You have nothing to substantiate any of this.<eos> Actually, we do.
Dark magic always comes with a price.<eos> We know that. We've been down that road before.<eos> Well, let's at least translate it, see what it says.<eos> You guys don't understand.<eos> The book's been calling out to me ever since I laid eyes on it, okay?<eos> Calling out to the Mark.<eos> I can hear it like it's alive.<eos> It wants me to use it, but not for good.?<eos> Look, I wanted it to be the answer, too, okay?<eos> I really did.
I did not kill Eugene Ames.<eos> That's the only truth you need to know.<eos> Well, a jury may feel differently.<eos> And something tells me we're about to find out.<eos> We're done.<eos> I'll issue my ruling in the morning.<eos> Die Entrechteten.<eos> Really, Aram. These misanthropes have been on my radar for years.<eos> The FBI must have some kind of file.<eos> No. We do.
Oh, God.<eos> Go away. Go away. Go away.<eos> Cristela, dónde estás?<eos> Let me guess. You're looking for Cristela?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm her boss, Trent Culpepper. Oh!<eos> Mr. Culpepper.<eos> Ha. This is my mother...<eos> Natalia. She doesn't speak English.<eos> I do, too.
Um, it is too early to say, but he's in good hands.<eos> All right, now this looks like a through-and-through. Whoa!<eos> You're missing a chunk of muscle, and you have exposed bone fragments.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - What?<eos> Uh, no, I just can't believe what I'm looking at.<eos> - That bad, huh? - No, no, no.<eos> I just mean I can't believe that you carried your guy in on this leg.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
And if it was a spy for France?<eos> If proof of your plan gets back to Francis, we might both lose our heads, whether Francis wants it or not.<eos> Surprise.<eos> It's you.<eos> You were expecting someone else?<eos> If your mother knew you were in my bed, she would not be happy.<eos> A fact of which you, Claude... are well aware.<eos> Does this technique typically work for you?<eos> Pursuing a man who has already politely declined?<eos> Of course it does.
!<eos> Bit of a mixed bag, I guess. It's just a wine spill.<eos> Yeah, most repairs I get called out to are fluid-related.<eos> Don't want to put too much thought into that.<eos> Myrna, we are T-minus-20 minutes, before Mr Handsome appears at your door.<eos> Love connections happening, y'all!<eos> Look, I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I mean, Charles seems great, honestly, but I haven't dated in a coon's age.<eos> I mean, last time I went on a date, people still said "coon's age".<eos> Yeah, they don't any more.
Yes, I pressed her. Of course I did.<eos> Repeatedly for specific detail.<eos> She actually said she saw him digging a hole in the copse in the middle of the night, then he got something...<eos> - stuck it down there. - Something?<eos> Probably a carpet.<eos> Cos that's what a sane man does in the middle of the night, isn't it? - You think she's sane?<eos> - According to you mate, she's fine.<eos> A little forgetful, but, other than that, fine.<eos> She actually said that she thought it was a body?<eos> Yes, she did.
Just do what we've agreed.<eos> - You seem to have it good.<eos> Are you Claes Sandberg?<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Arrived<eos> - Saga Norén, Malmo Police.<eos> - Saga, it's Lillian.<eos> - Hans is on a respirator.<eos> - Did he stop breathing?<eos> Yes, all of a sudden.<eos> They've done tests, but they don't know what it is.<eos> - His autonomic nervous system isn't working.<eos> - Yes, but they don't know why.<eos> - I don't either.
We talked about it, and we actually came to sort of a bad end, actually, so that's where we are right now.<eos> "Right now"?<eos> Can you just leave it? Is that all right?<eos> I am just repeating the words that you said.<eos> Yeah, well, just -- just repeat something else.<eos> You know, honey, we used to be able to talk, as mother and daughter.<eos> I mean -- yeah, when I was like 10.<eos> But now you just look down your nose at everything I do with this disdain for everything that I do.<eos> I do not look down my nose at you.<eos> Yeah, you do. You do. You do, too.
Well, then, maybe you need to look at yourself.<eos> "Judge not, lest ye be judged."<eos> Matthew 7:1.<eos> "First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly."<eos> Matthew 7:5.<eos> "Thou shalt not covet thy parish's choir director."<eos> Book of Peggy, chapter one, verse one, phone call to the archdiocese.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Hey, if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the box!<eos> How you doing?
It's a competition.<eos> I got you.<eos> It's like when Carl starts talking about R B music.<eos> You know what I do?<eos> I rub my nose, hinting that he has a booger. Then that's all he can think about.<eos> Yeah, and then instead of going on and on about Marvin Gaye's dad, he's running for a napkin.<eos> Yeah, I... I don't know that these are the types of people that you're gonna throw off with a phantom booger.<eos> You know?<eos> They'll just assume you have one.<eos> Which you kind of do, by the way.
Well, I paid nine dollars for this hat.<eos> Seems like we both got ripped off.<eos> We have a problem here?<eos> N-No problem, Rafiki.<eos> What do you mean "No problem"?<eos> Trust me, Mr. Weber.<eos> There is no problem.<eos> Enjoy the beautiful day.<eos> She really said she wants an open relationship?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
He's right, Coach, I don't know why we're trying so hard to make you fit in here.<eos> You're Coach, - sex in a sweat suit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have great looks. I got 'em, and I passed them on to you.<eos> So get out there, you beautiful peacock.<eos> Shake your tail feathers.<eos> I mean, I'd rather not get these compliments with my pants down, but appreciate it.<eos> Paul, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.<eos> You don't have to clown for these people.<eos> Yes, you do.
What she said was I was not to be shocked if you were to remarry, because that's what she would want for you.<eos> Do you have any particular candidate in mind?<eos> Father.<eos> ~ Wee Jimmy's proving to be quite a useful fielder.<eos> Aren't you, lad?<eos> Yes, very good.<eos> But if she did suspect, why would she tell Mary?<eos> To prepare her I suppose.<eos> But, I'm not sure she did suspect.<eos> What if she did, right from the start?
Liz's brother.<eos> - The brewmaster. - Yes.<eos> So how do you know my sister?<eos> She told me about your new business.<eos> - Sounds exciting.<eos> "Exhausting" is more like it.<eos> At least you can have a beer after a long day.<eos> This is true.<eos> Oh, you met Pam. Yes.<eos> I sure did.
Charlie Monahan.<eos> And he looks like the guy from the sketch.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> You killed Ken?<eos> I did it for you, Teri.<eos> But there is something I need you to do.<eos> Charlie Monahan has been on stress leave for the last six months.<eos> Did you try his house?<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, do something.<eos> I haven't touched one since college, and even then it was just to look under it for my keys.<eos> Max, take him off set.<eos> Be professional.<eos> How professional can I be?<eos> She's asking me to fluff his nutter.<eos> Yo, Nash!<eos> So... Marie.<eos> Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?<eos> Of course she did.
May I see your tickets?<eos> We're allowed to be creative from the neck up.<eos> I like your hair.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You traveling to Paris.<eos> First-class.<eos> In those jeans?<eos> You got first-class tickets to Paris?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> My fingers did it.
Of course.<eos> Huck, we don't need to find any other B613 agents.<eos> We have another witness.<eos> Me.<eos> I saw Jake kill James Novak and Vanessa Chandler and Shelby Moss.<eos> I can testify.<eos> To bring down B613, we need to bring down Command.<eos> Command is Rowan, but Command is also Jake.<eos> - You don't give up, do you?<eos> - No. I don't.
- Ever break your rule?<eos> Couple of times.<eos> Couple of times in two years?<eos> - More or less.<eos> - More?<eos> Or less.<eos> Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone.<eos> - I was.<eos> - You said you liked her.<eos> I still do.
She might meet someone she can't bear to lose.<eos> That happens... .. I believe.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I was emotional.<eos> Just possibly, I have made a terrible mistake.<eos> Maybe even a tidal wave.<eos> Time will tell, it always does.<eos> Whatever you did for Ashildr... .. I think she deserved it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
She'd say she'd... rather lie awake together than... than to sleep without me there, you know.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry about your wrist.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> Why don't you go back to sleep.<eos> Captain Grover, thank you for coming.<eos> All right, Max, what do you got?<eos> Well, as I suspected, the C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head and torso caused by the fall.<eos> But I didn't find evidence of foul play.<eos> Well, yeah, but you didn't find anything that proves that she wasn't pushed, right?<eos> No, I didn't.
No!<eos> Jenna, believe in love!<eos> Come on, Jenna, you're always complaining about what a [bleep] inconvenience it is to have Matty McKibben in love with you, so why don't you just go and shut it down?<eos> Fine. I will.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> Matty, you were right.<eos> I only hooked up with Collin because he was everything you weren't, including an [bleep].<eos> Jenna, listen.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> No, you don't.
And... let's be fair... I'm a much faster runner.<eos> - Do you usually get morning visitors?<eos> - No.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - Better late than never.<eos> Miss me?<eos> (somber folk music)<eos> - All the 3s have been played.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Question is, do you have a heart?<eos> Hm, of course you do.
I told you once before when you held a knife to my throat, I am ready for hell.<eos> But let me say two words before you do...<eos> Mary Sibley.<eos> What about her?<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
Too scared to try new things? Maybe I like my aspirin in a bottle.<eos> It's not new, by the way, acetylsalicylic acid.<eos> Hippocrates swore by it, but what does he know, right?<eos> So, I got George in my office.<eos> Seized an opportunity, did you?<eos> Yeah, I did. - And?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Maybe there's nothing to find.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - No, I don't.
If I do, this clears the slate between us?<eos> Yes.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You'regoingto thedancewith Cassie?<eos> Yes. She's helping me save face with mark and Annie.<eos> She's a good friend.<eos> What?<eos> Just for you, I think there's a little truth in this big lie.<eos> Where'd you find her?<eos> - We didn't.
We have a date.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> It was a pleasure talking to you.<eos> Oh, you too.<eos> So, I heard you're selling Keating house to a developer.<eos> Martha.<eos> In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council.<eos> So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is - the best option for our town?<eos> - I don't have the choice.<eos> - Sure you do.
Finally, something that we can agree on!<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm looking for...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, you're late.<eos> She didn't want to wait anymore.<eos> It's, uh, not good.<eos> This project could be very good for the town.<eos> But you not talking about it is almost worse than you talking about it.<eos> I don't.
And for some reason that's all I could talk about.<eos> Your ex?<eos> - Tough marriage, tougher break-up.<eos> I guess in the end we just wanted different things.<eos> She never really wanted kids.<eos> Me, I wanted a whole baseball team.<eos> It's funny how you can think you know someone when you don't, really.<eos> How about you and Jake?<eos> I loved him until the day he died.<eos> I still do.
We got time.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Here we go, I'm ready. - Come on.<eos> Quit holding.<eos> You're clicking your heels, Greane. Widen your stance.<eos> Kick, slide.<eos> Kick, slide. Basics.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Didn't you win a fucking Super Bowl, Greane?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Natasha's not here, but don't panic.<eos> I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.<eos> Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night...<eos> No!<eos> No way. We're on a quest.<eos> He's on a quest!<eos> With a vision.<eos> I did not know that.<eos> - You have a vision?<eos> - Yes, he does.
Previously on Defiance...<eos> I don't believe Rahm Tak will ever release Alak alive.<eos> A fully functional Omec warship could destroy the entire Votanis Collective.<eos> T'evgin needs to die.<eos> So long as that mad man has the power to expose us, we must obey his commands.<eos> Is that poison?<eos> I'll fill a hidden needle, and inject the Omec during coitus.<eos> Why do you want me dead?<eos> Actually, I don't.
I hear you, too, Dr. Scott.<eos> Nevertheless, I have to do this.<eos> The more you argue, the longer it will take, so...<eos> Tell me again, when did you first notice<eos> Niels take a turn for the worse?<eos> Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And?<eos> Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
Hey, Nika.<eos> It's me.<eos> Just call me and let me know that you're okay.<eos> Love you.<eos> S03E09 Best Enemies<eos> Detective Angie Flynn.<eos> I hear you're pretty shaken up, Mr. Sharpe.<eos> Julian Stancroft. I've advised my client that I'll respond to all questions on his behalf.<eos> - You want that?<eos> - He does.
- What is she doing here?<eos> - I invited her.<eos> Victoria, I beg you, do not let that woman into your life.<eos> Well, someone has to lighten the mood around here.<eos> You're about as depressing as a yankee groom at a Southern wedding.<eos> You tried to kill me, you lunatic.<eos> Okay, whatever did or did not happen was due to the fact that my family was drugging me.<eos> Former family.<eos> Victoria, please, you don't need her kind of help.<eos> Oh, the hell she doesn't.
Just get us the Mother Cell and all of this will be over.<eos> We can protect you.<eos> - Right, Agent Shafer?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I keep it hidden, - not far from here.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - We're going with you.<eos> - No. Absolutely not.<eos> - Look, you don't have a say in the matter, pal.<eos> - I certainly do.
Um... it's quiet. At the moment.<eos> Mitch is examining a bat.<eos> He discovered an abnormality in its eye.<eos> I swear to God, I am gonna kill that man before this is over. Yeah, I...<eos> I may beat you to it.<eos> And Abraham... he has his dark places, - no?<eos> Oui.<eos> Yeah. Perhaps someday he'll tell you about it.<eos> - So did you find Leo Butler?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
I didn't know I still had it.<eos> You know I love Justin, Mom, - right?<eos> - I know.<eos> But... do you think - if I got really bad...<eos> - Baby.<eos> - ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
But I know that working him is the key to winning Schizo's trust.<eos> The one person I don't have to work is Suzanna.<eos> Suzanna: How far did you say it is to Reno?<eos> Well, it's about seven hours up the 395.<eos> Suzanna: There's no way I'm riding on that thing for seven hours.<eos> Falco: Wait.<eos> What, you're not goin'?<eos> I think I'll see if Stella wants to drive up.<eos> You don't want to wear your girl out before you get there, do you?<eos> No, I do not.
- Yo-o-ou're welcome.<eos> Sapphire!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> Ruby!<eos> - Did they hurt you?<eos> - No, no. I'm okay.<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> - I do.
I can't have any trouble in here, man.<eos> That will depend on how this conversation goes.<eos> I know you.<eos> You came to my house a few days ago.<eos> Yes, and as chance would have it, your son and I are old friends.<eos> Lorenzo.<eos> It's you.<eos> So you two know each other?<eos> The phrase "small world" comes to mind.<eos> So does "epic understatement."
He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking.<eos> That's not exactly how it happened.<eos> And I quote...<eos> "She stared at me like I was an alien and then basically teleported out of the room."<eos> Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again. Wouldn't you freak out?<eos> I just... I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
Hello.<eos> Is Kirsten home?<eos> Why no, she is not.<eos> Liam?<eos> I knew there was no point in trying to surprise you, but I hope you're happy to see me.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Come in.<eos> But I have to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
The Dragon.<eos> It's our tooth in that logo.<eos> That's why it's pulled from the root and bloody. It's a trophy.<eos> Special Agent Rafi Ali, Homeland Security.<eos> I'm the task force team leader. You mind if I step in?<eos> Oh, go for it, Raff.<eos> The idea is to pull the dragon's teeth-- our teeth-- one-by-one. GIBBS:<eos> How?<eos> According to your case report, a thief used social media to find her target.<eos> Dragon's Tooth does the same, but for terror. How?
No.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Just talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Erm...<eos> Well, Tyler's, er kind of a social/political artist, I guess, is What he calls himself.<eos> But really he kind ofjust makes weird shit out of wood.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Tomorrow we'll go to that town hall meeting<eos> - and find out what we can.<eos> - No, I'm... I can't see Dale. With her.<eos> We have to go.<eos> People saw us in those caves.<eos> If we don't show up, they'll come looking.<eos> Is it possible I'm pregnant?<eos> I don't think so, hon.<eos> It felt so real.<eos> It still does.
But in real life, Courtney isn't healthy, is she?<eos> She's outside the dome and was born with severe brain damage from your drinking.<eos> She'll never talk, never read.<eos> Why did you lie to the group?<eos> I just can't imagine her the way that she is.<eos> What I did to her.<eos> So I just imagine something else, you know?<eos> She's out there with new parents, and they're helping her and loving her, and... the doctors are fixing her brain.<eos> 'Cause I can't live if I don't think that she has a chance, so...<eos> But she doesn't.
I knew you weren't one of us.<eos> Julia is still alive, isn't she?<eos> I bet she's...<eos> What did you put in the tea?<eos> I had to, Eva.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.
Well, that's the thing.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't feel anything at all.<eos> Of course Junior's not here when all the heavy lifting needs to be done.<eos> I haven't seen him all day.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Not since last night.<eos> Last night?<eos> Look, I've probably said too much already, especially considering Junior outranks me.<eos> I do, too.
To kill everyone infected with the Life Force.<eos> You don't know what you heard.<eos> You talk to anyone else?<eos> I will if you don't help me stop Hektor.<eos> You obviously don't know who you're talking to.<eos> I worked surveillance on the dome.<eos> I've seen you go all Ted Bundy on people.<eos> I also saw how much you care about this town.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - And neither does Hektor.
You don't seem to care that you don't know it.<eos> That's what I don't get.<eos> I wasn't valedictorian, but I'm not dumb.<eos> I know that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't even know why I'm defending myself.<eos> What does it matter if they think that?<eos> What does it matter what anyone thinks of me anyways?<eos> You don't care what your friends think of me?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
I guarantee I am.<eos> Maybe I didn't exactly die back there, but I...<eos> I sure as hell could have.<eos> I did look up from my car today. I did see a plane coming toward me.<eos> And for a split second, I did find myself thinking,<eos> "maybe this is it.<eos> This is where it all ends on 37th street between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."<eos> I know what a near-death experience is, and this wasn't my first.<eos> And it's true. Your life flashes right before your eyes.<eos> And this morning, mine did.
♪ Yeah... ♪<eos> Whoo! Shots fired, New York.<eos> I cannot stop playing this one.<eos> You already know this... That exclusive Lucious Lyon joint.<eos> Classic Empire for you, baby.<eos> Right here.<eos> He dropped that from prison?<eos> How?<eos> Your daddy, he has his ways.<eos> He always did.
You know what, if y'all thinking like that, then why don't y'all just do a little collaboration.<eos> I mean lay down a couple of tracks, see what happens.<eos> You real smart, but you behind the game, old man.<eos> We already been talking. It's gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, I got a little free time, I figured I'd come out on the road for a couple dates, you know, debut some of the new stuff.<eos> See, now that's a move your mama can't make.<eos> That's that thing that pushes you up to that whole other level. MICHAEL:<eos> Sorry, the gallery opening's in 30, so we got to...<eos> Michael, Ne-Yo.<eos> How you doing, brother? Wow!
You on the payroll now?<eos> I'm replacing Vernon.<eos> No one can replace Vernon.<eos> Yeah, you're right about that.<eos> But there is work to do.<eos> Uh, Lucious asked me to look into, uh, Anita Calhoun.<eos> Anika Calhoun.<eos> Anika, yeah.<eos> She doesn't work for Lyon Dynasty, right?<eos> Never did.
Just a million, huh?<eos> I must be slipping.<eos> Nah, you're keeping it firm, honey.<eos> I remember you making us all do laps around the yard, right?<eos> Correctional cardio, baby.<eos> You in the yard, keeping them all skinny.<eos> And you in the kitchen, keeping them thick.<eos> Baddest bitches on the block.<eos> Uh, why don't we go in the kitchen?<eos> How you doing?
May I be of service?<eos> What do you think of all this?<eos> The spectacle.<eos> The monarchy.<eos> I would appreciate your honest opinion.<eos> I'm happy to be employed in Your Majesty's home.<eos> But if I'm to be honest,<eos> I find some members of your household to be...<eos> Reprehensible.<eos> So do I.
Not yet.<eos> I would like to, one day.<eos> Children are wondrous.<eos> They change everything.<eos> What is your life like outside of these walls?<eos> - Do you have a good life?<eos> Mostly the classics.<eos> I just finished The Great Gatsby.<eos> "The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."<eos> How you doing, Rock Star?
- Guy, you wanted a welcome ear in the SA's office, well, Alicia is it.<eos> You like Taylor Swift?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Taylor Swift, you know, "Shake That Thing."<eos> Uh, what is it?<eos> - "Shake It Off." - "Shake It Off," right.<eos> "Shake It Off," I love that song.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do I?<eos> Uh, do I?
And Sam is going to believe that a senior FBI agent is a mole, with no evidence, based solely on the word of a man he knows for certain has broken the law?<eos> What makes you think he'll even hear you out?<eos> Alex.<eos> I need to talk to you, Sam.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.
What makes you think he'll even hear you out?<eos> Alex.<eos> I need to talk to you, Sam.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> Y-you do?
Yeah, i'll just... i'll sleep on the couch.<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you ever had your heart broken?<eos> Yeah,<eos> When my mom died.<eos> I'm so sorry. I didn't know.<eos> How'd you get through it?<eos> There's no magic bullet.<eos> You just...<eos> You do it...
Don't start a sentence that way.<eos> Fine.<eos> If Yates didn't do it, then how did he know that body was there?<eos> Your DA thinks I'm the one who did this.<eos> You know, I am the one who told you all about her.<eos> That's exactly why he thinks you did it.<eos> Is he always so circular in his reasoning?<eos> You told me that you were called to that house, that you knew a woman was there.<eos> Do you know who she was?<eos> I do.
I know how it sounds.<eos> I--I knew I needed to get upstairs, because... Because I--I-- I could hear her screaming.<eos> Larry, no!<eos> Larry, please, stop!<eos> No!<eos> No! No!<eos> No! No!<eos> Larry, please!<eos> No!<eos> Larry, no! Please don't!
Right up until... he was murdered last month.<eos> I recognized him when I saw the news.<eos> He came to see me after what happened to Patrick.<eos> And he questioned you?<eos> I didn't know he was a driver for the company. He said he was a reporter.<eos> He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
Oh, no.<eos> I'm the Rubicon.<eos> You simply need to determine which side of history you want to end up on.<eos> Who are you, Mr. Jasper?<eos> A subordinate who remained slavishly obedient to his master, or the presumptive leader of an organization that will be far more powerful than it has ever been?<eos> Diamond Drive Properties.<eos> Billy!<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> How you doing?
Oh, who's the guy?<eos> Me.<eos> I still can't believe it.<eos> Only you would get a job that just so happens to be across the hall from the elephant.<eos> I know! But I asked the elephant a hundred times and he said he was cool with it.<eos> So what am I supposed to do?<eos> I need a job.<eos> Well, on that note, take a seat.<eos> Sofia, I don't need one of your pep talks that's actually a lecture.<eos> But you do.
The terminology, Dad, it's not a "problem".<eos> Can we not minimize...<eos> Griff has an addiction - that he is powerless to fight.<eos> - I disagree.<eos> Dad, he's getting beaten up by drug dealers.<eos> That was a bar fight.<eos> It wasn't a bar fight, you already told Sandy...<eos> You see? He can't even remember what lies he told.<eos> - Griff, do you think you're powerless?<eos> - Of course he doesn't.
And God knows we've been down that road before.<eos> I know that the tail wags the dog, but these TV shows are in it for the ratings.<eos> We don't know that any of this even happened.<eos> (Carisi) Yeah, I'm all for overtime, but don't we have enough work to do?<eos> Guys, this isn't LMZ.<eos> It is a legitimate national news magazine.<eos> They interviewed her. She disclosed. And I got a call from Dodds, who got a call from the mayor.<eos> So we are going to investigate.<eos> (Rollins) We don't even know who this girl is.<eos> America's Worst Crimes does.
And now she goes on TV?<eos> Heather has wanted the business from Brian since rush week.<eos> He finally threw her a bone.<eos> Eight inches of it, brah.<eos> How do you know?<eos> You watch?<eos> (Brian) Heather wanted to stay and snuggle.<eos> But I was kind of done.<eos> So she just left?<eos> No, I did.
Yeah, that's right.<eos> I mean, you just--you watched.<eos> No, I wasn't even in the room with her.<eos> Okay?<eos> I swear.<eos> Well, today's your lucky day, because if you tell me who was in the room, you could walk.<eos> You called Cuba?<eos> It's not like I have pull there.<eos> Zach Franklin will be arrested when he returns to American soil.<eos> - If he does.
No, I meant what do you think'll happen to me?<eos> Don't know.<eos> It'll probably end up as a clip on YouTube.<eos> Three million hits that pissing boy got, I didn't see a penny of it.<eos> I'm sorry for spoiling your programme.<eos> Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> You were swearing too much anyway.<eos> ~ And that was before you murdered a dwarf.<eos> ~ I didn't murder him.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait!<eos> Come on, let's move! Come on, everybody out!<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Everybody out!<eos> Time's up! Let's go!<eos> Thomas Dewey organizes a citywide raid to find Lucky Luciano.<eos> He's not in here.<eos> Luciano escapes, but for Dewey, the raid isn't a total loss, as he brings in a prostitute who works in one of Luciano's brothels.<eos> So, how do you know Lucky Luciano?<eos> I don't.
Forgive me, Your Highness, but how on earth can you ensure that?<eos> I believe you know James Holloway.<eos> I do indeed.<eos> Well, rest assured, Mr. Holloway is very much in bed with us.<eos> The Duke of York and James Holloway?<eos> Strange bedfellows.<eos> Needless to say, you do your duty, we'll do ours.<eos> You can count on us, Your Highness.<eos> I knew you'd come to see things my way.<eos> People always do.
I didn't know he was gonna do that, man, you gotta believe me.<eos> This shit is wrong, man.<eos> Shane was my friend.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
PJ's not here to testify to state-of-mind.<eos> The guy who shot the video can.<eos> That's what Mr. Miller is doing here.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Is that why you're here, Josh?<eos> Why do we have to drag this out?<eos> Your son is talking to you.<eos> He's telling you what he wants.<eos> No, we don't know that he would say that today.<eos> I do.
Been a long day.<eos> But it just got better.<eos> Thanks for braving the storm.<eos> You said it was important.<eos> You know what I'm gonna do when this is all over with?<eos> When PJ wakes up.<eos> I'm gonna take you on a trip.<eos> Some place you've never been before. Uh-huh.<eos> Proper honeymoon.<eos> I do weekend getaways.
Look, look, you were right.<eos> That gun, it is going to protect you.<eos> It's going to protect me too.<eos> From my memory.<eos> You remember?<eos> Not the screams in the dark, not everything breaking, but when we spoke all night until the light came in with the Dominican music from the neighbors.<eos> Kissing in the cab, in the club.<eos> Telling me your dreams about tidal waves over the phone during finals.<eos> Cramped sex in a cramped dorm room with a burning hot pipe.<eos> I do."
I have followed the words of a false prophet.<eos> He said he was anointed.<eos> He said I...<eos> He said I was his Benaiah.<eos> Are you talking about Brother Pernell?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did whatever he told me to.<eos> I hurt people.<eos> I spilled the blood of an innocent man... men.<eos> And I did it all in the name of the Lord.
In a world where she was having an affair with our son.<eos> That world does not exist.<eos> PJ never even met her.<eos> Crys, I'm right about this.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Visions from God?<eos> Voices?<eos> In two days, we have to say goodbye to our son.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yes, yes, we do.
Clothes are 100-percent off.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - I know.<eos> Was she one of the ladies they hit on?<eos> I don't remember seeing her here last night.<eos> Okay, how long did these guys stick around?<eos> I closed their tab around 11.<eos> They were pretty wasted, so I called them a cab.<eos> Do you know how hard it is to get the smell of vomit out of pleather?<eos> - Thankfully, I do not.
There's more to it than that, Gino.<eos> But I can't tell you.<eos> Anna.<eos> You're playing into his hands.<eos> To worry, or wonder, that's what he wants.<eos> Even if it's true, and it's not, it's not our place.<eos> Gino...<eos> He's toying with you, bella.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> Yes, Anna, I do.
♪ If I show you that I know you ♪<eos> ♪ Won't tell what I said ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause two can keep a secret ♪<eos> ♪ If one of them is dead ♪<eos> You had no right to put yourself in that much danger.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> I did help.<eos> We saved them.<eos> You had no obligation.<eos> Yes, I did.
I know, the children miss me.<eos> Tell them their father is doing work here, important work.<eos> Let's tell them together. Hmm?<eos> Come home.<eos> What's going on, Vol?<eos> Why did you ride all the way up here?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> Vice Chancellor Voske sent you.<eos> She knows you've gone rogue.<eos> They all do.
- You're right. - Yeah.<eos> Um, Dad and Nora adopted the baby.<eos> They still calling it Lily?<eos> Yeah, you don't like that?<eos> Who cares what I like?<eos> I care.<eos> I mean, you gave her to us.<eos> Did you tell Dad?<eos> No.<eos> - Jill, did you?
I promise, she won't even see me.<eos> It'll be like I'm not even there.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing? Nothing.<eos> There was a...<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Jill's happy.<eos> - Did she take my letter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
I thought I was dreaming, but she was back.<eos> I said we should go to the hospital, but Mary, she just wanted to talk.<eos> The last thing she remembered was the accident, so I told her everything that happened since.<eos> We talked for hours.<eos> And we cried.<eos> Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.<eos> And when I woke up, she was like this again.<eos> For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened.<eos> Maybe they don't believe me.<eos> Maybe you don't.
There's been an incident.<eos> Your sister's been abducted.<eos> I should've been there.<eos> If I was there...<eos> If you trusted me instead of putting me through your tests, I could've stopped this.<eos> Or maybe you'd be captured and dead too.<eos> I know, to you, she's just an agent, but to me, she's my family.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Do you have a family?<eos> I did.
We have to stop her.<eos> I have to be ready for her next time.<eos> Show me how to fight.<eos> Train me to be as good as you.<eos> I'll make you even better.<eos> On Krypton, I remember Aunt Astra and my mother always arguing.<eos> Like sisters do.<eos> And when I asked my mother why they could never get along, she said that it was because Astra didn't have faith in people.<eos> You wanted to know if I have faith in you.<eos> I do.
God be with you.<eos> How do we do this?<eos> You just tell me you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> That should do it.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's gonna stop your heart.<eos> You said temporarily.<eos> That I did. That I did.
They're motivated by beliefs.<eos> And their targets embody a belief that enrages their would-be assassins.<eos> Why?<eos> Because secretly, they share that belief.<eos> John Wilkes Booth loved black people.<eos> Hated slavery.<eos> Hated it.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - I did not, Senator.<eos> Well, he did.
Told us Father wants the people of Mallory to live life with an open heart.<eos> We make mistakes, same as anyone, sure, but when we do, we confess.<eos> No secrets. No sins.<eos> As the leader of the town, it's my job to take the confessions of each and every person.<eos> Harper was reluctant to reveal her secrets.<eos> I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
Well, I'd bet on you.<eos> You know what? A lot has changed, but not that smile.<eos> So... what did you want?<eos> Um... surveillance camera caught a shot of your rebels when they escaped, and, uh, that's one of the crates the Agri-tower guys use to deliver food.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They left behind all their gear and guns, and they took this... why?<eos> What's in it?<eos> I don't think it's corn.<eos> Hey, my key... do you have it?<eos> Yes, I do.
We've got to go get Rachel, so we better get going.<eos> I'll be right up!<eos> Don't be long, sweetheart, okay?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Are you coming?<eos> We've got to get going.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> I'm happy that Rachel is taking you on this trip.<eos> You've had a rough year.<eos> - We all did.
Sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> He's the one I was telling you about.<eos> The one with the email.<eos> Show him the email.<eos> Please.<eos> He doesn't believe it's true.<eos> Just tell him you have it.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I do.
Sorry, you remember Anna, right?<eos> Girlfriend.<eos> I'm sorry to intrude. I just...<eos> You didn't return my calls, and I knew you hung out here, so...<eos> Wait, she called you?<eos> - It...<eos> - Just to offer my condolences.<eos> It's just so tragic and unexpected.<eos> Just, you know, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Well, suicide rarely does.
No, no, no, no hospitals.<eos> If you need help, I will help you.<eos> You just let her go? I...<eos> I thought we decided against it.<eos> Oh, we?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I remember you getting a phone call and walking out the door.<eos> Well, did... Did you at least try her cell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why don't you?
No, it's a bump key.<eos> Ok?<eos> And in a perfect world, they'd have a snap gun for this.<eos> Quick as nick, but this is Mexico.<eos> We gotta make do with what we got. Watch.<eos> Like this.<eos> It's all in the reflexes.<eos> Now you try.<eos> Did you at least see the safe?<eos> I did, yes.
- And we know why. If we don't, I gather we will soon.<eos> I'm afraid you see the new arrangement as diminishing your own importance.<eos> - What? - You're the king of this place.<eos> But once it's a wing of the Royal Yorkshire, you'll be one more local doctor.<eos> With some authority, yes.<eos> But it will not be the same.<eos> - Mrs Crawley doesn't mean that.<eos> - I'd like to think that. But it sounds very much as if she does.<eos> Did you drink at luncheon?<eos> No, I did not.
What was Mrs Hughes doing in there?<eos> Typical though, isn't it?<eos> 30 years of service, one wrong move, and... snap, you're out on your ear.<eos> They're very appreciative of our service. It was not a wrong move and she is not out on her ear.<eos> I won't speak ill of Her Ladyship.<eos> Not when she's doing what she's doing for Mr Mason.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Daisy. - You must talk when it isn't settled.<eos> - I want to get things settled.<eos> Don't we all?
I am not so sure about that.<eos> I'm not so sure about those shoes.<eos> I'm telling you, there is something off with this guy.<eos> We all know that you were against hiring a gay pastor.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> He didn't even seem to know what scripture was.<eos> Or maybe you're just looking for any excuse to find fault with him.<eos> Excuse me. Or maybe hiring someone sight unseen over the Internet was a bad idea.<eos> Do you wanna spend another year looking for a new pastor?<eos> Because I don't.
How do you know?<eos> New recruits.<eos> And there's ten times more than this outside.<eos> I know a born leader when I hear one.<eos> It's only the beginning.<eos> Michael!<eos> Please help!<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm okay!<eos> - Noma, who did this to you?
- I work nearby. - Nice.<eos> - What do you do?<eos> - Men. I'm gay, and I can tell you're hitting on me, which is really flattering.<eos> Believe me, I'd be all about you if I were into women. Uh-huh.<eos> Go away now.<eos> _<eos> Miss Hapstall, how often do you go to the Gladness Spa?<eos> Once a week.<eos> I've got a herniated disk.<eos> How we doing?
- We didn't cheat. - Well, good.<eos> Then this recount should put things right.<eos> You should have taken my money.<eos> 'Cause now you won't be SA.<eos> You are the chairman of Help America Vote, Mr. Nolan?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And you canvassed the touchscreen voting machines<eos> - in Cook County? - Yes.<eos> And did you find any more of these hacking devices, these "man in the middle" devices?<eos> - I did. - Forty.
Oh, okay.<eos> I mean, all I do all day is pay attention to--<eos> Positive attention.<eos> All right.<eos> How come I feel like I'm being called into your office?<eos> I missed you.<eos> He showed me the video he took from the roof.<eos> Jesus, that kid has got a world-class imagination. You know that.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> - I did.
The infected. But...<eos> Go on.<eos> There was a man shot like the others, like the rest, but he-- he wasn't sick.<eos> And there were others like that.<eos> When I was young, these men-- these men were from the government. They came to our town and they took some people away.<eos> And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
I mean, we've... we've explored every corner of this world. We've landed on the moon.<eos> Now we may be able to look beyond death.<eos> I understand the potential, but this is not the right way to find what you are looking for.<eos> I'm not shutting this down.<eos> Look, I want answers as much as you do. It's how you knew I would agree to do this in the first place, but I do not want to find out this way.<eos> It's not right.<eos> There may not be another way.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> We will keep looking. We have time.<eos> Maybe you do.
[Pills rattle] ... and that little light that you like to use on menus. All right?<eos> And, Louie, I am very much looking forward to last night's dinner.<eos> Oh, and, just for fun, I made sure that we will have a table outside on the terrace with a view of the city, you know, just in case our meal turns out to be, um, memorable... in some way.<eos> Patrice...<eos> You think you're ready for this... Dinner?<eos> I definitely am.<eos> I... if you still want to go.<eos> So... What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say...<eos> I do.
Maybe if I hadn't...<eos> Would you like some water?<eos> Why don't you let us get that for you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Gastric bypass was a pretty good cover story.<eos> Maggie could explain away the trip out of the country, any follow-up appointments, any pain or cramping.<eos> What if she really did book that surgery?<eos> Well, you looked at her pretty closely at the morgue.<eos> If she had had her stomach stapled, wouldn't you have noticed?<eos> She didn't.
DEA says you guys are running light on supply.<eos> Other cartels could smell blood in the water.<eos> It's pretty easy to see why you might be interested in a re-up.<eos> I suppose... if all that was true. And if I sold heroin, as opposed to running construction business.<eos> Come on.<eos> We didn't insult your intelligence.<eos> Don't insult ours.<eos> We're here because the smugglers killed a young woman named Maggie Halpern.<eos> Now, if any of their heroin winds up in your hands, the NYPD is gonna devote all of their resources to tying her murder to you, Janko.<eos> We done here? No.
Where's kalinda? She's not here.<eos> Well, I need to leave a message.<eos> Someone turned on bishop, and it was not me. She needs to tell bishop...<eos> It's not her either.<eos> What?<eos> Geneva pine approached me to turn evidence. Kalinda wasn't involved.<eos> It was me.<eos> It was you? How could it be you?<eos> I gave pine what I knew.<eos> You did?
Turn round.<eos> Okay.<eos> Put this on.<eos> Whoa, nice rack!<eos> Just give me the dress.<eos> Who is Beck?<eos> Beck was Robert's best friend.<eos> We basically grew up together.<eos> I may have lost my virginity to him.<eos> Alright, I did.
They want their Queen to be honest and raw and vulnerable.<eos> They want to see you as one of them.<eos> I'm the Queen of England.<eos> You are now, but once upon a time, you were simply a young girl who placed the duties of her family before her own heart's desire.<eos> Eventually, your heart got the better of you and you slipped.<eos> I was married to the King by then - and we had a son.<eos> The heart wants what it wants.<eos> But the marriage was arranged and you honored the pact like a dutiful daughter of England.<eos> The people won't accept the idea of an arranged marriage. They love the King.<eos> And so do you.
He's not like you.<eos> He never was... and he never will be.<eos> Your father doesn't have much time left.<eos> This is your time now.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Mum.<eos> I know Dad loved you, and I love you, too.<eos> And so does Cyrus.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Of course he does.
Jorge.<eos> I mean, he-he was a...<eos> he was a good friend.<eos> He knew Annie and I's story and... knew how desperate I was.<eos> So when you questioned him, he, uh... he asked me to come to his house.<eos> He-he asked me if I took the baby.<eos> And I just... I... I lost it.<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
You can't do that.<eos> You can't arrest us. I mean, we haven't even committed a crime.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> This guy here, Mr. Floppy, you are wanted in Illinois for crimes of video piracy, bestiality and perverting a minor animal.<eos> That copy of 50 Shades of Grey videotaped itself, I did not have sex with that cat and if I did, she told me she was 18!<eos> Yeah!<eos> And there is no extradition here!<eos> This is still the United States.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> Dude, I did...
Some ideas need a larger ecosystem.<eos> Give a buffalo a million acres, it thrives.<eos> Stick it on a desert island, in four generations,<eos> - it's the size of a poodle.<eos> - That's a charming anecdote, but I work for a living, so can we move this along, please?<eos> - We violated no copyrights.<eos> - We own proprietary algorithms...<eos> You were making it up as you went, at least admit it.<eos> - Connecting subscribers in discreet<eos> - The Source does a version of that...
Yes.<eos> Basel report ... Tomorrow.<eos> We have a hurry.<eos> Opera.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you!<eos> Shit ...<eos> Why did you make those kinds of sounds?<eos> It means "yes" in the north of Sweden.<eos> No, it does not.
Apologies.<eos> No apology necessary.<eos> You've been through a lot.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, so.<eos> So you do love me?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You do love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
Now!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Christopher.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What needs to be done, King.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
Thank God you're okay.<eos> What's wrong? I wanna make sure Sara doesn't hear us.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Well, I was, uh, on campus and I went by the photo studio and they said you hadn't come in.<eos> Then when I came home and you weren't here and you didn't pick up your phone, I panicked.<eos> I-I know, my phone died and I mixed up the dates at the studio, I..<eos> ...actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.<eos> But where were you?<eos> You told me you were going to The Brew.<eos> I did.
And it was all a lie.<eos> One big, disgusting lie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Would you be okay if your entire life you were told something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?<eos> I mean, they made me doubt myself. I've...<eos> I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
She's right.<eos> I do belong in therapy. But it's not what I wanna be doin' right now.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Simple things.<eos> Take a walk on the beach.<eos> Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.
Hey, dad.<eos> Uh, you remember Lorenzo?<eos> - Hey there.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Is this your idea of a replacement?<eos> 'Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop' you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?<eos> That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you. - He did.<eos> - Whoa, wait.<eos> - Who did?
I don't know.<eos> You don't know what?<eos> If it happened on purpose.<eos> I-I turned onto that street behind the school and I felt like I was being followed.<eos> By who?<eos> There was this dark car, it was going real slow.<eos> Did the car hit you?<eos> It suddenly sped up, and... the side mirror smashed into my elbow and...<eos> I-I have to clean this up before your mom sees it.<eos> No, you don't.
Hey, maybe we should swing by Wallaby Avenue.<eos> I heard there's some activity goin' on over there.<eos> Break-ins. - In Sherwood?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It's not exactly our jurisdiction.<eos> Yeah, but there's nothing going on here tonight.<eos> Those guys could use our help, anyway.<eos> Hey, come on, the car's over here.<eos> Yeah, and we gotta let Command know we're goin'.<eos> No, we don't.
What?<eos> Can we start again?<eos> Um, I'm Jason.<eos> Jason DiLaurentis.<eos> 'Next, please.'<eos> Do you even go to school here?<eos> No.<eos> But I bet I'll be the prettiest girl in the yearbook.<eos> You didn't tell me your name. You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Are you scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Okay, the results are in.<eos> And?<eos> - It doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What doesn't?<eos> Barmal designed her serum to block the virus from entering human blood cells.<eos> - So where did she go wrong?<eos> - She didn't.
- I'm afraid I'm going to have to go.<eos> I haven't finished explaining the protocol if your voice is recognised.<eos> Then you can admit to recognising theirs?<eos> That's correct.<eos> - Same time next week?<eos> The shift doesn't end for another 15 minutes.<eos> My husband isn't well and he'll worry if I'm not home by quarter past.<eos> Well, um... I suppose that'll have to be enough for today.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you worked here, Mrs Simms.<eos> - She doesn't yet.
Or your Leah.<eos> At least I have the heroin to keep me company.<eos> Um... Just kidding. It's not heroin.<eos> It's just the shots I have to take a few days Before my big stem cell donation.<eos> - Are you scared?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Dr. Hamburg asked me If I wanted updates on how it goes with the recipient.<eos> I mean, I want to know if things go well.<eos> - But...<eos> - If it doesn't?
I can scratch off number fifteen off my list.<eos> "She would regret never getting"...<eos> April Carver got fired from a job?<eos> I'm trying something new.<eos> I love it.<eos> Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.<eos> But neither do you.
What's going on?<eos> You've been set up.<eos> The Cabal's been asking about you, Lizzy.<eos> They know who your mother was.<eos> You've been set up.<eos> You were there when the Orea building was bombed.<eos> They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins.<eos> They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.<eos> I don't have the virus.<eos> You do, Lizzy.
F-F-Funny.<eos> I don't normally talk about it, but... .. there's something not right with my heart.<eos> A bit like you.<eos> So it doesn't stop me having fun.<eos> But it rather puts a damper on, well, falling in love.<eos> That's making a promise that you'll be there for someone. A promise I can't be sure of keeping.<eos> Best not to get into that sort of situation. I've always felt it better all round.<eos> - Come on. - What?<eos> Out there?<eos> Neither of us did very well out of our inheritance, did we?
- It's Jimmy.<eos> Strasburg loved my book.<eos> Great.<eos> So you're taking the job?<eos> Hell no.<eos> I, Jimmy Shive-Overly, will not be some has-been's lackey.<eos> That'd be like Thomas Keller making the donkey sauce for Guy Fieri's taco burgers.<eos> No, I'm gonna write a new novel, for I am a writer.<eos> So you don't need the extra work?<eos> Well, of course I do.
She didn't tell you about my clever speech?<eos> Now, I'm gonna go hit up that girl with the booty jorts over there.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Mmm.<eos> She looks hydrated as hell!<eos> Yeah.<eos> ...and, honestly, I was thinking about postponing the whole trip.<eos> The Nepalese government just put all these restrictions on Everest because of the whole human waste pollution.<eos> Talk about a pile of shit, right?<eos> Well, that's the problem, Gretchen.<eos> No one does.
You made a good impression when you went into York.<eos> I don't understand. What about Mama?<eos> Lady Grantham is to be, and I quote,<eos> "Allowed to step down after so many years of noble service."<eos> Golly.<eos> They've sacked the Captain.<eos> You can see their point.<eos> How could they have someone in the management of the new system who thinks the whole idea is a horrible mistake?<eos> - And you support this notion?<eos> - Of course he does.
He is my officer, and I should follow his lead.<eos> - And it won't make you grumpy?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> What's next?<eos> - Duck.<eos> - Oh. Is the skin crispy like Mrs Patmore does it?<eos> Did you ask her advice?<eos> We certainly talked about what it's like to cook dinner for you.<eos> - Ah, I bet she had a lot to say.<eos> - We both did.
Uh... tomorrow?<eos> Sunday.<eos> Your first service.<eos> Right, yeah, of course.<eos> - Hey, Thanks, Alden.<eos> - Yes, I trust that you will give us a service that will uphold the dignified standards of your predecessor.<eos> You don't have any of those services on video, do you?<eos> 'Cause I'd kinda like to see how it's done.<eos> I mean... how it used to be done.<eos> Uh... uh... no, I don't.
Somalia.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> We'll know more when we track down that Chuck Norris look-alike.<eos> How do you plan on doing that?<eos> That military skull tattoo I told you about.<eos> That could help ID him, right?<eos> We'll see what we can find out.<eos> But it's a long shot at best.<eos> I know this seems impossible.<eos> A lot of our cases do at first.
I never understood why she wasn't angry.<eos> She would have had every right to be.<eos> But she wasn't.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She was a Rashid and I was an Al Fayeed.<eos> Even before it started, our relationship was impossible.<eos> We tried to run away together, like in the movies. To leave Abuddin for good.<eos> I bribed a merchant marine from Mumbai to let us stow away.<eos> We were supposed to meet him at a café, but he never showed up.<eos> My father did, though.
(Laughs) I don't know about that.<eos> -I'm certainly not a teacher.<eos> -Well, I saw you at that tango class.<eos> Maybe you could just teach him, like, a little box step or something?<eos> Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you come by tomorrow night?<eos> Done, thank you.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Not as much as I do.
So what?<eos> You can still tell me your problems. Why?<eos> So you can try to fix me, like you always do.<eos> I don't try to fix you.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> When dad died, you moved back home to take care of us.<eos> When I started getting into trouble after that, you helped mom find Charton.<eos> When mom pulled me out of honor, you asked me to be your maid of honor.<eos> I thought you'd like that.<eos> I do, but...
I...<eos> I can't go to the conference.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I am.<eos> I... I have just too much going on at home right now for me to even consider planning a trip away. So...<eos> I hope you understand.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I do.
I've been looking all over for you.<eos> You know, you could have made it a little easier on me, all right?<eos> I am on crutches.<eos> So I don't...<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What do you mean, you're not gay?<eos> Do you not like me?<eos> No, of course I like you.<eos> Do you not like me like that?<eos> No, I do.
All those computer wires stuffed into one outlet, they yours?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You got to be more careful.<eos> I use a power strip.<eos> I cut it off, I swear to God, I did.<eos> He doesn't know for sure that's what started it.<eos> You got to keep the faith, Billy.<eos> The truth comes out.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Victoria, I went to visit her in Chicago Med.<eos> Yeah?<eos> When I got there, the cops started questioning me.<eos> They're taking my fingerprints, swabbing the inside of my mouth, like it's my fault or something.<eos> Well, was it?<eos> No, man, no.<eos> I always turn the power strip off when I'm not using it, I swear to God.<eos> You still believe me, right?<eos> You said you did.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I know she is!<eos> Billy, look at me.<eos> I pulled you out of the fire.<eos> The least you can do is listen to what I have to say.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Listen, Victoria was raped, so whoever set that fire was trying to kill her.<eos> That wasn't me, I swear, I swear...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So do the police.<eos> They do?
Do it.<eos> I'm gonna take care of the bitch Margaux paid to do this.<eos> Nolan, you can't.<eos> She's dangerous.<eos> So am I.<eos> I trained for four years with the most dangerous sensei I know.<eos> I can handle her.<eos> We still have to find Victoria.<eos> We don't know where she's hiding.<eos> I do.
He was ruled out by an alibi.<eos> I see, and that alibi was confirmed, not by you, but by the Intelligence Unit of the Chicago police, isn't that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> A unit of the Chicago police that includes Detective Jay Halstead, who just happens to be the brother of Dr. Will Halstead.<eos> Yes.<eos> The suspect's brother conveniently cleared your prime suspect, and you let him go on his merry way while looking for someone else to charge with murder.<eos> Dr. Halstead was cleared because he didn't do it.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Did you ask him where he was at the time Nadia Decotis went missing?<eos> No, we did not.
That hurts!<eos> - That's right.<eos> Silent and terrible, like The Artist.<eos> I watch a lot of TV and movies.<eos> I am your media-savvy worst nightmare!<eos> Now, down on all fours like the rest of them!<eos> That's right, we got ways to break your spirit!<eos> In fact, you seem like a prime candidate for The Chair.<eos> Honey, did you hear a dog scream?<eos> Yes, I did, dear.
Yeah, well I'm past all that.<eos> You're not past all that.<eos> I can't imagine how you've managed to deal with everything you've had to...<eos> Well, then don't try.<eos> I'm just saying nicely, and we're good and I want us to work, but it's not enough to just say you're past it.<eos> You still have a lot of anger in you.<eos> You need to deal with a few things directly.<eos> What, like therapy?<eos> Well, if that feels right.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
You just said you surveilled them.<eos> Because I feared that they might not approve of our methods, not because I thought they were inherently evil.<eos> I know they go after bad cops, but you know they jam up a lot of good ones.<eos> Do you fear this to be the case with Marcus, that he's being jammed?<eos> If you're asking me if I think she's a honey trap-- no, I don't.<eos> I think they really like each other, but think about it.<eos> What if he does something small, like help fix another cop's mistake and then tells her about it?<eos> Isn't it her job to bring things like this to her boss?<eos> You know, I'll call him tomorrow, and if he knows about it, I'll just tell him we'll keep it between us.<eos> And if he doesn't?
The hell she isn't.<eos> She was the only other person out here when this thing happened.<eos> And as far as Watson and I have been able to discern, utterly devoid of any motive-- unlike the soulless corporate golem that is AgriNext.<eos> You think a company did this?<eos> It wouldn't be the first time they'd harbored a killer.<eos> He's right-- we found one there a few months ago.<eos> So what makes you think they did this?<eos> Elevated levels of Colony Collapse Disorder along the Northeast.<eos> You putting that on AgriNext, too?<eos> Everett Keck did.
No, no. No, my sister. Her kids.<eos> We found out too late, Mr. Frink.<eos> But you are free to go.<eos> No, no, no. I-<eos> - I'm free to go?<eos> I am free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough, and I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Who named him that?<eos> Jimmy Olsen.<eos> So, who is this guy really?<eos> - Unknown.<eos> He remains at large after a string of very public fights with your cousin.<eos> Neither of them ever came out on top.<eos> And no one knows why he's so obsessed with killing Superman.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> We don't.
I've already decided.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Maui's put the word out on that, too.<eos> If Dries sells you any more tavi, he'll be strung up by his balls.<eos> There's no way you can get some.<eos> Not from anyone.<eos> And thank Christ for that, if this is what it does to you.<eos> You could always steal it.<eos> I'm just saying. If you wanted to.<eos> He doesn't!
Painkillers?<eos> Morphine at the hospital brought on visions before.<eos> That was totally unpredictable.<eos> Unless you guys have a bunch of LSD lying around, I...<eos> Figure it out.<eos> We need answers.<eos> Chief, a handful of officers were dispatched to the edge of the town to deal with a situation.<eos> Do any of the officers know about the troubles?<eos> No.<eos> Not many do.
Come on, Gretl, up.<eos> I'm Caroline Koch.<eos> I'm Dr. Sacani.<eos> This is Divya.<eos> You said it was an emergency?<eos> My tongue died.<eos> Oh, uh, is it feeling numb or painful?<eos> So much worse than that.<eos> And the scariest thing is I know why it happened.<eos> Oh, you do?
Wow.<eos> Post breakup?<eos> Dated for three years, engaged for another.<eos> A month before the wedding, I found tapes.<eos> Tapes?<eos> Like VHS?<eos> Yup.<eos> A collection of all the men and women she'd ever been with up to and including the time that we were together.<eos> Who even has a VCR?<eos> She does.
You know? I think I will have the lobster.<eos> You got Benadryl, right?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Carl can't back out now. There are things in motion.<eos> What's in motion?<eos> You know, things.<eos> Oh. Did you tell Victoria?<eos> No.<eos> Molly.<eos> Of course I did.
Oh, here comes the spinout.<eos> Hold on a second. Let's say<eos> I did ask you to marry me.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> But if I did. Would you have said yes?<eos> That's like asking, if a chicken laid an egg in the forest, would you hear it?<eos> I guess it was a good thing I didn't ruin your life by offering to love and cherish you till death do us part.<eos> What are you getting so mad about?<eos> You didn't want to marry me, either.<eos> No, I did. And then I didn't.
Rock, paper, scissors.<eos> Stick with the paper, kid.<eos> They never see it coming.<eos> Got a few more security cameras going.<eos> Perimeter looks good.<eos> We... I think we might need to talk about something. Ah.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Croatoan's offer has to be a little... tempting.<eos> You're asking me if I want all this to be over, live behind some white picket fence, adopt a shelter dog?<eos> Of course I do.
Now why would I do that?<eos> Well, Franky's a smart woman and I want to help her, but to do that I need to give her hope for a potential future away from here.<eos> Do you know plenty of people have tried to help Franky?<eos> They have all failed.<eos> Governor's expecting me.<eos> Well, she just needs the right mentor.<eos> You know, self-belief can mean the difference between success and failure.<eos> I have to run it by the Governor.<eos> I would have thought she'd allow you some autonomy.<eos> Of course she does.
Do you two know each other?<eos> We met yesterday.<eos> Several times, in fact.<eos> Good to see you again, Dr. Reid.<eos> I have heard wonderful things about this young man.<eos> I've invited him to observe.<eos> If you don't mind, Dr. Reid.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I've finished scrubbing. You can take my place.<eos> Almost done, Mr. Powell.
If you don't mind, Dr. Reid.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I've finished scrubbing. You can take my place.<eos> Almost done, Mr. Powell.<eos> Not too uncomfortable, I hope?<eos> Mnh. Barely feel it.<eos> Having your leg crushed by a forklift must really make pain relative. Yeah.<eos> Interesting fact... a major pain receptor in the lower leg is called the saphenous nerve, derived from the arabic word "safin,"<eos> meaning hidden or concealed, but that's actually in reference to the saphenous vein, which was kind of hidden, at least if you were practicing medicine in the middle ages.<eos> Almost done, Mr. Powell.
Well, that's your way of saying you have no plans.<eos> It's not good for you to spend all day moping around.<eos> Can I please just counsel myself through my own problems?<eos> Stop babying me.<eos> And don't look at each other!<eos> You always side with each other!<eos> I can't stand it!<eos> - (Door slams) - Told you.<eos> Yep.<eos> You did.
Are you trying to threaten me?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because you're trying to intimidate me and I don't like it.<eos> I don't respect it.<eos> I'm bored, Gidget.<eos> I'm sick of everyone and I'm sick of myself.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> I know.<eos> I told you, I didn't take it.<eos> Yeah, well, then who did, huh?
'You know, I saw into her soul.<eos> It's just black.<eos> 'It's darkness.'<eos> And then I could see into her mind.<eos> I could see the horror.<eos> I knew she was a freak, but I didn't think she'd go this far.<eos> She's fuckin' demented.<eos> You believe me, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
When you came in here with me, I just saw it as a bit of a second chance for us.<eos> For me.<eos> To be the mum I never was to you.<eos> As a kid, I'd come from school every day praying you weren't drunk. Oh, God.<eos> Sophie...<eos> I'd walk through the front door and see you, and when you hadn't had a drink,<eos> God,<eos> I'd be so happy.<eos> But I knew it wasn't going to last.<eos> And it never did.
I don't understand why you're talking to me like this.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Do you know who this is?<eos> No!<eos> Governor, have I... have I done something wrong?<eos> Well, I don't know, Mr Fletcher.<eos> Just... just... just get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> I must have missed the order for the cell toss.<eos> You didn't.
You ever had a premonition, Liz?<eos> - I'm never getting out of here alive.<eos> - I fucked up, Bea. The police have me on CCTV getting rid of the splitter head.<eos> If they find that, they're gonna arrest me.<eos> The man who attacked me is the guy who tried to kill Fletch. In here is his DNA.<eos> His name, Bea.<eos> I need to know his name.<eos> I need you to find out who he is.<eos> I'll find the bastard.<eos> And when I do...
Well, what about breakfast?<eos> I had mine already.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, you always make me breakfast.<eos> Yeah, well, I was thinking about what you said.<eos> What did I say?<eos> I do too much.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> Yep!<eos> You did.
I am serious!<eos> It's an abuse of court.<eos> Well, you can block all extraneous motions.<eos> I thought about that, but then I realized there's something missing.<eos> A motion?<eos> A witness.<eos> Nice job, Sherlock.<eos> This was left for you at the front.<eos> Oh, you order in?<eos> No, I didn't.
Eat it, Cinnabon.<eos> Pear tart and a coffee.<eos> Come on, I'm on a clock here.<eos> Who had the damn pear tart and a coffee?<eos> Max, hurry!<eos> Five minutes, in and out!<eos> Yeah, the one thing you don't have to explain to me is "in and out."<eos> I need help!<eos> I never said I was fast.<eos> All my high school guidance counselors did, but I did not.
You know, the first half hour, it's just a gripe session about the neighbors.<eos> And then I got to sit there while she checks the dog for tumors. Then she checks herself.<eos> And then she asks me to check her.<eos> Welcome to the first 18 years of my life.<eos> It's just so frustrating.<eos> Oh, I mean, you signed on for this.<eos> But you're almost done, so just suck it up.<eos> "Suck it up"?<eos> Well, you wanted my advice.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Carol, there's no one anywhere anymore.<eos> - That's not exactly true.<eos> Okay, what... what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing, it's just nothing.<eos> Tucson?<eos> Are you talking about Tucson?<eos> Just saying that's where there are other people, Phil.<eos> Carol, the only place I can't go is Tucson.<eos> I mean, do you not remember me getting, like, tackled, driven out into the desert and left there for dead?<eos> - Yes, I do, I... - No, no, no.
Don't just stand there!<eos> We're in "f." Find "first aid."<eos> Oh, you moron!<eos> While my dad was feeling the pain of my blade, miss Cinoman was gone, and to coach, that was as stab in the heart.<eos> Hustle up, Goldberg!<eos> Pick up the pace!<eos> Coach, are you crying?<eos> You only get one cry in life, son, and this ain't it.<eos> Now run till your heart explodes,<eos> 'Cause...mine just did.
Come on, live it up!<eos> So, tell me what's going on?<eos> Are you enjoying a hunk of Fisher pie?<eos> Oh, is this girl talk? Is that what this is?<eos> Look, I know he's Fisher-licious, but...<eos> Liam's been gone less than a week.<eos> The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and Fisher.<eos> Huh. Okay, well, if you want my opinion on turning Liam down...<eos> I don't.
Because she's in there you wanna pull the plug?<eos> No way.<eos> I can do this.<eos> He's yelling at someone in a car.<eos> I can't make out who.<eos> Make and model?<eos> A license plate number? We're past the point of no return.<eos> Um, black sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.
Well, I'm gonna have this conversation with Drew later.<eos> I don't need to have it with you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You're seeing him'?<eos> Yeah, parent-teacher conference. Oh.<eos> Will I see you before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon, so...<eos> What's Wrong with my house?<eos> You knew we weren't gonna live here forever.<eos> I do now.
So you're, uh-- you're new around here?<eos> Did you kill that bed sheet yourself or what?<eos> It's all I ever want.<eos> Meat, meat, meat.<eos> Robert says it's the iron. - Mm.<eos> - What about you, Abby? Any cravings?<eos> Oh, it's usually just whatever they're out of at the commissary.<eos> Oh, the commissary's a disaster.<eos> You should see the shopping list I foist on Robert when he's traveling.<eos> You do a lot of traveling, don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?
Go ahead, hon.<eos> I think it's going pretty well.<eos> I know.<eos> Isn't it weird how right this feels?<eos> - Please take your hand off my thigh. - Uh-huh.<eos> Well, this is definitely not the weekend I was expecting.<eos> Well, I guess we shouldn't be completely surprised.<eos> His voice mail was sung to the tune of Candle in the Wind.<eos> [sighs] The main thing is he seems happy.<eos> He really does.
So your daughter goes to Highbrook? Isobel.<eos> Yeah, she just started.<eos> Me and her dad broke up middle of last year, so...<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, we just thought Isobel might like a new start, so...<eos> Oh, and the homework club is a blessing!<eos> I can do the whole day, finish off, lock up and be here at 5.30 to pick her up myself.<eos> I'm so sorry I didn't recognise you.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> No-one does anymore.
And if Sid really was in danger, why didn't he call security?<eos> Well, we may find some answers in that alley.<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> Okay, Castle and I are gonna scrub traffic cams. Maybe we'll find the shooter there.<eos> Anything yet?<eos> No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?
Who sent these?<eos> These texts came from your phone.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Is there anyone else who has access to your phone? No...<eos> I mean, sometimes Owen plays games on it.<eos> Oh, so Owen arranged his own kidnapping, right?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I left my phone at a yoga studio.<eos> Maybe somebody did it from there.
Mom, Dad.<eos> What? Am I a choad juggler?<eos> (Kevin and Jenny snicker) No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> No. You're not because it... they don't exist.<eos> Although Andre could juggle 'em, if anyone could.<eos> He's very deft with his hands.<eos> Stop it. Does the bullying stop when you grow up?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.
I see no problem with that. Just wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> (gasps) Oh. "There's sex between a man and woman."<eos> Did you do this?<eos> No. Taco did this.<eos> Is that me?<eos> No, I think that's the big-boned lass from the bus.<eos> PAM: This is unacceptable.<eos> Ellie has a very vivid imagination.<eos> Actually, she does not.
Why was the computer stressed out when it got home?<eos> 'Cause it had a hard drive.<eos> Bam!<eos> Well, this thing's obviously broken.<eos> Hi.<eos> Gabi, it's been three days.<eos> Why is the blender still here?<eos> Well, remember when you said that if I could figure out a way to pay for the blender without using our rent money, I could keep it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, I did it!
What do you mean?<eos> Well, I received the invitation and couldn't help but notice that Dr. Barnes is in the program, and you're in the program, too.<eos> Look at that, I am.<eos> Why didn't you tell me it was your speech?<eos> I wanted your honest opinion.<eos> But you didn't ask my opinion. You asked me to check it for exposure.<eos> If there's one thing I've noticed about you, it's that you give your opinion whether it's asked for or not.<eos> And why does my opinion matter to you so much that you would go through all this?<eos> Your opinion doesn't matter to me.<eos> Your development does.
Here we go. - Missing the show.<eos> Good, good. Here we go.<eos> Huh? Smile.<eos> Smiles, please.<eos> Dresses are a nice touch.<eos> Should charge more for that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at that.<eos> That is a peach right there.<eos> Hey, how they doing?
How 'bout after we take out that kneecap and this kneecap, you can try to gimp up I-40...<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Lovely.<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> - My problem?<eos> - I just saved your ass.<eos> - He was about to tell me everything!<eos> Where the hell are you goin' now?<eos> - I don't need your help. - Yeah?<eos> Well, Uncle Eddie did.
Why didn't you look at your husband's penis more?<eos> Because he's too busy plunging it into a 22 year-old grad student who he... apparently is also his cycling buddy.<eos> Oh, how did I know that?<eos> Because my mother called him and asked him.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - You didn't Want to know.<eos> No, I did not want to know.<eos> No.<eos> No, and now I do.
You two are my redheaded pillars of unconditional love.<eos> To my friends at the 12th precinct... You let me in.<eos> Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.<eos> You've made me your brother-in-arms, and I thank you for that.<eos> And Kate.<eos> Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.<eos> And then you walked through the door.<eos> And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right... you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.
- When are you coming?<eos> - Tomorrow morning.<eos> - Are you both okay?<eos> - Yeah, we're fine.<eos> You know where to meet me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... did you... did you...<eos> Did you talk to them?<eos> - My family?<eos> - Of course I did.
- successfully.<eos> Well, my BMI was a little high.<eos> You want me to do this report, don't you?<eos> If I don't do this report, what will happen?<eos> - I'll lose my job.<eos> - And then what?<eos> I'll drink a lot of whisky.<eos> And then what?<eos> Do you know Marcus McDonald well?<eos> Yes, you do.
"Traumatic grief within normal range."<eos> "No other psychiatric disorder indicated."<eos> "Recommendation - six sessions" "to be increased to 12"<eos> "at the discretion of the psychiatrist in charge."<eos> A copy will be forwarded to all the relevant parties.<eos> You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
How would you describe it?<eos> I couldn't say.<eos> You couldn't say.<eos> You probably spend so much time in here, you don't notice.<eos> The old books.<eos> They got the stink of their owner.<eos> Cigarettes and coffee, cat piss, smell of decay.<eos> I'm looking for a friend of mine who was supposed to meet me this morning.<eos> You seen him?<eos> Y-Yeah, I did a couple days ago.
George and I fell in love while he was married to someone else.<eos> She refused to grant him a divorce, so we took the only course open to us and... presented ourselves as Mr. and Mrs. Scotlock.<eos> I still do.<eos> They don't know?<eos> We all have secrets.<eos> Then... and now.<eos> You've become a friend.<eos> And I haven't had many of those over the years.<eos> I enjoy your companionship.<eos> As does Boris.
I dropped my fork.<eos> Oh, no, that's okay, Garfield.<eos> I'd like Chair to do it.<eos> You're going to regret this.<eos> Oops! I dropped my fork, too.<eos> Chair, stop making me drop things!<eos> Oh, I would like an oyster, please. Hmm.<eos> Actually, I changed my mind.<eos> I don't want an oyster.<eos> Oh, I do.
Hey, Arnold, this is Alex. Alex, this is Arnold.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - DiGiorno.<eos> Uh, Alex is here buying some gifts for her baby.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What's the name of that cutie?<eos> Lucien.<eos> Lucien?<eos> You named your baby Lucien?<eos> I did. Yes.
I'm listening.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Imagine a mirrored lake, a tall tree with low-hanging branches that loom over it.<eos> Above it, a beautiful blue sky.<eos> Now, picture it in your mind's eye.<eos> Picture it clearly.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm picturing it...<eos> What? I said don't use magic!<eos> I didn't, deary.
It's like, ooh, ah, ooh, ay, ooh.<eos> Okay, well, somebody has to pay for those clothes... and I think it's you.<eos> All right.<eos> Text Lupe I'll go down on her.<eos> Hi.<eos> Dude, what are you doing?<eos> Just making sure everything's going all right.<eos> You can't make silly faces.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I was doing a good job.<eos> -You're doing great.
"What would it have been like if I went to Japan?"<eos> I always play it safe, and I can't do it anymore.<eos> The time in our life to do crazy shit is winding down, and I don't want to wake up one day and see that the window is already closed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Really, really sorry.<eos> Dude, I can't believe they cut both of us out of the movie entirely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That happened to me on The Cookout 3.<eos> The whole subplot of me beating Marquise at the pie-eating contest got scrapped.<eos> So how you doing?
It'll make Goldman sharpen their pencils a little more.<eos> Show Hap and Lacey the projections.<eos> Oh, this is the foreman out at the site.<eos> Excuse me one second.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is this a bad time?<eos> Well, it was, and then you called.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I need to know if you meant what you said today.<eos> I did, and I do.
Hey, baby, it's me.<eos> You're doing great. The baby's doing great.<eos> Hi.<eos> I guess I got my house party, just not in the house.<eos> We're gonna find the monster that did this to you.<eos> - Did you get a look at him?<eos> - Not right now, Hap.<eos> No, no, it's okay.<eos> Cody, did you see him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
As much as I'm enjoying our little visit...<eos> I am kind of wondering why you're here.<eos> Does he love you?<eos> Who?<eos> My husband.<eos> Carla, I've got no idea - what you're going on about.<eos> - Jules, I saw you at the hospital.<eos> I know how Hap looks at something he thinks belongs to him.<eos> So does he love you?<eos> He did.
Hey.<eos> Can I speak to my mother?<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> Wick!<eos> Hi.<eos> Dad knows.<eos> I had it out with him.<eos> We're done.<eos> So if your offer still stands, I'm in.<eos> Well, of course it does.
I'm sorry.<eos> But you... you need a new plan, a better plan, a much better plan than me.<eos> Well, she didn't waste any time, did she?<eos> I'm sorry? - Olivia Pope is in the White House, which means she's in the president's bed, which means she's up in our business.<eos> Go ahead, play dumb.<eos> Protect your friend.<eos> I just witnessed a lovers' quarrel in the oval office.<eos> And keeping a secret like that is not gonna work for me.<eos> Honestly, I had no idea.<eos> Well, now you do.
He is here with me, in the place that we built together.<eos> I can't leave him, and I can't leave Vega.<eos> Take this. Hurry up!<eos> They're coming!<eos> We were good together.<eos> - We were trouble. - Go on!<eos> Six bullets, just what I left William.<eos> I should've died.<eos> I should've died, not her.<eos> Well, you didn't for a reason.
So, it doesn't mean you can't still go get Mexican.<eos> And so I'm supposed to just eat a bunch of fucking tacos in front of you, Nate?<eos> No, we're supposed to go together.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was the plan. We'll go.<eos> We'll go get Mexican.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - You don't want to.<eos> It's...<eos> I do.
- Okay.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Dick.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Hey, bud.<eos> Hey.<eos> D-did you win your fight?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Thank you for your time.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I paged you. I called you. You didn't answer.<eos> Yeah, how about next time you page me before you have me arrested?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I didn't know you were gonna be there. - I've been grooming bucket for a year.<eos> - I know. And I'm this close to getting to his boss.<eos> You could've jeopardized my whole case.<eos> But I-I didn't.<eos> I didn't jeopar...
I want to hear it from you.<eos> If I do this, we go back to the arcade, discuss the plan with the rest of 'em?<eos> I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> We were close. Very close. He was my best friend.<eos> He worked at Evil Corp his whole life.<eos> He was one of the best computer engineers they had.<eos> Then, out of the blue, he got fired. No one knew why.<eos> One day, he told me. He had leukemia.<eos> Made me swear to never tell anyone, especially my mom.<eos> So, I didn't.
- Not at all.<eos> Nothing wrong with being a hobbit.<eos> They think that you're a spaceship pilot!<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> Better than reality.<eos> Damn.<eos> If you're not comfortable with fan interactions... - Why are you going to a fan convention?<eos> - No, I... Love the fans, I do.<eos> I love them.<eos> I do, I do.

You know where it's at?<eos> Your mind's on winning, son!<eos> Get up. Turn around.<eos> Loose. Keep these loose, loose, loose, loose.<eos> I can't believe you didn't give me nate's first fight back.<eos> You didn't have a spot for him.<eos> I was working on it. Really?<eos> 'Cause it kind of seemed like you were slow-playing us.<eos> To see if he was healthy. Is that what you think?<eos> Yeah. I do.
It's the only place I can come to relax.<eos> I know exactly what you're saying, man.<eos> I was never housebroken myself.<eos> Misha could never get that.<eos> "He who makes a beast of himself... Gets rid of the pain of being a man."<eos> There's no way you fucking made that up.<eos> Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> Ah, Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> That guy knows some shit.<eos> Did.
Which suggests the CIA already has Kirkin under electronic surveillance.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'll contact Sabatino... again.<eos> This is what we have on Kirkin.<eos> He's a crook, yes, but not someone we consider a terrorist threat in the bigger scheme of things.<eos> His ideology is, uh, based on one thing: money and lots of it.<eos> He does, however, have ties to the gangs in Russia, which is what I think Callen was looking for.<eos> Uh, guys.<eos> You find him, Eric?<eos> No, but LAPD did.
You two are just adorable.<eos> So? What do you think, Sherlock?<eos> Well, it's ultimately for the experts to decide, but the original painting was stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.<eos> It's crazy how art has become a favorite currency of drug dealers and terrorists.<eos> Yeah. No wonder.<eos> If this painting is original, it's worth over $200 million.<eos> Wow. So... Yeah.<eos> Just... be careful.<eos> Looks like I owe you an apology.<eos> No, you don't.
Hey, wanna dance?<eos> Oh, no, gracias.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> When in Rome...<eos> It's my boyfriend.<eos> I'd better answer.<eos> Saved by the cell.<eos> Thanks for the pep talk.<eos> I hope it helped.<eos> It did.
Every single time we go away from each other, it feels like someone took half of my heart and like, removed it.<eos> And when this other half of my heart is somewhere, it's in New York City right now, it's like I can always feel him with me, he's just not with me.<eos> How is Evanston?<eos> Good, you're happy.<eos> Yes, I mean, like happier than I thought I'd be.<eos> We're gonna look at a venue. - Good.<eos> - And then, you know,<eos> DJ, flowers, food and then get married.<eos> I found this photo booth I want.<eos> Classic, of course you did.
Gillette.<eos> Not cheap.<eos> Perhaps she bought it for him.<eos> He doesn't rinse properly.<eos> Huh? It blunts quicker.<eos> They denied all knowledge of him?<eos> There's no formal employment records at Cristal Kebabs.<eos> Most of it's cash in hand work.<eos> In fact, we're making assumptions he even worked there.<eos> He did.
There are guards all around outside.<eos> Can we please just finish and get out?<eos> Is that all right with you, Tommy?<eos> It's clear.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> _<eos> I'm a very busy man, Thomas Graham Connor. Tommy.<eos> Call me Tommy.<eos> How you doing?
I'm pretty sure if I had you'd think I was a moron, that I hadn't listened to anything you taught me in this business.<eos> "The Biggest Auction Of the Decade" line?<eos> That's for the press.<eos> You know that.<eos> You know it better than anyone.<eos> If you sign, then I can have the contract in front of us in about 20 seconds.<eos> I promise you will not be disappointed.<eos> I'm already disappointed.<eos> Look uh... if you want to just keep this, the client-account executive situation, that's... that's fine.<eos> I don't.
Good work.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> That was so good.<eos> You are fucking insane.<eos> Well, I try really fucking hard.<eos> So I'm glad you noticed.<eos> So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?<eos> No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out.<eos> - Yeah. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Yeah, sort of.<eos> - Darling, shall we pop back indoors?<eos> - Yeah, good idea.<eos> '.. four, three, two, one.'<eos> Indestructible as ever.<eos> Married the diamond(!<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Why are you so unsupportive of them?<eos> It's your best friend in love with my best friend.<eos> - Because she's not!<eos> - Okay.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - Why would you say that? - Because it's the truth, Brian.<eos> They had this fun little thing in Mexico, and she got carried away and agreed to marry him because she thought he'd be shipping off before she ever had to go through with it, and she got all caught in these wedding details,<eos> and she doesn't love him, and she never did.<eos> Jenna.<eos> She never did.
The first time you were locked up for some meaningless bullshit strong-arm crap that you'd done.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I remember saying to you, Rusty,<eos> "Rusty, you've got to take a different road.<eos> A new approach.<eos> Those days are over and done with.<eos> That kind of behavior, that violent-streak behavior is no longer gonna be tolerated by me or by the police."<eos> And do you remember what you said to me?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You don't.
And you're fired.<eos> - Get out.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Yeah, get out of here.<eos> Nobody talks about my mom like that.<eos> - Nobody.<eos> - Except my best friend.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Well, but not even him because that was inappropriate and he knows better.<eos> - I do.
Why?<eos> Why haven't I killed anybody?<eos> Because if I did, there'd be no going back.<eos> There'd be no going back to how things were.<eos> I'm from a place where people are still like they were... more or less, better or worse.<eos> I can walk it from here. Till we meet up with my friends.<eos> They got a car.<eos> You can ride with them.<eos> How many friends you say there were?<eos> I didn't.
The Knights Rosula, a clandestine order under the charge of the archdeacon of Windsor.<eos> They believe Annora and others like her pose a threat to the Church.<eos> That is why Robinus was here, not to examine accounts, but to start the search for Annora.<eos> What possible threat could a gentle, aged woman present to the Church?<eos> She has ancient documents in her possession that cast doubt upon the Church's most significant teachings.<eos> I find it difficult to believe that a man as pious as Archdeacon Robinus would endanger the life of a child.<eos> Yea.<eos> But we must meet Robinus and his Rosula to find out if it is indeed a harsh truth or the delusion of a potion maker.<eos> You do not think it is a delusion.<eos> I do not, my lady.
Sir, there's absolutely no evidence of a security breach of any kind.<eos> And yet we know there was a security breach?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> So what you're telling me, Captain Connolly, is that you've failed.<eos> You're not allowed to fail, Captain.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Not when it involves a coordinated attack on the high command.<eos> The Semite I brought in, the one who shot at me, did you manage to locate any members of his family?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
I'm sitting down with Bucky and Rayna. My manager should be there to advise me.<eos> Here's my advice... cancel.<eos> I want to get you out of Highway 65 anyway.<eos> I don't want to get out, okay?<eos> You know, with Juliette and Sadie gone,<eos> - they have to make me a priority now.<eos> - Do they?<eos> I'm, frankly, amazed. I mean, between touring and acting, I don't know how you do it, especially with a new baby.<eos> It's tough. It's the life of a mom. - You know it.<eos> - Yeah, no, I do.
Us?<eos> Jews?<eos> You're Jewish?<eos> No.<eos> Ah... you meant...<eos> - I did.<eos> - Yep. Yeah.<eos> I just... just, uh, panicked for a second.<eos> I thought maybe it looked like I was hitting on you.<eos> Uh, didn't till just this second.
As far as I'm concerned, your standing as an agent in the Bureau is finished.<eos> The Assistant Director actually had us surveilling her for an assignment.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You just blew your own op with Alex.<eos> Alex, wait!<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> Do you like the tea?<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, I do.
We've risked our careers. We've... we've taken bullets.<eos> We put everything on the line for her.<eos> For you when you needed it the most.<eos> Where were you when we needed the same?<eos> No, I'll tell you where.<eos> Hiding behind those monitors.<eos> - [Voice breaking] Shelby, please.<eos> - No. This morning, we said we weren't gonna make any more choices that we regret.<eos> So I hope that you can live with this, Alex.<eos> I really do.
The raid was led by a Special Agent Clayton Haas."<eos> Look, I told you... they brainwashed me.<eos> All right?<eos> They made me believe that the government was taking away our liberties.<eos> But I... I was 17!<eos> I was just a kid!<eos> And what?<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, you would show people the truth?<eos> For so long, I've been trying to realize why I've never told you that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
This is, uh, Brianna and Kayla.<eos> Will you ladies excuse us, please?<eos> Come on. I'm doing you a favor. You don't want to roll with a piece of shit like this.<eos> Come on, dude, give me a fucking break. Come on.<eos> Listen, go to the bar, get yourself a drink.<eos> Get me a Tequila. Come on.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Come here.<eos> Don't go crazy. Mid-shelf.<eos> How you doing?
- Let's check with Allison.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, honey, Graham wants to take us out to dinner tonight.<eos> Get away from all the craziness.<eos> Actually, can we do tomorrow night?<eos> Tonight we've got dinner with that woman from DeGraaf's.<eos> Roxanna Whitman.<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I need that mask back.<eos> Right now.<eos> You should bounce while you can, Tommy.<eos> Look, if I don't get that mask back, people a lot more dangerous than me are going to come for it.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?
I didn't get any time off when my dog had puppies.<eos> - You took two weeks off.<eos> - I only needed one.<eos> I totally get it. I recently missed an important lunch because I was admiring a butter-yellow dandelion that had forced its way through a pavement crack.<eos> That's a weird new attitude.<eos> Yeah, Dr. Reed's been in a real good mood since he started getting it on the reg.<eos> On the reg with Whitney?<eos> Well...<eos> She knows you're going out, right?<eos> Indeed she does, Danny.
Well you never know what the future holds.<eos> I mean, if something was to happen, you'd be able to run this place by yourself, right?<eos> Easy?<eos> - Run the practice alone? - Sure.<eos> [chuckles] Why?<eos> Say we were to have another kid,<eos> Mindy would probably stop working.<eos> Oh, you don't say.<eos> I wasn't aware that Mindy wanted any more children.<eos> Oh, we do. Yeah.
- I talked to Mrs. Ramsay.<eos> She was really happy.<eos> doy. you can wrestle a baby right out of that if you have meaty enough hands.<eos> I'm sorry about what I said.<eos> I think you might actually be better than the guy we were meant to hire.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah. - And I'm sorry that I said<eos> I know why your wife can't stand you.<eos> - You never said that.<eos> - I didn't?
Am I his malware?<eos> I had to wash my face.<eos> Hard to breathe... here.<eos> I know you framed Terry Colby.<eos> I-I didn't.<eos> Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died. That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
Is that sponsor gonna be there? Drew?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He's really excited about you.<eos> Yeah, till I shit the bed.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Tonight can only help you.<eos> This is a non-sanctioned fight, so even if you lose, which you won't, it's not gonna go on your record.<eos> - A loss is a loss.<eos> - Then don't fucking lose.<eos> What if I do?
Actually, I'm interested in your other talent.<eos> Other talent?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You painted a foolproof Renoir for Michael Pearson.<eos> I'd like you to do the same for me.<eos> For your private collection? A Renoir?<eos> A Van Gogh.<eos> Van Gogh.<eos> Which one?<eos> I once did a "Starry Night" for a gentleman in Shanghai.
It's not your watch for another hour.<eos> Couldn't sleep.<eos> I'm sure she's fine, Jackson.<eos> I'm sure she's fine, too.<eos> And when we return home with the cure, we'll set everything straight.<eos> We'll be heroes.<eos> I never cared to be a hero.<eos> I just wanted a... quiet, simple life.<eos> Which is what we had.<eos> Yes, we did.
I'm not gonna stay long.<eos> I just wanted to clear some things up.<eos> You were right.<eos> I wasn't honest with you the other night.<eos> This is still new...<eos> And I'm still figuring out how to talk about it and when.<eos> But that's not what's happening here.<eos> _<eos> You have more...<eos> Experience than I do.
What's goin' on?<eos> What's up?<eos> Is it too much?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got lists, Joshy.<eos> You... I know. You know, all the time, just...<eos> Mm-hm. Yeah, I know. I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you know now?<eos> I do.
They knew about the security cameras from the video.<eos> More likely, they pounced at your home.<eos> You gained the upper hand, as you are wont to do.<eos> Suddenly, you had two bodies to get rid of.<eos> But your victims brought their own shovels, tarps and lye.<eos> You could have buried them right there in your yard.<eos> Tell us, Mr. Murillo, when the New Jersey police search your home, will they find two graves?<eos> Say they do.<eos> It was self-defense, you said it yourself.<eos> I did, I did.
I just never thought it'd be you.<eos> I never knew why you married me.<eos> I was never as... kind and empathetic as you.<eos> That's why it was so easy for me to walk away why I gave up on you.<eos> I lost something when I left you.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
For now... let's just watch the sunrise.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I never thought I deserved this.<eos> - What, a trip to Hawaii?<eos> - No.<eos> Happiness.<eos> This kind of happiness.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> - We both do.
You have to go.<eos> Listen, I think Sakura is a room somewhere in this building, and I need to find it.<eos> I don't know what it is you're doing.<eos> I need a floor plan, Christine.<eos> Or why you think you can come to me, but I need this job.<eos> I promise this will never get back to you.<eos> But the next time that bastard demands personal services, at least you'll know you screwed him a little, too.<eos> I... I, uh... I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.

Any particular reason you chose Brazil?<eos> I know where you're going with this, and, yes, we...<eos> When that picture of Kevin in Rio popped up on the Internet, we had to go look for ourselves.<eos> So, that boy in Brazil, to you, could've been Kevin.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It...<eos> It's possible we saw what we wanted to see. Mm.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't. No, we don't.
That's why we ain't got no food now. 'Cause all we got is each other.<eos> Man, this is exactly what food stamps is for.<eos> All right, guys, listen, I just Googled how to get food stamps, and it's really quite simple.<eos> You guys all meet the criteria.<eos> No money, no job and no income in the bank, so.<eos> Boonie, why don't you go down there, man?<eos> You got two kids; they'll probably give you extra.<eos> Man, I'm already on food stamps, man. Between my mom and Shalinka, I don't have enough left to buy a bag of Doritos.<eos> Well, somebody gonna have to go down there, man, or else we gonna starve.<eos> Okay, well, who gonna do it, though?
A bit of redness and swelling is normal.<eos> He may get a slight temperature.<eos> Telephone or just contact us if you're at all worried.<eos> It's alright.<eos> All done?<eos> He hasn't had the injection yet.<eos> Can I help?<eos> Oh, would you?<eos> He always settles with his grandfather.<eos> Of course he does.
I didn't say that.<eos> But if Parry's telling the truth, then...<eos> Ryan had gone rogue. Stop it.<eos> You never even knew about that house.<eos> He kept that from you, the pills from you, maybe other secrets too.<eos> ~ Why are you doing this?<eos> ~ To help you to see who he really was properly.<eos> ~ You were supposed to be his friend.<eos> ~ Well, I didn't know him very well.<eos> None of us did.
It's your home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Actually, Jo, there was something I came to say.<eos> I can't give the eulogy at Ryan's funeral.<eos> Why?<eos> To do that would be to say in public that I had complete faith in him.<eos> But there are still doubts over his conduct. ~ From whom?<eos> ~ I can't go into that.<eos> If you don't speak at his funeral, you're judging him without knowing the whole story.<eos> None of us do.
IRON MAN: We don't take orders from maniacs in clown suits.<eos> Seriously, who designed that look?<eos> Got you, Cap, but it won't be graceful.<eos> Told you.<eos> Uh, anyone up for a weekend in Vegas?<eos> Create a perimeter and keep him away from the city.<eos> I thought you were better than this.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> No one does.
We're thinking about each other.<eos> We've acknowledged, we've made mistakes - and we're gonna grow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll always support you in anything that you do.<eos> No one will understand like our bond that we have together.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No one will.<eos> - We went through it. - Yeah.<eos> Well, we don't have like the picture-perfect bond either.<eos> No. We don't.
Shameful, really. Betting against your own grandson.<eos> Mm. It's the Argentines who should be ashamed.<eos> How could they lose?<eos> Ah. Cyrus.<eos> - Did you fix the match?<eos> - Would I do something like that?<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, in that case, I'm going to have to pay you with one of Simon's notes.<eos> The people loved him, didn't they?<eos> Of course they did.
- Damiani!<eos> - Borghini, what are you doing here?<eos> I can't believe it, you're in Amsterdam too, how nice!<eos> Leopoldo, my father-in-law.<eos> This is Leopoldo Borghini, from my club, the funniest pharmacist in the world.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Charmed.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - We know each other.<eos> We do?
We should have had lunch.<eos> You could have saved the money for Stina's dress.<eos> I think she's fine.<eos> If you get too hungry, there's always this..<eos> Lisa, my beloved sister.<eos> .<eos> as Hjalmar Söderberg said:<eos> You must excuse me, but I almost never watch TV.<eos> I haven't seen your cooking programme.<eos> -I did a series on drinks too.
Check for hand nodules!<eos> Okay, why are you yelling?<eos> You know that makes me flustered.<eos> Highlight the joints.<eos> Bang. Rheumatoid arthritis.<eos> Those hot spots you see are nodules... very early signs of disease.<eos> Arthur had vulnerable blood vessels.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that, had he fired a 9-millimeter weapon, I'd see discoloration in his skin.<eos> I do not.
No.<eos> I would never ask my brother such a thing.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> And he would never... He would never... what?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you been smoking?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Did you get word from Sammy?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
You have.<eos> Some people call that growing up. I call it growing old.<eos> Once you let fun go, you never get it back.<eos> Over and above everything and anybody... .. I choose fun.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Not here!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's the impossible.<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> I didn't.
And who the hell is that?<eos> Mr. Tull's therapist. SAM:<eos> What?<eos> A therapist can't testify against their own patient.<eos> She can if we paid for it and he signed a waiver, which he did.<eos> LAWYER: Mr. Tull, your therapist's testimony is coming, and when it does, your ability to cut a deal goes away.<eos> Drop this matter, and no one ever knows you saw a therapist at all.<eos> You went to see a company provided therapist, and you never told me?<eos> I didn't think it mattered.<eos> Well, it goddamn does.
DONNA: Dinner is served.<eos> I guess that means you got Opie his bridal gift after all.<eos> I did.<eos> And I shouldn't have been so standoffish with you in the file room.<eos> Well, maybe I shouldn't have had that be our first interaction.<eos> No, that's not on you. That's on me.<eos> I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, first week of school, every clay I dropped my little girl off. When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
_<eos> Really?<eos> A fancy new car?<eos> I thought we weren't supposed to attract attention.<eos> Try telling Uzay that.<eos> He showed up at the club last night.<eos> I know. He told me.<eos> Not only could he've got all of us arrested, now Brukner's hot for more antiquities.<eos> And we don't have anything like the Gudea to give him.<eos> Maybe we do.
I can understand evil Santiani, scary Santiani, but why sucker Santiani?<eos> She's supposed to get bumped up to Deputy Inspector.<eos> She picks out her new office, plans herself a party, gets loaded, tells half the precinct what she really thinks of 'em.<eos> Then the promotion falls through.<eos> Ouch.<eos> That's why. Why she's so unbearable?<eos> That's why she's willing to drive an hour to work.<eos> She was humiliated.<eos> There's no one in our precinct who knows what happened to her.<eos> - But if they did...
- Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Good boy.<eos> What else could he be?<eos> Hanging around a sketchy park.<eos> I'm not buying it, Donovan.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you knew him.<eos> - The hell I did.
Nah, Briggs has been trying to get at him.<eos> Nothing.<eos> ♪ ♪ I never remember my dreams.<eos> I wasn't dreaming.<eos> Got some strange stuff in here.<eos> - Like wacko strange.<eos> - Yeah. It looks crazy, but...<eos> I was desperate to get down what I was thinking, you know, to make sense of it, to not forget what I saw when I was... wherever I was.<eos> You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.

This place we found for you is anonymous.<eos> No work, no pressure.<eos> You can just... You can go tonight.<eos> I gotta finish the case, Charlie.<eos> No, baby, you gotta get well.<eos> You gotta get well.<eos> You gotta be ready to quit this shit.<eos> And I'm ready.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I don't.
I could hear your ranting from inside the pod, Chopra, for the God's sake!<eos> Feel better?<eos> Commander Nagata.<eos> Young for the responsibility.<eos> Quite a baptism of fire, I'm afraid.<eos> Marvellous, ma'am.<eos> All hail, Morpheus, eh?<eos> Deep-Ando, conscript.<eos> Likes to think of himself as the joker of this little group.<eos> Well, he did.
- Clara?<eos> - It's fine, it's just Morpheus.<eos> What do you think you were doing?<eos> Huh?<eos> It dragged me in.<eos> The wires, they were like snakes. - Like it was alive.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, it just kind of flicked over my eyes.<eos> - Did I sleep?<eos> - Yeah, you did.
To die?<eos> They wouldn't thank you for that.<eos> Nor you, Clara. "To die, to die.<eos> "Glamis hath murdered sleep,<eos> "therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more.<eos> "Macbeth shall sleep no more."<eos> What?<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> He really knew his stuff.<eos> They all did.
No, not nice.<eos> Hey, we're helping Liv. Liv did not ask for your help. She does not want your help.<eos> She did this.<eos> You know why you don't know about any plan?<eos> Because you are not part of any plan.<eos> The plan already happened.<eos> The plan was Olivia Pope standing on that sidewalk and, with one word, obliterating any life she's ever known.<eos> The plan was Liv requiring the same thing of herself that she requires of her clients, standing by the one thing, following the only rule that matters to her.<eos> What is that? Do not lie.<eos> Do. Not.
Nice work, doctor.<eos> Are you talking to me?<eos> No, to me.<eos> Mr. Lawson, I assume you're here to look into my pants.<eos> I'm...<eos> The pair that were torn on one of your conference room chairs.<eos> I e-mailed you an invoice.<eos> Is none of this ringing the bell?<eos> No, sorry, I get a lot of e-mail.<eos> Who doesn't?
Ash, I think you were the last person to talk to her.<eos> Can you remember her final words?<eos> 'Are you a little gay boy?<eos> Aw! - Seems fitting somehow.<eos> - I'm so glad you're all right.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Yeah, I really am.<eos> Well, it was a beautiful ceremony.<eos> And seeing two men married didn't look nearly as weird as I thought it would.<eos> - Really. Really. - It did to me.
Right.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You'll need provisions, and, um, what else?<eos> Daliyah. Daliyah. Daliyah.<eos> What?<eos> You don't have to say anything else.<eos> Everything is understood between us.<eos> I will wait here for you with your son.<eos> Come back, okay?<eos> But if you don't...
We like some of the same stuff.<eos> Like what?<eos> I played her some music, and she was into it.<eos> - What did you play?<eos> - Yaz.<eos> - What song?<eos> - "Only You."<eos> Did your dad teach you that move?<eos> He said it always works.<eos> Did with me.
These are powerful ingredients, Arthur. I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> We need something to protect us.<eos> These people drop from the sky, then they turn on us, freeing prisoners!<eos> They won't stop until they've taken everything from me.<eos> Guards!<eos> Infidels are on their way.<eos> Call up the reserves. Get every man on the parapet, and patrol every hall.<eos> And, you, give me your helm.<eos> The ladle and the caldron have special protection spells.<eos> This helmet and our friends do not.
Not without a fight.<eos> That would be a problem if it was the baby I was after.<eos> Zelena.<eos> Your insane girlfriend sped up my pregnancy, kidnapped me right after giving birth, and separated me from my little girl.<eos> And they say I'm wicked.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> What does she need you for?<eos> From the looks of things, she's casting a spell to steal my magic.<eos> Why does she need more dark magic?<eos> I don't.
You mean by helicopter?<eos> In traffic, it's an hour.<eos> Helicopter gets me there in five minutes.<eos> When you landed, where did you go?<eos> I worked out at the gym for two hours.<eos> And then I spent the night at the downtown Canyon Spa.<eos> Were you alone?<eos> Uh, Mr. Weber, we apologize, but for the sake of your daughter, we need you to cooperate.<eos> You and your wife, you have a good relationship?<eos> We do, yes.
Oh, are those for me?<eos> Please sign here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I wonder who these are from.<eos> "To Holly, from Eric, just because."<eos> Aw. I noticed on Facebook that they were your favorite.<eos> Oh, that's so thoughtful.<eos> See, most men wouldn't know what to send.<eos> But you know what I like.<eos> Yes, yes I do.
You said I went soft.<eos> What do we got without our reputation?<eos> Now, if this is a fake, I'm gonna come back to visit.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> He said he knew my dad?<eos> Yeah, they used to run in the same circle.<eos> - What was that thing you gave him?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
Mm, I'm a divorce attorney.<eos> A lot of school for that, huh?<eos> Yeah, a lot of school.<eos> Hey, so... thanks.<eos> Hey, Fred, so what do you do in your spare time?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I watch TV.<eos> I eat.<eos> I like sandwiches.<eos> Who doesn't?
Then put someone else on the case.<eos> That's not how it works.<eos> If I may...<eos> If we agree not to pursue criminal charges in this matter, will you give us the emails within the week?<eos> You agree to that right here, I'll give 'em to you tomorrow.<eos> Then we have a deal.<eos> You wanna tell me what kind of kickback you're getting?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You went behind my back.<eos> I didn't do anything behind your back.

It's never affected me professionally.<eos> R-right.<eos> Uh, well, look, uh, from now on, let's just be honest with each other, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay. I don't know what you see in your girlfriend, and you're getting a little tummy.<eos> What?<eos> Oh... Oh!<eos> I mean, uh I-if I... If I stand up straight, it, uh, goes away, doesn't it?<eos> Uh...<eos> Oh, no. It doesn't.
- Yeah.<eos> I love Dana.<eos> I-I really do.<eos> Well, then, make that call.<eos> But 10 minutes only.<eos> There, I see it.<eos> Hailey's comet.<eos> My God, so cool.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> Yeah, I did.
We are so happy to be raising your son.<eos> - That's nice.<eos> - I see you have smoke detectors. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Good. I assume you have a carbon-monoxide monitor.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Obviously you don't have a gun.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, we don't.
In yourself?<eos> But... so does that mean I'm off the hook?<eos> Dre, I hate guns more than I hate how Levi's fit me.<eos> And I know I don't want guns anywhere near my children, all right?<eos> But somehow I panicked, okay?<eos> And that is how people wind up shot.<eos> That is exactly why we shouldn't have a gun in the house.<eos> Babe, I get it.<eos> And I shouldn't want one, either, especially after what just happened.<eos> But I do.
Mmm.<eos> Death by pork... a warrior's death.<eos> Good morning, everybody!<eos> Real bacon.<eos> And And pancakes?<eos> Ruby, I told you I don't like the kids eating a sugary breakfast on a school day.<eos> Since when is Thursday a school day?<eos> Besides, I have a right to spoil my grandbabies.<eos> Now, who wants ice cream?<eos> - I do!
So nice you came!<eos> [Chuckles nervously] Dre will be right back, but, please, uh, join our, um, our chr... our Christmas.<eos> Wow, uh, thank you for inviting me to this wonderfully festive and heartwarming environment.<eos> D-do the kids not have presents?<eos> Our dad threw them away before we woke up.<eos> Ha! That sounds so much worse than it is.<eos> Well, here's what happened.<eos> So, Dre had a screaming match with his dad over the fried Christmas chicken, and then we went upstairs to have our secret Christmas in the closet and our hamper Turkey, and Dre had already thrown his dirty underwear<eos> [chuckles] On top of the Turkey, so... [Inhales deeply] And then the goldfish died.<eos> She did?
They've just hired a grief counselor to help the children through this traumatic time. Oh!<eos> You don't remember?<eos> What?<eos> I swear I told you.<eos> The night I babysat.<eos> When the kids and I had that great deep talk.<eos> My kids?<eos> I'm the truth fairy.<eos> Although, I don't remember talking about the Sudan.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I do.
New Mexico?<eos> I thought you lived in Maine.<eos> I always pictured you there.<eos> A little house by a lake?<eos> I was just there for, like, a month, 30 years ago.<eos> -I live outside Santa Fe now.<eos> -Oh.<eos> -[sighs] Think everyone here read my book?<eos> -I didn't.<eos> Of course you didn't.
- Yep.<eos> There... that's our killer.<eos> Yep.<eos> Yes, we can confirm that these items belong to my father.<eos> Our father.<eos> It must sound shallow, but to be able to hold this, even through the plastic, just for a moment; it comforts me.<eos> I gave him this for our twenty-fifth anniversary.<eos> It's engraved, "To my one and only".<eos> Did you notice that?<eos> Yes, ma'am, we did.
Um, before I bless the bread and the wine and the salad forks and the napkin holders, I want to say something to Uncle Billy.<eos> And I'm sure I speak for everybody here when I say that we are absolutely fine with you being gay.<eos> Okay. And, um, I am still coming to terms with the fact that you like Billy Joel.<eos> So.<eos> I'm proud of my record collection,<eos> I'll admit that.<eos> But Billy, look around the table.<eos> Move your head around and just take it all in.<eos> We are your family and we want you to feel comfortable in our home.<eos> Well, I don't.
I am not so sure about that.<eos> I'm not so sure about those shoes.<eos> (Schmidt) I'm telling you, there is something off with this guy.<eos> We all know that you were against hiring a gay pastor.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> He didn't even seem to know what scripture was.<eos> Or maybe you're just looking for any excuse to find fault with him.<eos> Excuse me. Or maybe hiring someone sight unseen over the Internet was a bad idea.<eos> Do you wanna spend another year looking for a new pastor?<eos> Because I don't.
Maybe Light was wrong.<eos> Maybe he can't see through the breaches.<eos> Or maybe he finally decided to give up.<eos> Hey. Iris, slow down.<eos> I can't understand you.<eos> Zoom has Linda.<eos> He's on the roof.<eos> Put her down.<eos> You like to fish with bait?<eos> I do too.
Niklaus, would you politely remind me why we shouldn't just compel them all to give us what we want?<eos> Ha ha ha! I'm sorry.<eos> Did Elijah say something amusing?<eos> We lost a century to compulsion, my love, and some of us lost a great deal more.<eos> Surely you can't believe we'd allow ourselves to come here vulnerable.<eos> My dearest Aurora, compulsion is not my only party trick.<eos> I do not like these threats.<eos> Our continued existence depends on the Mikaelsons.<eos> We've known that since Finn and Kol died.<eos> Unfortunately, so does every other vampire in the world.
Because you asked me to bring the compensation issue up For a vote like a man and I did.<eos> And is Jack Soloff aware of this?<eos> Not only aware of it, he's voting for it.<eos> And however did you get him to do that?<eos> Let's just say that you wanted me to do this Like Harvey would have and not like I would have, But I did the best of both.<eos> Then you have my proxy.<eos> Harvey, I talked to Alyssa Lang And there's something you should know.<eos> Let me guess, she batted her eyes, told you a sob story,<eos> And now you think she's some kind of innocent.<eos> No, I don't.
The Russian diplomatic mission in Germany has released...<eos> Hello?<eos> It's me.<eos> What the hell's happening at the Russian embassy?<eos> You heard about that already?<eos> Yeah, it's all over the Internet.<eos> They keep mentioning classified documents-- are they the same ones Laura Sutton was writing about last week?<eos> One would assume.<eos> He said as much on the video.<eos> - Who did?
And the men are gorgeous.<eos> Otto.<eos> Carrie.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I've been worried about you.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> You always say that, but are you really? I am.<eos> I mean, for the time being, at least.<eos> Did you find the man you were looking for?<eos> Yeah, I did, but...
They do.<eos> And you will see to it that it does.<eos> It's obscene.<eos> Civilization is facing an existential threat.<eos> The West needs a wake-up call.<eos> I agree, but not like this.<eos> Radical Islam must be eradicated, root and branch.<eos> My premier understands this.<eos> Bashar al-Assad understands.<eos> Only your president does not.
Not in the normal sense.<eos> He was rounded up.<eos> And this is the best part. He'd already volunteered to help the investigation.<eos> Perhaps that's what he's doing, then, helping the BND.<eos> Then why the silence?<eos> Why can't he be reached?<eos> Remember, this man had already been illegally imprisoned once before.<eos> One could argue that in extraordinary times the state is justified in taking extraordinary measures.<eos> I used to believe that.<eos> I really did.
Where?<eos> Navarre.<eos> To shed some Bourbon blood.<eos> I will marry you.<eos> And how did you come to your decision?<eos> I know how much our mother hurt you.<eos> But you knew I needed her.<eos> You treated me fairly, like a brother.<eos> Helped me understand that you want what's best for me.<eos> You both do.
So, it's just business as usual with Miles?<eos> Is that it?<eos> And why shouldn't it be?<eos> Because of your delusions?<eos> My delusions?<eos> Did you speak with Alex White or the nanny?<eos> We've already let Monica go.<eos> That's not gonna solve the problem.<eos> Well, you see, we don't have a problem.<eos> You do.
All right, I hope you're right.<eos> All right, let's start with what went wrong. You did.<eos> When we go up against Savage, your head's not in the game.<eos> You're not yourself. Why not?<eos> Oliver...<eos> Barry!<eos> Why not?<eos> Ok, are you planning on giving me a hair sample to run forensics on in the near future?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Well, I did.
Here we go.<eos> Cisco...<eos> I'm really sorry. You know what, it's fine.<eos> It's cool.<eos> It's actually kind of a classic story... boy meets girl, boy gets girl, girl sprouts wings and flies away with her reincarnated soul mate.<eos> The only part I don't get is you don't even really seem to like him.<eos> It's kind of a complicated relationship.<eos> Hmm. Like most 4,000 year old relationships are, I guess.<eos> A week ago, I was a barista and I really didn't have a plan for what I was going to do with my life.<eos> And now you do?
You are such a strong girl.<eos> I am so sorry I didn't see it sooner.<eos> My son...<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Kill me!<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it, Lily.<eos> You're wrong about so many things.<eos> I never had the courage to tell you before...<eos> But I do now.
I used one of your hideous tops.<eos> Which is now your hideous top.<eos> Can I ask you what might seem like a mean question?<eos> It's not like I'm in a fragile state or anything.<eos> What do you see in her, aside from the fact that she looks like a blond Angelina Jolie?<eos> She's loving, protective, kind.<eos> But just to you.<eos> That's fair. She does always think of me first.<eos> Maybe I'm spoiled or old-fashioned, but it's nice having that one person who doesn't need anything from you, who just loves you and thinks you're the most amazing, beautiful girl in the whole world, you know?<eos> Maybe... maybe you don't.
By end of day, we'll have what is ours, and we'll have taken care of the only witch willing to protect them.<eos> I think I prefer the bottom the murky sea to that restroom.<eos> Still hungry, are we?<eos> I'm not hungry, I'm angry...<eos> Staked your ex, drowned by Nik's.<eos> You two need a lesson in women.<eos> Could the lesson not be yours to learn, Rebekah?<eos> Didn't you damn one of them to eternity, viciously antagonize the other?<eos> Those lunatics actually believe the prophecy.<eos> You don't, do you?
- Liam, I do not look good.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Morning.<eos> So much for slowing down.<eos> - Eleanor.<eos> - What?<eos> Last night... you said you liked it when I said your name.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Mm-hm. - I do.
- Yes, you do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Morning.<eos> So much for slowing down.<eos> - Eleanor.<eos> - What?<eos> Last night... you said you liked it when I said your name.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Mm-hm. - I do.<eos> I do.
No, I guess I don't.<eos> But she's Eric's mom.<eos> Yes.<eos> It'd be nice to know something about her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> I, you know, I...<eos> I thought I really knew you, and I unpacked those boxes...<eos> Honey, of course, you know me.<eos> Of course you do.
Any money missing from the company?<eos> No.<eos> You sure about that.<eos> As far as I know.<eos> Isn't it your job to know?<eos> My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Replaced Nate!<eos> Who replaced your monkey husband!<eos> Because you make me feel like shit.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Come on, Jake.<eos> Face it.<eos> Who I am, my neatness, my control, my ambition.<eos> You don't like me.<eos> - Don't put it back on me.<eos> - No, you don't.
I don't know, but as soon as I do know, you two will be the first I tell.<eos> - I love it. - Newt, how about that?<eos> - I can't wait.<eos> - I can't wait.<eos> Yay, jinx, buy me a Coke.<eos> - I'm hungry.<eos> - Yes. - Are you hungry?<eos> - Yes, I'm always hungry.<eos> You know I love you, right?<eos> I do.
Are you sure?<eos> Well, I wasn't sure, until they called me in and said, "Jeri, we're not happy with you."<eos> Look, uh, circulation is down and costs are up.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are you letting me go?<eos> They love you.<eos> - They do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone does.
Yeah, he seems a bit lost.<eos> To be honest, he's been lost since he got back from his last tour.<eos> Since he left the Navy, he's been too proud to ask for help so he can rebuild his life, find a new career.<eos> Not the easiest transition...<eos> Active military to normal, everyday life.<eos> No.<eos> No. He just left. He said he'd come back when he got things sorted out.<eos> I can't make him, I've tried. I'll find him.<eos> You don't have to do this, Luke. You don't have to get involved.<eos> I do.
You once said, uh, that love was worth fighting for, and you're right, and I know that you're right, and I would stay, but I can't blow up your world.<eos> Not now that you finally have it on track.<eos> Paul...<eos> You have Jack, and I don't want to cause any trouble, but I can't just stand by and not do anything.<eos> I can't pretend that I'm not falling for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For opening me up again.<eos> I wasn't even sure if my heart worked anymore.<eos> But it does.
Popular culture might depict that as a romantic notion, I suppose.<eos> He never spoke about his work.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> Everything else.<eos> I see.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't see at all.<eos> Well, what did you two talk about?<eos> - Outside of work?<eos> - We didn't.
Daniel!<eos> I was in a state.<eos> I didn't deserve to be his mum.<eos> Surely you can't be so conventional as to think there's only one way to bring up a child?<eos> We are both his mother.<eos> Neither one less nor more real than the other.<eos> I took care of his mind and she took care of his other needs.<eos> He didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> Except he did.
But that's it?<eos> He's accused of a capital crime, okay, and unlike the U.K., America has the death penalty.<eos> Do you want to send an innocent man to his death?<eos> Look, I have no problem telling the FBI to bugger off.<eos> But this plan of yours will only work if you can actually deliver your friend.<eos> Yes, that's him.<eos> Yeah, I saw his picture on the news; that's why I called.<eos> He told us that his name was Leo Parks.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
- I'm fine, I'm hungry.<eos> - And your boy?<eos> - He's coming.<eos> - Ragnar.<eos> - Ubba, I brought men and horses.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Are you well?<eos> You made a gift of his own son's head?<eos> - How did this lord react?<eos> - He did nothing.
You don't care who you have to hurt to get ahead.<eos> Lord knows what you told Diver - to get what you needed.<eos> - What we needed.<eos> Don't include me in that.<eos> You are only in it for yourself, and everybody knows that!<eos> It's a fact.<eos> Look, I don't know how much longer you think I'm gonna put up with it, but you need to watch your mouth.<eos> Yeah, or what?<eos> You don't want to go there, Jack.<eos> The hell I don't.
By my last count, there's six plus Kindzi against the entire town. We can beat 'em.<eos> Can we?<eos> Of course we can.<eos> Hell, it wouldn't feel like home if we weren't on the verge of annihilation.<eos> No, this time it's different.<eos> This time it's on me.<eos> God, I'm so stupid.<eos> Amanda, don't.<eos> I believed him.<eos> We all did.
Ugh! Methodical bastard.<eos> He studied the lives and habits of everyone he visited.<eos> All these terminally ill patients were just a mark for him.<eos> You can bet he was stealing from all of them.<eos> And...<eos> He was making very good scratch from the sales.<eos> Which probably seemed like small potatoes once he found out how much bank Nina was putting away.<eos> Yeah, with all the publicity she and April were getting, he turned it into his own cottage industry.<eos> You wondered how she paid for all the makeup?<eos> She didn't.
- It was a lovely present.<eos> - A little gift, that's all.<eos> I wanted to give it to you myself, but that woman wouldn't let me.<eos> - I told you she's a redneck.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - I'm wearing it now.<eos> Have a sniff. - Let's see.<eos> Nice.<eos> I told you it suited you.<eos> Yes, you did.
What do you say?<eos> Cut your losses and move on.<eos> But I say that about everything.<eos> If something's failed, light it on fire and watch it burn... In your rear-view mirror as you drive your way to successtown.<eos> Ah! Maybe you're right.<eos> But I'm also not ready to give up on this place.<eos> It was the future I wanted to build.<eos> I don't think mother nature felt the same way.<eos> I really cared about it.<eos> I still do...
Hey, you were the one who taught me that I was more than everyone else's opinion of me.<eos> Why can't you see that you are too?<eos> - It's not that easy.<eos> - Of course not!<eos> That's why you have sisters to fall back on when things get hard.<eos> Sisters who always believed that you were good enough.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Maybe we should get a lawyer, see what they would suggest we do.<eos> I've been...<eos> Doing some thinking, too, and...
Don't thank me yet.<eos> You haven't heard my demands.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Yeah. And you lied to me from the start, Vin.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing, man.<eos> I just wanted the money.<eos> I try to be a good Bali man, I get nothing. I try to be an American... it's much worse, man.<eos> Maybe I did something terrible in last life.<eos> After all this, Vin... you can't still possibly believe in karma.<eos> Of course I do.
Have you ever met a girl that's like... Yes.<eos> Do you know what's crazy about me?<eos> I, a normal sized woman, would fuck Peter Dinklage.<eos> Isn't that amazing?<eos> Someone get me a Kennedy Center Honor.<eos> (laughing) Man, you guys were hilarious.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How come you don't have your own podcast?<eos> Oh, we did, years ago.
She was too scared to stick around.<eos> She made the 911 call from a burger joint down the street.<eos> Well, let's talk to Frankie.<eos> Inside.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Frank Adkins?<eos> - Yeah. I'm Detective Griffin.<eos> This is Detective Burkhardt.<eos> You want to tell us what happened?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Come on.<eos> This is premeditated murder, Emma.<eos> There had to be another way.<eos> You should have come to us. And risk losing someone else?<eos> I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself.<eos> But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine.<eos> You're being stupid. So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No. We don't.
Is that correct?"<eos> - Did you play Gilbert Grape's mom?<eos> I can't place you."<eos> I'm like, "No." They're like,<eos> "Okay, well, you didn't get the part.<eos> "But do you want us to put a hose on you, keep you moist, so we can return you to the sea, Blackfish?"<eos> It's fucked up.<eos> And that's not how it is for the dudes at all, okay? Like, I just happened to see the movie "Zookeeper."<eos> Did you ever see that movie?<eos> Okay, if you didn't, don't, all right?
I didn't know he had a sister.<eos> I like your hat.<eos> I'm loving your entire outfit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How are you? - Oh.<eos> You're here.<eos> It was so quiet over there.<eos> Well, I'm a super quiet breather.<eos> Which is not why I called you here today.<eos> Which I did not...
I...<eos> Love that.<eos> Really?<eos> But I think Phoebe should write it.<eos> Um, I'm not a writer.<eos> But it's your journey, your point of view.<eos> - That was crazy right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Great, though.<eos> Me doing the story?
I said hands where I can see 'em!<eos> There is nothing in that bag.<eos> Gun!<eos> No!<eos> _ No!<eos> What did you do?<eos> She had a gun.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - She had a gun.<eos> - No she didn't!
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I know you were hallucinating last night.<eos> Irisa told you?<eos> Yeah, she did.
- Thank God. Thank God.<eos> - Thank God what?<eos> - No, thank God that you're confused too.<eos> I just started these new meds today, and I thought maybe...<eos> - Stop talking, please. - Stay focused.<eos> - You've just been given an examination of your magical aptitude.<eos> - "Magical"?<eos> - We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities. - Okay.<eos> I mean, I used to think that...<eos> - And perhaps you did at one time.
That's what.<eos> Damn it, Les, we're supposed to--<eos> Hey, what about, "Thank you, Les.<eos> That was very thoughtful of you, Les." No problem, man.<eos> Don't sweat it.<eos> How about we were supposed to be layin' low, Les.<eos> How about-- who the hell died and made you the boss, man?<eos> As I remember, you were out making a Booty call. Hey!<eos> She ain't got nothin' to do with this.<eos> The hell she don't.
Your... roommate has done quite a bit. You've got to play catch-up.<eos> What is this?<eos> Maybe you should open it.<eos> "I must save the paper..."<eos> I'm opening it, I'm opening it!<eos> I knew you've been wanting one.<eos> Quentin, this... this is so nice!<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- For what?<eos> - I... um... maybe there's...<eos> I saw a card... um... this is... this is it...<eos> Oh, I know this guy...<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> Shit, shit.<eos> I've got a call. - What?<eos> Do you know this?<eos> 432-Texas?<eos> I don't.
Cruel and unusual punishment.<eos> I can't find a vein.<eos> He's a former I.V. drug user.<eos> His veins are shot.<eos> Breathing's getting labored.<eos> From edema.<eos> He needs dialysis.<eos> Ask them for a machine.<eos> No, we're gonna have to place a vas-cath.<eos> You ever done one before?
I mean, you could get disbarred, or worse... I'm fine.<eos> So, will you stop worrying, or do I need to take you into one of these empty rooms to make you relax?<eos> Miss Guthrie, hi.<eos> We're the...<eos> The lawyers.<eos> I know.<eos> I won't lie for them.<eos> No. We just want to know if you saw Catherine and Caleb the night Helena was killed.<eos> No.<eos> No one on my staff did.
God, no.<eos> Then why do we have surveillance footage that puts you one block from your aunt's car?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I run the same route every night...<eos> River Road to the park and then back home.<eos> That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...<eos> Don't you get it now?<eos> Someone's framing us.<eos> Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?<eos> I didn't.
I know you're a police officer, but...<eos> Lauren Cole.<eos> I can get you the rest of her information.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, Ms. Cole, you've had a rough night.<eos> You need to get some rest.<eos> Just try and sleep.<eos> These are her clothes.<eos> Do you have her license?<eos> I do.
It's for Annie.<eos> That sounded like the opposite of fly fishing.<eos> Can we talk about it later?<eos> I'm sorry about Ivan.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Did he have something to do with your job?<eos> The one we don't talk about?<eos> Sorry. I don't mean to push.<eos> When you were an operative, how did you know when you were in too deep?<eos> I didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> - ... I... I just want to take a moment and just, like, think about what we're doing and make a plan, and we have a chance to do it right.<eos> You know what I'm s... That's all I'm saying.<eos> I, uh, I... I want... I want a baby.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't have, like, a lot of time.<eos> Actually, like, I feel like<eos> I want... want this.<eos> I want this.<eos> I do.
Huh, like to play cop, do you?<eos> No, I just like to play in general, Detective.<eos> What about you?<eos> So, you had a conversation with a dead guy?<eos> Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead. His soul hadn't crossed the threshold.<eos> I see.<eos> Did he tell you why he did it?<eos> Why, money, of course.<eos> You humans, you love your money, don't you?<eos> Yes. Yes, we do.
I miss when I pop in in the morning, and he's sitting on that couch... or I come home from work, and he's sitting on that couch.<eos> There's not much you can depend on in this life except for his ass on that couch!<eos> Yeah, well, life goes on.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Oh, I don't buy this act for a second.<eos> You guys miss him too.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Right, Stuart?<eos> [chuckles] Does the moon miss the sun?<eos> Of course we do.
We live in a civilized country.<eos> This is the case for health care!<eos> Can't you see that in a minute he's going to croak?<eos> And we'll all be fucking accused of refusing help to a sick person.<eos> What will we tell them then?<eos> That he saw a skeleton?<eos> What skeleton?<eos> "I don't know what skeleton.<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> But the patient did.
Thou has begun thy transition.<eos> Thou has begun thy transition.<eos> Don't be a baby.<eos> You left me there to die.<eos> Now we can all be together.<eos> Hey!<eos> Black.<eos> Black. Pink, black.<eos> I like pink. Go with pink.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm serious.<eos> Just to buy you time to win her back.<eos> Raf, this is your family.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> She's throwing everything away.<eos> And what about Mateo?<eos> Mateo's involved, so, I need to do everything I can to make sure we all get along.<eos> 'Cause we're gonna be in each other's lives forever.<eos> Okay, you just said "forever."<eos> I did, didn't I?
It looks like the tumor's invading the transverse colon.<eos> Which didn't show up on the C.T.<eos> No.<eos> It certainly did not.<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> We take a second to reorient ourselves, and then we keep going.<eos> Pliers.<eos> This tumor is attached to everything.<eos> So, that means we close, right?<eos> No, it does not.
What happens?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you can bet that whatever it is, it'll be glorious.<eos> Get a white wine spritzer.<eos> Hey.<eos> I got to book a few hours with you later.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> 6:00 at my home.<eos> I assume you have some sort of transportation, you got a skateboard, pogo stick, big boy bike.<eos> Sure, yeah, I do, but, uh...
I could have seen them!<eos> They didn't make it to the hospital, sweetheart, and--and I didn't want to tell you until I had to.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> How could you not wake me up?<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing up so early?<eos> Oh, nothing, just going through this old box of stuff.<eos> Does that have something to do with you seeing Trevor last night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
See, I changed my Facebook status to in a domestic partnership.<eos> I used to just pretend that I lived alone, and when they would ask, I would say that you were a drifter I let in for a glass of water. But now...<eos> You know, the truth is I think I just need a change.<eos> This thing with Audrey's never gonna happen.<eos> The other day, I basically told her that she had feelings for me, and that we were destined to be together, and...<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> She doesn't even know that I'm here and not there.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she knows.<eos> Everyone does.
I need a doctor! No, no, no.<eos> How's Kevin?<eos> There's no visible signs of trauma? She's fine!<eos> Don't you guys get it?<eos> These are just stickers!<eos> I came to see Kevin. Is he okay?<eos> Why was he in the gym?<eos> Did he have to get stitches?<eos> You're asking questions like you care.<eos> While, Kevin, on the other hand, does not.
For the snow to thaw.<eos> - To retrieve it.<eos> - It was awful.<eos> And this is our only copy.<eos> So mean.<eos> Very sorry about the situation with the food.<eos> I called the grocer, and no one knows where Barry is.<eos> They just think they can do whatever they want.<eos> And I really don't care if I ever see Barry again.<eos> I really don't.
What?<eos> Now.<eos> Time to move, soldier!<eos> Copy that, boss.<eos> I can't get into the plane's telemetry system, but I can access the hydraulics.<eos> I'll open the tailgate just wide enough for you to hop inside.<eos> And you can do that?<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> You don't.
Hauser escaped to redeem himself?<eos> For Hauser and me, Tommy the Irishman and his $10-million stash, it was like Moby Dick, the one that got away.<eos> If Hauser thought that if he escaped with Mullens, he could recover that money...<eos> He'd do it and then disappear to some far-off island.<eos> No, he wouldn't.<eos> He would deliver Mullens and the money to me.<eos> It's a hell of a stretch.<eos> Hauser was my sergeant before he was my captain.<eos> We rode for two years, you don't know him the way I do.<eos> The way I did.
It didn't have to be this way.<eos> Don't try talking to me now.<eos> Tell my brother I'll be right there, Andromeda.<eos> Where is your new friend?<eos> Need help closing the deal?<eos> We're working on a new case.<eos> Case?<eos> So, are we both cops now?<eos> I know you got your pieces of the puzzle, too.<eos> - You always do.
Where was he dropped off?<eos> This guy's house...<eos> Milton Cicero.<eos> Works in sanitation.<eos> Word is he's totally mobbed up.<eos> If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions, Milton here might have gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.<eos> Okay.<eos> He did come to my house, but I didn't kill him...<eos> I swear. - So, how do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
You know, maybe Eric and Dave were working a con together and something went wrong.<eos> Any idea where Eric is now?<eos> Yeah. I pinged his cell. We got a location.<eos> Let's go pick him up.<eos> Evidence room.<eos> Yeah, this is Captain Beckett.<eos> Do we still have the seized heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case?<eos> Hang on. Let me check.<eos> Yeah, I'll hold.<eos> Yes, we do.
We're screwed.<eos> Catching him with that empty thumb drive was our whole conspiracy charge.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Did what work?<eos> Are you the one that turned the lights out?<eos> I-I told her to do that.<eos> Why in the hell would you do that?<eos> Well, I thought our "midnight run" stratagem needed a little twist.<eos> Trust me, guys... if this works, we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Got it.<eos> Uh, the stapler is not our enemy.<eos> Layout can't find the copy I sent down two hours ago.<eos> Because I... I forgot to send it, I'm so sorry.<eos> And... I just broke the stapler.<eos> Plus, Digital's now inundated because of the bombing story, I...<eos> How does Cat do it?<eos> She's Ms. Grant.<eos> And she has you.<eos> Well, so do you.
Because she felt you chose Superman over her.<eos> She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it,<eos> I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
How did you manage to project A thermally accurate 3d hologram of me Over 70 miles away?<eos> Technology from those kryptonians you're so scared of.<eos> I think I got its attention.<eos> That won't do anything.<eos> Telepathic relay interface, to control his cerebral matrix.<eos> If you want to stop him, you'll have to cease any Neural function from his creator.<eos> You'll have to kill me.<eos> You don't have to throw your life away...<eos> The red tornado is my life.<eos> You did it.
Me ke aloha menemene.<eos> Keahi, come here.<eos> Yeah, Mom?<eos> This is your daddy.<eos> Mahalo.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You just got here.<eos> Look, Steve, it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Previously, on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> What do you want from him!<eos> Gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets to a holding company he controls.<eos> Gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.<eos> Without it, we're both dead.<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
What had Phil Beskin done?<eos> In terms of the Great Work, we've had nigredo and albedo.<eos> The third stage is citrinitas.<eos> Associated with the male gender, the sun and yellow if that's any help.<eos> Play nice.<eos> I gather one of our key suspects in this case is a student, Nate Hedesan.<eos> You were keeping tabs on him?<eos> Yes, and I lost him, sir.<eos> To be fair, we don't know if there's any link between Nate Hedesan and Annapurna Kinneson.<eos> Actually, we do.
Right. I'd better get Djimon's arrest report written up.<eos> Calcium hydroxide's another name for lime.<eos> Sulphur and lime.<eos> Sulphur and lime.<eos> You think that's true?<eos> "Work alone is noble"?<eos> Bit outdated, isn't it?<eos> Being noble.<eos> I'm not sure I even know what it means any more.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Hey!<eos> No one rides my rides. It's all right.<eos> I needed a ride to order the helicopter, and Ray got me there.<eos> Just getting back now?<eos> All night bowling.<eos> Won every frame.<eos> That's incredible, Sylvester.<eos> You got on a motorcycle.<eos> I told you I'd get the job done.<eos> Yeah, you did, at... at that.
Between us, circle of trust?<eos> Maybe we just need a little medical nuance.<eos> Mr. Rosewood.<eos> Any chance of a free consult from Miami's finest?<eos> You want to see the best, you got to pay.<eos> Come on. Even doctor to doctor?<eos> 'Cause my B.P.'s down, got a little bit of a cold.<eos> Might be the sildenafil, which is funny.<eos> Guy who suggested it normally doesn't make mistakes.<eos> I didn't this time, either.
Through, say, a hidden door that's been sealed shut for 50 years.<eos> Could someone have followed Zac in through this door?<eos> No chance, I was closing up when Zac came in.<eos> He was alone, locked up right behind him.<eos> I'm assuming you have the security footage verifying all that.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Okay, now I really want to talk to the Noodle House mystery man find out who he is, and why he was fighting with Zac.<eos> Agreed. We'll ask the manager for the security footage for when Zac came in.<eos> Maybe we'll be able to spot the mystery man.<eos> Jake, we just did that.
Let's hope it's not my last.<eos> Next stop, outer space.<eos> Back away, you purple shitheads!<eos> Filthy animal.<eos> Run!<eos> Run, all of you! Run!<eos> Stay back, or this one dies.<eos> Let the kid go.<eos> Just put down your knife. Come on.<eos> Just do it.
You better not have broken into my place again.<eos> You gave me a key, remember?<eos> Who'd you think I was?<eos> You get a lot of men breaking in here?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I got the good stuff.<eos> I've got to be ready to go in, in case something breaks on the Sam Garper case.<eos> How did training go today?<eos> First time.<eos> Your guy did fine.
Do you understand?<eos> Anton...<eos> Bozek is in.<eos> He's willing to hold a referendum on autonomy in Eastern Ukraine?<eos> Provided you pull your troops out and it's supervised by the UN, yes.<eos> Bring the generals, and I'll bring Ukraine.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Well, Mike B's furious.<eos> He saw the picture, too?<eos> Of course he did.
I wish I could tell you that I couldn't remember everything that happened.<eos> But I do.<eos> So whenever it's quiet or dark or... anytime, really...<eos> I am back there... seeing it.<eos> Seeing what?<eos> Careful, Dash.<eos> More than any kid should ever have to.<eos> It was too much for too long to forget.<eos> And you want to forget.<eos> No, I don't.
Villa, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Just, please, can I just get two minutes with him?<eos> Fine. Two minutes. Two minutes.<eos> So, I understand you attended Fillmore.<eos> That's my mother's school.<eos> She was your principal.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Does she remember me?<eos> Of course she doesn't. Nobody does.
I mean, this is... this is ridiculous.<eos> Look, I told you to stop calling me Sammy.<eos> Take me back to the beginning.<eos> Lay it out for me.<eos> A few months ago, ATF busted two former Cal Tech grad students in West Covina for manufacturing Binetex.<eos> Okay. ATF already knew that they had sold 50 pounds of the explosives to a Filipino arms dealer named Ramon Santos.<eos> I was able to get in undercover as a middleman between Santos and Madison's guys.<eos> We set up a buy, everything was going smoothly until the sale went down.<eos> Then... you saw the rest.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Nobody knows how many there are or how big a group it is, but it's all over, not just in this country.<eos> It's everywhere, like a revolution.<eos> I had to help.<eos> Nick, H.W. needs grimms on their side, and I'm not the only one fighting for them.<eos> I worked with one in Lisbon, and... and I heard about another in Bangkok.<eos> You went to Lisbon?<eos> Twice.<eos> I never know where I'm going or what I'm supposed to do until I have to do it, but... I mean, there are sections of H.W. all over the world.<eos> Do they pay you for this?<eos> Actually, yeah, they do.
Have you seen this girl?<eos> WOMAN: No. Sorry.<eos> No?<eos> What about you, Mod Squad?<eos> How about you guys, have you seen this girl?<eos> YOUNG MAN: Hey, your costume's really cute.<eos> Thanks. I made it myself.<eos> Nice.<eos> YOUNG MAN: So how do you know Dave?<eos> I don't.
Fine, I quit, too!<eos> Then get out of my house!<eos> With pleasure!<eos> (sighs) Raj, wait.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> LEONARD: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<eos> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No, I do.
She needs F.F.P. and platelets immediately.<eos> We're gonna get Mrs. Hart up to an O.R. now to deliver.<eos> Do you know what's gonna happen to my baby?<eos> We're gonna do everything we can.<eos> Look, I know you're upset, but if Dr. Katz was here, she would tell you to do the same.<eos> - I have to wait for Adam.<eos> Maggie's the one who helped you after the bomb went off, right?<eos> She pinkie-sweared that the baby and I were gonna be okay.<eos> I did?<eos> Of course I did.
Is that your beat? I got an alert on my phone saying that the alarm went off,<eos> - okay? - Well, if we need a security guard, then we'll hire one.<eos> - Rafael, stop, he just came to help.<eos> - And how is he helping?<eos> He's the reason you need a security system in the first place; even Rose knew he was obsessed with you.<eos> That's why she took Mateo. Tell him to move on.<eos> Just tell him how you feel, Jane.<eos> Don't, Jane.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Don't, really, don't!
Alan can afford it.<eos> You do know who he is, right?<eos> Barry said he's a cardiologist.<eos> That's basically a side business.<eos> No, all of this was paid for by Yogurt Whimsy.<eos> The place next to Super Cuts?<eos> And Crown Books and Kay-Bee Toys, and a dozen other locations throughout North Jersey.<eos> He's even hinted there may be franchise opportunities for a few select close friends.<eos> You like frozen yogurt? God, no.<eos> Nobody does except for fatties and 14-year-olds.
And she risked her life to try to save those hostages.<eos> Will you give this to the D.A., please?<eos> I just want him to know.<eos> You doing okay?<eos> I was this close to violating one of my most sacred principles.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> That bomb was fake.<eos> That's because I knew you were coming.<eos> I just knew it.<eos> But what if I didn't?
There's just something about the water hitting the side of the boat.<eos> It's hypnotic.<eos> You fish?<eos> Let me take a wild guess.<eos> You want to run my gun for ballistics, see if it matches the bullet found at the crime scene.<eos> Are you ready to talk? He's lying.<eos> Okay, so you gonna tell me more or you just gonna go out on the mystery tip?<eos> Two seconds before that agent walked into his office, Hornstock's stress level was through the roof.<eos> Then he's in there talking about fishing and watching TV.<eos> Ira Hornstock doesn't do small talk.
I never saw your face.<eos> I never saw your face! I can't identify you, I promise.<eos> Let me out!<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Is this the Seattle morgue or a Milan catwalk?<eos> You like?<eos> It's my roommate's.<eos> I literally had nothing to wear until she gave me a free pass to raid her closet.<eos> I thought this was a good look for work because I wear this dress like someone's paying me to.<eos> Oh, as do I with this.
- NYPD!<eos> You're going down, idiot.<eos> I know, I was all jacked up on adrenaline and I lost control.<eos> According to The Ledger, that's standard operating procedure for you and your crew.<eos> - That article was just mean and...<eos> - So you sent death-threats to Terrence Van Doren and then ran his car into the Hudson with Isabel Van Doren inside.<eos> I was in bed with my wife when that crash happened.<eos> - You can ask her. - We will.<eos> Maybe one of your biker buddies wanted some highway justice, huh?<eos> They all did, but not with violence.
Hey, kermit.<eos> Two things you need to know.<eos> Hmm? I cannot work late tonight.<eos> I got to dump this possum i've been seeing.<eos> He's disgusting -- not 'cause he's a possum.<eos> Because he's in advertising.<eos> Yeah, well, i hope the second thing i need to know Is something i need to know.<eos> Yeah, fozzie asked me to remind you To read the sketch he wrote for the show.<eos> [ music continues ] [ sighs ] i already read it.<eos> I did, too.
! No! - Yeah, I have Yolanda, okay?<eos> Huh?<eos> You de Yolandee?<eos> Yo de Yolandee.<eos> Oh, now the guy with the funny accent has Yolanda?<eos> - H-unh! - I have Yolanda.<eos> I got her slippers with headlights so she can have her midnight snack in safety.<eos> Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, raise your hand if you have Yolanda.<eos> I did.
I mean, total drag.<eos> [ laughs ]<eos> Oh, yeah. Why, just this morning, I'm lying by the pool And my landscape designer starts bragging about his kids.<eos> Don't you hate it when that happens?<eos> Uh, we don't have those.<eos> What, landscape designers?<eos> Landscapes.<eos> Well, you don't have to imagine how annoying it is To be held captive by some blowhard<eos> Yapping about their personal life.<eos> We certainly don't.
Or have you decided you want to be part of your own relationship?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not getting her anything.<eos> She said she didn't want a gift.<eos> - Oh, is that what she said?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hmm. Let me look that up in my lady translator.<eos> - What? - Boop-boop-boop-boop.<eos> Ah, look at that.. She wants a gift.<eos> - She does?
It's, um...<eos> Oh gee, this is awkward.<eos> Uh, I mean you're the last person...<eos> Quit sputtering and muttering and stammering and boring me.<eos> Just spit it out, frog.<eos> Can you give us a minute, Deadly?<eos> Kermit.<eos> You seem to be under the false impression that I want to be in this room.<eos> - Huh? - You don't know me.<eos> No one does.
I solved his problems by forcing him to love his body.<eos> Nobody wants to hear that sort of thing from their mother.<eos> Well, if that's true, then I suppose he needs to hear it from his father.<eos> Or his grandfather.<eos> I'm not saying that weird stuff to the boy.<eos> We keep it loose.<eos> Murray, you need to do this!<eos> Now go up there and tell him he has a beautiful body before he believes he doesn't.<eos> And so my dad set off to tell me I had a beautiful body.<eos> Hey. Uh... How you doing?
You've done enough.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> You got yourself into something, right?<eos> Tell me what. Let me help you.<eos> What do you know about underground boxing?<eos> Human dog fighting. People die.<eos> You don't want to bet on that.<eos> No, no, no. I didn't bet on it.<eos> I did it.
I just need to help Steven to get us out of here!<eos> Mother knows best!<eos> Steven, come on!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - We're trapped.<eos> We don't have to be.<eos> Really, Mom, I know how to do this.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Ugh!<eos> Yes, she does.
Darling, I-I mean, I know it's difficult for you without Katherine, but really, isn't it a little early in the day for this?<eos> These are for Ryan and Esposito.<eos> They get the results of their sergeant's exam today, so I thought I'd drop down to the precinct, surprise them a little later on.<eos> And if Beckett happens to be there...<eos> All the more reason to celebrate.<eos> Hey, so, any word on the exam?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - You're gonna jinx it.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Done.
You've been very helpful.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sometimes you let up the rug, it's nothing but spic-and-span.<eos> Hey, you need a ride to Med tomorrow?<eos> I was gonna ask my neighbor.<eos> And not your partner?<eos> I should hit you upside the head right now.<eos> I'm taking you.<eos> Aww, you care.<eos> Of course I do.
She's been notified.<eos> I'm Adam.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Look, I don't know what to say here. I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He trusted you.<eos> - Hey, you Ben Forsick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How do you know Roxy Richards?<eos> - I don't.
Wait, you don't have authority to go in...<eos> That's a no-knock warrant.<eos> Get on the phone. Call your boss. Tell him the FBI wants to talk with Crispin Crandall.<eos> What the hell is this place?<eos> We're not going to wait to find out.<eos> I wanna talk to Charlie Volkens.<eos> You got any idea where you are, sport?<eos> You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton, he has nothing to do with this.<eos> Yeah, he does.
That's a no-knock warrant.<eos> Get on the phone. Call your boss. Tell him the FBI wants to talk with Crispin Crandall.<eos> What the hell is this place?<eos> We're not going to wait to find out.<eos> I wanna talk to Charlie Volkens.<eos> You got any idea where you are, sport?<eos> You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton, he has nothing to do with this.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> Tonight he does.
And don't pretend you're just here for a steam.<eos> All right.<eos> Fine. We're here to ask you a few questions about your relationships with Scott McCoy.<eos> Call our lawyers, honey.<eos> I will... right after I drag you down to the precinct.<eos> You can post a photo on Instagram.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you really had anything on us, you wouldn't be down here trying to see us naked.<eos> Oh, we've got something.<eos> Or... rather, one of you does.
You're not even trying to hurt me.<eos> We are just making it look good.<eos> And that gronhak up there is gonna figure that out.<eos> We need to have a real fight.<eos> Unless maybe you've lost your edge?<eos> Afraid you can't handle me?<eos> I'm Thanos' daughter!<eos> I worked for Ronan.<eos> Tell me you never wondered if I had something to do with the destruction of your family!<eos> I didn't, but...
First, Alan York, the astronaut, went missing.<eos> Then, there was Tim Addis, heir to the Addis timber fortune.<eos> Followed closely by Colin Andrews, a tech pioneer who was last seen jogging in Seward Park.<eos> We want a download on Terrence Fowler.<eos> I understand he's missing now, and he fits the profile.<eos> Fowler's wife, Taylor, was a murder-for-hire. I figured he took off, given the suspicion that he was somehow involved.<eos> But my APB got no hits.<eos> I'd like to take a look at anything you have on him.<eos> - If you don't mind.<eos> - He doesn't.
Oh, my God!<eos> These are the most beautiful earrings I've ever seen.<eos> I picked them out.<eos> Happy housewarming/ Merry Christmas.<eos> You really shouldn't have done this.<eos> They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
Kanan, why didn't you tell us there were more of 'em?<eos> Commander Sato is going to need a full report on this.<eos> Well, we did get the medical supplies.<eos> Some of them.<eos> Well, that's good news.<eos> I'll meet you three on the command deck.<eos> - Kanan, they knew about Ahsoka.<eos> - I'll tell her.<eos> Did you know there was more than one?<eos> No, I didn't.
Uh... It's okay.<eos> We're on at 4:00 A.M.<eos> Our core demo is truckers clocking on and hookers clocking off.<eos> Well, both are welcome here at Cattleman's.<eos> I mean, as customers, not...<eos> we don't encourage prostitution.<eos> Is this a sting?<eos> Because you have to show me your badge if I ask you.<eos> Boss, their show is on Channel 7... you know, with the duck.<eos> - That does the weather.
Yeah.<eos> Something about... sending them off to live happily ever after.<eos> Alone and in peace.<eos> And what's the nonfiction?<eos> Can't say, Henry.<eos> You know that.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, we all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> Yeah, well, who didn't?
One second.<eos> I go kitchen, get your order.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Boom.<eos> What'd I tell ya?<eos> I'm not buying the accent.<eos> What's to buy?<eos> Russell, most people who work in a Chinese restaurant have an accent.<eos> But not all of them do, and yet all of them do.
What in God's name?<eos> Die!<eos> Die!<eos> No!<eos> How did I get here?<eos> Look at all of you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What can you want?<eos> Do I give a damn?<eos> I do.
Okay, pray for me.<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> Didn't quite work out like we planned, but I did get that staple in his head.<eos> You have to understand I did it for the right reasons.<eos> - I was just looking out for my family, but... you're my family, too.<eos> You know what the best part of tonight was?<eos> It wasn't just me against Earl.<eos> It was us against him.<eos> I liked that.<eos> I did too. Yeah.
Bye.<eos> So... Been a crazy couple of days.<eos> Darn tootin'.<eos> But you've been great.<eos> I really appreciate all your hard work.<eos> And, uh... Sorry if I was a little tough on ya.<eos> You mean you treating me like a punching bag? It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
So only dead people get to see him?<eos> And this makes sense to billions of you?<eos> It is the nature of faith.<eos> It's -- it's all here.<eos> The mercy of God, his love the world and mankind, his -- his perfect plan for us.<eos> Manipulation.<eos> You only believe what he wants you to believe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't know what he is like at all.<eos> We certainly do.
Be a good person for once.<eos> I think about it a lot.<eos> Killing myself.<eos> I have ever since I was a child.<eos> A lot of times, I think the world would be a much better place without me in it.<eos> But I don't do it.<eos> You're a better woman than me.<eos> And if I don't deserve to die, then you definitely don't.<eos> I'm sorry you feel alone in your pain, but so do I.<eos> So does everybody.
So...<eos> What you need from me is... ?<eos> Time.<eos> I need you to stall.<eos> See, that right there, that's where I get lost.<eos> I've got zero, zippo, nada to do with these negotiations other than cheering them on from the sideline...<eos> If you were to let it slip that you had reservations about the treaty...<eos> But I don't.<eos> I assure you, Mr. President...<eos> But if you did.
Right.<eos> Jake, I looked into my father's eyes, and I saw something I have never seen before.<eos> What's that?<eos> Fear.<eos> Jake.<eos> Have you ever... lied to someone's face when your back was completely against the wall to get what you wanted?<eos> Have you ever looked someone in the eye and made them think you loved them? Really truly loved them so you could take whatever it is you needed from them?<eos> I believe him.<eos> My gut says he's telling the truth.<eos> Of course it does.
We needed time before.<eos> We never had a chance.<eos> I told you.<eos> Before.<eos> If we're already broken going in, then --<eos> I was unavailable before.<eos> You liked me unavailable.<eos> I don't know you available.<eos> She got this side of you.<eos> She did this part.
The trees are our best bet.<eos> That way.<eos> What if it's a trap?<eos> It's not a trap, it's a beacon.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Following your tattoos got us here and got us shot at.<eos> The tattoos led to Guerrero.<eos> Why send us out here just to kill us?<eos> How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment - to see the derricks?<eos> - They didn't.
Commissioners of every league deal with angry messages all the time.<eos> You know, you had every right to veto that Aaron Rodgers trade.<eos> I mean, that would've been collusion.<eos> Any commissioner would've vetoed that trade.<eos> But that must've been the last straw for Ross, who wasn't happy with you as commissioner.<eos> That's why Ross went to confront you at the sandwich shop.<eos> And when you didn't approve the Aaron Rodgers trade, he was gonna oust you as commissioner.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> That's when a fight escalated. You grabbed your little meat holder there and stabbed him two times.<eos> How did you...?
Just like he said.<eos> The problem is everybody thinks he's something he's not.<eos> Wow. I got to say, uh,<eos> I didn't think that you would be useful in... any way.<eos> But... this is huge.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eh. Anybody could've done it.<eos> Right place at the right time. No. You put in the work.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> Why did you do that?
I have a feeling he bought himself time.<eos> You have a feeling?<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry. I haven't told Sinclair anything... Yet.<eos> I have some questions.<eos> Of course.<eos> Frank helped you, right?<eos> It's not like you and Annalise carried that body into the woods.<eos> He did.
You're not gonna get me drunk and convince me to sign this deal.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't know who killed Sam Keating.<eos> Not for sure, at least.<eos> That was a stall tactic, a very smart one.<eos> I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
They assume it.<eos> When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like,<eos> "John Mulaney bull?"<eos> And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore.<eos> They'll still say it.<eos> 'Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but...<eos> But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow?<eos> Let's be real. Why buy the cow?<eos> Because you love her.<eos> You really do.
- It's the butthole.<eos> - Yeah, no, I got that.<eos> Yeah, I gotta go... To a comic book store opening.<eos> Because that's the kind of thing... That I do.<eos> - Episode 10 - "Thank You for Your Service"<eos> Excuse me, I think I found it...<eos> - How you guys doing?<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> About time, I'm sorry. I'm about to come a little late.<eos> How you doing?
- Yeah, no, I got that.<eos> Yeah, I gotta go... To a comic book store opening.<eos> Because that's the kind of thing... That I do.<eos> - Episode 10 - "Thank You for Your Service"<eos> Excuse me, I think I found it...<eos> - How you guys doing?<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> About time, I'm sorry. I'm about to come a little late.<eos> How you doing?<eos> How you doing?
I mean, I don't get PTSD, but you know...<eos> Actually, if you play long enough, you will dream about it.<eos> So...<eos> I can see that I'm upsetting you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just want to say... Thank you for your service.<eos> Yeah, what service are you thanking me for?<eos> Your service... It's empty if you don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You went to Kabul, right?<eos> - Yes, I did.
You're on your own.<eos> You walk around here like nothing's changed. Like we're still those two guys who used to meet for burgers when we both pulled the graveyard shift. But a lie of omission is still a lie.<eos> Whatever's going on with you just came down on me like the hand of God.<eos> You might be fine with whatever shade of charcoal this is, but I sure as hell am not.<eos> And I wish I could tell you, Cal. But I can't. That is a choice.<eos> You get to make that choice.<eos> But so do I.<eos> Today I crossed a line I never thought I would. I'm pretty sure I broke the law.<eos> I damn well know I broke my own moral code.<eos> I did it for you.
And it's expensive, too.<eos> Listen, I'd like us to be able to just talk about anything tonight.<eos> Just anything we want. Go ahead.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> - I have this reoccurring dream, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Where, um, I'm sick, and-and someone's taking care of me.<eos> But I've never been able to see their face. Hmm!<eos> But last night, last night, I did.
- I don't know.<eos> - Sooner the better, I say.<eos> The suitcase distracted him, but he's a dog with a bone about Rebecca.<eos> Don't you think I know that?<eos> I'll handle him the way I always do.<eos> Right now, I have to go handle a bitch.<eos> Ms. Keating, did we have an appointment?<eos> I thought your schedule would be clear now that your star witness has abandoned you.<eos> Mr. Millstone and I still have to talk about that.<eos> No, you don't.
Is that my Dante?<eos> You need to step aside--<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Can you imagine the amount of pain you've caused this poor woman?<eos> My mom's house. You're in my house.<eos> It was clever of you to use her love of sweepstakes to bring in a RAT-ed computer so you could watch her.<eos> Socially engineering and spying on your own mother?<eos> It doesn't get lower than that. Now, now, Avery Ryan.<eos> You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> Actually, I do, Dante Wilkerson.
And I'm feeling amazing.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Get the prize out of the cereal again?<eos> [Laughs] No, I'm feeling amazing because I thought about Celina Balstrom and Nelson Cortez.<eos> I mean, Vera Leona, Moshe Finkleman...<eos> Those are the people that we... People that laid on that table and depended on me to help them, to find the answers that solved their murders.<eos> I did that.<eos> Me.<eos> So I'm not staying just because I worry about you.<eos> Which I do.
- I remember when my father bounced me on his knee.<eos> I remember when I fell in love with my best friend.<eos> I remember my 17th birthday.<eos> - I remember getting arrested.<eos> - Would you cut it out?<eos> I remember trying pot for the first time.<eos> Coke.<eos> I remember the first time I kissed someone.<eos> I remember that time I saw "Titanic".<eos> Ah, you did, didn't you?
There's seven of us.<eos> Six. Dopey's still a tree.<eos> We may be down a dwarf, but we're ready to fight.<eos> You won't have to.<eos> I'm going to take care of this.<eos> You think you can talk him out of this?<eos> There's no talking. We have to hit him with everything we've got.<eos> Well, it's not his fault.<eos> He didn't want to become the Dark One.<eos> But he did because of me.
I found an option.<eos> She's funny and cute, and she actively contributes to public safety.<eos> She's one of the firefighters?<eos> Yes.<eos> And she's great.<eos> And I think that she thinks I'm great, but I need you to find out.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why don't you write her a little note... you know, the ones with the boxes that you can check... and I'll pass it along.<eos> Don't you think that sounds a little childish?<eos> Yes, it does!
- It's not funny, Graham.<eos> It's never funny.<eos> You better stop, or I'm going to tell Mom.<eos> - You are?<eos> You're going to tell Mom that I did this?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> - And so this was three years ago?<eos> That would explain why the piano teacher dropped out midway through that season.<eos> So did Graham.
We went to the local precinct.<eos> There's no paperwork, no police reports.<eos> Nobody knows anything about Graham, but they all knew that we were up here.<eos> Okay, copy that.<eos> - What'd she say?<eos> - To watch our backs.<eos> - Check this out.<eos> Driving while NYPD.<eos> - License and registration?<eos> - How you doing, officer?
Yeah.<eos> Well, what I didn't tell you was how things started out between them.<eos> The day after their wedding, my grandfather was drafted into the Japanese navy and spent the next three years on a ship while my grandmother waited without any word from him.<eos> And neither of them ever stopped believing they would be together.<eos> And you know the rest.<eos> They were married for 60 years, had five children, plenty of grandchildren.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I want the same for us, Kono.<eos> You just have to believe.<eos> I do.
We're not allowed past this.<eos> When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is.<eos> Oh, give me a break.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Look, this is very real and very important in PC culture.<eos> Every human has a right to a safe space.<eos> It cannot be entered.<eos> Yeah, it can.<eos> Watch.<eos> Wow, how did you --
We have a tonnage issue with insanity in this country.<eos> And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.<eos> And a conventional defensive strategy isn't gonna cut it.<eos> Which is why we have to be creative like them.<eos> But unless you're here to tell me that you found...<eos> I did.
There.<eos> Looks like our dike sprung a leak.<eos> - He's bleeding.<eos> I think we can get away with a collarbone incision.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Claire, Dad, this is Dr. Zanetti.<eos> Russel is being prepped for surgery right now, and she and I will perform the operation.<eos> Okay.<eos> You must have a lot of faith in him.<eos> I do.
Theft.<eos> Uh, Kristen, this is our investigator Jason.<eos> Hi.<eos> But I didn't steal anything.<eos> Yes, but it was the reason for the polygraph.<eos> They caught you in another lie, but...<eos> They need corroborating evidence.<eos> Right.<eos> And they couldn't have fired her unless they already had some evidence that she lied on her résumé.<eos> Did they, Kristen?
It'd be interesting.<eos> So, you don't mind if I'm a bit late?<eos> Not if you're only with gay Martin.<eos> Oh, he's not gay.<eos> Isn't he? No!<eos> It's an ironic nickname because he's the least homosexual man you can possibly imagine.<eos> He's gorgeous and Spanish.<eos> All the women fancy him.<eos> Is he?<eos> Do they?
Right.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Look, I'm no longer gonna demand you be my sidekick.<eos> I know I'm not the alpha or the beta.<eos> I'm whatever comes last in the Greek letters. I think it's zorbo.<eos> See, ever since I was a little boy, I wanted a dog like you.<eos> Not 'cause you could jet-ski or break-dance or deflect grenades with your paws.<eos> I just wanted a friend.<eos> And I didn't have many growing up.<eos> But I do now.
You can't bring her back, but you can save lives by ending this war.<eos> The only reason you're breathing... is because you're no good to me dead.<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Reaper, don't do this.<eos> Yo, you better stay out the way.<eos> They killed Imani!<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
No, I don't... I don't think so.<eos> I guess I thought she left.<eos> I probably would've.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> That she's the one person I...<eos> I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to shut it off.<eos> Shut what off?<eos> How I feel... - Yeah.<eos> - About her.<eos> I don't...
Arlo Glowstick.<eos> Look at all these happy fathers and sons, with their perfectly matching tails.<eos> Oh, it's... it's... it's so beautiful.<eos> Maurice, I want a baby.<eos> You want a what?<eos> I want a miniature version of me with matching tail rings to love and hold and name.<eos> Move it Maurice, the baby isn't gonna make itself.<eos> Go get me one!<eos> King Julien, you do know where babies come from, right?<eos> Of course I do, Maurice.
I'm not going to do this.<eos> That's the stuff.<eos> King Julien?<eos> Hi, King Julien.<eos> [Julien] Uh, King Julien's not here, Martian who sounds like Clover.<eos> Ahem, it is Clover, Your Majesty.<eos> King Julien, this is amazing!<eos> You've found the first Pan troglodytes ever recorded on the island.<eos> Is that another word for Martian?<eos> Because then yes, I did. No, King Julien.
That's why I've decided to close Club Moist, the nightclub.<eos> And open instead Club Moist, the hospital.<eos> Great idea, right?<eos> A hospital?<eos> Gee, how'd you come up with that?<eos> You know, I don't know.<eos> It just came to me.<eos> It's like the gods cracked open my head and just screamed it real loud.<eos> But, uh, King Julien, we don't have any doctors.<eos> Ah, but we do, Clover.
Let me take you.<eos> Mommy's got to go to work.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay. Bye-bye.<eos> Surprise.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi. So, is this a six-month anniversary surprise?<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> - Because you didn't know.<eos> - I did.
- Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Plates in the sink.<eos> If you want comic book time, go.<eos> I got yours.<eos> And for the record, I only use that word when the Islanders cheat.<eos> You mean when the Rangers cheat.<eos> Okay. Thanks for letting me stay for dinner.<eos> I needed a little family time after today.<eos> No worries. I did too.
He walked to the gallows with the same air about him.<eos> Cocksure of himself, he was.<eos> And he were a murderer.<eos> Someone get her away from that window.<eos> Well, don't blame me if we're all murdered in our beds.<eos> Thanks, Mama.<eos> Thank you, Pa.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> - Don't you like it?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Where am I to get my hands on that kind of money?<eos> I'm sure you'll think of something.<eos> Does Amelia Haversham know that you are seeing your captain?<eos> She is my friend.<eos> And does she approve?<eos> True friends do not pass judgment on each other.<eos> And if he isn't promoted and remains penniless, will you desist in seeing him?<eos> He will get his promotion, then he will call on Father officially to ask for his blessing.<eos> Fortunately, I don't need yours.<eos> No, you don't.
Use it as you will.<eos> I want every penny back that belongs to me.<eos> Bill, my dear, thank goodness,<eos> I've been trying to get word to you all day.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I thought you should know, Mr Bucket is looking for you.<eos> Here, was he?<eos> A fleeting visit.<eos> Funny he came here looking, when all the time he knew where I lived.<eos> He did?
Noah?<eos> So you say you called her boyfriend?<eos> Peter.<eos> He's more like a friend.<eos> They've known each other since pre-K.<eos> He hadn't seen or heard from Lily all day.<eos> Is this her iPad?<eos> What's the password?<eos> She doesn't have a password.<eos> Yeah, she does.
He doted on those children.<eos> In hindsight...<eos> You think he wanted you to meet your half-siblings?<eos> Maybe.<eos> On the drive home, he bought us both ice creams, and he kept making us promise not to tell our mother that we ran into...<eos> Stella.<eos> That was her name. Stella.<eos> Does she have a last name?<eos> I don't remember that, but she used to work in the museum.<eos> But she probably still does.
I want my life sentence reduced to time served.<eos> I want to walk out of here a free man.<eos> Open up.<eos> I knew Sean was mixed up in something.<eos> But I never imagined this.<eos> He went to the FBI.<eos> He was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And it got him shot.<eos> Do you have children, Agent Gibbs?<eos> I did.
I never saw that little...<eos> I never saw that little boy before in my life.<eos> Do you have any idea why his body was found in a building you managed?<eos> Well, that building was full of... of ex-cons,<eos> _ - welfare cheats drug addicts. The whole neighborhood was like a war zone.<eos> I don't even know where to begin. It was terrible.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Hodda.<eos> You were the manager of the building, though.<eos> Did you order the concrete or did the drug addicts?<eos> I did.
I know.<eos> It's just I didn't even know anything terrible happened until afterwards.<eos> And that... that kind of made it worse.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have told you.<eos> Stop, this isn't about me.<eos> This is about you and you can tell me anything.<eos> You know that.<eos> I know.<eos> You know how much I love you, right?<eos> I do.
He's head of the biggest crime syndicate in Seattle.<eos> So all this Santa delivers to our city is crime.<eos> Can I help you, Detective?<eos> Do you know these two men?<eos> Carlos Rena and Jerry Byrd.<eos> No. I can't say that I do.<eos> Do you know anything about a vigilante crime fighter who called himself "The Fog"?<eos> - The Frog?<eos> - The Fog.<eos> No, I don't.
I mean, why would anyone choose to be alone, when they could live in a world with people?<eos> That's what Phil chose to do.<eos> 'Cause the way we were treating him, that alternative seemed better than sticking around here.<eos> Maybe you guys don't remember what it felt like out there.<eos> How lonely, how sad, how pointless life was.<eos> Well, I remember.<eos> 'Cause I almost had to go back to that.<eos> But somehow, I got a second chance.<eos> Look, I deserve everything I got, you know?<eos> And in a way, Phil does, too.
What... What is a thyroid storm?<eos> A side effect of thyroid meds is weight loss.<eos> Sometimes patients abuse those meds to get thin, but the excessive hormones in the blood can reach toxic levels.<eos> It's called a thyroid storm.<eos> It can cause heart failure and abnormal rhythms.<eos> Aubrey, we've noticed from your medical records that you've lost quite a few pounds over the last year.<eos> From diet and exercise.<eos> You don't have a prescription for thyroid medication, but we've known some girls to sneak their mom's pills.<eos> Do you have a prescription, Mrs. Clark?<eos> Yes, I do.

Hey!<eos> What?<eos> - My Dad's not coming till the morning, OK, my love?<eos> -Henry.<eos> Yeah, yeah, which means we've got all night, yeah?<eos> OK, yeah, yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> By the way, I have cold sores.<eos> Do you really?<eos> I didn't...
- You ever do any cycling?<eos> - No, Chief.<eos> I can't say I've done much.<eos> Until drugs corrupted the hell out of it, it was a great sport.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> It's one of the few sports that focuses on a team of individuals.<eos> You see, the cyclist needs the rest of his team to get out in front, provide a wake, so he can draft on them.<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.

- It's a black thing.<eos> Yo, are you the guy? For the job?<eos> Erm, what?<eos> I'm supposed to be talking to someone.<eos> Oh, Connor Jones.<eos> Jethro, store manager.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you'd be older.<eos> It says on your CV you were previously a pilot?<eos> My mum done it.
Hey!<eos> What did I do?<eos> Are you getting pulled over by this guy?<eos> - No, I don't know, this is unbelievable.<eos> - You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - What'd I do?<eos> - Huh. Look who it is.<eos> Hey, Officer Collins.<eos> Uh, did your son win his game?<eos> Yeah, he did actually.
Mitch Grinder may be gone, but the grind goes on.<eos> Justice has a new first name.<eos> Timothy Olyphant is Rake Grinder.<eos> That son of a bitch.<eos> The Grinder:<eos> New Orleans.<eos> The Big Easy... just got hard.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well, I don't think he needed that.<eos> No, he did not.
Damn.<eos> Such a pro.<eos> You're already in character.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm in what?<eos> It's kind of a relief, actually. I thought I was gonna have to apologize for stealing your show.<eos> I'll see you on the dance floor.<eos> You ought to get back there. This stuff's free.<eos> - Quiet all around!<eos> - I hate to admit it, but Olyphant's got something.<eos> Yes, he certainly does.
- Our mom. ...our mom said died in childbirth?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Only I didn't die.<eos> I... I grew up.<eos> Evil.<eos> Wow.<eos> And that's why I slipped rat poison into your drink earlier.<eos> And you're going to be dead... any minute now.<eos> So you want me to die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Is anyone even listening to me?<eos> Anyway, just get your head together.<eos> OK, and have a long, hard think about yourself.<eos> I mean, married to a drunk!<eos> Pardon.<eos> - My tits hurt.<eos> - Get over here.<eos> They hate us here.<eos> We're scum!<eos> No, they don't.
She was looking for something.<eos> She find it?<eos> Not on my phone.<eos> Careful about this stuff.<eos> We learned that your boyfriend was having an affair with Klarissa Mott.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> You have to be kidding me.<eos> Kidding?<eos> No, we don't do that.
Really?<eos> Is that all you got left, Deeks?<eos> You're about as defiant as my eight-year-old.<eos> Wow. You have kids?<eos> Whew. Did not see that coming, Mommie Dearest.<eos> Hey, uh, quick question-- are we sure this coffee was made this week?<eos> We found new DNA evidence that places you in the hotel room where Boyle was killed.<eos> Well, that makes sense, since I stayed there for a week while my house was being tented.<eos> We can play this however you want, but you're not going anywhere until you tell me why you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't. Then who did?
And I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I'm a genius.<eos> And you'd be right.<eos> Because you know what Quinn wanted to do?<eos> He wanted to put it in a bus locker.<eos> Our stuff wouldn't fit in a bus locker.<eos> No, I didn't... I didn't say "bus locker."<eos> I said "bus lockers," plural.<eos> He wanted to put it all over town.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> You never did.
Well, it's secure.<eos> Compliments of tar...<eos> As long as I use anonymizing software to route my traffic, I'm invisible.<eos> This won't be fast.<eos> Got to go to the profile page for each individual employee.<eos> We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Well, there's no work around.<eos> We don't have enough info on him to narrow him down.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe we do.
- I know someone.<eos> I can make a phone call.<eos> Not murder!<eos> - Oh, look, it's Forrest Gump.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Hello.<eos> We were just looking for something.<eos> Yeah, I... I... I lost something.<eos> - I don't think we'll ever find it, do you?<eos> - No, no, I don't.
Oh, no, wait.<eos> Oh, we're too late.<eos> Applications closed yesterday.<eos> I know.<eos> I've already applied for you.<eos> You've got an interview on Tuesday.<eos> Jeez, any more revelations?<eos> Just go along and do the interview.<eos> It'll be good practice. And if you don't get it, nothing lost.<eos> - And if I do?
I wanted to find you, but I guess you found me first.<eos> I know you, don't I?<eos> Uh, you remember?<eos> You were pretty small back then.<eos> I was the governor of Lothal.<eos> I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.
- The Lobster Roll.<eos> - What about it?<eos> I want to buy it with you.<eos> I know you've got your own cash, 'cause I know what you sold your house for, okay?<eos> Is this your daughter?<eos> - Yeah, uh, Gigi, I think...<eos> - She's beautiful.<eos> Everybody says she looks like Alison, but to me, she looks like her daddy.<eos> You know what?<eos> She does to me too.
Here's my question for you.<eos> Reason I got in touch.<eos> Whose money did she use to make that down payment?<eos> 'Cause if it's yours, you can just call the bank and void the check, right?<eos> No, we don't have a joint account.<eos> If she wrote a check, it's her money.<eos> What kind of married people don't share a fucking bank account?<eos> We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do.
Do you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course, don't you?<eos> I...<eos> I love you.<eos> You love me. We got a kid together.<eos> Let's stop making things so difficult for ourselves.<eos> Let's get married and settle down, be happy, be normal, raise a family.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Seth took those drugs himself.<eos> That's not the point, Jared.<eos> It is the point, people party.<eos> It is not on us.<eos> Just... hey, you just gotta take a breath.<eos> All right, we need to make a plan for what to say if the cops have questions.<eos> Well, I was thinking we would just tell the truth.<eos> Or we stick as close to the truth as possible.<eos> All right, first they're gonna ask - if we had permits and security.<eos> - Which we did.
And I can make sure that your name is plastered all over that case.<eos> The only proof you have of my connection to anything is that I attended those parties.<eos> No, because Carter can testify otherwise.<eos> So it's the word of a taxpaying business-owner against a high school dropout, yeah, I'll take my chances.<eos> Plus, you're law enforcement.<eos> Your own kid's involved.<eos> You wouldn't take the chance lying to the DA.<eos> Did Carter ever tell you I kidnapped her?<eos> Twice.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Anything for you, sweetie.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought I had it all under control.<eos> I know you did.<eos> I guess I didn't want to need anyone.<eos> Carter, I understand you wanting to take care of yourself after everything you've been through.<eos> It's really tough to need people.<eos> But I do.
Bye.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought I had it all under control.<eos> I know you did.<eos> I guess I didn't want to need anyone.<eos> Carter, I understand you wanting to take care of yourself after everything you've been through.<eos> It's really tough to need people.<eos> But I do.<eos> And I do, too.
About an hour ago.<eos> Ship's captain found the bodies, called Port Authority.<eos> This was an execution.<eos> They're all part of the same crew.<eos> What do we know about the ship they came in on?<eos> Arrived a couple hours ago.<eos> Originated from Shanghai.<eos> We checked the manifest-- four containers are missing.<eos> How'd they get past security?<eos> They didn't.
Here, look, there's good news.<eos> When you're done with the test, you can go directly to your homes or wherever it is that you choose to go.<eos> Just, uh, please hand the test to me, okay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Right when you finish.<eos> I'll be right there waiting.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's gonna be fun, everybody.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
No, I'm-I'm not really a teacher.<eos> I definitely was not this stupid when I was in college.<eos> Yeah, Don't Do Drugs just got a new mascot.<eos> Hey, that weed wasn't mine.<eos> I was just burning it for a friend.<eos> Okay, first of all, I don't believe that.<eos> But more importantly, we do not care about the weed, okay?<eos> You don't?<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Jimmy, I'm serious.<eos> And why did you send a picture back?<eos> Someone sends me a nude picture, I send them one back.<eos> - It's called manners.<eos> - There's more to it than that. It's a big deal to send someone a nude photo of yourself.<eos> It means something.<eos> Not to my generation.<eos> You know how us millennials are.<eos> But you know what, if it means something to you, that must mean that you care about Bruce.<eos> Maybe I do.
No, no, this is it.<eos> Friggin' piece of crap.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It was pretty amazing, huh?<eos> Well, I mean, it's no Hope Diamond. What?<eos> I gave him the friggin'<eos> Hope Diamond to give to her! That's a $350 million diamond, Carol. He gives her this stupid piece of medical equipment?<eos> It's so cold and impersonal. And I'll tell you this much. I am done trying to help this turd.<eos> I set him up for the victory and he just tinkles on it. - I'm so done with him.<eos> Just done, D...
That's easy-- forgiveness.<eos> Forgiveness for what?<eos> For not telling you something I should've told you a long time ago.<eos> And I fully recognize this is the most bizarre of circumstances and the weirdest timing to have this conversation.<eos> What conversation, exactly?<eos> The whole Internal Affairs investigation.<eos> I... was trying to protect you and trying to protect NCIS, because... because John Quinn didn't kill Boyle. I did, and I did it to protect Tiffany.<eos> I know.<eos> What do you mean you know?<eos> No, you don't.
- Kitty Kat, make me some mac and chee.<eos> Not the spiral kind, that makes me dizzy. [slap] [giggles]<eos> Hey, so how about that fight?<eos> Big Skillet's gonna kill that pasty booze-bag.<eos> Hey, where's your loyalty?<eos> You're white.<eos> So what?<eos> Black dudes are cool.<eos> You ever seen one naked?<eos> I do all the time.
Well, sometimes a man's gotta do...<eos> - what a man does.<eos> - What a man does.<eos> [distorted static] [gunfire] Ay, Chihuahua!<eos> [audio sizzling] [static hissing]<eos> - I ain't buying this piece of shit. - What the fuck is this?<eos> Jesus, Chuck, what in the hell is wrong with all these TVs?<eos> [stammers] I don't know, Dad.<eos> We never had a problem with these before.<eos> Well, we sure as shit do now!
Used to.<eos> Then I really got into Brutal Mercy.<eos> Which is where you connected with the defendant.<eos> Yeah, TheAlgea.<eos> Yeah, that's his screen name.<eos> The Greek spirits of pain and suffering.<eos> I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
Go to hell. Oh, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not that I needed it, but you just gave me cause to fire you. Gentlemen.<eos> Buh-bye.<eos> God, that was fun.<eos> They were out less than 15 minutes.<eos> Is that a good or bad thing?<eos> It means the jury was swayed powerfully, but I have no idea if it was by the judge's instructions.<eos> Madam foreperson, do we have a verdict?<eos> We do, Your Honor.
Or have I got to sit and listen to you two talk about legwarmers all day?<eos> Sorry, man. Steven, do you want a cup of tea before we start?<eos> There's a lot to get through.<eos> You're not lying.<eos> Jesus Christ, what the hell is this?<eos> The Bible?<eos> Well, that's exactly what it is.<eos> We're recording an audiobook of the Bible.<eos> Your agent not tell you?<eos> No, she didn't.
- Ready?<eos> It's bad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tried putting some ice on it.<eos> Let's get you fixed up.<eos> Did you find the other us in time?<eos> I couldn't get to me, but I found you.<eos> I told him to look for Goldenmire.<eos> - I just hope he listened. He was really off his face.<eos> - Oh, so do I.
No, no, no, no.<eos> No, I-<eos> - I was--<eos> I got cursed.<eos> - Is it not the same thing?<eos> - No, it's not the same-- I mean, between you and me, yes, but between normal people, it's not the same.<eos> It's something else.<eos> Maestro Rivera, he asked me to go back to Mexico and take his place.<eos> - You accepted?<eos> - No, I did not.
Oh, baloney!<eos> If it was a werewolf, you need to stop screwing with us and let us know!<eos> Do I have to close my bar?<eos> ! What about my market?<eos> Y'all know me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.<eos> Okay, you don't.<eos> Just got to town this morning.<eos> But y'all know how I earn a living.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
Whatever the case, for $25,000, I'll find this beast for you.<eos> I'll catch it, and kill it... for $75,000.<eos> (all murmuring) Oh, what, you want people staying at your cute BBs, buying up all your antiques, eating up all your artisanal mayonnaise?<eos> Then I suggest you pony up.<eos> Or you can take your chance and, uh, roll the dice!<eos> Thank you for that offer, Neon Joe.<eos> We will take it under advisement.<eos> Uh, he-yump. You make up your mind, you let me know.<eos> Y'all know where to find me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
But the results you get in your triceps and abs will be your reward.<eos> That's how you buckercise!<eos> Yeeee-he-yump!<eos> A-whoa, horsey!<eos> (laughs) (beeps) Neon Joe.<eos> Heard about your little exercise videos.<eos> Interesting choice of charity, victims of police violence.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> Now, why do I got a sneaky feeling that all the proceeds are going to a certain mom of a particular kid that just happened to be killed dead in a hoagie-related whoopsie-doodle?<eos> So what if it does?
But Dan...<eos> He were just a kid, you know?<eos> Mr G's... That's Eddie's brother's club.<eos> So... This Eddie came to Manchester looking for you.<eos> Dan must have thought that Eddie would get to me in prison.<eos> And he worked out a plan to get me out.<eos> But Eddie got to Dan first.<eos> But I spoke to Dan.<eos> Yeah, Dave.<eos> But you did... Not me.
..what's scaring you.<eos> It's not us.<eos> It's just - I just don't feel like I'm in control of anything.<eos> Control.<eos> Can't you just be happy with what you've got?<eos> You know, do you really wanna start again?<eos> A new career at your age.<eos> You love being a copper.<eos> I used to.<eos> No, you do.
She was one of those that could...<eos> oh, wrap me round her little finger.<eos> If she wanted something, she got it.<eos> She had a real edge to her, though.<eos> Look, it's the best I could get.<eos> Painkillers.<eos> Deep Heat.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So how do I find Eddie?<eos> Same way Daniel did.
His brother. Anthony.<eos> And you are?<eos> Lucy's father.<eos> Lucy?<eos> I know Eddie's taken my daughter.<eos> And I know he wants Jules Hope but that's not gonna happen.<eos> You're with Jules Hope?<eos> You better star making sense.<eos> Now, I don't know where Eddie is.<eos> No-one does.
You know, I'd sue just like he was doing.<eos> Suing.<eos> Two weeks before I was released from jail, investigators were gonna bring in pictures to show me of Teresa's body and how it was burnt, and there was still muscle tissues on the bones.<eos> There was a lot of pressure they were putting on me to turn against Steven.<eos> I've been doing this job a long time.<eos> I've met a lot of interesting people, a lot of people that are similar to Steve.<eos> But I've never met somebody as cold-blooded... as him.<eos> To think what he did to that girl. Sit and think about that for a minute.<eos> - Think about her family.<eos> - Oh, I do all the time.
You will not be able to find every bit of it.<eos> [Buting] Let's talk about some specific results we haven't heard.<eos> Gonna put on exhibit 237 right now.<eos> See that crack that sort of runs north-south?<eos> Law enforcement actually took a jack hammer and tore up concrete chunks, right?<eos> That was my understanding.<eos> [Buting] And they did that because they thought, "Well, if the victim had been killed here, perhaps her blood would've soaked into those cracks," right?<eos> I assume so.<eos> Did you find Teresa Halbach's DNA on any of those swabs?<eos> No, I did not.
You tested many knives that were sent to you, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I see at least seven<eos> - just in the May 8th report.<eos> Right?<eos> - Yes. - No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.<eos> - Correct.<eos> By the way... in all of this evidence that you've tested, all of it, did you ever find any DNA of a gentleman named Brendan Dassey anywhere?<eos> - In all of your tests?<eos> - No, I did not.
Right?<eos> - Yes. - No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.<eos> - Correct.<eos> By the way... in all of this evidence that you've tested, all of it, did you ever find any DNA of a gentleman named Brendan Dassey anywhere?<eos> - In all of your tests?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> Not one shred, right?<eos> - No, I did not find his DNA.<eos> - And you had his profile.<eos> Yes, I did.
- And would you agree with me that it would've been very difficult... for Lieutenant Lenk or Sergeant Colborn to have planted a Toyota key in that residence under your watch?<eos> I believe it would've been difficult.<eos> - 'Cause you were watching them.<eos> - To the best of my ability, yes.<eos> You were not with Mr. Lenk and Mr. Colborn when they reentered Steven Avery's residence... on November 8th, were you?<eos> That's correct.<eos> And that is the occasion when a key was found, right?<eos> That is my understanding.<eos> [Kratz] Did you believe that either Lieutenant Lenk or Sergeant Colborn had an opportunity out of your eyesight to plant that key there?<eos> - No, they did not.
- Probably Steven.<eos> - No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.
- No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed, I'm not.<eos> I'm just saying that she could've been a little more patient, little more forgiving.<eos> Would've saved me that parade of drunken assholes.<eos> So, what's the point?<eos> Of what?<eos> I don't know, any of this.<eos> Everything.<eos> Everything? What's the point?<eos> I mean, I sure as shit don't know.<eos> Neither does anybody else, okay?
- Beth's your daughter? - Yes.<eos> - That's Angela?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Nobody gets hurt?<eos> Clean.<eos> Shit.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You know what'll happen if the word gets out that I'm with you again? Right?<eos> You know.<eos> I do, yeah.
- That's Angela?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Nobody gets hurt?<eos> Clean.<eos> Shit.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You know what'll happen if the word gets out that I'm with you again? Right?<eos> You know.<eos> I do, yeah.<eos> I do.
You got my messages?<eos> Nancy and the kids are here. - Yeah?<eos> How are they?<eos> - They're good.<eos> - Why don't you come down and say hi.<eos> - Okay. I will.<eos> Boom, down low.<eos> This hand comes here, this hand catches the ankle. Lay your back into the guy, scoop with this leg, catch both knees, put your arm through. There's your cross ankle, all right?<eos> Nice and tight.<eos> Do it again, all right?
Frank wants to take Jane away.<eos> - He says that I'm an unfit mother...<eos> - You're a perfect mother.<eos> He told the courts that... she lacks a proper home and that it is beyond my capabilities as a single mother...<eos> Marry me.<eos> Walter!<eos> I...<eos> Don't think of a reason to say no, 'cause I've got a million reasons to say yes.<eos> - I know it makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't...
Exactly.<eos> I love it.<eos> - We got in early.<eos> We own three. - Oh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, baby. Killer party.<eos> It's a happening.<eos> So where's your stuff?<eos> We decided that this would just be Walter's show.<eos> Oh, "we" did?
- Is it true?<eos> - Is it true?<eos> - What true?<eos> Everybody's going around saying you told some patient... that he has 90 hours to live.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy.<eos> That's...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - You did!
Hey.<eos> Thought you went home. Hey. Thought you went home.<eos> Thought you went home. I was on my way, but I came back.<eos> I was on my way, but I came back.<eos> Okay. but I came back.<eos> James, you look at me a lot.<eos> I look at all of you.<eos> I look at all of you. You're sitting right in front of me.<eos> You're sitting right in front of me.<eos> Not like that, you don't.
Yeah, I'm still skating. I'm running the skating school over at Spencer's now, which is great.<eos> - It's perfect.<eos> I get to skate every day.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> The owner gives me run of the place, which is awesome in exchange for some small sexual favors.<eos> Nice of him. And you.<eos> Great arrangement.<eos> - You used to laugh at my jokes.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You gotta go.<eos> Penny, this is something I wanted...<eos> No. It's fine.<eos> There's a pregnant woman.<eos> She's bleeding.<eos> You gotta go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'll talk to you tonight.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Did you hear that?<eos> Friends, been a long time coming, this night, and what a thing, having my badass pack here to see it.<eos> #Connor!<eos> And I want to thank Angel here for just making me the happiest wolf in the woods. Oh, shit.<eos> It's like we're mated already.<eos> Well, best get on with it, eh?<eos> Connory Slaughter...<eos> #Alpha dog... leader of the pack, do you take this bitch for... well, tonight, basically?<eos> Angelina Timmins, owner of the only bar in town... do you take...<eos> #Uh, Deke... she does.
Black Hammer would not help you.<eos> Let me show you my world, all right?<eos> The real deal.<eos> Why don't we just go to the department range?<eos> Because that's for cops only.<eos> Which you are not.<eos> Yet.<eos> Which I'm not yet.<eos> - Hey, James.<eos> - Hey, Val, how you doing?
Well, after three years and all that overtime, you finally got your man.<eos> I didn't get my man.<eos> We got our man.<eos> I never liked those two.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm not going to say it.<eos> No.<eos> I'll see you at the office.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Actually, I didn't.
Wait.<eos> He never entered the building of mine.<eos> I saw the whole thing from my surveillance camera.<eos> His own man shot him in the back and left him for death on my doorstep.<eos> A cold blooded setup.<eos> Your full of shit. Now get down on your knees.<eos> - Get down on your knees!<eos> - Damien. - There's a problem. - What?<eos> The number didn't come through?<eos> No, it did.
- Hey, Jer? Give me a break.<eos> - Okay, I'll tone it down a little bit.<eos> You have the greatest hair, Tom.<eos> In the back.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> Shift's over, Jer.<eos> - Jerry.<eos> Fiona.<eos> You said I should come by Accounting sometime.<eos> - I did?
You know what?<eos> The man was a genius.<eos> All right, he was a genius, and I don't... I don't understand it.<eos> I don't understand why you're not backing me up right now.<eos> I think it's appropriate for the environment.<eos> It's the best music to ever grace God's green earth.<eos> Did that hurt? Was that hard?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> She likes him, okay?<eos> - No, no, no, she doesn't.

Was that hard?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> She likes him, okay?<eos> - No, no, no, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, she does.
No, no, I'm not... not really up here for that.<eos> I just really need some peace and quiet.<eos> I have a lot of reading to do to, you know, finish my thesis.<eos> Oh, Claire's old.<eos> What's the connect to that Claire chick?<eos> She's Tracy's old friend. Oh, ho-ho...<eos> it's a possibility.<eos> Yeah, maybe not, no.<eos> So did you hear that Ella is coming up for the weekend, too?<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah, that's a nice-looking dog.<eos> Don't forget to feed it, all right?<eos> Tell me where the hospital is?<eos> Bang a U-ey, go down to the end here.<eos> Take a right. There'll be signs.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I promise, tomorrow I'll take you to the park.<eos> But I'm in a mad rush today.<eos> I will be back very soon.<eos> Hey, man, how you doing?
Are you going to eat something?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Biggest day in the world tomorrow, I can't seem to get you on the phone.<eos> I forgot to tell you, I don't feel good... so I'm not coming in.<eos> Call the BarTemps.<eos> I did already.<eos> Super Bowl. We always use them.<eos> - So what do you need me for?<eos> - I don't.
I can't even think of somebody...<eos> - Thanks, Lloyd.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Are you married? Why?<eos> Are you trying to pick me up?<eos> - Well, marriage is hard goddamn work.<eos> - Yeah, they don't tell you that when you're registering at Crate and Barrel, huh?<eos> No, they do not.
All they need is for the dominant life form to attack and:<eos> There'll be nothing to stop the mimics from conquering the rest of the world.<eos> Unless you change the outcome.<eos> Me?<eos> When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently entered the enemy' nervous system.<eos> Cage, you've seized control of the Omega' ability to reset the day.<eos> - How' that even possible?<eos> Perhaps this organism' only vulnerability, its only vulnerability is humanity.<eos> Regardless of that, you control the power now.<eos> Just as I did in Verdun.
Probably another year... before I even... thought of anyone else.<eos> Same here.<eos> Have you seen you?<eos> I'm not saying I haven't made up for it.<eos> We learn nothing from success.<eos> - To failure.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Is this tour of Dublin over?<eos> - If you want.<eos> And if I don't?
"You're all grown up..."<eos> "and since no chief could ask for a better successor..."<eos> "I've decided..."<eos> To make you chief!<eos> My gods! Hiccup, that's amazing!<eos> You're gonna wear out the spring coil.<eos> The calibration is very sensitive.<eos> Yeah... so this is what I'm dealing with.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> I didn't.
Blind faith.<eos> Profound faith.<eos> Well, how exactly does it work?<eos> It required 12 willing souls to sacrifice themselves to bring back the one.<eos> Now, the operative word is, "willing."<eos> Once the final life was given, the prayer was spoken aloud and witnessed. And then those 12 disciples who sacrificed themselves were granted eternal salvation. And the chosen one was reborn.<eos> I mean, you know, this is early Christian mysticism.<eos> This pre-dates even the Vatican.<eos> And do you really believe this stuff?<eos> I did, yes, once.
- We voted to reject your application for funding.<eos> I'd like to hear your reasons.<eos> The direction of the research you're suggesting is imprecise and unfocused.<eos> Oh, it is, is it?<eos> You don't know what's going on any more than I do.<eos> Could you tell me precisely why you're blocking my efforts?<eos> Dr. Brookner.<eos> There are now other investigators.<eos> This is no longer only your disease, though you seem to think it is.<eos> Oh, I do, do I?
Looks... fresh.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had to.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I hesitated.<eos> - Rose... you're so brave and strong and bold.<eos> Sadly, you'll have many other opportunities to kill Strigoi.<eos> You lied about your feelings for me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
So do you want me to take this right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> That's a left and that's a signpost for Ebony.<eos> But it says it's straight on.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> Do you want me to turn around?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> No, please, don't do that, OK?
I'm not talking about vacations.<eos> Besides, United States, France, anywhere is good enough!<eos> I just want to leave!<eos> Why now, Leo?<eos> It's not a new thing.<eos> I've been thinking about it for a while.<eos> Imagine how cool it'd be to go somewhere where no one knows you, where no one knows who you are.<eos> You could even create a new personality!<eos> - Don't you like your personality?<eos> - Yes, I do!
- Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Penelope, your mother has such great taste.<eos> Oh, let me see that.<eos> Who's this from?<eos> Oh, my God, I wonder what it is.<eos> - It's just a book.<eos> - God, you just told her.<eos> It's okay, we like books.<eos> No, we don't.
You know why we wanted to talk to you today?<eos> Because of my past.<eos> Why don't you tell me where you were yesterday?<eos> Well, I was walking. Mm-hmm.<eos> - I'm trying to lose a little weight.<eos> Walking where? For how long?<eos> I started out on Main Street, and I put in an application at Arby's.<eos> I don't want to work there, but my mom said that I can't afford to be picky.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> I did it myself.
Do you ever wonder what would have happened if maybe you had found the baby sooner?<eos> Maybe you could have saved her.<eos> Maybe if you had walked just a little bit faster, she would still be alive.<eos> Did you ever think about that?<eos> I want to be alone.<eos> Am I under arrest or anything?<eos> Do you remember the honeysuckle?<eos> Remember that time I tried to make honeysuckle soda and sell it from a stand like lemonade? Mm-hmm.<eos> I do.<eos> I sure do.
She said we were important.<eos> What are we supposed to do now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> No.<eos> - Gally?<eos> - Don't.<eos> He's been stung.<eos> We can't leave.<eos> We did.
It's Mickey Wolfmann.<eos> Who's always in the paper?<eos> The real-estate big shot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can't tell anyone about this, Doc.<eos> Oh.<eos> Huh.<eos> Deaf and dumb, part of my job.<eos> How do I reach you?<eos> You don't.
Glen was a shit. Bound to have his series canceled sometime.<eos> That don't keep me from wanting to know who his killer is.<eos> Goodness.<eos> Did you talk to the police?<eos> They talked to me.<eos> Some smart-ass named Bigfoot.<eos> He seemed less concerned with Glen's murder than Mickey Wolfmann's disappearance.<eos> But he's a fan of yours all right.<eos> Said you might be able to help.<eos> Did he now?
To judge a book by its cover. Exactly.<eos> Oh, we weren't supposed to do that.<eos> You weren't supposed to do that. See?<eos> I was encouraged.<eos> Another example of just plain awful parenting.<eos> But, like, the job that you have right now, like, is it something that you actually want to be doing?<eos> You know what?<eos> It can be fun.<eos> But do I love it?<eos> - You don't. - No.
I want you to know something.<eos> I want you to know that there's a gentle Savior who is smiling down upon you.<eos> And His hand will always be there to guide you with loving benevolence.<eos> Dad was always trying to get clean, and he would now and then.<eos> But his time passed and he died just shy of his 64th birthday.<eos> I wondered how it felt to float like him.<eos> And for many nights to come, I would float above the darkness of my life.<eos> Did being the most luminous object in the galaxy justify sacrificing all earthly cares?<eos> I decided... fuck it.<eos> It didn't.
Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.<eos> My dad, my mom.<eos> Everything I thought about them?<eos> Lies.<eos> Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing makes any sense anymore.<eos> I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do with Harry.<eos> Of course I wanna save him. You know?<eos> I wanna save him because he's my best pal.<eos> And what if my blood works?<eos> But what if it doesn't?
What line were we in when they were distributing testicles?<eos> You know I have to go, right?<eos> You're here to listen, not talk, okay?<eos> You know, the great thing about authentic mercury glass is the double-wall.<eos> See that in there?<eos> And right on the bottom:<eos> "New England Glass company." What a great find.<eos> Guys, you wanna head upstairs to my office?<eos> Judge Warren caught it. You know him, sir?<eos> Yes, I do.
Objection.<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Correct.<eos> So on one of the worst days of your life... you enter the mini-mart... you see a man you hate...<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> You see a man that you hate, and minutes later... you've altered your route... and both you and that man are on the same road at the same time... only you're in your car with his blood on it... and he's in a ravine with his kidneys ruptured and his back broken... and you don't remember hitting him?<eos> I do not.
What is?<eos> Being born like that.<eos> Is it?<eos> Can you imagine...<eos> Looking in the mirror and seeing that staring back at you?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Where do you think she comes from?<eos> You think she has a family?<eos> Yes.<eos> She does.
This is not how you waterboard.<eos> Yes it is!<eos> Have you seen Zero Dark Thirty?<eos> No, but I know how to waterboard, though.<eos> Stop drinking it!<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> It's sad what you're trying to do. It's embarrassing.<eos> All right.<eos> I hate Mossi.<eos> Everybody does.
That's what I'm saying.<eos> I don't know what to preach.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> Just speak from the heart, Todd, like you always do.<eos> What about fear do we struggle with?<eos> Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
I loved my grandfather very much.<eos> He was there with me when my father couldn't be.<eos> He taught me to weld.<eos> He gave me that slingshot.<eos> I know.<eos> We play with it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
- That is illegal in this state.<eos> - Fuck you. Just...<eos> - Hey, dude, stop!<eos> Relax. - You gotta get used to some sodomy...<eos> Prepare for some sodomy because I'm about to fuck you up!<eos> Hey, dude, you don't want...<eos> You do not want to get him pissed off.<eos> I wanna get him pissed off,<eos> - you pissed off, and fuck her.<eos> - No, you don't.
- They're right.<eos> Sooner or later, I'm gonna have to pay for what happened today and I can't have you standing next to me when I do, OK?<eos> - I can't have you getting hurt.<eos> - I'm not gonna get hurt.<eos> You hang around with me long enough and you will.<eos> I don't care!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I mean, Dawson, do you want this?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> I do.

Yes, I do.<eos> And I am done pretending.<eos> Good.<eos> - What are you doing'?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.<eos> I was hoping maybe we could talk.<eos> A lot of things have changed since I last saw you.<eos> And well, I just... I want to say I love you.<eos> I do, Dawson.
Come on.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> Holy cow.<eos> - Is that them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You can actually see them.<eos> - I told you this would work.<eos> He did it.
What's this?<eos> This much money, what's a car?<eos> What do you want to be able to say to me?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You have my money?<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> I want you to stake me.<eos> Stake me, and I'll get your money.<eos> Why did you see Frank?<eos> I didn't.
- Wh.. You talked her out of the gold plan.<eos> I sold Ms. Palmer a policy that was appropriate to her age and income.<eos> I didn't feel like I should take advantage.. of her.<eos> That's what we do here?<eos> - We take advantage of people?<eos> - No. No, not at all.<eos> - That's not what I meant.<eos> - I got it. - Sir..<eos> - No, I got it.<eos> I do, really.
Give it some more gas!<eos> I don't like it one bit.<eos> You're scared shitless of Rachid.<eos> You bet I am.<eos> 20 kilos, now and again, is not like doing a big load.<eos> You pay people to load it, you pay off the cops.<eos> That's a lot of people.<eos> That's why you're here. You know everyone here, don't you?<eos> Someone has to stay there in Morocco until we return with the money.<eos> What if they don't?
was a disappointment.<eos> So I never thought that living with Rainier would be any easier. Well, of course it isn't any easier.<eos> - But he does love you. - Oh...<eos> He loves an image of me.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> What happens if I get a divorce?<eos> I think we both know that you'd never be able to come back here and... Your children would suffer the most. They are heirs to a European throne, Grace.<eos> And add to that the fact that you would have been a failure as a Princess.<eos> I don't want to say no to the movie. I don't.<eos> Well, don't.
Yeah, easy for you to say.<eos> How's your money dinner?<eos> You know, stuffed shirts anonymous,<eos> I just have to worry about not falling asleep.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, you're gonna be great.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
What's going on?<eos> Has Derek called you? No.<eos> Why, what's wrong?<eos> My husband is missing.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> And she call hospital for your husband, okay?<eos> Quit moving.<eos> You think you need my help, Ava?<eos> Do you need anybody's help?<eos> You don't.
He tried to set his bone... and he punctured his femoral artery.<eos> He tried to save him.<eos> Look, he asked me... he begged me to cover it up.<eos> Otherwise, the American would make sure his clinic was finished.<eos> He wanted to make it seem like he never made it to the clinic at all.<eos> You've been lying to me this whole time.<eos> You knew my husband was dead?<eos> And you tried to have me killed?<eos> You need to go.<eos> Please don't do this.
You've done it.<eos> In aerospace, the military...<eos> We will own the entire robotics industry.<eos> AII exploration.<eos> The oceans. Space.<eos> Everything.<eos> WembIey. What is this?<eos> The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, Iike women. I never said that.<eos> -Yes, you did. -No, I didn't.
We need a wild man.<eos> It'd be like old times.<eos> Except now you're a silver fox.<eos> - Can you believe Bareman's jogging?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You've got the numbers all colored in your head.<eos> You can't resist because my love's got a half a life.<eos> One by one is seven, seven times.<eos> And the dealer whispers into your ear, you better bet it all. Ooh.<eos> You do the long division in your head.
What's happening?<eos> What's happening?<eos> The worst pornographic cliché, Vana this childhood rape fantasy.<eos> Or, maybe you should get a death.<eos> Isn't it pathetic enough that you want to play me?<eos> You hate me.<eos> But yet you're desperate to be me?<eos> You want that role but you're not gonna get it.<eos> You don't even have the chops!<eos> I did...
You could've had a judge standing by in the delivery room.<eos> Maybe you tried that.<eos> We tried a lot of things, Benjie.<eos> Mostly we tried our best.<eos> That's in your book.<eos> That's a big thing in your book.<eos> Trying your best.<eos> It's supposed to give people major points.<eos> I don't know that girl anymore, son...<eos> Not that I ever did.
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - I can't just...<eos> Into the woods, to Grandmother's house<eos> Are you certain of your way?<eos> The way is clear The light is good<eos> I have no fear Nor no one should<eos> The woods are just trees The trees are just wood<eos> I sort of hate to ask it But do you have a basket?<eos> Yes, we do.
No, you go straight to Holt.<eos> That'll do me just fine.<eos> But, the thing is, I get bored, just the TV for company, so...<eos> I thought to myself...<eos> "I'll, what the hell, I'll take that drive down to Cleaves Mills and I'll just ask a few of my little questions."<eos> Here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> - Oh, I see you do know my name.<eos> - Indeed I do.
There's really not.<eos> Which is okay by me.<eos> But I dragged my pretty wife to this town because this city deserves a championship and I'm the guy that can deliver it.<eos> Well, then we're on the same page, Vince. Oh, yeah?<eos> Then keep me in the loop.<eos> There is no loop. All right?<eos> There's me doing my job, you doing yours.<eos> Your job is to coach the team I give you.<eos> They do it different in Dallas?<eos> Yeah, they do.
-Food, sir.<eos> Tomorrow morning early you bring here, that file and dem wittles.<eos> Fail to do so, and ignoring my words in particular no matter how small it is.<eos> Your heart shall be torn out and roasted and ate!<eos> I'll get them for ya, sir.<eos> Let God strike ya dead if ya don't!<eos> Lord strike me dead if I don't!<eos> Let's give it up for the cast of Great Expectations!<eos> Did you see her Grab my hand at the end there?<eos> Yeah... I did.
The LSD... it was like a... fairytale.<eos> You said all that at the trial, Freddy.<eos> It's getting kind of tiresome now.<eos> She was a lovely... She was a lovely girl.<eos> You know she told me that she'd been abused before?<eos> So I says: once more won't make any difference, then.<eos> You see the light go out in their eyes...<eos> - And you become God!<eos> - No you don't!<eos> No you don't.
What I say?<eos> Oh, my father.<eos> It's so wonderful to see you again, Joaquin.<eos> Look at that mustache.<eos> And all those medals.<eos> - What's this one for?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't...
A little less wooden.<eos> I didn't kill my Wife.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Every time you look smug... or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.<eos> - That's supposed to make me less tense?<eos> - Let's try it again.<eos> Mr. Dunne, from what I understand, you and your wife had some bumps.<eos> Yeah, we had some tough years.<eos> I lost my job.<eos> You both did.
Got to go!<eos> He's really taking it out on the omelette bar.<eos> Shit was nasty!<eos> He's under a lot of pressure at work.<eos> What's up, playa?<eos> Want to go to the movies?<eos> I'll break your motherfucking legs!<eos> Break your legs!<eos> What?<eos> How you doing, Mr Nice Plant?
Would you like me to bring along any special messages - from the group?<eos> - Uh, no, no. Because the group does not have a sick, crack-minded attachment to him. Just you do.<eos> Well, you don't get over an experience like that.<eos> - Sure. - Mm.<eos> - Juliet...<eos> - Mm? You should be proud of your work - in the autopsy room.<eos> - Mm. I will never again be able to look at a boggy prostate - without thinking of you.<eos> - You're sweet, Woody.<eos> Do you think maybe you should tell your real daughter about what happened?<eos> Already did.
Is that statue breathing?<eos> That thing's breathing on me.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let me just go look for... Something.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> I found absolutely nothing over here.<eos> After you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't do first anymore.
You got a mission...<eos> I can help.<eos> My name is Galgo.<eos> Let me fill you in.<eos> I am good, very good.<eos> At warfare. You know good memory, afraid of nothing.<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I don't need a friend.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Everybody does.
Aviation fuel.<eos> It's good.<eos> The best team member ever, his name was Torres.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You wouldn't believe what this guy was capable to do.<eos> Un...bel...ievable.<eos> I'm telling you, man.<eos> - Galgo? - Yes, sir.<eos> I think I know why your team let you go.<eos> You do?
- But I didn't need it upholstered.<eos> Nor do I need silk lining in my jacket, or pistachio cream for my dessert or oysters!<eos> Not everybody can be rich, dear.<eos> September 2nd, 200 francs.<eos> October 5th, three-seventy-five francs.<eos> November 20th, 450 francs.<eos> There's no end to this.<eos> You owe me ten thousand francs, and you must begin to pay.<eos> - But I have nothing to pay you with!<eos> - Oh, but you do.
I ain't saying fucking shit!<eos> Then your name's on a dozen other jobs just like it.<eos> - That's bullshit!<eos> - No.<eos> No, that's a promise.<eos> There's been a series of burglaries in the area all over the last six months.<eos> All still open.<eos> Now you don't talk to me, it's all on you, boy.<eos> Well, you know, I ain't got nothing to do with that.<eos> - Well, any idea who does?
All right, stand down, Carter!<eos> I talk to Nukes daily, so I'm running point here.<eos> - Jesse wears a wire.<eos> - God damn it, Fitch.<eos> You blow this deal and we blow everything afterwards.<eos> Take some initiative and get these assholes in line.<eos> All right.<eos> Count seems to be good.<eos> Hey, Catfish, you could do me some help up here right now.<eos> How we doing up there?
Can I ask you something?<eos> Did you kill your mother?<eos> Yes.<eos> Were there voices?<eos> Did voices tell you to do it?<eos> No.<eos> No, the voices... they didn't tell me things.<eos> They told my mother things.<eos> So, you don't hear voices.<eos> Your mother did?
Daisy, that is not you killing your mother. That is her dying. You need to stop saying you killed your mother because you didn't.<eos> You didn't kill her.<eos> You didn't kill her.<eos> Why do I have to go back to the hospital then?<eos> I never wanted to take you back.<eos> That's not real though, is it?<eos> That's just pretend.<eos> It is.<eos> I did want to take you back.<eos> I did.
You didn't kill her.<eos> Why do I have to go back to the hospital then?<eos> I never wanted to take you back.<eos> That's not real though, is it?<eos> That's just pretend.<eos> It is.<eos> I did want to take you back.<eos> I did.<eos> But now I don't.<eos> I really don't.
No firing guns on the property, you asshole!<eos> - Wow.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> That was a shot.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> ! - What?<eos> - You shot Stephen! - Well, no.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> - You fucking shot my husband!<eos> - No, I didn't.
But not much maybe.<eos> God, what a mess we've made of our lives.<eos> It's not all that bad, is it?<eos> Well, there's Phoebe.<eos> Why haven't you told her, Quirke?<eos> You promised you would.<eos> I started but it's not so easy.<eos> She seems so much happier here.<eos> -Does she really have to know?<eos> -Yes, she does.
Why haven't you told her, Quirke?<eos> You promised you would.<eos> I started but it's not so easy.<eos> She seems so much happier here.<eos> -Does she really have to know?<eos> -Yes, she does.<eos> You have to tell her she's your child, Quirke.<eos> You owe it to her.<eos> All right.<eos> -I'll do it now.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> I know.<eos> More time at home.<eos> I understand the hours you got to work, But even when you're here, you're not here.<eos> I get it.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Girls, run now!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Are you going to shoot me now?<eos> After all these years we've spent together.<eos> And now you have a guilty conscience.<eos> I trusted you!<eos> You are like a brother to me.<eos> And now, you wanna shoot me?<eos> Things change.<eos> But people like you never do.
Why not?<eos> Adam, do you think that anyone would have thought twice about the way they treated him if they never had to think that it might have been one of us who killed him?<eos> They did kill him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now do you understand...<eos> I was only trying to help? Who says I need fixing?<eos> Jamie, what is this?<eos> That's mine.<eos> I didn't mean to take it.<eos> - I didn't...
You know, not...<eos> Not since the funeral, no.<eos> I want to take Mom's ashes.<eos> I want to take her to the lake.<eos> She would have wanted it that way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think... yeah.<eos> - I think she'd...<eos> - She wanted that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Wondered if you were still teaching.<eos> Oh, right, OK, just 'cause I'm looking for a lesson.<eos> - Are you taking the piss?<eos> - No. No, I'm not.<eos> I just want a lesson, blow away the cobwebs.<eos> - What do you reckon?<eos> - I reckon salsa's for pussies.<eos> - Isn't that what you said?<eos> - Did I?<eos> Oh, yeah, you did.
- You don't know.<eos> Well, in that case, why don't you piss off back to the bar, grab yourself a pint of bitter and watch like all the fucking losers?<eos> Don't.<eos> Scrub it off of me.<eos> This filthy tan.<eos> - Big news, ball bag.<eos> - What?<eos> When you were at home last night making love to your hand, guess who went disco dancing with the sexually-frustrated lady boss.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Me. I did.
We'll dub it in post.<eos> [Knock on door] Okay.<eos> Yes?<eos> You asked for me, sir?<eos> For the rug?<eos> It's too late, buddy. I've already cleaned it myself.<eos> Please, shut the door, I have an appointment.<eos> I love it.<eos> No kidding?<eos> I really do.
The order finally came through today.<eos> I guess it was inevitable.<eos> By the time you listen to this seven years will have passed.<eos> Our first mission is just as important as our last.<eos> Each one getting us closer to our final destination.<eos> Sir, please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations - set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you accept that any diversion from your mission parameters will result in immediate court martial? And if convicted death by lethal injection.<eos> I do.
Why would I want to imagine such a thing?<eos> See how powerful we could be together?<eos> Hello?<eos> "You aren't wearing a dress, are you?"<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> "I'm getting calls about a transvestite wreaking havoc in the streets."<eos> Yeah, I got it under control.<eos> I just arrested him.<eos> -"You did?"
Hello.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Trust me?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Say it.<eos> I do.
Mark...<eos> Hello? Please, are you there?<eos> I don't want you to leave me again.<eos> He just went away for a second.<eos> I think he's going to come back.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Mike?<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> How'd you get in?<eos> I didn't.
We are Crescent Bay's Welcoming Party, and, well, we just couldn't wait to introduce ourselves to you!<eos> - I'm Emma.<eos> - And I'm Gloria!<eos> - I'm Clarissa.<eos> - Ambrose McKinley.<eos> Mr. McKinley, is there anything we can do to help?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - Did you bring cake?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes we did!
- My grand daughter.<eos> - How do they know how to do this?<eos> - It's nature.<eos> It's how baby turtles know how to run into the ocean after they've been born. And I guess it's how bees know how to make a hive.<eos> - Nature's amazing.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - We should film it.<eos> - Too bad we don't have a camera though.<eos> - What?<eos> - You do.
Wig maker.<eos> He was a master of the razor and the brush.<eos> You're the master of the brush now, Mr Turner.<eos> Well... My little lad could draw afore he could read and write.<eos> Sat in the corner of the shop, scratching away with the chalk and charcoal.<eos> I'd stick his pictures in the window.<eos> And sell 'em, all of 'em.<eos> For two or three shillings apiece on occasion.<eos> Do you have children yourself, Mr Turner?<eos> I do not, Mrs Somerville.
he's just like a genius.<eos> So this was his idea then?<eos> All this stuff?<eos> - One day, I come home from work, - Right.<eos> And Tommy was thinking these guys are assholes.<eos> No one is getting hurt, so is it really a crime?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I guess that's something to think about. What do you think?<eos> You think it's a crime?<eos> No, I don't.
No points, no plugs.<eos> John, it's got no fucking engine.<eos> - So, how has it got so far up the track?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Maybe it spread its wings and flew.<eos> Gets worse.<eos> We found a bag.<eos> It belongs to Greg Forsythe.<eos> - Didn't he go to school with Heather?<eos> - Yeah, John, he did.
And did you know about this invitation?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not surprised though.<eos> Valery does lovely things like this.<eos> How is this a lovely thing?<eos> To me, this is a wildly, wildly awkward thing.<eos> I don't know what he has in mind.<eos> You must understand, this is between you and him.<eos> You have your own relationship now.<eos> We do?
What?<eos> Do you not want me here?<eos> You're not here.<eos> We have to say your name five times before you even answer.<eos> - Something is wrong.<eos> - I'm just tired.<eos> Why aren't you singing my song?<eos> Do you...?<eos> - Do you not love me anymore?<eos> - Rose, of course I do.
You used to think you mattered so much you could treat me however you wanted.<eos> How dare I ask to be treated like an actual human being before I give it up?<eos> How cruel, right?<eos> You'd tell me over and over you didn't want me.<eos> - I never said that.<eos> I never...<eos> And now that somebody actually wants me, now you wanna act like a wife.<eos> - It's a little late.<eos> - You didn't want a wife.<eos> - I did! - You didn't.
Well, that's what I said.<eos> I'll tell you what he needs.<eos> A decent period of mourning, a year or two, then get married again.<eos> Who would marry him, Rose?<eos> -You'd be surprised, Quirke.<eos> -I would be surprised.<eos> -So what about you?<eos> -What about me?<eos> Don't you ever get lonely?<eos> Who doesn't, Rose?
Come on.<eos> If we hurry, we can catch the last sitting at Fratellis.<eos> -Glass of wine, sir? -No, thank you.<eos> God, Mal.<eos> You didn't tell me the Judge was here.<eos> -I,assumed you knew.<eos> -Mal.<eos> You came!<eos> Just seeing if the old tuxedo still fits after all these years.<eos> Well, it does.
All men are heroes to their sons.<eos> But few are heroes to entire nations.<eos> That was my father's privilege.<eos> If my father... ..if... ..my father was here tonight, he would be so proud.<eos> And it is therefore with some pride that I stand here before you to accept this great honour in memory of my father, Connor Latimer, a patriarch, and a patriot. Thank you.<eos> For God's sake! What is it now, Quirke?<eos> People are starting to worry about you, you know that?<eos> I spoke to Patrick Ojukwu this evening. -He confessed to performing an abortion on your sister, April, in her flat.<eos> I thought you should know that.<eos> -But then you already do, don't you?
My residents don't improvise.<eos> Got it.<eos> What are we looking at?<eos> Fetal measurements of the biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length are all consistent with 20-weeks gestation.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's go tell dad.<eos> We'll send mom for a formal anatomy scan when she's more stable.<eos> What if she doesn't recover?<eos> We work for and pray that she does.<eos> But if she doesn't?
"faithful servant and friend of Jesus."<eos> My mom ran the sunday school.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> Tried so hard to get me to believe in something.<eos> Something wrong with your arm?<eos> Well, it-it hurts under the pit a bit.<eos> Let me take a look at it.<eos> Hey, speaking of saints, you know a... a doc named Selena?<eos> Works out of a drop-in on Gerrard?<eos> No. No, I don't.
I changed my mind.<eos> Maggie: David?<eos> It's what she would have wanted.<eos> It's what I want.<eos> I want him.<eos> I want our boy.<eos> ♪ but that's just my see-through heart ♪<eos> They're giving me the physostigmine?<eos> Yep, and they're just gonna keep giving it to you until something happens.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Sorry.<eos> It's nothing, just a bit of carpal tunnel.<eos> I've seen my share of hand cramping. That looks more like focal dystonia.<eos> - Are you a doctor?<eos> - A violinist.<eos> Musicians get it a lot.<eos> A buddy of mine had to quit the London Symphony because his hand just stopped working.<eos> Well, I don't have focal dystonia.<eos> Good.<eos> - Because if you did...
Slow your breathing.<eos> You're gonna be okay. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I-I can't tell you how sick I feel about this.<eos> Um... so, listen, your blood work is in the system... under the name John Smith.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I know you'll take precautions.<eos> Of course, but... you're saying my insurance company won't find out I have hep "C"?<eos> You don't.<eos> John Smith does.
She always brings that up.<eos> Every year, we'd have an easter-egg hunt, and we'd never find any eggs.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because he never hid any.<eos> But we had fun.<eos> Um, guys, this is kind of like a deathbed confession.<eos> I can't see your father lying about this.<eos> It's never lying to him.<eos> He thinks if you dream hard enough, dreams come true.<eos> They did that one time.
MM-HMM. GOOD.<eos> SOMETIMES THEY...<eos> THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU THAT OPTION, AND I'M GLAD THEY DID.<eos> PHYSICALLY, HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?<eos> FINE.<eos> HOW ARE YOU HANDLING ALL THIS?<eos> TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN THE RUNAROUND.<eos> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS TO DO WITH LIABILITY<eos> OR MALPRACTICE, BUT THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T JUST HAPPEN.<eos> UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES THEY DO.
I don't know shit about football.<eos> Eventually, I started missing some bets.<eos> Actually, the third week, I fucking missed everything.<eos> I mean, I got fucking buried.<eos> I was losing everything I put in.<eos> Went down 25,000.<eos> So I tried to be scarce.<eos> Fall off the radar a minute.<eos> I tried to avoid these pricks.<eos> Honest to God, I did. I did.
Goodbye?<eos> Wait. Louise.<eos> Louise!<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Oh, come on, come on!<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah!<eos> You like me fucking you, don't you?<eos> I do.
And then I'd lift it up and I'd be like, "Oh, shit, it's a big joke."<eos> I know, exactly, because when you lift it up there's nothing but a metal cage under there.<eos> Wow!<eos> You are ready to relieve the stress of the day.<eos> Completely.<eos> Well, at the very least, this will be a good way to spend my last night alive, right?<eos> Albert.<eos> What?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I was drowning.<eos> I'm just not capable of...<eos> You deserve to be loved, Eddie.<eos> You do.<eos> I just wanted to be what you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be somebody else. Somebody I'm not!<eos> Anybody-<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?
I was drowning.<eos> I'm just not capable of...<eos> You deserve to be loved, Eddie.<eos> You do.<eos> I just wanted to be what you wanted.<eos> What you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute trying to be something else, something I'm not.<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?
"Oh, hey, he must be the one with the gray hangy ghost scrotum."<eos> Look, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, but the song wasn't about you.<eos> We've been on two dates. I've never even seen your balls.<eos> And now you never will.<eos> I feel like you're supposed to leave after you say that.<eos> God.<eos> That sounded bad.<eos> I just don't get why everyone takes everything so personally.<eos> I know. It's like that time that guy I dated thought we wrote a song about how he sounded like a bike pump in bed.<eos> We did.
But I think mine's coming really soon, though.<eos> Oh, my God. I have mine right now. And I'm just like, "don't they make bigger tampons than this?"<eos> One time I was at this water park, and there was this little trail of blood<eos> - Oh, I hate that.<eos> I also hate it when it's, like, chunky, and you're like, "um, did I just miscarry?"<eos> I don't know why guys are grossed out by it, though.<eos> - It's just blood.<eos> - I don't know. My boobs feel so huge, though.<eos> Do they look bigger to you?<eos> Yeah, they do.
No.<eos> No, just... Just forget about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm sorry about all that Beth stuff.<eos> It's just things were really complicated.<eos> - No.<eos> - We had troubles.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> No, I do. I do.
Flamenco dance.<eos> But we got to do a lot of things.<eos> And I never got to say goodbye to you, but at least I get to now.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't do this.<eos> This fucking sucks.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you liked it.<eos> No, I do.
Augustus Waters was a cocky son of a bitch.<eos> But we forgave him.<eos> Not because of his superhuman good looks... or because he only got 19 years when he should've gotten way more.<eos> 18 years, buddy.<eos> Dude, come on.<eos> Really? I'm assuming you have a little more time, you interrupting bastard.<eos> Interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy. You're supposed to be dead.<eos> But when the scientists from the future... come to my house with robot eyes... and they tell me to try them on...<eos> I'm gonna tell those scientists to piss off, because... because Gus, I don't even want to see a world without you.<eos> I don't.
Your boy Waters and I corresponded quite a bit in his last days. Oh.<eos> So, you read your fan mail now?<eos> I wouldn't exactly call him a fan.<eos> He detested me.<eos> But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral... and tell you what became of Anna and her mother... so here I am.<eos> And that's your answer, "Omnis cellula e cellula."<eos> "Life comes from life."<eos> I'm really not in the mood.<eos> You don't want an explanation?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off.<eos> Right.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Okay.<eos> Better, right?<eos> You know it's better.<eos> Fuck ratings.<eos> I don't care about ratings.<eos> Well, that's easy to say...<eos> I don't.
Look, I get it. It's hard.<eos> You...<eos> You can tell?<eos> Of course I can tell.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> You think...<eos> Everyone can tell? No!<eos> No, you're doing great.<eos> But I totally get what you're going through.<eos> You do?
Now, listen, you know I hate doing this, princess, but you chose this line of work.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time...<eos> Where's my fucking money?<eos> I don't have any... oh!<eos> Did you just fucking lie to me?<eos> Is that what just happened? - Mm-mm.<eos> - Then where's my fucking money?<eos> I just seen you with that faggot.<eos> So I know you got some. No, I don't.<eos> I don't.
Sometimes I can't believe we're actually related.<eos> Oh, I give up.<eos> I do hope you're not in too much pain.<eos> I'm sure I'll survive.<eos> Perhaps you can help me take my mind off things.<eos> Perhaps I can.<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Nonsense, of course he does.
The wrecks at sundown.<eos> Once he sees the pouch with the seal unbroken, he will hand over the page.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> It's unclear which is more appealing, your beauty or your intelligence.<eos> You are very kind, monsieur.<eos> Well, let's not get carried away.<eos> You.<eos> Is there a problem, Captain?<eos> She doesn't have your page.<eos> Flint does.
Think I'm lying?<eos> You got a specific location for this place or are we just gonna wander around till we find it?<eos> We got some names.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask for directions.<eos> Maybe you could just follow your nose.<eos> Wherever he picked them up,<eos> I mean, I won't lie. However we left it, he had some moves.<eos> He knew a few Cis from his narco days.<eos> They knew these parts, put us in touch with some names, people to talk to.<eos> How we doing, boys? Hey.
Let's cut to the point.<eos> As the crow flies, y'all are wanting to ask about that big throwdown in the woods, yeah?<eos> Eventually, sure.<eos> Right now, we're just trying to track the case.<eos> How Cohle worked it, especially.<eos> Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.
Bluetooth.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Looks like our raccoons are back.<eos> All right, I think I'll keep you inside.<eos> There's your Chinese.<eos> Translation?<eos> "Bring the box."<eos> "Bring the box"?<eos> Where did you learn mandarin?<eos> I didn't.
Look out for jellyfish.<eos> - Is this official?<eos> - Is what official?<eos> What it says on this rock.<eos> "Keep off.<eos> F and G's beach."<eos> Oh, God. I carved that.<eos> Well, I helped.<eos> Actually I didn't do all that much, I was only small.<eos> - Frazer did most of it.
I'm sorry, do you expect the court to believe that sort of gibberish? No.<eos> Teenagers don't use the word 'parents', well, not to each other, anyway. I know.<eos> I have a 15-year-old, and I've watched her.<eos> If Sophie was 13 and she was real, she would have typed 'parentals' or 'rentals' or 'rents'.<eos> So I looked at all that and I thought, 'You're not 13'.<eos> Yet, I mean, you and Sophie stayed in contact for months, and never questioned her age.<eos> You kept on asking about young models for an exhibition you were doing on the loss of innocence.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, I put it to you that you're lying to us, and that you DID believe that she was 13.<eos> No, I didn't.
That is, of course, assuming Erin's right to testify.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So it's up to me, then?<eos> Only if you want to.<eos> Look, you know all the things we say when we want to make sure we get a witness in the box, but you also know we don't blame them for backing out.<eos> Especially when it's genuinely dangerous.<eos> Just for God's sake, don't do it for me, or for Tony or anyone here.<eos> We understand. We know what happened and frankly, we're pretty amazed you're even here.<eos> So if you want to do it for you then do it.<eos> If you don't, don't.
We think he's got some other information, about me and the car bomb.<eos> That explains a bit. You spoke to Maya.<eos> Do you think she's going to change her mind?<eos> No, but Nelson's been committed for trial.<eos> We can buy some time, police can put pressure on him.<eos> Maybe he'll give something up.<eos> How are we going to buy some time?<eos> The case against him has fallen down.<eos> The minute Nelson finds out...<eos> What if he doesn't?
Good evening.<eos> You asked for a meal?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'II put it here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're hungry?<eos> Yes, I'd like the soup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want to call the kids but there's no signal.<eos> I already did.
Jesus Christ! Maverick, stop.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Come on, come on, get off.<eos> You scared the shit out of me. Go away.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Get out, get out.<eos> You're not supposed to see me tonight.<eos> Come on, I mean, that is a dumb tradition. You don't believe it.<eos> No, no, I don't believe it.<eos> Oh, shit, you do.
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Come on, come on, get off.<eos> You scared the shit out of me. Go away.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Get out, get out.<eos> You're not supposed to see me tonight.<eos> Come on, I mean, that is a dumb tradition. You don't believe it.<eos> No, no, I don't believe it.<eos> Oh, shit, you do.<eos> Okay, I kind of do.
Hey.<eos> Hey there.<eos> Hey, you know, you were right.<eos> - Really? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Do tell.<eos> We need to try more new things, like weekends away in places like this.<eos> - You think so? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It makes me excited about us again.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> - I do.
We didn't say anything for months.<eos> You'll start blaming us at this rate.<eos> OK, Hidayet, come on.<eos> But sending a debt collector so suddenly, is that right?<eos> You could have talked to us first.<eos> Talking exists, doesn't it?<eos> Come on, Hidayet.<eos> How many times did we talk?<eos> How many times did I tell you?<eos> I did, didn't I?
What would it be like? Thieves, murderers, psychos would prosper.<eos> Chaos would reign everywhere.<eos> - What would be left, then?<eos> - Left? Cripples and madhouses. How should I know?<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> But I couldn't take the easy way out like you.<eos> What easy way out?<eos> Maybe you should think about it.<eos> You went a bit too fast.<eos> I didn't.
Who was supposed to save people under the rubble?<eos> - I didn't deny that...<eos> - Nobody thinks about that.<eos> It was just an example.<eos> Come on, these judgments you make don't suit you, Mr Bülent.<eos> - Who's judging? I was saying... - That's no good.<eos> I maybe didn't express myself right.<eos> I meant something else.<eos> - Levent, you said it wrong.<eos> - I didn't.
You know?<eos> And instead I had to get up at 7 in the morning. To talk to a man... A stupid sophist<eos> Another pedophile sophist, With confused ideas that do not come to anything, Whose sole objective is...<eos> I will not accept it!<eos> It bothers me not to be able to say no to you again.<eos> You know what you've done...<eos> Over the years, little by little and by parts?<eos> You managed to make me hate myself today.<eos> You see that?<eos> You did.
Frank's recruiting kinda young, ain't he?<eos> Look, do you want it or not?<eos> You're a pistol.<eos> You got a problem?<eos> No, Miss.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, just give me my money so I can get out of here.<eos> Hey.<eos> What you say your name was?<eos> I didn't.
See?<eos> Everybody feels better when they've had a makeover.<eos> Which reminds me, I have a project to attend to.<eos> ♪ So here we go ♪ and we're gonna take it slow ♪<eos> ♪ we're ready now to touch the sky ♪<eos> ♪ this must be how it feels to fly ♪<eos> ♪ I'm on Cloud 9 ♪ I'm on Cloud 9<eos> ♪ this must be how it feels to fly ♪<eos> ♪ I'm on Cloud 9 tell me this gets easier.<eos> It does.
When he finds out what you've done, no one... not I nor your father... will able to protect you from the consequences.<eos> If Bryson balks, we must let him go.<eos> And the guns Flint needs?<eos> What about them?<eos> We'll find them some other way.<eos> I never ask anything of you.<eos> This I must insist on.<eos> Tell me you understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> - How we doing?
Afferent neurons in the peripheral nervous system.<eos> Bum-itch.<eos> Oh.<eos> So why don't you see him any more?<eos> Who?<eos> Your previous commander, Sholto.<eos> Previous commander?<eos> I meant ex.<eos> "Previous" suggests that I currently have a commander.<eos> Which you don't.
Exactly.<eos> When he showed us the letters.<eos> OK.<eos> So, he's brought the letters to London, so no matter what he says, he's ready to make a deal.<eos> Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he's established a person's weaknesses, the pressure point, he calls it.<eos> So, clearly he believes<eos> I'm a Dr.ug addict and no serious threat.<eos> And of course, because he's in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of GB from seven till ten.<eos> How do you know his schedule?<eos> Because I do.
You're a very stupid little boy.<eos> Mummy and Daddy are very cross because it doesn't matter about the gun.<eos> Why not?<eos> You saw the whole room when you entered it.<eos> What was directly behind you when you were murdered?<eos> I've not been murdered YET.<eos> Balance of probability, little brother.<eos> If the bullet had passed through you, what would you have heard?<eos> The mirror shattering.<eos> You didn't. Therefore...?
He's not breathing!<eos> Mr...<eos> Here.<eos> Do you take sugar, Sally? No.<eos> Yes, actually.<eos> Do you have sweeteners?<eos> In the drawer.<eos> Which?<eos> The one with the hoover bags.<eos> Sorry, I still don't...
Yeah, we know that's asking you to give up a lot.<eos> Nah, only about six inches.<eos> That is so gross.<eos> Yeah. Next subject, please.<eos> Mary, does your cousin's shack have electricity?<eos> Do you need a place to plug in your vibrator?<eos> How dare you?<eos> Turn that music off, Mary.<eos> You seriously like this?<eos> You seriously don't?
Right.<eos> Yeah, I don't know how to take that, babe.<eos> Honey, it's a really common fantasy.<eos> Yeah, I'm not 100% sure it is, hon.<eos> It is actually and you said you wouldn't judge me.<eos> No, I didn't. I absolutely did not.<eos> How did you expect I'd react, Maeve?<eos> You just told me you had a fantasy that doesn't involve me!<eos> No, what?<eos> Yes, it does!
How did you expect I'd react, Maeve?<eos> You just told me you had a fantasy that doesn't involve me!<eos> No, what?<eos> Yes, it does!<eos> You said you want to be raped but not by me.<eos> No!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, darling, that's not what I meant.<eos> Oh, my God, you are so fucking beautiful.<eos> No, I want to be raped by you.<eos> No, you don't.
- And you don't have cancer.<eos> - I don't have cancer.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Well, I just came from the doctor and the results came back and they are negative.<eos> I don't have cancer.<eos> We beat it.<eos> No, it's bullshit.<eos> Dr Barnes said she hasn't seen you in weeks.<eos> I never said I went to Dr Barnes.<eos> Yes, you did.
I got to go to the mortuary tomorrow morning and pick out a casket and all that stuff.<eos> Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.<eos> So, good night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, have a good night.<eos> Hey, Debs.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you just said you're pregnant.<eos> I did.
We're all military here.<eos> We'll be neighbors.<eos> No matter how I figure it, there's no way he could afford a villa.<eos> It's a row house. He sold his flat.<eos> He brought money from Vietnam.<eos> Sure, he even declared it.<eos> But he bought an Opel Rekord.<eos> They paid well in Vietnam, I bet he didn't declare all of it.<eos> It doesn't prove anything.<eos> Sure they did, but not that well.
Yes, that's me.<eos> Already?<eos> We're just starting to have fun.<eos> Friend, excuse me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm a Polish army officer.<eos> MPs should be with you, and the patrol commander should be the rank of major or higher.<eos> Do you have your ID?<eos> Yes, I do...
That's a fine young one for you.<eos> When the Civil War broke out, Ellison supported the Confederacy, investing in Confederate bonds and supplying food and provisions for the Confederate army.<eos> Ellison's story is told by the African American scholar Henry Louis Gates.<eos> Gates and other scholars estimate that in the period before the Civil War, there were approximately 3,500 free blacks who owned more than 10,000 black slaves.<eos> In South Carolina and Louisiana, Gates points out, the percentage of free blacks who owned slaves was approximately the same as the percentage of whites who owned slaves.<eos> These episodes illustrate the universality of the conquest ethic and the uniqueness of the American response to it.<eos> Slavery existed all over the world.<eos> The Egyptians had slaves.<eos> The Chinese had slaves.<eos> The Africans did.
I'm not from Paris.<eos> I'm from the Val d'Oise. Where's that, then?<eos> You go to Cergy-le-Haut on the A line, then you...<eos> Forget it.<eos> - Is there a way out?<eos> - Of course.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a cassette.<eos> - They don't exist anymore.<eos> - Yes, they do here.
KIM:<eos> You're my brother.<eos> Let's get this out of the way, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - (chuckling):<eos> Okay.<eos> DAVE:<eos> And what are we gonna name you, huh?<eos> You need a name?<eos> Yes, you do.
Sarah, did you... Did you actually suck some old producer's cock for a role in a movie called The Silver Scream?<eos> That's sad.<eos> It's a gateway part.<eos> From here it sounds a lot like prostitution.<eos> Don't!<eos> - Sarah, what happened to you?<eos> - Don't, don't touch me. - Sarah...<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - Don't.
- Not many.<eos> Most have their own bunkers.<eos> I figure we're just getting the really nervous ones.<eos> Welcome, Prime Minister.<eos> It seems the implant can emit some kind of counter signal... to ensure the wearer remains unaffected by the waves from the SIM cards.<eos> The waves that turn everyone into a psycho killer.<eos> But what he probably didn't tell anyone... is it can also super heat their soft tissue at his command.<eos> Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning... but he had to be sure they didn't blab to the wrong people beforehand.<eos> How does this help us right now?<eos> It doesn't.
Archer is not your average dealer.<eos> And what about the pseudoephedrine?<eos> Hey.<eos> We'll worry about that tomorrow.<eos> Tonight we celebrate.<eos> Right but the pseudo, I mean, you do have it...<eos> Oh, I've got it, partner... but here's the thing... if I tell you where it is now what's to stop you... just putting a bullet in me?<eos> Well, I can think of a long list of things, Russell... but number one would have to be the fact that... I don't even have a fucking gun.<eos> He doesn't have a gun.<eos> Well, you do now.

Skyler, look I just...<eos> Breakfast time, boys and girls...<eos> And you know what I feel like for breakfast on this beautiful morning?<eos> What's the matter, partner?<eos> The fuck is the matter with everybody?<eos> Skyler... uh...<eos> I think I've been hallucinating.<eos> Or maybe I am now.<eos> But just tell me what you remember...<eos> The same thing you do.
I do, yeah.<eos> Sometimes. Yeah?<eos> How come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just feel so terrible about her death.<eos> - It seems so unfair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You ever go to her house?<eos> Me?<eos> I did, yeah.
(GROWLING)<eos> Where's Doug?<eos> I can't find his black ass in this dark!<eos> MIGUEL: Where the hell is he?<eos> Look for eyes!<eos> Like a forest creature in a cartoon.<eos> Father Doug! He's over here!<eos> He's over here! (WHIMPERING)<eos> Doug!<eos> Nigga, please, don't. MEGAN:
He did it!<eos> - He killed Herzog.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Herzog is dead.<eos> He is dead. Yes!<eos> Holy cow, that was close.<eos> You did it!<eos> You killed Herzog?<eos> I can't believe that that actually worked,<eos> Of course it did.
- I had a vision.<eos> My wolf.<eos> He's still with me.<eos> Josh?<eos> You don't belong in this plane.<eos> - I'm not going back to limbo.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> You said we're linked, I'll take you with me, I'll leave you there.<eos> - You don't know what I can do.<eos> - Oh no, I do.
What, you can't wait two hours to die?<eos> I'm fucking serious!<eos> Give me a fucking hand!<eos> I will not give you a hand 'cause he is not going anywhere!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm bleeding to death, you fucking idiot.<eos> Shut the fuck up, Liam!<eos> You might as well kill me right now 'cause I'm not giving you any of my fucking money.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> You do.
I found the Rose Key, George.<eos> You did? Mmm-hmm.<eos> It was in Iran, wasn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew it.<eos> And I need your help translating the Aramaic.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Did you go to Iran?<eos> It doesn't matter who went there, George.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Those aren't jellyfish, buddy.<eos> Believe it or not, those are contact lenses.<eos> Your grandpa saved all the contact lenses he ever wore.<eos> Why?<eos> He said he just couldn't bear to throw them out 'cause it's everything he ever saw.<eos> It's weird, right?<eos> I know, but it's kinda good-weird.<eos> I like it.<eos> Well, he must have seen a lot of stuff.<eos> He did.
Can you start tonight?<eos> Doing what?<eos> I run a successful TV news business.<eos> We film breaking stories.<eos> Maybe you saw my item this morning of a fatal carjacking.<eos> No. I don't have a TV, but that sounds cool.<eos> Do you have a cellphone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does it have GPS?<eos> Yes, it does.
What happened to you last night?<eos> - Man, I wanted to come.<eos> I just couldn't... - You know what?<eos> Actually, I don't give a shit. Just get your ass in the house, Reggie.<eos> Go on, Reggie.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of me.<eos> I wouldn't dream of embarrassing you to make you look bad in front of your daughter.<eos> Listen, Elliott.<eos> I wanted to be here last night.<eos> I did.
And if I don't believe you, the judge sure as hell won't believe you.<eos> Jeremiah, you need to listen to me.<eos> This isn't about him doing drugs.<eos> He'll admit that he did 'em.<eos> Hell, he'll take a damn drug test. He's already said that.<eos> He's changed.<eos> And he just wants to be with his baby.<eos> He doesn't want to be with his daughter, Rowena.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You do, he doesn't.
Ah, sorry. Sorry, Maya.<eos> Ah, could we just...?<eos> Just a second.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you think you're doing? Me?<eos> You can't just ask me out for a private chat.<eos> What do you think that's telling her?<eos> You don't want me there?<eos> She doesn't want you in there.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
I know David. Well, you can't talk to him.<eos> We can agree on that at least.<eos> Maybe. But on the other hand, he's still a friend.<eos> He's a silk and you're a witness for the prosecution.<eos> If you tell him about how you got together with Maya and why Nelson better take a deal or else, he'll get the whole thing called off before lunchtime.<eos> Just don't leave it to the last second.<eos> David responds to negotiating time.<eos> Who wants a negotiation?<eos> He will.<eos> I don't.
Go, take care of them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And when you come home, I want to hear about the rest of them.<eos> Done.<eos> - Taxi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ___<eos> Here is fine.<eos> - You live up there?<eos> - I did.
-Dido, you're full of shit.<eos> -I am not full of shit, I am telling you...<eos> -I don't think we've met.<eos> -No, you're right.<eos> Hello.<eos> -Welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How do you know Curtis?<eos> -Um...<eos> I don't.
I need you to find Margot.<eos> I want everything she can tell us about Stirling Rogers.<eos> The next station is London Bridge.<eos> Change for the Northern Line and international rail services.<eos> Well, I thought it was you.<eos> I was worried you might remember me.<eos> Of course I remember you.<eos> And I spotted you way back.<eos> I spotted you at Aldgate East.<eos> -You did not.
She's 90.<eos> - Not so bad. - Yeah.<eos> This French guy, whose name I can't pronounce, he's called me a couple of times. We Skyped while I was still in New York, and he's really hot to buy it.<eos> Of course I didn't tell him about the old lady.<eos> I didn't know about her.<eos> If you see him, tell him she's 90 right away.<eos> Good point.<eos> Do you have a... a card?<eos> Oh, yes, yes. Of course.<eos> Of course, I do.
My father took every ounce of love he had and dumped it in Paris.<eos> People like us think we've been cursed by God, but, in fact, we've been cursed by our parents.<eos> You look in the mirror, and you see an adult.<eos> But you have to look more carefully.<eos> There's a big piece of you that never grew up. It may have grown tall, but not up.<eos> You spend your life waiting for your parents to come back and make it all right. But they don't come back.<eos> It's not all right.<eos> You have to somehow move past them.<eos> You have to somehow convince yourself that you don't need those people.<eos> Because you don't.
They're people.<eos> There's respect in what I do.<eos> You are very interesting to me.<eos> Your artwork is interesting, too.<eos> Do I scare you?<eos> Are you gonna arrest me or what?<eos> No, I'm not gonna arrest you.<eos> Then stop following me.<eos> Why did you say that you didn't recognize Ellie Ford?<eos> - Because I didn't.
It's beautiful.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> This way, we can do his work... together.<eos> I almost shouted for joy when you brought Annie home.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, after tonight, I was gonna take you to go find her... but you did the hard part for me.<eos> Oh, you should've seen her face...<eos> - ...right when she died. - Oh, my God!<eos> Daniel, I didn't bring her to you!<eos> Yes, you did.
I'd offer to buy you a new purse, but, sadly, I just lost all my money.<eos> Yeah, my start-up just died.<eos> So since breakfast, I have lost $17.3 million.<eos> That sounds really bad.<eos> Okay, well, it was nice meeting you, Ron.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Um, I think this went quite well.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> You don't happen to have a mint, do you?<eos> I did...
I guess we're lucky the bald guy and the dyke caught us first.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Hey, I liked the dyke.<eos> Do you know what I love about this country?<eos> The same laws that protect people from me, protect me from you.<eos> You sound like my father.<eos> I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.
What did Dad say?<eos> Oh, your father.<eos> He's unsettled.<eos> He's unsettled?<eos> Honey, he thinks you're too young.<eos> I'm older than you were when you got married.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What do you think about me marrying Alex?<eos> I don't have an opinion.<eos> Of course you do.
I can see it in your face.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> You have classrooms full of children, those are your kids.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Then me.<eos> I'm your kid.<eos> You're always telling me what a big baby I am.<eos> Well, you are.<eos> You really like it, don't you?<eos> I do.
What has he done?<eos> Why?<eos> We'll take care of him for you.<eos> He didn't slaughter your cattle.<eos> He killed his cousin.<eos> He's the only prisoner.<eos> Leave him to us.<eos> I'm sorry for you, René But it wasn't him.<eos> - You don't care!<eos> - I do.
The prosecution could argue that John Joseph O'Shea was a getaway driver.<eos> And a getaway driver does not participate in the crime, he sits in the car with the engine running.<eos> On balance I think it right for the jury to consider that possibility.<eos> I'm confident that the case against all four defendants should proceed.<eos> You're going to have to plead guilty, Kieran. That's the least you can do.<eos> No way.<eos> Take the blame.<eos> You're the one who dropped us in this shit.<eos> No way! What, you think you can get away with it?<eos> Yeah, I do. Yeah.
- Just let me think.<eos> Just let me think.<eos> Let me think.<eos> Let me think.<eos> Fuck!<eos> God damn it!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Please tell me you have a map in your bag.<eos> - I never needed a map.<eos> - Oh, we do now.
Oh, oh no.<eos> We all talk about you.<eos> "Where's Emma's mom?<eos> I wonder where she lives."<eos> Okay, look, lady. I know I've made some mistakes.<eos> (Laughing) Okay, yeah.<eos> But you have to understand.<eos> I didn't have all the love and support that Ben has.<eos> I didn't have an incredible, selfless mother who would do anything for me.<eos> Well, who does really?
- Just, like, upstairs?<eos> - Yeah, ok, sure.<eos> Actually, could you close the door? - Are you ok?<eos> You're acting really weird.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> Um, so I uh...<eos> I don't know how to say this, really. Um...<eos> Say what?<eos> You know that I care about you a lot, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Mmm, this is good.<eos> Spencer got them to blink.<eos> But if she were a real lawyer, she would've explained the sort of opportunity you have there.<eos> You'd do a lot of damage with that.<eos> Could shut the whole place down.<eos> Close Radley?<eos> Once and for all.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
Swagerty won't let me keep you.<eos> I see.<eos> Self-righteous son of a bitch is flanking me with all his own people.<eos> Says it's for my own good, that I lack experience in an executive capacity.<eos> He told me to take it or leave it.<eos> You're gonna be transferred. There's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You're still the chief of police.<eos> You've never left me out there, not for one day.<eos> You know you have to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
There were some issues when she was last on the floor, but know this.<eos> Not all of them were her fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Part of the problem was that we didn't have enough oversight.<eos> Well, I was doing my best- Which is why I'm assigning Jackie to Dr. Roman.<eos> Wherever she goes, shadow her.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know I shouldn't, but I feel kind of bad for Dr. Roman.<eos> Don't feel bad for her.<eos> But I do.
Can I plug this in your ear?<eos> Why don't you try that girl I saw you with earlier?<eos> She seems to have a fair amount of extra energy.<eos> - Heather.<eos> - Oh, Heather's, what, like, 19?<eos> She's completely age-appropriate.<eos> Why' you jealous?<eos> Fuckin' -A, I'm jealous.<eos> You see that body?<eos> No, of course you did.
Memorize this: 12 TPU...<eos> So I want you to flee as soon as you can.<eos> - How?<eos> - My little warrior...<eos> Enough.<eos> You have something to say to him, right?<eos> This is very important...<eos> Jonas wants to get the code.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - He does not.
You learned to fight like a good little boy.<eos> I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.<eos> You want to fight pretty or you want to win?<eos> You talk to my brother this way?<eos> All the time.<eos> He got used to it.<eos> Do you think he did it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.<eos> But who didn't?
Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.<eos> I've got something else for you.<eos> I hope I got your measurements right.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> For Lady Catelyn.<eos> And for you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> I have one more gift.<eos> I don't need a squire.<eos> Of course you do.
- Castle Black could be next.<eos> - I should go back for Gilly.<eos> We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.<eos> I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.<eos> And I remember who came after me and brought me home.<eos> I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.<eos> When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.<eos> I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.<eos> I tried.<eos> Really, I did.
Never letting go Gotta learn to grow<eos> Watch me as I touch the sky<eos> Still I fly<eos> Still I fly<eos> Stick shift!<eos> - Ripping!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drip, what the heck is the matter with you?<eos> You nearly took off the guy's canopy!<eos> But Blackout said it was okay to go, dude.<eos> - I did?

That bitch is an emotional terrorist.<eos> She better not be going to this thing tonight, I can't stand her.<eos> How's that $30 spray tan working out for you?<eos> I don't know, you tell me!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> If I had tits like that, it would not have taken me till I was 18 to get some dick.<eos> Shelby, did you bring my black shoes?<eos> I don't have them.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
Believe me when I say they'll pass the Senate version.<eos> I'll talk to the President.<eos> Just make sure this is airtight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Lucas Goodwin.<eos> From the Herald.<eos> He must have been working with Zoe.<eos> How much does he know?<eos> No more than she did.
He's the first real connection we have to Mina.<eos> It is an invaluable opportunity we cannot afford to waste.<eos> Even if it means beating him to death?<eos> Suddenly sentimental about bloodletting, Mr. Chandler?<eos> Maybe I don't take to torturing children.<eos> Killing redskins more your line?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> Whole Indian nations pacified into nonexistence, what don't I know?<eos> How do you know I was in the Indian wars?<eos> I didn't.
You don't have a sweetie, do you?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> I've a bit of peppermint in my dresser, but it's very old and I daren't.<eos> Very sensible.<eos> We put Mother under the ground.<eos> But I don't think she'll stay there.<eos> They never stay, do they?<eos> Where do they go?<eos> You know.<eos> Do I?

Perhaps I was just cherishing the secrecy of it as a hidden sin.<eos> But in me, there was a change.<eos> I marked it from that night in the hedge maze.<eos> Perhaps it was always there.<eos> Little acts of wickedness.<eos> Harmless, of course.<eos> Something any girl would do.<eos> I told myself it was no more than mischief.<eos> But I knew it was more.<eos> Of course I did.
Stop an elephant.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Sir Malcolm.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Wait a minute, Kali, is it not?<eos> From the seance?<eos> It's actually Evelyn Paul, from Brighton.<eos> - Preferable.<eos> - Yes. But the clients do so enjoy the legerdemain.<eos> Who doesn't?
Did I?<eos> How arresting.<eos> It was unnatural.<eos> Do you not remember?<eos> You've been asleep since.<eos> Who dressed me?<eos> Sembene and myself.<eos> Did you make the tea then?<eos> What?<eos> No. Sembene did.
That mysterious past of yours.<eos> How far can you run?<eos> You know what, I have a father!<eos> I don't need another one!<eos> And you had a son and you killed him.<eos> Am I missing anything?<eos> Lord, are we ever getting out of this house?<eos> Do you know why I must go to Africa?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Only he reckoned without their connections to the police.<eos> And, unfortunately for him, he chooses the same Saturday that Aldridge decides to go on the run from Farnleigh.<eos> When Landesman and Wintergreen find out that Aldridge has gone AWOL, they assume that he escaped in order to spill his guts to Patterson about Blenheim Vale.<eos> They were afraid that all of the terrible things that they'd done and had, no doubt, continued to do were finally to be dragged into the light.<eos> So they took steps.<eos> Drink it all up.<eos> That's a good boy.<eos> Bad apples, Morse.<eos> Every barrel's got 'em.<eos> The same 'bad apples' that did for George Aldridge.
Yes.<eos> That's a really serious allegation, Joe.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> He was at the research centre that night.<eos> Cos the dance was for Angus's 18th birthday party and most of the island was there.<eos> You know your mum wasn't attacked until everyone had gone home.<eos> So...why Donnie?<eos> I mean, why would he do a thing like that?<eos> They didn't want me there.<eos> Who didn't?
Where would I go?<eos> It's not my day for Lerwick.<eos> He knew her.<eos> She visited him yesterday.<eos> And he saw the body this morning.<eos> He said that?<eos> He wasn't trying to hide it.<eos> He said he saw her at 5am.<eos> He doesn't sleep so well this time of year.<eos> Who does?
Shall I tell you... a secret?<eos> You're getting ahead of the script.<eos> Secrets come last.<eos> Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.<eos> You're one of the girls that I like.<eos> You wouldn't be too bad if you made a bit of an effort, but...<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Quite the little lady.<eos> If you did something thing with your hair.
Is Sally home?<eos> -Sally's at school.<eos> -No. No. School just said she phoned in sick today.<eos> Sally?<eos> Sally?<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Sally didn't turn up at school.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she did.
In fact, it's so far from cool, it's almost creepy.<eos> No, it's creepy.<eos> Yep, we're in creepy town right now... population you.<eos> "A," I have an appointment, and "B," it's too soon.<eos> What kind of appointment?<eos> - It's an acting appointment. - Mm.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
- Well, n... n... now, hold on. I thought ranching meant something to you and that father of yours.<eos> - I never thought I'd see the day. I... You done?<eos> For now.<eos> Look, it's my cousin John Ross who's behind all this, all right?<eos> My father and I are trying to do everything in our power to stop it.<eos> Why didn't you say something sooner?<eos> 'Cause you're pretty cute when you're angry.<eos> All right. Okay, then.<eos> Hey, you like barbecue?<eos> Who doesn't?
Oh, hey Tracy.<eos> What happened to your agent?<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, I saw that you're not with Teller Davis On the sign-in sheet.<eos> Oh yeah, I've been thinking about moving on For a while now.<eos> Really, hmm.<eos> Olivia Thompson said they let you go.<eos> No, I moved on.<eos> Did you ever get a call back for that Budweiser commercial?<eos> Sure didn't.
What do you know about women?<eos> - She looked at me.<eos> - It's a whore.<eos> Did she look at you?<eos> No.<eos> Well then. That's fine.<eos> She's a whore.<eos> - She would want me.<eos> - For 50 Euro.<eos> She does it for 25 euros.
I suppose.<eos> The docks and harbour visit was her only invitation.<eos> I find that hard to credit.<eos> When's she coming?<eos> Week on Tuesday.<eos> Oh, do you know? That's really quite fortuitous.<eos> It's been a week since Ian started penicillin.<eos> But his phlegm's so thick he can't seem to cough it up.<eos> He needs to be in hospital.<eos> They both do.
I don't know... Lobster in Nantua sauce. is that good?<eos> OK for the appetizers and the lobster.<eos> I hate it when she does that.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Means she's going to win.<eos> 035...<eos> Put a three.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> It'll cost a fortune!<eos> - lt does work.
Huh?<eos> Huh, you care now?<eos> Stop.<eos> Do you care now?<eos> -Look at us.<eos> We're a mess.<eos> I tried to scratch your eyes out.<eos> -She send you?<eos> -No.<eos> Nobody did.
Speak your face...<eos> -Stop!<eos> I hate you!<eos> I wish I was dead!<eos> I wish we were all just dead!<eos> -Well... that's the most sensible thing she's ever said.<eos> Go on, eat your food, mother.<eos> Yes?<eos> -Did my... mother send a letter today?<eos> -Why yes, yes she did.
They're in Saigon.<eos> You gotta go back.<eos> How can I help them?<eos> He's your little boy.<eos> What about all the shit you gave me about getting up the duff and who was the dad and how important that is?<eos> - He's with his mother, OK?<eos> - You're responsible for that boy.<eos> You don't understand, Viv.<eos> That place changes you, OK?<eos> It does.
Well, beauty alone is not enough if the person has no substance.<eos> I agree with you.<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> So what if she is trilingual and has an Actors Studio degree?<eos> Okay, she's got an Emmy for Best Newcomer Actress.<eos> -lt doesn't qualify anybody. -No.<eos> So what if she has a foundation or something like that and fights forthe preservation of the Amazon Forest?<eos> Men don't like perfect women like that.<eos> -l agree.<eos> -They really don't .
That's why I'm always playing and dancing. I celebrate every minute, because that's what they used to do.<eos> Not me. I was always complaining about life.<eos> Suddenly, life gave me a punch in the face.<eos> Enough with this sadness! Enough!<eos> It's in the past.<eos> -Let's change the subject. -Right.<eos> But that taught me a lesson:<eos> life is the greatest miracle! Whatever way it presents itself.<eos> You know, Dona Sonia, I like that.<eos> -You do?
both personal and corporate...<eos> So, I think that makes me a UK citizen, don't you?<eos> Well, you do hold an Israeli passport.<eos> Anyone with direct Jewish ancestry holds that right.<eos> Well, you certainly have the ancestry.<eos> Eli Stein, The Sword Of Israel, your father.<eos> That's quite an inheritance.<eos> Well, I hope you'll recognise that it's precisely because of what we've chosen to do with it that I'm here today.<eos> Do you have close protection, Lady Stein?<eos> Yes, I do.
No.<eos> You know everything about me.<eos> - I couldn't tell you.<eos> - Yes, you could. It wasn't mine to say.<eos> Was it Ephra and his fucking secrets?<eos> He's so full of shit.<eos> I didn't think you'd ever have to know.<eos> Well, just don't say you didn't have a choice.<eos> I didn't, Nessa.<eos> You did.
You've earned it. - Thank you.<eos> - Drive carefully.<eos> I will! I will!<eos> Say bye-bye. Bye!<eos> Bye, Whiskers.<eos> - Bye-bye!<eos> - Bye, Denise.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did young miss pass her driving test?<eos> Yes, she did.
Nothing. I... I just hope you're wrong.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> You... You can still use it for your campaign, right?<eos> Mm. That's the thing.<eos> If we use this and we find out later that he was shooting people having sex, that is what's gonna be splashed all over the Internet.<eos> It'll be a PR disaster.<eos> Peeping Tom Vodka.<eos> I am gonna have to go and talk to Nate and see if he has any additional footage that he hasn't shown us.<eos> I told you we make a great team.<eos> We did.
- Keep your head down.<eos> Be quiet. - We're all gonna die.<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God.<eos> Oh, please, God, please.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't touch me.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please don't.
Oh, please, God, please.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't touch me.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please, please don't kill me.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Please, please don't.
Oh, God.<eos> Please don't touch me.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please, please don't kill me.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Please, please don't.<eos> Please don't.
Now, i could have used this against you, judith, But i think i would much rather have you as an ally instead -- Not just with emma.<eos> Oh. You scratch my back and i scratch yours?<eos> I'm familiar.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You're gonna love this.<eos> Whoa,whoa,whoa. We'vealready gota dealin place.<eos> Judith: Well, that was with my son.<eos> Every day your cocaine pipeline isshutdown, It costs you millions.<eos> Let'snotquibble overcrumbs.<eos> How you doing?
Now, I could have used this against you, Judith, but I think I would much rather have you as an ally instead... not just with Emma.<eos> You scratch my back and I scratch yours?<eos> I'm familiar.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You're gonna love this.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. We've already got a deal in place.<eos> Judith: Well, that was with my son.<eos> Every day your cocaine pipeline is shut down, it costs you millions.<eos> Let's not quibble over crumbs.<eos> How you doing?
You forgot to tell her you love her.<eos> That's why it doesn't work.<eos> Why you keep rewriting it.<eos> That's the word that's missing.<eos> We're gonna need you to come with us, sir.<eos> You wanna explain this to us before we call the police?<eos> - I'd love to hear this one.<eos> - I don't remember this at all.<eos> You don't remember this happening a few hours ago?<eos> No, I do not.
I heard they was all traitors.<eos> Don't need no traitors in here.<eos> I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.<eos> I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.<eos> Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?<eos> What?<eos> It's nothing, my lady.<eos> You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.<eos> Don't want to offend, my lady.<eos> Truly, I don't.
Listen.<eos> Why didn't they take it out?<eos> It would have involved another surgery.<eos> Your parents... they're not back yet.<eos> Someone had to make the call.<eos> And that's what you decided...<eos> to leave it in there inside of me like s-some sort of...<eos> ticking time bomb, Frank?<eos> I didn't decide.<eos> Your husband did.
What kind of service?<eos> Anything you command, if only you'd free my hands.<eos> But it's vital that any servant of mine conduct himself properly.<eos> I hope you're not prone to unseemly conduct, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Well, I believe there's nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.<eos> Then you've washed up on the right island.<eos> Oy!<eos> I've never heard such talk, not from a lady.<eos> You disapprove?<eos> I most heartily do not.
You've got a loyal fellow there, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Treat him well.<eos> I must express my gratitude for your intervention.<eos> They do say the true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good.<eos> They do.<eos> However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
You're right to have that reaction, Marge.<eos> Why, I just figured, at home I sit with the family, so I assumed that...<eos> Have you ever drunk out of a toilet?<eos> I-I don't see what that has to do with the discussion.<eos> Dogs eat in the kitchen.<eos> Yeah, dogs eat in the kitchen.<eos> Y-You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right?<eos> You cool with that?<eos> Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.
Are there pages I could look at?<eos> - Sure, I suppose.<eos> - Cool, let's go.<eos> What, now?<eos> I'm bleeding working.<eos> There's no time like the present, Krull.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Really needed a "me" day.<eos> - You did, did you?
- Well, he was, actually, Marcy.<eos> Charlie, I need to speak with you for a moment.<eos> Won't you please excuse us?<eos> Be right back, Krull. Just a second.<eos> - We're having a business meeting there.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Wasn't a social hour.<eos> - Listen, listen.<eos> What if I told you I know how we can get out from under our current financial crisis?<eos> I do too.
You think "A" orchestrated that all just to scare us?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I can barely hear you.<eos> The church.<eos> My mom wanted me to drop off a pie for the bake sale.<eos> Hanna: Just call me later, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad.<eos> How did you know I'd be here?<eos> I didn't.
Milady de Winter?<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I drove him into her arms.<eos> Constance.<eos> Why don't you go home?<eos> She's upset.<eos> She loves him.<eos> Well, she said she didn't.<eos> And you believe that?<eos> He did.
The sound is making people sick.<eos> We need to stop it.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I think the dome's trying to tell us something.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> We should go there.<eos> It could have answers for what's happening.<eos> The dome doesn't have answers.<eos> Yes, it does, Dad.
No.<eos> Okay. We can't wait for Ezra to tell us who "A" is.<eos> We have to get you to the airport.<eos> You can still use that passport and that ticket that Noel gave you, right?<eos> I don't have it anymore.<eos> What?<eos> I gave away my get out of town free card to someone who needed it more than I did.<eos> Ali, who needs more help than you do right now?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to us.
You mentioned her in an interview.<eos> It's because it's gauche to grope and kiss in public.<eos> You really don't remember meeting me, do you?<eos> I had a photo shoot in that same place when my first book came out.<eos> I gave you a copy of it.<eos> You acted like you were better than some first-time author nobody had ever heard of, even though you were probably still in college.<eos> I wrote my number in it, twice.<eos> I really honestly don't remember meeting you.<eos> Sorry, but I remember you now.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
- Nobody at the school likes me. - Nobody here likes you.<eos> I think I might resign and come home.<eos> You don't live here.<eos> You live upstate.<eos> No, I don't want that to be my home.<eos> It's lonely and sad and the faculty have turned on me.<eos> The last few weeks have been so hard for you. Whose cat is this?<eos> It's my cat.<eos> - We don't have a cat.<eos> - Apparently I do.
I told this to our boy here.<eos> You know, you have to be very careful. Don't believe too strongly the structures they put in front of you.<eos> This is good advice. For you more so than him, though.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You seem ill-equipped to deal with someone like that.<eos> We began by hating one another. I think we're coming back down the other side now.<eos> That's a very potent image. You should write it down and use it.<eos> I came up with it on the silent, excruciating drive over here.<eos> - I'm glad you approve.<eos> - Oh, I do, indeed.
But you can't hide forever.<eos> I'm not hiding.<eos> Matthew.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> And I'm counting on you staying right here.<eos> You?<eos> Keep it down, Garza.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you?<eos> Do you?
- You first mentioned it yesterday.<eos> - Don't kill my dreams, Will. - Oh!<eos> Hello, nutter.<eos> You made it.<eos> So, er, what are you up to tomorrow?<eos> Any plans? We thought we might travel somewhere ethical, an Aboriginal... cave.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> I'm going to Splash Planet.<eos> It looks brilliant.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
How is she?<eos> She's tired.<eos> She had a big day.<eos> She was never in danger.<eos> I don't believe she would have been found in a laundry if that were true.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Just some answers.<eos> Why did it take you so long to change your mind about wanting her?<eos> I didn't.
Is this gonna work?<eos> It should.<eos> Drink up, mami.<eos> What are you giving her over there?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's to help her poop.<eos> She's backed up.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - You don't wanna hear about my bathroom.<eos> - Of course I do.
There is nothing wrong with being romantic.<eos> I wanted to tell you when I knew for certain.<eos> I wanted to see your face when I told you the news!<eos> But you were foiled by bureaucracy?<eos> We shall pretend that this never happened.<eos> And when you do tell me, you just watch my face.<eos> Patrick... ..I'm not sure I'll be telling you anything.<eos> Nothing feels as it should.<eos> My cycle - or the lack of it - suggests I might be expecting.<eos> But nothing else does.
What is this?<eos> - Blueprints.<eos> - I know it's a blueprint!<eos> What... is it a blueprint of?<eos> A machine built by... a primitive civilization that shouldn't have even had the knowledge to make it.<eos> You built a 10,000-year-old weapon powered by that stone, and you just sent Neil out to go turn it on?<eos> No, what you should be asking is how did they access the materials?<eos> How did they even know the power of that stone?<eos> How did they know that it had to be built in a lead deposit?<eos> - How did Th...
What, do you think I owe something to the world?<eos> I owe something to you?<eos> I owe something to Mom?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> You owe it to yourself for always taking the easy way out.<eos> I am taking the easy way out because I chose a career... that you and her just don't approve of?<eos> I like my job!<eos> I do.
Looking so well.<eos> Pearls suits you.<eos> Well, they're new.<eos> But then you always did notice everything.<eos> Where can I find Miss Towler?<eos> Mr Grove?<eos> I presume you know.<eos> Unless I pull myself together I'm out on my ear.<eos> The chief doesn't want that.<eos> None of us do.
Since you and Pa stopped sharing a bedroom neither of you have been happy.<eos> That's not true and I wasn't thinking about your father and myself.<eos> Well, maybe you should.<eos> You're making him miserable.<eos> Over the years he's made me fairly miserable, too.<eos> Why did you come back from America at all?<eos> You should either stay out there or be here and try to make it up with him.<eos> Gordon, it's very complicated.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, Chief?<eos> My wife's charity event today. I have an idea how to round it off.<eos> Indeed?<eos> All I'm saying is that you could have discussed it with me.<eos> Why?<eos> So you could try and change my mind?<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And this is my country!<eos> Everybody has a choice, George.<eos> Yes, they do.
Valerie Maurel.<eos> She left me a year ago.<eos> We had been happy in New York.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> But then she met another man.<eos> They left and went to Berlin.<eos> I followed them.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why couldn't you accept them being together?<eos> I did, finally, but...
Oh, we need... We need to do something.<eos> I'm sure Mr Thackeray's accused him but we need to prove it.<eos> Now, I know Mr Grove is doing his best but...<eos> But there's no reason we can't give him a helping hand.<eos> I used the supplier that Selfridge himself recommended... for military boots.<eos> So there's your story, Mr Edwards.<eos> I thought you might be interested.<eos> Yes, I would be willing to meet you.<eos> Well, why don't you come to the house?<eos> Don't you?
That he cut corners on military supplies?<eos> Seems out of character for Selfridge.<eos> We can't run it till we talk to him and he's not in the country.<eos> I need a scoop, Frank. So do you.<eos> I've got another lead.<eos> Lady Diana Manners.<eos> Tittle tattle.<eos> My readers want real news.<eos> We can't run it till he's had right of reply and I don't know where he is.<eos> I do.
Exactly that.<eos> I'd open up your parcel, Aggie...<eos> Straight into the jars of jam.<eos> You and your sweet tooth, George.<eos> The tasting bit came after.<eos> First I'd... get the jar and put it up to my nose... ..and breathe in.<eos> Do you remember how we used to make jam and chutney with mother? Our life of crime, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Robbing orchards. Ah.<eos> I hope you didn't get caught.<eos> Like I did.
We got our orders.<eos> We feign some business at Nick's club.<eos> He'll cover for us.<eos> We track the area, see what we can find.<eos> You'd go against Jeremy?<eos> Right now, I would.<eos> I haven't seen Braxton since his dog lunged at Elena.<eos> Word is, he was coming up here to have it out with you.<eos> His dog's still missing. His dog never showed up.<eos> Neither did he.
What was the rush?<eos> It was a stupid idea, man.<eos> Who told you to come? Nobody.<eos> I heard a rumour...<eos> I swear to God!<eos> I know somebody put you up to it.<eos> Somebody's paying you.<eos> Nah.<eos> No way.<eos> You do your taxes?
Payback time, Danvers.<eos> You're wasting your time with Elena.<eos> You know you're not allowed to kill her.<eos> You want to kill, we find Jeremy.<eos> Leave the girl alone.<eos> Who says I'm gonna kill her? You do.<eos> Time and time again.<eos> Hm.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do, don't I?
Clark, if you want Claire, I'll give you Claire.<eos> You want rules, I will follow rules.<eos> You want to staple furniture to the ceiling, I will hold the ladder.<eos> If I'm gonna give you everything, you got to not walk out on me.<eos> At the minimum, I got to know we are at least in this thing together... you and me.<eos> Look. The thing is, I'm not a very good teammate, Ross.<eos> I get ahead of myself.<eos> And the more you do to try to help me, the more nervous I get about messing it up. - I don't care.<eos> You can mess up all you want.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
What about the blood we found at their house?<eos> It doesn't look like they have any fresh wounds, but I'll type the kids just in case.<eos> Time of death?<eos> I'd say yesterday morning, 6:00 to 10:00 A.M.<eos> The decomp was...<eos> Just say 6:00 to 10:00 and maybe a prayer that you catch the monster who did this.<eos> Two dead kids stuffed into suitcases.<eos> Sound bad enough to justify some overtime?<eos> And... and how do you intend for us to break this news to the mother?<eos> I don't.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I was going shopping until you called Leo and he raced over here.<eos> You would think the man's a puppy the way he fawns over you.<eos> And why didn't you tell me that you had been demoted to foot patrol...<eos> At coney island, seriously?<eos> Honey, you want me to call the Captain for you?<eos> - I have no problem doing that.<eos> - No!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, how you doing, sweet thing?
Yeah, I get it. I get that, boss.<eos> -Well, you take care now.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> Amos Jenkins just invited me to Bible study at church.<eos> Oh, that's who that is.<eos> Nodevelopments inthecaseofJTDoyle , theStintonteenwho went missingontheafternoon ofAugust27th.<eos> Amonth-longpolicesearch hasfailedto findany trace ofthe15-yearold , andinvestigators arestillnotsaying iftheyhave apersonof interest atthistime.<eos> HisparentsBill andDianaDoylehavemade anemotionalplea tothecommunity.<eos> Ifyouhave anyinformation, pleasecontact CrimeStoppers.<eos> Amos Jenkins, how you doing, pal?
Hawkeye: Well, I say we take the next month off.<eos> I'm gonna need a month just to enjoy this moment!<eos> (camera focuses)<eos> Say "defeat!" (laughs) That's my new profile pic.<eos> (groaning in pain) Wouldn't believe it if I wasn't seeing it with my own eye.<eos> Might want to back up.<eos> I know standard procedure's to confiscate his armor, But skull may have it booby-trapped.<eos> (growls) I'll get it off him.<eos> (growls) Didn't I just say not to do that?<eos> I did, right?
The 1912 renewal is a document I drew up with Monsieur Cambon, which allowed us to divide certain operational responsibilities between the French and Royal Navies.<eos> In this agreement, the French were assigned the Mediterranean, and we agreed to secure the Channel.<eos> The advantage of this agreement is obvious, but the disadvantage, as Monsieur Cambon is now very anxious to point out, is that it leaves the Atlantic and Channel coasts of France completely unprotected by battleships.<eos> Or would do so if we failed to join in a war that Germany was waging on France.<eos> You mean the French are relying on us to protect their ports?<eos> In a sense, yes.<eos> There's no escaping it.<eos> It is an unfortunate situation.<eos> Our agreement with France has all the obligations of a formal alliance.<eos> -No, it doesn't!
You figure it out yet?<eos> I wish you'd stop saying that.<eos> Have you?<eos> 'Cause this car is just about out of gas.<eos> So am I. I'm just so damn tired.<eos> We're all tired, Spencer.<eos> Figure it out, so we can get on with our lives.<eos> No matter who gets hurt.<eos> You're all the time talking about wanting the answer.<eos> Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
- Of course I don't want to buy them.<eos> - You got the house.<eos> I didn't get it to make a lot of money.<eos> - It's their childhood home.<eos> - My secretary attended the funeral.<eos> And she says Frederik was furious about the museum.<eos> - There was a hell of a lot of trouble.<eos> - I was at the funeral too.<eos> You can't get a better family than John and Lise.<eos> They did everything for you.
You're welcome to a beer.<eos> I think there's some food left as well.<eos> Sorry for asking, but has Emil asked to borrow money?<eos> If you lend him 400,000, that's the last you'll see of it.<eos> - He'll sign a loan agreement.<eos> - What if he doesn't have a single krone?<eos> Emil has used other people's money his entire life.<eos> Let him fend for himself.<eos> - He needs the money.<eos> - He always does. Signe!
I just sort of...<eos> I didn't wanna call to the house.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Yeah. Mr McGunn, it's me.<eos> - Ray?<eos> - Long time no see.<eos> I'm not sure it's a good idea, turning up out of the blue like this.<eos> Alice said the door was always open.<eos> - I'm pretty sure she never said that.<eos> - She did.
Listen, my boyfriend... he just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq... and he gets a bit twitchy when people are rude to me.<eos> Why not show him how much you liked his music.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye... and welcome to America!<eos> What just happened?<eos> They just really liked your music and didn't know how to express it.<eos> - You like movies? - I do.<eos> - You do?<eos> - You like... you like Robert DeNiro?<eos> - I do.
No!<eos> I'm happy for what has happened to you.<eos> But when you're done telling me about your fancy new life, you go back to your room.<eos> You don't think to ask how my day was.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Is it?<eos> Alejandro can treat me like the help.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But you... I thought I mattered to you.<eos> Of course you do.
How'd you know?<eos> My mother is a leader of the Trags.<eos> There's not much I don't know.<eos> But why are you helping out now?<eos> It's time I embraced my destiny.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> If it wasn't for your speech, the integration program and your father's work would've gone down the drain.<eos> You wouldn't have given up on integration, though. No.<eos> But I'm only interested in programs that work.<eos> Thanks to you, this one still does.
Why, you little...<eos> Why, you little...<eos> Why, you little... Why, you little...<eos> Dad, it's me.<eos> Prove it.<eos> When's your birthday?<eos> February 23rd.<eos> Ha! February has no 23rd.<eos> You... (grunts) (grunting)<eos> Yes, it does.
So, I read a bit this morning and I get you, Hannah Horvath.<eos> - And I like you. - MO: I knew she would.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're like a Mindy Kaling meets...<eos> - Joan Didion. - No, Mo. (SIGHS)<eos> - I love Mindy Kaling.<eos> She's terrific.<eos> - Right, but she holds back.<eos> She'll go there, but she doesn't go all the way there, you know what I mean?<eos> I definitely do. She just never...
- He fishes.<eos> - You train...<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - He hunts, he sings...<eos> Like, dogs?<eos> He wakes up early to get papers and muffins.<eos> He watches foreign films with me and does all the voices.<eos> He explains the universe so that black holes sound cool, not scary.<eos> - You don't want to see me. - No, she does.<eos> She really, really does.
Wait, what?<eos> You're gonna go stay with Ray for a while?<eos> Just through the rehearsal process so I can just think about the play and not have to deal with all this drama.<eos> What drama?<eos> This is just me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You didn't even care about the play.<eos> Well, but here's the thing.<eos> I did. I always did.

You only get 30 days from the birth of your baby to change your mind.<eos> What?<eos> I need to check something.<eos> The wrist tag from Annie's baby.<eos> I kept it in my locker.<eos> She has 30 days to change her mind, right?<eos> She still has two days left.<eos> Well, it's not just about the date.<eos> Does she have a job, a place to live, money in the bank to support the child?<eos> And what if she did?
Neither do I, but then... I jumped ship.<eos> - So you don't believe in God?<eos> - Didn't say that.<eos> But I would like a fucking word.<eos> Ours is not to question why.<eos> No!<eos> Because, down here, we get to do what we please. Right?<eos> Take him.<eos> Take him down!<eos> - Sarge, I don't... - No!
You get nine balls, large chips and crackers.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> No, he doesn't like, um, crackers and he likes to have a small chips.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just, uh... My son, he's quite picky and he needs the meal number to be a prime number and there to be a prime number of prawn balls. And, um, if he had nine balls it wouldn't be a prime number and number 48 isn't...<eos> Isn't a prime...<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it? I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Though her combinatorics is her weakest area.<eos> I'm really not...<eos> Not that good.<eos> No, but you soon will be.<eos> Nathan, are you okay?<eos> Almost everyone on the camp speaks English.<eos> It is expected of us.<eos> You speak it very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So do you.
The third one will be whizzing around in orbit when it happens.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> As soon as all your hospital corners are done, I'll turn this on.<eos> You're confident of your corners?<eos> What difference will it make?<eos> Shouldn't you be upstairs?<eos> I should have lent you the money.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Probably wouldn't have had enough for a TV anyway.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.

I slipped her the key, and I told her to lock up on her way out.<eos> Oh, it's all my fault.<eos> Find anything at the morgue? Yeah.<eos> So, Wayne was banged up pretty bad.<eos> But on the back of his neck, just below his hairline... suction mark... identical to Carol's.<eos> Okay, so, they both had marks, just like the hot trainer at Rollz.<eos> But she was skinny... and alive.<eos> And just recently lost a ton of weight.<eos> When I asked her about the mark, she... she clammed up, got all embarrassed.<eos> So, I did some checking.
Why are you being so hard on everyone?<eos> Because there's no way That all of this is what it looks like.<eos> No way.<eos> Why not? Come on, man.<eos> I know you drank the kool-aid, okay?<eos> Look, amigo...<eos> I know this is all looks nuts, but I found it.<eos> Love and a family?<eos> Who cares where that comes from?<eos> I do.
I can't do this again.<eos> Susan, it's not like that.<eos> No, I can't!<eos> Susan!<eos> Susan, hang on.<eos> I had to make myself ready to die fo them?<eos> I know. I know.<eos> No, you don't. You don't know.<eos> That's the problem, you don't know.<eos> None of you do.
We know he likes a flutter. That's fine.<eos> We won't tell anyone.<eos> We just wondered if you'd seen him with any...you know, bad types.<eos> It's all bad types in here, love.<eos> How'd your friend get rolled up in this?<eos> She and Jasper had a thing going on the side.<eos> Selling.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> All right, I know Jasper.<eos> Everyone does.
Look, this isn't a trap, ma'am.<eos> You're the last living person to have had contact with DS Akers.<eos> We need to form a view of her mental state that night.<eos> All right.<eos> How was she behaving?<eos> She was... She was on edge.<eos> Nervous.<eos> I'd say very nervous.<eos> Did she give any reason why she wasn't in contact with her own team?<eos> No, she didn't.
Joe's car.<eos> No accident. Mm.<eos> He never once turns round so the camera can see him.<eos> That's cos he knows it's there.<eos> You get a trace on that car?<eos> Same story as the ambush - stolen vehicle, cloned plates.<eos> He's the go-between - you get him, you get the killers, you get the police officer they're working with.<eos> You never saw a face in the hospital?<eos> No.<eos> Only Georgia did.
Never saw your wife with it?<eos> I said I've never seen it before.<eos> Your wife, she was taking bribes, wasn't she?<eos> No.<eos> I thought you said you didn't ask!<eos> Well, I...<eos> It must've been pretty obvious something was going on.<eos> You didn't ask where this cash was coming from?<eos> No.<eos> Why not? I just didn't.
Come inside.<eos> Let me get you a drink.<eos> I'm teetotal, which you'd know if you hadn't ignored me for 20 years.<eos> I'm sure she will ask.<eos> If she doesn't, what will you tell her?<eos> Will you tell her about me anyway?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> She has a father.<eos> Damn right she does!
- What does it matter?<eos> It matters 'cause you got a chance to live, Danny.<eos> So I'm living.<eos> You look at life like it's a burden.<eos> Life is a gift, man.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> You better take that with you, too.<eos> Take it where, Kerwin?<eos> Take it where?<eos> They finally did it.
You did not just say that.<eos> Can you at least hear me out, please?<eos> Yes, okay, I've been the worst fucking boyfriend to you, when all you've ever been is supportive.<eos> Are you listening, Frank?<eos> This thing that I did...<eos> This thing with paying CJ and not telling you... It was wrong on every level and I can--<eos> Totally, I admit it now.<eos> Can you please come out here and talk to me?<eos> You don't want to hear what I've got to say.<eos> No, I do.
Because I want to build a machine that nobody else has the balls to build.<eos> Wow, you're serious.<eos> Look, that's a terrible idea.<eos> - For such a multitude of reasons that I... because it's illegal.<eos> Worst-case scenario, IBM sues us into the ground.<eos> Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.<eos> Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.<eos> Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.<eos> I'm sorry, but you missed it.<eos> We all did.
Double it.<eos> My wife makes 15 at TI.<eos> Well, then I feel sorry for her.<eos> So?<eos> What's it gonna be, Joe?<eos> Answer honestly.<eos> This is for legal record.<eos> False answers put you at risk of perjury, you understand?<eos> I'm sorry, you have to answer "yes" or "I do."<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
She's finding her feet.<eos> Right, gentlemen, listen to me.<eos> A police officer only has the right to detain a group of people... You need evidence to stand up in a court of law.<eos> They need evidence.<eos> Detain them for longer than 24 hours-- There's no proof.<eos> No proof.<eos> And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.<eos> We've got all day, so chop—chop.<eos> - Nobody said anything about hiding who we are.<eos> - Yes, they did. You.
What was that about? - He's gonna give him dance lessons.<eos> You joking?<eos> He was all prancing about like that.<eos> Listen, if you're gonna spend the rest of your life standing at the bar wishing you could speak to Debbie Thomas, that's fine by me.<eos> I'm gonna be a woman magnet.<eos> Where the bloody hell did you get that?<eos> - I don't know why you're so het up.<eos> They're going in the morning.<eos> Well, this strike matters to you two, does it?<eos> Of course it does.
You want people taking the piss, do you?<eos> Scabs, Coppers, calling us all sorts of names?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I know one thing. Your father would never have stood for it.<eos> That went well, considering.<eos> "Considering"?<eos> Sometimes people can surprise you, that's all I'm saying.<eos> I never had a problem with it, Sian.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear it, because this is Joe and he's gonna be sleeping in our house.<eos> How do?
That poor fucking kid we put in a fucking grave?<eos> You did all that for us too, huh?<eos> I didn't want to do any of that.<eos> It just got too fucked up.<eos> It just got so fucked up.<eos> I don't know how it got so fucked up.<eos> You have to fucking believe me, man, you have to believe me.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - I didn't have a fucking choice, man.<eos> - I didn't.
Kind of like Alcatraz, you know?<eos> We should go there!<eos> We?<eos> Yeah, the five of us should go and check it out.<eos> Why not?<eos> Could be fun.<eos> At least something different.<eos> Come on, you want to show these two lovely ladies a good time, don't you?<eos> But then, I thought you said we couldn't go there.<eos> I did.
I don't want to go.<eos> I know.<eos> I've been thinking about quitting the agency.<eos> Quitting?<eos> Why?<eos> We just got married.<eos> It doesn't change who you are.<eos> You love what you do.<eos> You don't want me to be here?<eos> Of course I do.
Please. You knew your asset wouldn't leave that prison.<eos> That was a field call, not an order.<eos> Did Weatherly know?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> You think I'm set up on you?<eos> Are you?<eos> No. But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
You gotta get in there for a race?<eos> How do you know I'm here to bet on a horse?<eos> We're in front of the O.T.B.<eos> And a deli and a hair center for men.<eos> You told me you come up here and bet.<eos> I love the idea that betting relaxes you.<eos> It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you. I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
I mean, I'm just cold.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You're okay.<eos> - We're okay.<eos> Why? No.<eos> - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't.
And he's nervous. In afghanistan, I led over 100 raids on insurgent camps.<eos> If anyone can make you real soldiers, it's me.<eos> Now, to start with, this unit doesn't even have a motto.<eos> A motto embodies the spirit of the unit!<eos> Shh. Ooh, how about, "give me back Those cds you borrowed, brian."<eos> That's not a motto.<eos> But it does need to be said.<eos> Let's talk about your appearance.<eos> Now, we've got a weight issue In this general area here.<eos> We do.
Uh, but we didn't really get to finish our talk the other day, and there's a lot left to be said, don't you think?<eos> Sorry! Um, come in!<eos> I don't really get to do a lot of inviting, so it kind of saps the etiquette out of a girl.<eos> Is everything okay with your friend?<eos> Yeah! Actually, things seem to be on the upswing. Thank you for asking.<eos> Um, I guess, I just needed to ask you again...<eos> Why I stayed away?<eos> And I know that I might not have the right...<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> Of course, you do.
I don't wanna kill you.<eos> I am sick and tired of trading guilt trips with you, Kenny.<eos> So I'm gonna say this one more time.<eos> Pick it up!<eos> You think I'm afraid of dying?<eos> You know, I was gonna leave that cell on my 18th birthday, get sick and die in my own piss and vomit.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I don't have any memories of touching my dad's hand, or what my mom smells like.<eos> You told me that a relationship between a vampire and his maker was special.<eos> - Yes, I did!
Look at me!<eos> I don't have any memories of touching my dad's hand, or what my mom smells like.<eos> You told me that a relationship between a vampire and his maker was special.<eos> - Yes, I did!<eos> - You said that it was magical!<eos> And that's the reason that I came back.<eos> There has to be more than just blood between us!<eos> You wanna know why I went after Josh?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Kenny wasn't gonna do anything!<eos> He's a time bomb, Josh.<eos> And you know it.<eos> Caroline, don't.<eos> I'm sorry, Josh, but after what happened here, it's pretty obvious we need to stick together.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Andrew...<eos> Is Emily OK?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
You know, when this is done, you get to have your life back.<eos> You can do whatever you want! I don't...<eos> I don't know what I want anymore.<eos> I... I... I screwed everything up!<eos> It's all I ever do.<eos> No, you can fix this!<eos> This is your chance!<eos> You can change things!<eos> - You really think that?<eos> - Yes! I really do.
So I did make her pregnant?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Doesn't work that way.<eos> Just how do women get babies?<eos> I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth-graders.<eos> Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail.<eos> Do you know how embarrassed I was To get a call at my arraignment For my behavior during the pub crawl<eos> My son placed on his art teacher? I didn't mean to make her pregnant.<eos> I just hate art so much.<eos> Oh, everyone does, son.
The lore changes blog to blog.<eos> He's not a Tulpa.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> All right.<eos> Right here, right now, cut the crap.<eos> Do either of you actually know what Thinman is?<eos> No.<eos> We just play Supernaturalists on TV.<eos> We have no idea what we're doing.<eos> Of course we do.
He said he couldn't talk about it over the phone. Why?<eos> Because he is a weird guy, okay?<eos> He's a weird, dorky, little guy.<eos> But he happens to have an army of Angels behind him, and, even though I hate to say it, if we're gonna take a shot at Metatron, they might be useful.<eos> Well, do you think we need the First Blade?<eos> Why don't we just leave that here?<eos> We talked about this, and we decided that --<eos> No.<eos> In all fairness, we didn't decide.<eos> You did.
Is it a shell?<eos> - Open it.<eos> - Help me.<eos> This isn't zirconia. It's real diamonds.<eos> Really?<eos> Like yours?<eos> Do we have the same now?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you like them?<eos> - Of course I do.
Gennaro...<eos> Thanks for calling me,<eos> I'm glad to be with you at this moment.<eos> There are no words.<eos> C'mon, Ciro, there's room for you too.<eos> Mom's not in there, nothing's in there,<eos> Mom's gone.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> The God who sees all, knows all.<eos> I do.
But it's here now, I realize this research without it.<eos> Sorry I'm late, Captain.<eos> What was it this time, Mr. Allen?<eos> Forgot to set the alarm?<eos> Before you answer, remember you the excuse last time... It was... " car trouble .".<eos> Wondering why do I remember?<eos> I do not have a car.<eos> He made me an errand to me.<eos> Barry? , Got me what I asked for?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
(sighs) I love you, baby.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Swear to keep this place secret.<eos> No human can know about it.<eos> Eljida and your son's life depend on it.<eos> BOY (crying): Mommy... I want Mommy.<eos> (boat motor chugging)<eos> You'll see your mother again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> After today, I do, too.
Anyway, I-I didn't understand it.<eos> I didn't take it seriously enough.<eos> Your mother was a good woman, Maggie.<eos> If she did anything wrong, it was my fault.<eos> I should have been more understanding.<eos> Okay?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Did you know that Agent Bellamy has gone over my head and gotten a federal court order to open the tomb?<eos> I did.
We found Jacob's remains.<eos> Everything was normal.<eos> Look, Uncle Henry... I'm sorry we put you through that.<eos> You know, I...<eos> I think I can manage this just fine, you know.<eos> I'm sorry I troubled you, Maggie.<eos> Uncle Henry.<eos> Mr. Langston.<eos> I hope it was worth it.<eos> So do I.
We mothers decided to take charge of our children's education...<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> So we started a school.<eos> Unfortunately, the church burned, and the classroom is currently located here in the saloon.<eos> The...<eos> The school is in the saloon?<eos> It's the only place big enough to hold our children, Miss Thatcher.<eos> We had requested a mature, experienced teacher, someone who would not shrink from the challenges that Coal Valley presents.<eos> I realize I'm perhaps not what you expected, but I assure you I am acquainted with the most modern teaching theories, the superintendent of schools did tell you what happened here?<eos> No, he didn't.
I don't want to lose her, but if we can't manage a wedding, how are we going to manage a lifetime of marriage?<eos> It's normal to have doubts.<eos> I have some terrible doubts of my own right now.<eos> - About me?<eos> - No, no.<eos> Someone else.<eos> You know, when your father and I first announced our wedding, Brandon, I was so nervous.<eos> A free spirit like me, marrying a policeman?<eos> How was that ever gonna work?<eos> But it did.
Commander Bisgaard is on the scene.<eos> First rule of officer safety:<eos> if you can't protect yourself, you can't protect anyone.<eos> - Don't ever do this again.<eos> - I'm sorry, sir. I didn't...<eos> I know Lieutenant Dunn is in charge here...<eos> The bodies were discovered over here, sir.<eos> Did you discover the bodies, Lieutenant Dunn?<eos> No, Commander.<eos> Detective Jensen did.
She accosted him at the hospital, Frank, reminded him that he wasn't a cop and he didn't carry a gun.<eos> She humiliated him.<eos> I know that you're afraid.<eos> They're always afraid.<eos> They teach you how to do that?<eos> Wait.<eos> Did Kapp Security work the steel mill demolition site?<eos> Frank, if they worked security at the steel mill demolition site, then it is definitely him.<eos> That's how he found where to hide the bodies.<eos> Did Krogh?
But just so you know, that was a very cruel thing to say.<eos> She spanked Miguel?<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> - I am shocked.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, what did he do?<eos> Your "perfect child" must have done something wrong.<eos> - What was it?<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> Miss Lucinda did violence on him.
Zoila's Pablo.<eos> Her ex-husband?<eos> Her current husband, but thanks for asking.<eos> Is she here?<eos> She's making breakfast.<eos> That smells good.<eos> If you invite him to eat with us, I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We really, really do.
What kind of trouble?<eos> Ethan, before you go, I need to ask you something.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Why...<eos> Why did Nicholas let your mother live here all these years?<eos> Did she have something on him?<eos> I'm not sure what it was, but yeah.<eos> She had something.<eos> Of course, mom couldn't really tell anyone because Nick saw her push Dahlia off the bridge.<eos> We both did.
Hey, Produce, you want to go play some games?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Bye.<eos> - See ya later.<eos> Wait...<eos> - Wait... - We just got ditched.<eos> Yeah, I think your daughter just stole him from me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How you doing?
Good choice, Trina.<eos> Wow, this is a tight race.<eos> In fact, it's dead even.<eos> Lissa doesn't even want to be cheer captain.<eos> Well, if I'm called to serve, I guess I'd have no choice.<eos> Jenna, the equipment girl, may I have your ballot, please?<eos> - I get a vote?<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You're just the team's bitch-slave.<eos> Actually, you do.
There's nothing like one of your reproachful stares to make a person toe the line.<eos> He's scared I'll hit him with my stick.<eos> Right, Jacob... ..are you ready for a spot of crowd control after lunch?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's called Quiche Lorraine, according to Mrs B.<eos> Pass me the beetroot.<eos> With Sister Julienne's permission, I'll make myself a sandwich.<eos> Of course.<eos> What I want to know is does Nurse Lee say when she's coming back?<eos> No, she doesn't.
If you think you're here to bawl like a publican...<eos> Hardly, Sister.<eos> Certainly loud and clear, but I...<eos> Or upset mothers with unhelpful remarks about their babies,<eos> I think your time would be better spent elsewhere.<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> Here are your district patients for today.<eos> I know Nurse Noakes will be relieved to have your support.<eos> Sister Julienne, you know that I came to Nonnatus House specifically to enhance my midwifery.<eos> I do.
"Clinton, you're spending too much time playing computer games."<eos> "You need to go to school."<eos> "You need to go to college."<eos> and he would tell me,<eos> "I want to be able to play games and get paid for it."<eos> Now he said this at a very young age before Dota ever came along.<eos> And I thought, well, you know, he's going to grow out of it.<eos> He's going to get sick and tired of sitting there in front of that computer and playing.<eos> Never did.<eos> Never did.
- Are you high?<eos> - No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do.
- No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do.<eos> I definitely do.
Everyone's gone.<eos> - Hello, Carmen.<eos> - Hi, Mr. Solomon.<eos> This is my friend, Max and we need to talk to you about something.<eos> Oh, come.<eos> How are you?<eos> These men, they said they want to kill me?<eos> They said they would burn your building down with you in it, so, yeah.<eos> You believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Are you honestly advocate...<eos> how can you even suggest...<eos> I'm not suggesting anything.<eos> She... she was depressed. She killed herself.<eos> - If she's capable of that, she...<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> No.<eos> Janine, you have to know I didn't want this.<eos> You wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
About James?<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Of course. Some sort of rest cure, yes?<eos> Thank you for your discretion.<eos> Actually, I was intending to visit your mother so your invitation's very timely.<eos> To see her for...?<eos> A private matter.<eos> It's perfect, then.<eos> Did Olivia happen to mention I'm storing pennies in heaven to aid my cause with Anna?<eos> No, she didn't.
Daddy, Kate's innocent.<eos> The KGB set her up.<eos> They've obviously been on to us ever since Mallory went off the rails.<eos> Daddy: Say that's true.<eos> Say they knew Arkady was compromised.<eos> They wanted to send us on a wild goose chase.<eos> Why sacrifice such hugely valuable intel to do it?<eos> Sarah: I agree.<eos> They had the resources to sabotage Lakenheath, to devastate us.<eos> No, they didn't.
Sunburn.<eos> Is that it?<eos> We've met. Maybe.<eos> Not the sort of face you forget.<eos> This enough?<eos> It's just a car you wanted to do, isn't it?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Christ, be careful with it!<eos> Where did you say you were from?<eos> I didn't.
But now you have a lot of work to do, so I need you to begin.<eos> Start here.<eos> My husband called two days ago, said that he'd taken our daughter Tory, and not to tell anyone or it would be bad for her.<eos> I guess I never knew him.<eos> Is that the man my husband shot?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Just what the hell do you think you're doing here, Secret Service?<eos> This is where the FBI works.<eos> Agent Finley, I thought I made it clear you are not working this.<eos> Yes, Agent Dunn, you did.
What's behind that door?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He doesn't work for me. He runs our spies here.<eos> Dunn.<eos> Kyle Devore's GPS is back online.<eos> We tracked it to the Pakistani Embassy.<eos> The President's son could be in that building.<eos> SWAT should be on scene.<eos> - You hear what Olsen said?<eos> - Yes, ma'am, I did.
It's just a game.<eos> Seems like grace really likes you.<eos> You like her?<eos> -Confidentially?<eos> -Absolutely.<eos> - I like her.<eos> - I like her more than I've liked any other girl before.<eos> - Think it's love?<eos> I've only told one other girl that I loved her, and that did not end the way that I expected it to, so...<eos> - Yeah, they don't always.
It's just one last piece of business we need to settle before we can get divorced.<eos> [Sighs] Wow.<eos> You know, you, uh... Don't have to be so mean.<eos> - You're trying to hurt me. - I'm not.<eos> I'm not trying to hurt you.<eos> I'm trying to get rid of you.<eos> We don't need to talk anymore, okay?<eos> You've made your choice.<eos> Yeah, but that doesn't negate our life together.<eos> Of course it does.
I left my earring at his loft.<eos> You "left your earring" at his loft?<eos> No, I didn't "leave" my earring.<eos> I left my earring.<eos> It must've fallen out when we were...<eos> Ripping each other's clothes off.<eos> Kill me now.<eos> - Why? ! This is amazing.<eos> - I'm sorry, does it not seem like I left my jewelry at his house in a childish ploy to see him again?<eos> Yeah. No, it totally does. 100%.
A ribbon.<eos> Okay. Well, the camel guy showed up, so that's a relief.<eos> What would I have done with this fork-horned saddle?<eos> You're late.<eos> Did you get the votives?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Why not?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Harry, I got a camel... A real, live, leaf-eating, cud-chewing camel.<eos> I did lanterns instead.
I'm sorry she sprang that on you.<eos> Why would you let her think that I would see him?<eos> We all hoped you'd give him a chance.<eos> He's changed.<eos> You've seen him?<eos> Yes, and he wants to be a family again.<eos> He walked out on us.<eos> Why would you expose Esme to a man like that?<eos> - Reagan's father isn't alive anymore. - He will do her... - This is the only grandfather she has.<eos> - ...exactly what he did to us.
Previously on "Black Box"...<eos> I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with.<eos> What happened between us...<eos> It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.

Apple pie.<eos> This is my favorite.<eos> Ruby doesn't eat sweets 'cause she's diabetic, but I'm certainly gonna enjoy this.<eos> Where's pops?<eos> I want Catherine to meet him.<eos> Uh, he's, uh, watching TV.<eos> Pops!<eos> Pops, come on, man!<eos> - You didn't tell me she's diabetic.<eos> - I did.
It must be in my lab coat.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I didn't know what to think after the dinner with my parents.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was, uh... I was distracted.<eos> My... my patient was in critical condition.<eos> I'm sorry. Couldn't have taken one night off?<eos> No, I'm a doctor.<eos> Of course... you know that. I can't take a night off.<eos> My parents don't.
I remember that last time.<eos> - We were there.<eos> - He was the life of the party.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Right you are.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move over.<eos> Come on, I don't have enough space.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Legally.<eos> Not today.<eos> But that's going to change.<eos> Is it so, senator Lloyd?<eos> Well, America is a mighty vessel, sir. - It's not easily turned.<eos> - However...<eos> The political capital needed to effect a change of such sweeping...<eos> However, your informed opinion...<eos> - I don't recall precisely...<eos> - Of course you do.
But it still does in the end.<eos> I've taken this as far as I can in culture.<eos> I need to see how it reacts in living tissue.<eos> I can start animal studies to test efficacy and safety right away.<eos> - We could have results in 24 hours.<eos> - I'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist, Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this.<eos> I think she could be a big help.<eos> - Alan, this is progress.<eos> - It has to work in the rats first.<eos> - And if it does?
Found anything?<eos> She died of an embolism.<eos> A scan revealed bruising in the left hemisphere of her brain, consistent with an air bubble.<eos> So it was natural causes.<eos> Why would anyone have erased the security footage?<eos> Did you see Doreen yesterday?<eos> Just in passing.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> About her research? - Any breakthrough she might've had?<eos> - No, she didn't.
We'll finish this at Division.<eos> I'll have a car waiting for you downstairs.<eos> You need a lawyer, you know that, right?<eos> - I'll deal with it. - Someone should call Mom.<eos> - No, wait, no, no...<eos> - You need a lawyer.<eos> I don't need Mom.<eos> Or you.<eos> Does Dad know I'm here?<eos> - Of course he does.
It's bumming me out.<eos> When was the last time you had a drink?<eos> Like five minutes ago.<eos> What about your 53 days? It's more like 40.<eos> I might've been stretching the truth a little.<eos> Besides, I've got a system.<eos> No, systems don't work. Okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I've seen them all.<eos> This one does. Rush?
- You still tweaking', Bob?<eos> - I'm not that man anymore.<eos> You have anything else you want to know?<eos> Yeah, what do you got going on up at that ranch?<eos> The lord's work.<eos> A safe haven<eos> The path.<eos> For the moment... I'm gonna let her go with you, all right? But you're responsible for her.<eos> If anything happens to her, you answer to me, do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- A subsidy for nuclear power?<eos> The richest of the rich?<eos> How's that gonna play?<eos> We're dealing with a national crisis. We can't get sidetracked with public opinion.<eos> It would show China we're willing to wait this out.<eos> Do we have the resources?<eos> I'd have to run the numbers, anticipate fluctuations,<eos> - consider different models...<eos> - Your best guess.<eos> We do. For a moderate stockpile.
Take the plea.<eos> Be good.<eos> Get out early.<eos> Everybody's fucked me.<eos> If I was trying to fuck you, I wouldn't be here.<eos> He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> She better be gone by the next time we talk.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - What took you so long?<eos> I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I had Seth do it.<eos> He doesn't have security clearance.<eos> Well, he does now.
A child's home.<eos> It's my childhood home.<eos> It's in Vinci.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll ready some horses.<eos> You're not coming with me.<eos> After all the nonsense this quest of yours has put me through, how could I not?<eos> I heard you.<eos> I had faith that you still thought of me.<eos> You do.
- I don't know. Maybe.<eos> The more time we spend together, the more I realize that we have a connection.<eos> I don't know if you felt it. Maybe you... maybe... maybe you haven't.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Dom, I'm...<eos> I had no idea of this, okay?<eos> You know what? I don't really care who knew what when. All right?<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> I didn't mean it to go like that.<eos> - Don't.
I have beer.<eos> We're fine, right?<eos> I mean, I-I know...<eos> That we don't see each other enough and that I'm really bad with phone calls, but, I mean, o-our...<eos> Relationship I-is fine, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, I think so, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, so do I.
I shouldn't have s...<eos> No, Toni, Toni, this is not on you, okay?<eos> It's not on you.<eos> I just... I need go.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> You're angry.<eos> Good. You should be.<eos> You're finally realizing what I knew all along.<eos> Savi doesn't deserve you.<eos> She never did.
Previously on "Mistresses"...<eos> It's Paul. Please don't hang up.<eos> I'm in trouble.<eos> And it's serious.<eos> I got mixed up with some bad people.<eos> Paul, who is after you?<eos> You like when people need you.<eos> Dom doesn't need you. He just loves you.<eos> Savi doesn't deserve you.<eos> She never did.
It's like when you find the right one, you know, you just... uh, w-why you telling me this, Scott?<eos> Right.<eos> Um, 'cause I need your advice on something.<eos> Um...<eos> The girls...<eos> Savi, Karen, April... do I tell them what I have planned?<eos> 'Cause Janet's got me freaking out, man, and I just want to make sure that, you know, Joss' key people show up.<eos> Yeah, well... I-I-I think if you really want it to be romantic, you know, um, effortless for her, do not tell them. [Chuckles]<eos> Her ladies cannot keep a secret to save their lives, but they... they will show up for her.<eos> They always do.
Yeah.<eos> That was pretty damn funny.<eos> - Can I come in?<eos> Pretty great out there today.<eos> If I had known hurting my face was a possibility,<eos> I never would have wrestled.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, look. I know it seems like I don't care about a lot of the things you do.<eos> I know you do, dad.<eos> No, really, I don't.
All part of the performance, it's just not my performance you're watching.<eos> You'll be found guilty and given the federal death penalty.<eos> I'm trying to save your life.<eos> I guess I'll have to save my own life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> My name is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> You don't?
So you discount the encephalitis he was suffering as a cause?<eos> He managed his illness with the help of his neurologist, whom he murdered for his trouble.<eos> Is Will Graham an intelligent psychopath?<eos> There is not yet a name for whatever Will Graham is.<eos> He kills methodically and I believe would kill again, given the opportunity.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Chilton.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Dr. Chilton, Will Graham spent his time catching murderers for the FBI.<eos> You don't see a contradiction between that and your description of a coldblooded killer?<eos> No, I do not.
Previously on Hannibal...<eos> Who stitched him into the mural?<eos> - You have an idea who that might be?<eos> - I do.
- How'd it go today? - It was fun.<eos> Alicia came to work with me and helped treat cats and dogs.<eos> And one parrot.<eos> His name was, uh...<eos> - Beauregard.<eos> - Beauregard.<eos> He was pretty chatty.<eos> So you had a good day?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I did.
It's a video-store membership.<eos> I'm banned. You're not.<eos> I've prepaid for 50 movies, which should last you about a month.<eos> Up next, "Rhinestone," starring Sylvester Stallone.<eos> Oh, "Rhinestone"!<eos> I hear Stallone sings in this one.<eos> Is there nothing that man cannot do? No!<eos> He's Rambo!<eos> He's Rocky!<eos> He doesn't do country music.
All right.<eos> Wait.<eos> I couldn't find Katrina's amulet.<eos> My God, you're parched.<eos> Here.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Lieutenant, no!<eos> She doesn't belong to you.<eos> You both do now.
No funny business.<eos> Great. Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Where's the vault?<eos> - Oh, it's over here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Gracias.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Good. So you're headed to the vault. Right.<eos> Lucille, do you have the stockings?<eos> Yes, I do.
Sepia.<eos> Noir.<eos> You look so good you don't even need a filter.<eos> Oh, Mr. Deeks, I'd like to remind you that you're going undercover.<eos> I'd better not find that... selfie on your Instagram.<eos> Wait a minute, you follow my Instagram? Yes.<eos> And if I have to look at one more picture of Monty in his sunglasses, I'm going to have Eric crash the account.<eos> Check.<eos> Selfie... gone.<eos> How you doing, Ehsan?
No.<eos> We got a lead on some movement.<eos> Where?<eos> I'll show you when we get there.<eos> You said you were a good tracker, right?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Good.<eos> There's no surveillance.<eos> We're clean.<eos> Sisters really did well for themselves.
Say no.<eos> - Say no. Say no.<eos> - Say no.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> We're not. [Laughs]<eos> Goodbye, Laura.<eos> I'm so glad you're eating again.<eos> Man, we keep saying how bad Tommy is at this, but maybe he's better than all of us. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I did it all wrong.
There's no one here to stop you.<eos> How's it progressing, love?<eos> It isn't.<eos> What's the issue?<eos> The issue is that Miss Brownlee's Finishing School never taught me the French words for coagulate or duodenum or infarction.<eos> It's all very technical.<eos> I was taught to serve tea cakes.<eos> If you needed assistance deciphering a restaurant menu, then I'd be your girl.<eos> Everett, I tried.<eos> No, no, no, yeah, you did.
Uh, Blake will be your image consultant, all right?<eos> And, uh, Adam... Political advisor.<eos> Hi-de-ho, good neighbor.<eos> And I'll be campaign manager, of course, okay?<eos> Why do you get to be campaign manager, huh?<eos> That doesn't sound like teamwork, Ders.<eos> I'm taking a leadership role, okay?<eos> - You can't spell it without "Ders".<eos> - You can't spell "it" without "Ders"? I-T.<eos> I just did.
This is as far as they go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got it from here. This better be worth my time.<eos> It's worth more than that.<eos> Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Freedom, Agent Burke.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> Look, this could be a setup. We don't know what's in there.<eos> - I do, evidence.
Rebecca Lowe, I got this number from one of your associates.<eos> I'm in need of your... services immediately.<eos> Call me back.<eos> We need to see where this leads.<eos> If Rebecca's other clients are anything like Hagen...<eos> Someone could end up dead.<eos> The caller got her name and number secondhand.<eos> We could send someone undercover to meet him.<eos> If he knows what she looks like, he'll bolt.<eos> - But if he doesn't...
Then I determine what the job is, pretend to carry it out, and deliver evidence of completion to our mystery man, which, given Rebecca's history, might include murder.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, Diana, truth is, who knows if we even have a case?<eos> You know, I just wanted to bring you up to speed.<eos> Tons of unknowns, and I'm not sure if we'll pursue it.<eos> Peter, I'm in.<eos> A bad guy wants to hire a bad girl to do some really bad stuff.<eos> I'm the best person in the division to keep that from happening.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
I need to keep you fit.<eos> What will I do for three whole days?<eos> - One franc for egg and chips?<eos> - See why I insisted you and Norm come with us?<eos> Are we getting the usual?<eos> One eggs? Two eggs?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm... I'm not hungry.<eos> - Do you not want to be here?<eos> - No, no, of course I do.
Hi.<eos> Hello David.<eos> It's always a pleasure meeting one of Brody's "hookups", especially after I've just been dumped.<eos> What happened?<eos> Like you have to ask?<eos> You want me to come over?<eos> That depends.<eos> Do you like strawberries infused with cognac hand dipped in dark chocolate?<eos> Strawberries and cognac? Can I come?<eos> You already did.
Yeah, can I get you a drink?<eos> I trained you well.<eos> Nope, I got it.<eos> Hey, can we stop by my place, I didn't have time to go back to the station.<eos> Sure, whatever you need to do.<eos> I waited all day for that.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> I rarely see you in uniform.<eos> You like a man in uniform?<eos> Who doesn't?
That's the guy who came after me at my mom's house. Yes!<eos> Okay, that should be the seed value...<eos> the... the key code for the blur.<eos> Now you should be able to use the code to try... It's working.<eos> Weatherly.<eos> All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it.<eos> No one saw it. Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going? Yeah.<eos> He did.
What kind of service?<eos> Anything you command, if only you'd free my hands.<eos> But it's vital that any servant of mine conduct himself properly.<eos> I hope you're not prone to unseemly conduct, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Well, I believe there's nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.<eos> Then you've washed up on the right island.<eos> Oy!<eos> I've never heard such talk, not from a lady.<eos> You disapprove?<eos> I most heartily do not.
You've got a loyal fellow there, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Treat him well.<eos> I must express my gratitude for your intervention.<eos> They do say the true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good.<eos> They do.<eos> However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
There'll be no kings.<eos> Of course, who needs them, huh?<eos> Who needs a king when you've got Blackbeard?<eos> We don't use that name here.<eos> Commodore Teach, then.<eos> But remind me, Ed, who was it exactly who elected you commodore, eh?<eos> If I remember rightly, it was, um... It was you, yourself.<eos> He woke up one morning, and he thought, "oh, commodore."<eos> That has a merry ring to it."<eos> And so it does.
All that to get what you wanted?<eos> Oh, if I'd done him myself, I might have come across as disagreeable.<eos> And those men, those assassins... you were unarmed?<eos> It had to look compelling.<eos> They could have killed you.<eos> You imagine so?<eos> Truthfully?<eos> Don't get yourself into harm's way again.<eos> What do you mean "again"?<eos> I never did it once.
Guess who!<eos> Hmm. I wonder.<eos> Enzo.<eos> Hello, Damon.<eos> We have a bit of business to attend to.<eos> Missed a spot.<eos> Ooh! Oh. I love a good fire.<eos> Oh!<eos> That's ironic, isn't it, you know, since you left me to burn alive in one?<eos> Didn't we already do this?
We gotta invite her to something that Elena can't say no to.<eos> A surprise party?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I wanted a spa day.<eos> You try feeling the death of every supernatural creature who passes through you on their way to the other side.<eos> I'm not saying you don't deserve it.<eos> Besides, your birthday isn't until next week.<eos> That's what makes it a surprise.<eos> Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would want a big party for her birthday.<eos> Of course she does.
No, I want to stay with Stefan.<eos> Very well.<eos> Best of luck.<eos> Wait, you said that you weren't gonna hurt him.<eos> No, I said I'd try not to hurt him.<eos> We need his blood for the spell.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Tessa didn't need my blood when she linked me to Silas.<eos> Good for her.<eos> We do.
I'm the one who gets people to do things they don't want to do.<eos> I killed Aaron Whitmore.<eos> You did not kill Aaron Whitmore.<eos> I did.<eos> I thought you broke my heart, so I rip open Aaron's neck.<eos> That is how much control you have over me.<eos> And I'm still here.<eos> That's how much control you have over me.<eos> This has to end.<eos> It just did.
Assaulting a police officer.<eos> And we have a winner.<eos> Where's my damn key card?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> My key card. For work.<eos> Well, probably in your purse.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You know how sometimes, honey, you take a couple dollars out of my purse and you forget to tell me?<eos> Maybe you took it by mistake?<eos> I did not.
Just a moment, please. I'll see if he's in.<eos> Sometimes puns can be punny.<eos> - What'd I just say?<eos> - Professor Sabbith?<eos> Jacob, you don't have to call me professor anymore. It's Sloan.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you. Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.<eos> - God, everybody does.
Oh, you better not.<eos> What a fun family.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're all downstairs.<eos> Well, then you shouldn't make any loud noises.<eos> It's 8:15.<eos> I think I lost my balance.<eos> - Lulu, you need to knock.<eos> - Oh, sorry. This sheet says Dan has to be tested every two hours to make sure his head is working.<eos> It does?
You know, I want a... a true life partner.<eos> I... I think deep down she does, too.<eos> Is this session, uh, 50 minutes or an hour?<eos> 50 minutes.<eos> You know, Ms. Parker, a reluctance to communicate may come from a person's fear of repercussions from their expressed feelings.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> Or silence is a way to control the people who love you.<eos> And you think your wife is trying to control you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
- What time was it?<eos> - Midnight.<eos> - I know because we had to go.<eos> - Where did you leave them?<eos> On the road. At the edge of town.<eos> - Did they have boyfriends?<eos> - No.<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - I don't.
That's right.<eos> I wear a hat too.<eos> Does that make me a suspect too?<eos> I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.<eos> Now please leave.<eos> I'll call you when I hear back.<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know how things work around here.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Come on in.<eos> So how's the hand?<eos> Oh, good as new.<eos> At least that's what they're telling me, so...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, Callie's changing.<eos> Cool, thanks.<eos> Sorry about that stupid judge. How'd Jude take it?<eos> He was pretty upset, but he definitely understands why I don't want to find this Robert guy.<eos> He does?
Um, I was just... going over it, you know, before I...<eos> Hey, it's going to be ok.<eos> You may be a little out of practice, but you'll be back to 100 percent before you know it.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm ok, Mom.<eos> I just wanted to say goodnight, and I love you. And call your dad, please, he misses you.<eos> Uh, did he tell you... that Dani's moving in with him?<eos> Danni's moving in?<eos> No, he didn't. It's his life, though I still don't understand why he didn't break up with her, but that's... none of my business, right?<eos> He did.
So what's happening now?<eos> We just... we need to go through everything one more time.<eos> But he has to have me in there too, doesn't he?<eos> He's still a minor.<eos> Isn't that the law?<eos> No, he's not under arrest.<eos> He's just talking to me.<eos> You don't legally have to be in there.<eos> But if Norman wants you in there anyway, - that's fine with me.<eos> - No, I-I don't.
I erm...<eos> What?<eos> I've been trying to hack into these SFPD servers.<eos> The new algorithms they have on their... firewall, it's... it's impossible.<eos> - I'm gonna need more time.<eos> - How long?<eos> Probably a couple of days.<eos> We don't have a couple of days, buddy.<eos> How do you even know if the cops even know anything?<eos> Well, maybe they do, maybe they don't.
Actually, according to this piece of paper, it's our house now.<eos> Hey.<eos> You got any idea what that thing is worth?<eos> What, like... 100 bucks?<eos> That's a third-model Colt Dragoon used by Confederate General William Mahone.<eos> So more than $100?<eos> Probably more than your annual salary.<eos> Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
No, it wasn't till I got this job and started dating cops that I got turned off from all y'all.<eos> Maybe I'm different.<eos> You are different.<eos> You're livin' in a criminal's house, drivin' his car, drinkin' his wine.<eos> I have my own place.<eos> Above a college bar.<eos> And then there's the kid in Florida.<eos> She's fine with her mother.<eos> Yeah, but shouldn't you and her be tryin' to make it work?<eos> We did.
My electrolytes are low.<eos> Here, drink this.<eos> It's close enough, I guess.<eos> Did you do it, man?<eos> Did you get laid?<eos> Can you... got to use a glass.<eos> Come on. Seriously.<eos> They're all dirty.<eos> So you like her?<eos> Yeah, I do. Yeah, I really do.
Ma'am, I swear to God, we all thought he was gonna just eat some shrimp, rattle off a few platitudes, go home, watch Full Meta! Jacket for the millionth time and fall asleep.<eos> Kelly, tell Mike to climb off his wife and get on the speakerphone, now.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay?<eos> This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
What's wrong with that lady's face?<eos> Looks like something crawled up in there and died.<eos> - Mike, child care has been axed.<eos> - What?<eos> You need to dump Alicia, sensitively.<eos> I can't!<eos> Yes, she's really, really into it.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - You look like you killed a hooker.<eos> - No, I didn't. Um...
She as kind of flipping out.<eos> You know, she got it in her head I was trying to hurt her.<eos> - Can you believe that?<eos> - I've seen it before. No problem.<eos> People, when they get into closed spaces, sometimes they get a little crazy.<eos> I'll just get her out.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm just gonna help you.<eos> Yeah, don't.
Those who arrive survive."<eos> Sorry.<eos> You can smile.<eos> You're alive. I get it.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.<eos> We don't know if anybody got out.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
Did anyone see you come in?<eos> It's okay. Um...<eos> It was next-door.<eos> I promise it won't always be like this.<eos> I always envisioned my secret romantic liaisons surrounded by... buckets of bleach.<eos> I just talked to your uncle.<eos> - He's having a meeting with Gloria.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Did he tell you about Dinaskyu?<eos> He did.
You can't leave me.<eos> Piper, I'm in danger.<eos> But I don't have anyone left.<eos> I'm sorry, Piper.<eos> I'm sorry for all of it.<eos> I know that my track record is shit... but I really do love you.<eos> Yeah, well, I hate you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm trying to reach him, but he lost control.<eos> Then he nearly killed somebody, which I obviously couldn't let happen, and in the process--<eos> Turner got away.<eos> What was he there to steal?<eos> Merlyn's art collection?<eos> Something much more dangerous.<eos> It's a prototype earthquake machine.<eos> Oh, holy God.<eos> Why would Turner want to destroy the city?<eos> He doesn't.
What changed your mind?<eos> Thea. Hmm.<eos> She reminded me that I still owe this city.<eos> And I want to be remembered as something more than Malcolm Merlyn's pawn.<eos> As you should.<eos> But you know there was another reason for my reticence.<eos> You're afraid the people will learn that Robert wasn't her biological father.<eos> I managed to get through a criminal trial without the truth coming out, but political campaigns tend to be a bit more adept at extracting skeletons from closets.<eos> But no one else knows.<eos> Someone does.
Believe me, there is no such thing.<eos> There is only poverty in poverty and struggle in struggle.<eos> And one day you'll wake up and realize that and it'll be too late.<eos> Thackery is doing things no other surgeon is doing.<eos> And with good reason.<eos> How he defiled that girl.<eos> He's a showman, nothing more.<eos> All Thackery wants is a goo-goo-eyed puppy, and he has that in you.<eos> How he treats you.<eos> How they all do.
- Let's go inside.<eos> - All right.<eos> So let's talk bypass, shall we?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm still in awe of you, by the way...<eos> Going off on Lee Berman, that arrogant ass.<eos> Well, I'm sure you could tell him whatever you wanted, and he'd actually listen.<eos> You would think so, yes.<eos> Yes, you would, but it doesn't work that way.<eos> - Why doesn't it?
- You were a couple, right? - Mm.<eos> Yeah, for a few years.<eos> - A bit of a love triangle there. - Mm.<eos> I saw him after I had talked to Diana, out by the garage.<eos> We talked for a while, and he...<eos> He wanted to show me a fox den.<eos> He wanted to head into the woods, but I didn't want to come.<eos> - But you didn't mention that before.<eos> -I did. - No.<eos> -Yes, I did.
I don't feel very comfortable about this.<eos> That's because those mean girls tried to make you feel like you don't belong, but you do.<eos> Tessa, what a nice surprise to see you here.<eos> In other words, what are you doing here?<eos> I am here to register a unique and gifted friend of mine.<eos> Sorry. I had a rock-hard one in there.<eos> You know this is a pageant, right?<eos> In which we, the judges, will be ranking young ladies based on their poise, elegance, and talent.<eos> And this young lady has all of the above.<eos> Well, of course she does.
Many thanks, buddy.<eos> See?<eos> What I tell you?<eos> Let the healing begin.<eos> Brian, do you wanna go to dinner at my mom's house tomorrow?<eos> Don't believe I can, we're gonna be busy.<eos> I'm asking Voodoo to dinner.<eos> Italian.<eos> Voodoo?<eos> Um... uh, Bri, Voodoo doesn't really do dinner dates with guys.
I'm not his girlfriend.<eos> Besides, I hate guys who're all like "she's my girl" anyway.<eos> He's self-centered, selfish and hot-tempered. Sounds like you know a lot about him!<eos> Dumbass!<eos> I told you I'm not!<eos> That's so cool. To be able to say "dumbass" and stuff like that.<eos> Kazuki. Do I look like someone who had an abortion?<eos> Don't know why they've been saying stuff like that about me behind my back. I didn't have an abortion.<eos> You have to believe me, Kazuki.<eos> Of course you didn't!
I wasn't sure which flowers would say, uh...<eos> "I'm sorry I didn't tell you about my pregnant roommate"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just... I couldn't figure out how to explain Shelby without scaring you off, - ...so I'm just gonna dive in.<eos> - There's really no need.<eos> - Yeah, there is.<eos> - I want you to understand.<eos> - I do, I understand.<eos> I ran into Shelby this morning, and she explained the whole thing.<eos> Oh, boy. She did, huh?
And it's not like we can't afford an expert, - 'cause we totally can.<eos> - We we just prefer to use someone who knows Mason more intimately than just a one-hour, court-ordered evaluation.<eos> - Does this witness have a name?<eos> - Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Professor Marcel Ziff.<eos> Do you remember meeting us yesterday at the faculty event?<eos> Yes. And as I recall, you were asked to leave.<eos> Do you remember telling us that you thought Mason was insane?<eos> I never said that.<eos> And didn't you... what?
We don't... we don't call it gambling.<eos> You know, w... we see it more as an experiment in probability.<eos> Coach Kotsky, don't you dare try and put lipstick on this pig.<eos> I'm confiscating that pool money when this is over.<eos> I am very disappointed that you have tarnished the good name of Richard Nixon Middle School.<eos> This is why I have to bug all of the offices.<eos> Now let's get back to the fair.<eos> Lily, when you told me about your project on the bus, I thought it sounded good.<eos> I thought you could win.<eos> - Yeah, we both did.
Run it through the database. See if anything pops.<eos> You got it.<eos> Jane.<eos> Scooch over.<eos> How often do you sleep in your own bed, anyway?<eos> Oh, I don't like that bed.<eos> Too many lumps.<eos> Maybe you should get a new bed.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I always did like this couch.
And that's what the Attorney General thinks happened.<eos> Now he's asking for our help.<eos> Fortunately, the same jurors are impaneled for another month.<eos> And, under the pretense of a murder investigation, I will face them and determine which ones were bribed.<eos> Or intimidated.<eos> I-I can't believe you got a prosecutor to take part in the con. It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting.<eos> The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
T-that should definitely be on the record.<eos> Mr. Jane, this is not a forum for you to chat with the jurors.<eos> Well, it should be.<eos> Mr. Jane.<eos> They just seem like good, honest, friendly people, all of them except that gentleman on the end there.<eos> You know, you really should mend things with your son.<eos> All this anger, this bitterness, this resentment that you're bottling, it's ruining both your lives.<eos> Stop now.<eos> You do not dictate the agenda here.<eos> Who does?
Oh. Please excuse me.<eos> No problem.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's your arms.<eos> They're so sparkly.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You noticed my glitter lotion? Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
I don't know anything about golf.<eos> Okay. Cool.<eos> What's this about?<eos> All security told me was some guys from the FBI wanted to talk.<eos> I got a massage in 15. Oh.<eos> Well, we found something that belongs to you.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Over at the Fishing Camp.<eos> You know it, don't you?<eos> Sure you do. No, man.
What evidence did he have?<eos> I want to know everything.<eos> There's Madeline.<eos> Think she beat us to it?<eos> Stay on task.<eos> We have two minutes to access the security door.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can't both lead.<eos> How did you know about Omaha?<eos> I didn't.
I have to say...<eos> I'm really quite upset.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You told me he'd be alone.<eos> You didn't say that a woman and a child would be in the car.<eos> What difference does that make?<eos> That woman died.<eos> I'm the one who has to live with this.<eos> No, Arturo.<eos> You don't.
What?<eos> ! Sure! We don't report the news, we make it.<eos> Accuracy is so time-consuming.<eos> Fiction is the new fact.<eos> Roger, these people need to know that Steve isn't missing, okay?<eos> I got to come clean on this.<eos> You know what else has to come clean?<eos> Garbage Island.<eos> Don't you still want to do your report?<eos> Of course I do!
Oh my...<eos> So we know what Omega was doing in here.<eos> What exactly were you doing in here?<eos> Skinner was giving me a tour.<eos> Oh, you had to kick off your heels?<eos> Well... it was in the line of duty.<eos> Oh, is that what you call it?<eos> Yeah, I had to save the world.<eos> Have you seen how high these things are?<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Shut up, Jerry!<eos> I went down there to entertain him.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You were just telling bad jokes.<eos> Not bad jokes... good jokes!<eos> - Bad jokes!<eos> - Bad audience!<eos> - People that don't know comedy!<eos> - I know comedy!<eos> He does, Jim. He really does.
Like what?<eos> Like I saw you do that thing with the pigeons, you slipped the gear on that squad car.<eos> I mean, like, you can do stuff.<eos> Yeah. I can do really little stuff when I want. But bigger stuff, I can't really tell when it's gonna happen.<eos> - Well, that sucks. - It's like hiccups. It starts and then it stops.<eos> And it's usually when I'm mad.<eos> Why do you want to know so bad?<eos> Well, 'cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don't have a place to stay, so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options.<eos> You want to do something wrong.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yes, you do.
I know.<eos> Is there any way that can be done without Will finding out?<eos> It's not our job to spare people's feelings, you know.<eos> It's not our job to ruin marriages either.<eos> Is there a way of asking that without...<eos> No, there's not, I'm gonna have to ask.<eos> Gives him a motive, doesn't it?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He might know.<eos> Guys normally do.
As an educated guess, I'd say it was...<eos> John Shearwood.<eos> -Do you know him?<eos> -Yes, if it was him.<eos> A big family man, I think.<eos> Ran his own business.<eos> Exports, I think.<eos> Certainly lorries in there somewhere.<eos> -Do you have an address?<eos> -Yes. I do.
John Shearwood.<eos> -Do you know him?<eos> -Yes, if it was him.<eos> A big family man, I think.<eos> Ran his own business.<eos> Exports, I think.<eos> Certainly lorries in there somewhere.<eos> -Do you have an address?<eos> -Yes. I do.<eos> I do.
Our body didn't have a wedding ring, did it?<eos> He's an older fella.<eos> Isn't always their thing, is it?<eos> Nice place, if you like sheep, isn't it?<eos> Some people like remote.<eos> I couldn't stand it.<eos> I'd end up... ..going mad.<eos> Do you not like your own company?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Got him.<eos> You stupid sod.<eos> You stupid sod!<eos> It's a bit late for that, Mark.<eos> Oh, he's going to be full of himself now, isn't he, that Owen?<eos> All yours.<eos> -Who grassed me up?<eos> -Who do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I genuinely don't.
A neighbour heard buzzing at nine.<eos> Yeah, but he didn't answer, did he?<eos> And his last text was sent at 7:50, which was his lie that he'd just arrived in Dublin.<eos> Yeah, well, what if he never sent it?<eos> What if the killer got his phone and sent it?<eos> -So who?<eos> -Someone responsible.<eos> Someone who knew Stella needed reassurance.<eos> And here's Billy thinking he's got nothing left to lose.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
Yeah, but he didn't answer, did he?<eos> And his last text was sent at 7:50, which was his lie that he'd just arrived in Dublin.<eos> Yeah, well, what if he never sent it?<eos> What if the killer got his phone and sent it?<eos> -So who?<eos> -Someone responsible.<eos> Someone who knew Stella needed reassurance.<eos> And here's Billy thinking he's got nothing left to lose.<eos> He does, doesn't he?<eos> He does.
We just wanted to check a detail.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure. What time did you leave for Berwick on Tuesday?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you checked into the hotel at 8:30pm.<eos> A couple of hours drive, max.<eos> So, yeah, maybe six-ish.<eos> So not really "most" of Tuesday, is it?<eos> Did I say that?<eos> Yeah, you did.
That girl back there, I knew her, so, if she's here, then so is my brother.<eos> Please, you have to help him, too.<eos> They'll kill him.<eos> You don't understand me, do you?<eos> Great.<eos> Why are you taking care of me?<eos> You found me at the bottom of that ravine.<eos> Fixed my knee.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Please don't do this.
We have much to celebrate. And know that you and your friends are welcome in our kingdom.<eos> If you need anything, we're at your service.<eos> Thank you, but all we need is horses.<eos> We have our own kingdom, our own castle.<eos> Our castle was destroyed in the curse.<eos> Well-played, Your Majesty.<eos> You laid waste to everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> Her castle still stands.<eos> Of course it does.
How do you... we... know that this is right?<eos> Emma, speaking for myself... I've known this was right since the moment you walked into my furniture shop.<eos> Why do you think your order was ready two weeks early?<eos> Your commitment to excellence?<eos> I couldn't wait to ask you out.<eos> It seemed the most non-stalkery way to speed things up.<eos> I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you. You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Isn't that obvious?<eos> Yes. What I meant was, who was it built for?<eos> My mother.<eos> Like you, I've lost people I care about...<eos> More than I'd like to admit.<eos> Including a child?<eos> What do you know about that?<eos> I saw the way you grabbed Roland back there.<eos> Clearly, you have the touch of a mother.<eos> I do.
Yes, how did you break the blood lock?<eos> I didn't.<eos> The door was open.<eos> No one's that powerful.<eos> Cora really never told you?<eos> Told me what?<eos> The truth about us, Regina.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How do you know my mother?<eos> The same way you do.
Hey, I'm talking to you.<eos> I came all this way via black smoke, I think I deserve an explanation.<eos> Well sweetheart, you got two choices.<eos> You can stay, I can pretend to court you, get bored with you and send you away.<eos> Two, you can get off at the next stop.<eos> Either way you'll forget everything.<eos> Here's option three.<eos> You tell me why you kidnapped me.<eos> I don't know why you are here.<eos> Seriously, I don't.
I'll tell you.<eos> Harvey was Michael Jordan.<eos> And now it's Lebron's time and he can't take it.<eos> That's a pretty big accusation to make.<eos> Well, there's more to the story than you know.<eos> Rachel, come on. I said I didn't want to get between you two.<eos> What?<eos> Let's just say that you kicking ass for him isn't the reason you got the day off.<eos> I thought you had law school today.<eos> I do right after this.
And you want to know how I feel about it.<eos> You're my partner.<eos> Well, I already told you how I feel about hiring him.<eos> This doesn't change that.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No, I don't.
I told you.<eos> I do my homework.<eos> You lost him, and you needed an outlet. And that's what this company is to you now.<eos> Your family.<eos> I told you, I'm not selling.<eos> And I told you, they're coming after you whether you like it or not.<eos> And the difference between me and them is they want to tear your company apart, and I want to keep it together.<eos> You don't have the resources to do that.<eos> Yes,<eos> I do.
It's Logan's show now.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> We need to move up our timeline.<eos> Well, I'm buying shares as fast as I can.<eos> I'm talking about a tender offer.<eos> The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game. But Walter Gillis knows we're coming and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
What for?<eos> The SEC is coming, and Jessica's hiring one person to fight 'em, and first thing tomorrow we need to convince her that person's me.<eos> Hey.<eos> I see you have the movies.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> I guess that means you've decided which relationship you want us to have.<eos> I have.<eos> But it's not what you might think.<eos> If you still want the job, it starts tomorrow.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> You've done it.<eos> - I did not like it.<eos> Did not like you?<eos> No, it's not for me.<eos> Look.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
I tried the dark side.<eos> Turns out you were right.<eos> Didn't suit me.<eos> This whole time, you've been standing up on that podium, playing the good soldier.<eos> My husband's a monster, David.<eos> He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> And he's powerful.<eos> And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
You feeling anything?<eos> Yo, why ain't this shit kicked in yet?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Does a body good.<eos> - Dr. Pryce?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Will you sign your book for me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Uh, how do you know my work?<eos> - I don't.
Incense.<eos> You smelt incense.<eos> Legassik!<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> You needn't fear.<eos> How could you?<eos> You knew what he was doing.<eos> Or you helped him!<eos> Of course I did.
Why are you so hung up on retracing your steps?<eos> I can't shake this feeling that something happened that night, like I...<eos> like I lost time.<eos> And it's the last night anyone saw Zoe.<eos> Okay, you got blackout drunk... it happens.<eos> And it's not like you were abducted by aliens.<eos> And someone did see Zoe later:<eos> Drake.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It is so cold! My fingers shrank, and now my ring won't stay on.<eos> Did you find out why the heat's not working? Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Fate of bluebell.<eos> Joel, hey, big news.<eos> Okay, so we are officially invited to the crab boil, and I know, I was thinking that maybe you could fake a seizure at dinner, because Aunt Winifred would be super impressed watching me save someone's life.<eos> Right. I'll keep thinking.<eos> (chuckles) Hey.<eos> - Don't say anything.<eos> - Okay. It's not that you're more likable.<eos> Just apparently Aunt Winifred is a New York-ist.<eos> You know, somewhere I have about eight billion retorts to that, but, um, right now I got my own Wilkes problem.<eos> That you do.
Sweet Home Alabama.<eos> Oh, you know who else loves Sweet Home Alabama?<eos> My ex, Donna, from Brooklyn.<eos> ZOE: Did you know that my pal Wade has a massive collection of video games?<eos> Cecil says video games turn people into demented sociopaths.<eos> I'm not sure that research backs Cecil up, but...<eos> (clears throat) Look at that Zoe Hart, just schmoozing with my little Harley.<eos> After how she ruined his birthday.<eos> - Hey, do you like root beer floats?<eos> - Cecil does.
Okay.<eos> I will be as fast as I can.<eos> Joel, you know what to order for me, right?<eos> If I don't, I will make something up.<eos> Joel, are you all right?<eos> You look clammy.<eos> No, no, I'm-I'm fine.<eos> Um... but you, however, you just look...<eos> Have I mentioned your teeth?<eos> Uh, you did, yeah.
I know.<eos> - I just... I can't believe that the warehouse almost moved.<eos> We've been here for five years, you know?<eos> It feels...feels like home.<eos> Try 40 years.<eos> - A little piece of advice.<eos> Take it one snag at a time.<eos> Something I've learned on this job Is you never know when things are gonna... Change.<eos> Artie, I thought we stopped it.<eos> - We did.
I'm reading a single humanoid lifeform.<eos> Vital signs are erratic.<eos> Life support systems are failing.<eos> Understood.<eos> Uhura, have the sickbay standing by.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> It may not be prudent to beam aboard an unknown lifeform, Captain.<eos> But you said vital signs are erratic.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I did.
I know what you're trying to do but...<eos> Seducing me is not the answer.<eos> No, Captain.<eos> That was wrong of me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Some habits... die hard.<eos> You're right about one thing, Lolani.<eos> Everyone has the right to be free.<eos> I wish it didn't matter what happened on that ship but...<eos> Unfortunately it does.
In most cities, entire power grids are down, making communication next to impossible.<eos> People are asking, "Where is the government?"<eos> The virus has no treatment, no vaccine.<eos> - So this whole weapons test--<eos> - It was all just a cover.<eos> And EMCON Alpha-- Keep us in the dark about what was going on at home.<eos> There's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France.<eos> If we operate at trail shaft, we should just make it.<eos> How do we know they have enough fuel to get us across the Atlantic?<eos> We don't.
Either way, the child would be royal born.<eos> Maybe your failure to kill Sean was not such a bad thing after all.<eos> It might behoove us to find out who the father is.<eos> Sooner rather than later.<eos> Steep it for 15 minutes before and after every meal for seven days.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks very much for your business.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't think you were coming in this early.<eos> Neither did I, but good news.
Nerd punch!<eos> Lesson three... your stick is to never touch the ice.<eos> It's used for slashing, hooking, butt-ending, and spearing.<eos> - Any questions?<eos> - Aren't all those penalties?<eos> - Nerd punch!<eos> - Aah. Lesson four... fighting.<eos> But I didn't learn lessons one through three yet.<eos> Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.<eos> - I didn't. - Or did you?
Look...<eos> I know you're gonna go off to college one day, but the reality of you moving all the way across the country and starting a whole new life, that freaked me out.<eos> But I know this isn't about me, so if Stanford is what you want, then, damn it, we are gonna get you into Stanford.<eos> - Do you mean that? - I don't.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - But I'll work on it.<eos> And maybe in a year or so... I will.<eos> You know, um... I never finished college, so I could always apply.<eos> Don't ruin the hug. Okay.<eos> Hey. How you doing?
It's very upsetting.<eos> While Erica was scheming against Barry, my mom's scheme to get me out of gym class was in motion.<eos> You have Osgood-"Shladder" disease?<eos> Actually, it's pronounced "Schlotter," and there's an article attached.<eos> My hamstrings and ligaments aren't keeping up with my bones.<eos> I'm growing too fast.<eos> You're growing too fast?<eos> Where? I-it's all in the note.<eos> You really expect me to believe your mother wrote this note?<eos> Yes, 'cause she actually did.
This is awkward.<eos> Did you bring me that check?<eos> - Oh, yeah. Here you go.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> Well, you know, Jackie, I'm happy to invest, but I think I have a lot to offer this company.<eos> I sort of always imagined myself a lone wolf in this foxhole, but...<eos> Scooch.<eos> Okay. Why don't you sell me on Kate?<eos> Well, I have a degree in marketing, uh, just as soon as I finish the last three credits.<eos> And most recently, I did the books and marketing over at the federal bar.
In the audience?<eos> People aren't gonna be able to see me there.<eos> I think that's okay.<eos> Friends, family, Lisa, Malik, welcome.<eos> Tonight we come together to witness the commitment of Lisa Shay and Malik Lefrique.<eos> Wait.<eos> Your last name's Lefrique?<eos> Okay. Hey.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
I think that's okay.<eos> Friends, family, Lisa, Malik, welcome.<eos> Tonight we come together to witness the commitment of Lisa Shay and Malik Lefrique.<eos> Wait.<eos> Your last name's Lefrique?<eos> Okay. Hey.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.<eos> Malik, do you take Lisa to be your wife?<eos> I do.
Oh, yeah, that confirms it.<eos> Chicago cops cannot make a good cup of coffee either.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks for helping us work this case.<eos> Of course.<eos> They're tough... especially when the victims are kids, but, you know, at least Vanessa's alive.<eos> It just doesn't make any sense.<eos> So you want the good guys to win.<eos> I want the bad guys to get what's coming to them.<eos> Well, sometimes they do.
Hey, this trip will involve pizza at some point, right?<eos> Yeah, you guys call the food stops.<eos> I'm choosing the music, 'cause the crap you kids listen to...<eos> I know. I can't stand most of it either.<eos> I mean, what's up with that?<eos> I can't even hear a band.<eos> It sounds like everything has been done on a laptop.<eos> Well, I like some old-school stuff.<eos> A little Bob Marley.<eos> Of course you do.
And then another part of me is hoping that he'll ask to get back together.<eos> But if he says neither of those things, then I'm just gonna feel mad and sad all over again.<eos> And then what if he's totally unclear about what he's saying?<eos> Then I'm just gonna reread the email over and over again a thousand times until I go crazy.<eos> - Sounds like a lose-lose.<eos> - Exactly! You know, you're the only person that I've told.<eos> I tried to tell Emmett, but then got totally sucker-punched when he told me about his new girlfriend...<eos> Mandy.<eos> - Why should that matter?<eos> - It doesn't.
... Not even kissed him?<eos> Not even kissed him.<eos> 'I do so hate it when Kester's right.' 'But sometimes, I love it in equal measure.'<eos> We couldn't find your...<eos> 'Oh, shit.'<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> - She's come to beg me not to fight her.<eos> Did she tell you where she keeps sneaking off with Liam?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
No, you need to rest.<eos> Rest your arm.<eos> Mica will help me.<eos> I spy trees and weeds.<eos> Your turn.<eos> You stay here.<eos> Tyreese.<eos> Sometimes we have to kill them.<eos> I know that.<eos> But sometimes we don't.
So that he could swoop in and be her savior?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can see your mother now.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> It's your first day.<eos> Thought you might like to see a friendly face.<eos> Thank you, but I think I've got it covered.<eos> And there's not a evil preacher teaching Spanish lab.<eos> Well, you never know.<eos> Actually, I do.
Hi, I'm Alice.<eos> I'm so happy you could join us.<eos> - I'm Jenny.<eos> - It's really nice to meet you.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> - Well, I think... I deserve a glass of wine after that, don't you?<eos> - You want white?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you. - Does everyone have a glass?<eos> - Yes, we do.
I'm mighty partial to a scissortail.<eos> [ Both laugh ] I hope I get to see one soon.<eos> I hope you can.<eos> My father was born on this land.<eos> Did you know my father?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Not that I can remember.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Well, I guess there are not very many around here that remember my father.<eos> I do, of course.
Maybe we should just take a beat.<eos> The longer we wait, the more time Jedikiah has to put reinforcements in.<eos> You didn't see what I saw inside Errol's head, John.<eos> People are being tortured as we speak.<eos> - It's aggressive. - It is a calculated risk.<eos> I'm not going to back away from what I think is right.<eos> And the people out there, they need this to happen.<eos> And so do the people down here.<eos> I need you to have my back.<eos> I do.
One of the groundskeepers saw her knock on your door.<eos> Can you tell me the nature of her visit?<eos> She came to tell me she was filing a lawsuit against Godfrey Industries.<eos> Was she upset?<eos> Since the death of her daughter and grandchild, she always seemed that way.<eos> - Who can blame her?<eos> - Did she say anything else?<eos> Where she might be going?<eos> Anyone else she was seeing later that day?<eos> No, she didn't.
Turn around, motherfucker!<eos> Turn around!<eos> Give me a chance.<eos> Walk off, then.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Fuck you, then.<eos> Hi. Uh, my name is Gomez Pugh with Root Cola.<eos> I was told that you might hangar a biplane that does promotional banners?<eos> Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, we're looking to do some non-conventional advertising.<eos> You do?
It's a free country... for most people.<eos> No offence.<eos> Wait a minute, you're famous, right?<eos> Did you play Buffy?<eos> Mm, almost. Sarah Michelle kneecapped me on the way to the audition.<eos> Stop talking to her, okay?<eos> Did you read what's in here?<eos> Depends, would you be mad if I did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then nope, I didn't.
Sometimes I throw a drink, it's my thing.<eos> Hey, is this seat taken? - Yes.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hot earrings.<eos> They look just like the ones Demi Lovato wore to the Billboard Awards.<eos> Yeah, but I wore 'em better.<eos> Uh... you know whose clothes I just love?<eos> Jennifer Lawrence's.<eos> Did you say Jennifer Lawrence?<eos> Sure did, yo.
I...<eos> I mean, I just...<eos> I know that I messed up before when I was too embarrassed to date you out in the open.<eos> - Lacey, stop, please.<eos> - But I blew off my bitchy friends and I did everything that I could to prove your innocence so you could come home.<eos> - Does none of that matter?<eos> - It does matter.<eos> I'm very grateful.<eos> So why don't you wanna be with me anymore?<eos> I do.
Hey!<eos> Hi, sorry.<eos> I'm Daniel. Excellent.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> Why are you involving my son?<eos> I'm Vikram's widow and my name's on the policy.<eos> Yes, yes, initially it was.<eos> But Mr. Desai made some changes.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> Uh, no, I didn't.
Yes, you did.<eos> Okay, close your eyes.<eos> All right.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> I was waiting on this until the baby, but...<eos> You were feeling a little... Guilty, yes.<eos> Because of what I said.<eos> Okay.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> You didn't.
You know, it's funny, I haven't really had any cravings. It's funny.<eos> Pickles.<eos> Oh, my God, you know what would go really well with pickles?<eos> John Form, we are meant to be together.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Like, mustard and pickles.<eos> Did you get to have your meeting today?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> He, thinks I've got a real shot at Huntington Memorial.<eos> Of course you do.
- No way.<eos> You'll get dumped on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move it.<eos> Aim for the pond and I have to catch you.<eos> Faster, before I kick your ass!<eos> You don't eat them?<eos> - I don't eat what?<eos> - The eggs. You shell them and don't eat them.<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, quite.<eos> There's an alliance that does not bode well.<eos> I quite agree with you.<eos> Aren't you being very snobbish?<eos> We're being realistic - something your generation has such trouble with.<eos> Her chauffeur says there's nothing wrong with the car that he could find, so there's a mystery.<eos> She's here to see you.<eos> I don't know what she wants.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Because I do.
So... your mom was auditioning killers? Ha!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, not killers, Ryan.<eos> People.<eos> She just wants to be loved like everybody else.<eos> She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.<eos> I mean, no one wants to be alone.<eos> So where can I find this guy?<eos> You already know him.<eos> Everybody does.
Deposit slip.<eos> I already signed it.<eos> Want a fresh one?<eos> Nah, I'm sure yours will turn out fine.<eos> Look, we hired you for your contacts, not your reputation.<eos> Hey, about that... boss never told me how you found out about that.<eos> None of your fucking business how we know.<eos> As long as you work for us, this is how it goes.<eos> We don't have a problem, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
"Those words have been a large part of what has motivated my life.<eos> "I've only written one other letter with these keys. "lt did not fail me then.<eos> "I hope it will not fail me now.<eos> "You said I wanted to diminish you.<eos> "The truth is, I don't.<eos> "You said I wanted to challenge you in 2016.<eos> "The truth is, I don't.<eos> "You said I wanted the presidency for myself.<eos> "The truth is,<eos> "I do.
Uh, go.<eos> Um, our... our group will be in touch with you really soon.<eos> Or not. [Clears throat]<eos> May not need us. It sounds like you're on the right track.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This girl is not what we signed up for. We're not doing this.<eos> Ross: I'm not trying to make you feel bad.<eos> - I'm just saying...<eos> - Good, 'cause I don't.
If you thought whatever happened the other night between us meant that we were getting back together, I'm sorry, but that's not what's gonna happen.<eos> You know that wasn't you the other night in that photo!<eos> What? If it wasn't her, then who was it?<eos> It was that chick, Claire.<eos> I got paid 25 grand to show up and suck face with her for a couple minutes.<eos> You're telling me that you really don't know?<eos> No!<eos> I was messed up that night. I don't remember anything.<eos> I don't even remember getting messed up.<eos> Maybe you didn't.
Zach.<eos> Once we realized Mandy hadn't really cheated on him, I tracked him down.<eos> I thought he needed to know. Good.<eos> I hope it works out for them.<eos> Mandy needs something good in her life.<eos> They've got a shot.<eos> They seem to really love each other. For all the right reasons.<eos> Oh, um... Speaking of boyfriends, Pi's letter of recommendation.<eos> He did get the deadline extended, right?<eos> - No, he did.
They'll get sick and then blood-crazy.<eos> We need to find Klaus.<eos> His blood can heal you.<eos> Marcel!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where's Hayley?<eos> He doesn't have her.<eos> Please. I know you don't trust him, but you know I wouldn't lie.<eos> He doesn't have her.<eos> Someone does.
- Even my own daughter isn't a match.<eos> -What?<eos> Anything else you wanna throw at me?<eos> How about a flesh-eating virus, huh?<eos> Wanna toss that in?<eos> What did you say?<eos> - What?<eos> -Your... daughter?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> -Yes, you did.
I wish. Abbi really doesn't like it when I have friends over.<eos> I'll come to your place?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'll make my special rotisserie chicken.<eos> 21 seasonings salute.<eos> Dude. How are you still single?<eos> It's just hard to meet girls in this city.<eos> Dude, you gotta know someone you can set me up with.<eos> You know what?<eos> No, I don't.
Building collapse in Norway.<eos> 18 dead, 47 trapped.<eos> [ Tablet dings ] Toxic water leak at Japanese power plant.<eos> Government blames dead worker.<eos> That's not good.<eos> Okay, seriously, Brick?<eos> Now you're taking on the whole world's problems?<eos> Can't we just sit and enjoy our dinner?<eos> Sure, if you want to live in denial.<eos> We do.
- Ok.<eos> - It really does!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Asshole.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew you were a professional.<eos> - Professional?<eos> - Scarf, coat.<eos> But you do not have the gun.<eos> Actually, I do.
Not you, too.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Look, I didn't have a choice.<eos> I can't go to the awards gala with her.<eos> I feel bad, okay?<eos> It just... seemed like you... didn't really want to go.<eos> I didn't.<eos> McGee!<eos> I thought you really liked her!<eos> I did.
Ugh.<eos> Look, I didn't have a choice.<eos> I can't go to the awards gala with her.<eos> I feel bad, okay?<eos> It just... seemed like you... didn't really want to go.<eos> I didn't.<eos> McGee!<eos> I thought you really liked her!<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
I'm not moving back to starling, Quentin.<eos> Well, Sara's back.<eos> I have a new life in Central City, and, um, I have a wonderful job.<eos> Well, there's jobs here.<eos> More than a job. Um...<eos> I have... Someone.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You know, it's great, Mom.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> - Everybody does. - Yeah.
Thea, please, come with me.<eos> I don't want anything to do with you.<eos> I don't want to even see you!<eos> Stay behind me.<eos> You're out of arrows.<eos> You're not!<eos> Oliver...<eos> This is your phone.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing you do, Oliver.
Go ahead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Look, there's something I need to tell you, and I should have told you a long time ago.<eos> So how much of that sermon you gave in the forest was true?<eos> All that stuff about living with regret, looking at yourself in the mirror, blah, blah, blah.<eos> So you heard that?<eos> The whole thing.<eos> Then I guess that means you heard me say me and you ain't there yet.<eos> Hey. Hey, boys. How you doing, boys?
What part would you have changed?<eos> Would you have left the old guy at the altar?<eos> Never said yes when he proposed?<eos> Never even gone after the crown jewels?<eos> Never come to Wonderland.<eos> We should have stayed in Sherwood.<eos> I wish we'd never set eyes on that damn looking glass.<eos> Getting involved with magic... that was the start of all our trouble.<eos> Anastasia and Will... we already had all the magic we needed, right?<eos> That, they did.
I don't need to get inside your head to know what you're afraid of.<eos> You wear it on that tortured face of yours.<eos> You're afraid I won't live up to my end of the bargain and you'll be my slave for as long as we both shall live.<eos> The thought had crossed my mind.<eos> Now, let's see if there's a way for you to keep my fears from coming true, and then maybe... just maybe... I'll consider doing the same for yours.<eos> Careful.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to steal that.<eos> Let go of my hand, mate.<eos> You know Alice trusts you.<eos> You don't.
But I know what does.<eos> Take one more step, and I'll take your head clean off your shoulders.<eos> Come now, Cyrus.<eos> Is that any way to talk to a lady?<eos> What would your mother think?<eos> You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> Don't let her get in your head. She's poison, this one.<eos> If Jafar knows we're here, why would he send you?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> And he didn't.
Would you like some food?<eos> - We have plenty to share.<eos> Priscilla?<eos> - Peter.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> It's good to see you again, pal.<eos> This makes sense.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How did you know where to find me?<eos> We didn't.
Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?<eos> Yes. So you think I'll be on TV and in movies and win awards.<eos> Honestly?<eos> Yes, honestly.<eos> I don't.<eos> How could you say that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I got all confused when you said "honestly".<eos> Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.
Delivering from the bitter pains of eternal death, the woman was a wicked woman, and she was dead in her own life.<eos> Yea, Lord, pity them who are dead, and give peace and happiness to the living.<eos> Hey, Fruit Brute!<eos> Fruit brute!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no.

Not me. It's Theresa.<eos> Penelope Cruz is her lesbian free ticket. It's the one girl she'd ever have sex with If she ever had the chance.<eos> Me, being a gracious boyfriend, said she could do it.<eos> - Who's your free ticket?<eos> - Jennifer Aniston.<eos> - Oh, you moron.<eos> - What? Why am I a moron?<eos> Because if you pick Penelope Cruz too, And the day happens to come where you both meet her And you hit it off, you get to have a threesome!<eos> - Even I know that.<eos> - Oh, I didn't...
I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last forever and ever."<eos> That's Bull Durham, horseface.<eos> Quiet.<eos> - Do you, Jimmy Farrell...<eos> - I do.<eos> - And do you, Theresa Kelly, take this man, Tommy, to be your lawfully wedded husband, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?<eos> Yes, Johnny, I do.<eos> If there is anyone amongst you who knows of any reason why Theresa and Donny should not be joined together...<eos> Speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Oh, I do.
Okay, it will be, except<eos> I will be imposing the strictest condom policies.<eos> From now on, you will be sending me a picture of every dick that you are about to... host wearing a condom.<eos> Deal?<eos> No deal.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you know who's at the top of my mom's gross sex list?<eos> Howie Mandel.<eos> Wait, your mom has a gross sex list?<eos> Yeah, my whole family does.
I am-I have some more if anyone wants.<eos> Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before.<eos> It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.

Do not laugh!<eos> "Your child is an indigo".<eos> "What?" I asked.<eos> And she said, "Yes,<eos> I felt his energy, I can see it.<eos> You are carrying a child indigo ...<eos> Well, if the seer said ...<eos> It's good.<eos> Yes, being the father of Jesus Christ is not so bad!<eos> Do not do that.
I ain't giving up on my dream!<eos> Danny! What the hell happened?<eos> What's it matter?<eos> Guys around here think buying a drink buys them a license to talk shit.<eos> Now, which one's his?<eos> It's that one there, I believe.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This whole place is ass-backwards, Dewey.<eos> You know that?<eos> How you doing, sweetheart?
You ever just explode?<eos> No, I can't say I ever have.<eos> - Give me a break, dude.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> I mean, there were times I had to prove a point, but I always helped the guy off the ground. I don't get triggered like that.<eos> It's just not in my DNA to, like, go off.<eos> Senator, a moment ago...<eos> Let's just switch gears...<eos> You said that your behavior toward that soldier in Afghanistan was unforgivable.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Some closure.<eos> - I think they're gonna be okay.<eos> I'll take you to the playground where you used to play.<eos> You do know that the C.I.A. will just get McKinley... - and his bodyguard out of jail, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But they won't be able to cover everything up, since I leaked some vital information to Internet bloggers, and the New York Times picked it up.<eos> - Sneaky you.<eos> - That's how I roll. - I like that.<eos> - But by the way, how did you know that that guy was wearing a bulletproof vest?<eos> I didn't.
Let's go!<eos> We have to call it off and plan a new one.<eos> The type-one, uh, error rates are through the roof.<eos> If Megan stands him up, we can't do this operation again, and Blinken might run from any plan we try.<eos> If Clark says we call it off, w-w-we call it off.<eos> Do it!<eos> Thunderbird Three, back to base camp.<eos> It's over.<eos> OK. Now... Now how do we plan whatever it was that you were just saying?<eos> - I don't...
Honey, did you pack a button-down shirt?<eos> Eh, it's vacation.<eos> I think you're gonna regret that.<eos> Honey?<eos> Have you seen my black boots?<eos> _<eos> Uh, have you, uh,<eos> - checked the hall closet?<eos> - _<eos> I did.
Clayton, please.<eos> For me?<eos> _<eos> ... everything since '82.<eos> I need them brought to me, because I need to know...<eos> That would be great. Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
It doesn't matter.<eos> You remember what yours felt like.<eos> If mine feels the same, I know I got nothing to worry about.<eos> I'm not qualified... and you're definitely not Jewish.<eos> You're a grocer whose hands are trained to handle ripe fruit.<eos> Come on, Barney. I'm desperate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... let me find some plastic gloves.<eos> You used gloves when you felt yours?<eos> No, I did not.
In 18 months, my people will take over.<eos> Everything you own...<eos> Will be mine.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Seon-u.<eos> How'd you get that name?<eos> _<eos> Look, I don't know what happened between you and your dad, but I trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
Are you okay?<eos> I... what happened?<eos> What did it do to us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I-I feel fine.<eos> So do I.<eos> Ingrid.<eos> What?<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Of course it does.
So if you kill one... Exactly.<eos> The other one dies, too.<eos> So maybe we should try to find its mate.<eos> Kill them, and just let the Mandragora die.<eos> No.<eos> We don't kill innocents.<eos> The mate's not innocent. They're collateral damage.<eos> We'd be saving lives, and it could take weeks, tracking them down. We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Look, just... tell me where you saw the Mandragora.<eos> I didn't.
It's like what happened with you and Killian.<eos> A transfer of energy.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> There's a lot we can do, Dash.<eos> We have incredible power. But when it comes to life and death, there's always a price.<eos> When I first found out I was a witch, I brought my aunt Wendy back from the dead.<eos> It was impulsive.<eos> And I did it for all the right reasons just like you.<eos> But what I didn't know was that by doing it, someone I loved had to die.<eos> And they did.
- Death scorpions. - What's a death scorpion?<eos> They're in stasis now, but I can revive them.<eos> And he won't see them coming, because he doesn't know what they are, because we're the ones who invented the spell.<eos> The first sting will paralyse you and the second will kill you.<eos> Even if you're a telepathic, warlock, asshole.<eos> I don't want to kill him yet.<eos> The venom will paralyze him for a couple of hours.<eos> It's enough time for us to find out his plans.<eos> Only problem is, we don't know how to find Tarkoff.<eos> Or maybe we do.
It's okay, my boy.<eos> - Tarkoff...<eos> - Tortured you.<eos> He overstepped the bounds.<eos> I shall deal with him.<eos> I know the carnage it took to bring me here weighs heavily upon you.<eos> You were always... a gentle child.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Grandfather.<eos> Of course you do.
You're here.<eos> - I'm sorry I ran out the other day.<eos> - I'm sorry that I...<eos> - I really am.<eos> - You're freaked.<eos> It's standard.<eos> I'm... a little... overwhelmed.<eos> - God, you must hate me.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no. I don't.
It's open, hurry!<eos> Go, Wendy.<eos> Go!<eos> Fraendo!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Get inside!<eos> Tunc evanescunt ostium!<eos> I'm not bleeding anymore.<eos> Told you I knew we'd make it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Kyle and his mom, were they tight?<eos> Sir, all incoming cadets take photos with mothers.<eos> It's an academy tradition, sir.<eos> Just chill with the "yes, sir," "no, sir" bullshit, all right? - I ain't your pops.<eos> - Sir, yes, sir.<eos> Did you know Kyle well?<eos> No, ma'am, I can't say I did.<eos> Do you like being here?<eos> The Academy's taught me how to be disciplined, courageous, serve the greater good, to be a man.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.
And tomorrow, I'm turning myself in, and this will all be over. No.<eos> Victoria.<eos> I'm surprised to see you.<eos> Coming here in the middle of this media firestorm may not be the smartest thing to do, but... I need an ally.<eos> And I couldn't help but notice that you've yet to take a public stance on my guilt.<eos> I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it.<eos> Jack told you what Conrad did to his family?<eos> Yes.<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I didn't.
Is there something you're not sharing?<eos> These are copies of photos taken moments after Emily was shot.<eos> Each guest claims to have been in the main room.<eos> Lydia.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Which means she lied to the police.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> It was a like a real-live fairy tale.<eos> You've gotta remember something.<eos> I don't.
Now, dig deep.<eos> Can you think of anyone, anyone at all who hates Barney Stinson?<eos> I know, I know, I almost couldn't get through it with a straight face!<eos> There are just so many people who hate Barney's guts!<eos> Moving on.<eos> The point is, you need to go get slapped in the face by a bunch of gullible chicks Barney banged.<eos> I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Ooh!<eos> I'm a friend of Barney Stins... I-I'm-I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Aah!<eos> I'm so sorry. I thought you said you were a friend of Barney Stinson.<eos> I did. Ooh!
You're going to need more than big socks this morning.<eos> I know this has been sort of confusing, Kira.<eos> I don't blame you for being put out.<eos> But, since we're stuck in this together, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun.<eos> And there's no reason why we shouldn't have really awesome socks.<eos> Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
What?<eos> Callie doesn't want us to be there.<eos> Too bad.<eos> You have to talk to the judge, right?<eos> So that way she can come home.<eos> Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
Well, that's cool.<eos> Nervous?<eos> Harness that energy and focus.<eos> Focus is key.<eos> I really like you, but I love Lexi.<eos> But I really think we need to break up.<eos> If you're interested in using me as sperm donor, I'm in.<eos> If you wanna use Timothy, I think we should get together, all three of us, talk about it.<eos> The lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> - Oh, we don't.
I won't be humiliated, Zachary.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm sorry. Just this whole Winter Queen thing is making me feel really uncomfortable.<eos> Honestly, I am so tired of being judged.<eos> I'm tired, too.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of being here whenever you need my shoulder to cry on.<eos> What about when I need you?<eos> What about when I needed to talk to you the other day and you just blew me off?<eos> I didn't, I...
- Yeah. We're ok.<eos> - Good.<eos> So, listen, the adoption lawyer has found your father.<eos> Where?<eos> Not far from here, actually.<eos> North Park.<eos> Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.
I guess he owns, like, this big company or something.<eos> So he is making me take this DNA test and... and sign this agreement that says that I'll never sue him.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - Like I want his money?<eos> Just sign the papers, and then sail off on your yacht and I promise I will never think of you ever again.<eos> - And I have to see him.<eos> 'Cause we both have to be there at the test, to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever.<eos> I know you didn't want to know anything about him.<eos> Guess I don't have a choice.<eos> Some people do.
I know what you're doing.<eos> Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?<eos> Listening to a little live music?<eos> Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't...<eos> Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?<eos> - Great show.<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> It was amazing, really.<eos> But we have to go.<eos> We do?
- Not in front of me.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> I appreciate you looking out for him, being such a good friend.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> My dad thinks Jude is gay.<eos> That's why I can't spend the night at your house anymore.<eos> I see.<eos> - Did he say that to Jude?<eos> - No. But I did.
Let's do this.<eos> Hey!<eos> So how'd your interview go? Oh!<eos> There was a tricky moment or two, but I kinda think I killed it.<eos> Nice!<eos> You're totally gonna get it.<eos> What about you?<eos> How was your dance auditions?<eos> Did you guys find your girl? Oh, yeah.<eos> We did.
He's into her in more ways than one, you know what I mean?<eos> - Devonee's gay?<eos> - Gay for the stay, more like it.<eos> - What?<eos> - It happens all the time. Lots of straight girls get a little while they're here.<eos> But I guess since Cole identifies as a boy, that means Devonee's...<eos> - Don't ask me.<eos> - Does Rita know?<eos> There's lots of underground stuff going on right now that Rita doesn't know about, or at least she pretends she don't.<eos> - Um, how many chairs did Rita?
Becka told me.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'm getting out soon and I got no place to go.<eos> - Not like you.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> I can't find one family that wants me. You got two.<eos> The Quinns?<eos> They don't want me to live with them.<eos> And even if they did, I...
Yeah, I get it, Sherlock.<eos> Lock up the scene, photograph and bag the evidence.<eos> Routine procedure.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Case number 45344.<eos> Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like. It did.
You can't go.<eos> You're, like, the only person in the whole world who actually cares about me.<eos> I feel the same way about you, but I have to go.<eos> I have to.<eos> Why, though?<eos> Um... there's a guy.<eos> What guy?<eos> There's a guy I owed a favor to, and he wanted me to do something for him.<eos> I tried to get it done.<eos> I really did.
Sheriff, you think that we fan out like we did last night, continue canvassing?<eos> Dumb girl who brought this here, and she's gonna save us?<eos> - Fucking mess.<eos> - Fucking danger hole.<eos> No way out of this one.<eos> How many there gotta be in this state?<eos> We don't have the time to figure it out.<eos> - There's gotta be a lot of them.<eos> - The truth is I don't know how to narrow the search.<eos> I do.

You looked like you were having so much fun.<eos> Well, I was in good company, you know? Just playing with friends that get me and my music. And...<eos> Don't much like being hung up on. I know.<eos> I told you... I'm fine.<eos> Well, you can cut that out right now.<eos> This is too damn big to just shove down and deal with later, Rayna. Talk to me.<eos> - Tea?<eos> - No, I don't want tea. I want you to talk, all right?<eos> If anybody understands how complicated your relationship with Lamar was, it's me.<eos> - You don't.
Or 5 or 10 or...<eos> Why didn't you just give me a little more time to be her daddy?<eos> You were always a part of her life, you know?<eos> - I mean, I made sure of that.<eos> - Oh, no, Ray... no.<eos> You got to watch her grow up.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> You know that's not the same, Rayna.<eos> You ever sing her to sleep? Mm-hmm.<eos> I never did.
Carlos is a selfish idiot who doesn't know what the hell he's doing.<eos> What ever happened to people helping other people?<eos> Holly, I hate to tell you this.<eos> You're good at your job.<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> Thank you for that, and for saving me from that maniac.<eos> He was just trying to kill Owen.<eos> Where is Owen?<eos> How did he disappear?<eos> He didn't.
Livvy...<eos> He's quite moved on.<eos> Of course I mind.<eos> If Grandmother's done anything to hurt them I will never forgive her.<eos> George.<eos> What's happened?<eos> Right.<eos> I apologise for leaving you in the lurch.<eos> Well, you've got to go.<eos> Of course you do.
Mail from a certain lieutenant of the 21st?<eos> I haven't heard from Harry since before we sailed.<eos> I was hoping he'd be in France, but...<eos> Well, if the way he spoke of you to me is anything to go by, he's raring to get here.<eos> Ladies.<eos> ♪ Land of the myrtle and... ♪<eos> Dooley?<eos> Sister Haynes!<eos> You remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
What does it matter?<eos> You've a choice to make, Ben.<eos> You don't know how important this is.<eos> I wish you could understand what this means.<eos> Tell me what it means.<eos> They wouldn't be after us if this wasn't real.<eos> This is my chance to tell a story that really matters.<eos> I love you, Ben.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course, I do.
I hesitated.<eos> That's why the first bullet missed.<eos> I've never made the same mistake again.<eos> At the time, you claimed it was self-defense.<eos> It was. Truth is... you were defending someone else... your mother.<eos> What is your point, sir?<eos> That protection was always in your blood.<eos> Makes me wonder... how far would you go to protect Gabriel?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Yes, you do.
People need to be able to take it anywhere.<eos> It's going to have a handle.<eos> A handle?<eos> Oh, my God, Joe. I gotta give it to you.<eos> This changes everything.<eos> A handle.<eos> What a revolutionary idea.<eos> So it's still a piece of shit copy of a boring box?<eos> Joe, she gave the binder to IBM.<eos> You did what?

Gimme another beer.<eos> We heard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I know that wasn't easy, so... wanna go get drunk?<eos> Yeah, I need to be with some family.<eos> Come on, brother.<eos> Hey! Look who made it.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey!<eos> How you doing, ugly?
I know. I never even liked him when I was dating him, and then he cheated on me with that chick he met at the car show.<eos> - But just listen...<eos> - Please tell me you're not<eos> - getting back together. - No! No.<eos> See, this is the genius part.<eos> He thought I wanted to get back together, but I just wanted to take the power back. So I used him this time.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Because, let's be honest, there's no sex like ex sex.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Well, I didn't before this.
Oh. We were in a fight and it just came out.<eos> You know, I thought I had everything under control, and now I just feel like I can't do anything right.<eos> We're barely into this new chapter of your life.<eos> It's bound to be a bit confusing.<eos> - How about debilitating?<eos> - Of course it is, but there is no one more capable of rising to the occasion than you.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I really hope you're right, because right now it...<eos> Doesn't feel like it.<eos> Hey. Good morning, kiddo. How you doing this morning?
You know what? I would accept that if you were some stranger, but you're family.<eos> Yeah, well, I realize that, Sara.<eos> Which is why I've been looking out for April, trying to make her feel safe. It's all I've been able to think about.<eos> So don't talk to me about family loyalty, okay?<eos> Especially since you're the one who's held a grudge against me for years.<eos> You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
I don't know what that means.<eos> All I know is I can't deal with you hating me.<eos> Brenna.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> Look. It's just hard when you're into girls and you have no idea if they're into girls.<eos> But you hurt my feelings because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I felt like we had a thing.<eos> I did too.<eos> "Did."
Maybe you'll get an idea when you're down there.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ring ring. "Hey, Dominic, it's April.<eos> What's up?<eos> I have cancer."<eos> He'll be back in Boston in five hours, done and done.<eos> - I can't do that to him, Beth.<eos> - Can't you though?<eos> All you do is talk about how much you miss him.<eos> I do, but...
- I'm Martine.<eos> - I'm Sara.<eos> Martine's my favorite nurse.<eos> Ah, you say that to all the nurses.<eos> I definitely do not say that to Lailani.<eos> Just checking in before you go to sleep.<eos> Oh, and don't panic if you hear an alarm in the middle of the night.<eos> We have your bed set to alert us if you get up.<eos> Every time I get up?<eos> Yes, and sometimes when you don't.
I don't- - I don't know.<eos> What are we?<eos> Are we this?<eos> - This?<eos> - This.<eos> This Mr. "Steak Very Rare," Mrs. "Wouldn't This Wallpaper Look Good In Our Den?"<eos> I just had you up against the wall in our bathroom.<eos> That doesn't exactly qualify us for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post, does it?<eos> Did you like that?<eos> I did.
I'm sorry, that... That had too many "yous" in it.<eos> Hey. It's... It's okay.<eos> You're enough.<eos> That's what I'm trying to say.<eos> It's not like you don't frustrate the hell out of me, 'cause half the time, I want to wring your neck.<eos> But as long as I'm yours and you're mine... That's enough for me.<eos> Uh, dinner is in 15 minutes.<eos> You were saying something about Hendricks?<eos> About his, uh, not wanting Negroes in the study?<eos> Hendricks doesn't.
In fact, he's drunk, embarrassingly so.<eos> Well, do consider it.<eos> I see you've found the last place of refuge.<eos> Oh, I quit smoking during my fertility treatments. Oh...<eos> But you go ahead.<eos> It may be the only fun of the night.<eos> Bill certainly has had a lot lo drink tonight.<eos> I think Bill may have lost his mind.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, too.
No, because in order to apply, you need to have a board of trustees, like I told you two months ago.<eos> I'm working on that.<eos> Libby and I are having dinner tonight with Sam Duncan.<eos> I'm assuming that if I can convince the Chief of Police to join our board, others will follow.<eos> You're going to convince him?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Virginia? - Yes?<eos> You got any plans tonight?<eos> Not at the moment.<eos> Well, you do now.
And how can they say there was a fight when there were people there the whole time and no one saw nothing like that?<eos> I was surprised to read that, too.<eos> I had just come out of the building, and, um, hadn't noticed any sort of altercation.<eos> Look, we got a couple of witnesses who, uh, saw a truck drive by and saw Leonard get dumped out the back, and one of them saw the first three numbers of the licence plate.<eos> And, so, I was wondering if... If maybe you saw anything.<eos> If there are other witnesses, why are you talking to me?<eos> Because most of them are coloured folks.<eos> The few white witnesses won't talk, and the police aren't about to start an investigation based on the testimony of a bunch of negroes.<eos> So if you did see something...<eos> I didn't.
Uh, when I was very young, yes.<eos> Without difficulty?<eos> Dr. Masters means physical difficulty.<eos> We understand that there was a difficult emotional component.<eos> Uh, when-- when he first put it inside me, it-- it hurt, and there was a little blood.<eos> And after the first time?<eos> Uh, the-- the pain was lessened.<eos> But then once I realized that the circumstances were inappropriate--<eos> Does he know who I was with?<eos> He does.
And yet my... difficulties persist, so... so how can that be the cause?<eos> The psychology behind these physical problems is very complicated, and to understand the "why" of it...<eos> Oh, we can spend forever on the "why" and not get any closer to finding any kind of cure.<eos> You know, the point, Virginia, is, we... we have an opportunity here, you know, to find a cure not... not just for me, but for millions of men.<eos> We've drifted away from the work. I...<eos> I admit that.<eos> But... but this is the way back.<eos> I'm broken, and you're the one... you... you're the only one who can fix me.<eos> So, you consider the relationship to have a higher purpose now?<eos> I do.
You okay to continue?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Hey-hey, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> You're safe in here, Kira.<eos> This truck is made of titanium. They can't track you in here.<eos> I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
Thank you, Daddy.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> More than anything.<eos> Dr. Sanders told me what happened with you and Kate Renner.<eos> Kate Renner?<eos> How could she know about...<eos> It was decades ago. Burton Delaney.<eos> - Mary, you couldn't possibly believe...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
- Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dude, there you are!<eos> Slow down!<eos> Where you going?<eos> What?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I'm done for the day.<eos> - You saved somebody's life man.<eos> No, no, that doctor did.
I won't let you down.<eos> Good.<eos> Ms. Sheridan.<eos> James St. Patrick.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're James St. Patrick.<eos> You know, I tried to run a background check on you, and no one in the nightlife world seems to know who you are.<eos> I was expecting a fat Irish guy.<eos> Well, I hope I can meet your other expectations.<eos> I do, too.
Here we go.<eos> Come on, man<eos> Here we go. Open up.<eos> So, why'd you shoot the guy?<eos> He's up on a fire escape.<eos> Where's he gonna go?<eos> Why do you care all of a sudden? I'm riding with you.<eos> I got a right to know.<eos> Okay, why don't you tell me about how you shot a guy?<eos> Which you did, right?
Don't worry about me.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Way to go, hero.<eos> You should've asked them to look at it.<eos> No, I'll be fine.<eos> I gotta get back on shift.<eos> I'll drop you off at Nicole's.<eos> She'll take you till Mom's off.<eos> Nah, I have to go to school.<eos> No, you don't.
Christ!<eos> A fresh cup of coffee!<eos> Let's see what she's got.<eos> Here we are!<eos> OK, where's the body?<eos> It's not far, it's not far.<eos> Shit!<eos> That's Johnny Appleseed!<eos> You know him?<eos> Everyone does.
Great.<eos> That stupid margarita machine maxed me out.<eos> So now the CEO of Pied Piper can't even afford to buy lunch.<eos> Yeah, I don't think we can use that name anymore.<eos> Dude!<eos> Dude, hey.<eos> I owe you a big apology, man.<eos> I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online, and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!<eos> "I met this dude! He came into the store "and told me my parking app was fucking awesome!"<eos> I did?
I'm hoping you'll tell me.<eos> Catherine?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is everything OK?<eos> I wanna be here with you.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I wanna make it right.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Do you want me here?<eos> Of course, I do.
Do you know he meditates for 20 minutes every day.<eos> That's stupid.<eos> Wonder why he never told me that.<eos> Yeah, I can't imagine why he doesn't tell you stuff.<eos> He tells me stuff.<eos> I'll bet you didn't know he still has a baby tooth.<eos> Ooh, is it the one that's cold-sensitive?<eos> I know, and he can only drink from his left side.<eos> (laughs) Well, I'll bet you didn't know he was an amateur magician.<eos> I didn't.
How do you feel?<eos> I came here to fight with her and then you told me that she was dead and...<eos> I was so angry I didn't wanna let it in, this... this terrible thing that happened.<eos> Caleb, I liked her and I wanted to help her and now she's dead.<eos> And you were... you were in the car.<eos> You could have...<eos> Come here.<eos> [Remy] What about the current mayor?<eos> [Olivia] He doesn't use this office.<eos> [Luke] Nobody does.
This one just says, "I'm beautiful," and that's not gonna scare Andrew.<eos> Lauren, which dolls did you send back?<eos> Um, three of them, like you asked.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - No. And now, I give you the new, improved.<eos> Sweet Randi Jenkins. You're beautiful on the inside.<eos> Not that one.<eos> I'm so glad we're friend again.<eos> Oh, no, not that poor, unstable girl. Excuse me, excuse me, coming through.<eos> Hey, everybody! How we doing here today?
At least back then.<eos> But you regret it now.<eos> I regret a lot of things.<eos> I mean, trusting him.<eos> Vikram. I don't know.<eos> I... I just wish I knew more.<eos> I know where he kept the adoption papers.<eos> He told me he was hanging on to them in case you ever...<eos> Do you want to find your child?<eos> Of course I do.
Gotta watch my step.<eos> So we're dating now?<eos> I mean... if one date counts as dating.<eos> I think it's two dates minimum.<eos> Okay.<eos> Friday night.<eos> You're on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> So he did it out-of-state.
Um... oh, God!<eos> You think I want...<eos> Yeah, sex.<eos> The romantic night out, the movie, the food trucks.<eos> Food trucks means sex?<eos> No, but coming back to your place, it just feels so...<eos> I really like you, Rico, but I'm just not ready.<eos> Yeah, o... okay.<eos> It's okay. I mean, I don't want to have sex with you.<eos> You don't?
There's a possible reference to Thanatos, the Hellenic demon of death.<eos> No.<eos> Can you rewind it?<eos> Rewind it.<eos> Maybe we need to listen to it in reverse.<eos> Demons have been known to speak backwards.<eos> Just to up the creep factor.<eos> Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.
Put that on.<eos> Put it on.<eos> My mother wanted me to be a doctor, Ray.<eos> Yeah, I bet she'd be real proud of you right now.<eos> Go.<eos> Come on.<eos> How are you feeling, Mr. Clarke?<eos> It says here you have appendicitis. Is that correct?<eos> Do you mind if I check, please?<eos> They did that already.
- Hi!<eos> I'd like to speak to a manager, please.<eos> What seems to be the problem here?<eos> WOMAN: Well, one hour ago, I got a call from Detective Sue Sylvester with the LAPD saying that a 50-year-old Ohio man with a perm had abducted 12 emotionally disturbed teenagers, and if he tried to make a reservation,<eos> I was to contact the FBI.<eos> Oh, my God, that's them.<eos> Who?<eos> Do you seriously have no idea who that is?<eos> Do none of you read the show choir blogs?<eos> No, Blaine, we don't.
Last night, the Metas brought Colima to Peacock Hill.<eos> I don't think this kind of savagery is quite what you intended.<eos> Are you familiar with the phrase<eos> "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"?<eos> We will never be friends, Chapel.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> Because as a friend, I would tell you that... Los Angelicos does not have the manpower or the firepower to take on the Metas.<eos> But I do.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> SAM: But your community does.
God damn. You was in on this the whole time.<eos> Well, it turns out some people still give a shit about what kind of person they do business with.<eos> Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Because we wanted to make sure we had your money, and like the man said, no bodies drop in Mexico.<eos> Now, the rest of you are welcome to go back to our original agreement.<eos> You get this product back in the US. You go back to working for Hot Rod.<eos> How does that sound right about now?<eos> I think we're good with that.<eos> I'm guessing that don't apply to me.<eos> No, cousin, it does not.
Okay, that should be the seed value-- the -- the key code for the blur.<eos> Now you should be able to use the code to try -- It's working.<eos> Weatherly.<eos> All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it.<eos> No one saw it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
You know, I remember the night that you slept over at my place.<eos> And my mom and dad, they came in to say good night, and they gave me a hug and a kiss.<eos> You know, I didn't think anything of it.<eos> But you asked if something special was happening.<eos> You said you couldn't remember if your parents ever did that.<eos> And of course, you made fun of me, because you were supposed to be strong. But I saw how much you wished it was you.<eos> And that's probably why we never hung out after that, 'cause you were embarrassed that I saw that.<eos> And you think I'm the same. You think that I killed Lana. I get it.<eos> You didn't have to drive all the way out here to tell me that.<eos> But I don't, Trent.
Depends what it is.<eos> This morning I found a used syringe on your bathroom floor.<eos> I know it's none of my business and we just met, but...<eos> Uh, okay, it's not drugs.<eos> I have a medical condition that comes and goes and it's a very long story.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have even bothered to...<eos> I didn't think you were a junkie, I just needed to know what it was.<eos> Do you think I gave you AIDS?<eos> - Oh, you did.
So you're slumming' it with me right now?<eos> It actually is a fucking nightmare.<eos> I have to constantly come up with new federal ID numbers, will stuff to myself...<eos> it's a nightmare.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Right. What's your original name?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, do you remember the address of your childhood home?<eos> Yes, I do.
- No, grazie, grazie. Grazie.<eos> - 20? - Can you change 50? - Don't even make eye contact.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Do you have a lighter?<eos> That's terrible.<eos> We should buy you some clothes now.<eos> - Why do you hate my shirt?<eos> - You don't listen.<eos> - Oh, I listen.<eos> - No, you still don't.
You reprogram one of the gates?<eos> Crack the surveillance?<eos> Leave the whip.<eos> You know the rules and why they exist.<eos> Everything in Vega has a purpose.<eos> That's how the city survives.<eos> Founding law.<eos> "For the protection and good of all, gates are inviolable."<eos> We have a right to leave.<eos> We all do.
Should I wake him?<eos> That's his wife's job.<eos> Daniel?<eos> Margaux called. There's a crisis at work.<eos> We can't avoid each other forever.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> What do you want to chat about?<eos> The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.
Daniel?<eos> Margaux called. There's a crisis at work.<eos> We can't avoid each other forever.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> What do you want to chat about?<eos> The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.<eos> Not much, anyway.<eos> That about does it for me.
Well... Here's the reality.<eos> Ed and Barbara Osbourne were my parents.<eos> I-I don't really, uh, remember much about her.<eos> And after that, Dad married Anne.<eos> Anne didn't give a damn about me, so... Neither did he.<eos> To feel that kind of rejection from your -- your father makes you feel like, um...<eos> It made me feel like there was something wrong with me... No...<eos> Something, uh...<eos> Something bad, unlovable.<eos> I still do.
Your memories will return, Emily, and when they do, I suggest you come to me first.<eos> Look, you've already taken two bullets to the stomach.<eos> Going forward...<eos> I'd watch your back.<eos> Patrick...<eos> I need any details you can give me about that box Nolan has hidden in his house.<eos> I'm hiring someone to go in there and get it.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Or do you not trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
I can do it.<eos> Or do you not trust me?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I need a professional to do this sooner rather than later.<eos> Emily's recovering in my house, and I need every bit of leverage I can get against her before she recovers her memory.<eos> Memory of what?<eos> You didn't shoot her.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Daniel did.
Hey, buddy.<eos> You gonna invite me in?<eos> Yeah, um, now's not a good time.<eos> Yeah, I'm coming in just the same.<eos> Fred, no.<eos> Wait. I...<eos> We've known each other a long time, Gary.<eos> You're hurting.<eos> I know that. A lot of folks know that.<eos> Yeah, do they?
Why did he spare me?<eos> There must be a purpose, some reason.<eos> Well, that's what I told myself.<eos> That's how I woke up every day and put one foot in front of the other.<eos> It was faith that got me through.<eos> But these past weeks, that faith has been replaced with certainty.<eos> I am here for a reason, as are you, as is everyone aboard this ship.<eos> You are here to lead us, And we are here to follow, to execute your vision.<eos> I don't have a vision.<eos> You do.
No matter what happens in this world, a child has a right to know there is somebody who will stand up for them.<eos> Even if they're a cold-blooded killer?<eos> The drugs had taken over my boy.<eos> I know my son.<eos> And what happened that evening, that wasn't who he was.<eos> I thought I knew my son, too.<eos> Emma tried to warn me that he needed help.<eos> Small things... I didn't listen.<eos> Mrs. Clark, do you think we're reunited with loved ones after death?<eos> Yes, I do.
Get the engines going!<eos> They're getting away!<eos> They are slipping through our fingers!<eos> I want an immediate status on the radar system and torpedos!<eos> Got visual.<eos> Contact!<eos> Danny, do it!<eos> You rocked it, man!<eos> You really rocked it!<eos> We did it, sir.
You won't do TV. It's just... nobody wants you.<eos> I'm working on some clean stuff right now.<eos> Okay, great. What's it about?<eos> - Gun control.<eos> - See?<eos> What is it with you and having opinions?<eos> Well, you got to have an opinion.<eos> No, you don't, Jim.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's not safe! Ramona, you let me out.<eos> Let me out of this room right now!<eos> You don't know what they're capable of!<eos> I know they're bad, and you can't fight them like this!<eos> [Roaring]<eos> Open the door!<eos> [Groaning]<eos> [Mark]:<eos> Once he sees us, he'll come around.<eos> What if he doesn't?
- The old woman? Why?<eos> - She's Julia's mother.<eos> - Your mother?<eos> - Just let me make sure she's all right.<eos> Go.<eos> I always knew you were capable of murder, but mass murder?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're telling me you know nothing about the outbreak in Puerto Rico?<eos> NARVIK A. You don't know about that?<eos> Of course he does.
I thought you were going down to the cabin.<eos> - Level E.<eos> - Daniel?<eos> - Miksa.<eos> - I'm his brother.<eos> And you must be the child thief!<eos> Tulok, no!<eos> - We came to help these people.<eos> Sergio says you don't have enough snowmobiles to evacuate.<eos> Now you do.
I went down to my room and I called the police.<eos> Were you wearing the bloody shirt when the police arrived?<eos> No. I changed my clothes while I waited for them.<eos> And you hid your shirt in the closet?<eos> I wasn't hiding it.<eos> It was soaked in Jenna's blood.<eos> I just wanted it off me.<eos> Did you tell Detective McCandless the shirt was in the closet?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
To my knowledge, she did not.<eos> Thank you, Officer Knox. No further questions.<eos> I'd like to call as my next witness Betsy Lewis.<eos> Mrs. Lewis, in what capacity do you work at the Charleston police department?<eos> I'm the secretary to the deputy chief of police.<eos> Have been for 27 years.<eos> So you work for Holland Knox?<eos> Yes. I used to work for his predecessor Wes Tarkington.<eos> Jamie: And when you worked for deputy chief Tarkington, did you ever see a copy of a statement of complaint submitted by my client Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Yes, I did. Jamie:
My house was firebombed, and that tape was leaked to the press.<eos> And your husband drove off the road and disappeared, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Perhaps he didn't disappear.<eos> Perhaps, Ms. Marcus, he left you after discovering you have continued your affair with Officer McCandless.<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Sustained.<eos> You best have a point, Mr. City Attorney.<eos> I do, Your Honor.
What do you want?<eos> I know Joe Carroll is alive.<eos> Care to comment?<eos> "When asked if Joe Carroll was alive, Ryan Hardy dodged the question."<eos> I'm not dodging anything except for maybe your pathetic attempt at journalism.<eos> Is that a yes or a no?<eos> I interviewed a private pilot who claims you are convinced that Joe Carroll was trying to get on his plane.<eos> Why would he lie about that? I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was trying to lie his way into your next book. We both know the truth doesn't matter to you.<eos> Yes, it does, Ryan.
My flight doesn't leave for another couple hours.<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I mean, like... I don't want to go back.<eos> What about your parents? You have class.<eos> Well, my parents, they're out of town as of an hour ago, and people miss class all the time.<eos> It's not like-- Yeah, that's true.<eos> Do you want me to say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
The first night we spent together, you said that I tied you up, that I was forcing alcohol down your throat and you didn't resist?<eos> Was that part of your role-playing?<eos> You had a gun on me.<eos> Whose gun?<eos> First yours.<eos> And then mine.<eos> So we drank together, we took drugs together, we played with each other sexually, - you gave me your gun...<eos> - You took my gun...<eos> Your forced me to tie you up, but we never had sex together,<eos> - did we?
Stop!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> - Stop!<eos> - What's going down?<eos> Hey, that kid... We saw him do a deal.<eos> I think he's got a gun.<eos> Okay, call it in. I'll back up his partner.<eos> No, I'll go! I'll go.<eos> Wait, you saw a gun?<eos> Partner did.
You're here, so they found the gun.<eos> No.<eos> Older brother's still missing.<eos> How's the boy?<eos> Saved his life.<eos> - So he made it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Except one of the bullets hit his spine.<eos> Doctors don't know what that means yet.<eos> Yeah, they do.
What if, like the prosecutor said, it had been a 14-year-old white girl?<eos> I didn't shoot Yusef because he's black.<eos> So you honestly think you did everything right?<eos> There's no right way to shoot a 14-year-old boy, cripple him, and put him in a wheelchair.<eos> I've always prided myself on following my training and my professionalism and respect for the law.<eos> Since that night, I've been struggling to reconcile how doing everything right could lead to such a horribly wrong result.<eos> And yet... If I were in that situation again, I'd do the same thing.<eos> And do I regret it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I do.
- How about Erin fogarty?<eos> - Erin. I do know Erin.<eos> She alleges herself to be a waitress.<eos> You know, in fact, she missed the lunch shift today.<eos> What'd she get picked up for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> She was assaulted two nights ago.<eos> Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.<eos> She tell you that?<eos> No, a doctor did.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?<eos> - Yeah. It's weird.<eos> - It's more than weird.<eos> Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Come check this out.<eos> This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.<eos> Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.<eos> Did anyone enter prior to that? No.<eos> But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
I hope that lasts.<eos> Oh, I'm sure it will.<eos> Okay, here's the dilly and the sweets.<eos> We're gonna round that down to 19 kilos even, so I'll just take back 50 grand-.<eos> Way to go, Pam.<eos> And since the coke's in the shape of a Poppin' Fresh costume and taint sweaty, I'm taking off another 50.<eos> The hell you are!<eos> Can I finish? Can I finish?<eos> Since Ramón gave his word that you people wouldn't bring any guns...<eos> Hey, we didn't, not even my underwear gun.
You want them to get pulled over with 50 pounds of cocaine?<eos> What? What?<eos> Or kilos, or whatever.<eos> You put 50 kilos of cocaine on this bus without my permission?<eos> Sterling?<eos> You have to press the button.<eos> The what?<eos> You dated Burt Reynolds!<eos> They don't have the coke, lickbag!<eos> We do! Right here in the Trans Am!
We are not leaving Ray!<eos> What do you even think you're doing?<eos> I am taking command!<eos> - Hey, I'm serious!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, that's really funny.<eos> Thanks, Cyril.<eos> I-I think we needed that.<eos> We did.
Doctor, I just had a vision.<eos> You're being fired by a baby.<eos> Well, that's impossible, unless it was Dr. Baby, the baby who's in charge of this hospital.<eos> But I assure you, your vision wasn't real.<eos> It was nothing but a postcomatic delusion.<eos> You just need a little more rest.<eos> I think your family should probably leave.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I thought you guys should go.<eos> Yeah, so did we.
The cat penis you can't see, you know, till it's too late.<eos> That's very educational, Lauren.<eos> You... maybe you could take Mr. Princess somewhere else?<eos> How could you resist this little fur-ball?<eos> Hi, big guy.<eos> I'm not much of a cat person.<eos> You know, you look into a dog's eyes, and you can see its soul, and you look into a cat's eyes, and you see a soul thants wto kill you in your sleep.<eos> But there would be no cuter way to go.<eos> Do you want to rip my throat out?<eos> Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
What fucking took you so long, Runkle?<eos> I came as soon as you called. Are you okay?<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> Obviously.<eos> - Maybe this is a mistake. - What?<eos> What?<eos> Why? Why?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I need a manager who cares about me as much as about what me can do for him.<eos> I do, Goldie, very much so.
My schween is hanging on your every word.<eos> There's a potential erection hanging in the balance here.<eos> I haven't been to a party in so long, I don't know what to do.<eos> It's like riding a bike.<eos> You just have a drink or 10 and hope you don't wake up with a tattoo or a bloody asshole or both.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Get me a refill.<eos> I like when you order me around.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I do.
Start moving in that direction.<eos> - There's a miter saw here.<eos> - This is working fine.<eos> There's a miter saw right here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, I'm not one to preach to anybody, but last year, after my injury, when things went South, the reason I made it through is because I went to Dawson and asked for help.<eos> The doctor was sure it's a temporary thing.<eos> The cobwebs are gonna clear up.<eos> You hear what I said? I need to know you heard what I said.<eos> I did, yeah.
You hear what I said? I need to know you heard what I said.<eos> I did, yeah.<eos> It kind of comes and goes.<eos> What does? Chunks of time.<eos> Where I remember.<eos> We talking before or after the accident?<eos> Chief Boden.<eos> Oh, no, no. Please call me Wallace.<eos> Um, I heard you had a cabinet needed fixing.<eos> [Laughs] Oh, yes, I do.
Thank you, Commodore.<eos> They're very beautiful.<eos> Many would think them horrific.<eos> Not those with eyes to see.<eos> Are you aware that in the months of our acquaintance, I've yet to hear you express firm belief or disbelief in anything?<eos> Well, it seems to me the problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so full of passionate certainty.<eos> I'm in no hurry to count myself among them.<eos> What about ghosts?<eos> Do I believe in them?<eos> Do you?
Where the fuck you going?<eos> Cops saying they're gonna shut down Truth unless they speak to me face to face.<eos> You're gonna have to run this meeting solo, Bro.<eos> Are you fucking with me?<eos> We're getting hit, you shut shit down.<eos> Now we got an entire network meeting and you're gonna go deal with some bullshit at the club?<eos> They're shutting the club down, Tommy!<eos> We wash more money up in there than we do at every other front we got combined.<eos> You want me to just fuck this off?<eos> - Hell, yeah, I do.
- Me too.<eos> I'm feeling this. Are you feeling this?<eos> 'Cause I'm feeling this.<eos> Yeah, we... We kinda get that.<eos> You know, I'll get the wine.<eos> Yeah, and I'll help.<eos> Hey, don't you go nowhere.<eos> All right, I'm just gonna say it.<eos> I like her.<eos> Actually, I do too.
She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because...<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> She does not.<eos> Of course she does.
And got away with it.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen again.<eos> You're saying... Victor McKinley might have killed both of them?<eos> Victor was struck off for mis-prescribing strong sedatives, and all indications are that Mrs. McKinley was drugged or Carter and her daughter would've heard her being abducted.<eos> She could have left the house of her own accord.<eos> No, she couldn't.<eos> Not alone, anyway.<eos> The only other exit is by the windows.<eos> But there's only two sets of keys, and Charlotte didn't have either of them.<eos> Who did?
I... Not right now.<eos> (Luke) Charlie, please...<eos> Luke.<eos> I can't be talking to you right now.<eos> I know.<eos> It's a bear.<eos> We're talking ortho, plastics... you need, what, five surgeons total?<eos> - Reycraft...<eos> - Look, you know what Charles de Gaulle said.<eos> No, I don't, and neither do you.
(chuckles) Yeah. That's only 'cause I got burned on the last miracle implant.<eos> (drawer clatters) How about a drink?<eos> Um... (sighs) I really have to take this to pathology.<eos> Actually, that's going with me.<eos> What do you mean, it's going with you?<eos> You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis? (sighs)<eos> If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - (chuckles) Okay.
Why don't you take your pasty ass to New York?<eos> Hey, knock yourself out!<eos> Wait. Those are my car keys.<eos> - Have fun walking!<eos> - Hey--<eos> Jules, what's going on?<eos> I didn't know how to tell Trav and Laurie that they were pregnant, because I didn't know how they'd react.<eos> But they're doing so great-- I mean, pretend-marriage great-- that I thought, "Well, this is exciting news!"<eos> So how do you deliver exciting news?<eos> You do it with a party!
No, I didn't know.<eos> When and where did you last see her?<eos> She quit school before graduation. I don't remember why.<eos> I haven't seen her since.<eos> She dated an older guy...<eos> Stop!<eos> Can't you see you're in the Escarfail case again?<eos> And now Bénady? 2 murders!<eos> I don't give a damn if she dated an older guy, unless it relates to Pascale or Elsa!<eos> Does it or not?
Hey, I pay $30 at the Thai place, and they wash towels, too.<eos> Damn Thai sex workers, stealing jobs from decent Americans.<eos> - Our girls are Russian.<eos> -Eat with forks, not with sticks.<eos> Baby, you hit up everyone who's come in here, all of them.<eos> What if we advertise?<eos> Put an ad in Craigslist, one of those local business things?<eos> Yeah, we can get some meth heads to hand out flyers and shit.<eos> - And pay them how?<eos> -We don't.
Get used to it.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Up top.<eos> A lot can happen in one night.<eos> Sometimes you meet someone great.<eos> Sometimes you get your heart broken.<eos> Sometimes nothing changes at all.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> Just sometimes...<eos> Everything does.
All right, ladies!<eos> Looking lovely.<eos> -She's taken a shine to you.<eos> -Don't be puerile.<eos> You can have any girl you wanted.<eos> Why hide your knackers under a skirt for the rest of your...<eos> Maybe there is a man under that dress after all.<eos> I wouldn't put it past that one.<eos> Not normal, is it?<eos> All that celibacy does funny things to a man.
He was drunk.<eos> I went to get a knife to cut him free.<eos> -Daddy, who did this to you?<eos> -No, Alice, Alice...<eos> -Look, I'll explain everything tomorrow.<eos> -Just tell me...<eos> -I must ask you to leave.<eos> -..how long have you been there?<eos> Just talk to me. Don't say anything to anybody, will you?<eos> Please don't.
To Edward!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> Let's not disappoint our friends, Edward.<eos> I'm sure they'd all like to hear a few words from the guest of honour.<eos> I-I'm very grateful to you all for coming today.<eos> However, I do not share my uncle's view.<eos> I hold no ill will toward the North Koreans who captured me.<eos> I had no right to be in their country in the first place.<eos> -None of us did.
It's not too late for us, Walter.<eos> -We can still leave together.<eos> -No!<eos> Just... don't.<eos> Walter, why don't you give me the gun?<eos> -You never loved me.<eos> -Ah, the penny drops!<eos> -It was all an act.<eos> -Of course I loved you.<eos> I still do.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How did it go last night with your latest fling?<eos> Oh, it's over.<eos> She brought up horoscopes.<eos> You're unbelievable.<eos> She just took you on a weekend trip to wine country for your birthday.<eos> I know, and then, she brought up horoscopes.<eos> You don't have a caring bone in your body.<eos> Yes, I do.
You promised you wouldn't say anything. I know.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> But I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I was just trying to be a good friend. Ugh.<eos> Right.<eos> There's not enough drama in your own life, so you had to meddle in mine.<eos> No, that's not it at all.<eos> Look... my mom's a recovering alcoholic, so I know what it's like.<eos> You're scared that if anybody finds out what's going on, you might never get her back, so you keep lying to yourself, hoping it'll get better.<eos> But it doesn't.
Hey.<eos> Are we back, brother?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we're back.<eos> All right, pops.<eos> You're gonna make a left right up here.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you at the pool earlier.<eos> I was telling you the truth.<eos> I don't remember what you said.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Most ungifted are.<eos> What can you tell us about Jordan Gibbs?<eos> Yes. Jordan.<eos> She came by last week, I think, to have herself evaluated.<eos> How did she do?<eos> Let me guess... off the charts.<eos> I really can't discuss my findings.<eos> Last week?<eos> But she called here this morning.<eos> In fact, she did, yes.
We're gonna have to kick her loose.<eos> Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the café in Queens till 11:00.<eos> So she couldn't have killed Madison.<eos> Not with her bare hands, but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach?<eos> Well, it turns out our victim might've had some secrets of her own.<eos> Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
Okay. Well, I really need you to put some oomph into it, kiddo. - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> This is an abomination, I need to see Mr. Blake.<eos> No, you can't go in there!<eos> The hell I can!<eos> Blake, I've had it up to here!<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Blake, I told he can't come in here!<eos> Jesus Christ, Amy.<eos> Ed, did she say you couldn't come in here?<eos> - Yes, she did.
Yes!<eos> The ebony falcon soars again.<eos> The ebony falcon.<eos> His feathers are muscles.<eos> Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house.<eos> My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.<eos> But you're ready for this, right?<eos> I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.<eos> The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside.<eos> You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress.<eos> He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no,<eos> Okay, but let's build up that relationship slowly, okay?<eos> We don't want to jump the gun and spook him.<eos> (brandon) whew!<eos> 'sup?<eos> Good workout. You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.<eos> What'd you say your regular gym was?<eos> I didn't.
Well, you don't.<eos> Good news is not only are you blessed with an awesome field hockey coach, but he also happens to moonlight as a physics tutor.<eos> - Or at least I will tonight.<eos> You're gonna teach me a quarter's worth of physics in a night?<eos> Right after I try to remember it all myself.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> We're gonna be just fine.<eos> - 'Cause you know what I got? - Hmm?<eos> Motivation.<eos> And now so do you.
We are at a severe disadvantage if we don't take these.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> It's a house of horrors.<eos> And one of my worst memories, thanks to you.<eos> I told you not to take that job in the first place.<eos> - Well, that was a good score.<eos> - With a bad mark. You only went after that guy 'cause Big Jim kicked Dad out of Houston.<eos> You made it personal, and that's why you blew it.<eos> No, I blew it because I didn't have the right boxman with me.<eos> Well, now you do.
I think I may know where you can find that girl that you're looking for.<eos> Kat something or other?<eos> Did Kyle say something about her?<eos> No, but she apparently was in his room last night.<eos> That's strictly against school rules.<eos> And Kyle knows that.<eos> I am doing everything that I can to help you, Detective.<eos> As I told you that I would.<eos> Did you see the girl?<eos> One of my boys did.
Since coming here, has he ever been violent or acted out in any way you'd consider beyond the norm?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> You should have told me you talked to him.<eos> Lincoln wasn't on academy grounds. Hmm.<eos> So you ambushed him? No.<eos> We asked him a few questions.<eos> We're conducting a murder investigation, Colonel.<eos> - I thought you wanted to help.<eos> - I do.
What is going on?<eos> You're not my social worker anymore.<eos> Stay out of my life.<eos> Get your backpack, please, Jack.<eos> You don't have the slightest idea what I'm dealing with.<eos> Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
- Something sexual?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> I mean, we know she liked boys. We know what happened at the school...<eos> - Holder, stop.<eos> - How she liked to trot around showing you the whole wide world.<eos> She touch you, Kyle?<eos> - She feel you up? - Enough...<eos> She never touched me.<eos> She always wanted me to touch her, okay?<eos> Did you?
"Shut him up"...<eos> Shut up my witness, McAllister.<eos> - And the two of you are... - In a relationship?<eos> We were. It's over. It has been for weeks now.<eos> I need you to keep an eye on this place, put a surveillance detail on it...<eos> as a favor to me?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Uh, do you have a safe place to stay for the time being, ma'am?<eos> Yes.<eos> She does.
That's loyalty.<eos> There's nothing more important than that.<eos> There he is.<eos> Grandpa, what are you doing here?<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> We both were.<eos> W-what's going on?<eos> Y-y-you said something about Val?<eos> Yeah, just that she hates me now...<eos> - Everybody does.
Good night, Agent Beeman.<eos> Good night, sir.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's very, um...<eos> Actually, I hated it.<eos> I don't know anything about classical music.<eos> Well, you certainly picked it.<eos> I mean, you probably thought, you know, "Good old Beethoven,"<eos> Yeah, I did.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.<eos> Remember your training.<eos> The white-hot incinerator looms in the distance.<eos> Buzz looks to Jesse... and Rex... and Mr. Potato Head.<eos> They join hands and descend into the fiery inferno.<eos> Will they survive?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Looks good from here, Private Hill.<eos> Yes, dude, you passed.<eos> Damn right I did.
They were covered.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Like masks?<eos> One of them... I could see his eyes.<eos> They were greenish-yellow.<eos> Like a...<eos> Like a firefly.<eos> Security system wasn't triggered.<eos> Then how did they get in?<eos> They didn't.
You want help finding a new place?<eos> What's the point?<eos> Nothing in town's going to have power.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> You want to throw a Halloween party?<eos> What's next?<eos> You gonna join the Yearbook Club?<eos> Just trying to do something nice. Why?<eos> Who cares?<eos> He does.
From the way that his arm is rotated, the tendon looks torn. He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.<eos> Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.<eos> At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.<eos> We got to get him to the hospital.<eos> Should we call stiles's dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is that going to just get more people hurt?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't think guns work on them.<eos> Then what does?
Not really.<eos> Hey, how come you want to use the phone already?<eos> 'Cause after one night, I've changed my mind about this place being safe for me. Or anyone.<eos> Ever. No.<eos> No, I think you're wrong.<eos> I really think I should tell them.<eos> They're going to want to know the story.<eos> The whole story.<eos> I really think they should know.<eos> Yes, I do.
When you hear the rest of the story, you won't want me to.<eos> This is everything non-lethal I could find.<eos> Take all of it.<eos> What's the plan here?<eos> Our best shot right now is for Derek to try to pick up Stiles' scent at Eichen House. Especially if he went through something stressful there.<eos> Should all four of us be going to the same place?<eos> Where else has Stiles been showing up?<eos> School, the hospital.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> We did this already.
All I can ask for is your forgiveness.<eos> The least you can do is forgive me.<eos> No.<eos> Hallucinations are the worst side effect of anything. Mm.<eos> Depending on who you talk to.<eos> - What? - Hmm?<eos> So I am thinking about dinner. Your favorite, TacoFino.<eos> I'll buy if you pick up. Ooh!<eos> You had me at "Taco". I had you at dinner.<eos> You did.
And that's me.<eos> Man, I never knew it, but I guess I've been looking for you my whole life.<eos> To complete the picture.<eos> I can finally see past the static, Jeffrey, like you.<eos> Let me bring you back.<eos> I promise you'll never have to leave your home.<eos> Never.<eos> Is that... how you know 20,000 Leagues so well?<eos> Did he read it to you, too?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Fuck me.<eos> No unauthorized personnel...<eos> Yeah, these...<eos> Do you have any idea what this is about?<eos> No.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you mind telling me what the fuck is going on?<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.
And yet... it's still better than anything I could write.<eos> I... never was.<eos> - I stop pretending that I'm something I'm not, and I can't go to Venezuela.<eos> I'll only disappoint a new group of people.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> Well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have,<eos> I know I want it to be better than this.<eos> So you have a plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
Jennifer Rivera?<eos> Detective Brian Lucas.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> Oh, my God, this can't be happening.<eos> I know, it's a shock.<eos> We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay?<eos> There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope.<eos> And your trunk was lined with plastic. Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.
No, he is. He's standing right here, leaning off this post.<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, he's saying... he says, "Camomile, you can get some sausage with your eggs."<eos> Bada-bing.<eos> Yeah, there's more.<eos> Hold on, there's more.<eos> He says, "is Camomile a vegetarian?<eos> No, I'm not gonna say that.<eos> Well, come on. What is he saying?<eos> He knows another way that you can get some protein in you.<eos> He did that, not me.
Well, if I must.<eos> You shouldn't have taught me all your tricks, Rumple.<eos> I'll see you again, dearie.<eos> And next time, you will choose me.<eos> He should have chosen me.<eos> - Who? - Rumplestiltskin.<eos> That's what this is about?<eos> You're jealous of me?<eos> You still don't realize what you had.<eos> You never did.
Just as soon as you hear my idea.<eos> As you know, Shelby is selling Fancie's and I intend on buying it.<eos> But I face two minor hurdles.<eos> One... you don't have the money.<eos> And two...<eos> Shelby won't sell you Fancie's 'cause your dad tried to sabotage her cabaret.<eos> 15 years.<eos> Goes a lot deeper than nooks and crannies.<eos> That's why I know what you're gonna say next.<eos> No, you don't.
You're Pakistani.<eos> So?<eos> Actually, the very fact that you think this would be offensive to me is offensive.<eos> You're the one being racist.<eos> No. I'm not the one who called you a Mexican.<eos> Called me a Mexican?<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> I'm bending over backwards to not be racist right now.<eos> All right. Well, what did he say when you told him I wasn't Mexican?<eos> I didn't.
I know you have to go.<eos> You also know he's not leaving, don't you Mrs. Roth?<eos> - Champagne Glass, please.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> Less than a minute.<eos> I found a way to keep you safe.<eos> Stopping time isn't gonna keep him safe.<eos> It's gonna keep you both trapped.<eos> You have to believe things are gonna turn out for the best.<eos> What if they don't?
So, um... what are you gonna do about it, Lattimer?<eos> I love you too.<eos> Listen, before we... Uh, move in any sort of direction,<eos> - I need you to do something.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Do not say the Time Capsule.<eos> - The Time Capsule! Come on.<eos> You said it.<eos> You said it.<eos> Yes, I did.
The government.<eos> The government?<eos> Yeah, up to their usual tricks.<eos> It's a dinosaur, Alf.<eos> A real dinosaur.<eos> I wouldn't put it past them.<eos> You don't half talk a lot of rubbish, Alfie.<eos> See you don't stay out too late now.<eos> You know me.<eos> Yes. I do!
You don't have to be afraid of him.<eos> I'm not.<eos> What is it then?<eos> Is someone gonna come take me away, too?<eos> Nobody's gonna come and take you away.<eos> Why would you even think that?<eos> Because... I'm different.<eos> People think I'm strange.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> You do.
Dead men don't get lawyers.<eos> My daughter been in to see me?<eos> No, but the deputies have already been to her house looking for your money.<eos> I think you've put her through enough.<eos> I want to talk to her.<eos> I would love to accommodate you, Mr. Richards. Give me a reason to.<eos> I'm not the only one the FBI will be interested in.<eos> If they take me, they take Jacob Langston, too.<eos> Do you really think that I care what happens to that little freak of nature?<eos> Maybe not... but he does.
You never have to go back there.<eos> But Sif is on the hunt.<eos> She will not rest, she will not stop.<eos> I will not know peace.<eos> So we take her out of the equation.<eos> Eliminate the threat.<eos> The graves of Asgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.<eos> Do not make the same mistake.<eos> You do not know her.<eos> No, I don't.
So you want to check out that whole 818 thing tonight?<eos> Um, let me think. No.<eos> Sounds pretty cool, actually.<eos> Well, yeah, if you're into that drama geek shit.<eos> Honey, I'll be right back. Hmm?<eos> Hmm?<eos> I'll drive you, you can Uber back.<eos> I didn't even say we were going.<eos> Yeah, I know you didn't.<eos> I did. Huh?
Okay.<eos> Who is he?<eos> An ancient creature... who feeds on the blood of his victims.<eos> Like a vampire.<eos> I use the term strigoi.<eos> Which is what? "Vampire" in-<eos> - Romanian.<eos> Now, take away the cape, the fangs, the accent.<eos> He's a predator, a leech, a blemish. And I know it's hard to believe, but-<eos> Even I didn't at first.
She did?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> How'd you find her?<eos> Oh, she walked about six blocks, went into a coffee shop and ordered a martini.<eos> Fortunately, she was wearing her ID bracelet.<eos> - There she is, my beautiful daughter.<eos> - Hola, Mama.<eos> Dr. Martinez, this is her third incident.<eos> I understand. But please, she loves it here.<eos> I do not.
You need me to call, tell them you're coming back?<eos> No, I already did.<eos> Shouldn't smoke, you know.<eos> Your father smoked two packs a day as long as I knew him.<eos> Seems to be doing just fine.<eos> - He won't live long.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Alex. - You didn't even know him.<eos> What?<eos> What? And you did?
Need it to if we're gonna get the guy behind the counter to give us all the money in the register. Don't have to.<eos> I can do it alone.<eos> No, I can do it.<eos> Sure you're ready to pop your armed robbery cherry?<eos> Yeah, I've done it lots of times before.<eos> You're cute.<eos> Black or camo?<eos> Fiona, hi.<eos> Did you not get your last check?<eos> No, I did.
Keep his wife drinking. We need her to stay downstairs.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You, too.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Vincent?<eos> Well, it looks like you have little fans everywhere in America now.<eos> Don't you, Mr. Keller?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
We haven't told him yet whether or not you made it.<eos> I get to decide whether I go into Witness Protection or not?<eos> Someplace sunny.<eos> You know, the vows that I wrote, they were for the man that I lost six years ago.<eos> All that time with Barnes changed him.<eos> But I'm a profiler.<eos> I was so focused on who he had been that I couldn't see what he had become.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> Okay, you got to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe one was incarcerated.<eos> I'll start pulling prison records, see if I can't get a match.<eos> These two have been in a relationship a lot longer than we thought.<eos> But even if they broke up, to come back together and resume killing after a 4-year hiatus is rare.<eos> Love is strange.<eos> It'll make you do the craziest things.<eos> Guys, what if they're married?<eos> Let me help you with your coat.<eos> Your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.<eos> Ah, she did, did she?
What's happening?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.<eos> I can't wait to see where this is headed.<eos> When you discovered your husband was cheating, you took away the one thing that mattered most to him.<eos> His partner in crime.<eos> Now, how do you think he dealt with that?<eos> Do you recognize any of these women?<eos> How many times are we gonna go through this?<eos> No, I do not.
I was just checking this cereal for high fructose corn syrup. There's a lot of it. Well, you know what?<eos> I'm really glad to see you.<eos> Oh. Because I've come to a huge revelation.<eos> I'm swearing off the opposite sex.<eos> I'm going on a three-month man cleanse. A "man cleanse"?<eos> I'm flushing out my system.<eos> I'm gonna recharge, so I'm ready for the right man.<eos> And until then, I'm putting my mind and body and my soul into fiance's.<eos> And listen, I know that you want to be more of a silent partner now...<eos> Yes, I do. Very much.
I'm not a bad person.<eos> Nobody's saying you are.<eos> Okay, look, relationships are complicated. I understand.<eos> When we bought this house, we were gonna fix it up and make it perfect and grow old together.<eos> And then we just couldn't agree on anything.<eos> Well, then, I hope the open house goes well, 'cause it sounds to me like it's best for both of you once you move on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been horrible, haven't I?<eos> He drives me crazy, but I don't want to see him suffer.<eos> I don't.
The markers won't show in her blood until her next attack.<eos> So you're saying you want me to sit around and wait for her to have a potentially fatal crisis?<eos> That's right.<eos> High-stakes game of chicken.<eos> My money's on you.<eos> I don't think you're cardiac material, but you have improved leaps and bounds as a surgeon, Alex.<eos> Okay, perfect fit.<eos> Like a 6-4-3 double play.<eos> I didn't know you liked baseball.<eos> Oh, I don't.
Hey, Alex.<eos> Harrison Ford all the way.<eos> Dr. Kalfas asked me to deliver the placenta.<eos> You don't have to do any crazy jujitsu flips like he did with this guy, do you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> So, are we gonna go with Sam?<eos> I think.<eos> You?<eos> Does he look like a Sam to you?<eos> He does, yeah.
I'm starving. - What are you...?<eos> You're always telling me to eat more greens.<eos> This will disguise the taste of brussels sprouts.<eos> Come on.<eos> I liked this place better when they covered everything - in salt and grease.<eos> - I think I like Maura.<eos> - You can't like Maura.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because it's Maura, that's why.<eos> - You did.
I never killed anyone.<eos> How could I be copied?<eos> Right.<eos> Someone else killed those people, cut out their organs and put their DNA all over you?<eos> Before my medications, I would, uh, have blackouts.<eos> I'd lose time.<eos> They said I did it, but in my heart, I know I didn't.<eos> After the fifth appeal, I gave up.<eos> You finally figured out no one believes you?<eos> Someone did.
I don't...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hope you like it.<eos> Listen... I know I'm not human, and I could never be what Pelham was to you.<eos> - Hey, Dorian...<eos> - I get it. I really do.<eos> But I'm glad Maldonado put us together.<eos> Am I really the reason that you want to stay on the force?<eos> I... uh, no, I never said that.<eos> To the interviewer you did.
* Ja-ja-Jamort! *<eos> Not following you, but all right.<eos> We're having a girls' night. What's your type, Jill?<eos> You like 'em big?<eos> I like 'em big.<eos> I think you should probably call me Sergeant Perez.<eos> Aw, come on, little budget Jessica Alba.<eos> It's girls' night!<eos> She needs a nickname.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yes...
No, no, no, nobody hired anybody, all right?<eos> He's just a nice old man who's clearly a little lonely.<eos> He returned my bag, so I thought I should pay it forward.<eos> You might want to look backwards.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Uh, Bob?<eos> I think your coffee machine's broken.<eos> How did your book meeting go?<eos> Yeah, does Bridget Ellis really want to publish your novel?<eos> Yes, she does.
Nope, nope, nope.<eos> Starting to sweat.<eos> Neal, don't you close that window.<eos> Sorry, window's closed.<eos> Neal, don't you walk away!<eos> Neal!<eos> He's in big trouble.<eos> You had the ball, you were almost to the end zone, and then on the 1-yard line, you grabbed the knife and stabbed the ball.<eos> - Hey, leave him alone.<eos> He did okay.
Oh, Mel, baby, come on!<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is our first high-school party.<eos> I mean, we're watching behind glass, but I'm still counting it.<eos> I'm sure Katie can explain this.<eos> And you think she'll tell the truth?<eos> - Yes. I trust our daughter.<eos> - Oh, and I don't?<eos> I don't, actually.
Not until we figure out what to do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, yes.<eos> - I mean it, I'm serious.<eos> This could end up very badly if this gets out.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was... really trying to help.<eos> Well, at least no one knows.<eos> - Ana does.
You let a man die for your ship?<eos> What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay? !<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I would give anything to take it back, to make things right.<eos> Anything?<eos> Yes... anything.<eos> How am I supposed to trust a man who no longer believes in love?<eos> I still do.
I hope you're right.<eos> I am.<eos> James?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Half the world away.<eos> Come.<eos> My lord, are the mechanisms ready?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I thought for a moment you'd said, "no."<eos> I did.
That's good.<eos> Good, good.<eos> You are an invaluable asset to me, and so, General Scott, I feel it better to apply your acumen where it is most needed-- on the front.<eos> But, sir, a captain can't run the intelligence branch.<eos> That's why I have promoted him to major.<eos> I wish you the best of luck, Your Excellency.<eos> He is a fine general.<eos> Thank you for this promotion, sir.<eos> - I pray I do you proud.<eos> - As do I.
How many troubles do you have inside you?<eos> Crockers have been killing for a long time.<eos> Okay, so what you're telling me is that you have hundreds of troubles and any one of those could just pop up at any time? - How... - I don't know, Dwight.<eos> Look, we just have to find Mara.<eos> She created The Troubles.<eos> She's got to know how to end them.<eos> Mara created The Troubles?<eos> Yeah, I thought you knew.<eos> I just figured Vince or Nathan would have told you.<eos> No, they didn't.
I've been single too long.<eos> Guys can sense it. No, they can't.<eos> Yes, they can.<eos> It's a proven fact. Okay, it's anecdotal, but it's true, all right?<eos> they don't like desperate, and they don't like to wait.<eos> Like Gabe, for example. What do you mean, "like Gabe"?<eos> Well, you know he's leaving, right?<eos> Not, like, for good. He's just leaving the precinct.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
There's something that I need to talk to you about.<eos> I didn't realize when we were dating, but you were the best man I'd ever meet.<eos> Life hasn't gone the way that I thought it would.<eos> I'm almost 40, still single.<eos> All the guys I dated were jerks.<eos> Except for you.<eos> You are the kindest, most ethical person I've ever met.<eos> Okay, I'm a, I'm a happily, happily, happily...<eos> Oh, I don't want you to leave your wife.<eos> You don't?
She passed last night Mr. Fortenberry.<eos> She was killed by a vampire.<eos> God. No.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss. I, um....<eos> She said if I left, she was gonna die, and she did.<eos> You listen to me, bubba.<eos> You left because you had to.<eos> And I have to believe, deep down, Big Max knew that.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah, I suppose I am.<eos> All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.<eos> We gots to keep moving, though.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - We've come this far and we're almost...<eos> Well, well, look who we have here.<eos> You had no right to kill that man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> - You had no goddamn right.<eos> - Oh, actually, I do.
Hoyt?<eos> He's where?<eos> - At the BBG.<eos> - He's acting like he doesn't even know you.<eos> - Yeah, that's because he doesn't.<eos> Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?<eos> - I'm on my way. - Okay.<eos> So... -...should I use this on you?<eos> How much does it say to use?<eos> It doesn't.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's him.<eos> Well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week Mr. McNeil he got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up and together they took the law into their own hands.<eos> Was my mama one of them?<eos> No, that--<eos> No.<eos> No, she was not.<eos> She was one of the good folks.<eos> Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her? Mm-hm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I sure did.
- Please. - I don't know how much time he has left.<eos> - I understand but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him what can I do?<eos> You were watching?<eos> I'm always watching you.<eos> Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?<eos> We are royalty.<eos> Dwarves have an innate fear of us.<eos> Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.<eos> I just realized that if you're always watching did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?<eos> I did.
- [Laughs]<eos> - You live around here?<eos> Uh, yeah, a little farther up. Ditch plains.<eos> What about you?<eos> Just right over there, actually.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, it's not my house. It belongs to my father-in-law.<eos> Your father-in-law's Bruce Butler?<eos> Yeah. You know him?<eos> - Yeah. Well, who doesn't? - Oh, right.
Does he really believe we're saving these people?<eos> I know I do because I choose to believe it.<eos> If you believe it, it is your reality.<eos> I was raised by a woman who told me every day that I was ugly and sick and a mistake.<eos> Joe was the first person to look at me and tell me that I was perfect.<eos> He believed in me until I could believe in myself.<eos> You have to trust him, Robert.<eos> I want to.<eos> All you have to do is believe in him.<eos> I do, I do, but--
Well, I hope you liked your birthday dinner.<eos> Guess now we'll just watch some TV.<eos> Why don't you grab us a few drinks from the kitchen.<eos> Nah. Why don't we have it brought out by one of my... 35 friends standing in the kitchen!<eos> Nice try.<eos> Okay.<eos> She just went upstairs to use the bathroom.<eos> Everybody take your positions.<eos> Come on.<eos> How you doing?
And he had some idea about moving the place off-site and restoring it somewhere else and then subdividing the section off to the neighbors or something.<eos> Look, I don't remember the details exactly, but the way he explained it to me... we would've got twice what we paid for it.<eos> You knew a girl was murdered in my room and you still let me live in it.<eos> It wasn't an ideal situation, but as I said, it was only supposed to be short term.<eos> Ideal?<eos> She was stabbed 67 times with a meat fork.<eos> Listen, when you start working and you have to pay bills of your own, we'll see how quick you are to snub your nose at a bargain.<eos> I can see why you never open your mouth, Graeme. Don't blame him.<eos> He thought you'd already told me.<eos> - Why didn't you?
I couldn't stay there, so I quickly changed into my jammies and grabbed my go bag.<eos> But why would you come here?<eos> I always come here when I'm scared at night.<eos> Okay, you know what? That's fine.<eos> You can stay here, but we are gonna be in the bedroom. Please don't bother us. We'll see you in the morning.<eos> You won't even know I'm here.<eos> Now... where were we?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh, you heard that?<eos> Yeah, we did.
Why would he buy a gun to kill Guy Ingram? What's the connection?<eos> Burns' wife.<eos> Meet Sally Ann Burns.<eos> But we know her better as Sally Ann Caldwell.<eos> The name on the other plane ticket.<eos> The reason we couldn't find her is because she hasn't used her maiden name in over 20 years.<eos> So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife were gonna run away together.<eos> Burns must've found out and made sure that didn't happen.<eos> All right, how do we get to Sally Ann?<eos> We don't.
He said there was no room. He meant you.<eos> I need you to help me, Emma.<eos> Use your magic.<eos> Separate me and my father. Really?<eos> You'll die.<eos> I know, but you need my dad more than me to figure out who the witch is... to save the town.<eos> You need to do this.<eos> I've never done anything like that before... not that big.<eos> Do it to save you and Henry.<eos> Do it.
It was your father.<eos> This is about my dad?<eos> Some bad people wanted to hurt him.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Did you find him?<eos> I found him... but I was too late.<eos> He's gone, Henry.<eos> [voice breaking] He was a good man, and he would have been a great father.<eos> There's one thing I need you to know about him... he was a hero.<eos> [chuckles, sniffles] You did.
Thank you.<eos> Doctor, based on your extensive experience in treating sex addiction, can you explain to the panel how an otherwise-stable individual behaves when engaged in sexually addictive behavior?<eos> There's a complete lapse of judgment when the sex addict attempts to alleviate their feelings of isolation.<eos> And in your sexpert opinion, is Mr. Infeld a sex addict?<eos> Oh, one of the most prolific I've ever seen.<eos> He's agreed to let me co-write a book about him.<eos> Oh, I'm going to mention you two boys in the acknowledgments.<eos> Um, not now, Stanton, but thanks.<eos> Besides a paid witness with an obvious financial interest to Mr. Infeld, do you have anyone who can testify to the devious, reckless sexual encounters they've had with Stanton Infeld over the years?<eos> We do not.
Then we vote. I think as long.<eos> No, I think, where Iván says.<eos> I am looking for Jaco's way.<eos> Draw. Begoña, you decide.<eos> That would fit you so!<eos> That sucks.<eos> We have lost our way.<eos> Has a fire? Then we can see, where the flame moves.<eos> I 's lighter.<eos> Did you also 's joint?
Number 10, recycle scrap metal.<eos> Number 11, prostitution.<eos> Nix that one.<eos> My thrill drill is out of juice.<eos> You got to be kidding me!<eos> - Number 12, sperm bank.<eos> - See number 11.<eos> Some sheik named "Fahid Ahmed Habib" or whatever, is getting a brand-new set of lungs. - Government flew him in.<eos> - We get the newspaper?<eos> Sheila does.
Okay.<eos> Doesn't hurt to ask.<eos> If anyone wants to stop by, give his morale a boost.<eos> Hope can heal.<eos> Can hope make up for the years of misery that he put us through?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Come by.<eos> Find out.<eos> He doesn't deserve to go out like this.<eos> No one does.
Seema? I see you've met my stepbrother, Henry.<eos> Stepbrother?<eos> Why would you do this to me?<eos> Seema gave me 50 bucks.<eos> - I call dibs on the remote!<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - I want to watch Steve Harvey!<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Look, Sue, middle school can be a tough time.<eos> I'm in high school.<eos> Really?<eos> Freshman?<eos> Junior.<eos> Wow.<eos> Anyway, my point is, I've never met a more upstanding, conscientious, and loquacious young woman.<eos> So, you think I'll be okay? I do.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Uh, with whom?<eos> A gorgeous guy I met at school.<eos> Ooh, goes there or cleans there?<eos> Mom.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> So everyone's leaving?<eos> I wish I had known this before I served the good bacon.<eos> You did not serve the good bacon.<eos> Shh! Don't you have a tiny dress to buy?<eos> Yes, we do!
Lily?<eos> - Claire, stop!<eos> - What?<eos> - Look!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Okay, run, run.<eos> Come on. Come on!<eos> She looks so happy.<eos> She does.<eos> Oh, she really does.
That's right. Justin was totally rattled. He could barely perform that night.<eos> - Did he know who she was?<eos> - Mnh-mnh. And he did not want to talk about it, either.<eos> All he said was that it happened outside a coffee shop on 9th and Mercer.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> That was the coffee shop.<eos> A barista saw the whole thing go down. A woman walked up to Justin outside and started yelling at him.<eos> - You get a description?<eos> - I did better than that.
And then the only way to stop us from interfering was to bring us back here and wipe our memories.<eos> So if we get our memories back, we might already know how to defeat her.<eos> We just need to break this curse.<eos> Well, thank goodness we have a savior.<eos> I would love to, but there's one problem.<eos> Last time, all it took was me believing in magic and kissing Henry.<eos> Since I've been back, I've done both and nothing.<eos> It's the belief.<eos> Henry... he needs to believe.<eos> In this new life... he doesn't.
Ask the barman, the bouncer.<eos> There was half a dozen guys there who'll back me up.<eos> I am telling you i did not kill her.<eos> I loved her.<eos> She was my girl.<eos> Come on, Hildy, DNA.<eos> You know what, mark?<eos> I actually believe you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah, I do.
So...<eos> Champagne.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I love this city.<eos> It's like a diamond...<eos> So many facets, beautiful from so many angles.<eos> The way the bay lurks at the end of every street.<eos> I was hoping you'd like this spot.<eos> I do.
Okay, let's get this in the oven, all right?<eos> Take this. Oven mitts.<eos> All right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Three, two, one...<eos> I'm never gonna be a cop, Mom. Just so you know.<eos> What do you say, D-Hop?<eos> The lawyer said I shouldn't talk to nobody without him.<eos> Okay, well, what if, uh...<eos> What if I do all the talking and you do the listening?
Yeah.<eos> I book the bands. I recruit the clients.<eos> My friends call me "The Cat."<eos> Welcome to The Fame Experience.<eos> You want to be a singer?<eos> An actor?<eos> A dancer?<eos> If you really want to be a star, you came to the right place.<eos> You want to ask me some questions?<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Kirch, we do.
- Bite.<eos> They will always be aight.<eos> [Laughter] Next is, how do we feel about tartans?<eos> Well, honey, I'm a redhead.<eos> Even though I'm not Irish, I love me some plaid.<eos> Put plaid with plaid and plaid and plaid.<eos> I think plaid on plaid is a great thing.<eos> Monochromatic plaid.<eos> Did I not say this just the other day?<eos> Yes, you did.
- Well, good. Because we've made you chocolate pudding. - Hey.<eos> - Ooh, I can't even look at it.<eos> But you love it. It's your favorite.<eos> Well, now I'm sick of it.<eos> What else you got?<eos> But this is special pudding.<eos> Yes, made with a special ingredient.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, I don't want it.<eos> Of course you do.
We show how much we love each other by making each other miserable.<eos> Well, then there was a lot of love in that room tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah, there was!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna email Dr. Grayson, tell him I don't want any part of that snooty practice.<eos> - He kicked ya out, didn't he?<eos> Haskell?<eos> Did you tell Phil you didn't go through with it?<eos> No. I didn't have the balls.<eos> And now... Neither does he.
- Yes!<eos> I thought we were gonna go to some trendy club and have a few drinks, not take on the seventh fleet!<eos> So we entertained the troops.<eos> We're like the U.S.O.<eos> More like the U.S.Ho.<eos> Wait a sec, I'm getting a text.<eos> It's from a guy named Mel.<eos> You slept with a Mel?<eos> Maybe you slept with a Mel.<eos> Maybe we both did.
- Where I work.<eos> I'm the wardrobe mistress for South pacific.<eos> The musical?<eos> So those are just costumes?<eos> Yeah, you were a mess.<eos> So I gave you clean clothes, stuck you in a cab, and sent you on your merry way.<eos> That's it?<eos> That was my crazy night?<eos> I got the dry heaves outside of South pacific?<eos> Yeah, well, next time, do it outside Jersey boys.
What?<eos> Hey, did you start the tests on those drivers?<eos> No, I'm waiting for the coders to give them to me.<eos> Hey, uh...<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Listen, I was wondering when we were gonna get some of the drivers.<eos> We need to start end-to-end testing as soon as possible.<eos> I'm working on the OS expansion. What?<eos> Who told you to work on that?<eos> Cameron did.
Any questions?<eos> I got a question.<eos> Are you banging Joe MacMillan?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm stupid for thinking a toy store might carry the world's most popular toy.<eos> Hello?<eos> Debbie!<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Not yet!<eos> Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> You do?
Wow.<eos> That is some vivid stuff.<eos> It felt so real, Dr. Simpson.<eos> More real than real.<eos> - May I have some more milk?<eos> - Later.<eos> What does this dream represent to you?<eos> It's Emmanuelle, obviously.<eos> I saw a real future for us.<eos> Everybody did.
Everyone is dead!<eos> Everyone!<eos> It's just me and you!<eos> It's just--<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I do make a dead sexy zombie.<eos> No, you don't, Shawn.<eos> You don't make a sexy zombie!<eos> You don't!
Howya.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Just seein' if you had a horse for sale.<eos> No. Nothing here.<eos> Do you know anyone around here selling' horses?<eos> Maybe up the road.<eos> There's another site beyond the roundabout.<eos> Past the roundabout? Yeah.<eos> Have you no car with you?<eos> I do, yeah.
Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Answer the fuckin' phone, do you hear me!<eos> We've gotta talk.<eos> Have to go home.<eos> Did Paulie say anything to you?<eos> What d'ya mean?<eos> About a rat?<eos> After The Zoo he did but..
What can you do?<eos> It's nothing to do with me Trish.<eos> I feel fuckin' terrible.<eos> I wasn't gonna say cos it doesn't say it's me but I didn't want you to read it and work it out yourself.<eos> I have to go pick up the kids.<eos> Will I see you later?<eos> I've a few things to do but I'll be back after.<eos> Thanks babe.<eos> What, do you not believe me?<eos> No, I do.
You know,<eos> I've been hearing some whispers about this Castithan guy named, uh, Skevur, is it?<eos> You wouldn't know anything about this, uh, Skevur, looking for some payback, would you?<eos> Drug thing maybe?<eos> Just gossip.<eos> 'Cause you're a father now, and you have responsibilities.<eos> I know.<eos> Shortly after your wedding, I had some of my miners kick your ass.<eos> You remember that and what I said?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yes.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I wasn't myself.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> How's Tommy?<eos> Irisa?<eos> I can't believe I shot her.<eos> Ah, Tommy's got a hard head.<eos> You missed Irisa.<eos> No, I didn't.
Jess Murnane rang.<eos> What did she want?<eos> She didn't say.<eos> She, um... she came to see me today.<eos> She doesn't think I did it.<eos> Why?<eos> Why what? Why did she tell you that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> make me feel better, I guess.<eos> And do you?
- Yeah, but...<eos> - Single?<eos> Why would you tell him that you're single?<eos> You just told me that you loved me.<eos> Yeah, that's just something I say to people, you know?<eos> Hey, I love you!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.
- Single?<eos> Why would you tell him that you're single?<eos> You just told me that you loved me.<eos> Yeah, that's just something I say to people, you know?<eos> Hey, I love you!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.<eos> We did.
And I like you too.<eos> Which is why this will never work.<eos> I have to be able to write the truth about you.<eos> And unfortunately, your game's not as pretty as you are.<eos> Hey...<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Not as hard as you should be.<eos> I think you're a really good player, but you could be great.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't know.<eos> I've been putting out there for like 15 years.<eos> Yeah, but, Danny, she called you "the one."<eos> The one what?<eos> Okay, I can lead you to water, Danny, but I can't make you think.<eos> Hey, there's my legal eagle.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Does your dad still think you're a lawyer?<eos> Yep. (Laughs)<eos> Yep, he does.
But she's not mine.<eos> My son knocked up some girl he barely knew.<eos> He's thoughtful like that.<eos> That's exactly how I got my grandson.<eos> Honey, we are far too young and pretty to be grandmas.<eos> Okay, you are telling me.<eos> Come on, hello.<eos> Look at that, yeah.<eos> This is fun. Thank you so much but Ms. Jensen and I have some important business to handle.<eos> No, we don't.
I choose who I am.<eos> I am the Horseman of Death!<eos> You have no sword.<eos> You are nothing.<eos> The trumpet.<eos> From the Book of Revelation.<eos> We're too late.<eos> I fear the prophecy was correct.<eos> I cannot see the sword because I do not know myself.<eos> No, you do.
There's some people here that need your help.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> What?<eos> You pierced your ear. You used to hate needles.<eos> Yeah, I still do.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't even want to do it.<eos> It was Dave's dumb idea.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
I'm definitely not buying her breakfast.<eos> I'm gonna see if Katrina can give us a bearing on Miss Love-Em-and-Eat-Em.<eos> - Hey. - Steady.<eos> Man.<eos> Just can't seem to get rid of the crazy ones.<eos> The creature is drawn to those who hide desire in their heart.<eos> Hey, I, no, I'm...<eos> I'm grateful, you know?<eos> She saved my life.<eos> As you did hers.
Aidan!<eos> It was the one thing that gave me any hope!<eos> When I send you forward, you may bounce around in time a little bit first.<eos> It was the one thing that gave me any hope! Josh!<eos> Hey!<eos> I know you're confused, but I can explain this, pal.<eos> This is on you.<eos> No.<eos> Aidan, no.<eos> Don't do this!
Where were you last night?<eos> I told you.<eos> You know Danny wasn't at school today, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Danny died last night.<eos> How?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> He was found lying on the beach early this morning.<eos> Does his mom and dad know?<eos> Yeah, they do.
He would just squeal with excitement.<eos> I used to do the same thing with Tom.<eos> Does Tom know?<eos> Promise me, Ellie, because I don't know your boss.<eos> You and me, we go back. The boys go back.<eos> I'm relying on you to catch them.<eos> I promise you, Beth.<eos> I promise.<eos> He did know, didn't he, that I love him?<eos> Of course he did.
No, I can't because your bag isn't going.<eos> Honey, of course my bag is going. I'm not gonna walk around with no clothes.<eos> No, I don't want you to chaperone.<eos> And so it doesn't make sense for your bag to go if you're not going. Wait.<eos> What--honey, I'm--<eos> - I wish I was still friends with Micah.<eos> He gets to take an extra bag because of his wheelchair.<eos> Okay, can you stop for a second?<eos> Why don't you want me to chaperone? I don't know.<eos> I just don't.
I'm sure he's just running late.<eos> I don't think he's coming.<eos> Don't worry. He'll be here.<eos> Want to throw some balls while we wait? No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> W-what if he doesn't come?<eos> Hey.<eos> Buddy, it's okay.<eos> Someone is coming.<eos> But what if they don't?
Oh well now you're just trying to make me feel better.<eos> I do appreciate the gesture.<eos> I arrived here unexpectedly.<eos> Everything I knew, everything I loved was gone.<eos> But I found someone who helped me get through it.<eos> Ah.<eos> A friend. Someone who became a friend.<eos> So there's hope for me?<eos> I... I don't know why I trust you.<eos> But for some reason I do.
Hold the phone.<eos> You are in luck.<eos> I happen to have a coupon for an afternoon of go fish with yours truly.<eos> All right, uh, do you have any 9s?<eos> Any 9s?<eos> You're next.<eos> That's easy!<eos> - Yahtzee!<eos> Do you have any kings?<eos> Yes, I do.
- My belly is burning now.<eos> - Mine as well!<eos> But you're tired...<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> You can't do it all.<eos> I know they all think you can, but if you die, you are the life force of the clan.<eos> Without you...<eos> - I will not fail.<eos> - I wish I had your strength and conviction.<eos> -You do.
You let them come hunt me down because I've had a good ride.<eos> How would you like to get back in the fight, Joe?<eos> So what do you have in mind?<eos> I've been thinking about this whole thing the wrong way.<eos> Guerrera pack loves to hunt.<eos> They're primal, alphas.<eos> I gave you my reason for not making a move these past few months.<eos> What, pray tell, is theirs?<eos> They don't have the stake.<eos> Well, then who the hell does?
It's not like I haven't been thinking about it nonstop.<eos> I have.<eos> Makes me sick.<eos> I feel like I'm gonna throw up, but...<eos> I... I didn't take anything.<eos> I wouldn't do that, and I didn't hurt anybody.<eos> I know the difference between right and wrong.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I don't know, Henry.<eos> But I do!
- And it's a good heartbeat!<eos> This is a good thing, isn't it?<eos> I'm just gonna give you guys a minute!<eos> - This is why I didn't know how to tell you.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> - I am.<eos> I wasn't sure this was what I wanted, After everything.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But I do.
Well, if Berman knew he had incriminated himself on tape...<eos> He'd go to any lengths to get it back.<eos> Victoria, this investigation is ongoing, and exposing it to Mr. Berman or anyone at JP Harding would break federal statutes.<eos> But I thought that this was something that you and your team needed to know.<eos> I'd certainly say so.<eos> So, I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any significant developments.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir, I didn't... I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> Oh, well, now you do.
Don't you want to know when we were pulled over?<eos> No.<eos> 3:00, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> Mr. Bishop, I didn't...<eos> We told you and only you, that I was dropping something off at the airport at 3:00.<eos> After you were told this, you met with Judge Kluger.<eos> To discuss his book at lunch.<eos> Did you tell anyone either in person, or on the phone?<eos> - No! - Did you text or e-mail?<eos> No, I didn't. I... I...
Who?<eos> He wants me.<eos> That's why I need you - to help me hold on.<eos> All the things I've done, he's coming.<eos> There's something coming out of my mouth.<eos> Wipe it.<eos> Show me.<eos> You bitch.<eos> You said you would keep me alive!<eos> No, I didn't.
Did they like it?<eos> They enjoyed it very much.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I shall tell Mrs Bartlett.<eos> She'll be so pleased.<eos> Thank you, Sister.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Don't forget to say your prayers.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> I always do.
I'll make sure you have it.<eos> Don't treat me like a fool.<eos> I might not have caught you red-handed but I have a pretty fair idea of your lucrative sidelines.<eos> Desist with immediate effect.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> Sir.<eos> Eddie, I'm so embarrassed.<eos> I made a complete fool of myself.<eos> No-one minds.<eos> I do.
Who?<eos> Your husband.<eos> Can he talk to you?<eos> Of course he can talk.<eos> That's good.<eos> George, my boy, he can't talk.<eos> He was hit in the head.<eos> I don't think he sees me.<eos> Doesn't know I'm there.<eos> Of course he does.
What do you mean?<eos> Jaco Tillens, Belgian refugee.<eos> You treated his daughter here.<eos> Yes. Then you went to his house.<eos> To check on the little girl, yes.<eos> The same house where you were arrested.<eos> Did you know Jaco Tillens before coming to France?<eos> No, and any nurse here could have treated him or his daughter.<eos> Yes, but any nurse didn't.<eos> You did.
Negative.<eos> We're in an old commercial paint shop, so it's hard to get a solid result, but there was definitely a cook here.<eos> The product's gone, though.<eos> Get all residue specimens to Cassidy as soon as possible.<eos> I want to know the concentration levels we're dealing with.<eos> Rebecca, I need to leave for a while.<eos> could we talk later?<eos> Mom, I have four paintings to finish, so, you know,<eos> I wish that I'd known you were coming by earlier.<eos> But I didn't, so...
That's why I'm gonna end up ruling the world.<eos> All the big-time rich guys -- Steve Jobs... other guys -- they're all creative thinkers, risk-takers.<eos> I don't know about this, Axl.<eos> Wha-- look, that's fine.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Dress like one of the characters in the book and do a lame presentation like a million other kids.<eos> What do you want, Brick?<eos> Do you want to go the safe route, or do you want to be an innovator, a trailblazer, a rule breaker?<eos> !<eos> I do.
[ Laughs ] Very few have had the privilege.<eos> [ Clears throat ]<eos> So, listen, I was thinking, you know, sometimes people don't always have dates to the prom.<eos> [ Chuckles ] And I don't know if you do or you don't, but if you don't and you want to go, I'm around, so I could take you if you want.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> !<eos> No, uh, but if you don't want to --<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do, I do, I do.<eos> I definitely, definitely do.
Hey. What's with you?<eos> What's with me?<eos> I don't want to see your stupid face right now.<eos> That's what's with me.<eos> That's not very nice to say that about somebody's face.<eos> What did my face ever do to you?<eos> You told my sister you were gonna take her to prom, and then, like, you just cancel on her last minute?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She has like a million dates.<eos> No, she doesn't, Darrin.
Hello?<eos> Yeah, I just drove by your pharmacy.<eos> There's smoke coming from the back alley.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I spoke with commissioner Hayes.<eos> He's doing his best to find out what happened to the donor information.<eos> I want you to know we both understand how important this is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you have a chance to look over the speech I sent you?<eos> Yes, I did.
We're talking to young women all over the country, trying to understand their perspective on the national lottery and try to bring you, the public, the truth about the most compelling medical mystery and moral conundrum in the history of mankind.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Leslie Cole.<eos> - And how old are you?<eos> - 25.<eos> - Did you sign up for the lottery?<eos> - No.<eos> I was going to, but then... that scientist, Dr. Lennon, came on TV last night, and she said that things are gonna get better.<eos> So I figured I'd wait.<eos> And do it the right way.
No.<eos> She wasn't.<eos> I saw her.<eos> She was on medication.<eos> I saw the pills.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> She has a problem.<eos> I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.
I saw her.<eos> She was on medication.<eos> I saw the pills.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> She has a problem.<eos> I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.<eos> But if she did hear our conversation...<eos> She didn't.
Yeah, it was fascinating, because last time<eos> I came down it was wet as well, and basically, whenever you have me on, unsurprisingly, it is the wettest, James Blunt is the wettest lap.<eos> We have had two previous wet laps in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Hugh Bonneville at 1.50.1, Tom Hiddleston last week at 1.4.9, so bearing in mind, he was very wet, but nothing like...<eos> Not nearly as wet as me.<eos> So come on, where do you think you come?<eos> I really hope I haven't humiliated myself too much.<eos> No, you haven't humiliated yourself, because you went out there, which is brave enough, and you drove around in it, which is very marvellous and you looked determined.<eos> Like one of those schools where everyone's a winner.<eos> You did... 1... 49... 4.
I want to fix them.<eos> Well, this is the only way to fix him. And it's an easy fix.<eos> Look, that's the nice thing about ortho.<eos> Most of them are easy fixes, but they take strength and power that not a lot of people have...<eos> - or the fearlessness.<eos> - What's next?<eos> - Uh, next.<eos> Next... we drill.<eos> [drill whirs] Yes.<eos> April: How you doing, Dr. Shepherd?
Yes, great question.<eos> I have been thinking of rebranding myself.<eos> What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?<eos> Isn't "Juan" a man's name?<eos> No, it means "flower."<eos> I think it means "John."<eos> Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.7 FM, the Groove.<eos> Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?<eos> Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira.<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
This is really the last place you have available? Dang.<eos> Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.<eos> - You wanted to see me?<eos> - Yeah, real quick.<eos> Remember when you said you would close up shop - on the slogan thing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You did do that, right?<eos> You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the "Stick up the butt" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
- You're here for the toy convention? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Been meaning to get there myself.<eos> Supposed to get an award tonight.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You in the toy business?<eos> Inventor.<eos> You know the Finger Faddle?<eos> Oh, God, my kids used to play that game for hours.<eos> Some still do.
Bullshit.<eos> Whatever this is, it ain't about Grace.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right. Ii isn't.<eos> This is about me not wanting to be with you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's exactly what Antoinette said was gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, fucking Antoinette.<eos> Of course she did. Yeah.
Why the Navy uniform?<eos> Any connection between these two?<eos> I've got the warrant.<eos> I'm going to Bodeen's office.<eos> Maybe I can find something there.<eos> I'll do a matrix of their cell phone, e-mails, credit cards; see if their paths crossed anywhere.<eos> Where is DiNozzo?<eos> He was trying to hook up with his father.<eos> Gibbs said you have something for me.<eos> Yes, I do.
This guy, great private dick.<eos> Rubbed elbows with the rich and powerful from all around the world.<eos> Sort of a classic Warner Brothers set deck, you know, noir atmosphere.<eos> Yeah, except it's all phony.<eos> It's fake, just like him.<eos> Would you take that hat off?<eos> When Bodeen was on his game, it was a great life.<eos> Until it all came crashing down around him.<eos> I wonder how he paid his rent.<eos> He didn't.
So what do you think about our parents?<eos> I think... It's weird.<eos> Exactly what I thought... until I saw them together.<eos> It's real.<eos> And sweet.<eos> They're in love.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does your mom know what she's in for?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - She does.
Joe didn't send me.<eos> But I know this is important to him.<eos> Important, hmm?<eos> What did Joe tell you about me?<eos> Look, I know you guys humped all over Europe or whatever.<eos> - And I don't care.<eos> - Oh, is that how he put it?<eos> Because I seem to remember it fairly differently.<eos> - Did he tell you I left him?<eos> - Yeah, he did.
- Visit?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm gonna redecorate.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.<eos> - You go right ahead.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I just wanted to make sure that you had all the numbers on the "sanctuary states."<eos> Oh-- oh, yes.<eos> Yes, I do. Yes.
God, I'm tal... I feel like I'm talking a lot.<eos> I mean, it's just...<eos> Even when I'm thinking "stop talking," this is still going and I'm still talking.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Mm-hmm. Maybe you should tell my husband that. 'Cause he was... he was the one that was so into me doing this therapy thing, and really, he's the one that...<eos> that needs to be here. His mother... I mean, she's controlling, overbearing, manipulative...<eos> So you don't get along with her?<eos> No, I do not.
Do I have my pants on?<eos> Ma'am, I don't wanna piss on your bliss, but... I'm gonna need you back in New Hampshire very, very soon.<eos> Okay, but I've got something to do really soon.<eos> I'm trying to remember what it is.<eos> What is it again, Mike? Hmm...<eos> I think you're becoming president of the United States!<eos> - (ALL CHEERING)<eos> - Yeah, we rule.<eos> - What?<eos> - Or you do, in fact.
- Yes, simple human error.<eos> - Which human?<eos> - Several separate humans, Sean.<eos> I mean, we all make mistakes.<eos> Just ask your mom and dad. (LAUGHS)<eos> Has President Meyer spoken to the president of Iran?<eos> I'm not able to answer that.<eos> Otherwise I'd have to have you killed. (LAUGHS)<eos> MALE REPORTER: Does the president believe this is a moment for levity? Uh...<eos> No, she does not.

And you can't hire anyone named Jonah.<eos> Okay?<eos> See, I'm on to you already.<eos> Shit!<eos> I gotta go.<eos> You know what?<eos> They should be called "Dans."<eos> Well, that was an awkward Cabinet meeting.<eos> Leanne Carr knows I definitely tried to fire her. She found some fucking energy now.<eos> How we doing with the office move, Sue?
- My apologies. ma'am.<eos> - My apologies.<eos> This is very urgent.<eos> - Yes? Oh, would you excuse me?<eos> I'll be right back in just a second.<eos> What?<eos> We've gotta go back to DC. - Why?<eos> - You got the oath wrong, ma'am.<eos> You didn't say "preserve."<eos> - Yes, I did.
We've seen one or two of 'em.<eos> That's what those sons of bitches did to me...<eos> That and a lot more.<eos> Look, I know I got nothing here, nothing but burned bridges.<eos> And I know there's no reason for you to take me, but I'm asking.<eos> And I can help.<eos> I need payback.<eos> And how do we know this isn't a trick?<eos> How do we know you're not zombified right now?<eos> You don't.
About Mum.<eos> And Dad. I'm not going to do this.<eos> Maybe the truth about your wrists.<eos> I'm not a total idiot.<eos> There was no barbed wire, I know that much.<eos> So, why did you do it?<eos> To see.<eos> To see what?<eos> If it mattered.<eos> Well, it does.
Prison, Shawty.<eos> Come on, let's say hi.<eos> Hey, Cookie!<eos> Boy, I love the way you sing, my nigga.<eos> Hey. Thanks for these.<eos> It's three carats, baby.<eos> I want you to know I appreciate the talent.<eos> This is my girl, Bridget.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing, snowflake?
Do a good job and I'll tell you Cosmo's tendynamitetipstoenjoyyourPMS.<eos> Can you keep him quiet?<eos> Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?<eos> That doesn't work anymore. He just thinks I'm taking him to the doctor.<eos> So, now that you're no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?<eos> Oh, there are so many exciting areas:<eos> - Black holes, dark matter...<eos> Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn't really understand it.<eos> Don't feel bad.<eos> Neither does he.
Anyway, I'm calling the pretzel information line to inform them the decrease in salt crystals has not gone unnoticed.<eos> So, this is just regular odd behavior?<eos> This isn't gonna cost me anything?<eos> Toll-free call, just like the Bureau of Land Management.<eos> Bureau of Land Management.<eos> Hi, and welcome to the Sutter Farms family of products.<eos> From industrial cleaning solvents to our delicious baked goods, we're there for you.<eos> If you have a question or comment, press 1.<eos> If you have an idea for a new Sutter Farms product, press 2.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
This firm could use a man like you.<eos> Can I have your office?<eos> So what do you say?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> In case you were wondering, I passed on J.P.'s offer.<eos> He made an offer?<eos> - Yeah, but it wasn't good for us.<eos> Yeah, we do have a partnership here, Allen.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we do.
Screw this.<eos> Bloom, just give me one second.<eos> You are a son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, it's not like that, Captain.<eos> Oh, Captain!<eos> Captain.<eos> Aren't you cute?<eos> You can mail me my wallet.<eos> We didn't know what happened to you, Bloom.<eos> Now you do.
Didn't realize you were the one proposing.<eos> Hey, Smokey.<eos> It's just that I have to hear about it all the time, so I got skin in the game.<eos> What about a hot-air balloon ride over the lake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All right, never mind on the hot-air balloon idea.<eos> I got a lot more where that came from.<eos> Hey, did you figure out what to do with Dawson's dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
It's all about Morton at the moment.<eos> Oh, it's all Morton. I love Morton.<eos> So, erm... why aren't you wearing any labels today?<eos> Lois, how are things going with your mystery boyfriend?<eos> We spent last night kissing. He's quite shy, so I guess I don't want to rush him. Anyway,<eos> I think I'm really falling for him.<eos> Don't commit to anything until you've seen his penis.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Chloe, did you get that bottle of water I asked you for?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did, actually.
I kind of agree.<eos> I could "normalfy" this for you. - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Just listen.<eos> He's got sort of a working-class touch, which is something that's valuable, and we should listen to it.<eos> I printed a copy of the speech from the "G" folder.<eos> Why does he have access to the "G" folder?<eos> I don't even have access to the "G" folder.<eos> Yes, you do, Mike.

- (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Oh! - Oh, geez, hairball!<eos> - Oh, sorry!<eos> - It's Shane.<eos> - What are you... Hey.<eos> No. Not yet, but it's still early.<eos> - It's...<eos> - 5:02.<eos> MEREDITH: If the phone rings, everything changes.<eos> Suddenly, you're a superstar.<eos> If it doesn't...
I know we've gone through all this before, but the hospital just needs your consent one more time.<eos> - Go ahead, Murphy.<eos> - State your name.<eos> Keith Kalber.<eos> Keith, you understand that the kidney you're getting today is being donated from a person infected with HIV?<eos> I should hope so.<eos> I was there the day he got his diagnosis.<eos> And although small, there is a risk of superinfection by mixing his strain of the virus with yours.<eos> Knowing this, do you still wish to proceed?<eos> I do.
I told you that I'd work with you, help you to find out who allegedly killed your son, but you wouldn't listen.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> I can figure it out on my own.<eos> What, you mean this?<eos> Because if you were hoping to get classified names or something, forget it.<eos> It's encrypted, NSA level.<eos> I know.<eos> And we have it and you don't. Mm-hmm.<eos> Does that amuse you?<eos> Yes, it does.
What if they weren't taken?<eos> What if they got a call?<eos> What if it's the kids being used this time instead of the parents?<eos> Put a BOLO out on Ian Martinez.<eos> - Nothing yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - You texted you got the cash, right?<eos> Amber, Beth Ann's my best friend.<eos> It was easy for me to say "yes" to that text.<eos> - Why did you?
I've got Ross.<eos> Okay, that's Callie now.<eos> Um, come find me after?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Tell Dr. Bailey to go ahead and start without me. I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> They asked for you.<eos> I just need to hear it again.<eos> Tell me that you think this is the right idea.<eos> I do.
Wendell, kill the pig. Kill the pig.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wow, so at least we know that we're gonna be safe if we ever happened to be attacked by toy pigs.<eos> Let me ask you something, Mel. How do you plan to care for this completely untrained animal when you're down in city hall all day doing... Whatever the hell it is you do down there?<eos> Okay, now you're just finding problems that don't exist.<eos> There are dog-sitters on every street corner just waiting to be called.<eos> Those are homeless people.<eos> There are teenagers in this neighborhood that would pay me to look after an adorable dog like Wendell.<eos> - We'll find somebody.<eos> - Yeah, and what if we don't?
No, I didn't. We just hung out today.<eos> He watched me train a few people and we went for a run.<eos> Come here, buddy.<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Oh, I get what's going on here. Yeah, you're tired and cranky because the scary man made you go for a run.<eos> Mommy would never do that. Oh, no she wouldn't.<eos> Oh, no she wouldn't.<eos> I think even the dog thinks that what you're doing is annoying.<eos> No, he doesn't.

You know, over spaghetti, with cinnamon?<eos> I bet you never had that.<eos> Sounds fucking disgusting.<eos> You... Are gonna eat it and like it.<eos> Look, Hol, I... I might be a little late tonight.<eos> How late?<eos> I... you can make that shit for me another night.<eos> Another night?<eos> You like having me around, huh?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Mmhmm, what?<eos> Do you want to come over tonight?<eos> What about Greg?<eos> There is no more Greg.<eos> No more hotels, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> My God, Tommy.<eos> - How you doing, Angie?
Oh, shit, at 6:00.<eos> I got to go make a call, now.<eos> Well, have a good time.<eos> _<eos> Dos.<eos> Thank you for doing this.<eos> I want you to like him.<eos> He makes me happy.<eos> You cooking, it says a lot.<eos> Angie, how you doing?
The biggest goddamn drug dealer in New York City.<eos> I don't know any old, wrinkled drug dealers.<eos> They're either dead or inside.<eos> Since when do you lie to me?<eos> Since when do you hide shit?<eos> Ghost took back his loyalty, so now it's time for you to do the same.<eos> I want to change my life for you.<eos> I don't want to break up your marriage.<eos> You like having me around, huh?<eos> - I do.
What'd she say?<eos> She didn't say much.<eos> We've been growing apart for a long time, Angie.<eos> You're not the only reason this happened.<eos> That doesn't make me feel better.<eos> Does this?<eos> I'm all yours now.<eos> And soon I'll be totally free.<eos> Told you I'd come through.<eos> You did, and you did.
We should have done this as we planned.<eos> Cover ourselves, left no trail.<eos> I was a bloody fool to think the train would...<eos> - That we'd be able to...<eos> - It was to perfect to chance.<eos> The police? - What did they...<eos> - Nothing.<eos> A copper sniffed about, so I gave him a show.<eos> I got rid of the poison yesterday, and they got Ezra banged up for it.<eos> Do the police...
On behalf of the producers of the show, I agree with Ms. Kaswell's statement. - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We promised each of those kids their own bedroom and each one of them got it, but then the Biltmans kicked them out.<eos> It's reprehensible, but it's not our problem.<eos> We delivered.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Kaswell, but Mr. Hanson is right.<eos> I don't deny there is a harm here, but the defendants have not breached their duty to the children.<eos> If anything, Mr. and Mrs. Biltman fraudulently represented themselves to the production company.<eos> And the production company would have a claim against them.<eos> But, unfortunately, you do not.
It's not that.<eos> I value my job.<eos> But I love my wife.<eos> You have a son.<eos> Told him his mother's on assignment until things are definitive.<eos> I raised my son as a single father.<eos> It's not easy but there are rewards.<eos> Mr. Sadler, I, um... never mind.<eos> No, no, speak your mind.<eos> So few people do with me nowadays.
Baby, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just the girls... they take everything out of me.<eos> And it doesn't help that every time you look at me, I get pregnant.<eos> That's not...<eos> Always my fault.<eos> - The last one, I wore a condom.<eos> - Yeah, and you screwed it off.<eos> - I didn't screw it off.<eos> - You did screw it off.<eos> Your vagina, like, - Yes, you did.
But trust me, man... don't let sex ruin what you guys have.<eos> If I could do it all over again I would've just gotten a mistress.<eos> It might've saved my marriage.<eos> That is actually a smart idea.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - No.<eos> Don't.<eos> - Yes. Do.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Don't. - Yes.
We worked it out about the buy-in.<eos> And this is gonna un-work it out.<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> First it was too generic.<eos> Now it's special.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't think you have a problem with my choice of gift.<eos> I think you have a problem with my choice of recipient.<eos> Do you think Scottie would even be here if it wasn't for me?<eos> No, I don't.
But it didn't matter.<eos> Lisa.<eos> He wasn't supposed to die.<eos> He wasn't supposed to live as long as he did.<eos> We weren't trying to prolong his life.<eos> We were trying to find a cure.<eos> And we failed.<eos> You never cared about the money.<eos> The only money I cared about is the money to find the cure, and we don't have the resources.<eos> Pryzen does.
i do not.<eos> yo'a'nes john alden.<eos> john alden.<eos> yes?<eos> yes. yes.<eos> yet, you say the man who holds the secret is dead.<eos> are we certain we can trust her?<eos> i'm not so sure the servant is loyal.<eos> i used to think your stubbornness a virtue.<eos> and you don't any longer?
I'll go first.<eos> I want to.<eos> - Actually, AJ, I would love to go first, - because we're kind of in a rush.<eos> - No, we're not, actually.<eos> We are.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> Jess can go first if she wants to go first.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I do, I do.<eos> - Of course you do.
Why do you think kings are buried this deep underground?<eos> Sumerian kings.<eos> We're facing death, and you trot out Sumerian kings?<eos> Well, they're a damn sight more interesting - than British kings. - Mm.<eos> Richard III.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> He's interesting.<eos> George III.<eos> Depends... whether you find mental illness intriguing or not.<eos> I do.
I have a lot to catch you up on.<eos> So here I am, almost a year down the road, and I keep telling myself that I'm just holding down the fort for Kenya, but all along I have this terrible feeling that she's...<eos> Dead?<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> She's run away before.<eos> Lots of times. And those times did you move into her place and dress up in her clothes?<eos> In case you didn't notice, I lost my day job.<eos> Onto brighter things.<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> I do.

Nolan!<eos> Nolan, wait up.<eos> I am not gonna work with the E-Rep, and quite frankly I don't understand how you can either.<eos> There's an argument to be made for having one hand on the wheel.<eos> Yeah, and there's an argument to be made for walking away from a bad situation.<eos> Hey, that's not who you are.<eos> I saw you watch those bomb victims die.<eos> You care. You can't help yourself.<eos> Don't tell me who I am. You do not know me.<eos> Of course I do.
Irisa.<eos> I love you.<eos> More than anyone I've ever loved in my life.<eos> And I don't ever want to spend any time apart from you.<eos> I wanna make you my wife. And I wanna be your husband.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> When you love someone, and you know they're the one, you make a commitment. Forever.<eos> You don't want to marry me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Could you...<eos> Would you please?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Of course not!<eos> Your fancy mayor is wrong! Trying to impress you with repugnant lies from a disgruntled employee!<eos> Let me help you understand.<eos> Your sister was having an affair with my wife.<eos> This is not the right moment.<eos> Which is why I forced Stahma into killing her.<eos> Please don't do this.
"'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.'<eos> Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."<eos> I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.<eos> This is so touching, you guys.<eos> I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.<eos> Leslie, don't cry.<eos> It's not that great.<eos> It doesn't even look like you.<eos> Or, actually, you know what?<eos> It kind of does.
Do you have any idea how complex that is?<eos> I just want to know how long it's gonna take.<eos> Oh, so now you want answers.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No. Come on, you started it, what does that mean?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't.
Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I think I deserve more.<eos> I think I deserve an answer from you.<eos> Did that mean anything to you, or didn't it?<eos> Okay, you really want to know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You should have let me die.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. I don't know, it's a little bittersweet, though.<eos> Yes, we finally stopped Sam, but, I don't know, it feels a little hollow, don't you think?<eos> We broke up their secret society.<eos> Just take a little bit of digging. We can put them away for a long time.<eos> Yeah, I still wished I could have done more, though.<eos> That's the old you talking. The one that used to take the law into his own hands.<eos> I like the new you better.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
Protect?<eos> I don't need you to protect me from anything.<eos> I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Be honest.<eos> Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do.
Hey, Alex, we have a transoral fundoplication.<eos> - I sent you the latest labs. - Jo: What's that?<eos> Oh, it's really, really cool.<eos> First, we go in orally, and then we go in through the belly button to fix a kid's reflux without leaving a scar. It puts the "fun" in "fundoplication."<eos> God, that does sound fun.<eos> You could get on that.<eos> Just sign that, and you could be back on peds.<eos> Yeah, I'm not signing that.<eos> I have a twin?<eos> You did... in utero. Oh, gross.
How do you know I haven't cried yet?<eos> Because you would have said, "I had a good cry and it didn't help," or something like that.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I think I've moved through denial and anger.<eos> I'm ready to move into bargaining and I'll have a good cry when I get to depression.<eos> - Can't plan a cry, Maura.<eos> - I'm not planning it.<eos> I'm just narrowing down the window of its arrival.<eos> And it occurred to me today that ... that we need to talk about our last wishes.<eos> - No, we don't.
How many black kids you know know how to swim?<eos> That is such a racist assumption.<eos> Doc, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> You didn't h... nothing.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> Okay, you said he was going swimming?<eos> It's not always about race, pal.<eos> You seen many swimming pools in this neighborhood?<eos> Does Kenny know how to swim?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Sometimes it don't.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You don't know?<eos> What do you mean exactly by you "don't know"?<eos> Well, Mr Picker, what I mean is...<eos> If I die in this hotel room, it'll be like you decided to bury the rest of that dope right alongside me.<eos> Tell me about yourself, Mr Crowder.<eos> - She speaks.<eos> - I do.
And, you know, maybe this is a stretch, but heck if I know any other way to think about it.<eos> Sam Hess, right?<eos> So he owns a trucking company.<eos> And we always thought he had maybe alleged ties to organized crime, this operation out of Fargo.<eos> So when Hess gets killed, I'm thinking maybe Fargo sends these two boys to figure out what happened.<eos> And how do they end up here?<eos> Well, follow me.<eos> If we think, which we do, that Lester, on the day of the murder, got bullied by Hess and then met Malvo at the hospital.<eos> Right. And hired Malvo to kill Hess.<eos> Which he did.
E-S-Q-A-L-O-S-E-- esquamulose.<eos> I'm sorry. That is incorrect.<eos> And we're down to our final two.<eos> I told you. This is Brick's year.<eos> Look at him up there.<eos> He's got the eye of the tiger.<eos> Your word is... succedaneum.<eos> We got this.<eos> He knows this one.<eos> He does?
I mean, there was one in the bag.<eos> But it wasn't there when he sent it back.<eos> - Did he tell you what he was after?<eos> But when I saw all the trouble that we were going to, I told Logan I wanted a cut, not just the three grand.<eos> He got really pissed and said he wasn't some criminal and this wasn't about money.<eos> It was about making things right for a friend who died.<eos> He was really intense.<eos> I believed him.<eos> Did Logan tell you who this friend was?<eos> No, he didn't.
Jay was gone.<eos> And the whole thing was caught on tape.<eos> Logan, he wanted to tell someone, but we were all too scared.<eos> DK wanted that video.<eos> He had the most to lose.<eos> So... We cut a deal.<eos> What kind of a deal?<eos> Five million for the tape.<eos> What kind of kid has $5 million?<eos> DK does.
I don't have a boyfriend, okay?<eos> I'm not... you know what? I don't owe you an explanation.<eos> I have a girlfriend who I just took to Paris.<eos> There were hands in the pants at the Louvre, and that's all you need to know.<eos> Mr. Mansfield.<eos> Brody!<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Does Mansfield know you're using his office?<eos> Does Mansfield know I'm using his office?<eos> No, he does not.
You kids have fun tonight?<eos> Yeah, but it was just a first date, so we'll see where it goes.<eos> Well, my guess is up to the roof to look at the stars.<eos> That's where he usually tries to close.<eos> Well, who knows?<eos> Sometimes you know right away.<eos> Oh, you have an eyelash.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't take more than a look.<eos> You're right.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.
Let them feel the pressure.<eos> Can I say something?<eos> You're not here to train me.<eos> I know what I'm doing. I know how to handle people.<eos> So you can keep your brooding, assaholic, big city cop act to yourself.<eos> Sir.<eos> Potato chips?<eos> Why don't we have any potato chips in this house?<eos> You don't want potato chips.<eos> No, I do.
Or I'm taking this matter to the police.<eos> And then he started yelling, "Moodak!<eos> Moodak!"<eos> Which I am told in Russian means "bastard."<eos> And then the cab hit the median.<eos> - And that was it, huh?<eos> Pretty classic case of "he said, the Russian guy said."<eos> Well, no doubt the prosecution over here is gonna make the suggestion that your mind starts playing tricks on you when you get older.<eos> But your 85-year-old mind wrote this, correct?<eos> Yes, I did.
for David.<eos> A revolution begins when the desires of many are addressed by the actions of one.<eos> It's a ripple of change that starts when the first stone is cast at those in power and only ends when one side lies defeated...<eos> Or if two sides become one.<eos> Since our last meeting, you seem to be avoiding me, Mr. Mathis.<eos> I'll let you know when I have what you need.<eos> Oh, well, when will that be?<eos> 'Cause as I do my part to keep Pascal on his heels by besting him in business, you seem more interested in abandoned midtown buildings than the task at hand.<eos> Well, I have other interests that don't involve you.<eos> Not right now you don't.
No.<eos> What happened to the child?<eos> There was this shack.<eos> We used to go there when... We wanted to sin.<eos> Am I right?<eos> And this is the place.<eos> This is where I was conceived?<eos> That's right.<eos> Thought nobody's catch you, didn't you?<eos> My mama did.
No.<eos> Stay.<eos> Please, Dad?<eos> Hey, Jim.<eos> D.B., come in.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I hear Ellie's out of the woods.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two of you able to talk?<eos> Yeah, we did.
- It doesn't matter.<eos> Look, honey, we don't want you to feel awkward or ashamed, but we're concerned.<eos> Honestly...<eos> I wish you weren't having sex.<eos> But since you are, you and Tank need to use condoms.<eos> - Mom. - I keep a box in the bathroom downstairs here and I don't count.<eos> And if you need help getting the pill, I...<eos> Mom, Tank and I broke up.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Gosh. How you doing?
You know, I stopped by your house with some stupid fantasy of winning you back.<eos> I ran into your dad instead.<eos> I got a lecture about having unprotected sex and forcing his daughter to get the morning-after pill.<eos> Oh God.<eos> Not sure who that little talk was meant for, but it sure as hell wasn't me.<eos> And you might want to clear your browser history next time.<eos> - Tank.<eos> - Just so I know, was it the army guy who lied about cheating on you?<eos> Or was it Emmett?<eos> Who actually did.
- Hello.<eos> Oh, um... sorry about the sweaty hands, I-I'm really nervous.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And, uh, this is our attorney, Steve Curtis.<eos> We can discuss my fee later.<eos> Please, come, sit down.<eos> - You have a lovely home.<eos> - Not really, but thank you.<eos> So... you want to adopt a baby.<eos> Yes, we do.
He's not under oath, but you'll know if he's lying.<eos> And these cases, they were all in moot court.<eos> Imagine what he'll bring down on you when the stakes are real.<eos> I can tell you this much, it'll be a hell of a lot more expensive than that settlement.<eos> Stemple, we're done.<eos> Reginald, you did a great job making it so I couldn't get out of it, but you should have picked a better case to trap me in.<eos> Because we both know that my independent analyst will come up with anything that I want him to say.<eos> Did you hear what he just said?<eos> I sure did.<eos> And if you did, and I did... Maybe it did.
But... There's a slope on it.<eos> You're right. It's definitely higher on that side.<eos> 'We decided to ignore the slope 'and move straight to the opening ceremony.'<eos> In three, two, one... I declare... the bridge open.<eos> What a moment.<eos> And James May, you shall cross it first.<eos> Why am I crossing it first?<eos> Because I just said, "James May, you shall cross it first".<eos> He did, he said that.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Don't apologize.<eos> You have nothing to do with what happened to Mason.<eos> I thought I was helping, and I... and I ended up hurting someone.<eos> God, I never wanted you to see me like this. I want you to...<eos> I want you to go.<eos> Just go, please.<eos> I'm getting you out of here.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, I don't...
I thought it was "go-ogle" until right now.<eos> Search "how to spice up a marriage."<eos> "How to spice..."<eos> Ooh! "How to spice up a chicken."<eos> Click on that. Ooh, Rosemary.<eos> I would have guessed thyme.<eos> Google "Rosemary."<eos> Should I click on "Rosemary Clooney" or "Rosemary's baby"?<eos> Ooh, I love babies.<eos> Ooh, babies and puppies! Do babies and puppies.
- We don't get high...<eos> - Understood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Dude, do not Instagram that.<eos> The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it?<eos> But he does.
Well, in that case, I'd very much like to take you up on it.<eos> Joan, you look amazing.<eos> One of these days, you're gonna have to tell me your secret.<eos> You know there's no secret, Elana. It's about living right.<eos> Making smart decisions.<eos> You changed your hair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Kind of needed a change.<eos> Of course you did.
I'm Andrew Mittal.<eos> Uh, Doug's brother, 6D. Oh!<eos> He cooks with a lot of garlic and plays a lot of Call of Duty?<eos> Yeah, Doug's a-a primate.<eos> But I'm-I'm house-sitting for him and I appear to have misplaced his bearded dragon, which is not good for anybody.<eos> Um, well, I haven't seen it and I have a meeting.<eos> But...<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> How did you know he'd be in here?<eos> I didn't.
I had things in hand, Shaw.<eos> Yeah, things like a grenade launcher.<eos> You can't do that anymore, Reese.<eos> Neither of us can.<eos> [Cell phone vibrates] _<eos> No means no, asshat.<eos> I need to get back to work.<eos> I might still need your help, Shaw.<eos> Did you not hear anything I just said?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Thank you.<eos> I know you're this big fancy writer now, making all this money but... you buying that car without me made me feel superfluous.<eos> "Superfluous"?<eos> I read it in your book. I had to look it up.<eos> Mike, you could never be superfluous.<eos> I... I will always need you.<eos> Good.<eos> I used it right.<eos> So, you read my book?<eos> Of course I did.
And I'm not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me.<eos> Yeah, time's gonna fly by.<eos> I haven't been on a job interview in years.<eos> I'm really nervous.<eos> Don't be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales.<eos> You're cute, you're flirty and... Started that like there were gonna be three things.<eos> I don't have any experience in sales.<eos> Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.<eos> This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos 'cause they're about to go bad, you're just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.<eos> They do?
- Hey.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> I was just dropping off diapers for Divya.<eos> She ran out.<eos> Oh, well, that was nice of you.<eos> Are you leaving?<eos> Uh, well, since my house is empty,<eos> I thought I would go there and catch up on work. Right.<eos> Um...<eos> Before you do...
Really.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> Corey.<eos> Hey, Rayna.<eos> You go right on in.<eos> Rayna, what are you doing here?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I-I'm fine.<eos> They said you hit an I.E.D.<eos> No, the first Humvee in the convoy did.
Murphy says Taru traced the incoming call to the cell we found in Amelia's backpack.<eos> Signal's coming from a no-name phone in the east 50s.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Flood the zone from third Avenue to the east river, from 50th street up to 60th.<eos> Does Lewis have any known associates in the east 50s?<eos> Well, it's unlikely that he met anybody in prison on the Upper East Side.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> His last defense attorney. She lived near Sutton place.<eos> You found me.<eos> I did.
Melinda, we were there a few seconds after. We know what happened.<eos> I wasn't there, so all I can confirm is that he was shot, forward angle, inches from his left temple.<eos> Most suicide victims use their dominant hand, hold the gun right up to the skin. Don't fall for that.<eos> Lewis did that on purpose to muddy the postmortem.<eos> Well, if he did, it worked.<eos> I have to rule it a cuppi.<eos> Circumstances undetermined? He shot himself.<eos> He forced her to play Russian Roulette.<eos> We heard it over her radio. You did.<eos> I didn't.
Linda's just... Grabbing something over by the shop.<eos> She dropped me off, said, "Order the grilled cheese."<eos> So I guess two of those.<eos> And to drink?<eos> A beer'd change things for the better.<eos> Yeah, family place, I'm afraid. Oh, okay...<eos> Two ginger ales then. And I'll... I'm gonna use the bathroom.<eos> Free with the meal. Right.<eos> That's the...<eos> Hey, how you doing? Oh, hi.
I just wish you'd tell me where we're going.<eos> You know I don't like surprises.<eos> Impossible to pack for.<eos> Do you remember a woman who stayed at the Ambermere Arms one summer, a Miss Mapp?<eos> Vaguely... A busy little woman with lots of teeth.<eos> She talked about a place called Tilling, where she had a Queen Anne house.<eos> Why, what about her?<eos> I need to escape Riseholme, Georgie, and her house will be my retreat.<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> Sweet Evie, how-de-do?
wouldn't you agree?<eos> Uno, due, tre...<eos> So many movements of Mozart, I began to think that he'd discovered the secret of perpetual motion and we should be stuck here till Doomsday.<eos> She's planning another one already.<eos> "Un po di musica", she calls it.<eos> Well, I'm sorry - there's nothing "po" about that.<eos> Yes, and isn't it unfortunate, because I hope you haven't forgotten that you promised to come in that very night -<eos> Thursday, isn't it?<eos> - and play piquet with me?<eos> No, I didn't.
When were you gonna tell me about Alistair?<eos> His son Jeremy came here last night.<eos> He was upset about some things you said to Ian.<eos> I told you the truth.<eos> Alistair's heart stopped beating.<eos> Because of a heroin overdose, a massive heroin overdose.<eos> I know that he was found with a needle in his arm. I know it all.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> It must be nice, knowing it all.<eos> I myself do not.
What are you working on?<eos> Proof that my brother is either an idiot or a criminal.<eos> I went to see Mycroft today.<eos> Why?<eos> This man was sitting at a corner table in his restaurant, the very same place he was sitting the last time I was there.<eos> He received a package at this table today.<eos> I better not have been the subject of this meeting.<eos> Course you were.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It does...
Make no mistake. It could just as well be your head.<eos> Rose brought the malum here behind my back to complete the grand rite without me.<eos> Whose idea was it to turn the puritans' hatred against themselves? To use them to achieve the first grand rite in centuries?<eos> Who made that possible?<eos> Me.<eos> Yet you and that foul bitch mistrusted me.<eos> And much worse for you, you underestimated me.<eos> But killing the Samhain, do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> The question is not whether I understand what I have done, but whether you understand what you must now do.<eos> I do.
Why are you apologizing to me?<eos> I'm not the one you hurt.<eos> I'm gonna go check on my son.<eos> Gosh, it looks amazing, doesn't it?<eos> Look, here, I made you some turmeric-ginger tea.<eos> It's gonna be very good for your immune system in New York.<eos> [Sighs] You think there's any way he'll come to the concert tonight?<eos> I don't think so, Will.<eos> Now, listen, I know you see me as an easygoing, super-chill, - free-spirited woman.<eos> - I do not.
And look!<eos> It's the puppet that Dick Butkus made of Marty Weaver for his first Halloween-ween. Hey, Deb!<eos> Deb!<eos> Fantasy football!<eos> Deb!<eos> Deb!<eos> We're never going to see the Weavers again, are we?<eos> With the time change, they'll be dead by the time we back to Zabvron.<eos> I don't want to go, husband.<eos> I don't, either.
I'm here now.<eos> Family's gonna be more important in these days ahead.<eos> I'm sorry if family doesn't mean much to me.<eos> I know it's been hard... since you lost your mom.<eos> And I wish you could've... known her like I did.<eos> She wasn't always the confused woman you knew.<eos> Do you ever see her?<eos> - Like in a dream?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did... yesterday.
Uh, skinny soy latte with an extra shot.<eos> Actually, make that two extra shots.<eos> Uh, hold the camera closer to his face, Rose, so I can see his cute little nose.<eos> Yes!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Smile for mommy. Can you smile for mom?<eos> Now, you be a good boy for Rose while mommy's at work today, okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> I do.<eos> I do. Yes, I do.
What are you talking about?<eos> It's a celebration.<eos> It's fun and games and free stuff for the baby.<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I decided to give the baby up for adoption.<eos> - I'm kind of liking these people.<eos> - Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.<eos> Bonnie: So... you want to adopt a baby?<eos> - Yes, we do.
And there's no reason you should stop now.<eos> - Mom, that's not why...<eos> - No! You need to get dressed, get in the limo with Luke, and go to that prom with your head held high.<eos> - Mom, I can't...<eos> - You are a great girl!<eos> And there's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I can't go to prom 'cause I can't stop farting.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> All right, well, we can fix this.<eos> - How we doing in here?
I'm worried it's overkill.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> We've received pre-orders beyond our best projections.<eos> When they see it...<eos> I win.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> I was hoping.<eos> Who am I?<eos> I don't know why I trust you?<eos> For some reason I do.
McGee, where are you?<eos> Do you think it's possible we could've shaken these guys?<eos> No.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Oh, boss, I got a signal.<eos> These damn things won't let me shut 'em down.<eos> - It's even messing with our phones.<eos> - Got every available I.T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.<eos> We know one I.T. who does.<eos> Or did.
- A piece?<eos> - A piece.<eos> - No.<eos> - No piece?<eos> No negotiating.<eos> Look, I know what you're doing.<eos> You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.<eos> But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.<eos> I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass. - And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.<eos> But you don't.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.<eos> I don't want to live my life like this anymore.<eos> Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.<eos> Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.<eos> Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What was the something else?<eos> Mike got a job offer.<eos> And you don't want him to do it.<eos> No, I don't.
When are you going to arrest Charlie?<eos> He lied about what he saw at the ravine.<eos> Danny, stop with all this.<eos> They're letting you go.<eos> I'm not gonna stop, okay?<eos> Something has to be done here.<eos> Forensics found nothing at the ravine, nothing at the church.<eos> So even with your confession, you may just walk.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Oh, yes, you do.
This isn't a door?<eos> - I just wanted to see you.<eos> - Not my dad?<eos> No, just you.<eos> Charlie tried to talk to me today.<eos> He was trying to be... apologetic.<eos> Is it okay if we don't talk about him?<eos> I think at this point we both know who he is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
But all I could think about was... was how my mother had died, who killed her.<eos> It wasn't an accident that you ended up in juvie with Danny.<eos> No.<eos> No, it wasn't an accident.<eos> I stole a car so that I would be put in the same facility as him.<eos> I mean... (Laughs) it took months to figure out how to work my way into being his roommate.<eos> To kill him.<eos> - You wanted to kill him for revenge. - No.<eos> - Understand... that's not what I said.<eos> - Yes, you did.
But then I find out that he didn't kill my mom, that Vikram killed her!<eos> And then what happens, you know?<eos> Danny and I, we... we... (Crying) we become close, and all he talks about inside is... is you, Lacey, and Green Grove.<eos> Everything that he was missing - was what I never had.<eos> - So you just decided to come here and take it from him.<eos> No, there's... no, I just wanted a fresh start.<eos> Like I told Danny, like I told everybody.<eos> That night in the woods, you saw... everything.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> I didn't...
Welcome, Agent Coulson.<eos> We've been expecting you.<eos> I've never been so happy to buy a man a steak dinner in my life.<eos> Wait till you see the bill.<eos> Why the long face?<eos> There's a complication with the hard drive.<eos> I don't like complications.<eos> This one involves Skye.<eos> We had three teams try to hack it, but she programmed it to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it.<eos> Of course she did.
And our team?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> So, are we off to Portland?<eos> Actually, Fitz thinks the 084 plasma ray we found in Peru might help.<eos> Didn't we jettison that to the sun?<eos> Yeah, but Fitz has the specs on it.<eos> - On the hard drive.<eos> You need me to decrypt the hard drive.<eos> The team does.
If I don't leave you and sign with him, he's gonna tell Avery.<eos> And he's not just gonna tell him.<eos> He's gonna enjoy it.<eos> He's made that very clear.<eos> And once Avery finds out, oh, that's it.<eos> He's never gonna forgive me...<eos> Ever. Not that I deserve to be forgiven, but...<eos> Well, now, come on, now.<eos> Everybody deserves to be forgiven.<eos> Not Jeff. Jeff doesn't. But everybody else does.
Please.<eos> Tell me I heard wrong.<eos> You didn't hear wrong. It's... It's true.<eos> I don't know why. I hate myself for it.<eos> It was a mistake. It was a mistake. It meant nothing.<eos> - It meant nothing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> That almost makes it worse.<eos> Does it ever mean anything to you?<eos> Yes! Yes, it does with you.
What?<eos> Where?<eos> Where are you talking...<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Earl, what the hell?<eos> Did I miss my date?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Well, a couple years ago, I went through a survivalist phase and I bought a manual and built a booby trap.<eos> No, how did you wind up in it?<eos> Same way you did.
I have tried everything... water, sugar, holding my breath, pulling my tongue... but nothing is working.<eos> I have been hiccupping for 14 hours!<eos> It's stress.<eos> What?<eos> Who's the doctor here?<eos> It's stress.<eos> You're upset because Wade is leaving.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are, because you love him.<eos> No, I don't!
You realized that you belong here, or you realized that you belong with him?<eos> If you recall, I returned with someone else.<eos> I was in a serious relationship!<eos> Yes, because you were doing everything in your power to deny your true feelings.<eos> You don't want to be in love with Wade because he hurt you, which is why you took off to New York the minute that he told you that he loved you.<eos> And then you had to watch him date your cousin... which proved that he had changed and he had grown up, and it killed you.<eos> Because... guess why. You...<eos> love him, Zoe.<eos> No... I... don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.

He made it very clear that if you managed to undo him, there would be consequences.<eos> He threatened us.<eos> He said there was a letter.<eos> That in the event of his death or arrest, it would be sent to certain parties within Le Milieu.<eos> He planned to burn me.<eos> Tell them I was British intelligence.<eos> He also made it very clear that you two would be caught in the crossfire.<eos> We can take care of ourselves, you know that.<eos> You don't know these men, Sherlock.<eos> Not like I do.
Toni?<eos> - Please don't shoot me.<eos> - Where's Danny?<eos> - Where he belongs.<eos> - What did you do to him?<eos> - Did you do something to him?<eos> - But he liked it.<eos> He doesn't know what you are.<eos> I do.<eos> I do!
Yeah.<eos> We got to go.<eos> JC Dekker.<eos> How's the surfboard business?<eos> You tell me.<eos> State of Hawaii became the proud owner of that when you threw me in here.<eos> Well, that's because your problem was trying to diversify.<eos> You should've just stuck with selling surfboards instead of going to the guns.<eos> Warden says you got something for us.<eos> I do.
Right?<eos> Not in my DNA to be happy.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> No, I'm officially agreeing with you.<eos> There is something wrong with the way that I am built.<eos> I-I can't, uh...<eos> I can't just enjoy happiness like regular people, you know?<eos> You don't think you're being a little hard on yourself?<eos> No, I don't.
- Oh God no.<eos> The boobs, the hair, the nose... all fake.<eos> The maintenance alone would break you.<eos> Wow.<eos> I didn't know you were so good at this.<eos> Oh, Ben, the things you don't know about me could fill an adult bookstore.<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this, but... will you be my wingmom?<eos> Wait.<eos> For the first time in history, a son actually wants his mother's opinion on who to go out with?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I thought you were over him.<eos> I was.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Keep up.<eos> But now he has moved on to some other bimbo.<eos> That wasn't just any bimbo!<eos> That's the bimbo I told him to go out with to make you jealous!<eos> Wait, why would he want to make her jealous?<eos> - Because he likes her!<eos> - He does?
- Yeah, no.<eos> - Not buying that one?<eos> No no no no.<eos> More...<eos> Mom, you are so pretty.<eos> Yeah, what else?<eos> - And sweet.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Did I say sweet?<eos> - Yeah, you did.
- I know.<eos> Can you believe "Tuckles" was already taken?<eos> Can I interest you in either a snake or a hot dog?<eos> Oh, in a minute.<eos> I got a little unfinished business.<eos> Really?<eos> You couldn't have told me you changed your mind before I got on the subway like this?<eos> I realized I had to do it for Emma.<eos> Do you know how long it takes to explain to a transit cop why you've got a rubber chicken in your pants?<eos> Actually... I do.
I'm afraid that's not exactly accurate, Harold.<eos> Collier just sent out another coded message.<eos> "Disseminate."<eos> A shocking revelation today as an anonymous source released a classified government report.<eos> The report revealed black budget items connected to an invasive surveillance system.<eos> High-level government officials, including Senator Ross Garrison, were named in the report.<eos> Senator!<eos> Senator!<eos> Does this massive surveillance system exist, Senator?<eos> It does not.
Or perhaps some region of yours.<eos> Hurry, or we'll be dead before tomorrow.<eos> Observe, child, the quintessence of devoted marriage, how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet And how fearlessly he exposes his throat to my blade.<eos> Come along, miss Mercy.<eos> Leave her.<eos> Take him with you, tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child. The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
Why would you have to?<eos> I have been using cannabis.<eos> Why would you lie about that?<eos> Because I didn't want you to think that it would compromise my performance.<eos> I-I would never use it at work.<eos> Mr. Bray, we're scientists.<eos> Hopefully, we're not ruled by hysteria, fueled by ignorance.<eos> You're fighting for your life.<eos> Yeah, but while I'm here, I want you to think that I'm living it well.<eos> I do.
Plus, she cut off your supply at her dispensary.<eos> That is crazy.<eos> I'm a good student.<eos> I'm here to study.<eos> Right. Well, we talked to some of your classmates.<eos> They said, four months ago, you sold pot to some of your customers, and it didn't get them high.<eos> Because her plants were truly medicinal.<eos> That's why you didn't go back for the rest of her grow.<eos> You have no proof of this.<eos> Yes, we do.
You're shameless, I've been calling you for a month.<eos> Give me back the Berni.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Will you do me a favor?<eos> Buy some hot dogs<eos> Sure?<eos> Even the cook realized it was a bad copy.<eos> - I don't have that Berni.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Oh! Oh, my God!<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> Wait! No! I have other available lots!<eos> Okay, we have to get up.<eos> I don't want to have to fire you for being late.<eos> I'll appeal and tell them why.<eos> Mm-mm, up, up... (groans)<eos> (groans) Not sure I told you... my parents are coming to town.<eos> No, you didn't.
Okay.<eos> And then he stood me up at my favorite place in the entire world.<eos> I didn't want to tell you because I knew... I knew this would happen. I knew it would push you away.<eos> I love you.<eos> Mindy, I love you.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Deep cover measures.<eos> Need to know.<eos> Jones's work on the PX servers overlapped with a CIA money laundering operation.<eos> You ever heard of bitcoins?<eos> Never mind, it's confusing.<eos> Jones has and he agreed to help.<eos> I understand-- the CIA has left a bad taste in your mouth.<eos> Trent Kort-flavored, right?<eos> How do you know Trent Kort?<eos> Don't.
Why?<eos> If my client is to re-establish her base over here she'll need funds.<eos> So you're coming back?<eos> I may be considering it.<eos> Your client's housing crisis is not our problem.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I do not have a housing crisis.<eos> Not that she has a housing crisis.<eos> Then why does she need the funds?<eos> She doesn't.
- I'm not giving up on Jane.<eos> Glad to hear it. Neither am I.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I wasn't always the best guardian angel to Jane.<eos> Uh, I fell in love with Stacy.<eos> I goofed around a lot, especially with Teri in the office.<eos> Truth be told, I sometimes put my own needs in front of Jane's and that was wrong.<eos> I'm sure she forgives you.<eos> I'm also the one who told Jane that you'd think she was crazy if she claimed to be Deb and that if she ever hoped to get you back, you'd have to fall in love with her as Jane.<eos> And I did.
I don't understand.<eos> Well, since they don't know I'm Grayson, they want me to stay away from Jane. Mm-hmm.<eos> It's upsetting her, and it's pissing me off.<eos> So can you convince them that I'm not a threat to Jane so that they'll leave us alone?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Ms. Bingum, I rushed right over.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I spoke with your son's best friend, and he said that Dean was taking a supplement called Power Blast.<eos> He didn't do drugs.
Kim, relax.<eos> (Sighs) Are we okay?<eos> Yeah, of course we're okay.<eos> Ms. Kaswell. Whenever you're ready.<eos> Um... your honor, the defendant would like you to believe that this case is about professional etiquette.<eos> But the truth is, it's really about so much more than that.<eos> It's about the way we choose to live our lives.<eos> It's about limitations and possibilities.<eos> Now, do I personally believe in Sasquatch?<eos> No, I don't.
You just didn't want anybody seeing you in a skirt.<eos> I'm not sure anyone would enjoy that.<eos> Oh, no, well, that's not really true.<eos> You know, I mean, 'cause you're just always so self-deprecating.<eos> I've got stuff to do.<eos> She's green.<eos> I don't think we should just put her in with random skank.<eos> You said Zen Dolls, right? That's right.<eos> I know somebody who works there.<eos> Or did.
Know what? Now I want some.<eos> Woman: ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪<eos> ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Madison ♪<eos> ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪<eos> What do you want, Simon?<eos> We are blowing out Madison's candles.<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't care that you're her father.<eos> Madison doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> Because she doesn't.
Weird not to hear from you. I love you.<eos> Alpha Oscar Three Charlie Zulu, come in.<eos> Alpha Oscar Three Charlie Zulu, come in?<eos> Unknown caller, by failing to identify yourself, you are conducting an illegal radio transmission.<eos> Oz Turner?<eos> I-I-9-9-R-C.<eos> There is no caller by that handle at this location.<eos> Over.<eos> Mr. Turner, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Welcome!<eos> Welcome, friends.<eos> Welcome to our humble town.<eos> Please, avail yourself of our hospitality.<eos> Sheriff Elmore Leonard at your service, miss, huh...<eos> Melissa.<eos> This is Rogan, Shaina, and Xeni.<eos> My brother Geoff is in your infirmary.<eos> I'm told you have diesel to trade.<eos> Well, yes, yes, we do,
My therapist prescribed that I have meaningless sex to take care of my codependency issues.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> Well, look, look, obviously, you know, I can't... condone this kind of behavior.<eos> But, you know, if you... if you think it's... helping you, I mean, that's really the important thing.<eos> It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I had no idea that all that was going on.<eos> That's right.<eos> Ye've not told me what you were doing all day.<eos> Ah.<eos> Hey, on your feet, lass.<eos> You hardly wanna get married looking like a melted candle.<eos> Like a what?<eos> Oh, god.<eos> So, do ye no remember anything of your own wedding?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I do.

Still no luck?<eos> Never had a problem before with the tri-county jail, but now that Henry's in there...<eos> Want to turn around, just drive back?<eos> Actually, I do. But we're already halfway to Arizona.<eos> Well, Hank standing bear, what sort of trouble have you found for yourself now?<eos> Hello, malachi.<eos> It appears that trouble has found me.<eos> It looks like you could use a friend.<eos> I have friends.<eos> Oh, not in here, you don't.
Fuck you, you fuckin' cunts.<eos> Hey.<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please.<eos> Please. Don't.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Please. Please.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Don't.
It just doesn't seem fair,<eos> Us being locked up inside our houses. We didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, with all due respect, chief,<eos> How do we even know these people didn't do this to themselves?<eos> Because you were with them when they found the body.<eos> Well, I was with some of them.<eos> What are you...<eos> You don't even live here.<eos> Well, sure I do.
And normally, I don't care, but this is my sister-in-law.<eos> Damn it, how am I supposed to tell Molly about this?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She already knows.<eos> What?<eos> She caught me sneaking out of Victoria's room last night. In my home?<eos> You did it in my home?<eos> Not all of it. Some of it was in my car. Aah!<eos> I don't want to know!<eos> I kind of do.
If you don't tell Aubrey to stop bothering you, she never will, okay?<eos> I think you're overreacting a little bit.<eos> - You think?<eos> You think... this furniture will just, like, merge together all of a sudden while we're watching?<eos> Seriously, what are we talking about right now?<eos> I don't... I've never done this before, okay?<eos> I've never lived with someone before.<eos> I'm not used to accepting stupid... wooden bars and stuff like that.<eos> You always say that things will work out.<eos> But what if they don't?
You see, we walk through life pretending to be one thing when we're really another.<eos> And like the opposing sides, truth is a magnet and it sticks to you.<eos> There's no steering clear of his law.<eos> Have you by any chance heard a whisper about Mack the Knife?<eos> No, that name means nothing to me.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> That info is very helpful.<eos> You know, I had to counsel Lucas' mother.<eos> She felt terrible guilt about his death, and she said his wounds ran very deep.<eos> Indeed, they did.
Or speaking against an unjust one.<eos> "For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword."<eos> Everything is set, Captain.<eos> Now they've taken our guns, we're at their mercy.<eos> You mean the mercy of the rebels like the one they've got locked up down below. Figures that it's a Brewster.<eos> I'm married to a Brewster.<eos> Moses?<eos> Moses, do you still have it? - What? - You know what I mean.<eos> The petition.<eos> You do, don't you?
Um, okay.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Don't wait for me!<eos> I'm doing a "Create your own major"...<eos> The impact of imperialism on female sexuality...<eos> And Jordan studies dance.<eos> Wow, you can kick that high.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> What that giant step back for feminism?<eos> Yes, I did.
She thinks I'm incapable of being objective about the Ghost Killer, which is absurd.<eos> I'm being dispassionate about you;<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Technically, you know, she has the jurisdiction to decide which tech goes.<eos> Technically?<eos> I laid all the groundwork for the Ghost Killer case.<eos> I know, but you know... you know how you and Cam got into it, last time, on this one.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do you think that I'm the best person to investigate this case?<eos> Of course I do.
Oh, God.<eos> Why didn't I just wait for the pictures?<eos> You know what? I know I'm supposed to be a good soldier here, and I'm trying real hard, but we all know that Bones should be here.<eos> Which is why I am, Booth.<eos> Yes. Dr. Brennan, I specifically told you to wait until called.<eos> You are not to touch the rema...<eos> The third finger on the right hand has an avulsion fracture on the superior aspect of the distal phalanx.<eos> The fingernail has been ripped off, just like every other Ghost Killer victim.<eos> Did you not see this?<eos> Yes, I did.
The reasons why don't matter to me.<eos> What I don't understand is... why he didn't tell me.<eos> You know, often people reject what's odd or foreign to them, and I'm sure Brian was afraid he'd lose you.<eos> But I loved him.<eos> I would've accepted him.<eos> If he'd just given me that chance, trusted me, maybe he'd still be alive.<eos> I found footage of the fight that Brian got into outside Madame's Apple.<eos> I thought the club didn't have any security cameras.<eos> They don't.<eos> But the convenience store behind the club does.
I use the term loosely.<eos> Oh, brilliant.<eos> Shall I do that now, then?<eos> Haven't seen you for a couple of days.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Would you like some champagne?<eos> 'Dear Lord, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool.<eos> 'What have I done?<eos> 'Did Nigel see Ellie and me?<eos> 'He did, didn't he?
I have people avoiding my eye at work, walking away from me like I was contaminated.<eos> It's just awful.<eos> I get that, Dad, I really do and it is so unfair but the truth is there is absolutely nothing we can do about it and in the end if you refuse to take a test, at some point they could compel you to by arresting you.<eos> So, I think you should do it. Really, Em?<eos> I'm beginning to wonder. Maybe a part of you thinks it could have been me.<eos> That's completely not true. Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Em, how could you think that?<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't, Dad, please.
I don't know.<eos> I mean, you talk to god, right?<eos> He talks to whatever he calls it, His spirit guide.<eos> Isn't that sort of the same thing?<eos> Who decides that his messages Are any different from yours?<eos> Of course, if you ask your husband, Both of us are deranged. Ha.<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> Look, you're so vulnerable now.<eos> Anyone who seems to have answers--<eos> Yeah, but no one does.
Set her up with a cottage in one of the villages.<eos> Oh! I have some mistresses.<eos> In Bernay, I think.<eos> The child could have siblings to play with, huh?<eos> Wait. That's all I get?<eos> Henry!<eos> It's more than you deserve.<eos> Are you sure you want to be playing this game?<eos> If you overplay it, if he loses patience with your displays, you won't like how it ends.<eos> The two dead girls before you didn't.
This isn't looking good.<eos> You're telling me.<eos> Who's going to pay for all of this?<eos> (groans) Iron man: Modok's powered by the tesseract, too?<eos> I was wondering when that was gonna happen.<eos> Captain america: We've been running scans for trace signatures Of the tesseract, but modok has<eos> Not sure what our next move is.<eos> Without you or sam, we're flying blind.<eos> Thirty miles due west of winslow, arizona.<eos> How did...
Who are you?<eos> I used to be a chemist for the russian military.<eos> I used to make weapons.<eos> Terrible, Destructive things.<eos> You told me you taught at a university.<eos> I wanted to leave alexander nevelsky in the past.<eos> It was an immoral life.<eos> That's why I fled.<eos> I knew when I met you That my life would be saved.<eos> And you did.
I didn't say.<eos> I'm sorry I can't help you. Good luck, though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, maybe we'll...<eos> Maybe we'll just stick around, you know, in case... in case John comes back.<eos> But you have yourself a good day...<eos> Maryellen.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Well, you told us.<eos> No, I didn't.
Where's Michael? Ugh.<eos> He and Duane went to that new place for lemon bars.<eos> It's a bromance. I'm not jealous at all.<eos> - Nick, you want to come?<eos> I'm gonna be on the treadmill forever working off all that food - I ate on my "Farewell Life" tour. - Okay.<eos> Well, you're welcome, by the way.<eos> (Gasps) So long, Swedish fish.<eos> I think I will miss you most of all.<eos> No.<eos> - Hey, how you doing?
Hello. This is he.<eos> But I think you got the wrong Carl McMillan; My mother's deceased.<eos> Yeah. My grandma's name is Rosetta.<eos> Yeah. She does live on Oxford Street.<eos> Yeah... I was born with an extra pinky toe.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> (whispering): This woman says she's my mother.<eos> No, no, no, I'm still here.<eos> I thought his mother passed away when he was little.<eos> So did he.
I'm...<eos> I'm sorry. I've been searching everywhere for you.<eos> Oh, I needed to gather my thoughts. Or what's left of 'em.<eos> Peggy, I'm... (sighs) I'm not gonna pretend to know what you're going through but... I do think you should see a doctor so you know what you're going through.<eos> He's just gonna tell me what I don't want to hear.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not. Then what am I gonna do?<eos> What if I can't manage on my own?<eos> You sure as hell don't want to take care of me.<eos> I don't.
I feel sorry for you.<eos> I'm not the one in handcuffs.<eos> Oh, yes, you are.<eos> You work for the government.<eos> You're a pawn in a game you don't even know you're in.<eos> All right, so I'm just gonna mark that as a "yes" for 627 Racine.<eos> What did you want to be a cop for anyway?<eos> You think people would respect you more?<eos> Well, let me let you in on a little secret.<eos> They don't.
Who was it?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Was it your mom that hurt you?<eos> Was it your mom?<eos> Was she the one?<eos> Is that who hurt you? Aw, is that who hurt you?<eos> Your mommy hurt you?<eos> What happened?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Oh, now I do.
- Well, of course you do... in a couple of days when all the girls are out of the house, right?<eos> I know it is a lot to leave you with. You're the only one I trust to look after them.<eos> - So, will you do it?<eos> - Yeah, I'll be fine. It's just me and a house full of hookers. I've been training for this moment my whole life.<eos> Hey, Charlie. Your car's parked out on your front lawn.<eos> - How the hell did it get there?<eos> - That's where I left it.<eos> - You took my car?<eos> - Don't accuse me like that.<eos> Yes, I did.
I-I...<eos> I have no job, no husband, no pension<eos> - I know how much you sacrificed, but we are this close -<eos> No buts. I'm sorry, this is it for me now.<eos> Ali -<eos> I'm sorry, it's finished!<eos> I'm...<eos> I hope you find what you need.<eos> I...<eos> I really do.
They're not human.<eos> How'd you meet them?<eos> JONAS:<eos> There's this video store near my house.<eos> They've got this basement where they keep some of the more specialized stuff.<eos> Always came in together.<eos> You wouldn't really notice them unless they spoke to you.<eos> One of them had a beard, or a goatee.<eos> The other one smiled a lot.<eos> He did all the talking.
Then the councils took them over, now nobody knows who's supposed to be in charge, and you end up with a mess like this.<eos> Dad, did Angela come from...<eos> I hope not.<eos> But she did come from a girl like these.<eos> Ah, there you are!<eos> Sister Monica Joan has arranged the figurines in what she calls "conversational groupings".<eos> What in the name of goodness is the Angel Gabriel going to say to the ass?<eos> Dr Turner telephoned from Astor Lodge.<eos> He says until the matron is officially replaced, we must have a qualified midwife in place round the clock.<eos> ~ Oh, he does, does he?
There's nothing in there.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> How did you know that combination?<eos> I think this was my locker.<eos> Okay. What...?<eos> Is this some kind of joke?<eos> Played on us by the universe.<eos> Looks like her, huh?<eos> - That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - And the dome does?
You can't even recognize him.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Hobbs: Cesar, if we prove you're not telling us the truth, I will end your status as a confidential witness, and Hector Zamora will find out.<eos> Or you can tell us the truth and we'll go on protecting you.<eos> A-are you sure you can even tell that's him?<eos> Did you see Dante kill Ana Escobedo or not? !<eos> - Answer me!<eos> - No!<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't!
Tom's not a spy!<eos> He's a player!<eos> Hit it and quit it, Tommy!<eos> Thank you, Tom.<eos> I'll never forget the time we were out to dinner and that KGB operative poisoned you, and you had to spend the whole night in the bathroom.<eos> Yes, those dirty Russians.<eos> They got me again this morning.<eos> I'll never forget you.<eos> I needed a little excitement in my life.<eos> Mm, don't we all?
Shit!<eos> What's with you?<eos> This isn't your living room.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Don't act like...<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Why'd you get so drunk?<eos> You're lucky that Chief went easy on you, otherwise you'd have gone straight to prison.<eos> Why did you beat your child?<eos> Who did?
Start the rewarming protocol and order an MRI.<eos> He's responding to pain.<eos> One saline! Now!<eos> I've never seen this before.<eos> Please save him.<eos> Don't take him from me again!<eos> Please, God, give him a second chance.<eos> Let's get him to the OR!<eos> I swear to God, Toph, I thought he was gone.<eos> We all did.
The roads in Willow City have been shut down complete...<eos> Sorry, folks.<eos> Power conservation.<eos> This is good. Thank you.<eos> Hey, anything from TXU?<eos> They haven't even started on the transmission station... but we have enough fuel if the rest of San Antonio doesn't show up.<eos> - We need Topher back.<eos> Where is TC?<eos> - He was in the OR.<eos> Heather, did...
Okay, you have watched Silence of the Lambs way too many times.<eos> And FYI... You two need more going on in your lives.<eos> You're the one that's walking around this house in full pajamas at 11:30 A.M.<eos> I will have you know that I was up all night journaling about the complex feelings I'm having about my mother, and I came to some startling conclusions, which I would love to share with you two.<eos> - No, that's okay.<eos> - If you guys are game...<eos> We can't... Mags and I have to go talk to people.<eos> - Yeah. - All right, well, I wanna come, guys.<eos> Do you guys want me to come maybe?<eos> - We do not.
Oh, Bruce.<eos> What is going on with you, buddy?<eos> When you called and said for me to pick up my boxes, I just thought...<eos> I'm not ready for this to be over.<eos> But you cheated on me.<eos> For the rest of my life, I'm gonna be wishing I could get in that DeLorean and go back in time just before it happened and then not do that.<eos> Okay, well, you would have to take the DeLorean back even further, because we haven't been happy for, like, a long time.<eos> Right, McFly?<eos> But you found me, so... Obviously, that means that you must have some feelings left for me.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
No. I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> Pua...<eos> Kai.<eos> Pro Bowl weekend last year.<eos> I helped you crack a monster case.<eos> Oh, yeah, right!<eos> Now I remember!<eos> I figured you would.<eos> Uh, you may also remember, we kind of had a moment.<eos> Yeah... we did, didn't we?
What business did you say you were in?<eos> I didn't, Reverend.
Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> The fox went that way.<eos> Hey, this is private property.<eos> People have been hunting this land for generations.<eos> Well, we don't want your lot here anymore.<eos> The horses are ruining everything.<eos> Really? Ruining what, exactly?<eos> What business did you say you were in again, Mr Mottershead?<eos> I didn't, Reverend.
Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> I eat the fish.<eos> Motherfuck!<eos> Do you know how awkward it is to not be able to describe your own company?<eos> Like, I built Pied Piper and you can see it but I can't really describe to you what it is even though I kind of know where I'm going.<eos> You do realize we quit working on our own apps to work for you, right?<eos> Shouldn't you more than "Kind of know where you're going?"<eos> Because that's basically what the CEO does.<eos> I do.
- Understood.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But, Richard?<eos> Consider that maybe this might not be the best choice for the meeting?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Holy...<eos> What the fuck am I doing?<eos> I can't go like this to the meeting.<eos> Jared. I have no vision.<eos> Yes, you do.
Braden Morris' ALC and T-cell counts are fantastic.<eos> Do you think it might actually be time for the boy to come out of the bubble?<eos> So why do you look like I just punched a kitten?<eos> We can't send him home until I tell his parents the truth about how I treated him.<eos> And before I do that, I need to inform the board.<eos> - Yang. - Mm?<eos> I gave a patient a stem-cell transplant using deactivated h.I.V. as a viral vector in order to cure his scid.<eos> I did so against his parents' wishes.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Damn right, it did.
Yeah, it's a family tradition.<eos> We rip each other off.<eos> Christmas dinner is just one big brawl.<eos> Plus, the presents are terrible.<eos> Jack, why don't you take a minute to fill out your certificate of completion?<eos> Or, as the prison print shop calls it, "certificate of copulation."<eos> - You are a hypocrite.<eos> - What? You are telling these people that they're ready to function in the outside world, but then you won't even hire one of them.<eos> If you don't believe in Jack, you don't believe in this program.<eos> Of course I do.
You can't say,<eos> "Thank you, but..." You always do that.<eos> There is no "but" after a "thank you."<eos> Ah, you're right.<eos> Again, thank you.<eos> I really appreciate all the money you've given me every month.<eos> It means the world to me.<eos> - Well, you're welcome.<eos> - But... you're a cheapskate, Charlie.<eos> You just did it again!
Do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I don't. I keep replaying it over and over in my head.<eos> What color was the light?<eos> Did I check the cross traffic?<eos> But I don't know.<eos> Cruz, listen to me.<eos> Welch thinks you screwed up.<eos> Who cares?<eos> He doesn't know you.<eos> But everybody at 51 does.
Hide it.<eos> Yes, and I'm fine.<eos> Hide what? Oh, I...<eos> I can't hide my feelings<eos> - for you, sweetie. - Oh.<eos> So we should practice our first dance right now.<eos> Whoa, now?<eos> No, now wouldn't be a good idea.<eos> - We don't even have the music, sweetie.<eos> - Oh, well... Now we do.
I've heard so much about you.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Honestly, though, I thought you'd be bigger.<eos> And guard's been taken care of outside.<eos> Your file never made the DA's.<eos> - No cameras. No mics.<eos> - Did they hire you?<eos> The Watchers.<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> They do.
Oh, man.<eos> Honestly, though, I thought you'd be bigger.<eos> And guard's been taken care of outside.<eos> Your file never made the DA's.<eos> - No cameras. No mics.<eos> - Did they hire you?<eos> The Watchers.<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> They do.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Chloe, sweetie, what happened at school?<eos> Everybody either looked at me like I was a freak or just turned away 'cause they didn't know what to say.<eos> I called Dean and begged him to come get me.<eos> I loved Danny.<eos> You know I loved him, but...<eos> I need a break from being the dead kid's sister.<eos> And it's like I'm buried under it, and I know that you can't understand that.<eos> We do understand.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yes, yes, yes, we do.
He's my friend!<eos> (joe) stop, stop!<eos> Danny?<eos> Danny.<eos> Danny!<eos> Come on.<eos> Danny.<eos> Go home.<eos> But-- go to bed.<eos> Don't do anything.
Why would you tell them that?<eos> Tom, you need to think about what you just said. You're the one that needs to think about it.<eos> Tom.<eos> Tom!<eos> You are the last person that I expected to call.<eos> I thought nothing was a surprise to you.<eos> Is that what you came here for, to make fun of me?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Prove to me you're for real.<eos> I did already.
Rene thinks you're hiding something, that there's more to the story.<eos> Does she?<eos> Why don't you let us decide if there's more?<eos> Unless you'd prefer that all of Gracepoint learn about your hospital visit.<eos> So you're threatening me?<eos> There must be some part of you that's sick of having a secret.<eos> Keeping a secret like that's exhausting, weighs on your heart.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, at least you love me.<eos> Yes, you do.
Dave, can I borrow your shirt? - No.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Cheryl, can I please borrow your blouse?<eos> Whoa, I'm not wearing a blouse, bro.<eos> It's really more of a chemise.<eos> I'm not wearing that either.<eos> Mr. Barber, you offered a deal, yes?<eos> Yes, we'll drop obstruct for a plea on vandalism.<eos> For which you have no case.<eos> - We do, actually.
That!<eos> Bus!<eos> Back!<eos> Hey, can you guys turn that down?<eos> I'm trying to read.<eos> Oh, shut up, Brian.<eos> We were here first.<eos> Yeah, Brian, go read in your own room!<eos> I don't have my own room.<eos> Yes, you do.
I thought that we had a relationship...<eos> Are you guys watching the feed from the baby monitor?<eos> It was Sangar's idea!<eos> Thanks for nothing, Gwendolyn.<eos> Oh, hush, it's just getting good!<eos> Guys, this is so not right.<eos> Babe, just... please, just talk to me.<eos> I thought we had a relationship built on trust! Okay, squeeze over.<eos> Just gotta get in here.<eos> We do.
You know I'm pee shy dude. - Gay or straight?<eos> - Straight.<eos> - Hey, what are we going to say?<eos> - We're straight.<eos> Yeah, but what if the gay wing is nicer?<eos> Gay or straight?<eos> Straight.<eos> Wait. Why would you ask me that and not him?<eos> Don't we get one phone call?<eos> Yeah, we do.
They're heading north, narrow your search.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They must've found a gap.<eos> He's obviously knows what he's doing.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Did you know Catherine was with him?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Jason told his dad he had to drop something off to a friend in Philly.<eos> Could that be code for New York?<eos> What is this?<eos> Mrs. D wrote that email the night that she escaped town, but she never sent it.<eos> It says, "I can't protect you anymore".<eos> Who would she have written that to?<eos> What's up, Jason?<eos> I just saw what you delivered.<eos> Your dad asked my mother...<eos> Yeah, well, my mother didn't.
Where is Spencer?<eos> She went next door to distract Mr. DiLaurentis so we could sneak Ali over here.<eos> She better haul us because I'm guessing Jason is not making too many more stops tonight.<eos> Guys, please, enough with Jason for a minute.<eos> Mona knows that we were in New York. Don't you understand?<eos> Okay, it's only a matter of time before she runs out of whistles and start tearing our balloons and say Aria killed Shana.<eos> - Okay, whistles? - Aria, stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mona does not know about Shana.<eos> Then who does? Who?
Put me next to a dozen eggs.<eos> They hatching. You know why?<eos> 'Cause I got the heat of a mother hen.<eos> There was no sexual tension in here before he got here.<eos> Keep telling yourself that, Nick.<eos> Congrats, chaperones!<eos> With your help, tonight is going to be... unforgettable.<eos> I didn't sign up for this.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> None of you did.
Meanwhile the Chipping Norton set have kicked the door in, right, quickly work out what he's gone and done. They see him, they start lobbing his worldly goods, his telly, his Wii, his PlayStation, his Xbox, his Game Boy, over the balcony, hoping to knock him off his perch.<eos> Of course, by the time I arrive they're well gone and there's just him dangling there with his trousers round his ankles, cos he's wearing those sort of jeans that have come up just below your arse.<eos> -Sarge?<eos> -Catch you later.<eos> Hello, my little chickadee.<eos> Is that Nev?<eos> It might be.<eos> Nevison Gallagher?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -How you doing, Nevison Gallagher?
You don't know them.<eos> And I'm tired of accepting society's definition of me.<eos> I don't pray to that anymore.<eos> Darling, I understand.<eos> Being a young mother can be overwhelming, even with help.<eos> You sit with your child at the end of the day and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.<eos> And everything you do seems wrong.<eos> It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.<eos> I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.<eos> I did.
What-what does that mean?<eos> You're a god, right?<eos> Well, I did rise from the dead, yeah.<eos> Well, then, I guess you should know what that means.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It doesn't work at all.<eos> I mean, if you're a god, why didn't you know the truth about my father?<eos> You didn't even know you were a god.<eos> Admit it, you have no idea where we're going.<eos> Yes, I do.
What's going on, Alicia?<eos> I'm spinning, Mom.<eos> I can't stop.<eos> I shouldn't have stopped working.<eos> Oh, honey, you're just hurting.<eos> I'm so sorry you have to go through this.<eos> - I don't know what to do, Mom.<eos> - Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Shh, shh, no, no, no.<eos> Shh-shh. Oh, baby, nobody does.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.<eos> I've come to stop you because the coppers and nobody else will.<eos> If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.<eos> That's where the trouble is.<eos> Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.<eos> I've seen 'em.<eos> Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.<eos> Hold that gun up and do it!<eos> Fucking do it!<eos> Do it!
There's something else.<eos> I saw mom.<eos> She warned me about this girl Dani.<eos> Has that ever happened before, you seeing your mom?<eos> No, never.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?<eos> Because I knew how excited you were to go to Mexico.<eos> I don't think Mexico's in the cards anymore, not if you're seeing your mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't.
But, eventually, they wanted contact with their wandering son, they wanted to see him.<eos> And then you met me.<eos> Good timing, was it? Because the stipends got cut off?<eos> Do I have that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> You were going to fleece me for all you could and then run from your crime.<eos> The story you told about being disenfranchised from your family, it all makes sense; they weren't your family at all.<eos> Did you murder him? No.<eos> No.<eos> I did not.
(amy speaking russian)<eos> (speaking italian)<eos> This rock...<eos> Is a piece of the ruins in delhi<eos> After the mutiny against the british in 1858.<eos> I was executed shortly after my surrender.<eos> Jack: This. (tapping)<eos> What is this nail polish?<eos> You never wore nail polish.<eos> But you do now. Amy:
Is that a no?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Is that no? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Sorry to make you wait.<eos> Yeah, in the middle of the night.<eos> So, you brought the serum?<eos> Actually, I didn't.<eos> - Right. Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
Can you guys just chill out?<eos> Come on. Come on, take your shirt off. Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Ilya.<eos> Hey, hey, stop.<eos> Ilya!<eos> Ilya!<eos> Ilya!<eos> Ilya, stop it.<eos> You done?
Everyone, calm down?<eos> ! Maggie!<eos> When did I lie to you, Maggie?<eos> I told you we'd be safe here, and we are.<eos> I told you that non-violence is the answer, and it is.<eos> Why are you meeting with an Espheni behind our backs?<eos> Because... He's a part of me.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> What do they really want?<eos> The same thing I do, the same thing we all do... peace.
Discretion's what they're selling there.<eos> Lot of plastic surgery recoveries, clandestine meetings, that sort of kind of thing.<eos> Wait a second, stop it, right there.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Jay interviewed the housekeeper at the hotel.<eos> There was a framed picture of that guy in Annabel's apartment.<eos> And look at the timecode.<eos> Ten minutes after Annabel left the elevator.<eos> - When does he get back on? - Well...<eos> - He doesn't. - Aha.
Who am I, if not your savior, huh?<eos> And this is the thanks.<eos> You call me a murderer on a night when I have already lost... so much?<eos> Damn you for this!<eos> Goddamn you for this!<eos> Damn you!<eos> You were our mother.<eos> There's people around here who never even met theirs.<eos> You understand... the pain of being rejected by your own mother?<eos> Of course you do.
But you don't...<eos> Why are you doing this for me, huh?<eos> Tell me, why are you doing this for me? !<eos> This... this... this is what we do in Hollywood.<eos> You are my client.<eos> I have an obligation to-to protect you, protect your career.<eos> You have a destiny, written in the stars, to be a star.<eos> You're gonna win an Oscar one day.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> I do. I do.
Well, let me tell you something.<eos> I'm gonna get me my normal life.<eos> The pretty house, have me some babies.<eos> But not with you.<eos> Never with you.<eos> Hey, answer me this.<eos> Who's gonna go for a big-dicked, three-titted woman like you?<eos> Doctor says it's just extra-large lady parts.<eos> All cosmetic.<eos> He gonna do a surgery, and poof,
Wait...<eos> I don't really have to cut them, do I? No!<eos> No one's going to be cutting into anyone.<eos> We're just going to be putting them to sleep.<eos> It's called euthanasia.<eos> Trust me, they'll drift off peacefully.<eos> It's like putting down a sad puppy who's been hit by a car.<eos> We're doing these girls a kindness.<eos> But I like puppies.<eos> Of course you do, you sweet, innocent boy.
Wait... what if just left because he doesn't like me?<eos> How good does it feel to lose your self-esteem over a guy, again?<eos> So good! - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Hey, Gabi.<eos> - Hey, Yolanda!<eos> How are you on this perfect, beautiful, angel-like morning?<eos> Someone's either on a sugar high or a "got them some sugar" high.<eos> Well, I know I don't usually talk about my personal life at work because I didn't have one, but...<eos> I do now!
Yeah, really?<eos> By the government!<eos> -Course you are!<eos> -Yeah, government's got nowt better to do!<eos> No, because I know things!<eos> That's why they've been spying on me.<eos> That's why they've been watching me all day, every day!<eos> For months!<eos> And you think I don't know!<eos> Well, I bloody do!
- Bye.<eos> - Honestly, Tim...<eos> She'll hear you.<eos> Let her get away.<eos> I can't manage it much longer.<eos> I'm sorry if she's lonely.<eos> I'm sorry she wants a child, but she can't have ours, and that's flat!<eos> You're not being reasonable.<eos> Just now, I thought she'd taken her.<eos> I did, truly.
Is that so difficult to believe?<eos> That an art expert would find your observations on the work of Piero della Francesca impossible to resist?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is hard to believe!<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> Cora.<eos> You said what you think, and you have every right to do so.<eos> Tell me, does Edith seem very distracted to you?<eos> I'm not sure I'd notice.<eos> Well, she does to me.
I know what a tough business real estate is.<eos> I've made my share of mistakes.<eos> But you have to have the integrity to live with them.<eos> And not look for rich scapegoats.<eos> Objection. Argumentative.<eos> Withdrawn.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Ms. Silmas, you mentioned integrity as if...<eos> Well, as if you had it.<eos> I do.
I was there!<eos> She was there.<eos> It was 1927.<eos> I was 10 years old.<eos> Which would make you...?<eos> You do the math, junior.<eos> Ilona was your best friend, and you were supposed to take the trolley that day with her to the beach.<eos> Did you go?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, ilona did.
Do you want to tell me about your dream?<eos> Pretty scary, huh?<eos> Well, dreams are just your subconscious trying to make sense out of what happens to you during the day.<eos> What's a subconscious?<eos> The secret part of you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's the part of you that's here with me right now.<eos> And there's another part of you that just belongs to you.<eos> I don't think I have that part.<eos> Of course you do.
Harmon Kryger broke in an hour ago.<eos> He stole confidential information.<eos> I told you he was alive, that he reached out to Molly.<eos> That is it.<eos> That is all I know.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> What did Molly tell you this morning?<eos> You think she knew about this?<eos> Oh, I think it's possible you did, too. No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah, you really know your capitals.<eos> - Yeah, I do, thanks.<eos> - This is crazy. I live right here, you know.<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, I guess we have to hang out because obviously the universe wants us to!<eos> - Yeah, maybe... - You should put a little... tour of Stockholm inside of me... for me.<eos> Today, if you have the time.<eos> I do, before my... my b... my major show.
Of course.<eos> Ready when you are, Captain. Good.<eos> Then we won't waste time on pleasantries.<eos> I'm sure the name Fu'ad Hansur means something to you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Parsa gave up Hansur as his second in command during my interrogation.<eos> Hansur evaded our roundup, but today he showed his face.<eos> On behalf of the Brotherhood, he released a video claiming responsibility for the break.<eos> Thought you said he didn't have the funding to pull this off.<eos> They don't.
Look, I'm just doing a friend a favor.<eos> It's really not a big deal.<eos> What friend?<eos> What does Ida Bankowski have to do with anything?<eos> The Bankowski case is closed.<eos> Well, she's missing and my friend wants to find her, see if she's okay.<eos> When did the Roundhouse become your personal investigation resource?<eos> The intelligence officer who monitors that database reports to the commissioner every time he sees a red flag.<eos> Like why is a vice cop looking for investigative information on a homicide that's none of his business?<eos> Nothing to do with his caseload.
I only know what they said about it on the news.<eos> It does sound very familiar, though.<eos> You're running this one, aren't you?<eos> What happened to Robbie Lewis?<eos> If there's a connection to you, you know we'll find it.<eos> You'll find a connection whether one exists or not.<eos> Isn't that how it works?<eos> Next you'll be telling me I walked out of here and did it.<eos> ~ You know who did it, though, don't you?<eos> ~ Course I do.
In the middle of the night?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - The mom talking?<eos> - No. She says she had no idea about the weapons or the drugs, that her ex-husband must have hid them there.<eos> So three of the girls are under 18.<eos> They were all being held against their will, working for Tino.<eos> Okay, as for now, we got the mom on running an unregistered day-care center.<eos> Any chance Tino's girls testify?<eos> The lives they've lived, they think Tino is looking out for them.<eos> - Ellie doesn't.
I hope that's true.<eos> We'll sit by the fire, with all our children around us, and I'll make certain that you are safe.<eos> I wonder.<eos> We both want it so much, but do you believe it'll really happen?<eos> With all my heart.<eos> Actually, I'm not sure about having children 'all around us'.<eos> How many are you planning on, Mr Bates?<eos> You nearly missed me.<eos> You never told me you were going.<eos> Who did?
My sister wrote you a letter? She's an atheist, Charlie.<eos> It's not for me, Daniel.<eos> You know, the last three times she's come to visit, you made her sit in that cold, gray visiting room, phone in her hand, waiting for a brother that never shows.<eos> I'm a ghost, Charlie.<eos> The sooner they learn that, the better off they'll be.<eos> Or the better off you'll be?<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> Play some goddamn music.<eos> No, I'd rather talk.<eos> We hardly do any of that.
We just sat there by her bed hoping she was asleep.<eos> But she wasn't.<eos> And we knew it.<eos> In the end I had to call grandmother.<eos> Come here, little darling.<eos> Why do we say such stupid things to each other?<eos> Because you forget to think.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> And your mum knows that you didn't mean it.<eos> She does?
But she wasn't.<eos> And we knew it.<eos> In the end I had to call grandmother.<eos> Come here, little darling.<eos> Why do we say such stupid things to each other?<eos> Because you forget to think.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> And your mum knows that you didn't mean it.<eos> She does?<eos> - Yes, she does.

Well, you could have conveyed your respects just now.<eos> I'm afraid the service is ended.<eos> I was hoping to speak to more than just a few of the die-hard faithful.<eos> Where's the rest of your flock got to?<eos> - Paris, France? - Yeah.<eos> Ooh, you don't want to go and live there.<eos> They never bathe.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I heard they don't have showers in their houses.<eos> Of course they do.
Which is good because I'm here and they're not.<eos> Anyway, enough about me.<eos> Phillip says so little about you.<eos> Well, he knows how much I hate it when he brags about me.<eos> No, I'm just your average "Vogue" editor with degrees in Art History and Marketing from Oxford.<eos> Okay, anyone else need a drink? No, just me?<eos> All right.<eos> I'm sorry. Do I have "hate me" written on my forehead?<eos> She doesn't hate you.<eos> And if she does, so what?
Okay, folks.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> So, I'd like to call on Emma's two amazing godfathers.<eos> - Ready to go, dude.<eos> - We're on it.<eos> Her one incredible godmother.<eos> That's me.<eos> Her two one-of-a-kind grandparents.<eos> - Oh, we love you.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Trent's the new deputy D.A. Got here six months ago.<eos> - Charms all the judges' panties off.<eos> - Yeah, that's in his skill set.<eos> Yeah, and if you leave now, all of your clients get thrown back in that punch bowl until they're reassigned council, which could take days, or weeks.<eos> So maybe do us a solid and finish out the day.<eos> You are one spirited little lesbian.<eos> - Who said I'm a lesbian?<eos> - No one.<eos> Not... no, not me.<eos> Not anyone. No one did.
I kissed Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> I just wanted to feel normal for a minute.<eos> Melanie, you are normal.<eos> I died.<eos> Nothing about me is normal.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> And no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.
Louie.<eos> Do you know what the meanest thing is you can say to a fat girl?<eos> "You're not fat."<eos> I mean, come on, buddy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It just sucks.<eos> Oh, it really, really sucks.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> And the worst part is, I'm not even supposed to do this.<eos> Do what?
So how was it?<eos> Did anything go wrong?<eos> No, no, no. Everything was cool.<eos> I mean, there was one weird moment.<eos> Somebody started crying, right?<eos> Somebody always starts crying.<eos> You didn't start crying, did you?<eos> Nobody cried.<eos> But every time I looked at Jenna, she was staring at me with this super intense look. Like she really wanted me or something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
It's never going to make it.<eos> Not enough gold.<eos> It'll never make it into orbit.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where did it go?<eos> Where did what go?<eos> The golden arrow!<eos> Tuck!<eos> You took it?<eos> Of course we did.
Quite good. I set myself rather a difficult task, and it's always a relief when it's done, isn't it?<eos> - How are your lessons going?<eos> - What's this?<eos> Miss Bunting is giving instruction to Mrs Patmore's undercook.<eos> Oh, yes. I heard about that.<eos> You sound as if you don't approve.<eos> I approve. As long as you're not making... her unsettled.<eos> You don't know her name, do you?<eos> Sarah, please.<eos> Of course he does. Daisy.
We're not stopping.<eos> Uh, we're stopped.<eos> Let's go We're gonna go.<eos> I will not lie down.<eos> Abraham.<eos> Abraham, let's get out of here.<eos> I will not give up the ship.<eos> Hold up.<eos> - We gotta go.<eos> No, we don't.
Did you?<eos> I'm tryin'.<eos> Why don't you say what's really on your mind?<eos> I don't think we get to save people anymore.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I'm tryin'.<eos> When we were out by the car... what if I didn't show up?<eos> I still don't know.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You don't.
Thank you.<eos> That car was headed downtown.<eos> I say we get up in one of the tall ones, get ourselves a view, see what we see.<eos> We can stay close to the buildings and keep quiet, but sooner or later, we're gonna be drawing 'em.<eos> All right, we can get up there.<eos> There's a bridge.<eos> Some days, I don't know what the hell to think.<eos> Good thing we skipped breakfast.<eos> How did we get here?<eos> We just did.
They know we're all involved.<eos> If they knew anything, then we'd all be under arrest right now.<eos> All we have to do is say that Donnie went out last night, alone.<eos> You want to throw Donnie under the bus?<eos> I want to make sure we salvage some piece of this family.<eos> Their alibi's cooked. Oh, yeah.<eos> And Donnie definitely got the guns.<eos> Mm-hmm. Agreed.<eos> But I don't think they killed for the property. - You don't think so?<eos> - I don't.
Or is there any way that I could, like...?<eos> Bail hearings are about people.<eos> If you want the judge to grant bail, you need to prove to him that your client is an honorable person.<eos> Right.<eos> Bring out his family -- preferably daughters.<eos> The judge has three girls.<eos> Henry doesn't have any family.<eos> That's bad.<eos> So you gotta spin some bullshit about how Henry's got ties to the community.<eos> He does.
The metaphorical way can end up hurting just as bad, though.<eos> But it would bleed less.<eos> I'm not authorized to prescribe medication.<eos> Something that might make life a little easier.<eos> At least easier than picking fights with cert teams.<eos> But if an inmate makes the request himself... then I'm required to run their request up the flagpole.<eos> Feel-good drugs?<eos> Feel-less-bad drugs, maybe.<eos> You get what I'm saying?<eos> I do.
I was hoping to give him the welcome-home speech.<eos> So I knocked on at this house where I know he's been dossing.<eos> No answer, but I had reason to believe, so I accessed the property via ways and means and...<eos> ..I found blood in the cellar, a chair covered in gaffer tape, like somebody'd been tied to it, a pair of knickers on the floor, so that and knowing what a charming young man Tommy Lee Royce is, makes me want to get a CSI -<eos> SOCO, CSI, whatever we're calling them this week - get one of them in there to take a few swabs, a few photos<eos> -and find out what's going on. OK.<eos> -What, so that's...<eos> -Yep.<eos> Did you go to the H-MIT briefing in Halifax this morning?<eos> I did, yes.
Soon.<eos> Now.<eos> What's it to do with?<eos> Put your head between your knees.<eos> Right...<eos> The thing is, Nevison...<eos> The thing is... I may be wrong...<eos> I may be wrong, but the thing is... ..I think I might know who these people are.<eos> -Did you see anything? -No. No.<eos> I-I didn't.
-How much?<eos> -100.<eos> Two.<eos> Two quid? OK.<eos> You're cheap.<eos> -Still, we knew that.<eos> -200.<eos> -Whatever.<eos> -I should've said three.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't.
Yes, both, I guess.<eos> So if I believe there is no God, then there is no God.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause you're just lost, Daniel.<eos> Something we can agree upon.<eos> I know God loves you, Daniel.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Or was it Jesus who loved me?<eos> They both do.
There's something called 'chemi' (chemistry) between people. Chemi... it's short for something.<eos> Anyway, it means chemical reactions.<eos> But I'm full of chemicals.<eos> All men go crazy when they see me.<eos> They get on fire.<eos> Do I have no chemistry with women? No!<eos> All women burn with jealousy when they see me.<eos> In another words, I'm a charm full of jealousy. Femme fatale.<eos> If you're not drunk, then you should go see a shrink.<eos> I already did.
I shouldn't have asked for it.<eos> I can get out on my own feet.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Stay sitting.<eos> I'll bring it to you.<eos> Isn't there anything I can help you with?<eos> It's all done.<eos> Not that.<eos> About your abilities not working.<eos> It...did work.
- Glad you're here.<eos> Hey, can you talk to these girls for me? Why?<eos> 'Cause they're boring the shit out of me.<eos> - How's it going out there?<eos> - Good.<eos> I think we're making some real progress.<eos> - Okay. Good.<eos> Hey, ladies, welcome to my intervention.<eos> - Hi, Todd.<eos> How you doing, Todd?
We got him!<eos> We got him!<eos> No! Beckett, stop!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Beckett: Gary duffin.<eos> You're no stranger to rooms like this.<eos> But this time it's different.<eos> This time, your only option is to give me answers.<eos> And what if I don't?
Maybe you were better off alone.<eos> Maybe we all are, Dr. Miller.<eos> Well, there's a lot of names in the hopper.<eos> Erase-on Manor.<eos> Thornehill.<eos> The Ross Supremacy.<eos> Emily's still taking pictures, but as far as the party signage goes, a "Happy Memorial Day" will do.<eos> The house doesn't need a name, Nolan.<eos> Says the girl who doesn't know which one to use for herself.<eos> I do.
He's always right.<eos> Whatever. It's better than that crap you cooked up in Budapest.<eos> I didn't have much to work with. It was farm-to-table.<eos> - It broke my tooth.<eos> - That's 'cause you're English.<eos> Hartley, Hunter, Idaho.<eos> - What's the word?<eos> - In his office.<eos> - Director requests an audience.<eos> - No, the man doesn't do requests.
You're 40!<eos> Okay. That's enough.<eos> Luke, why don't you go water our garden.<eos> Haley, just disappear for a minute.<eos> Well, it's not like you could help with that.<eos> Abracad-ouch.<eos> Well, it's great having Alex home, huh?<eos> So great.<eos> You don't think that she's the reason why we --<eos> No. No, I do not.
Excessive?<eos> Really?<eos> Struck by cupid's magic arrow.<eos> It's off, Lily.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Two hours rehearsing with Rosa?<eos> Cam, what is going on with you?<eos> We just had the most romantic year ever, planning our ceremony, the wedding, the honeymoon, and I'm just worried if we let this go, we'll never get it back.<eos> Well, that doesn't all just end.<eos> It did once.
Well, shit.<eos> I think I just heard a bell ring.<eos> Word with you outside, Chief?<eos> Something tells me you're about to get some excellent advice.<eos> Fuck are you doin'?<eos> What? I signed up for this little adventure under the countenance of strong and decisive leadership, but now, lo and behold, that leader is now gone, and the man currently residing in his skin clearly has no fuckin' idea what is happening in there.<eos> When we did this last night... what did I say I wanted?<eos> You said it was time to end it.<eos> I don't want to hurt her.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
It's an honor to meet you, son.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> So, you were in Afghanistan?<eos> Seals, right?<eos> That's correct, sir.<eos> Vietnam.<eos> Third marine division.<eos> I'll get your bags for you.<eos> Justine said you're looking for a place to stay.<eos> - She did?
Correct.<eos> You pre-med?<eos> I'm hoping to be.<eos> I'll check back in a couple hours.<eos> I don't care what his maximum is, okay?<eos> I will cover whatever you wont!<eos> I don't know, but I would imagine a few more weeks in the hospital and some kind of physical therapy at home.<eos> Honey, the S.A.T. is today.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
What?<eos> Don't you think that's beautiful? They don't see color.<eos> No.<eos> I think they need to be tested.<eos> But when I say it, I'm wrong.<eos> I made the team! Whoo!<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> - That's so exciting!<eos> - Of course you did. - Yes!
That's...<eos> I'll do anything to be a good friend.<eos> Except take a bath with me.<eos> You are very close to my face right now.<eos> Hey, what's that I smell, huh?<eos> What's that I smell?<eos> Is that fear?<eos> Is that vengeance?<eos> Is that that special cologne I told you never to use of mine?<eos> I just did one spritz.
I never said anything about a him.<eos> Where'd you find this guy anyway?<eos> Spraying cologne at the Beverly Center?<eos> Actually, he has a master's in child development, and he's the oldest of seven siblings, so he has plenty of experience.<eos> He's perfect.<eos> Yeah, well, I can see why you think he's perfect.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I just want what's best for our son.<eos> Who wants to meet the tickle monster?<eos> I do!
He's not in his room. He better not be in his room.<eos> If he's there then there's trouble.<eos> We were just knocking on his door.<eos> Are you sure you had the right room?<eos> - Look, right here?<eos> - You're sure he's in here?<eos> Well, he promised me he would tell me if he went anywhere.<eos> I don't know where else he would be.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Okay, we already did this.
I was just kidding.<eos> I was just...<eos> - "Kidding"?<eos> - Yeah, bro.<eos> You fucking asshole!<eos> That's not funny!<eos> I wanted to see if daddy fucking loved me.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - Do you fucking love me?<eos> - Yes, you do, you little bastard.
Gonna get back to it. [Chuckles] Zoey, I did not bring you to work for you to sit around the table and take selfies all day.<eos> There's a time and a place to be irresponsible...<eos> Jury duty, local elections, and parent-teacher conferences.<eos> But your father's place of business...<eos> Dad, I am working.<eos> I'm showing girls how to put on makeup.<eos> Oh...<eos> See? "Makeup by Zo-Zo"?<eos> I don't use bronzer because I have good skin.<eos> But my third best friend, Michelle, doesn't.
'Cause it's hilarious.<eos> See, man, now he's gonna think all those messed-up stereotypes about black folks are true.<eos> Man, he'll never stop asking me if I know Jay-Z.<eos> But don't you know Jay-Z?<eos> A little bit. But that's beside the point.<eos> Man, look.<eos> All black people don't know one another.<eos> Do you know Rupaul?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I do, actually.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to be in Indianapolis. - Why?<eos> - Because we're presenting to Burger Chef<eos> I know the astronauts may not make it, and then what are we gonna say?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - They're going to be fine.<eos> - It's not fair!<eos> You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
If she went into witness protection, she was gonna send me a postcard, and she never did.<eos> No, missy.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Asking if you were all in... that was wrong.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I really, really do.
He won't do it, we'll get someone else.<eos> No one will fucking touch it now, Mickey.<eos> You went to his house.<eos> What would I have seen if I had taken pictures of you, Ray?<eos> How many fucking women would there be?<eos> I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they?<eos> Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> Yes, you do.
Get Peter and the kids rounded up, too.<eos> That's what they want, they want the four of you.<eos> No, Dad, they want all the generations.<eos> Why are you being so modest?<eos> Yes!<eos> I look like shit!<eos> You really don't.<eos> Come on. I don't want my fucking photo taken!<eos> All right?<eos> I just don't.
and you said, "no, technology just opened the world up.<eos> I'm embracing it."<eos> I was stoned.<eos> You were fearless.<eos> Remember years ago when the university set up e-mail accounts for everybody?<eos> The first time I opened my in-box, I had six messages.<eos> I was convinced that they were encrypted communiqués from government agents.<eos> I freaked out and turned the damn thing off.<eos> I guess I never understood why computers scared you so much.<eos> Yeah, well... now you do.
Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.<eos> I'm asking you. Go home.<eos> I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.<eos> If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> You have everything in the world!<eos> Can't you just find it in your heart?<eos> Yeah, I have an intruder on my property.<eos> Yes, I will.
I don't want to be me.<eos> Can I be someone else?<eos> No. You have to be you, okay?<eos> All of you are yourselves,<eos> - except for Dee.<eos> - Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Are you right-handed, or left-handed?<eos> - That won't come up.<eos> - Well, it could come up.<eos> - It won't!
I mean, the codes on the doors change weekly, but...<eos> I can get them.<eos> My mom's office.<eos> - What if someone sees you?<eos> - What if Lucas sees you?<eos> Can we not go there right now?<eos> Tomorrow night is the weekly staff meeting.<eos> The entire Radley crew is held hostage in a room for an hour and told to smile more.<eos> Even if no one in the hotel sees her the security cameras will.<eos> No, they won't.
Yeah.<eos> We have to talk before Taylor comes in.<eos> He said you got a man killed.<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> He came in the office, and Dockery's guy thought it was a robbery.<eos> Stuck a knife in him.<eos> Dockery took the body.<eos> What happens if somebody comes looking for him?<eos> They won't.
It's not safe for a Shadowhunter to be at the DuMort right now.<eos> Especially one looking for vampire venom.<eos> Raphael, I think... if I can have a small bite, over time I can have less and less.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well... we can manage it... together.<eos> You really should go.<eos> Wait.<eos> OK. What... what do you want from me?<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll...
I made sure to set aside a successful batch.<eos> This place gives me the creeps.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's concentrated.<eos> Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> OSWALD: Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> MOONEY: Oh, he will.
What happens now?<eos> With Savitar?<eos> Iris didn't die.<eos> So that changes things, right?<eos> I mean, since Iris didn't die, future me never goes down that same dark path. I never create time remnants to fight Savitar.<eos> And if future you never creates these time remnants, then Savitar himself is never born.<eos> Precisely.<eos> But I saw him. He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
Sara's husband's downstairs, he says he has something I need to see.<eos> Mr Mahmoud?<eos> She told me that your victim died on 8th May, 1990.<eos> Yes.<eos> A ticket stub to see Roma play Lazio and a photo of her in a cafe in Rome... .. date stamped on the 8th.<eos> On the 9th, a train ticket to Naples and a photo of her... inside a bar in Naples, date stamped on the 9th.<eos> On the 10th, restaurant receipts in Naples, and on the 11th, a new inter-railing card, stamped and dated with her photo in Naples.<eos> I'm taking my wife home now.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> .. and I always will.
Parts arrived disassembled.<eos> Bed rails, Brass headboard rods, Various hardware.<eos> A rifle?<eos> A little prototype I rigged up.<eos> We can buy guns from as far away as europe.<eos> Yankee inspectors will never know.<eos> Green, that's a pretty good ruse.<eos> Guess signing that oath wasn't such a bad idea, after all.<eos> What's your father know of this?<eos> Not a word, and he won't.
You don't understand.<eos> I don't understand what?<eos> That you abandoned him?<eos> That you abandoned him and everybody else?<eos> - You made a promise!<eos> - That I couldn't keep!<eos> Not after everything I lost.<eos> I was just as broken as Joe was!<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - You will!
It's been a hell of a ride.<eos> Put my girl out first.<eos> Then promise me you'll keep your grubby paws off her soul... permanently.<eos> Done.<eos> Your move, Damon.<eos> Damon, don't.<eos> See you in hell, Cade.<eos> No, Damon.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
I should never have left them. I...<eos> Have you heard anything?<eos> All my law enforcement contacts are retired or... Dead.<eos> I'm trying, but...<eos> You?<eos> I keep telling myself they're fine.<eos> They've only been gone...<eos> 6 weeks, 2 days, and 10 hours.<eos> We'll find them, castiel.<eos> We will.
It's you.<eos> Me?<eos> That's...<eos> I... I am not someone that you should put your faith in, Kelly.<eos> I couldn't kill Dagon back there. I lost two of my men. I betrayed my friends, my family.<eos> Before all this happened, I was a cut-rate political flack in an embarrassingly unprofessional relationship with my boss.<eos> I don't know why it's me. And I don't know why it's you. But I know that we are destined for something here.<eos> Something great.<eos> Well, I wish I had your faith.<eos> You will.
I am not a criminal.<eos> Thank you, Jafar.<eos> Now it looks like we're prosecuting a damn hero.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> I don't have videos like that on my cell phone. Do you?<eos> Danny Nasiri had a good life, a loving family.<eos> I don't believe a kid like that would self-radicalize.<eos> Why do people from Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee burn down their own neighborhoods?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.
Brawling in front of staff, intoxicated, fighting like common children.<eos> Don't smirk.<eos> Don't feed the dog at the table.<eos> You're supposed to be men now, please live up to your responsibilities.<eos> I didn't mean to take it out on you.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have stuck up for you more.<eos> All those years.<eos> I've decided to apply to the War Office, to do my bit.<eos> They probably won't accept me but...<eos> Of course they will, Toby.
I went for the phone. I got tangled up in the sheets.<eos> Fell out of bed, put my hand out to break my fall.<eos> Yeah, well, you've definitely broken something.<eos> I'll need an X-ray to confirm. But look at the bright side, you got a hell of a story to tell about your honeymoon.<eos> Oh, uh, we're not married.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Just assumed. Wild nights, dinners in bed, you know, thought you were newlyweds.<eos> - We're kind of the opposite, actually.<eos> - Uh-huh. We don't even know each other's name.<eos> And we never will.
Come on, now, they're all waiting.<eos> No, Mom!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, it's all right.<eos> If you don't love Kevin yet, you will.<eos> We all will.
No.<eos> Isn't he dead?<eos> Is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you. - Oh?<eos> The Baudelaire children will be destroyed,<eos> - and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats! You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.
Yeah.<eos> We should think of, like, a bonding thing - we could all do together.<eos> - Yeah. Uh, there's this bar he really likes going to.<eos> Okay, maybe we could all go there after work?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> Oh, we're gonna be besties.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's Josh?<eos> Uh, he'll probably here really soon.
Look, I didn't show you that to scare you, okay?<eos> A serious action doesn't come without its risks.<eos> Look, I'm not saying that something like this is gonna happen tomorrow, but you never know.<eos> Look, I don't know about you all, but I am tired of feeling small.<eos> I am tired of watching everything around me fade and die because of a bunch of rich outsiders pretending that I don't exist.<eos> They pollute our air, they make us sick, they promise us jobs that never come.<eos> I am done begging for scraps at my own table and I know that you are, too.<eos> The parade is our chance to show them who we are.<eos> How angry we are.<eos> And tomorrow... we will.
It's embarrassing.<eos> Can we not talk about it?<eos> You got to talk to somebody.<eos> I've got a psych degree, I know the drill.<eos> How did you know I'd be here?<eos> 'Cause I know you.<eos> You don't run away.<eos> But you can't just pretend everything's fine.<eos> It was a weak moment, it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Men understand violence.<eos> They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.<eos> Women don't fear pain the way men do.<eos> They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
When Banneker refused it, I followed him into his workshop.<eos> What I beheld inside was a chamber of wonders.<eos> These plans are... magnificent.<eos> Do I see signs of the Hermetic code?<eos> An apostle of the square, level and plumb, are we?<eos> I am a Freemason, yes.<eos> This city.<eos> This does not exist, does it?<eos> No.<eos> But it will.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> I got the chance to start over again.<eos> Now, you will too.
Um, Sutton Brady, where are you?<eos> Are you with a dude?<eos> No, I'm still at the office.<eos> Ah, that's Lauren's phone ringing right now.<eos> I got to go get it. I'm sorry.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Liar.<eos> I hope your friends back home appreciate the contraband.<eos> They will.
American businessman Robert Miller.<eos> Where?<eos> That's the thing, just like last time, there are two crime scenes.<eos> Mexican authorities found his car at a parking lot just outside the dog track.<eos> That's probably where he was abducted.<eos> And the we found his body staged under a bridge in Tijuana.<eos> Clara, Simmons, see what you can find from the abduction site.<eos> Mae, you and Ryan come with me.<eos> No, I can't show my face out there.<eos> Then you won't.
Every time we think that, something bad happens.<eos> So what then?<eos> Stay here and die?<eos> Spend your last days wasted?<eos> That seems to be a popular choice with the people I care about.<eos> - Monty, I...<eos> - It'll be light out soon.<eos> That bunker gives us a chance for a future.<eos> I hope you'll change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You need to think about where your allegiance lies.<eos> No, I don't. Fine.<eos> You're clear about that.<eos> Let me be clear about this.<eos> You can't lie to me.<eos> You can't operate without my authority. Ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.
I-I wasn't trying.<eos> - Oh, it's fine.<eos> We're good, I've just got to be... somewhere else.<eos> - No.<eos> Actually, I'm not sorry.<eos> I care and I'm not going to apologize for that.<eos> - The boy's woke.<eos> Come find me later.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I'll...
Pour!<eos> - Hold her mouth open!<eos> - Pour it!<eos> Stop this!<eos> Eela, I feel your sorrow, but do not let your grief fuel your rage.<eos> - She deserves to die.<eos> - No, don't do this!<eos> Do you remember our troubles the last time an outsider was killed up here?<eos> Do you want those troubles to come back?<eos> Because they will...
All of the pop of the unquenchable mystical flame, but in projectile form.<eos> These should take out the Hessians.<eos> And so, what's the catch?<eos> These are all we've got.<eos> Make every shot count.<eos> Right, so, no pressure at all.<eos> Hey, you've got this.<eos> Trust me, I've seen what you can do.<eos> That's right, we got this.<eos> Yeah, we'll... just...
- Inside now.<eos> And I want you on your best behaviour.<eos> Go on.<eos> I could do with a drink.<eos> You're not the only one.<eos> You look wonderful.<eos> - Leonard!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> ..and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
You just have to believe in it.<eos> Speaking of love...<eos> Emma told me.<eos> Killian, I couldn't be happier for you... both of you.<eos> She has waited a long time to find the right person with whom to share her life.<eos> I'm so happy it's you.<eos> You'll let her know?<eos> Know... know what?<eos> That Regina's okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah. Of course... course I will.
Well, I've been there.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Oh, you're so tight.<eos> Oh, j-just stuff from work I can't really talk about.<eos> Can't you just be-- I don't know-- vague?<eos> I...<eos> I guess I was a little aggressive about this thing with my boss.<eos> I may have said a little too much.<eos> It'll work out.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Didn't you give me your word?<eos> Yes, but I didn't specify which word it was.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I can't let you take me back to Hope Valley.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what's your plan?<eos> You're just gonna take the evidence and ride off into the sunset, and hope that Wyatt doesn't come looking for you?<eos> Yeah. Sounds good to me.<eos> Too bad, 'cause it's not gonna work.<eos> Oh, it's gonna work all right.<eos> No, it won't.
I need to make music that feeds my soul.<eos> And my music don't.<eos> - You want what?<eos> - Simone's address.<eos> You're no better than anybody else in this house.<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You're not getting any information on a child in the system, even if she was your sister.<eos> You killed him!<eos> - What if they come looking for us?<eos> - They won't.
Take some money.<eos> I met a man, children.<eos> I still have a penis.<eos> I hope I don't let you down.<eos> I am a man.<eos> Say it!<eos> - Just trying to help.<eos> - Get out.<eos> What if they come looking for us?<eos> They won't, okay?
I can't look at anything... ever again.<eos> I'm still blind.<eos> Death is an increasing problem.<eos> With over a billion intelligent species active in this galaxy alone, it is an ever-greater challenge to know how to kill all of them.<eos> On this planet, we are proud to serve as executioners to every living thing.<eos> The destruction of a Time Lord, however, is a particular honour.<eos> This technology is precisely calibrated.<eos> As you can see, it will stop both hearts, all three brain stems, and deliver a cellular shock wave that will permanently disable regenerative ability.<eos> I know how it works.<eos> You certainly will in a moment.
A knife?<eos> A gun that shoots knives?<eos> - No!<eos> - Gabi!<eos> He's got a... gum!<eos> - Would you like a piece?<eos> - Oh, no, no thank you.<eos> Clearly, I hate gum.<eos> - I'll take some.<eos> - No, she won't!
Now, I know this is gonna go against everything you know about me, but...<eos> I am not a terrible dental assistant.<eos> I actually know what I'm doing now.<eos> But in the beginning, I was so overwhelmed.<eos> I would try to pass the instruments, and all I would hear Dr. Goodwin say is,<eos> "No, not that one... that one!"<eos> And all I hear the patients say is,<eos> "Ow! That's my tongue!"<eos> Okay, but, like, so, I find someone who's willing to hire me, then I show up on my first day, and... how will I know what I'm supposed to do?<eos> ! Oh, you won't.
Look like you needed it.<eos> You're keeping my daughter safe.<eos> It's the least I could do.<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> You don't need to worry.<eos> If I'm being honest, what worries me is NCIS solving the case.<eos> I know how horrible that sounds, but this is what's given Laura the strength to keep fighting. Uh...<eos> I'm not ready for what happens once she gets that closure.<eos> It's selfish, but, uh, I was hoping for more time with her.<eos> Well... you will.
We're not nobody.<eos> Okay?<eos> We-we... we fight.<eos> And I am not putting you in a nursing home.<eos> I am here for you.<eos> I know you are.<eos> But what happens when I'm not here for you anymore?<eos> Forgetting about your dad was bad enough.<eos> But what happens... when I forget who you are?<eos> You won't.
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.<eos> And then where is that gonna leave you?<eos> What prospects?<eos> It's too late.<eos> - You need to take a fall.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.<eos> In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway, and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
Your cure didn't work.<eos> - I found you another cure. - You did?<eos> - You have to explain.<eos> - I'm going to.<eos> The important thing is that it worked. You're alive.<eos> We're together again.<eos> - There is a cure that works. - It worked on you, at least.<eos> - I have to know what you did.<eos> - I'll tell you.<eos> - All of it. - You will, Vilma.
Man.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm gonna spend a little quality time with Nina tonight.<eos> - We need that.<eos> - Dude.<eos> I know.<eos> It's on me.<eos> I promise I'll get us tickets for next week.<eos> All right?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I will.
He's been in the ICU at St. Bede's for a week.<eos> Checked himself in with a 104-degree fever. He was delirious.<eos> Told the nurses his name was Lando Calrissian.<eos> That's why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's got a long recovery from meningitis ahead of him, but no prison time.<eos> How'd it go on your end?<eos> The night that Fred Kirby disappeared, nobody saw anything.<eos> So, a few people heard a loud bang around midnight. So, whatever happened here, maybe they finished it with a gun.<eos> Anybody find any slugs or casings?<eos> No, and they won't.
We're just trying to understand what's going on, - that's all.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Just lookin' out for ya, love.<eos> Bea would've hated seeing' you back on - on the gear.<eos> - Don't tell me what Bea would've hated!<eos> I fucking know better than any of you!<eos> - We're not saying you don't know, Al.<eos> - Then stop pointing the finger!<eos> I haven't forgotten her, okay.<eos> I never will.
News?<eos> The lab's just emailed the results.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> What's happening?<eos> - It was water.<eos> - What? Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.<eos> But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?<eos> Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?<eos> What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?<eos> - He won't.
The timing would be exquisite.<eos> Which cabinet ministers?<eos> Further details were not forthcoming.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There's always a camera.<eos> Be ready.<eos> Don't you post that anywhere.<eos> Please. Jaz won't see it.<eos> She's not on anything.<eos> Well, someone will.
- All we need is a ride.<eos> - I already said no.<eos> - Let me talk to your CO.<eos> - As far as you're concerned,<eos> I'm your final say on transport.<eos> So you're just gonna let him die?<eos> I'm sorry, Doc.<eos> It's outta my control.<eos> I'm just gonna get one of the villagers to give us a ride.<eos> - No, you will not. - You...
Because you're a fucking monkey who lies to himself about what turns him on.<eos> I'm not like that, and neither is Lola.<eos> Lola needs to be left alone.<eos> She deserves that, after what we've put her through.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You're going to go back to Claire.<eos> You're going to leave Lola alone.<eos> And you're going to do it today.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You will.
- You almost got us all killed.<eos> Ah, yeah.<eos> But then I saved everyone.<eos> You don't get credit for cleaning up you own mess.<eos> And you destroyed one of our Tugs.<eos> Uh, actually, sir.<eos> If anybody's to blame I...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
All right, we're about to boat race a bunch of those fucks from the University of Georgia up in the room.<eos> So...<eos> My God! University of Georgia! No way!<eos> You're a Hornet?<eos> Well, you guys should get in there then, Edward Jizzumhands.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> We will. Good, that's great.<eos> I'll see you up there. Good.<eos> Well, you say we'll be there and on time.<eos> Sweet. I will. -Yeah.
- Get out of town, everybody.<eos> There's just so many of them, we're outnumbered.<eos> What?<eos> How many?<eos> Oh, not that many.<eos> Just the right amount really.<eos> No need to look back. Just keep flying.<eos> FASTER!<eos> - I'll take that!<eos> - No, you won't!
Oh, Brandon, please.<eos> Brandon, please don't. Stop it.<eos> You're a piece of shit. Shut up, Matt.<eos> I mean it, Mr. Searless.<eos> Put the gun down or she's dead!<eos> Put it down!<eos> I'll fucking kill her! I swear to God.<eos> No, I'm just kidding.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> No, but seriously, I will.
Moana!<eos> You're so amazing!<eos> It's time.<eos> Go save the world.<eos> Cheeeehoooo!<eos> Maui!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Finding you a better way in!<eos> - We won't make it!<eos> - Yes, we will!
Who kidnaps a Scottish freelance photographer?<eos> The whole point of kidnapping is to get money, right?<eos> As far as I understand, Iain was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Can this half-assed country not even do kidnapping right?<eos> ISAF does not think this was an upper-tier organization.<eos> So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.
Doctor Fong just came by.<eos> And?<eos> He said they might have to shave my head.<eos> Well, Mom, that's okay.<eos> I don't want to do it, Johnny.<eos> Look ridiculous.<eos> Look like Rod Steiger.<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> No, you won't.
He's yours, to do whatever you think is right to...<eos> Sounds like a bribe.<eos> I haven't asked you for anything.<eos> Yet.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A simple exchange of information.<eos> Julie Mao was one of ours.<eos> I want to find out what happened to her just as much as you do.<eos> You think a man like Filat Kothari deserves to walk free?<eos> Because he will.
Will you always love me, Ali Khan?<eos> Yes.<eos> And will you stay with me, whatever happens, and take no other wives?<eos> Yes.<eos> Won't your father demand I become a Muslim?<eos> No.<eos> I've always wanted to go to Paris, more than anywhere in the world.<eos> I promise I will take you to Paris for our honeymoon.<eos> Now... will you marry me?<eos> I will.
Yes.<eos> And will you stay with me, whatever happens, and take no other wives?<eos> Yes.<eos> Won't your father demand I become a Muslim?<eos> No.<eos> I've always wanted to go to Paris, more than anywhere in the world.<eos> I promise I will take you to Paris for our honeymoon.<eos> Now... will you marry me?<eos> I will.<eos> I will, Ali.
It's a conversation.<eos> Tell me, can your little birds get a message to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?<eos> Of course.<eos> Men can be fickle, but birds I always trust.<eos> Your eye looks much better, Arthur.<eos> How's your mother's jaw?<eos> Better.<eos> And your father?<eos> No one's seen him.<eos> And no one will.
Use me to bargain with them.<eos> It worked the last time.<eos> With a lad.<eos> These are soldiers.<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> You in the church, if you have an Englishwoman in there, send her out now!<eos> Give up our hostage?<eos> Not likely.<eos> We'll rather...
He's given us a little free sample, you know.<eos> So, I'll have one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> There you go.<eos> I won't do it now.<eos> In fact, I think I'd better hide it.<eos> I don't want them finding this at the embassy.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> They won't.
You haven't got a job, you've never done anything, you're even missing teeth.<eos> And take that fucking brace off, there's nothing under it.<eos> Fuck you<eos> I let my woman leave to stay with you.<eos> Go back to her.<eos> It's time to go to bed, you've got school tomorrow.<eos> I'm not going back to that shitty school.<eos> What was that ?<eos> He'll be back.<eos> No, he won't.
I see we're playing outside the rules of the system, so why don't we go to Plan B?<eos> Here's a little something to change your mind.<eos> Do we have a deal, chancellor?<eos> No.<eos> You know what, fuck you!<eos> Unleash the hounds, sweetie.<eos> That's how you talk in front of your daughter?<eos> Oh, I think we know how to be parents.<eos> She's a baby, "A." She doesn't retain any of that shit.<eos> Well, yes she will.
Can you tell from what she suffers, Madam?<eos> Possibly.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> I suspected the cause straight away, but I took a moment to recall the 18th century term for diabetes.<eos> I believe she has... Sugar sickness.<eos> And can you tell whether she will recover?<eos> She won't.
It's an "it."<eos> Oh, you're wrong about that, Miss Weathers.<eos> She's smart.<eos> She's smarter than any of us.<eos> But that's not what makes Morgan special.<eos> There was joy in her heart... before we shoved her back in that box.<eos> You haven't met her?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You'll see.<eos> You will. You really will.
Better.<eos> Sometimes that's all it takes.<eos> Ramse taught me that.<eos> Yeah, well, now he needs your help.<eos> The 12 Monkeys... they put something in him, something that helps them find him.<eos> A tracker device.<eos> Sounds like them.<eos> We need you to cut it out.<eos> I don't want to get involved.<eos> - But you will.
I call lawyer.<eos> He gets here, you can ask questions.<eos> You're familiar with our legal system.<eos> American cops can't do shit.<eos> Your criminals don't know how easy they got it.<eos> _<eos> You wait outside 'til lawyer gets here.<eos> Hey, you know our system, you know it can take forever to resolve legal problems.<eos> Oh, I have no legal problems.<eos> - You will.
Radaga- - Radagast?<eos> Yeah. You may enter.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> So, guess what?<eos> I got off early and...<eos> Poltergeist.<eos> I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> As long as you don't have nightmares for a week.<eos> No, I won't.
Good boy.<eos> 'Cause you messed with the wrong motherfucker.<eos> No, wait. Please.<eos> Jonah, are you... There you are.<eos> Hi, Jonah.<eos> Well, as you can feel, or remember feeling, I've obviously put Rand into a great deal of pain.<eos> Now, he's not dead.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But that can change.<eos> And will.
- ... and put a body outside of that, too.<eos> What? What do you want?<eos> Lead on the Warren story.<eos> You know every major national media outlet is down here covering the story, right?<eos> So what the hell makes you think that she's gonna want to talk to a...<eos> I don't know, whatever the hell it is you do here.<eos> Lesbian lifestyle blog.<eos> We have a lesbian lifestyle blog?<eos> We do, and you're right.<eos> She won't.
Amy, what do you...<eos> Wait, what can I say? What do you...<eos> I'll give you $100,000. Not 20, 100.<eos> You don't have $100,000.<eos> You're right.<eos> I live with my mother.<eos> But this is gonna work, and when it does, I'll have much, much more.<eos> And I'll give you a million.<eos> - I don't want your money.<eos> - I really will.
What are you talking about?<eos> If I didn't say anything, you wouldn't have known about the show,<eos> - sh... she wouldn't have run away. - No.<eos> No.<eos> Listen to m...<eos> Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.
This is not the end of the story for you two.<eos> Sweetheart, this family... there's a whole lot of road up ahead of us.<eos> You two are gonna find your way back to each other.<eos> I want to believe that.<eos> I don't know how to get us there.<eos> You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Sweetie, you will, too.
But they didn't.<eos> And I realized the corruption in the NFL... that was just the beginning.<eos> I could do more.<eos> I had to.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> When did this happen, Drew?<eos> Chicago, right?<eos> October 17, 2014, at 6:31 p.m.<eos> I remember exactly.<eos> I always will.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> I am not a patient.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
If you're not strong enough, you will die.<eos> I take it back.<eos> That sounds level ten bad.<eos> Clary, you should know, the pain will be excruciating.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Walk through fire, battle demons, whatever it takes.<eos> I have to get my mom back.<eos> I can't... I won't lose her.<eos> You won't.<eos> We won't.
I wish it didn't have to end, not this way.<eos> It was never my intention to hurt you, but it's how it has to be.<eos> We have so much here... people, food, medicine, walls, everything we need to live.<eos> But what we have other people want, too, and that will never change.<eos> If we survive this threat and it's not over, another one will be back to take its place, to take what we have.<eos> I love you all here.<eos> I do.<eos> And I'd have to kill for you.<eos> And I can't.<eos> I won't.
Lots of people love each other.<eos> But you and Axe?<eos> Oh, that's something else.<eos> It's weird, and it's deep, and I fucking hate it.<eos> I do. I fucking hate it.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But you are strong because of it.<eos> You are stronger than him, and you will get through it.<eos> Because things are changing there, and it can't last like this much longer.<eos> It won't.
I'd have my memories of camp forever, but SCU was my future.<eos> Okay, you got me.<eos> I'm in.<eos> You sure?<eos> Beyond sure.<eos> It was my first big SCU event, and I was nervous and excited and distracted.<eos> Jenna, I'd like you to meet Peter and Kelly.<eos> This is the girlfriend we've been hearing so much about.<eos> Oh, don't believe all the hype.<eos> I won't.
Buckaroo Banzai!<eos> He's coming in! He's coming in!<eos> Keep all eyes on him.<eos> - What's he gonna do?<eos> - He's winging it, but I think he's gonna get himself killed.<eos> Now you know how I feel every time you do something stupid.<eos> - Bombs in a tornado?<eos> - It worked, didn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Maybe this will, too.
My first thought was,<eos> "I can never show her where I live."<eos> I suddenly became embarrassed by where I was from.<eos> Dre, your mother's fashion choices, beliefs, and personality aside... you had nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Plus, we put Junior in that school so that he could see a lot of different points of view.<eos> It doesn't mean he's gonna lose his own.<eos> You're right.<eos> But how's he gonna admire me?<eos> I don't have anything prehistoric to put my gum in.<eos> You will one day.
- How will this reassembling take place?<eos> - Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
All right, come on, come on!<eos> This way, this way, come on.<eos> Okay, this way. Keep going.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> Come on, come on, come on!<eos> Lydia, don't look at them, okay?<eos> Don't try to scream.<eos> They'll take you, too. Just do not look at them.<eos> I won't.
They still have got you locked up.<eos> Was somebody being a bad boy?<eos> You like the bad boys.<eos> We have a history.<eos> I thought we had a future once, but I gave him his chance and he refused, so now I just feel sorry for him.<eos> Damn it, Fitz.<eos> Your friends are very persistent.<eos> They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time.<eos> If it happens again, there'll be no absolution.<eos> It won't.
- Me too.<eos> I was abandoned by my parents when I was just three years old.<eos> Children are so lovely when they are three years of age.<eos> How can anyone abandon a three year old?<eos> Where do you find the nerve?<eos> I never knew you were an orphan, too.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> - Does Lenny know?<eos> - No.<eos> And he never will.
Sure... sure, why not?<eos> I could, uh, come by later this morning.<eos> That will be perfect, Norman.<eos> And you should bring whatever outfit you would like us to put her in.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are... are you there, Norman?<eos> - Yes, I'm here. - I'll...<eos> I'll bring it.<eos> And will, uh, the sheriff, your stepfather, be joining us as well?<eos> No... no, he will not.
Go, go, go!<eos> Shoot that son of a bitch!<eos> - We got him! Come on!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Get down here!<eos> - One batch, two batch.<eos> Penny and dime.<eos> They're gonna pay.<eos> Every single goddamn one of 'em.<eos> They will.
- your part of the bargain.<eos> - Take a look out of the window.<eos> You will see my part of the bargain.<eos> In return, he has given me nothing.<eos> The Master gave you the white, which is why you're still alive.<eos> - And how you repay him, by plotting and scheming to betray him.<eos> But it ends here.<eos> Then your Master will never get the nuke.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> He will.
How could I have missed this?<eos> I've seen it 100 times.<eos> You were focused on your friends.<eos> But I'm supposed to meet Lommers soon.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> We owe them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Let's make her pay.<eos> We will.
He has defiled France.<eos> Appointing a commoner as regent.<eos> - Treville!<eos> - Your brother was not a fool.<eos> A Spanish queen is hard to love, but Treville is a hero to the people.<eos> We take Paris immediately.<eos> There's nothing to stop us.<eos> Will they love you, cousin?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Of course they will!
All my assets will be frozen until it's resolved.<eos> That includes the new restaurant.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, so... The plan to start construction next week, is that...?<eos> It will be put on hold.<eos> Unfortunately, your salary will be deferred, and your 20% investment is also frozen.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I mean you do realize that I put my entire future in your hands.<eos> - If this doesn't work out...<eos> - It will.
Here.<eos> I'm working at West Auckland colliery these days.<eos> Stopping at Johnson Terrace.<eos> Landlady by the name of Mrs Shaw.<eos> I'll not be a coalminer's lass for as long as I live.<eos> There's not a woman alive, but she wants better than that.<eos> I will love her children as my own.<eos> I will be a mother to them all.<eos> Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health, and forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?<eos> I will.
Are there roads?<eos> Can we drive?<eos> There is one road, but it's crawling with bandits.<eos> Follow me, please, gentlemen.<eos> This is my sundries closet.<eos> You'll find all the knowledge and supplies that you'll need for your journey.<eos> Pull this off and you're homeward bound.<eos> Look, you said it was a day's hike.<eos> Why would we need all this shit?<eos> Maybe you won't.
Yeah, unless you don't pass the next test, which is blowing up my DHS office.<eos> But I won't do it. You know I can't.<eos> I know, but what are we gonna do?<eos> You know, maybe it's about time we started using a little leverage ourselves.<eos> Look, Agent Dylan's been trying to take down Braxton for years, right?<eos> That's why he's trying to kill her by blowing up your office.<eos> And setting you up to take the fall.<eos> You think you have enough proof to build a case against him?<eos> Maybe. But DHS isn't gonna believe anything I found.<eos> Yeah, but maybe he will.
- Hey... you're with me! Come on, let's go! Keller's been spotted!<eos> Sure taking them long enough to spot me. Yeah.<eos> Your tax dollars at work.<eos> Don't worry, they'll find you.<eos> They better.<eos> You at Graydal?<eos> Ready and waiting.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Hey, don't forget about the guard just in the tunnel entrance, okay?<eos> I won't.
D.P.S. found her by the oil fields near Beaumont.<eos> - Erratic, hostile, no ID. - (female screaming in the background)<eos> We couldn't identify her - through collateral contacts.<eos> - (glass breaking)<eos> - Psychosis is pretty elaborate.<eos> - Very. Mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics had no effect.<eos> - This one will.
- I can't do that.<eos> - yes, you can.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'm not- come the fuck on, bryna.<eos> - I am not a doctor!<eos> And I'm not going to get in trouble for violating hospital rules.<eos> God, what a baby.<eos> You are so ungrateful.<eos> Oh, go fuck yourself.<eos> I will.
'With a second girl taken, questions are, inevitably, 'being asked of the police.<eos> 'How could this be allowed to happen again?<eos> 'Just days after Ivy Moxam managed to escape captivity 'and reunite with her family.'<eos> What are you up to?<eos> I can't find my phone.<eos> It's plugged in by your side of the bed, where it always is.<eos> My brain's crying out for the morning coffee.<eos> Over this way, Mr Tarl.<eos> We'll find her, Ivy.<eos> We will.
It would to me.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> Just come with me. - You can't make it...<eos> - I'm just gonna go home.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> You shouldn't go.<eos> But I can't stop you.<eos> They'll see you.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
Come on.<eos> ...in the house of this man, 54-year-old US postal worker Vance Otlow.<eos> - Look at this guy.<eos> - Otlow had grown more erratic following post office closures last year by the Meyer Postal Commission.<eos> 10,000 ballots!<eos> From a district with an empirically high applied demography value.<eos> I don't know what you're saying, but you keep doing that math stuff, Kent, no matter how much anyone makes fun of you, okay?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> All right, listen. Karen has got to get those ballots admitted, right?<eos> She will or she won't.
- I'll draw up the paperwork.<eos> Speaking of paper, Piper Perabo and Pauley Perrette need to push back the pitch on the Princess and the Pauper project.<eos> - You have a night off tonight.<eos> - A night off? - When's the last time that happened?<eos> - It hasn't.<eos> - Can I help you with anything else?<eos> - Get me a date for tonight. Make that three dates.<eos> Who knows when I'll get another night off?<eos> I do.<eos> And you won't.
Why stir up trouble?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Sorry to be late.<eos> I went to the Russian bakery to get those little black-and-white cookies that you love.<eos> The lady in front of me bought the last ones.<eos> Oh, no. It worked out, 'cause, apparently, she was buying 'em for you.<eos> Who wants a cookie?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Ooh, I'll have a cookie.<eos> No, I won't.
Take it easy. I'm just agreeing with you.<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> You okay, Ma?<eos> Oh yeah, what the hell are you doing in here?<eos> Well, I heard a crash.<eos> Suction on the shower caddy gave out.<eos> Well, we both had a good run.<eos> All right, thank God.<eos> Look, don't move, I'll get it.<eos> Oh, the hell you will.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you, too.<eos> How was your trip? Wonderful.<eos> And the pilot did such a good job,<eos> I gave him a butterscotch.<eos> (laughs) That's great.<eos> And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot.<eos> You know, I don't even get to sit there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you never will.
- What are you looking for?<eos> - Calls that Mia made at those times.<eos> - What for?<eos> - We can triangulate her location.<eos> The technicians can check it out tomorrow.<eos> - You want to do it now?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> Again?<eos> What should I say if they wake up?<eos> They won't.
- Really, now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're signing the papers, let's go.<eos> I don't know, Alex, I think maybe we should...<eos> Hey, slouchy, little help here.<eos> We don't have a minute to waste, Millicent.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> All right, if you want to, y-you go ahead.<eos> I'll just...
I haven't made her uncomfortable. She doesn't understand what we're saying.<eos> Nobody here has any idea what we're saying.<eos> Well, here's to our one-year anniversary of chasing red pins around the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One year of complete and total... failure.<eos> Hey, it's not complete failure.<eos> While we have not solved your scar situation yet, we have discovered an astonishing variety of tropical alcohols.<eos> I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope, he never will.
Stefan, no.<eos> Hey, Stefan.<eos> We can bring him back.<eos> We've done it before.<eos> Where's the damn sword?<eos> Where's the sword?<eos> That was an amazing escape.<eos> I take back all my insults about your driving.<eos> She'll follow us.<eos> Of course she will.
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Oh, this is fun, ain't it?<eos> Go ahead, Shakespeare.<eos> Don't they use guns for this?<eos> Yeah, that's how the chicken-shits do it.<eos> Special bullet melts the brain nice and neat, but we wanted to see if you were one of us, you know, struggling in the dirt.<eos> Go on, now.<eos> Show us what you got, yankee.<eos> You're gonna like it.<eos> You'll... you'll...
You feel you just want to get away, but often, after a loss, it can be very beneficial to stay and...<eos> Grieve?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're the clever doctor, aren't you?<eos> Knows what's best for us.<eos> Understands our minds.<eos> - I'm sorry I couldn't save him.<eos> - So am I.<eos> The cottage will still be here if you want to come back.<eos> We won't.
I am soldado de la musica.<eos> Soldado de la musica.<eos> Muy soldado.<eos> So sensitive.<eos> Of course, I had a soft spot for singers, too.<eos> And if I can tell you one thing, they're all crazy.<eos> And you know, I- - I've never--<eos> I've never been with a, you know, close to a-- to a singer.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Maybe you never will.
He's gonna continue with therapy like three times a week, so it's a lot.<eos> And he... he's on meds for his blackouts.<eos> I think he's doing much better. All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, I guess you just... you have to do what you have to do.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Romero still there?<eos> He moved out.<eos> You... you haven't told Norman about him yet.<eos> I will, honey.
look, I'm not saying I'm blameless.<eos> It's far from it.<eos> I have made many mistakes, but that doesn't mean there isn't love in it.<eos> I love you... and Jenny and Howie.<eos> And I did love your mother.<eos> I still do.<eos> But not in that way.<eos> No.<eos> So the good news is, you don't have to stay here because you're worried about me.<eos> I won't, then.
And what about that Emma girl, what's happening there?<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> Well, that's... good... isn't it?<eos> If you love her.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> Oh, she did a test?<eos> She didn't need to.<eos> She should have a test.<eos> Put it this way, buddy I'm not exactly going to be having kids of my own.<eos> Well, buddy for a somewhat different reason, I probably won't, either.
Most people call it cheating, don't they?<eos> Not me.<eos> I call it betrayal.<eos> I call it lying.<eos> And after years of apologies, and "I swear it will never happen agains,"<eos> I call it unforgivable.<eos> Does your daughter feel the same way?<eos> Children can't be used as weapons.<eos> So, Megan knew nothing about her father's infidelities.<eos> No, and she never will,
Have you asked him?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Still making sure IAC is my only option.<eos> Well, if it is, I just hope you know what you're doing to your career.<eos> I don't want this career.<eos> Want to be a tax lawyer now?<eos> Hadn't thought of that. That's a good idea.<eos> I never saw this kitchen finished.<eos> Neither did Daniel.<eos> Well, maybe he will one day.
You know why I didn't want to see you, Mother?<eos> Why I don't return your phone calls?<eos> 'Cause every time I look into your eyes, every time I... I hear your voice, I see and hear what I feel about myself.<eos> You are my confirmation.<eos> You have to let me go, Mother, because no matter how badly you feel or guilty or angry or sad or ashamed...<eos> I have never been ashamed of you, never.<eos> Or ashamed of yourself, then.<eos> It will not affect in any positive way what I am, or what I will be, and especially what I might have been.<eos> I can't abandon you, honey.<eos> I won't.
Jorge!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I stepped away for two minutes.<eos> I don't know how to stop him.<eos> _<eos> "I will."<eos> "I will have."<eos> "I would."<eos> "I would have."<eos> "I will not."
I stepped away for two minutes.<eos> I don't know how to stop him.<eos> _<eos> "I will."<eos> "I will have."<eos> "I would."<eos> "I would have."<eos> "I will not."<eos> "I... will not have."<eos> "I won't."
I got breakfast, come sit down.<eos> Look what the Mink came up with.<eos> I gotta find the bastards who beat me.<eos> Go talk to Acke.<eos> Yes, yes... I'll talk to Acke. The favors are starting to pile up.<eos> What does the Mink get out of this?<eos> You used to slip some cash once.<eos> Do I look like I got cash on me?<eos> Will you talk to him then?<eos> - - Of course I will.
Almost done.<eos> Don't want you losing your whole foot.<eos> Yeah, you just don't want to carry me.<eos> What makes you so sure that your friends are gonna meet you in Caraquet?<eos> Before I took off from the compound, I left a message on the roof.<eos> A message?<eos> Caraquet.<eos> I spelled it out in rocks.<eos> You think your friends are gonna be able to spot a town name that you wrote on a roof?<eos> Yeah, they will.
The rest of the crew will no doubt have a hard time... believing this.<eos> The rest of the crew is not who I'm worried about.<eos> Are you done?<eos> If you want to run a scan, I can give you the coordinates.<eos> I have no interest in either proving or disproving Your Lunatic Theory.<eos> I'm here for the drive.<eos> I'm sure you have someone on board Who'll be able to confirm it's genuine.<eos> I gave you the device.<eos> I held up my end of the deal.<eos> And so will I.
You want to read your confession before you sign it?<eos> Screw you!<eos> Now, Sergeant, I am offering you an opportunity here.<eos> I'm not owning up to this.<eos> You did this.<eos> Yeah, but I used your gun to shoot private Collins.<eos> Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain.<eos> I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that.<eos> No one will ever believe your story.<eos> I will.
I can handle this on my own.<eos> - Don't have to be so defensive.<eos> - You put me on a warning.<eos> That is because I felt you'd shown lack of judgement when it comes to Kaz Proctor.<eos> I do realise that I have been tough on you recently.<eos> But you should know that I consider you an invaluable part of my team.<eos> Thank you, Governor.<eos> Really, I appreciate it.<eos> You know as well as I do that Ferguson will not stop.<eos> So, neither will we.
Shall we go to McDonald's?<eos> Can we go to Gröna Lund?<eos> - - Yes, even better!<eos> Perfect!<eos> Come on, the kid wants to go to Gröna Lund.<eos> We gonna make it.<eos> How are you, Acke?<eos> - - The kids who beat me...<eos> What if they come back?<eos> - - They will not!
You look so handsome I can't stand it!<eos> And in this moment, friends, Rafael was sure, absolutely sure, that Jane was about to marry the wrong man.<eos> Anhe was also sure - that it was now or never.<eos> - Jane?<eos> I know this is terrible timing, but it's kind of like what you were saying about your writing.<eos> Sometimes you can be really far down the road, but you still have to follow your heart.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I love you, Jane.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
I did.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Much better.<eos> I did it to save your life.<eos> After the rebellion, your father was angry. Deeply angry.<eos> He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to Hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
It's a filthy... scurrilous... slander.<eos> And I will sue Anna and any publisher who touches it.<eos> Oh, please do.<eos> Do us the favor.<eos> The stronger your reaction, the greater the conjecture.<eos> You may have Sergeant Taylor under the thumb, but sufficient fuss could see an investigation at levels well above his.<eos> And no proof to back it.<eos> But a highly circumstantial case.<eos> Has George seen this?<eos> He will, soon enough.
Which way did they go?<eos> There were footprints in the dirt leading that way.<eos> Parn Heidekker.<eos> Parn Heidekker.<eos> Heidekker?<eos> Is that a name?<eos> Stop them coming.<eos> Please, you must stop. Okay.<eos> I have child who is scared.<eos> I will.
- I'm still in love with him.<eos> - Actually you're not.<eos> - I am.<eos> - Why are you saying this?<eos> Because it's a thing you tell people and I don't have that many people I can tell.<eos> Well, you aren't telling Dad.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Mmm... No.<eos> Mum, ab-so-lute-ly not.<eos> No, I won't, all right?
I guess we'll be sharing a cell.<eos> After the administration discovers that you've been secretly funding an operation in opposition of their very public embrace of the Noah Objective, well, I'm pretty sure that they'll consider that treason, don't you think, Allison?<eos> Just so we're clear, if you go down this path, you're putting everything that we do here at risk.<eos> Things will never be the same.<eos> Just find my mother and bring her back.<eos> Abe.<eos> You're really doing this.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Has he said anything about Robert Oz?<eos> No. And I won't.
So there's no alliance here, just a place to spit shit on others.<eos> I want no part.<eos> I'm gettin' out.<eos> Why are you looking at me?<eos> He's my brother, if he goes, I go too, we're the same thing.<eos> Ciro, if they go, we'll lose the best money-making spots.<eos> This fuck up can really cost us.<eos> She left the shop keys, she's not back and doesn't answer her phone.<eos> - You have to find her, Luciano.<eos> - We will, Prince.
Are you showing off?<eos> I'm just pointing out how tricky it can be to pull off something like this and... yeah, I guess I am.<eos> Worst-case scenario, someone on the other side kills our clones or stops the transfer process midstream.<eos> Then at least we'd know.<eos> And we'd need to come up with another plan.<eos> This plan's fine.<eos> So who's going?<eos> Well, we've got three pods.<eos> - I'll take one.<eos> - No, you won't.
V is Qualia property and you just transferred her off-site.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You did.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> V did it.<eos> V?<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> And neither will you.
I want to use the Cabinet.<eos> Look at you, in your little circle... ..pretending to be heroes and never expecting to pay a price.<eos> We've paid plenty.<eos> And you will keep paying till you are just yourselves.<eos> I have killed two.<eos> Come with me or I will kill more.<eos> Who else did you kill?<eos> Can we use it?<eos> No, it has to be Charles.<eos> And he won't.
Walt?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> They're coming after my job.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> The mayor, the county commissioners.<eos> They're petitioning the governor to have me temporarily suspended.<eos> And then, uh, if I lose my case...<eos> - You won't.
No, sir.<eos> You won't say a peep.<eos> Not a peep.<eos> I ain't forgot you led the police here and took away our babies.<eos> My babies.<eos> My babies!<eos> We gonna get the boys back, I promise.<eos> Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.
God, you didn't... you didn't cut your hair for me.<eos> You cut it for you because you are sick and tired of looking at the man in the mirror.<eos> But you forget... I always see you for who you are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, um... you may not think that you need me, Belle, but you will.<eos> You forget whose child it is you're carrying.<eos> He will have a mark on his head by virtue of who he is, and if you want what's best for him... you will come back to me.<eos> Threats won't make me love you again, Rumple.<eos> No.<eos> But necessity will.
Benny's closing argument brings them both to tears. - I'm working on it.<eos> - You've already tried five different versions in mock court.<eos> I know, but none of them are right.<eos> None of them got us the win.<eos> They just haven't figured out that gender plays into Taylor's case.<eos> Incredibly, their mirror jurors still think she panicked.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think he has it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But he will.
So you better find a friend and let 'em in. All right?<eos> 'Cause all of this is way too much for one person.<eos> - I guess you've seen the video.<eos> - The whole world's seen the video.<eos> I'm... not a regular therapist, you know.<eos> So you can't just run down the clock.<eos> Game's gonna start eventually.<eos> Well, then we should get started, because you've been asked to talk to me about last night, and I've been asked not to leave until you do.<eos> So, I'm... I'm just supposed to talk about my darkest secrets and my deepest fears, and all that?<eos> You will.
We put some performance supplements in there that could mess with you as a lady.<eos> What else is there?<eos> Well, I'm going to the store later.<eos> In the meantime, you can have some fruit.<eos> That's real?<eos> I thought it was just for show.<eos> My star player Dwight has been living with us ever since his father was transferred to an army base in Florida.<eos> He's doing his part for our country, so I thought I could do my part for our team.<eos> Who's to say who the bigger hero is.<eos> I will.
Well, then, I won't show.<eos> I...<eos> I'll get the books delivered to him.<eos> That's not gonna do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're a loose end.<eos> Look, here's the deal, Doc... You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were.<eos> You think he'll do that?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Good, because he won't, ever.
Oh, I think you know...<eos> Mother.<eos> I'm here to warn you...<eos> Do not let him destroy us, like he did his last family.<eos> You will never even set eyes on this child.<eos> Let me remind you, dearie, that Rumplestiltskin takes children, not the other way 'round.<eos> There's nowhere to hide from me, dearie.<eos> Whatever you're doing, the Mother Superior won't let you get away with it.<eos> That wingless glowworm won't stop me.<eos> None of you will.
I came from the same place as you.<eos> And now I'm here.<eos> I believe in the Process.<eos> They have to say it in so many words.<eos> I need confirmation from both of you.<eos> It's very important to me.<eos> Isabella...<eos> Isabella will apply to the Process.<eos> And she will pass.<eos> She will.
- Oh, God, no.<eos> Okay?<eos> Where does he keep his keys?<eos> In his...<eos> - Where does he keep his keys?<eos> - Back pocket!<eos> Go get your stuff. Oh, my God.<eos> How long has he been doing that to you?<eos> What if they come looking for us?<eos> They won't, okay?
- No! Fred, will you let me speak? Because if you don't,<eos> Now, I'm no martyr.<eos> I have no clue what is best for me.<eos> But I do know, and I feel it in my bones, what is best for my daughter.<eos> Now, I want visits with her, Harge. I don't care if they're supervised. I just want them to be regular.<eos> Now, there was a time... when I would have done almost anything,<eos> I would have locked myself away... to keep Rindy with me.<eos> But what use am I to her... to us, if I'm living against my own grain?<eos> So that's the deal.<eos> I won't...
Are you warm, my love?<eos> I might have a little frostbite.<eos> I'm looking forward to making it all better.<eos> I can't wait for you to come home.<eos> How's Sarah?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Sarah's good.<eos> Will you call her that for me?<eos> Yes, I will.
Sweet dreams.<eos> - Hi, Milo.<eos> - Hi, Dylan.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have something to show you.<eos> I'm supposed to be asleep.<eos> Your mom just started working.<eos> She'll be out there for hours.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
- You promised.<eos> Come here, buddy. Give me a hug.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Hugs.<eos> - Alice, why are you always running off somewhere you don't want to go?<eos> - Oh, fuck off.<eos> Sorry, Tyler.<eos> All right. - Bye.<eos> Call me later.<eos> - I will.
Come, come, Bradley!<eos> That little rampage you just threw across few cities, was all that just a slab for a cheap whore?<eos> Look... we both hold something that each of us wants.<eos> It would save us both a lot of time and nerve, if you simply... exchange.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.<eos> How do I know you won't copy and distribute that information?<eos> We just gonna have to trust each other, good buddy. Simple as that.<eos> - I'll need proof before I show up, anyway.<eos> - So will I.
My wife, she's prone to panic attacks.<eos> It's this guy she's sleeping with.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Okay...<eos> Dude get the fuck out of here, I got it.<eos> Alright, easy.<eos> - I appreciate your concern, Superman!<eos> Fly away.<eos> Just breathe will you. Okay?<eos> Will you?
Okay.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning, Jimmy.<eos> Me and Mom are going to church.<eos> Do you want to come with us?<eos> Ain't nothing for me there.<eos> If Mom will let me, will you take me to the lake later?<eos> Sure I will.
Can I tell you something, Peter?<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Yes, I will find her.<eos> No, you really, really won't.<eos> You'll never find your mother. Do you know why?<eos> Because I killed her.<eos> She died at my hand.<eos> By this very blade.<eos> - (GASPS)<eos> - As you will, too.
What the hell did you do to me?<eos> Dad?<eos> Get some water.<eos> Now, Annie!<eos> Breathe, breathe.<eos> He needs to go to the hospital.<eos> No hospitals.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He'll bleed to death.<eos> No, he won't.
Did you just say bears?<eos> Well, yeah, honey.<eos> This is bear country.<eos> I think the campground website said something about a sighting just last week.<eos> So keep that in mind.<eos> [strumming guitar] - ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ - [all] Yes, she will!<eos> - ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ - [all] Yes, she will!<eos> ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain, she'll be comin' round the mountain ♪<eos> ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪<eos> - [all] Yes, she will!
If I do a good job, nobody can fault you.<eos> Either way, it doesn't hurt your chances in 2016.<eos> Well, I appreciate you coming by before going public.<eos> It is classy, and thoughtful.<eos> I won't actively block you.<eos> The rest is on your shoulders.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.<eos> Frank's still on my shit list till I beat him in the general.<eos> I will.
I don't care what we agreed.<eos> Make love to me.<eos> And if you get pregnant?<eos> I want to get pregnant.<eos> And go through all that again?<eos> !<eos> No, we will never again see you in such pain.<eos> It will not die.<eos> ~ They have all died.<eos> ~ This one will not.
It's just that... Toni's piece... is so physical.<eos> The impact, the stress...<eos> Odette/Odile, Kitri,<eos> - I'm quite familiar with your résumé.<eos> - Raymonda, Sleeping Beauty...<eos> But, darling, I would be lying if I said there wasn't some concern.<eos> What is this concern? Who is concerning?<eos> Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t... to save your ankle after "Rubies."<eos> The public comes to see me.<eos> And they will in "Rubies."
Well, you can do that, right?<eos> There's some gimmes, right off the bat.<eos> The design presumes 500 kilograms... of Martian soil and samples.<eos> Obviously, we won't do that.<eos> And there's just one passenger, instead of six.<eos> With suits and gear, that's another 500?<eos> Ditch the life support, don't need it.<eos> And we'll get Mark to wear his EVA suit, for the whole trip.<eos> Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit... how is he gonna operate the controls?<eos> Well, he won't.
Oh, my God, it's gonna be huge.<eos> The gays and the housewives are going to love this.<eos> Bring in the Jews, and we'll have a three quadrant book.<eos> There is going to be an auction among all of the major publishing houses.<eos> Ellen has spoken to her agent, and he's going to let Empirical make the first bid.<eos> That is wonderful.<eos> I want all departments on this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I do not want to lose this book.<eos> And you won't.
Good day to you, Earl Kalf.<eos> Good day to you, Torvi.<eos> And to your son, the legitimate heir of the great Jarl Borg.<eos> What will you do with Mercia?<eos> I will crown Kwenthrith and her brother Burgred as joint rulers.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> You see how they feel for one another. Why choose between them?<eos> They will not rule in any case.<eos> - Then who will, Ragnar Lothbrok?<eos> - You will.
Now, don't make a fuss. Come on. It's all arranged.<eos> Sister Margaret here has very kindly volunteered to take you all the way to Southampton.<eos> And she won't stand for any of your nonsense, you dirty dog.<eos> That's it. I mean it.<eos> I'm not one for fare-thee-wells.<eos> Cheerie-bye.<eos> Goodbye, Uncle. Say hello to Scotland for me.<eos> You'll look after my gardens for me, won't you?<eos> Keep them safe, till I come back, eh?<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
Who are you?<eos> You can call me Aleister.<eos> Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do. And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
Mary, will you hang back a sec?<eos> With Burkett, there needs to be a line of questioning about his motives.<eos> His political leanings, his views on the president, why he lied.<eos> People will cover how we cover this.<eos> We need to inoculate ourselves.<eos> Thou shalt always protect the company.<eos> I want Dan to survive this.<eos> Why wouldn't he survive this?<eos> If Dan feels like this is corporate positioning, he won't do it.<eos> He won't for me.

Previously on Power...<eos> Mrs. Stern, I have good reason to believe that Simon's been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> There's proof, I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
It's probably Avi.<eos> He's in love with me.<eos> Oh, no, it's Hannah.<eos> Hannah, our daughter.<eos> I'm not telling her.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> I'm not ruining her childhood.<eos> I'm not telling her her whole life has been a lie.<eos> All right, I'll tell her.<eos> I will. - (phone beeps)
- What will I do without you?<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> Muddle through, I suppose.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> Please leave my house.<eos> And shut the door on your way out.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I will not leave until we part friends.<eos> I will not.
Perhaps you're right.<eos> Perhaps the risk to our work is too great.<eos> Just write the check so we can get back to work.<eos> I can see you're still upset about New York.<eos> I don't want to talk about New York.<eos> I do feel I-I owe you an apology.<eos> Your apology can wait.<eos> Virginia, I-I just didn't know how else to prove to you that Dan Logan is not what he seems.<eos> I do not want to talk about New York.<eos> Then we won't.
No, it was totally worth it.<eos> Felicity:<eos> Are you ok? I was so worried.<eos> Ray:<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Guard: Eyes front, Harper.<eos> I told you, eyes front.<eos> My instincts are to keep my head on a swivel.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
You'd rather rent in Compton?<eos> I can't believe you. Me?<eos> People on your block can't stand the idea of a Negro neighborhood.<eos> I'm just giving them what they deserve.<eos> Her, I'm not pulling off.<eos> Baby.<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If you choose to stay, it'll be rent free.<eos> Will he agree to that?<eos> He will.
Hey, Cyndee, we're friends no matter what, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Okay. Well, maybe I'm spoiled because things are going so well with Charles, but I think you can do better than Brandon.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Brandon's perfect.<eos> He takes care of me... like you used to.<eos> Okay, I just want you to be happy, so...<eos> Cyndee Sandy Pokorny, will you...<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh! Of course I will!
It's a tightening of the chest.<eos> I get tight in my chest, sometimes.<eos> Like the scream inside that can't come out.<eos> Oh, dear me! What's happened here?<eos> I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> Don't go!<eos> Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
Yeah.<eos> Listen, let me talk to Felicia.<eos> Please. All right?<eos> Just for a second.<eos> I'm gonna talk to you again, right?<eos> We're gonna see each other again?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You're gonna need a restraining order.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
That antique still works?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Murdoch?<eos> He's by the skidder.<eos> - Is he breathing?<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, we'll... drag them both off into the woods.<eos> What if somebody finds them?<eos> Not up here, they won't.
Let's go. Why the fuck are we here?<eos> Quiet please.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> I won't repeat it.<eos> Silence.<eos> Move along.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's mental.<eos> - May we know why we're here?<eos> - You will soon.
It's not the only reason.<eos> I just feel like this was my first parenting test and I failed.<eos> I made it about my needs, my own anxieties, not about the baby.<eos> You also gave up going to your own graduation without a thought.<eos> Look, Jane, there's no right or wrong answer.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But would you forgive me if something went wrong?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> And it won't.
This won't happen again.<eos> No problem.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> RAFAEL: Michael.<eos> It was false labor.<eos> Jane's just changing now, so... you can go, I'll give her a ride home.<eos> Oh, I'll just wait to say good-bye.<eos> I'll tell her you said good-bye. You can go.<eos> It's okay. I'll wait.<eos> Of course you will.
- Mm. Yeah, crazy.<eos> So crazy.<eos> Huh. - Well...<eos> - So...<eos> Hey, well, we got a bunch of Chinese food if you want to come on up and have some.<eos> Oh, I can't.<eos> I'm on a cleanse.<eos> Course you are.<eos> All right, we'll see you guys later.<eos> - Okay. - Yes, you will.
A music video is one part thumping bass, one part big hair, and one part animated dancing cat.<eos> - Go away.<eos> - Trust your director.<eos> Ditch the stool and sit on this taxidermy ram.<eos> And my mom said I was creepy for owning this.<eos> Um, why is Dave Kim here?<eos> We needed a crew, and he said he would work for free if he could stand close to you.<eos> Classic love story -- pop star falls for roadie.<eos> That's never happened in the history of music.<eos> Oh, it will.
Call medac. Yeah.<eos> This is CSI Morgan Brody, requesting medevac assistance at my location.<eos> D.B.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> One day at time. Isn't that what they say?<eos> So, I was just up at the hospital, and the nurse there told me you've been going up there every weekend.<eos> Yeah, she's just not responsive.<eos> I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness.<eos> Or if she will.
Looks like the realtor gave us the wrong combination.<eos> I doubt Ryan did that.<eos> He's very thorough.<eos> And yet, here I stand.<eos> Why don't you try it one more time?<eos> I've tried it about a dozen times. It won't open.<eos> Maybe 13's the charm.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will, but...
There she is.<eos> For you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Nice place.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
In 20 years' time, there won't be a house of this size still standing that isn't an institution.<eos> One pound, seventeen and six.<eos> And sold!<eos> That's it.<eos> They're in the drawing room, they've got coffee and we're done.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Not very good.<eos> I'm sure it's not as bad as you say.<eos> Mr Henderson will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
- I'll be back here with a court order.<eos> [man] Our lawyers will have one too.<eos> Guess we all know what your word is worth, don't we, Detective?<eos> What did you do, Walt?<eos> [Morty] He came to see me with the documents, which are no longer in my possession, then he made the call to Major Halpert, surrendering.<eos> Your son's a hero.<eos> Your son is a traitor.<eos> - History will determine that.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> [Halpert] Court-Martial will.
Not bangy enough.<eos> Don't you have the one that goes boof, zoof, zing, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa boof, oof...?<eos> Here, fella, check these out.<eos> Latest technologies - night-vision goggles, eh?<eos> Erm, can't see anything.<eos> Exactly... just like night.<eos> Wow!<eos> Amazing!<eos> I'll take them.<eos> Course you will.
Oh, thank you.<eos> Do you remember Endless Love by Scott Spencer?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Very same tone.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Somewhere between pulp and literature.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just trying to get through, thank you.<eos> Much more attractive in person, don't you think?<eos> Will you tell Noah this is supposed to be my party?<eos> I will.
Hopefully Max should be fully charged soon.<eos> What will you do?<eos> Run again?<eos> It's the only thing we can do.<eos> What happens when you break down?<eos> You can't last forever.<eos> And he'll die.<eos> - Everybody dies.<eos> - But the world will never know you existed.<eos> You will.
Dost thou understand my English tongue?<eos> Answer me.<eos> What dost thou want?<eos> What canst thou give?<eos> Wouldst thou like the taste of butter?<eos> A pretty dress?<eos> Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wouldst thou like to see the world?<eos> What will you from me?
You're like a miracle worker.<eos> It's all a part of the process.<eos> But for now, your chest only, okay?<eos> It feels so good.<eos> Could you maybe...<eos> Not on the first visit.<eos> It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that. I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
- There's a school...<eos> - In Switzerland.<eos> Yeah, you told me about it.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> This is a monastery in the Himalayas.<eos> I stayed there years ago... when I was lost, troubled.<eos> And the monks helped me in ways that proved to be very...<eos> I don't need any help.<eos> But maybe I will later on.
If we want anything to stick, we have to catch her red-handed.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> It'll be fish in a barrel.<eos> Two to three dozen beautiful women roaming the room waiting to be asked on a date.<eos> You will slip in.<eos> Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
Don't you think?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> Everything happens for a reason, but...<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe this town was meant to be washed away.<eos> Maybe building the dam was a mistake.<eos> No, I don't think we were all meant to die.<eos> It was an accident, and out of it came a dam that saved the town and holds twice as much irrigation water, so...<eos> But what if it were to break again? It can't.<eos> It won't.
I'm not here to confess you.<eos> I'm here to get you out of here, if you accept my offer.<eos> Do you want to work for a secret office of the Crown?<eos> Spying?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Special jobs in strange places.<eos> You'll be dead for everyone, including Blanca, your wife.<eos> You must be very powerful.<eos> These people love their executions. - It surprises me they'll cancel this one.<eos> - They won't.
Come on, Father.<eos> Let's make love.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Invite me over.<eos> Look, if you do, I can fuck all the priests if you like! I can fuck them one by one!<eos> It would be beautiful.<eos> We would all reach holiness!<eos> Penetration!<eos> Do you think anyone will come looking for me?<eos> No one will.
Well, in this case, serial murderers, too.<eos> But we are not afraid of either of those things, uh-uh.<eos> So canceling Halloween sucks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have no idea how you got into this college.<eos> And, sorry, curfew is on. Halloween, canceled.<eos> Girls, it's okay!<eos> Look, we'll just hang out and play charades!<eos> No!<eos> No! We won't!
Okay?<eos> How I usually do... huh?<eos> And if ever... that Terasaka-kun. would go over to you I won't harbor hard feelings against you.<eos> What's with that?<eos> The righteous heroine's compassion?<eos> Like the chosen one thingy?<eos> Stop acting high!<eos> No, wait!<eos> Wanna go home with us?<eos> I won't.
WAIT UNTIL I BECOME A DIFFERENT WOMAN!<eos> AFTER THEN, I WILL STOP WITH THE GAP PLAN!<eos> A little more...<eos> A little more of disciplining myself.<eos> That girl didn't come here?<eos> Hatori?<eos> We never hanged out since then.<eos> I'm definitely sure... that a call from him will come for me tomorrow.<eos> First thing, tomorrow...<eos> A call from Rita will...
It was great.<eos> I mean, Gibbs is so easy to talk to.<eos> He is?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> And we had a lot to discuss.<eos> Like what?<eos> What happens in the diner stays in the diner.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The whole point of the dinner was we would have more to talk about.<eos> And we will, just not about last night.
Clearly, she belongs to someone of importance.<eos> - No sign of a whip.<eos> - I ain't common or a slave.<eos> Long ago I was contracted as an indentured servant, but I was freed.<eos> Remove your hands from her.<eos> What is your name, Señorita?<eos> Emily West... native New Orleans.<eos> You may go with Colonel Almonte to answer his questions, or you may remain here and answer mine.<eos> Well, I believe I'd like to get to know His Excellency better.<eos> And so you will.
We sweep these valleys for any wayward homesteaders.<eos> That means you, Gator.<eos> What do we do with him?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's being executed.<eos> I reckon he can wait here shackled till the firing squad come.<eos> We ain't gonna wait.<eos> He already run off when he weren't gonna be executed.<eos> No, no, no, no, gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I will wait for 'em.<eos> I will.
A bit of ancient wisdom for you to mull on your journey.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> You're late.<eos> Shall we do this or not?<eos> I'm curious why you requested this parley.<eos> I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
- Wait, fetal surgery?<eos> By herself? - Shh!<eos> Oh, relax.<eos> It's not the ballet or whatever.<eos> Though... though it is a kind of a dance.<eos> There's grace, a rhythm... An elegance.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I got shushed, but the purple prose is fine. Shh!<eos> She is gonna pull it off, though, right?<eos> Yes. Yeah, she will.
Ha!<eos> Says the man with a fake face.<eos> But you see, that's the trouble with viewing reality through technology -- it's all too easy to feed in a new reality.<eos> You got it?<eos> Great.<eos> A story to save a town, and a puppet from a nightmare.<eos> You see, you've just seen the world through the eyes of a storyteller.<eos> The mighty armies of the Mire -- brutal, sadistic, undefeated.<eos> Even I believed the stories.<eos> But after today, no-one will again.
But not your pot.<eos> - My pot is fine.<eos> Your pot is stuck.<eos> - So, you're here to stir it?<eos> Someone has to.<eos> I know you think you're helping me...<eos> I am helping you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I don't see.<eos> You will.
- Well, it's not your best day...<eos> - I really am so sorry.<eos> Look, a mistake is like a bump in the road.<eos> One bump is not so bad.<eos> But if we keep making mistakes, eventually we change the shape of the road forever.<eos> Nick was actually really nice to me.<eos> Surprisingly decent.<eos> Well, that seems like a story worth telling.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You will.
- Yes, of course.<eos> Through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cocked and loaded by the front door, so, if the Germans ever break through, if they come to the house for my aunts and my grandmother, he has something to shoot the enemy with.<eos> And if necessary... his family, and then himself.<eos> May I ask, sir, why you're telling me all this?<eos> Our people are never frightened, Professor, and we outlast our enemy.<eos> So, tell your wife and your president, we don't back down.<eos> I will convey your message, Mr. President.<eos> But to be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They will.
The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI.<eos> They're SVR. (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Victor, the FBI, they're--<eos> They're on their way,<eos> (Sarah) what if those guys come in before they get here?<eos> Upstairs, behind all that stuff in mom's closet.<eos> But if they find us up there...<eos> They won't.
I'm different... I'm your only friend in the world.<eos> You will never know the truth unless you stop this!<eos> 01x04 Tango Uniform<eos> _<eos> Hamid was a fool, short-sighted.<eos> By killing him, I have done the Azawad Liberation Movement a favor.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now we wait to see if you live or die.<eos> Pray they find him and he has this flash drive you say is so valuable.<eos> They will.
I was asked to take control of a manned aircraft.<eos> I was offered a sum of money to do it.<eos> I took the money and I scuttled the aircraft.<eos> Your brother was the pilot.<eos> And what about the King?<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> All I know is, the Major that contacted me is missing, and I expect to be next.<eos> The least I can do is try and clear my conscience.<eos> Might take that into account when I get to hell.<eos> They won't.
Yes?<eos> Very well.<eos> How is he?<eos> I think I've stemmed the bleeding but he needs proper veterinary attention.<eos> Will he survive 12 miles?<eos> If you go as quickly as you were presumably going when you hit him...<eos> I didn't hit him, Doctor.<eos> I found him lying in the middle of the road.<eos> You'll need someone to hold Boris while you drive.<eos> I will!
You're leaving with that girl, Granny's getting nuttier with every day and I can't tie up all the loose ends.<eos> Yeah, you just laugh.<eos> If your late mother knew you're tied up with one of theirs, she'd be turning in her grave.<eos> She'd be happy !<eos> Can't you see what's been going on, you oaf ?<eos> That's why we're running away.<eos> To be left alone.<eos> Yeah, and fuck me !<eos> - Not for long, till it calms down.<eos> - It will my ass !
Maybe you can't put things back, eh? - They won't go back.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> You don't know that until we've tried.<eos> I can't unhear things I've heard, unsee things I've seen. I'm sorry.<eos> Stop saying that. - Stop saying that you're sorry. - Look, look...<eos> I don't want to go through life always worried about what's around the next corner.<eos> And I don't want my kids to, either.<eos> - Your kids? - Yeah.<eos> What happened to Steffan can never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Not me.<eos> They tell me I was only in there three months, but to me, it was an eternity.<eos> I became an old man.<eos> And I was left behind.<eos> In the darkness.<eos> For an eternity.<eos> I lost everything, over and over again... until I agreed to give them what they demanded... submission.<eos> Soldier no more.<eos> I stand before you.<eos> Broken to your will.
Are you near a computer?<eos> Kate?<eos> Mona, can you jump off?<eos> I'm at my computer.<eos> I have never written anything so fast in my life.<eos> It just came, like, pouring out of me. I posted it at 3 A.M. this morning. It's already gotten 10,000 views.<eos> I didn't put your name in it, but I did put your cell phone number.<eos> Your business is gonna take off.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> You will now.
Yeah.<eos> But if you leave, this deal is off the table.<eos> And that's a shame.<eos> For about a trillion reasons.<eos> - Let me know what you decide.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> You tell Alex that we'll take the deal.<eos> I mean, Cody will understand.<eos> No, no, man.<eos> She won't.
I'm just looking out for my people.<eos> And you think that I'm not?<eos> Look, I heard what Rick said.<eos> Which part?<eos> How they wouldn't all make it.<eos> They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Listen to me.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> If I can just clean up this Juliette thing in the press...<eos> - Ugh! - Okay, look, I have a real shot at being the C.E.O. of Luke's new company.<eos> - What?<eos> - And if that happens, we'll never have to deal with her again.<eos> Well... so you won't be my manager, either?<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
It is the oat slop that makes these girls happy.<eos> And the other animals?<eos> The brutes who bind me?<eos> What makes them friendly?<eos> Their tempers are nothing I tend to.<eos> And such a kind face.<eos> May I have a better look?<eos> Like an angel.<eos> Although I will have wings someday.<eos> Of course you will...
Listen, I want you to know something.<eos> These past few months are obviously some of the worst ever.<eos> You know, what we've seen, what we've had to do... it's...<eos> But I want you to know that, in spite of all that...<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Just stay-stay back.<eos> What is that?<eos> - I'm pulling over.<eos> - Like hell you will.
Thank you.<eos> So, what brings you to Sydney?<eos> To find a good surgeon for my husband.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Carolyn mentioned that your aunt's unwell.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> That as well.<eos> Please do give her my best.<eos> I shall include her in my prayers.<eos> I will.
Sorry, but I'm too busy to talk about art, right now.<eos> Trying to sort out this brouhaha, your brother's made.<eos> George?<eos> What's he done?<eos> Ah, nothing for you to worry about.<eos> I'm dealing with it.<eos> Well, when you've "dealt" with it, perhaps you'll take the time, to read my proposal.<eos> I haven't got the time, to read anything !<eos> Not even my own newspaper.<eos> So, when will you?
Thank you, Rose.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> It was a lovely day, after all.<eos> It was.<eos> I was happy, weren't you?<eos> I was wrong, to blame you for what you did.<eos> You were going to do it eventually, I see that.<eos> It was a stupid mistake.<eos> And it will never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.
Hatred of homosexuals.<eos> Have you decided what your turtle will be called yet?<eos> Quiet, grandma's sleeping.<eos> My choice is that he should be called Stefan.<eos> Good, huh?<eos> I can help you find a name if you want.<eos> When I grow up will you take care of me.<eos> Then we'll have a bird, for then Mom will be dead.<eos> Mom won't die.<eos> Well, someday, she will.
Yes.<eos> To protect you and secure my family's future.<eos> I understand that, the politics.<eos> But this is a marriage. You're not naive to the burdens of royalty.<eos> You and I... us.<eos> We're not just royalty.<eos> We are more than an alliance.<eos> We're different.<eos> We love each other.<eos> And we always will.
I know.<eos> I need to erase the memories of everyone who knew... that I turned Hook... into a Dark One.<eos> Right.<eos> Because no one could possibly understand.<eos> Why trust your family to help when you can do it all yourself?<eos> This was my fault.<eos> I'm the one who's going to fix this.<eos> By using dark magic to add a memory wipe to the curse.<eos> But you won't like where it leads.<eos> Or worse... you will.
Peekaboo, bitch.<eos> Vega, stand down.<eos> Let's face it, Will.<eos> You're not a closer.<eos> - You...<eos> - Stand clear.<eos> - You have no idea what's coming.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Stand clear.<eos> - And you never will!
I told him, if he went out there And said how he really felt, it was all over.<eos> No more money.<eos> So, yeah, I chose to put the band above my personal feelings. Okay?<eos> And then I just had to convince gene To play the gig.<eos> - Well, clark wanted to do it.<eos> He didn't have a problem, apparently, Much to my surprise,<eos> And, uh, I'm a-- I'm a sausage man.<eos> You know, for me, I--I just wanted to stick to my guns And--and be the sausage man who I am,<eos> And I just didn't want to turn my back On the sausage community.<eos> I won't.
Did he land on his feet?<eos> Unfortunately, no.<eos> Mugs had borrowed $500,000 from a loan shark against the value of the painting.<eos> When he didn't steal it, he couldn't pay it back. A few weeks later, the loan shark shot him dead.<eos> There's something going on with that vent.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.<eos> And they won't.
This man took the time to come to your school And help spread body-shaming awareness!<eos> I think you can give him a little of your time!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Find everything you needed today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
I don't blame you, child.<eos> Francis was his own man, who made his own choices.<eos> Long ago, he chose to love you.<eos> I see you as children so clearly now, as if it was yesterday.<eos> Your love... it gave him so much joy.<eos> And that is what you must remember as you move ahead in this life.<eos> Move ahead?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> I'm confident that you will find a way.<eos> Maybe not today or tomorrow, but you will, Mary.
But I wasn't thinking about you.<eos> I had no idea, where I would end up.<eos> Please don't..<eos> For God's sake, this is our child !<eos> And it always will be.<eos> George Bligh and his bastard Jew.<eos> Be realistic.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Why not ?<eos> Everyone else will.
He's in custody now.<eos> Good work.<eos> Mrs. Suzuki. I owe you an apology.<eos> - I shouldn't have...<eos> - I don't need an apology.<eos> I thought about what you said on the phone the other day, and... He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
Do I have to challenge you to another dance-off?<eos> Silence, Ravager.<eos> Guardian of the Galaxy, dude.<eos> You gave us our name.<eos> I mean, it was sarcastic when you said it. But still.<eos> Hey!<eos> Now you're making me mad.<eos> Get him, Drax.<eos> I have no quarrel with this man.<eos> But you will.
-Easy-peasy!<eos> -Clover!<eos> Uh, clover?<eos> Honey, maybe that's enough mothering for today.<eos> We're done?<eos> Really? How'd I do?<eos> Good!<eos> I have no maternal instincts whatsoever, do I?<eos> Well, no. Oh.<eos> But you will!
All right, mommy's gonna try out this new recipe on you.<eos> Broccoli with a little bit of peaches.<eos> It's gonna be good! You want to try?<eos> No?<eos> I-I get it.<eos> Okay, let me... let me try.<eos> Really good.<eos> We might make a big mess again.<eos> Mmm, that daddy's gonna be cleaning up. - Yes, he is.<eos> - Yes, he will.
- See?<eos> No problems, man.<eos> And the lights are gonna be synched to the music, so we're gonna have this, like, cool strobing effect. Ooh.<eos> What if no one shows?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Instagram, Snapchat, Vine.<eos> Everyone's on notice.<eos> Well, my phone's already blowing up.<eos> I just have to make sure people have a good time when they show up.<eos> Which they will.
Will you come with me, sir?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Can I, uh, get my jacket?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Back so soon? - Hey.<eos> - How was the show?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.
I will be the George Zimmerman of Garrity!<eos> Remember that guy from the news?<eos> Not your best example, Cleave.<eos> Why don't you go sit down? Very sorry to interrupt such somber soliloquies, but, uh, I would like to announce a lead in the werewolf case.<eos> I have just come from the scene of the hacky-sack killing, where I found many werewolf pubes.<eos> Werewolf pubes.<eos> Now, I shall be coming door to door over the next couple days to retrieve pubic hair samples From each and every one of y'all up in he-yump.<eos> So if you could please do me the favor of having a dirty curly at the ready, preferably clean, I'd appreciate that.<eos> He-yump.<eos> Gentlemen pallbearers, if you will.
Thank you for joining me... so that Hera may bless this marriage.<eos> Why do you look at me this way?<eos> Have you found peace, Alcmene?<eos> If you will tell me how my son found his death, I would.<eos> Will you tell me how he found life?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Amphitryon, at long last I will tell you.<eos> He was not my son, I know it!<eos> - Do not dare deny it!<eos> - I will not.
Hey.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You see that window?<eos> That overlooks the entire yard.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on, look at this window.<eos> We can see the side yard too, OK?<eos> We'll... we'll put one man on the back porch, one in the front, and we'll see anyone coming.<eos> Not after dark, we won't.
It' all right to be scared.<eos> Remember, there' no courage without fear.<eos> SKINNER:<eos> Oi!<eos> Oi, mate!<eos> I think there' something wrong with your suit.<eos> Yeah. There' a dead guy in it.<eos> [ALL LAUGHING]<eos> Hey, watch your back out there, sir.<eos> No one else will.
There' a dam.<eos> It' in the mountains.<eos> I saw German writing.<eos> RITA:<eos> Do you think you can work out where that is?<eos> I mean, there can't be too many places that fit that description.<eos> Training' over.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> We don't even know where we're going.<eos> We will soon enough.
He's up to something.<eos> Perhaps I'm wrong about him, but he's taken a keen interest in our Lady Graves.<eos> He won't be raising any alarms unless he has her on his side.<eos> And that I can assure you will never happen.<eos> Someone's escaped.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> If they reach town, it's the end of us.<eos> They won't.
Wake up!<eos> She did this to you?<eos> You see how peaceful she is, Ben?<eos> You see how I have taken all her cares away?<eos> She is just as a child should be, without troubles, without worry.<eos> There's got to be a way out.<eos> Macha, please, please?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> If she doesn't sing her song, she'll die.<eos> So will you, and your son, and all your kind.
She'd be maybe 57 now.<eos> Ellie, can you give me a ride to Joe Burger?<eos> I took my pill. OK?<eos> I just..<eos> I took my pill already.<eos> Well, I can't go back to Hot Dog Castle right now 'cause things just got very unpleasant there.<eos> OK?<eos> Well..<eos> - Don't go faster, Ellie.<eos> - I won't.
You know I've never been good at this sort of thing.<eos> She's your wife.<eos> Well, that was your idea.<eos> You vetted her.<eos> She gave up her way of life for you.<eos> - Whose side are you on, Francis?<eos> - There are no sides, Ray.<eos> Now, there's the protocol office, the chamberlain, the aide-de-camp and of course your lady-in-waiting, Madge, the Prince's inner circle.<eos> Now, you must know exactly where to place each of these individuals in the pecking order because almost every single one of them makes a profession to flatter and deceive.<eos> You won't.
Humans attack your sons. You let them stay!<eos> Put apes in danger!<eos> Caesar love humans more... than apes!<eos> More than your... sons.<eos> Ape... not... kill... ape.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> You are my son...<eos> I need you to listen...<eos> You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?<eos> Neither will you.
'This is my house, Ma.'<eos> 'I built it with my pain and my hope.'<eos> 'And you can't hurt me anymore.'<eos> 'I'm a magical child, Ma.'<eos> 'So, come on in.'<eos> 'Mi casa' 'Es su casa.'<eos> Deep breath now, Havana.<eos> Breathe.<eos> What if she comes to the house?<eos> She won't.
No.<eos> She does.<eos> Gross.<eos> If you don't put your dick down darling, you'll run into something.<eos> It's tempting, I know.<eos> You just want to crawl inside that young vagina and hide from the world, but you'll be disappointed.<eos> She has no experience, no endurance, no training, no muscle.<eos> - You'll hate it.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - You will.
Your painting, sir, is hanging next-door to that of Mr Turner.<eos> - It is in fine company.<eos> - This is treachery!<eos> - And do not talk to me of Turner's work.<eos> - Please lower your voice, Mr Haydon.<eos> His pictures look as if they were painted by somebody born without hands!<eos> Mr Haydon, what is your quarrel?<eos> What principles have you applied other than those that I gave?<eos> - Mr Haydon, please lower your voice.<eos> - I will not, sir!
Look at this dump.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> Looks like I'm still in grad school.<eos> Well, did you already find a place?<eos> Yeah. It's great.<eos> And they'll let me move in on the 15th.<eos> Well, where is it?<eos> It's like a half-hour away.<eos> We're not going to see each other again.<eos> Of course we will.
The Ancient Ones said that Jauja was a mythological land of abundance and happiness.<eos> Many expeditions tried to find the place to verify this.<eos> With time, the legend grew disproportionately.<eos> People were undoubtedly exaggerating, as they usually do.<eos> The only thing that is known for certain is that all who tried to find this earthly paradise got lost on the way.<eos> Father, why can't I have a dog of my own?<eos> You will, Inge.
Zed.<eos> I have a child I've never seen.<eos> I know it's mine, but I deny it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Scarlett, it's not gonna work.<eos> George.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't go without you.<eos> I won't.
- Oh, it is terrible.<eos> It is so bad.<eos> But it's funny too at the same time.<eos> It makes you kind of likable in a weird way.<eos> Yeah. That guy deserved it.<eos> Everybody knows that guy deserved it.<eos> - But, seriously, I'm sorry.<eos> - It's alright.<eos> You know, I'm gonna land on my feet.<eos> - Oh, you will.
Let me test the waters.<eos> The Cult of Tusk.<eos> Membership, one.<eos> But that one disciple just so happens to be the most powerful man in the free world.<eos> For now.<eos> The entitlements.<eos> Raising the age of eligibility to 67.<eos> Your people will never go for it.<eos> They will if the leadership does.<eos> And the leadership will.
Eat up, eat up.<eos> For heaven's sake, will you sedate him?<eos> His chatter is becoming wearisome.<eos> Where's Vanessa?<eos> I want Mother.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you want her?<eos> Why does everyone want her?<eos> So nurturing, isn't she, Sir M?<eos> Gentlemen, if you will.
I love you too.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Oh, why don't you cool it with the mother routine while I shake up an eye-opener?<eos> I've been expecting you for days.<eos> If you want to know so badly, I was saving Morehouse Conglomerate.<eos> How?<eos> Pleasure boating with the Shah of Iran and some centerfolds flown over by Flooze Magazine.<eos> Reza, the Shah?<eos> He's got no pull with OPEC. - He has no power.<eos> - He will soon.
I don't know how long I'll be, but I want you to wait for me.<eos> Are you going to wait for me?<eos> Where else am I going to go?<eos> How were we?<eos> You were both amazing.<eos> Did you take care of him?<eos> Oh, just making sure, this was the white one, not the colored fella?<eos> The man who struck me, yes.<eos> He is no longer.<eos> God willed it.
Yeah, sure.<eos> But they're gonna blame you anyway.<eos> Probably.<eos> Hey, Mom. Did you bring any photos?<eos> - Photos?<eos> - Family photos.<eos> One of my projects is to put together a Kitteridge family book for the kids.<eos> Be nice for them to have that, don't you think?<eos> Well, maybe for Christopher's child, but I'm not sure it'll mean much to your other two.<eos> Sure it will.
I don't know.<eos> I was just trying to be polite.<eos> H... he was rude.<eos> Rude!<eos> - You're letting me go?<eos> - Yes... because you can't seem to take no for an answer, someone very important to me got the wrong impression, cost me a great deal.<eos> Mr. Ewing, I'm so sorry.<eos> I promise it won't happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
- No, sorry.<eos> Outback somewhere?<eos> Oh, that's all right.<eos> Guess I'll head to the outback and go find her.<eos> To the outback?<eos> Yeah, you'll find her no problems.<eos> - Will I?<eos> Jahmazing.<eos> - Are you some kind of moron?<eos> Of course you fucking won't.
No other symptoms at all.<eos> Not everyone feels unwell, Shelagh.<eos> You know that as well as I do.<eos> I sometimes feel I don't know anything at all.<eos> Come on.<eos> I've done the paperwork.<eos> You get it sent off.<eos> And then, one way or another, we'll soon know for sure.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
It's locked, it's locked, it's locked.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> And he's told you what to do.<eos> Are you insane? This is not what God wants.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> Open your eyes and wash the sins out.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't!
You can never see Alison again.<eos> Fine, OK, I won't.<eos> Because if you do, someone's gonna get hurt.<eos> "Jenna and Toby?"<eos> Melissa, you were the one who wanted to take a break.<eos> I've just been killing time. Waiting for you to come back.<eos> There's nothing wrong about us.<eos> We're not even related.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Homemade too.<eos> My husband was particularly impressed with it.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Is that a Welsh accent I can hear? Uh-<eos> - Oh. Uh, maybe. The remnants.<eos> I haven't been home in a long time, so...<eos> - We're looking forward to seeing them all back here soon.<eos> And wish Jonathan a happy Christmas from all of us in Dulais, will you?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
I have the oil, but we have gasoline tanks.<eos> We must be a little better friends.<eos> Do I look I'll suffer without your fuel tanks?<eos> - Am I missing something?<eos> - No, you guys don't lack anything.<eos> But at our house we are the best.<eos> You know this.<eos> For me it's enough that you just consider it.<eos> Would you consider it?<eos> Yes, I will.
What do you want to do with her?<eos> We leave her here, she dies of exposure or the Taliban finds her.<eos> And she tells them all about us.<eos> Position, number of men.<eos> We can't leave her alive.<eos> We're not gonna kill a child.<eos> Agent Callen, why don't you ask your partner what we should do.<eos> We'll take her with us.<eos> If she slows us down-- and I want you to understand this-- you're trading her life for Kensi's.<eos> She won't.
So I just emptied my clip into the ceiling and I hoped for the best.<eos> That's unreal.<eos> Kind of like asking those guys to hold off saving the world while you go look for your wife?<eos> I'm a persuasive guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoa, hey. What are you doing?<eos> 30m! -<eos> This is the only picture I have of you.<eos> You don't need a picture of me.<eos> You never will again.
One of those will be this phone.<eos> When the killer sees it, he will identify it as Madison's.<eos> And think that there's evidence on it.<eos> Well, he doesn't know that the FBI has it.<eos> He's gonna think it's in the lost and found.<eos> And after the show, he will go to the lost and found and try to take it back.<eos> That's when we get him.<eos> Nice.<eos> Unless he doesn't try to take it.<eos> Oh, he will.
Yeah. She got there okay.<eos> Now come on, go to bed.<eos> Remy.<eos> Seriously, bedtime.<eos> Not that I'm complaining, but what's that for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> For being Dad.<eos> For saying things like "Seriously, bedtime."<eos> You let me know if you need anything.<eos> I will.
Well, I'm assuming that it's not an accident, our meeting in a hotel in Alton, Illinois, a half-hour outside of town.<eos> Freud probably said it best.<eos> There are no accidents.<eos> Then we're of the same mind.<eos> I think we are.<eos> And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
And-and I even use those ugly address labels just to get the word out.<eos> Oh, you poor thing.<eos> Do you want me to be there when you tell Lukas?<eos> You are gonna tell him, right?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Yes. Um, I can't not tell him.<eos> I mean, I could not tell him.<eos> Is that what you're getting at?<eos> No, you're saying tell him.<eos> Oh! Which I will.
What should I do? NOby!<eos> I have to make her hate me.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> That would put me in a tight spot as well.<eos> Just do something!<eos> If you insist...<eos> Hurry UP! Despica-portion!<eos> This should do it. Noby! Shizuka is here!<eos> It'll make Shizuka hate you.<eos> So will everyone else too.
Do you think they really had a treatment?<eos> At Olympia?<eos> Remember when this whole thing started?<eos> People were hoarding apple cider vinegar.<eos> Then they told us to rush to the hot springs 'cause that's a sure-fire cure.<eos> And now it's Olympia, whatever that is.<eos> Somebody's got to be making progress somewhere.<eos> It's not true what you said...<eos> That no one would miss you.<eos> I will.
Because, like a lady, I keep my eyes closed when I make love.<eos> You're a condom girl.<eos> I will make a note of that for next time.<eos> There's not gonna be a next time.<eos> Are you sure, Abbi?<eos> No, I'm not sure, 'cause I'm not sure about anything.<eos> Something just fell out of my body, so I gotta go deal with that, and you need to deal with me dealing with that.<eos> Well, you do what you got to do, girl.<eos> All right, well, maybe I'll talk to you soon.<eos> You will.
- No. - Cosima...<eos> I thought stealing from my kids was rock bottom, till I, blew my dealer in a bus station bathroom.<eos> It's pretty much get clean or die trying after that.<eos> Twenty-one days, Gus.<eos> You're stronger than you think.<eos> Alison.<eos> Me?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm gonna sit this one out.<eos> No, you won't.
Thanks.<eos> It's their loss.<eos> ♪ That's when it never fails ♪<eos> ♪ He will come back around ♪<eos> ♪ You want to take him back ♪<eos> So, I'm sorry for how I've been acting lately.<eos> I know you've got these plans for us, and... Me going out on Luke's tour is messing that up.<eos> But, uh... I don't want you to have any more doubts about our relationship.<eos> Layla Grant... ♪ I love that boy... ♪ Will you marry me?<eos> [Voice breaking] Hell yeah, I will!
Cheers.<eos> We're proud of you, daddy.<eos> Well, thank you, sweetheart.<eos> We'll see you on Saturday.<eos> I will be there to get you guys.<eos> I love you.<eos> Love you, too!<eos> Right back at you.<eos> All right, you girls need to go to bed.<eos> - All right? - No, we won't.
You know nothing.<eos> You are the last of your people.<eos> Then we are the same, eh?<eos> All I want is Wirepa.<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.

- We're not moving to Africa.<eos> I could live in Africa.<eos> You don't think I could live in Africa?<eos> That's not what I thi...<eos> It's not who you are!<eos> It's not who I am?<eos> You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.

- Woodhouse?<eos> - Mum.<eos> If I see this glass empty again, I will be very - unhappy.<eos> - Perish the<eos> - Now, then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> All right, then I will.
I feel like an idiot.<eos> And sure, as the years went on, Tommy and I spoke less and less and didn't have much sex.<eos> But compared to my girlfriends' marriages, we were on fire.<eos> Well, don't beat yourself up.<eos> I didn't know my marriage was in trouble until the moment Lorna kicked me out.<eos> What am I gonna do, Stuart?<eos> All I know is how to be married.<eos> Kinda envy Tommy.<eos> At least he knows who he is.<eos> And you will too.
Let yourself off the hook.<eos> Oh, God, what a day!<eos> All over the map!<eos> All my mother wants to do is see her daughter get married.<eos> She was talking about baby's breath in my hair.<eos> It's weird.<eos> - And if she dies, she won't... she won't even get to do that, let alone hold her grandchild.<eos> We'll... It'll be OK.<eos> Whatever happens, we'll figure it out.<eos> We will.
Sorry, everyone.<eos> It looks like the wedding's off.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> I mean, I already cashed the check, so...<eos> Anybody else want to get married?<eos> Actually...<eos> Milo, when you left the store yesterday, Dylan and I started talking about how jealous you seemed, and we wondered if you were picking up on something, so we lit a communication candle, talked it out, and realized that we're still in love.<eos> Dylan, will you marry me... Right here, right now?<eos> Yes!<eos> I will!
I'll do you a deal.<eos> Fight me for them.<eos> Come on!<eos> I don't want to fight you.<eos> Oh, don't worry. I'll let you warm up first.<eos> You think you deserve this more?<eos> - Prove it.<eos> - We're on the same side.<eos> Prove you're worth more.<eos> - No, I won't.
- Bullshit!<eos> Even if they find the camp, is this' n ass. Where will they know where we went?<eos> The figure it finally!<eos> The best thing we can do, is to protect us and to wait until they find us.<eos> No no no no!<eos> We can not remain seated here.<eos> We need to find an exit or we will die of thirst miserably!<eos> Stop it out at this Death chatter!<eos> We do not die!<eos> - Yes, we will!

I know you are not human!<eos> Light here!<eos> I can not see anything!<eos> Carlos!<eos> Do something!<eos> Why are you doing nothing?<eos> I do not want to!<eos> Do not do it!<eos> Lie quietly and close your eyes. If you zappelst, it will only hurt you.<eos> No, I will not, no, no!
So one night, we set up a booby trap.<eos> After everybody else had gone to sleep, we strung dental floss across the top of the stairs.<eos> Nothing was gonna get past us.<eos> And you know, we did catch something.<eos> You know what we caught?<eos> Your grandpa.<eos> He broke his nose.<eos> He grounded us for three weeks.<eos> And, sweetie, you know... It got less scary.<eos> And all of this will too.
You have to do this.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't crush your heart.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You could never lose me.<eos> But this... this is our only chance.<eos> Think of our baby.<eos> Think of being a mother.<eos> Our child will never know its father.<eos> Of course it will.
Now I get up every night and keep that building spic and span.<eos> 'Cause who doesn't like clean floors?<eos> Que será, será.<eos> What happened that day was part of a plan. No.<eos> No, what-- whatever this was, believe me, it was not part of some grand cosmic plan.<eos> We need to go.<eos> They're almost here.<eos> We're at the coordinates you sent, sir.<eos> But we can't get a visual on the targets.<eos> You will.
Yeah, I'm down at the beach.<eos> People are already leaving flowers.<eos> Danny's sister left one of his toys there. That's probably what started it.<eos> Check out the Crestview Inn.<eos> You know, it's nothing fancy, but it's solid.<eos> And just tell Gemma you know me.<eos> She'll give you a good rate, okay?<eos> I'll do that. Thanks.<eos> - Maybe see you around.<eos> - Yeah, maybe you will.
Mum I'm 16.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> 'The funny thing was, I didn't even know if I would write to him.<eos> But maybe he'd treat me like an adult.'<eos> I've, um... I've got a scan on Monday.<eos> Karim's starting his evening shift so he can't come. I just want someone to be there.<eos> I don't feel very well.<eos> I'm just a little bit worried.<eos> Will you come with me? Yeah.<eos> 'Course I will.
You know, being married to someone who can see what we do?<eos> Um, we... We're not married.<eos> Smart.<eos> You can get out any time.<eos> Hey, here's a clean pair of pants and a shirt for you to sleep in.<eos> - I'm fine with what I have.<eos> - Okay, cool.<eos> Well, I'm just gonna leave it there in case you change your mind.<eos> We are down the hall if you need anything.<eos> I won't, but, uh, thanks for the Chinese.
So this... This in your hands, becomes alive.<eos> Alive, Miss.<eos> Nobody wants dead and they wander the way to Leman Street. Off your fragile wrists up to your friend Mr Reid.<eos> On what all that you have made, or you would make, fall to ruin.<eos> There's a man in a signalbox out there, with his brains removed from it.<eos> Hey, kid, I paid for that, I expect to see that eaten.<eos> First glance, I'd say, a shotgun.<eos> Eat it, God damn it.<eos> Will you not come?<eos> - No, Drake, I will not.
- That's $50 right there.<eos> - Axl, we're not paying you $50...<eos> - That's $100. - Oh, you heard that.<eos> - That's $150.<eos> - You want to go for $200?<eos> - How dumb do you think...<eos> Mike, stop talking!<eos> So, where am I on the driving rotation?<eos> Um... y-you're like the alternate in case we need you to drive.<eos> - But we won't.
Saturday night, you got no one.<eos> I hadn't noticed that, Ned.<eos> Thanks. Dozens of grey whales just offshore, not a soul to take out there.<eos> We've had a recession, crap weather, half of main street already shut.<eos> Now we're a murder town.<eos> Yes. A child died here.<eos> What tourist is gonna want to come to Gracepoint with all those tents front and center, hmm?<eos> We ought to march over there and pull them down ourselves.<eos> Though first, I will have one more bourbon.<eos> Oh, no. You won't, actually.
I know it.<eos> I have a box of her things in my apartment.<eos> We've got to go back.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> They'll be staking out your place.<eos> Not Bracken's guys. Not now.<eos> And how about Donovan's guys?<eos> He'll have cops up there.<eos> There's no way we're getting near that place.<eos> We will.
You're Kiera's uh...<eos> You're Matthew Kellog.<eos> My reputation precedes me. I hope that's a good thing.<eos> I know you better than you realize.<eos> I'm not exactly from around here.<eos> You and me both.<eos> That's why I came to you.<eos> I need resources, I need information.<eos> I don't even know you.<eos> You will.
I know. I built these steps.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's impressive.<eos> Yeah, I didn't actually build them.<eos> But thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> Aunt madi had unintentionally touched a nerve in dad.<eos> As crazy as he was about Allison, he just wanted to be the guy she was dating, not the blind guy she was dating.<eos> There were people who dad let take care of him...<eos> Ow. An inner circle, if you will.
No. Puritan fathers don't care much for stories.<eos> We women keep them alive.<eos> Yes.<eos> This one has all my favorites.<eos> You may borrow it, if you like.<eos> No.<eos> Father says girls have no need to learn to read.<eos> He would read the only book worth reading and read it to me.<eos> And then, one day, he would find the right man to take over the job.<eos> God's will.
How could you run off like that?<eos> We ended up hunting for you instead of that thing!<eos> WHY DID YOU IGNITE THE LIGHT BOMB?<eos> IT CHASED HIM AWAY!<eos> - We had no choice!<eos> - HE WAS RIGHT THERE!<eos> RIGHT WITHIN MY GRASP!<eos> NOW GONE!<eos> I'll not rest until the Master is destroyed!<eos> And now, neither will he!
The zipper hasn't been invented yet, so I don't know what that gesture means.<eos> Well, that was quite a feast.<eos> Oh, that?<eos> Well, that's what we eat when we don't care what people think.<eos> Hmm. It is beautiful out here.<eos> Mmm, and it all belongs to me... And whomever I marry.<eos> Well, just the other day I was saying to my husband... Oh, did I say husband?<eos> I meant, father.<eos> I don't have a husband.<eos> Perhaps I will someday.
Thank you, Grace.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> You guys.<eos> So, can I give you a lift?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> To the ferry would be nice.<eos> Cedar cove?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just do me a favor and do your job, make sure the feds hold up their end of the deal.<eos> Yeah, they will.
When it comes to the corporation or our financial positions... I'm the guy to speak to. But about Jeb's personal life... you'll need to speak to Camille.<eos> He warned us, that the bubble was about to burst, but did anybody listen?<eos> No, they called him Chicken Little.<eos> And then the sky fell.<eos> And afterwards... did he ever say, "I told you so"?<eos> No, not Jeb.<eos> If there were more Jeb Cosgroves, the financial crisis would never have happened.<eos> He proved that you didn't have to be horrible...<eos> I'll interview the pretty widow.<eos> Of course you will.
Oh, well, I-I can see why.<eos> We obtained a warrant for your residence.<eos> Found your little secret cave.<eos> My laboratory, yes.<eos> Quite a collection you have down there.<eos> Got some human organs, some torture devices.<eos> All those are for sex.<eos> Well, sometimes you need to push the envelope.<eos> So, what happens when that tox report comes back and I can link you to the poison?<eos> You won't.
You have to return it.<eos> I can' it's used<eos> I'd get pennies on the dollar.<eos> My God.<eos> But if you could just trust me... That things are gonna be fine.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - So here we are again.<eos> - No. You said that I would never have to make this call.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - And I won't. I won't, David.
- Sweetheart... - I know.<eos> I spoke with her.<eos> I held her in my arms.<eos> You didn't want to let her go.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She's safe.<eos> I understand.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> But the people of Vega won't.
Maybe not.<eos> You still think the twins are behind this? Yes, I do.<eos> So, what-- the DNA was planted, another part of the game?<eos> Catch me if you can?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> And if they're not?<eos> If the DNA is right, and you put the wrong man-- an innocent man-- on death row?<eos> Then I will find the right man, Conrad, and I will just have to live with the rest of it.<eos> You're not the only one who'll have to live with it, D.B.<eos> This lab will.
Keep it close.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not too close, brother.<eos> Aye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wendy, I can't get the TV to work.<eos> Okay, buddy.<eos> All right. Let's see what's going on.<eos> Let's go see.<eos> Okay, I will.
Turn off!<eos> It does not look here!<eos> - Where is our CEO?<eos> - Have not seen him in a while.<eos> Call him and try again every fifteen minutes!<eos> How the heck can he be?<eos> Buy yourself a nice funeral, your dirty pussy.<eos> Is it available here, ladies?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - That all men will:
If you breach the wall here, even just a crack, you could get them more air.<eos> It's worth a try.<eos> She's not even an engineer.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Now go do it!<eos> As you wish.<eos> Do you have any weapons?<eos> Why?<eos> You'll need them.<eos> We both will.
Half a bowl of cereal.<eos> Marge, I want you-- my wife-- to draft my fantasy football team.<eos> I-I don't really know that much about the...<eos> My team name is "Somewhere Over the Dwayne Bowe" and my password is "Annoyed Grunt."<eos> Draft with God, honey.<eos> Eat your broccoli.<eos> Martin's been secretly taking self-defense courses, and now he's beating up Nelson. Hi-yah!<eos> His fat fists are a blur.<eos> I've never seen moves like that.<eos> And never will again.
Hello.<eos> Are they getting younger or are we getting older?<eos> Where are you lot from?<eos> I'm Harry. From Southport, Lancashire.<eos> All of us are from Lancashire.<eos> - How long have you been out here?<eos> - We landed last week.<eos> - You seen any Germans yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - You will.
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Addy...<eos> Addy, come on. Come on.<eos> I love you.<eos> Don't you...<eos> Mack, I love you so much.<eos> I cannot go back out there and watch you die.<eos> I'm not gonna die.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> We all will.
Studio wants to go young, but I was thinking we'd get someone a little more BoJack Horseman.<eos> What?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You're the only one with enough grit to play the part, and we can age you down in post, but I'm gonna tell you now, not gonna put up with any woe-is-me bullshit or diva histrionics.<eos> I get enough of that from my ex-wife along with newspaper clippings about gluten.<eos> God, we get it, Marla.<eos> Gluten.<eos> But if you want to make a movie, and you're ready to work...<eos> I am.<eos> I will.
You know, everything that's happening to me it just.. It doesn't seem worth it without him.<eos> I thought all I wanted was to be a star...<eos> So why don't you stop being so stubborn and call him?<eos> Because I'm scared.<eos> What if he doesn't want to speak to me?<eos> He will.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> I'll never meet someone as good as Bobby to share things with.<eos> ~ Oh, come on...<eos> ~ I... I won't, Cilla.
Hey, can't touch this.<eos> Skeletal.<eos> Oh, and just so you know, Richard used to sprint for his university.<eos> Babe, you have no idea how quick I am over the finish line.<eos> Oh, I think I do.<eos> Alf, could you really beat Richard?<eos> Well, she said that he was a sprinter, so let's make it an endurance event.<eos> You got it, Wikus, I'll design it myself.<eos> I'll call it "the Master Race".<eos> We probably won't.
Amber, you've really grown in this position.<eos> I mean, we both think that.<eos> And I-- Well well, and you've outgrown the position.<eos> Yes, everything's-- everything's growing except for my salary.<eos> Right.<eos> - It's a joke, but-- - Sure. - But yes, um...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I know--I do know that things have been slow here, but obviously, things are gonna pick right back up.<eos> - Yeah, we think so.<eos> - Yeah. Oh, they will.
It's not something I'd wish on anyone.<eos> That bomb went off... and I woke up.<eos> My body woke up.<eos> I'm not the same person I was, but if you will give me a second chance, if you will try...<eos> I have some good news.<eos> I can call off the hit men 'cause Elizabeth North is already dead.<eos> Please be joking.<eos> Please have good news.<eos> A source close to Elizabeth tells us she keeps a secret apartment under an assumed name at the Findley.<eos> A love nest, if you will.
There was the new Mini Cooper S which was shotgunned by Hammond.<eos> And an Audi S1 which, as a result, would be driven by me.<eos> I was expecting a Fiesta ST and a Golf GTI.<eos> Oh, we drove those last year.<eos> -Oh, yeah.<eos> -So, this is their<eos> -Well, it's quite interesting, 'cause I've never driven an S1 before.<eos> And I've not driven a Cooper S, so...<eos> So it'll be a voyage into the unknown.<eos> -Yes, it will.
For example...<eos> Where's McGee?<eos> I left messages on his home phone, cell, and BlackBerry-- no answer.<eos> Rule number three:<eos> "Never be unreachable."<eos> Boss, I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> I couldn't hear my cell.<eos> It won't happen again, boss.<eos> You're right, McGee.<eos> It won't.
Never.<eos> You're not even here right now.<eos> You're dead.<eos> You blew your brains out.<eos> Stuck your gun in your mouth and you blew your brains out.<eos> I had my reasons.<eos> There was no way out.<eos> I hate you!<eos> You swore you'd always love me.<eos> And I always will.
What's up?<eos> Oh, here.<eos> It's from Rodney.<eos> I know it's not nearly all there.<eos> I hate that you work your ass off to pay his debt.<eos> Rodney needs to watch it.<eos> I like him, Russell, I really do, but I worry that...<eos> Hell, he might be safer over in Iraq.<eos> Well, do you mind not telling him I brought you that, please, and if he don't bring the rest of it,<eos> I will on my next payday.
Their home now a prison between heaven and earth.<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> Erik severed the link between giants and men."<eos> ISABELLE'S MOTHER: "And peace returned to his kingdom again.<eos> The mystical relics were all that remained safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.<eos> And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep."<eos> JACK'S FATHER: "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend."<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
I understand why you did what you did.<eos> And I forgive you.<eos> I want you to know that... your secret's safe with me.<eos> So, how's she doing?<eos> Stable.<eos> The doctors don't know what she took, so we just have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I'm an old romantic.<eos> I always hoped that when I finally said "I love you" to someone... she'd say the same thing back.<eos> - And that someone will.
We were just kids.<eos> The night Ridley turned 16, she ran away.<eos> She said she could feel herself turning Dark.<eos> She said she had to get away before she hurt anybody she loved. Before she hurt me.<eos> I followed her.<eos> Then it happened.<eos> I saw it all.<eos> She loved me. I know it.<eos> It's not fair what happened to her. And the same thing could happen to me.<eos> It won't.
I told you, whatever.<eos> Another one?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - It's about time.<eos> - Shut your mouth.<eos> For real.<eos> You can put your stuff in here.<eos> I don't have any stuff.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> You will.
Not at that level.<eos> I tried to give it up.<eos> I tried everything I could to kick it.<eos> -I should have tried hypnotism.<eos> -You should.<eos> Maybe next time?<eos> Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.<eos> And when that didn't happen... ...I panicked.<eos> To various people invariousways I am in for money I don't have.<eos> Never will.
- I don't know.<eos> Dying of embarrassment somewhere?<eos> You think they might call it off?<eos> Oh, man, Muffin, get over it.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're gonna have beige grandkids that are bilingual.<eos> We'll see about that, won't we?<eos> We will see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
No.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Down?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you pin it on me, Mama?<eos> Red.<eos> I might have known it would be red. It's pink.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
But where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on.<eos> Story time.<eos> I really want to see.<eos> Let's have a story, naughty, naughty.<eos> What if they don't find her?<eos> They'll find her.<eos> Yeah, but what if they don't?<eos> They will.
Do you think I have smugglers in my trunk?<eos> - No!<eos> - I have two American thieves in the trunk of this car that I'm crossing your border with right now.<eos> Please!<eos> Please, have a look.<eos> See, see all the criminal activity happening in my trunk right now!<eos> Open the trunk, sir.<eos> - Open the...<eos> - Open the trunk, just open the trunk.<eos> - So I'll just... Oh!
It won't happen again.<eos> Why am I wasting my time?<eos> Go to hell, both of you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're fired.<eos> I quit.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This ever happens again...<eos> It won't.
So tell me what are your plans for the future?<eos> Have you two thought of having a child of your own?<eos> - What can I say, ma'am...<eos> - What can I say, Cornelia.<eos> I've been asking you for ages to call me Cornelia. You really want to make me feel old, do you?<eos> - Can I have one?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Another thing.<eos> Quit smoking.<eos> Maybe this way he will, too.
Why not?<eos> You don't think people wanna hear the truth?<eos> Not as much as when Louis was the culprit.<eos> The other papers reported on it in a very small way, didn't they?<eos> In a few months, I doubt anybody will remember the Jessie Taylor case that clearly.<eos> It'll slip away bit by bit.<eos> Well, I hope you're wrong... ..but you're probably not.<eos> Of course, we don't have Louis' side of the story.<eos> - l still haven't heard from him.<eos> - Perhaps we never will.
Why do you laugh?<eos> One day, Lupo, all that you see here will fall under Rome's rule.<eos> And if that day happens a bit further down the road, because of Da Vinci's intervention... ..so be it.<eos> But he has the key.<eos> That makes him one step closer to obtaining the Book of Leaves.<eos> Let him keep it for now.<eos> At least we know where it is.<eos> And besides...the key is useless without its counterpart.<eos> And what if Da Vinci obtains that?<eos> He won't.
Quiet, now.<eos> If you don't be a good little girl, you'll get...<eos> Mommy, I can go into the dark place and find Daddy, if I go to sleep.<eos> No, it's too dangerous.<eos> I nearly lost you once before.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen again.<eos> I can find him.<eos> I promise I'll find him.<eos> I promise.<eos> I will.
They miss you.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Well...<eos> Because of the fight, I'm not pregnant anymore. So...<eos> I brought your mail.<eos> You picked a real psychopath.<eos> They've tied a total of six murders to him and his mother.<eos> They still haven't found camila, right?<eos> No.<eos> But they will.
No.<eos> You haven't forgiven me.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> You don't love me anymore.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm with someone else now.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I feel an infinite tenderness for you.<eos> I always will.
It's likely not a bad thing we never knew each other.<eos> How so?<eos> Well I'm just saying, it's probably a good thing your mother kept us a secret from each other until now.<eos> It's not really fair to say that.<eos> I mean, we don't know what could have happened.<eos> No. We don't.<eos> But honestly, Tinny, I'm -- Was- - I was a bad person, who has done in my past some very bad things.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Me too. I will.
Tyler, don't worry.<eos> I'm sure I'm gonna like your friends.<eos> Of course you will.
Shit.<eos> What's Chiara doing tonight?<eos> Out with her new boyfriend.<eos> Who's her new boyfriend?<eos> This guy, Patrick.<eos> It's kind of serious.<eos> He gave her a promise ring.<eos> It won't last.<eos> It might.<eos> It won't.
Where are you going to spend the night?<eos> At my dear brother's place, of course.<eos> I'll take you to the barracks tomorrow.<eos> I'll talk to them.<eos> And you'll do what they tell you.<eos> And you'll say 'Yes, sir. '<eos> No fuckin' way.<eos> Yes, sir!"<eos> I won't say that!<eos> - Yes, you will. 'Yes, sir!
- She's here now.<eos> - And I have an appointment.<eos> And I did do my homework, Miss Lowry.<eos> I didn't need to see your client to know that she fits the profile of someone who'd commit this kind of act.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> You arrogant bitch, you judge her before even seeing her!<eos> That was her choice.<eos> Good day.<eos> - Will she see me?<eos> - No. No, she won't.
- Bobo?<eos> - Get a rag.<eos> - Are you okay, Bobo?<eos> - Klara, go!<eos> - Bobo, let's go to my room.<eos> - It's your fault, Klara.<eos> - No.<eos> - Bobo?<eos> - I'm never going to get a guy.<eos> - Of course you will.
And victims can sometimes broadcast victimhood involuntarily.<eos> Not me.<eos> That's not necessarily true.<eos> Your victimhood has a high profile.<eos> I'm a celebrity victim!<eos> Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
Don't touch me.<eos> Let me go by myself.<eos> I don't want your fucking hands touching me.<eos> - Can someone get Anna's coat?<eos> - Call a taxi!<eos> OK, I'm going.<eos> - But not as long as you keep glaring at me.<eos> - Back off. Come on guys, back off.<eos> - Good. Do so then. Go.<eos> I will.
I'll admire what I wanna admire, think what I wanna think.<eos> Fiddle who I wanna fiddle.<eos> Domingo Hemingway!<eos> As I live and breathe, the Ghost of Christmas Past.<eos> Mr Fontaine.<eos> Call me Ivan.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Ivan Anatolivich Fontanov, like the old days.<eos> I never called you Ivan Anatoli in the old days.<eos> Well, you will now.
It's quiet.<eos> You had a good day on the floor.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> - Clever girl.<eos> How did you know it was a takeover?<eos> Just a feeling, I guess.<eos> Right.<eos> A feeling.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> No, you won't, actually.
Okay.<eos> I'm just really glad to see you.<eos> I thought for sure you were dead.<eos> - Have you spoken to anyone else?<eos> - No, nobody.<eos> It's been radio silence.<eos> Really?<eos> - What about Grace?<eos> - No. And she won't answer her computer.<eos> Nobody will.
Yeah, that didn't work out. Oh.<eos> You're not going on a day trip without me, are you?<eos> Isn't a day trip this time, partner.<eos> You're leaving... you're leaving Roarton?<eos> Why?<eos> Lots of reasons.<eos> This place.<eos> It's never going to accept people like us.<eos> Never ever. It will. We'll make them change.<eos> No, it won't.
Try and stop me.<eos> I'll tell Dad.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Let's not be silly.<eos> OK?<eos> I mean, what would you say, anyway?<eos> We meet up and hug. So what?<eos> You tell your dad and... he won't understand.<eos> You tell people what we've been doing, they won't understand.<eos> No-one will.
She loves you and you've given up.<eos> How do you reckon she feels?<eos> Steven was one of my first appointments and he's made great progress with the women's vocab and reading.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> The smack fairy.<eos> She deserves a bit of fun, but you're so off your face you don't care.<eos> Toni, you're off your nut, aren't you?<eos> You've got to help me.<eos> You supplied her? What if it gets out?<eos> It won't.
Jeez!<eos> All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> - Oh, Liz, it's looking beautiful.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It's too busy.<eos> And I love my scarf. Thank you.<eos> Does it go with the outfit?<eos> I don't know. I don't care.<eos> Well, your friends will.
We're coming in.<eos> Turn that thing off.<eos> You're going to make them sniper bait.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Where's Tom?<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> He walked out of Keystone, he walked back from Michigan.<eos> He'll be back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course he will.
He is right to be scared.<eos> I do know things.<eos> Well... Anything I can pick him up for, start a case?<eos> Yeah, whoremongering drug pusher.<eos> Trying to bribe me to move my church elsewhere.<eos> And that's after he sent thugs out to scare us.<eos> Well, the question is, is there anything else, anything I don't know?<eos> If that ain't enough, Sheriff, then there's nothing.<eos> He'll have his reckoning someday.<eos> Just like you will, just like I will.
It is. I tested it this morning.<eos> Ah, hair of the dog -- also a good cure.<eos> I don't know about the cure part.<eos> How'd your end go?<eos> This afternoon, Flynn will be at a micro-distillery tasting for event planners and liquor distributors.<eos> How'd you find out -- organized crime tip?<eos> Organized wife tip.<eos> She has access to the guest lists for these types of things.<eos> She's not gonna be there, is she?<eos> Yeah, she will.
Make peace, and bask in glorious light.<eos> He shall be awarded all respect deserved.<eos> Many a boy may enter a war.<eos> Yet at it's end, only a man will emerge.<eos> It warms my heart to see you become one.<eos> I am what you have made me.<eos> More soldiers return.<eos> They pry wood and beams searching for vermin.<eos> If we stay, will they not find us?<eos> They will.
Japan bombs America!<eos> Read all about it!<eos> KING LEAR<eos> - Thanks, sir.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Sir...<eos> I don't like to ask, but...<eos> Why are we even going there?<eos> They won't take me.<eos> They will.
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell!"<eos> That shit never gets old, right?<eos> I might actually be lucky this happened now.<eos> Guards just think I got the flu like everyone else.<eos> Well, in two days, you're gonna be wishing you had the flu.<eos> I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll get through it.<eos> I'll get back on track. They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
Wait.<eos> I know... I know what this is.<eos> I think I remember who I am.<eos> Well, I'm sure Mr. Gold will be thrilled.<eos> These are the places you saw it?<eos> Yeah. This town's lousy with magic.<eos> Now you should go.<eos> If Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
Oh, we're... we're everywhere, Regina.<eos> See, after I left Storybrooke as a boy, I was babbling about magic, about what I had seen, and what had happened to my father.<eos> You know, most folks, they... they wrote me off. But some didn't.<eos> And they found me.<eos> "They"?<eos> Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.<eos> This little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic... It's not gonna work.<eos> No, of course it will.
- Aaron, I have a family.<eos> That sergeant I stabbed? He was...<eos> She's 11.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah, she is.<eos> My family got to Texas.<eos> They're, uh waiting for me.<eos> Well, then you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but he can't get away with it!<eos> - 'Cause everybody always gets away with everything!<eos> - He's not going to!<eos> - It's not fair!<eos> I promise you, mother.<eos> We will get him.<eos> He's a bad guy, and we will get him.<eos> We just have to do it the right way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we will.
- Nothing.<eos> I have a couple of headlines and things, but otherwise nothing.<eos> What do you dream of, Barnum?<eos> Maybe just that things were more like they were before.<eos> Change the charge of your dreams.<eos> They're negative, make them positive.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> What does Vivian say?<eos> I haven't told her yet.<eos> I will, of course.
Or a speech.<eos> I-I wasn't even able to stop and pick up a cheap bottle of champagne.<eos> I never thought I'd feel like this again.<eos> You're everything that's good in my life.<eos> We've been through so much together.<eos> I need you, Christine, I want you and I... I can't imagine my life without you. I don't want to...<eos> I just want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side.<eos> Christine... will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course I will.
Exactly.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So you're leaving tomorrow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - We should stay in touch. - Mm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Do you have an e-mail account?<eos> Isn't it the best?<eos> Are you gonna miss your American family?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I will.
Hank!<eos> Be right back, okay?<eos> So what's gonna happen with her?<eos> She'll disappear.<eos> I'll make sure she does.<eos> So we'll... we'll never know?<eos> It needs to unfurl on its own,<eos> Anonymously, Where the world can't interfere.<eos> And if she's carrying what we think, You will know.<eos> We all will.
When it happens in our countries, it's called collateral damage.<eos> Acceptable losses.<eos> A percentage some General signs off on before drones start flying.<eos> You send your troops, your helicopters, your drones, to kill your enemies.<eos> But you hit innocent people too.<eos> You say you want peace.<eos> Your so-called road to peace is splattered with our blood.<eos> Call us the Crimson Resistance.<eos> We don't know when death will come.<eos> Neither will you.

If she wasn't the one they were after and she's just in the way--<eos> Mr. Castle, you need to stay positive.<eos> Whatever their motives, the kidnappers will realize she has value.<eos> Now what we need to do next is go to your home and set up a trap and trace on your phone lines so we're ready for their call.<eos> I'll wait for you outside.<eos> Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
What happens to you after?<eos> Assuming... We're both not killed, I-I disappear.<eos> No, but we just... that's the job.<eos> That's my life. Yeah, but...<eos> We just met. I mean, I got a lot of questions, a lot of things I want to say. I don't...<eos> I don't...<eos> I-I need to have more time.<eos> Maybe we can do that sometime, you know, someday.<eos> How will I know if you made it?<eos> You won't.
-Why would I want to do that?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I work for you as long as you'll have me.<eos> I apologise, Will. I know you've got my back.<eos> I appreciate your honesty very much.<eos> Shall we get on?<eos> -You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> -Yes.<eos> But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
I'm sorry about Sparkles.<eos> About ruining it for you.<eos> Looks like a nice space.<eos> It has asbestos in the bathroom.<eos> I'll have it removed.<eos> Unless you don't think you'll need a bathroom.<eos> - Then I guess...<eos> - I'm gonna need a bathroom.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course you will.
Yes.<eos> I say that as someone who...<eos> No, I know, you've got your help.<eos> I understand.<eos> And I'm happy for you.<eos> No, I am.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm sure Victor would... Oh, we'll see.<eos> I love you, Richard.<eos> I always will.
You see the little guy over there - talking to the Special Forces with the fat neck?<eos> Drinking coffee?<eos> That's Sam, the French ambassador's driver.<eos> Why's he drinking coffee, at this time of night, do you think?<eos> IN RUSSIAN<eos> Tanya, why is Sam on the coffee and off the Cointreau?<eos> I think he's going to airport.<eos> He's going to the airport.<eos> Will you talk to her and make sure she comes out at half-term?<eos> Yes. Course she will.
- Thanks, man.<eos> - You got my vote, Mr. Grayson.<eos> - Thank you, sir. - What the hell's that about?<eos> - Um... That would be me.<eos> I think I might have told Charlotte that they could use the bar for a press conference.<eos> Ah, Jack.<eos> I wanted to thank you for allowing us the use of the tavern.<eos> Yeah, sure, but you'll have to excuse me. I'm running late.<eos> Actually, we were hoping to discuss involving you with the campaign in a more official capacity.<eos> Our very own, uh, "Joe the plumber," if you will.
All we do all day long is watch them play.<eos> Play is serious.<eos> It's how we learn to read one another... Oh. ...and the world.<eos> I don't remember much of that as a child.<eos> Because of the war, you never had the pleasure of play.<eos> Things were hard.<eos> Very hard.<eos> Philip must be excited about your family growing.<eos> I haven't told him.<eos> I will, of course.
I don't accept what you're saying and Cora certainly won't.<eos> But we must go now or we'll get stick.<eos> Do any of you ever leave school?<eos> ♪ Seldom from<eos> ♪ Her eyelids<eos> ♪ Where the teardrops<eos> ♪ Banished<eos> I'm sneaking off.<eos> I wish I knew why.<eos> You will.
You are high.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I can't lose you right now.<eos> This is very serious.<eos> I need you to go find some pliers or tweezers.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with my mom.<eos> Tell her that I don't want to sit next to Uncle Rod at Thanksgiving this year.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
What else can you tell us about Susanna?<eos> - She's not happy. - No?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I don't know why, I just know.<eos> She gives you your medication?<eos> For all the good it does. Yes.<eos> - Are you French? - Yes.<eos> Oh!<eos> I'd love to go to France again.<eos> But I never will.
The person that you made me, the guy that rides up on a motorcycle and says exactly how he feels and... and what he wants, even if it's complicated.<eos> That's the guy I want to be.<eos> Now I'm here to say that I don't care how hard it is, it's what I want.<eos> Because what we have is worth it.<eos> Annie, I love you... and I always have.<eos> Annie Wilson, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God, are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it's romantic as hell, and I'm not taking no for an answer this time.<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
You molded her well.<eos> She came that way.<eos> Gentlemen... from all accounts, you and Eli left off in a good place.<eos> I hope we can start there.<eos> This faction poses a threat to your agents as well.<eos> If we act together, we are stronger.<eos> So the FBI has Officer Mantel's body?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> Or you will momentarily.
Here you are, lad.<eos> Support the bill!<eos> Support the bill!<eos> Free to you, Mr Greg.<eos> These commissioners, hand-picked for their indifference to infant suffering, are nothing but apologists for the mill owners!<eos> Their purpose is to delay the passing of the Ten Hour Bill, a bill that merely seeks to ensure that no child works more than ten hours a day.<eos> Our children know nothing but work and suffering from Monday morning to Saturday night.<eos> The cruelties inflicted upon them, the long hours they work, would disgrace a West Indian plantation!<eos> We shall have the Ten Hour Bill!<eos> Yes, we will...
I've risen from apprentice to overlooker.<eos> I know nothing of other mills, but I can say that the children employed by Mr Greg are most content with their situation.<eos> When I see one of those pious, canting, liberals riding in their carriage,<eos> I remember the vehicle is built of infants' bones.<eos> It's lined with their skin.<eos> The tassels are made out of their hair.<eos> The harness, their sinews.<eos> The very oil with which the wheels are greased is made of infants' blood!<eos> 'We shall have the Ten Hour Bill! '<eos> 'Yes, we will, yes, we will! '
- Thanks.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.<eos> I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.<eos> You've been to hell and back. I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> - As long as we get the real bomber.<eos> - We will.
Hey, hey.<eos> Easy.<eos> Where are we?<eos> We're safe.<eos> A bubble has now been created for Nikita to believe in.<eos> She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.<eos> As long as they remain in that bubble, we'll continue with business as usual.<eos> Nikita's too smart.<eos> Your illusion won't hold.<eos> Yes, it will.
I don't know yet.<eos> Vic, uh, found this among the possessions Of a dead psychic.<eos> Well, I have a hard time believing That you ever visited a psychic.<eos> I didn't.<eos> But it appears that your mom did.<eos> Do you want to hear this?<eos> To be honest, I normally would never come here.<eos> But things have changed in my life.<eos> The spirits say, if you're asking Whether or not the cancer will kill you, Their answer is...<eos> No, it will not.
I can tap into my inner... my inner Hemingway, and, uh, and my, um...<eos> my "Morman Nailer."<eos> Whoa! Wait there, pal.<eos> You, uh... you need a hand?<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> Yes!<eos> Where-where are the woods?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what... I'll drive you there myself.<eos> - Ha! - Yes, I will.
And the frog says, "Hey, fuck you.<eos> I've been sick."<eos> You got to get your show ready.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> At some point, I'm gonna have to call my parents.<eos> Do you have to?<eos> My father keeps a scrapbook on me.<eos> He Googles me every morning.<eos> He's gonna understand.<eos> - He will.
Would you be here if I told you before?<eos> All right.<eos> So make a trade in a public square.<eos> Kamali and the virus? What if he releases it?<eos> We're playing by Ulyanov's rules.<eos> It's our only chance. We just did a Houdini act get get away from that guy.<eos> Kamali's the only man who knows where the antivirus is, Scott.<eos> Without a cure, Martinez and everyone at that base who's infected is dead, and if we can't contain it there, who knows how many more?<eos> That "far, far better that that I do" shit might work on him. Doesn't work on me.<eos> So what will, Scott, what will?
Any one of these guys could have done it.<eos> They didn't kill Ezequiel.<eos> We broke an international auto fraud ring and caught Nick Castigan's killer, and I'm thinking, with enough pressure, we can make 'em for Ezequiel's murder as well.<eos> It was a good day, Carrie.<eos> I'm telling you we're missing something.<eos> Now I want to go into that list of buyers again, see if one of them has a registered .22.<eos> Please, I got people from the City Council calling me, diplomats from the State Department.<eos> It's like half the traders on wall street bought one of those cars.<eos> We're done. I can't go to this kid's father and tell him we have the guy who murdered his son. I can't do that.<eos> Then I will.
It's a delay.<eos> Not a failure.<eos> I'm not sure there's a distinction.<eos> Not in this context.<eos> What Duncan is trying to say is, we can still right the ship.<eos> Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
Let me lighten your load.<eos> What do you fancy, Prince Filipe?<eos> - You do not waste time. - Oh...<eos> Time is a game played beautifully by children.<eos> - I hate children.<eos> - Hmm... wise man.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> A blindfold?<eos> Please, I've came so far to see your petals in bloom.<eos> And you will, you will.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> You killed all those people, Wade.<eos> That's on me, too, now.<eos> I made Audrey and Nathan a promise.<eos> Audrey and Nathan...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We both got secrets we don't want getting out. I mean, I could tell everyone that Lexie is Audrey and that you knew all along.<eos> The guard will come for you. You want that?<eos> The guard will come for both of us.<eos> Yeah, and they'll...
Dad will never know.<eos> Good plan. Let's get dad a girlfriend.<eos> I don't think your calculations included all these people. Whoa, little miss, where you going?<eos> Ha. To see Nikki.<eos> And so are all these people.<eos> I'm sorry, you're going to have to go to the end of the line.<eos> No, sweetie, the end of the line.<eos> I'm guessing we're not going to have time to see Santa today.<eos> What if we don't meet her?<eos> We will.
That ain't Stefan.<eos> Damn it. What the hell is going on?<eos> Looks like Tessa had her way with him.<eos> So if that's Silas, then he's not a problem anymore.<eos> This is a good thing, right?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> It's a very, very bad thing.<eos> You're a fool not to run.<eos> Silas will find you.<eos> Or he won't.
I can see it.<eos> You expect me to put this down and come and work for Tom Boss?<eos> I've got two words for you.<eos> No.<eos> Boss went on a course.<eos> He hasn't killed anyone in months.<eos> Both answers are still no. Jack!<eos> If this is about what happened between us...<eos> Nothing happened between us.<eos> And nothing ever will again.
run away.<eos> Hello?<eos> Poor kids.<eos> We're screwed.<eos> Mom loves to punish us in those twisted ways.<eos> I know ... a-and remember that one time I wouldn't stop picking my nose and so she ... she put that dog cone collar on me?<eos> She cannot find out about this.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> She won't!
-Thanks.<eos> I told you I would kill them.<eos> Fine, let's all go down together.<eos> How does it feel to have someone else in control?<eos> One way or another, I'm taking jason burr and the plans for the ion cortex Buried in his mind.<eos> You're stronger than the rest of them.<eos> -Stronger than he is. -(struggling)<eos> It's not me you want to fight.<eos> Batman:<eos> No. No, I won't!
Yeah.<eos> Did you have any luck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here's the, uh, DV-100.<eos> Just needs the offending party and signatures.<eos> I'll run it back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want to tell me who it is that needs restraining?<eos> I need to know what you're doing, Tara.<eos> You will.
Ah, so listen.<eos> Doing the thing was 50,000.<eos> Keeping quiet about it,<eos> I'm thinking it should be 50 more.<eos> Oh, I want word to spread.<eos> It's kind of the whole objective, actually.<eos> You see my point?<eos> You should know, I find post hoc negotiation... distasteful.<eos> Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought, doctor.<eos> But soon, everyone else will.
Nah, I don't need some head-shrinker analyzing me. All right, Joss?<eos> I just needed some time to just clear my head.<eos> It's not that simple, Paul.<eos> I saw the toll combat took on you.<eos> You still think I'm a danger, don't you?<eos> Joss, I never laid a hand on either one of y'all.<eos> No! I'd just find you asleep on the kitchen floor cradling a gun, with our son in the next room.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Your Honor, we wish this were all legally proper, but the attorneys who intend to split off have made improper avowals...<eos> Excuse me. We have not.<eos> In fact, it has been the position of the plaintiff...<eos> - Sit down and let him speak!<eos> - No, you sit down.<eos> We have just as much right...<eos> I have laryngitis today.<eos> And I need everyone to quiet down.<eos> Your Honor, if we could call a witness to the stand to speak to the defense's lies?<eos> No, I won't.
Did you sleep well?<eos> You're up early.<eos> Have you eaten?<eos> Father...<eos> Why?<eos> Kangchi is wrong for you.<eos> You never should have gotten close.<eos> He can turn human with the Book of the Nine.<eos> Then his destiny will change.<eos> So will the Venerable's prophecy.
You near as said it yourself.<eos> The jar contained the Song of the Sirens.<eos> I've been foolish, very foolish.<eos> I must seek out Circe again.<eos> I cannot sit here and watch Medusa die.<eos> You would trust this Circe after all she has done?<eos> You would be lucky to return with your life.<eos> Then we have to find another way.<eos> Do not worry my love, for you are everything to me... ..and I will not lose you.<eos> I will not.
Cos if that's your own, you should work that up into a novel or something.<eos> So, now, you need to be aware that taking drugs as part of a medical trial does have risks, however small those may be.<eos> Dude, I've gobbled blank pills knocked out by rudeboys in gas masks.<eos> I go to un-franchised fried chicken outlets.<eos> I think I can handle a little bit of medical testing.<eos> Will it definitely come up?<eos> They're meeting for a big chat, JP.<eos> Ooh, big chat.<eos> No-one likes a big chat.<eos> Still, maybe it won't.
It's my father.<eos> This is a twist I did not expect.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just gonna have to "Oh" this out until I'm not surprised anymore.<eos> Lois, before I get mad at your dad, h-he isn't the Little Caesars guy, is he?<eos> No, Peter, we've been through this. Good.<eos> I could never be mad at that guy.<eos> He says my favorite word twice in a row.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.<eos> Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
I'll never go to prom with you.<eos> I'd rather be thrown into the ocean wearing a speedo made of meat.<eos> - Silence!<eos> - No, you silence.<eos> Don't you dare tell me to silence.<eos> Okay, then shut up.<eos> You can have the Asians back, but I wanna negotiate my own terms.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Now shut your silly little mouth, or you will never see Fred again.<eos> In fact, no one will.
We therefore commit their bodies...<eos> Elzevir Block. A great man.<eos> The very best of us, Ratsey.<eos> John Trenchard.<eos> I never liked him.<eos> .. In sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternal life.<eos> What will you do now, ghost of John Trenchard?<eos> I will stay in the village I should never have left. And I will marry the only woman I have ever loved.<eos> If she'll take me?<eos> She will.
I'm shit scared.<eos> Give us some cider.<eos> Oh, have it, mate.<eos> Get it down you.<eos> Fucking enjoy it.<eos> Do you remember when we kicked the shit out of Ryan?<eos> I liked that.<eos> That was mad.<eos> Why don't you come back to school?<eos> Maybe I will.
I didn't want to see you until I'd be honest!<eos> Until I had changed!<eos> Until I was myself!<eos> Fine!<eos> Hooray!<eos> You got what you wanted!<eos> But you can't have it all.<eos> I warned you, damn it! I did, but you never listen!<eos> Do what you want, but I can't do this to your father!<eos> I won't!
I'm fed up.<eos> Reinert, do you think that you can finish this film without my help?<eos> This is yours and mine project.<eos> Yo cannot sidetrack me like that.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I have my own private movie.<eos> You will never finish this film without me, and you know it.<eos> Do you understand what I say?<eos> You will never...

What are you doing here?<eos> I need to know...<eos> Failed?<eos> - What are you going to do?<eos> - To meet my promise.<eos> - I'm going to work for my father.<eos> - Do not do this!<eos> Do not give up!<eos> But you?<eos> When will the next flashmob?
Knock, knock.<eos> How about this?<eos> You eat up all your food, we'll get you up and out of here and go take a walk.<eos> What do you say?<eos> You'd do good to be outside.<eos> You're pregnant?<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Uh, I don't really have a choice.<eos> You think it'll make a difference?<eos> Of course it will.
Place your bets, gentlemen.<eos> Red 9, odd and manque.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I couldn't stand it.<eos> How's it going? Awful.<eos> My God!<eos> I know.<eos> It's Swiss. We've been here four hours.<eos> If they keep losing, he'll have an attack.<eos> We all will.

You know, Sally and I have to retile the bathroom every six months.<eos> These guys were truly... truly brilliant architects.<eos> I just find it so ironic that there was once this magnificent civilization and now just these ruins.<eos> I...<eos> I call that futile feeling "Ozymandias melancholia".<eos> This is just kind of thing you wanna build?<eos> Oh, I would be very proud if I'd done this.<eos> Did you always wanna be an architect?<eos> Ah, you'll laugh if I tell you what my ambition is. What?<eos> No... no, I won't.
Oh, please, you've got to know that if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be able to go anywhere or do anything.<eos> It's going to happen.<eos> I know.<eos> Soon.<eos> All right?<eos> So what was it like there?<eos> Big, lots of buildings.<eos> I got a bit lost.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> -We will?
Is this about saving my life again?<eos> Because we're past that.<eos> You said you wanted to wait until your marriage was over.<eos> Now it's over.<eos> Chuck, I don't blame you.<eos> And as crazy as this all has gotten,<eos> I know why you did everything.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And I love you.<eos> I always will.
I just want things to be normal.<eos> I want to close my eyes to you, wake up to you, and live our lives together.<eos> There's nothing I want more than that.<eos> And maybe a psychiatrist can get us there.<eos> ♪ I can see you shine yeah.<eos> ♪ The hands of time... But I'm hoping this new medication does the trick, because if it's physical, I'm sick.<eos> But if it's in my head, I'm just crazy.<eos> You're not crazy.<eos> Well...

It's not good enough. It's a nightmare.<eos> - I really think I should just come back. - No.<eos> No, there's gotta be something more I can do.<eos> No, you're doing it.<eos> I need you to take the kids out of the house before I completely lose it and Jamie realizes how bad things are.<eos> Look, they'll be happier with you guys.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And as soon as Nathan comes home you'll be a family again.<eos> And he will, Haley.
Yeah.<eos> And we know for sure that at least some of the vics hooked up with strange women days before being killed Amazon style.<eos> Hooked up in the same bar I met Lydia, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then suddenly, she's got a little baby in like fruit-fly time.<eos> That baby turns into a little girl just as fast.<eos> - So maybe you're - - Don't say it.<eos> Look, if that kid's yours -<eos> I said don't say it!<eos> Fine. I won't.

Hey, stay away from him!<eos> Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.<eos> This isn't about the money.<eos> I just want justice for my father.<eos> Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed.<eos> Dangerous people. My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
!<eos> His chair's wobbly. Oh, okay.<eos> Let me get you a book of matches to put under there.<eos> I don't want to sit on a pile of matches.<eos> Dennis, it's not like your chair's gonna catch on fire.<eos> Oh, Christ, I'm not worried about my chair catching on fire.<eos> Look, sir, can you just get us a better table in general? Unfortunately, no.<eos> We're fully booked tonight due to a Groupon deal.<eos> Oh, that sounds excellent. We'll have one of those.<eos> No, we won't.
No, no one's going to hang you.<eos> No one's going to hang, child. No one's going to hang.<eos> I should've killed the man myself, when I had the chance.<eos> How... how did he find you?<eos> Mrs. Haverford gave me to him.<eos> Hold me.<eos> I swear, I don't know if I'm feverish or freezing.<eos> Oh, please, tell me everything's going to be all right, Kevin.<eos> Even if it won't.<eos> Even if it won't.
Kicking it around.<eos> You got plans tomorrow night?<eos> Uh, no. Uh, I'm not working.<eos> I'm completely free.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Well, Avery's got a gig at the 5 spot.<eos> You should come.<eos> Bring anyone you want.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'll... I'll...
That is significant.<eos> The unsub knows this place.<eos> Could be a former patient.<eos> I'll have Garcia pull up a list.<eos> We, uh, photographed all the walls, and we're running a paint analysis to find the most recent graffiti.<eos> Maybe a tagger saw something... or the unsub left his mark.<eos> My son.<eos> You've been so brave.<eos> I have no fear.<eos> You will.
The press is so base these days.<eos> Excuse me. Hello.<eos> Is this the Post?<eos> Wait!<eos> I work with Peter. I set up a shell corporation.<eos> We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!

'See you, son.'<eos> He didn't die because of anything the surgeon did.<eos> He... He had another massive stroke.<eos> I don't want close my eyes.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I understand.<eos> But time is running out for us.<eos> I'm sorry but we have to do this soon.<eos> You'll wake up.<eos> You will.
You waited to see if I would go to the scene.<eos> Which you did.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Must have known you'd have people watching the place. My parole officer knows where I'm staying.<eos> I knew I would be arrested within minutes, so why go back?<eos> Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
I believe I can make Downton safe for our children, if we ever have any.<eos> But I can only do it if you're with me.<eos> But what about Papa?<eos> I do love him.<eos> Love him by all means, but believe in me.<eos> There.<eos> Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
Yeah.<eos> See, that's a "c" word.<eos> I've been through this routine before, doc.<eos> I really think we should just leave that one alone.<eos> You need a C.T. scan.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Todd...<eos> Seriously, just-just drop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
- Dufton.<eos> Hey.<eos> Dufton?<eos> Dufton, aye.<eos> Unless you want to pay the bob back and make a day of it.<eos> Hello.<eos> I used to live here, you know.<eos> The Lamptons.<eos> Do you remember them?<eos> Your Mum and Dad will.
It were just a bit of fun.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Still alive.<eos> Oh, God. Still fucking alive.<eos> You can't actually see our house from here, can you?<eos> We're further up.<eos> I'll miss it.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
I was.<eos> I wanted to serve my country.<eos> Now you got crack pots hijacking airplanes, you got college students calling us vets "baby killers,"<eos> and it just feels like... it feels like the world is being turned upside down, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Steve, what if I were to tell you that you could help bring D.B. Cooper to justice?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is, how would you like a job?<eos> And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office, so help me God.<eos> That I will well...
Your friend at the Pentagon identified him? No.<eos> I spent the day going to homeless shelters.<eos> Turns out a lot of guys from Desert Storm ended up going to the one on Carlton Street.<eos> They kept his effects for over ten years?<eos> The woman who runs the place-- she believes that, uh, these guys would come back and have a normal life.<eos> Have you contacted his wife?<eos> I'm gonna see her tomorrow morning.<eos> She hasn't seen him in over 15 years.<eos> I need to know what happened to him, Bones.<eos> You will, Booth.
Thanks for the rope.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Don't move a muscle, friend.<eos> Here now, I'd say that was a job well done.<eos> Now, let's see.<eos> What have we here?<eos> Ah, gold.<eos> All this taxed from the poor so that the rich can get richer.<eos> It simply will not do.<eos> Oh, yes, it will.
And recently, I've been struggling with my faith, wondering if I really belong in the church, and it made me think of you and your tragedy.<eos> I thought if I came...<eos> And here you are.<eos> Hank struggled, too.<eos> Um... for a long time, he... he wanted to get revenge on the bastard who ran her over, but I told him,<eos> "Hank, our Missy came home to us with a few broken bones.<eos> We get to live with our daughter.<eos> The monster who left her there has to live with himself."<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
You think that I'd let you live after everything you've done?<eos> Castle!<eos> Come on.<eos> I want you to watch.<eos> I want you to watch as I take her life.<eos> Over here.<eos> Move that perimeter back on the beach Another 4 or 5.<eos> The water's pretty murky. Haven't seen anything yet.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
His whereabouts are currently unknown.<eos> News of Briggs's escape first broke on Telemundo, if you can believe that.<eos> Escapo!<eos> Escapo!<eos> Escapo!<eos> Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Joe, they'll get him back.<eos> No, they won't!
Jack is right.<eos> Chuck and Blair hold hands?<eos> Chuck and Blair go to the movies?<eos> You said you never wanted us to be boring.<eos> Well, we definitely aren't that now.<eos> I was a stupid child when I said those things.<eos> Life with you could never be boring.<eos> Blair Cornelia Waldorf, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
15 years... it's crazy.<eos> Well, we'll, uh, let you have some time alone.<eos> - You don't have to go.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> We were just leaving.<eos> I guess I'll see you in a couple weeks.<eos> Yeah, I'll see you there.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> It usually happens first few months after being on the job.<eos> But you will.
I'd work on their computers after school.<eos> It's only a 30-minute drive, and I'd go straight there.<eos> And you'd only work in the campaign office?<eos> Yes, Mom, and I'd still do my homework afterwards, everything,<eos> Should I come back?<eos> No, we're fine.<eos> Okay, I'll think about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You will?<eos> I will.
"1/2 plus 1/4th "is equal... To..."<eos> Is equal to 3/4ths.<eos> Sydney, okay.<eos> Take your homework and go upstairs.<eos> - Yeah, but I was helping.<eos> - You were not h... okay.<eos> This is not a punishment, but go upstairs, please.<eos> Victor and I need some alone time to work on this.<eos> I'll do this later.<eos> No, you won't, Victor.
They've been scrubbed.<eos> This will do.<eos> I have one more thing to pass on.<eos> Our superiors are worried, and they want to accelerate the schedule.<eos> I told them I work on my own schedule.<eos> I've planned this out with extreme precision.<eos> Your arrival today has thrown everything off.<eos> It was just four minutes.<eos> I'll tell you what, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Oh, Daddy, I wanted to spend tonight in the city with you guys.<eos> Wait.<eos> I got this.<eos> I'll take care of the tree.<eos> You have a family night in Manhattan.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We brought the tree all the way down.<eos> It has to look perfect on Christmas morning.<eos> Carlos, it will.
Good linen.<eos> Could you perhaps... - I mean...<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - Can't you move a little faster?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I must find them.<eos> - The two ladies are gone.<eos> I can see that, but I want to find them.<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> - Ah, but I will!
- My sister...<eos> - You have no sister!<eos> - It's not true!<eos> - My sister played Chekhov for many years,<eos> I know it by heart.<eos> - 밫he Seagull? ..<eos> - Masha!<eos> Masha, confidently:.<eos> 밐e will, ask him for them...<eos> He will.?

I'm not embarrassed to have people over anymore.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're not having people over.<eos> Can one of you take me to the library?<eos> Brick, do you not even notice what they did?<eos> Weird.<eos> So can one of you take me to the library?<eos> I feel like reading about Peru.<eos> No, brick, sorry. Can't.<eos> Actually, won't.
I don't know.<eos> I went to look for it the other day and it was gone.<eos> I-I should have called the cops.<eos> Okay, so does anyone want to speak up?<eos> That's not ours.<eos> At least it's not mine.<eos> No, it's not mine, either.<eos> Someone is trying to frame us.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> Well, we will soon.
Mine had the nerve to die before I got back from basic with skills and a loaded weapon.<eos> You didn't miss much.<eos> I thought it was gonna be way more fun than it was.<eos> - You heading out?<eos> - In a minute.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Don't.<eos> You having any second thoughts about the shooting?<eos> Not really.<eos> You will.
We must stand together.<eos> We're responsible for each other, as individuals.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> You have to come with me.<eos> I want you to.<eos> Now you do, but in a week?<eos> A month?<eos> I'll still want you Heinz.<eos> Heinz.<eos> Of course I will.
- She does look lovely.<eos> - She sure does.<eos> She'll be going out live, nationwide, from the NBC studio in Hollywood.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> She called you?<eos> She called me up, and told me the good news!<eos> And she'll call you up, too. Of course she will.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She won't call me.<eos> Sure she will.
But no, I get things done.<eos> You know, it's amazing what a war wound will do.<eos> Even Robert Carne can't touch me.<eos> When he starts in on his "socialist parasites" I just cough in my sleeve and he pipes down.<eos> That is shocking.<eos> Well, if it gets the people round here what they need, I'm not proud.<eos> I thought I'd won Mr Carne round but he really savaged me tonight, didn't he?<eos> He's the past and you're the future, and he knows it.<eos> He knows things have got to change.<eos> And with this new housing scheme, by God they will!
There's nothing to be afraid of, I'll take care of everything.<eos> No you won't, Father.<eos> I see what's happening.<eos> I see who's fighting the war, who's shooting innocent villagers.<eos> We need help.<eos> What help?<eos> Our neighbours are all hiding in their little estates.<eos> They have mass said every day to pray that I'll be enough to satiate the soldiers.<eos> There's not going to be any help.<eos> Yes there will...
Impossible.<eos> I have been here for more years than I care to remember.<eos> I am a jedi.<eos> We don't give up easily.<eos> Jedi?<eos> But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will.
Yeah, she's my flatmate.<eos> She's all right, she keeps out the way.<eos> - I quite liked her.<eos> - Yeah, she's a good girl.<eos> Well, thank you for this afternoon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I'll give you a call later.<eos> - OK.<eos> - OK.<eos> I will.
Since when do you worry about that?<eos> Do you never get tired of this movie? No. No.<eos> It's Kirk, for God sakes.<eos> I'm gonna have to run back upstairs.<eos> Do you want me to leave?<eos> If my husband were sleeping with Mary, she wouldn't be on my guest list.<eos> Jackie puts up with it.<eos> She must figure if it's inevitable, she might as well make it convenient.<eos> Mrs. Kennedy, will the President be returning?<eos> No, he won't.
But when he does, whoever he calls will be calling me.<eos> Because you scared the shit out of them.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you'd like to send them a nice little bouquet when all this is worked out.<eos> It's not Stanley knives keeps people loyal, Jay.<eos> It's them putting that in there and us giving them the means to do it.<eos> Yeah, well. Let's just see who they call, shall we?<eos> All this just to find Andy Dixon?<eos> - He was there.<eos> - What if he's got nothing to say?<eos> Oh, he will.
Not so good.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> No, I suppose I don't.<eos> But I want you to know something. I know that I've talked about slowing down and taking our time, but I want you to know that whenever we do get pregnant, that's gonna be a great day.<eos> And I'll be more than okay with it.<eos> ♪ Planes crashing and burn around us ♪<eos> We're not gonna have that day.<eos> Baby, we will.<eos> No, we won't.
Every day I waited for him to come and rescue me, and he never did. Who, Danny?<eos> So this is all about your brother?<eos> Not any more.<eos> So this has nothing to do with the anomalies?<eos> This is just because you wanted to punish Danny?<eos> Why are you so interested in me?<eos> I thought you were somebody else, but I was wrong.<eos> That should hold him until you figure out what's going on and we can send him back home for good.<eos> If I figure out what's going on.<eos> You will.
I can't relate to you telling me you're planning to commit suicide.<eos> Is that what you're saying?<eos> What do you think it'll do to your parents?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They'd assume it's an OD.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> You've had these thoughts before.<eos> They've always passed.<eos> It's hell while it lasts, but... It'll get better. Everything will be fine.<eos> Except it won't.
Mitsuko, watch.<eos> I'm fucking my own husband now.<eos> Izumi, why...?<eos> Izumi, stop...<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> If you fuck a man you don't love, make him pay!<eos> - Will you ask him for money?<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> - With that, love ends.<eos> - Yes! I will!
To kill.<eos> I provide it with whatever it needs, and what it needs the most are children.<eos> Little lambs.<eos> To replace those that were sacrificed to adulthood.<eos> Just tell me one thing.<eos> How do we get out of this house?<eos> When it's asleep.<eos> Great.<eos> How do we know if it's asleep?<eos> You won't.
Good.<eos> I'll just fetch my valise.<eos> It's a "bag".<eos> Bad do, Anna.<eos> Bad bloody do all round.<eos> Set?<eos> 'It's thick. The snow.'<eos> 'Me dad said the mummers might come by later. 'Carol us, under the window.'<eos> 'That would be nice.'<eos> 'They probably won't.
We like to think of ourselves as more alternative.<eos> So where do you live?<eos> I've got about three roommates up on the north side. It's kind of a house, but it's kind of falling apart.<eos> It's kind of a house, but it's kind of falling apart.<eos> Yes, ma'am. I think that describes your life right now, honey.<eos> American literature is clear.<eos> Arts and artists clear.<eos> Stewart, feel like we should make it official t-shirt like an after party t-shirt?<eos> Oh, I have a good design for the t-shirt.<eos> How about "we'll never
They banned hunting.<eos> Was it a shotgun, then?<eos> No, a pistol.<eos> Eh, I could show you the postmortem photographs if you like.<eos> Not when I'm about to eat.<eos> Ta, mate.<eos> I've got a feeling about this one. There's something a bit special, something a bit different.<eos> It'll be a real feather in your cap if you solve it.<eos> What do you mean, if?<eos> Of course you will.
About Ian.<eos> How could he have sex with me and then go back to stupid Jessica?<eos> Uh, Becky, please.<eos> Ian is a sack.<eos> Really, that guy's a nobody.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Then why do I feel like this?<eos> Because you don't know that you're better than him.<eos> Yet.<eos> But you will.
I wish it didn't have to end.<eos> Well, it's not over yet.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're right, Carol. It was a wonderful date.<eos> And I want to have a million more, every night of the week for the rest of my life.<eos> Carol Yastrzemski-- oh, please, let that be your last name-- will you marry me?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, Adam.<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Adam, I will!
No heroes out there. Observe and report only.<eos> Leave the hairy stuff to us cops.<eos> We've got better insurance than you do. Great!<eos> OK, so the sign-up sheet is being passed around.<eos> Those are mine.<eos> ...until we catch this guy. Let's do it.<eos> So, go ahead.<eos> Live forever.<eos> Forget what you've forgotten.<eos> But they won't.
Because Abu Nazir is playing the long game.<eos> This way, no one suspects a thing. Except you.<eos> Yeah, except me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Sergeant Brody's due home from Germany tomorrow morning, which gives us just under 22 hours.<eos> To do what?<eos> To authorize a surveillance package.<eos> To tap his phones, wire his house, follow him wherever he goes.<eos> David will never sign off on that and you know it.<eos> Of course he won't.
Used it for what?<eos> You remember how we used to say that being a vampire was almost perfect?<eos> But the lying, the hiding, the stifling day job to cover our tracks is exhausting and tedious.<eos> When we have the numbers and we have the power, we won't have to hide. We can live right out in the open.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.<eos> How many times have you drilled it into me?<eos> Keep a low profile, blend in, be invisible.<eos> 'Cause we had to.<eos> Soon we won't.
Type.<eos> You're gonna kill people, aren't you?<eos> Only the responsible ones.<eos> Look, if I do this, you have to promise to leave Scott out of it.<eos> Do you know why wolves hunt in packs?<eos> It's because their favored prey are too large to be brought down by one wolf alone.<eos> I need Derek and Scott.<eos> I need both of them.<eos> He's not gonna help you.<eos> Oh, he will.
You kill bloodthirsty monsters for a living, and now you're telling me you're nervous about a couple little ten-year-olds?<eos> They're five.<eos> Do you know anything about kindergarten...<eos> - Or my kids?<eos> - What's to know, man?<eos> You'll go in, all right?<eos> You'll do your little spiel. The kids will be picking their noses.<eos> We'll get out of there, and it'll be awesome.<eos> You know, you don't have to come at all.<eos> Well, maybe I won't, all right?
I'm going down.<eos> I'm going down the escalator. Okay.<eos> Look, I'm Stubeck.<eos> "Oh, I'm gonna shoot a zombie."<eos> Billy, put that gun away!<eos> Don't wave that gun in front of the children! All right, all right, all right.<eos> You want to see some juggling?<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> You guys ever seen the inside of a jail cell?<eos> You will.
- Okay, we're done here.<eos> No, wait, wait, don't hang...<eos> Five thousand?<eos> For Pam? I bet you spent 10 times that on your new conference table.<eos> I did not.<eos> Unless you include the funeral expenses for those pygmies.<eos> And I bet that sneaky little chief just dumped them all into one medium-sized hole.<eos> Well, I was able to trace the call to a one-block radius. So if you will excuse me, I am going to rescue Pam.<eos> I will do that.<eos> No, I will.
You even kiss Piti's arms?<eos> When it's tender, yes.<eos> And I also give him a spank on the ass when crossing corridors.<eos> Yeah...<eos> - But at the moment my butt is off-limits.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What will happen with Julia?<eos> I can not talk to her.<eos> I don't want to be like a tsunami that destroys everything.<eos> I won't.
Why does he want me to do it?<eos> Cos you won't get stopped. I could easily get stopped.<eos> Why don't you do it?<eos> I would but he wants you to do it.<eos> They'd know me anyway.<eos> If I got caught with he court case coming up, it wouldn't look good.<eos> Would they not know me then if they know you?<eos> They wouldn't be looking out for you.<eos> What if I get arrested?<eos> You won't.
It's taken.<eos> I'm, I'm a nonsmoker, good credit, no pets, call me back.<eos> Nice try, nice try, but I already left a message.<eos> Looks like the bull bucked you off, son.<eos> Okay, Dad.<eos> Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and...<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh...<eos> I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.
Go to sleep, it's late.<eos> Will you tell?<eos> You are not a child!<eos> Anyways tell me.<eos> Once during a fight two pilots saw storks, "leleky", coming back home, and they had a front line ahead.<eos> Explosion, smoke, fire...<eos> And then our father and uncle Kolya decided to escort them...<eos> Will father come back?<eos> Yes.<eos> When will all the birds.
Hmm.<eos> "Live to fight another day."<eos> Hmm? It's something we used to say.<eos> Navy Seals.<eos> Ooh.<eos> You were in the Seals.<eos> All right.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Hasani wants to see you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I shoulda asked myself what you were doing turning up at a dope factory with an empty truck.<eos> It's like I said, we're just here to keep the peace, not save the world.<eos> And if we can make a little money on the side, then so be it.<eos> You're a fucking embarrassment to our country in that uniform!<eos> Maybe, but tomorrow I'll still be alive.<eos> And fucking rich.<eos> - I'll be seeing you, buddy.<eos> - No you won't.
Only the best for my baby.<eos> I'm stuffed.<eos> There's always room...<eos> For bling.<eos> When I met you... I thought you were a hot piece of ass.<eos> But now that I know you, you are the hot piece of ass... that I wanna spend the rest of my life with.<eos> Oh, jeriba.<eos> Okay, dad.<eos> Breathe. Try and keep it together in there.<eos> I will, son.
No injured.<eos> So you're right about the diversion, although I don't get it.<eos> Cops are a step behind him, and he drops by a hostel?<eos> The manager said he came in with some kind of package - an envelope.<eos> Let's track it down, Wordy.<eos> Boss, we've got the feds on visual link.<eos> Agent Gilbride.<eos> 'Kay, I'll be right there.<eos> So, you got my guy up there?<eos> We will soon.
Jake, you've got to help me here.<eos> He wants to plead guilty.<eos> So let him.<eos> That's an entire case off my workload.<eos> But he's not guilty of murder.<eos> I think his brother might disagree with you.<eos> No, he wouldn't. Abraham Roach defended himself but he didn't mean to kill his own brother.<eos> Your client's the one pleading guilty.<eos> Yes, because he feels guilty.<eos> He will for the rest of his life.
No, it's not your fault.<eos> I feel responsible.<eos> Well, don't.<eos> We met on a case.<eos> But we could have met at work.<eos> Listen, I... I'm thinking about going away.<eos> You know, like your sister, just... chucking my stuff in a backpack and going.<eos> What about the case?<eos> Who's gonna look after me?<eos> Ronnie will.
- I'm not, I'm not.<eos> I'm not leaving her here.<eos> This is my house, okay?<eos> - That's great.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> I've never met you.<eos> So I'm asking you to leave, all right? She's drunk, I'm taking her right now.<eos> No, you need to go right now.<eos> - Just--don't touch me.<eos> - No, now I will.
Barb!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You've been at this school two hours and you've already heard that rotten story.<eos> All we did was make out.<eos> He wanted to go further, but I wouldn't.<eos> So it's a lie.<eos> Of course it's a lie.<eos> But it doesn't matter, because everyone believes it and now I've been branded a slut.<eos> I know it feels like the end of the world, but it's a rumour and it'll pass.<eos> No it won't.
Still no word as to what caused the former soul titan to put his faith in such a pathetic loser.<eos> What she doesn't know is that before I gave up my soul, this pathetic loser sold Aldremach short.<eos> Dr. Feelgood's Wellness Clinic, tomorrow morning.<eos> Before heading to the soul extraction lab, I stopped by my local soul broker and bet on Aldremach's stock to plummet.<eos> After that, it was a simple matter of devaluing my own soul.<eos> I spent the entire night debauching myself through acts I never thought I would be capable of.<eos> I had to choke down my inherent morality and remind myself that I was doing it for the greater good, although I did catch myself having some fun at Charlie Sheen's place.<eos> You know, he's nice, and he parties hard.<eos> By morning, I was confident I had rendered my soul totally worthless.<eos> A reverse grinching, if you will.
Don't worry, I'm sure won't have to keep it up for much longer.<eos> Stay close!<eos> Head for those trees. We'll cover you.<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Now what?<eos> Now it's our turn.<eos> Who will cover us?<eos> Don't be a simpleton, Merlin.<eos> They haven't found the cargo.<eos> They will.
Do you know how to use that wand, mister...<eos> Rumplestiltskin.<eos> And, yes, of course I do.<eos> Then help me.<eos> Well, if I do, and you can indeed shoulder the, uh... consequences, then you'll owe me a favor.<eos> Name it.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Something precious.<eos> But I have nothing.<eos> Oh, but you will.
He wanted to have the house torn down right after those murders, but it was declared a landmark.<eos> So he used that passageway to scare off tenants like the Boyers, growing the mansion's legend so that no one would want to live there.<eos> And then when Jack Sinclair came sniffing around, he had to kill him, too.<eos> You guys.<eos> Great story. The DA will never buy it.<eos> It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
There will be a strong case against them, I fear.<eos> It will not stand against the truth.<eos> My husband and my brother were in my house when the breaking was done.<eos> We talked into the night.<eos> It was said that Mr Bambridge's house was broke into at midnight. We had not gone to our beds at that time.<eos> And there was no-one else there who might say so?<eos> Why would there be?<eos> What did he read from?<eos> The psalms.<eos> So will I.
Hi.<eos> Neal?<eos> Lily?<eos> A year ago,<eos> I came here to a wedding I didn't want to go to and I knew that night that I had met my wife.<eos> You make all of my days better and I don't ever want to spend another one without you.<eos> Lily...<eos> Tonight, back where I first set eyes on you, in front of all of our... friends, will you please...<eos> say that you'll marry me?<eos> Yes, I will.
I mean, you could get a splinter.<eos> - I'm gonna go get your slippers. - You're...<eos> - You're starting again.<eos> - I told you I wasn't going to stop.<eos> Do you want the ones with the little bunny ears, or the slipper socks? - What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going to wear them.<eos> I'm not going to pull a splinter out of your feet.<eos> - I don't have a splinter. - You will!<eos> - No, I won't.
BECKY:<eos> Excuse me. We're talking to you!<eos> Leave it, Paul.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> DARREN: Paul. They're disrespecting you.<eos> PAUL:<eos> Are you listening to me or am I gonna have to come over there and shout it in your fucking brains?<eos> BECKY GROANS MAN: Go back inside.<eos> PAUL:<eos> No! I won't!
I wanted to ask that dude something.<eos> Why did I hide?<eos> You pull yourself together too.<eos> I really hope that because of Gu Ae Jeong you won't display anything above 100 on your display again in the future.<eos> That's right.<eos> The normal heart rate should be between 60 to 90.<eos> Let's maintain that.<eos> My control time...<eos> Oh, the iron man's artificial heart will not race willfully.<eos> It will not.

Try what?<eos> To perform it once.<eos> Although there's no great stage or audience, as long as Director Kim helps us, I think we can do it ourselves.<eos> Han Hui Ju isn't available though.<eos> We have you.<eos> Why do we need Han Hui Ju?<eos> Let's just do it.<eos> Isn't it a waste of what we practiced before?<eos> Do you think the other kids will support this?<eos> At least The Stupid and Windflower will.
Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press, referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.<eos> Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.<eos> He did so publicly.<eos> The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.<eos> No argument there.<eos> And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.<eos> That they do.<eos> Come on.<eos> Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.<eos> This "junkyard dog," if you will.
He has never disappointed me.<eos> The prize is near, Father.<eos> Soon you will have not only the mask, but the blood to fill it.<eos> Marique, how your mother yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.<eos> Imagine the secrets she will bring back from the realm of the dead.<eos> And imagine how indomitable I will become when she's once again by my side.<eos> Father... If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...<eos> It will not fail.<eos> If it does...<eos> It will not!
I'm not stupid, William.<eos> Three dead bodies and a pocket full of money?<eos> Doesn't take a genius to work out what the pair of you have been up to.<eos> I think it's the best bloody idea you've ever had.<eos> One condition...<eos> I want a pound for every body you sell.<eos> A pound?<eos> - Man starts getting fancy clothes... also starts getting fancy ideas.<eos> Just think of it as a tax between a man and a wife.<eos> A kind of nuptial agreement, if you will.
Yo, check this out!<eos> There's a whole grove of trees back there loaded with these things.<eos> It's like a kiwi.<eos> We'll take it back and do an edibility test...<eos> I'll do one right now.<eos> Greer!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> That's nice.<eos> We don't even know if it's poisonous.<eos> We will.
He's the best at this. This is how he makes a living.<eos> Listen, your father never has to know that you got burned. Your dad never has to find out.<eos> - He was sweet on you, right? - Yeah, but...<eos> He didn't see you with me just now, right?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What would he do if you went in there and sat on his lap?<eos> What would you do?<eos> I think this'll work.<eos> - This will never work.<eos> - Of course it will.
Come.<eos> I think over again my small adventures, my fears, those small ones that seemed so big.<eos> For all the vital things I had to get and reach, and yet there is only one great thing, the only thing, to live to see the great day that dawns and the light that fills the world.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> That's because that shit is Inuit.<eos> And we all is used to lesser religions.<eos> I'm gonna have to sit this one out.<eos> I guess I don't have the endurance that you all have.<eos> Oh, not to worry.<eos> You will one day.
Sydney won't go to her superiors with his identity Until she definitively knows Whether she has turned him or burned him.<eos> When sydney contacts him, He'll do what she says just long enough for us To track her, find her and bring her in.<eos> You mean I have to do what she says? No, you don't.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> This is my family we're talking about here.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's the only way to keep him safe.<eos> Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way.<eos> If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you.<eos> I will, devon.
I've done sea bass. Do you like it?<eos> I forgot the champagne.<eos> If you can find a bottle...<eos> Emilie, it's Jean.<eos> My third call. I suppose you'd rather not speak to me.<eos> I'm going to tell your mother what you couldn't.<eos> Leaving you was hard. Losing you is terrible. Goodbye.<eos> For good.<eos> For a second, I was afraid you were making me suffer.<eos> You won't, will you?
I know you're in this blush of rekindled love, but you can't count on him.<eos> What happens when you guys break up again?<eos> When?<eos> I told you, it's not like freshman year.<eos> Why are you being so cynical, Ash?<eos> I'm being realistic.<eos> I know in your mind, it's going to last forever.<eos> But I've been watching this dance between you and Cappie for years.<eos> Will they?<eos> Won't they?
Yes.<eos> This show delivers.<eos> Maybe you could ask the guys to bring some of their money too.<eos> They never want to.<eos> - I'll take that.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> Enjoy your evening, sir.<eos> And I'll take your ring.<eos> My wedding ring?<eos> The hell you will.
Yeah. I know. And-And i thank you.<eos> Uh... i'm going with someone else-<eos> Serena, actually.<eos> We're old friends from boarding school.<eos> Serena's with nate now.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> She's the one who called and asked me, so... well, you know she's changed since boarding school,<eos> And, uh, there's-There's no way she's gonna go to a state dinner Wearing a jacket filled with pills.<eos> I probably won't tell her about that then.<eos> Well, then maybe i will.
It's a slam dunk.<eos> A court case would be a p.R. Nightmare.<eos> We ave to settle.<eos> You'll take care of it?<eos> Settlements are for the guilty- Celebrities who run people over, the catholic church. It's not fair.<eos> The historical society is honoring my father tonight.<eos> I can't have this overshadowing the evening Or anything else.<eos> This way, the case will be sealed.<eos> The press won't know.<eos> No one will.
We'II give you discounts.<eos> Buy them.<eos> You lousy sons of bitches.<eos> Go away, my team will win.<eos> Go to the other side.<eos> Ramos!<eos> KIM, what have you done to the kids?<eos> Wow!<eos> We're gonna win!<eos> We will!
Here it is.<eos> Would you like to see my work?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Isn't it a little bit long?<eos> That's OK guys, thanks.<eos> -l still can't believe you're getting married.<eos> -Me, neither!<eos> This means you will leave now and not return back home with us, right?<eos> Hey, don't be ridiculous, nothing will change.<eos> -lt won't, right?
Wayne...<eos> What's up?<eos> I love you.<eos> But I think I love the job more.<eos> Well, job's not a problem.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> You'd be leaving the unit... for us.<eos> I don't want that responsibility.<eos> You'll hate me for it.<eos> Maybe not today, but someday you will.
Well, I'm-I'm breaking all my rules coming down here, but nobody stands me up like that.<eos> So, are we going out or what?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... I made a promise to a friend.<eos> I have to say no.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You're trying the "no" thing on me.<eos> You really think that's going to work?<eos> 'Cause it won't.
Have you called last looks for hair and makeup yet? No. Why?<eos> Brooke, what the hell happened today?<eos> I thought you fell for Alex.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I met an agent.<eos> He'll either sign me or marry me.<eos> Either way, this just might be the first day of the rest of my life.<eos> I... I can't represent you.<eos> He decided to sign you?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
You are.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> It's about business.<eos> There's no business in here, son.<eos> We may have lost Lucky Strike.<eos> I'm sure this agency was a thrill, but you've had your folly.<eos> That's not right, Tom.<eos> I haven't stayed at Vick Chemical for 28 years because I love it.<eos> It's because I have a family.<eos> And any minute here, you will, too.
Okay, Gabriel, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Back--back to bed. Let's go.<eos> Not the other one. I need my shoes.<eos> Remember?<eos> Your shoes didn't fit.<eos> That's why your feet were bleeding.<eos> But I liked those shoes. I know.<eos> We'll get you some more shoes.<eos> We will.
Excellency.<eos> You are not well?<eos> These days I suffer a little from gout, Lady Mary.<eos> - Please sit. - Thank you.<eos> You are and always have been... my most faithful... and truest friend in all this world.<eos> I could not bear it if you were ever to leave here.<eos> He ought not to have divorced the Lady Anne.<eos> Now that I know her better, I think she is perfectly sweet and gracious.<eos> Nevertheless, Lady Mary, I fear that you will have to reconcile yourself to the new Queen.<eos> No, I will not.
She hasn't said the safeword yet.<eos> What happened between Steven and me... It wasn't love.<eos> What was it? Just sex?<eos> Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes!<eos> I mean... I-it was just a moment of weakness.<eos> And I promise you, it will never, ever happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Oh, you don't get to play.<eos> I've known these idiots for years. They know my dirt, but I also know theirs.<eos> Did you know that in high school, The boys called jules "slug tongue"<eos> Because of how she kissed?<eos> I didn't have a sister.<eos> No one taught me.<eos> Laugh!<eos> Still horsey.<eos> It's not fair. Don't know anything about your past.<eos> And you never will.
Sorry iouldn't be more help, officer -- or should I say, "Marshal"?<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, give me, uh, 24 pieces as spicy as you got.<eos> We're closed.<eos> All right, I'm a deputy U.S. Marshal, ordering you to give me some chicken.<eos> I shut down --<eos> What's that?<eos> That's the last order for delivery.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Like hell you will!
GPS tracker?<eos> We only tagged Deeks' car.<eos> And we found it a couple blocks away from our safe house.<eos> We have protocols for this kind of situation, and Deeks hasn't responded to any of them.<eos> Who spoke to him last?<eos> I did.<eos> Regular debrief.<eos> Shared intel.<eos> Need to know everything.<eos> And you will.
I think we should just talk tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Look, I'm - - I'm...<eos> It's fine.<eos> Are we okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> You know, you should have a little more faith in me.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will one day.
There's so much about me and Stefan that will never work.<eos> You know I'm here for you.<eos> You sure you guys don't want me there tonight?<eos> No, I need you to stay with Elena. I don't want her to know about this.<eos> Ok. I'll make sure she doesn't leave my sight.<eos> If anybody wants to back out,<eos> I'll understand.<eos> Yeah, cold feet speak now. I don't want this going wrong Because someone chickens out.<eos> Caroline?<eos> I won't.
It's okay on a school night, 'cause it's a school night?<eos> Oh, no, that's totally fine.<eos> I mean, of course it is, 'cause it's okay with me.<eos> That's really cool! How did you hear about this underground Ben Harper concert?<eos> Yes, please, enlighten us.<eos> You know, I just, um, you hear things, you know.<eos> You meet people.<eos> So, uh, I guess I'm cooler than you think, huh?<eos> We will see.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
Previously on The Tudors...<eos> Lady Anne of Cleves.<eos> Welcome to my court.<eos> Why did Your Majesty invite Lady Anne of Cleves for Christmas?<eos> I like her after all.<eos> He ought not to have divorced the Lady Anne.<eos> I fear that you will have to reconcile yourself to the new Queen.<eos> No, I will not.
I don't know about all that stuff.<eos> I know I want to do something.<eos> I don't want to take the rest of my life passively lying down.<eos> After my experience in hospital, I realised people's lives are dominated by monolithic institutions and their stupid rules and by petty martinets.<eos> I just want to help people stand up for themselves.<eos> Well put, Mountstuart, yeah. Good.<eos> Yeah. Good.<eos> Well, what you see here is SPK Working Circle - Communication.<eos> We're a small group.<eos> A cell, if you will. A cadre.
Juliet or Despereaux?<eos> Um, both I guess.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> They really found fingerprints?<eos> A lot of them, Shawn.<eos> Why?<eos> Don't you think Despereaux would have worn gloves?<eos> Welcome to the Gordon Mark Hotel.<eos> Will you need help with your bags?<eos> Yes, we will.
I would even pick them up at the pharmacy for him and bring them to him directly.<eos> Man, he's going to hear it at the office on Monday.<eos> Actually, your firm just suspended him until he completes a month's stay at a mental health facility.<eos> Wow. Who's going to get all his cases?<eos> We're available.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Spencer?<eos> Gus here is a whiz at LegalZoom. My cousin has a personal injury law firm called Accidentes.<eos> Heard of it?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> You will. You will.
I told you!<eos> You're a ghost!<eos> No, I'm not a ghost.<eos> I just have a really tiny bladder.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, totally unrelated to the ghost thing, drink the rest while your dummy sings "Camptown Races. "<eos> All right.<eos> Look at me, Chief.<eos> You'll see me in my sexy costume.<eos> Yes, you will.
It would make me sad, I do have my ethics, but hey, James Frey still has a book deal.<eos> And I want mine.<eos> What if there isn't anything to tell?<eos> Drugs, tunnels, murder...<eos> I know my fucking story.<eos> Who else knows we're here?<eos> My editor knows I found you, but I didn't tell him where.<eos> But if I was able to find you, how long before the bad guys find you?<eos> And I don't mean the FBI.<eos> Because they will.
Uh, congratulations.<eos> Look, I know how much you wanted things to work out with Sam.<eos> And I was hoping they would, too, especially given me and Violet.<eos> It would've been... nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would've been nice.<eos> If you ever want to talk... talking to you about what happened between me and Sam?<eos> I'd rather think about dead babies.<eos> I don't want this to sound patronizing, but you are gonna find someone great.<eos> You will.
You knew who they were. You could have saved us valuable time.<eos> Look, this job's about all I got, okay?<eos> And why would your job be affected? Well, maybe it wouldn't.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you don't interfere with basketball at this school.<eos> All right.<eos> Take my friend down to the terrace underneath the kid.<eos> Wordy and I are standing by.<eos> Boss, I don't see you.<eos> You will in a second.
Michael, I am just about to close a sale.<eos> Can I authorize a 15% discount? No, you may not.<eos> ERIN:<eos> I think it's really cool, Michael.<eos> I wish I had a job that I could just leave. Thank you.<eos> Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!<eos> I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.<eos> We're actually building them a school. Whatever.<eos> They need to learn.<eos> I won't...
Just download everything you can, and sit in the back of the Sushi bar, and I'll read your mind.<eos> Please.<eos> Please. No way.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna help you lie just so some guy will like you.<eos> But I told him I spoke Japanese. What I am supposed to do?<eos> I don't know, but you lied your way in.<eos> Stephanie Powell is still pursuing the late Dr. volson's research on the trilsettum coronis.<eos> It's imperative that I know why.<eos> You will.
What if I tell you and all the others to go fuck yourselves?<eos> Stop taking' the piss, Ruggero.<eos> I stopped to look at somethin' when I was on my way to Trentadenari's.<eos> And then you invented all that crap about Donatella. Well done.<eos> - I was ashamed to tell you.<eos> - If you were so ashamed... ..couldn't you have got the money back?<eos> I went lookin' for 'em, but couldn't find 'em.<eos> And while you were sticking it up his, did it not occur to you that he was sticking it up yours? Or were you already in front?<eos> - Who the fuck is this transvestite? - I don't know, but I'll find him.<eos> No, you won't.
Heather.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> Really.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you, but I really should be getting back.<eos> Can I ask you something? Of course.<eos> How do you know what the killer's family is thinking?<eos> You said they'll want to apologize?<eos> They will.
Then what do you want me to do?<eos> Comfort them.<eos> Huh?<eos> If there's anything they want, do them all.<eos> You can't send them with human strength.<eos> They have to walk off on their own.<eos> Did, did I ask them to come to me?<eos> For them to play around, so that I can't die, they are trying so hard to bug me.<eos> I can't!<eos> I won't!
Ah, this.<eos> I resigned after fighting with an annoying senior today.<eos> I should have done it earlier.<eos> I feel so lively.<eos> I will have a break for a while. I will watch some TV shows.<eos> I will be out for a while.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I heard about it.<eos> I will take care of it.<eos> No, I will.
Yeah.<eos> So, don't ask me why, but my parents want to meet you.<eos> They want you to come to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> It's stupid, so...<eos> I mean, it's not my idea.<eos> If you don't want to go, I'll just tell them that you don't want to go and that'll be the end of it.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> My parents won't like you.<eos> Why not?<eos> They just won't.
Baa!<eos> Baa!<eos> But I think you spilled something on your shirt there.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> Hello!<eos> Delicious lemonade, anyone?<eos> I<eos> - Yeah, I'll have one.<eos> - You will?
Oh, Beatrice, I buried this baby a long time ago... and I figured I'd find it again someday when I was ready.<eos> I still wish that I could go back and fix... all the stupid things I did when we were younger.<eos> I guess this is as close as I can get.<eos> You kept all this stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's my gum ball ring.<eos> Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else without you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> You will?
- You're too nice.<eos> - And this...<eos> This is for you.<eos> - I hope you like it.<eos> You wanna blow the candle out?<eos> Make a wish.<eos> These are some nice products.<eos> I use Olay.<eos> - I'll take it.<eos> - No, you will not.
It's all right.<eos> There has to be something I can do.<eos> You've already done everything for me, Fiona.<eos> You gave me a home and a family.<eos> You have kids?<eos> We have kids.<eos> Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named Felicia.<eos> - Felicia.<eos> I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.<eos> And someday you will.
Come on.<eos> Come on! What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't close that. Don't...<eos> If we live, I'll show you everything.<eos> We survived that blast, somewhat.<eos> And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped with his research, which I perfected and which you will now experience first-hand.<eos> Does Ana know about this?<eos> About you?<eos> No, and she never will.
What?<eos> How long have you known about this?<eos> They're not going to get anything out of him.<eos> He's unconscious in the hospital.<eos> There was a crash during a chase.<eos> Listen, the FBI recovered that database you told me about, the list of names.<eos> I'm in the process of deleting it.<eos> I'm going to erase every trace of it.<eos> I don't have to tell you what will happen if they get that list.<eos> They won't.
Think he'll find us?<eos> Do you wanna go look for him?<eos> - Where did you get the idea for this one?<eos> - My paintings always tell stories.<eos> This one's about a sad mother lion who can't find her cubs.<eos> - She's smiling.<eos> - She's dreaming about her babies.<eos> It's the only thing that makes her happy.<eos> - I hope she finds them.<eos> - She will.
If anybody wants to donate his organs, write it down also.<eos> - Organ donation?<eos> - Yes donation Ibo<eos> How's that supposed to work?<eos> Is that an order?<eos> No, I won't donate nothing.<eos> That just won't work.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Won't my heart die when I die?<eos> No it won't.
I don't want a normal life.<eos> I know what you want, Ruby.<eos> But it's not going to happen. You can't just smite your way into Luke's heart.<eos> The sooner you realise that, the better.<eos> I've never seen Galvin so angry.<eos> I mean, it's not like he's a relaxed kind of guy.<eos> I suppose this is different.<eos> You're not old enough to have enemies, Luke.<eos> Not...real ones.<eos> But you will, one day.
What are you worried about?<eos> You know sometimes, Mina, you love to create problems.<eos> I'm going after him and I'm going to kill him.<eos> I'm not trying to stop you, just be patient.<eos> We need more time. We have no more time.<eos> OK, I want you to stay here with Mina.<eos> When I get back, we'll think of a better plan.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> He'll come.<eos> No, he won't.
You-just stop, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Please, just stop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's just weird.<eos> I know it's weird.<eos> I don't want to have to discuss this with Peter.<eos> Well, you're not gonna do that.<eos> I will if I have to.<eos> No, you won't.
Okay, dollhouse. Doll freaking house.<eos> I'll keep saying it, it's fun to say.<eos> Dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse.<eos> You see the Borodins, you say it some more.<eos> You think you want to mess with the Borodins?<eos> No, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.<eos> There's one client I'm interested in.<eos> Find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched and you'll never see me again.<eos> I haven't seen you yet.<eos> You will.
Okay, thanks again, Mellie.<eos> Let's roll that back, please. I believe I spotted a tumescence at 3:21:04. Tell me what you think.<eos> Yeah, it ain't oak, but it's on its way to wood.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Go to Wednesday the 23rd, please.<eos> You know, I could burn these and you could just take them home.<eos> Go back.<eos> There.<eos> –Wait, freeze that.<eos> –I will not.
The effects are spreading.<eos> Mr. Dominic is exhibiting erratic behavior.<eos> (nervous laugh) He didn't take any.<eos> There's no way Dom would consciously try and have fun.<eos> It could be airborne.<eos> We'd be seeing a lot more cases on the campus.<eos> Beyond even.<eos> Exposure to a patient, whether viral, or through touch... that spreads more slowly, but pretty soon, that campus is gonna fill up with wacky time bombs.<eos> Well, we need to know what it is.<eos> Yes, well, we will...
Park here for a lifetime or so.<eos> Or... you can go and do something totally fucking amazing.<eos> What about you?<eos> I got my own plans.<eos> We're so perfect.<eos> Immaculate.<eos> Why did you show me this?<eos> Do you want to know what happens when you die?<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
I don't want to spend so much.<eos> I have to. I'm afraid Angie will divorce me if I ever have enough money for her to live off of half.<eos> So, before she can get it... I have to spend it all on useless things, like gold shoes and Grizz and Dotcom.<eos> Well, she she's not going to get half your money, Tracy.<eos> What does your pre-nup say?<eos> I don't got a pre-nup.<eos> When Angie and I got married, my only assets were a toaster oven and two tickets to a Young M.C. concert.<eos> You need to be protected. Let's bring Angie in here.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> A "post-nup", if you will.
You don't even know it.<eos> Your team is falling apart.<eos> You even know where they are.<eos> I do.<eos> Trouble is coming, Lieutenant.<eos> And it's looking for you.<eos> Calleigh.<eos> All right, Billy.<eos> I'm gonna see you real soon, okay?<eos> No, you won't.
That's why we'll save him for last.<eos> Well, I'm glad you've got my back.<eos> I'm glad to have it.<eos> Especially when it looks like that.<eos> Oh, that sounds perfect, Colby.<eos> Uh-huh, thanks. It's almost as if we planned it that way.<eos> All right, take it easy.<eos> So, Liz met with the second dealer.<eos> He's in. I really think this plan's gonna work.<eos> - Of course it will.
we still need the money.<eos> got my tea. oh, good.<eos> i think i heard that bird out front.<eos> i might not do things the way that you want me to, but you can't be betty bossypants when you're off at work all day. well, you know what, hilda?<eos> i only have to be betty bossypants when nothing gets done around here.<eos> and don't call me betty bossypants.<eos> well, then stop trying to control everything.<eos> look, you don't want to take papi to the city? fine.<eos> i'll do it. i'll take over.<eos> you'll what?
I think what you're going to feel is that you have goals in life now and a direction.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I woke up today feeling enthusiastic.<eos> My little boy, he's growing up.<eos> Come here.<eos> It's out of love that we kick your bum-- your bum.<eos> Sorry about the language.<eos> Have a good day at work, okay?<eos> I will, sweetheart.
He's sleeping.<eos> Oh, well, he'll want to see me. Baby! Yeah, he won't come.<eos> He's... he's really, really stupid.<eos> Oh, shy.<eos> He is shy. He is so shy.<eos> Oh, well, uh, i want to give him his new toy.<eos> You know, i'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> I have given him so many toys. But he'll want this one from his aunt dena.<eos> Won't you?<eos> Won't you, baby, huh?
- Drive lead?<eos> - Lead truck in the convoy.<eos> It's the most vulnerable to a roadside bomb.<eos> I had a friend die that way.<eos> I knew from the first time he came into my tent that if I said no, I'd be riving lead for a month.<eos> So you just took it.<eos> You never said no?<eos> Well, that's what you'll tell major harris.<eos> He'll never believe me.<eos> Sure he will.
Chloe would have done that for anyone.<eos> She believes in second chances.<eos> She doesn't actually have feelings for you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of what i am?<eos> I didn't want this, clark.<eos> I even killed myself to try to escape this life, but the darkness... it doesn't come out when chloe's around.<eos> She makes me... human.<eos> What happens when that changes?<eos> It won't.
Nothing.<eos> If it's gone, it's gone.<eos> Let's make one.<eos> How?<eos> I'm an electrician.<eos> Not gas?<eos> So sue me.<eos> She'll know for sure.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Yes, she will.
Who cares?<eos> It's October.<eos> I'll work harder.<eos> We're sending you to boarding school. Excuse me?<eos> In Coaticook, near Magog.<eos> It's a nice place, in the middle of nature.<eos> You'll find pictures on their website.<eos> The countryside will inspire you.<eos> You'll like it.<eos> No, I won't!
We were just dropping nate off.<eos> Just a way to say thank you For chatting to us about his big brother.<eos> And i thought it wouldn't hurt to see if you were free today To answer some questions.<eos> I'm crazy busy.<eos> I need to finish my yogurt.<eos> Then i was planning on working out.<eos> Well, until your calendar clears up, Just know i'm gonna make my way Through every friend, relative, and associate you have.<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> My friends and family don't know anything.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will.
- Nothing!<eos> Got rid of the kid and is living it up!<eos> You think I'm the babysitter?<eos> Here, see this?<eos> It's your kid - you take care of her!<eos> Just look at her!<eos> Doesn't even think of showing up!<eos> You want some sweet life?<eos> Not going to work!<eos> - Yes it will. - No it won't!
- Just Callen.<eos> Just Callen.<eos> Agent Callen.<eos> I didn't think you were due back from sick leave till next month.<eos> I guess you didn't get the email.<eos> I guess you haven't sent it yet.<eos> Your case is still active,Callen.<eos> We will find them.<eos> Yes,sir.<eos> We will.
You can and you will, then I'll leave you alone.<eos> Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.<eos> Please don't contact me again.<eos> - How was your weekend?<eos> - Short.<eos> - What did Michelson think of the contract?<eos> - He hasn't gotten back to me.<eos> That's because he didn't get it.<eos> Are you afraid you're going to have a boss?<eos> You will, the client.
- Thank you, Ari.<eos> - Good luck to you, Drama.<eos> And tell that man of yours to keep his eyes pinned wide open cos I'm gonna be gunning for him.<eos> I will.<eos> All right, Lloyd, I'll sign with you.<eos> Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker!<eos> - Calm down, Lloyd. - I can't.<eos> We're gonna make magic together, Johnny Drama.<eos> Let me just please get this show.<eos> You will.
But on this side, they've become more insidious.<eos> They have designed hybrids- Part organic tissue, part machine- that can do things that humans can't.<eos> They can change shapes, taking the form of human beings.<eos> Over here, they call them "the first wave. "<eos> So you're saying that these hybrids are already on our side.<eos> I know it's difficult to grasp.<eos> Oh, I can grasp it just fine.<eos> I don't trust you, Dr. Bell... or William or...<eos> Willam... or whatever cutesy name you think might appeal to my childhood instincts.<eos> It won't.
I don't want to go either.<eos> Have to watch Don Draper accept an award for his humanity?<eos> - Don is important.<eos> - You know, I found that guy working in a fur company, night school.<eos> And that girl, Betty.<eos> I remember Mona said they looked like they were on top of our wedding cake.<eos> - Screw him.<eos> - Have the party without me.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
And you know what?<eos> Finding someone like that is the holy grail of relationships.<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> You know what?<eos> Simon's an idiot.<eos> I don't live in a box.<eos> Tell him.<eos> Tell him.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
That's me and Ruiz, the koala.<eos> I make a yearly donation to the Bear With Me Foundation to help protect the lives of these precious and unique creatures.<eos> So, you're cuddling the animal?<eos> We're nuzzling.<eos> And Ruiz made the first move, Shawn.<eos> (DOOR opening) Here she comes.<eos> Oh, this is so embarrassing.<eos> Those boys are dumb as rain.<eos> See you next week.<eos> Actually, you won't.
- We will never let them lay a finger on him.<eos> - No, you know-- listen, listen. Isn't there any other way that we can do this?<eos> - Just watch.<eos> We're gonna be right next door<eos> Watching everything that happens.<eos> We've got cameras covering every inch of your apartment.<eos> - What if this screws up cory even more?<eos> - If I do it...<eos> Will it help other kids?<eos> - Yeah, it will.
Oh, bugger, it's the wrong box.<eos> It's the wrong box!<eos> All my old toys, they were meant to be going to Africa!<eos> This was meant to be full of clothes! Oh, my God.<eos> What were you thinking, Maddy? ! You idiot!<eos> Maddy, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you think the people in Africa will probably prefer the clothes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they will, won't they!
- Give the Chancellor my regards.<eos> - Now, wait a minute!<eos> I agree.<eos> Report back here when you are finished.<eos> This could be a trap, Master.<eos> You sure you don't need us to go?<eos> Of course it's a trap, Skywalker.<eos> I will contact you when we find the children.<eos> - What if they don't find those kids?<eos> - They will, Snips.
I got bored at home.<eos> I'm going to make coffee.<eos> Do you want some?<eos> Sure...<eos> No.<eos> Hello, my son!<eos> - Did you have a good day?<eos> - You're late.<eos> It's time to take your medicine.<eos> - No, I won't.
People are able to do this, if they are few and far between.<eos> You have a gift.<eos> Is it magic<eos> Of a kind, yes.<eos> But it would be many years Before you could understant it fully,<eos> Let alone use it.<eos> So it is not something to be afraid of,<eos> It is if you have Uther as your guardian.<eos> If he found out, he'd have me killed.<eos> You won't.
( checco snorts )<eos> Uncle, I have made ? the choice to sing, I want to understand ?<eos> What you do as a hobby , the evening with friends.<eos> Sorry , you do the mason as a hobby the evening with friends ?<eos> Ii the singer is such from morning to night .<eos> So, if you want to be a singer , You have to go !<eos> Who do you feel is in here ?<eos> Go to your cousin in Milan , from my son .<eos> . Do you know how many possibilities are there?<eos> . No, uncle , I will not .
Come on.<eos> It is coming free.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Uh, James.<eos> It won't stop.<eos> That didn't work.<eos> Go on, then. Drive it out.<eos> It won't drive out.<eos> It just won't.
Let me see your face.<eos> Oooh.<eos> What is that?<eos> Don't worry, let me see it.<eos> Oooh, good shot, Douglas!<eos> Almost got me.<eos> Almost got me, Douglas.<eos> We'll get him next time, won't we?<eos> Yes. Yes, we will.<eos> We will.
-Bye.<eos> We stayed the whole night awake, making plans.<eos> I thought that I would never happen.<eos> It's crazy, but I swear that never I was so sure in my entire life.<eos> We married.<eos> Yes, Bubu and I will marry.<eos> -But ...<eos> -No, but no.<eos> I love her and we married.<eos> Yes, we will.
We checked the archives.<eos> Nash, she's off the radar.<eos> We can look at the closed-circuit security feed.<eos> The front door has a good shot.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> Mmm-mm.<eos> How's aggressive workin' for ya?<eos> Shut up.<eos> - No one's talking.<eos> - No, they won't.
I can't have the one, my true love,<eos> "And my only choice is to die."<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> And the actors were great. And the scenery?<eos> Were the most important part.<eos> I love it. Absolutely the...<eos> You know what?<eos> The night was so great, This makes this even harder to say.<eos> - Can you not get that?<eos> - I will not.
- I'm so pleased you like it.<eos> I do want you to feel quite at home.<eos> I'm sure you're aware why I wished you to come here.<eos> Because it would make me happier than anything,... .. too happy, really, if you would agree to what I wish.<eos> - And stay with you?<eos> - And stay with me.<eos> - And marry you?<eos> - And marry me.<eos> Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife? To live together after God's ordinance, - in the holiest state of matrimony?<eos> - I will.
I won't do it, and I won't...<eos> You see, what I think it is, is- is I think I'm more comfortable with being disappointed.<eos> I think I'm angry with you for trying to take that away.<eos> Mum, I love you, but not now.<eos> Should I take that as a hopeful sign?<eos> If you give me just a little wider smile.<eos> Oh, shut up, Harvey.<eos> So how's this going to work, Mr. Shine?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> But it will.
Sure.<eos> Why is it you don't wanna go home?<eos> This right here.<eos> My mama's a drunk.<eos> Not just a slurs-her-words drunk a waking-up-in-her-own-vomit kind of drunk.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't be around her when she's gone like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know she may end up dying lighting herself on fire with a lit cigarette but I can't.<eos> I won't.
Hey, don't you have a doctor's appointment coming up?<eos> I do.<eos> I know we have to talk about this.<eos> It's just that... You know, other than you stealing my toast...<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - I saw that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> We've been living in perfect marital bliss for three weeks.<eos> I don't want to lose what we have here.<eos> Then we won't.
Those are all valuable, too.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Whatever's asked of me, sir.<eos> We're very proud of what you did in Iraq. But that does not excuse your actions during that interview.<eos> Part of what it means to wear that uniform is a commitment to discipline.<eos> You can never lose control in a hostile environment, whether that's a television studio or a battlefield.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It won't happen again, sir.<eos> No, it won't.
So?<eos> Who's cheating on who?<eos> What?<eos> Don't play dumb, you rang at the detective's.<eos> I told you to stay in the car.<eos> - That's true, you did.<eos> - Well?<eos> Well, I do what I want.<eos> - I don't want to talk about it.<eos> - Then I will.
Yeah. Sure.<eos> It's good.<eos> Take a big bite.<eos> It's full of eggs.<eos> You're gonna like it.<eos> So your dad's got the big "C," huh?<eos> Sorry to hear about that.<eos> Yeah, well, it's just in his colon.<eos> - No big deal, he'll get better.<eos> - Yeah. Sure he will.
All right, well, Carlotta's not here, so we're not gonna be having...<eos> Oh, my Lord.<eos> You cut my toast in those little triangles I like.<eos> Yep, just for you.<eos> Oh, that looks so good, boy.<eos> There you go.<eos> Now, you just wait till she comes back though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, Grandma.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
That's only for my readings.<eos> The paper is allocated.<eos> We'll procure the paper.<eos> Thank goodness you're safe.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Where's Walter?<eos> - At home.<eos> Things can't go on like this.<eos> Something has to happen.<eos> Something will... everywhere.
But between the two of us I mean, have you ever seen anyone do something like that before?<eos> I think it's safe to say, Chuck that I've never seen anyone quite like you.<eos> Well, Agent Casey, thanks for the accommodations.<eos> Agent Montgomery.<eos> The reason I failed you twice was that your partner at the time was too pretty to pass.<eos> Should have failed her a few more times.<eos> Should have known.<eos> Adieu, Agent Walker.<eos> It was a real pleasure, Agent Montgomery.<eos> Well, I'll, um...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's barely morning.<eos> Just hold up.<eos> I know you're excited, your adrenaline is rushing and your heart rate is pumping just like you got a big case and this is a hot crime scene.<eos> Dad, I just want to see what Santa brought me.<eos> And you will soon enough.
I guess it's good then that George isn't technically the client.<eos> Her name is Molly Foster.<eos> She's 17 and much less famous.<eos> I don't have time to waste on semantics.<eos> If someone of Mr. Michael's esteem is involved in this case, then obviously the requirement to oversee applies.<eos> Including appearing in court?<eos> And managing client relations, yes.<eos> OK, then, welcome to the case.<eos> Mr. Michael will appreciate having a senior partner on his team.<eos> - As will Molly, sir. - Who?
Maybe she went away for Christmas.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll go out tomorrow.<eos> I'll walk into town.<eos> There's got to be work.<eos> Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> Just you wait, Mum.<eos> - What if it never gets better?<eos> - Of course it will.
- Say what?<eos> - I screwed up.<eos> You can say it, probie.<eos> It was not your fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure, be right down, boss.<eos> Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.
It was about me.<eos> Being with Dominic, it made me feel young... until he dumped me for a younger model.<eos> If only he knew the truth.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I sewed up, but it was an accident.<eos> This is first-degree murder.<eos> That is life in prison. I will never survive that.<eos> Josef already has a lawyer working on your bail.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> No, it won't.
They sent you to do this and they haven't told you why?<eos> So what does that make you, then?<eos> Go on, shut me up.<eos> Cos you are just their bitch.<eos> - Lenny's gonna go mad!<eos> - Screw Lenny.<eos> - What if he finds out you're keeping him alive?<eos> - He won't.
Well, no, Lloyd's never had that problem.<eos> How long is he going to be up there?<eos> All these shrinks seem to think an hour's 50 minutes long, so... well, maybe I will have that tea.<eos> Silver nissan 300 parked inside.<eos> Three guys downstairs, one guy up in a loft, poking on something.<eos> I'm guessing that's our girl.<eos> All right, Ronnie, nice work.<eos> Come on down.<eos> Kick down the door, go in guns drawn, badges out, noelle's gonna know it was the police to the rescue.<eos> And so will her big pa.
Is everything okay?<eos> Go away!<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Martha, come back here!<eos> Martha, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> I won't!<eos> Martha, come back here.<eos> Do as I'm telling you!<eos> I won't!
The men are all sitting around talking shit, and the women are all working.<eos> If we fight the women instead of the men, we'd get our asses kicked.<eos> Man, they act like they actually want us here.<eos> Let me see under glasses.<eos> You have beautiful eyes.<eos> You like boys or girls?<eos> Girls, dawg.<eos> Girls?<eos> Go with my friend.<eos> You'll like.
That's what... that's something negotiators do.<eos> We stall for time, we pass the buck, we stretch the truth, but uh, I don't want to lie to you, jack.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> He knows we're at the end of the line.<eos> - Yeah, but you can'T...<eos> - he knows what he's doing.<eos> I could keep asking them.<eos> I can keep asking them and asking them, but the thing is, is that... they are never gonna let you have that heart.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, no. Yes, they will.
I told you.<eos> I'm not gonna put herin a nursing home.<eos> I promised herthat I wouldn't years ago.<eos> We promised each other.<eos> Circumstanceswere different then.<eos> -You didn't knowabout the alzheimer'S.<eos> -Sam,I promised her.<eos> When she dies,she dies in my arms--not with strangers,in my arms.<eos> She's the love of my life.<eos> I will not putthe love of my life... in a home.
Like I could give him a name and...<eos> Relax.<eos> Everything's looking good.<eos> I'm falling behind in all of my classes.<eos> I had to quit my job at the Admissions office because I'm too tired.<eos> All I have is the financial aid.<eos> How am I supposed to do this after the baby's born?<eos> I wanna go to law school.<eos> You know, I wanna have a life.<eos> You will.
Master!<eos> I... did not want to kill him.<eos> Are you begging your life now?<eos> I'm sick of your excuses.<eos> I'lI perform the sword of Yamabe...<eos> Take it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> We'd kill each other for nothing.<eos> please understand, Miss Kotono.<eos> No, I won't !
You'll catch your death.<eos> There must be some hope.<eos> There are bound to be some people who are naturally immune.<eos> The lucky ones.<eos> If you can call them that.<eos> Why shouldn't you?<eos> Can you... imagine what their lives will be like now?<eos> How scared and lonely they'll be?<eos> But... whatever happens, I'd rather live.<eos> Perhaps you will.
Says who?<eos> Well, Mr Plornish and me, sir, not to deceive you, sir.<eos> What, and you'll stand surety for him, will you?<eos> Well...<eos> The thing about references is, it is usually one person who can't pay guaranteeing another person who can't pay can pay.<eos> Che? He say 'e don't think you got no money.<eos> Money, si, si, sens'altro!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes! You got it now, but will you have it when rent day comes?<eos> Yes, he will, Mr Pancks.
Nobody else?<eos> -I have proof, you know.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Shit. -Huh?<eos> How far are you gone?<eos> -I came from Blönduós.<eos> No...when are you due? -Oh.<eos> I'm such a mongo.<eos> They'll come in 2 weeks.<eos> -Who will?
Forgive me.<eos> That's the way I am.<eos> - It's my fault.<eos> - No, no.<eos> What ever happens you always will be her father.<eos> I know.<eos> Like you always will be my son.<eos> Forgive me, please forgive me.<eos> - I think you should go.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Being a tinker is really swell and all, but I wouldn't go around bragging about your talent.<eos> It's not like spring depends on you.<eos> Of course it does!<eos> And when I go to the mainland, I'll prove just how important we are.<eos> When who goes to the mainland?<eos> Me, of course!<eos> For spring!<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You'll prove it, huh?<eos> Yes, I will.
- Cheese ?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Buckle up.<eos> - What's in the box ?<eos> - Patience, Christopher.<eos> Patience.<eos> - Now ?<eos> - Patience.<eos> - I'll just go to my dorm.<eos> - No, you won't.
Like a...<eos> Like a sacrifice.<eos> It has something to do with the ruins.<eos> Now that we're here, they won't let us leave.<eos> So, what do we do, just wait for someone to find us?<eos> Who?<eos> The Greeks.<eos> Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.<eos> Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?<eos> Then somebody else will.
My body is no longer mine.<eos> Attack me please.<eos> Attack now!<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> If it's what you want...<eos> Il-yeong!<eos> That's it!<eos> Attack me once more!<eos> No!<eos> I won't!
This isn't what you need.<eos> I'm not a priest.<eos> I've never even been a particularly good man.<eos> I have, in fact, been a profoundly selfish man, but that doesn't matter, you see.<eos> Something in the universe loves me.<eos> Something in the universe loves the entity that is me.<eos> I will choose to call this something "God".<eos> A singular spark that dwells in the soul of every living being.<eos> If you look inside yourself, you will find this spark too.<eos> You will.
You're this Doctor's companion, can't you help?<eos> What exactly do you do for him?<eos> Why does he need you?<eos> Because he's lonely.<eos> And that's what you want me to become?<eos> What if it's them?<eos> I'm not an expert, but I don't think scarecrows knock.<eos> I brought you this.<eos> Hold it.<eos> - I won't.
A traitor to the King doesn't deserve to live.<eos> Oi, Much.<eos> Much, meet Alice!<eos> - Put him down, Henry!<eos> - They say you don't kill any more.<eos> - For the King, I kill.<eos> - The King's finished.<eos> The Sheriff, Prince John and the Black Knights, they'll win.<eos> Robin...<eos> Not today, they won't.
We looked for six hours.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> We killed him.<eos> It was self-defense, right?<eos> I mean, he was trying to kill us.<eos> We can't prove that.<eos> This is bad, Gaby .<eos> Oh, when people find out we were on that boat with him, it...<eos> Maybe they won't.
But that'll only make the fall harder.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your ambition.<eos> Maybe we need people like Patty who see their destiny in grander terms than the rest of us.<eos> But that doesn't mean that you should go work for her.<eos> So think about it.<eos> My offer's still good.<eos> My interview is on wednesday.<eos> I haven't even gotten the job yet.<eos> You will.
Thank you for asking. You know, he... He came downstairs this morning whistling.<eos> Opens up the curtains and says, "What a beautiful day. "<eos> I said, "Is that my son?"<eos> Sounds like he has a whole new attitude.<eos> I think his schoolwork is gonna start improving too.<eos> - Yeah, well, I hope you're right.<eos> - I know I'm right.<eos> - Well, I hope so.<eos> Time will tell.<eos> Yes. It will.
- # Yeah yeah, she gets it...<eos> Stop cockblocking me #<eos> - # Who knows what # - # Who who who #<eos> # Makes love stop or start?<eos> # # I can't help #<eos> # But think that now you're engaged #<eos> # We're drifting apart #<eos> # And who am I to say #<eos> # That love will last?<eos> # # It won't or it will #
Baby, what are you talking about?<eos> This is a one-time thing.<eos> You came home last night and you said that the hotel had screwed us out of a king-sized bed and would I "really be comfortable in a single?"<eos> and then this morning before the news came on you said that Brian Sher's wife wasn't going and if she found out that I was going, she would go crazy.<eos> There are some men that would kill to go to the south of France with me and if you're not one of them...<eos> I am one of them, honey.<eos> I'm glad that the flight was canceled, so now I can tell you I want you to go.<eos> I don't want to go without you and I love you.<eos> Now will you go?<eos> No, Ari, I won't.
Screw friendship, screw honor, screw patriotism.<eos> We just lost the franchise!<eos> Oh, please.<eos> The show's been on for 15 years.<eos> It's had like eight head writers, a couple of hundred staff writers-- it'll be fine.<eos> Studio 60 is a restaurant with a good location.<eos> Give him a couple of days-- he'll come back.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Danny.<eos> No, he won't.
What is it?<eos> I have a virus.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> I can't make you or anybody else sick.<eos> What's gonna happen to you?<eos> Do you remember Dr. Suresh?<eos> He is working really hard to find me a cure.<eos> And when he does, I'll get better.<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
System's reset.<eos> Nice work, Fargo.<eos> S.R.T. Transport sequence initialized<eos> What the hell?<eos> Beverly, no!<eos> Damn it, her DNA's already programmed in the system.<eos> She reprogrammed the coordinates.<eos> She could be anywhere now.<eos> She'll be found.<eos> No, she won't.
When my wife is upset, I gotta do something.<eos> You don't take your car to a mechanic, tell him what's wrong, and then say, "but don't fix it.<eos> Just listen and hug me."<eos> I should be able to share things with my husband without worrying he's gonna go do something crazy.<eos> Or you could be more amused when he does something crazy.<eos> Let's not forget about the beautiful flowers.<eos> One of which is already dead.<eos> Honey, I just want to be able to move on from this<eos> - knowing it's not gona happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Gutsy call.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It wasn't a compliment.<eos> If you were wrong, she'd be dead.<eos> I was sure...<eos> No, you weren't. You couldn't be.<eos> There's a reason we have rules.<eos> If every doctor did whatever his gut told him was right, we'd have a lot more dead bodies to deal with.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
SINCE I FINISHED COLLEGE. I CAN COUNT.<eos> YOU ATTENDED 3.<eos> YES, MA'AM.<eos> I'M GONNA SKIP THE FOURTH.<eos> IS THAT RIGHT?<eos> YOU GOT A JOB?<eos> SORTA.<eos> THE LINE BETWEEN "SORTA" AND "YES" DON'T MEET IN THE MIDDLE.<eos> DO YOU HAVE A JOB?<eos> I WILL.
YOU ATTENDED 3.<eos> YES, MA'AM.<eos> I'M GONNA SKIP THE FOURTH.<eos> IS THAT RIGHT?<eos> YOU GOT A JOB?<eos> SORTA.<eos> THE LINE BETWEEN "SORTA" AND "YES" DON'T MEET IN THE MIDDLE.<eos> DO YOU HAVE A JOB?<eos> I WILL.<eos> SHE WILL.
Is anyone having problems with him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> June, can you help us look for him?<eos> As soon as I get out of here, I'll look for him.<eos> Yes. Yes. Okay.<eos> Let me check one moment.<eos> This is so slow.<eos> Is he going to show up?<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course he will.
$300?<eos> Anyone. Thank you, sir, $300.<eos> Do I hear $400?<eos> Who will say $400?<eos> Do I hear $400?<eos> Who will go $400?<eos> Thank you. I have $400.<eos> Do I have $500?<eos> $500?<eos> $500, who will.
All to defend a chunk of a ice, in the ass end of nowhere.<eos> Toasters must think it's pretty important...<eos> Yeah, rumour's they're building some kind of superweapon, or something.<eos> I heard they were... negotiating. Trying to reach a peace settlement. Yeah, I think I heard that one too.<eos> But if you think about it, why would they surrender?<eos> You know, they're frakking machines.<eos> Shoot one down, they just build more.<eos> Still in school.<eos> Never thought I'd get out here in time to get a shot at them.<eos> You will.
You got me.<eos> Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?<eos> I know where she's going.<eos> Well, they're all tucked in back there.<eos> That little girl's somethin', huh?<eos> There's a prophesy about that child, Mr. Scoresby.<eos> She will decide the war which is to come.<eos> War?<eos> I ain't heard rumor of any war.<eos> You will.
# Oh-o-o-o-o #<eos> # Oh, yeah # # Go, Mama, go, go, go #<eos> # Oh-o-o-o-o-o, oh-o-o-o-o-o #<eos> # Oh-o-o-o-o go, go, Mama, go, go, go!<eos> Mmm. Mmm.<eos> Wait till Dad sees you.<eos> Sees me?<eos> He never notices what I wear.<eos> In 20 years, he's never even said to me, "nice muumuu" or nothin'.<eos> Now he will.
LEAVlTT: It's beer.<eos> FLEURY: Reminds me of when they hit the towers, first time, in '93.<eos> You remember how they caught the cell?<eos> -Car bomb. -Yeah.<eos> He went back to get his deposit on the rental car.<eos> $400.<eos> Stupidity.<eos> Then nine years later they come back.<eos> I got a feeling I'm coming back too.<eos> Yes, you will.
-Be serious.<eos> -l am serious.<eos> I need to knowwho he is.<eos> I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him.<eos> is that more important than your family's safety?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you need to do this?<eos> Why?<eos> Because nobody else will.
Because you say so?<eos> - Because it's safe,Jess! Because your father is gonna find us, and, yeah, because I say so!<eos> - You think he's gonna find us.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - What if he doesn't find us?<eos> - He will.<eos> - And if he doesn't?<eos> - He will,Jess.<eos> - What if my dad doesn't find us?<eos> - Goddamn it, he will!
Pakistan and Israel would have to appear to be enemies in the public eye.<eos> Yeah, I don't think that's a tough sell.<eos> You have authority to do this?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> In fact, I'm pretty close to violating the Logan Act.<eos> Well, I don't know what that is.<eos> - But, Charlie.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> If I see one fucking Star of David on a crate...<eos> You won't.
Too weak even to argue.<eos> - You haven't slept.<eos> - Yes, I have.<eos> "Yes, I have." "Yes, I have."<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What?<eos> It's still recording.<eos> This is all set.<eos> You'll never get it through the door.<eos> Sure I will.
And I want this thing locked... before we pass it to the DA.<eos> Stop yelling, Phil.<eos> I called you as a courtesy and now you're trying to take advantage.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not knocking it down to a class C.<eos> My backlog of open cases doesn't mitigate the fact... that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law.<eos> A golfing accident.<eos> Phil... your client owns one golf club, no golf balls... and the accident happened in a stairwell... of an after-hours, illegal gambling hall.<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Well, I won't, but someone from this office will.
After they tried to rob her, three times.<eos> And do you know what the police said?<eos> Paperwork.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> I heard what you said in the sports hall.<eos> I wanna help ya.<eos> I can get you sleeves on all Manning's people, the ones that hurt Monroe.<eos> The ones that killed his family.<eos> The law failed him.<eos> We won't.
-He's gonna jump the net!<eos> -It's too high!<eos> He'll never make it.<eos> You did it, Crusoe!<eos> Well done, boy!<eos> He'll not be coming back, will he?<eos> I think he's meant to be on his own, dear.<eos> Not Crusoe. I meant Daddy.<eos> No, love.<eos> He'll not.
- Don't take me for an ass!<eos> Understood?<eos> !<eos> If you insist to say that you don't know why the backpack was two steps away from your house, and that you kept the analyses of Anna, but you didn't know what stuff they were and that you have only discovered it later after we have found her dead,<eos> you take yourself 30 years!<eos> Am I clear?<eos> I tell you the truth, it is you who don't believe me!<eos> - Tell me which one is the true truth!<eos> Tell it to me!<eos> - Sure I will.
But now I have to know who's the woman I must love.<eos> Help me if you can.<eos> I can only tell you what I went through... And I've never told anyone.<eos> After your birth, I felt an unknown attraction to another woman.<eos> I was ready to leave my family.<eos> But before doing that, I forced myself to stop seeing her.<eos> Soon enough, I realised the excitement existed only in myself.<eos> It was my need to feel.<eos> You suffer, because you think the pain of losing her will never pass...<eos> But it will, Son.
Set yourself clear.<eos> They want it formatted according to military specs.<eos> Coordinating assault with the cover- attack helicopters from Camp Pendleton.<eos> - When?<eos> - Thirty minutes.<eos> An assault on who?<eos> Assad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We don't even know where Assad is.<eos> We will.
So...<eos> You wanna do that meeting now, or what?<eos> Meeting's off.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The police wanna talk to me about Brett.<eos> Just go with the detective.<eos> Answer his questions.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - What if those men call?<eos> - They won't.
Chloe, when you get the satellite, make sure we have coverage of that area.<eos> Let Curtis know that he is to intercept Jack somewhere on route 7 on the way to Newhall.<eos> Fayed?<eos> What is it?<eos> Our scout is reporting increased activity around the Palmdale military prison.<eos> The transport buses are starting to arrive.<eos> Good.<eos> By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened.<eos> We still don't have the component.<eos> We will.
About what you were paying For sue's house<eos> -That would do it.<eos> You can't blackmail me Over an accident.<eos> Which part was an accident, Strangling her Or dumping sue In some guy's casket?<eos> She wouldn't listen.<eos> She wanted to ruin me.<eos> She said so.<eos> I lost control of my temper For one second,that's all.<eos> I wonder if the police Will see it the same way,john.<eos> No,we won't.
Leftovers!<eos> Why even bother?<eos> Is it too much to ask that the passing of my beloved dog be marked by food that has been prepared specifically with that occasion in mind?<eos> I'm sure the food will be wonderful.<eos> Have you called about the flowers?<eos> - I was just about to.<eos> - Lorelai.<eos> Grayson's only needs a 2-hour heads up.<eos> At least do you have a program for me to approve?<eos> Uh, not yet, but I will.
- There's always furniture to sell. - Sounds good.<eos> - You've come for pictures of Lane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I am giving these to you in pristine condition, and I expect that that is how they will be returned.<eos> Do not cut them up or put glue on the back.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> I will return them in the condition in which they were received. See you at the shower.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
You and the Director have a nice chat?<eos> Well, I wouldn't call it "nice".<eos> Illuminating, perhaps.<eos> - For who?<eos> - Well, not for her.<eos> As you expected, she didn't... appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.<eos> She still thinks of him as a prime suspect.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Yes, but you listen to my perspective, and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the facts were to change.<eos> And the Director's won't?
After what he did to my mom, I don't mind the idea of himcohabitating with the rats for all of eternity.<eos> Trust me, chloe.<eos> Lately I've had momentswhere I thought the world would be a betterplace without him, but you don't get to choosewho you're gonna save.<eos> Not if you're clark kent.<eos> Besides,whatever's in those tunnels may be the first stepin taking lex down.<eos> Then I suggest you beat the bomb squad to the entrance and human-wrecking-ball your way in before anyone can see you.<eos> Perfect timing,macgyver.<eos> You're gonna need those pawsto call wes.<eos> The phones won't work this deep in the tunnel system.<eos> Mine will.
There's no way!<eos> Ah, let me see what I can do.<eos> What?<eos> What can you do?<eos> I have a superpower.<eos> Lily is gonna kill me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> She's not gonna want to marry me like this.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Of course she will.
Go graduate. Really?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't even...<eos> Principal Turner.<eos> Principal Turner.<eos> Look, if you suspend her, I think you're really making a big mistake.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to barge in like this but... Shut up.<eos> Chase, I love you for this, really, but, shut up.<eos> We'll...
- There's that.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - You know they charge up to $30 for a bowl of penne?<eos> Vince wants a job.<eos> Tell us what you got.<eos> - I gotta see the movie.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.<eos> He understands that at some point everyone's gonna see it, right?<eos> At some point, everyone will.
How could you ever have an accident, today?<eos> Tomorrow I am busy so I thought: "I am going to have an accident today".<eos> Don't fool me!<eos> You are so immature!<eos> You're 8 years late with your studies, you can't live with your family forever!<eos> First of all, 8 years are 8 years while "forever" means a prison, second thing, don't mention the situation with my family!<eos> They are still waiting for the only one satisfaction of their life:<eos> Have an educated son.<eos> I am going to break up with you, you'll see!<eos> Soon or later I will.
- What about your friend?<eos> Not my problem!<eos> I can't give a ride to all my friends!<eos> I don't ride a bus!<eos> - So, shall we go?<eos> - Fine, where's your car?<eos> - I don't have a car.<eos> Is it ok for you...?<eos> - Will you take me to the seaside?<eos> - Yes, I will!
You can't tell anyone, even your friends at school, That daddy's home - For a little while.<eos> - Are you gonna have to go back to afghanistan?<eos> The cia doesn't tell you where they'll send you next.<eos> Is it dangerous to be a spy?<eos> Not as long as nobody knows who you are.<eos> I'm what they call "working deep cover."<eos> That's why, like I said, - You gotta keep the secret.<eos> - I won't tell.<eos> - You better not!<eos> - I won't!
- This is my final ultimatum Cemal.<eos> I'm taking the kids and going to my mom.<eos> Go to hell, see if I care!<eos> You did the right thing man, the poor guy's always being nagged at.<eos> Shut up!<eos> - Tugce, Captain found Gokmen.<eos> He says we'll be here just a little longer<eos> - Don't you worry about us.<eos> We'll see you soon.<eos> Of course we will.
You're such a moron.<eos> My stomach hurts!<eos> You're laughing way too hard.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> But it's hilarious!<eos> It's not.<eos> Want to get a CT scan at our hospital?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Be careful. Something might happen again.<eos> It won't.
I can't find it.<eos> I can't find the bug.<eos> I know you put it inside me somewhere.<eos> I know you're listening.<eos> I'm gonna find it.<eos> I'm gonna get an x-ray of my whole body.<eos> Maia's it!<eos> Maia's it!<eos> - I'm gonna get you, Amy!<eos> - No, you won't.
Change just brings problems! You know it's true!<eos> Doug wilson!<eos> Who's your pal?<eos> Don't you just hatecelia hodes?<eos> Celia hodes has chlamydia!<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Job applications.<eos> - You already have a job.<eos> - Yes,I do.<eos> Soon,you will,too.
He's my dad!<eos> He's the same bastard that treats you, your mom, and Lisa like crap.<eos> I'd rather see him go down, if it means you get to live.<eos> What you're feeling, it will never go away.<eos> You did this to me.<eos> I thought you were my friend!<eos> I am.<eos> What... the fuck is...?<eos> You know when the doctor says it won't hurt?<eos> Well, this will.
I feel like I've been keeping you close to me to try to protect you from those things,<eos> like I'm hanging onto the two of us for you, but not for me.<eos> I'm sorry I kissed Peyton.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> It's not about that, Luke.<eos> It's not.<eos> I mean, I thought that it was, but this is not about her.<eos> This is about me.<eos> I love you, Lucas.<eos> And I probably always will.
- No, it isn't.<eos> - It is for you.<eos> Dean... you're not the first soldier I've plucked from the field.<eos> They all feel the same.<eos> They can't leave.<eos> Victory hangs in the balance.<eos> But they're wrong.<eos> - The battle goes on without them.<eos> - My brother, he could die without me.<eos> Maybe he will. Maybe he won't.
And, um... you know.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You know, uh, I mean, come on.<eos> Mr. Magoo.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Mr. Magoo?<eos> Oh, gosh, he was a great man.<eos> Um...an inventor.<eos> Really?<eos> An entrepreneur, if you will.
- and it went through a lot n there, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So I'd say if this baby can survive that, it certainly can survive a normal day in your boring life.<eos> I see it.<eos> You... you see it?<eos> It's there.<eos> Now we just need to find a fetal heartbeat.<eos> You see it?<eos> Now they just have to find the heartbeat.<eos> They will.
This is what I like to see.<eos> My 2 boys playing nice together.<eos> I'm helping him study. Really?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> He's, you know, firing Questions, trying to get me In the zone which I'm having a<eos> At what point will an Aluminum transport tank bleve And what does that stand for?<eos> Bleve.<eos> That's boiling liquid expansion Vapor explode and aluminum<eos> Bleves it... it won't.<eos> Steel will.
Yeah.<eos> Then don't feel bad about it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is a hell of a first date, huh?<eos> Well, at... at least we're getting to know each other.<eos> Just so you know...<eos> I'm not really into the whole bondage thing.<eos> Well, I hope we get a second date.<eos> I really do.<eos> We will.
I'll have to show it to the others.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just, I bet you don't.<eos> And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?<eos> No, because I know the pendant.<eos> Well, you're wrong.<eos> Because I will.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you won't.
I thought about what you said...<eos> Come out.<eos> Good.<eos> Come and see.<eos> Here'sthe thing.<eos> Let's start from the beginning.<eos> We're two strangers in a hotel room.<eos> Who goes first?<eos> - First at what?<eos> -Then I will.
Guys, this is what he wants.<eos> How long have we been down here ?<eos> We don't even know where here is.<eos> He doesn't want us to know.<eos> He wants to break us down.<eos> It's called sensory depravation.<eos> It's not going to work !<eos> You hear me, you son of a bitch ? !<eos> It's not going to work !<eos> Yes, it will.
What are they doing?<eos> - That's the town band.<eos> They're great!<eos> They're practising for the procession.<eos> They practice for days.<eos> They put the Saint on the trawler and then take her around... so she blesses the whole sea.<eos> It's a great celebration.<eos> My father always used to take me.<eos> Will you take me too?<eos> Course I will, in spring.
--Did you stop the bleeding?<eos> --Mostly. I gave him a shot for the pain.<eos> Probably fall asleep now.<eos> Is this the guy?<eos> The murderer everybody's talking about?<eos> --He says no.<eos> --Oh, no one's going to believe him.<eos> They're out for blood.<eos> He's not going to get a fair shake.<eos> Yes, he will.
And nobody tried to pin the cave-in on them?<eos> Now, why would they try to do that?<eos> Well, from my experience...<eos> The best scapegoats are those... who can't speak English.<eos> You know, that's all ancient history.<eos> But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine.<eos> Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
It's the only thing that matters, Tristan.<eos> Leave with me. I'll go anywhere.<eos> Your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed.<eos> Isolde. We will live with this.<eos> We must.<eos> Don't do this to me.<eos> Tristan, we've made shore.<eos> What if she's a hag?<eos> Or she simply won't have me?<eos> She will, Brother.
Inspector, it's awfully late and...<eos> Oh, I'm just going over these crime-scene photos.<eos> - Don't you need some rest?<eos> - Crime does not rest, Nicole.<eos> It's true.<eos> You see... I have waited a long time to prove myself.<eos> And I've been given the opportunity of a lifetime.<eos> And I intend to show the world exactly who I am... and what I can do.<eos> I must not fail.<eos> You won't.
Okay.<eos> Now you can go back to sleep.<eos> Lucy, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I will not go in the car seat!<eos> - You have to go in the car-<eos> - I will not go in the car seat!<eos> Yes, you will!<eos> - You will go in the car seat.<eos> - No, I won't!
Pen and ink.<eos> For writing.<eos> It's all done except the last chapter.<eos> I want you to help me.<eos> How?<eos> Finish it.<eos> Finish it.<eos> - I don't know how it ends.<eos> - You do.<eos> You will.
Stop it!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Leave me!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please. I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Leave me!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please. I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Far enough to see things from a different perspective.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Unless you know something I don't.<eos> - Thomas, I don't believe it. - What?<eos> After everything that we've been through... after everything that's happened to us, you're still holding out on me?<eos> Fine.<eos> All right, well, you know I won't give up.<eos> I'm not the woman that just walks away.<eos> Now, I will find out the truth.<eos> I will.
Jimmy, stop.<eos> -Man-- Man, you ain't got to do this.<eos> -Hey....<eos> -Okay, then. All right.<eos> -Beat it.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm really proud of you.<eos> But?<eos> But I thought we was gonna start a family.<eos> We will, baby.
Good girl!<eos> You see? She's getting better.<eos> Ira, sing the song you learned, dear.<eos> Weren't you learning a song?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> What injections have they been giving her?<eos> You'll have to ask the doctor.<eos> They give her what she needs.<eos> I'll ask right now!<eos> I will!
We should go.<eos> Now.<eos> What have you found out?<eos> - She was last seen riding here, alone.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And based on your information, I then threw her out.<eos> - Did she commit suicide?<eos> - No. It was surely murder.<eos> - Do you have a suspect?<eos> - We will soon, Your Highness.
They agree with my recommendation completely.<eos> So it won't do you any good to go over my head.<eos> - Take the cuffs off.<eos> - Sir...<eos> Unless you want to fly his plane.<eos> I think I forgot to sign that.<eos> Ask me about it again tomorrow.<eos> Congratulations, Rawlings.<eos> And don't ever do that again.<eos> I won't, sir.
Sorry. You're sorry?<eos> What are you sorry about, sweetie? Taking him out of school or trying to turn him into some kind of spy?<eos> Alex isn't a spy.<eos> He's a 14-year-old kid, lady.<eos> Well, that's what makes him useful to us.<eos> What happens if he gets hurt?<eos> What if he's killed? Could you live with that, Mrs. Jones?<eos> I worked for Ian Rider nine years.<eos> I didn't know about any of this. But I warn you, if anything happens to Alex...<eos> It won't.
That's a good idea.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> It's alright for me to trust someone.<eos> She wouldn't have made a better mother than me.<eos> You and the kids are everything.<eos> Mom!<eos> One more stretcher over here.<eos> It's just her.<eos> Is she gonna make it?<eos> Yeah, she will.
Trust me.<eos> I'm good at car accidents.<eos> Everyone'll miss you.<eos> They'll say great things about you.<eos> Only the Covenant will know the real truth.<eos> But, to them, you'll become a legend.<eos> The one who gave his life for them.<eos> How about you let her go, and I let you live out your life?<eos> How about I make you my "weyotch"?<eos> I'll never will you my power.
Either that or he does know better and he just doesn't care.<eos> No, Taj, you don't understand.<eos> Pip comes from a very important family, one of the most powerful in England and sometimes you just have to overlook the...<eos> Do you know what?<eos> I sound just like my father.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Look, aside from forgiving all of Pip's awful faults, what exactly would you like to do for the rest of your life?<eos> Oh, you'd laugh.<eos> No, I won't.
What happened? She's in there now?<eos> Just... (BANG)<eos> HANNAH: I had to do something.<eos> I had to make him stop.<eos> The fuck out of here, man!<eos> But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
Big red.<eos> So you have one towel and three half-empty bottles of shampoo?<eos> I have very particular hair.<eos> My mom says I look like Michael Landon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> He's, uh, Pa?<eos> Little House on the Prairie?<eos> - Never watched that. - Mmm.<eos> People also tell me I look like Rachel Maddow, which I take as a huge compliment.<eos> I would.
An architect. He's redesigning this place.<eos> I'm writing a piece on him.<eos> What's he like?<eos> Well, at first glance, you probably wouldn't find him all that interesting, but...<eos> He's deep.<eos> And thoughtful.<eos> The kind of person you see and think,<eos> "I just wanna be around you."<eos> Maybe I'd like him.<eos> Yeah, maybe you would.
He will break you.<eos> Yeah, well, Koenigs don't break.<eos> All right? We're programmed to take pain, so bring it on!<eos> Bring it on!<eos> Oh, my God. I'm in so much pain.<eos> I don't think I can take this.<eos> That guy hits really hard.<eos> Do you have any, uh, any, like, cyanide or ...<eos> - Cyanide?<eos> Why would I ...
Helpless is not a feeling I am fond of, either.<eos> Gideon, I don't mean to intrude, but may I?<eos> Anything you do would be a great help.<eos> Look who's feeling better.<eos> What are you playing, Agatha?<eos> Princess.<eos> What a coincidence, that is my favorite game.<eos> Except, when I do it, it is called Playing Queen.<eos> Would you like to play Queen with me?<eos> I would, very much.
Mrs. Rayburn, you have a great standing in this community.<eos> Your family name means something.<eos> A pier's dedicated to you, charitable contributions...<eos> Almost 50 years of business at your inn.<eos> Do you really want these insinuations to go unanswered?<eos> You could dispel them.<eos> Well, what if Meg came back?<eos> Do you have information about where she is?<eos> No, I just... I just thought it might help.<eos> Of course it would.
So, here's the thing, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I really, really can't, but, um... Do you think maybe we should wait?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we should.<eos> No, we definitely should.<eos> If we do anything and tomorrow you're a different guy?<eos> Yeah, the old guy? The guy that would never suggest we wait?<eos> Yeah. If you're him tomorrow, I'm gonna hate myself.<eos> I would, too.<eos> Except I'd be him.<eos> So, I wouldn't.
Now, since you haven't been around the block as many times as I have, let me walk you through how this works.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. President, but I do know how this is done.<eos> Oh, well, that's good to hear.<eos> I'll start with Maine.<eos> She owes me.<eos> You know, we did meet once before, Mr. President.<eos> At a dinner, during the 2012 convention.<eos> - I tried to introduce myself to you...<eos> - You don't remember, do you?<eos> - Why would I?
It kills your brain cells.<eos> You don't have too many left to spare.<eos> Eat a dick.<eos> You know, it's a good thing Nicky was there or you'd be barbecue, bud.<eos> He knows you're banging Nicky.<eos> I don't wanna be a dick about it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You don't care that your girlfriend left you for this genius?<eos> I would.
Thanks.<eos> You always seem to know exactly the right thing to say.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some dish towels to adjust.<eos> - How do you do that?<eos> - What?<eos> Care about people's problems so much?<eos> A lot of the people here were customers in my shop.<eos> So that means that if I were selling the right thing at my store, they'd all want to talk to me?<eos> It certainly would get you noticed more.<eos> Yes, it would.
Lies!<eos> Lies!<eos> Oh, you're gonna get ten walks a day, boy.<eos> You can even bite the mailman.<eos> There he is.<eos> America's number one doggy daddy.<eos> Would you care to do the honors?<eos> Would I!<eos> Uh, that's what I asked.<eos> Would you?
- No. No, no, no.<eos> Did you...<eos> You fake this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. We faked it.<eos> Alright, look.<eos> We faked it because it's real, okay.<eos> There really is something happening here, guys, in these woods.<eos> - And that make sense to you?<eos> - Everyone would.
Please, don't make a fuss.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna make a fuss.<eos> You're a convicted felon sitting in a room full of children.<eos> You're a criminal.<eos> It was white-collar crime.<eos> Okay, you don't have to defend me.<eos> You're such a loser.<eos> I'm sorry, what did he say?<eos> What?<eos> - Well, I would...
Don't tell me what I can and can't do. Welcome.<eos> I'm Thomas Herrick, and this is my wife, Frances.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Jonathan Tilton-Schofield. This is my wife, Emily.<eos> We got here as fast as we could.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> There's no power.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why go to the bother of bringing it in when you can't turn it on?<eos> They wouldn't.
I'm sure every father said that about their boy some point or another.<eos> Bulshit!<eos> I minded my old man.<eos> Didn't you tell me one time about when you were 17 you wanted to run away? Cause your old man wouldn't let you join in the army?<eos> You don't remember as well as you think you do.<eos> - Oh no?<eos> - No.<eos> I was eighteen and it was the Marines.<eos> And I would made a damn fine one too.<eos> Of course you would.
What the fuck does that mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We should run, Sam.<eos> You and me.<eos> This is our chance.<eos> - Yeah, and he's gonna kill your parents.<eos> - Like he said, it's a choice.<eos> Us or them.<eos> They would want us to save ourselves.<eos> Wouldn't your parents?
Been here three days, and we're short on beds.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I...<eos> You're to be the queen of all nurses, you'll need to keep up.<eos> I'm waiting on Dr. hale.<eos> Dr. hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
Well, that's actually-- and he's the self-help gentle fellow.<eos> I met her at the diner.<eos> You look even lovelier out of your uniform.<eos> And then she was married to salt, right?<eos> That's Hap.<eos> And then there's your jig.<eos> - Leonard, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> So we--we'd like to-- I'd like to deal quickly.<eos> Of course. Yeah, of course you would.
Almost there.<eos> - I think we got that.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Fuckin' Pappas!<eos> See you next week.<eos> Is... is that a tiara or a crown?<eos> You don't like it?<eos> No, I do! - You know, I would!<eos> - You would?<eos> - I would! Of Course!
Who do you think makes all her dinner reservations?<eos> Me.<eos> I mean, she asked me to call but I just had a feeling that place wouldn't be quite your style.<eos> Our style.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> - No...<eos> Not just anybody would have sent me that letter.<eos> - Sure they would. - No.
I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.<eos> It happened a month before the first killing. I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.<eos> All right. We'll call it event one.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's event two. God, it's weird being here.<eos> It looks just like your old place.<eos> Yeah, I kind of like it here.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.<eos> Hey, you don't have mine, do you?<eos> I'd like to see who came to my funeral.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Look, uh, I have a problem.<eos> No, you have no problems.<eos> That girl up there?<eos> She had problems.<eos> - You have challenges.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.
It's all sanded and spackled.<eos> I mean, CSU can undo it so we can at least confirm the make of the weapons, but that's about it.<eos> What?<eos> Something on my tie?<eos> No, I was just thinking you look... different.<eos> Oh, lost a few pounds.<eos> I mean, you look different than you did when you were standing over here.<eos> There's something weird about the light.<eos> Aside from the fact it casts a cooler hue, you'd never know there's a tiny little spy camera in there.<eos> Yes, I would.
And if you think I don't know how to deal with an annoying roommate, well, you are sorely mistaken.<eos> Felix, amazing news!<eos> They just offered Brandon a permanent job in Somalia, and he's going to take it, which means I get to keep Biscuit!<eos> What?<eos> ! And deny this pup an enriching trip to Africa?<eos> I am gonna spend so much time with you.<eos> Except for tomorrow.<eos> I have to work a double shift.<eos> Would you mind watching him for me?<eos> Absolutely I would.
Daliyah looked at me yesterday and asked me not to kill any more people, not in her name, but tell me, what else can I do?<eos> I asked her to marry me.<eos> Who?<eos> Daliyah.<eos> I popped the question yesterday, right before the attacks.<eos> I asked her to be my first lady.<eos> Um... wow. Where did, uh, where did this come from?<eos> I'm in love with her, as it turns out.<eos> You'd probably feel the same thing if you weren't married.<eos> Anyone would.
All right, pop quiz. Fun facts about Idaho.<eos> I grew up here.<eos> It has more ghost towns than anywhere else in the country.<eos> - That is correct. - There is no country anymore.<eos> That is incorrect, Matt.<eos> Jeez, since when are you the buzzkill? I thought that was Dana.<eos> Yeah, that was really out of character, Matt.<eos> Maybe I'm a shapeshifter.<eos> You are not. I'd know for sure.<eos> Dana wouldn't.
Let's take that one off your plate right now.<eos> You can be buried with me and Molly.<eos> I happen to have space, okay?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> That is...<eos> And to think I didn't even want to hire you.<eos> The one time I don't have my hanky.<eos> You want to... Watch TV?<eos> - Just for a few minutes?<eos> - Yeah, sure, I would.
Oh, I expect so.<eos> What don't they mind?<eos> Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?<eos> There's a dance?<eos> At the parish hall.<eos> There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.<eos> Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.<eos> We're going to see a movie instead.<eos> Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.<eos> I would, very much.
I said it. [Chuckles]<eos> You'd feel a lot better if you just said "asshole."<eos> What are you smiling about? Nothing.<eos> It's just weird that this is coming up, 'cause, uh, the thing, the phone call that I wanted to tell you about earlier, takes care of this problem.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I don't really want to say in front of everyone... think I might jinx it, so...<eos> I can't! I'm sorry.<eos> Then don't.<eos> Look, maybe what we do is...<eos> God! It really would, though.
Bobby and I will be in the car.<eos> Oh, hey, Jules, I know you and Ellie are the best of friends, but you've always taken time to make me feel special.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> This house could be ours.<eos> We could finally do it.<eos> We could start our new lives together and live here as a couple.<eos> We could get matching robes that say "Hers" and "Hers."<eos> I could finally wear all those vests that I love.<eos> You'd probably miss your stupid husband, though, right?<eos> Yeah, I would.
- You'll learn it, and you'll love it.<eos> - You learn it.<eos> Kat was a non-starter, I can guarantee you that.<eos> I figured that much out.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I was practically in love with her.<eos> In love... you loved her?<eos> I mean, we had this affair with each other when she first started working for me.<eos> It just didn't last very long, and it was obviously highly unprofessional.<eos> And I wouldn't...
- Am I crazy here?<eos> - No, you're not crazy.<eos> Look at the logo.<eos> That's our logo.<eos> He's just straight-up copying us.<eos> I mean, what the hell is he thinking with this?<eos> I really... h-h-he's, you know, a free spirit.<eos> Yeah, that's one way to put it.<eos> You two are still friends, right?<eos> - I wouldn't exactly...
I took a look at the report.<eos> The names she called you.<eos> Talentless.<eos> Leech.<eos> Pansy.<eos> Then you get sick.<eos> I can't imagine that turned her into Florence Nightingale all of a sudden.<eos> Leo, I'm married.<eos> I get it.<eos> Any man would.
My name is...<eos> Jornatha.<eos> Jornatha?<eos> That's a-- That's such a beautiful name.<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that Danish?<eos> Is that like Swedish?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yes, Jornatha.<eos> I would.
I don't really want to go to a strip club with anyone, but I do have a meeting in 10 minutes, and it's 15 minutes away.<eos> Oh, I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate you patching things up with him.<eos> There's no need to thank me.<eos> I would do anything for the woman that I love...<eos> Even get a drink with Louis Litt.<eos> You here to talk about Anderton Software?<eos> Because your 24-hour Liberty Rail pass is up.<eos> Then I guess it's a good thing that just came in the mail for me.<eos> Maintenance records showing they replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains within six weeks after the derailment. Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?<eos> They wouldn't.
It's over, Ted.<eos> That right?<eos> I'll be out of your hair soon.<eos> On my way.<eos> Your mother's gone to get some food.<eos> Gonna do something for your, uh... for your deal, I guess.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Just her way.<eos> I'd like to help finish the kitchen before I leave, Ted.<eos> I really would.
"The blue" meaning sex without a condom?<eos> It was a committed relationship with three paranoid adults.<eos> Two of them get blood tested weekly.<eos> - And need I go into Alec's latex allergy?<eos> - God, please, don't. So you and your big glass of wine can shut it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry. And to be a single mother...<eos> It's no cakewalk, but I would help you.<eos> Everyone says that.<eos> But I would.
I was just trying to earn a living here.<eos> This is my business.<eos> Now it's our business. If you didn't write the code, who did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I traded for it on the wire.<eos> Deep Web user?<eos> What was their handle?<eos> I don't remember that kind of thing.<eos> I would tell you if I did.<eos> I would.
Why are you asking me about this?<eos> Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon and you're the only other person I can trust to know this.<eos> Okay, what are you asking me to do?<eos> I need to clear a route through the city.<eos> - Barricades, police cars. The works.<eos> - What am I to tell people?<eos> President's in town?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You think they'll believe you?<eos> - No, Joe. They wouldn't.
Special kind of hurricane.<eos> I got the recipe when I was tending bar in New Orleans.<eos> Locals used to dump it on graves, keep the evil away.<eos> How come you didn't bring hot Doug...<eos> I mean Doug?<eos> We broke up.<eos> Turns out it's really hard to maintain the intensity that you get with Internet communication.<eos> You wouldn't know what I'm talking about there.<eos> - It's a whole new thing.<eos> - Actually, I would.
- Nate Burns.<eos> I see you got a body in a fridge.<eos> I see you're reading our files.<eos> May I ask who called you here?<eos> Technically, it was me.<eos> Well, when Dr. Isles ran your victim's prints, it alerted us.<eos> The victim's on an international criminal database, so we've been after him for a while.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Name's Yuri Yevtushok, though he has a lot of aliases.<eos> I would, too.
as an aging spinster?<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, it's just, uh, you know, how you solved this, uh... [inhales deeply] Okay, forget it.<eos> [clears throat] So, anyway, um, a friend of mine gave me this gift certificate for a seafood restaurant, and I'm wondering if you'd like to go.<eos> How's that celibacy experiment going?<eos> Uh, well, it's off... in theory.<eos> In theory?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you like to go?<eos> I would...
No, Walter, she doesn't like me 'cause I'm Jewish.<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> No, I like to tease you.<eos> I love that you're Jewish.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I have issues.<eos> What kind of issues?<eos> If I told you, you wouldn't like me.<eos> Nobody would.
He was dangerous.<eos> - That is not true. - He could've hurt any one of those kids.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Is there any documentation as to the injuries sustained by young Hugo Weshler?<eos> Your Honor, it's too soon.<eos> He's still feeling the effects.<eos> Okay.<eos> Miss Saltire, would the prosecution consider accepting some sort of compromise, pleading this down to violation?<eos> It would go on his record.<eos> My client would not, not under any circumstances.
He was an inventor.<eos> He wanted to try out spices.<eos> Sweet when it was supposed to have salt and sour when it was supposed to be sugar instead.<eos> There was no limit at all.<eos> And we just, "Oh, well, Magnus, wait, wait a bit.<eos> Are you sure about that?" "Oh, let's try it." "Okay."<eos> When he was given boring, traditional recipes, you can't change them because the recipe says like this. He didn't like that at all because he was...<eos> It was choking him and you could see it, it was choking him.<eos> The people who went to school with him, they say,<eos> "Oh, Magnus, I wouldn't...
- Can't have people...<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, she doesn't know what you do, Cal.<eos> You're not talking about me?<eos> No. No, Cal.<eos> Cal.<eos> Hey, man, I-- she's just really worried about me.<eos> Cal, I swear.<eos> I swear, man. I would never hurt--<eos> I would never--
Detective Flynn came to me with her theory about Janet Wong's involvement in the Derek Caster murder.<eos> I felt like the theory had merit, so I greenlit the investigation.<eos> You've known Detective Flynn a long time.<eos> We were partners back in the day.<eos> You're loyal to her and she's loyal to you.<eos> I believe I have the support of my whole team.<eos> But you had a personal relationship with Detective Flynn, correct?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> So, you wouldn't say she enjoys special consideration, even, uh, unintentionally?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Yeah, but he's not.<eos> None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> For my money, your story about the missing two months never added up.<eos> It still doesn't.<eos> This is the guy.<eos> - Come on, Castle.<eos> - No, this is the guy.<eos> That guy looks nothing like Chuck Norris.<eos> He would with a beard.
How so?<eos> Well, you know, I mean... [Chuckles]<eos> Well, it's, um... and the word it kind of... it matches...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You don't understand?<eos> Okay. Um, it's like if... if you, Ms. Nixon, were to call Mr. Travis fat.<eos> I-I don't think anyone...<eos> did you just call me fat?<eos> No.<eos> No! No, no, I would never...
- No, let me finish.<eos> I'm... I'm not anybody's idea of a great catch,<eos> I got that.<eos> I mean, look at my life, I work in a trailer trash discount store,<eos> I've got a book that summons evil spirits, but you know, before all that happened,<eos> I had a future, and it didn't involve, chainsaws, and shotguns, and demons, and I just wanna, I wanna see if I can find that guy again.<eos> Do you think you could help me?<eos> I don't know. Maybe?<eos> I'd like that, Amanda.<eos> I really would.
It's real.<eos> The Darkness... It's been locked away since the dawn of creation.<eos> And now it's free.<eos> Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.<eos> God help us.<eos> I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
Oh.<eos> That's mine.<eos> It's, uh... Australian money.<eos> Castle, this is very sweet.<eos> This is... very you.<eos> But... I don't think that it would be a good idea.<eos> Look, I-I know we're on a time-out right now a-and...<eos> But tomorrow's our anniversary, and I just can't bear the thought of spending it without you.<eos> I would love to.<eos> I really would.
Why don't you ask Josh if you can go to his house for Thanksgiving?<eos> He said he's "very attracted" to you, and we know what that means.<eos> Oh, God, don't even get me started.<eos> I don't even know what that means anymore.<eos> A guy says something like that, it means his current relationship is about ready to bite the dust.<eos> He's putting out feelers.<eos> If you could go to his house for the holiday...<eos> I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?<eos> Would I like to be surrounded by the unconditional love of a hundred Filipinos?<eos> Of course I would.
Gloria, thank you. I'm glad you said that.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> At least somebody's helping.<eos> Because that kind of language is counterproductive.<eos> Oh, snap.<eos> [ Snaps fingers ] This next exercise will teach us how to communicate our needs in a constructive and non-threatening manner.<eos> We do that all the time.<eos> Very constructively communicated.<eos> Would one of my couples like to help me demonstrate for the rest of the group?<eos> Yes, we would.
- Yeah.<eos> - Not too hipster?<eos> - It's a fine line.<eos> So you're into skiffle?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, didn't have the hair for disco.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - Yeah, love it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Who wouldn't!
Yes?<eos> If you saw how filthy it was, how messy.<eos> - Did you go in?<eos> - No, I mean the garden.<eos> They've ruined it.<eos> A woman lives there too, but you wouldn't think so.<eos> First of all, you are a man of God. You should be a model to your community.<eos> Shouldn't you be neat and tidy?<eos> Who is he? Do I know him?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
There is no message. lt's just me.<eos> What's just you?<eos> Your hair? Your clothes?<eos> I mean, I look at Macie...<eos> Women don't have to look like you want them to, Dad.<eos> No, women.<eos> But I'm talking about my teenage daughter. And I'm not trying to tell you what to wear or anything.<eos> I'm just trying to understand it.<eos> Well, who told you you had to understand?<eos> Why would you?
I gave him a killer blow job when I first got here.<eos> He's left me alone ever since.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's smart, I guess.<eos> Dude, I'm kidding.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> So what... what makes your blow jobs so killer?<eos> Well, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> - I would, yeah.
I'll handle everything.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> How did it go?<eos> - Didn't you watch?<eos> - l tried to, but...<eos> - She was great.<eos> Firm.<eos> - Good.<eos> You really didn't watch?<eos> Why would I?
What did we have?<eos> A life, waiting to be lived.<eos> That isn't how I recall it.<eos> I remember a young man being forced to marry a girl he'd seduced and made pregnant.<eos> Not true.<eos> No doubt, a little part of him was relieved when the baby was gone and he didn't have to marry.<eos> You were never meant for marriage, Aramis.<eos> That was clear even then.<eos> You wouldn't have been happy.<eos> With you, I would.
Me too.<eos> I really...<eos> Really thought you were deported.<eos> I was in a detention center for three months.<eos> But I applied for asylum, and so I got to stay.<eos> Who knew that was an option?<eos> Well, thanks for stopping by.<eos> Is Mr. Spence here?<eos> - I'd like to see him, too.<eos> - Of course you would. But...
- How did you do that?<eos> - Lost in thought.<eos> I was thinking of Tara, my hand slipped.<eos> Okay, you need to go to a doctor.<eos> - This is serious. - I know it is.<eos> I'm not even sure a doctor could help with this.<eos> I was thinking maybe your blood.<eos> The reverend told me not to give you any more blood.<eos> I don't care what he said.<eos> He wouldn't either.
Aw. This better change in the middle like in The Wizard of Oz.<eos> And subtitles, too?<eos> It's like seeing a boring movie and reading a horrible book at the same time.<eos> 400 Blows.<eos> They got half that title right.<eos> Shh. I'm a cop and I smell the pot.<eos> Do not shush me, Willie Nelson.<eos> Mike, unless you can sit here like a grown-up and not complain constantly, go wait in the lobby.<eos> You'd like that.<eos> Yeah, we all would.
But one minute, you're in love. And the next, you're supposed to be friends and pretend you're never in love and then get closure so you can do it all over again.<eos> Isn't it funny how un-evolved humans are?<eos> The whole purpose of life is to find love, and yet that's the thing that they're the worst at.<eos> That and dancing.<eos> They can't dance at all.<eos> Right?<eos> They look like they're actually worried that the rhythm is gonna get them.<eos> It's nice to talk to someone who's as confused about this stuff as I am.<eos> If you and I got together, we'd never break up, would we?<eos> No, we wouldn't, Reggie.
He wants to do an MRI scan tomorrow.<eos> This is the doctor that you slept with, right?<eos> Suddenly he's an expert?<eos> I have slept with you too.<eos> Just because I have sex with someone doesn't mean I can't see them for what they are.<eos> - Julie.<eos> - He's a good doctor.<eos> You know me, okay?<eos> You know that I would never let anything hurt Rosemary ever.<eos> What, and I would?
Meat is whatever the tiger says is meat, because<eos> God made him the boss and all the other animals his food!<eos> Hang on, buddy.<eos> And thank you, George Bore-well, for that clunky analogy in defense of totalitarianism, but I'm not feeding Shane an<eos> - Who the hell is...<eos> Oh, my God, he's totally a Shane.<eos> So let me bounce this off you - guys...<eos> - What say we don't launch this giant nerve gas missile at, uh... where did you say you were launching it?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> I would, actually.
Finally.<eos> Question... what has eight legs and likes to party? Me.<eos> The eight legs was a mislead.<eos> Myron, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, I overheard there was movie night and perhaps some drinking.<eos> And the truth is, things are looking pretty bleak at the office for the man you see before you...<eos> Myron.<eos> Um, well, would you like to come in and watch "Showgirls"?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
They're not easily come by, nor in common use.<eos> There's a fellow in Jamaica.<eos> Charlie Rider could easily acquire it for you.<eos> No.<eos> I need Rider to know about this like I need... a hole in the head?<eos> Hmm. I could improvise a device.<eos> I could have James Balfour's clock-making tools repurposed.<eos> You'd open my skull with clockmaker's tools?<eos> If you'd have me do so.<eos> I most certainly would not.
The recordings of the girls talking?<eos> Do you have anything to do with that?<eos> I heard Mrs. Hoving hired a private investigator.<eos> I paid money to make him and the evidence disappear.<eos> So, you "took care of it."<eos> I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
You don't know what you heard or didn't hear.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Jesus! Peter, you're scaring me.<eos> You should be scared.<eos> These people do not fuck around.<eos> What I wanted... to say to you... is that nobody should have to go through what you went through.<eos> Nobody.<eos> And if that guy shows up here again, I'd say it to his face.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> I really would.
But?<eos> I saw Pottinger's face when we sat across the table.<eos> He was laughing at me with his eyes.<eos> He knew something about the situation that I did not.<eos> I briefly considered the possibility that somehow you had betrayed me to him.<eos> But that rang hollow.<eos> You're a pal.<eos> So you think that Stahma...<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
We, um recently heard him speak at a social event.<eos> Oh, God, he's a drunk?<eos> - He's not a drunk.<eos> - Anymore.<eos> - And he's free.<eos> - Anyway, he says that you have to get Luke to sign his rights away before the adoption can go forward.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> Luke's dead-set against it. Hmm.<eos> Would you mind if I talked to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
I think there's something more to this girl.<eos> To how... we all fit together.<eos> My sister drew things.<eos> This looks like her.<eos> Pauline drew this?<eos> 20 years ago.<eos> Belonged to Chuck Thomson... the, uh... flight school pilot that crashed the day the dome fell.<eos> Looks like it's been sitting around a while.<eos> Does it fly?<eos> It'd better.
Suck his [Bleep]! Don't touch mine.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> - And you reek of weed.<eos> No, us?<eos> Uh, actually, that's go-kart fumes, and you'd know that if you would ever employee appreciate us every once in a while.<eos> All we want is an entire day where you thank us with go-karts and maybe a cotton candy machine and may... I was thinking maybe, like, the goo goo dolls could perform, and I could sing Iris with them onstage.<eos> - Yeah. - Personally,<eos> I don't want the world to see me, 'cause I don't think they'd understand.<eos> They wouldn't.
Wait... garage.<eos> Jay, Murray, we're looking for a corrugated aluminum garage door, the kind that rolls up.<eos> It could be a warehouse or an old firehouse.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> Fan out!<eos> Look for a corrugated garage door and then see if you can spot the van.<eos> Bennie, get rid of these four.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> I wouldn't.
-Is he called Ryan?<eos> -Who's told you that?<eos> Somebody mentioned it down in Hebden the other day.<eos> -Friend of a friend.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Somebody. I don't know, I can't remember.<eos> Well, who were you with?<eos> -Well, you wouldn't know 'em.<eos> -Try me.<eos> Well, you would.
So, we're gonna have to ask you to stay away from the complex for two weeks.<eos> And we've asked Jeremy's grandfather to do the same.<eos> Repeatedly.<eos> You're banning him from the complex?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> He was naked in front of children.<eos> No. My husband.<eos> Bow, we got to do something.<eos> And I'm sure even Dre would admit that he acted like an idiot.<eos> - Would, Dre?
How much who has in common?<eos> You and I.<eos> Like, that book you're reading,<eos> "The curious incident of the dog in the night-time"...<eos> I'm reading that, too.<eos> - You're reading?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, with the dog and the night-time and the curiosity and, like, the incident and the dog of it all.<eos> I'd love to talk way more about it sometime.<eos> - You would?
That's a collector's item.<eos> Also, not the modest mouse shirt!<eos> That's a special edition, too!<eos> [Chuckles] Got it.<eos> Dana: Geez, he's like "The Great Gatsby" of t-shirts.<eos> Whoa, you know what this is, Dana?<eos> This is a big none of your business.<eos> Stop snooping.<eos> Except, I mean, this is probably a present for me, so future Dana technically already owns this, and she wouldn't mind if I take a peek. Would you, future Dana?<eos> [Robotic voice] No, I wouldn't.
Kevin is just a little anxious.<eos> Maybe about going to bed. Well, did you give him his bedtime nuggets?<eos> - His what?<eos> - His bedtime nuggets.<eos> I told you... he needs two or three of those before he can go to sleep.<eos> His bedtime nuggets, of course.<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> Hey, Kevin, would you like some bedtime nuggets?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - I would.
Wonderful.<eos> Oh, and I'll take a bag of chips.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Just finished entertaining at a children's party.<eos> Mr. Berenstain was a big hit.<eos> How could you let her do this to me, Finch... tranq me like I'm some kind of animal?<eos> It was for your own good, Ms. Shaw.<eos> You are no longer safe from Samaritan's gaze, and you wouldn't listen to reason.<eos> He's right, Sam.<eos> You really wouldn't.
Oh, come on, the guy is guilty.<eos> Nobody thought otherwise until Castle over here started moonlighting for the mob.<eos> I think that might be overstating it a little.<eos> You took a blood oath.<eos> You let them turn you into an honorary mobster.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> RYAN:<eos> Come on, man. How many people outside of the mafia ever get to swear Omerta?<eos> I think it is an experience of a lifetime.<eos> Of course you would.
Please kill me.<eos> ♪ Now we don our gay apparel ♪ listen, you keep moving.<eos> Santa is very powerful magic.<eos> They'll be able to track him if you stop moving. Great.<eos> Road trip with a psychotic shape-shifting avatar of goodwill.<eos> Santa thinks that will be a mouthful to say every time you want to get Santa's attention.<eos> Fine.<eos> Nick, I'll go with Nick.<eos> Santa does not understand why Colonel Baird hates Christmas.<eos> The real Santa would.
He didn't believe in it.<eos> avoided the word as too sentimental.<eos> There were only three things that were important to him:<eos> desire, pleasure and security.<eos> Desire...<eos> I don't trust people who don't drink.<eos> Have a cigarette.<eos> you're okay?<eos> João still loves to smoke.<eos> He would.
It don't bother none.<eos> You want me to prop it up some?<eos> You all right?<eos> It's just on a bump... it kinda grinds together a little bit on a bump.<eos> But it don't bother nothing.<eos> Is it because Jewel's mother is a horse, Darl?<eos> Is that why he went away?<eos> That's part of it.<eos> Hey, Cash, you want me to tighten this?<eos> If you just would.
Besides, I didn't marry you for your jokes.<eos> I married you because you're honest, and dependable, and not to mention incredibly sexy.<eos> Well, I think that's it for the gifts, everybody.<eos> Help yourselves to an authentic Mexican buffet, compliments of my dear father, and the ladies from Ole Mole!<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Fan of Baja, California, huh, Lloyd?<eos> Oh, uh, yes, well, um, I'm a bit of a geography nut.<eos> With this new phone, I can dial up maps from all over the world.<eos> Uh, would you like to see Swedish Lapland?<eos> - Boy, would I?
Forgive me.<eos> I'm not asking for an apology, I'm asking why.<eos> Tell me!<eos> She didn't like me.<eos> She didn't like you?<eos> - Did you do something to her? - No.<eos> Why didn't she like you?<eos> She thought there was something between us.<eos> She thought that?<eos> Why would she?
I got kept behind at school.<eos> Why?<eos> For not liking the Germans.<eos> What does Martha Lane say about that cough?<eos> She's planning a walkout.<eos> She's a fine woman.<eos> In what way?<eos> Every way.<eos> You like her?<eos> What man wouldn't?
Sam.<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> Why are you afraid of me?<eos> I only want what's best for you.<eos> What were you doing in my room?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You burned me with your cigarette.<eos> Does that sound like something a man would do to his little girl?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> No one else would either.
They're going to give me light duties around the barracks.<eos> Why aren't you going home?<eos> They don't really want me back and, to be honest, that is fine with me.<eos> Who don't?<eos> Your mum don't?<eos> Well, her new boyfriend.<eos> She said...<eos> Well, she reckons it might for be the best.<eos> In case it causes arguments.<eos> Which it would, so...
Mr. French didn't stay up with you -to watch the end of the programme?<eos> -No, he went to bed.<eos> Look in there.<eos> -What do you reckon?<eos> -I reckon you were quite something.<eos> 34-22-34.<eos> Show him.<eos> Mrs. Spears, how long have you been a resident here?<eos> 44-44-44, wouldn't you say?<eos> -I wouldn't, no.
- Raymond Tusk.<eos> The President wants to tap him as the new V.P.<eos> - You and I cannot let that happen.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.<eos> Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.<eos> Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.<eos> This one would.
You know, it occurs to me that once you've accepted my offer of an apprenticeship, you should probably start taking notes.<eos> I'm not becoming your apprentice.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Not in an official capacity.<eos> More likely you'll peddle some fiction to my father about me not being ready to be alone yet. Hmm?<eos> Whatever your pride dictates, I shan't hold it against you.<eos> You know I'm not staying, right?<eos> What?<eos> And continue your journey to profound professional satisfaction?<eos> Why would you?
No.<eos> You all right, kitten?<eos> I think I might've gotten Miss Claudette really mad at me.<eos> Look, you know how some people have imaginary friends?<eos> I think you might have imaginary enemies.<eos> What did she say to you?<eos> Miss Claudette?<eos> No, Alex.<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yes, I would.
So that's almost a belief in God.<eos> How is that almost a belief in God?<eos> I have a husband who believes in God and a daughter who might...<eos> - And what about Zach?<eos> - I don't know. But I don't.<eos> But the point is you could believe in God.<eos> But I don't.<eos> Yes, but if Jesus were to show up in your office right now, you'd believe in him, wouldn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you would.
I'm supposed to go out for a little while, but if you're still feeling obsessed, I can stay.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I've been neglecting my hobby. and discuss conspiracy theories.<eos> Your hobby is conspiracy theories?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> They're pure sophistry.<eos> Large groups of people cannot keep secrets.<eos> My hobby is conspiracy theorists.<eos> I adore them.<eos> As one would a barmy uncle.
Maybe tears the baby out, kills it separate.<eos> How'd he blow it with you, anyway?<eos> You'll understand if I'm not really in a sharing place right now.<eos> Man. Don't tell me he stepped out on you.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you anything.<eos> I'm afraid you're wasting your time.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> All you boys can do now is make things worse for yourselves.<eos> If I were you, I'd drop my gun, lay down on my tummy, and put my hands behind my head.<eos> - You would?
You're really easy to talk to, Teresa.<eos> Thanks, Bob.<eos> Are there any new lines of inquiry on Red John?<eos> We've had some leads, but... I hate to admit it-- we're kind of stuck.<eos> Nothing.<eos> What about Jane?<eos> I don't think he has anything.<eos> But he'd tell you if he did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he would. Okay.
He must feel the whip, Edmund.<eos> Why, Fred?<eos> To what end?<eos> We may not strike at Jedediah Shine or Silas Duggan through him.<eos> We may not strike at those men at all.<eos> What, then?<eos> Say, imagine, we might, you and I, walk into a chophouse on the Commercial Road and in that chophouse we... lay our hands up on the shoulder of the man the world made The Ripper, know him unequivocally for that killer, what would we do?<eos> There is what I would like to do. And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.
I know how to do that, it's just this in-between part.<eos> Oh, it's so confusing.<eos> I didn't ask you to be my fiancée for God sake.<eos> I asked you to be my wife.<eos> We should've just skipped this whole part.<eos> I know, right?<eos> It's like Chutes and Ladders. Yup, zoom.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Well, that wouldn't be the most rational move.<eos> No, no, it wouldn't.
And now they've put it on a stamp.<eos> That's more dreadful heritage Britain nonsense, isn't it?<eos> It gets worse, look at that one!<eos> That is The Archers as a postage stamp.<eos> Why don't they put something modern on it?<eos> You could put the McLaren or the Bentley Mulsanne on it, that would be fantastic on a stamp.<eos> I mean, the French wouldn't do a stamp that had an old bloke on a bicycle and a stripy T-shirt with some onions, would they?<eos> That's what that is!<eos> The Germans wouldn't do a stamp with a half-track just outside Warsaw.<eos> Exactly. No, they really wouldn't.
Excellent show of patience, luv.<eos> And that what defeats a nasty little boy.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Is rum your solution to everything?<eos> It certainly doesn't hurt.<eos> So just how did you unlock the map?<eos> I did what Pan asked.<eos> And just who are you, Swan?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Perhaps I would.
My eyes!<eos> Put that thing away.<eos> Weaver is, uh, it... he's just right.<eos> What's your favorite position? Have you tried a Moroccan mustache?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh. It's like a Moroccan cigar, except you don't use as much upper body strength.<eos> A reverse bat cave is my favorite.<eos> - I love a King Henry.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
Acquitted on both.<eos> Right.<eos> Lack of evidence.<eos> Couldn't find the goods.<eos> Not the case this time.<eos> You're a long way from your condo in South Florida, Gregorek.<eos> Hear the weather's great down there in the winter.<eos> Is that your off-season?<eos> - I like the sunshine.<eos> - Who wouldn't, after a few months in the sewer?
- A fan of the Rising Tide, some rich girl in a flower dress.<eos> She knew all about me, said I had a gift.<eos> She thought people like us deserved more.<eos> Oh, you deserve more.<eos> She pointed me to a Chinese S.H.I.E.L.D. feed ... - wanted me to crack it.<eos> - You thought that was harmless?<eos> I checked the data stream.<eos> It didn't seem like anything you and I hadn't already put out there, Skye.<eos> And I traced the account where the money came from to make sure it wasn't some evil corporation. It was just an eco-research lab.<eos> - Otherwise, I would never ...
You always lived at home, Lyle?<eos> I tried living on my own for a little bit, but it didn't work out.<eos> And when was that?<eos> 7 years ago.<eos> It was an SRO.<eos> Full of rejects and roaches.<eos> And that's why you moved back home?<eos> I like living in a house better. Is that a crime?<eos> You like having a backyard?<eos> Who wouldn't?
It has to be the worst crime in the world to give your child away.<eos> I know you don't believe me but I did it for you.<eos> The reasons you use to blame me are the reasons that I had to give you away.<eos> What kind of life would you have with a ma like me?<eos> Every day I promise meself I won't be drunk. And then every day, I find meself with a glass in me hand.<eos> I had to free you from me and the only way that I could do that was to have another drink inside me.<eos> I have lied to you, yes.<eos> But you tell me, if you can tell the truth, would it have been a better life if you'd stayed with me than the one that you've had?<eos> No.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
Yes.<eos> I think you might think I'm a therapist.<eos> I am not a therapist.<eos> But therapy could be good for you.<eos> I need your advice.<eos> I have a suspect, some evidence.<eos> The person who told me about the suspect, the person who gave me said evidence...<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> How would you proceed if you were me?<eos> I wouldn't.
You think.<eos> Your mom didn't...<eos> Your mom didn't punish you? No.<eos> Stop it! Stop it!<eos> Yeah, she grounded me for three weeks.<eos> And yet you're here?<eos> How bout your Dad?<eos> He says I have to help him in the garage after school for a month.<eos> Huh, like I mind!<eos> Man, who would?
"Bringing the beauty of the world to the beauty of Koda Lake."<eos> Something about that deer you don't particularly like, son?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I was...<eos> I was looking on my map and I hit it with my car.<eos> And that wasn't enough?<eos> No, I just didn't want it to suffer.<eos> And you wouldn't call some guy pounding her head with a 20 pound rock 'suffer'?<eos> No...<eos> - You wouldn't?
Okay.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Race number four.<eos> Six furlongs.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I see.<eos> My bay the girl breezed this morning...<eos> I was wondering if your guy Jenkins would like to ride him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We sure as hell would, sir.
You know, they do weddings in vegas.<eos> Uh... It's permanently off the docket.<eos> I think I exhausted even myself this last time around.<eos> Sorry, janie.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> You know, colleen called it a long time ago.<eos> So, you're saying there's a chan-- no.<eos> I wouldn't 'cause you already did.<eos> But I could.<eos> But I wouldn't.
Evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> You look well.<eos> Well, and you.<eos> Enough.<eos> I cannot watch any more.<eos> Constable Noakes, would you like to take Nurse Browne to the pictures on Friday evening?<eos> I...<eos> Simple question. Yes or no.<eos> Yes, I would.
- You have every right.<eos> You're a king.<eos> That's not the kind of king I want to be.<eos> What kind do you want to be?<eos> I don't know. The good kind.<eos> Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.<eos> I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.<eos> I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.<eos> I'd like to hear you play the harp. No.<eos> No, you would not.
We all like to see that pretty smile.<eos> Cold, though.<eos> - No.<eos> - Frigid.<eos> - No.<eos> - Not to you?<eos> You been there, Jim?<eos> No!<eos> I'm a married man, Hitch.<eos> You would, though, wouldn't you?
I'll be here just in case.<eos> All right.<eos> No.<eos> You okay?<eos> Would you j... would you just go?<eos> I had a bad day.<eos> I lost a patient and... and...<eos> Normally, I would...<eos> Tell you about it.<eos> And I would... I would, um...
And we still don't know who killed Fred.<eos> Actually, I may have a lead on that.<eos> Epthelials under Fred's nails belonged to one of the Hicks brothers.<eos> Fred attacked me.<eos> Look, that's how I got these.<eos> That's why you're reluctant to give us your DNA.<eos> You were afraid we were gonna connect you to Fred.<eos> Like I told you, he attacked me.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Dwayne.<eos> I really would.
Well, I was really hoping I could, uh, see the Hudson Group panel.<eos> Maybe you could tell me what time that's at.<eos> No. Your break is over!<eos> Yeah, she's a real charmer, isn't she?<eos> Maybe you should get a nicer boss. You know what?<eos> I would if I could.<eos> Hey, man, maybe you could help me out.<eos> Yeah, look, I don't know, man.<eos> It'd piss her off if I did, you know?<eos> Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
Out of the house?<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean, I can't have my lady cooking on Valentine's Day.<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> And don't go too expensive...<eos> st somewhere where, you know, the spoon and the fork are two separate things. Of course.<eos> I mean, what was I gonna do, take you to Taco Bell and bowling?<eos> You wouldn't like that.<eos> Would you?<eos> No, I would not.
They don't have a job for her in Atlanta, DC, or New York.<eos> Mackenzie-- line up any 10 people, eight of them will tell you she's the best EP in the business and the other two will be stupid!<eos> I'm one of the eight, but it's not gonna happen.<eos> - It's happened. - No.<eos> She's coming up from DC today with one of her people.<eos> No, listen to what I'm telling you-- I can't give my approval.<eos> The deal's a day away from being signed-- three years.<eos> I have approval over my executive producer.<eos> - You would think so, wouldn't you?<eos> - I would, yeah.
I'm not like that anymore.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I would never hurt someone that I...<eos> I wouldn't do that again.<eos> Hey, good for you.<eos> I'm so happy I could help you grow.<eos> Tariq, I'm sor...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If I could go back and change what I did...<eos> I would.
But...?<eos> It's our opinion...<eos> Alden, you took her home.<eos> The sex-- at least the beginning of it-- was consensual.<eos> I think you need to let this one go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Would you say that to a woman?<eos> By starting to get physical, she loses the right to say "Stop"?<eos> You would never say that.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
At once.<eos> Come in.<eos> I thought we might review your probation, Denise.<eos> You know that there are a hundred girls out there that can take your place.<eos> Come closer.<eos> Do you like it here?<eos> I do, sir.<eos> Then you'd like to remain at your post?<eos> It is a simple enough question, Denise.<eos> I would, sir.
Tell me!<eos> Are you a thief? !<eos> - I don't know anything!<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> - Why would you steal this?<eos> I don't know!<eos> You little runt, are you going to pull a stunt like that again?<eos> I don't know what you're going to make of yourself like that.<eos> Do you know?<eos> Why would you...
It's like she's looking right at me.<eos> You know this kid in the count room... Henry?<eos> Been thinking about it. It's not worth the risk.<eos> After we're done here, you and me... we're going to care of him.<eos> He's a good kid, Johnny; He's not going to say anything.<eos> Why take a chance?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> That's a pile of crap.<eos> If I told you, I could go to prison.<eos> Yeah, you probably would.
Baldness is for women's crotches, not men's heads.<eos> There you go, that's pretty gross.<eos> Yeah, that's the spirit, Quagmire.<eos> Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up with me the last couple weeks.<eos> Hey, no problem.<eos> You put up with me when I was barefoot guy.<eos> Boy, nothing like a beer with the fellas, eh?<eos> Peter, would you mind putting on some shoes?<eos> Oh, you mean foot prisons?<eos> Yes, I would.
Dude, I've got heavy nuts for this chick.<eos> I want to inseminate her.<eos> Romantically.<eos> Then you should.<eos> Live life, you know, go for it.<eos> Carpe diem.<eos> This one's strawberries and apples.<eos> But she's Ralph's property.<eos> I mean, whether or not "shotgun" would hold up in a court of law, that's for the lawyers to decide.<eos> It wouldn't.
Enormous.<eos> Look!<eos> You don't want to miss it!<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you live alone?<eos> Umm... sort of.<eos> It's actually not to far from here.<eos> I'd like to see where you really live.<eos> No you wouldn't.
Horrible.<eos> Well, I hope this works.<eos> If I lose all my money, I am sunk.<eos> What if this wasn't a good idea?<eos> "If."<eos> There were so many better ways for Bobby to spend that money.<eos> I mean, he could have, say, put it all in a pile and set it on fire.<eos> You didn't let him down.<eos> If I did, it would kick major ass.<eos> No, it wouldn't...
I have to work.<eos> Here, on the island, I can work only two months a year, cleaning houses for tourists.<eos> And you, too, Filippo. What's your future here?<eos> I'll take tourists out on the boat.<eos> In summer.<eos> We both have to work. Winter, too.<eos> And what do I do?<eos> Be alone my whole life?<eos> Stay here with me. Wouldn't you like that?<eos> Yes, I would.
Bring me food. Lots of food.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Should you be up?<eos> You do look a lot better.<eos> Just a fever.<eos> Tomorrow we'll go to Camelot to see this Guinevere.<eos> Morgan, I'm sorry.<eos> She's still outside.<eos> I tried to move her, but she wouldn't go.<eos> Of course she wouldn't.
But for me, for what I do, it's never JUST business... cos everything I do, I do for my family, and anyone who threatens me threatens them.<eos> You understand?<eos> So... what's your plan?<eos> To turn the ã1 million that I owe you into ten in three months.<eos> And how will you do this?<eos> To begin with, I'll need a single shipment from you of 200 kilos, on account.<eos> You know how much that is worth to me?<eos> Three million at 15 grand a kilo.<eos> But I'm willing to pay you back at 20, which would create an extra ã1 million on that shipment.<eos> - As it would a fourfold increase in your debt.
Auctus... work the palus until gannicus joins us.<eos> Oenomaus!<eos> This one is too small!<eos> I would have something the size of a man!<eos> Barca.<eos> Do as your Doctore commands.<eos> Yes, Dominus.<eos> Come. Let us see what is between your legs.<eos> The Gaul winces from spear...<eos> As he would from my cock!
Whatever is happening, how can you not say anything to the people who love you?<eos> - Why would you-<eos> I told you not to worry about me.<eos> - Oh right, your note.<eos> Josh, did you ever think that the one thing not to say to Jewish parents is "don't worry"?<eos> Please.<eos> Please, just tell me what's going on with you.<eos> - You wouldn't underand.<eos> - Try.<eos> - You wouldn't.
My name is Chris, and I like candy and jumping and colorful birds. Wow!<eos> What else do I like?<eos> You like the pop singing of today.<eos> ♪ Two, three, ich berleg' bei mir ♪<eos> ♪ Ihr' nas'n spricht daf whrenddessen ich noch rauch' ♪ ♪ Die special places sind ihr wohlbekannt ♪<eos> Yay!<eos> That was the German-est thing I've ever seen.<eos> I'm so glad you like it, Chris.<eos> Would you like to try?<eos> Oh, boy, would I? !
He... yeah, he'll save her.<eos> I don't like to think of Sammy with the blood of an innocent on his hands.<eos> Not so innocent.<eos> Being involved in missile strikes that kill civilians?<eos> No...<eos> She's the last hostage.<eos> She's merely the airport shuttle driver.<eos> Mr. Black is a zealot.<eos> He believes harming innocents is evil, so why keep the driver for last?<eos> Why would...
What can you tell me about this fine circa-1980s polyester jacket<eos> - for $120?<eos> - It's vintage.<eos> It's nice.<eos> You called me but you didn't leave a message.<eos> I'll give you either, A, I panicked or, B, I just really wanted to hear your voice on your message.<eos> I kind of like both options.<eos> So seriously, would you like to have coffee with me again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Seriously, I would.
Yeah, I can still smell it.<eos> Thursday 23rd of September.<eos> I interview a young man about a non-existent post at the University, and leave him in tears.<eos> The feeling of making a man cry about a make-believe job is not unpleasant, and I leave my office with a modest erection.<eos> You don't really look like your photo.<eos> Don't I?<eos> I suppose I have a bit more make-up on there.<eos> And more hair.<eos> I'd say it was bigger, I wouldn't say there was more hair.<eos> I would.
I honestly wish I could give you a great answer, but she went for a walk.<eos> I guess there was a little bit of boy trouble earlier.<eos> And you believe her?<eos> Yeah, I believe her.<eos> Good.<eos> It's just that most kids we pick up at the time of night aren't just out walking.<eos> It's usually for drugs or something like that.<eos> Well, you don't know Chloe.<eos> It's just sometimes other people see things that parents don't...<eos> Or would rather not.
Yeah, you thought him saying,<eos> "Evan R. Lawson, CFO of Hankmed" was just a phase too.<eos> Wishful thinking, I guess.<eos> - You know what I wish?<eos> I wish there was a fake Today Show I could hire to interview him.<eos> Then he'd stop.<eos> You know, I have a friend in the Suffolk College Media Department... she might be able to arrange something like that.<eos> But wouldn't that be cruel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it would.
There you go.<eos> Drink that down. Very good.<eos> I think someone in here wants to keep Bernie incoherent.<eos> Who?<eos> I'm in charge of all pharmacology, so I'll make sure you'll only get sugar pills.<eos> Dr. Elliot. He's in charge of medication.<eos> - It must be him.<eos> - Why would Elliot want Bethel to stay insane? That doesn't make any sense.<eos> He's the one who put Bethel on the original dose, why would he wanna reverse the process?<eos> He wouldn't.
Daniel...<eos> Your father and I are leaving.<eos> Thank you for a lovely party, Mrs. Grayson.<eos> It was great meeting both of you.<eos> Well, now that you've moved in next door, I suppose we'll be seeing a lot of you this summer.<eos> I'll expect you shortly, Daniel.<eos> Don't let my mom rattle you.<eos> Intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her.<eos> I'd hate to be on her bad side.<eos> Yes, you would.
The president wrote up an apology.<eos> That's- - That's nice.<eos> But I'm not sure how much that'll help him.<eos> We also called his mortgage lender and worked everything out.<eos> He's not gonna lose his house.<eos> That's great.<eos> Listen, Allie, um...<eos> I was wondering if sometime you might want to--<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
Which, clearly, you aren't.<eos> Are you really having this conversation right now in front of me?<eos> I would have preferred a different tactic.<eos> Well, I had to fight dirty, babe.<eos> She was a nasty ho-bag.<eos> And never stood a chance.<eos> You were the sexiest girl that I'd ever seen.<eos> It was a damn good bra.<eos> My mother's risk bore a reward.<eos> And maybe mine would too.
You were right.<eos> I am in love with Grace, I am totally obsessed with her.<eos> But I can't have Grace because Grace is with her current boyfriend, Daniel.<eos> And as you know, graduation is coming up and I don't want it to be like the senior dance.<eos> I don't want to ask Grace to go and have her drag Daniel along again.<eos> So I'd like you to go with me.<eos> And I hope you don't think I'm being a jerk because I'm being totally honest with you.<eos> And since you and I were girlfriend and boyfriend for years, you think you could possibly go with me, for old times' sake? As a friend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You would?
Who -- to whom you are forbidden to speak!<eos> I locked you down here so you couldn't contact my mother, not so you could, whatever, sow disharmony!<eos> You're sowing plenty all by yourself.<eos> Face it kid, you're a bust as a pirateking.<eos> King, exactly! And unless you want to spend the rest of the afternoon with a bunch of scorpions, don't forget it!<eos> And remember, this is a rescue mission.<eos> I heard you.<eos> So don't charge in there all crazy, machine-gunning everything in sight.<eos> When have I -- I'm sure you'd love it - if Sterling were killed in some huge crossfire.<eos> - Wh-? No I wouldn't!
! Yes!<eos> Because I... I was in her house, and I was getting inspired, and I... I went to her closet, and they were...<eos> they were so spectacular.<eos> I know.<eos> And then a minute later, there's sirens, and I can't get the damn boots off!<eos> I panicked, and I ran to that car with those boots on.<eos> Well, why didn't you tell me?<eos> I really couldn't say anything.<eos> You'd never forgive me.<eos> Of course I would.
I'm going to try and put her down.<eos> All right, well, yeah.<eos> Come on, I'll help you.<eos> I don't know who to trust any more.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> Ellie...<eos> Ellie, look at me.<eos> You know, if I was found dead, it would look like I'd killed myself, wouldn't it?<eos> Don't don't talk like this.<eos> It would, though, wouldn't it?
We'II show yourpregnancy to people with this.<eos> Afternine months I'm going to take and bring the kid like you have given birth to it.<eos> Why wait fornine months?<eos> Go and bring the kid now.<eos> No way!<eos> Everyone should think that its my baby.<eos> And you will say so.<eos> Where on earth does something like that happen?<eos> will they believe us?<eos> Of course they would. Why wouldn't they?
They have private security.<eos> Autonomous security.<eos> I'm autonomous myself.<eos> These are the facts:<eos> One of their secure facilities was penetrated.<eos> Three people died making their escape.<eos> A fourth, an employee who may have been involved has been killed.<eos> - By Northmoor security?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> No one would.
Where's the kid?<eos> -He ran off. -Um...<eos> I don't know who you are, but can I trust you?<eos> Trust me?<eos> What happened here was not random.<eos> His boss wants me dead.<eos> I only hope it's quick when it happens, you know?<eos> Like with him, I mean...<eos> I mean, I almost wish that it would just happen now, you know?<eos> So I wouldn't...
You guys would do this for each other, right?<eos> If Ben tried to go to law school for me, I'd die an old man in prison.<eos> Don't worry about it, I Wouldn't do it.<eos> You wouldn't?<eos> I mean, I'd want to help and all, but I don't think I could give up what I really wanted to do.<eos> Which is what?<eos> Sleep till noon and hang out at the mall?<eos> Shut up.<eos> What, you'd do it for me?<eos> Yeah. I would.
I don't know this office doesn't handle petty larceny.<eos> This isn't petty larceny.<eos> This idea potentially worth millions of dollars.<eos> - Millions?<eos> - Yes. You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you.<eos> Sir, I actually don't think you're in any position to make that call.<eos> I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call<eos> Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told us to do in your freshmen address.<eos> I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.<eos> - You would?
I should go.<eos> I'm gonna be really late.<eos> Sure.<eos> You don't want your mum turning you into a toad, eh?<eos> Can I see you later, Fergal?<eos> I dunno.<eos> OK, but...<eos> Would you like to?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would.
It means me too, father.<eos> PORTRAIT OF A BIRD KILLER<eos> "Victory is never neutral or undeserved.<eos> Victory is never neutral or undeserved.<eos> You must avoid the defeated...<eos> You must avoid the defeated..."<eos> Shit!<eos> "... like you would the plague".<eos> You dropped this.<eos> "... like you would the plague".
You think I did this?<eos> Well, we know you got cash flow problems, Especially as far as the v. A.T. Man is concerned, And it wouldn't be the first time you cut your losses.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> Look, I was young.<eos> Decided to try my hand at the music business.<eos> It didn't work out.<eos> As for the v.A.T. , my accountant stuffed up. That was all.<eos> I'm getting it sorted.<eos> But a nice big insurance claim should help a lot.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Murder.<eos> Help me.<eos> Maybe, like, there was a murder done here, in this house, maybe, like, when it was built...<eos> I'm not sleeping in a house with a ghost in it.<eos> We need like an exorcist.<eos> Yeah, right, cos I'm sure they're listed in the local small ads.<eos> Actually, Rowena, it's erm... funny you should say that.<eos> Dr Belisarius says he last saw Willard mid-afternoon.<eos> I suppose an alibi'd be too much to hope for.<eos> Of course it would.
It's okay.<eos> We won't eat much.<eos> Leonard had only been with us a short while, but if you saw him walking a trail up at the lakes or riding a horse, you could see that he was home.<eos> So remember the old words.<eos> When a friend dies, we should not cry.<eos> We should not hate someone or fight.<eos> We should do right always.<eos> And we should listen to the old words and remember Leonard.<eos> If anyone else has something to say...<eos> Oh, I would.
We'll have something to show you in the morning.<eos> But the suspense is killing me.<eos> Well, I kind of was on my way out.<eos> Let me just see where we are.<eos> I guess I've got a minute.<eos> Okay.<eos> We thought that Samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth, and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.<eos> Is this a substance much like bullshit?<eos> I thought we could drop one off the Eiffel Tower, with a countdown, like the moon shot and show how it doesn't break.<eos> -But it would, wouldn't it?
I just saw the "Open House" sign, and...<eos> All right, well, great.<eos> So, it's two bedrooms, one bath.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you think a piano would fit through that door?<eos> Upright or grand?<eos> Well, it's not Elton John's piano.<eos> It's mine. Upright.<eos> My guess is it would, yeah.<eos> It would?
That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!<eos> Exactly.<eos> They say it finally solves the submarine controversy. Did-<eos> - Leonard?<eos> I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.<eos> Oh! Good.<eos> I'm eight for 26 this month.<eos> Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.<eos> Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.<eos> Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.
Pizza Shack, how can I service your hunger attack?<eos> You can turn around.<eos> Lauren?<eos> God!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> - I'm seducing you, Mr. Anderson.<eos> - Well, don't!<eos> I thought you'd like it.<eos> I do.<eos> I would.
They did not stop any more than they absolutely had to.<eos> I've pulled some hair samples I'm certain are gonna correspond with the hair samples from the crates.<eos> I mean, it's the same guys.<eos> - Yes.<eos> These men are hunters.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those.<eos> You should see your dad.<eos> How would that help the case?<eos> Oh, it wouldn't.
J... yeah, this is Jimmy Ford.<eos> Say, I got some good news for you.<eos> Yeah, I got the ledger right here.<eos> What... what would you want to do that for?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, Jimmy Ford for Bridgette O'Hare.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ronin Donnelly, I worked for your father for 30 years.<eos> I wouldn't...
Makes it all bigger.<eos> There's no way I could come up with that. I wouldn't come up with that now. And yet they did that three and a half thousand years ago.<eos> Slept all right once I got off, really.<eos> There's a cat mooching about now and again. Wandering in.<eos> I suppose that's the problem when you haven't got a front door.<eos> That was a good night.<eos> Best night since I've been here. - Yeah?<eos> - I'd do it again, you know?<eos> Whilst I've been in this part of the world, there's not many things that have happened that I'd say, "I'd do that again."<eos> But that, I would.
Our warmonger president is killing innocent Muslims, instead of giving us peace like he promised.<eos> America will learn to respect Muslim people and the holy laws of Sharia.<eos> She asked for a Koran, then lawyered up.<eos> If Sharia won't save you, there's always the US Constitution.<eos> What about her fiancé?<eos> He skipped the campground after we left, but we found this on her computer.<eos> Blue-eyed all-American jihadi terror cell.<eos> With enough explosives to take down the Staples Center.<eos> If they know what they're doing.<eos> Walker would.
Henry? He pulled through.<eos> He's in his room, talking to his hap girlfriend on skype.<eos> We took care of the vigil.<eos> We rescheduled it for next week.<eos> I... killed him.<eos> I could not... Stop myself.<eos> I get it.<eos> But he murdered a dozen people, and he was planning to kill more.<eos> Look, deep down, nobody minds what you did.<eos> Father Jensen... He would.
This may be able to lead us to our two remaining thieves.<eos> Got a lot of evidence, and not a lot of answers.<eos> Stay positive.<eos> What would you do?<eos> What would I do what?<eos> If you found millions of dollars of gems in the street?<eos> Give 'em back.<eos> Oh, come on, guy.<eos> You wouldn't keep some?<eos> Why, would you?
Did I do som'thin' wrong?<eos> Yeah, a big one too!<eos> Can't you see why Hani has studied so desperately?<eos> - You're just a moron!<eos> You stupid... - That so?<eos> Hey, Hani... you still lik' Seung-Jo... huh?<eos> Aft'r all that dissing he's given to ya, you still have it fo' him?<eos> So, that's lik' ya like that kinda pretty boy styl'?<eos> No! Never!<eos> Why would I?
Fine, the potting shed.<eos> Who does he think I am,<eos> Prince Rainier of Monaco?<eos> What if I got married instead of going to college?<eos> - Married?<eos> - Married.<eos> Well, it would depend on who it was, of course.<eos> - Would it?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> - Well, of course it would.
You don't like Echo, do you, Mr Dominic?<eos> It's not that I don't like her. It's that sometimes I worry you do.<eos> Your objections have been noted.<eos> Thank you, Mr Dominic.<eos> –Hello, Echo.<eos> –Hello.<eos> I had an exam.<eos> That's good.<eos> Would you like to have some lunch now?<eos> I would.
So you found the tapes.<eos> I was going to mail those to you.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> Your son had tremendous spirit.<eos> He lasted longer than any of the others.<eos> I had to amputate my finger where he bit it.<eos> The little bastard.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would...
When he talked about it, he burst out into tears.<eos> You know, he was more upset about that than he was about Meriel.<eos> Well, she lied to him and he hates her for it.<eos> Cam thinks that I should've deceived Sweets, too.<eos> You know, I don't understand.<eos> Our lives are devoted to the pursuit of truth.<eos> Bones, you can't go around telling everybody what's on your mind even though it's the truth.<eos> Okay, look, what if you and I were going out, right, and you were, you know, taking forever to get ready and you came out in this dress, and I told you I didn't like it. What are you gonna do?<eos> I'd reevaluate, change, or ignore you.<eos> Of course you would, Bones, good answer.
You mean like he's Mick Jagger and we're a bunch of roadies?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We made that motherfucker.<eos> I'd like to be in business with you.<eos> - That I might regret.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
I-i know you were just looking out for me.<eos> And rachel--well, she, uh, She turned out to be not who I thought she was or at least not anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, too, son.<eos> Dad, you were right about this, but I think you... Need to give me space to make my own mistakes.<eos> Well... Lucky for you, you'll be at yale soon.<eos> You can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing,<eos> b., I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I know that was rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> Why would you?
All right, then.<eos> Just try and be still.<eos> So you've seen stuff like this before, right?<eos> A patient with a 4-inch blade in her head?<eos> No.<eos> There is a knife in your brain.<eos> -Right, yeah.<eos> -By some miracle, you're still alive.<eos> If you're gonna get stabbed in the head, you picked exactly the right spot, but, then...<eos> -...you would.
Why would she keep that a secret?<eos> Maybe she felt embarrassed.<eos> A healer taking medication for an emotional disorder went against everything she believed in.<eos> New york's going to be so strange without her now.<eos> You're still going?<eos> On one of our early dates,olivia took me to the cloisters.<eos> She loved the architecture there and the history.<eos> It's where we fell in love.<eos> Spreading her ashes there is what she'd want me to do.<eos> Like hell she would.
Come on in.<eos> - Ben and Sun...<eos> - Heard what they needed to hear.<eos> And this does not concern them.<eos> Here we are.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's John Locke's suicide note.<eos> I...<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - Why would you?
By the calendar, 12 years.<eos> In here, of course, day before yesterday.<eos> You had a child.<eos> I only see the one photograph.<eos> We lost him, too.<eos> Paulie.<eos> His name was Paulie.<eos> He was just three years old.<eos> He'd be about your age.<eos> Yeah, he would.
I would be thrilled.<eos> Thrilled.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Pretty sharp, huh?<eos> No.<eos> Girls, I'm telling you, are not into the flashy stuff.<eos> They just want it simple, classy, like James Bond.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Would James Bond use a cane?<eos> No, he would not.
What do you want to do, Nak?<eos> I want to kill him.<eos> Look, he could give us Sachi's murderer.<eos> And then he goes free?<eos> The man who put my sister's head on a spike?<eos> If we don't cut this deal, then... her murderer could walk.<eos> It's your case, Booth.<eos> What I want doesn't matter.<eos> To me, it does.<eos> And it would to Sachi.
Can I help you?<eos> On your knees. Hands on your head.<eos> Okay.<eos> What have I got, a tail light out or something?<eos> Magnus...<eos> She had help.<eos> Can I just say, this was really exciting.<eos> You know, when they first asked me to run this project, the subject of maternal feelings came up.<eos> You see, I used to have a daughter.<eos> She'd...
At us.<eos> Now, why would this man fire his gun at you?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Did you maybe pay too much attention to his brand-new cadillac?<eos> It's a nice car, yeah.<eos> But look, lady, he's the crazy one, pointing his shiny little piece at us because we said we liked his car.<eos> What kind of a compliment did you pay his vehicle?<eos> She means, "how did you tell him you liked the car?"<eos> I just said, you know, "I'd look real good driving that cadillac around."<eos> - 'Cause I would.
You're very tall and... and dark and handsome and...<eos> Charlie doesn't have anything raunchier than that, because he likes to, you know, kick it old school with the pornography.<eos> - Know what I'm saying?<eos> - Church.<eos> Are these my beta-blockers?<eos> - I get real nervous before...<eos> - No, that's just a... lip gloss.<eos> Back in the old days, Sue used to blow me.<eos> But these days, she likes them younger... and balder.<eos> - Hey, would you... - OK.
Okay. My brain just popped a little bit.<eos> So when I said our days are numbered on the cot, well, all I was saying was...<eos> - Eddie.<eos> - All I was saying is that maybe we could be more of a thing, that's all.<eos> I could meet your kid.<eos> We don't have to keep hiding all the time.<eos> It'd be nice for a change, huh?<eos> Yeah, it would.<eos> Jackie, Mr. Everett's in the OR and I feel like if we had done more than give him clean clothes and a meal tray the last time, maybe he would still have his foot.<eos> He wouldn't.
- Don't. Ever.<eos> One vampire falling in love is bad enough.<eos> Yes. Bill Compton certainly has a knack for finding trouble.<eos> For instance, how does he know I'm having you sell vampire blood?<eos> The guards hear everything.<eos> Your Majesty, I'm sorry.<eos> - There's no way he could...<eos> - That is really bad.<eos> He does not know that you are supplying it.<eos> He'd better not.
Thank you.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sacajawea carried a baby on her back all the way to the Pacific Ocean. And somewhere, that baby thinks he discovered America.<eos> You, Don, have been standing on someone's shoulders.<eos> We brought you in, we nurtured you like family, and now's the time to pay us back.<eos> You can't go any further on your own, Don.<eos> Would you say I know something about you, Don?<eos> I would.
Oh, they're perfect.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Wow.<eos> I like that.<eos> Most women would've just put 'em in water.<eos> Well, Paige is our flower girl, and she needs petals to strewn.<eos> How much do I owe you for these?<eos> Oh, consider it my contribution to the wedding.<eos> Now that we're having the ceremony in malibu, maybe you would like to come to the wedding.<eos> Would you...
- Is that true?<eos> - I'm not upset, but I'm a little disappointed.<eos> Mocha joe, I asked you to do me a favor.<eos> - That's a favor.<eos> - Yeah, but you tip for a favor, larry.<eos> If you asked me to do you a favor I would say yes.<eos> I wouldn't expect any money in return.<eos> - I would do it out of the goodness of my heart.<eos> - Really? - You would do me a favor out of the goodness of your heart?<eos> - Of course I would.
